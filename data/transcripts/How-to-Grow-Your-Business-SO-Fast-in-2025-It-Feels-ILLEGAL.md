[00:00] The last three companies I found it in sold grew so fast it felt illegal.

[00:04] Use Allen got to $1.2 million per month at the end of the first year.

[00:07] Prestige Labs got to $1.5 million per month by the end of the first year.

[00:11] In Jim launch got to over $2 million per month by the end of the first year.

[00:15] I'm going to show you the strongest growth levers I used to get these results so that you can too.

[00:21] Let's start with the first one, which is nobody knows you exist.

[00:25] And if you're under $1 million in revenue, I can virtually guarantee that basically everyone

[00:29] on Earth doesn't know you exist.

[00:31] And so the first four hours of every day should be dedicated to solving that problem and going

[00:36] from obscurity to being aware.

[00:38] And so we do that by doing the Core 4 more, which is you have to do more outreach, colder

[00:43] warm, you have to make more content where you got to run ads.

[00:46] But the thing is, you don't need to do all of them.

[00:48] You pick one, you go all in, and that's what you spend your first hours every single day on.

[00:52] Now the reason that I talk about advertising more so much is that advertising is a boom.

[00:57] And if you're like, what's a boom?

[00:58] It's actually a term that I started using internally for our business, which is a business order of magnitude change.

[01:03] All right? And so fundamentally, if you think about a business, there are many things that you can optimize.

[01:08] So you can increase your close right by 10%.

[01:10] You can increase your conversion rate on your, on your opt-in page by 10%.

[01:13] You can increase your email follow.

[01:15] All of those things are optimizations.

[01:17] And so the problem is, with optimizations, you can only go to 100%.

[01:21] They're capped.

[01:22] But with advertising, you can, in a very real way, 100x the amount of people who find out about your business.

[01:29] And one of the keys that small business owners get stuck in is they get in this little

[01:32] optimization mouse trap where they're like, I need to move this.

[01:35] Oh, I was at 10.11 to one, and now I need to be at 10.21.

[01:40] It's like, dude, just get 100 times the leads and your business will grow.

[01:44] So here's what most people think when they think about their given marketplace.

[01:47] So let's say your local dry clanner.

[01:49] All right? You see that you're advertising on Facebook.

[01:51] And so you see you have the whole pie and so you're happy.

[01:54] So that's just you. Then you have you plus one other person.

[01:58] Then all of a sudden you've got half of the pie.

[02:00] Then it's you plus three other people in the marketplace.

[02:03] And now you feel sad. But the reality is, the marketplace is significantly bigger than you ever give a credit for.

[02:10] There are so many humans on earth. This is what it looks like in reality.

[02:14] You're actually only advertising on one of four different methods.

[02:17] And the way that you're doing it is only on one slice of the medium.

[02:21] And then within that you have your tiny little quarter that you aren't taking up.

[02:26] And so the marketplace says so many different ways they can communicate using each of the methods of communication.

[02:32] So for example, if I'm talking about content, I'm like, oh, there's somebody else in my marketplace who's marketing on Instagram.

[02:37] Okay, cool. So there's that, but isn't there also other platforms you can do it on?

[02:41] And don't you think that maybe there's enough people in your marketplace to satisfy your business?

[02:46] Probably the amount of times that I would have a gym owner for example who'd come to me and say, hey,

[02:50] there's this other guy in the marketplace who's now running Facebook ads. I'm like,

[02:53] you only need 200 people in your gym to be incredibly profitable. And right now, last time I checked,

[02:57] you've got a 1 million people in your city. And so you just have to get 200 of them.

[03:02] And so if there's 10 others or 100 other gyms that are advertising your area, even on the same platform,

[03:07] you still just need to get 0.002% of that audience to just come to you.

[03:13] And so you think that as these people enter, you're losing market share,

[03:18] but the reality is you're this tiny little spec and most people don't even know you exist.

[03:22] So the next growth principle is instead of trying to beat your competition, shrink your competition.

[03:29] Eminem has responded to hate in two ways publicly that I absolutely love.

[03:33] So the first is that when Will Ferrell confronted him about some things that Afrojack had said to him,

[03:40] he said, hey, Afrojack's been talking trash. Do you have anything to say about it?

[03:43] And Eminem just said, who? And then Will Ferrell repeated the statement. And then he just looked at him and he was like,

[03:48] who? And he was like, okay, yep, that's what I thought. And so the first is, I'm so big. I can't hear him.

[03:56] The second dairy is that you kill them with kindness. Right? So either grow so big that no one can see

[04:01] them or hear them or you meet them or they're at on a different game, which is you play on kindness and grace.

[04:07] And so in eight miles Eminem tries to claim all of the flaws that he has so that no one else can say anything.

[04:14] And so I get hit on a lot, not like that. For talking about working a lot, people are like,

[04:20] that's not healthy. And of course, I try to put disclaimers in every video like do whatever you want.

[04:24] Right? I get hit on for like, oh, I think he's trying to make money.

[04:30] Duh, I try to say it all the time. But people assume that I am trying to hide this for months.

[04:35] Of course, I'm trying to make money. I'm in business. That's the whole point I do this. And that way, if I always start with,

[04:39] I'm here to make money when I do something nice, then people are like, oh, well, that was nice of it.

[04:43] Rather than me claiming that I have to be the super kind, whatever person. And then when I try and make money,

[04:48] people are like, ah, shake their finger at me. Like it's not good. And so I try and learn from Eminem and just take all of the negatives that I can think that

[04:56] somebody would possibly say and then just claim them as my own. Because yes, we are off-lawed and none of us are perfect.

[05:01] And so for some reason, we are bothered when someone else points out our imperfections that we would

[05:05] readily state ourselves. We know we have deficiencies. What you want to do is overwhelm the marketplace

[05:10] so that you drown them out. You want to be so loud that no one else can hear them. You shrink them

[05:15] into a relevance by comparison. And so there's two ways that you can be on the tallest building. Right?

[05:21] You can knock everyone else down or you grow so that they become smaller in comparison to you.

[05:26] And so everyone sees their little building and thinks, oh no, I should knock all my competitors down. Right?

[05:32] When in reality all you need to do is build the biggest absolute building there. And the thing is is that you're going to block out the sun.

[05:39] And your shadow will be so big that no one can even see these people. And let me tell you a story about this.

[05:45] When I launched my last book, $100 million leads, I spent a tremendous amount of time and effort

[05:51] across. I think at the time we had 7-ish million subscribers or audience size across all platforms.

[05:58] I emailed a bunch. I made a ton of content. We spent money on ads. We did outreach. We had affiliates going.

[06:02] We had all these different channels going to get as many people as possible to the launch.

[06:07] And when I walk around Las Vegas because I live here, I will usually get stopped about three-ish times.

[06:14] When I do about a 60-minute walk. Mind you, I walk in a crowded area so it's not like I'm just

[06:19] walking in the neighborhood because then that would just be weird. Anyways, and of course you should be recognized very neighbors.

[06:23] But I'll get stopped by three people. And every time for the month leading up to the launch,

[06:27] I would be like, hey, you go to the book launch? 19 times out of 20. The people would look at me be like,

[06:33] what's the book launch? And I was like, how do you not know about this, right?

[06:37] But it was this wonderful reminder that most people, when you get tired of your advertising,

[06:42] most people don't even know your first name. If you have deluded yourself into thinking

[06:48] that you should only have to say something once and somehow everyone in the entire world has heard you say that thing,

[06:54] you are kidding yourself. You need to become a master of variety in terms of how you can

[07:00] re-say the same thing in different ways. And taking the natural extreme, there's this fallacy that most

[07:06] small business owners think and myself included for years, I thought this, was that repetition in

[07:12] it of itself is somehow bad. So let me explain. There's probably people on the internet. I personally

[07:18] follow a bunch of philosophy accounts. And so most of the philosophers are dead. And yet, I still

[07:25] love to see the quotes they have because they remind me of the things that I want to follow,

[07:31] the way that I want to live. And it's not like, oh, another Seneca quote,

[07:36] does this guy never give up? It's like he's dead. He hasn't come up with a new quote in 2000 years.

[07:41] And yet I still like seeing the quotes even though I know I've seen them before. And oftentimes,

[07:47] you serve that role for your audience more than anything else. Like we think that it's like, oh,

[07:51] I've said this one thing. Therefore, they have all changed the other behavior immediately and they never

[07:55] need to learn that again. But the biggest lesson that I've learned is that people need to be more

[07:58] reminded than they need to be taught. And in the off chance that you've received hate or you have a

[08:03] competitor who's talking crap and it happens. This counts double. So instead of trying to beat them

[08:10] or prove them wrong, you only have two options. Option one is you grow so big that no one can

[08:16] even hear them. The alternative is that you kill them with kindness, which is that you do not

[08:21] beat them by proving that you are right. You beat them by proving that you are kind.

[08:32] And then by comparison, they will look bad. And so I can only think I can tell you about having

[08:38] dealt with plenty of it in my day is that on the occasion that I do choose to respond to hate,

[08:43] I try to respond with kindness. And so someone can just absolutely tear me one and just say like

[08:47] this guy sucks, she's terrible, whatever. I will then usually say, hey, you're right. I'm a super

[08:53] flawed person. That being said, it seems like you've developed like a big audience here and they

[08:57] seem to like you and so congrats on your success. Right. When someone sees that, it's very hard

[09:03] for everyone to be like, man, that guy sucks. It's just like now, if I were to try and like

[09:07] list out all the points, all I do is invite more back and forth, which I don't want to do and

[09:11] it's a waste of my time. And so instead, you start all hate responses with you are right,

[09:16] because it's all they want to hear. And there's really nothing else to say after that. And so what's

[09:20] interesting is that oftentimes hate if you boil it down comes down to, I do not prefer the way

[09:26] this person does things. I have a different preference. And it's like great. Right. Like, I make

[09:33] money one way. He makes money another way. And therefore, he is wrong. It's like, you just do the

[09:38] way you want, which is awesome, because you do your way. And they do it their way. And the people

[09:41] were attracted to that will do that. People will try to yield to yours and great. Like, I mean,

[09:45] of course, there's engagement bidding and things like that because you know, people want to get

[09:48] views and all that. And I respect that. I get it. But, but big picture, I think you can't take it.

[09:55] You can't take it personally, because whenever I I phone that little trap, I think to myself,

[09:59] I'm a relatively developed monkey that is sitting on a little blue marble in a solar system.

[10:04] That's in one of a billion galaxies. And I'm worried about some screen that has words on it

[10:09] on a made up language that we had in the last 1500 years of how we communicate face noise to each

[10:13] other. And when I think about that, I think, you know, this would be pretty silly for me to like

[10:16] ruin a day over. So the third big growth lever, and this one's massive, is clear, not clever.

[10:22] All right. So what do I mean by that? Well, when I looked at the highest converting ads that I had run,

[10:28] and I do this pretty regularly, I look for different components. Sometimes I'm like, what's the hook?

[10:33] Sometimes I'm like, what's the color scheme? What's the, what's the visuals that are being displayed

[10:36] in the first however many seconds? And in this one particular pass, I just looked at the great level

[10:42] of the language that was being spoken. And the reason I looked at that, it was, I think it was, you know,

[10:46] one or two elections like what's it go. I'd heard this research study that had stated that the

[10:50] president who spoke in the lowest grade language was the one that won the election over and over again.

[10:56] And when I heard that I see presidential elections fundamentally as massive brand campaigns. And so

[11:02] I see that as they were able to communicate a message to a higher percentage of the population

[11:07] because they lowered the barrier to entry of comprehension, meaning more people got what they said.

[11:13] And so when I hear that, I thought, man, I like to use all these big fancy college words,

[11:18] and no one knows what I'm saying. And so all I do is feed my ego, not my bank account. And so I

[11:24] made one of my big marketing rules clear, not clever. And so you want to take whatever communication

[11:30] is, look at your landing pages, look at your ad copy, look at the words you're saying in your

[11:34] content and say, does a third grader understand this? And the point that some people try to make

[11:39] as counters like, oh, I don't want to talk down to my audience. No, when you speak in a more

[11:44] broken down manner, you help the experts understand it more easily and you help the beginners

[11:49] understand it for the first time. And so it's not that experts are all of a sudden saying, oh,

[11:54] no, I don't believe that because listen, we get tons of very big companies that come back

[11:57] with vision.com for investment. And the guys who run those companies, very intelligent, but I try

[12:02] to make my videos in a way that people can't understand them because who do I, who do I prove

[12:08] when I use a big word and then all of a sudden three quarters of the audience can't understand it.

[12:12] And if the point of me making these videos is to make real business education accessible for everyone,

[12:17] part of it making it accessible is making it interesting, making it fun, and making it comprehensible,

[12:22] which is the fancy word for understandable. And what you guys don't see behind the scenes is that

[12:26] I will typically self edit. And so I said distilled earlier in a sense, and then I said broken down

[12:33] for experts is because I said distilled and I was like, I have to use a different word, broken down.

[12:37] And then I said comprehensible and then I said fancy word for understandable. And so I try to constantly

[12:42] catch myself in this and it's also made me a significantly more effective leader. So if I'm

[12:47] trying to communicate with my team, I'm not trying to say big words. I don't want to impress them,

[12:51] I want to change what they do. And so I've taken this to such an extreme that with my books,

[12:55] I just use little stick figures, right? I have these little drawings. It's like, oh look,

[12:59] here's the guy who's walking on a path. Look, little apple orange, big dollar sign, little dollar

[13:04] size, right? We try to make this as simple as possible so that people can understand what's actually

[13:08] going on because if you can explain it to a third grader and this is Richard Feynman who said this

[13:12] is famous physicist, he said if you can explain it with third grader, then you understand it.

[13:16] If you can't, you don't and you need to understand it better so that you can break it down.

[13:19] And so the broader the audience, the broader the analogy and the simpler the language.

[13:24] And so I'll give you an example. One element is the grade language of the words you use. The second is

[13:29] what visuals or stories you use to depict them. And so if I'm talking to mechanics, I might use an analogy

[13:35] where I relate something they understand cars to something they might not understand to business,

[13:39] right, if I wanted to teach a specific concept. If I was talking to the same,

[13:44] I was trying to teach the same concept but I was teaching it to realtors, then I'd probably use

[13:48] a house analogy. If I was teaching to baseball people, I'd probably use a baseball analogy, right?

[13:52] And so if you have a narrow down audience, you'll increase comprehension by using

[13:57] analogies that they all understand. If you're talking to a broader audience, then you need to

[14:01] have a broader slice of the market, probably a more human experience that all of them have.

[14:07] So if I'm talking to everyone, I might talk about food. I might talk about sleep. I might talk

[14:11] about driving, right? Because most people do that assuming I'm not talking to children. And so

[14:16] you have to match the analogy to the history of learning from the people that you're trying to

[14:24] communicate to. And this is what takes you're marketing and you're advertising and puts it on steroids.

[14:30] And to put this to the test, this is something you can do right now. Look at whatever emails you send,

[14:36] run them through a reading grading level app, keep working on it until it's below fifth grade

[14:42] minimum, third grade if you're awesome. And then send it. I did this to our email follow-ups and

[14:47] had a 50% increase in conversion. I didn't change anything about what I said, but I saw that as I got

[14:54] 50% more people to understand. Because the goal here is to decrease the friction of comprehension.

[15:01] So if we think about the elements of value, speed, ease, time delay, these elements are all

[15:06] impacted by complexity. And so something complex takes longer to understand. It takes more effort.

[15:11] Right? And so it's harder. And so instead what we want to do is say, okay, how do I make it easy and

[15:16] faster? Okay? Well, then I'll just speak in a way that everyone understands. The next massive growth

[15:23] lever is proof over promise. Right? And so with this means is that in my earlier days,

[15:31] I would spend so much time on my promise. Right? And I wrote a whole book on promise. This was

[15:36] basically offers, right? And I would obsess about the offer. But then the offer is super important.

[15:41] But the only thing that's more important is proof. All right, so let me give you two hypothetical

[15:46] examples. Let's say that you've got business one that's selling thing one and business two that's

[15:51] selling thing two. Well, let's say they still compete for more or less the same audience. And

[15:56] business two says, we'll do x, we'll do y, we'll do z, we'll do w, and we'll guarantee x, y, and z. Right?

[16:01] And you look at their reviews and they've got a five-star rating and they've got one review.

[16:07] The other company says, we'll do x and they've got 11,382, five stars and they've got a 4.7.

[16:14] Who do you buy from? This guy, obviously, but why this guy has a better promise because you

[16:22] believe this guy. And so you want to have proof up to your eyeballs. Proof is your single

[16:28] highest priority as a business owner or marketer or advertiser or promoter for your business.

[16:34] It is the one thing that you prioritize. Before I enter any new space, launch a new product.

[16:38] The first thing that I do is try and get Bay to users. I work for free in exchange for

[16:43] testimonials, reviews, and feedback. And sometimes referrals are from lucky. But in the beginning,

[16:48] that is the highest most valuable thing that you can do. So people will say things like never

[16:54] work for free. And you only hear that for people who don't make that much money. If you make a lot

[16:59] of money, you will know that you spend so much time in the free phase because getting the product right

[17:04] is so important, is such high leverage. And so the proof process, both makes you convicted because

[17:12] you get the opportunity of many feedback loops to make your product better. So that you then can

[17:18] collect the positive feedback that you can then advertise to get more people like those customers.

[17:23] And the most compelling way to advertise anything is show don't sell. And if I just stand here

[17:31] and said nothing, and I said, and I just stayed in the facts and told the truth, and I said,

[17:35] I have 11,382 reviews, and our average review is 4.7, and I make pasta really good.

[17:47] And then, or I have one review from my mama, and I make super fragile,

[17:55] holistic expiolidosis pasta guaranteed, which one do you like better? Obviously, this one.

[18:02] You don't need to say much more. The proof is the pudding. The most important part of a message

[18:08] is the messenger themselves. They're inextricably linked from the thing that's being communicated.

[18:13] And this is what people seem to miss when they're making content, which is why I'm a big

[18:17] advocate of do epic stuff first. Then talk about what you did. And if the stuff that you didn't do

[18:23] is epic, focus more on the doing epic stuff, not on the talking about it. And so I started this channel

[18:29] with a commitment to a vendor saying, I'll make three to videos a week. And I was busy, and I was like,

[18:34] I'm just going to head a webcam and I'm going to talk to the camera. And that is how this channel

[18:37] was started. And the only reason, in my opinion, that people, the side of to listen, was because I just

[18:44] so happened to have sold a company for just under $50 million. And so because of that,

[18:49] there was proof that I was able to deliver on the promise, whereas somebody else might have a totally

[18:55] beautiful studio and have all these things. But they just forgot the one most important thing,

[19:00] which is why should I listen to you? And so either is going to have to be proof that you generated

[19:05] for yourself or proof from other people saying that you helped them achieve that thing. If any of

[19:09] these growth principles help you in thinking about your business differently so that you can

[19:14] scale faster or you need a senator team, it means the world to me if you share it. That's why

[19:19] I'm going to ask and appreciate it. So the next big thing is the hook. Now you're like,

[19:24] okay, I've heard about hooks before, not the way that I'm going to talk about it. All right. So the hook

[19:29] is greater than everything. Now you're like, wait a second, I thought proof is greater than everything.

[19:33] Well, the proof is going to be contained in the thing, but no one's going to see the proof,

[19:36] unless you have a good hook. All right. And so the one thing that I think has consistently been reinforced

[19:41] and it's just like a greater and greater percentage of my time is allocated towards this one part of

[19:46] my advertising that grows my company the most is I search for the best hooks and then I don't convince

[19:52] myself that I'm more creative than I think I am and I just keep using the ones that work. So think about

[19:57] like this. These are the only four things that you can do to advertise any business. You can warm out

[20:01] reach, so reach out when I want to be well, you know, cold hour reach, reaching when I want to be

[20:05] well, you don't know. You can run paid ads, which is going one to many to people you don't know,

[20:08] or you can post content, which is one to many to people you do know. And in each of these four

[20:13] situations, you can double triple five X the amount of people who open and respond, who click and watch

[20:21] your ad, who watch your content all the way to the end. And if you do something like that and you do

[20:26] increase the click three by go from 1% to 5% or 2% to 10% which absolutely can happen. When you do that,

[20:35] you in a very away can two X, three X, four X, five X your business with just that one thing.

[20:41] Remember I talked about earlier that advertising is a boom. It's an order of magnitude change.

[20:46] Well, what other one thing can you just tweak that then opens up the flow to the entire business

[20:55] based on how good the first five seconds are, with the first one second. And so in thinking about

[21:01] hooks, I think about both the visual hook as in what's happening, what that people can see, and then

[21:06] there's the auditory or verbal hook, which is what are the actual words that are being communicated.

[21:10] And we have right now, we reviewed our top YouTube videos of all time and I made a video about

[21:16] six months ago saying what we found, which is our hook formula is proof promise plan. And so if you have

[21:25] the opportunity to make content, make ads run cold outbound. If you can include these, I can almost

[21:32] guarantee that you will do better than if you include none of them. And this is a force multiplier on

[21:37] any kind of advertising you do. And so when I think about all the different things, all the effort

[21:42] that goes into advertising a business, if I can just do one thing. And the crazy part about hooks is

[21:46] they're the shortest part. They're the shortest part of the whole darn thing. And this is where David

[21:52] Ogilvius says, if you have written your headline, you've spent 80 cents of your advertising dollar.

[21:57] The more advanced the advertiser is that I meet, whether it's a content creator, someone who's

[22:01] on outbound, somebody makes paid ads, the more obsessive they are on the first frame, the first

[22:07] impression that someone gets because they know one, it increases the likelihood that the person's

[22:12] going to watch the rest of it and then potentially buy. And then two, it changes their entire

[22:16] perception of what follows. So we actually looked at this for speakers that an event, which was,

[22:23] if we change the intro, the one to two minute intro that we had for a 60 minute talk,

[22:29] the person's net promoter score. So what people rated them in terms of how good they were changed

[22:34] massively, even though the actual presentation was the same. So simply how we framed the presenter.

[22:41] The person having gone up on stage yet changed how everything they did afterwards was perceived.

[22:46] And so if there's two minutes that could influence the score that you get, the customer satisfaction,

[22:52] the amount of prospects, the one thing to focus on is nail the hook. Let me show you the four

[22:57] multiplication of this. We just started reviewing short-form content on the content team and just doing

[23:02] a more regular activity of saying, what are the things that make content do well? And there was a video

[23:07] that we were like, we think this thing is good. And so all we did is we took the same video that got like

[23:12] 40,000 views. And then we just chopped out the first three seconds that was kind of like getting into the

[23:18] into the video before the actual real hook was delivered. And by sniffing those three seconds and then

[23:23] just starting where the hook really was, it went from a 40,000 view video to a 780,000 view video.

[23:29] So you're talking about a 19x improvement. So I'm talking about, you know, 1% 2% talking 19x.

[23:36] That is why obsessing over the hook is so important. So the next big growth lever that gave us the

[23:41] super fast growth was more. So I talk about more, better, and new as the three primary strategies of

[23:51] growth. You either do more of what's already working. You do what you're doing to make it work better

[23:55] or you do something entirely new. Now most entrepreneurs love doing new stuff. And that's why it's

[24:00] called shiny objects syndrome. And it's a cancer and you should get that looked at. But the very

[24:04] boring answer is the mundane more. You have to master more. And instead of zero to one, which is what

[24:13] most people love doing. Oh my god, I finally got it to work. But actually doing 1 to end, which is

[24:17] how do I do is this thing is many times it's really possible with wanting to kill myself. And so

[24:22] here's the actual math explanation of this. More is typically the highest risk adjusted return

[24:28] strategy. All right. And so what that means is if you can do something and you already know it works,

[24:36] the likelihood that the next thing you do works is much smaller. And so this is why once you have a

[24:41] control, meaning you have a specific landing page or add or copy or email that you know converts,

[24:49] whenever you deviate from a high converting advertisement, the likelihood that the variant is going to

[24:55] beat it is typically low. And so you have to try a bunch of variations because all you're doing is

[25:00] messing something up that actually already works. If you had one sales guy and he's closing at 30%.

[25:08] Well, you could try and obsess to get into 35 or 40%. And that would be material. You know, you get a 25%

[25:14] lift overall 30% to 40% to 25% improvement. But you know, would be even cooler, just hired three more

[25:20] guys. And then you have a 4x or a 300% improvement. And so it's like I could get a 25% improvement,

[25:28] or I could get a 300% improvement. And me trying to change up the sales script also has a significant

[25:32] shot of me taking it from 30 down to 20 because it's a change. And so here's the thing is that when you

[25:38] change anything, you guarantee you incur the cost of change. But you do not guarantee that you get the

[25:44] benefit of change. And so in each of the core form methods, you do more outreach, which is colder warm.

[25:51] You go from 100 each out today to 200 each out today. Payed ads. You go from 100 dollars to $200

[25:55] day. You go from posting constantly, you go from posting once a day to twice a day. Right? Those are

[25:59] how you do more. And when I talk to the most experience advertisers that I know, the most experience

[26:05] business people that I know, the most common thing we talk about is we're kind of laughing the

[26:09] background of like, if people just people just don't know how much more they can do. That's honestly

[26:14] the real, that's the real is that when I when I have conversations small businesses, I just like,

[26:20] hey, I don't think I can do any more ads. You know, I'm running, I'm already running a $1,000

[26:24] day. I'm like, I mean, do there's businesses that run like 2 million a day. And so you usually have so

[26:30] much more runway than you think you do. And sometimes you just need someone to add to you to be like,

[26:35] dude, you can like, 10x this and nothing's going to change. But they think because of whatever

[26:39] mental limitation they have, you've never spent that much money on an ad before. You've never made

[26:44] that amount. Is it going to hurt my account? No, they want you to make good content. Is it going

[26:48] to hurt my ads? No, they want you to spend money. Is it going to hurt my, my average, you're going

[26:52] to people who've never met you before. So why would they know that you've sent it to another

[26:55] hundred people? Right? Is that there's this, these perceived fears. But most of the times it's just

[27:00] between your ears. Tell you guys a quick story about this. So when I had my first, I would say real business,

[27:06] which is my first location of my first gym. I had a mentor and he was a really good local marketer.

[27:12] And so he had a strategy for his tanning salons where he would bring in, I mean, thousands of customers

[27:18] every single quarter. And what he did was he would put out flyers. He just put flyers on cars

[27:23] and then had like a free VIP gift card and people come in redeem and meet flip them in the

[27:27] memberships. And so I figured, okay, I'll just run the same play. And so I did the flyers and I put

[27:34] 300 flyers out and I waited by the phone, be like, oh my god, I'm going to meet 300 people in here.

[27:39] It's going to be sick. And what happened? Well, my phone only ring once from the flyers and when I picked

[27:45] up the phone, the guy was like, hey, did you put the flyer on my car? And I was like, yeah, I did.

[27:50] I was like, what time do I did it? But he cut me off and he was like, you damaged my Mercedes. And I was like,

[27:54] oh, click. And I didn't know what to do. And as soon as I, I, and thankfully he never

[28:01] probably back because I definitely had to have the money to fix any Mercedes at that time.

[28:06] I called my mentor back up, you know, a week or two later once he was clear that no one else was

[28:11] going to call. I said, he said, hey, how the flyers work out? And I was like, well, they didn't work

[28:15] out at all. Actually, you know, I was like, take some attitude with him. He was like, oh, what was your

[28:19] test size? And he, like, he didn't take the baby. He was like, oh, what was your test size? And I said,

[28:24] what do you mean? He was like, well, like, what did you test with before you like, did the real campaign?

[28:29] And I was like, oh, why, I mean, I put 300 out. And he was like 300. He's like, you can't know anything

[28:36] with 300. I was like, what do you mean? He's like, I test with 5000. He's like, and then we put out

[28:42] 5000 a day for 30 days. And so I was looking at his results from 150,000 flyers over 30 days

[28:54] and comparing them to my results of 300 in a day. And once I saw that juxtaposition, I was like,

[29:03] got it. I will never make this mistake again. It was very embarrassing for me because I was on the right path.

[29:10] I just didn't do enough. And so one of the big metal lessons of this is that what presents as

[29:16] volatility is typically a symptom of low volume. So if you're like, man, I only get like, you know,

[29:22] a sale every week, every other week, it's kind of like, you know, it's, you know, most days,

[29:26] I don't get a sale in the every once in a while. I get one. It only appears volatile because you're doing

[29:31] so little per day. But if I looked at your year and saw that you closed about, let's say, 12 customers

[29:38] in that year, you closed one a month, for example, every, every three or four weeks you get a customer.

[29:43] Well, all I would do is look at your entire advertising activity for the year and say, okay,

[29:48] if we wanted to get 12 customers a day, we would have to do 365 times more advertising than we currently do.

[29:54] And if we did that on daily basis, we would get 12 customers a day. And so you just take your total calendar

[29:59] horizontally and then you flip it vertically for a day. And that is how much volume is required.

[30:04] And so most people just think that it's like, oh, they can't be doing more than twice as much as me.

[30:09] But in my experience, the people who are crushing it literally are doing a thousand times more than you.

[30:14] And that's the part that like, until you sometimes you hear it or you have someone ahead of you,

[30:18] say it, it doesn't become real for you. And since why make these videos is to try and like push as much,

[30:22] you know, out of out of my brain and history so that you can just get the story without the scar.

[30:27] And that's the whole point. Okay. So once you're like, okay, I have something that's working,

[30:33] I should just do way more of that awesome. Well, the next thing the next power lever here is word of mouth.

[30:38] And it's not the way that you think. So word of mouth people weren't familiar with for furrows,

[30:43] you know, customers tell other customers or other prospects that your stuff is good.

[30:48] But what a lot of people don't understand is that negative word of mouth is significantly stronger

[30:54] and faster than positive. And so Disney did this big study where they found that it takes 37

[31:00] tragic moments to make up for one magic moment. And versus there's basically like a five X versus 37X

[31:07] on if someone has a good experience, they tell five people if someone has a bad experience,

[31:11] they tell like everybody. And so a new business owner often will get customers pretty cheaply.

[31:19] And then all of a sudden, cost start going up. And part of the reason that cost go up faster,

[31:23] because you can actually put mouth to this, which is understanding the difference between CPM,

[31:27] which is cost per impression. And if it's like, why is it em? It's meal, which is French for thousands.

[31:32] So cost for thousands of impressions versus CPL, which is cost per lead. All right. And so if you're

[31:39] CPMs, more or less, stay the same. But your cost per lead has two X were three X were four X. Well,

[31:47] if it's not costing you more to reach those people, then it means that fewer of them are responding.

[31:52] And if that's the case, and you're just going to still relatively warm markets, then the issue is that

[31:59] instead of having positive word of mouth working for you, which should be actively lowering the amount of

[32:05] cost that it takes to get a new customer, you have word of mouth working against you. And so people who

[32:11] would otherwise purchase from you heard something negative and then choose not to. And so now all of a

[32:17] sudden you have to reach three times the amount of people because two out of the three people who would have

[32:21] gone and bought your thing, heard it was bad. And then now you only have one person who's just heard

[32:26] nothing. And so over time, the percentage of the audience that's neutral or hasn't heard of you

[32:31] gets smaller and smaller and smaller. And so it's way harder to grow off a word of mouth that's

[32:35] positive, but it's really easy to get crushed on negative word of mouth. And for whatever reason,

[32:40] no business owner ever claims that they have negative word of mouth. But I can tell you,

[32:46] half of you are below average. That's a fact. And this is why I emphasize the proof over promise

[32:52] earlier on so much because if I'm going to get negative word of mouth, which I know I am if I'm

[32:58] starting out, I want to keep that as concentrated and quiet as possible. I don't want anybody to know.

[33:02] Right? And so of course I'm not going to charge the money because the last thing I want to do is also

[33:06] have their money when they're upset. Right? So it's like, hey, I'm making this trade, you're going to

[33:10] get stuff. It's probably not be that good. My only ask is you give me feedback. Right? Tell me how I

[33:15] can make this right. Tell me how I can make it better. Right? And when you ask those types of

[33:18] questions, you get the types of answers that can also be create more value for the customer. And then

[33:22] once you get positive feedback, positive feedback, positive feedback. Now you have something that people

[33:26] actually want, then you can need to introduce strangers to it. And of course you're going to

[33:30] roll into the next issue, which is, okay, how do I keep that consistent because now it's not me doing

[33:33] everything about a team and we'll get into that. Ah, this is really good. So the next big growth

[33:38] lever is steel. Uh-oh, what am I saying? What am I to say? From yourself. So one of our portfolio

[33:46] companies, which is very large, hired a new advertising director. And that advertising director

[33:51] had came in with lots of new ideas. And so the founder, because he wanted to teach an important

[33:55] lesson to the advertising director, said, sure, let's do all of your ideas. And so he sat there,

[33:59] he said the scripts, he, you know, he recorded all these ads, he took multiple days to do it.

[34:04] And what ended up happening is that they ran all the ads and they didn't work. And so he said,

[34:09] hey, crazy idea, what if we use the same hook that's been working for three years? And they used

[34:15] the same hook and the ads worked. And so think about like this, Nike, on its second year after

[34:23] just do it, wasn't like, hey, just do it's kind of old. Let's switch it up. It's like,

[34:28] when you find a message that converts, you keep hammering the message. When you find the

[34:33] ad hooks and you find the processes that work well for you, most times you'd be better served,

[34:42] just continuing to reuse it because you will get bored of it far before your customers ever do.

[34:46] So believe it or not, there's actually math to support this. So Serge,

[34:51] Brandon, Larry Page, I can't remember which one of them is like a brilliant math petition. And

[34:54] actually was able to prove this ratio out. And so when you're stealing from yourself, you want

[35:00] 70% of all of your effort to go into basically carbon copying the thing that works. And this works

[35:06] across all functions. This works for a sales script, this works for product, this works for reinvestment

[35:10] activities like this rule works. The second is adjacent. So something that's just like one degree

[35:17] removed. Right? So it's close to the core of what you normally do. Okay? So instead of saying,

[35:22] starting with school communities, the fastest way to start an online business. Right? I could say

[35:25] that would be a hook and it's a hook that worked. I could say, um, one of the fastest ways to

[35:29] start an online business to start a school community. Right? That would be a variation of

[35:32] something that we knew that those words weren't. But it would be adjacent to it, not the exact

[35:36] carbon copy, but similar. Now 10 is, that means that one at a 10 of the things that you're putting

[35:41] your effort towards. All right, would be something that's brand-spoken new, completely, you know,

[35:45] out of left field. And when you look at your effort in your business, I can almost guarantee you

[35:53] that you have this flipped. And I only say this because I speak from experience.

[35:58] Um, is that this is what I would do. I was spending 70% of my time on new crazy things, new ideas,

[36:03] all the stuff that excited me. And then 20% I'd be like, oh yeah, um, I'll do something kind of

[36:07] different from what I was doing before. And then 10% of like, fine, oh, maybe. And this is, this is a

[36:12] maybe. Most of them is like, oh, I already used that. Use that hook once. I don't want to use it again.

[36:16] I don't want to use the same hook that worked before in another ad. It's silly. Also, different version

[36:21] of this from an advertising perspective of the 20% is you use the exact same hook, be a different

[36:26] background. So it's just like a different variation. So it's like I can work different shirt,

[36:28] I can have a different setting. And I can still deliver the same hook. And to me, that would still be

[36:32] kind of a 20% variation. All of your competitors are copying your stuff and taking what's working.

[36:39] When you find something that's works, keep doing it. Deviation from what works is more likely not to work.

[36:46] Think about it like this. If you demolish a building. So let's say we build a building and it

[36:50] takes us two years to build a building, right? There's our building. Tuck us two years.

[36:54] Demolishing it might take five minutes to put a bomb on boom because the place of the bricks and the

[37:02] steel in that building, every other potentiality that those bricks could go to, create not a building.

[37:07] But there's only one placement of that brick and steel that creates a building. And so you have

[37:12] unlimited options for destruction and only one for solution. And so when you do find something that

[37:17] works, the likely that when you change it and you move the brick and you move the scaffolding

[37:22] that you destroy the building is very high. Something can literally go anywhere except for the right place.

[37:26] And so you can have more options and all of them be wrong. So once you're done stealing from yourself,

[37:32] then let's talk about emotional versus logical buyers. This is a huge, like, monstrous increase in

[37:40] business for me. So if you've heard from the marketing world, there's logical and there's emotional

[37:46] buyers. I had heard it growing up and I kind of repeated it over and over again because I hadn't really thought about.

[37:51] I don't actually think that's true. And so let me explain. I actually think that there's a

[37:57] continue of a buyers that people sit on and you've got people who require more information so they're

[38:02] high in-phobias. And then you've got people who require less information. And there's two elements

[38:08] this. One is their informational requirement and secondarily how much info they have received.

[38:13] And so you could have a high information buyer that's further closer to this little

[38:17] dollar sign here that only needs a little bit more information in order to buy. And then you have

[38:22] some people that just generically buy lots of stuff. And everybody loves those people. Of course,

[38:27] but guess what? Everybody fights over those people. And so the thing is is that the amount of low

[38:31] information buyers is like this. The amount of high information buyers is an order of magnitude or

[38:38] multiple orders of magnitude greater. Only crazy people buy immediately. It's very normal for

[38:43] people to want to have more information before making a decision. And so when we think about our

[38:49] advertising, the reason that the direct response community typically can't grow very large businesses

[38:55] most of the time is because they only advertise to these people. And this pool of buyers is significantly

[39:01] smaller. But the reason building a brand, for example, and investing in an audience is because you're

[39:07] trying to move them down this line. Now, when I heard this in the earlier days of my career,

[39:13] I was like, I don't have time for that. I need to make money. I get it. Sure. In the beginning,

[39:16] you just advertise the six inch pots. But when you want to scale, you have to educate a higher

[39:22] percentage of the audience because they will require more to buy. The way to move people through this

[39:30] is something that Eugene Swartz pioneered in his book, Break Through Advertising. And he talks

[39:37] about the five levels of awareness. So he has unaware people. So people have just no idea about

[39:42] anything. The next is problem aware. So they have some sort of pain. You have solution aware.

[39:51] You have product aware. And they have most aware. Okay? So those are the five stages. Now,

[39:59] a customer will basically move in this direction going from unaware to most aware. And if you want

[40:05] to go to broader and broader audiences to get their attention, the unaware audience you typically

[40:11] have to go off of broad curiosity. And so if you've ever seen those crazy ads that are weird

[40:17] articles like Arizona State, blah, blah, has this new, blah. They're trying to go after a massive

[40:23] audience people who have no idea what's going on. That new, you know, scientific breakthrough

[40:28] could lead you to buying a supplement. It could lead you to buy a weight loss thing. It could

[40:32] lead you to buying some sort of equipment. It could lead you to buying insurance. Like it could

[40:35] go in any direction. But it's the curiosity that gets them in. Problem aware would be something

[40:41] to the extent of like, do you wake up to P3 times the night? Does it hurt when you've been

[40:45] over to tire shoes? Do you get out of breath when you play with your kids? Those are going to be

[40:49] problem aware. Now, they again, that could lead you to a supplement that could lead you to insurance

[40:54] that could lead you to whatever. But it's a slightly more or a person. At least they're problem

[40:59] aware. Solution aware is that somebody knows of the potential things that they could buy and

[41:04] you're helping them select between them. Product aware is at even a more micro level. And most

[41:09] aware is typically your existing customers. So here is where you just make offers. Right? This is why

[41:15] the book offers is where I started because the people who are here is the tiny audience here.

[41:20] And so you just make an offer to get them to buy. But that only works for this tiny audience.

[41:25] So you will make money quickly doing that, but you will also cap yourself quickly. In an effort to

[41:30] figure out, okay, well, how much should I allocate between these most aware, less info people,

[41:35] and the maybe problem, unaware, high information people who require more education in order to make

[41:40] a purchasing decision? Well, I had one of the most enlightening conversations I've had in a really

[41:45] long time with Ben Francis who's a CEO of Jim Shark. And then he introduced me to Chris Davis,

[41:50] who's the CEO of new balance. And so we had an awesome conversation talking about what Chris

[41:56] had done and new balance and helped them just skyrocket their sales. And so what they did is that when

[42:02] he took over 30% of their advertising budget was going to here. It was going to the broad

[42:08] awareness level storytelling emotional stuff. And then 70% was basically geared towards buying shoes,

[42:14] saying, hey, go buy these shoes. What he did when he took over was that he flipped them.

[42:19] He ended up with 70% going to big high level pairings endorsements,

[42:25] specific athletes that they wanted to recruit that they felt represented their brand. And only 30%

[42:30] of their advertising budget went towards actually telling people that they had shoes and that they were

[42:35] for sale. And so after he made that flip, here's the crazy part. It took 18 months

[42:42] for them to see the return on that budget. And so if you're in a rush, this isn't going to work,

[42:48] but if you're in a rush, you're never going to get big anyways. Keeping this ratio made this

[42:53] concept tactical for me. And so when I think about my marketing effort, my marketing dollars,

[42:58] and most importantly, how I measure it, my marketing impressions, I want to make sure that 70%

[43:03] or more of the advertising impressions that someone's going to get are going to be around the

[43:08] pairings that I want of me giving something rather than asking. So when we look at this ratio,

[43:13] this is actually super well studied between 70 and 30% here. Because right now,

[43:19] it's actually 3.5 to 1 is the ratio that has been studied 3.5 to 1,

[43:26] of give, to ask, to basically not lose audience. And so if you look at television, for example,

[43:34] when they've already studied, how many commercials can we jam into the show before people stop watching?

[43:38] And so they figured it out that it was every 3 and a half minutes of content, they could

[43:43] basically put one minute of advertising him. If you look at your Facebook newsfeed, for every three

[43:48] posts you get when you scroll, you'll get one ad. And the platforms that grow the fastest have a

[43:54] larger percentage of this give and a smaller percentage of ask. TikTok for years had zero ads in the

[44:00] platform, and just wanted to grow as virally as possible, and they acquired more users because they

[44:05] had a gift first give all the time strategy. And so the fact that they settled on this ratio,

[44:11] and it has been corroborated, fancy word for it, it's worked in multiple other places, made me think,

[44:16] wow, there's something to this. And so this makes this concept of how do I balance

[44:22] high information buyers, people that need more brand, people that need more education prior to purchase,

[44:27] with me making money, is that you basically start with that ratio, add patience and time,

[44:32] and then it becomes a snowball that compounds unto itself. And then you will get to a point in the

[44:37] future where you're still, you're doing so much more than you could ever possibly do if you only

[44:43] focused on the direct response on the less information, but you're actually still digging the well

[44:48] for what you're going to do next year. And so basically you can see when a founder stop

[44:52] surrounding a business and then the corporate execs come in because what they do is they flip the

[44:55] ratio, they basically pull forward demand from the future. They you had the the founder dug the well,

[45:01] and then they just suck all the water out of the well, but then they didn't dig the next well.

[45:05] And so you always going to be ahead of demand. I'll give you even more tactics if you guys want

[45:09] more tax fine, I'll give you more tactics. So B2B businesses and B2C businesses do this differently.

[45:14] This was something that took me a really long time to figure out. And so B2C businesses,

[45:19] so like business to consumer businesses will typically do these types of pairings in terms of

[45:25] high information buyers by telling emotional stories, making associations, getting endorsements,

[45:30] from athletes and influencers or organizations that represent the values that they think

[45:35] resonate positively with their ideal audience. And once they do that, they then can place the

[45:39] product next to those associations so that they can then pair them and then the person wants to

[45:43] buy the product as a consequence. That is what it looks like in a B2C business. But it took me a really

[45:49] long time to think through. Well, what does this look like for B2B business? And so I break this down

[45:54] into several tactical things. So number one is aspirational outcomes that you have achieved,

[46:01] or the business has helped facilitate. Secondly, people like this person, like your avatar,

[46:08] that you have help facilities, so just to be clear stuff that you did, stuff that you help other people

[46:11] do. The third is stuff that you help them do, the prospect themselves, which you can only facilitate

[46:18] at least in my opinion in two major ways. One is that you give them free content and education,

[46:23] which is why I make this stuff. And the second is that you give them free products and services.

[46:26] So it's just why the books are free, they're on my site, you can read them, you consume them,

[46:30] there's a scaling roadmap there, personalized, all that stuff is free. Because fundamentally,

[46:36] it's two degrees of separation if some person does it. Alex had a big exit,

[46:40] now he's a big portfolio, cool. That's two degrees of separation. There's other companies in the

[46:44] portfolio or other businesses who look just like mine that he helped scale, one degree separation.

[46:49] I used to stuff and made more money. Zero degrees of separation. And this is always going to be

[46:54] stronger than anything else, but it'll take longer. And so in understanding the difference between

[46:59] B to C and B to B in terms of, what do I do top of funnel here? How do I allocate my resources?

[47:04] It means that I'm spending time putting together the course in my spare time so that you guys

[47:09] can go consume it on how to make offers, how to get leads, how to scale companies from zero to 100

[47:14] million. That's time. That's effort. That's my team who's behind the camera right now. That's

[47:18] budget that goes towards that because I'm not looking for demand today. I'm looking for those

[47:23] of you who are going to scale your companies in five years at me up. Let's say acquisition not

[47:27] common with public tomorrow and I got asked it for being rude, which I probably would. And then

[47:30] they put in a new CEO. And that new CEO says, I need to hit quarterly earnings. So what would he

[47:35] probably do? He probably switched to lots of direct response and he probably cut down all the

[47:41] budget on the gifts and the books and all the stuff you're like, well, there's no ROI in a book.

[47:45] Like, books don't make any money. It's like, yeah, not today, but they bring people into our world

[47:52] and when they do have the next billion dollar company, they will hit us up first. And that's the goal.

[47:58] But that guy will just say, well, you know, scroll that. I'm going to recapture all this marketing

[48:02] spending effort. We're going to focus it all on these direct response ads, tell people to buy buy buy

[48:06] and you know what for a quarter and it'll work. Maybe two quarters of the work. But all of a

[48:10] sudden, it'll start slowly going down. Slowly going down. Slowly going down. Then what happens?

[48:13] They call the founder back up and they're like, hey, help help us fix this. And then the founders

[48:18] going to say, I can't do it in a quarter. Like, it's going to take me a year, year and a half to basically

[48:22] right size the ship because you sucked all the well, strife and I'm going to have to start digging again.

[48:26] So the next one is some of my marketing laws. So I'm going to give you a few of them and I'll start

[48:30] with the first one that you if you've heard my channel, then you should know this one. It should be

[48:33] ingrained in your brain, which is state the facts and tell the truth. And the reason this is so important to me,

[48:39] is that it forces me as a advertiser, business person to change reality. And so rather than try and

[48:49] exaggerate, it makes more sense to put all of the effort into doing epic stuff and then telling a

[48:56] truthful story rather than telling an epic story about something that was underwhelming. And I think

[49:00] the vast majority of marketers and marketing do the second thing. They have something normal and

[49:05] then they try to try and tell an exaggerated story of it rather than having something absolutely insane

[49:10] and just stating the facts and telling the truth. And I can tell you that the second, this one,

[49:14] stating the facts and telling the truth is the best long-term strategy. And so how do I actualize this?

[49:19] All right. So number one is that we make the truth more compelling. All right. We actually change reality.

[49:23] The second is that we show only what we can show. And so I remember I was talking to a martial arts

[49:29] guy and he's like, there's all these other martial arts studios, you know, in my area, how do I stand

[49:34] out? And I said, well, what's your specialty or whatever? And he said, I'm a double secret black belt of

[49:39] something. And I said, okay, well, how many doubles are your black belt? So he said, well, there's only six

[49:42] in the nation. And I was like, okay, what do any of them live in your area? And he said, no, I was like, well,

[49:46] why don't you say that? Right? Why don't you say that? So every business, if you get narrow enough,

[49:52] has something that's unique about it. You might have the best parking. You might have the fastest,

[49:57] you know, introduction to getting somebody to sit down. You might have the most gyms, you know,

[50:01] whatever it is, the most customers, the most customers at a certain price point, the most, like,

[50:05] you just need to slice the data of the business to figure out what is unique about your business. And I

[50:10] remember this moment in a madman, which is an advertising show, it's like an old 50 show, well,

[50:15] it's a new show about the 50s. Anyways. And Don Draper who's the lead character who's an advertising

[50:20] guy is pitching a client who's a cigarette company. And they're trying, they're like the third or

[50:25] fourth in the category, they're highly commoditized, they're competing on price and they're losing.

[50:30] And so he asks them to explain how cigarettes are made. And they kind of roll their eyes and

[50:35] like, why is this important? He's like, okay, well first we have the plants and then we take

[50:38] and he keeps going through it. He's like, and then we let it sit out in the sun. He's like, what do you

[50:43] mean? He's like, you know, to to to draw out the leads. He's like, so you toast them. He's like, yeah,

[50:48] we toast them. He's like, it's toasted. And so that was a unique part. He just sliced down and got

[50:56] really narrow about one particular part of the process and was able to pull that out and emphasize

[51:00] it so that people are like, oh, this is different than other things. And the really important part

[51:05] about this is that maybe some of the other cigarette companies also toast it, but they don't say

[51:11] that they toast it. And so the perception is still that it's different, even if it is the same.

[51:16] And so the best version of this is finding something that's truly unique. The second best version

[51:21] is to just say something that's unique about something that everyone else already does but that your

[51:25] customers don't know. And so the the corollary to that is say what only you can say. So you show it

[51:32] only you can show and you say what only you can say. So the showing part is going to be like, okay,

[51:37] with the toasting thing, how do we display that visually? With the super secret black off, then how do

[51:41] we display that? And you could show the black thought. You could show you shaking your hands,

[51:44] getting the certification. You could show you winning some tournament. Right? If you were, if you're

[51:48] toasting, you could show the bed of all the the debacle that's getting toasted and the smells

[51:52] and the whafting through the air, whatever. Right? And then you describe it in a way that only you can say.

[51:57] And so to do this, you get narrower to be more unique. And so the thing is is that you don't need

[52:04] to be the best in the world. You need to either best in a puddle. It's more important that you are the

[52:08] best than what you are the best of. I would rather be from a marketing perspective, not absolutely.

[52:15] I'd rather have the 10th biggest company in the world than the first biggest company in Indiana.

[52:20] But from an advertising perspective, it is more compelling to be the best. And I'll tell you

[52:25] story that I haven't told. John Rockefeller, when he was early on in his oil empire,

[52:35] bid to buy the biggest oil refinery in Cincinnati. And he was the second biggest. And he ended up

[52:44] overpaying for the business. And the business owner of the oil refinery laughed at him and kind of

[52:50] laughed his way to the bank. He was like, you completely overpaid for this thing. And so then what John

[52:54] D. Rockefeller did after he bought the second the first biggest and he already had the second biggest

[52:59] is that he then was able to say he was the biggest. And then in the next 30 days, he'd over 20

[53:06] M&A deals. In the next 30 days, to consolidate the entire rest of the market because he became the gorilla.

[53:13] And so he was willing to overpay for the asset to get the story. The difference in value between

[53:21] what he should have paid for those 20 deals and what he was able to pay by strong arming those

[53:26] smaller competitors because he was now the gorilla more than made up for what he minorly overpaid

[53:32] or maybe even majorly overpaid for the one company that he bought. And when he recants the story,

[53:37] when he tells the story again, he talks about how that competitor didn't see the bigger picture.

[53:44] And that was always, it was such an, I remember reading it in the letters that he wrote to his son

[53:48] and thinking to myself, that is powerful. He was willing to overpay for the story. He saw it as an

[53:56] investment in his brand in his reputation. And so the guy who sold it just saw it as him overpaying

[54:01] for a product, but he wasn't appropriately valuing how much true brand value that would give

[54:07] Rockefeller as a result. The next big growth lever is all about the list. All right. So when I talk

[54:14] about the list, people immediately think that I'm talking about email is direct mail list and sometimes

[54:18] that's true. But I'll give you a hypothetical example. So let's say I am selling winter coats.

[54:24] And I advertise an amazing offer on some killer coats that people love, they look amazing,

[54:30] and nothing comes back. Well, what could have happened? Well, if I showed my advertised with the

[54:36] people who live in South Florida, the likely that they buy my very expensive, really heavy and hot

[54:41] winter coats is very low. It has nothing to do with my offer, nothing to the ad creative, nothing

[54:46] to with my pricing, nothing to do with anything. It's just the wrong people are seeing it. And so

[54:51] many smaller businesses think that marketing doesn't work when in reality they were showing it

[54:58] to the wrong people. And so the first thing that you have to get right in marketing is targeting

[55:03] the correct audience. And so this is different by method of advertising. And so if we pull up our

[55:11] core four here, you want to reach out to people that you know are suffering from the problem that

[55:16] you solve or have a high likelihood of suffering from the problem that you solve. And the narrower

[55:21] the problem, the smaller the list. From a paid-outs perspective, this is where the targeting by platform

[55:27] gets more important. And this is why some ad platforms tend to be more profitable than others,

[55:30] because what makes an advertising platform successful is how well targeted it is. In fact, Facebook

[55:36] was so good that they had to roll it back because of privacy loss. But it was so effective at targeting

[55:40] people that people complain because it was so good. It felt creepy. Posting content, this is where

[55:44] the algorithm itself based on this is what's crazy. What you look like and how you talk and what you say

[55:52] will impact what the AI serves your content to the same works with paid ads. And so if I want to

[55:59] get more women to buy a product, guess why I'm not going to have in the ad? Me, because this is

[56:07] not what attracts lots of ladies, right? This is just usually a bunch of entrepreneurs who tend

[56:12] to have beard and like fitness or whatever else. But like my audience is like 89% male. And

[56:18] sure for my 11% females, keep rocking. I appreciate you. But by and large, I have a male driven

[56:24] audience. Now maybe it's because I talk about money, but there's tons of female entrepreneurs

[56:28] who talk about money and don't have predominantly male audiences. And so it's just that my way of

[56:32] saying things and or the algorithm just tends to display it to do. And so one of the easiest ways to

[56:37] make sure that you're displaying your ads to the right avatar is make sure that the person in the

[56:42] ad looks like the avatar. And I'll tell you a funny story. So when I was running the gym launch

[56:48] 1.0 version, which is where we used to fly out to gyms and do the turn rounds, I found out that

[56:53] when I put the thank you page. This is before I automated schedulers even existed, so it's kind of

[56:56] wild. I remember when I had my first automated schedule to put on the thank you page, I thought I had

[57:01] like I cured cancer. I was like this is the coolest thing. People can automatically book. Like I don't

[57:06] have to call them and work to leave. And so anyways, the thank you page that I set up was just like

[57:12] hey Texas number. And then the second version of the thank you page was hey my name's Alex,

[57:17] I'm a woman calling you. So I put a picture of me and I said I'm going to be calling you from this number.

[57:21] So I tried to put some visual to it. Then when I put Layla's picture on the thank you page and said

[57:26] Layla is going to be the one contacting you. What do you know? Our response rates went through the

[57:31] roof. People were immediately responsive. They were showing up to appointments. They were oh yeah sure

[57:35] I could make five o'clock for me. They're like oh no. I don't give it right. It's so if you want to

[57:40] attract a certain avatar, try to make sure that what is in your content, how you talk, matches the

[57:46] way they talk because fundamentally all marketing works as long as you get the targeting right. It's

[57:53] like think about this way. If you walk into a room, I like to visualize marketing because people

[57:58] people overcompel get it. If I walked into a room and I got on stage and there's a thousand people in the room.

[58:03] If those thousand people were my deal customers, then even if I had just like a really mediocre offer

[58:10] and something that they like kind of wanted, I would get some response. Now it might not be efficient.

[58:17] It might not get me the return I want. So I might lose money but I might I would probably make

[58:21] something right. I would get some clicks. I would get some leads right. And so it would allow me

[58:25] to start the feedback loop so I could improve. But if nothing is coming through, it's simply

[58:30] because the wrong people are seeing it. And so one of the highest leverage ways of getting more from

[58:34] advertising is just making sure the right people are seeing it. Which is a perfect transition into the

[58:40] next one, which is how do you know that you've mastered something, which is that masters have more

[58:46] ways to win. Now what does that actually mean? They understand the many different ways that you can measure

[58:53] progress. So if you were to talk to an HR professional, okay, and you ask them what you do.

[59:01] A lot of times they're going to give you a couple of egg answers like you know a payroll and I'll

[59:05] make sure that people get in their benefits and whatever. But when you talk to someone who's a

[59:10] master at this and I remember the first time I had somebody who completely improved my understanding

[59:14] of talent and acquisition and recruiting. In the interview, the candidate said, oh, well what's your

[59:22] time to fill? And I was like, what do you mean? She was like, well the average time to fill a roll.

[59:26] I was like, I don't know. She was like, oh, what's your two side of fit? I was like, I don't know what you mean.

[59:32] And so she was like, okay, what's your cost to acquire talent? And I was like, I don't know.

[59:39] And so she had all of these different metrics that she was using to measure, which completely

[59:44] made sense to me. Like I have cost to acquire a customer, I should have cost to acquire a talent.

[59:48] I should have, you know, what's my cash conversion cycle? How quickly do I get my first say how quickly do I

[59:53] fill a roll? And then in terms of like customer satisfaction is basically employee satisfaction of

[59:58] how likely is it that the manager and the employee both say at day 90 that this is a 10 out of 10

[60:04] fit. And so when I started looking at that I was like, oh wow, there's a total there's a whole

[60:08] another level of understanding this that I had no idea about because masters have a higher quality

[60:15] and quantity of metrics that they use to measure progress. And so if I am trying to fix this

[60:21] function, I have nothing to know how well I'm doing. And so a beginner will try to advertise or

[60:27] will try to sell and they will have binary outcomes. They'll just say, I didn't sell or I did sell.

[60:31] All right, got leads or I didn't get leads. But there are so many nuanced steps between them. And

[60:37] when you have the milestones, the progress markers, it allows you to fix things so you can keep moving

[60:43] the buck along until you get the outcome. And so I'll tell you story about this. So when I was

[60:48] starting out about way back in the day, I was a new channel for us and I'd never done it. And about

[60:55] 90 days or or four months in my executive team kind of did like intervention. So they came together

[61:02] I was like I was getting like a drug rehab, right? They were like, we think this is a problem. We think

[61:06] this is a shiny object. We think you're you're distracted and we should double down to what works.

[61:10] And I was like, how dare you use my words against me? Right? And the thing is is that strategically,

[61:14] I knew we needed to have a second acquisition channel for us to sell the business. And so I was like,

[61:20] no, it's because they could only see that we'd only done one sale in four months and a hundred

[61:24] percent of my time was going towards this. But what they didn't see was all the progress that we were

[61:28] making. And so I had hired degrees of mastery in this now to be fair. It was just because I had

[61:33] learned it along the way. But when it started, it was like, okay, well, we have to get a list. So

[61:37] where do we get the list? So we looked at, you know, bought a bunch of different lists. A lot of

[61:39] them listed and work. One of them did really. Okay. This is a good provider. And then we start,

[61:42] you know, like, oh, we got enriched the day. So we start learning how to enrich the day. Then we

[61:45] started calling them. But then you know, it was picking up. And then we had to learn how call wrapping works.

[61:49] We get local numbers. And then all of a sudden people start picking up and then starting hanging

[61:52] up on us. And then we had to fix the the hook in the script. And then we fixed the hook in the script.

[61:55] People would make it a minute. But then they'd hang up on us. So then we got we fixed the hook. And then we

[61:58] fixed the offer. And then people would then go to the second call. But then they weren't showing up for the second call.

[62:02] And so it's like, we have to just keep moving the buck along the way. But if you looked at it,

[62:07] two months in, it's like, you know, a heart surgery looks like murder to somebody from the outside

[62:11] who doesn't understand the milestones. And so as you master something, if you don't know why

[62:15] something's not working, look closer. Look for the smaller attributes that you can actually zoom in on

[62:20] and say, okay, well, we'll get a sale eventually if we just keep moving in this direction. And so look

[62:25] for a directional correctness rather than binary. And so this is a perfect example of masters have

[62:31] more leading indicators to success than beginners to beginners. Typically look at surely the

[62:36] lagging in it. They just say, turn is up. They look sales are down revenues down cash flexes down.

[62:40] Those are all lagging indicators. You can't if I looked at you and said, increase revenue,

[62:43] you can't do anything. If I said decrease, sure, you can't do anything with that. You would then

[62:47] have to do something else. And then the result would be a decrease in turn. The result would be more

[62:50] revenue. The result would be more sales. And so we have to do, we have to identify what all those steps

[62:55] are that are high correlates or increase the likelihood that ultimate outcome occurs. And if you

[63:01] liked these growth principles, you're absolutely going to love the 13 years of marketing

[63:05] lessons that I've learned from my top videos, enjoy it.

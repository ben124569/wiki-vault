[00:00] What's going on everyone?

[00:01] Happy Sunday.

[00:02] This is coming from downtown Austin.

[00:05] Wanted to talk to you about one of the most profound belief

[00:08] and perspective shifts that I've had over the last few years.

[00:11] And I think 2020 was that year for me,

[00:13] where I made one of the most profound internal shifts.

[00:16] And the shift has yielded me unbelievable amounts

[00:20] of decreases in anxiety for me.

[00:23] And honestly, just increases my increased my level of certainty.

[00:27] And I can understand why so many people fail

[00:30] to a much higher degree.

[00:31] And I think one of the biggest curses that I had earlier

[00:34] on in my career is that within months,

[00:39] I went from, it's just everything kind of aligned for me,

[00:44] mind you after five years of eating shit.

[00:47] But nonetheless, things did align for me.

[00:50] And very rapidly went to, from making

[00:53] not a lot of money to millions of dollars a year in profit,

[00:57] to my second year doing almost $20 million in profit.

[01:03] And that fundamentally, I think ruined me in a lot of ways

[01:07] early, wrong, because I saw that as my benchmark.

[01:12] You know what I mean?

[01:13] I saw that as like if a business is not doing this,

[01:15] then it's failing, we're doing something wrong.

[01:17] And I think that it was a really poisonous viewpoint

[01:20] for me, our toxic viewpoint.

[01:22] And I want to share with you what I've shifted to,

[01:26] and what has been such a dramatic improvement in my life,

[01:28] and I think my business.

[01:30] So when I look at investors and people make a lot more money

[01:32] than me and people have much bigger businesses than me,

[01:35] I see this common thread of looking at

[01:39] it from an investor's time horizon.

[01:41] And so I feel like an entrepreneurship,

[01:42] everything's about tomorrow, everything's about this week,

[01:44] everything's about this month and making pay roll.

[01:46] And all the day to day things.

[01:48] But you get so caught in the monthly goals

[01:52] and weekly goals that you forget to make

[01:56] the long-term investments that are important and not urgent.

[02:00] And when I look at the billionaires of the world,

[02:01] and all of them are trying to build escape paths to Mars,

[02:05] to me, I see that I'm sure there's the cool factor,

[02:07] but the fact that they're all kind of thinking about the stuff

[02:10] just leads me to think that they're thinking

[02:12] on such a larger time horizon than the rest of humanity,

[02:14] which is probably one of the reasons

[02:16] that they're more successful.

[02:17] And one of the things to think about this

[02:20] is kind of fast versus inevitable.

[02:23] And I have tried to shift my perspective

[02:26] to wanting to do tasks and actions on a repeated basis

[02:30] that I know that if I repeat them over a long enough time horizon,

[02:34] will lead me to inevitably accomplishing my goal.

[02:38] And so it would it does by shifting that way

[02:41] as I look at tasks, I look at projects,

[02:43] I look at initiatives in a very different light.

[02:46] I also, I mean, I wasn't super affected

[02:49] by competition in general mentally

[02:51] because of other things,

[02:53] but I think this has been probably the last nail

[02:55] on the coffin for me in terms of like,

[02:57] well, so and so is making more or whatever, right?

[03:00] The things that we do to compare ourselves.

[03:02] If you remove the time horizon and think of not next year,

[03:06] but maybe next decade, right?

[03:08] I've been using five years

[03:10] because that is a timeline that I feel like

[03:11] I can wrap my head around and it's real for me.

[03:14] I had a mentor retail to me and he was like,

[03:16] and this guy sold his thing for three point four billion.

[03:20] He's like, bro, you need a hundred year timeline.

[03:22] And I took that in, I accept that.

[03:25] But it's not real for me yet.

[03:27] And so five years is something that is real for me

[03:30] that I can believe in.

[03:31] And so what that does is,

[03:35] if you think about time as an inevitable force

[03:37] that's going to move forward one way or another,

[03:40] think about for a second how, and this is for me,

[03:44] do I see time as a threat?

[03:47] Do I see time as a liability?

[03:48] Something that I'm always saying is working against me?

[03:52] Or is time an asset that is working for me?

[03:56] And I think this has been the single greatest shift

[03:58] in perspective for me is now seeing,

[04:01] if I extend my time horizon,

[04:03] then time stops being a liability and a threat

[04:06] and becomes an asset.

[04:08] And how things compound over time

[04:10] now works to assist me rather than hinder me.

[04:14] And so I'll give you a simple example.

[04:16] So I have never believed in SEO, right,

[04:20] or really even inbound marketing.

[04:22] And I have had a major shift in perspective on this,

[04:27] probably in the last 12 months.

[04:29] And the reason for that is because,

[04:32] you know, if you're first 12 months of doing SEO,

[04:37] and I'm saying that as a general, as a catch-all,

[04:38] so I'm really just any inbound marketing,

[04:40] and that is not paid advertising that results in people,

[04:43] because that's technically kind of still outbound, right?

[04:45] You're putting ads out there and then getting people to respond

[04:48] rather than basically pull-based marketing,

[04:50] where you're creating a waterhole for people to come towards, right?

[04:54] And so I've never really invested much thought into inbound stuff

[04:58] at all.

[04:59] I mean, the only example of that is really this kind of log slash podcast,

[05:02] which I never did for a really any business purposes,

[05:05] is just more for me to document my journey.

[05:08] But nonetheless, thinking about this

[05:12] in terms of that perspective of,

[05:14] and I've been talking to people who are like,

[05:16] oh yeah, we have this, you know,

[05:17] it's taking us five years to build this asset,

[05:19] but now this asset creates 3000 applications month

[05:22] for our software or for our whatever, right?

[05:26] And I think it might be something like,

[05:28] man, just building a machine that just consistently,

[05:32] month over month creates more and more and more inbound interests

[05:39] is just wildly compelling to me.

[05:41] And so I think to myself, okay, sure,

[05:43] we're gonna have our outbound things,

[05:44] both outbound in terms of manual outbound with people,

[05:47] cold call, cold email, et cetera, you know, cold DM,

[05:49] but also we have our outbound with paid advertising

[05:52] across platforms.

[05:53] But the kind of the third piece of this is,

[05:56] what can we quote invest in that, if I did it over five years,

[06:01] I believe it would be unreasonable for me

[06:03] to not have built another channel that is reliable

[06:08] and sustainable and enduring.

[06:10] And so you'll probably see some more things for me

[06:12] in the next 12 months along that line

[06:16] because I think it's really awesome.

[06:18] And I wanna use compound growth to my advantage

[06:22] rather than as a hindrance,

[06:23] rather than as something that I compare myself to

[06:25] and feel always inadequate.

[06:27] And so what I think that the shift from the CEO

[06:30] to investor mindset is help me with is the stress

[06:34] that I put on myself for like quarterly goals

[06:38] and looking at someone else who might have started

[06:40] at the same time as me and is doing better than me.

[06:42] Because then I get to think to myself, okay,

[06:45] but we're not comparing ourselves.

[06:48] Now we're comparing ourselves to what's gonna happen

[06:51] in 20 years, right?

[06:52] Will their company still be here?

[06:54] And I'm trying to build something that endures that lasts,

[06:57] that maybe even can be passed on to a future

[06:59] generation.

[07:00] And I don't think those were ever thoughts of mine

[07:02] when I was starting my entrepreneurial career

[07:04] and I wish they had been.

[07:05] And so I don't know where you're at right now,

[07:07] but maybe if you can take that perspective

[07:09] and think to yourself, what could I create that?

[07:12] And what tasks should I do?

[07:14] What projects could I invest in that?

[07:16] Even if they don't pay off this quarter or next quarter,

[07:18] even the next 12 months,

[07:20] I think that it would be inevitable

[07:22] that I would have a disproportionate pay off five years from now.

[07:25] And obviously that begins the obvious,

[07:27] you know, the single greatest constraint

[07:29] that most people have,

[07:30] which is they can't do anything consistently.

[07:31] But I believe I can do things consistently

[07:34] and I think that many of the people

[07:35] listening to this can do things consistently.

[07:37] And so if you have that character trailer,

[07:39] you've developed that discipline.

[07:40] I feel like using that discipline

[07:42] to invest in things that are going to create

[07:44] disproportionate returns is a good use of time, right?

[07:49] For us, and so I'll give you a real example

[07:51] around this.

[07:53] We're looking at doing an initiative

[07:56] on the gym lunch and our gym lunch company

[07:58] related to just generating more, you know,

[08:00] inbound applications and whatnot.

[08:02] And I was talking to our GM about it

[08:05] and I was saying, listen, let's not think about that

[08:07] for like this quarter.

[08:09] I mean, we can start now,

[08:10] but let's not measure the ROI until, you know, next year.

[08:14] And I don't think I would ever have said something

[08:17] like that a year or two ago.

[08:19] I don't even think I would even even be a thought.

[08:22] But it's been wildly freeing

[08:24] because there's so much less pressure around initiatives

[08:28] and I think it actually improves the quality

[08:30] of the initiative and the execution of the team

[08:32] because they're not immediately being like,

[08:34] oh, it's been a week and it's not working,

[08:35] so we're failing, right?

[08:37] And so let me give you another really good nugget

[08:40] that I've had recently around this, which is

[08:46] rather than looking at week over week,

[08:48] month of a month sales growth.

[08:51] Instead, I asked myself the question,

[08:55] what one thing, if I tripled it in our company,

[08:59] what non-sales relate it?

[09:00] What non-revenue related thing,

[09:02] that if I were to tripled it,

[09:04] it would be unreasonable to believe

[09:06] that my company would not tripled as well.

[09:09] And for me, that was inbound qualified,

[09:11] or I'm saying about, but just number of qualified

[09:14] applications generated.

[09:15] That was a metric that I was like, okay,

[09:18] sometimes when you're increasing the number of applications

[09:20] that are coming in, you have a new salesperson

[09:23] or new sales team and they're closer at his low.

[09:27] It happens, right?

[09:28] It's part of scaling a business.

[09:30] But over a long enough time horizon,

[09:32] it would be unreasonable for me to believe

[09:33] that if I were to triple my number of applications,

[09:37] I would not see a proportional increase in sales.

[09:42] And so what's interesting to me is that if I can,

[09:45] I've never actually thought about a leading indicator,

[09:47] because I've leading indicators on churn,

[09:49] which is like customer activation,

[09:50] and I talk about that and other stuff.

[09:52] But I've never actually had a leading indicator on growth,

[09:55] which is fascinating to me that I've never had this,

[09:57] which is like hilarious.

[10:00] But actually measuring the number of sales accepted leads,

[10:03] and so that's defined as a lead that the sales team accepts

[10:07] because they showed an arc qualified, right?

[10:09] They are the type of person who we can serve,

[10:13] you know, they have the size business that we work with,

[10:15] you know, and they showed up and they have interest, right?

[10:17] So that would be a sales qualified lead.

[10:20] And so trying to say, I want to increase sales by 5% a month

[10:24] is a fine goal.

[10:26] The thing is is that there are so many other variables

[10:28] that can affect it in a short time horizon like that.

[10:31] Whereas saying I want to increase our number of inbound

[10:34] applications by 5% per month is far more consistent

[10:40] and reasonable to do.

[10:41] And so if you thought about like a line, right?

[10:43] If I know that I can increase

[10:45] through consistent activity, the number of inbound applications

[10:48] either through adding more people to outreach,

[10:51] creating more channels for content.

[10:54] And then obviously there's the paid side,

[10:56] which is you can add another platform, et cetera, right?

[10:58] And so if I draw that line, that is something

[11:02] I can consistently do.

[11:04] And so when I'm thinking about growing my business

[11:07] and hitting a goal like tripling it in the next five years,

[11:11] and I think okay, well then let's take our sales

[11:15] call off sales qualified leads, right?

[11:17] And let's draw that as our line,

[11:19] and that's going to be our baseline, right?

[11:21] That's what we're going to focus all our attention on.

[11:23] The day-to-day activities around that,

[11:25] those are going to be like the stock market, right?

[11:27] They're going to be up and down up and down up and down.

[11:29] And I think most of us are looking at

[11:30] such small time horizons, it looks crazy.

[11:32] But if you look at it from an investor's perspective

[11:35] in terms of years or decades, then you can really see the truth.

[11:39] And the reason that a stock will go up over a decade

[11:41] is simply because of the true economic value

[11:44] that a company is providing, right?

[11:46] And so for me, a leading indicator of growth

[11:48] would be the number of interested inquiries that we get.

[11:51] And so that is actually going to be my primary predictive metric

[11:55] that I will be driving, because I know that, of course,

[11:59] we're going to change processes.

[12:00] Sure, we might change CRMs.

[12:02] You know, we might change our funnel RSS.

[12:04] Like all these things are small things.

[12:06] But if I can simply increase the number of qualified applications

[12:10] of people who want to, for example, grow their gym,

[12:15] by three X in the next five years,

[12:17] then I can reasonably believe that I would be able to achieve it.

[12:20] And thinking that way has just been amazing.

[12:23] And so that is what I'm dedicated to doing.

[12:25] And some of these smaller projects, which for me were like,

[12:28] well, this thing is going to double our lead gen,

[12:30] so I don't want to do it.

[12:32] I've really shifted my perspective on that.

[12:34] And so I'm now looking at reliable inflows.

[12:39] It's like, OK, why think this one thing can generate us 20 new clients a month?

[12:43] That's not huge for us, but it's noticeable.

[12:48] And so OK, well, then how much does it take to invest in that?

[12:52] How long do it, and let's start it.

[12:54] Let's start this snowball.

[12:57] And so that's one of the, that's what I was talking about,

[12:59] Jam about.

[12:59] And so we're actually going to do this initiative.

[13:01] That I think what results in about 20 new clients a month,

[13:04] then it's going to take us time to get there.

[13:06] But I think it's going to be really, really valuable for us, right?

[13:09] Over the long haul, especially.

[13:11] And so let me just take a quick look at my notes,

[13:13] because I wanted to make sure I'm not missing anything for you.

[13:17] Do-do-do.

[13:23] Yeah.

[13:25] I think that's, I think that's my biggest thing, right?

[13:29] That's pretty much my message for what my biggest perspective shift

[13:32] has been, is thinking about a five-year time horizon,

[13:36] shifting from CEO to shareholder,

[13:38] shift from CEO to board member or advisor,

[13:43] and thinking about it over those time horizons.

[13:44] And I feel like if you can just make that change,

[13:47] I wish I could explain to you how much less stress I have,

[13:51] because if, you know, the company goes up by a little bit

[13:53] or down by a little bit one month or another month,

[13:55] it just doesn't affect me.

[13:58] Like it doesn't affect my life in any way.

[14:00] And I feel like I had my ego, so,

[14:02] and this is actually the last point that I had on my notes,

[14:04] which is my ego is just so much less impacted

[14:09] by the fluctuations of the business

[14:11] that it's just, it's just phenomenally increased

[14:13] my standard of living.

[14:14] Like I'm just, I'm just really not that stressed about things.

[14:18] You know, I just can't even express it to you.

[14:20] And so, anyways, this has been probably the biggest lesson

[14:23] of 2020 for me.

[14:24] And obviously 2020 for us was,

[14:26] we, our profit was cut in half, we did.

[14:30] I think 13.4 and profit last year

[14:32] and we did, I think, six, six this year

[14:34] we're getting in a final box,

[14:35] but around that this year, in profit,

[14:36] which was technically my lowest year of profit in a while.

[14:40] And, but I can truthfully tell you,

[14:43] it's just really doesn't affect me

[14:44] because I know it's a momentary business disruption,

[14:46] because of a pandemic that disproportionately affected

[14:50] my clients than many other industries.

[14:53] And I don't think it would be unreasonable

[14:55] for me to believe that over the next three years, right?

[14:57] That we would not only recover,

[14:59] but go past where we were before.

[15:01] And so, in thinking about that, anyways,

[15:04] I just, it's been, it's just viewing time

[15:07] as an ally and not an ally or an asset,

[15:10] not a threat or a liability.

[15:12] And once you can, when I can hitch my cart

[15:15] to something that is inevitable,

[15:16] like the passing of time,

[15:19] then I feel like you're aligned with forces

[15:22] that will grow you without your permission.

[15:25] And so anyways, I'll leave you with that.

[15:26] I hope you have an amazing day

[15:27] and keep being awesome.

[15:29] Catch you on the full side.

[15:30] Bye.

[00:00] In this video, what I want to talk to you about is how we, two and a half

[00:03] x, the lifetime value of our physical products business by adding in recurring revenue.

[00:10] For most businesses, small or large, adding in recurring revenue is going to be the

[00:14] single greatest way to increase your enterprise value.

[00:17] And so I've been doing a really deep dive on this just thinking through it, because I'm

[00:20] trying to create a checklist for my own portfolio companies, I'm trying to just figure

[00:24] out what I would share with you.

[00:25] And so going through this deep dive, the first thing I want to do is kind of challenge one

[00:28] of the original thoughts that I think comes up all the time is I don't have recurring

[00:31] revenue, I'm not a recurring revenue business, et cetera.

[00:34] And I think that that is binary thinking, which is either our recurring revenue business

[00:38] or you are not our recurring revenue business.

[00:39] When in reality is, to what extent are you recurring revenue business?

[00:42] How recurring is your business?

[00:44] Is it better question?

[00:45] And so after thinking about it for almost a few hours this morning, I was writing down in my

[00:50] lovely iPad here, my ideas around recurring revenue.

[00:54] And there are eight C's, because I'm trying to make this memorable for myself too, that

[01:00] you can implement to make your recurring revenue more sticky.

[01:04] And so just as a quick side note or tangent on this before we dive in, it doesn't matter

[01:08] what type of business you're in.

[01:10] There's always an extent to which you can become a more recurring revenue business.

[01:14] So a typical example that I'll get in this instance is someone's like, well, I'm in real

[01:17] estate, there's nothing recurring about my business, which is so silly, it just means

[01:21] that you have a very limited time horizon.

[01:24] And the question is, one, if you're a realtor, you absolutely have recurring revenue

[01:28] business, because you want to have the lifetime value of the customer in every single house

[01:30] they buy in cell, right?

[01:32] Right.

[01:33] Even if you were selling houses for example, who else is serving for recurring revenue?

[01:36] It's not the house.

[01:37] The bank is consistently giving you loan after a loan after a loan.

[01:40] What you're really buying is a mortgage, right?

[01:42] Not the house.

[01:43] It's secured by that.

[01:44] So you're getting a loan for money, which is secured against the house.

[01:47] It's not actually the house itself.

[01:48] So it's the bank and the real estate agent and the escrow company, those are the companies

[01:52] that are generating a recurring revenue from this quote, single transaction, right?

[01:55] But they're hoping that you continue to visit them over and over again.

[01:57] I just wanted to make that shift for anyone.

[01:59] If you're in the car repair business, right, like, and you have an auto shop, of course,

[02:02] you would have recurring revenue.

[02:04] Every business on a long-time horizon is recurring if done properly, right?

[02:07] And you can either choose to make it more recurring or less recurring.

[02:11] And so the purpose of this video is to show you how to increase the stickiness, increase

[02:15] the recurring nature of the services and products and or access that you sell within your

[02:21] company.

[02:22] And I'm doing this within, again, my own portfolio companies.

[02:25] And so I'm doing this because I want to share these frameworks with you.

[02:28] So the first of these and this maybe the most obvious is consumption, right?

[02:32] The goal to increase the stickiness of recurring revenue is to increase the consumption.

[02:37] And you can think about this from a physical standpoint, which you can see physical here.

[02:41] I'll see if I'm a little a little small.

[02:43] So she said deal with it.

[02:44] But consumption, right?

[02:45] The goal is like, if we can get someone to eat the food that we're making every single

[02:48] month, they're going to want to buy more of it if it is good.

[02:50] So the same degree, Netflix has a recurring revenue business.

[02:53] And it's not like they have contracts or anything like that.

[02:55] But it is purely based on consumption.

[02:57] You want to continue to consume the things that they put out and so you continue to pay.

[03:02] And so Spotify again, you want to continue to consume the music and so you pay.

[03:08] Now the cool thing is that if we're still thinking along this binary versus continue

[03:12] I'm thinking process, it is not, do I get my people to consume the product?

[03:17] But it is how well do I get people to consume the product?

[03:20] And so for each of these eight seas that I'm about to go through, don't think is it a

[03:24] checkbox of yes or no, but instead to what extent do I do this?

[03:28] And the idea is not that you want to have all eight, I mean it would be magical if you had

[03:32] all eight.

[03:33] But if you can easily think through each of these seas as ways that you can bolster

[03:37] or make your business more recurring than it was before, and each of these individuals

[03:43] you can do better or worse.

[03:44] So you have, you have continuums within continuums.

[03:47] And that sounds complex and that's why we like to use the psychological binary or

[03:51] short-hand of yes or no, but reality is not nearly as simple.

[03:55] So the first of these is how can we get someone to increase the consumption of our product

[03:59] and services?

[04:00] And so that creates that means going through creating better onboarding experiences and

[04:03] improving the actual value of the product itself, making it more addictive in nature,

[04:07] etc.

[04:08] So somebody wants to continue to consume it.

[04:10] The second of these is collateral.

[04:12] So is there, is there any way that we can secure our recurring revenue against something

[04:20] else?

[04:21] So give you two examples.

[04:22] In the physical world, if you go to storage, they have your physical goods.

[04:26] They have your stuff.

[04:27] So you must continue to pay because they have your stuff.

[04:30] It's a secured continuity, straight.

[04:33] A different way in the digital world, Dropbox is storage.

[04:37] They just have your files and they have your stuff.

[04:40] Google Drive is storage.

[04:42] And there's different types of collateral.

[04:43] So the idea for us as entrepreneurs is how else can we create collateral either physical

[04:47] or digital that makes that we can secure against this continuity.

[04:52] So people want to continue to stay in pay.

[04:53] A different version of this would be like a CRM.

[04:56] CRM has all of your contacts and all of those, all the contacts, all their information,

[05:01] etc.

[05:02] They are now holding and they're holding, I don't want to say, hostage, but they are

[05:05] relatively holding hostage from you so that you continue to stay.

[05:08] So that is a second way that we're going to increase the stickiness of the continuity

[05:12] that we are making.

[05:13] The next is cost of switching.

[05:16] So this is a lot, someone to do with psychology, which you have the time cost, sorry,

[05:21] the time cost of switching, which is like it might be very arduous or lots of effort to

[05:25] switch over providers of x, y, and z.

[05:29] And or it might cost you a lot of money to do that.

[05:32] You can even further increase this psychological bias in your favor by increasing the

[05:37] sunk cost fallacy on your prospect.

[05:40] So a way of doing this, for example, would be if I were selling a $100 month continuity,

[05:44] if I told someone that they had to spend $5,000 one time to begin working with me, and

[05:48] then it was $100 a month, the likely that they would cancel would be significantly lower.

[05:52] I talked about this briefly inside the $100 dollar offer's book, which is the bigger

[05:55] that had the longer the tail.

[05:57] If you have a really big up front, it makes it much easier to drive the recurring on

[06:01] the back end and so the stickier it will be.

[06:03] And so you can make that in terms of fees, you can make that in terms of time, money

[06:06] investment, basically the harder to get into something, the psychological bias against

[06:10] the harder it will be to get out.

[06:11] So the cost of switching will increase the stickiness of the recurring revenue that you

[06:15] have for physical products or services.

[06:17] The next is choice.

[06:19] So the idea here is the lack of choices.

[06:21] So if I had, if I were the only x, y, z, z, servicer, provider on an island, I may have

[06:27] a lot of stickiness to my business because there are no competitors.

[06:30] Now that may be short lived to someone else sees what I am doing and sees the opportunity,

[06:36] but the idea, you know, patents are a way to decrease the choice that consumers have for

[06:42] alternatives.

[06:43] If you're the only one who holds this patent for this medical drug, then they have to continue

[06:47] to buy from you over and over again.

[06:48] You can argue the ethics around it, but that's not the point of this channel.

[06:51] The point of this channel is simply just showing the economics behind the business model.

[06:55] So if there are ways that we can decrease the alternatives that someone can have because

[06:59] we have a unique competitive process or a trade secret that allows us to do something

[07:03] differently or better than everyone else.

[07:05] And fundamentally, this is the point of differentiation in and of itself.

[07:08] It's to decrease the alternative to decrease the choices someone has.

[07:11] If you are the absolute best at x, y, z, there might not be a choice of anyone else who

[07:17] can do what you can do.

[07:18] This is also the reason that stitching down is so valuable for many businesses, especially

[07:22] they're starting out because there might not be anyone else who will have their unique

[07:25] combination of skills, resources, et cetera to provide the value in the way that they do.

[07:30] So our idea to create a stickier business, to have more recurring customers to have

[07:34] more recurring revenue, is to decrease the other alternatives, right?

[07:37] Either through directly with patents, you know, indirectly by having no one else on the island

[07:42] or by having some sort of competitive advantage that we have that no one else has, right?

[07:45] Tracer because of some kind of.

[07:46] The fourth is control of the money flow.

[07:49] This one is one that I added near the end because I was thinking through it and I was

[07:51] like, what else is really sticky?

[07:53] What else makes recurring revenue sticky?

[07:55] And one of the ways is, candidly, a lack of transparency.

[07:57] And what I mean by that is, you know, Uber, you know, for example, they're going to take

[08:01] their fee before they pay.

[08:02] You know, the government takes their fee, which is your taxes if you're an employee before

[08:08] you pay, which is why most employees don't have nearly the same gripe with taxes as

[08:12] most business owners because the business owners see the checks that are coming out of

[08:15] your month or as many of the employees do not, they just see the end result of the money.

[08:18] I'm not saying that no employees don't have issues with taxes.

[08:20] That's not my point here.

[08:21] I'm just saying that if we're talking about to what extent or a degree on a continuum,

[08:26] the more overt the charges are rather than covert or before someone can see it or without

[08:31] them seeing it, then the stickier it is because they are less noticing of the fee or

[08:36] charge.

[08:37] And again, my argument here is not the ethics behind this.

[08:40] It's simply that this is something that the more a business or recurring revenue

[08:44] stream has this nature embedded within it, then the stickier it will be in general.

[08:49] All right?

[08:50] Because again, all of these are continuums within the larger continuum of how sticky

[08:54] or how recurring is your business, not whether your business is recurring or not.

[08:59] And so we want to take more and more steps along each of these continuum to overall

[09:02] bolster the recurring revenue nature of our business.

[09:05] All right?

[09:07] The next one is cause.

[09:09] All right?

[09:10] And what I mean by that is, are people aligned with the cause that we are, that we are,

[09:14] we are standing for.

[09:16] So churches have recurring revenue.

[09:18] People pay 10% they tie towards the church, right?

[09:21] And so if people are aligned with the cause, then they will continue to pay because

[09:25] they're getting value because they associate their identity with that cause.

[09:28] All right?

[09:29] This is why building movements within businesses are so valuable because then we can act

[09:34] and function far more like a church can in the fact that people will associate their

[09:39] identities with the cause and continue to pay because of who they are.

[09:44] And because of what they believe that the cause represents charity.

[09:47] There are some people who continue to give over and over again, even though the benefit

[09:50] that they're getting, because there is still a product of charity.

[09:53] The product is the feeling that people will get when they pay because they feel good

[09:56] about themselves.

[09:57] And so if we have this nature within, if we can embed this nature within our recurring

[10:02] revenue stream, then we will make it stickier, right?

[10:05] People donate to political parties every single year that is a recurring commitment

[10:09] that many people do.

[10:10] People continue to frequent the same brands because they believe the brands stands for

[10:13] something that they too believe in, right?

[10:16] And so this is kind of the more amorphous or vague part of it, but still very, very real

[10:20] in terms of how you can create stickier recurring revenue.

[10:22] All right?

[10:23] The next one is community, all right?

[10:26] And this one I was really, really, hasn't because I almost put it in with cause,

[10:29] but it felt different enough that I felt like I should pull it out.

[10:32] But people will continue to pay for things if they feel like they're becoming a part

[10:36] of a community and they would have to sacrifice their identity.

[10:38] So you'll notice between causing community, they're both related to the identity that someone

[10:43] has which is they're going to be, it's commitment and consistency.

[10:46] They're going to continue to be consistent with what they believe to be their identity

[10:52] because people don't like to be inconsistent with who they are.

[10:54] And so if they believe they identify as being a part of a community, then they will continue

[10:58] to want to pay for that community.

[11:01] The next one is contracts that are enforceable.

[11:04] So by and large, I'm not the biggest fan of contracts.

[11:06] I mean, obviously we lawyer up and we have all of our legal resources and that's a necessary,

[11:11] you know, part of doing business.

[11:14] But having contracts in and of themselves can increase the stickiness.

[11:18] So I'll give you a simple example.

[11:19] So if I said I have a $2,000 month continuity, whatever, right?

[11:22] And you can just pay as you go, right?

[11:25] That will probably net me if I were to have two things that were equal in value that I'm

[11:29] providing, right?

[11:30] $2,000 month.

[11:31] Someone signed up, let's say, for a six month contract at $2,000 a month.

[11:35] Or what I would say, a $12,000 program that has six payments of $2,000.

[11:40] Now if I know that my recurring revenue stream as a month to month version, only has,

[11:45] let's say, four months of stick, if I can sell this as a $12,000 package, the likely that

[11:50] I get that extra one or two months is high.

[11:52] And so I'm saying just if two products and services are identical, but we pack it to them

[11:56] differently.

[11:57] The one that is sold with a contract against a total value will likely be stickier

[12:02] because people are committing to a certain period of time.

[12:04] And so if we have contracts that are enforced, that is just one way of me in contract

[12:07] enforceable.

[12:08] Another way of making contract enforceable.

[12:09] This is somewhat a degree of collateral, which is someone has a credit worthy, right?

[12:13] They can ding their credit if they breach their contract, right?

[12:17] So you do have some sort of collateral, which is kind of the nature of making contracts.

[12:20] Tiki is that you want to have some collateral.

[12:22] But I felt that this was different enough, especially with the example of charging $12,000

[12:26] for six times two, versus a month to month of $2,000 a month.

[12:31] You may end up getting more people to pay and stay longer simply by positioning it

[12:36] as a six month agreement that then goes month to month after the six months, right?

[12:40] And so just by making that tiny change in terms of how we're positioning, we might be able

[12:43] to increase our LTV or probably left-hand growth profit by two or three acts simply by

[12:47] making that one change.

[12:48] All right, which is a massive improvement for a business.

[12:51] And so just another way that you can think of how can I make my recurring revenue stickier,

[12:54] a how can I make my business more recurring?

[12:56] I'll do a quick recap for you.

[12:58] The eight seas of recurring revenue and our goal here is to think of this as a continuum checklist,

[13:03] which is if I'm looking at my service, how can I make it, how can I get people to consume

[13:07] more of it, right?

[13:08] How can I make it more valuable?

[13:10] How can I make it easier to use?

[13:12] How can I make it so people want to use this over and over and over and over again?

[13:15] Number one, number two, how can I increase the collateral that they have when they do

[13:18] business with me so that they can't leave because I have something that is secured against

[13:22] it, right?

[13:23] It's secured against their recurring fee that's coming over and over again.

[13:27] How can I increase the cost of switching?

[13:29] So how difficult and time money or sunk cost or perceived time or perceived money can I make

[13:33] it so people do not want to switch?

[13:35] Next, how can I enter a marketplace where there's fewer choices or how can I increase

[13:39] my competitive advantage by making trademarks IP trade secrets or continue to invest in

[13:45] a product so that no one else can deliver what I can deliver.

[13:47] This is kind of the competitive mode that Warren Buffett talks about.

[13:50] The controlling of the money flow is there a way that we can figure out how to get paid first

[13:54] or get paid off the top or somehow tie it so that our fees are less overt.

[14:00] Again, I'm not talking about the ethics behind it.

[14:02] I'm simply talking about the efficaciousness, right?

[14:05] The efficacy of this way of doing and increasing the stickiness of it.

[14:09] Next, how can we create a cause that we are aligned with so people can identify with

[14:12] what we are which is they buy shoes from us, not just for the shoes but for the cause

[14:17] that they identify with in addition to, right, the classic Tom Shoes example.

[14:22] How can we increase the community?

[14:23] Not like, yes, I have a community check.

[14:25] We've already got that taken care of.

[14:26] But how many more ways can we strengthen and tie the community together so that people

[14:31] feel like they're leaving a community not a business which is much harder and then

[14:35] instead of doing make our revenue stickier.

[14:37] And then finally, how can we make contracts that are enforceable?

[14:40] Part of that is going to be selling to better or higher quality prospects but also again,

[14:44] having something that we can collateralize the contract against.

[14:48] And even, simply making people agree to a certain amount of people are going to in general

[14:54] be more consistent with the commitment that they make.

[14:57] If they say they're going to stay for six months, you will have more people stay for

[15:01] six months if they at least say they're going to stay for six months.

[15:03] Even if not all of them do.

[15:05] You'll still have more people stay than what otherwise do that.

[15:08] Now that may be harder on the sale and this is part of business is balancing those things.

[15:11] I hope this made sense for you in terms of how I think through recurring revenue in the

[15:15] business, how we can increase the recurring nature of our business because again, this

[15:19] is not the binary of Ivan recurring versus a non-recurring business.

[15:22] It is to what extent is my business recurring.

[15:24] I'm going to try to get into what extent am I checking off each of these boxes that we just

[15:27] went over.

[15:28] So there's the eight seas are recurring nature recurring revenue as I know them.

[15:30] Put any other ones that you can think of if you think that there's something totally

[15:33] different or if you think there's examples that tie into any of these seas throw them

[15:38] in there, I think it'll be a good lively discussion.

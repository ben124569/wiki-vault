[00:00] Good morning everyone. I have one day hope you guys are had a good restful weekend or maybe not hope you were not resting at all

[00:05] To selling tons of people on a road finish over the weekend and hopefully you were

[00:10] But if you were not then this message is for you

[00:13] Some calling this deal shit moment. I was having a conversation with a friend of mine

[00:17] Who's in the same space as us and he was talking to me about some of the beliefs that he's getting over the phone

[00:24] Some of the gym owners that he's talking to etc and it was kind of interesting

[00:29] Because you were saying that you know these things changed week to week

[00:32] But he said right now everyone's in denial phase. He said right now they're in the phase of

[00:37] I'm gonna hold out. I think I can wait a couple more weeks

[00:41] For this to be over and I guess I'm here to say that I don't think that's gonna work out for you

[00:48] And here's here's why I don't think sitting and waiting is going to work out for you and hoping that

[00:55] When you open your gym, it's gonna work out

[00:57] I'm calling this the ocean moment because right now

[01:00] I think that there's still a certain sense of hope right

[01:04] I think that when they turn the lights back on when they turn the economy back on when they let gyms back

[01:08] Which by the way will be last but when they let us go back to business and open our doors

[01:14] You're going to open your doors. I think a lot a lot fewer people are gonna come back than you think

[01:20] And I think that what's gonna happen is gonna be a slower recovery than most people anticipate because people are still weary etc

[01:27] And I think some people will just like always

[01:31] Like there's a reason the on-demand economy is the on-demand economy right everyone thought that

[01:36] That people I was literally is so funny. I had an internet troll yesterday or two days ago

[01:40] Who comment on an ad and who does just saying stupid things like stupid like trying to be smart but saying stupid things

[01:47] And he was like as soon as online fitness as soon as the gyms went back up all this online fitness stuff is gonna go away

[01:52] And I was like

[01:53] Really you think that people are just going to choose a less convenient option after they come back is like well

[01:59] People really value the in person, you know blah blah blah blah

[02:02] right

[02:03] People said the exact same thing about blockbuster against

[02:09] Netflix

[02:10] They're like the CEO is a blockbuster because it's so easy to rationalize our

[02:15] Like human beings don't want to think of back-case scenarios and so we rationalize that we don't need to change right and so

[02:21] Blockbuster executives when they're like hey, or you can start about this online streaming stuff

[02:25] They were like no people always value

[02:28] Making in night making in evening

[02:31] Going and picking it, you know picking out their movie walking inside and getting their candy like it's become an experience

[02:37] And so we think that people will continue to value this experience

[02:40] Guess what they were fucking wrong people would rather just click on the couch and do nothing right is the experience of

[02:46] Being at your couch

[02:48] Better than the experience of shopping at blockbuster. I would say no. I I really miss blockbuster a lot of times

[02:53] But I didn't miss enough to not use Netflix or use Netflix way more

[02:57] Right and so the reality is that people will always choose their convenience and I think what happened very like recently or currently right now is that

[03:04] A huge piece of the marketplace that never otherwise would have tried online training or

[03:10] Maybe would have in the next decade

[03:12] It took all of the remote services and dropped

[03:15] Directed ten years into the future in terms of mass adoption. It was forced adoption all right

[03:19] And so I think a large percentage of people are going to say a larger than most Jim owners anticipate are gonna stay in a remote setting

[03:26] Right I think a lot of people are still like their jobs

[03:30] Here's the others ocean moment is that people some of the companies that did layoffs may not rehire everyone

[03:35] Right because the demand is not gonna be what it was at the single greatest moment in economic history

[03:40] It would be like the best economy ever that happened before this and so

[03:45] Just like the ocean moment is going to be when you turn the lights on and people don't show up

[03:50] Right which

[03:51] Transparently will be great for me because I'm just gonna mark the shit out of the gyms that want to work with us because like

[03:56] That will be when marketing is more important than ever because you're going to have to differentiate and get your name out there more than anyone else is right

[04:03] But

[04:04] Let's rewind the clock real quick. What do you need to do now?

[04:06] Right what do you need to do now because the ocean moment will come now?

[04:10] Some people have have stronger communities than others right and I always want to put my disclaimer for good

[04:15] Right if you're an amazing operator you haven't lost anyone then you'll probably recover better than people who have lost people right because you have a stronger community

[04:21] You have more blood and coaches you have better culture, et cetera, right?

[04:25] But what should you do now?

[04:27] So it is my belief and just looking at the math. I'm gonna do this big presentation for gym work so all right

[04:32] I did a huge statistical model looking at

[04:34] the difference between ROI on remote versus ROI in person and

[04:40] And the question is whether or not you want to be a business owner or a gym owner and that's a very real question like super super real

[04:47] That's a personal question, right?

[04:48] But if you're in this to maximize making money because I've had tons of gyms who flew out during our VIP days and said

[04:54] Alex want to make a million dollars a year and I said it's not gonna happen in one gym right now

[05:00] Talking heads of gurus will be like you can totally like show me the fucking bank statement

[05:04] All right and then I'll and then I'll believe you right but no

[05:07] I like it's not from one facility unless you have a massive

[05:10] Massive facility and typically group training

[05:13] First training set will be only a piece of a part of that right like if you have six thousand members paying

[05:18] $100 a month like lifetime then sure you can make a million dollars here right but most people didn't invest five million dollars into their build out

[05:24] So it's understanding relative scope, okay?

[05:27] So in my belief there's no way better than right now to for the best operators to be able to build a million dollar income business

[05:36] $234 million dollar top line business because

[05:40] One we're we're marketing a 25 mile radius and seeing zero degrees in sales percentages all right

[05:47] Number one number two our remote gyms right now are closing a higher percentage of leaves than they did in person

[05:53] That's a function of one major thing is that they're getting 40% of their leads onto it into a sales conversation compared to

[06:00] 20% you know whatever they were doing before all right

[06:04] So they have twice as many at bats and so even if they're not as good on the phone

[06:07] They're not twice as bad over the phone right and so they're a little if you look at right now

[06:11] The average closing percentage to 29% so they're closing 29% over the phone

[06:15] They were closing 42% in person all right, but if you get twice as many at bats you actually still net more sales

[06:21] And so number one you can have a bigger geographic radius so the many people that I've talked to is like

[06:26] I want to have a big impact here's how you have a big impact

[06:29] You can go remote and help people are not in your neighborhood

[06:32] Number two lead costs are cheaper not because of the ads the I add impressions and stuff because that's temporary

[06:38] Right, we've already seen it go back to normal so the ad the cost compression is has gone 100% back to more normal since

[06:44] two or three weeks ago all right people are advertising again

[06:48] But it's because when you draw from bigger radius you get cheaper leads that's just period if you run a

[06:53] An ad national answer says like

[06:55] Challenge or whatever you'll get you know 25% leads the issue is

[07:00] How do you create trust how do you create a sale or trust worthy environment for a lead?

[07:05] Too opt in and then buy something on the first phone call right and that's where having

[07:09] I would consider like the semi local appeal

[07:12] Automatically give you gives you one or two trust points in your direction which is allowing us to make sales on these first calls

[07:19] But if we're looking at it purely from a math perspective which I would urge you to be a business owner and on a gym owner for the moment

[07:25] Right now our guys are are essentially breaking even on the first transaction

[07:30] Right now they're used to making 213 to 141 et cetera on their first transaction right but

[07:37] You're limited by your your capacity to fill in terms of how many people you can have at each time

[07:43] You're limited by your lead flow because let's be real like lead flow of a 25 mile radius is is always gonna be higher and cheaper

[07:50] Then in a five mile radius because it's quadratic right so if you have a five mile radius and then you'd go from five to ten

[07:55] You didn't double the amount of people that you saw you pied it right so 3.14 or whatever the math is but it's based like

[08:01] Let me put in the layman's terms if you have a 12 inch pizza and you have a 24 inch pizza is not twice as big as a 12 inch pizza

[08:07] You fit like four 12 inch pieces inside of a 24 inch pizza because that's how circles work with with

[08:13] It's called quadratic expansion but anyways and so when you go to a 25 mile radius you're talking 10 times

[08:18] You know, I mean the amount of people that you would be reaching otherwise or 20 or 50 whatever the math is and so

[08:23] Because of that you can have a much bigger reach help more people can like anybody's ever struggled with lead flow

[08:30] That doesn't have to happen anymore like you don't have to struggle with lead flow anymore because it's literally

[08:34] Enormous and you pretty much can always get lead flow if your target is big enough all right and so putting all these things together

[08:41] cheaper leads bigger J graph of radius consistent lead generation a

[08:45] Consistent 11% of leads close

[08:47] Which is what we're seeing right now, which is higher than most people doing person breaking even on the front end and having 80%

[08:53] Gross margin on the back end like you're talking about spending, you know, right now

[08:58] If you spend $1500, you'll make $6,000 in front and revenue in 30 days

[09:02] That's what the math is right. That's the average right. That's the average

[09:06] Okay, $1500 that's 6600 is the actual number of up front cash in the first 30 days

[09:12] For an online business

[09:14] You know, many people have tried to start an online business. Do many online business gurus. There are and the reason they don't have an agency

[09:20] Set up or whatever is because they can't guarantee an outcome right they only tell the one or two testimonials that they have of the hundreds of students

[09:28] They have all right. I'm giving you the average numbers average

[09:33] average

[09:34] for online

[09:35] So if you wanted to make a six-figure income all right, which is 30 days to build a recurring revenue stream if you spent

[09:43] If you spent $1500 it would take if you spent $1500 in close 30

[09:48] 39 percent so let's just bump into making conservative so let's spend $2,200 in at spend over the first 30 days

[09:54] You'd be able to have 50 people in your online remote

[09:58] Business after you lost for you for percent for not going into continuity

[10:02] All right, so I'm accounting for that. They you only convert 60% into continuity at 200 bucks a month

[10:08] That's a $10,000 a month business

[10:10] Ramon you can do it in 30 days

[10:13] Like averages if you're average you can do it in 30 days right now

[10:18] And so the big question that you have to ask is one in my holding out

[10:22] For what's gonna happen that I don't know about because you don't know it's gonna have I don't either that's just my guess

[10:26] But like you don't know it's gonna happen

[10:28] But what I can tell you's the opportunity is there and so in the next 30 days in the next 60 days if you wanted to build your

[10:35] Selfie six-figure or multi six-figure online income you could do it

[10:39] I know that a lot of my gymlers won't do that. They're gonna go back to the gyms and that's fine

[10:43] I'm here to serve. I'm here to provide whatever value the community that I have asked for

[10:47] But if I were an uprising motherfucker, which I am I would be strongly considering this

[10:51] It has been very difficult for me to not throw my hat back into the ring and start signing fitness at large because when I see

[10:58] Those types of numbers in terms of acquisition I was like hmm

[11:02] How many salesguides we got I was like I wonder if I was like I wonder if there's a bunch of gym owners who went out on business

[11:07] So I could just hire to get some salespeople because when I see that kind of stuff

[11:11] 3-1 4-1 upfront

[11:13] You don't I mean 10 to 1 at 30 days 10 to 1 at at 60 days

[11:18] 60 days like in gym launch I lose money the first 30 to 60 days

[11:22] Right and like I'm just I just know the math game right

[11:25] I just will need to make decisions with math if you are able to make decisions with math right now

[11:29] And not let your emotions and not let your fear and not let your discomfort around learning a new skill

[11:34] Which is selling over the phone because it's the only thing you have to do it's it as long as you acquired that skill set

[11:38] Which by the way?

[11:40] We'll set you up better for when you get back to the gym because if you can sell to the phone you can throw a high percentage of leads always right

[11:45] If you can just learn that skill you can have everyone business

[11:50] Simple as that right now and I hope and I think my hunch is that that

[11:56] By me everyone not change people will be now the mass market has been introduced to what all-in training is

[12:02] Like most people even know what it was now they know what it is

[12:05] All right, and so that that like you're underestiming how big of a deal it is for them to even recognize that industry

[12:10] All right, and so one people will now know what all-line training is number two

[12:15] They will be comfortable more comfortable buying and remote setting here. I should head over the phone

[12:19] Yeah, this is after the lights get turned back on because you're like well

[12:22] I don't want to change things you know temporarily because something you know when what happens when you go later

[12:25] What if you have a business that just cash flows later and then you have your gym because many people like I don't even get into it

[12:32] But over the phone you would just say yeah, you know when COVID happened

[12:35] We started doing our our first consults over the phone and it ended up just being working for people

[12:38] So we just stuck with it anyways, so what's your name? Why do you click on the app right?

[12:42] Like you can just preface the the sale and that everything else flows like normal right because

[12:47] This is given us the biggest reason of all time the biggest why am I remote?

[12:51] Why are you doing this over the phone? Why are we doing this online?

[12:53] It has now given everyone permission to have that reason that we never had before right and

[12:59] Educated like thank you to the government for educating all consumers on online and remote setting fitness

[13:04] Right, thank you to the news. Thank you to everybody for helping us out

[13:08] all right, so I sell this to say I think that for everyone who's holding out and waiting

[13:15] I don't think that's a smart decision

[13:17] I don't want to be right, but I think I probably will be

[13:19] I think a lot of people are trying to light's back on and a lot of people are coming back

[13:23] Right, I think of this like vacation. It's like all these people are like you know

[13:26] Actually, I'm I'm gonna keep doing things at home or you know is actually kind of working mean you for me to just kind of do it on my own schedule

[13:32] Instead of having to go there come back shower all that stuff. It was just kind of easier for me because convenience and speed

[13:38] Always win with humans

[13:40] Always you have to always bet on convenience because we are lazy

[13:44] Right and especially when it comes to fitness

[13:47] All right, and so it's like well

[13:48] That's why and that's why many people can't market outside of Fama ready to get people are too lazy to drive further

[13:54] Right, they're too lazy

[13:55] You're like but our gym so great. It's like yeah, but they're gonna choose to shit your gym that's closer to them

[14:00] Just being real right and so if you can take the service to them

[14:04] Which we now have the opportunity to learn the skill set to do that you can by the time this thing turns back on

[14:09] Probably have more recurring profit profit income than you did before this

[14:13] But it's for the people who want to win and who want to take action otherwise if you're just gonna wait

[14:18] Totally cool will help you wouldn't want to come back because we do that too

[14:22] But that's just my that's my two cents right now and I know that whenever I talk about online

[14:26] It's always polarizing but I have a really hard time not speaking my mind about something that I think is more profitable

[14:31] And I think is Laura risk and I think in the post

[14:33] Corona economy

[14:35] The businesses that will win are the ones that have lower overhead and have higher margins and have a higher ability to reach customers

[14:41] We're there out and all of those boxes get checked and then you get all the added bonus benefits that I said earlier

[14:47] Versely unlimited lead flow cheaper leads bigger radius

[14:51] Higher profit margin get all of those things on top of everything is so anyway, don't let the

[14:56] Oshitt moment have to view

[14:59] Take action now

[15:01] Start selling remote. I think it is it is incredibly incredibly

[15:05] Incredibly awesome right now and you should get it

[15:09] Keeping great kitchen. I have a great day and

[15:13] Drop a chat or chat or light and not a chat drop a comment or like or you know

[15:17] Something like that if you like it if you didn't get them so all right get you in bye

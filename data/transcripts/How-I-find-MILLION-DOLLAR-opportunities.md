[00:00] In this video, I want to talk to you about strategy and strategies one of the most amorphous

[00:04] terms that kind of exists in the business world. People throw it around at the time,

[00:07] it's kind of like the word value, by people use it a lot. But I think a deeper understanding

[00:12] of strategy will yield outsized for terms. You know, it's that one or two big decisions that

[00:17] directly the entire course of your life, your business career over the next handful of years,

[00:22] is a result of strategy. The thing that got me thinking about this is that

[00:27] from my life, changing or improving the opportunity vehicle that I was pursuing,

[00:31] significantly impacted how much money I made. And I had this really controlled

[00:34] which I can't show you right now. But basically with each increase in leverage

[00:39] that I had, I was able to add about a zero per month to income, so on and from four figures

[00:44] month to five figures, months to six figures, months to seven figures, months and now,

[00:47] how we're going to get to a figures month is going in accordance with this.

[00:50] From an discussion that was happening with a good friend of mine, I was like, how do I

[00:53] quantify this? And the original thought was simply the leverage of the market,

[01:00] times the leverage of the deliverable. So the craft market times the leverage of the deliverable.

[01:04] I thought more about this and I want to simplify it into three factors. Hopefully,

[01:09] this should show just like clearly a thought over time. And just before I get into this,

[01:13] the reason that I think this is so important is, if you listen to billionaires out of our

[01:18] figures, which I think is one of the most valuable things. I don't really want to hear someone's

[01:22] biographical take on a billionaire because I don't really care about that author's belief set.

[01:28] Right? They're writing books as their way to primarily make money, which is probably not one of

[01:33] the best opportunities, you know, vehicles out there. So that's what they're working with.

[01:37] Then it's the lens and the frame to rich. They see the world. And so I don't really want their analysis.

[01:42] I want to hear from the billionaires perspective how they see the world. And as a result,

[01:47] how they make decisions about what they deem worthy of their time to pursue. One of the ones in

[01:53] the thing that kind of inspired me to go down this path was from richx forceman. And so he's the

[01:58] founder of Blackstone. He's worth about 30 billion. Blackstone manages, I think, right now, about $700

[02:03] billion dollars to have under management. They might be able to trillion. Who knows what's all the

[02:07] inflation, I want to not. But that being said, he said that for him there are three factors that

[02:13] go into pursuing an opportunity. And the one that I'm going to share with you are slightly different.

[02:18] He's probably smarter than I am. But this is what he said and I think this is, I'll show you how I

[02:21] impact that. So number one, he's just said, it has to have the potential to be really big. Number two,

[02:27] he said, it has to be able to be run by 10 out of 10 talent, which means other people can run it

[02:34] and grow it for him when he's behave and probably do it. But it doesn't hit. And the third is that it

[02:39] has to make economic sense. And so for him, it's like the opportunity is big enough. He's got people who

[02:42] can run it, who are level 10 talent and the economic sense, they do the deal, they pursue the

[02:46] opportunity, right? Right. On the flip side of that, for me, as a, you know, smaller entrepreneur than

[02:52] Steven Torzman, the thought process that I use is three variables and it's really unpacking

[02:59] really big opportunity. Like that idea is I just want to unpack that piece. So there are three things

[03:05] that I believe go into that. Number one is the potential number of units able to be sold at scale.

[03:13] So if we were to take this thing all the way into the future and max out every possible potential,

[03:18] how many number of units can we sell, which is an inner word, what people say as tam. So total

[03:24] addressable market, how many potential units could we sell? Number one. Number two is the potential

[03:31] profit per unit sold. And so this is, this is a function of how much value you believe can be

[03:36] provide, which pricing sensitivity is there and then what are cost of goods could be at scale.

[03:40] And so in the beginning, a lot of times you're not going to certainly have that level of

[03:44] profitability, et cetera, right? Per unit. Like if you're, you know, if you're building on a massive

[03:49] factory, then that would cost a lot of stuff upfront. But the additional unit, the contribution

[03:54] margin per additional unit sold might be very, very high. And if you see a huge market,

[03:59] where you can sell lots of products, which is variable one, and you have the potential

[04:03] for tremendous profit margins, because there's a lot of value between what they're willing to pay

[04:07] and what cost is to fulfill, then those are the first two factors. And for a while, those are the

[04:12] first two factors that I kind of talked about publicly. And I was like, because, you know, as I

[04:16] developed for you, more of some like, is that it? Is there something else that that kind of factors

[04:20] into this? And so after, after beating up the idea for a little bit, I came to a third one that I

[04:26] believe is the kind of the third piece of this, and it feels relatively complete to me at this point.

[04:32] And so I'll share with you. So the third is understanding exactly what the supply demand curve

[04:41] looks like within that marketplace. So I'll give you kind of two contrasting examples. So if we were to

[04:47] enter into, let's say, the mobile device space, from a telecommunication standpoint, so let's say,

[04:54] I want to go competing against Verizon, right? Well, the total just markets huge, okay? The

[04:59] potential profit per unit sold is huge, right? I can sell phone services to everyone. Okay, cool.

[05:08] Do I want to necessarily pursue that opportunity? Well, what are the supply demand

[05:12] economics within that marketplace? If I see something that has tons and tons of supply that is

[05:20] existing and entrenched, then the supply demand economics are not going to be in my favor. Whereas,

[05:26] if we're going after something that is maybe newer or growing and has the same huge potential

[05:31] scale, lots of potential profit to be made, but the number of people who want something versus

[05:36] the number of people who are supplying it are in my favor as a potential new entrance in the marketplace,

[05:42] then that would be something that would be an additional point towards that opportunity compared to

[05:47] another. Right? And so right now, that is the three kind of frameworks that I'm looking at.

[05:53] When we're looking at investment opportunities, in terms of what companies were buying into,

[05:58] is I'd look at those three things now, which is how big do I think this market could potentially

[06:02] be at scale? How much profit can we potentially make per unit sold at scale? And then what are the

[06:09] supply demand economics within that marketplace? And are they favorable? And a lot of the pieces that

[06:16] are going to make it more favorable, maybe short term, niching down because within a sliver of that market,

[06:21] there's better supply demand economics in terms of competition there. Right? Or the marketplace is growing

[06:29] in a very rapid rate, which even with the increasing number of entrance, the increasing number of

[06:34] entrance is significantly smaller than the increase in demand. Right? And so let's say we've got,

[06:40] you know, demand is growing at 20% a year and new competitors are growing, are entering the space

[06:45] at 10% per year. So I still have increasing supply demand economics in my favor to enter that marketplace.

[06:53] Right? And so those are kind of the three big things that I'm looking at. And the reason this is

[06:59] important for you, all right? So this is the take away for everyone who's listening to this.

[07:03] I was talking to an entrepreneur the other day, very skilled entrepreneur. And they've been stuck

[07:07] at, you know, not a ton of money. And they're very skilled. And they kept trying to reinvent the wheel

[07:14] within their current business. But the issue was not the model that they were pursuing.

[07:18] It was the opportunity itself. And so I think that a lot of entrepreneurs, especially smaller

[07:22] business owners who are newer or starting out, do not think with this frame and believe that they need

[07:27] to be stubbornly persistent to try and figure it out. And I think that there is value in that

[07:32] and the single hardest decision I should answer to an entrepreneur. And this is one that I've given a lot

[07:35] of thought to is understanding when to quit. All right? And you can use it as the term quit because

[07:43] purposely making that little bit more trigger heavy in terms of people's emotional response to it.

[07:48] But it's really when do you choose to change your mind with increasing amounts of data? And I think

[07:53] one of the telltale signs of intelligent people is that they are able to change their minds.

[07:58] If you were unable to change your mind, that it means that you will not be better than you currently

[08:03] are. I think about that. So like it's this weird thing where we have this desire to be consistent

[08:09] with our commitments in the past. But as data increases, so should, too, the quality of your decisions.

[08:15] And if enough data is presented to you that there is a superior opportunity. And so this may seem

[08:20] like this is in contrary to niche slapping a video that I made in the past that has gotten a lot of

[08:25] attention, which is you need to focus on one thing that you're doing it. That is true. But there

[08:31] do come times. And this is why I say it's one of the hardest decisions in entrepreneurship, which is

[08:36] when do I decide that enough is enough with this current course? And so I think that the way to

[08:40] focus on this, or at least the takeaway that I would say with this, is number one, is that whatever

[08:44] you are doing, you need to focus exclusively on that thing. If you're trying to pursue multiple paths,

[08:49] then the likely that you succeed at any of them is very, very low. And so you want to stack

[08:53] the percentages likelihood that you're going to achieve something in your favor. And so the first

[08:58] way to do that is focus, which is character trait that most people lack, which is one of those people.

[09:01] But if you have that character trait and you pursue the thing with focus and diligence and persistence,

[09:06] then you have a high likelihood of achieving the desired outcome. Now, if you continue to walk

[09:11] down that path and it's been one year, two years, five years, right? And you still haven't really

[09:15] seen significant progress, right? You take one step forward and two step back, you keep this over

[09:19] and over again. I'm not saying that you leave entrepreneurship. I am saying that you have to use some

[09:25] level of discernment to say, is this the best opportunity vehicle for the skills traits in

[09:29] beliefs that I currently have right now as an entrepreneur, or is there a different wrapping paper

[09:34] that serves a bigger market that I can sell higher value units to, right? That is higher profit

[09:40] market with their willing to pay and what it costs me to fulfill. And are there supply to

[09:44] man economics that are in my favor in that marketplace that are superior to the vehicle that I'm in

[09:49] right now? And again, that being said, there's always compounding returns with staying with something

[09:53] for a long period of time. You know, the first five years compared to the next five years,

[09:56] probably have significantly outside returns on the second set of five years in the first set.

[10:01] I'm not saying that. You should not be persistent that is definitely not the takeaway here.

[10:05] But in talking with a lot of small business owners, many times they need to be pursuing a better

[10:12] or bigger opportunity vehicle. And I think the difference between the rich and the poor is simply

[10:16] how they value their time and how they choose to allocate the resources and what things they choose

[10:21] to say no to because simply they are not worth it. Which is why Elon Musk is probably not pursuing

[10:27] directly to you. There's nothing wrong with directly. And maybe for you in your opportunity

[10:32] vehicle that might be good, that might be a good opportunity vehicle for you. But for him,

[10:37] with his skills traits and beliefs and access, he believes that he wants to go after bigger opportunities

[10:42] than that. And so I wanted to leave you this for food for thought in terms of some questions to ask

[10:48] yourself about your current opportunity vehicle, which is, is this the best use of my time,

[10:55] my skills, my resources and my beliefs and my experiences and everything that I have access to.

[11:00] Or is there something that is potentially better? And if so, she I appreciate that instead in time,

[11:06] not jumping to it now and trying to start a building of origin, doing two things at the same time

[11:10] because then neither of them will work. But is there a time to cut bait? And so I think these are the

[11:14] frameworks that I think through in terms of investment opportunities for us in terms of where we put

[11:18] our money in our time and what kinds of companies that we like to invest in? Give it our traits,

[11:25] skills, and beliefs. And so anyways, I wanted to share this thought process with you. I hope you found

[11:29] value it. By the way, if you're near the channel, my name is Alchimosi, I would like to do an

[11:32] position.com to portfolio companies to do about 85 million dollars a year. Hopefully you enjoyed this.

[11:36] I make these these videos because a lot of people are broken. I don't want to be one of them.

[11:39] And one of the most important decisions is what opportunities do we choose to pursue? So with that,

[11:44] I'll keep you going. I'll see you next week. Bye.

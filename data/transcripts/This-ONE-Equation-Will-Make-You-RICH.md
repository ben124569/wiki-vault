[00:00] This one equation will make you rich,

[00:01] I recently spoke in AdWorld.

[00:03] We stated the very edge

[00:03] to understand how you can use the equation

[00:05] to sell lots of stuff, for lots of money,

[00:07] and make yourself unreasonably wealthy.

[00:08] You being awesome and enjoying.

[00:10] Big picture, there's two things

[00:11] I don't want to talk about.

[00:12] One is how do you create and sell valuable things?

[00:14] You probably hear people say,

[00:15] hey, like provide more value, give value away,

[00:18] like, it's all about value value value,

[00:19] but like no one defines what is value, what does that even mean?

[00:22] Right, what are the components that create

[00:23] a more or less valuable product or service?

[00:25] The second part is one of the four different things

[00:27] that you can do to enhance value.

[00:29] But once you have a valuable thing,

[00:30] you can enhance it by adding scarcity.

[00:32] You can enhance it by adding urgency.

[00:34] You can enhance it by adding bonuses.

[00:36] You can enhance it by adding guarantees.

[00:37] And you can also, as a fifth half bonus for you guys,

[00:41] you can enhance the value by simply naming it

[00:44] in a way that resonates more with your avatar,

[00:47] or the type of person you want to sell to.

[00:49] And so if those are the five things

[00:50] that can enhance the value of the thing that you're selling,

[00:52] if you have all five, and you do them well,

[00:54] you will sell more than you would if you didn't have them.

[00:56] Now, I won't have time to get into all five.

[00:58] I'm just going to talk about one of them,

[00:59] which is guarantees.

[01:00] It's a big picture.

[01:01] We're going to talk about how to create and destroy value

[01:03] and the things that we sell.

[01:04] And we'll talk about how to reverse risk through guarantees

[01:06] to make the things that we are selling more compelling to them

[01:09] because now they won't fear that they're not going

[01:10] to get the outcome that we promised.

[01:12] Cool.

[01:13] Awesome.

[01:14] I spent a very long time trying to figure out what value meant.

[01:16] And it's because we worked with a lot of portfolio companies

[01:19] and we want to think about how we can create new product offerings

[01:21] that are going to be that are going to sell for lots of money

[01:23] with big margins and Nick is all rich.

[01:26] I wanted to come up with an equation

[01:27] that would encapsulate this so that we could basically

[01:30] formulate or formulately approach the problem.

[01:33] So it's like if we check these boxes,

[01:35] we're going to get something valuable.

[01:36] Then we can just do this over and over and over again.

[01:38] And I had to do it that way because I can't be the person

[01:41] who's making the products in every one of these companies

[01:42] at this point.

[01:43] So I have to create a process around it.

[01:45] The four variables are as follows.

[01:46] So if you're taking notes or you have something on your side,

[01:48] screen, this is the, these are the writer-downers.

[01:50] Number one is the dream outcome.

[01:51] Is the thing that we are promising something

[01:53] that people actually want?

[01:55] And I'm going to dive into these four in a second,

[01:57] but I want to just give you the four and then we'll double-click.

[01:59] So that's number one.

[02:01] And when you're writing these down,

[02:02] write it down like a fraction.

[02:03] So draw a line, write in the middle of your paper or whatever.

[02:06] And you'll have two on the top and two on the bottom.

[02:08] So number one is your dream outcome.

[02:09] Number two is the perceived likelihood of achievement.

[02:13] How likely does someone believe that if they purchase your thing,

[02:16] they're going to achieve the outcome that we are promising.

[02:19] A lot of words, hopefully a simple concept.

[02:21] Number three is the time component.

[02:23] In essence, how quickly are they going to get the thing after they pay?

[02:27] The fourth is the dual side of coin of effort and sacrifice.

[02:30] What is someone have to start doing that they don't want to do

[02:33] as a result of this purchase?

[02:34] And then what are the things that they have to stop doing

[02:37] that they would like to keep doing,

[02:38] that they cannot no longer do as a result of this purchase.

[02:41] So there's the four things.

[02:43] And what I'd like you to do in thinking through this

[02:45] as we break it down is think about your own products and services

[02:48] that you have and think about how they stack up

[02:50] in using this equation.

[02:52] I'm going to give you a big picture back and forth example

[02:55] and then I'm going to dive into each of them in more detail.

[02:57] If we were to think about an ideal outcome,

[03:00] all right, so let's use weight loss

[03:01] because it's an example that most people can understand.

[03:04] All right, so why is it that let's say you have some things

[03:07] that you can sell for weight loss like $50,000

[03:09] surgeries for life out suction?

[03:11] And on the other hand, you've got a $5 ebook

[03:14] that promises a skinny tummy.

[03:16] If they make the same promise, right, which is the dream outcome,

[03:19] number one, how's these two things are so different in price,

[03:22] right?

[03:23] Well, it's the other three variables, right?

[03:25] Because the dream outcome, people want to lose weight, right?

[03:27] And so that's unit number one.

[03:30] Now the reason that that is number one of the four

[03:32] is that if I were to say, hey, I can make you a million dollars

[03:36] versus losing weight, most people, many men, especially,

[03:39] would probably value making money more

[03:41] than they would value losing weight, not always,

[03:43] but oftentimes, as a category, investment things,

[03:47] franchise opportunities, business opportunities,

[03:49] tend to sell for a higher price,

[03:50] which is the kind of the component of B2B,

[03:52] business of business versus business of consumer.

[03:54] By and large, when you have two different things,

[03:56] like that, we use the dream outcome to differentiate

[03:58] entire industries or categories of products

[04:01] as being more or less expensive.

[04:02] Now, once we have the same dream outcome,

[04:07] like weight loss, being delivered,

[04:09] then we move on to the other three parts of the equation.

[04:11] Let's go on to perceive likely of achievement.

[04:13] If I have two people who are selling the same exact thing,

[04:15] let's use a doctor in that weight loss example,

[04:17] like the liposuction guy.

[04:18] And let's say that liposuction guy, A,

[04:20] doctor, has done 10,000 surgeries of liposuction.

[04:23] And let's say, Dr. B has done one.

[04:27] Same surgery, same dream outcome,

[04:29] it's gonna take the same amount of time,

[04:31] same amount of effort for you.

[04:32] This guy might even spend more time on you

[04:34] than this guy, because he's not as experienced.

[04:36] Which one are you gonna go with?

[04:38] Probably the 10,000 guy.

[04:39] Why?

[04:40] Because of the perceived likelihood of achievement.

[04:42] We have lower risk associated with making this purchase

[04:45] because we believe that if we give this money,

[04:47] we're gonna have the occupant we desire.

[04:48] And so if you think through this

[04:49] in terms of your own products,

[04:50] you're like, am I doing a good of job?

[04:52] Before the purchase of increasing someone's perceived

[04:54] like the legitimate because in a very real way,

[04:56] that confers itself or translates into higher prices.

[04:59] This guy, even though it probably takes some less time

[05:02] to do the surgery, he actually can charge more

[05:04] than this guy.

[05:05] And that while, so we've got the dream outcome,

[05:08] is the thing something people actually want

[05:09] was to perceive likely to achievement.

[05:11] Now if we stop there between making big promises

[05:13] and making people believe that it's actually gonna happen

[05:15] for them, that is what the majority

[05:17] of young and new entrepreneurs spend their time on.

[05:19] Most people, myself included, spent the first half,

[05:22] two thirds of my career trying to beef up the top side.

[05:24] I would promise bigger, now it's show,

[05:26] more testimony as more results,

[05:27] promise bigger, more testimony as more results, right?

[05:30] More third, party identification, more celebrity endorsements,

[05:32] et cetera, right?

[05:33] But I believe now, now I've done this a little bit

[05:35] that the actual fortunes rely on the bottom side

[05:38] of the equation, okay?

[05:39] So remember, this is the top side that creates value,

[05:42] the bottom side of this fraction are the things

[05:44] that destroy value.

[05:45] Our goal is to increase the top side

[05:46] and decrease the bottom side.

[05:47] So with time, there's two components of time.

[05:50] We have the time delay between when you buy

[05:53] and when you get, and then the amount of time

[05:56] to immediately start seeing any kind of outcome.

[05:59] So it's like the experience along with.

[06:00] So for example, if I signed up for a gym membership,

[06:02] right, using this weight loss example,

[06:04] I might know that I'm not gonna lose the weight for a year,

[06:07] but if I start seeing value from the community,

[06:09] I start feeling more upbeat, et cetera,

[06:11] I'm gonna start experiencing benefits

[06:13] that might not be my big goal,

[06:14] but I'm gonna have other things along the way

[06:16] that are gonna still deliver value quickly.

[06:18] The whole component of time here is how quickly

[06:20] between when I buy and when I get,

[06:22] I'll give you a B2B example and a B2B example.

[06:24] And a B2B example, let's see you on a marketing firm.

[06:27] So this is the atmosphere,

[06:28] so I'm sure they'll let this will resonate with one of you guys.

[06:29] If you have two agencies that are side by side,

[06:31] and they both say, hey, I'm gonna do some marketing for you

[06:33] and I'm gonna get your phone to ring.

[06:35] One way or another, marketing A to C A

[06:37] says, okay, now that we're doing this,

[06:39] you're gonna have to start recording lots of ads for us

[06:42] and we're gonna be meeting three times a week

[06:44] an hour each time and you're probably gonna take four hours

[06:46] a week to record these ads for us.

[06:48] And it's gonna take us 60 days to get this stuff done.

[06:52] At day 60, your phone starts ringing from the ads that they do,

[06:55] okay, marketing A to number two.

[06:56] You sign the paper and as soon as you sign the paper

[06:59] and they process your credit cards,

[07:00] your phone rings and it's a lead within seconds.

[07:03] Same product, time collapse.

[07:07] And so one of the easiest things I had a mentor

[07:08] once said, say this, he said,

[07:09] one of the easiest ways to figure out what product this is,

[07:11] look at the products, everyone else is selling

[07:13] and deliver the same thing in half the time.

[07:15] And so when we think about the products that we sell,

[07:16] is there a way that we can condense TTV, which is time to value.

[07:20] And so one of the key, one of the huge ways

[07:21] that we focus on when we bring a portfolio company in

[07:23] at Acquisites.com is we say,

[07:25] how can we look at this service delivery

[07:27] and see if we can do it faster?

[07:29] Now, before the people who are in the room were like,

[07:31] well, my business is different.

[07:33] We have a company that publishes books for God's sake.

[07:36] So a very long process, but what we were trying to figure out

[07:40] because they had the same situation where it's like,

[07:41] it just takes time for someone to write a book,

[07:43] like how can we deliver this value faster?

[07:45] And so the thing is, is it just like that gym example

[07:47] that I said, it's not that you necessarily

[07:48] have to deliver the longest result first,

[07:51] but you want to deliver a result first.

[07:54] You want to have a tangible outcome

[07:55] that someone can experience literally holding their hands.

[07:57] And so one of the things that they did was

[07:59] created a little seven day mini book boot camp.

[08:02] And when they did that, people at the end of seven days

[08:05] could have an actual mini book published and live.

[08:08] Now, they make you clear, this is not the book

[08:09] that's going to make you millionaire.

[08:10] But what it was was to break the belief

[08:12] and approve the concept that they could really do it.

[08:15] And then they got the bind and really built the real book

[08:17] that was going to end up making the money, et cetera.

[08:19] And so the idea here is that if you are creative,

[08:22] and if you are a loser, then don't think this way.

[08:25] But if you are a winner, there's always the question

[08:27] which is how can I make this work for me.

[08:29] And so you have to think.

[08:29] If you're a real estate agent, like, well,

[08:31] it takes 90 days to sell a house,

[08:32] how can I give someone an outcome before that?

[08:33] It's like, well, what else happens?

[08:35] They have to clean the house, they have to inspect the house,

[08:36] they want to know about ways to make new or more value.

[08:38] There's lawn care, there's fixing.

[08:40] There's a million things they have to happen.

[08:41] Is there other things that I can do along this journey

[08:43] that I can provide more value

[08:44] to this person earlier so they can get better experience?

[08:45] In a B2C example, let's say I'm on the internet

[08:48] and I'm trying to buy something for weight loss.

[08:51] And I click the button that says six minute abs.

[08:53] And then six minutes later, I have abs.

[08:56] How, like, literally, I look at my shirt

[08:57] like, holy shit, how valuable would whatever that thing be.

[09:02] If in six minutes, I would have abs.

[09:04] Probably infinitely valuable.

[09:05] And so when we can find ways to deliver the outcomes

[09:08] to our customers sooner or faster, they will value it a lot more.

[09:12] Now, I just a little bit more, a lot more.

[09:14] Speed is one of the best all-time competitive advantages.

[09:17] And so the last one is effort and sacrifice.

[09:19] So I said it's two sides at the same point

[09:20] because when you take on a new customer,

[09:22] you have to start doing things that they weren't doing before.

[09:25] That's effort.

[09:26] They probably don't want to do it

[09:28] because they weren't doing it before

[09:29] which is why they weren't doing it.

[09:30] And on the flip side, they've got stuff

[09:31] that they stop doing that they do want to do.

[09:34] And that's why they're two sides at the same point.

[09:35] In that market example, I just gave with the agency, right?

[09:38] Let's say marketing agency A&B and I said A had,

[09:41] you have to three meetings a week

[09:43] and you've got four hours to deliver us copy and creative

[09:47] and whatever, right?

[09:48] Versus, the other agency, it's like,

[09:50] oh, we've already tested all the stuff for your industry

[09:52] and we've got videographers and whatnot

[09:54] who can already just run in the stuff like you just pass

[09:57] and it's taken care of.

[09:58] How much more valuable is the guy who takes none of your

[10:02] effort in sacrifice?

[10:03] Takes no effort on your part to make this outcome occur.

[10:06] So if you think about this within your own business,

[10:08] the way that we like to think about these four variables, right?

[10:12] When we have the effort in sacrifice,

[10:13] the goal, just like time, is to decrease it.

[10:15] And if we're repeating the same activities

[10:16] with everyone of our customers, how can we streamline that?

[10:19] How can we predict what is going to happen?

[10:22] And how can we make three onboarding calls into one?

[10:26] And how can we make one onboarding call into a checklist?

[10:28] So how can we streamline this process such that

[10:31] it's seamless and effortless and ideally

[10:33] immediate for them to achieve the result?

[10:35] And so I said there's four variables in the value equation.

[10:38] You've got a big dream outcome that people want to experience.

[10:41] They believe that the likelihood that they're going to experience

[10:43] it is very high.

[10:44] The time that they have to wait between when they buy

[10:46] and when they get is as little as possible.

[10:49] And then the effort in sacrifice is zero.

[10:51] And when you put those four things together,

[10:53] you have a very valuable product.

[10:54] And so when I said that the bottom half of the equation

[10:56] is the more valuable thing that as I've learned is that

[10:59] it's very easy to make bigger promises and, you know,

[11:01] throw testimonials and things like that.

[11:03] It's much harder to actually have the operational effectiveness

[11:06] to drive results faster and decrease the amount of effort

[11:09] that a customer has to put forth.

[11:10] And so the competitive modes that exist in the big businesses

[11:13] are on the bottom side of the equation.

[11:14] Netflix took over a Bachbuster because they made

[11:16] consumption of movies and TV shows immediate.

[11:19] And your effort in sacrifice,

[11:20] if you didn't have to get up in your car,

[11:22] drive around the corner 15 minutes, walk around, grab the thing.

[11:25] And then, not to mention, return it three days later,

[11:29] which is zero value add to you, right?

[11:30] Without getting your late fee, they just got rid of all of that.

[11:33] So you could just take your phone and start watching.

[11:35] But the actual dream I come in perceived likely

[11:37] on both of those occasions that people thought

[11:39] they were gonna watch a movie or watch TV show.

[11:41] And they were very certain they wanted to do it, right?

[11:43] So like the top side was the same.

[11:45] The bottom side of the equation is really killed at real.

[11:47] If you look at Amazon, they made the purchasing process

[11:50] seamless on two angles.

[11:51] So I can click with one button and it comes tomorrow.

[11:54] They made the effort in sacrifice virtually nothing

[11:56] in terms of the purchasing.

[11:57] And then the time to light is virtually nothing

[11:59] in terms of getting the thing.

[12:00] And they continue to shrink that time gap.

[12:02] They sell the same products as everyone else.

[12:04] Literally.

[12:05] But what did they do?

[12:06] They increased the perceived likely to achieve

[12:07] them by adding all the reviews.

[12:09] So people believe that when they buy the thing,

[12:10] they're gonna get the outcome they really want,

[12:12] the job they hired the product to solve.

[12:15] They believe they have when they have that

[12:17] because of the reviews that Amazon leaves, right?

[12:19] The time, because they get it immediately

[12:20] and they can buy it quickly

[12:22] and the same thing with the effort in sacrifice, right?

[12:24] And so that's ultimately how Amazon is able to beat

[12:26] because they provide value.

[12:27] All right, this is making sense.

[12:28] This is cool.

[12:29] Guys, dig in this.

[12:29] Okay, I'll give you one cool benefit of that four part stack

[12:32] and then I'll segue into the guaranteed portion.

[12:34] All right.

[12:35] So I gave you four variables.

[12:38] Guess what those four variables also equate to?

[12:40] They equate to headlines and copy.

[12:43] So if I want to promise something to a prospect,

[12:45] what am I gonna say?

[12:46] Here's the dream outcome.

[12:47] Here's a number that is related

[12:49] to the amount of people who've helped achieve this thing.

[12:52] Here's how long it took them to achieve that thing

[12:54] and then here are stipulations around that claim.

[12:56] And if you have data from your customer success department,

[12:59] which hopefully you do, right?

[13:01] Which is percentage of customers who may be leave a five star review

[13:04] or percentage of customers who achieve X outcome

[13:06] by X date under this condition.

[13:09] Now you have claims that you can use that are very compelling

[13:11] in your marketing and your copy.

[13:12] These can be headlines, emails, they can be headlines and ads.

[13:15] They can be on your sales pages.

[13:16] They can be hooks in your videos and creative content.

[13:19] And so when you think through these four variables,

[13:20] they are the consistent variables of claims in general.

[13:24] So when you want to communicate to a carer factor

[13:27] that you can help market for his facility,

[13:29] you're going to say 70% of our carer structures

[13:32] that we work with achieve over 100 patients

[13:34] in their first 30 days without having to make an ad,

[13:37] effort and sacrifice.

[13:39] And so when you do something like that,

[13:40] you've used those four parts of the equation

[13:42] that is also reverse engineers copy

[13:44] because they should be related

[13:46] because value is what people want to buy.

[13:48] And so your ability to persuade

[13:50] and your ability to understand and communicate value

[13:52] should be married.

[13:54] When you're thinking about your products and services

[13:56] and you have these four variables, you're like,

[13:57] okay, how do I do this, right?

[13:58] So the way that we think through this

[14:01] is that we create a big list of problems, right?

[14:03] Which is, I like to think about in sequence,

[14:04] which is, what is every single mini micro step

[14:07] as chunked down is,

[14:08] is, humanly possible that someone has to go

[14:10] through to experience this result.

[14:11] So if you're in the physical product business,

[14:12] then that's why Amazon spent so much time on the actual purchasing

[14:15] because there's not a ton that they have to do.

[14:17] But once the person receives the product,

[14:20] what's their first impression of the box,

[14:22] the unpackaging, the directions that they get in order to use it,

[14:25] what they're using it experience

[14:27] looks like the first time, the second time, et cetera.

[14:29] How can we streamline that process

[14:30] for them?

[14:31] How can we give them different ways

[14:31] that they can use the same thing?

[14:33] In the service side, there's probably a lot more

[14:35] micro steps that somebody's going to have to take

[14:36] in order to achieve the outcome, right?

[14:38] And so the idea is, we want to write down

[14:40] every single problem that could possibly encounter

[14:42] throughout their entire journey with us.

[14:44] And then we want to write out what the solution of that would look

[14:47] like.

[14:48] Now, we're just putting, we're in, we're in fictitious world here.

[14:50] We're saying, you know, blue ocean, what would we do

[14:52] to solve every one of these problems, right?

[14:54] And we get this huge list.

[14:55] A lot of guys who go through the book

[14:56] have a hundred plus different,

[14:58] little mini micro problems and mini micro solutions

[15:00] that they have.

[15:01] Now, once you have this huge thing,

[15:02] this is a fun activity to do with your team

[15:04] is how can we make the thing we sell more valuable, right?

[15:06] Once you have that list, you then do something

[15:08] I call the termit stack, which is, you look at that list,

[15:10] you say, which of these is the most valuable to them?

[15:12] Which is the one they suffer the most from,

[15:13] that is most valuable to them.

[15:15] That's category number one.

[15:16] Then, next to those, which of these would cost us

[15:19] virtually nothing to build or implement?

[15:21] After we have a first time experience, right?

[15:24] So it's like if you have to build out

[15:25] like a grocery calculator,

[15:26] it's gonna take you time one time

[15:27] but then every time after that, it's done, right?

[15:29] What's the incremental cost of each of these solutions?

[15:33] And so then you order those.

[15:34] In terms of, I just would go low medium high, it's very simple.

[15:39] And so then for me, what we do with the companies we have

[15:41] is we look at the things that are high value

[15:43] and cost us very little to provide on increment

[15:46] and we cut everything else out.

[15:47] And then we have something that's extremely valuable

[15:49] and cost us very little.

[15:50] And that's how you have a very high value,

[15:52] very high margin, product of service that you sell.

[15:55] That is ultimately how we recreate value in a business.

[15:58] And we like to think about it

[15:59] is like, what are all the capacities of the business?

[16:00] What are all the problems they could potentially solve?

[16:02] And in which ones will we choose to solve?

[16:04] And then once we're very ruthlessly clear

[16:05] on the problems that we choose to solve,

[16:07] we cut out everything else and say,

[16:08] that's just not a problem with you solve.

[16:10] We know we could solve it, but just based on the economics

[16:12] of that solution or that problem,

[16:14] we don't want to be the ones to go.

[16:15] And then we say ruthlessly focused on things

[16:16] that we do we do more.

[16:17] Okay, now, most people think that they're selling

[16:19] against their competition.

[16:21] I disagree.

[16:22] What you're really selling against is inaction.

[16:25] You're selling against doubt.

[16:27] You're selling against the biggest obstacle,

[16:29] which is risk.

[16:29] The comfort of not doing the thing,

[16:32] or not buying the product is so high,

[16:34] we have to help decrease their action threshold.

[16:36] We have to lower that bar just so they can

[16:38] to step right over it because up here,

[16:40] they don't want to take action,

[16:41] because it's too comfortable.

[16:42] We have to lower it so much,

[16:43] so there's so little friction for them

[16:44] to take action with us that they buy.

[16:46] I think one of the more compelling things

[16:47] that a business can do is offer guarantees.

[16:50] Guarities are you assuming a certain percentage

[16:52] of the risk from the buyer.

[16:54] Whenever there's an exchange between two parties,

[16:56] there's a certain amount of risk

[16:57] that both parties incur.

[16:59] As if you have these two parties

[17:00] and there's a certain amount of risk that's shared,

[17:01] you can shift the risk in your favor

[17:04] because you have more knowledge

[17:05] about the fulfillment of the client does.

[17:07] Why?

[17:08] Because you've done this a hundred times before

[17:09] and this is their first time.

[17:11] And so it would make sense

[17:12] that we shift some of that risk in our favor.

[17:14] And we do that in the form of a guarantee,

[17:17] rather than like insurance.

[17:18] But you can think about guarantees

[17:19] as purchase insurance for the buyer.

[17:22] And so there are four ways

[17:23] that I think through guarantees

[17:25] and creating instruction creative guarantees.

[17:27] The four types are unconditional guarantees,

[17:29] which means it doesn't matter what you do,

[17:31] if you just want your money back, we'll give it back to you.

[17:33] That is the strongest type of guarantee.

[17:35] Now, it depends on the type of business.

[17:36] If you can't offer it, I think you should.

[17:38] Because if you do the math on,

[17:40] if I reverse the risk

[17:41] and I get 20% more sales

[17:43] because of this unconditional guarantee,

[17:45] and I get 5% more refunds

[17:48] and I even 5% more on an increment.

[17:49] Let's just say you get 5, you go from 1% refunds

[17:51] to 5% refunds, which would be a massive increase in refunds.

[17:54] You still added 15% to your sales.

[17:57] And it was still worth it mathematically.

[17:59] That is why having the guarantee is just a math equation.

[18:01] It's not like you can't let your emotions be like,

[18:03] well, we got more refunds now.

[18:04] It's like, yeah, we also got 20% more sales.

[18:06] So you just have to think about it like that,

[18:08] just be a business person and not emotional about it.

[18:10] Number two is a conditional guarantee,

[18:12] which says we will give you X, if X happens Y.

[18:16] If this happens, this is what we will do.

[18:18] If Y the next, very simple.

[18:20] If you provide a content for our marketing agency,

[18:23] always buy noon on Fridays

[18:26] before the ACAMP ain't start for the first eight weeks.

[18:28] And if you don't make at least twice

[18:29] what you paid us over that first day, we period.

[18:32] We will give you your money back.

[18:34] You can also say we will work with you

[18:35] until you get your money back.

[18:37] The third is an anti-garranty,

[18:39] which if you don't have a guarantee,

[18:41] which there are situations where that makes sense,

[18:44] you want to lean into the fact that you don't have a guarantee.

[18:46] You don't want to like not talk about it.

[18:48] Because it's a normal part of the buying process

[18:49] of like, well, what are my assurances?

[18:51] How do I know this is going to happen?

[18:52] You're making these promises hash I believe you.

[18:54] And that's where you lean in and you're saying,

[18:55] oh no, we don't have guarantees.

[18:56] And if you're the type person that really needs a guarantee,

[18:58] this is not the program for you.

[18:59] Because there's too much work that's on your part.

[19:01] We can guide you, but the vast majority of the success

[19:03] is going to be in your hands.

[19:04] We will guide you, but it's going to be on you.

[19:06] And if that doesn't feel good for you,

[19:07] then there's 100 other guys.

[19:08] Or you have some sort of proprietary thing.

[19:10] It's like once I give you this super secret sauce,

[19:12] you're going to know it forever.

[19:13] And so I can't give you a refund

[19:15] because the day after you learn a secret,

[19:16] it's not valuable to you.

[19:18] And so for that reason, we can't do any kind of guarantees.

[19:22] The fourth is what I call implied guarantees.

[19:24] So anything that's a performance related offer,

[19:27] what increase your revenue by X

[19:29] and we get 20% of the increase?

[19:31] That is an implied guarantee to the buyer.

[19:34] The ref shares, profit shares, performance bonuses,

[19:37] kickers, doing things off of a strike pricing going up.

[19:39] All of those things are implied guarantees

[19:41] based on performance.

[19:42] So those are the four different things

[19:43] that you can do in terms of guarantees.

[19:46] Now, the advanced version of this

[19:48] is that you can stack guarantees.

[19:49] So I can say I will give you a 30 day,

[19:52] unconditional guarantee,

[19:53] and I will give you a 90 day conditional guarantee,

[19:56] which means that for whatever reason you're like,

[19:58] hey, I'm not sure, then you say, listen.

[20:00] The only way for you to be sure is for you

[20:02] to be inside the program.

[20:03] Because I just want you to make an informed decision.

[20:05] You can't make an informed decision

[20:06] until you've actually experienced the product.

[20:07] I'm just going to give you a 30 day unconditional guarantee.

[20:09] So you can get in there, experience the benefits,

[20:10] and then make the decision for yourself.

[20:12] It makes it a very easy sale

[20:13] because then the sale becomes essentially a trial.

[20:15] Now, you're going to close a lot more deals,

[20:16] we're also going to get more refunds,

[20:17] but the net net is you're going to make more sales.

[20:18] And so you do the unconditional guarantee.

[20:20] And you say, but on top of that,

[20:22] and this is where you get clever,

[20:23] is you look at the customers who've made the most money,

[20:25] if you're beat a beat.

[20:26] If you're beat a see, you look at the ones

[20:28] who've gotten the result that you promise, the best results.

[20:30] And then you look at the client journey that they had.

[20:32] What are the things they did,

[20:33] who do they talk to, what was their experience?

[20:35] And so then what we do is we reverse engineer

[20:37] their experience to the key milestones of their experience,

[20:39] and we make those part of the guarantee.

[20:41] So for example, if I were selling internet marketing, whatever,

[20:44] then I would say, as long as you get your domain purchased

[20:47] and you set up a website,

[20:49] and you spend at least $1 an advertising,

[20:51] or $100 an advertising.

[20:52] If you don't get an ROI from this program by day 90,

[20:55] I will give you your money back.

[20:56] And so we make two or three stipulations that seem very straightforward,

[21:00] but the stipulations are the ones

[21:01] that we know are the ones that drive clients success.

[21:03] And so doing, we basically guarantee that they will succeed,

[21:06] which is the point of the guarantee.

[21:08] And so we say, listen, if you're trying to lose weight,

[21:10] I will give you two times what you paid me

[21:12] by the end of this 90 days.

[21:14] If you show up to every one of the workouts,

[21:16] and you send me a picture of all your meals, that's it.

[21:18] You do that.

[21:19] At the end of the 90 days,

[21:20] a guarantee that you're going to lose the weight

[21:22] that I promised you're going to lose.

[21:22] And so you just look at what are the things in common

[21:24] that the people with the biggest successes did.

[21:26] And you just look at the fewest common variables,

[21:28] because the more stipulations you add,

[21:29] the weaker the guarantee is going to be.

[21:31] I'll tell you a fun one if you just want to get weird.

[21:33] If for some reason you have any kind of coaching

[21:36] or any kind of business that's like that,

[21:38] the compliance of opening a Google Doc

[21:41] and writing what you're going to do that day,

[21:42] and at the end of the day just saying what you did,

[21:44] over I think it's like six weeks is like 1% or 2% compliance.

[21:49] Like people just kiddo it.

[21:51] It's so simple.

[21:51] If you want, you could just say, hey,

[21:53] here's my guarantee.

[21:54] If you just say what you're going to do,

[21:56] and at the end of the day you say, what you did,

[21:58] for six weeks, and you don't get the results,

[22:00] then I'll give you the money back.

[22:01] And you automatically know that 99% people

[22:03] are not going to do that anyways.

[22:04] So anyways, fun one for you guys.

[22:06] One of the things that people suck at with guarantees

[22:08] that they say, they make the guarantee amorphous.

[22:10] They say, result guaranteed.

[22:12] What you don't want to do is say that because it's like banner blindness.

[22:14] Everyone's heard that before and it means something different to everybody.

[22:18] What we want to do is spell it exactly what our guarantee is.

[22:20] And we don't even need to use the word guarantee.

[22:22] We can just say, if you don't get very specific outcome,

[22:27] if you don't lose six inches from your waist,

[22:30] buy this time period and you act.

[22:33] I will write you a check for the difference between

[22:36] what you gave me and what you think it was worth.

[22:39] You want to spell it out in common language,

[22:42] so they understand what you're actually saying,

[22:43] rather than saying results guaranteed.

[22:44] If you enjoy the stuff, I've book called $100 offers.

[22:47] You can check it out at 99 cents.

[22:48] I hope you got a good return on your attention,

[22:50] and you can immediately use at least one or two of the things

[22:52] to ultimately sell more people at higher prices.

[00:00] I've been in business 13 years, I've sold 9 companies, my last company I sold for $46.2 million

[00:05] dollars.

[00:06] My current portfolio at Acquisars.com is over $17 million a month and I'm going to compress 13

[00:10] years of business advice into this one video.

[00:12] Number one, have something extremely expensive to sell that you never even plan on selling.

[00:18] I learned about this anchoring tactic from a friend of mine and he said, listen man,

[00:25] you can just put something on your menu of items or services that you sell that's 10 or

[00:29] 100 times more expensive.

[00:32] And just by having it there, it'll anchor everything else on your menu or the rest of the

[00:36] prices that you have.

[00:38] And just make it something that if someone actually bought it, you'd be stoked that they

[00:42] did.

[00:43] But what ends up happening is that one, you'll sell more people on your core offer because

[00:48] they have this big price anchor.

[00:50] Second, it allows you to nudge up your main offers price because related to the big one, it looks

[00:55] like almost nothing.

[00:56] I was talking to a different friend of mine and I said, hey, you should consider just

[01:00] adding one of these things in and he had a weight loss business.

[01:02] So very generic online weight loss business.

[01:04] And so he added a six times higher price version of his offer and then the craziest

[01:11] thing happened, people started buying that more than his core offer.

[01:16] And when he did that, he tripled his profit overnight.

[01:20] And so the thing is is that it also breaks you, especially if you're starting in business

[01:25] out of this fear of raising prices by just saying, hey, there's no way anyone's going

[01:30] to buy this.

[01:31] I'm going to make this so expensive, no one's going to buy it.

[01:33] And that's okay.

[01:34] So you give yourself permission to just fly it out there.

[01:37] But what you will find is that 10% of customers just want to buy the most expensive thing.

[01:42] These are the whales.

[01:43] And the only thing worse than making a thousand dollar offer to somebody with a hundred

[01:46] dollar budget is making a hundred dollar offer to someone with a thousand dollar budget.

[01:51] And the first scenario you'll lose a hundred bucks in the second scenario you'll lose

[01:54] nine hundred dollars of the money that you should have made, but didn't number two, no one

[01:59] knows you exist, advertised more.

[02:02] And so to give you context on this, when I walk through the streets, I usually get

[02:07] stopped four or five times on like a 60 minute walk.

[02:11] And when I was launching my book last year, I had, you know, 500,000 plus people who are

[02:16] registered as massive event, broke the internet, whatever.

[02:20] But during the month leading up to it, we're advertising on all channels, we're running

[02:23] ads.

[02:24] We've got affiliates that are pumping it, I'm making content all over the place.

[02:28] And over the four weeks of people that stopped me, only one person knew that I had a book

[02:34] coming out.

[02:36] And so every time I see somebody like, hey, you're going to be at the book launch, and they're

[02:38] like, oh, you have a book.

[02:40] And I was like, how can you not know that I have a book?

[02:42] There's a story from Henry Ford that I love, which is that he was walking by his the CMO

[02:47] of Ford was right next to his office.

[02:50] And every day he'd walked by and he'd see the marketing campaign.

[02:52] He'd see the marketing campaign a day after day after day.

[02:54] And so three months into seeing the same campaign, he knocked on a CMO's door to he's like,

[02:58] hey, when we can stop running this thing, he's like, I'm getting exhausted to see it.

[03:02] And the guy just looked at me was like, we haven't started running it yet.

[03:05] And so the thing is, is that we get so sick of our advertising so much before our customers

[03:10] or potential customers even remember our names.

[03:13] And so the extent of advertising that you have to do, there are so many people in the

[03:18] world and people's attention is so spread then and so they're so distracted that in

[03:23] the off chance you actually do get an advertisement of some port in front of them, the

[03:27] likely that they remember that it was even you and the core message of that advertising

[03:31] is even lower.

[03:32] And so many of us have this big fear that we're harassing our audience by repeating ourselves

[03:37] over and over and over again.

[03:39] But the vast majority of the time, no even A, no's you exist or B, specifically, knows

[03:43] the message that you're trying to let them know.

[03:45] And so I like to tell my team and remind myself that we need to be reminded more than we

[03:50] need to be taught.

[03:51] And so your audience needs to be reminded more than you need to be taught.

[03:54] And I don't know about you but I follow plenty of accounts where like they have the same

[03:56] four or five messages more or less that they put out there.

[03:59] And the reason I follow them is because I like the reminder.

[04:01] I like to be reminded to be patient.

[04:03] I like to be reminded to not think, take things too seriously.

[04:06] I like to be reminded that I have to think long.

[04:08] Like there's other things that I like to be reminded of.

[04:10] And so imagine if that accounts like I already said B patient once I don't want to say it again,

[04:14] they've already heard that from it.

[04:15] It's like no, people have messages that they want to continue to get fed into.

[04:18] And every time you feed that same message that they like before back into them, they'll

[04:22] have another positive experience with you.

[04:24] The amount of novelty that's required and content is significantly less than you think

[04:28] as a creator.

[04:29] Think about it like you're going after a girl.

[04:32] And she's with somebody right now.

[04:34] All right.

[04:35] So you're like, okay, well, I'm going to ease off.

[04:36] But I'm just going to let them know.

[04:38] I'm just going to throw these little flares out there that I'm interested in here.

[04:41] I'm not being disrespectful, but I'm available.

[04:44] And then what happens is as soon as she gets out of that relationship or whatever, then

[04:49] she's receptive to your message.

[04:51] And so the thing is the same way it works with customers is that they might not be looking

[04:53] for a marketing solution.

[04:54] They might not be looking for a plumbing solution.

[04:56] They might not be looking for an IT services provider for three months, six months, nine

[05:02] months.

[05:03] But they might like to hear your stuff.

[05:04] But the moment they are in the market, you're the first one they think of because

[05:07] you continued to repeat the messages that resonated with them to begin with.

[05:12] The big thing is the 4x4, all right, which is especially when you're starting out

[05:17] four hours a day doing the core 4.

[05:20] And so the core 4 means you're reaching out to people.

[05:21] You know one on one, reaching out to strangers, one on one, making content, one to

[05:26] many, or running ads, one to many.

[05:28] And so there's the 4 ways.

[05:29] The only things one person can do to let other people know about their stuff.

[05:32] And so I use the Rule of 100 as my guide there, which means you either make 100 minutes

[05:37] of content.

[05:38] You do 100 hour reaches so either colder warm or, or and, if you want to get really

[05:43] spicy, or at least $100 a day of advertising.

[05:46] Now, obviously the $100 that you can scale as much as you want.

[05:48] But as a baseline for anybody who's starting a business, those are three ways that you

[05:52] can just say, okay, what do I have to do to let more people know about my stuff?

[05:56] If you're not making 100 minutes of content, you're not doing 100 hour reaches a day where

[06:00] you're not spending $100 a day at ads, no one's going to know you exist.

[06:03] And that is the biggest threat to your business.

[06:04] The reason it's so important as a founder to do this in the business is that you have

[06:08] to be able to make it rain.

[06:10] And so every business at the most basic level has to advertise before it can have money.

[06:17] Right?

[06:18] So like if you want to make money, people cannot give you money until they know you exist.

[06:22] And so is a is a prerequisite for making money in business is that you advertise first

[06:26] and then you have a product that you can deliver on and that's the most basic form that

[06:30] you have to have.

[06:31] If you just have the product and known finds out, you will continue to not make money.

[06:34] You should lease me to number three until you're at $100,000 a month, advertising is

[06:40] all of your focus.

[06:41] And the main reason for that is if you don't have enough people coming in, you're not

[06:44] going to have enough iterations of the product to get feedback to know if your stuff's

[06:47] good or not and what you need to do to make it better.

[06:50] Now the thing is is that up to $100,000 a month, at that point it's all advertising.

[06:55] But at some point in order to continue to scale, you need to fix the product.

[06:58] You need to make sure that people are recurring, you need people make sure people are happy,

[07:01] that they're referring other people that they're staying month after month or they're

[07:04] repurchasing month after month after month after month after month.

[07:06] And so if you're not solving that, then you've got a leaky bucket and that's going to be

[07:09] a problem that you're going to do with later.

[07:11] And so the smart move is to fix that stuff now so that you can grow a really big business.

[07:15] And this is one of the biggest mistakes that I made so many times my early careers that

[07:19] you start advertising, you start understanding the sell and acquire customers and you say,

[07:23] oh, that worked.

[07:24] I'll do more of it.

[07:25] And you should do more of it.

[07:26] But within this current context of you have to make sure that you're delivering.

[07:31] And so my recommendation is get $2 million so get to $100,000 a month.

[07:34] Ish, then put all of your focus on filling all the holes in the bucket.

[07:38] So that and what thing is is that when you do that, you're actually going to keep growing

[07:41] because if you keep the same activities and then you fix the holes, you're still going

[07:44] to keep growing steadily month after month after month, even with the same level of advertising

[07:48] effort.

[07:49] Then once you fix the holes, then you go back to the front end and say, how do I

[07:52] tenix this?

[07:53] And that is how you can stare step.

[07:55] Even though your actual revenue growth will still look flat because when you fix the holes,

[07:59] you'll make more money.

[08:00] But the doingness of the business will shift.

[08:03] Now if you do the alternative of that, which is you just advertise more and more and more,

[08:07] there's going to get to a point.

[08:08] It's an asymptote.

[08:09] So basically start growing and you start plateauing like this because then your infrastructure

[08:13] is too big and there's too many moving pieces to fix the thing that you should have

[08:16] fixed earlier.

[08:17] But then you're going to rock in a hard place in there because then you can't dial back

[08:21] the advertising because you've got all these people that you've hired.

[08:23] But the more you sell, the more your reputation goes in the tank because the stuff's

[08:27] not good and so you can really hard scenario.

[08:29] And so fixing it first, fixing it early, sets you up to build a much bigger business

[08:34] later.

[08:35] Number four, under a million dollars a year, it's one channel, one avatar, one product.

[08:41] I see way too many small business owners saying, hey, I've got two businesses, all right,

[08:44] seven products or I have two different avatars or a bubble, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[08:47] Right.

[08:48] Now, focus on one specific type of customer.

[08:50] And if you just say, yes, to everyone with money, you're basically saying, no to your

[08:53] business because you're never going to be able to focus and make something really good.

[08:56] You can't serve six customers and then make a good product only doing it for $1 a month.

[08:59] It's just like it's too small volume, like you don't get enough reps.

[09:03] And so you need to do one very specific thing, which means you have to say, no to people

[09:06] aren't that type of person.

[09:07] You serve one problem, which means you have one product for that specific avatar and you

[09:11] get better and better at templatizing it, at productizing the service or product site, whatever

[09:16] the product is itself, making iterations on it and you advertise through one channel, meaning

[09:20] you just know how to make cold email convert or you just know how to make cold

[09:23] cost convert or you just know how to make a TikTok ads convert or you just know how to make

[09:27] YouTube videos that convert.

[09:28] Whenever your channel is you just stick with that channel because as soon as you're like,

[09:31] oh, I'm going to do two different things.

[09:33] That's not the objective of this stage.

[09:35] You just need to get it reliable so that you can then keep tweaking the product so that

[09:39] then you can 10x the existing channel you're on.

[09:42] Once you get to about a million a month is when I recommend starting to think about

[09:46] second and tertiary channels of getting customers.

[09:48] And part of the reason I recommend that is that when you start a second channel, it's

[09:52] going to cost you money and it's going to cost you time.

[09:54] And so the reason that you keep that one channel and keep doing it longer than you think

[09:58] is because you need to be able to get it working at the same level or higher with not

[10:02] you doing it.

[10:03] So that you can have the secondary channel.

[10:05] If you're the one who's gassing this first channel and then you move to the second,

[10:09] well now you have this second one that's not going to be working out nearly as efficiently

[10:13] as the first one, especially in the beginning.

[10:15] The first three months, six months, it's not going to be cranking like the first one

[10:18] is.

[10:19] But the first one's also going to go down because you're not there.

[10:21] And so you spend the extra time there, you put the right people in place, you make sure

[10:26] the training is such that they actually can meet or exceed what you were doing on your own.

[10:32] And then when you start the second channel, you can pour resources into it because you

[10:35] still have cash flow from your main thing.

[10:37] And that little switch is where most people get lost and they just crush their businesses.

[10:41] So don't do that.

[10:42] So to give you guys some context, I didn't open up a second channel of acquisition until

[10:46] we were at 4 million a month.

[10:47] Now mind you, I started with paid ads because I was good at paid ads and I learned how

[10:52] to run paid ads in my local business, which then when I went national, I knew how to do

[10:56] the same skill set.

[10:57] But after 4 million a month, I was like, okay, I need to get this second channel going.

[11:02] And so I started increasing that channel via cold email, cold call, cold DMs with an

[11:08] outbound team.

[11:09] But I say that because a lot of people like should not do this, I tried to lay that as

[11:13] long as I possibly can because I know it's going to cost a huge amount of money and it

[11:17] might not work for six to 12 months.

[11:19] And to give you context, it took me 12 months for outbound to be responsible for half

[11:24] of my revenue.

[11:26] So it's not going to happen overnight.

[11:27] Number five, always start for free, always.

[11:31] And I know, and I don't usually use explicit 100% black and white language.

[11:36] But I have yet to see a time where starting for free has not made me more money.

[11:41] So let me explain.

[11:42] So when I started my fitness business, way back when I started with free, I wanted to get

[11:48] people results.

[11:49] And I said, I don't have any experience.

[11:51] So please let me just train you for free.

[11:54] And because of that, I have lower stakes because they didn't pay me money.

[11:57] They're still paying in other ways.

[11:58] They're still paying time.

[11:59] They're paying inconvenience.

[12:00] All the other things that a customer has to do, those costs are still there.

[12:03] By the way, those hidden costs are the things that you want to decrease as much as you can

[12:07] in your product so that you can charge more money because you'll find over time that the

[12:11] most expensive thing about your product often isn't the price.

[12:15] It's everything else you require customer to do as a result of the purchase, which is

[12:19] what things do they have to give up that they like doing as a result of the purchase?

[12:22] And what are the things that they have to start doing that they hate doing as a result

[12:25] of the purchase?

[12:26] And this happens with everything.

[12:27] And when I say like and hate, I use those as extremes.

[12:30] But fundamentally, there's some sort of friction, there's some sort of inconvenience.

[12:33] Like when I buy a car, I have to now get gas.

[12:35] That is now an inconvenience in my life.

[12:37] Now compared to all other cars, maybe all cars that have that inconvenience.

[12:41] So they have an electric car.

[12:42] And all of a sudden, that inconvenience has been removed because I can plug the car

[12:45] in at night.

[12:46] So I'm a co-winner of school.com.

[12:47] And I talk to beginner entrepreneurs a lot.

[12:52] And so I see this happening more often than not, which is that they say, hey, no one wants

[12:57] to buy my thing.

[12:58] And I say, okay, well, where's your testimonials, where are the people that you've used

[13:03] before this that you've helped get the result?

[13:04] And they're like, well, I don't have any.

[13:06] I'm like, well, why would I believe you?

[13:07] They're like, well, I have this amazing offer.

[13:09] And I'm going to talk about this in number six at length.

[13:13] But if you don't start for free, why should anyone believe you?

[13:17] And if you are doing this for the first time, why would you want to take money for something

[13:21] that you don't even know if it's good yet?

[13:23] And so this can both give you the conviction and give you the confidence to get going because

[13:27] you actually have some results that you can go off of.

[13:29] You can use those results to market and get more customers.

[13:31] I do this at every level of business.

[13:33] And so everything that I do, I always start with free, no matter what it is.

[13:39] And whether it's a new product line and a massive company, one of our portfolio companies,

[13:42] we built out a software product for the existing service base.

[13:46] And so we said, hey, we can now have a DIY version of our services that you can use with

[13:51] the software product.

[13:52] And what do we do?

[13:53] We started for free.

[13:54] We took our top 100 customers and said, hey, want you to try it out.

[13:56] Let us know, get us feedback.

[13:58] And they just kept giving us feedback.

[13:59] And honestly, in the beginning, the fact that some people want to charge for this is insane.

[14:03] It's like they're giving so much valuable stuff.

[14:05] I'm just happy that they use it.

[14:08] And so you go with free and then you go with a small amount of money and then you keep raising

[14:13] your prices over time, which I'll get to in a second.

[14:15] And for those of you who are worried about your pocketbook, like I'm fronting all these

[14:18] costs, well, yeah, that's why it's called investing in a business.

[14:21] But people who you work with for free can make you money in three ways.

[14:25] Number one is they can leave you a testimonial.

[14:27] Number two is they can refer you other customers via a word of mouth that you did a good

[14:30] job.

[14:31] And number three, they can actually stay on and pay after certain period of time when you do

[14:36] make it not free and you make it for money.

[14:39] Because if you want to keep surfacing and this ideally how it works out is that you do

[14:43] such a good job that they're like, I don't want this to stop and then you say great,

[14:46] now you can do an exchange for money because I can't do this anymore and exchange for nothing.

[14:51] Because I have enough demand because I've done a good job that I have these referrals

[14:55] and I have this proof that people do want to pay me for my services.

[14:57] So if you'd like that too, you can get the same price they have.

[15:00] Number six, and this is a big one, proof over promise.

[15:04] So what a lot of beginners do and they read 100 million dollar offers and they're like,

[15:08] I have a grand slam offer and so because of that, I've got this big thing with all these

[15:12] bonuses and the stack and these guarantees and I've got a premium price and yet no one's

[15:17] buying it.

[15:18] So what I want to do is walk you through a hypothetical.

[15:20] Let's say on one extreme, we've got somebody who has an amazing crazy awesome offer for

[15:24] whatever.

[15:25] They promise you the world and beyond.

[15:28] On this extreme, same core product or core service as the first guy except he has no crazy

[15:35] offer, he just has 1000 testimonials.

[15:38] Who is going to get the most customers?

[15:41] This guy.

[15:43] And so your proof is going to do more selling than any promise can possibly do because

[15:48] the promise is all function as an approximation of the likelihood that they're going to

[15:53] get a result and proof is always going to be more compelling.

[15:56] And so when you're starting out, you want to capture as much proof as seemingly possible.

[16:01] Now I have a huge amount of stuff on proof because I'm obsessed with that.

[16:05] But I'll give you four very good things that you can do to make your proof more compelling.

[16:10] Number one, recent proof is better than delayed proof.

[16:13] So if proof was five years old, proof that's from last week is going to be more compelling.

[16:18] Second, is you want it to be as visual as possible.

[16:20] So just a bunch of words on a screen is less compelling than a screen shot of someone's

[16:25] bank account after they made money.

[16:26] Or someone saying, hey, I lost 20 pounds is not as compelling as the picture of them losing

[16:31] 20 pounds, which is also less compelling than a video of them weighing in.

[16:36] And then a video of them weighing out.

[16:38] The third component for proof that I'll give you is you want high volume.

[16:41] And the nice thing is that most businesses actually have a lot more proof than they know

[16:44] they do.

[16:45] They just never capture it.

[16:46] And so one of the things that I did in our brick and mortar chains that we've had with

[16:49] all of the gems I do across all brick and mortar is if you look at yelp, you look at Google,

[16:54] you look at Facebook.

[16:55] All of these have reviews for your business.

[16:58] And so for me, and if you're digital, then you have Facebook reviews on your Facebook page

[17:02] and things like that.

[17:03] And so I would go into the stars, you click into it, and there's like a hundred of them,

[17:07] and then you just screenshot each one of them.

[17:09] So if you have a hundred, five-door reviews on yelp, that's like a mediocre yelp account,

[17:14] right?

[17:15] But if I screenshot a hundred of those and then I frame them and I put them on my lobby wall

[17:19] from floor to ceiling, it's overwhelming, the amount of proof that is.

[17:22] And so most businesses have way more proof than they think they do, they just don't leverage

[17:26] it.

[17:27] And so one of the easiest things you can do, take the screenshots of all review sites across

[17:32] all platforms, show them individually, and show them as your new wallpaper.

[17:36] And the fourth element of proof is that you want to capture pain.

[17:39] And so let me explain by this.

[17:40] So I've been able to look at a zillion ads across all companies where they have testimonial

[17:45] ads from customers or user-generated content to be fancy.

[17:48] The thing is is the content that begins with pain converts significantly higher.

[17:55] And so this is my theory around this, which is that the pain relates to the customer or

[18:01] prospect where they're currently at.

[18:02] If they start with the promise, it's too far disconnected.

[18:06] But if you start with pain, they relate to the person, and then you can take them through the story

[18:10] of them getting the result.

[18:12] But if you start with the end result, it's too disjointed, it's too far away, it becomes less believable.

[18:16] So if you had to pick between proof or promise, double down on proof.

[18:20] And that's also the reason that I tell everyone to start with giving stuff away for free

[18:24] because it's the easiest and fastest way to get tons of it.

[18:27] Best time to ask someone for testimonials at the moment of greatest satisfaction.

[18:30] All right, so that's also by the way different from the best time to sell.

[18:34] All right, because you want to sell at the moment of greatest pain,

[18:37] you want to get a testimony at the moment of greatest satisfaction.

[18:40] So think about this way.

[18:41] If I were to say, hey, you have a stick dinner, and you have a stick in your star,

[18:45] and you're like, oh, this is great.

[18:46] Mama, mama, mama.

[18:47] The moment to sell you the stick is right before you've had the stick, and then you eat the stick.

[18:50] Now after you have the stick, is that the moment that I say it would you like another stick?

[18:54] Not really, because you're like, I'm full, I'm good.

[18:56] So that's the point of greatest satisfaction.

[18:58] Not the point of greatest deprivation.

[18:59] Now after I've had the stick, if I say, hey, would you mind

[19:02] like looking in the camera and say how great the stick was?

[19:04] People are like, oh my god, it was amazing.

[19:05] It was so great.

[19:06] You guys should definitely check this place out.

[19:07] It's awesome, right?

[19:08] And so point of greatest deprivation is when you make your sale,

[19:12] point of greatest satisfaction is when you collect your proof.

[19:14] Number seven, raising prices almost always makes you more money,

[19:19] but you hear no more often.

[19:20] And so let me break this down.

[19:22] So I had a sales guy in one of our portfolio companies,

[19:25] and we doubled the price of our product.

[19:28] So a lot of people are like really afraid of like 10% or 20% increases,

[19:31] like I'll test 4x 5x price differences.

[19:35] Pricing in many instances is for more inelastic than you think it is.

[19:39] All right, so elastic versus inelastic pricing.

[19:41] I'm not going to get into that.

[19:42] But basically, if you have a $5 sandwich going to $10 sandwich,

[19:45] there's a lot of elasticity with food,

[19:47] meaning people are very responsive to small increases in price.

[19:50] The classic counter example is if you have a life-saving medication,

[19:54] it's not very elastic at all,

[19:56] meaning if you double the price, people still are going to pay for it

[19:58] because they need to live.

[20:00] And so the thing is is that if you have a very

[20:01] novel thing, the price is usually a lot more flexible than you think.

[20:06] It is in terms of how much you can move it up.

[20:09] And so I like making massive price tests,

[20:12] but the thing that you have to have when you do this is the balls or the

[20:16] stomach to deal with more nose.

[20:19] And so when I walked that sales team through the price increase,

[20:23] I said, hey, we're going to double the price,

[20:24] I said, you have to understand that we're for sure going to get less or fewer

[20:30] guesses.

[20:31] But the question is, will we get half the guesses?

[20:34] So we had a 35% reduction in conversion percentage,

[20:39] but we doubled the price.

[20:41] And so we made more money in multiple ways.

[20:44] So one, we made more absolute revenue.

[20:46] We literally just made more top line.

[20:48] But the magic of this is that let's say the cost of our thing was $500,

[20:51] and we sold the thing for $1,000.

[20:54] Okay, so we have 50% margins.

[20:55] Well, if we double the price, we go from making $500 in profit to $1,500 in profit.

[21:01] So actually triple the amount of money I make by doubling my price.

[21:05] And so even if I have a 35% reduction or a 1-third reduction in sales,

[21:10] I tripled how much money I made on the other two-thirds of my sales,

[21:14] which means me doubling the price with a 1-third reduction in sales,

[21:19] still doubled the profit in absolute amounts,

[21:22] despite selling one-third fewer customers.

[21:24] And one of the nice benefits of having fewer customers is that you have fewer

[21:29] costs associated with delivering on them.

[21:31] So not only is the gross margin per customer higher,

[21:35] your fixed costs that you have to incur to continue to expand your infrastructure

[21:40] go down.

[21:41] And fundamentally, a smaller amount of customers that make more money

[21:44] is an easier business to run than more customers that make you less money.

[21:48] And let me tell you how important this is.

[21:50] I've seen businesses that have not changed their prices for five, six, seven years,

[21:53] right, because they're afraid to do it, whatever.

[21:55] But I want to give you some real hard truth right now.

[21:59] In 2017, if you sold something for $100, that was your only product,

[22:03] and you were running 20% margins as a business.

[22:05] If you did not change your price from 2017 until 2024,

[22:08] that $100 means that you're costing that business have gone up by 20%.

[22:13] Which means that your profit is now zero.

[22:15] And so if you feel like your margins continue to compress year after year after year,

[22:20] it's usually because you're not appropriately adjusting your prices.

[22:23] So to give you context, $79 in 2017 is the equivalent of $100 today.

[22:30] And so that would be like you going back in time where you had a 20% margin business

[22:35] and running it at a $79 price point rather than a $100 price point.

[22:39] And so you just like that eliminate all the profit in the business.

[22:42] And so you have to do the reverse of that because inflation is a compounding threat

[22:47] to your business that every year stacks on top of itself.

[22:50] And so if you're not making $36% increases in prices at least annually,

[22:55] you're not even keeping up with inflation.

[22:57] And to give you a little story around this,

[22:59] Warren Buffett, when he bought CS candies, said that he only wanted to control one thing.

[23:04] And so what that one thing was is that every year,

[23:06] he would look at all the prices of all the candies and huge ship them, the new pricing.

[23:11] And he is raised prices 50 years in a row.

[23:14] Sometimes in a single year as high 17% on to their pricing.

[23:19] And as a result of that, he's cleared himself a billion dollars in profit.

[23:23] And so if it was the one thing that he focused so hard on, it might be something worth thinking about.

[23:27] So if you do make a pricing change, there's two components to this.

[23:31] One is new customers. The other is old customers.

[23:33] The easiest thing to do is just change the price and just apply to everyone who's new.

[23:37] That's simple. And if you're in a transactional business, then it's fine.

[23:40] Even because the old customers come back and buy again.

[23:43] But if someone's on some sort of recurring service, it's a little bit trickier.

[23:47] Now, I have some tactics around this, but I'll just give you the high levels.

[23:50] Which is you want to have a pricing crease letter.

[23:52] You want to talk about all the things that they're going to get as a result of the investment that you're now making into the business.

[23:58] And that it's the only way that you'll be able to stay in business, give an inflationary pressures, etc.

[24:02] All right. And so you just want to say, here's the thing.

[24:05] Here's the stuff you're going to get.

[24:07] I want to keep my promise to you, which is to keep our thing as good as possible.

[24:10] And only way for me to ethically keep my promise is for us to reflect that in the prices,

[24:14] which are now having to be changed effective this day.

[24:17] But don't worry. I've grandfathered you in to your old price by this time that's key.

[24:22] Is that the old customers, you say, I've grant, everyone wants to be grandfathered.

[24:25] You say, so I'm grandfathering you in until this date. And that way, it's not like it's changing tomorrow.

[24:30] It's delaying the pain and giving them a gift right now as a way of honoring the fact that they've been loyal customers to you.

[24:37] Those are the main bullets of what that price letter would go out and say.

[24:40] And if you are going to raise your prices, you want to be measured about it.

[24:44] You should know what your conversion rates are, prior to you making the price change.

[24:48] And you should be able to give a statistically significant sample size of shots on goal with the new price

[24:55] before you make a decision. If you get on the phone and the first two people say, no, well, we

[25:00] won, new more people are going to say, no, we already expected that. And if you have, call it 40%

[25:05] close rates right now. Well, if you make double the price and you go to 30% close rates, then that's still a great deal for you.

[25:12] You might just be getting the first two nose out of the seven nose you already know you're going to get when you talk to 10 people.

[25:17] And so talking to two or three people getting nose doesn't mean you need to change your price.

[25:20] It might have just been the nose you're normally going to get even at your lower price.

[25:24] And so you can't be emotional about this. You have to be calculated. And this, in my opinion, is the reason most people don't raise their prices

[25:30] or can't do it successfully. Number eight, talk to customers to solve all your

[25:34] problems. So Paul Graham said this and I think it's really good. He said you can solve just about every business problem

[25:39] by talking to your customers. So if you're advertising is in converting, talk to your customers.

[25:43] If you're pages aren't converting, talk to your customers. If the price seems weird, talk to your customers.

[25:49] If the product isn't delivering, talk to your customers. At the end of the day, your customers will

[25:53] the people you serve and they have all the information you need to make your product better. So

[25:59] especially when you're starting out even if you have very low prices. So let's say you charge $10

[26:05] a month for something. And you want this thing to have thousands and thousands of customers. Okay, fine.

[26:11] But if you don't talk to customers, you're not going to know what's going to drive them to convert

[26:17] by and stay. And so I come from an industry where people meet face to face in person to sell

[26:23] $10 a month memberships. And so I don't want to hear it. All right, I spent the first four

[26:27] five years of my career selling $30. $50, $100 things all day long. I don't know a very successful

[26:36] advertising entrepreneur who's a rainmaker, meaning they know how to get customers, who didn't have

[26:41] four or five years of hard core sales under their belt that know new who they were. Right,

[26:46] that's the Rocky Cutscene is where you take hundreds and thousands of calls with customers,

[26:50] or you hear the words they use so that when you you say does this suck, but they say it differently.

[26:57] And so then you save that in your advertising. And when you take these sales costs for $10 a month,

[27:01] you're not doing it for the $10 a month. You're doing it so that you can learn more about them.

[27:05] And you just so happen to get paid. But you find out the words that get them to move. Because you

[27:10] might think these are all the selling points to your thing. But when you're talking to them,

[27:14] nothing really happens. Then you say one thing and then boom, they're isolated up and they're like,

[27:17] yeah, that. And then all of a sudden you reorder your sales scripts, you reorder your headlines.

[27:21] You reorder the road map on the things that you're going to improve in the product because

[27:25] these are actually the things that are driving purchases for the first purchase and getting them to stay.

[27:31] And so most entrepreneurs are afraid to talk to customers. I have no idea why that is.

[27:36] They're afraid to talk to random people who are given the money. I don't get it.

[27:41] But one of the easiest ways you can learn more about your business and make more money is pick up the

[27:46] phone and call people who've given you money and ask them why they did. And just as importantly,

[27:50] maybe more importantly, talk to all the people who didn't buy it and ask them why they did it.

[27:55] And if you think you're above this, you're right. You should just keep doing that.

[27:59] But for everybody who wants to beat that guy, just get on the phone with your customers.

[28:02] So inside of school.com, we run a contest every month where the top 10 people who are new to the

[28:07] platform who generate the most revenue in their communities, get to fly out to Vegas and spend

[28:12] a day with me and Sam is the other owner of school. And part of the reason we do this is that,

[28:17] of course, it's a great prize for all the winners and they get to meet each other and it's an awesome event.

[28:21] But for us, we get such valuable user feedback from super users. These are the highest, most invested

[28:27] users. And so we're like, hey, do you like this thing? Hey, this is the product room. Hey,

[28:32] would you prioritize this service? So recently, we used the feedback from the group. We said,

[28:36] hey, we have this thing that could be controversial with the rest of the community because we could

[28:40] see people taking it like this. If we made this change in the product, what would you guys think?

[28:45] And unanimously, they're like, oh, no, that would make us more money. We're totally in for it.

[28:49] And so we're like, wow. And so months of deliberation of like, oh, do you think they'll like it?

[28:54] I don't know if they like it. Would if they don't like it? All of that got soft, I just asking them.

[28:58] And then we got our answer. And then we did it and everyone was happy. And so the beauty of this is

[29:02] that you get certain to your run your decisions. And so you can make decisions faster. And the

[29:06] entrepreneurs who make faster decisions move faster. And when you do talk to customers,

[29:11] whether it's in person like this school event that I was talking about or just on the phone,

[29:15] what do you think happens to them? You can take someone from a neutral customer to a super fan

[29:19] in one call. You can tell the story of the business. You can tell them why they started.

[29:23] You show that you care. And guess what? That person might bring you 10 or 50 more people when you think

[29:29] too rose down the line of word of mouth referrals. And of course, the problem is stay way longer

[29:33] than they would otherwise. Because if they do have an issue, guess what they're going to do.

[29:36] Instead of canceling, they're going to call you and let you know. A great time to do this that a lot

[29:40] of people don't like is that the moment people ask to cancel. So if you have any kind of recurring

[29:45] membership or if they ask for a refund, if you have one time transactions, get on the phone with them.

[29:49] And it's not necessarily to try and like, you know, hard sell them back into it, which by all

[29:53] means you can. But the more valuable thing is to understand what went wrong. And you be surprised. How

[29:59] many times you just let someone vent and here's the key. Don't minimize what they said.

[30:03] Get more angry about the reason they're canceling than they are. Because you're like,

[30:07] that's ridiculous. That should never happen to you. I can't believe that was your experience.

[30:11] I completely understand why you'd want to refund. I would want to refund 10 times over. I'm

[30:14] surprised you're not trying to put me in jail. I get it. Is there a world that I can make this

[30:19] right? Or what would it take for me? Is it the question? What would it take for me to make this right?

[30:24] And so now you get into them solving what it would cost or what it would take for them to stay.

[30:28] And more times than not, it's not as big as you think. You want to talk to all sorts of customers.

[30:32] You want to talk to the super users. You want to talk to the moderators and you want to talk to the

[30:35] low users. But you're going to get different things out of it. I'm not going to prioritize a road map

[30:39] or things that I'm going to reinvest in the business based on people who are not that invested in the

[30:42] business. I'm going to talk to the super users who are getting the most out of it because they're

[30:45] going to have more context. But in terms of what problem I want to solve for these people, it's like,

[30:50] why didn't this work for you? So this would be stuff that's like friction. So this is going to be

[30:54] way more about getting new customers. I'm going to solve new customer problems by finding out what

[30:57] people didn't buy or bought and then left. And then I'm going to figure out how to make my customers

[31:02] more valuable and get them to stay longer by talking to super users and your super fans or the

[31:07] best customers you have about what would make this even better. Number nine, what to say to prospects

[31:13] on the phone when you're just starting to get your first sales? So I use something called the

[31:17] Closer framework. I'll make it very short. But the call should go something like this. See. So

[31:22] Closer is an acronym. See, clarify why they're there. So what made you hop on the call? What made

[31:27] you take a step? What made you respond to my email? What made you comment on my post? Whatever it is,

[31:31] they took an action to become an engaged lead and that is your advantage because any person that

[31:36] you get on the phone with with the exception of a true, true cold call first pickup with the

[31:41] exception of that. Everyone has responded to an email. They've come to an opposed. They've responded

[31:46] to an ad. They've opted in whatever. So you ask them why they did that. That clarifies it gives you

[31:50] also a big authority in the frame because they've taken this up towards you and you're just receiving.

[31:55] So you say, hey, why'd you do that? And then they'll tell you what it was. Then you move on to L.

[32:00] Which is like, okay, so what I'm hearing is and this is labeling with a problem. So it sounds like you

[32:04] want this and this is the problem or you want to have this outcome and you have it in God and

[32:08] you're yet. Is that sound about right? They're going to say yes. And you're like, okay, cool.

[32:12] Then you go to O and you say, you're going to overview their past experiences. You're like, okay,

[32:16] so what have you done so far to try and make this happen? Why is this so important to you? What

[32:21] else has happened in the meantime that has cost you from not having this occur? Right? And we call this

[32:27] the pain cycle. The reason you do the pain cycle before you sell something is that you want to

[32:31] temporarily increase their deprivation around that outcome. So we want to temporarily in the state

[32:37] of the conversation increase how important that outcome is for them. So you've probably heard in

[32:42] politics whatever the topic is of the debate. It's like it's the economy. It's education. It's the

[32:49] border. Right? Whatever media puts more attention on is what people say is the main reason they vote

[32:55] for candidates. They basically make that the topic of the election which is the macroeconomic

[32:59] situation or whatever. Right? When you're in a micro event like a sales call, you have

[33:05] sometimes 10 minutes, sometimes an hour. To basically in that very small call, elevate the importance of

[33:12] that problem in their life so that you can motivate action. They were kind of hungry when they

[33:16] get on the call but as you talk about the food that they could be having and the bad food they've

[33:20] been eating every single day and how crappy it is and how it's not good for them and how tasty and

[33:25] delicious this food is. What do we do? We're increasing their deprivation. We're making them

[33:29] hunger so that when we make our offer they're more likely to take it which then goes to ask

[33:34] which is you sell the vacation. And the reason I say sell the vacation not the plain flight is

[33:39] most salespeople. Most new entrepreneurs want to focus on their features. They want to talk about

[33:43] the flight. They want to talk about TSA. They want to talk about check-in. They want to talk about

[33:46] their bags. They want to talk about their seat. All of these things that are on the way to Maui,

[33:51] their destination. You want to just talk about Maui. You want to talk about the liquor fingers good.

[33:56] What it's going to be like when they have a full stomach and they're feeling great with their family

[34:00] at the restaurant. That's what we want to talk about. We don't want to talk about how they're

[34:04] going to order it. We don't want to talk about the selection. We don't want to talk about how many times

[34:08] they're going to get their drinks refilled. We don't want to talk about any of that. We want to talk about

[34:11] Maui. We want to talk about being on the beach with the wind in their hair, with the mytion hand.

[34:16] That's what we want to talk about. Sell the vacation typically is a three point pitch which is,

[34:21] by the way, you can separate anything into three points. Right. Now you just chunk up or chunk down

[34:25] based on hey, what does it take to be successful? It's like you need fitness, nutrition,

[34:29] accountability. You need the leads to be timely, personalized, and qualified. Right. Whatever it is.

[34:34] So it doesn't matter what you're selling. You can come up with three points and the people have to say,

[34:38] yeah, if I had all three of those things, I would succeed. Now at that point, someone doesn't say,

[34:42] yes, you move on to you, which is explained away their concerns, which are what are the specifics they have

[34:46] that are the reasons that they're not buying, which is usually going to be some sort of specifics about the

[34:51] program, something time related, something money related, something decision-maker related, I mean, they have to

[34:57] give the decision-making authority to somebody else or finally, them just simply avoiding the decision

[35:02] for fear of making a mistake. And so you need to account for all five of those and know how to overcome

[35:06] each of them, which I cover in a four hour plus video that you can watch on my channel somewhere else.

[35:12] R is reinforced the decision. So once they have made the decision to buy, you're not done yet.

[35:16] Now the work begins, which is the next 24 hours is crucial to making sure that they feel really

[35:22] loud and impressed with your business. Most customers will judge your business based on the first

[35:26] 24 hours post purchase. And so if you say, hey, I'm going to get you three things the next 24 hours,

[35:31] you're going to get introduced to this person. She's going to do this and this is going to happen next.

[35:35] Then you make those promises and you keep those promises within that time frame. And ideally,

[35:39] you do it even faster than you promised. You want their question to be like, man, these guys are dial.

[35:43] The closer framework is simple that simple enough that you can teach it to somebody else. And when I was

[35:47] starting in my gym journey, I had sold every single membership for a year plus. And until I had

[35:54] somebody else come in who had never sold weight loss and have them follow the CLO SER framework

[36:02] in the sales pitch. And then saw them close their first sale without me. I like, I actually cried.

[36:07] I was like, so as I go, my God, I someone else can sell this. This may actually be a business.

[36:13] And so learning to sell in this framework also makes it duplicatable so that you can give it

[36:18] to somebody else over time. Number 10, this is big. Before you even think about doing something new,

[36:24] do 10 times more of what's already working. And so this is like one of the things as soon as I buy

[36:28] a portfolio company, what I'll do is I go to the head of marketing, I go to the founder and I say, hey,

[36:34] why can't we 10x for what we're currently doing? Tell me why we can't. Honestly, two times out of three,

[36:39] they're like, I mean, we could. And I'm like, why aren't we doing that? And what happens is they have

[36:43] all these other priorities that are not going to 10x the business. And they have this one thing that we

[36:48] already know works that that we have nothing that's stopping us from 10xing the business. And I say,

[36:53] great, let's do that. Call me in six months. Now, the thing is is in the one out of three times

[36:58] for the say, well, we can't 10x this because of this thing. Then I say, guess what the constraint of

[37:03] this business is? Solving that. And if you're doing anything but solving that, then you're not

[37:09] growing the business right as a founder. Rather, you're not growing it as fast as you could be growing it.

[37:14] You're doing outbound. It's a great. Why can't we do 10 times the outbound? Well, I don't have

[37:18] enough leads from lists. Okay, great. So our constraint of 10xing this business is that we need to find

[37:23] more sources for lists. So we need to, you just scrape more lists. We need to buy more lists or

[37:26] make more lists ourselves. Okay. That's solvable. Let's do that. If it's, hey, if we 10x or advertising

[37:34] dollars, like we just need to add more to the budget, oh, we can't do that because our ads aren't

[37:38] good enough. Okay, great. So we need to have more creative. That's the constraint of the business.

[37:43] If it's content, which is why can't we make 10x content or make our content 10x better or maybe

[37:50] realistically, a combination of the two, which is we're going to put out two times the content and

[37:54] rocks and trying to make it two to three times better. Great. Then just what? Now we have a sixx.

[37:58] Can we triple the content and make it three times better? Sure. Well, what do we do in the best

[38:02] content that we had that we're not doing in all the other pieces? Great. Can we templatize that

[38:07] and make that the playbook that we use with every piece of content? Great. We're not doing that.

[38:12] Cool. Let's do that. Before we do any of these other ideas that you had. And so a lot of entrepreneurs

[38:18] because it's boring to them, they figured out how to do this one thing and they think, oh, I should

[38:22] figure out how to do something else. When once you get something to work, the whole goal is to

[38:28] beat the living hell out of it. It's to squeeze every last drop from that thing that works. And

[38:33] you do as much as you possibly can as well as you possibly can before even thinking about doing

[38:38] something new. So let me walk you through the five stages of the traditional entrepreneur for

[38:42] advertising or even for business. They have something that they hear about. They think is cool.

[38:48] So they go into uninformed optimism. They're really optimistic, but they have no idea. Then they

[38:54] jump into this new thing and they become an informed pessimist. And so they find out way more about

[39:01] this thing and then they're like, wow, this is actually kind of hard. And then they go to

[39:05] stage three, which is the value of despair, where they're like, wow, this isn't working. This isn't

[39:10] what I thought it was going to be. And then what they do is dot dot dot, they start over at uninformed

[39:15] optimism because they hear something else is easier. But they miss out on step four and five,

[39:19] which is they become an informed optimist. So they say, okay, I understand how up on works. I understand

[39:24] how paid ads work. I understand how organic works and what are the things that it takes to scale and

[39:28] how much work it really is. And then finally, get to level five, which is achievement, which they

[39:32] actually achieve the goal. But most people just repeat one, two, three, one, two, three, uninformed

[39:36] optimism and for pessimism, vibe, despair, start back over. They just hit all three of those over

[39:41] and over and over again, where that's new marketing channels, new products, new businesses. And this

[39:46] is a version of the woman in the red dress is that it's always deceptive to think that the new

[39:51] thing is going to be easier. And the only reason you think it's easier is because you don't know enough.

[39:55] I wish I could just give you the scar tissue of having done that three part triangle over and

[40:00] over again. But all I can tell you is that like when I get that little tickling the back of my neck

[40:03] around like, oh, this looks exciting, it's now become a warning flag to me because I've been burned so

[40:08] many times doing it to say, oh, I must not know enough about this because everything is hard. I'll give

[40:13] you an analogy that a mentor gave me that I really liked and I think it applies to a lot of things.

[40:18] But would he was talking to me about departments in my business? He said, you have to know where the

[40:22] bodies are buried. And I was like, what do you mean by that? He said, if you've talked to like ahead of

[40:26] a department like IT or HR, legal, whatever, and they say, yep, everything's good. If you don't know

[40:32] what problems are actually going on in the department, you're too far away. And so that's in a way

[40:38] uninformed optimism. They're just telling you it's great and you don't know any better so you're

[40:42] uninformed. But you should know enough about the business to know where all the bodies are buried.

[40:46] You should know where all the skeleton of the closet are. And so if you're getting into a new thing,

[40:50] you have to know all of the ways or as many ways as you possibly can about what's going wrong.

[40:55] And once you do a little bit more research, you often find out that there's a lot of things you don't

[40:59] know about. And guess what? The thing you do know is working right now. And the likelihood that you

[41:04] do in 10 times more of that has far fewer unknowns than you doing brand new on something net new.

[41:10] Entrepreneurship already has so many risks and so much unknown.

[41:15] Basically, this talks about this. He says, we want to manage as many of the risks as we can.

[41:21] So of course, we're going to encourage some risks that are going to happen that are unforeseen

[41:25] but the risks that we know about, we want to limit to the greatest degree possible because there's

[41:29] enough risk of our business going out of business by being a business. Why take on more risk?

[41:35] For no need. It's risking what you have and need to survive for what you don't have and don't need.

[41:40] Which brings me number 11, which is growth is stressful. Stag nation is stressful.

[41:48] Decline is stressful. That means that business is stressful. And so the only stress free people are

[41:57] people who are dead. And if you're in business, you need to accept stress as a fact of life

[42:03] and not something wrong with you or wrong with your particular business.

[42:08] It's just that things are stressful in general. Welcome to life. And so I see a lot of entrepreneurs

[42:14] trying change their businesses because they feel stressed. But every scenario of business has

[42:19] stressed. They're different kinds of stress, but they're all stressful. And so the idea that

[42:23] there's something wrong with you or wrong with your business because it is stressful,

[42:27] misses the point of how business works. And I'll tell you and analogy to make this make sense.

[42:32] So if you've been in business for any period of time, think about your first business or think about

[42:36] your problems that you had two years ago or three years ago in business. You're probably like,

[42:40] oh my god, those weren't even real problems. Those were like nothing problems. Well,

[42:44] future you three years from now thinks that about your problems right now. And so I think about

[42:50] the slacks. And I think about my problems of like when I was worried about how to get trainer shop

[42:53] on time and like, you know, somebody's membership wasn't, wasn't recurring. I had train issues,

[42:58] whatever it was within the gym that I had. Those problems, I could solve those in my sleep now.

[43:05] The problems that I have are bigger. And so the thing is that you just become more enduring.

[43:10] You become tougher and your tolerance level for stress or what you deemed to be stressful goes

[43:15] up. And so it's really interesting about this is that I still have the same problems I had when I

[43:20] had a much, much, much, much smaller business. I just don't think there are problems anymore.

[43:24] And so then that means that my choice to categorize the issue as a problem is actually the greater

[43:29] source of stress than the problem itself. And if you can adopt that perspective, you can be less

[43:35] stressed as you grow and make better decisions. And so I just wanted to hit this point because

[43:40] I almost stopped and killed so many businesses early on because I thought there was something

[43:44] wrong with me or something wrong with the business because I was stressed rather than accepting

[43:48] that stress as a fact of life and then I'm going to continue to be stressed as long as I'm alive.

[43:52] So fundamentally stress comes from a versus stimulus. A stimulus that's not that's not enjoyable,

[43:56] right? But if you grow, there's tons of things that are not enjoyable about growth.

[44:02] If you're stagnating, there's tons of things that are not enjoyable stagnating. And if you're

[44:07] declining, there's tons of things that are not enjoyable about declining. So there's just always

[44:11] going to be things that you don't like. Gaze to it. Number 12, this is really tactical one. I've

[44:16] come to adopt this theory of something called the lookback window, which is that customers determine

[44:22] whether a purchase was good based on the last purchase they made. And so if you've heard the phrase

[44:28] what have you done for me lately, it basically it's phrasing for the lookback window. So let me

[44:32] even example. If you're an agency owner, right, and you start running ads for a customer. Now let's say

[44:39] the first month you charge $5,000 and they make $40,000 with your ads. They're happy, you're happy.

[44:45] The next month you charge the same $5,000 and let's say they make $5,000. Well, they're

[44:51] less happy. You're still made $5,000, but they're not thrilled. But in your mind you're like,

[44:56] why covered myself last month for eight plus months because of how much money I made them.

[45:00] And on the third month, they cancel. And you're like WTF. On the first month, I made you eight

[45:05] months worth of paying me. But the thing is is that the way that customer perceives that is the

[45:10] first month, I paid $5,000, and got $40. That was a good deal. The second month, I paid $5,000, and got $5.

[45:14] And in the third month, you know what? I don't want to risk it anymore. I'm out. And so they will

[45:20] make a judgment on the purchasing decision based on the last purchase. And so we can leverage that

[45:25] as business owners by extending the look back window, which means that the less frequently we build

[45:32] the longer people's stay. Think about this for a second. If I build every single day,

[45:37] there would likely be a day that I had not provided that customer value. And maybe there's two or

[45:40] three days in a row. And so likely they would cancel two or three days into not getting value

[45:45] being billed daily. It's pretty high. If I build annually, they would only have an opportunity to

[45:50] turn once a year. And the thing is, is at that point of turn, what would they do? Now, in the

[45:56] agency example I gave, let's say they made the 40 and the 5, and then they made 5 and 5. And let's

[46:02] say throughout the year, we had two more good months. And all in all, we made them a 100 grand,

[46:06] they paid a 60, right, or whatever. Now, when they look back, they're going to see 100 versus 60.

[46:12] But if we build monthly, those could be multiple months where they were negative or break even.

[46:16] And so the longer the window of time, you do between billings, the longer the time you have to

[46:22] provide value in access of your price. So it allows for less volatility in their business and yours.

[46:28] And so this is something that took me way too long to learn. But as much as possible, try and

[46:34] build for longer durations. And I'm not saying, get people to commit to contracts. That's not what I'm

[46:38] saying. I'm saying, trying to build upfront for longer periods of time, I'm willing to take a hit

[46:44] on some pricing, which may seem counter to what I'm saying, so that I can get higher LTV.

[46:49] Meaning, if I know that I can cut churn by 3x by reducing my price by 30% so that they can pay

[46:55] 3 months upfront, or 6 months upfront, then I'm more than happy to do that. And so there's two ways

[47:00] you can use the strategy. Strategy one is you just say, this is how we do business. And we need

[47:05] people who are committed because there's going to be volatility, and we don't want the short-term

[47:08] volatility to affect our relationship. And that's legitimate reason to do it. The other way you can do it is

[47:13] just have it as one of two options. One that has some sort of pre-payment discount that's associated

[47:17] with it, or pre-payment bonus, which is one of things I like. Some level of service, or some

[47:21] of the guarantee that comes with pre-payment that doesn't come with month to month. And by the way,

[47:25] you can add a guarantee to people who pre-pay and not to be who don't. So people want to decrease

[47:30] their risk. So I think they're taking on more risk by pre-paying. But you attenuate or you offset

[47:35] that risk by adding a guarantee. So they pay the same price, but they get a reduction in risk for

[47:40] taking on an increase amount of risk. So if you offer an annual pricing, we know across our portfolio

[47:46] because we do this in a lot of businesses. If you don't make it the default payment method and you just

[47:51] offer it, you'll get about 10 to 15 percent of people who take the pre-payed annual option. Now here's

[47:55] what's cool about that. Is that if, call it 10 percent of people take that option, you double your cash flow

[48:01] in the business because you get a 12x price on one out of 10 or one out of seven people who decide

[48:08] to buy. Well, if you do that, then you double the amount of cash you get at front. And so for many

[48:12] people and many businesses, that little change alone can allow marketing and advertising to be profitable.

[48:18] And the reason having more cash if run is helpful for a business owner is that you can offset the

[48:22] cost of advertising and the cost of sales commissions. And so you can have these costs, you have

[48:27] to incur to get the person in the door. And so if you can front load the cash from the customer,

[48:31] then it means that you can do more of that faster because something called a cash conversion

[48:35] cycle. Basically, it just means how fast do we get the cash back that I put out to get somebody new

[48:39] it? And if I can break even on that or even be profitable on that in the first seven days,

[48:43] then guess what I can do with the money? Go back and get another customer or two or five.

[48:47] Throughout my history as a business owner, I've had four periods where I had tremendous growth.

[48:53] And in each of those periods, it's where I was making more than two to three times what it cost me

[48:59] to both acquire and deliver for two customers in the first 30 days. And so what that means is,

[49:06] if I pay to get a customer and then that customer comes preloaded with the cash to deliver for him

[49:11] and get another customer and deliver that customer, then cash in the longer as they can train in the

[49:16] business, which means that I can pretty much just crank the advertising until something else breaks in my

[49:21] business. I mean, this is how I had $1,000 in my bank account in December of 2016. And then in 20 months

[49:27] was doing 4.4 million a month. Like the only way you could do that is getting it is basically

[49:32] having infinite money glitch that happens because the thing is is that the money that you want is

[49:36] out there. There's money everywhere. If you look out the window, if you look in the room you have,

[49:40] there's somebody who paints your walls, there's somebody who buys manufacturers of this

[49:44] camera, there's an electric company that funds this whole thing, there's internet, there's money

[49:48] in everything that you see with your eyes and you're afraid that there's not enough money out there.

[49:53] There is, you just have to access it and you can access it with skill by making sure that the

[49:58] price that you have and the terms that go with the purchases that you have allow you to advertise

[50:03] profitably so that you can get as many customers as you darn well please without emptying your

[50:07] pockets but by emptying theirs. Number 13, try and sell saw dust. So I was talking a really good

[50:12] front of mine who does 100 plus million a year and I was talking about this concept of saw dust,

[50:18] which is in the businesses that we have, I try and look at what are all of the assets that we

[50:23] already had at our disposal. And so with acquisition not come for example, I was talking

[50:27] him about this. I was like well I already have a building, I already have the team that runs my portfolio

[50:32] and I already have all this lead flow from companies that are not big enough to be portfolio

[50:37] companies but they're still big enough that we could help and then someday later become portfolio

[50:41] companies. Now it's like is there a way that without adding more infrastructure to my existing

[50:45] business I could use the saw dust the stuff we already have to create a product or service that

[50:51] would meet the needs of those customers. And so the saw dust analogy just comes from

[50:55] saw me a lumber mills. So they take these trees, they put them in through the lumber mills,

[51:00] they cut them up and they put them in the planks. But at the bottom, what they figured out is

[51:04] there's all the saw dust and then some very intelligent engineer was like huh we're just taking

[51:08] all the saw dust and we're throwing it out the back. Is there something we could do with this?

[51:12] Well it turns out one saw dust is great for plants and growing and putting in an emaltant things like

[51:17] that but also if we mix this with glue we have more wood planks that we can create afterwards

[51:23] just using the saw dust and the chips and so they created a whole nother revenue line from stuff

[51:28] they already had. And so right now in your business you have saw dust and it just takes a little

[51:33] bit of creativity to think how can I recompine some of these things that I'm already doing

[51:38] to then create another product line that doesn't take operational infrastructure for me to add

[51:43] to sell. And then those added product lines often are huge margin increases because it's all

[51:49] profit because it's something that you already are occurring the cost for your main business

[51:53] so that you can have this. And the key to making this work is that it cannot increase operational drag.

[51:58] If you have to do a whole nother thing in order to make this work that's not what you want. The

[52:02] idea is the saw dust is already there and then all you have to do is gather it, put the glue on it

[52:07] and then you have another product. That's the concept. I didn't buy another building. I didn't

[52:12] hire another portfolio team. It's just I used the team that already have and they come down and they

[52:17] explain what they do within our portfolio companies to these businesses so they can be on portfolio

[52:21] ready. So they understand oh this is how they market at a higher level. Oh this is how they hire at a

[52:25] higher level. Oh this is how they price. Oh this is how they sell and how they scale sales teams.

[52:30] All of those concepts already have the information and expertise within my existing portfolios

[52:36] because I do it every day. But by just having another way for people to have access,

[52:43] obviously less than a portfolio company would, to that team then I have another way to generate revenue

[52:48] without having to occur the costs associated with building out a whole other business. So the

[52:52] process that I go through is I think about all of the resources and assets that I have currently available.

[52:57] So you have to be as detailed as you can because it's usually like a tiny piece from here.

[53:02] It's the glue that we use for this part of the the log process. But then we have the sawdust from

[53:07] over here if we put those together boom we have these new logs and we have the plank making machine

[53:12] let's combine them and then we can do it ourselves. And so you have to think okay what are

[53:17] that what are the talents and the people that I have available? What are the digital assets or

[53:20] physical assets that I have available to me and is there a new way that I can combine these things?

[53:25] And so a simple one was like in in the gym space right I had brick and mortar but we were only

[53:31] using the space from 5 a.m. and then from 5 a then from 4 p.m. to 7 a.m. right.

[53:37] So that means the rest of the day if I wanted to be a more clever business owner I could say what

[53:42] businesses use a gym and turf in the middle of the day that I can rent that space to that sawdust

[53:48] that's additional revenue that basically cost me nothing. And so I would have to do say hey

[53:53] I'm available. So if you have a team training thing or you have some sort of sports thing with

[53:57] kids that goes in the middle of the day or ends by 4 then you can use my whole facility. And now

[54:02] my facility is generating revenue because I'm paying the cost of owning that facility 247 and so I

[54:07] might as well make money from that. So a different way of using that is called excess capacity.

[54:11] So if you have excess capacity like Uber is based on excess capacity people have cars the

[54:15] not using Airbnb you have an extra room it's excess capacity. These are businesses built on other

[54:21] people sawdust and you have sawdust in your business so you might as well use it yourself.

[54:25] This is really the concept of double and triple and quadruple dipping is how can I get more

[54:29] leverage from the same thing. And so I tell stories about our portfolio companies which like

[54:35] that gives me I have to do an intervention with the portfolio company either way but if I tell

[54:38] the story about it I get the double dip and use that as content. And so there are many opportunities

[54:43] we can get leverage you get more for what you put in by reusing the same thing in multiple

[54:48] different scenarios. And so most businesses have tons of these excess capacity or double and

[54:54] triple dip potentials sitting inside their business and they're not using them. The workshops

[55:01] that I talked about I get to make content from those workshops I get deal for from those workshops

[55:05] we get cash from those workshops my team gets more exposure to different types of businesses

[55:09] industry so they also get better and so there's many value additive things that stack on top of

[55:16] each other from one decision. By the way if you want to check out one of our workshops you

[55:19] can go to acquisition.com we'd love to talk to you it's for business owners only so if you don't

[55:23] have a business go to school.com and we can help you start one. Number 14 arm your sales people so

[55:28] I see two often a lot of founders and entrepreneurs have this kind of like animosity between

[55:33] their sales scene they feel like they shouldn't pay their sales scene as much though my sales

[55:36] seems so needy they only want laid-out customers they're always complaining about the leads whatever

[55:40] no like you should be the tightest with your sales team because your sales team is the life

[55:45] this is the cash flow is the life flow of your business if you don't have sales you don't have

[55:49] a business so they should get that level of a steam and honestly a huge portion of the business

[55:53] should be pretty much allocated to supporting them in doing their core activities and so one of

[55:57] the main things that I like to do is two things one I arm my sales people with an excel sheet

[56:04] that has all the pieces of content that I have that can help overcome specific concerns from customers

[56:10] and so right now if you don't have a piece of content that overcomes every main concern a customer

[56:16] has about your services or your products do it and then as soon as you do it the best converting

[56:21] of those things one you'll know because you'll get sales from them because people will DM you

[56:25] about it and be like oh I didn't know that now I'm interested take those put them into a list

[56:30] so that your sales guys have them and they can send them to customers either before they talk

[56:34] to them or after they talk to them so that they can schedule a fallup call and say hey let me

[56:38] send you this video and might explain your concerns let's let's touch base tomorrow after you

[56:42] watch it and then you can allow that content to do some of that selling for you and as soon as I

[56:47] did this with my sales team in fitness when I had weight loss customers and then in gymlaunch

[56:52] when I had gymlaunch customers our sales went up and the thing is this is nice because I didn't

[56:57] have to train any of them anymore they just now had assets and resources they could deploy

[57:02] two leads who were a little bit colder and need a little bit more selling and they wouldn't have

[57:06] to spend time on the phone they just let me do the selling for them via the content that overcome

[57:09] that specific concern now that leads me to the second one which I'll just make as number 15 which is

[57:14] really big a lot of businesses don't do this but you should unify sales and advertising so those

[57:21] should roll into the same person and so I saw this really early on in gymlaunch we had two departments

[57:27] we had a sales department and we had a marketing department and marketing always said the sales

[57:30] guys were close because many leads of this should and the sales guys always said that the leads

[57:34] weren't good enough or they didn't have enough leads right but when we unified that under a CRR

[57:39] chief revenue officer which if you're the founder that's you you then say there's really just an

[57:44] acquisition department and fundamentally as I see it advertising and sales sit on the exact same

[57:49] continuum you have low information buyers and you have high information buyers and so fundamentally

[57:55] a low information buyer needs not a lot of information or already has a certain amount of information

[57:59] to make a purchasing decision a high information buyer requires more information or doesn't have

[58:05] as much information when they start talking to you and so you have to fill in more holes fundamentally

[58:09] sales just fills in the holes that advertising failed to answer and so if you have exceptional

[58:17] best in class advertising you don't need sales it's not that they're separate departments they

[58:21] solve the same problem one just communicates one to many the other communicates one on one people

[58:27] buy real estate on the internet via auction you don't necessarily need to have sales people if you

[58:32] give a customer enough information they can make a purchasing decision that being said you're like

[58:36] wait Alex you have sales people of course I do because there's always gonna be a certain number of

[58:40] customers that I can get people to buy automatically and then there's people who still want more

[58:44] information that most likely they didn't see the advertising that answered that question and so then

[58:48] the sales person can just say oh these are the three piano keys that need to play in order to get you

[58:52] to buy great and they spill that specific information need to turn the customer from a maybe to a yes

[58:58] and so unifying the two departments is one of the highest leverage moves that you can make as a

[59:02] founder because it eliminates the cross-departmental BS it's we're all here to sell customers and so

[59:09] advertising works hand in hand with sales not in competition with them so that they can get a

[59:14] pad on the head from you or whatever directors running that department so oftentimes you are the

[59:19] chief revenue officer who's uniting both of those fronts but over time if you can find some

[59:23] one who does that that usually is the fast-tracked being CEO so kale for example at Jim launch

[59:28] became chief revenue officer right he basically stood on top of sales and marketing so that he could

[59:35] control the customers coming in the door and then once he knew how to make it rain he could run the

[59:41] business number 16 there are three legs of the stool and so every business needs three big functional

[59:46] leaders you need one person who's in charge of getting customers acquisition you need a second

[59:52] person who's in charge of delivery and getting those customers exactly what was promised and then third

[59:58] you need someone to run the internal operations of the business this is the day to day this is

[60:01] everything we do to support the other two functions so this is IT legal HR these are the things

[60:06] that are required to keep you out of prison and so you have to have contracts you have to pay people on

[60:12] time you have to have a CRM that that collects all this information and this one functions as a

[60:18] vendor to the other two heads so think about this that person should never be making the big decisions

[60:24] in the business they should be supporting the decisions that enhance allow us to get more customers

[60:29] or deliver on this customer's better which if you think about it those three legs of the stool

[60:34] roll up to the only three things that you can do to increase enterprise value in a business you can

[60:39] get more customers you can make them worth more get more customers acquisition make them worth more

[60:43] delivery and you can decrease risk in the business and so that is where the operations comes in

[60:48] if I know that everything's completely dialed we have no massive risks that we're supposed to and we

[60:53] can get as many customers we don't want to please and our LTV continued to scale that is

[60:57] valuable business and so it makes sense to have people who are in charge one third the choke

[61:01] one chest to poke who's in charge of that function and in the beginning you may be all three

[61:06] but as you develop as the entrepreneurial to think which of these three hats is more central to

[61:11] my best skill set and then you can start finding the people who compliment you and so I'll give

[61:16] you my rule of thumb here is that if you're not learning from these people in the interview process

[61:20] about what they can do better than what you're doing you need to hire better now if you're early

[61:26] days and you don't have the cash to bring something like that in then you got to learn a lot

[61:29] and that's part of entrepreneurship but at some point you want the people that you bring in to be

[61:33] better at the thing than you which if you really think about it means that every business pretty

[61:38] much trickles up to the same thing when taken to its natural extreme which means you're going to have

[61:43] ahead of acquisition who might have a sales director a marketing director you're going to have

[61:47] some sort of head of ops who's going to have IT legal HR recruiting all rolling up to them and

[61:53] you're going to have some sort of customer delivery or product person who's going to have

[61:56] fulfillment product experience UX engineering if you have software that are rolling into them

[62:01] if that is what the ultimate end of every business is then guess what your day-to-day looks like

[62:06] in a really big business the same in just about every business and so the idea that you need to

[62:11] keep jumping from thing to thing to thing when the ultimate expression of that business is going to be

[62:16] the same for you at the end kind of seems stupid if I don't like something about the business it's like

[62:20] I just need to get out of it I just need to get above it and so you can just develop the business

[62:25] bring someone else in who does like that thing and then you can have that person reporting to you

[62:29] and at that point you're doing what every entrepreneur does which is they have a team of people who

[62:33] reports them about the things that they're doing on a daily basis and so don't get to band out of shape

[62:38] about this is my opinion here this is out this is advice from me don't get too bad out of shape

[62:44] about the passion thing like love the game and whether that's selling dry cleaning or selling

[62:51] software or selling books or running a portfolio at the end of the day it's more or less the same

[62:57] you're going to have a team of people that you like that share your values that share your mission

[63:01] and that you're walking alongside together with and so if you can if you can maintain that frame

[63:06] it will decrease the relative excitement for the woman in the red dress because you know that when

[63:11] it's taken to a natural and it'll be the same as the natural and of current business you're in

[63:14] number 17 the person with the highest standard should be in charge so you can think about this

[63:20] at every level of the business and so let's say you have an apartment for media buyers or you have

[63:25] an apartment for a content creators we have a a department for salespeople or you have recruiting

[63:30] at every level in the company the person who has the highest standard the lowest tolerance

[63:35] should be the person who's in charge and that goes all the way up to the top of the business if there's

[63:38] ever someone in your business who is a lower tolerance or has a higher standard for excellence

[63:44] then you that person should be in charge and not you and so I use this as a wonderful

[63:49] litmus test to figure out who do I think should be promoted within a company or division or

[63:54] department or even on a tiny team who should be the lead of that team the person who is the highest

[64:00] standards and so when I think okay I've got all these customer support who here has the highest

[64:04] standard for what they believe a customer service expert should look like that's the person you

[64:09] want in charge and so it's not 10 year it's not it's not swathness it's not how much you like them

[64:14] it's not what they look like it's who has the highest standard and so when I was starting up

[64:19] I made a lot of these mistakes I would promote people that I liked a lot I promote people who'd been

[64:24] there longer because I felt it felt bad that this guy had been here for 18 months and this

[64:27] person had only been there for two months and then I promote that person over the 18 month person

[64:31] but guess what when you have one of those hard situations guess what you get to do you get to talk

[64:35] to the 18 month person you get to explain exactly why the other person got the promotion and what they

[64:40] need to do so that they can get promoted in the future and if you have a winner that personal

[64:44] and if you have a loser that personal step out and that's okay number 18 whenever you're hiring

[64:51] make sure that the person raises the average bar and so this is this is when I stole from

[64:55] basis this is not mine but it's such a I love decision making frameworks because one of the hardest

[65:00] questions I get asked it's on a repeated basis is I don't know who to hire right or I don't know

[65:05] what good for this role looks like and so I'll give you two filters for that hiring process number one

[65:11] is during the hiring process am I learning more from then than they're loonering for me now if you

[65:16] take three interviews guess what you might have just three bad candidates just like if you take three

[65:22] sales calls and you might not close any of the three it doesn't mean that you should change anything

[65:26] it might just mean that you got in the phone of three bad customers and just as likely three bad

[65:30] candidates so you want to talk to 10 or 20 candidates and then what happens is if you talk to 20

[65:37] candidates you'll very quickly see who are the people who really know their stuff and who does it and so

[65:42] I look for the quantity and quality of metrics that they discuss about their position in terms of how

[65:48] the influence success and so it's how do you define success and then what are the things that you will

[65:52] do what are the actions you take that will influence or increase the likelihood that this successful

[65:56] event occurs and so if someone can't describe to me this sounds very basic in what ways do your

[66:02] actions contribute to this outcome now if you want to the two one version this is for leadership

[66:07] and if you say how does that outcome drive outcomes in the larger business if they can't connect those

[66:12] dots guess what they probably won't connect them in your business either now once you have an idea

[66:18] okay I've talked to 20 people I there's you know three of them actually seem like they knew

[66:23] their stuff they gave me good quantitative qualitative metrics they could tie their behaviors

[66:27] to the outcomes they want and they could track that outcome to the overall business okay

[66:31] now I just asked the question of the people that I'm considering which of them raises the bar of the

[66:36] team and it's the team that they're joining so I'm not expecting a front line customer service

[66:40] rep to raise the bar of the executive team it's a different skill set different level employee but

[66:46] if that front line customer service rep is going on a team of 10 reps that that person needs to

[66:51] raise the bar we were interviewing for one of our portfolio companies and so we we we we recruit

[66:56] for our portfolio companies because we have a bigger brand than they do and so we can put

[66:59] really high level talent in using my brand to grow their their business faster so it's a way of

[67:04] me growing the enterprise value of business without purposely using my face to grow it so I

[67:09] don't become keyment risk I just leverage my face to get the best talent into those companies

[67:14] and that's why they grow so fast pro tip but so we're looking at a media buyer for one of our

[67:19] portfolio companies and I and I think the you know the the past number of candidates and they were like

[67:25] this is the final guy we want you to talk to him said find so I talked to the candidate and

[67:30] the guy was great nothing wrong with them seemed you know had had decent experience and when I

[67:35] got off the call I got the recruiter for my team was like hey so what do you think should I pass

[67:40] him along as we hire him and I was like I don't think so he's like why he's like he met all the

[67:45] all the requirements he had the experience he seemed like a nice guy and I thought about it more

[67:48] than I was like name the other people on that team so you named all the other people and I said

[67:52] is that guy better than any of them and he was like no and I was like then we're making the company

[67:56] worse and so that person has to raise the bar of that team because think about the equal

[68:01] opposite if every person that comes in lowers the bar of the team you eventually delute the company

[68:06] to a bunch of people who suck but if you maintain that bar which is that this person has to increase

[68:11] the effort of the team then over time a company only improves and gets better and as that person

[68:16] now is in the team the whole the whole team's bar now raised a little bit and so we bring someone

[68:20] else in the bar goes up and if you're like wait that means that I have to keep hiring better and

[68:24] better people you damn straight you do that's the whole point and a mentor mindset this and I just

[68:28] love this quote he said your best talent has yet to come your best talent is in the future you

[68:33] haven't met them yet and so in me thinking about this and I can pass that same advice along to you

[68:38] is that the best employees the best teammates the best partners are in your future now your past

[68:43] number 19 when you're dealing with that team there's five reasons that someone is not doing what

[68:48] you want them to do and this is super helpful for these hard conversations and I usually draw

[68:52] a diamond here but I'll just do it visually here's the condition someone hasn't done what you want

[68:56] them to do reason number one they didn't know that you wanted them to do it so you didn't communicate

[69:01] clearly or you didn't do it in a written fashion whatever it was there was a miscommunication they

[69:04] didn't know that you wanted them to do it okay now let's say they knew that you wanted them to do it

[69:08] the second reason is they didn't know how to do it if they didn't know how to do it then

[69:12] it means that they need to be trained on the steps in order to recreate that thing now once you train

[69:18] if they know that you want to do it and they know how to do it then they might not have

[69:21] no when you want to do it which means you needed to add a deadline or a timeline with the thing

[69:25] that you asked them to do so it's like oh I knew that I just know you needed to buy two's

[69:28] day okay great so we're working our way around the fourth reason that someone won't do it is because

[69:33] they know that you wanted them to do it they knew how to do it and they knew when you wanted them to

[69:38] it but they just didn't want to do it so they weren't motivated and with motivation obviously a

[69:44] massive topic a lot of it comes down to the rewards cycles and punishments cycles associated with the

[69:47] work that they do and so it's how can I incentivize them properly and not necessarily monetarily you

[69:53] can incentivize someone by praise and by giving them kudos you want to know something that

[69:58] really incentivizes people freedom and reinvesting in them if you want your team to love you give them

[70:03] autonomy and invest in them if you do that they're like holy cow I get so much invested in these people

[70:08] basically what you want is you want reciprocity to still be like if the only reason someone does something is

[70:14] for the paycheck you're going to miss out on the vast majority of human effort which is discretionary

[70:19] effort so let's say it takes this much effort to not get fired someone usually has 10 times that

[70:24] amount of effort available to them that they put to their hobbies they put to their other things

[70:29] they put to their shower time they put to music or whatever else but they're not putting it to their

[70:33] role and reinvesting in it but if you invest in them and you try and up level their skillset

[70:38] either as a human being or as a professional or both then they become more valuable in your business

[70:43] and I think about this way is like well what if I invest in them and they leave well it's what if

[70:46] you don't and they stay so that's the fourth reason so they know that you want to do it they know how

[70:51] to do it they know when they want it done by and their mode they to do it well why why still are

[70:55] they haven't done it they have something blocking them and so an easy analogy here is I could have

[70:59] the best chef in the world and the most amazing kitchen and I would say hey make me an omelet and

[71:03] if he knows how to make an omelet and he knows and he knows I want it right now in front of me

[71:07] and he's motivated to do it because he's on television but he's like I don't have eggs there's nothing

[71:12] he's not going to shit an egg out right there's nothing he's going to do it I'll tell you real

[71:15] world examples so my meeting team we spending a lot it so we have a big office and we built a

[71:20] huge a bunch of studio stuff invested almost a million dollars into this building just on the

[71:24] media side to make it awesome for them but a lot of the guys were spending their time at home

[71:30] adding stuff and I was like dude what the hell I was like I think we've made this a pretty sweet

[71:33] place like why not you know what it was the bandwidth on upload speed was low at the office and so

[71:38] their houses were higher or faster upload speeds and so it was making them way less efficient

[71:44] which could us to them for being more efficient by being at home but then I was like okay well this is

[71:49] obviously a constraint and so then we spent 120 grand to get Google fiber drilled through the floor

[71:54] not through the floor like from the road to get brought into the building and now we've up

[71:58] let's be as of 1.2 gigs a second and so now we're way faster than they were at home and guess what

[72:04] the media teams here and so that was the thing that was blocking them and so here's the cool thing

[72:09] about this framework is that if you have a hard conversation with somebody or you perceive it to be

[72:13] a hard conversation because they're not doing something that you want them to do you can say I think

[72:17] there's five reasons that someone doesn't do it let's walk through them together and that way you

[72:21] can attack the reason rather than the person number 20 the hardest work is the work that you don't

[72:26] know how to do and the reason this is so tough is that the vast majority of the time if I said

[72:32] what would it take to grow your business if you only had one thing you could do by the end of the year

[72:36] and make sure that it was accomplished that if you just did that one thing all of your other goals

[72:41] would get accomplished well with that one thing being by the way that one thing is what we call a priority

[72:47] now the thing is is that you might not know how to make that one thing happen so it could be

[72:51] if I had a mega brand by the end of the year all of my other issues would go away it could be

[72:56] if I didn't have the turn issue that I have by the end of the year all my other issues would go away

[73:01] if I had a good sales director that could scale a sales team all of my issues would go away many

[73:06] businesses have one thing that if you think about it long enough have enough downstream effects that

[73:10] it would accomplish many of these other goals that you have or more likely make them a relevant

[73:15] and so what we do oftentimes is entrepreneur is we solve the problems we already know how to solve

[73:21] and so we like doing those because we have fast feedback loops because it's rewarding because we

[73:25] know how to solve it and so it's basically like going back to level two when you're at level three

[73:29] and you don't know how to beat that boss you just keep beating level two again because it feels good

[73:33] but the thing is is that the level three boss hasn't changed and he's still sitting there

[73:37] Bowser you know with his fist and his spikes sitting there ready to wreck you and so the thing is

[73:42] is that the hard work of entrepreneurship is the failure that you're inevitably going to encounter

[73:48] by not knowing what you're doing and then taking action steps despite that with the idea that you

[73:55] will eventually succeed if you don't stop and so we as entrepreneurs have to accept that that is what

[74:01] hard feels like it is confronting the unknown that we don't know how to do and realizing that we're

[74:06] going to take our best shot and probably be wrong for five six times in a row and yet that

[74:12] single priority has not changed if we still build the big brand if we still hired that really good

[74:17] sales director if we still fix churn in our business if that thing were solved it still doesn't

[74:22] become less of a priority but what happens is the entrepreneur fails once fails twice and then decides

[74:28] you know what I'm going to go back to level two and beat that to feed my ego feel good about myself

[74:33] but most of entrepreneurship is eating glass and that's why I said earlier growth is stressful

[74:37] stagnation is stressful decline is stressful because in each of those scenarios you're still doing

[74:41] the same thing which is that you're solving a problem you don't know how to solve yet and so the actual

[74:46] doingness in all three of those scenarios is the same and so that's why when you want to when you want to

[74:51] say stress is the problem it's not the problem stress is the fact that occurs when you solve problems

[74:57] and if you're solving problems you don't know how to solve welcome to the game if you knew how to

[75:01] do everything you'd already be Elon Musk and so the whole journey of entrepreneurship is turning the

[75:07] unknown into the known through trial and error there's a company that was thinking about investing in

[75:11] that has a consumer package good CPG product that I asked the founder I said how hard it's system

[75:18] manufacture and he said it's actually a lot more complicated than I thought it would be and I was like

[75:22] that's amazing and he just looked at me cross out and he was like why is that amazing I was like

[75:26] because that's more things that anyone is going to try and copy us is going to have to overcome and

[75:31] if we can bet on the fact that we're more perspectives that we're more relentless that we're

[75:35] more unyielding in our desire to keep solving the problem and keep bashing our heads against the rock

[75:42] until the rock gives way then we will be able to be the winners and any single thing that you have to

[75:48] overcome to be successful is what anybody who behind you wants to compete with you will also have to

[75:53] solve and so I like to think about it like there's this big rock that I have to figure out how to move

[75:59] with rope and some duct tape and a lot of sweat and a few guys with me and on the other side of that rock

[76:04] is a big bag of money and the bigger the rock in general the bigger the bag of money I mean I use

[76:09] this frame all the time at it one of our other profiliers companies we have a software that we've developed

[76:14] and has not gotten really really good and is generating a lot of revenue and there's this next big

[76:18] feature that we have to build out and he's like this is going to be really complicated I said well the

[76:21] good news is we're going to get paid $150 million when we solve it and he was like oh when you say

[76:25] like that and I was like well it is like that and so when you think about these things whether it's

[76:29] I need to add a second acquisition channel or I need to learn how to hire, manage and train a sales

[76:35] director each of these are hard things that you have to figure out how to do but if you can quantify

[76:40] how much more valuable your enterprise or your business will be as a result of this change

[76:44] then you can ascribe a value to it and if I said hey man if you hire that sales director

[76:49] a pay you five million dollars guess how motivated you probably be more motivated but the thing is

[76:54] is that your business will pay you five million dollars when you solve the problem and so if you

[76:57] frame it that way it's not being this woe is me people are hard man life is stressful it's

[77:03] we get compensated for ability to do with that stress and take action despite it one of the biggest

[77:08] unknowns that I had when I started a few years ago is how do you run a family office so I went from

[77:12] an entrepreneur building businesses to I have to manage cash added at portfolio and allocations

[77:21] of resources in capital across multiple businesses and different industries how many resources

[77:26] do I allocate in terms of man hour or state to these companies is it proportional to the capital

[77:30] what kind of deal structures are going to be the things that are going to mitigate risk but also

[77:33] give us the most upside these are all these things that I had no experience with and so I just got

[77:38] on the phone with anybody who'd give me time and asked them as many questions I possibly could

[77:41] and then guess what happened once I started doing it I learned way more than I did from all

[77:45] of those conversations and I developed my own thesis of how this works and so the thing is is that

[77:50] every time you start on something new whether it's starting a business to begin with or learning

[77:54] how to run paid ads or learning how to sell it always feels like this big and more fist thing

[77:59] but once you take your first phone sale once you run your first ad once you hire your first person

[78:05] all of a sudden you're like oh okay I kind of grabbed my arms around it and now I can see all the

[78:11] and so in my experience the faster I can get to me just wrapping my arms around me actually

[78:15] taking the first action you learn a hundred times more from your first hundred phone sales than you

[78:21] will from ten thousand hours of reading books about it and so my goal with a lot of the

[78:26] content that I have here is if I can just shrink the time between you thinking about doing it and doing

[78:30] it the faster you're going to get to your goal because learning is same condition new behavior

[78:36] if you have not changed your conditions and your behavior remains the same after this video you

[78:41] have learned nothing and you can measure how intelligent someone is by the rate of learning which

[78:47] means by the rate at which they changed their behavior given the same stimulus so if I say hey pick up

[78:53] the phone and answer it someone picks up the phone they say blah blah blah I say great I want you to

[78:57] read the script now pick up the phone now they pick up the phone they read the script same condition

[79:02] new behavior they've learned and so right now in your life there are conditions that probably

[79:07] remain unchanged and so if your behavior does not change you learned nothing and you can measure

[79:14] every video every piece of content every book that you or every sales exchange every meeting you have

[79:20] as to will this change my behavior if it didn't it was a waste of time and if you're a younger guy

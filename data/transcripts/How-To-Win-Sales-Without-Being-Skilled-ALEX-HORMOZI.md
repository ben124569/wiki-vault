[00:00] Good morning, everyone.

[00:01] It is 430 AM.

[00:03] Rockin' in from downtown Austin.

[00:05] Or not downtown Austin.

[00:07] Superb, you're Austin.

[00:09] But I need deep in creating our new phone sales

[00:13] training super robust end end training for our GLX funds

[00:17] and jibboards and so I'm very, very excited about

[00:19] what's coming out.

[00:20] It's one of our best stuff.

[00:23] But while I was going through it,

[00:24] there was this one kind of way I phrased something

[00:26] that I really liked and I wanted to share it with you.

[00:29] Which is one of our jim's had been really struggling with sales

[00:35] and he gets on the daily call every day,

[00:36] which is why we encourage people to do it.

[00:39] Where I just coach all of our jim's one-on-one.

[00:41] And he heard something which was to the extent of,

[00:46] remember why you're doing this, right?

[00:47] Remember why you're caring about the customer.

[00:49] Now, here's where this gets really cool.

[00:53] He went over whatever, over 20 or something.

[00:55] And then something switched and he went five for nine, right?

[01:00] Over night, 0 for 25 to five for nine, right?

[01:04] And this is the one thing that switched and this is how I want to share it with you.

[01:09] He essentially, the person who wins,

[01:12] so every sales is the same, right?

[01:14] And the sales is always making.

[01:15] Either they sell you or you sell them.

[01:18] But who is the person who makes the sale?

[01:21] The person who makes the sale is the person who cares the most about the buyer.

[01:26] Think about that for a second.

[01:27] And so that's the phrasing that I'm using in the training.

[01:29] Is the person who cares the most about the buyer's interests

[01:34] is the one who will win the sale, right?

[01:37] Like this was super profound for me.

[01:39] And so when you're approaching the sale,

[01:42] you have to come at it from the perspective of,

[01:44] I care more about this person than this person cares about themselves.

[01:49] And this is what that jim owner was able to flip in his mind

[01:52] was he remembered why he was, he said,

[01:54] because I give him the term commission breath, right?

[01:57] People can smell whether you're in it for your gender or their agenda, right?

[02:02] And so if you want to win the sale,

[02:04] you have to come at it from the perspective that I care more about your best interest than you do,

[02:09] right?

[02:10] You're going to throw these things in my way,

[02:12] but I care about you enough to get us through them so we can get to the promise land

[02:17] which is you getting help which is why you're here, right?

[02:20] And you have to expect that you're going, like,

[02:23] the sale is not going to go the way that you imagine in your head,

[02:25] because people bring all this emotional baggage to the sale.

[02:29] And it's a problem that's covered in shame and guilt,

[02:32] which is a great way of saying,

[02:37] it's not easy to get people to trust you, to build a rapport so they can actually be real with you.

[02:42] The moment you're able to get someone to be real with you in the sale,

[02:45] you already won the sale, right?

[02:46] Because at the end of the sale,

[02:48] if for some reason they actually can afford it,

[02:50] which is a very, very, very, very, very, very, very small percentage of people,

[02:54] then you're on the same side of the table with them and it's like cool,

[02:57] then let's actually figure this out together,

[02:59] but you're coming from it from a perspective that they trust

[03:02] that you were acting in their best interest, right?

[03:05] And so that's ultimately the sale that's being made is that the person needs to trust,

[03:11] that you care more about their agenda than they do.

[03:15] Think about it.

[03:17] That's the sale that's being made.

[03:19] If they believe that you care more about them, genuinely,

[03:23] then they care about themselves or have demonstrated care about themselves,

[03:28] then you will win.

[03:29] And so that's why I see some of our gyms who honestly aren't the most skilled salespeople,

[03:36] but they kill it.

[03:38] And I know these guys, because there's some guys who are just very processoring to

[03:41] they fall the fucking script and they crush it, right?

[03:43] And that's great. And I know why those people are successful at that.

[03:47] But there's some people who are, quote, personality driven salespeople.

[03:51] And these are like the really genuinely kind-hearted caring people

[03:55] that you can immediately tell from their vibe that they really love fitness and really love

[03:59] helping people get in shape and lose weight and take control of their lives.

[04:03] Those people get away with so much lack of skill in the sale,

[04:09] but are able to close because the people believe that they really are acting in their own best interest,

[04:15] which is why having conviction in your product is so important.

[04:19] And so if you can simply have that one reframe before you go into the sale,

[04:23] which is I'm going to approach this from the perspective that this person needs my help,

[04:28] but like actually though, like actually getting them to, like you actually believing

[04:36] that they need your help and that you have to have their true best interest at heart more than they do,

[04:43] which is why if you do genuinely have that belief, you're going to force them to confront the

[04:47] limiting beliefs that they had. Right? And you're like, listen, like, let me be real with you here.

[04:53] Like, do you think that the reason you have these successful is because like,

[04:57] you've kind of just like fallen off the bandwagon. Like you've, you've been putting the food in your mouth, right?

[05:03] So that's who's responsibility is that? Is that, is that your busy schedules? Is that your husband?

[05:08] Who's it? Who's responsibility is that? Right? And they're like, well I guess it is mine.

[05:12] You're like, right? And I'm not saying this to be mean to you. I'm saying this because I want to help,

[05:16] but this time's going to be different, right? And so that way you can break these beliefs systematically

[05:21] throughout so you can actually help this person. All right? Because sales is just coaching, right?

[05:27] With an outcome that's defined over a period of time. And so I guess the biggest point that I want to

[05:33] make here is that if you can just think about it from that perspective, this guy had the same script

[05:37] from his first, you know, 25 reps to the last five of nine that he hit, right? And mind you,

[05:43] he made this realization at rep 25, which for some reason is a magical number. All right? But a

[05:48] rep 25, he realized that he just was trying to sell on his agenda and not on the agenda the other

[05:53] persons. And there's sometimes it's, I mean, one of the things that I was just talking to our sales team about

[06:00] advanced salesmen are advanced because they never don't do the basics, right? People are defined

[06:06] as advanced because of their outcomes, not because of their tactics, right? Advanced lifters aren't

[06:12] doing different tactics, the novice lifters. They just lift more weight. And the reason they do it is

[06:16] they've just done it consistently longer, right? Or they're more consistent in general. They never

[06:20] don't do the basics. They always sleep. They always do the recovery mechanism. They always eat the

[06:24] macros that they're supposed to hit, right? It's the same thing with business and sales. Like the

[06:29] best sales people are consistent because they never don't do the basics. The tactics don't change.

[06:34] It's just your execution of them. All right? And so when I look at professional developments,

[06:39] I think this is a big zoom out, but I think it's important. When I talk to higher level, you know,

[06:43] entrepreneurs who are at like 10 million, 20 million, et cetera, and they're like, what do I

[06:47] need to do to get to the next next thing is I see three major breaking points in professional

[06:54] development as an entrepreneur. The first is skills, right? People enter the marketplace of entrepreneurship

[06:59] with no skills. They have nothing to offer a value. And so they have to go acquire skills. And there's

[07:05] far more skills that you need to acquire than you think, right? Like I need to be able to get customers.

[07:09] But be able to get customers is a lot of skills put together, right? You have to know how to write

[07:14] copy. You know, I have to know how to create creative. You know, I have to know how to build

[07:17] landing pages. You know, I have to have to have to be able to buy in place traffic. You know,

[07:22] I have to know how to nurture leads. You get them to show up to both schedule and shop to a sales event.

[07:27] You have to know what type of sales event you want to have is it going to be a presentation.

[07:30] Is it going to be a sales call? Is it going to be an in-person appointment? Is it going to be a

[07:34] two-step sale? Like you have to know what the conversion mechanism is going to be. Is it going to be a sales

[07:37] page, right? You have to know what the conversion mechanism is going to be, right? And then from there,

[07:41] you have to know the actual scripting closing mechanism. It's not just the words, it's how to say the

[07:46] words with the tonalities, how you ask the questions, how you confront obstacles, how you overcome them,

[07:50] how to process payments, how to like, like this, you know what I mean? Like the number of skills

[07:55] stacks in order to make it, but it skills is the first block, right? The second block is the character

[08:03] traits to execute the skills, right? As soon as you have your first, your first box of tools,

[08:10] what separates the people who are really successful from the ones who are just moderately

[08:14] successful is that they have the patience, the endurance, the discipline, right? To execute

[08:19] their skills within a defined way, and that is how they're able to consistently grow because they're

[08:25] consistently executing. And so it goes from needing to acquire skills in the beginning to needing

[08:31] to acquire character traits, which is why I love the game of entrepreneurship, just that the way that

[08:35] you win consistently evolves, right? It's literally not just more, it's different at every level,

[08:41] and then that's kind of level two, is that you have to develop the character traits to be able

[08:45] to execute the skills. And then the third is your beliefs, right? Your beliefs about the world,

[08:51] your beliefs about the market, your belief about what's possible, your tolerance of what is

[08:55] acceptable in your organization from an standpoint of speed, a standpoint of excellence, and those

[09:02] beliefs are top down, those are from you, right? And so as you move through, I think it's cyclical,

[09:09] right? I think it's every level encompasses all three of those things, and you kind of have to

[09:15] spin your way through the three of this things over and over again. And the reason to get it's

[09:19] difficult is that you still have to maintain the skills, the beliefs, the character traits,

[09:25] of the base below before you can get to the next level where you have new beliefs, new skills,

[09:30] new character traits that need to be developed. And that's why I think most people love entrepreneurship

[09:35] or at least hopefully you like entrepreneurs, but if you're in it, is that it constantly forces

[09:40] you to grow and grow with this painful, right? And so it's this weird, massacistic desire to continue

[09:46] to improve and yet suffer the entire way, but love the process while you're suffering. So it's

[09:51] just kind of a better thing. But anyways, I won't get too deep in that. Big point here is that if you're

[09:55] trying to close and you're trying to hit your sales team to close, the person who cares the most

[09:59] about the buyer will win. The buyer cares more about their outcome than you do than they will win.

[10:05] If you care more about their outcome genuinely than they do, they will feel that A and B when you

[10:11] confront their beliefs, they'll see it from a place of genuine care and they will be real with you.

[10:15] And then when you get to the close, they're not going to bring their baggage because you can

[10:19] front of the baggage because you did it from a place of care and then they will trust you in the

[10:23] close to take them where they need to go. All right. So that's the big point. That was the big,

[10:30] that was one of the things that I'm going to be, I'm putting it to our sales trading right now.

[10:33] I hope you enjoyed this. If you did drop a like or a comment. If you didn't,

[10:37] still drop a like or a comment. All right. Anyways, have an amazing Thursday. I could see you guys soon. Bye!

## Full Transcript
[00:00] In the past nine months, I've had to make a number of decisions that had a nine-figure

[00:05] ramification on my personal network. And what I want to walk you through is the actual decision-making

[00:10] framework for process that I used to create those. And so if you're new to the channel, my name's

[00:16] actually Mozi and I'm an acquisition.com, it's a portfolio of companies that does about 85 million

[00:19] dollars a year. All right, I make these videos because a lot of people broke and I don't want to be

[00:22] all of them. All right, so one of the important, I mean the most important things that we have in our

[00:26] lives are our decisions, right? And one of the things that I live by is that we're one decision away

[00:29] from changing our life forever. Right? We're one decision away from drinking and getting killed in a

[00:32] car accident. You're one decision away from cheating on your spouse and destroying your marriage.

[00:37] You know, you're one terrible comment away from destroying your child, right? And you're also one decision

[00:42] away from destroying your business if you so chose. So decisions are the well-spring of life or at least

[00:47] the train track splits of where we're going to end up. All right, learning to make the decisions

[00:54] is an important concept, but believe it or not, for this video what I want to focus on is actually

[00:58] the environment under which to make the decision. During this process, one of the things that was

[01:03] very frustrating for me, and this decision took me about 12 months to make and I'll explain what the

[01:09] decision wasn't in another video in the future, which it's safe to say, like it was a hugely

[01:14] impactful decision in my life financially and otherwise. One of the difficulties that I was having is that

[01:19] the information that I had was not changing in yet my decision of which way to go continue to

[01:24] falter. All right, so I ping-pong you back and forth and back and forth and back and forth. And so I was like,

[01:30] it's not my decision making process, right? And the data that I have to make this decision is

[01:37] unchanging and yet, at different days, I would have different outcomes, which to me is big

[01:44] red flag danger alert in terms of like the the, the, a leading indicator of a bad decision.

[01:49] Mind you, as a quick caveat to this, this is not how you need to make all the decisions in your life.

[01:54] I would say that you should find and use this process for the most important decisions you make in your

[01:58] life. Who are you going to marry? Where are you going to live? What are you going to work on?

[02:03] Right? What are you going like, those are the decisions that are we going to make this big strategic

[02:06] change in our business? Those are big irreversible decisions. And that's the key for me is that if a

[02:13] decision is irreversible, comma and has downstream consequences, then those are the ones that

[02:20] take more time to analyze. All right? Now, here's the, here's the, the piece that I was missing

[02:26] in my equation for making this decision so I want to share with you. All right? One of the key pieces

[02:31] of how we decide is the brain chemistry that is going on. So whether you have lots of dopamine,

[02:36] lots of serotonin that are circling around in your brain will ultimately affect how you make decisions.

[02:40] Believe it or not, we are 100% of most of decision makers. The thing is is what we want to do is

[02:46] control the extent to which the emotions control our decisions. All right? That's the key point here.

[02:50] If you don't acknowledge that emotions wait into all of your decisions, even your quote rational ones,

[02:55] you are lost. All right? What you can do is first identify when you are feeling emotional

[03:01] and a lot of guys feel like this is like a, a, a, a flu flu turn. If you're angry, it's emotional.

[03:05] If you're insecure, that's emotional. Like there are other emotions beside being a pencil.

[03:09] Because if you have emotions, it decreases the speed with you make decisions and the stakes love a

[03:17] rush decision. You can say, we mistakes love a rush decision. It's one of the pre-dos that

[03:22] lay on our lowby. The environment under which we make decisions is important. Now, we have to

[03:26] acknowledge the biases that we have. Here's where emotions get even worse. You have two biases that

[03:32] you have to fight against. One is confirmation bias, which is your emotional soup in your brain is

[03:37] going to say, this is what I want because this is how I feel safe. Then your logical brain will search

[03:43] out reasons or data to support that thing, right? It's like making an argument to yourself.

[03:48] The problem is you may change your argument, but it's not going to change reality,

[03:52] which means that the decision can be good or bad based on the soup that we started as the

[03:57] pre-disposition towards how we're going to gather data. The second is conviction bias,

[04:01] which is how convicted of mine in this thing or this decision. The more you believe in it or the

[04:07] more you want the positive outcome to occur, the more you will purposefully blind yourself because

[04:11] you want to save your ego and how you feel about yourself because it makes you feel good to think

[04:18] about this positive outcome. But it does not affect the percentage likely that it actually occurs

[04:22] in the real world. Just why you see other people because you can be rational about others. You see

[04:27] other people make these terrible decisions and you think yourself, why don't God's earth that they

[04:31] make those decisions? When in reality, that person is you and it's other people who are looking at you.

[04:35] This is how I have learned to help mitigate or decrease the emotional impact or the impact that

[04:42] my emotions have on my decision making process so that I can at least be as rational as I can

[04:47] possibly be an operate from the stance that will benefit myself in the highest degree in a long run.

[04:54] So here's what it is. Number one is that I make sure that I am well rested when I make the decision.

[04:59] So if I didn't have like a really good night's sleep, like everybody knows like there's like

[05:03] normal sleep, there's bad sleep, there's like decency, but I'm talking like you wake up like a new

[05:08] more child. I've recognized those days and I joke with whale about it. I'm like man, I slept like

[05:14] like a like a chair of last night. Like if you've got so many big decisions, I'm like let's let's make

[05:19] him now because I feel completely clear. So number one, very, very good sleep. Number two, and this

[05:25] makes sound fucking obvious, but people don't do this. Number two is to be well fed. All right,

[05:31] when we are well fed, our serotonin levels are double in levels, etc. All get elevated in our body.

[05:37] All right, like you feel better after you eat. And here's a fun one for you. Your body interprets

[05:43] stress, but physical and emotional the same way. It's a cortisol response. And so you in a very real way,

[05:50] when you eat more, are more stressed tolerant. It's why people do it. It's why people stressing.

[05:55] Because you do cope and make yourself more resilient to stress when you eat more. So I'm not saying

[06:02] you do this all the time, but if you're going to make a big decision, you want to make sure that you

[06:06] are well fed and well rested. All right, and what we're doing here is we're trying to decrease

[06:12] the anxieties and the stressors and the noise that normally will confound the decision-making

[06:18] process because they'll start triggering emotions that will then force you to start finding

[06:22] and nitpicking different data points to then make a supposedly rational decision that is wrong.

[06:27] And that is there to protect your ego rather than what is going to serve you best in the long run.

[06:31] And the third piece of the environment that I try and create is if I can, I try and get space

[06:36] away from the day-to-day activities that I have. So be that evocation or literally just

[06:42] removing yourself from the normal space where you operate. And because those spaces have anchors in your

[06:47] mind that you have made decisions in the past year, you have emotional occurrences that

[06:51] have happened in the room or the desk that you work at. And so you have these anchorings that

[06:55] are around you and you want to remove yourself from those things so that you can have as few

[07:01] outside influences on the decision that you possibly can. Now, here's the trick.

[07:05] Is that once you, once you create this environment, right, you want to make the decision

[07:11] through a place of needing nothing. And so the definition of abundance is having everything you need,

[07:19] which the corollary, the reverse of that, is to need nothing else, is to have enough. And so when

[07:24] you have enough, you will not need this decision to get you anything at all. And so the key to make

[07:31] as rational of a decision as you possibly can is to not care about the outcome either way

[07:36] and to realize that you already have everything you need. Or want. And so if you have everything

[07:41] you want and you're well rested and you're well fed and you're surrounded by the people that you love

[07:45] and you realize the things that are important in life. All the sudden it will help you appropriately

[07:51] way the decision that you were trying to make. And so I don't know if anyone here who's

[07:55] listening to this has an important decision that they must make. But these are the four steps.

[08:00] Number one, rest. Number two, eat. Number three, separate. Number four, operate from a place of

[08:09] needing nothing. And when you have those four frames that are stacked on top of each other,

[08:14] they can disinhibit to a great degree. The extent to which your emotions will influence your

[08:20] decisions, they still will. But ideally, secondarily so, or at a lower percentage of influence.

[08:27] And so it gives us just enough room to peek our heads and get above our emotional cloud

[08:32] and make a decision that's truly rational. And when we make more rational decisions,

[08:37] we live a much easier life. All right, I'll say that firsthand. A lot of the decisions I made in

[08:42] my past, there were based on emotions and it up really buddying in the end, especially when I have

[08:47] lots of emotions and I actually really quickly enlarged ways against irreversible decisions

[08:52] great recipe for terrible life. So the opposite of that, if we're trying to use Charlie Mougars

[08:56] in version process, is how would I make a terrible decision? I wouldn't be robusted, I'd be hungry,

[09:02] I would be rushed, right? I'd be, I'd be anchored around all the things that stress me out,

[09:08] and make sure that it's operating from place, I'm having to have the thin.

[09:13] And so we look at those things and we reverse the model to stack in our favorites so that we can

[09:18] have the best possible decision. And so, most of the nation, I love you all, keep being awesome,

[09:23] and I'll see you guys in the next video. Bye!

[00:00] I'm gonna walk you through a forced process

[00:02] that I think puts business on easy mode.

[00:04] And so whether you're just getting started

[00:06] or you're already making tons of money

[00:08] and they're just trying to make more,

[00:09] this process just works.

[00:11] And I've done it in tons of different portfolio companies

[00:14] and companies we've been advised

[00:16] and just to give you a little bit of context

[00:18] as of last year, our portfolio at acquisition.com

[00:21] that over $250 million an aggregator revenue

[00:23] and I say that not as a promise

[00:25] that if you two this, you're gonna get that outcome

[00:27] but that this works.

[00:28] So that being said, let's dive in.

[00:30] Step number one, get the ad.

[00:32] So we have to fundamentally show something

[00:35] to someone in order for them to find out about our stuff.

[00:38] We agree on that.

[00:40] If the answer to that is yes,

[00:41] then the first step here is that we're going to have

[00:44] some sort of advertisement.

[00:46] Now that ad might be somebody reaching out.

[00:49] It's an advertisement, literally letting people know about stuff.

[00:51] It could be a paid ad, so it could be an interruption based ad

[00:54] that happens on any social media platform.

[00:57] It could be a piece of content like this that says,

[00:59] hey, you go by this thing.

[01:01] Now, between all the different ways of getting customers,

[01:04] paid ads versus content versus outreach versus maybe

[01:08] the exception being affiliates,

[01:10] paid ads is the fastest to scale

[01:14] because one guy with buttons and good creative could scale

[01:16] to the mood.

[01:18] And so it's all about skill when it comes to creating pay debts.

[01:21] Now, I'm going to just use this as our placeholder

[01:23] but if you were trying to get into pay debts,

[01:26] then I'll give you two little frameworks that

[01:27] worked really well for me.

[01:28] So number one, and this is a new one,

[01:30] which is absolutely murdering it for us,

[01:33] is what I'll call organic plus CTA, very complicated.

[01:39] All right, so what is organic plus CTA?

[01:41] It's you have whatever we're getting into,

[01:43] you make some content does better than others.

[01:46] Provided you make organic content,

[01:47] relevant to the stuff you sell, which, by the way,

[01:49] probably good idea.

[01:51] You make your content and then you find the good ones

[01:53] and then all you do is you add a call to action at the end

[01:55] of that sense people do your thing.

[01:57] And we already know it works because we've already tried it.

[02:00] And so you get to have all these test shots on goal

[02:03] that cost you nothing by simply making the content.

[02:06] And then just to be algorithm tell you

[02:08] what people already like and they engage with

[02:09] and they share and they click, they get past the hook.

[02:11] And then you just say, oh, I'm going to take this thing

[02:14] and I'm going to turn into some of that feeds my business

[02:16] in a more skillful way because I'm not going to rely

[02:18] on the platform to just give it to people for free,

[02:20] which is great.

[02:21] But I also can't really add a longer call to action

[02:24] because it would tank the effectiveness of the clip.

[02:27] But if I put it in the beginning and then I pay the platform,

[02:30] then they're happy to display it because they

[02:31] were already happy to display it for free.

[02:32] So why wouldn't they want to display it and exchange for money?

[02:35] And then we can add our very simple call to action at the end

[02:38] for some sort of thing, which I'll get to in a second.

[02:41] Now the second kind of way of thinking about this,

[02:43] like this one's by far the easiest.

[02:45] We can do this, do it.

[02:46] Now if you're like, okay, I don't have enough organic

[02:48] or I just need to quickly make ads directly,

[02:51] then this is the frame with it, I'll use.

[02:53] So I have hook plus meet plus CTA.

[02:57] All right, so I'm going to break down each of these really quickly.

[02:59] So from a hooks perspective, what I do is I still

[03:02] look at the best performing organic and the best performing

[03:05] ads across all industry.

[03:06] So this is one where you don't need to stick to your industry.

[03:08] You might find a hook that worked exceptionally well

[03:10] in finance and it works really well for hotels too, right?

[03:14] Provided doesn't actually say finance in it.

[03:16] And so you'll see that hooks just convert across way

[03:19] different audiences because it just draws attention.

[03:21] And so the first thing I'll look at is hooks.

[03:23] And this is by far the 80% of the ad.

[03:25] And you're like, wait, but they're so short.

[03:27] And they're still the most important.

[03:28] So we should just be thankful.

[03:29] It's crazy.

[03:30] It's like people have a hard time accepting that something

[03:32] short could be more meaningful than something long

[03:35] because it takes more work.

[03:36] Like would you prefer that the thing that means the most

[03:39] is actually really hard and long to do?

[03:41] No, right?

[03:42] Like the fact that hooks are short is a gift from God

[03:45] for advertisers that we can actually have the most

[03:47] and more thing, not require a ton of work.

[03:48] Now, if you want to be smart about it,

[03:50] it should require work because you're going to do that work

[03:51] in the research or the research before you record this.

[03:54] So for here, I would have at least 50 plus hooks.

[03:58] And you're like 50 plus hooks.

[03:59] Yeah, you're probably not making nearly enough ads.

[04:01] And I don't care what your spend is.

[04:03] Like if you're spending $10,000 a month, $100,000 a month,

[04:06] like you can never have too many ads.

[04:09] I'll just say that.

[04:10] You can never have too many ads.

[04:11] You just give the algorithm more things to pick

[04:13] from to find the winners.

[04:14] Now, the meat, I'm going to give you a different framework

[04:17] that I haven't talked about much lately.

[04:19] Let's see what I'm gonna break down for you right here.

[04:21] This is four step persuasion.

[04:24] And I just think it's just so easy to understand.

[04:26] So this is how I think, this is my mental framework.

[04:29] All right, for how I actually make persuasive,

[04:31] advertisements, copy, pitches, whatever, right?

[04:34] Which is, you're gonna get more good stuff.

[04:37] If you do the thing, I want you to do.

[04:39] You're gonna get less bad stuff.

[04:41] If you do the thing I want you to do.

[04:42] And if you don't do the thing that I want you to do,

[04:44] you're gonna get more bad stuff.

[04:46] And you're gonna get less good stuff.

[04:47] That's it.

[04:48] Four different angles that you can hit on any action

[04:50] I want you to take.

[04:51] So if you sign up for the gym,

[04:54] you're going to feel better.

[04:56] I'm making this obviously really something.

[04:58] You're gonna get more good fields.

[04:59] You have more energy.

[05:00] You're gonna have, you're gonna sleep better.

[05:02] All that stuff's good.

[05:03] Now, what's the inverse of that?

[05:04] You're not gonna feel the brain fog

[05:06] that you've been feeling.

[05:06] You're not gonna feel as though the third one.

[05:08] You're not gonna have your kids out playing

[05:11] and feel like you can't play with them

[05:12] and feel like a bad parent.

[05:13] We're gonna get rid of all that.

[05:14] Minus, negative thing.

[05:15] The only thing easier, you know,

[05:17] than taking this small action today

[05:19] is not taking that action.

[05:20] But the thing is is that if you don't take that action,

[05:22] then whatever brain fog you're feeling right now,

[05:24] the current weight that you put on for the last five years,

[05:26] let's push it out two or three years.

[05:27] How much more weight are you gonna be?

[05:29] Like if you're 50 pounds overweight now,

[05:31] what are you gonna feel like it's 70 pounds overweight?

[05:33] It'd be way worse, right?

[05:34] You don't want that.

[05:35] Also, all those memories,

[05:37] when you think about the happiest memories

[05:38] that you have with your kids, with your family,

[05:40] like those are gonna decrease.

[05:42] You're gonna feel of those

[05:44] because you physically can't do that.

[05:45] And so the only thing easier than taking action

[05:48] is not taking action at all.

[05:49] And so if these are the things that you want,

[05:50] you should do this thing,

[05:51] because that way we can avoid this stuff.

[05:53] That's it.

[05:54] Very straightforward.

[05:55] And this is what constitutes

[05:58] our meat.

[05:59] Now, I'd be at a very simplistic example.

[06:01] If I want to make that more interesting, right?

[06:03] If you want to like, how do you create unique copy?

[06:06] This is a little advanced tip for you.

[06:08] All right?

[06:09] So, pro tip, break down the terms.

[06:10] So what does it mean?

[06:11] So if I say, you're gonna feel better, right?

[06:14] That is not gonna be compelling copy.

[06:16] I can promise you that right now.

[06:17] But what does feel better mean to somebody?

[06:19] How would I know that feeling better had occurred?

[06:21] In their life, and this is where you have to,

[06:23] this is where the research of like reading Amazon reviews

[06:27] for products that are similar in your space,

[06:29] even if you sell services, read the positive reviews

[06:31] in their language of the things that they will say

[06:35] of why of what happened.

[06:37] And the way that I think about this, here it is.

[06:39] This is the big word that you need to double underline.

[06:41] Think in moments.

[06:43] What is the moment that someone think,

[06:44] wow, I feel better.

[06:45] What's the moment, what occurred, what happened, right?

[06:48] Maybe it's that they were able, let's say

[06:50] if it's an elderly population

[06:52] that we're doing with this weight loss thing,

[06:53] they were able to take the kid off the ground

[06:55] and pick them up, right?

[06:56] And they have this moment.

[06:58] Where after they had that,

[06:58] there were three, four minute exchanges like man,

[07:01] that was awesome.

[07:01] I couldn't do that before because I was so weak

[07:03] and I hadn't developed my shoulder straight.

[07:05] I didn't have the mobility to do that.

[07:06] Like, wow, it's a moment.

[07:08] What else would it be?

[07:09] Maybe it's bending over to time I shoe.

[07:12] I felt like I was getting out of breath

[07:14] because I like hold my gut in

[07:16] so I could lean over to time I shoes.

[07:18] That's gone now.

[07:19] Like, what if there was a world where you just put both of them on

[07:21] and you could do it while you're standing, right?

[07:23] That's not out of reach.

[07:25] It's just a couple steps away from where you're at right now.

[07:27] So if I say that, I can describe all the things

[07:31] that someone might experience

[07:32] and then denote that they feel better

[07:34] without saying you're gonna feel better.

[07:36] And so this applies for each of these elements of copy

[07:39] and this is what makes copy potent.

[07:41] It's the specificity

[07:43] because you want someone to understand it

[07:44] within their own context of like,

[07:46] man, I've had that happen.

[07:48] And that's real.

[07:49] That's what makes you copy.

[07:50] And if that little copy tip was helpful for you,

[07:54] then I have pages and pages of things

[07:56] that help me make good ads inside of the run paid ads

[08:03] chapter and page 1209.

[08:04] So I talk about one, pay that's work, obviously.

[08:08] But secondly, how do you write the copy?

[08:10] So I break down all the anatomy of ads in all of this,

[08:12] all these pages I'm talking about.

[08:14] All of this is how you can make the ad.

[08:16] And so this is the level one framework,

[08:19] the level two that you put on top of this is who and when.

[08:23] This is the one, which again,

[08:25] I also cover the book.

[08:26] So we could talk about the prospect,

[08:28] but we could also talk about that prospect status

[08:30] with regards to their spouse.

[08:31] I'll talk about it with regards to their kids,

[08:33] talk about the regards to their friendemies,

[08:35] their rivals, their competitors.

[08:37] Right?

[08:38] What are all these plus and minuses

[08:39] with regards to that rival data across the street?

[08:42] Or that rival business?

[08:44] Right?

[08:44] What are all those look like?

[08:45] And then how do we paste that for today?

[08:47] But then also the future.

[08:49] What is the future look like when things don't go the right way?

[08:51] Ooh, well, that's gonna be the bottom side.

[08:53] That's what happens if you don't take action.

[08:54] On the flip side, what is the future look like

[08:56] if things go well?

[08:57] Right? So we can play out today,

[08:58] but also play out tomorrow.

[09:00] And this gives you unlimited different angles

[09:01] to make the meat of your ad more compelling.

[09:04] And then the third thing is obviously the call to action,

[09:06] which you want it to be as clear as you really possible

[09:08] until them exactly what you want them to do.

[09:10] And what will happen next?

[09:12] It's a key point that a lot of people miss.

[09:13] Not only do you want to say it,

[09:14] you want us to be demonstrated in the ad.

[09:15] So if I want someone to go to the next page,

[09:17] when I say go to the next page,

[09:18] I want the go to the next page to be visible,

[09:20] because that way what happens you have congruence.

[09:23] So and that has a couple levels of persuasion there.

[09:26] So number one in terms of congruence

[09:27] that people say, okay, I have set my expectations,

[09:29] and they click and their expectations are met.

[09:31] And then what do you know?

[09:33] You have way fewer people who bounce off the page

[09:35] because the page looks exactly like to expect it to.

[09:37] Now, what else happens?

[09:39] The person who actually made the recommendation

[09:41] to go to the page also increases in influence

[09:44] because when you say something's going to happen

[09:46] and then it happens, the person consciously or subconsciously

[09:49] doesn't matter, science works either way,

[09:52] they will believe the next thing you predict

[09:54] with greater certainty.

[09:55] And so wouldn't you want people to be like, man,

[09:58] when that guy says something's going to happen,

[09:59] that's what happens.

[10:00] That proceeds or plants the seed

[10:03] for the sale that will never be come down the road.

[10:05] Now, once we have our ads,

[10:08] so now we're getting eyeballs, right?

[10:10] And people are seeing the ads

[10:12] and then what are they doing?

[10:13] They're taking an action.

[10:14] All right, so this is my world's terrible mouse click.

[10:17] They click on the ad, I don't know,

[10:18] our little mouse is on fire, but we're just going to go with it.

[10:21] All right, the next step in this process is going to be

[10:25] the opposite, right?

[10:26] We want them to give us their information for something.

[10:28] And what are they going to give us the information for?

[10:31] So typically, it's going to be lead magnitude of some sort.

[10:33] Now, people have this big issue with like,

[10:35] I'll lead me to some dead or mean that lead me out of,

[10:38] our live, I'll tell you this, bad lead magnets are dead.

[10:43] Good lead magnets certainly are alive.

[10:46] And mostly, men it's suck.

[10:48] And so it's unsurprising that the vast majority of people

[10:50] who start to run ad the first time don't make money.

[10:53] Because they're ad suck.

[10:54] And the first time you take a sales call,

[10:56] you probably suck, because you don't know how to take a sales call.

[10:58] And the first lead magnet you make will probably suck too.

[11:01] Now, I want to give you, in my opinion,

[11:03] the best lead magnet that I've ever seen in my whole life.

[11:06] All right?

[11:06] And so it was actually the dating space.

[11:08] And it was called, how to know if a girl wants you to kiss her.

[11:11] Okay?

[11:12] Now, who wouldn't want to know if a girl wants to do it

[11:15] wants you to kiss her, right?

[11:16] And so the simple answer to that, and this is the lead magnet,

[11:19] is try to brush her hair behind her ear.

[11:23] And if she moves her head away, then she doesn't want to kiss you.

[11:26] If she doesn't move her head at all,

[11:27] or moves her head towards your hand, then she does.

[11:30] Very simple, all right?

[11:31] But the beauty of this is like, wait,

[11:33] so that could be lead magnet.

[11:35] Of course it could be lead magnet.

[11:37] We want to solve the tiny, as problem we possibly can

[11:40] for the prospect and completely solve it and blow them away.

[11:43] Now, some people are like, I made this full course.

[11:45] And there's nothing wrong with that to be clear.

[11:46] I've got a whole bunch of them on my site.

[11:48] The thing is, there's going to be a certain amount of information

[11:51] that is required in order for a customer to make a decision.

[11:53] Period, right?

[11:54] I would toss out the idea of emotional biological buyer

[11:57] and just replace that.

[11:59] And this is how I think about it as high information

[12:01] and low information.

[12:02] How much information does someone need

[12:04] in order to make a person decision?

[12:05] Some people do need less.

[12:06] Some people mean more, but if you provide more to everyone,

[12:09] you will close more people overall.

[12:11] And so a lot of us are trying to add to straight money.

[12:15] And there are going to be those people who will just

[12:17] see an ad, watch a video, and then buy something.

[12:19] That happens.

[12:20] They are the minority.

[12:21] They are the crazy people.

[12:22] And we are grateful for them because they allow all

[12:25] of the machines to work.

[12:26] But for the other 97% of people, they usually

[12:29] need a little bit more time, a little bit more information

[12:31] in order to make the decision.

[12:33] And we have to facilitate that.

[12:34] So there's going to be two paths that people

[12:36] will self-identify as we go through this

[12:38] to maximize our monetization of the advertising

[12:40] that we do to make the most money.

[12:43] Now, the lead method that I just explained, which

[12:45] was just have the girl brush her, is

[12:47] her brush the girl's hair behind her, you can fill it out.

[12:49] So what type of lead man is this?

[12:52] So what I gave you is a one step

[12:54] to a multi-step solution.

[12:56] So most people who are in the dating space

[12:57] aren't looking to just get a kiss.

[12:59] They're looking to find more dates.

[13:01] They're looking to eventually find a wife.

[13:04] They're going to have to get into a relationship.

[13:05] They're going to maybe get married later.

[13:06] So there's all these other problems

[13:08] that are going to have to happen outside of just figuring

[13:10] out if we're going to get a kiss you.

[13:12] If I don't have dates, I don't care.

[13:14] Now, this is neat, but I still have other problems

[13:16] that need to solve.

[13:17] But if you accurately solve that problem,

[13:18] because I'm like, I can understand why that would work,

[13:20] then what do you think I'm going to do next?

[13:22] I'm going to believe that you can probably help me solve

[13:24] my other problems.

[13:26] So what I just outlined, you can come in real quick.

[13:28] So this is page 32 of the lead's book,

[13:31] is the problem solution cycle.

[13:33] And there's many, many problems solution cycles

[13:35] that exist within a larger goal.

[13:37] The bigger the goal, the more problems solutions

[13:38] they have to go through.

[13:39] And so our lead magnet too has to solve

[13:41] one of these little problems solutions.

[13:42] So the teaching the girl, you know,

[13:44] teaching the guy, how to know the girl wants to kiss him.

[13:46] It's not the big loop.

[13:47] It's just one of these tiny, 80-bitty loops.

[13:49] That's all it is.

[13:50] But now I think, well, without me solve that one,

[13:52] I'll bet you, you can help me solve the rest of them.

[13:54] Now, what type of lead magnet is this?

[13:56] So the type lead magnet you can reveal a problem,

[13:58] which would be like the reason

[13:59] that you're not getting responses in your DMs

[14:01] is because of this.

[14:02] So if I show them a framework for what a DMs was to be,

[14:04] I've revealed the problem why they're not getting responses.

[14:07] Now, the other side of this is that I could say,

[14:09] hey, I'm going to give you a free trial of my dating thing.

[14:12] This is another type of lead magnet.

[14:13] Now, this one is actually to step three or type three

[14:16] of lead magnets, which is I'm giving the way one step

[14:19] of a multi-step process to get an outcome.

[14:22] You're not just trying to get a girl to kiss you.

[14:25] You have to get a responses.

[14:26] And you have to set up dates.

[14:28] And then you have to know how to talk in the dates.

[14:29] You have to know how to flirt beforehand.

[14:30] And afterhand.

[14:31] And I don't know what afterhand is,

[14:33] but apparently it's a thing.

[14:34] And so you got to have to have to have to have it.

[14:36] And then it's like, how do I do the second?

[14:37] How do I do the third day?

[14:38] What are smooth ways to proposition a woman to whatever?

[14:42] You get my idea.

[14:43] I'll stop there, fill the rest in with your imagination.

[14:46] And then propose.

[14:47] There we go.

[14:48] We just want straight to marriage.

[14:48] The whole thing is there's a lot of problems

[14:50] that are going to happen this process.

[14:51] And we don't need to solve them all.

[14:52] Think about it.

[14:53] Think about a dating person who is like,

[14:54] here's how to go from zero to merit.

[14:57] That would be a lot.

[14:58] We just have to solve the problem

[15:00] that's in front of them today.

[15:01] Now, one of the other issues with the lead man

[15:04] is, is it made for the right avatar?

[15:05] And this is a big one.

[15:07] And this is like, people messes when up a lot.

[15:09] And so they're like, OK, well, how to make your first five clients.

[15:13] I have some videos for that.

[15:15] But that's not my main avatar.

[15:16] Now, I am willing to help people out who are getting started.

[15:19] And that's OK.

[15:19] That's why I make those things.

[15:20] But is somebody who's just getting started

[15:22] my avatar today?

[15:23] No, but I'm betting on the fact that they will be years from now.

[15:26] But not because I want to give to that person today.

[15:30] And so if you have a spectrum of customers

[15:32] that you could potentially service,

[15:34] you're going to make some lead magnet

[15:35] is perfectly fit for the perfect customer that you want.

[15:38] And if you haven't gotten clear on the time

[15:40] because we want, then you're certainly not going

[15:41] to be able to make the right lead magnet.

[15:42] Now, I have a free chapter.

[15:43] I think it's called, you're acquisition.com.

[15:45] I think it's called, fourth slash avatar.

[15:47] I think that's what it is.

[15:48] But if you go your first avatar,

[15:50] acquisition.com or oxymorics from us, you can find it.

[15:52] But basically, if you're not sure how to pick

[15:54] your avatar, that chapter explained to it.

[15:56] It was actually kind of like a single that I released after

[15:59] the offer's book, I recommend you check it out.

[16:01] Anyways, now, once we have our lead magnet,

[16:04] we have their information.

[16:05] So what is that going to lead to?

[16:07] We're going to need to lead to something

[16:09] that's going to sell them, right?

[16:10] Who's going to warm up the prospect?

[16:12] And so this is where we get our video sales letter.

[16:17] This is VSL.

[16:18] It's just a fancy term here, fancy, fancy, fancy, fancy, fancy.

[16:21] By the way, if you want an example of a lead magnet,

[16:24] this is on that we have.

[16:25] So you can check this out.

[16:26] So 100% off scaling, roadmap.

[16:28] This is for business owners.

[16:30] If your business owner is trying to scale,

[16:31] then you're going to be at one of these 10 stages of scaling.

[16:33] And so what problem can I solve for you today?

[16:35] Well, if I can solve the current, controlling your business,

[16:37] and where this is, by the way, a reveal of problem,

[16:40] type of lead magnet.

[16:41] So I reveal the problem.

[16:43] And then I also give you the solution to do this.

[16:45] But the thing is, if you see this, and sometimes even just

[16:47] being, oh my god, this is exactly what I'm struggling with right now,

[16:50] then it probably increases the likely that you think,

[16:51] OK, I think this got to help me out.

[16:53] Simple as that.

[16:54] And it provides you more information

[16:56] to eventually make a decision.

[16:58] All right, so lead magnet sets the stage

[17:00] and attracts the exact type of prospect

[17:02] that I want to work with, right?

[17:03] Someone with qualifications.

[17:05] But now we have to convert them, right?

[17:07] And this is where our video sales letter comes into play.

[17:11] So the video sales letter, the video that you have here,

[17:13] is probably one of the highest leverage things

[17:15] that you can create in terms of sales, aids.

[17:19] Like if a lot of times you're like, man, ads don't work for me,

[17:23] it's not that ads don't work for you.

[17:24] So you haven't put enough friction in your process.

[17:26] And again, this is one of those things, everyone's afraid of.

[17:28] Everyone's afraid of adding steps, adding friction, adding

[17:30] questions, adding qualifications, having people

[17:32] watch things in order to make a purchasing decision.

[17:34] But I promise you, if you look at your customers

[17:37] over the last however long, most of them, almost all of them,

[17:42] will not have immediately bought something.

[17:44] Most of the times they will consume the hour, two hours,

[17:46] three hours plus of information from you in various formats

[17:51] before they decide to go through this process

[17:53] and ultimately buy.

[17:55] And so what we want to do is reverse engineer

[17:56] facilitate this.

[17:57] Like the big finding I had when I was in gym lunch,

[17:59] was that 78% of customers had consumed at least two long form

[18:05] pieces of content.

[18:06] Now I had podcasts, I had books, I had,

[18:09] I had a group that I had kind of the video version of those podcasts.

[18:12] And so 78% had consumed at least two.

[18:15] So in thinking about this, it was like,

[18:17] okay, so my average piece of long form content

[18:20] the time was something they'd been like,

[18:21] maybe 17 to 20 minutes.

[18:23] So basically people had to consume call it an hour, right?

[18:26] Of information from me in order to be willing to book

[18:29] and call and be warm and potentially buy.

[18:32] And so I was like, okay, if that's what it takes,

[18:34] why don't I try and force people to do that to become

[18:37] somebody who is likely to buy?

[18:39] If that's what 78% of people do before buying,

[18:42] well, then why don't I get 100% of my people

[18:43] to do the thing that 78% do that are the ultimate buyers?

[18:47] That's the idea.

[18:48] So if you're like, okay, VSL,

[18:50] what do I put inside this video?

[18:52] I'm gonna walk you through a very simple fight.

[18:54] There's a bunch of different versions of VSL

[18:57] that you can run.

[18:57] I'm not gonna get into that today.

[18:58] But people overcompagate this, right?

[19:02] They wanna make this seem like this big box of black magic.

[19:05] And I've made so many videos sales owners in my life

[19:08] that I can tell you, there is no big box of magic.

[19:12] And I'll give you two different structures

[19:14] that work really well, okay?

[19:15] So structure one is actually very similar to YouTube video.

[19:20] So you're gonna go the five piece,

[19:21] which is proof, promise, pain, plan, picture, okay?

[19:28] So what is this made?

[19:29] It means that I need to make some promise

[19:30] that they're gonna get from this video.

[19:31] I need to talk about the pain to demonstrate

[19:33] that I know where they're at right now.

[19:34] I need to give them proof that they,

[19:36] that they why they should believe me.

[19:37] And then I'm gonna allow the plan

[19:39] of how I'm gonna help them solve it.

[19:40] And then usually I want that to be a visual

[19:42] so they can understand hence the visual, right?

[19:44] And then after I've done all of these things

[19:47] and I go through my plan, right?

[19:49] The duh, here's my plan, okay?

[19:51] After I have this kind of meaty part,

[19:53] then I'm going to have what I consider

[19:55] the FAQ section, which is,

[19:57] would who people say when they get on the phone

[19:59] that they have questions about?

[20:00] I want to put all of the FAQs,

[20:02] every single one of them into this video.

[20:05] I wanna pre-handle the objections.

[20:08] And a lot of them are really

[20:09] sensical concerns.

[20:11] How long you been doing this?

[20:12] How do I know this is legit?

[20:14] Answer all of their concerns in the video.

[20:16] And then finally, I just call it a little proof stack

[20:19] at the end, which is you just put stories

[20:21] of successful customers, right?

[20:23] And you can put your CTA here.

[20:25] And then you put another CTA here.

[20:28] Saying by the way, this concludes the video.

[20:30] At the end of this, it's just gonna be a testimonial route.

[20:32] You can watch this if you want it.

[20:33] Now when you say that, I'll just tell you this right now.

[20:35] You think that people will watch them?

[20:37] People watch all.

[20:38] I'm just like you.

[20:39] All right, so this is a version of VSL, it works great.

[20:42] Another version, if you have something

[20:44] that is more well defined, right?

[20:47] So like if you're, when I say that,

[20:48] it's like if you, if you sell a service

[20:50] that people, if I went on the street and said,

[20:51] hey, do you know what electrician does?

[20:53] Do you know what each fact person does?

[20:54] And if somebody understands that a little bit better,

[20:56] then I spend less time on this, and I just go 5W's, right?

[21:01] Which is, you know, who, what, where, when, why?

[21:05] And then I'll still have my FAQs,

[21:07] still have my proof stack, and still have my CTAs.

[21:09] This is basically two different versions of the meat

[21:11] and guess what, both have worked.

[21:13] But I thought there's this big, box of magic.

[21:15] All we're doing is answering all the questions

[21:17] that someone might reasonably have

[21:19] before making a purchasing decision,

[21:20] so that when we get on the phone of them,

[21:22] we can just help them make a purchasing decision

[21:24] rather than having two calls

[21:25] where we're giving them information

[21:27] before they make a purchasing decision.

[21:28] So right now, if you, let's say that you run an ad campaign

[21:31] and you're like, man, it's taking me like three

[21:33] or four calls to close somebody.

[21:34] It's because this is the, this is the magic of this.

[21:38] If it's taking you two or three calls,

[21:40] then that tells you that prospects need two or three hours

[21:44] of information in order to make a buying decision.

[21:47] And so if you're efficient with it,

[21:48] those three hour calls can probably be covered

[21:51] if you are specific in what the FAQs are

[21:53] and all the concerns, and probably cover it

[21:56] in maybe 45, 90 minutes, if you're just very diligent

[21:59] about noting what the questions are.

[22:01] And I'll give you another pro tip on this,

[22:02] which is you want the FAQ to be in their language.

[22:08] So if someone says, I'm really busy right now,

[22:11] you want to have a way to handle, I'm really busy right now.

[22:14] Now they might also say, I've got a lot going on.

[22:17] Now to you might, you might be like,

[22:18] oh, because a salesman might think immediately,

[22:20] oh, well, that's just a timing objection.

[22:22] And the answer is yes, you're right.

[22:23] But the thing is is that someone might have six different ways

[22:26] of saying a timing objection

[22:27] and you want to have an FAQ that covers each of those five

[22:31] or six ways.

[22:32] Because if you said that to a salesman

[22:34] and they said, I'm really busy right now

[22:36] and then you responded with how you would overcome someone's

[22:39] saying, I've got a lot of, you know, plate spinging,

[22:42] you would actually have a slightly different overcome

[22:44] for that or objection handler.

[22:45] And so we need to basically say it in their language

[22:48] and then say the overcome that's appropriate

[22:50] to each of those things.

[22:52] So yes, that means you're going to have

[22:53] have to have an answer for their questions.

[22:56] But this should hopefully demystify all of the black

[22:59] voodoo magic around what is in one of these videos.

[23:01] You're just answering their questions.

[23:02] That's it.

[23:03] Now, I always get this question.

[23:05] Should I put my price in the VSL?

[23:07] Or should I not put my price in the VSL?

[23:09] The answer is it depends.

[23:11] Now, the reason I say this is there are some businesses

[23:15] where basically I tend to put price in my stuff.

[23:20] And that's because I have more demand than I can handle

[23:22] and I want to add friction to my process

[23:24] so that I can maximum utilize, you know, the sales team,

[23:27] right, not waste their time.

[23:28] If I had an underutilized sales team,

[23:31] then I'd be probably more willing to not have

[23:35] the money qualification there.

[23:37] I will say this though.

[23:38] The long-gribe doing business,

[23:39] the more I just end up putting all the information up front.

[23:43] And everyone's always afraid of, you know,

[23:46] what if I tell them, you know, the price is like,

[23:49] they're going to find out eventually, right?

[23:51] So I tend to try and cover as many things

[23:55] before the sales call as usually possible.

[23:58] Okay.

[23:58] So now you've got an ad.

[24:00] They clicked, they got the free thing.

[24:02] Now they've got the video sales letter,

[24:04] which by the way, Pro Tip,

[24:05] you can actually put the lead man inside of the VsL

[24:07] if you want to.

[24:08] So you be like, by the way, that thing about the girl thing,

[24:10] I'll tell you that in a second,

[24:11] then you get to the first third of your VsL,

[24:13] then you can slice in the lead man and say,

[24:15] hey, by the way, this is that tip.

[24:17] And guess what?

[24:18] I have 28 other tips that you can follow,

[24:19] which I'll show you in this video,

[24:20] and then you go through it, right?

[24:22] So you can do either of those formats both of them work.

[24:24] But now, we have to convert these people, all right?

[24:27] So I'm gonna put something here,

[24:31] and then something here.

[24:33] Sorry, that might little money.

[24:35] That is a phone for everyone born before, you know,

[24:38] 2000 or after 2000.

[24:39] Okay.

[24:40] So what is bands?

[24:41] I've talked about this before,

[24:42] so I'm not gonna hit on this a lot,

[24:43] but you wanna make sure they have budget authority need timing.

[24:46] Do they got the money to spend?

[24:47] They have the ability to make the decision.

[24:48] Do they need this thing?

[24:49] And it's right now the time they wanna buy.

[24:51] If we can answer those four things,

[24:52] and you do that in the application,

[24:54] or if you have a scheduler, right?

[24:55] Where they're booking a call,

[24:57] you make sure that those are the questions

[24:58] that are being asked there,

[24:59] and you only, and here's the tough part,

[25:01] you actually only take calls with people

[25:02] who say they have the money to spend,

[25:04] they have the authority to make the decision.

[25:05] They have the need, and they're really new for now.

[25:07] Now, how much easier do you of a call do you think it is

[25:10] when someone's gotten value from you?

[25:11] They then fully understand the questions

[25:13] that someone might ask around making purchasing

[25:17] the decision from you.

[25:18] They say they have the money at the time

[25:19] they need the authority to do it.

[25:21] Now you're talking to them.

[25:23] How likely is you think you're gonna close it?

[25:25] Way higher than if you didn't have all that stuff, right?

[25:28] So, the reason that this process right here

[25:33] is the most efficient way of converting traffic

[25:37] is that it's kind of like a microwave, right?

[25:40] You take someone from a cold prospect to a hot prospect.

[25:43] It's like you can, you know, you can slow cook it,

[25:45] you can simmer it, you can kind of bake it over time.

[25:47] I was like, where do you just nuked that thing?

[25:48] And so this is basically like nuking a prospect.

[25:51] How do we, how do we just bomb them with all,

[25:53] because I think what I'm gonna say is,

[25:55] if someone's like, I've followed you for a year, right?

[25:58] If someone followed short form for a year

[26:00] and let's say they consumed five pieces a week,

[26:03] which would be a crazy amount,

[26:04] 250 shorts.

[26:06] Well, the average shorts,

[26:07] let's just be generous here and say it's 30 seconds, which it isn't.

[26:10] All right, so that would mean that they've consumed

[26:11] 120 minutes, about two hours.

[26:15] Okay, so we can have them consume 120 minutes

[26:17] over a year and then buy.

[26:18] You've got that much information to make us out.

[26:20] Or we can just have them consume all two hours of front.

[26:24] And so think about this,

[26:25] like I think a lot about sales processes

[26:29] as a plane taking off.

[26:31] This is my, like this is my Alex's very simple visual.

[26:33] All right, so we've got our plane, right?

[26:35] This here's our plane, the little wheels on our plane.

[26:38] I don't know, just go with it.

[26:39] All right, here's my plane, to, to, to, to, to, to,

[26:41] and we gotta put a little, a little bit a little backwink thing.

[26:44] Ooh, this is tough.

[26:46] Okay, there's my, there's my terrible plane.

[26:48] All right, the thing is is, could this plane take

[26:50] off on this runway?

[26:51] No, the plane's too big.

[26:53] So I have to increase the size of my runway

[26:55] to give this plane enough lift to take off.

[26:58] The size of this runway is the amount of information

[27:00] that you need to tell the prospect.

[27:02] And so if we know that somebody needs two hours

[27:04] to make a person's decision, then what do you think

[27:06] we've done?

[27:07] They consume a little bit here.

[27:08] They're gonna consume, you know, maybe 30 to 45 minutes here, right?

[27:12] And then on the call, what do you think we're gonna get here?

[27:14] Another hour.

[27:16] And so when we add all this together,

[27:18] they've gotten about two hours of information from us,

[27:20] but we did it in the span of a couple days,

[27:22] rather than over a year, right?

[27:25] And this is why this is kind of like the RAM rod,

[27:27] the fastest way of monetizing within a business.

[27:31] Now, what happens to all the leads

[27:33] that go through this process

[27:34] and don't necessarily wanna purchase immediately?

[27:36] The logical people, the people that actually make sense

[27:38] and they're not crazy, okay?

[27:39] So what do we do with all these people?

[27:40] Well, we wanna put them somewhere

[27:42] that we give them long-term nurture,

[27:43] where we just say, oh, you are just the type of person

[27:45] needs more information to make a decision.

[27:47] No worries, that I'm just gonna give you more information.

[27:50] And I'm gonna do that, provide more value over a longer period of time.

[27:52] And so that's where things like having a school group,

[27:54] where you just dump all the extra leads into,

[27:56] and you keep making content there,

[27:57] and you answer their questions there until eventually they're like,

[27:59] hey, I do actually wanna take some action on this.

[28:01] And then boom, you send them, you run them through the process,

[28:03] you microwave them again, you reheat them, right?

[28:05] And then boom, you make the sale, right?

[28:07] That's the idea.

[28:08] So this long-term nurture, once people go through that,

[28:10] they're still gonna come right back through the front door again,

[28:13] and then get reheated.

[28:14] These are the four steps.

[28:16] You make your ads, you have a bang or lead magnet,

[28:19] you have a VSL, and then you qualify the person before the sale.

[28:23] And pro tip, you know, 4.5 is that for everybody who doesn't buy,

[28:28] you have to put them in some sort of email sequence

[28:29] or group or both, where you continue to provide value,

[28:32] you continue to basically answer all these little FAQs

[28:34] that they've had, because maybe they've got other ones,

[28:36] or maybe they just need to see more proof,

[28:38] some people just need more information to make the decision.

[28:41] That's all it comes down to.

[28:42] And when you do that, and you provide as much information as possible,

[28:45] you can very away how our person is the audience.

[28:46] So let me give you the massive pro tip,

[28:48] the thing that took me way too long to understand.

[28:50] What do you think of brand is?

[28:51] We're giving someone tons of information

[28:53] over a long period of time about who we are,

[28:57] what were about our way of doing things.

[28:59] And so the reason that brands

[29:00] grow significantly bigger than the people who just do this,

[29:02] like if you just do this,

[29:04] you're gonna be able to make some money,

[29:05] but you'll quickly cap.

[29:06] You'll be able to make money, but you will cap.

[29:08] To build the brand, we have to have this thing be enormous.

[29:13] And then this thing ends up being our eyeballs

[29:17] at the front of this, so that we have this enormous audience

[29:20] of people that have gotten value from us day in and day out

[29:24] for an extended period of time.

[29:26] That is then what over time, if you,

[29:29] it's like, I think about it like this.

[29:30] It's like you've got this,

[29:31] this pyramid of people who are interested in your stuff.

[29:34] And this is as they get more information, right?

[29:37] They move up the pyramid.

[29:38] And so all we're gonna do is we're gonna have these people

[29:41] or the ones who give us money.

[29:42] And all these people aren't gonna do anything.

[29:44] They're just gonna be like, man, this guy's great,

[29:46] or this guy's great, right?

[29:47] So if we wanna grow this little slice here,

[29:51] what do we do?

[29:52] Grow the bottom, you grow the base.

[29:54] And this fundamentally is what Grunga Brenna's about.

[29:57] You're growing the base.

[29:58] So that the top of the pyramid is way bigger than over here.

[30:02] Where you have to try and take someone up the elevator

[30:05] using the force that process that I just walked through.

[30:07] So that is my blueprint for unlocking your businesses,

[30:09] maximum monetization potential.

[30:11] And if you want to send this even more in depth,

[30:14] then you'll love this video.

[30:15] We're actually gonna do a full live breakdown

[30:16] of the business owner's funnel.

[30:17] Enjoy.

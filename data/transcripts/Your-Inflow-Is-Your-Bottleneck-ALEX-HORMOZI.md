[00:00] They're like, man, these guys just expect me to sell all day.

[00:03] And the answer is, yes.

[00:05] I wanted to make this because I woke up with this on my mind and I think it was relevant.

[00:08] So I was looking through our weekly reports and I was looking at the sales team stuff and

[00:14] I was looking at the JLX stuff which is our fulfillment side.

[00:17] And I thought this was really fascinating.

[00:19] I would share this with you.

[00:20] So one of the things that happens is we get a lot of people who come on and they say,

[00:26] you know, we're like, hey, what's your goal right now?

[00:27] What are you trying to accomplish?

[00:29] And a lot of James is like, man, if I could get 300 members, they would be amazing.

[00:32] Like 200 members of the amazing.

[00:34] I could 500 members of the amazing, right?

[00:36] And so they have these goals, right?

[00:39] And yet they don't follow the simple math of getting there.

[00:42] And so most times the inflow is the cap, right?

[00:46] Now, there's obviously, you probably, if you've ever followed my stuff for long enough,

[00:49] you'd know that I talked a lot about retention, about lifetime value, et cetera, right?

[00:54] But at a basic level, there is at some point what I would consider acceptable metrics, right?

[01:00] And what that means is let's say that you're, you know, if you're in the service base business,

[01:05] you're never going to get your turn below 1%.

[01:08] I mean, it's just, it's very unlikely, right?

[01:11] And that's, and if you are in that, it's typically because you're growing purely off organic

[01:15] referrals, which is awesome.

[01:17] But if you want to be massive, you need to grow off everything.

[01:19] You need to grow off organic, you need to grow off outbound, you need to grow off,

[01:23] paid acquisition, right, running ads.

[01:25] And the issue that I just continue to see is, and so then, so this last week, I think we had like 10

[01:31] gyms pause on GLX.

[01:34] And so GLX is our kind of done for you side.

[01:37] And all 10 of them paused because there was too much inflow.

[01:41] They could not handle the leaflow and the appointments that were being set for them.

[01:47] And I'm going to pause that right there.

[01:49] And Lailu was on a podcast this last week as well with, I think it's push press.

[01:54] I think it's push press.

[01:55] And the CEO of push press was like, you know, we've heard that the number one complaint

[02:01] that we hear from people, you know, from our customers who have worked with you is that

[02:05] they're like, man, these guys just expect me to sell all day.

[02:09] And the answer is, yes, because that's what you said you wanted, right?

[02:14] And so what's interesting for me is most people want to full-gäm until they actually

[02:17] have a full-gäm or see what's required to get a full-gäm, right?

[02:20] And so when we used to fly out and force gyms to grow because we didn't have limiting

[02:24] beliefs around growing a gym, someone would have 80 clients at their CrossFit.

[02:29] And then in 21 days they'd have 280 clients at their CrossFit and they'd be like, holy

[02:35] shit, what do I do?

[02:37] I did not sign up for this.

[02:38] It's like, actually, you did sign up for this.

[02:41] And so it reminds me, I'm going to pull this up for you.

[02:44] My favorite magic parts of all time.

[02:48] All right, it was called Burning Wish.

[02:50] So Dr. Cashy sent me a card versus really cute of them.

[02:53] And underneath it says, she wished for a weapon, but for not the skill, sorry, she wished

[02:57] for a weapon, but not for the skill to wield it.

[02:59] And I feel like a lot of times that's what happens is at least for the people who are coming

[03:04] in to Gilex under prepared.

[03:07] Is there like, I really want to grow?

[03:09] I want to get new customers, right?

[03:10] Our top client right now, in the last 30 days, signed up 130 new clients, right?

[03:16] 103.

[03:17] And we actually, that's in the last 30 days, but she signed up 130 in the last 2.5 weeks.

[03:23] So if we give it another like 1.5 weeks, she'll probably top 200 new clients, right?

[03:30] If you want a 200, 300, 400, 500 person facility, and you are not able to sign up 20

[03:39] new clients a week, you will not get there, right?

[03:43] Because this is where the acceptable metrics parts comes in.

[03:46] I would like to give you permission that if you have a service-based business, all right?

[03:51] Services of any kind.

[03:53] Anything that is easy in is easy out.

[03:56] And you're like, well, I mean, we have to onboard them and what you should be, right?

[03:59] But easy in, service is easy in.

[04:02] Switching from your CRM to another CRM, not easy, right?

[04:07] Big pain in the ass.

[04:08] And so the likely that you switch is very, very low, which is why software and things

[04:12] like that are much stickier than services are.

[04:15] And so you have to kind of accept that that comes with the territory.

[04:18] So if you're selling service and you want to be big, then you have to know that there's

[04:23] going to be a back-insure and that's going to occur.

[04:25] And that's just because easy and easy out in the top works, right?

[04:28] But if you have easy in and you're not maximizing the fact that that's your advantage

[04:33] and services that you can scale quickly, right?

[04:36] You're inflow.

[04:37] Then you're not using one of the primary advantages of being a service provider.

[04:42] And so if it's like, I want to get to 200, let's say, let's say 300 members, right?

[04:47] I'm going to get to 300 members.

[04:49] Okay, cool.

[04:50] You want to get to 300 members.

[04:51] Now your turns 10% industry average.

[04:55] And you can only sign up 10 trials a week.

[04:59] And that's you maxed out, right?

[05:00] Then new prospects per week, they give you credit card for some front end program or trial

[05:05] of some sort, right?

[05:07] You can only sign up 10 of those a week.

[05:09] Now even somebody who comes in and signs up straight into EFT, what we have noticed is we

[05:13] still have to resell them on a longer term because really there's the I'm going to try

[05:18] it phase and then there's the I'm going to commit phase.

[05:21] And even if like I said, you sign someone up for recurring, it doesn't actually mean

[05:23] they'll stick until they really make the second sale.

[05:25] And we've seen that across the board for us and our dreams at least.

[05:28] Okay?

[05:29] If you can only take on 10 new potential prospects, right?

[05:35] per week.

[05:35] And that's your cap.

[05:37] And you want to get to 300 members.

[05:39] Then that would mean that you have to convert 75% of them week in week out.

[05:43] And a lot of people are not doing that.

[05:45] And 10 mind you means that you're closing a 50% of four calls a day, right?

[05:52] That are showing.

[05:53] And let's say you're getting half those calls.

[05:54] Which means you have to have eight scheduled appointments a day.

[05:57] Now, most gyms that I talk to don't even have their their stressed out of their

[06:02] mind with that, right?

[06:03] But that's just for them to get 20 or 30 new customers a month.

[06:08] You want to get to 500, you want to get to 400, you have to accept the fact that you're

[06:12] going to be selling all day because you're selling a service and you're trying to get to

[06:15] a high number.

[06:17] And so most times, most times people have goals and are disconnected from the actions

[06:22] that are required to get there, right?

[06:24] And the numbers, the basic math and most people just don't do the math.

[06:28] So I would highly encourage you if you know what your turn is.

[06:33] Look backwards and think, okay, if I'm going to lose 20 customers a month and I'm at 200,

[06:38] and I want to get to 400.

[06:40] A lot of times you don't just double your info.

[06:42] Like sometimes you have to do even more than that because you also lose some efficiency

[06:45] on the back.

[06:46] It's part of the game, right?

[06:47] And so if you're not 10 you're losing 20, all right?

[06:50] And so if you know you're converting half of your trials, that means you have to make 40

[06:53] sales a month, all right?

[06:55] The industry average, by the way, is 35%.

[06:57] Which means that if you wanted to replace those 20, you'd have to sell 60 trials a month,

[07:01] okay, of some sort, 60 front and programs of some sort per month.

[07:06] If you can't do that, you will never grow and you will always wonder why.

[07:12] All right?

[07:13] And so this message is basically for anyone who wants to be a big dog.

[07:17] If you want to dominate the market, which is the marketing that most people respond to,

[07:21] like dominate your competition, all that kind of stuff, right?

[07:25] You want to be a seven figure gym, okay?

[07:27] Cool.

[07:28] Then you have to do the math that seven figure gyms do.

[07:30] And I do not know a single one of them that do not know how to take on high numbers

[07:36] of traffic on a weekend, week out basis, right?

[07:40] What I continue to see is I'm going to turn my ads on for a couple of weeks and I'll turn

[07:44] them off.

[07:45] And then we got to go to service those people.

[07:46] No, no, no, no, no.

[07:47] If you want to scale your inflow never stops.

[07:51] You have to be able to sign up people this week and next week and the week after that and

[07:54] the week after that and fulfill.

[07:56] You need to be doing both things concurrently.

[07:58] And if you're incapable of doing that, it means you're not able to manage your schedule

[08:02] of your team, right?

[08:04] They have to know that the first two hours of the day.

[08:07] It's blocked on their time is going for app on going for thumb.

[08:11] Like they're reaching out to your existing customers to make sure that they stay.

[08:14] Then you have two hours of day that's blocked for onboarding for new customers.

[08:16] Then you have orientations, right?

[08:18] All that stuff.

[08:19] And you have to disperse the meetings that have to happen in order to make this entire

[08:24] model work.

[08:26] And that's with any service business.

[08:28] This works the same for us.

[08:30] We've got sales appointments.

[08:31] We have kick off calls.

[08:32] We have builds that happen in the background.

[08:34] And then we have ongoing check-ins to make sure the clients are doing well.

[08:38] Beyond that, we still have daily calls with me to make sure that they're being able to

[08:42] sell and convert and all that kind of stuff.

[08:45] And so the whole point of this is, if you're not where you want to be, a lot of time

[08:51] it's because your inflow is your bottleneck and you have an operationally prepared yourself

[08:55] for what it actually looks like to sign up 100 people in a month, right?

[09:00] 50, 60, 80 new people in a month.

[09:02] The math is there.

[09:03] If you want to do it, you can do it.

[09:05] But I'm just seeing this more times than not.

[09:09] And then when Dan said it for press press, that the number of complaints that people

[09:13] got from gym monsters is like, they're just flooded me with, they expected me to sell

[09:18] a day.

[09:19] Yeah, because that's what you said you wanted.

[09:21] Either switch your goal or switch your head, right?

[09:26] Because if you want to get to hear, it's just math backwards.

[09:31] So just most people have not done that math.

[09:34] Here's how you do the math.

[09:36] If you want to grow, let's say 300 members.

[09:42] Let's say your turn is 10%.

[09:45] That means you need to sign up 30 people per month, too break even.

[09:49] Now, let's just get those 30, let's say you convert half because they get the 300,

[09:53] you have some skills, right?

[09:55] So you're converting half your front and people, which means you're at 60 new signups per

[09:58] month.

[09:59] That's 15 a week, all right?

[10:00] Now, if you're selling one out of two that you're talking to, now you're talking

[10:04] 120 a month of people who you're talking to.

[10:09] So that's 30 a week, roughly, right?

[10:12] That you're talking to.

[10:13] And you're probably selling only five days or now here's another way I could go off.

[10:16] And it's like, we only sell two days a week because we'll good luck trying to sell 30 people

[10:20] in two days.

[10:21] It's very unlikely that it's going to happen.

[10:23] So if you're not, let's say you're selling six days and you're selling 30.

[10:27] So you got to sell five people a day.

[10:28] I'm sorry, meet with five people per day, which is not that unreasonable.

[10:31] It's five 30 minute sessions.

[10:32] It's two and a half hours, three hours of sales.

[10:34] This is not crazy, right?

[10:37] Now, you're still going to have show ups, right?

[10:40] Which is going to be another inefficiency.

[10:42] All right?

[10:42] So they go 30 goes to 60 appointments a week.

[10:45] Ooh, interesting.

[10:47] All right.

[10:47] Now we're at 60 appointments a week.

[10:49] And we're just maintaining 300.

[10:52] We're not even growing to get there yet.

[10:54] Interesting, right?

[10:56] And so now we're seeing how this math starts to work out.

[10:58] I'm like, okay.

[10:59] So now if I wanted to grow in extra 30 on top of that,

[11:03] then I needed to have even more.

[11:05] I've needed double what I just said, okay?

[11:08] And so we have 30 conversions from 60 front-end sales,

[11:14] which is half of 120 meetups, 120 client conversations per month,

[11:19] okay?

[11:20] That and then you have half of those that show for their appointments,

[11:25] and then you need to double that to grow, right?

[11:28] That's the math.

[11:29] And so if you're not able to deal with that math,

[11:33] then you will not get there.

[11:35] And sometimes it's just like just giving the sheer reality

[11:38] of the situation is like, it's a volume game.

[11:41] It's a math game.

[11:42] It's the same people who get Ben Atta-Shap

[11:45] over one person who says, I gotta talk to my husband.

[11:48] I don't have my card on me.

[11:49] It's like cool, move on.

[11:50] Champions have short memories, right?

[11:53] They bounce back fast.

[11:55] They're unaffected by losses because they're just thinking,

[11:58] I know I need to close half, which means,

[12:00] here's the news flash.

[12:02] If you have to meet with 200 people,

[12:03] 100 people are gonna say no.

[12:06] And you have to be emotionally okay with that

[12:08] because you just understand the numbers, right?

[12:11] You know what I mean?

[12:11] I mean, you should try and get better at your craft.

[12:14] Always, of course, right?

[12:16] But if you just can't accept emotionally

[12:19] and this is what I continue to see,

[12:21] is that some guys just can't take the emotional beating

[12:23] if having people say no, which is why they'll never grow, right?

[12:27] And like the most experienced salespeople,

[12:28] they don't get bothered, they're like, yeah,

[12:30] they understand that people come with their own preconceived

[12:32] notions to the call.

[12:34] It's not about you, the salesmen.

[12:36] It's about them, right?

[12:37] And just remembering, it's about them.

[12:40] So don't get bothered hurt if for some reason someone says no.

[12:43] Of course they have excuses.

[12:44] That's why they're not in shape.

[12:45] Of course they have limiting beliefs.

[12:47] That's why they're not in shape.

[12:48] And so if we're gonna expect that they're not gonna come

[12:50] with emotional baggage to the call or to the meeting,

[12:53] it's ridiculous, right?

[12:54] And so then if we're to take this back one step, right?

[12:57] And we said, let's say 240 consoles,

[13:00] we're gonna have to be generating 15 leads a day, right?

[13:04] Roughly.

[13:05] Huh, well, what does this take to get 15 leads a day in cost?

[13:09] Well, let's back into it.

[13:11] 15 leads a day, 10 bucks a lead, $150,

[13:14] it's $4,500 an ad spend per month.

[13:18] Just a math.

[13:19] And I think that a lot of people don't confront them at,

[13:21] they make these goals and don't think about what it takes

[13:24] to get there.

[13:24] And then as soon as it even gets to a third

[13:26] of what it would actually take to get there,

[13:28] to achieve what they want, they're like,

[13:30] oh my God, this is just so much.

[13:32] So, well, yeah, if that's what you want,

[13:34] then this is how this is how it works.

[13:37] It's like why wanna be a champion body motor.

[13:38] Okay, well, I can only work out three days a week for an hour.

[13:42] Okay, you're not.

[13:45] Okay, right?

[13:47] And so it's like, do you wanna be a champion?

[13:49] Or do you just wanna be another person who also ran?

[13:51] And that's fine.

[13:52] If that's what you want, it's just I'm not hearing

[13:55] that that's what you want.

[13:56] So either people need to get real clear

[13:58] in what they really want or real,

[14:00] and then make the adjustments accordingly,

[14:03] or realize that it's not actually their priority.

[14:06] And I could go into a whole other thing about,

[14:08] like priorities are just priorities.

[14:10] There's never really conflicting priorities.

[14:12] You just have one that is a bigger priority than another.

[14:14] And if it conflicts, then the other one is a secondary priority.

[14:17] And sometimes priorities do conflict in terms of their nature,

[14:20] but not their importance.

[14:22] And so you just need to figure out

[14:23] which of these things is more important to me.

[14:25] But in most times, it's simply being able to delegate time

[14:29] and appropriate on a calendar when things need to get done.

[14:33] If we know that we have to onboard 30 new customers per week,

[14:37] then how do we fit, let's say,

[14:39] 30, 30 minute consultations in.

[14:42] Okay, it's 15 hours a week.

[14:44] I've got one team member, they're here five days a week.

[14:46] There's three hours on their calendar.

[14:48] Great.

[14:49] So now that one person has three hours a day on their calendar,

[14:52] five days a week for taking on new customers.

[14:55] Okay, that seems reasonable.

[14:56] They still have another five hours.

[14:58] And if they have to do conversion meetings,

[14:59] which is to convert them into a long-term membership,

[15:02] but from a trial or a front-end program.

[15:05] Now, from those people,

[15:08] we know that we again have 30 people we gotta meet with.

[15:11] And so of those 30 people, and it's the say,

[15:13] it's gonna take a 30 minute consult

[15:15] to sell someone into membership.

[15:16] Boom, not that person's at six hours a day.

[15:19] All right, this is just one employee.

[15:20] And so this one employee is now managing the onboarding

[15:24] and the conversion sales.

[15:26] And then they have two hours a day

[15:27] to do continuous reachouts to the existing customers.

[15:30] Great, that is a role.

[15:31] And then you have a salesperson who's gonna,

[15:33] well, I mean, that has to be a full time salesperson's

[15:35] gonna hit those numbers, right?

[15:37] They're gonna meet with 60 people, right?

[15:39] 60 people, 60 days a week, it's 10 a day, right?

[15:42] 30 minutes, it's only five hours, right?

[15:44] And so if you're looking at this,

[15:46] this is the game.

[15:47] Is how long does it take,

[15:49] how many of them do we have, block the time?

[15:52] And that is how you scale.

[15:54] That's it, that's all there is, right?

[15:56] And just confronting the math.

[15:59] Now you can try and tweak it in and control,

[16:00] but you have to understand,

[16:01] you're not gonna have orders of magnitude improvements.

[16:03] You're not gonna sell 100% of people who show up,

[16:06] you're not gonna keep 100% of people month over month.

[16:08] It just doesn't happen, right?

[16:09] It's just, it just doesn't.

[16:11] And so you have to deal with what is, right?

[16:14] You're always gonna try to improve, and that's normal.

[16:16] But if you wait for always your improvements,

[16:18] you will never start, and you will never get to where

[16:20] you're trying to go.

[16:21] And so that is my message for the week.

[16:24] Is that your inflow is probably your bottleneck,

[16:26] and there has to be acceptable metrics

[16:28] that you can extrapolate off of,

[16:30] and then work backwards into how much time that's required,

[16:32] and how many people require to help you get there.

[16:34] And if that means for you as the provider,

[16:36] or the owner of the business, that you need to work double time,

[16:38] in order to afford the person who's gonna be able

[16:40] to release the bottleneck, then that is part of the game.

[16:43] All right?

[16:44] So anyways, I hope you guys have an amazing Monday,

[16:46] I hope you look at money math,

[16:47] I hope you look at time math,

[16:49] to figure out how you get break your bottlenecks,

[16:51] so you can get to the gym that you want,

[16:53] whether that's Corona or not Corona or remote,

[16:56] or launching anything, or you have a B2B business,

[17:00] it doesn't matter the metrics are all the same.

[17:02] All right, so lots of love, hope you guys are stoked

[17:05] for this week, cause I am, we're super excited,

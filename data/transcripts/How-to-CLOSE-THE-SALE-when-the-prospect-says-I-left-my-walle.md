[00:00] In this video, I'm going to walk you through exactly how you can overcome.

[00:03] I forgot my wallet at home.

[00:06] You don't know how I am named, I'm Josie, I own acquisition.com.

[00:08] It's a portfolio of E-learning and coaching businesses that does about 85 million dollars

[00:12] year. And so what I want to talk to you about today is how do you overcome this?

[00:14] And you can do this in person or you can do it over the phone.

[00:16] And there's a process that we've used and this is just I had to learn this the hard way.

[00:20] It was figuring out how can I set this up so that I can decrease the likelihood that someone says they forgot.

[00:24] They're all right. Now, notwithstanding, you probably messed something up up in the

[00:28] sale earlier, which would make them say that because realistically no one ever leaves their home

[00:31] without something to pay with. Like think about yourself. You've literally never left home without

[00:35] a way to pay for stuff. All right. So like it's not actually real, but it's nice to have stuff in your

[00:40] back pocket to know how to decrease the likelihood that it comes up and then how to address it if it does.

[00:44] Okay. And so once we've gone to the end of the sale and we say like fair enough and there's like,

[00:48] yes, and you say, cool, let me see your ID, do you have your ID on you, which is the question that I would.

[00:52] And I would always do this. And like if you're in person or you probably do it on Zoom,

[00:55] you just look at them. You like Javier Adionium. And I do this. And then they know that they take out the

[00:59] ID, right? And so what happens is they'll either take out their purse if it's a lady or it's a guy

[01:04] who'll take out his phone or his wallet wherever he keeps his ID. Now, the next part that's important here

[01:09] is that especially if you're in person, but you can also see the Sones' name is that when they're

[01:12] taking it out, they're usually have their ID next to the things that they do payment with. And so once they

[01:16] have given you the ID, because it's much easier to ask someone for their ID than it has to ask them for their

[01:20] payment method, you then say, awesome. And so you take, you see it, you take a picture of it if it's on

[01:24] Zoom because you need it for your stuff. Or if you're in person, you should take it from them.

[01:28] And the reason you do this is because it actually builds trust when you give it back. All right,

[01:31] because it means that like, hey, you have nothing to fear here. I grabbed it from you. And I'm giving

[01:34] it back. But it's much easier to grab someone's ID than it just grabs someone's credit card. All right.

[01:38] So hey, Javier Adionium, right? They say, yes, they pull their wallet out. You can see the

[01:42] fact that they have cards. You say, great, you take it. You write down the stuff you make, oh, you're

[01:45] from Sones. So that's so cool. I know I have a dog and Michigan blah, blah, blah, whatever. You write it out.

[01:50] And then you hold it back and you hold onto it and you look at them and you say, let me trade

[01:54] you for the card you want to use. Okay. Let me trade you for the card you want to use. And so when you say that

[01:59] you're literally staring and ideally, if you're in person, I would shake the card in the direction

[02:04] of the wallet that's sitting on the table or the phone that they have that has like the slots in

[02:08] it or whatever or their purse. Whatever it is, like you're shaking in the directions to the

[02:11] know that they need that you're indicating that they need to take out their wallet. Okay. So at this point,

[02:15] though usually you've already, you've already set the scene so that you're not going to have an issue

[02:19] with this. Now, this is the only thing they can possibly say at this point because they've now

[02:24] shown you that they have payment methods in front of them. They will then say, I don't have the card

[02:28] that I want to use. Okay. And so in this instance, there's two things that you can do from this

[02:32] point besides like, and depending on the level of rapport, you can back up as that can be like,

[02:36] hey, Sandy, listen, I don't want to make you feel like you don't uncomfortable in any way. And this is where

[02:40] you have to ask questions based on some of the information that you've had up this point. It's like,

[02:43] what would make this not a fit for you? Right? And sometimes it's like, you just you just skip all

[02:46] the bullshit and you just ask like, hey, let's just pivot first. Don't worry about signing up.

[02:50] I just want to talk to you, like, what did you come in here for? I want to lose weight. Okay. Cool.

[02:54] What if you don't, like, you basically get to re-remind them in the sale. But if you don't have to

[02:57] that, here's the two ways you can overcome this. Number one is they'll always have their phone on them.

[03:00] Okay. Now, if they don't have their phone on them, like every sequel if you were being a

[03:03] planet Earth has their phone on them, right? For everybody who's online, of course, there are countries

[03:07] that don't have phones and that is unfortunate that you're on YouTube and you're watching this. So you have

[03:11] a phone. Okay. So you ask them to take their phone out or and then you say, cool, what bank do you

[03:15] bang with? And then they'll say whatever bank they're bang with. They're like, cool, can you pull up your

[03:19] banking app real quick? And they'll be like, okay, cool, go to statements. As soon as you go to statements,

[03:23] you say, cool, there, you can click any of the months, it doesn't really matter. And on the top

[03:26] right, you'll see your count number. And so right there, it's the full account number for their

[03:31] their account. And you can write that down in lieu of a credit card. It's an ACH transaction. If you

[03:35] can't do ACH transactions, you should get that set up with whoever processes your money because it

[03:40] opens up another way for you to make a sound. The other alternative is to say, hey,

[03:44] no worries. Do you have your Apple wallet set up? Now, I wouldn't do that as my go to. I would do the

[03:48] bank statement in ACH play first because just about everybody who bangs has their banking app on their

[03:53] phone and a way to pull the statements and see the account number. So the likely that you do that

[03:56] is virtually 100%. And so this works especially well for in person sales because like they're right

[04:02] there, they have their phone. You can say, cool, cool, do you have your phone on you? They'll say,

[04:05] yes, obviously, say, cool, pull your banking app up. They pull it up. You walk them through statements.

[04:10] Account numbers at the top right and you write it down. If you don't do ACH, go get it set up so that

[04:13] you can do this to overcome these issues. And then option two is you have them pull up Apple wallet

[04:18] and if they don't have Apple wallet then you're like, cool, how about this? Why don't you put one of

[04:21] the cards you don't want to use down right now because I have to do that at the policy. So you put

[04:25] it outside of yourself like, hey, this is just how we've always done it. And you get them right down

[04:28] the card that they don't want to use. We say, no worries. What I'll do is I'll delay the payment for

[04:33] for 24 hours and so that you can go home and just and just swap whatever card you want, you want to

[04:38] use for it. Okay, so it'll run tomorrow. So just make sure that when you get back and I'll shoot you

[04:42] a text. What time you get home? Okay, cool. I said no more more more. I found once you said no more

[04:45] more, my phone because you have your phone out. And I'll call you at that time. Cool, great. And then

[04:49] she can get it. And so to walk you through this, you write down the info and make a joke about where

[04:54] they're from and you build you reinforced report. Indicate and shake it back. Then, say, hey, let me

[04:58] trade you for the card you want to use. Most times this will like this will handle 80% of the

[05:02] scenarios anyways. They'll give you the card. If they don't give you the card, right? Because they say,

[05:06] I don't have the card that I want to use because it's the only thing they can really say in this

[05:10] instance. As you say, cool, pull your banking app up, get ACH. If you can't do that, you've got Apple

[05:14] wallet which you can see, do you use Apple wallet if they say no. Then you go to the final step that

[05:19] you can do, which is let me just use one of the other cards you have. We'll delay the date

[05:22] and then I'll text you in a minute or when you get home so that we can swap the cards. Very

[05:25] enough. Right. Now, either way, the deal was closed with that credit card and you have the contract

[05:29] and file that says that. Okay, so you're fine, but it's up to them to swap it out. Now, the key point

[05:34] here is that you can ask questions like, hey, you just want to do this right? Now they're like,

[05:38] yeah, of course. And you're like, okay, cool, then let's just put this other card in. And then when

[05:41] you go home, you can swap it out for me. All right, fair enough? Easy. Okay, cool. Now, sometimes it's like,

[05:46] well, I don't have enough money. And so then you're like, cool, what day do you get paid? And a lot

[05:50] of times it's like, whenever I'd have like Friday's coming up awesome. So what, today's Wednesday,

[05:53] let's put it on Friday and that's when you get paid. Cool. Okay, great. Boom. And a lot of

[05:57] times you can just close the deal because we just have to identify with the issues. And you can usually tell

[06:00] basically the rapport of the person that sometimes they're hesitant because they actually don't know

[06:03] if they have money or they're hesitant because they don't want to do the program. And that's why it's

[06:06] important to ask like, hey, you sure you still want to do this? Like, I just want you to get what you said

[06:10] you wanted to come in your for. They say, yeah, no, no, no, I want to do it. It's like, cool, then let's just

[06:13] put the card down. That gets you and you locked your spot up like you're in the program. You're good.

[06:16] And then when you get home, just swap the card to when you use, right? And it's like cool,

[06:19] got it. That is the four five step process. A, I walk through to decrease the likely that someone

[06:24] says they left their wallet at home. And then we can prove that they didn't leave their wallet at home.

[06:27] If they say they left the type of payment that they wanted, the steps to overcome that. So that

[06:30] that doesn't blow up the deal for you. All right. And I learned this just from doing a zillion sales

[06:35] in my life and step by step, adding these little tweaks that improve the likelihood that I was

[06:39] actually going to close the deal. And so my hope is that you can use this immediately and not have to go

[06:43] through all those sales, uh, to use the stuff in your life. All right. So keeping all some lots of

[06:47] of my zineys, I'll see you guys in the next video. Bye.

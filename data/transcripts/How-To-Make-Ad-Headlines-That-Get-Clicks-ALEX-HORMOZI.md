[00:00] Maybe it was one everyone had in Sunday who,

[00:01] because they're rocking and rolling on your Sunday morning,

[00:04] evening afternoon, whatever time zone you are watching

[00:07] or listening to this.

[00:08] And I recently had been doing a deep dive into

[00:11] funnel world and ads for both B2B and B2C.

[00:15] I've been kind of like taking a more Frenchy report lately.

[00:19] And so I wanted to make this because I recently had a

[00:21] Jamon Ressen, me some of there.

[00:22] Ads.

[00:24] And I was like, oh crap, these are definitely not going to

[00:26] convert.

[00:26] And so I wanted to just give basically

[00:29] headline stuff that will always just make you more money.

[00:33] And so the formula that I've used for all of the

[00:37] fitness ads that we ran and that I ran at my gyms and that we

[00:40] continued to run is a simple formula.

[00:43] That's three parts to it.

[00:44] All right, the first part is duration.

[00:46] All right, because virtually every fitness-based

[00:50] promotion that you're going to run is going to be

[00:52] X amount of weeks, X amount of days, whatever.

[00:55] Right, so it's like 21 day, 42 day, six week, 28 day,

[01:00] 30 day, one month, whatever that is, that's the first piece

[01:05] of your headline.

[01:06] Okay?

[01:07] Second piece of the headline, and this is what I see people mess up,

[01:10] is the kind of the benefit or the result.

[01:14] Okay?

[01:14] So it'd be like six week, six pack, if it was for guys, right?

[01:18] 28 day bikini, six week, booty, 42 day detox.

[01:25] Like shit, I'm trying to think, I mean, if you want to even get

[01:30] a little bit more creative with it, you could say like,

[01:32] 20 day skinny friend, right?

[01:34] So now you're like, then the copy is going to real that in and talk

[01:38] about how, is it wouldn't be nice to always be the skinny friend,

[01:41] right?

[01:41] Because now you're talking about status within the context of

[01:44] other people.

[01:44] So you're looking at the prospect within the eyes or from the perspective of

[01:48] their friend, right?

[01:49] And so you have duration first, okay, in the headline,

[01:53] and the second piece of headline is going to be the benefit.

[01:55] All right, it could be leaning down, slim down, thin waste, you know,

[02:01] small dress, like that's where like the, a lot of really popular one was,

[02:05] a little black dress, right?

[02:06] Because that was the result, that was the benefit, right?

[02:09] And so like, like loosen about loop, like two notches down on the

[02:12] belly.

[02:12] So try and demonstrate what the result is going to be with the second piece.

[02:16] And that's where just being creative as a marketer comes in, right?

[02:19] So duration is simple, make sure you have a duration first,

[02:22] because that's where people want to see what kind of commitment

[02:24] or imply when they're going to achieve the results, right?

[02:28] So it's like if you have a 28 day drop to your belt, or drop to your belt notches,

[02:32] like cool, I get it, drop to your belt notches in 28 days, cool.

[02:35] But you're not thinking of your T, that's just the title of the advertisement, okay?

[02:40] The third piece to this is a power word, all right?

[02:44] And so a power word could be challenged, it could be blueprint, it could be

[02:48] accelerator, it could be intensive, it could be, um, of course,

[02:53] I'll black while in life.

[02:54] But it's words like that, that like program, you don't

[02:58] mean transformation, all of those are going to be like the, the period,

[03:02] the end of the sentence.

[03:04] And so when you're making your ads, this is the headline that would go in the banner,

[03:08] all right?

[03:09] This is the headline that goes in the banner.

[03:11] Once you've done that, like if your ad doesn't have that,

[03:14] but likely that it's going to convert as much lower, period, it's just like,

[03:17] these are, and what's interesting is that you like that sound so basic,

[03:21] I see, yeah, it's all on time, Jim owners, even in our community that don't obey this,

[03:24] and then they're surprised that they're not getting results.

[03:26] Like, I made a video a couple of days ago about like, it's like the news.

[03:30] Like, if you look at the way the headlines look on the news, they're still the same.

[03:34] And they all they do is they just change the characters.

[03:36] And your job is the reporters to go and grab the story and capture it, right?

[03:40] So, um, duration, 28 day, benefit, you know, six, not six,

[03:48] duration, 28 day, benefit, six pack or, uh, you know, skinny waist or smaller gene size or whatever, right?

[03:58] And then blueprint, challenge, transformation, whatever it is, is the third word, all right?

[04:04] And so that is how you go one, two, three, and that is your formula for headlines.

[04:08] Now, once you have that, the next piece is going to be the creative.

[04:13] I'm not going to get into the creative too much because I've made other videos about that.

[04:16] But using the Legion's scrambler for whatever you want to put in your video or your image is going

[04:20] to work well, right? So that's going to be a group work out, uh, a pitch of you explaining what it is

[04:26] going to be, um, any images of people sweating together in the group together, testimonials work,

[04:32] all of that stuff is creative and you can still use the same headline.

[04:36] All right, the headline doesn't have to be specific to the creative.

[04:38] So that's one of the biggest things that I've learned as a marketers that you don't need,

[04:41] that those two don't actually need to be connected, okay?

[04:43] Now, until you were a dozen to be connected in a second.

[04:46] The next piece that you're going to have to this is when you actually go to the copy,

[04:49] so I'm only specifically talking about Facebook ads if you're working on like GDN or other things

[04:53] and like those are banners and you have to have more steps to it. But if you're just talking about Facebook,

[04:58] then what you're looking at then is the first line of the copy is going to be calling it who you want

[05:03] and who you don't want, right? Like residents that are in this area, right? That's what you're

[05:08] like, there's obviously a compliance guidelines that make you sure that you can't say you,

[05:12] you can't say like, um, you ladies because you can't identify the prospects

[05:16] because Facebook doesn't like that, right? It's going to do your best to describe it without calling out,

[05:21] the person individually who's reading, okay? So it's who we're looking for and if not more importantly,

[05:27] who we are not looking for, okay? And that can be the first two lines and then you have your subhead,

[05:32] right? Which is going to be tied back to the headline that we said. So it's like, if we said the

[05:38] 28-day skinny friends, you know, transformation, right? If skinny friend

[05:42] accelerators, that's a problem, doesn't matter, right? You go there, it's like, wouldn't it be nice to

[05:47] be the skinny friend for once? We all have those friends, right? And that's the lead,

[05:50] that's the lead into the ass. Like we all have those friends, it seems like the guinea

[05:54] whatever they want and they never gain weight. Wouldn't it be nice to know that it's not

[05:57] their genetic, it's actually their habits and those habits are programmable and teachable?

[06:02] Right? Now, my, oh, this is an interesting ad. I want to read more. It's like, and over the last

[06:06] years, implied authority, like we've done this with over a thousand people in this local area alone,

[06:11] and right now we're opening our work spot in our 28-day blah blah, accelerator. And so if you

[06:16] want to be the skinny friend, then click over, right? It's an end called action. And so like this is

[06:23] a formula, like hopefully just from the way I'm describing this, you can understand how this works.

[06:27] So when you're making ads and this is what a lot of people are making ads is on Sundays, right?

[06:32] And you're making the ads start with the headlines for the actual banner on the ad itself.

[06:37] All right? Duration, benefits, slash results, power word. Then you have your creative that's going

[06:43] to plug in. That's really there just to get attention and make sure that they're like these

[06:47] pauses stop. All right? A fun side note is make sure that the color makes sense. Colors and fonts

[06:53] matter sometimes even more than the words. So if you're doing a mean banner or banner on the ad,

[06:58] you want to make sure that you're not doing black and yellow or black and red for women, right?

[07:04] Women are going to be like that. It looks hardcore, right? Same thing. You don't like stencils

[07:08] spray lettering, which is like kind of like hardcore GI Joe lettering for women, right? It's not

[07:13] going to work as well. It has a different feel. All right? To the same extent, if you're doing a

[07:18] guys based ad, they're doing black and green, black and blue, like sort of male based colors,

[07:23] it's going to work fun. You should have made sure that you're matching those two to the

[07:26] process that you're trying to attract. All right? And the next thing is like I said is the fun,

[07:30] right? Some fonts work either way. Like permanent marker is a font on Google fonts,

[07:35] works for guys or girls, right? So you can have white and pink in-part in-in-permanent marker

[07:40] font where you can have black and yellow or black and red or blue and black, whatever it is, right?

[07:45] Obviously you can be in the middle and just do blue and white or blue and white or green and white

[07:49] or black stencils or whatever. All that stuff's fine, right? But make sure that you're matching that.

[07:54] And these are definitely like the fundamentals, like these are the basics, but if you're not

[07:58] doing these and you'd be surprised how many people don't be the fundamentals, like the advanced

[08:03] people just never don't do them. And that's all it is. Okay? So we're wrong back to the end. So we've got

[08:07] our headline. It's in the right font that matches the prospect and it's in the right colors. Cool.

[08:12] We can have our creative which we know converts which is in people working out together. Food pictures,

[08:17] images of like sweaty selfies, eye-based images where someone's staring at the camera,

[08:25] selfie-pitch videos, all of those stuff of videos work, right? For creative. Then you have your

[08:32] who you're calling out to to make sure that you both attract the right people, but word away the

[08:37] ones you don't. The who it's not for is just as if not more powerful than who it is for.

[08:44] All right, because it shows that you're selective and you're going to be more magnetic

[08:47] and repulsive when you make that, right? Like if you notice recently a lot of the gym launch

[08:51] intensive come out and it's been like no personal trainers. Like we only want gym owners who have

[08:57] over 25 clients or full-time have a side lease and XYZ in the reason for that is because we just

[09:01] did a data analysis on the clients that make them most money with us and stayed longest and guess

[09:06] what? It's fucking gym owners, right? And so we're just making sure that we're 100% clear that

[09:12] that's the solution we work with. Now you if you want to look at your own clients and find out

[09:16] which clients are actually worth the most to you and then put it in your copy, word off the people

[09:20] who are good and the people who do read that are like wow that's really me, right? Then they're

[09:26] going to be way more likely to click and then the quality of the clips that you get is going to be

[09:29] much higher. All right, and the next thing finally is the subhead is the lead in, right? And that's usually

[09:36] going to be tied to the benefits slash result, the middle word of your headline, right? And so if you

[09:42] did the 20 day lose two notches, whatever transformation, right? And this is where you have a little

[09:50] image of jeans and a belt or something on the banner, right? It would make sense. And then when

[09:54] you're with the lead in it's going to tie it back to that because it's like how is this connected?

[09:58] And so you're going to connect that to like hey have you ever have you ever have you've noticed recently

[10:03] that you keep going up in notches every six months or so? Well good news is it's not permanent

[10:09] and we know how to fix it, right? And then you're like boom then you can go to your normal copy. Okay?

[10:13] So if you were making your ads, make sure to use those headlines, make sure that the banners are set

[10:19] that way. Three pieces, duration, benefits slash results and then power word, make sure that the

[10:25] images slash copy are attention grabbing usually like the lead gen Scrambler, let's just use that.

[10:31] And then when you are doing the copy on the top, make sure you're attracting and replacing the right

[10:37] people and then do your lead in your sub headline or what would be your sub headline because you don't

[10:42] want that actually the actual banner is too many words. But you want that subhead because if they read

[10:46] that then they're going to want to find out more and they find out more then it's going to time to

[10:50] what they just read and it's going to be relevant. All right? Once they click from there to the page,

[10:56] you want it to be congruent. All right? So if you're having a 28 day blah blah blah blah and this is

[11:01] where it's like this is where it takes work. This is where like good marketers, the mediocre marketers

[11:06] just by not being lazy. And so then they make sure the page matches the offer and the benefits and

[11:11] the results that we're talking about on the ad because people clicked exactly what they want.

[11:15] All right? And so that's what we're doing here. But you can have two funnels that are running

[11:20] for the same campaign, just once for men and once for women, that's a basic split. Right? If you want

[11:24] to get more granular, you can have older women and younger women. I would imagine that you probably

[11:28] talk to a 55-year-old woman to really talk to a 25-year-old girl, right? Of course you will. Right?

[11:33] The messaging changes, the way that the page probably looks different, et cetera. And so that's where

[11:37] you become a better marketer. So anyways, I hope that just gives you just like a quick overview in

[11:42] terms of gloss if you're making your aesthetics that some day, which is what a lot of our gym

[11:45] wonders. Do you make their ads follow those guidelines, you'll get more clicks, you'll get more

[11:50] leads. And if you found this valuable tax and many

[11:53] drop a like or comment. If you're listening on the podcast, please leave a little of you.

[11:56] All right, keep being awesome, we want to love. I'll catch you guys soon. All right, back.

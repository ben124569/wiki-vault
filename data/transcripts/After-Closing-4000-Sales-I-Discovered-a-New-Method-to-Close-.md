[00:00] I have a hundred salespeople across our portfolio that does over $250 million here.

[00:03] In this video, I'm going to teach you one sales skill that separates the best from the

[00:06] rest.

[00:07] And it's so powerful I've never caught it before.

[00:10] And so I'm going to cover the three A framework of reframing, which is the skill I'm

[00:13] going to teach you.

[00:14] And the five rules for using it ethically.

[00:16] So what's reframing?

[00:18] Reframing is the one to three sentences that you say after a prospect says anything but yes

[00:23] that increases the likelihood that whatever your next thing you say gets them to buy.

[00:27] So here's how a refram might sound.

[00:29] Someone might say, hey, how many certifications do your trainers have?

[00:33] Now this is a trap question because it's basically a blind question where whatever you say

[00:39] in response, the prospect gets to be the judge of whether or not they accept that and then

[00:43] they choose to buy or not.

[00:44] And you don't know what the right answer is.

[00:46] And so rather than answer the question, you ask a question about the question.

[00:51] And so you'd say something like, well, which certifications are you looking for specifically?

[00:56] The next version of this might be someone says, how many questions I'm going to be able

[01:00] to ask via email in support?

[01:02] Now whatever number you give, they might say, oh, that's not enough or that's too many

[01:06] or whatever it is.

[01:07] And then they say, no, for that reason I don't want to buy.

[01:09] So instead you might say, well, why do you want to ask additional questions?

[01:14] How many questions you want to ask?

[01:15] Is there a purpose that you're trying to solve with this?

[01:17] Like, what do you most afraid of?

[01:18] See, that was two or three questions in a row that can reframe without answering the question

[01:23] they gave me.

[01:24] One of the biggest lessons that I teach in sales is the person asking the questions is

[01:28] the one who's in control.

[01:30] And so you've ever seen that Hollywood movies where they're like, I'm the one asking the

[01:33] questions here.

[01:34] It's because the person who asked the questions is the one who's in control of the conversation.

[01:37] As soon as they start asking the questions, you're on defense, which is not where you want

[01:41] to be.

[01:42] And the reframing process I'm about to show you has sold things as low as a hundred

[01:45] bucks all the way up to $1 million plus service packages.

[01:47] And it sold them in person on the phone via zoom from stage wherever which way you can

[01:52] imagine.

[01:53] This works.

[01:54] And I'm going to give you the three ace framework and five rules for using it because

[01:57] this is unbelievably powerful and in use the right way.

[02:00] It helps lots of people make a decision.

[02:02] Use the wrong way.

[02:03] You become a very bad person.

[02:04] Give a bad reputation for sales.

[02:06] So the reason I started thinking about this was I was writing and reviewing our closing

[02:11] manual for our closers.

[02:14] And I had this little piece right before all the closets is, hey, by the way, make sure that

[02:17] you reframe the question before you enter into the close.

[02:21] The great thing is I realized as I was walking to the sales for the other day, I heard

[02:25] someone just immediately fire back and opt to overcome.

[02:28] And it seemed very combative.

[02:29] And I was like, oh, they're not, they're not getting the reframing part.

[02:32] And I realized that that little reframe, little bubble, was one of, if not, the most important

[02:38] part of handling sales.

[02:41] And so if you think about what the most productive sales people do, the people who close

[02:44] the highest percentage of sales, what do they do?

[02:47] They ask for the sale more times than anyone else.

[02:50] Now here's the problem with that.

[02:51] Is that if you ask more times than anyone else, the wrong way, you'll get prospects

[02:54] to hate you.

[02:55] And if prospects hate you, they won't buy from you.

[02:57] And so the idea is, we want to be able to ask for the sales many times as it's impossible,

[03:01] which means the way that we ask for the sale or how we frame our ask should not decrease

[03:08] rapport with the customer.

[03:10] And so the idea is we want to continue to maintain rapport the entire time so that we can

[03:15] then ask as many times as we darn well please.

[03:17] So here's the 3a framework that I teach.

[03:20] The first day is acknowledge.

[03:23] All right.

[03:24] This is where you build rapport with the prospect version one.

[03:28] All right.

[03:29] And the way that we do that is by saying what they said back to us.

[03:33] Now there's a couple benefits from this.

[03:35] One is when you say back to them, they think that you're actively listing, which, of course,

[03:38] you should.

[03:39] But the other part of it is that it buys you time to think about what you're going to

[03:42] say next.

[03:43] And so it gives you a little bit of space to process before you give your overcome or

[03:47] your handling of whatever their objection is.

[03:49] The second piece and this is part of why this seems more natural with the most professional

[03:54] guys is that you, this is the, this is the really sexy part.

[03:59] You associate.

[04:00] All right.

[04:01] Now there's three associations that I'm going to show you how to do.

[04:03] But what you do is you associate the question they asked with the type of behavior that

[04:08] someone who gets the best results from your product or service would ask.

[04:13] And so basically when they feel like they're taking a step away from buying, you say,

[04:16] that's an amazing question.

[04:18] That's actually a question that a lot of the best customers we have ask.

[04:21] And so actually you just say, nope, that means that you're more likely to buy.

[04:25] The third thing is that after you have made the association, you've, you've acknowledged

[04:29] what they said, you've made the association, then you ask your next question after you've

[04:33] properly reframed what you're going to say next.

[04:35] So let's dive into this.

[04:37] So like a lawyer in an interrogation, they never ask questions.

[04:41] They don't already know the answers to.

[04:43] And you as a salesperson want to only ask questions that you know the answers to.

[04:46] And if you are ever going to answer questions, you want to know that you have the right

[04:50] answer before you respond.

[04:52] And so when we do the acknowledgement, let's walk through the example I earlier.

[04:56] So they say, well, we'll kind of certifications to your trainer staff.

[05:00] And I say, so you're curious about what our certifications are.

[05:04] It's a great question.

[05:05] It's actually shows that you're a really rational person and you're making a serious

[05:09] decision here, which is amazing.

[05:11] So what I did was boom, we restated it.

[05:14] Boom, we made our association.

[05:16] And then I would ask, you can call it an attack.

[05:21] It sounds a little bit more aggressive than it is.

[05:23] But you basically attack the frame of the question.

[05:25] You say, hey, which certifications are really looking for specifically.

[05:28] And the thing is, as most people have never been asked a question about their question,

[05:31] they usually ask questions because they feel like they're supposed to to make it in form

[05:35] decision.

[05:36] But most of the time, they don't even know what they're asking.

[05:37] And so they're like, I don't know.

[05:39] It's like, well, let me tell you what we do have.

[05:41] Now if the person's like, do they have NASA minace certifications?

[05:45] Now if I don't have that for my trainer specifically, I would then say, why those certifications

[05:50] specifically?

[05:51] Right?

[05:52] And then they would say, well, I heard that they're good.

[05:54] It's like, well, those are amazing certifications.

[05:56] I agree with them, I'm not disagreeing.

[05:58] And then I would say, well, we have a couple other ones.

[06:00] And I'll tell you why we chose these rather than those.

[06:03] And now I can answer it without failing.

[06:05] Right?

[06:06] Now if I just said, our guys don't have that, or they have this, I might have lost the

[06:10] sale right there.

[06:12] And so the thing is, is it disapplies to basically any question that someone asks.

[06:15] It can even be like, you know, I need to think about it.

[06:18] It'd be like, awesome.

[06:19] What you're saying concerned, right?

[06:20] Like, immediately, I'm not letting them out on that.

[06:23] Or like, hey, what are the main variables using to make the decision?

[06:26] Or what would make this enough?

[06:28] These are all questions.

[06:29] What are you most afraid of having to happen?

[06:31] Right?

[06:32] If I'm deeper in the sale, obviously that wouldn't be my first one.

[06:33] I would say what you're saying could certainly then we'd sort the question from

[06:35] there.

[06:36] Many times people ask you questions in the sale that you don't need to answer.

[06:42] You just ask more questions about their question.

[06:45] And as long as you're the one asking questions, you're the one who's in control.

[06:48] Which leads me to rule number one of the AAA.

[06:52] So here's a little psychology for you.

[06:55] As counter-intuitive as this seems, a prospect believes almost nothing about what you say

[06:59] in almost everything that they say.

[07:01] And so the goal is not to tell them they're a good fit.

[07:04] The goal is to ask them questions that they then say, I think I'm a good fit for this.

[07:08] Or yeah, that makes sense.

[07:10] That's how you can get them.

[07:12] You bread from them to the logical solution, which is that they should buy your thing.

[07:16] And by the way, if you like some of this more advanced sale stuff, we go through this stuff

[07:20] in-depth at racquisitor.com scaling workshop.

[07:23] So my sales director, he personally meets with all the companies that show up and helps them

[07:28] deconstrain their sales, whether it's scripting issue, whether it's nurturing issues, whether

[07:30] it's compensation issues, is stuff that we understand really well.

[07:33] And so if you are a business owner, you are looking to scale.

[07:36] Check them out, acquisition.com, hit the scale button, and my team will be in touch.

[07:39] So a lot of beginner sales people think that they should one, and this is the worst question

[07:43] ever asking sales, is do you have any questions?

[07:46] It's literally asking them to have objections and asking them to take the wheel of the conversation.

[07:50] You're literally saying here, take control of this because I don't know what I'm doing.

[07:53] So please don't do that.

[07:54] Train that out of your team.

[07:55] The second thing is that as soon as you start answering questions, again, they're the

[07:59] judge jury and executioner of whether or not your answers are good.

[08:02] And if your sales people are not as knowledgeable as you or your technicians, which is often

[08:08] true in any kind of service business, the people delivering you're not necessarily the same

[08:11] or as knowledgeable as the people were selling it, is that they basically set themselves up for

[08:15] failure.

[08:16] Now, I'll give you a quick overview for this if someone gets a little bit like, hey, why aren't

[08:18] you answering my questions?

[08:19] You say, listen, it would be like you asked him the secretary about how your heart surgery

[08:24] is going to be with the surgeon.

[08:25] You're going to want to talk to the surgeon.

[08:26] And I'll give you a different one.

[08:27] I call this the mechanic version, which is, hey, you're asking me what's wrong with your

[08:30] car and it would be unethical for me to answer it without looking under the hood first.

[08:34] And so we can give you much better answers on the inside and once we started working with

[08:37] your business or with your whatever, right with your body.

[08:40] It doesn't really matter, right?

[08:41] But you can use that analogy to kind of get around it.

[08:43] And then I say this and this seals it.

[08:45] And if anyone, this how I said, and if anyone does give you an answer on the first call without

[08:50] already having looked under the hood after already giving you a physical or doing the

[08:53] assessment, run the other way, because it means they're just trying to tell you whatever

[08:56] they can to get you to buy.

[08:58] And now I have the ethical high ground and they can't ask any more questions about that.

[09:03] Rule number two, no one can disagree with a question.

[09:06] I tell my team be like smoke.

[09:09] And so you can't catch smoke because all you're doing is you're basically always side shifting

[09:14] in terms of whatever they say you're like, oh, let me ask you a question about that.

[09:16] Ooh, can you be more specific?

[09:17] Hey, what are the variables you're thinking about?

[09:19] And that way, you're always engaging with them and they're the ones doing the talking

[09:24] and then you get to decide whether their answers are good or not.

[09:27] Whether or not they're a good fit for the program.

[09:30] Now we're not going to tell them that that they're a good fit for the program.

[09:32] We have them make that decision.

[09:34] But in terms of judge jury executioner, you want that to be you.

[09:37] Here's why Rule number two is so important.

[09:39] You can never disagree with a prospect.

[09:41] Now you may, you know, actually disagree with them, but you don't want to voice disagree

[09:45] with the prospect because you never win a sale by winning an argument.

[09:49] Anyone who's engaged in an argument, both people lose.

[09:51] And more importantly for you as a salesperson, you lose the sale.

[09:54] And so the objective is actually to never disagree with the prospect and the point is to get

[09:58] them to change their minds.

[10:00] And we can only do that in an agreeable way.

[10:02] People don't change their minds on an abad mood or they feel insulted.

[10:05] And so we do that by asking them questions.

[10:07] Now there are ways to ask questions that seem insulting and that's what AAA helps solve.

[10:11] And we're going to dive more on that as we go through this.

[10:14] But it also means that we can ask questions about their questions, which is something

[10:17] that a lot of beginner salespeople don't know.

[10:19] They then assume they know what this person is asking about.

[10:23] And so they have this really big question and then they try and come up with the quote

[10:26] right answer and they fail every time.

[10:28] And by the way, this is just the ultra mega hack.

[10:30] Is that if you don't know how to answer the question, you can always ask more questions

[10:34] about their question.

[10:35] So let me show you how this sounds in reality.

[10:37] So someone says, I need to think about it.

[10:40] We say totally understand what are the main things you're considering, what are the variables

[10:44] that you're considering in your decision.

[10:46] What's your main concern?

[10:47] What are you most afraid of?

[10:49] Having happened.

[10:51] What would make this a no?

[10:52] And one of my favorite questions, by the way, is, well, then what would it take for you

[10:55] to say yes?

[10:58] Now, let's say someone says, I don't have time.

[11:01] Timing is off right now for me.

[11:03] You say great, totally understand, acknowledge.

[11:06] Time is kind of tough for you right now.

[11:07] I think it's smart that you're already thinking about implementation.

[11:11] Our biggest success stories are actually people who think through the process the same

[11:14] way you are right now.

[11:15] So what would make it a good time?

[11:17] And so as you work through this, this, these two give you the space, make the positive

[11:23] association.

[11:24] They take a step back.

[11:25] You say, I feel you, I totally understand.

[11:27] Now they're back to neutral.

[11:28] And then you associate with the thing that's closer to the sale.

[11:31] And then you move the conversation forward the ask.

[11:33] So let's do another one.

[11:34] Someone says, I need to talk to my spouse.

[11:36] You say totally understand.

[11:38] I think it's really sensible that you'd want to talk to your spouse and super fair.

[11:41] Just so I understand, out of curiosity, what parts do you think?

[11:44] Now I'm here.

[11:45] What parts do you think they wouldn't like?

[11:47] What parts do you think they would disagree with?

[11:49] And so we've now moved from, I have to talk to my partner to now we're back in the

[11:53] sale, talking about the specific things.

[11:55] And once we get the prospect to name those things, then we can attack those.

[11:59] We're still in the sale.

[12:00] So let's say someone says, I hate this particular feature.

[12:02] You say, totally get it.

[12:04] I hate them all too.

[12:05] Just kidding.

[12:06] Let me just ask you a real question.

[12:08] Why not?

[12:09] And then we can get, we're back into it.

[12:10] All of these things as people will make statements as though they are deal enders.

[12:16] And beginners will take a statement like that and think, oh, I guess they're not going

[12:19] to buy.

[12:20] And that couldn't be further for the mature.

[12:22] You just continue to ask questions about why they don't like something.

[12:24] And by continuing to ask questions about their questions, you can stay in it and keep

[12:30] asking, because that's the best closers make the most asks.

[12:33] Which leads me to rule number three, which is tell them what their question means.

[12:37] So this is a zoom in on associate.

[12:40] If you're a salesperson with least two years of experience and you're enjoying this stuff,

[12:44] this is just the surface of this stuff that we train our teams on.

[12:48] And if you'd like to work at acquisition.com or one of our portfolio companies, we are always

[12:53] looking for exceptional salespeople.

[12:54] We have a lot of rules up and right now in sales.

[12:57] And so you can go to acquisition.com for its slash careers and hit the business consultant

[13:01] button.

[13:02] That'll take you to the application for that.

[13:05] If you're good, just apply.

[13:06] We're willing to be flexible on payments based on experience and whatnot, but just put in the

[13:10] application.

[13:11] The first time I had this used on me, I was actually getting pitched investment or private

[13:17] wealth management from somebody.

[13:19] And I wanted to just get out of the conversation as fast as I could because I was like,

[13:23] I already have a wealth advisor like I'm good.

[13:25] And the guy just said, oh, that's amazing.

[13:27] 90% of the clients we had this shift over already have a wealth advisor.

[13:30] So it means you already know how a lot of these things work, which means you'll be up the

[13:32] learning curve.

[13:33] And I was like, what just happened?

[13:35] I was like, I thought I was getting out of this.

[13:37] And now I'm more like the customers that that ultimately buy.

[13:40] And I ended up not buying from that particular guy, but I did think, wow, that was such

[13:46] a powerful reframe, how can I use that in all of my selling?

[13:51] And so the prospect has not had this conversation as many times as you.

[13:57] You should never be caught off guard with the questions or the statements that they're

[14:00] going to make.

[14:01] Remember, you've had a thousand of these conversations.

[14:03] The fact that somebody could surprise you is ridiculous.

[14:06] You have to practice.

[14:07] This is why we train.

[14:08] And so a prospect is trying to just throw up bombs or smoke screens to get out of the

[14:13] sale.

[14:14] And again, to be clear, what I believe is bad selling is one of two key things.

[14:18] Is one, is you sell an unqualified prospect, which basically means that you're lying to

[14:22] them that they're going to get a good result or that they somehow are qualified when

[14:25] they're really not.

[14:26] Which really underpins the main thing of sales, in my opinion, which we have across really

[14:31] all of our communication stuff in the company, which is state the facts and tell the truth.

[14:35] If you state the facts and tell the truth, and this person is qualified, then you have

[14:38] the ethical obligation to ask as many times as you can possibly possible and get them to

[14:41] pull their head out of their ass so that they can see the world clearly instead of

[14:44] it being dark and full of shit, which is it's up their ass.

[14:46] And help them make a decision to help themselves.

[14:48] That's the point.

[14:49] Now, if you get weird about resistance, then you don't understand the job of sales.

[14:57] The best sales people are comfortable when other people feel like there's conflict.

[15:02] All right.

[15:03] And so they're able to always de-escalate, which is why be like smoke is so key.

[15:06] It's a dance, not a fight.

[15:08] It's seduction, not rape.

[15:09] All right.

[15:10] The idea is that we want to always have consent from the person.

[15:13] We always want them to want to be there.

[15:15] And people like you when you ask questions about them.

[15:18] People like you when you compliment them and you say, hey, that's a really smart question.

[15:22] Hey, that makes you just like the people who have the best success stories.

[15:25] And I'll show you a little bit more about some more associations in the next role.

[15:28] Which leads me to rule number four.

[15:30] Use straw men for tough truths.

[15:32] So we've all been in a sale where someone just says something ridiculous, where you can clearly

[15:36] see that there are beliefs around the world or so flawed, that you have to have kind of a

[15:40] pop-a-pop talk.

[15:41] Right.

[15:42] Now, there's different ways of entering this.

[15:43] Some people say, hey, can I put my coach hat on instead of my friend hat?

[15:46] So, the thing is, is that in all of these reframes, you're basically getting permission

[15:50] from the person to give them a harsh truth.

[15:53] Now, if you're a younger guy, and let's say you sell B to B, much tougher to do.

[15:58] So if you're a 22 year old sales guy and you're talking to a 45 year old, you know,

[16:01] $10 million dollar your plumber, he probably doesn't give a shit about you trying to put your

[16:05] coach hat on.

[16:06] He just thinks you're a child and he doesn't care at all.

[16:08] To the same degree, if you say, hey, well, can I share something that really worked

[16:11] well for me, again, the same degree that puts you above him and he's not going to like that.

[16:15] And so I use three different strategies of straw men and straw men in argumentation

[16:20] is basically like basically put it.

[16:21] I use the word foil normally, but people don't know what that means.

[16:24] So basically it's like you basically put up this caricature of someone who's just like them

[16:29] that you can then have the tough conversation with without insulting the prospect.

[16:33] So I'll give you three different ways that we do this.

[16:35] So the first way is when you make the association, so this is us going deep on associate

[16:40] here.

[16:41] Okay?

[16:42] So this is where someone says whatever it is, totally understand that you're coming from that

[16:45] direction, I would ask those questions too.

[16:48] Now we make the association.

[16:49] So one of three.

[16:50] So number one, you can say it's so funny you asked that because I had someone just

[16:55] earlier today who asked the same questions, can I share with you what I just shared with

[16:58] them?

[16:59] Now the thing is is that because I'm now talking about a conversation I had with someone

[17:03] else, I can now be brutal as fuck to this other person, but I'm not saying it to the prospect

[17:09] and so it's not insulting.

[17:10] The second way that you can do this is that you do it in reference and I said it earlier,

[17:16] two a successful past customer, that's so great.

[17:18] Like, totally understand, you know what, that actually makes you just like Sarah who had

[17:22] a similar plumbing business and actually crushed it with our marketing agency.

[17:28] And so now we've made the association and she asked this question too, boom.

[17:32] And then we handle the objection.

[17:34] All right?

[17:35] And so these straw men are particularly important when you are going to answer a question.

[17:40] So everything up to this point has been basically side stepping, being like smoke, but

[17:44] sometimes you will have to make the answer.

[17:46] And so if we do need to give them an explanation or kind of break their belief when they're

[17:50] saying, I don't have time, you're like, oh, it's not really a timing thing.

[17:52] It's priorities question.

[17:53] But if you say that to somebody and you don't have as much rapport, you're going to lose

[17:56] the sale.

[17:57] Right?

[17:58] Like that is the logical thing.

[17:59] Everybody has the same amount of time every day.

[18:00] It's really just a question priorities.

[18:02] But if you say that at the wrong time, they're going to be like screw you.

[18:05] Right?

[18:06] And so by doing the straw man or putting the foil up or the caricature that you can then attack

[18:09] or talk to in front of this prospect, it creates a third party that's neutral.

[18:13] So the third way of using the associate is that you can appeal to authority.

[18:19] So if you're in a business where the CEO is identified or the CEO is seen as a as a

[18:26] as a respectable person or an expert in the field, so it either can be fame or can be

[18:30] influencer, it can be expertise.

[18:31] It doesn't really matter which one.

[18:32] But as long as they have some level of expertise, instead of appealing to your own authority,

[18:40] you appeal to theirs, which is it's so funny that you ask that Alex just told me

[18:43] this thing earlier today, can I share it with you?

[18:45] Right?

[18:46] And so then the person appeals to someone else's authority and then shares it.

[18:49] They're the messenger.

[18:51] They're not saying, I'm not saying this.

[18:53] He said it and I'm just sharing it with you.

[18:55] These sound like tiny side steps, but this type of AAA reframing is what separates

[19:00] beginners from pros.

[19:02] And when you do it this way, people actually like to be sold by you because they feel

[19:06] like they're being heard.

[19:07] You make associations that are saying, hey, that's smart.

[19:09] He that's reasonable.

[19:10] Totally understand what you'd say that.

[19:12] These are all things like that's a rational decision.

[19:14] Hey, I think that's a fair point.

[19:15] Those are all things that someone wants to hear.

[19:17] They're like, hey, he's listening.

[19:18] He thinks I'm intelligent or I'm rational or he's not discarding my decision.

[19:23] Everybody wants to be validated.

[19:25] Right?

[19:26] So it's the same thing as the angry boat, but just in a sales conversation.

[19:28] So in the angry boat for customer success or customer service, if someone's upset,

[19:33] you don't disagree with them and say, hey, it wasn't that big of a deal.

[19:36] Sorry, we were five minutes late.

[19:37] It never works because you're disagreeing with them.

[19:39] You're invalidating the reason that they're angry.

[19:41] So you have to get more angry.

[19:43] You have to go above.

[19:44] And that's where you say, hey, that's a totally reasonable concern.

[19:46] Rather than saying that's a stupid question.

[19:48] Right?

[19:49] You might feel that way, but you don't say that.

[19:51] And the reason I realized this, especially with the association one,

[19:55] is I heard my sales guys and they were, they were having a tougher time

[20:01] using some of the closest.

[20:02] And I was like, they're like, yeah, you know,

[20:03] someone's a little tough, they're a little harsh.

[20:07] And I was like, no, no, it's, and when I realized that I was like,

[20:09] oh, it's because they're not prefacing it with this.

[20:12] If you prefest with this, you can say almost anything.

[20:14] And this allows you to cut to the heart of the matter way

[20:17] faster instead of dancing around it,

[20:18] because you don't want to hurt someone's feelings.

[20:19] Which leads me to rule number five, which is retain child-like

[20:23] curiosity at all times.

[20:26] So one of my favorite ways of training this concept

[20:28] is actually training a physical thing that you do with your body,

[20:32] even if you're on a sales call, they can't see you.

[20:33] Because your tone will change based on how you're standing.

[20:36] If you're smiling or not, your voice will come out different,

[20:39] which by the way, I encourage you to have a mirror

[20:41] if you're on the phone next to you in your sales booth.

[20:43] And if you do zoom, obviously, you can see your own little image there.

[20:46] But I like to have people say, huh?

[20:49] And you say, just like that.

[20:50] And huh also buys you two or three seconds

[20:52] before you say your next thing.

[20:53] Say, huh, that's so interesting.

[20:56] You'd ask that question.

[20:57] Can I ask you a little bit more about that?

[20:59] Like, if someone says something really nasty to you, right?

[21:03] But if you retain that way, the goal is to seek to understand

[21:07] not win.

[21:08] And the way that I try to keep this, and if you're a sales guy,

[21:10] I'd put a little sticky note above your camera or wherever you look

[21:13] while you're selling, which is keep the human number one.

[21:16] And so this is a really powerful frame that I actually

[21:18] learned from Layla for having hard conversations on the team,

[21:21] but it actually applies to sales, which is, if you genuinely

[21:24] believe that the product you have is going to help this person.

[21:27] And this is a qualified prospect that you're talking to.

[21:30] Then you want to understand their concerns

[21:35] so that you can help them get over them, because you know

[21:37] this is the right decision for them.

[21:39] And so this is a frame that I like to think about.

[21:41] So let's say you could travel back in time,

[21:43] but you're in a different body, and you see your old self.

[21:46] And you know what the future's going to be.

[21:50] And you might say, OK, I have to convince this person

[21:53] to buy a video 10 years ago.

[21:55] And so, or I have to buy Apple stock, or I have to buy Bitcoin.

[21:58] Whatever it is, I don't really care.

[21:59] The thing is, as you know that this thing's

[22:00] going to go through the roof.

[22:01] But the person you're talking to doesn't know you from Adam.

[22:05] Think about how you talk to that person.

[22:07] Now remember, they don't know who you are.

[22:09] Even though you know you, you would have absolute empathy

[22:12] for your old self.

[22:13] I'm going to be like, listen, I totally understand.

[22:14] This seems totally crazy.

[22:15] But let me walk you through what I think is going to happen.

[22:20] Let me, like, what do your main concerns?

[22:22] What are you most afraid of?

[22:23] What would it take for you to say yes?

[22:24] What would it take for us to take the next step together?

[22:27] It allows you to make sure that you're focusing on the prospect

[22:31] rather than the product.

[22:32] And so you don't close sales by being right.

[22:35] You close sales by making the prospect right.

[22:37] And so the big understanding here is that you want to understand them,

[22:42] not beat them.

[22:44] Because as soon as it feels combative, you've already lost the sale.

[22:47] If they feel like you want an argument logically,

[22:49] you've lost the sale.

[22:50] The point is to make money not to be right.

[22:53] And so we want them to feel good about the logical decision

[22:55] that we're helping to make.

[22:56] And if anything, you want to be a faceless hero

[22:59] in their journey.

[23:00] Like, hey, I'm just, I'm just the guy here.

[23:02] I'm just, I'm going to just share the information

[23:04] that I think will help you make a good decision.

[23:06] That's a great question.

[23:07] Can I provide a little bit of context on that?

[23:08] Just from someone that had this experience earlier today?

[23:11] Right?

[23:11] All of these things are things that will allow you

[23:13] to give those hard truths to close the deal.

[23:16] The reason the association is so important

[23:18] is that it gives the prospect of label to then live up to.

[23:21] And so this is a 201 version of selling.

[23:25] But if you say, hey, you seem like really honest person

[23:28] or hey, that's a really smart decision

[23:29] or hey, that's a really smart question.

[23:31] If I then clear up, give them that label.

[23:34] When I get closer to the close, I might bring that back up

[23:36] and then associate smart people by this thing.

[23:39] Where, hey, that's, you must be a good family man, right?

[23:41] Because you had some spouse objection.

[23:42] Fine.

[23:43] It seems like your family man, family is really important to you.

[23:45] I think that's awesome, it's super admirable.

[23:47] Now, when I get to the end of the sale,

[23:49] I can bring up the fact that this is a family man.

[23:51] And because he's a family man, he should buy.

[23:54] And so it allows me to pair whatever their obstacles were

[23:57] with things that I'm going to bring up in the close.

[23:59] Pro tip, my universal response for almost anything.

[24:03] So I walk through the sales floor

[24:05] and one of the guys was on the phone.

[24:06] And I was like, you should come.

[24:08] And I just walked through the room.

[24:09] And then the guy was like, ah, and so my sales guy

[24:11] was like, so you're coming.

[24:12] And I was like, yeah, and it was super weak, right?

[24:15] He was obviously not sold yet.

[24:17] So I actually was like, give me the phone.

[24:18] And so I hopped on the phone and I said, dude, what are you

[24:20] afraid of?

[24:22] And so when you ask, what are you most afraid of,

[24:25] it gets you to the heart of the issue as fast as possible.

[24:28] And if it's the first objection, I would want to ask,

[24:30] what's your main concern, what's your main issue,

[24:32] what are the variables using make the decision?

[24:34] That's like kind of understanding.

[24:35] So you can triage.

[24:36] But when I'm further along in the sale,

[24:37] I'll usually ask, hey, what are you afraid of, man?

[24:40] Like, what are you afraid of having happened?

[24:42] And if someone's like, I just need more time.

[24:44] Then you say totally understand, what would make it a no?

[24:47] And so by doing that, it still keeps you in the sale

[24:50] because at the end of the day, like,

[24:52] you want to make a good decision on the source of your information.

[24:54] So the best possible decision we can make is here.

[24:57] But again, you can only say something like that

[24:59] if you ever pour in the sale

[25:00] and you continue to demonstrate that throughout.

[25:02] If I said something like that and I didn't have a pour,

[25:04] they'd be like, no, fuck you.

[25:05] So it's not going to work.

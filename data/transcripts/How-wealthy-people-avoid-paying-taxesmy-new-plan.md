[00:00] In this video, I'm going to explain to you how you can get paid for your business.

[00:04] Tax free without giving up any equity.

[00:08] So hi, if you're new to the channel, my name is Oximozi.

[00:10] I own acquisition.com.

[00:11] I'm going to portfolio of companies that is about $8,000 a year.

[00:14] I just made the channel because a lot of people are broke and I do not want you to be one

[00:17] of them, so walk on a Mosian Nation.

[00:18] So today the topic is going to be talking about debt.

[00:21] And this is going to be one of the more interesting chastos we've had because this is something

[00:26] that I have spent a lot of time learning about.

[00:30] And probably not in the traditional sense of personal finance, but more so in the kind of

[00:34] mergers and acquisition sense of how debt is used.

[00:37] And so one of the first things that I had to understand as a business owner is understanding

[00:42] why we want to sell a business.

[00:43] So a lot of people want to exit their business because it seems like this big aspirational

[00:47] goal.

[00:48] And as somebody who is now exited six different businesses, I can tell you it's not nearly

[00:52] easy to get to the extent of the fact that they are not going to be able to go to

[00:57] the market.

[00:58] And so the reality is that you have got transition documents.

[01:00] Not all of that cash is up front.

[01:02] Most of the time you are going to have an earnance and you have got cash.

[01:05] Once you have cash, you have bonuses, distributions, you have a financing cost that are

[01:09] associated with the transaction costs.

[01:11] And then finally you have your chunk of money.

[01:12] But wait, there is another 20% that is going to go to Uncle Sam and then you are left

[01:15] with X.

[01:16] Sometimes X is very different from the enterprise value of what you have sold out.

[01:20] And so one of the things that I can tell you about the wealthiest people that I know

[01:23] who are all over 10 figures is that the wealthiest people in the world they buy and they

[01:28] build.

[01:29] And most times they don't sell.

[01:30] Even the usas entrepreneurs we have this dream of it is usually because you are trying

[01:32] to get out of some sort of pain, right?

[01:35] Because I have realized this that the times that I want to sell is when I am in the most

[01:38] pain.

[01:39] The times when I don't want to sell is when I everything is going well.

[01:42] And so what I should be doing is figuring out how to get out of pain rather than trying to,

[01:46] it is I think there is a Chinese saying to kill a mosquito with a cannon, right?

[01:50] Which is like it is overkill.

[01:51] It is like hey why don't we just solve the problem by hiring the one or two people who need

[01:55] to hire rather than sell the entire business, right?

[01:57] And so one of the things I want to introduce today along that concept is how can you still

[02:02] get paid or do you risk?

[02:04] Because for most business owners or entrepreneurs the majority of your networks is in your

[02:07] business, right?

[02:08] And so if the majority of your networks is in this thing, the highest asset class I would

[02:14] like to ideally share some of that risk other people.

[02:18] And so there are multiple different depth functions you can use, but I think the easiest

[02:22] analogy for this is a house, okay?

[02:24] Or an apartment building, doesn't really matter.

[02:25] So let's imagine you have a house.

[02:26] And let's imagine that you started this, except this house, you were able to build without

[02:31] land and you were able to build it just using your own money and you actually built it yourself.

[02:36] All right?

[02:37] So you paid money out of pocket, month over month or month, and you slowly started assembling

[02:41] this house, piece by piece by piece, right?

[02:44] And then you started getting tenants inside of it, right?

[02:46] You got little tenants in here and you know, for us those are our customers, but it functions

[02:51] more or less the same way.

[02:52] If you got these people that you've been slowly filling it up, and so now all of a sudden

[02:55] this thing, but it's out cash for every month, just like a rental apartment unit might.

[03:00] The similarity here, and I'm using this analogy because it was the one that made the

[03:03] most sense to me, is that everything up to this point, you own 100% in cash, all right?

[03:09] This is equity that you have in this house.

[03:11] Now in a normal home or you were a real estate investor, you would say, hey, I would like

[03:15] to get higher returns because I can get all 80% of this, finance their bank, right?

[03:21] You can get a loan in the form of debt.

[03:23] And so the example here is let's say you've got a $1 million business, you've got a $1

[03:27] million business, right, which will still use this house, right?

[03:31] If this business over the next five years goes to $2 million a year, right, or $2 million

[03:37] in value, excuse me, then you would have two extra, your network.

[03:41] Right?

[03:42] Because you own 100% of this thing.

[03:45] Now what if you were able to have your $1 million thing and then split it into you keep

[03:52] 20% in the business, right?

[03:54] And then you get a check for $800,000.

[03:58] Now realistically, I'll tell you with the more realistic outcome of something like this might

[04:02] be.

[04:03] And there are two ways to do this.

[04:05] But let's say that you did 30% and then 70%.

[04:09] And so then this would be 300k.

[04:13] And this would be 700k.

[04:16] So that's what we would get.

[04:18] So this would be 70%.

[04:19] And this would be a loan.

[04:21] Now here's what's cool.

[04:22] Because this is a loan against your building, this is not income, which means you guessed

[04:28] it, it's tax-free.

[04:31] So remember before I'd talk to you earlier, if you were to sell a business, you probably

[04:35] have to keep a certain percentage in because no one's going to, you know, just most

[04:38] people are not going to want you to have a full exit, especially if you're a small

[04:40] business.

[04:41] And so you would have this 80%, but then this 80% would then get next in cutness, not

[04:45] going to be all cash anyways.

[04:46] But even if it were all cash, you then have to pay 20% of that amount, which would

[04:52] be 16% off from whatever that number is, which, you know, from math, segeless, you get

[04:57] 760k, but you have to take the 20 out.

[04:59] So you have 560k after taxes and with you holding your 20.

[05:04] So this is what you get.

[05:05] But here's what's crazy.

[05:06] Is that through debt, you can get a $700,000 loan and still own the darn thing.

[05:12] But here's what's cooler.

[05:13] You now have your $1 million business that's growing to $2 million, for example.

[05:18] But then you have this $700,000 that you have a loan from off of this, that you can

[05:23] also still try and grow, you know, let's say $2 million in that same time period.

[05:28] And now you own the Delta, which overall your net net worth is now 3.3 million versus

[05:33] the original 2 million you had before.

[05:36] And so there are two ways that there's a lot of ways that you can take on a debt in the

[05:40] company, you can do minority, you can do majority, you can do dividend recap, there's

[05:43] more things than I can get into.

[05:45] But fundamentally, just understanding that from an exit perspective, this changed the way

[05:49] I saw business is that if you don't want to sell, because you want to keep your thing

[05:52] forever, totally fine.

[05:54] But as you're keeping it, it's just like an apartment building, you can still refine

[05:58] it at regular intervals as the value of the property or as your business grows so that

[06:06] you can then, excuse me, take this money out, de-risk yourself and put it in other assets.

[06:12] Because let's be real, we have all been through crazy last couple years, anything could

[06:16] happen.

[06:17] And so for you to de-risk a little bit, I think for many is a beneficial thing.

[06:22] And candidly, it's also how every CEO of a publicly traded company lives, is they

[06:26] know they never sell that equity, or some of them.

[06:28] But majority of the time, they're not selling that equity, they're living off of loans that

[06:32] are asset-baths.

[06:33] They loan against the equity that they have.

[06:36] And the stocks grow tax-free, because they compound.

[06:41] And then the loans are locked in, which you can then refinance them later, because now

[06:45] the asset is worth more.

[06:47] And so you basically just gain that money for truly for you don't even have to pay it back.

[06:51] Or even if there was the same price overall, you actually still got a discount because

[06:55] you didn't have to pay income tax on the loans you took against your assets.

[06:59] And so I wanted to explain this because in my mind, I didn't know a way to have any kind

[07:05] of derisking event for myself without selling the business.

[07:10] I just didn't know if there was another way.

[07:12] And so I'm making this, like I make everything in this channel, is because a lot of people

[07:16] are broken, I know what you're going to do.

[07:17] I've learned a fair amount in the transaction that we've done and grow in the companies

[07:22] that we have.

[07:23] And I just want to share those lessons to you guys.

[07:24] So hopefully enjoy this.

[07:25] Hopefully this is a friendship to perspective in terms of how you see the equity growth

[07:29] in your business, how you ultimately can grow your network faster in a lower risk environment

[07:34] that way.

[07:35] And I'll tell you one more thing.

[07:36] I was talking to a private equity managing partner.

[07:39] And he was saying how for some of our companies, for example, he was like, you guys don't even

[07:43] have, you have negative leverage.

[07:45] He said, you have cash in your balance sheet.

[07:46] He said, it's ridiculous.

[07:47] He said, you should be taking loans against that equity so that you can redeploy it and

[07:52] do x, y, and so.

[07:54] It was just a very interesting perspective.

[07:56] I thought I would share it with you.

[07:57] It's something that we look to continue to do in our businesses and I figured I would share

[08:02] it with you because I love you guys and keeping on.

[08:04] So enjoy this video and enjoy the next video and I'll see you soon.

[08:07] Bye.

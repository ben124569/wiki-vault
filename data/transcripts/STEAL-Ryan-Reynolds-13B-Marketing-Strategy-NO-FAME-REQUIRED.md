[00:00] Ryan Reynolds's a guarder with two million customers

[00:02] for mint mobile with paid ads.

[00:04] And I'm gonna break down the best paid ads

[00:05] that he's run and how you can model the structure

[00:08] for whatever it is that you sell in your marketing.

[00:10] I'm Alex Morose on the founder of Acresers.com.

[00:12] We spend millions of dollars every month on ads

[00:13] we make tons of money and no one cares.

[00:15] Let's start with the first ad.

[00:17] At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite

[00:19] of what big wireless does.

[00:21] They charge you a lot, we charge you a little.

[00:24] They put their names on our reeness,

[00:26] we put ours on my lower back.

[00:28] So naturally, when they announce

[00:30] that they be raising their prices due to inflation,

[00:32] we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.

[00:36] And if this were one of their ads,

[00:38] they'd end it here with a happy customer.

[00:41] So we'll end out with an angry go.

[00:43] Oh, oh, oh, oh, I get an angry go.

[00:47] Okay, so let's break this down frame by frame.

[00:49] Now notice though that this is a 30 second ad.

[00:51] Let's start with the beginning of the ad.

[00:53] At Mint Mobile, we like to do the opposite

[00:55] of what big wireless does.

[00:57] Pause.

[00:58] So right here, the hook is basically a contrary in hook.

[01:01] So there's a little bit of curiosity here

[01:03] because you're like, okay, well, one,

[01:04] you recognize Ryan Reynolds right off the bat.

[01:06] Andy's got brand placement behind him.

[01:07] So he's making the association between him,

[01:09] the thing you like, and the thing you might not know,

[01:11] which is Mint Mobile.

[01:12] And so that's a 101 strategy.

[01:14] And there's a reason that I wear this hat

[01:16] and why underneath of my shirt,

[01:17] which normally is unbuttoned for those of you who are you

[01:19] wild fellows.

[01:20] The reason I rep my brand is to make that same association.

[01:23] If there's stuff that you use for my content

[01:25] and it makes you money, then hopefully you associate

[01:27] that value with me and acquisition.com.

[01:29] All right, so here, this is a contrary in hook

[01:32] and the curiosity is, okay, well, what's opposite

[01:35] about this thing versus what I, my current carrier?

[01:37] All right, let's hit it.

[01:38] They charge you a lot.

[01:40] We charge you a little.

[01:41] Okay, pause.

[01:42] So this is a clear set up for us versus them strategy.

[01:45] All right, and so this strategy is best employed

[01:48] when you are not the market leader.

[01:50] All right, so obviously Mint Mobile's kind of the underdog,

[01:52] they're going the small guy, they're trying to face the life.

[01:55] Obviously they're not even close to his biggest horizon

[01:57] and AT&T.

[01:58] So this strategy makes sense.

[02:01] If you're number one, you don't want to do us versus them.

[02:03] If anything, if you want to use us versus them structure,

[02:05] you would use us versus the alternative.

[02:08] So rather than another brand or other companies,

[02:10] you would be like us versus your couch.

[02:13] If you were like the top fitness brand or something like that.

[02:15] They put their names on our reeners.

[02:17] We put ours on my lower back.

[02:19] So pause.

[02:20] So here, obviously he's weaving in humor

[02:22] because that's part of his personal brand.

[02:23] And so he's basically weaving in his kind of like his brand

[02:26] and the sub bull that's as he's going through.

[02:27] Now, every ad has three parts to it.

[02:30] You're going to have the hook, which we cover right at the beginning.

[02:32] There's the meat of the ad, which is typically going to be the value.

[02:35] And then at the end of the ad,

[02:37] there's usually going to be either some sort of call to action or a payoff.

[02:39] But let's keep going.

[02:40] So naturally, when they announce that they be raising their prices

[02:43] due to inflation, we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you.

[02:47] All right, so here the value is, so think about

[02:50] when you're thinking about value creation in an ad,

[02:53] there's at the most basic level, more good stuff, less bad stuff.

[02:59] And so when you're writing your ads or you're writing your copy,

[03:01] you're scripting them out, I think first from those two buckets.

[03:04] And so if we pull out our handy-dandy text book for advertising

[03:08] and you go to 134, so this is the leads book.

[03:11] So the steps for running pay debts.

[03:13] So first, you have to know where to advertise.

[03:15] He's advertising everywhere because everyone

[03:16] already knows who he is and everyone already has self-owned.

[03:18] And so his market is everyone.

[03:20] Now, that part's straightforward.

[03:22] The second part is like, OK, how to get the right people to see it.

[03:25] That's via targeting.

[03:26] So I'm sure there's different audiences that look better.

[03:28] And it might be for discount providers rather than people who are maybe

[03:31] at premium.

[03:31] They might have found, for example, that switching someone

[03:34] for Verizon might be more difficult than switching someone

[03:37] from maybe pay on the pay as you go type phone,

[03:40] especially given the price points.

[03:41] Now, the third part, which is right here, step three,

[03:44] what should my ad say?

[03:45] And so this mirrors that three step cross to get your call out,

[03:47] which is the hook, the value, which is the meat,

[03:49] and then you got to call it action, which is the end.

[03:51] Besides the general points that I start that are more common hooks,

[03:56] obviously there's not exhaustive.

[03:57] You can have unlimited types of hooks that can fit in the book.

[03:59] But in terms of concepts, he's using contrast here.

[04:02] Contrast in two ways.

[04:03] One is that there's contrast visually.

[04:05] This is a bright color.

[04:05] This is something that's going to pop out.

[04:07] But then also he's using contrast us versus them.

[04:09] That's kind of the theme here.

[04:10] Now, from a value perspective, we get into the interest step.

[04:15] And so the interest step is the best ads make benefits look

[04:18] as big as possible and the cost look as small as possible.

[04:21] And so from the benefits and cost perspective, what we're basically doing

[04:25] is a reverse value equation.

[04:28] And so the good stuff is what's the outcome they want,

[04:30] which should be phone coverage, right?

[04:32] People would want it fast, they would want easy,

[04:35] and they would want it to be likely.

[04:36] Okay.

[04:37] Now, the negative side is going to be,

[04:39] what is a nightmare scenario, the worst case scenario,

[04:42] slow, hard, and risky.

[04:45] And so as he's describing the benefit here,

[04:49] which is less bad stuff, the nightmare scenarios

[04:51] that you pay a lot, right?

[04:53] And you get basically the same thing.

[04:54] And if this were one of their ads, they'd

[04:56] ended here with a happy customer.

[04:59] And pause.

[04:59] And so before this he said, and we do this,

[05:02] due to not hating you.

[05:03] And so again, he's talking about the nightmare scenario.

[05:06] They charge you more and they don't like you.

[05:08] And so he's saying, we charge you less,

[05:10] and we do like you by implication.

[05:12] And then he adds in more humor.

[05:13] So let's see it.

[05:14] So we'll end out with an angry guy.

[05:16] Oh, boom.

[05:17] Get an angry guy.

[05:18] Pause.

[05:19] So obviously, puts a little bit more humor in.

[05:21] And to be clear, he doesn't actually

[05:23] show an angry customer.

[05:24] He shows a sheep, right?

[05:26] And so it wasn't actually like showing a negative view,

[05:28] which other companies like liquid death,

[05:31] which is a water company, which took the market

[05:33] by storm with cans of water that looked like beer,

[05:37] they actually had ads that were one star reviews of their product

[05:40] because they kind of went again, contrast that

[05:41] contouring angle.

[05:43] Now here, we finished with what, the CTA, right?

[05:45] So they make the offer, and they tell people,

[05:47] itmobile.com, and what do I get unlimited?

[05:50] Now, speed, just relative to the cost, low.

[05:54] Done.

[05:55] Fundamentally sound ad, and obviously brought lots and lots

[05:58] and lots and lots of customers.

[05:59] So if we're thinking about this ad in three slices, right?

[06:02] We've got our hook.

[06:04] We've got our meat or value.

[06:06] And we've got our CTA.

[06:08] And so we covered the hook, we covered the CTA.

[06:10] Let's talk about the meat.

[06:11] And so here, we've got more good stuff or less bad stuff.

[06:14] Now on the good stuff, what we're thinking through here

[06:18] is how can we get faster, so we want to describe speed

[06:20] if we can, how can we get easier, and how can we get risk-free?

[06:27] Now, if we wanted to improve this offer, it would be month to month,

[06:31] not just monthly.

[06:32] Now, there's some disclosures at the bottom.

[06:34] What does it say there?

[06:35] Limited time only offer, new activation, and upfront payment

[06:39] for three months.

[06:40] There we go.

[06:41] Promotion right for first three months only.

[06:42] Again, so now we get to understand, oh,

[06:44] it's only $15 a month, four, three months,

[06:46] and then it will go to who knows, maybe go to 30.

[06:49] We'll find out.

[06:50] Taxes and fees are extra, so there is more on top that.

[06:52] And what are these fees that they haven't disclosed?

[06:54] In unlimited customers using 35 gigabytes per month,

[06:57] we'll experience lower speeds.

[06:58] Okay, so they do slow you down.

[07:00] And video streams at 480p, seafoodtermsatmimilhu.com.

[07:04] And so that is the fine print on this.

[07:06] But big picture though, if we wanted to make this more compelling,

[07:09] we would actually flip those things.

[07:11] We would say, okay, we're dream outcome

[07:13] is to have unlimited fast internet,

[07:18] and you're not gonna worry about getting overcharge

[07:21] or getting your rates turned down

[07:22] in terms of the speed that you're getting download.

[07:24] That would make this offer significantly more compelling.

[07:26] Now, the thing that a lot of people don't do

[07:28] in their advertising is they don't cover

[07:30] what I call the don't, which is like, what's the negative side?

[07:33] So here, less negative is the,

[07:36] what are all the things that suck?

[07:38] So paying money sucks, which would be,

[07:41] in the opposite of this is slow, hard,

[07:45] and risky, right?

[07:48] Now, in this ad, obviously, they don't really have that offer,

[07:50] because a lot of the things they have are,

[07:52] they will slow you down.

[07:54] They probably made signing up easy,

[07:56] they might not make canceling easy.

[07:58] And then the risk is that, obviously,

[07:59] you don't get what you want.

[08:00] Now, on top of this, this is the real don't,

[08:03] this is the 201 version of ads,

[08:06] is that we say, okay, well, plus minus,

[08:08] so more bad stuff, and less good stuff, right?

[08:12] That happens in your life.

[08:12] These are still the same categories.

[08:14] But when we sell against the don't,

[08:16] we say, well, you could also not do this,

[08:19] and instead, you say, you will have more delays

[08:23] by not buying mint mobile.

[08:25] It'll be harder for you to use your phone stuff,

[08:28] and it will be riskier for you to do it.

[08:30] That's more bad stuff.

[08:33] And also, you'll experience less good stuff, right?

[08:36] And so each of these,

[08:37] so you can think about these as mirror images

[08:39] of both sides, if you do it with us,

[08:41] then you're gonna have less slowness, less hardness,

[08:44] less risk, which means that it's risk-free,

[08:46] it's easy, and it's fast.

[08:47] These just give you different ways

[08:49] of more or less saying the same thing.

[08:51] And on the alternative side,

[08:53] when we're marketing against someone

[08:54] or something or some idea or some competitor,

[08:56] then we're saying basically the converse of that.

[08:58] So let's break down the next ad.

[09:00] Wireless, but 20 bucks a month pause.

[09:03] So what's interesting about this is they began

[09:06] not really with a hook, but they began with the offer.

[09:08] And so me right off the bat, I'm not like,

[09:10] oh, now I'm paying attention.

[09:11] I would be like, all right, there's an offer here.

[09:14] Fine, all right, continue.

[09:17] That's not right.

[09:18] Pause.

[09:18] So the good part that they have here,

[09:20] I do think that they have a reaction,

[09:22] which I think is overall, like a good thing.

[09:25] I wonder if I were to split test this,

[09:27] I would probably lock off the offer and start

[09:29] at the reaction, and then flip the order

[09:32] so that then you see the offer,

[09:34] just said that there's something interesting there.

[09:36] Now here they have a mascot,

[09:38] which shows up in the next frame.

[09:39] I think what the intention here was to take

[09:41] Ryan Reynolds face away from stuff

[09:44] and transition it more to a mascot.

[09:46] But my guess here is that his goodwill

[09:48] and his posthed brand is probably

[09:50] which drives a great deal of the advertising return above par.

[09:55] Because many people might not know

[09:57] him at mobile if it weren't for Ryan Reynolds.

[09:59] They might not even know that this is the same company

[10:01] as his.

[10:01] All right, keep up.

[10:02] He's chunky style milk.

[10:03] Because that is the wholesome chunks of growing kids need.

[10:06] Pause.

[10:06] So right here, they're actually doing,

[10:11] is a pretty clever advertising tactic.

[10:13] Whether or not it was effective,

[10:14] is, you know, predetermined by the fact

[10:16] that they didn't have as many sales as they wanted.

[10:17] So I'm giving you a little bit of a foreshadowing here.

[10:19] But what they did is they actually just drew

[10:21] an analogy between their service,

[10:23] sorry, other people's service and chunky milk.

[10:26] So this is another contrast style ad.

[10:28] They're saying, we are a Ferrari.

[10:31] They are a clunker, right?

[10:33] They're a Vespas or whatever.

[10:34] Some small scooters, something that's a huge contrast

[10:37] that basically paints an analogy and someone's head

[10:39] to say, we are good, they are bad, and we keep going.

[10:42] The way that branding works is that you don't actually

[10:45] brand in the negative.

[10:46] I can't say, hey, don't think about pink elephants

[10:49] and me.

[10:49] Well, of course, you're going to think about pink elephants.

[10:51] And now I forever have associated for those of you.

[10:53] We see this with a pink elephant.

[10:54] And I will just cry myself to sleep every night

[10:56] because of it.

[10:57] But the point here is that they said,

[10:58] we don't want smoothy.

[10:59] We want chunky milk.

[11:00] And we started the video starts with the actual brand itself.

[11:06] And then subsequently follows with chunky milk

[11:08] and almost the entire ad is talking about chunky milk

[11:10] and that it's disgusting, right?

[11:13] And so people now just simply associate

[11:14] in the mobile, disgusting thing.

[11:16] All right, let's keep going.

[11:18] Unlike smooth style milk.

[11:22] Hey guys, that's facing chunks for me.

[11:25] Pause.

[11:26] So now they complete the loop and say,

[11:27] that that's not right, kind of like your wireless bill,

[11:30] which is a, a similarly, if you want to use,

[11:32] kind of like sort of is basically drawing

[11:35] and a clove in between two things,

[11:35] which by the way is one of the key ways

[11:37] of educating and advertising.

[11:38] With that, we still have this character

[11:40] that no one really knows, which is this random minty fox.

[11:43] But he now, I think, did he have glasses in me?

[11:45] I don't know.

[11:46] Let's keep going.

[11:47] Come on, come on.

[11:48] That's not right.

[11:49] All right, stop.

[11:50] So they hit the three here, right?

[11:52] It's easy.

[11:53] It's online, which to me would be, it's fast.

[11:56] Like it's not something that you have to talk to anybody.

[11:57] That's taking away some of the pain associated.

[12:00] Now, they don't really hit risk-free,

[12:02] but I guess they kind of lower the risk

[12:04] again with the small price here.

[12:06] And you have clear call to action,

[12:07] which is the end of the ad, let's hit it.

[12:08] Right now, by one month, and get two months free,

[12:11] at mintmobile.com.

[12:12] Right.

[12:13] And so they have their offer, and obviously the call to action

[12:14] is just simply go to the website.

[12:16] All right.

[12:16] So I think the mistakes in the ad are that they bid,

[12:19] they, that branding works, whether you like it or not,

[12:21] associations occur.

[12:22] And so they branded themselves with chunky milk,

[12:24] and they took out their biggest star,

[12:28] which was Ryan Reynolds.

[12:28] And so unsurprisingly, the ad didn't perform as well.

[12:33] All right, let's go to a good one.

[12:34] Hey, it's Ryan Reynolds.

[12:36] Honour of mintmobile.

[12:37] Pause.

[12:37] All right, so what we're, what we're, what we're doing here

[12:39] is he's, because what we have to think about

[12:42] when you're advertising here,

[12:43] because I don't actually think this is an effective hook

[12:45] from a hook perspective,

[12:46] but because this is fundamentally not going to strangers,

[12:50] this is going to people who already know who Ryan Reynolds is.

[12:53] And so the equivalent to that would be,

[12:55] if I'm in a local area, and I run an ad,

[12:57] and I say, hey, Towson locals,

[13:00] which is suburb in Baltimore, which we're in Brom.

[13:03] Then people are gonna be like, oh, this is for me.

[13:06] I recognize something, one of the four elements

[13:09] of getting influenced with someone

[13:10] is likeness or related to that.

[13:12] You're like, oh, I know this guy.

[13:13] All right, so let's do the next one.

[13:15] It's the holidays and the big wireless companies

[13:17] are busy spending billions on advertising.

[13:20] All right, pause.

[13:20] So yet again, he continues to hit on this us versus them

[13:25] concept, and obviously it's working.

[13:27] So when you do have something that works,

[13:29] keep doing it.

[13:30] And so he's drawing this parallel between us

[13:32] and them yet again.

[13:32] All right, keep going.

[13:33] Edmont, we're not into wasting money.

[13:36] So we bought this spiffy stock footage for $500.

[13:40] All right, pause.

[13:40] So he delivers one core brand message here,

[13:44] which is that we're not into wasting money.

[13:46] Now they're a budget option.

[13:47] And so it makes sense for this that this

[13:49] said it's significantly better one.

[13:50] They have their main person, too.

[13:52] He's the focal point.

[13:53] Three, the scripting itself.

[13:55] It's like, oh, you know who I am.

[13:56] And I'm not like these guys.

[13:58] My value is cheapness.

[14:00] And so we made this ad cheaply because we value money.

[14:03] That's kind of like I would say the implication of the ad.

[14:05] Let's keep going.

[14:06] Our footage also came with another hand,

[14:08] so we can let you know.

[14:09] So he obviously we've sent humor to then transition to the offer.

[14:13] And so these ads are super short ads.

[14:15] But when you haven't added this short,

[14:17] and it's going to audiences who know who you are,

[14:21] you pretty much just make an offer.

[14:23] And so from an advertising perspective,

[14:25] you can't just force it something called the levels of awareness.

[14:28] And so the levels of awareness kind of are like this

[14:30] reverse pyramid.

[14:31] And so you have unaware at the top.

[14:34] And this is about the problem.

[14:36] So unaware, you have a problem aware.

[14:41] So they know that they have a problem.

[14:44] You have solution aware.

[14:48] You have product aware.

[14:50] And then you have most aware.

[14:53] When you make your hooks for ads,

[14:55] you actually make your hooks depending on what part of this funnel

[14:59] you're actually finding people.

[15:01] And so the code of the traffic,

[15:03] the more different the ad will be.

[15:06] Now when you have an unaware ad,

[15:08] if you've ever seen something that's like,

[15:09] Texas homeowners are getting reimbursement checks for up to XYZ

[15:14] in this area or something,

[15:16] that's going to drive curiosity.

[15:18] And so curiosity is usually that very top of funnel

[15:21] for people who have no idea what this thing could be about.

[15:23] And so it has nothing to do with what the solution.

[15:25] If you've seen like five weird foods

[15:26] that help you lose stomach fat,

[15:28] it doesn't say whether they're going to sell you a detox tea,

[15:30] they're going to sell you a ozempic,

[15:32] they're going to sell you a gym membership.

[15:33] It starts all the way to top with curiosity.

[15:35] Now, here's the massive advantage that branded ads,

[15:40] people who are already recognized.

[15:41] This is what the rock, this is what Ryan Reynolds has.

[15:43] It's at it.

[15:44] Every business can do this.

[15:45] Every influencer business you see who has 50,000 followers

[15:48] and then begins to run ads, for example,

[15:50] you still use the same exact strategy

[15:52] that Ryan Reynolds is doing.

[15:53] The thing is it's just that his warm audience is like everyone,

[15:57] whereas your audience might be like a million people.

[15:59] And so what he's running actually is an ad

[16:02] that's targeted at most aware.

[16:04] And so when you're targeting most aware consumers,

[16:06] you actually just make an offer.

[16:08] That's it.

[16:10] And so that's fundamentally what this ad does.

[16:12] He just draws a contrast and says, by the way,

[16:14] we're cheap and you can buy three months free

[16:16] and get three months free.

[16:17] That's it.

[16:18] That's the whole app.

[16:19] So in my next book that is coming out,

[16:21] I talk about this particular offer structure,

[16:23] which is a Bix get Y.

[16:25] And so he's got a parallel structure by three get three.

[16:29] I would say that I found that by one get two,

[16:32] or by three get six, if you can contrast that you get more

[16:35] free than you pay for, it will simply convert better

[16:38] than a mirror structure.

[16:39] So I would test by one get two versus three and three

[16:44] because you would probably end up getting,

[16:47] you would save money as a business

[16:49] and you might end up still converting more

[16:50] because the discrepancy would be in what people pay

[16:52] and what they get is higher.

[16:53] He switched to mint, you'll get three months free

[16:55] on all of our plans, even unlimited.

[16:57] Feels like that deserves an exclamation point.

[17:00] Whoa.

[17:01] Easy.

[17:02] Easy.

[17:04] So he's just explaining the offer here.

[17:06] And I mean, if I wrote this ad,

[17:08] I'd probably have the CTA.

[17:10] This is yet another joke that he weaved in.

[17:12] You could say that this is on brand for him.

[17:14] So one of the nice things that I think Ryan Reynolds does

[17:16] for his own personal brand is that he does weave in

[17:18] direct response advertising, which is what this is.

[17:20] With some people might consider branding.

[17:23] And so he does very much kind of brand himself in these ads

[17:25] because the ads are funny.

[17:26] And he kind of, like if you literally look at this ad,

[17:28] it pretty much alterates humor, moves the ad forward,

[17:31] humor, moves the ad forward,

[17:32] humor, moves the ad forward, and it's a pretty simple structure

[17:35] in terms of how he's making this.

[17:36] And so what we're doing here as we're looking through this

[17:38] in terms of tools is that one, obviously he's a celebrity.

[17:41] So we just looked at it as YouTube video

[17:42] and ranked the videos that had the highest views.

[17:45] But I can guarantee you virtually that the ads that are doing

[17:49] the best are the ones that are being pushed out every single day

[17:52] on meta on YouTube, et cetera, from ads not organic.

[17:55] Like sure he might get some sign of some of the six

[17:57] and a million views, but believe it or not,

[17:58] six and a half million views for an ad, not that much.

[18:00] Right now we're pulling up the Facebook ads campaign.

[18:02] So if you don't know how to do this by the way,

[18:04] you just go Facebook, Facebook, Ad's library.

[18:06] And then you sort and then you type in the account that you're looking at.

[18:09] And it's because Facebook is trying to be transparent.

[18:11] They show you every ad that is running for an account

[18:14] and sometimes also ads that are running in the past.

[18:16] Now the rule of thumb here in terms of looking for ads

[18:18] because you're like, well, how do I know it's worth working?

[18:20] Well, the easy way to do it is just say,

[18:22] which one of these ads has been running for a long time.

[18:24] And so the longer the ads been running,

[18:26] the more likely that that ad has worked well.

[18:28] And so let's say you put out 100 pieces of creative,

[18:30] anything that's new will always be better than something that's old.

[18:32] But if something is old for a while,

[18:34] that means even though it's old,

[18:35] it's still performing really, really well.

[18:38] So here's some of the oldest ads that they're running.

[18:40] So let's pull it up.

[18:49] Wow, this is boring.

[18:55] Okay, despite the fact that I think this ad

[18:59] fundamentally for a creative perspective kind of sucks,

[19:02] it's been running for five years or six years.

[19:04] So it's probably doing okay.

[19:06] Now I will bet that this is a retargeting campaign.

[19:09] And so this is probably converting very well

[19:11] for people who have already seen some of the top of funnel ads.

[19:14] And so basically, if you think about this,

[19:17] levels of awareness that I was just talking about,

[19:19] retargeting ads are always going to be targeting people

[19:21] who are bottom of the funnel here,

[19:23] which is why it makes sense to retarget simply with the offer.

[19:26] So it's like, hey, you saw one or two ads with three ads

[19:27] because we don't know what the audience selection for this ad is,

[19:30] but I would make a guess that retargeting ads

[19:33] because the audience that enters into the retargeting bucket,

[19:37] basically the new people that see the new ads

[19:40] and walk past a certain point or click to the site

[19:43] are a much smaller subset and change frequently.

[19:45] You actually can keep the creative the same

[19:47] because the bucket of eyeballs changes.

[19:49] Whereas when you're hitting a mass market on a regular basis,

[19:52] everyone's seeing the ads

[19:53] so you actually have to have far more creative

[19:55] top of funnel than you do bottom of funnel.

[19:57] So if we just look at this, this isn't offer recap, essentially.

[19:59] So it starts with the price,

[20:01] tells you what the dream outcome is.

[20:03] If we're looking at our original framework,

[20:05] we're reversing risk, right?

[20:07] So we're just hitting through the buckets of value.

[20:10] It's cheap, it's fast and it's guaranteed

[20:14] and this is a humor thing at the end there

[20:17] and then again, they'll restate the price.

[20:19] All right, so let's look further up the funnel

[20:21] because I think that'll be more fun.

[20:23] And so it seems like they have two very different categories of ads,

[20:27] which I think every business should do

[20:29] and if you're not doing this right now,

[20:31] like do it, I don't know, I don't like do it.

[20:34] But look at how native these ads are, right?

[20:37] These are clearly iPhone.

[20:39] These are clearly user-generated content, so UGC.

[20:44] And they're just displaying them as it.

[20:45] So they opted for a more basic look.

[20:49] And so some big brands would be like,

[20:51] I don't want to show this type of content

[20:53] because it doesn't reflect my brand well.

[20:55] Obviously they're going for the scrappy underdog,

[20:57] looking feel and the fact that they're a budget provider

[21:00] kind of makes sense that they would use this.

[21:02] Me, by and large, I tend to lean towards using UGC

[21:05] because it's like unlimited creative

[21:07] and you can just test it really easily.

[21:09] And I've talked about how creating UGC loops

[21:11] within a business can just give you endless ad creative,

[21:13] but let's actually watch this ad from beginning to end.

[21:15] It might answer you, it might also be a little bit.

[21:17] All right, stop.

[21:18] So honest reviews, if you look at search volume

[21:21] for any business, reviews is almost always the second

[21:24] or third thing that comes up.

[21:26] And so this is obviously something that people are going to want to know.

[21:28] It's so it makes a really strong hook.

[21:30] And then the believability factor here

[21:32] is I don't see any disclaimers on this ad.

[21:34] And so it appears that this is not a paid actor.

[21:36] This is actually just somebody who's a user,

[21:39] who's giving a review.

[21:40] And I'm going to bet, it's a good one.

[21:41] Let's go.

[21:42] And first off, I'm going to try to give my main crybook.

[21:45] All right, so I mean, he's already framing whatever

[21:47] he's about to say as he's actually

[21:49] edifying himself, believe it or not.

[21:51] As you should trust my opinion for what I'm about to tell you

[21:54] because I am the type of person who likes cheap stuff.

[21:57] All right.

[21:58] We call him to the BoGo King.

[21:59] Second, we're offering $15 a month.

[22:02] But the first three months for the new cost, pause.

[22:05] So they don't have disclaimers around who he is.

[22:10] But they do have disclaimers around the offer itself,

[22:12] which you can see at the bottom there.

[22:13] So it's $45 upfront.

[22:16] So he said $15 a month.

[22:17] But when you actually go to buy it,

[22:19] it will probably be more, which you can see there.

[22:21] All right.

[22:21] I paid for what if I got all those ones that I haven't looked at.

[22:24] There we go.

[22:24] So he does include the upper and feet.

[22:26] OK, that feels good.

[22:27] How did I find phone number three months?

[22:29] It's going to work.

[22:29] So from an offer structure here, he begins with $15.

[22:32] And then he says he paid $45 because he bought three months.

[22:35] So they, so from an advertising perspective,

[22:38] what they're doing is pulling cash flow forward.

[22:40] So they can afford to acquire the customer.

[22:41] And so if you pull the three months forward,

[22:44] then they're going to give six months,

[22:45] because it's a buy three get free.

[22:47] He said he's the BoGo King, buy one get one.

[22:49] So they buy three.

[22:50] So 15 times three, that's 45.

[22:52] And then there's another three months afterwards.

[22:54] So likely he's not going to get build for six months

[22:57] after paying $45, which is fairly compelling offer.

[22:59] All right, this service is hand-me-grade.

[23:02] It's wonderful.

[23:03] Call me, do you mean if you want to reach me

[23:04] or again, possible?

[23:06] So what is the biggest concern someone has?

[23:08] So there are these two pricing scientists

[23:11] called a Van Westrop or it's one guy.

[23:12] I think it's last news Van Westrop.

[23:13] Anyways, and so there are kind of four questions

[23:17] that you can ask when you're trying to figure out

[23:19] what to price something.

[23:20] So the four questions are, number one, what

[23:22] is a price that's so high that you would even consider buying it?

[23:25] The second question is the other extreme, which is,

[23:27] what is a price that's so cheap?

[23:28] You wouldn't believe that it would work.

[23:30] That it would actually function.

[23:31] And then the two questions in between are,

[23:33] what price is just high enough that you'd consider doing it?

[23:35] You'd ultimately buy it, but it would hurt or it would sting

[23:37] or it would be something you have to think about

[23:39] before making the purchase.

[23:40] And then on the kind of like, from the upside is like,

[23:43] what price do you think this would just be a great deal?

[23:46] And so what they're hitting on here

[23:48] is when the big fears that a budget consumer

[23:50] is going to have, which is, okay, it's $15 a month,

[23:53] but am I going to get service?

[23:55] Is anyone even going to hear me?

[23:56] Like, is I'm always going to have one bar at all times

[23:58] like that with suck, right?

[24:00] And so he's hitting on the biggest fear

[24:02] that a customer is going to have.

[24:02] So if you think about the value part of the ad,

[24:04] he's saying less negative and more positive.

[24:08] So you might be wondering, less negative?

[24:10] No, more positive.

[24:11] And so it's very simple structure.

[24:12] And you can also stack multiple of these in a row

[24:15] if you have a longer ad that you're trying to run.

[24:16] All right, let's hit the rest.

[24:17] It can be made to the supposed to the manual,

[24:19] it has the money and the rest.

[24:22] And so he actually makes the CT at the end, which is brilliant.

[24:26] I mean, it's very kind of him.

[24:27] Maybe they ran an ad contest for people

[24:29] to submit their ads.

[24:31] Maybe they didn't.

[24:32] And this guy just liked making fun videos.

[24:33] Who knows?

[24:34] Maybe he's a great creator.

[24:35] We have no idea.

[24:37] But buying large though, it's a fundamentally sound ad.

[24:40] This guy gave a good hook.

[24:41] He edified himself.

[24:42] He said what he loved about it, he gave the price.

[24:46] And then he said, what's your biggest fear?

[24:47] It's less bad stuff, more good stuff.

[24:49] Great benefit to you, save some money,

[24:51] invest, call to action.

[24:53] Straight forward ad.

[24:54] All right, so now let's go back to a run round.

[24:55] So you'll notice though, they have far more UGC ads

[24:58] that are running.

[24:59] And that's because UGC, you just get so much more creative

[25:01] because it's leveraged.

[25:03] You can use the entire community of people,

[25:04] all of your customers, which I think a meta-concepture

[25:07] that any business owner can take.

[25:08] I mean, I am a massive advocate of this

[25:11] is trying to build the advertising machine

[25:13] within the business itself.

[25:14] That way, you don't always have to generate

[25:16] 100% of your ads.

[25:18] You only have to generate 20% or 10% of your ads on a regular basis.

[25:20] And you let your community of customers generate the other 90.

[25:23] All right, let's hit the next run round.

[25:25] Hey, it's Ryan Reynolds.

[25:26] And this year, our holiday commercial,

[25:27] it's just stuff I think that that provides dollars

[25:29] for me, our sale.

[25:30] Oh, good.

[25:31] We still have the goodness.

[25:32] Doing what?

[25:34] Well, the holiday offer.

[25:35] All the way to the market,

[25:36] I'm going to be so happy to be here as a January.

[25:37] So I want to make sure that we know

[25:38] the sale of the new customers

[25:40] is just because the same for so far.

[25:41] It is future, me, micro managing, Amy.

[25:43] Just cut to be it, offer.

[25:46] It's zero commercial now.

[25:49] And sufferable.

[25:50] This is how you're using time travel.

[25:52] You irresponsible, son of a bitch.

[25:55] So let's break this down frame my frame in terms of the ad.

[25:58] So we go to the beginning, boom, he introduces himself.

[26:01] Hey, it's Ryan Reynolds.

[26:02] And so I will bet that they have found

[26:04] that when he introduces himself, that hook tends to work

[26:08] because everybody kind of knows who he is.

[26:10] And so in some ways, it's like, it's not a true direct response,

[26:15] cold market open because no one is really watching this

[26:20] and buying is cold traffic.

[26:21] Everyone kind of recognized his Ryan Reynolds is.

[26:23] And so they just reinforce that with all the brand trust

[26:26] that he brings to it, which is fundamentally

[26:27] why he did the deal to do this to invest in this business

[26:29] and help drive it.

[26:30] All right, let's do it.

[26:31] And this year, our holiday commercial,

[26:33] it's just stuff I picked up for $5 from the R sale.

[26:35] Oh, good.

[26:37] You still doing this.

[26:38] Pause.

[26:39] So the $5 from the R sale, he doesn't even show any of it.

[26:43] And it's just kind of this random ad in.

[26:46] And so this ad is primarily humor driven.

[26:48] The clone version is something that many, many companies

[26:51] have used this angle.

[26:53] And this is more of a behavior science thing.

[26:56] But seeing two people who are identical

[26:58] draws a lot of attention.

[27:00] Like think about twins of any kind.

[27:02] I'm not going to get into anything else there.

[27:03] We'll just leave it at that.

[27:04] All right, twins are inherently more interesting.

[27:06] Like you look back and forth, you look back and forth.

[27:08] And it's attention grabbing.

[27:10] Any people, now if they wanted to make this even crazier,

[27:12] this is the behavior side.

[27:14] If they actually had them acting in sync,

[27:17] it would draw even more attention just

[27:18] from an advertising perspective.

[27:20] But obviously, there's a little bit of banter here.

[27:22] Are let's do it.

[27:23] What?

[27:24] A little holiday offer.

[27:25] All the way around is probably soft.

[27:26] Doing theirs January.

[27:27] So I wanted to make sure that we have a soft

[27:29] loving our customers.

[27:30] So yet again, they have their winning theme, which is us versus them.

[27:34] And they hate their customers.

[27:36] And we love our customers.

[27:37] And so they're continuing to run the ad.

[27:39] Also, as a total side note,

[27:42] if the ad converted, which was assuming it did,

[27:44] they actually got a lot more runtime on it

[27:45] because of the excuse they're using for why

[27:48] they're going to continue to run this promotional offer.

[27:50] Now, they've been more or less running the same offer

[27:52] this whole time.

[27:53] And so inside of my offers book, I talk about this.

[27:57] So the last chapter in 100-million dollar offers

[27:59] is the Magic Headline Formula.

[28:01] And so once you figure out what your offer is going to be,

[28:04] you then basically bundle it over and over and over again.

[28:07] And so same bundle different wrapper.

[28:09] And so during the Super Bowl, I'm sure they'll call this

[28:12] their Super Bowl promotion.

[28:13] During the holidays, they'll call it the holiday promotion.

[28:16] During the spring, they'll call it their spring time promotion.

[28:18] During the summer, they'll call it their summer time.

[28:20] And when it's fall, they'll call it the back-to-school promotion.

[28:22] And so you don't actually have to change the offer

[28:25] once the offer is winning.

[28:26] You just change the wrapper around the offer

[28:28] to make the offer feel new and different.

[28:30] When in reality, it's still the highest converting offer you've got.

[28:32] And I talk about this a little bit more length in this chapter,

[28:35] but I like to think about it as being like a fraternity party

[28:38] planner.

[28:38] So back in my fraternities,

[28:41] you didn't really need to have a reason to have a party

[28:43] because you're in college and parties are what you do.

[28:46] But you would invent a reason why.

[28:48] So it's like John got his wisdom teeth pulled.

[28:50] Kager, right?

[28:51] And so you would just think about anything any reason

[28:54] why you can imagine.

[28:55] And at the end of the day, customers don't care what the reason is.

[28:57] They care about the offer.

[28:59] But the reason itself creates novelty.

[29:01] And I think if you are a small business,

[29:02] I think this is one of the most underutilized advertising angles

[29:05] is think about ridiculous things.

[29:06] It's my dog's birthday.

[29:07] And because of that, I'm giving two months

[29:09] free to anybody who joins my gym.

[29:11] Whatever.

[29:12] I turned 37, seven weeks ago.

[29:15] And as a result, I'm running a seven week promotion.

[29:17] Like it doesn't matter.

[29:19] But the thing that does matter is the offer

[29:21] and they already tested that.

[29:23] So once you nail the offer,

[29:24] you just go endless variations and wrapping paper on it.

[29:27] So now let's look into this.

[29:28] And there's an interesting little tidbit here

[29:30] that I think anyone can take.

[29:31] So they have a lot of ads from this particular creator.

[29:34] So this may be an influencer.

[29:36] This may be somebody that they paid.

[29:37] We'll see if they disclose that.

[29:39] Regardless, you can see that there's a lot

[29:40] of ads from this creator.

[29:41] So I'm guessing that they did pretty well

[29:43] or that they paid or are decent amount of money

[29:44] to make a lot of ads.

[29:45] Now what I'm curious about is whether they

[29:47] kept the meat of the ad the same

[29:48] and just alternated the hooks

[29:49] or if they actually made entirely new ads.

[29:51] So let's check it out.

[29:53] He's a viewer grown-out time for your own phone plan.

[29:56] We're not bringing your pair of family land

[29:58] and just draw a 25.

[29:59] The goodiest, so-called, how's he lesson?

[30:01] Two of these obvious per month.

[30:02] The memo will all plans are $50.00

[30:04] among the first three months

[30:06] at New Hasard Merris.

[30:07] So, I'll tell you if you're a Harrison star

[30:09] and he had an engine at Osar and so.

[30:12] All right, so this is actually pretty good advertising.

[30:17] And I'm gonna break down why.

[30:19] So, the Ryan Reynolds ads don't follow traditional

[30:22] direct response because they start with him

[30:23] to saying who he is because it's not really direct response,

[30:26] well, it is direct response,

[30:26] but it's going to the most aware audience.

[30:28] But for many of us business owners,

[30:30] people don't know who we are.

[30:31] And so we have to start with something a little bit different.

[30:33] So people might not know who she is

[30:35] and so we start with the callout, right?

[30:37] Which is, people noticing your ad

[30:38] is the most important part of the ad by a lot.

[30:40] If we're thinking about this,

[30:41] we need them to think, oh, this is for me.

[30:43] That is the thought that you want some

[30:45] and to think or feel the moment they begin the ad.

[30:48] Because the net means that you have paid,

[30:50] you've gotten them to pay attention.

[30:51] All right, so if I am a parent,

[30:54] I might pay attention because I'd be thinking of my kids

[30:56] and if I'm a kid, I'm gonna think about it.

[30:57] Now, if I'm a single person,

[30:58] I might just ignore this at all together.

[31:00] All right.

[31:00] And yet, we're not bringing your hair to family land

[31:02] and it's just only a multi-five.

[31:03] The good here is a little classy lesson

[31:05] to these hot face per month.

[31:06] So this is why I said, I think this is good advertising.

[31:09] So if you're going to mass market, again,

[31:12] this is drug and analogy or metaphor, right?

[31:16] And what's really clever about this

[31:18] is that they're just translating $15 into what the real cost

[31:21] is for somebody on an everyday expense

[31:24] that most people just don't really consider

[31:27] a real price or real actual cost.

[31:29] And so you'll see this in a lot of different companies

[31:31] and I do think it's really clever advertising

[31:34] because I think it makes the price real for people.

[31:38] And if you've noticed, like sometimes insurance plans

[31:41] are gonna be like for less than a dollar a day,

[31:42] you can ensure your loved one.

[31:43] And so you can say it as the price

[31:46] so it'd be like for her, it's $15 a month,

[31:48] they could say for less than $50 a day.

[31:50] Obviously, she's just as too coffee some month.

[31:52] But I would imagine, like, you could probably say,

[31:54] for less than a pack and gum a week, right?

[31:57] You could do a different, like, that would be a hook

[31:59] that I would think would probably work just as well.

[32:01] As the coffee, I think coffee's been a little bit overdone

[32:04] because a lot of people do things in terms of coffee.

[32:06] At the same time, maybe people do that because it works.

[32:08] So I would probably alternate if this is me

[32:10] being the creative director.

[32:11] I would alternate different props here.

[32:14] That would resonate potentially with different audiences there.

[32:17] Now, if we're going for kids, how many of them

[32:19] are buying expensive coffee?

[32:20] I don't know.

[32:21] What things are they buying that are in their price range?

[32:23] I would probably look at that as some of the substance dudes

[32:26] that look at for the analogies or metaphors

[32:29] that I draw in to compare the price of my thing versus the thing.

[32:32] And here's the key part that they're already spending money on.

[32:35] All pans are $50.00 for the first lemoss

[32:37] Abney, Westerners, so salty in the energy of your being

[32:40] a certain energy and energy in the middle of the software.

[32:43] So all we're doing, all they're doing here is just

[32:45] restating the offer.

[32:46] So this is pretty straightforward

[32:47] than they put a little joke at the end.

[32:48] And so actually, the last few words it

[32:51] ensune is drawing upon urgency.

[32:53] And so what's interesting about this

[32:57] is from a compliance perspective for advertising.

[33:00] The promotion could ensune.

[33:02] I'm not sure how compliant it is to have a promotion ensune

[33:07] and then the same offer begin again the next month

[33:10] for a different reason.

[33:12] So I don't know if your holiday promo ends on the first

[33:14] and then on the second, you are a spring promo starts.

[33:17] But it's the same offer.

[33:19] That seems great to me.

[33:20] I personally don't care.

[33:21] I think it's fine.

[33:22] But in terms of legal people, you could take it up with them.

[33:26] But the part that's key here is that if you can pull urgency,

[33:31] which is one of the elements of an amazing offer, right here,

[33:33] page 112, you want to say urgency is by x, date, or x time.

[33:39] And so now they're saying ensune.

[33:41] OK, that's how they do it.

[33:42] So soon is subjective.

[33:45] And so soon, soon could be for me 10 years from now.

[33:48] That is how they were able to have some little urgency

[33:51] around their CTA and probably have a complaint.

[33:53] I'm glad we got through that together.

[33:54] Let's look at the next ad here.

[33:56] And the key part that I want to look at is,

[33:58] this is the same creator.

[33:59] So I want to see if they're doing similar hooks,

[34:02] or they're just doing entirely different ads altogether.

[34:04] Let's do it.

[34:05] Welcome to a conversation between me and a video

[34:07] of wireless hours.

[34:08] We'd like to say a money on your phone bill.

[34:09] And the new here, I'm taking advantage of

[34:11] the models and the customer offer right now.

[34:12] But they're on the different panel.

[34:13] You can 100% guarantee that if you go with us,

[34:15] you'll say a huge, compared to your current brand.

[34:17] From the campaign, I was in the mobile.

[34:19] Oh, $15 a month.

[34:20] They're on the larger side, being an organization.

[34:22] And I offer you a similar plan at a much higher price.

[34:26] Just watching the last ad in this one,

[34:28] what is now clear to me is that they're running

[34:31] viral organic formats.

[34:33] And so the first one started with a PSA.

[34:35] He's saying to me,

[34:36] I don't have time to hear your own phone fan.

[34:38] All right, so PSA's, I'm guessing that format

[34:42] probably was a viral organic format.

[34:44] And if this is a creator, which I'm assuming she is,

[34:47] I don't know her name is, but I'm assuming she's a creator.

[34:49] I'm sure you guys can let me know in the comments.

[34:51] She now has another format that is a fairly common

[34:55] viral organic format.

[34:57] Somebody who's done a really good job of this is Erica Colberg.

[34:59] She does like financial stuff.

[35:01] And she does a lot of conversations or pseudo

[35:03] conversations that happen between represented as a company

[35:05] and her.

[35:06] She does legal stuff, but fundamentally exact same format.

[35:10] And so that's the format.

[35:12] But if we're looking at the theme,

[35:13] guess what theme it is yet again, auspverses them.

[35:17] And so they have just found that from the underdog

[35:19] perspective, that theme works well.

[35:21] Well, I didn't know when to tell me about Mittemol's Yale.

[35:23] I'm honestly shocked that this is a following

[35:25] at my view right now.

[35:26] You can add minimal limited of hand for a $15

[35:29] for the three months when he's kind of as a new hesterner.

[35:32] But I love about it.

[35:33] It's really liable of portable presenting though.

[35:35] It's a news deal.

[35:36] So it ends soon.

[35:38] You want to pay less to your wrong plan in 2025.

[35:40] Don't wait.

[35:41] It's an available rather steel while you still hand,

[35:44] I'll be very careful.

[35:45] We basically have a hook in the 10 of urgency.

[35:47] All right.

[35:48] Now, the thing is is that yet again, she says it ends soon.

[35:51] Now, reason why it was New Year.

[35:52] So that makes it a little bit more believeable or compelling.

[35:54] But the end of the day, they could run this New Year's plan

[35:56] for six months, who knows.

[35:58] Now, the hook here is a pretty common hook for reviews

[36:01] and things like that that happens in organic.

[36:03] I will say that for those of you who do consume organic

[36:06] shorts like this on a regular basis,

[36:08] you probably have seen these.

[36:09] And it almost, this is me personally just saying this.

[36:12] This is a pretty common structure for people who get paid

[36:14] to do an endorsement.

[36:16] And they're like, why has no one told me about so.

[36:18] And so it's protein powder.

[36:19] It tastes so amazing.

[36:20] I thought it was going to be, right,

[36:21] then they go into it.

[36:23] All right, let's just go to the next one.

[36:24] Because you'll notice there actually,

[36:25] let's just hit the number of times she hits urgency

[36:27] and this because I think that's actually kind of interesting.

[36:29] I'm honestly shocked that this is a feeling that I need right now.

[36:32] You can get it.

[36:33] No one's going to pay in for a big $1 a month,

[36:35] but at the first three months, when you sign up as a New Year's

[36:38] for her, but I love the body is it's reliable, affordable,

[36:41] for a sitting though.

[36:42] It's a New Year's deal.

[36:43] So, too.

[36:44] Also, it ends the situation here.

[36:45] One of hate, less rebound hand and 2025.

[36:48] Don't wait.

[36:49] As the mobile, rather steel, the balladou still can.

[36:52] I'll be right here for you.

[36:53] So, she makes five urgency CTAs in basically

[36:57] last 15 seconds of the year.

[36:59] All right, so obviously this direct response being the goal

[37:02] to get someone to respond immediately for the ad.

[37:04] He is the agent, not necessarily.

[37:06] Put it to the state in your phone,

[37:07] a February, a sign that is when it involves

[37:09] a number of among the knit data for $15 a month

[37:12] for the first three months, I've been in customer in.

[37:14] Yes, you could vote the rest of the winter

[37:16] only paying 40 by the last three phone ban

[37:18] with our compromising on quality.

[37:20] The savings here are insane,

[37:22] and we're going to be more or less so much

[37:23] you're here to pay a net to be bored.

[37:25] So, let's, let's, I think this one's worth breaking down.

[37:27] You'll say, you don't miss the sale, but it's.

[37:29] So, that's the hook, right?

[37:31] So, again, she does the PSA thing,

[37:32] and so the PSA is yet again a viral format.

[37:35] So, then you consider if you are running ads

[37:37] is look at what organic formats are trending

[37:43] for creators, and there are formats.

[37:45] Believe, there are formats.

[37:46] And try and see if you can get your ads

[37:49] to mimic that format, because then it will look more native.

[37:52] And when you have, like, fundamentally,

[37:53] the best advertisements or things

[37:54] that don't look like advertisements.

[37:56] And like, if, this, like, this, if this were just a creator

[38:00] who were making this recommendation,

[38:01] you'd be like, wow, it'd be incredibly compelling.

[38:03] And so the more it can look not like an ad,

[38:05] then the better in general it'll convert.

[38:07] All right, so let's do the next thing.

[38:08] Oh, put it to the seat, you're phone, a February,

[38:10] sign it, that is a quiz.

[38:12] So, they do actually have an end to this promotion.

[38:14] And so now this is, again, a hard push on urgency.

[38:17] But we've looked at a bunch of ads,

[38:19] all of them have at the same price,

[38:21] which is $15.

[38:24] And so that obviously is the price point that they have

[38:25] seem convert and having the three month offer is what's working.

[38:28] And it almost offers a hum, the net data for $15 a month

[38:31] for the first three months of New Customer A.

[38:33] It has.

[38:34] So, same restatement of offer,

[38:36] she's just explaining what it is.

[38:38] And if you are making an offer, you just want to do it.

[38:40] As clearly as possible, and you can see this claim

[38:42] we're in the middle of the screen.

[38:43] If you do have terms around payments like for them,

[38:45] obviously it's, they're paying it all up front.

[38:47] Then that comes, and there's obviously

[38:49] great limitters in terms of how fast it is.

[38:51] But she tries to attenuate that big concern,

[38:54] which obviously I'll bet you if they are good advertisers,

[38:57] which they are, they probably read the comments.

[39:00] And the no one concerned, by the way, big pro tip here,

[39:03] if you want to know the things that you need to include in your ads

[39:06] in terms of what concerns prospects have,

[39:09] not customers, prospects have, is actually just read the comments

[39:12] because people will tell you their objections

[39:14] for why they didn't sign up or why they don't like about your thing.

[39:17] And then in your next batch of ads,

[39:19] you can include those key points at overcome them.

[39:22] All right.

[39:23] Yes.

[39:24] You, co-the rest of the winter,

[39:25] only paying 45 dollars a refund,

[39:27] pan, without compromising on quality.

[39:29] Pause.

[39:30] So two things here.

[39:31] One is, she just restates the offer in a different way.

[39:34] Instead of $15 per month for three months,

[39:35] she'd then just translates it again,

[39:37] saying, that means $45 until the end of the winter.

[39:40] All right.

[39:40] So it's just a different way of restating it,

[39:41] which I think is worth doing, because sometimes it just

[39:44] hits different for different audiences.

[39:46] And sometimes it's like, oh, that actually

[39:47] means $15 per month for three months for some audiences

[39:51] we can work.

[39:51] And for other audiences, $15 are $45

[39:54] until the end of the winter might be even more compelling.

[39:57] I would say for me personally,

[39:58] I think that is actually more compelling.

[40:00] All right.

[40:00] Now, the last part that she said is without compromising on quality.

[40:03] Now, I think that in other ads,

[40:05] they hit harder on the fact that the quality is compromised.

[40:08] She just puts a little one liner in there,

[40:09] because it's the biggest concern anyone would have

[40:11] for the budget provider.

[40:12] The savings here are insane.

[40:14] Have a miracle to be wireless,

[40:15] so much duty to me in a TV program.

[40:17] Big picture here.

[40:19] They are running a pretty clear direct response strategy.

[40:24] They are leveraging UGC, which every business can and should have.

[40:27] If you have a brand's book, spend then introducing them.

[40:30] Obviously in this ride in Reynolds scenario,

[40:32] he continues to do it, so I'm guessing that it works.

[40:34] I would be curious to test.

[40:36] I've seen it.

[40:37] I'd be curious to test what a cold or harder hook

[40:43] would do with Ryan Reynolds as the person in the app.

[40:46] Like that would probably be one of the first things

[40:48] out of it test.

[40:49] If I were testing offers, I would look at by one get two,

[40:52] or by two get four, and see how that converted.

[40:55] Alternatively, by three and three is fine.

[40:57] There's nothing wrong with it,

[40:58] but I would, those are things that I would test the hell out of.

[41:01] I'm assuming that sometimes you can break it back

[41:04] from what number converts, a $45 may be the number,

[41:08] and then it's just like, how many ways can we mix and match $45?

[41:12] What's that?

[41:13] You guys want to see where all of this traffic is pushing?

[41:15] Fine, we'll also look at the landing page.

[41:17] Let's do it.

[41:18] OK, so this is mithmobile.com, which is their CTA in every ad.

[41:23] And I do think big picture, if you have all your traffic

[41:26] pushing to one page, then you want to make sure

[41:29] that it's all congruent.

[41:30] And actually, it's a huge mistake that

[41:31] thing a lot of marketers make is that you

[41:33] have all these different creative hooks and stuff,

[41:34] but then you don't actually go for congruids.

[41:37] And one of the easiest ways to drop conversion

[41:39] is have someone click somewhere, and then not

[41:41] get what they think they're getting.

[41:42] And so a lot of the elements here are, look,

[41:45] OK, let's just look at this page here.

[41:47] So right on the top, time is literally ticking.

[41:49] So they're showing true urgency, right

[41:52] to the top, big banner, saying, you need to act now.

[41:56] Now, on top of that, they have a banner across the top.

[41:59] That is probably also something that

[42:00] moves forward in the funnel.

[42:01] And if you look at acquisition.com, for example,

[42:03] we have a banner across the top, because it's actually

[42:05] one of the most clicked buttons.

[42:07] And so you can have the same CTA with multiple buttons

[42:11] on the page.

[42:11] And in general, who will thumb not forever?

[42:15] But if you only have one CTA on a site,

[42:17] if you add another, you will increase conversions.

[42:19] If you add a third, you'll also probably

[42:21] get increased conversion.

[42:22] At a certain point, you have too many referees in the field.

[42:24] And no one can see the actual offer.

[42:26] But in the beginning, two, three, sometimes CTAs

[42:29] in terms of button for someone to take action

[42:31] will usually increase the conversion to page.

[42:33] Now, they're basically just slamming

[42:36] over the head with urgency.

[42:36] Now, they don't have scarcity, because it's unlimited customer.

[42:38] So that's not where they're hitting.

[42:40] They're just going on time here.

[42:41] So big picture of those you don't know.

[42:43] Scare City is limiting quantity.

[42:45] Urgency is limiting time.

[42:47] And so people talk about scarcity and urgency interchangeably.

[42:49] And that's not how it actually works.

[42:50] There's separate things that can be combined,

[42:52] but they exist separately.

[42:54] All right.

[42:54] Now, they do have a caveat.

[42:56] It's new customers.

[42:57] All right.

[42:58] So it's not all customers.

[42:58] But new customers get three months of unlimited premium

[43:01] wireless $415.

[43:02] All right.

[43:02] So let's, I mean, it's pretty clear what they want us to do here.

[43:05] Let's scroll down.

[43:06] Let's go all the way down.

[43:06] Is there anything else there?

[43:09] OK.

[43:10] So two points to the price of one.

[43:14] So if you switch from one of their primary competitors,

[43:18] they have a separate offer for you there.

[43:20] All right.

[43:20] Now let's look at the secret sauce.

[43:24] I'll bet you this is optimized for mobile, too.

[43:26] So 5G for free, we're online, flexible payment plans.

[43:29] OK.

[43:30] Bring your own everything.

[43:31] So it's really interesting about that BYUOE.

[43:34] Another budget provider, which you may have heard of,

[43:36] which is Spirit Airlines, has the same thing.

[43:38] They call it your ass and gas.

[43:39] So they say, like, we give you nothing.

[43:41] And they kind of lean into how cheap they are.

[43:43] And they are the cheapest product.

[43:44] But they do nickel and dime people.

[43:45] So let's scroll back up.

[43:46] And let's actually, let's go like we're going to convert.

[43:49] So why would they have, so because this is,

[43:51] this is actually like dev work that they'd have to put in.

[43:53] So there's probably a reason they added this bar in.

[43:56] I would imagine the no more one concern, which they also

[43:58] talk about in their ads is what's the service quality.

[44:01] And so if someone's like, I'll switch to it

[44:03] if there's really good coverage in my area.

[44:04] And so they're probably resolving one of the biggest concern.

[44:06] So let's just do acquisition.coms.

[44:08] So there we go.

[44:09] All right, so there we go.

[44:10] So they tell us that art devices compatible

[44:12] and they have excellent coverage.

[44:14] Now I'm going to be real with you.

[44:18] My question would be, is like, what's excellent?

[44:22] Now they do have a map so they can visualize it.

[44:24] OK, so they've got some towers that looks like it's right there

[44:27] at the corner.

[44:28] But all right, if I'm trying to make a decision,

[44:30] I might say, well, they said it's excellent.

[44:32] So I guess I'm going to consider.

[44:33] So now we go view plans.

[44:34] So let's do that.

[44:36] OK, so this was actually leads us to the same place

[44:38] as the original button.

[44:39] So if someone takes a detour and then goes there,

[44:41] pretty basically you handle the objection

[44:43] and then they go back to the sale.

[44:44] All right, so choose your plan.

[44:47] All right, so let's see what we got here.

[44:48] We got three months, six months, 12 months.

[44:49] They obviously want either their drawing

[44:51] attention in the three month offer.

[44:52] And so what's interesting is that they have the same starting

[44:55] fee but just different ongoing fees after the fact.

[44:59] To me, the six month offer is a dummy offer.

[45:02] And I'll bet you they have their split

[45:06] between the three and the 12.

[45:08] And so look at why they would do it.

[45:11] So it's like, OK, well, I can only commit to three months

[45:15] and then it's $30 a month or I can pay $35 a month

[45:20] with 210 upfront.

[45:23] I'm like, I don't know.

[45:24] For me, if I look at this, I'm either three or 12.

[45:26] And so when you have three tiers, by the way,

[45:29] you almost never want the three tiers to be evenly split.

[45:32] So we're going to live in the pricing book.

[45:33] Yola, we can do what we want.

[45:35] It's our video.

[45:36] So where you move the middle on a three tier offer,

[45:42] determines where you want to nudge the customer.

[45:45] So if I want more people to take my 12 month offer,

[45:52] I will make my six month offer really close

[45:54] to the 12 month offer.

[45:55] And so I'm like, oh, well, shoot, this is so close.

[45:58] I'll just do that one.

[46:00] So this is the typical small medium large

[46:02] show to play that movie theater is done for ages.

[46:06] So let's say that you've got equal ounce differences

[46:10] between sodas.

[46:15] So let's say that this is 10 ounces.

[46:17] This is 15 ounces, and this is 20 ounces.

[46:20] So that's what these sodas are.

[46:21] Obviously, Edmovith theater would be like a gazillion ounces,

[46:23] and they just give you a gallon of whatever soda you want.

[46:26] Here, you're asking someone to make a logical decision,

[46:29] and it's proportional to how much they buy.

[46:32] And they're not really saving anything by buying more.

[46:33] So functionally, this would incentivize people to go here,

[46:37] because there's no savings for buying more.

[46:40] And if you wanted to just get some more later,

[46:42] you take on less risk by buying a smaller purchase,

[46:44] and you could always just double up again later

[46:46] if you so desired.

[46:47] Now, what is this next pricing tier tell you?

[46:51] So let's say we keep our $5, and then we have $6 here,

[46:54] and then we've got $10 here.

[46:56] What does this tell you?

[46:57] That tells you here that this is the best value option.

[47:00] The first is here.

[47:02] Now, let's look at a different pricing scheme.

[47:04] So if we have $5 on the low option,

[47:07] but let's say that now we've got $9 on this option,

[47:10] and $10, what is the pricing tier that we're pushing towards?

[47:13] We're like, well, dude, for an extra dollar,

[47:16] I'm getting another five ounces.

[47:18] This is not a bad gig.

[47:19] Now, because of this, basically,

[47:22] talk about how to be between the 10 and the 20,

[47:25] we would probably realistically,

[47:26] what this would probably be priced at,

[47:28] like if we were in the movie theaters,

[47:30] this would probably be eight bucks,

[47:31] this would probably be seven,

[47:33] and so this would then push more people to here.

[47:37] And so how you priced your three options,

[47:39] you can tell what offer a smart business owner

[47:43] is trying to incentivize you to take.

[47:45] So we're getting into a little bit of advanced pricing,

[47:48] but you're an advanced person, so let's talk about it.

[47:51] So if I have this $6 option, what is it really communicate?

[47:55] We think for a dollar more, I'm going to get 50% more soda.

[47:59] That's a pretty good deal.

[48:00] For here, for a dollar more,

[48:02] I get another five ounces of soda.

[48:04] And so these prices are always taken in aggregate, right?

[48:08] Now, if I have a lot of people coming in the door

[48:11] and everyone's buying smalls,

[48:13] and I want them to upgrade,

[48:15] then I'm going to put my price here.

[48:16] If everyone's coming in and they're getting mediums,

[48:20] and I want to push them the largest,

[48:21] then I'm going to move my price of mediums up

[48:23] to make the large more appealing.

[48:24] So what you're ultimately trying to do

[48:26] is maximize revenue per soda buyer, right?

[48:29] And so it'll depend where your average customer

[48:31] is actually entering the business

[48:33] to determine which of these you would actually push.

[48:36] So this is a sales page, all right?

[48:38] And so sales pages are different than landing pages.

[48:41] So the first page was relatively short,

[48:43] just wanted to get people to take the next step.

[48:45] And they have probably tested pushing people straight

[48:47] to the sales page, and it probably doesn't convert as high.

[48:49] So they have the intermediary step to get more qualified

[48:53] people to the page.

[48:54] Why does that work?

[48:55] No idea.

[48:56] I'm going to just tell you that it often does work

[48:57] when you have too much traffic going in non-nuff conversion.

[48:59] You add a step, you add friction,

[49:01] and then it sorts the right traffic.

[49:02] All right.

[49:03] So let's look at the actual page structure here.

[49:04] So let's go to the top.

[49:05] So boom, big thing.

[49:07] We have our urgency yet again.

[49:08] And then we have our offer right there in bold

[49:10] so that everyone doesn't miss the thing.

[49:11] Last chance yet again, 50% off cool.

[49:14] They're restating the offer multiple times.

[49:16] And then they restate the benefits

[49:17] and are either high speed.

[49:18] So if really good at this, you've got headline, subhead,

[49:20] and then three bullets, which is a really common structure

[49:23] that I talk about.

[49:27] And it's interesting because above the fold,

[49:30] which is when someone loads on their phone,

[49:32] you'll see a very common structure.

[49:35] In the paid ad section, 147, I talk about three

[49:38] different landing page structures that work really well.

[49:40] And so what they have here is they're using

[49:41] layout three above the top.

[49:43] So they've got headline, subhead.

[49:45] So unlimited premium is headline.

[49:47] Subhead is last chance.

[49:49] And then the three bullets right here.

[49:50] Now I have my below the button.

[49:52] They have there's above minor difference.

[49:54] But fundamentally, they're using this structure.

[49:56] Now notice I have attention avatar at the top.

[49:58] What do you think that is?

[50:00] That's time is literally ticking.

[50:01] And it says new customer offer.

[50:03] So avatar is right there.

[50:04] Attention new customers.

[50:06] These are timeless advertising principles

[50:09] because they work.

[50:10] This is how you convert traffic.

[50:12] So we've got the button.

[50:14] One tiny tweak I would consider on this page

[50:16] is I think the button is not visible enough.

[50:19] And so I would consider making that more,

[50:21] I would make it jump out more because I think

[50:24] you could easily miss that.

[50:25] So let's scroll down.

[50:25] It says choose your plans.

[50:26] So now it's telling you what to do.

[50:27] OK, great.

[50:28] So now this is just all plans include this.

[50:32] Are you new, great?

[50:33] And then just restates the offer yet again.

[50:36] And then we see our three six and 12-month plan.

[50:39] Now they made it user friendly for mobile

[50:41] so that you can toggle between them, which I think

[50:44] really interestingly.

[50:45] So imagine the user experience here.

[50:46] So if I'm looking at this, I'm going to see $15 a month

[50:49] and I go to six, six months.

[50:51] It goes up and then I go to 12 months.

[50:53] $15 a month.

[50:54] Huh, what is that telling me to do?

[50:56] Well, I came for the three, but man, this one for 12 is

[51:00] impad.

[51:01] And so what's interesting about this is that the intro offer

[51:04] is 15 a month and then it bumps up.

[51:07] But the 12 month offer is 15 a month and then it stays 15

[51:10] a month.

[51:10] And so if someone has a sensitivity to that price point,

[51:13] then they basically make it available to them.

[51:15] It's like, hey, if you want to stay at 15 a month,

[51:17] you can, you just got to make the commitment.

[51:20] So let's scroll down a little more.

[51:22] Did you know, once the three months are up,

[51:24] your new customer offer, you can renew.

[51:26] Yeah, so they're saying, hey, if you can't,

[51:27] so this is if you can't decide right now, don't worry,

[51:30] you can change it later, which is a great risk

[51:32] or virtual.

[51:33] So facts.

[51:34] So now they're getting into features here

[51:35] and they're probably going to show speed

[51:37] because what's the biggest concern everyone has, coverage

[51:39] and speed.

[51:40] All right, so they're going through these things.

[51:41] And for us, we already checked RZIP code beforehand,

[51:44] which they helped absorb.

[51:45] Now, I don't think anyone's going to know anything about this.

[51:48] Like, like, I honestly, and maybe this is a compliant thing

[51:51] they have to show, which is very possible.

[51:54] So that one, I don't know, it might be a legal thing.

[51:56] All right, let's scroll down, because obviously this

[51:57] is not going to give everyone.

[51:58] Okay, bring your family.

[51:59] So this is an upsell potential.

[52:01] So it's like, okay, not a, well, I've got you

[52:03] because what's another concern someone has?

[52:05] Well, I don't want to switch on my own,

[52:06] I don't want to bring my whole family ever,

[52:07] because I don't want to be a separate plan then.

[52:09] Cool, so they give a family plan.

[52:11] All right, now yet again, we scroll down to the bottom

[52:14] and if you missed it, because let's say,

[52:16] you think about click journey, right?

[52:18] So someone clicks over and they didn't,

[52:20] they just went straight to the offer.

[52:21] Now that they're actually in consideration,

[52:23] so they're thinking, am I going to, am I going to take this off

[52:25] or am I going to take my credit card out?

[52:27] They might now, the coverage device checker

[52:29] is what I consider a buying question.

[52:31] And so sometimes in a sales call,

[52:32] this is obviously doing this in a virtual setting,

[52:34] but there are questions that are like,

[52:37] there are questions that are kind of more open-ended,

[52:39] like, discovery questions that are customer-odd ask.

[52:41] And if someone says, like, talking about payment plans, right?

[52:45] That's a buying question.

[52:46] They're strongly in consideration.

[52:48] And so this is something to help overcome

[52:50] any obstacles around purchasing.

[52:52] So they were like, okay, the price makes sense.

[52:54] If you have it in my area, I'll attend your gym,

[52:58] how far away are you from me?

[53:00] That's going to be a real considerate, like,

[53:02] and if you're close enough, they have some line in their mind

[53:04] that if it's over it, it's acceptable,

[53:06] and they'll make the purchase.

[53:08] All right, so scroll down.

[53:09] And this last section is super common on a sales page,

[53:14] which is FAQs.

[53:15] So almost always having an FAQ on a sales page

[53:20] will increase conversion.

[53:21] Because just think about every one of these questions

[53:23] as a couple percentage points of customers

[53:25] that haven't gotten all their questions resolved yet,

[53:27] and either a deeper explanation for some of the sentences

[53:30] or headlines from a Bob, or they have some unresolved concerns

[53:33] that didn't really make sense to weave into the page,

[53:35] because it would overall lose some people.

[53:37] And so you basically stack those at the bottom,

[53:40] and you've probably seen this on a lot of pages.

[53:41] Even if you look at an Amazon purchase page,

[53:44] they're going to have their FAQs at the bottom

[53:46] where the seller will answer some of the questions

[53:48] that people are asking.

[53:49] And so if you, by the way, if you want a really great way

[53:52] to study, like how to make sales pages, study Amazon,

[53:56] think about how they structure their pages,

[53:58] and how many elements of persuasion

[54:01] are woven in that are real and actual.

[54:03] Now, they obviously, they're a trillion dollar company,

[54:05] and so they have a lot of resources

[54:06] that they're disposable, but you can still

[54:08] use the elements of persuasion that they have.

[54:10] And fundamentally, that's what they're harnessing here.

[54:12] And at the very bottom, I see this is a,

[54:15] if you haven't decided to buy yet,

[54:18] why don't you enter our long-term inertia sequence

[54:21] where we'll send you emails to hopefully get you to buy later.

[54:24] And so that's basically what we're doing here.

[54:26] So, what's that?

[54:28] You want to see the emails that they send

[54:30] to confirm more customers?

[54:31] Fine, we'll look into them.

[54:33] Okay, so, big picture, this is their actual email sequence.

[54:37] So we looked it up.

[54:38] You'll notice that these are very visual.

[54:40] So these are very picture-driven.

[54:42] So, I want to make a clear point here.

[54:45] It's, I would say it's very split

[54:47] in the types of products that are being sold,

[54:49] what types of emails convert.

[54:52] And so, I've seen this is just me, Alex's point of view.

[54:57] Pictures do really well with physical products

[55:00] and low ticket items.

[55:01] So people just like click and buy, right?

[55:04] If you sell services or complex,

[55:07] it services or complex products or high ticket products,

[55:09] oftentimes, basically almost the exact opposite perspective

[55:13] this, which is lots of text that's plain text,

[55:16] maybe one hyperlink, that's all not formatted,

[55:19] to basically make it look like a real email.

[55:22] That's someone might send to you.

[55:23] That tends to be the best deliverability,

[55:25] which will ultimately convert more people

[55:27] for those more complex things.

[55:28] So if you sell services that are complex,

[55:30] I would lean towards that.

[55:31] Here, if you're e-commerce, which fundamentally this is e-commerce,

[55:34] it's just a phone service that you're getting.

[55:37] It makes sense.

[55:37] Now, one last point here is that,

[55:39] notice that they don't offer phones, remember the BYOE.

[55:42] So they're able to sell at a much lower price point

[55:45] because most of the other carriers include the phone

[55:48] in some sort of payment plan with your service.

[55:51] And so a big portion of what you're paying for

[55:53] is the $1,000 smartphone that they're subsidizing

[55:56] for you over X-Preda months with a decent markup.

[56:00] All right, so let's look at the offers they have.

[56:02] So, email one is they just say,

[56:04] they just restate the offer.

[56:06] Cool.

[56:07] Go the next one.

[56:08] All right, now they say, it's easy.

[56:10] So let's think about the elements of value here.

[56:13] So first they restate the offer.

[56:14] Then they say, by the way, it's easy.

[56:16] Now, the making is a mid-mobile.

[56:18] So now they're saying, okay, someone didn't take the first two.

[56:20] So now let's just give them a little bit more information.

[56:24] Let's talk more about the value that they're getting.

[56:26] That's the next email.

[56:27] Yeah, and so here they're also telling a little bit

[56:28] of the story of the founder or at least the spokesperson.

[56:32] And so this would be more common

[56:33] if someone hasn't made the purchase for you.

[56:36] You're explaining more about yourself.

[56:37] Basically, we're trying to build some trust,

[56:39] build report with the prospect.

[56:40] All right, let's go the next one.

[56:42] All right, so now they're hitting the family people.

[56:45] They're like, maybe you didn't buy because of this reason.

[56:46] You might have missed it on the site.

[56:48] And so what they're really doing is they're chunking down a lot

[56:51] and just focusing on one obstacle at a time,

[56:53] which is what I would encourage you to do in email follow-up

[56:55] is there's going to be, let's say, 13 reasons people are going to buy.

[56:58] And instead of saying, here's 13 reasons, let's handle them all.

[57:01] You just hit one email on a time that hits each reason in order

[57:05] of prevalence, meaning the more common the concern is,

[57:10] the earlier on in the email sequence it should be.

[57:13] All right.

[57:15] Now, here's the 4011 on Sim.

[57:17] So this is like, this is going to be a concern question.

[57:20] This is a detailed question where Sim was like,

[57:21] what about Sim cards?

[57:23] What about my use case?

[57:25] I'm a special snowflake.

[57:25] So they're covering the special snowflake scenarios.

[57:28] And I would imagine that it continued on this process.

[57:30] Now, if I had to rate this email follow-up,

[57:34] I would probably rate it like a being real.

[57:38] Probably a five out of 10.

[57:40] Main reason here is they're just hitting,

[57:43] they're just restating the offer and over and over again.

[57:46] I think that what could make this better

[57:49] is if they made it feel a little bit more tailored.

[57:53] So if they could expand in personalization,

[57:55] now I don't know what segmentation they have in the background,

[57:57] but personalization they're marketing.

[57:58] And thinking about onboarding a customer

[58:02] before they're a customer,

[58:04] is a great way to get people to do those first steps.

[58:07] That coverage question that they have,

[58:09] it's like, can I get someone to take a Microsoft towards me?

[58:12] And so I'd be thinking, what other things

[58:13] are kind of micro steps that get someone

[58:15] who's going to get further along the road of consideration

[58:18] before they make a purchase?

[58:20] Another one would be like,

[58:21] okay, can we deliver them some sort of lead magnet?

[58:24] So once we have their zip,

[58:26] it's like here's other people in your area

[58:28] who have said that this is really good.

[58:29] That would probably be really compelling.

[58:31] Another type of testimony might read

[58:34] someone who's like you.

[58:35] Another one might be someone who considered buying

[58:38] at the same time as you and is now already enjoying the benefits.

[58:41] And so people thinking cohorts,

[58:43] so it's like if I considered buying this last week

[58:45] and that show someone else who did buy last week

[58:47] and is enjoying the benefits,

[58:49] it becomes more compelling

[58:50] because you double down on likeness.

[58:52] That person's just like me.

[58:53] All right, additionally,

[58:56] you can reference my Rehanna video

[58:58] on some of the things they did for their offer.

[59:00] But in this offer, having birthday and anniversary offers

[59:03] is just it's one of the reason why

[59:05] to extend personalized offers to people

[59:07] that will increase their specific urgency.

[59:10] But the thing is is that you know

[59:11] that every month you've got one 12 people

[59:12] who are turning a certain age.

[59:13] And so you've got basically one sixth

[59:16] because you've hit anniversaries and birthdays

[59:18] every single month that are getting a special offer.

[59:20] And so if you do that on a regular basis,

[59:22] it's like every month you get this kind of lift

[59:23] to one sixth of your audience

[59:25] that's getting a special offer specific to them.

[59:27] All right, and so here are a couple of action.

[59:29] We'll take a ways that I think you can take away

[59:31] from their site to convert more traffic.

[59:33] So number one is website optimization.

[59:35] So if you haven't tested your page load speed,

[59:38] just do it.

[59:39] And then most tools will tell you some of the things

[59:42] that images that need to be compressed

[59:44] so that you can decrease file size and ultimately load faster.

[59:47] Now this may not sound interesting.

[59:48] But for every one second saved,

[59:50] you get, I think Neil Patel had this.

[59:53] He's already started this one,

[59:54] but I think it's something in the neighborhood

[59:55] of like a two and a half or something like that

[59:57] percent increase in conversion per second.

[60:00] And so sometimes I've seen some of your pages.

[60:02] You have nine seconds, 13 seconds of load time.

[60:05] And it's like if you can get that down to like three seconds,

[60:07] you've got two plus percent times 10

[60:11] in terms of improvement on conversion.

[60:14] Right?

[60:15] If you click and it's like changing a channel on a television,

[60:18] you're going to convert more people.

[60:19] Now the next one is using side by side comparisons.

[60:23] I'm surprised that they aren't really hitting on this heavily.

[60:26] So they talk about it really heavily in their advertising,

[60:30] but they're not showing what other people are doing comparatively.

[60:35] And so this is one where like progressive kind of pioneered

[60:38] this in the insurance industry,

[60:39] where they were showing what other plans cover

[60:44] and prices associated.

[60:46] And I think if you are the underdog,

[60:48] then it's okay to do that.

[60:49] If you're the top dog, you don't show anybody else's.

[60:51] But if you're making a budget as your primary sales point,

[60:56] then using side by side makes sense

[60:57] because they can see the delta.

[60:58] One of the other things here that I think is probably worth mentioning

[61:01] is hidden fees.

[61:02] One of the big concerns with budget providers,

[61:05] like budget airlines,

[61:06] is that they will charge you for each piece of luggage,

[61:08] they'll charge you for drinks, they'll charge you for everything.

[61:10] It's like, are they going to charge me for anything else?

[61:12] And I think being explicit about that somewhere

[61:15] would probably increase conversion.

[61:17] So if I'm them,

[61:19] I would be looking at the same plus good stuff,

[61:23] away from bad stuff,

[61:24] and if you don't work with us,

[61:27] so selling the don't,

[61:28] you're going to keep having bad stuff

[61:29] and keep not having good stuff.

[61:30] And that's where having the juxtaposition of the other providers

[61:33] could prove for very good fodder for ongoing emails.

[61:36] And so like one email would just be more good stuff.

[61:39] Next email would be less bad stuff.

[61:41] Next email would be,

[61:42] if you don't do this, you'll keep having bad stuff.

[61:45] If you don't do this, you'll keep not having good stuff.

[61:48] And then each of the good stuff and bad stuff,

[61:50] you have three vectors that you can look at across all four of those,

[61:53] which is risk, speed and ease.

[61:55] And so showing the visual of the step-by-step process,

[61:57] of what it takes to sign up,

[61:59] that could de-risk someone's concerned about how easy it is.

[62:03] For my speed perspective,

[62:04] I would probably hit on more points of like,

[62:06] well how quickly can I get apt activated?

[62:08] Right?

[62:09] Like, could I be using my phone within a few minutes?

[62:11] If I could, I would want to know that.

[62:12] So I would talk about speed.

[62:14] From a risk perspective,

[62:16] they do have commitments associated.

[62:20] And so I would want to know what are my cancellation policies.

[62:22] And what does canceling look like?

[62:24] So believe it or not, if you actually just show someone

[62:25] how to cancel before they buy,

[62:27] sometimes they're just more likely to buy,

[62:28] because they're like, oh, I understand how you can get out of this.

[62:29] It reverses the risk of the purchase.

[62:31] Now, the big obvious one is that price is another thing

[62:34] that they do, but I wouldn't say that's an area of opportunity.

[62:36] I think they already hit their price pretty hard.

[62:38] If you like these types of real business breakdowns,

[62:40] I had a small business owner who was a stylist who flew out

[62:42] to Vegas to have her business broken down and improved.

[62:45] It's the video of the year that I got the highest amount

[62:49] of praise from business owners for.

[62:51] We said, this was the best video they had had.

[62:53] And so I want everyone to watch it, because it's really good.

[62:55] So, go check it out.

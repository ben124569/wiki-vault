[00:00] What's going on everyone?

[00:01] Today, I want to talk about what it's like to live as the ultra-walthy.

[00:05] And so, hi, my name's Alex, owner of Alan,

[00:07] for Seas Labs, Jim Lunch, the number of other profolio companies

[00:10] who did 120 plus million in last four years and growing.

[00:14] And I've learned a lot of lessons that I want to share some of those with you.

[00:17] And so, one of the things is kind of understanding

[00:20] how the ultra-walthy live.

[00:21] And I want to talk about some stuff that no one, no one,

[00:23] I feel like no one talks about.

[00:25] And it's something my dad used to tell me

[00:27] when I was growing up.

[00:28] He said, never be impressed by money.

[00:30] And he used to say that so many times when I was growing up.

[00:32] And I didn't really get it as much,

[00:34] but he was so big on it and I felt like,

[00:35] hey, look at that guy, he's so rich and he was just like,

[00:37] don't be impressed by money.

[00:39] And it's really kind of stuck with me.

[00:41] And so, what I want to do is kind of show you some transparent things

[00:45] so that you can hopefully not be impressed by money.

[00:47] So, it's really easy to look ultra-walthy.

[00:51] All right, so I'm going to show you some of the things

[00:54] that you see on Instagram.

[00:56] And some of the things that you see around,

[00:59] and I'm going to break it down for you money-wise

[01:01] so that hopefully it stops impressing you.

[01:03] All right, so we're going to talk about private jets.

[01:06] We're going to talk about, and you know what I'll do?

[01:08] And at the end, I'll tell you which one I think is worth it.

[01:10] All right, so, you got private jets.

[01:12] Let's say you've got an exotic car.

[01:14] All right, okay.

[01:16] Let's say, what else you, I probably want to penthouse, right?

[01:19] Want to penthouse?

[01:20] Look, what else do we have on our dreams list?

[01:23] We got penthouse.

[01:24] Let's see, you want really nice clothes, right?

[01:26] We want really expensive, you know, expensive clothes.

[01:30] All right, and then, let's say fancy restaurants.

[01:35] All right, sweet.

[01:40] Let's walk through it.

[01:42] So, this comes down to like, if you're like, man,

[01:45] I really, you know, my dream lifestyle.

[01:46] And I think this is a useful exercise for anyone to go through.

[01:49] If you haven't already defined this stuff,

[01:50] but let's say that you travel six times a year.

[01:52] So, every two months, all right?

[01:54] You go somewhere there and back.

[01:55] Every travel, at least in the US, is going to be two hours.

[01:58] So, if you two hour flight six times a year, all right?

[02:00] This is there in back, which is four hours,

[02:02] four hours of flying six times a year total, just 24 hours.

[02:06] All right?

[02:08] It's 24 hours.

[02:09] The reason I'm defining this by hours is

[02:10] because private jets get price per hour.

[02:13] And if you carry as much as costs,

[02:15] if you go through a service,

[02:17] you can usually get it from about $4,000 an hour, okay?

[02:19] So, people don't know this.

[02:21] That's how much it costs, all right?

[02:22] So, that's about $100,000 a year.

[02:25] Wait, flying private to $100,000 a year,

[02:28] I thought it was, you had to be a super duper millionaire.

[02:31] Now, not really.

[02:32] It's a hundred grand a year.

[02:33] Now, do I think that's really expensive for flights?

[02:35] When the alternative to that is for six flights could be,

[02:40] maybe, if you did first class,

[02:42] you'd be maybe spending six grand, you know?

[02:45] At worst, if you did it last minute,

[02:47] you'd spend like 10 grand.

[02:48] So, 10 times the price for an alternative?

[02:51] Well, that's the alternative price.

[02:53] All right, consider it.

[02:55] The next one, exotic cars, all right?

[02:57] So, I'll give you a range here,

[02:58] but you can pretty much get a really nice car

[03:00] for $1,000 a month, like a very, very, very nice car.

[03:04] If you want like a Rolls Royce,

[03:06] you know, one of the most expensive cars,

[03:08] and you were, and you were leasing it,

[03:11] you would spend, you know, $4,500 a month, you know,

[03:13] $4,500 a month, all right?

[03:15] So, it's $4,000 a month,

[03:18] which is about 50,000 a year, all right?

[03:23] All right, next one.

[03:24] Pen House.

[03:25] So, if you, this kind of depends on,

[03:27] like, unless you're in a major city,

[03:28] but if you're not in a major city,

[03:29] which is what most of the IG influencers

[03:32] will try to influence you with,

[03:34] you can get a really nice place for $5,000 a month.

[03:38] In just about every market that's not New York, you know,

[03:41] LA, you know, it's like, maybe Miami,

[03:44] and sometimes even the nice place of Miami

[03:45] is like 10 grand a month, right?

[03:47] But, you know, let's level up, let's live a little bit.

[03:50] So, we'll say 10,000 a month, all right?

[03:52] Really, really, really, really nice place.

[03:54] All right?

[03:55] That's 120K a year, all right?

[03:58] And then, finally, expensive clothes, believe it or not,

[04:00] or some of the cheapest things that are out there,

[04:02] because I mean, you buy your Gucci belt,

[04:05] which is 500 bucks, you buy your Gucci shoes,

[04:08] which are another 600 bucks.

[04:10] And then, you know, you want to buy the handful $100

[04:13] to your shirt, okay?

[04:14] So, I mean, you spend in what?

[04:16] Like, $3,000 a year, you know, on clothes,

[04:19] which is not nearly as much as you think, right?

[04:22] And then, fancy restaurants,

[04:25] let's say you go out to date night once a week,

[04:27] and you drop $400 on a really nice dinner,

[04:30] really, really nice dinner.

[04:31] I'm trying, we're living it up here, right?

[04:33] So, it's 1600 bucks a month, times 12.

[04:37] I don't wanna do the math there, let's say it's 20K, all right?

[04:40] So, this lifestyle, and this is the,

[04:42] this is the, I mean, we're talking,

[04:44] the ultra, ultra, ultra wealthy lifestyle.

[04:46] This isn't just like, oh, I'm a millionaire,

[04:49] this is like, I'm a super duper wealthy person, right?

[04:51] I mean, look at all this stuff.

[04:52] We've got Lamborghini's pen houses,

[04:55] we're only wearing, you know, designer clothes,

[04:57] we've, we travel with private jets,

[04:59] we go to fancy restaurants, we do all of that stuff.

[05:02] How much does it actually cost, right?

[05:04] They cost $100, 150, 270, about 300 grand a year, right?

[05:14] 300 grand a year.

[05:17] So, that's, that's it, that's the dream number,

[05:22] and I have so many people who are like,

[05:23] I need to make a zillion dollars, right?

[05:27] Well, after taxes, you need to make 300 grand.

[05:30] So, you're looking at 500-ish thousand a year,

[05:34] 550 is what you need to make.

[05:35] And that is a top, that's top one percent,

[05:38] but this is so stupid.

[05:40] I mean, as someone who literally has done all of these things,

[05:45] let me give you some insight into some of the stuff

[05:48] that I've discovered.

[05:49] One, flying private is actually really nice.

[05:53] But it's wildly expensive,

[05:55] and I still feel guilty for it.

[05:57] Exotic car, definitely not worth it.

[06:00] I have two, and like, they're so not worth it at all.

[06:05] Like seriously, not worth it at all.

[06:07] The incremental enjoyment that I get compared to

[06:09] driving like an old Prius or pickup truck

[06:12] is inconsequential.

[06:14] If anything, you get used to it within like a week or two.

[06:17] And honestly, the only reason I got this

[06:19] is because I was on a podcast with Bradley,

[06:21] if you guys know him.

[06:22] And he was like, dude, you're so cheap.

[06:24] He's like, just go, you know, like,

[06:26] just get the car because my wife and I split a car

[06:28] until not that long ago.

[06:30] And he was like, dude, you make so much money.

[06:32] Just go get the darn car.

[06:33] So I was like, all right, I won't be a cheap ass.

[06:35] And so I got the car, and now I totally regret it.

[06:38] But, you know, it is what it is.

[06:40] So hopefully you can learn from that mistake.

[06:42] Depping said, what I'm gonna do is also

[06:44] I'll walk through percentage of income.

[06:46] Like, for perspective, if I can do this,

[06:49] all of this stuff off of one week's income,

[06:52] what do you do the next week, right?

[06:54] And so that's why I increase income is so important

[06:56] because all of this stuff's actually really easy to achieve.

[07:00] And so that's why I don't think you should be like,

[07:02] taking huge advice from people.

[07:04] Because getting a business to do, you know,

[07:07] $80,000 a month and you know, taking home 40,

[07:10] pretty much just afford you this life.

[07:11] So that's it.

[07:12] Now mind you, not get private jet flying

[07:14] and, you know, make a reasonable pen house

[07:18] instead of a $10,000 month pen house,

[07:19] which is a really nice place, right?

[07:22] Then just like that, we took out half the cost

[07:25] of this life style.

[07:26] So now we're down to 150,000, right?

[07:29] It's like, okay, well then I could still look like

[07:31] a super, and if still have my exotic car,

[07:33] still have expensive clothes, still eat a fancy restaurants.

[07:35] And that's on 150,000 a year, right?

[07:38] And so my biggest takeaways here

[07:41] are that I hope people take away is like,

[07:45] the people who have the most money,

[07:47] honestly, all of this stuff is a very,

[07:48] very small percentage of their income.

[07:50] And so don't let this be the reason

[07:53] that you listen to someone because there are people

[07:55] who live like this and that's 100% of their income.

[07:58] And those are people you should not listen to

[08:00] for advice on money, right?

[08:02] Like in my opinion, the only reason you should ever

[08:05] get to this part is when you're, you know,

[08:07] you're living up, this is less than 10% of what you make.

[08:11] That's my, that's my opinion, less than 10%

[08:13] of what you make, you save 90%.

[08:15] All right?

[08:16] And so overall, that's my, that's my big messages

[08:20] that I have done all of these things.

[08:22] I am not currently wearing fancy clothes,

[08:24] I'm wearing jean shorts and a t-shirt that might

[08:27] aren't gave me for Christmas.

[08:30] Fancy restaurants, this is something that I do with Laila

[08:32] and I actually feel like I get a good return on our date night

[08:37] but not on the fact that it's a fancy restaurant.

[08:39] I enjoy Applebees, GC Factory, BJs and chilies

[08:44] and Chipotle honestly just as much as I enjoy

[08:47] the fancy restaurant.

[08:48] I think the value of the fancy restaurant

[08:49] is that you dress up more so than the actual food

[08:52] and experience.

[08:52] And I've had the $500 stakes and all that stuff

[08:55] and honestly like a really good double-meach

[08:57] pola ball, hard to beat.

[08:59] Fahidas and chips that chilies, hard to beat.

[09:02] Cheesecifactory cheesecake, hard to beat.

[09:04] Puzokia BJs, no one has anything on their desserts, right?

[09:07] And so what's interesting is that having

[09:10] now done these exotic things,

[09:11] especially like cars and experiences,

[09:15] you'd be surprised that a lot of times I think

[09:17] the best quality having now tasted all of these things,

[09:21] the best quality comes from the stuff

[09:22] that tends to be the biggest mass market

[09:24] because they do the most product testing.

[09:25] And so recently I rented a,

[09:27] I think I rented a Chevy Suburban

[09:29] we were traveling somewhere.

[09:31] And the interface was so much easier to deal with

[09:34] than my Bentley's interface.

[09:36] It was so simple.

[09:37] I plugged my phone in, it worked automatically.

[09:39] It was just like, it was such a dream

[09:41] compared to this thing that's 350,000 or car

[09:44] because they only make a handful of them.

[09:46] So they don't have nearly the product testing

[09:49] and they put all these gizmos in it

[09:50] that are impossible to figure out how to use.

[09:52] And so don't be persuaded by this stuff, right?

[09:57] Try, this is just my two cents.

[09:58] You can take whatever you want from it.

[10:00] But this has just been my experience

[10:01] with all of these things.

[10:03] Restaurants, I like that the cheaper ones better,

[10:06] expensive clothes, I get nothing from.

[10:09] So personally, I think I have some shirts that are awesome,

[10:12] but the mass majority of them are less than $30.

[10:15] The penthouse thing, I don't think you should spend

[10:18] a lot of money on where you live personally.

[10:20] I think if you look at your primary residence

[10:22] as an investment, if you can,

[10:24] and live in something that would be an investment income type

[10:27] property, then I think it makes sense.

[10:29] Like the places that really makes sense is like,

[10:30] if you can live in a duplex and run out the other spot,

[10:32] you live for free and you're appreciating the assets

[10:35] you have, that stuff makes a lot of sense to me.

[10:37] And you have to pick, figure out what your trade-offs are.

[10:40] But if this is the absolute ultra wealthy lifestyle,

[10:45] do you know what ultra wealthy is?

[10:48] Because I'll tell you what it is right now.

[10:49] It's 30 million or more, 30 million

[10:51] to a billion in investable assets.

[10:53] Well, if you have $30 million in investable assets,

[10:56] that's the bottom range of alternate high net worth,

[11:00] then if you're gaining even 10% a year,

[11:02] you're making 3 million a year on your money,

[11:05] just your money-making money.

[11:06] And so just your passive income is 10 times greater

[11:11] than what it costs to live this way.

[11:13] And so in that instance, it kind of makes sense.

[11:15] It's like if you want to do it, do it.

[11:17] But I'll tell you this, of the people that I know

[11:19] were ultra wealthy, not kind of wealthy,

[11:22] not high net worth, which is 5 to 30,

[11:24] or just or a millionaire, which is 1 to 5.

[11:28] The people who have that stuff, who are the highest

[11:31] that I know, almost all of them,

[11:33] I've had these conversations with them,

[11:34] have come to the same conclusion,

[11:35] which is almost none of this stuff is worth it.

[11:38] And so you get there, you try the fruit,

[11:40] and you realize this is just not worth it.

[11:42] So if I can hopefully save somebody a couple of hundred grand,

[11:44] who does get there, then try and avoid this stuff,

[11:48] that's my two cents.

[11:49] So that's what I have for you.

[11:50] If you've never experienced this stuff,

[11:51] or you don't know how much it costs,

[11:53] this is how much this stuff costs in the real world,

[11:55] I do think you should spend less than,

[11:57] if you can, less than 10% of what you make,

[12:00] because if you can spend less than 10% of what you make,

[12:03] then it means that honestly within two to five years,

[12:05] you can live completely free of anything,

[12:08] because your wealth is a ratio between your expenses

[12:13] and your income, it is not a number.

[12:15] That's the thing everyone messes up.

[12:16] It's an expense, it's an ratio of income to expenses.

[12:19] That is what wealth is.

[12:20] And so if your income to expense ratio is 10 to one,

[12:24] you are very wealthy.

[12:25] So whether you live on $30,000 a year,

[12:27] and you make $300,000 a year,

[12:28] that is a very wealthy person.

[12:29] They're extremely, extremely well set up.

[12:32] They have no stress,

[12:33] because they have so much more than they need.

[12:36] And so that's what I think the key comes down to

[12:38] is having so much more than you need.

[12:41] And the happiness equation, if you guys don't know what it actually is,

[12:44] it's not when I get x, I will be happy,

[12:46] that's not the right one.

[12:48] The right one is halves over once.

[12:53] And if you can get your wants to zero,

[13:00] then it doesn't matter what you have on top,

[13:04] the equals infinity.

[13:05] And so as much as everyone likes to chase the top number,

[13:09] to compensate for the fact that they want these things,

[13:11] if you can simply decrease the desire,

[13:13] you will increase the abundance in your life.

[13:15] And by extension, you're income to expense ratio,

[13:18] which is what will build your wealth,

[13:19] and you'd be the freedom you want.

[13:20] So anyways, this has been a little experience of mine

[13:23] that I hope you find valuable,

[13:24] and hopefully you don't have to make

[13:26] some of these lovely mistakes that I have.

[13:28] Keeping on some lots of love, and I'll catch you guys soon.

[13:29] Bye!

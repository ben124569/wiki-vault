[00:00] Stop trying to get rich, get better.

[00:03] And if you get better, getting rich will happen as a consequence.

[00:07] Getting rich is an outcome, getting better is an input.

[00:09] Most entrepreneurs are focused on the output as the thing,

[00:12] and so they're scattered in terms of where their focus is,

[00:15] because they're just joined to do everything they can to drive this number up,

[00:17] rather than trying to do the thing that creates the wealth.

[00:20] I see a lot of small business owners circling around,

[00:24] asking the same question, which is figuring out how they're going to scale.

[00:28] And you're almost all doing it the wrong way.

[00:32] John Paul DeJurya said,

[00:33] you don't want to be in the selling business.

[00:35] And everything that I described at this point is very much the selling business.

[00:38] And so the only way that you can grow that business is selling more units is selling more customers.

[00:43] And that's a very terrible business to be in.

[00:45] And that's also the business that 95% of businesses are in.

[00:48] Is they're constantly struggling for leads.

[00:50] They constantly are trying to figure out where my next customer is coming from.

[00:53] And if this is you, then listen to what I am saying right now.

[00:56] If you are goal to grow your business, as you say,

[00:59] okay, I sell books.

[01:02] Great, I sell books.

[01:04] In order for me to grow my book business,

[01:06] I have to get more people to buy my book.

[01:09] And that's it, period.

[01:10] Well, if you do that,

[01:12] there's you literally just have to market

[01:15] and sell for the rest of your entire life.

[01:18] And the only way to grow your business is to advertise more.

[01:20] That's literally it.

[01:21] The only way to grow.

[01:23] And so unless you're supremely good at advertising,

[01:26] and you learn how to master affiliates.

[01:28] You learn how to master SEO.

[01:29] You learn how to master making content.

[01:30] You learn how to run pay debts.

[01:32] You learn how to do email.

[01:33] You learn how to do outbound.

[01:34] You learn how to do all these things so that you can maximize your sales.

[01:37] Unless you do that.

[01:39] And the thing is, is this is what sucks.

[01:40] Is that the next month,

[01:42] you have to reload all of your sales again.

[01:45] You have to start at zero again.

[01:48] And that sucks.

[01:50] And that's how the vast majority of businesses live.

[01:52] But the thing is, is it doesn't have to be that way.

[01:54] Because you have to look at the back of the business and say,

[01:56] why are there so many holes in my bucket?

[01:58] Because just pouring more water into the holy bucket.

[02:01] Like everyone understands this conceptually.

[02:04] But we don't act that way.

[02:06] And I say this from experience because in the earlier part of my career,

[02:08] I only chased revenue.

[02:09] And I chased profit.

[02:10] I just wanted to, I want to grow that all costs.

[02:13] But the thing is, is that sometimes the cost of that growth

[02:15] is the long-term growth of the business.

[02:17] And so it's like you sacrifice the long-term growth

[02:20] so that you can grow faster in the short term.

[02:23] And so big picture, what you want to do is figure out something

[02:28] that people don't stop buying.

[02:30] And I feel like I say this over and over again.

[02:32] But like no one does it.

[02:34] And so it doesn't have to be recurring business model.

[02:38] You just have something that people either tell their friends

[02:40] immediately about.

[02:41] So like in the book instance, we sell almost a million dollars a month

[02:44] in books.

[02:45] I don't advertise the books.

[02:47] And it's because people read it.

[02:49] And then they post about it.

[02:50] They tell their friends.

[02:50] And then other people buy the book.

[02:51] And that circle goes on.

[02:52] It's because we spent more time on the product.

[02:54] And it's the same with shop that's like I have to sell more customers

[02:57] into my same with shop.

[02:58] But their sandwiches are just mediocre.

[03:00] And so they're going to be stuck forever trying to figure out

[03:02] what the new hook is.

[03:03] And to be fair, I wrote a book on offers.

[03:05] And I think that's important when you're getting started.

[03:07] But long-term, the offer just gets them in the door.

[03:10] How well you deliver on the offer is what's going to keep them paying

[03:14] over and over again.

[03:14] It's going to get them to send referrals.

[03:16] I'll tell you a story.

[03:17] So I had a friend of mine started a cookie business.

[03:19] And when you started a cookie business,

[03:21] this is what he did.

[03:22] He went around the country to the top cookie stores and chefs

[03:26] or bakery chefs, I don't know what they're called, bakers.

[03:28] And he asked them if he could just hang out

[03:31] them and learn how they baked their cookies.

[03:32] And they were, you know, some of them said, you know,

[03:34] a pound sand, but some of them were like, sure, you can hang out.

[03:36] And so he learned what they did to baked cookies.

[03:38] And then when he came back home, he baked a new dozen cookies,

[03:42] every single day for a year.

[03:44] And he numbered all the batches.

[03:46] And he had 365 batches of cookies.

[03:49] And every time he did it, he gave it to Tasters.

[03:50] And then people would say, you know what?

[03:52] I like this.

[03:52] I don't like this, whatever.

[03:54] And so by the end of that time period, when he opened his restaurant,

[03:58] guess what also happened, the many people who had tasted his cookies,

[04:01] he got their numbers.

[04:01] He was giving free cookies away so that he could figure,

[04:03] and he also generated leads from his area.

[04:05] And then he opened and had a smashing success of a business,

[04:08] selling premium cookies in a local market,

[04:11] which is a tough business to be in.

[04:12] But he crushed it.

[04:13] And he did it because he spent 365 days doing the work

[04:18] to figure out the hundred tiny details that make a perfect cookie.

[04:22] And so like if you're in the sandwich business,

[04:24] if you're in the SEO business, if you're in the mechanic business,

[04:28] it's figuring out what we need to do to make the cookie that much better.

[04:32] And that's the work that no one's willing to do.

[04:33] And the good news is that's the opportunity.

[04:36] That's the opportunity that most people aren't willing to do.

[04:38] They're always like, if you ask small business owners,

[04:39] what do I need, they say I need more leads.

[04:41] They all say that.

[04:42] Now if everybody says they need the same thing,

[04:44] to me that's a big light bulb,

[04:46] that if they're all pursuing the same thing,

[04:47] and none of them are growing,

[04:48] then they're probably looking for the wrong stuff.

[04:50] And if you've been stuck at the same level for a long period of time,

[04:53] listen to what I'm saying right now.

[04:55] You have to find out why people aren't buying again.

[04:59] You have to find out why people aren't referring their friends.

[05:03] And sometimes you're like, well, when I ask them,

[05:05] they don't tell me.

[05:05] It's like sometimes you have to read between the lines.

[05:08] And that's the hard part.

[05:10] But that's the work.

[05:12] Like that's the work.

[05:13] And I get a little bit peaved about this,

[05:16] because I see so many small business owners that aren't growing,

[05:20] and they're not growing because they're always thinking about

[05:22] how they're going to get more leads,

[05:23] but they're not realizing the fact that they have to get more leads,

[05:26] because they have so many holes in their bucket.

[05:27] And so there is a level of advertising that you have to maintain

[05:31] in order to test my friend with the cookies

[05:34] or head to go out to people,

[05:35] and he had to get them to try the cookies.

[05:37] But the objective once he had his second batch of cookies

[05:40] wasn't like, oh, I need to give out 12 batches a day.

[05:43] No, that wasn't the goal at that point.

[05:45] The goal was to refine the product, refine the service,

[05:47] make it better, get the onboarding, the recruiting,

[05:50] the hiring, the training of the employees

[05:52] that they could deliver the service, good enough,

[05:54] so that when he scaled, the quality of the product

[05:57] remained the same.

[05:57] Or ideally, he had a process in place that he would improve over time.

[06:01] But people rush to scale because they have some sort of

[06:05] insecurity about, I have to make progress.

[06:07] But the thing is, not all progress is measured in revenue,

[06:09] immediately.

[06:10] Some progress happens at a delay.

[06:13] And so one of the biggest progress markers that

[06:15] happens at a delay is product.

[06:17] And so when we talk about delayed gratification,

[06:19] one of the ways that you can exercise that muscle

[06:21] of learning to delay reward for the work you do

[06:23] is improving the thing that you deliver.

[06:25] Because if you improve your sales,

[06:27] you're going to immediately see a jump.

[06:28] If you improve your lead, you'll immediately see a jump.

[06:30] And that's why it gets so addicting for small business owners,

[06:33] because they say, oh, look, I've proved this little sales thing

[06:35] and look for making more money.

[06:36] And yes, you are making more money.

[06:37] But the thing is, is that you're not going to make

[06:39] the big money.

[06:39] The monster money comes from the back end.

[06:41] The reason you can't afford your leads,

[06:43] there's never not enough leads.

[06:45] I want to impress this upon you.

[06:48] There is an unlimited amount of traffic in the world across all

[06:52] media.

[06:52] You've got radio, you've got newspaper, you've got direct mail,

[06:55] you've got, you've got, Instagram, you've got Facebook,

[06:57] you've got YouTube, you've got TikTok, you've got,

[06:59] you've got Spotify ads, right?

[07:01] You've got podcasts, you've got affiliates, you've got,

[07:03] there's SEO, there's so many different places where eyeballs are.

[07:07] The problem is not that you don't have enough leads.

[07:10] The problem is you can't afford them because you're products sucks.

[07:13] Like this is the problem.

[07:15] And so you have to build it back to front.

[07:18] You can consistently, you think about this from a competitive

[07:21] mode perspective.

[07:22] If you make the same amount of money per customer,

[07:25] as your competition, then you are always going to be in a race to the bottom.

[07:29] And when I say race to the bottom, I mean a race to the bottom of KAC.

[07:32] You want to, all you're going to be doing is trying to find little hacks

[07:35] to hack social media to hack ads, to do whatever.

[07:37] And those hacks are always short-lived.

[07:41] The biggest businesses, and I look at this a lot because

[07:43] I'm trying to think, okay, how is Alex going to get to a building?

[07:46] How is Alex going to get it to 10 billion?

[07:47] Is I look at the biggest companies?

[07:49] And the thing is is that have you noticed that the biggest companies

[07:52] aren't doing the Instagram hacks?

[07:54] Have you noticed they're not trying to do these little,

[07:56] like, oh yeah, if you put this hashtag at the bottom?

[07:58] Like, oh, if you do this little call out or the shout out,

[08:00] like if you noticed that they don't do that,

[08:04] and the reason they don't do that is because they don't have to,

[08:07] because they have won the long game, and the long game is the LTV game.

[08:11] It's how much is a customer worth to me?

[08:14] And so Dan Kennedy said this a long time

[08:15] because he can spend the most of the car customer wins.

[08:18] And I refrains that as he who can make his customers the most valuable wins.

[08:24] Because being able to spend the most is a product of how much you make a customer worth to you,

[08:29] which is a function of what the gross profit is and how many times they buy.

[08:33] And the how many times they buy function has a direct proportion to how good the quality of the product is.

[08:38] And by the way, when you improve the quality of your product,

[08:42] guess what happens? You get referrals. Now think about this.

[08:45] Oh, no, again, we have to play this out. Two, three steps.

[08:49] If you start marketing, let me tell you some truths that will not change.

[08:54] Advertising will always become more expensive.

[08:57] The cost for eyeball will always go up. You look at CPM's on Facebook.

[09:01] You'll look at CPM's on YouTube. The cost for eyeball was always go up on every platform.

[09:06] And as you scale, your advertising will go to colder and colder audiences.

[09:11] And it will become less and less efficient. This happens at scale.

[09:14] These are truths. These will not change. These are facts.

[09:18] And so if you want to scale a business, how can you scale if there are two things that are going in a

[09:23] linear direction against you? The cost of advertising to reach the eyeball goes up

[09:28] and the conversion percentage of the eyeballs also goes up. Because you go to a bigger

[09:32] bigger audience that knows less and less, they're less problem aware and you have less product

[09:35] to wear and you have to do more education upfront to a less interested audience. This happens.

[09:40] This is an inevitability. And so how do you combat that? One of the cool ways that you can

[09:45] increase LTV for almost any business is actually building a community around your business.

[09:50] And so I just became co-owner of school.com. And you can go there and we have facilitated and made

[09:57] super super easy getting a community built and monetized and thriving. And so whether you want to

[10:02] start a community business, which is, you know, one type person or you're already a business owner,

[10:06] it's a great way to increase the LTV of your customers, provide more value to them and have one

[10:10] place that you can always disseminate all your information, all your announcements to them,

[10:14] to continue to extend the LTV. And you can go to school.com, forward slash games or just school.com.

[10:20] And you can start full free. You combat that by having referrals and referrals come from every sale.

[10:28] And so if every sale, one, that person keeps buying and two, they send you another customer,

[10:32] guess what happens? That cat gets cut in half. And so you need an equally strong compounding

[10:37] vehicle that works in your favor to maintain your LTV to cat ratio. And so when you improve product,

[10:43] you also decrease cat via referrals at scale. So it doesn't matter how much scale you have,

[10:48] if you deliver an exceptional product, you will be able to have, you will always know that 1.3

[10:52] customers or every customer brings you, you know, whatever, 0.3 new customers on top that. So you

[10:57] decrease your cost to a car by 30%. And you get the LTV boost that happens in the back end as

[11:02] well, which is that they're buying more and they spend longer, they're willing to pay a premium.

[11:07] And so forth. And the third, third wheel of that in terms of product is that product is the end

[11:12] of the brand cycle. So if you think about brand is a reinforcing loop, right? In the beginning,

[11:17] when you start a company, you make a promise. Fundamentally, that's how you enter a marketplace.

[11:21] You say, I'm going to solve this problem. That is my promise to you. All right? And anyone can say that.

[11:25] What builds the business over the long term is your ability to deliver on that promise.

[11:30] Otherwise, it's the same reason you sell these fucking internet marketers who's changed,

[11:33] who started new, a new business every six months. And the new business is there like,

[11:37] I got to find the next offer because they're so front end obsessed because they never figured

[11:41] it was wrong your first offer. People bought it. The promise you couldn't deliver on it.

[11:46] And so just little Vegas warning sign, by the way, if you see the same guy changing up his offer

[11:52] every six months is because he doesn't know how to keep his promises. He lacks the skill of product.

[11:58] He lacks the skill of delivery. He lacks the skill of being able to recruit higher manage a team

[12:04] that can deliver consistently. He lacks that skill. And so honestly, what happens to that person?

[12:08] Over time, their reputation gets degraded. You start saying this guy's a, a hat, a husband. He's

[12:14] washed up. All he does is promote new stuff. He's a shell. He just sells whatever is hot.

[12:20] And many of you are that person.

[12:26] That you keep trying to find new ways to get leads when you just can't keep your promises.

[12:31] If you keep your promises and you put all your focus there, your cat will go down and we'll continue

[12:36] to go down. And that's what's crazy is that the more you do that, the more you reinforce the brand

[12:42] loop because you make a promise, you keep that promise. And then the people you keep the promise to tell

[12:46] other people you kept the promise. And then that decreases your cat. The inverse of that. And this is

[12:51] there's a there's a quantitative test for this. If you run advertisements and your cost to a

[12:58] choir customer increases at a faster rate than the average cost of CPM's, the cost for impression

[13:05] in your market, then it means you have word of mouth working against you. Think about this.

[13:13] Everyone understands positive word of mouth. We all get that right? We're like, oh yeah,

[13:17] get referrals. Did you know that you have far more negative referrals? You have way more detractors.

[13:22] You have way more people that when they see an ad of your business, what do they do? They reach

[13:26] out to other people to ask about you. And then people who would have purchased choose not to

[13:32] based on information they get online or asking someone they know. And so your conversion rate

[13:39] decreases every time. You complain that ads are working. When in reality, all of this is the

[13:43] invisible hand of your product sucking. I get passionate about this because I just I see it so many

[13:49] times. And it's the thing that that keeps you stuck. And so the only way to combat this is to become

[13:55] a world-class marketer and just only know how to sell shit. And hey, if you're selling to a really

[14:02] big market, I'm be honest with you. There's a lot of really big name marketers that the only

[14:06] reason they make money is because they sell to the ocean of humanity and they only need one

[14:11] transaction. And they spend all of their trying time trying to arbitrage media. As in, they know

[14:17] what their cost from precious is, they know how to say, and they just jam as much as they can in there.

[14:21] But that's not a business. That is a cash flow job that you get really good at with that skill.

[14:27] But that's also why marketers have terrible revutations. Building a brand is, in my opinion, the

[14:32] good side of marketing. And the brand is simply the associations that people have with your product.

[14:38] And if those associations are positive, then you build that reputation. You build that positive

[14:43] association and that takes time. But if you make the brand your end goal, then you will be able to

[14:52] charge higher prices than other people for the exact same thing and people will purchase from you

[14:57] because from a value equation perspective, they're perceived likely the achievement goes up.

[15:02] They're risk associated with the purchase in terms of what they believe they're ease and

[15:05] the ease of achieving what they're going to get goes up. And even if your time delay is slower,

[15:11] they have so much conviction that you're going to deliver on your promise that they're willing to pay

[15:15] the premium. And so your cost to a car customers goes down at scale. Brand driven advertising is

[15:23] more profitable than the pure scammy direct response stuff. It just takes longer.

[15:32] But the row as is insane. It's not like two x 3x. It's like 30, 100x. It's way bigger. And that's how

[15:39] companies like Apple print money. They print money. Look at their marketing spend. They print money.

[15:45] Because they have a line of customers that bought their last product. And just by knowing that they

[15:50] have a good reputation of delivering on their promises, they buy the next one. And so I'll tell

[15:55] you a story that happened for one of the probably the first time I really saw this was when I was,

[16:01] I was probably a year into Jim launch. We're ripping and roaring in terms of scale and everyone's

[16:06] just printing money using the system that we had. And I launched something called, I think I

[16:12] called an LNS at the time, which was like lead nurture system. It's something like that. I can't

[16:15] remember what I would call it. But basically it was we know, A LNS. It was automated leaner. That's

[16:19] what it was. A LNS. And so I did this big webinar. I did this big launch. And because Jim owners are

[16:24] business owners, there was a number of them that couldn't make it on the live. But they heard that I

[16:28] had sold this thing. The amount of people that reached out after the webinar, not having seen the

[16:36] webinar and said, hey, here's my credit card number. Whatever it is, just give it to me. I, if he launched

[16:40] it, I know it's good. I had never had that happen in my life. And I was like, how do I never stop this

[16:46] from happening? Again, I want this to always be my norm. And it reinforced so strongly how important it

[16:53] was to keep your promises. And so there's a relationship that I think is missed a lot, especially

[17:00] in the info and online space. And I want to hit on this. But it applies to all businesses.

[17:04] Is that there's three lines that you have to keep in touch with. You have the price that you charge

[17:10] you have the value that they get. And then you have the cost associated with delivering the thing.

[17:16] And so you want these lines to be as far apart as you'm only possible. All of them. You want them to be

[17:22] spread out super, super far. You want to have crazy high value at the top. You want a price that's

[17:28] a premium. And then you want to have a lot of juice left over relative to your cost.

[17:34] And the way to get that kind of space between your cost and your price is to do the work of the

[17:39] hundred details that your competitors aren't willing to do. They're not willing to find out that

[17:44] when someone walks in the restaurant, if we just we find out what their name is at the car, we can

[17:48] agree to my name. Small thing. Right. And we have the waitresses all right down on the receipt,

[17:55] what their name is and say, thanks for coming in. Ow. Whatever. Right. And we try to make sure that they

[18:02] all get their waters within 30 seconds of sitting down. We make sure that they get their bread within

[18:07] two minutes. We make sure that we check in every five or every tenor, whatever we've tested

[18:12] has been the right amount. And maybe it maybe comes down to asking the customer and front.

[18:16] Hey, is this something you want to like, Joe, I'm going to come like, this is a fast dinner or

[18:20] is this something you want to kind of like juice and enjoy? I will match your cadence. Maybe simply

[18:24] asking the question draws attention to the fact that you care. It might not even matter what you do,

[18:28] but maybe simply asking the question and proof their experience. And so it's these hundred

[18:32] BB's, no silver bullets that the good news is that your competition is laziness, fuck. It's so

[18:38] easy. Think about how many business like I do business with a lot of businesses on a personal

[18:42] level on a business level. I would not recommend most of them. And the thing is is that those

[18:47] vendors think that I'm an amazing customer. I'm a hair away from being a detractor. And many of

[18:53] you have customers that are a hair away from a truck. Sometimes you got customers who pay for your

[18:57] thing and still tell people not to buy it. My pool guy, when I had a pool, I don't have a

[19:02] pool anymore. When I had a pool, that guy was so inconsistent. He didn't clean stuff all the time.

[19:08] I'd walk out after his bill. What did he even do anything this week? Right? But I still

[19:13] pick because it was just such a hassle to change. But I was absolutely detractor when my

[19:17] neighbors are like, oh yeah, who's your pulsars? Like, don't use my guy. I just don't have time to

[19:21] find somebody else. They're like, oh, thanks. And that's my business owner is like, man, I've such a

[19:26] great business. And like, we'd have Jim owners who thought that their their gyms were hot shit.

[19:34] And then somebody opens up across the street and literally takes all their customers. When they

[19:37] didn't realize it's the main reason people wanted their gym is it was just convenient.

[19:42] They thought all of their work out. They thought all of their music. They thought they thought the

[19:47] layout of the gym, the equipment. They thought all that was important. But the thing that

[19:50] matter most was that you just happen to be the only gym in a five mile radius of this spot.

[19:57] And so a lot of times the thing that the reason that you're winning, you don't even know why you're winning.

[20:03] And so professional professor Bergman from Stanford said this, he said, it's better

[20:08] to know why you have failed than to succeed and not know why. And I always, I think that's a very

[20:13] profound statement because for us as business owners, we're always willing to attribute negative

[20:18] things to outside forces. Right? We're always willing to say, oh, you know, COVID happened. My business

[20:24] got hurt or whatever, right? The economy's bad. Credit rates are compressing.

[20:29] But we aren't willing to give outside forces the credit for when we do well. We're like, oh,

[20:33] no, that was me. That was that marketing initiative. Oh, yeah, that's because we've been really

[20:36] working on the team. It might just be nothing to do with you at all. And so understanding what are the

[20:40] drivers that actually drove the success are some of the things that you have to find out that your

[20:44] competition doesn't know. So many business owners just believe in mythology. They just they just

[20:50] make up narratives around why they're successful and they have no way to prove it. One of the

[20:54] things that I see people just melt in front of me when I ask they're like, well, this is, you know,

[20:58] they basically tell me a story about their business. They say, well, people don't do that because

[21:03] and then they insert some make believe thing. And I say, how do you know that? And then they just

[21:09] look at me like, how do you know that? They don't. They've never measured it. I had a vendor recently

[21:17] who was like, hey, we need to do this, this and this with something on media. And I was like, okay,

[21:22] why? He was like, well, this is going to create more growth. And I said, how do you know that?

[21:28] And then he gave me another step. And that's that was derived from the first step that he said

[21:32] do increase. He said, when this increases, this increases. I was like, no, shit, do you know how math works?

[21:37] Of course, of course it does. Now, to be clear, I don't think this is out of malice, to be very

[21:42] clear. But no one thinks. And the good news is your competition doesn't think either.

[21:50] And so if you want to win, you just need to stop like whenever someone gives you a

[21:54] bekastate in your team, just ignore it. And if they do give it to you and you insist on trying to

[22:00] listen to it, then say, how do you know that? And most of that, well, you know, gut feeling like,

[22:05] oh, your gut feelings mean nothing to me. If you haven't tracked it and you have no data to support

[22:10] it, then you, I can make up things too. When you hear podcasts of of of business people,

[22:16] and they're telling you the things that work for them, the crazy thing is that most of the time,

[22:20] they don't know either. And so this is what drives me nuts. People are like, hey, Alex, do you think

[22:27] that you know, having a hard childhood, even having a troubled relationship with your father,

[22:31] I don't, we're fine, right? But do you think that is the reason that you're so driven? And like,

[22:37] I don't know, how would I know? I know that I am driven. There's a zillion things that have

[22:44] happened to me in my life. I don't know which one it is, but we create these narratives around it to

[22:47] believe it. And I'm bringing this kind of conceptual idea because right now, many of you are creating

[22:53] stories that you tell yourselves to make yourself feel better about why your product isn't as good

[22:59] as it should be, but you have an excuse that only you need to believe. And you believe that

[23:03] excuse, so it excuses you from working harder on the stuff you know you should be doing, but aren't.

[23:08] And that, that work, the work you know you should be doing, but aren't, is the opportunity,

[23:13] because that is the work that your competitors also aren't doing. And I'm telling you from the

[23:18] bottom of my soul, it is so easy to beat people today. They are so soft, they have no work ethic,

[23:25] no one gets stick with anything, everyone is distracted, they're a social media, they're kind of

[23:28] in their fucking notifications, because they can't stick with shit, they can't say no. And so

[23:34] sometimes you got to say, hey guys, we're going to stay at this revenue level until we get referrals

[23:38] over 30%. We're going to stay at this revenue level, we're going to stay at this level of

[23:43] advertising, I don't want anyone else to know how mediocre our sandwiches are. Why would I tell anyone

[23:48] else? I don't want anyone to know. If I could test this with no one knowing, I would do it,

[23:52] but we have to advertise a little bit so we can fix our thing. But the point of that first phase

[23:58] of growing the business, because you start making sales is to get better, not to get rich.

[24:04] The point in the first phase is to learn, not to earn. If I started a new cleaning business tomorrow,

[24:10] the first year would just be trying to nail the model. I would mean, I would mean thinking about

[24:14] what we're growing every time. I wouldn't care. I would only be focused on how could I make this

[24:19] experience so that no one leaves. And that's all my obsession is because I know that once that happens,

[24:24] whether you sell one customer a month or five customers a month or ten customers a month,

[24:28] your business will not stop growing. If you do not lose customers, your business will not stop

[24:36] growing. And so while every one of your competitors are looking for cheaper leads and trying to find

[24:40] the new place where they can do their little hacky Instagram thing, you can sleep well at night

[24:44] knowing, I sold ten customers last month. And this month I'll sell another 10, but I'll have 20.

[24:50] And the month after that, I'll sell 10 and I'll have 30. And the month after that, I'll send 10

[24:54] and I'll have 40. And we will just keep fucking growing because I spent a year or two years or five

[25:01] years figuring out exactly what to do that delivered for my customer. And that is the work that

[25:07] no one will do. And that is why entrepreneurship is much more a battle of wills than it is a battle of

[25:14] intellect. You have to be willing to delay gratification for an extended period of time and eat

[25:19] glass and that eating of glass is seeing how many failures you have until you get it right.

[25:24] And this is the difference between small businesses and big businesses. Is there willingness

[25:27] to put up with that long period of time of getting the product right? And then once you get it right,

[25:34] you can scale to the moon because you will make more than everyone else on your back end.

[25:37] You will deliver on your promises. Your brand will be reinforced with every sale rather than

[25:41] degraded with every sale. And then at scale, you will continue to be able to acquire customers

[25:45] profitably because you have a force that is compounding, which is the referral base of customers

[25:50] that tells other people how good your stuff is. While also continuing to purchase themselves.

[25:55] So it's still a convali they have a saying which is break, break things move fast. I think that was

[26:00] one of Facebook's early values. That break fast and move stuff is building back to front.

[26:05] That is building the product through iteration so that you can have extended LTV so that you

[26:09] can have the activation of users so that because fundamentally think about this way.

[26:12] If Facebook did not get users activated and they were like we need to spend more on marketing so

[26:16] we can get more users it would never work at scale. It has to have a compounding vehicle built

[26:21] within the business. And the compounding vehicle in the business for most businesses is the quality

[26:25] of their product. That is the compounding vehicle. You have to get people to continue to buy

[26:30] or continue to use in Facebook's case. And so they have to think about how can we eliminate

[26:34] friction in a hundred different ways so that we can make it smoother. I mean this is what we work on at

[26:38] school all the time. It's how can you make this easier? How can we make this faster? How can we

[26:40] make these more streamlined so that anybody can be successful with it? In most small business owners

[26:44] fix one or two things and then they immediately want to scale, they want to gas the advertising

[26:48] to make more sales and the problem with that is that it does this. So you increase sales and so by

[26:53] percentage growth it will be really aggressive and starts slowing down and you can always tell

[26:57] growth of businesses like this especially at the $10-300 million mark and they're not even close to

[27:01] their total dressable market because the only way they grew is through jamming sales and marketing

[27:05] not through having a product that compounded. And so that is the big difference between

[27:09] massive multiples and companies when you suffer 20x 50x massive numbers because the person who's

[27:15] acquiring it has no doubt that that business will continue to compound and grow. If the business

[27:18] is purely based on marketing sales then they know that it's only as good as this last month

[27:22] and if the marketing director leaves or their sales channel gets shut down then the business

[27:25] is going to rapidly decline and so not only does it make the company significantly more valuable

[27:29] it also makes life a lot more chill as an entrepreneur because you know that this month

[27:34] like last month like two years ago the customer he bought there you sold two years ago put

[27:37] that up all that effort in they're still buying today improving your product is the highest

[27:41] leverage thing you can do because every single person gets that product and so you work when

[27:46] at one time and then it's you know cut cut once sell 100 times cut once sell 1000 times

[27:53] whereas marketing is a is a linear relationship you have to go market more to get more customers

[27:57] but if you continue to improve the product that thing can get you 100 times more customers or

[28:02] massively increase LTV and so you get a disproportionate return on the effort you put in on

[28:06] making your thing better than you do on getting more customers. Chunking up what we're tracking

[28:10] with product is the price that we're able to command for our services or our product the number

[28:17] of recurring purchases that we have from somebody so if you have a reoccurring business it's

[28:21] average number of orders that someone's going to make with your business over a lifetime

[28:25] or it's the churn associated with your subscription or membership and so these give you the quantitative

[28:29] outputs of a high quality product but the inputs are going to be closer to what are their

[28:34] activation metrics like what is and the way that you look at this is you do something called a

[28:38] regression analysis around okay let's look at the cohort of customers that don't cancel because

[28:42] there is hopefully some customers that don't leave you and you look at what things occurred in

[28:47] and you have to look at a lot of variables of what things occurred in those customers that haven't

[28:53] occurred in other customers and then once you find those things that occurred those become

[28:57] activation points or at least your first guess at activation points and then what you do is you

[29:00] drive your onboarding towards that activation point some people got a retention point and then you

[29:05] re-measure again and so if you know that once people you know achieve a sale from SEO for your agency

[29:11] that the likely the cancel goes down precipitously then all of your effort for onboarding is how

[29:15] quickly can we get them a sale from our SEO if it's for weight loss you find out that

[29:19] somebody needs to lose seven pounds the first two weeks if they lose the weight then the likely

[29:22] they continue to stay as very high so then you drive all of your activation your onboarding

[29:26] towards getting to that point and so everything is about looking at the people at the end

[29:31] looking the thing that preceded them getting to that point and then putting all of your focus on

[29:35] getting people to have that experience at the most basic level I had a first book and many people

[29:41] who bought this book and liked it but the second book when it came out obviously we had a launch

[29:47] but the thing is is that we still sell thousands and thousands and thousands of copies of this book

[29:52] every single month and even though this book is two and a half or three years old or whatever it is

[29:57] this book still sells thousands and thousands and thousands of copies every month because there's

[30:01] also new people every month that are getting into entrepreneurship or want to learn about

[30:05] making better offers for their business and so the people who upsold between product one and

[30:09] product two many of them saw nothing besides the fact that they found out that I had another book

[30:14] out and then bought it and I don't say that in a self-aggrandizing way I say that because like

[30:18] I've lived the other way and it's much better to do it this way and if you're trying to increase

[30:23] LTV to have a compounding business model then one of the first things you need to do is do the

[30:27] unscale while I made an entire video about it go check it out it'll probably help you out

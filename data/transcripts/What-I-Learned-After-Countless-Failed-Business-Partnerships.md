[00:00] Welcome to the call today.

[00:01] I want to open the floor up to ask you guys,

[00:06] because I'm sure because it's been 30 days since last time we spoke.

[00:09] So if you guys have questions in the chat,

[00:11] burning things, decisions that are impending,

[00:14] things you're unsure about, strategies that you need to validate

[00:16] or even just a verbal high five, please put in the chat

[00:19] and then I'll go and go from top to bottom, Jason,

[00:24] bring you on a business partner.

[00:26] Don't do it and go ahead.

[00:28] So I've had this business for over a decade.

[00:33] And Lee Jen's just, it's always been my weakest function.

[00:37] And I'm more...

[00:39] I thought it was your quick.

[00:40] What's that?

[00:41] Can I pause your real quick on that one point?

[00:43] How many hours a day do you spend working on Lee Jen?

[00:47] Not a lot, because I get to cut up another stuff.

[00:50] Yeah, so...

[00:52] So you're thinking about doing a partnership with Kyle

[00:54] and you're making the inspiration,

[00:55] you want to know the decision process.

[00:57] So, right.

[00:59] Yeah, I mean, A, I want to know if it's a good idea,

[01:02] which I know there's risks involved.

[01:04] So then I'm like, what are the risks and what consideration?

[01:07] I'm meeting with Elizabeth Morgan this evening

[01:10] to bring up my concerns, but I wanted to get your feedback

[01:13] because you've probably seen a lot, you've been...

[01:15] I've had eight field partnerships,

[01:16] so I know nothing about this.

[01:18] Is you have to have read, like,

[01:20] talk about all the ugly shit first.

[01:22] Yeah.

[01:23] Right, so right now you guys are in lust, right?

[01:25] You guys are like, making out, getting, you know,

[01:26] having, having sales sex and just like,

[01:29] it's things are amazing.

[01:30] Right.

[01:31] You don't want to have the really ugly,

[01:32] like, how are we going to split up Alamone

[01:33] if we, you know, if we get divorced later,

[01:35] conversation with the public.

[01:36] Right.

[01:37] Exit strategy, all that.

[01:38] Yeah.

[01:39] So like, that's what has to get defined.

[01:41] And you now could define roles and responsibilities.

[01:44] The only reason to have a partners,

[01:45] if they have skills you do not have,

[01:48] or they have money you don't have,

[01:49] or they have time you don't have.

[01:51] If you're on the flip side, like,

[01:52] you have money and they have time.

[01:53] Right.

[01:54] So that's where, that's where partnerships are useful.

[01:58] The number one way most people do partnerships,

[01:59] that was like, hey, I'm cool, you're cool.

[02:01] We love the same thing.

[02:03] Let's go into business together,

[02:04] which is a terrible way to do a partnership.

[02:06] Because one of us is not necessarily, right?

[02:07] And you're saluting equity.

[02:09] Right.

[02:10] Are you looking or doing a true partnership?

[02:12] Are you looking or doing like a minority type deal?

[02:16] I would always maintain a majority

[02:18] and it would be a scaling, you know,

[02:21] my company's an S-Corp.

[02:22] So he would basically get a piece of the company

[02:25] as he helps me hit certain million dollar milestones

[02:28] at two the point of max maybe like a third of the company.

[02:32] Okay, well, that's different.

[02:34] That's more like a performance based relationship with

[02:37] the kickers.

[02:39] I would structure it as fan of equity.

[02:43] Which means what?

[02:45] So it's equity that doesn't actually bastant

[02:47] unless there's a sale.

[02:49] And if he were to leave, then he doesn't get the equity.

[02:53] And so you can pair those two things together

[02:55] so you can do like equity with profit sharing.

[02:57] And so that would be probably how I would structure it.

[03:02] Either profit share or a rev share,

[03:03] depending on how you negotiate it.

[03:06] Okay.

[03:11] But just as a side of everyone on here,

[03:13] like I remember I had a mental really early on.

[03:16] He's like, and I was taking on all these partners

[03:19] left and right because I didn't know what I was doing.

[03:20] And he's like, listen,

[03:22] you're gonna need an account.

[03:23] He's like, you just pay the account.

[03:26] He's like, he's not a partner in my business.

[03:28] He's like, I just ran a problem.

[03:29] So it's like, just because you have a need,

[03:31] doesn't mean they have to be equity owner.

[03:33] There's plenty of companies that are owned by people

[03:35] who are not lead generations specialists.

[03:39] So I think if it were me,

[03:41] I'd probably try and set up a really lucrative relationship

[03:44] that isn't necessarily a partnership.

[03:46] So it's like, it's pay per or a percentage of something

[03:51] something to that extent, right?

[03:54] I don't know if you're ever planning on selling

[03:55] because the only reason someone would ever want equity

[03:57] is if they want control or they want to be able

[04:00] to make money on an exit.

[04:01] So the only two reasons you want equity,

[04:02] otherwise equity sucks,

[04:04] because then you just have liability, which blows.

[04:07] So unless you want control, which I don't think he does,

[04:10] and unless you think you're gonna sell,

[04:11] which I don't think you are, or I don't think you want to,

[04:13] just you've been doing it for a decade,

[04:14] unless you're just sick and tired of it,

[04:16] but I don't get that impression.

[04:17] Wow.

[04:18] Right.

[04:19] So then the only thing that he should want,

[04:21] or that you should probably negotiate for us

[04:23] the stuff that he wants, which is a percentage of revenue,

[04:25] or percentage of profit, based on XYZ.

[04:28] So I think that's what you should,

[04:29] I don't think you need to make this an equity partnership at all.

[04:31] I think you just need it in agreement.

[04:34] Okay.

[04:37] Do you wanna say something?

[04:38] Yeah.

[04:39] You need an apartment agreement.

[04:41] This is like standard.

[04:42] There's tons of you commerce companies

[04:43] that they take 10% of top line from sales attributed

[04:46] to the marketing that they make, and they're full service.

[04:50] They don't have equity in the company,

[04:51] but they get a percentage of revenue.

[04:54] Mm, got it.

[04:56] Yeah, I guess I have to see our talk to Kyle and figure out

[05:01] like why I would equity matter to him,

[05:03] because-

[05:04] Yeah, I bet, just say what do you want?

[05:05] I said, or the or control, but-

[05:07] Right.

[05:08] Just ask, what do you want?

[05:10] You probably say I want to purchase me in the upside.

[05:12] Cool.

[05:12] What specifically?

[05:13] Because if it's sale, I'm not gonna sell.

[05:15] So what specifically?

[05:15] I want to piece of what I'm bringing it.

[05:17] Cool.

[05:18] So then let's do it based on,

[05:20] X or Y.

[05:21] For you, would be advantage to do profit share.

[05:23] For him, it'd be advantage to do revenue.

[05:25] So do you.

[05:28] Right.

[05:31] Okay, that makes sense.

[05:32] And the next question looks like it's relevant.

[05:34] Heeters.

[05:35] He deserves to exit.

[05:36] Yeah.

[05:37] Okay, so Peter, this is for you.

[05:39] How to prioritize the business partner

[05:40] and best practices go separate ways.

[05:42] So it depends on whether you have a kid or not, right?

[05:44] And how good looking a kid is and how much money

[05:46] the kid makes, right?

[05:47] And so you guys have a business.

[05:49] If the business isn't making a ton of money,

[05:51] then most of these times you can just be like,

[05:53] hey man, why don't we just both fuck off

[05:56] and go our separate ways?

[05:57] It's even worth the business isn't making any money

[05:59] and has the debt that needs to be paid off.

[06:04] So then you can just, I mean, then at that point,

[06:05] you should just split the debt.

[06:07] If you want to, if you like, you can split the debt

[06:10] or you can, is this an LLC that you are ending

[06:13] or is this in general?

[06:15] So the way the business is set up is it is an LLC.

[06:20] And then I have obviously my own agency.

[06:22] So the idea was to use my agency to generate sales

[06:26] to then pay the debt of the other LLC back.

[06:30] However, I'm responsible for the back end.

[06:33] He's responsible for the front end like the sales.

[06:36] Yeah.

[06:37] Last six months, he hasn't really brought in any sales.

[06:40] So now that I'm selling and doing everything,

[06:45] exactly, it becomes that point of like,

[06:48] okay, this debt is 50, 50.

[06:50] However, if I'm doing 100% of the work,

[06:53] why should I also pay 100% of the debt

[06:55] and fulfill the product and do everything else

[06:57] on the back end?

[06:58] Yeah.

[06:59] I mean, I figure out how to rip that bandaid off

[07:02] and say, you know,

[07:05] let's go.

[07:06] So the easiest way to have hard conversations

[07:08] is just ask the questions that you ask here.

[07:12] So like literally the biggest hack

[07:13] in all of relationships is the way that you talk shit

[07:15] about someone behind their back

[07:16] is literally where you should just tell them.

[07:18] So it's like, hey man,

[07:19] you said that you were gonna do all the sales

[07:21] and I was gonna do the back end.

[07:22] Well, you're not doing the sales,

[07:24] but we're still both responsible for this thing.

[07:26] So what do you think's fair?

[07:31] You'll have what you have in mind,

[07:32] but a lot of times people who once you present the information,

[07:35] like that'll be like, ah fuck you, right?

[07:38] And like, so what do you think's fair?

[07:40] It's like, well, you should just take the business

[07:41] and I guess I can try and start paying off my share over time.

[07:46] You're like, cool, that's what I was thinking to.

[07:49] Let's sign these, that way that, you know,

[07:50] the things dissolved and then you transfer your equity to me

[07:54] and you have a note back to me for 50% of the day.

[08:01] Then I sense, yeah.

[08:03] You can Google promissory note, template, one page.

[08:08] It just like, from bar were too lender, no interest,

[08:11] X amount by this paid by this state in this increment,

[08:15] like what happens if they default and that's it.

[08:20] Like it's a very simple.

[08:21] Like I've done $1 million on one page,

[08:24] like you're, they hold up.

[08:28] And you're in real estate,

[08:29] so you should find plenty of promissory notes that are simple.

[08:32] Yeah.

[08:33] Then I sense, so there's the equity.

[08:35] That's the worst investors are to our lenders, right?

[08:37] So I want to make sure, like,

[08:39] so this is the equity and the debt.

[08:41] So there's two pieces, right?

[08:42] The equity, you just say,

[08:43] hey, I own 100% of this company,

[08:46] you're giving your shares to me

[08:47] because you're not doing shit, right?

[08:49] That's number one.

[08:50] Or we dissolve the company,

[08:51] I create new entity, I'd prefer to say $300,

[08:53] that's up to you, right?

[08:54] With the thing is, you could do that right now.

[08:56] It doesn't like, and you could just say,

[08:57] like, I don't really give a shit,

[08:58] if you sign this and it saves me 300 bucks.

[09:00] Like, this is not really discussion

[09:01] because there's nothing here, right?

[09:03] The second piece is, okay, now let's,

[09:06] now that we've dealt with the equity piece,

[09:08] now let's do with the debt piece, right?

[09:10] And to the debt piece, this is what we both,

[09:12] this is what we agreed on, this is what I will do,

[09:14] and this is the primary thing that you can write,

[09:17] or we can both sign together towards the lenders.

[09:22] Okay, thanks, House, and then you're done.

[09:26] Yeah, and then as far as his involvement in my agency,

[09:28] just he can quote unquote,

[09:30] sell my product and earn a commission

[09:32] and do whatever he seems with it or not.

[09:36] Because that's the other tricky part,

[09:39] is he's also involved in my agency,

[09:42] but more so because he doesn't make any money.

[09:44] So it's not like he's in StarMaking Money, no.

[09:46] Yeah, okay, right?

[09:49] Yeah, that's kind of what I'm thinking as well.

[09:50] Yeah, it's like, let's assess about the fact that it's like,

[09:53] what if he gets rich from our products?

[09:54] He wasn't getting rich on your fucking product for the last two years.

[09:56] So I got nothing as a start now, I know what I mean.

[09:59] Yeah, no, my thing was like, I wanted,

[10:01] I wanted to pull some cells in for us

[10:04] to actually sell the product

[10:05] because then we would actually pay the other thing on that's fine.

[10:07] Then I would say, and on top of this,

[10:09] I'll still continue to give you the thing,

[10:11] you can still sell it and we split the revenue.

[10:14] Yeah, okay, cool.

[10:15] Cool.

[10:17] Sweet.

[00:00] My dad always told me that you only get one name,

[00:03] so invest in it accordingly.

[00:06] And I always thought about that.

[00:06] I thought it was a really good line.

[00:08] Just like you only get one name.

[00:09] Like you can change your companies.

[00:10] You can go bankrupt like your names,

[00:11] stays with you.

[00:12] And so that can either be an asset

[00:14] or it can be a liability.

[00:16] Well, I usually ask my guess, how did you get this job?

[00:19] So I was a management consultant right out of college.

[00:24] I did space cyber and intelligence for the military,

[00:28] which was sounds much cooler than I really was,

[00:30] but I had a top secret clearance.

[00:31] It sounded really good at dinner parties

[00:33] and just about only that.

[00:35] And one day I looked out for my balcony

[00:38] excited, really nice place,

[00:39] because I could afford it at the time.

[00:42] And I was like, is this it?

[00:43] And I was in my young 20s.

[00:45] At that point, I had done everything

[00:46] that I think I was supposed to do.

[00:47] So I was, I did well on school.

[00:49] I was present in all the clubs.

[00:52] Graduated in three years.

[00:53] Got the good job.

[00:54] And I realized that I was living a life for me.

[00:58] And that my father wanted me to live.

[00:59] And so that was kind of, I felt her back and forth

[01:03] for probably a period of six months.

[01:05] I've really not wanting this to be my life,

[01:07] but not wanting to let my dad down.

[01:09] And so at some point, the thing that kind of pushed me

[01:12] over the edge was I can either die to myself

[01:15] or I can die to my father and think of the day.

[01:18] I have to survive.

[01:19] So I will, if I make this decision and he no longer wants

[01:22] to be my dad, then I can accept that.

[01:24] Wow, was that extreme then?

[01:26] Yes.

[01:27] Same more about that.

[01:28] Are you an only child?

[01:29] Yeah.

[01:30] So only child race by a single father, Middle Eastern.

[01:34] He was born in Iran.

[01:35] And you know, everything in my life up until that point

[01:38] was really just a big him proud.

[01:39] So it was very much a seeking approval,

[01:42] seeking validation, kind of drive at that point in my life.

[01:44] And so the idea of disappointing him

[01:46] or not getting his approval felt like death.

[01:48] And at that point, I was actually contemplating, not living.

[01:51] You have watched some of my YouTube stuff.

[01:54] More tallity has been the single biggest driver

[01:57] and the biggest decisions that I've made in my life.

[01:59] And it has become a more routine process

[02:02] for decision making for me in general.

[02:04] Because I think it provides clarity

[02:06] and it provides context to most of the decisions we have,

[02:09] which the vast majority of them don't matter,

[02:11] which is helpful in and of themselves.

[02:13] And then, you know, beyond that, it helps me make the decisions

[02:16] that I think removes everyone else from the playbook.

[02:18] Because if you study, subject to well-being

[02:21] and how people perceive how they're doing in their own lives,

[02:24] it looks like a smiley face.

[02:25] So seven year olds think they're killing life.

[02:28] And then it drops dramatically between 20 and 30.

[02:32] And then there's still a little bit more of a dip right around

[02:34] 45.

[02:35] That's like when people are their truths, they hate life the most.

[02:39] And then it kind of slowly goes up to like 55, 60.

[02:42] And then it shoots right back up again

[02:44] when people see that they're going to die

[02:46] and that life is short

[02:47] and that they can make the decisions

[02:48] without worrying about the ramifications of other people

[02:50] and some of the people they're worried about are also dead.

[02:52] And so it was using that context for that biggest decision

[02:55] that's been duplicated many times in my life

[02:56] since then because if I have a good decision-making algorithm,

[02:59] I try and reuse it as many times as I can.

[03:01] Let's unpack it for the audience a little bit.

[03:03] So, you know, when we're seven, we don't have a care in the world.

[03:07] The artist or whatever we want to be

[03:09] has not been beaten out of us yet, no one's told us

[03:12] that we are not what we think we are.

[03:15] We're still popping wheelies and climate trees

[03:17] and falling out and that's okay.

[03:19] And then you get to your 20s and 30s

[03:21] and you rub your hits a road a little bit.

[03:23] And if you've made money I guess

[03:24] and if that's your sign of success then you're okay.

[03:27] But if not, you're kind of host.

[03:30] Then when you're 40s I'm guessing you start

[03:33] to have more life experience.

[03:36] 50s maybe you start carrying less what people think

[03:39] and then you fast forward all the way to maybe near death.

[03:45] And then you really get to a point

[03:47] where you don't care what anyone says

[03:48] and you really boil it down to what's important

[03:50] probably I'm guessing that's love relationships,

[03:54] legacy and then you're just like piece out.

[03:57] I think for most people yes.

[03:59] For me specifically the legacy piece less so

[04:02] but I think for most people yes.

[04:04] And why is the legacy piece less important?

[04:08] More so and whenever I get into this topic I think a lot

[04:12] like some people get sensitive about it

[04:13] and so I just like to put the disclaimer like this is not me.

[04:15] Judging or beliefs and me stating my beliefs is in no way.

[04:18] Yeah.

[04:19] Judgment on any wheels.

[04:20] But if you just look at expanding the time

[04:22] rising over a much longer period of time

[04:23] if you look at it in 10,000 years or 100,000 years

[04:26] or a million years, right?

[04:27] The easy way to test this is to go backwards, right?

[04:30] Which is do you know your great great

[04:32] great great great father?

[04:33] Probably not.

[04:33] And then if you look at it from a how much has somebody

[04:36] achieves standpoint I happen to be in an interesting

[04:39] situation where my great great grandfather was in the

[04:41] ruling class in Iran and you had 400 children.

[04:44] So he would literally you know like ruled and had a lot

[04:47] of wealth he had a lot of wives to create 400 children.

[04:50] Right?

[04:51] And I actually still can't remember his name

[04:53] because my dad told me one time and I can't remember it.

[04:55] And I've never seen any of the quote legacy

[04:57] that I'm sure he felt like he was leaving.

[04:59] And so if that was that level of success and legacy

[05:03] and only four or five generations later

[05:05] I don't even remember the man's name nor do I have any piece

[05:07] of that legacy.

[05:08] It seems a little bit irrelevant.

[05:11] When the revolution happened to Iran,

[05:14] we'd talk about legacy.

[05:16] Lands, buildings, houses, bank accounts.

[05:19] Everyone just says those are ours now.

[05:21] Is it?

[05:22] Is your legacy gone?

[05:24] That's why I'm like and if you were like I want to build a legacy

[05:27] I'm like you asked me not even be the super power 500 years.

[05:30] Your kids, your kids might be in Bangladesh,

[05:33] who knows, India might be the the hot spot 500.

[05:35] No one knows.

[05:36] And I think it'll long enough time rising.

[05:38] We're all screwed.

[05:38] And I think in some ways people find that incredibly

[05:40] disheartening but an equal opposite is you can't find it

[05:44] both disheartening and also not freeing

[05:46] because all of the decisions that we're making

[05:48] that are not for ourselves or what are subject to change

[05:53] that we feel pressure from whether that be society,

[05:56] societal up a quotes there because that's a big word.

[06:00] Or family friends, expectations that we perceive

[06:02] other people to have of us.

[06:05] If you can just relinquish all of those chains

[06:07] I think it's incredibly freeing.

[06:09] And I choose to live that way.

[06:12] That advice is good because it helps us live in the moment

[06:15] because even if you believe in something after

[06:19] that's still in the future.

[06:21] And there's a question mark because no one actually knows

[06:24] with knowledge what happens or if something happens.

[06:27] So you might as well live in the present, make the best of it.

[06:29] Yeah, an interesting one that I thought through around that

[06:32] was a lot of us, not a lot of us all of us,

[06:36] have 100% experience not being alive.

[06:40] Before we were born, we were not alive.

[06:41] And so we know what that was like, there was nothing

[06:44] that we can recollect.

[06:45] And so I would imagine that that's the closest experience

[06:47] that we can have to not being alive yet again.

[06:50] Which, to me, is not that frightening.

[06:52] Yeah.

[06:53] And it is freeing you right because it's both humbling

[06:56] to know that you don't matter in the grand scheme of things.

[06:59] But at the same time, you matter infinitely

[07:02] if you just focus on the present and the mark

[07:06] that you're going to leave here and now.

[07:08] I contemplated, I had to die to my father

[07:10] or die to myself and I realized

[07:11] that I would rather die to him.

[07:13] Which pretty much ended up happening.

[07:15] And so my fear is relatively justified.

[07:17] He was not in support of the things that I wanted to do.

[07:20] I ended up quitting that job, sold everything I had,

[07:22] packed my car, went to California

[07:23] because that's why I thought the length of fitness opportunity

[07:25] was because I was the only thing I really enjoyed.

[07:27] Mentors were down to our guy for a few months

[07:28] to try to at least learn the ropes.

[07:29] Started my first facility, slept on the floor

[07:31] for the first nine months, which was a very terrible experience

[07:34] for me.

[07:34] And timestamp the age for me now, you started.

[07:36] I was 23.

[07:38] So you graduated early.

[07:40] You got that dream job and then you bailed.

[07:42] Yeah.

[07:42] Two years.

[07:43] And that was really at the time.

[07:45] And all of this kind of, it was at the splitting point

[07:47] where I had done two years and the career path

[07:50] traditionally is like two to four years of management

[07:52] consulting.

[07:53] And then you go back to an Ivy League for your GMAT.

[07:55] And then from there you go into, you can go do investment

[07:59] banking, you can do private equity, you can do,

[08:00] you know, some of the bigger white-collar jobs.

[08:02] But it was, I just didn't want more of what I had.

[08:08] And so I thought that I would have a better shot

[08:10] taking $200,000 into years, which is what the,

[08:13] you know, economic equivalent of what the degree was.

[08:15] And starting something in my own,

[08:17] I figured I would learn more in the first two years.

[08:18] And with that money and maybe you even have a business

[08:20] by the end of that period of time

[08:21] that made an equivalent amount of money

[08:22] compared to what I would've had as a job offer.

[08:24] But how did you, what signals did you get?

[08:28] I mean, you're saying like, I wasn't feeling it.

[08:30] But like, where was your motivation?

[08:31] Because I see you as this hustler,

[08:33] this go get all about gobbling up new opportunities.

[08:37] It transcends beyond that now.

[08:39] But like at first, it sounds like you were just

[08:41] all about the go get.

[08:42] But how did you know, I mean,

[08:44] first I was driven by fear.

[08:45] OK.

[08:46] It was all fear.

[08:47] Fear of failure, feel it disappointment,

[08:49] fear of other people's judgment.

[08:52] What did your dad end up saying?

[08:53] Did he say, good luck with you?

[08:56] No, he thought he was stupid.

[08:57] He thought I was wasting my life.

[08:58] Yeah.

[08:58] And wasted a degree that he had been money on.

[09:00] And wasted a good job of opportunity

[09:02] that he had set up for me, all these things.

[09:04] Right.

[09:05] In his defense, did he immigrate here?

[09:08] Yep.

[09:08] OK.

[09:09] So in his defense,

[09:10] right?

[09:11] And I just want to tell the audience,

[09:12] so they're not like, but it's like,

[09:15] you know, if you have just a fight and saying,

[09:17] if you escape from a country where there's trauma

[09:22] and impending danger, then your son's squanders

[09:25] and opportunity, you might get a little anxious about that.

[09:30] I mean, my dad came over the $1,000,

[09:33] you know, in a medical degree.

[09:35] Yeah.

[09:35] And then built everything.

[09:36] Didn't even speak English.

[09:37] Right.

[09:38] I think what he did was harder than what I've done.

[09:40] Like I got to stand on his shoulders.

[09:42] OK.

[09:43] In one way.

[09:44] I mean, I speak English.

[09:46] You know, like, just the basics.

[09:48] Like I speak English, I went to a good school.

[09:50] Just all the support and infrastructure

[09:52] known and unknown that was around me,

[09:53] to be successful.

[09:55] Yeah, I think it's healthy to recognize your privilege.

[09:57] Yeah.

[09:58] But at the same time, it came with lots of baggage, too.

[10:02] And so you had signals which were mainly fear-based.

[10:05] Yeah.

[10:06] I mean, the biggest thing that made the decision for me.

[10:08] I would say I had the logical decision

[10:09] and then I had the emotional decision.

[10:11] The emotional decision was, I don't want to do this.

[10:16] This is not the life I want to lead.

[10:18] I'm not happy doing this every day.

[10:20] I would prefer to not be alive if this is what my life will

[10:22] be continuously.

[10:23] If I would prefer to not be alive,

[10:25] then that kind of opens up my decision calculus.

[10:27] And what was it?

[10:28] I'm trying to put my finger on.

[10:29] What was it that made you happy?

[10:31] Was it just the freedom to do what you want?

[10:32] I didn't know it made me happy.

[10:33] I knew it was not making me happy.

[10:35] OK.

[10:36] So I think that's another important lesson, too,

[10:37] if I can just extract them.

[10:39] I'm sure a lot of people watching,

[10:40] they feel the same kind of family pressure.

[10:43] They want to be what other people expect them to be,

[10:45] if that's who you are.

[10:48] That's totally normal.

[10:50] But we should always remember the context in which

[10:53] that advice is given.

[10:55] Could be given through the lens of a certain lifestyle,

[10:57] a certain timeframe.

[10:59] But I think that's a thing.

[11:02] Whether you're young or middle-aged,

[11:05] you're trying to figure out what you want to be when you grow up.

[11:07] You're trying to have it all figured out.

[11:09] Because we don't, it seems like we don't like uncertainty.

[11:14] But I think your message if I'm hearing you

[11:16] is sometimes you have to try it on for size

[11:19] to see if it fits or not.

[11:20] And you get it on.

[11:21] You're like, well, I thought that dream job

[11:23] was going to be perfect, but turns out,

[11:27] it's tight in the crotch.

[11:28] You know, it's like, I need some different.

[11:32] I think giving yourself permission to do that.

[11:34] And it was aside to what you were saying about my dad,

[11:36] like, education saved his life.

[11:39] Like, he was only able to leave the country

[11:40] because he was educated.

[11:42] And so there's very deep roots there

[11:43] and I can appreciate that.

[11:44] But for this context or for my life,

[11:46] it just wasn't appropriate.

[11:48] And when we did come to terms later,

[11:50] the only time he's ever apologized to me in my life

[11:52] and said, but to be fair, in my time,

[11:55] I would have been right.

[11:56] Oh, absolutely.

[11:57] It's just not the same time.

[11:59] Yeah, absolutely.

[12:00] It wasn't that it was inappropriate.

[12:01] It was just out of context and didn't necessarily translate

[12:04] to this new life.

[12:06] I love the saying, in our 20s, we're concerned about

[12:09] whatever one thinks about us, in our 40s,

[12:11] we don't care what anyone thinks about us.

[12:13] In our 60s, we realize that don't

[12:14] think he about us to be with.

[12:15] Right.

[12:16] And I just feel like that's, I mean, who else have you

[12:18] thought about today besides yourself?

[12:19] Probably not.

[12:20] You have your kids, which is an extension yourself.

[12:21] But you don't even feel like, yeah.

[12:23] Not a lot.

[12:23] And so most people are like that.

[12:25] And a lot of, we have a lot more leeway

[12:28] than I think we give ourselves credit for.

[12:30] And I think the more that I have now,

[12:32] I'll say accomplished with quotes in material success

[12:35] the more I am excited about the things that I can do.

[12:38] And that was why the opening of the book was like,

[12:40] there aren't rules.

[12:42] And it just took me a very long time to realize that.

[12:43] And I continued to unlearn rules that I thought existed

[12:46] as I continued to go on this journey.

[12:48] Yeah, I love that idea of unlearning.

[12:50] I think we all just tried to go back to being

[12:52] like we were when we were children.

[12:54] Because when you're a child, you're purely present.

[12:57] But you're just present in the moment.

[12:58] And I don't like the word happy very much.

[13:02] I prefer using joy because you can be more enjoyfully.

[13:06] Because it's an internal rather than happiness.

[13:09] I feel like it's more like happiness dance.

[13:10] It's more from external.

[13:13] And so what are the things that bring you joy?

[13:15] What are the things that I find to find joy in?

[13:18] And I think for anyone who's listening,

[13:20] it's a much harder question to answer

[13:22] what are the things that bring you joy.

[13:24] And then answering the question,

[13:26] what are the things I hate?

[13:27] And it's easier to correct those first.

[13:30] You're like, well, I hate my job.

[13:31] And I hate my relationship.

[13:33] And I hate the city.

[13:34] OK, those are all very changeable.

[13:36] And a lot of times, you get there by inversion.

[13:39] Well, if I wanted to destroy my life,

[13:40] I wanted to have the worst life possible, what would I do?

[13:43] And then taking all of those things

[13:44] that you would do to really destroy your life

[13:45] and make your life miserable and then reverse them.

[13:47] It's a much easier way to solve the positive psychology equation

[13:51] in my opinion.

[13:52] Yeah, I love that.

[13:53] And I remember this Picasso quote, which is, I think he said,

[13:57] everyone is born and artist.

[13:59] And then eventually we get convinced that we're not.

[14:04] And we have to really just strip away and get back to basics.

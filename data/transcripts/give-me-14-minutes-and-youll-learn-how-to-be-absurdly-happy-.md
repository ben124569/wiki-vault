[00:00] reason you're dissatisfied is because you want things you don't have and you are unhappy

[00:08] with the trades that you've made but you want to keep the things you got from making those trades

[00:13] and then also retrade whatever it is that you gave to get what you've got for something else

[00:19] without accepting the downsides and trades of getting that thing. And so I was having this conversation

[00:25] with a friend of mine who's kind of in this his dating period of life trying to figure out

[00:30] who's going to marry and what not. And he sends me these very long voice notes and text messages

[00:37] about how it's like should I should have stayed home. Mom type wife a wife who's like

[00:42] you know, create a orientated or should I try and have somebody who could work with me and he's just

[00:45] going through this whole, you know, Righam Roll and he's he's struggled this for a while and

[00:51] fundamentally comes down to this which is that he wants everything and I'm not just saying this about him

[00:57] I'm saying this about us about all of us right it's like we wanted all and one of the the key

[01:03] you know formulas for getting just out of five of the life is wanting everything with limited resources

[01:10] in terms of time energy effort life in order to get them. And so I see this key thing myself included

[01:17] that I'll do some times where I'll get something that I want and then I'll look at something else

[01:21] that's a different path and be like I want that too but we used up the same resource to get it

[01:28] right. That's like if you have gas in the car and you're like well I've got one tank worth of gas

[01:33] and you're like I want to get to Toledo and then you get to Toledo and you're like I actually

[01:37] really want to get to you know orange County well all of a sudden you're like I used that my

[01:43] taken gas and say well I want to go to orange County too and say well you're in Toledo.

[01:48] You did it mean like you made that call and so it's interesting is that we regret the lives we have

[01:54] because of paths not taken without taking into consideration the trades we made then and so one of

[02:02] things that I that I feel like I've been practicing a lot has been this this effort of trying to

[02:06] play it out more which is like okay well let's say that we went to orange County not Toledo

[02:14] well I might be thinking in orange County like man Toledo's got all these things that are going

[02:17] on there and they've got these great sites and they've got you know more modest people and and and and

[02:23] and right and so it's like all paths have things that you don't currently have but the other part is like

[02:29] okay well whatever path I choose not to play out also has costs and so we have the

[02:35] perceived benefits of this other path which might not be as good as we think they are right and then we

[02:41] have these unknown costs which might be significantly worse than they are and so I was talking to him

[02:47] you know about about this and I was like well listen in like all three of these paths to find and

[02:52] I've seen really successful people who are in all three of these you know paths like stay-home

[02:58] situation parallel situation aligned or combined situation all three work right but

[03:05] like wanting the the benefits of all three is what gets us in trouble right I think our

[03:10] self-esterpower will make this clip where she was like the problems that we have isn't like people

[03:14] are worse it's just that our expectations are higher it's like we expect our spouse to be

[03:20] professional you know a professional business person to be an intellectual sparring partner

[03:27] to be an intellectual sparring partner to be your you know if it's a guy it's like you're you're

[03:32] made in your housekeeper also the mother and great parent you know for your kids also somebody who's

[03:39] like interested in the same hobbies as you and also your passionate lover it's like it's trying

[03:45] to cram 10 humans into one right like you make trades right there are things that you're going to

[03:51] get and there's things that you're going to trade and you know we get we get to satisfy when we just

[03:57] make trades and I see this like kind of like for us as individuals that there's kind of these

[04:02] stages you go I feel like in the beginning you just blame everyone else for why you don't have what you want

[04:05] right that's like stage one stage two you learn how to get stuff so now you get something that you

[04:11] want but you're like man I want I want that other path right I want the benefits of that

[04:17] without the cost of that but in my mind I've been imagined getting both my current life and their

[04:22] life and then I'm just going to be dissatisfied since I don't have both and I heard this really

[04:27] interesting quote which I love not wanting something is as good as having it not wanting it is as good

[04:35] as having it and I think about this trade all the way up right it's like when we die because people are

[04:40] like you know I really you know they get to the end of their life and then they have these quote

[04:43] regrets they look back and they're trying like quote give advice but like I actually don't take as

[04:47] much credence in there and I'll explain why it's not like I don't you know respect to old people

[04:52] it's more human thing than an old person thing just that when we die wanting another life for a

[04:59] different life it really just comes down to I wish I had the benefits of another life while also

[05:05] retaining the benefits of my own and if someone's a little bit more astute they'd say well I

[05:10] would trade the benefits of that life that's unknown for the life that for the benefits of the life

[05:15] that I have but it still has kind of contained within it you know all these are known so you're still

[05:20] saving not you're trading novelty right which makes sense but it doesn't also it doesn't actually

[05:25] inform decision making in a good way and so what ends up happening is we create this equation right

[05:31] like life becomes miserable when you when you want everything but have limited resources to get it

[05:36] which then you say I will be dissatisfied unless I get everything and by the way everything will change

[05:42] the thing I want I'll change it as soon as I get it I'll change it so that I can maintain

[05:46] dissatisfaction think about how wild this is like we proclaim that unless I get everything and

[05:54] impossible thing I will be dissatisfied see miles will just say I choose to be dissatisfied

[06:01] that is what I I demand this of course the universe doesn't care I think I got to get you that stuff

[06:06] back to my friend a lot of this I think comes down to commitment and expectations when Leil and I decided

[06:12] to get married you know we yeah we actually got married pretty fast and then decided to like look

[06:16] get married stuff right afterwards but one of the things that we looked at was like what are the

[06:21] commonalities between marriages that last and it's not actually what you think but I narrowed

[06:26] into two two kind of buckets here and I think this goes for any endeavor not just marriage but like big

[06:31] life twists high commitment low expectations that's the parent if you think about commitment

[06:41] as the elimination alternatives well then that makes sense that if you eliminate all alternatives that

[06:45] you will that by default you will stay on the path that you're currently on whether it's marriage

[06:50] whether it's business or you just eliminate all alternatives that's if another shot you're committed

[06:56] and then law expectations which is like okay you're committed here maybe don't get married

[07:00] but then you can either change reality or lower expectations so then you just have low expectations

[07:06] and you're not going anywhere and the thing is is that if you have low expectations and you're not

[07:11] going anywhere then reality is likely higher than your expectations which ends up meaning that you're

[07:14] above expectations for the rest of your life and so that has always been my like whenever I feel like

[07:21] this creep of dissatisfaction or wanting more or things like that or wanting different and to be clear

[07:26] this is not the second figured out life here just sharing more just sharing a thought that I was

[07:31] thinking about for myself to high expectation low commitment because I played out the other way for him

[07:36] you know in particular it was like if you were in a town of 500 people and you were of marriage age

[07:42] you'd have a pick of like 25 girls right and you'd be like ah the one I don't hate right like

[07:48] me be like all right there you go you know and people be doing that for much longer than they be doing

[07:52] unlimited swipes and so like we just have this very odd perspective on reality which is that we want

[07:59] all of the upside and none of the downside we want a perfect life and demand that we have one

[08:04] and then our dissatisfaction when our lives are not perfect we want all the upside like we want

[08:09] a trait we want we want all the good stuff it's like I want the I'll play this out so it's like

[08:15] I want the benefit of having a really short wife who's 80 bitty you know whatever and I also want

[08:24] a girl that's you know 61 and can like mother linebackers why we want both you got a pick one

[08:34] but I want both okay be dissatisfied or it and just never choose right like like this is actually

[08:41] really really real so many people stay stuck because they can't decide they're literally unwilling

[08:47] to make they're literally just stay there they'd stay undecided and somehow expect to get more information

[08:54] about an apparent contradiction like you expect that you're going to get more information like

[09:00] this is the choice you have to make it and if you don't make the choice you don't get the benefits of

[09:06] either and that's what's wild and so like I think about this affair about because there's just so many

[09:15] of choices that we have to make right throughout life where like some doors are are reversible right

[09:21] but the big doors in life are irreversible it's hard to go back right like you can't become 20 years

[09:26] old again you can't marry another person again you can't pick another business I mean you can

[09:32] you can get divorced from your business it's just painful there's wind down periods you know who you

[09:39] know just it's just it's you know who who comes you know who comes with you to your to your new

[09:45] business who doesn't like it's a whole mess right say big you can get divorced from your marriage right

[09:51] you can do that but it's it's tough right and so we have these doors that we we can really only

[09:58] go through one time and people will just stand at the precipice of the door and just wait

[10:03] their entire lives never getting what's on the other side of either door or either path and so

[10:10] I think like a prized trait is the ability to both make decisions and make good decisions

[10:20] and I'll give the third and this is me mostly talking to myself as you can see being happy with

[10:25] our decisions which I think is the significantly underrated skill like first you have to learn how

[10:32] to decide right if you don't make decisions you do nothing then you have to learn how to decide well

[10:38] so that your decisions work out you get more what you want and then number three is that you

[10:45] have to not change what you said you wanted from the decision that you made and or just be satisfied with

[10:50] whatever you get on the other side of that decision with the ultimate obviously just being that you

[10:55] didn't want anything to begin with which is we can all become Buddhist monks until that day comes

[11:00] I would say it has been helpful for me to just simply recognize the trades that I made and say yes

[11:05] I am okay with this trade and then whenever I think about an alternative path just reminding

[11:09] myself well there would be costs on that path and the upside of that path is probably not as good as I

[11:15] think it is and so me just being real with you like I've been kind of about as happier on

[11:22] happy as I am now for like a pretty long time and I like this is me just being really real I don't think

[11:31] I think if I were to play out three different lifetimes for me in different countries and

[11:35] different upreings the whole thing like I think I'd probably be about as happy or unhappy as I am now

[11:40] like I'm just being real like I just as much as like and that actually just actually thinking that

[11:47] has dramatically decreased my anxiety run some stuff like my worries this is like wow

[11:56] I'd probably be about as happy as I am now I'd have different variables but it would probably

[12:01] be quite too rare man so I gave the tall girl short girl for girl examples like me but it's like a

[12:07] rich or guy a poor guy I don't know I don't the example would be maybe a rich or guy sorry

[12:12] a taller guy and a sugar guy for girls I don't know but the idea is like fundamentally like there's

[12:16] just going to be traits that you're going to make and everyone might think oh no I would definitely

[12:21] want the rich guy well let's play it out let's actually play it out look at the wives of rich dudes

[12:27] are they happy not always look at the wives of poor dudes are they happy not always

[12:35] which basically which means humans will human we will be dissatisfied independent of our

[12:41] circumstance and that honestly at the end of the day like we are the problem like we are the problem

[12:52] and so that's actually my little like refrain that I have for myself whenever I have this little

[12:58] creepy being dissatisfaction spider that creeps up my neck I just hear like you are the problem

[13:05] you are the problem and then I think okay I'm the problem what expectations do I have that I

[13:13] set arbitrarily for myself that I deemed dissatisfactory when the world did not meet them

[13:19] and like oh okay well if I just remove that it's as good as having it right good's no so anyways

[13:28] love you all just a little morning thoughts it's a 540ish here at the office

[13:34] I'm really excited for the book launch it's going to be epic I've been basically preparing for

[13:40] two years for this basically the the incorrect word I have been preparing for two years for this

[13:47] and so I'm excited to finally show you what I've been working on this whole time

[13:52] it's going to be really sweet and I had to somehow outdo last time which was awesome so it's like

[13:57] how do I how do I do better than that come and you will see otherwise be awesome I could

[14:02] you guys soon bye

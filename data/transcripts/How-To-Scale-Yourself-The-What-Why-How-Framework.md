[00:00] If you don't know what I'm about to share with you, you're never going to scale your business.

[00:04] Fundamentally, business is an action, an asset that expands based on multiplication.

[00:11] We're doing the same thing over and over and over again. So repetition and scale are fundamental

[00:16] to how a business grows. And so you have to understand how to scale yourself through others.

[00:21] It's taken me a very long time to understand a very simple concept and we're going to share it with you.

[00:25] If for some reason, in your company, you're not getting the outcome from the employees that you

[00:31] want, then it is one of these three things that's the issue. And I believe that simplicity,

[00:34] you know, simple scales, fancy fails, so I like to keep my framework simple. And the way that I

[00:39] discovered this was actually through reading any gross book, high output management, really,

[00:44] really, really highly recommend. And he's one of the all-time best operators, you know, in

[00:48] of all time. He's the goat of operations. And he posited that there's two things fundamentally

[00:53] that every manager should do. And adding one third, one other piece to this has been my personal

[00:59] experience and so I'm adding these two together. If you don't know who we are, my name's Oxermosi,

[01:02] I'm a portfolio company that does just under $85 million a year. We've done $120 million

[01:06] in less three years. Let's rock into it. So how to scale yourself? So the first question that I like to

[01:12] ask myself, if somebody is not doing what I want them to do is, do they know what I want them to do?

[01:18] All right? Which if they don't, then it's a functioning communication. So if someone doesn't

[01:21] is not doing what I want them to do, the first question I ask you is like, did you know what I

[01:24] wanted you to do? Was it clear? And one of the roles that we have of is it's not written and never

[01:29] happened. All right? So if you're giving a directive to somebody, say, hey, can you do this for me?

[01:32] That's where you fall up with slack or you fall up with a son or you fall up with an email,

[01:36] because if it doesn't exist in the digital world, there's no record of it, then it's like it didn't

[01:40] happen. All right? And so one of the roles of thumb is, if someone's not doing something, the first thing

[01:44] asked is, do you know what I wanted you to do? And then did I personally fall up with that be an email,

[01:48] slack, a son or whatever tools you use to run your business? If that's true, if that has happened,

[01:54] then I fall us to the next thing, which is survey training. Do they know how to do what I want

[02:00] them to do? So they may know what I want them to do, because I communicated to adequately, I documented

[02:06] it, I put it in a son, I put it in an email, I put it at what I would have been slack. So the

[02:09] thing knew after the conversation, even though I told them that, what I expected them to do and

[02:14] buy when? But if they're like, I didn't know how to do it, then I would say, okay, well how can

[02:19] I, how can I help you with this? Do I need to provide a training for you? Do I need to buy a course

[02:22] for you? Do I need to hop on a call and explain it to you? Does another employee need to train you?

[02:26] Like, does your manager need to train you? Like, what needs to happen here for you to understand

[02:29] how to do what I want you to do? All right? So these are the first two levels of scaling yourself.

[02:34] First, you have clear understanding of what it is that you want them to do. And I'm telling you,

[02:37] this is the framework that I use when I'm thinking through this stuff. Like, if someone is not executing,

[02:42] I just have to think to myself, I always assume it's my fault. And then I think, okay, well,

[02:45] they either just don't know what I want them to do, or they don't know how I want them to do it,

[02:50] or which leads me to the third one, if they know what I want them to do, and they know how to do it,

[02:56] then why aren't they doing it? Which comes to motivation, right? And if they're not motivated,

[03:00] then I have to figure out why. Now, most of the time, it comes from a couple of things. And I would

[03:04] say that these are the most common ones that I have dealt with. The first is that they don't

[03:08] understand why it's important within the larger context of the company. They just feel like they're

[03:13] are cog within the business, and they don't understand what this contributes to the business.

[03:17] Right? One of the number one feelings that people are a poisons will have is they feel like what

[03:21] their work doesn't matter. And that's what creates, you know, meaningless work, busy work people

[03:25] who just try and look busy when they're not actually doing anything. And it's because they don't

[03:29] understand why you even have their role. And that means that a lot of times it's because they're

[03:34] manager or whatever didn't do a good job communicating it to. It's like, this is our function

[03:37] within the business. This is what happens if we don't exist. This is what the experiences like

[03:41] if we do a good job. This is what happens. This is the result. And just about every function

[03:46] the business can be tied to how it contributes to the bottom line. Even if you're a more

[03:50] supporter operations role. Like IT, if we didn't have information systems, we wouldn't know where

[03:55] attracting is for anything and we couldn't make good decisions and the business relies on high

[03:59] quality decisions. If we're in marketing, we wouldn't be getting new business in. If we're in sales,

[04:03] we wouldn't be transacting. If we're a customer service, we'd be getting charged back

[04:06] to people wouldn't be happy. We have to tie and make sure that everyone understands how you

[04:10] contribute to the bottom line. Why it's important? That's the first level of understanding

[04:15] for motivation here. The second level is making sure that they're actually bought into the

[04:20] vision of the company. What's the mission? What are we trying to accomplish? Who are we trying

[04:23] to have? What problem the world are we solving? This is something that I've, you know, I had to

[04:27] learn as our company scale. Does that? Some of that soft, you know, woo, woo, like whatever

[04:32] culture stuff is actually really important, right? Especially as your scale because when you scale

[04:36] service, especially, does anyone know what the two things that you scale are? Let's tell you what they

[04:41] are. It's culture and training. That is what happens when you scale decision making. That is how

[04:50] you scale decision making is culture and training. And the culture is going to come from telling

[04:56] people what they need to do and why we do it. And the training is there to make sure that they know

[05:00] how to do it when the time comes and they are motivated to do so. Right? And so you can look at

[05:05] a lot of an employee and figure out if someone's not doing it, sometimes they have two of the three.

[05:09] So an employee, for example, that knows what to do and it's motivated to do it and but not doing it

[05:15] because they don't know how. They'll usually pretend that they're busy because they're so

[05:18] ashamed of the fact that you don't know what they're doing but they really like love the company

[05:21] and want to help. Right? But a lot of times people don't advocate for themselves. And so we have to

[05:25] make sure they know how. Now, for example, an employee who is motivated and has the training,

[05:31] but doesn't know what you want them to do, a lot of times they just paralyzed or starts executing

[05:34] on things that are not relevant. I've had this happen so many times that like drives me nuts.

[05:38] Someone's someone knows how to do what we want them to do and they know why it's important

[05:43] but they're executing on things that are not priorities. So they start doing extra work because

[05:47] they're motivated and they know how to do stuff that's valuable but it's not contributing to anything

[05:51] that's moving the company forward. Right? They're not doing, they're not executing things in alignment

[05:55] with where we're going as a company. Right? And then the third combination would be somebody who

[05:59] knows what to do and they know how to do it but they're not motivated. And this is typically,

[06:03] I would say the worst scenario which is where somebody just feels worthless. And so these people

[06:08] tend to check out, they're not working, they're trying to avoid confrontation as much as possible.

[06:12] And you should probably looking for other jobs. And so for me, I try to think most of the times

[06:15] they're not going to have none of them. Right? They're going to have one or two of these things hopefully.

[06:19] Right? It's not like, you don't know what to do. They don't know how to do it and they don't

[06:21] don't know why they're even there. I've had it happen and it's horrible but like most times

[06:26] there's two of the three that are there and you just have to figure out which of the other three is

[06:29] and that is ultimately how you can scale decision making and scale yourself within the company.

[06:33] That is how you scale companies. I hope you found this valuable. Click subscribe. Use this framework

## Full Transcript
[00:00] My last book, $100 million offers just crossed its one year anniversary.

[00:03] It's sort of a 200,000 copies.

[00:04] With no publisher, no advertising campaign.

[00:07] I launched it before I had an audience.

[00:09] It's really off of word of mouth.

[00:10] Alex Moisey just launched brand new book.

[00:12] It's $100 million offers.

[00:14] $100 million offers.

[00:15] And so people read the book and share the book.

[00:17] You need to create and grant Islam off of it.

[00:19] If people aren't sharing it on their own,

[00:21] then it's not worth promoting.

[00:23] Because it's not good enough.

[00:25] I think that when I die, the thing that I will be most proud of

[00:27] is not the businesses that I've built,

[00:28] but the books that I've written.

[00:29] I think the books will outlive anything else.

[00:31] And I think that they will help more people.

[00:32] That's why I spend right now about 20 to 25 hours a week every week

[00:36] on my book.

[00:37] Most authors pretty much only do that.

[00:38] They're right for four or four hours a day and then they end

[00:40] their day.

[00:41] For me, I write for four or five hours and then I start my day.

[00:43] And so I wanted to do one deep dive video into my writing process.

[00:47] The most powerful ability in the world to influence other people

[00:51] is the ability to tell stories.

[00:52] That's because you can both educate and entertain with stories.

[00:55] It literally changes people's brain waves

[00:57] when they're listening to a story and they become more suggestible.

[01:00] So I'm going to break down the elements of storytelling,

[01:02] how to edit a story to make it better,

[01:04] how to increase the stakes that make it interesting to a reader.

[01:07] And they how to do it in such a way that you're actually breaking

[01:09] someone's beliefs that you can actually influence how they behave.

[01:12] And once you have that ability, you can use it to sell.

[01:15] You can use it to educate.

[01:16] You can use it to teach.

[01:17] To reshape someone's beliefs.

[01:19] You can change someone's character.

[01:20] You can give skills like there's endless ways and it's the most

[01:23] effective way to communicate to other people that there is.

[01:26] If you want to write a book, the way that I outline these things is

[01:29] what's the point of writing this book to begin with?

[01:31] What is the problem that I'm solving?

[01:33] The vast majority of books that are written right now are not written

[01:35] because they want to serve the audience,

[01:37] they're written because the author wants to make money

[01:39] from the book, Accolades, whatever.

[01:41] Most books are not worth reading.

[01:42] When writing and publishing a book became easier

[01:44] was about the 1960s.

[01:45] From that point going forward, the amount of books that were published

[01:48] has exploded.

[01:49] 1.6 million books are written per year.

[01:51] The reason people published has changed.

[01:53] But I believe that great writing comes from a place

[01:55] of wanting to add to the body of knowledge.

[01:57] And when you do that, then it allows to compress five years

[02:00] into three hours or four hours for somebody.

[02:02] And that's where a book becomes valuable.

[02:04] Next is kind of like, how do you come up with a big idea?

[02:06] And then after that I'll talk about the editing stuff.

[02:08] From a big idea standpoint, this is what actually takes me

[02:10] the longest period of time, which is narrowing down the focus

[02:12] of the book to a single problem to be solved.

[02:13] I have to answer the question very truthfully,

[02:16] what I want someone to get from this book.

[02:17] The first book offers is people don't know what to sell.

[02:20] And so that's the first problem somebody has before they can make

[02:22] money, is they have to know what they're actually going to sell

[02:24] someone, which is the offer.

[02:25] And so that's why I started my books here, is there.

[02:28] The next problem is they don't have anyone to sell it to.

[02:30] They need leads.

[02:31] And so the idea is that when someone's going to meet somebody else,

[02:34] I have to think, like, where does my book come out in the wild?

[02:37] Just saying, like, oh, I read this great book, you should read it.

[02:38] Some people read that.

[02:40] But where I think it's best is where someone's like,

[02:41] dude, I wish I had more leads.

[02:42] People are like, oh, if you're suffering from that,

[02:44] you have to read this book.

[02:45] Because now it's a solution to someone's problem.

[02:48] The problem with most books is that they don't actually

[02:51] solve anyone's problem because they basically name hundreds

[02:53] of problems and don't completely solve any of them.

[02:55] So I would rather very narrowly define the problem

[02:57] and then solve it completely.

[02:58] A good book is a complete solution to a narrowly defined problem.

[03:02] And so what is the problem that we're solving?

[03:03] And then what are the ways that I would think about solving the problem?

[03:05] Usually it's going to be three to six big buckets

[03:07] that are going to fit for solving a specific problem.

[03:09] Once I have those buckets, I'm going to think,

[03:11] what are the experiences that I've had

[03:12] that have shaped this belief that I have about this?

[03:14] Like, why do I think they're these three to six buckets?

[03:16] It's like, well, this is what happened in this time.

[03:17] That's what shaped this part.

[03:18] And this is what happened this time, this is what shaped that part.

[03:20] When I saw the charity event at Arnold Schwarzenegger,

[03:23] it was a very interesting time that we were invited to.

[03:24] I saw scarcity in action about how are they able to sell these things

[03:28] that were never normally worth more than $10,000 for $100,000.

[03:31] There was all these other factors that played.

[03:33] So it was a very good story for me to transfer

[03:34] like why scarcity is important.

[03:36] There's lots of different framers for trading stories.

[03:38] I will give you the one that has been useful for me.

[03:40] You have a setting which is where this is happening.

[03:42] You have the character, the person who's doing the doing.

[03:45] You have the desire, which is the thing they want.

[03:47] You have some sort of struggle, why they can't get it.

[03:50] You have some sort of your reek of moment that changes things.

[03:53] Cheving the victory and then some sort of resolution.

[03:55] They talk about this as the heroes to journeys,

[03:57] but not all stories have to share this that if two journeys.

[03:59] But the externally internal, and you want to tell both.

[04:02] The external is what you can see with your eyes

[04:04] if you were in the room.

[04:05] The internals, what you have to experience

[04:07] is the person emotionally.

[04:08] And see, we want to weave both of those together in the story.

[04:10] And so someone might have the victory, but it might feel empty.

[04:12] And so it's like we want to tell both sides of that.

[04:14] There's two kind of rules of thought that I use.

[04:16] One is, I want to use all five cents

[04:18] so I talk about what I smell, what I hear,

[04:19] what I see, what I can touch, how things feel,

[04:22] how I could feel the back of the chair it gets me.

[04:24] My back was soarx, I've been sitting for hours.

[04:26] So I could set the setting that way

[04:27] by kind of describing rather than telling.

[04:29] Number two is you want to show rather than telling.

[04:31] So I'll give an example of Stephen King uses

[04:32] in his book on writing, which is a great book.

[04:34] Instead of saying, Cheryl walked in, she was his ex-wife.

[04:37] He might say something like,

[04:38] he stroke the spot on his finger that was still

[04:40] bleached from where his wedding ring used to be.

[04:42] You show the situation to the reader

[04:45] rather than telling them.

[04:47] And that is also true of great copy

[04:49] of great marketing of great ads

[04:50] is that you want to demonstrate rather than saying it.

[04:52] Well, then what details do you include?

[04:54] Because I could spend an entire book

[04:55] to describe this room.

[04:56] But if I just said there was a pelth on the wall

[04:58] and it's made of wood and there was a view of water

[05:01] and pine trees, you probably have an idea

[05:03] of what kind of place this is.

[05:05] He want to be selected about the details

[05:07] that you're choosing to call out

[05:07] because otherwise you're just wasting time.

[05:09] Now, if the pelth that I have on the wall in my mind's eye

[05:13] is a deer and in your mind is a buffalo,

[05:16] does it change the story?

[05:17] And if the answer is no, then we don't need to go

[05:19] no more detail on it.

[05:20] You want to be vivid in your description

[05:22] about the things that matter.

[05:23] For me, I've always had stories heavily in green and books

[05:26] because I want you bring the experience

[05:28] that taught the lesson with it

[05:30] because then it gives context to why the framework

[05:32] that I introduced in the chapter is useful.

[05:34] So what makes a story interesting?

[05:36] I like to think of it as one main thing,

[05:39] which is stakes and struggle.

[05:40] I can give you a simple story.

[05:42] I was at home.

[05:43] I was hungry.

[05:44] I couldn't find any food.

[05:46] I realized I had my phone

[05:47] and I ordered Uber eats.

[05:49] Uber eats arrived.

[05:50] I ate.

[05:51] I was satisfied.

[05:52] That is a story.

[05:53] That a very interesting story.

[05:54] But it is a story.

[05:55] If I told that same story and I were to say,

[05:57] I was hungry, I'm a diabetic.

[05:59] If I don't eat, I could die.

[06:02] And there was no food in the house.

[06:03] As I was rummaging around,

[06:04] my vision started to narrow.

[06:05] I started getting cold sweatshirts

[06:06] and I was like, am I going to be able to get food

[06:09] before I pass out?

[06:10] My family's out of town, they're not gonna be able to find me.

[06:12] And so I started having thoughts about like,

[06:14] is this how they're gonna find me?

[06:15] My body on the floor.

[06:16] My kids get a thick.

[06:18] All of a sudden, I created stakes in the story.

[06:21] The reason game shows are inherently interesting

[06:23] is that they literally put money on it.

[06:24] So that there are stakes.

[06:26] That's why those exist.

[06:27] Imagine you were watching a bunch of poker players,

[06:30] play, and the chips were meaningless.

[06:33] Like, stakes is what makes things interesting.

[06:35] So there was a textbook that my buddy, Dr. Cashie also sent me

[06:38] to create better ads, write better copy,

[06:41] and ultimately write things that are more interesting.

[06:43] What are the factors of newsworthiness?

[06:44] And so if you think about newsworthiness,

[06:46] it's just what are things that make things interesting.

[06:48] And so there were seven components.

[06:49] The more of these components that you can tie into a story,

[06:51] the more of a story it is.

[06:53] And they literally even talk about stories in the news,

[06:55] like, what's the story?

[06:56] The first one is Reacency.

[06:57] How far away the event was to the things.

[07:00] If you think about hopping on trends as fast as possible

[07:02] when you're telling stories, the Reacency

[07:03] with which the thing occurred to when you're telling the story

[07:06] makes it more interesting.

[07:07] The second one is Impact of the event.

[07:09] So if there's a story, but it has no impact on the reader

[07:12] or the listener, it's gonna be limited,

[07:13] which is why it's on the job of the author

[07:15] to a select the stories that they're gonna tell.

[07:17] And then make sure that they're bridging

[07:18] why this is important for you as they're telling the story

[07:21] and then they tie it to the action items,

[07:22] especially if you're teaching,

[07:23] that you want to take as a result of that.

[07:25] The third is Promidence.

[07:26] Like if Tim Kardashian sneezes,

[07:28] it becomes interesting because of how prominent she is.

[07:31] And so if you can involve characters that have prominence

[07:33] in a story, then you make the story more interesting

[07:35] in and of itself.

[07:36] The next one is Proximity.

[07:37] So it's close to homeless, if you will.

[07:40] If I tell you a story of a house that's burning down,

[07:42] it might be kind of interesting.

[07:43] But if I told you it was your neighbor next door,

[07:45] it's probably much more interesting to you.

[07:47] If you have an ad in your marketing to a local market,

[07:49] the closer you can get the headline,

[07:51] if it says rather than like Baltimore, Maryland,

[07:53] it says Towson, Maryland, which is a sub-sub-verb,

[07:55] or whatever.

[07:56] They're gonna be much more inclined to listen to it.

[07:58] The next thing that makes something interesting is conflict.

[08:00] Whether that's natural or whether it's between people,

[08:02] we're here recording this video

[08:03] and a man with a gun walks in.

[08:05] All of a sudden, this got way more interesting.

[08:07] And so it's because there's conflict.

[08:08] There's tension and there's unresolved, there's mystery.

[08:10] The next one is how unusual is this thing?

[08:13] Is there something odd or bizarre or unique

[08:16] about this particular situation or story?

[08:18] Like if you see something that you expect,

[08:19] your brain doesn't say, oh, let's pay more attention to this

[08:21] because it matches the patterns that you expect.

[08:23] And see the idea is that you want someone

[08:24] to cast a pattern or expectation on your story.

[08:27] And then all of a sudden you shift it and they're like,

[08:28] whoa, and then their brain will

[08:30] re-re-re-re-sources towards the story

[08:31] because it's not matching the patterns

[08:33] that they already had in their mind,

[08:35] which means they need a creative tension

[08:36] to reconcile the conflict between what they expect

[08:39] and what is reality.

[08:40] And the last one is the amount of times

[08:42] you can update.

[08:43] This is a little bit more around news,

[08:44] but it's like how many times can you update someone

[08:45] on the same thing, right?

[08:46] That's why news stories love giving updates up

[08:49] or pressing news right from the crime scene.

[08:50] When you're telling a story,

[08:51] it might not be always able to do that

[08:52] if you're fixed in a story setting.

[08:54] You don't have to have all of these things,

[08:55] but if you have two, three of these things

[08:57] in one story, it makes it a much more interesting story.

[08:59] Hey guys, the much awaited sequel to $100 million offers

[09:02] is $100 million a lead.

[09:04] It is coming out in the next 12 months,

[09:06] realistically, probably six months.

[09:08] And if you want to get on the early bird list

[09:10] because last time we sold out in less than an hour.

[09:12] So if you want to get on the early bird list

[09:14] and just make sure that you have a guaranteed copy,

[09:16] ready for you, for distributions,

[09:18] you can use it and get them more leads in your business.

[09:20] Go to acquisition.com anywhere and just opt in

[09:22] and then you'll get automatically added to that list

[09:25] that we can send you the length of moment at launches.

[09:27] Once you have that, you have a way to tell a story.

[09:30] Now it's like, okay, well then how do I bridge that

[09:31] into a wireframe for a book?

[09:33] And so for me, my general rule of thumb is that I just put

[09:35] stories in where I feel like it starts to get heavy.

[09:37] I want to deliver as much of the things

[09:39] I need to do in their business.

[09:40] And right when I start to feel like it's heavy,

[09:41] I zoom out and create a story that creates more context

[09:43] than we dive back in.

[09:44] I have my big problem, the supporting argument

[09:47] that lead up to that single thing.

[09:48] And then I have the stories about how I learn

[09:50] each of those things to fill in the blanks for that book

[09:53] and then the framework for each chapter.

[09:54] Now once I have that, I have a general idea of how I want

[09:57] to go about solving that problem.

[09:58] Everyone has different writing processes.

[10:00] For me, I go as far as I can until I realize

[10:02] that I have a logical inconsistency or an inconsistency

[10:05] with my own experiences that would prove my theory

[10:07] or model wrong.

[10:08] At that point, this is the part where most people don't want to do it.

[10:11] I go back to the beginning, I adjust my assumptions,

[10:13] and then I restart the book and I write it again.

[10:15] And I usually get a little further.

[10:17] And then I realize that something is wrong with the model.

[10:19] And the bigger it is, the more I have to adjust the book

[10:21] and start over again.

[10:22] Models have to be two things.

[10:23] They have to be useful, and they have to be valid.

[10:26] There's too many things in life that you don't want

[10:28] to rediscover and redo the work.

[10:29] So your brain creates these mental shortcuts.

[10:30] These mental checklists that you go through in your head.

[10:32] A lot of them are not documented.

[10:33] So all the framework really is is documenting

[10:35] the checklist you already go through.

[10:36] There's always a process everyone goes through

[10:38] and make a decision as simple as they may be.

[10:40] Which is really not going to grab the one that's closest to me.

[10:43] You know what I mean?

[10:44] It could be as simple as that.

[10:46] There's a framework that you use and it is useful.

[10:48] Now the question is how valid is it?

[10:50] And the validity of a framework depends on how many different

[10:53] circumstances it can be applied to and also still work.

[10:55] The very valuable framework is like equals empty squared

[10:58] apply in everyone that we have found to date,

[11:01] which is what makes it so valid.

[11:02] When I'm testing a framework,

[11:03] I know the situations it does work,

[11:05] and so then I start testing it in new situations,

[11:07] and I'm testing it in a way that I'm still valid.

[11:09] And if it isn't valid,

[11:10] I go back to the original framework to how would I need to adjust

[11:12] this so it would incorporate both.

[11:13] And then I tested it in another situation.

[11:14] And another business situation,

[11:16] until eventually I get a framework that I can't find a way

[11:18] that it's wrong.

[11:19] The longest process for me is Ideating all the pieces

[11:22] that are going to be in the book.

[11:23] The next longest process is actually writing the first draft.

[11:26] From there, I go through my heavy editing of going from

[11:29] 12th grade language to 3rd grade language with more pictures.

[11:32] My goal is that when someone reads the stuff that I have

[11:34] and as much of their mental capacity on consuming the concepts

[11:38] and not translating the words into things they understand,

[11:41] the average American reads somewhere in the neighborhood

[11:44] of 5th to 7th grade, depending on where you read,

[11:46] which means half of Americans read below that.

[11:49] There's a free app called HemingwayApp.com

[11:52] that literally is just a pace box.

[11:54] And when you paste your words into the box,

[11:57] it highlights it and says this is too complicated,

[12:00] add verb, pass it.

[12:01] If you want to train yourself to be a better writer,

[12:03] using it gives you immediate feedback.

[12:05] Because as soon as you change it, the color changes.

[12:07] And so when you talk about changing people's behavior,

[12:09] having something that immediately gives you feedback

[12:11] when you make a change is the best way to reinforce behavior quickly.

[12:13] And so I think it's one of the best teaching writing tools

[12:16] that exists.

[12:17] It's so simple, you'll be amazed at how much better your writing comes out.

[12:20] So if you have a paragraph and you can eliminate a sentence

[12:22] and the paragraph's meaning stays the same, eliminate it.

[12:24] If you can use shorter sentences, versus a long sentence,

[12:28] it is better to use the shorter sentence.

[12:30] If you have a shorter word, it is better to use it.

[12:32] Try to eliminate verbs whenever possible.

[12:34] Really, whenever possible.

[12:35] Whenever you're like, I'm really not sure,

[12:36] still try to eliminate it.

[12:37] Most times when you see an adverb,

[12:39] it's because you did not use the right verb.

[12:41] I walked quickly.

[12:43] It would be much better to say, I ran.

[12:45] I always use simple sentences.

[12:47] So rather than like, would have like to,

[12:50] I just say, wanted or wanted to.

[12:52] If you can't make something sound simple,

[12:54] it's because you don't get it, not them.

[12:56] From there, I go and send it to four to eight

[12:59] of my ideal readers.

[13:01] People whose opinions I value,

[13:03] but don't hold me in high enough

[13:04] is deemed that they're not contaminated with a truth.

[13:05] So they're like, hey, I questions here,

[13:07] or this didn't make sense,

[13:08] or this town of contradiction or something else, whatever.

[13:09] And so they send me back their notes.

[13:11] Again, I used Stephen King disease,

[13:12] just like my hero for writing.

[13:13] But he's like, if you get lots of different feedback

[13:15] for everyone, then you did a good job.

[13:16] If everyone's saying the same thing,

[13:18] he's like, you probably should change it.

[13:19] Once I get the feedback from those readers,

[13:21] I create what would be considered my third and final draft.

[13:23] Then I send that to an editor

[13:24] for like grammar, typos, et cetera.

[13:26] And then at that point,

[13:27] I have what I would consider my finished book.

[13:29] I spend a thousand hours on a book, roughly.

[13:33] And a lot of people can't comprehend that,

[13:35] like level of work, which is also why most people

[13:37] can't make good stuff.

[13:38] People think that writing a book

[13:39] is like just literally getting the word count

[13:41] to a book size and then slapping a cover on it

[13:43] and shipping it, which is why there are so many bad books.

[13:45] There's this visual that Stephen King gives

[13:47] that I think is like the best visual,

[13:48] and it gave me hope about writing.

[13:51] He said writing is walking uphill

[13:53] with a bag of rocks where you keep adding rocks

[13:56] the higher up the hill you go.

[13:58] So the longer you've been writing something,

[14:00] the heavier it feels.

[14:01] He's like you just have to have the endurance

[14:04] to be able to go through the hard work,

[14:07] pruning through the writing

[14:08] and killing the darlings really like I spent so much time

[14:10] on the section, but it shouldn't be in the book.

[14:12] With this particular book,

[14:13] I went through eight full drafts.

[14:15] So it's about 600 pages of writing

[14:16] to create what is now 200 pages of version eight of the book.

[14:21] So with the leads book,

[14:21] I can tell you the sections of the book are.

[14:23] Understanding how to talk about leads,

[14:25] get leads, get other people to get you leads,

[14:27] get even more leads, do it.

[14:29] Those are the sections of the book.

[14:31] Right, like there's very simple.

[14:32] And then within each of those subsections

[14:34] is the different types of ways you can collect leads.

[14:36] And so but all of them alone,

[14:37] that single point which is how to get people more leads.

[14:39] This thing that I'm writing does not apply to that,

[14:41] you take it out.

[14:42] I'm shooting for a book a year.

[14:43] We'll see if I get there.

[14:44] But like that's what that's my mental back of napkin goal

[14:47] is I still have to run all the companies

[14:50] and make these videos and stuff.

[14:51] So if you took some takeaways that you can write

[14:54] into your stories, into the content that you make,

[14:56] into your marketing, into your advertising,

[14:58] into the stuff you used to sell people things.

[15:00] Should check out my content video of how we gain

[15:02] 1.2 million followers in six months,

[15:04] just using a standard step-by-step

[15:06] concentrated jewelry break down in all the details

[15:09] and the stages that you can apply them

[15:10] within your business right now.

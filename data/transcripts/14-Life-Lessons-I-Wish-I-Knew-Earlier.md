[00:00] 13 lessons I learned after graduating college from the real world that I wish I had learned earlier.

[00:05] The first is that you make better decisions and you learn more by assuming that you're

[00:09] done more than everyone else. The reason this was something that took me a long time to learn

[00:12] is that when I was in college it was all about showing how smart you were. It was about talking

[00:16] more in the group meetings, about raising your hand more in the class room. I took that and started

[00:21] translating in the real world and I realized that I didn't learn very much because I was the one

[00:25] talking all the time and it only took a few times of me getting introduced to somebody.

[00:30] Someone would introduce us and I would basically spend the whole time

[00:32] blabbering on about how great I was and how much I knew. Only to find out later that this person was

[00:38] way above me. In business and whatever things that I was pursuing at the time and then I

[00:41] felt tons of shame and embarrassment about how stupid I was for doing that. I had to shift the way that

[00:46] I talked to new people and the way that I answered rooms and I'm real I still talked probably too much.

[00:50] But at least being aware of that lesson as early as it could I wish I had learned it earlier.

[00:55] Fundamentally you can't learn if you're talking. It's up you're trying to learn.

[00:59] Then not talking is the first wreck was it for doing that and if you want to make better decisions

[01:03] then you need to learn. This was a big epiphany I had. I got introduced once to somebody. I was

[01:08] walking peripherally after I had left and somebody else went up to them. It was like do you know who that

[01:13] guy is? In that moment I realized that my positioning was now sky high because I didn't have to be the

[01:18] one to say it. The idea that I realized was how can I get other people to edify me? Because what I had

[01:24] to allow people to do was to make the same mistake that I used to make which is that someone

[01:28] young someone inexperienced someone less aware whatever would come up and then start posturing themselves

[01:34] and blathering on about everything that they're doing and me I might be way ahead of them but I

[01:38] would listen and see if there's anything interesting. And so on that conversation I learned more

[01:42] than they did. I learned what type of person they are. I learned where they're at with their career.

[01:46] If they had anything interesting that would be worth following up with. They learned nothing.

[01:50] They felt good about themselves and then later would feel bad about themselves when that other

[01:54] person went over and told them. And so I was like of these two scenarios which would I rather do.

[01:58] But I rather have someone have a conversation with me and then not know who I was but be able to learn

[02:04] is that's the worst case scenario or what I rather blather on. Learn nothing. Either I am above them

[02:10] and then they're like, well fuck that guy he brags or I'm below them and I'm the moral. So I stopped

[02:15] doing that. So that was less than number one. Less than number two was that the hardest respect to earn

[02:19] is one zone. What I realized and this was something that was really hard for me is that I had a pretty

[02:22] bad reputation at the very beginning of my college career in all of my high school career. And it was

[02:25] because I drank too much. I was irresponsible. I was slept around a lot and I wasn't representing

[02:30] the type of person that I wanted to be. And so I felt ashamed of the behaviors that I did but I

[02:34] didn't change them. And so it was only through a conversation that I had with my father where I said,

[02:37] how do I change my reputation? How do I get these people to stop saying this stuff? But I thought

[02:41] there was some like PR marketing angle that I could take that I could control the narrative. He said,

[02:46] why don't you stop being a piece of shit? He said that in his own words and I was like that

[02:51] can't be it. I'll figure out a way. When parents talk to kids they're listening but they're not listening.

[02:54] That really stuck with me and I started thinking about it. And so I said like well if I wanted to be

[02:58] somebody who is respectable what I do and so then I tried to start acting in that way to be someone

[03:02] who's respect my own I would earn. And so when I started doing that nothing changed externally.

[03:07] People still treated me like I was a piece of shit and they were probably right. But my behavior

[03:10] began to change and then slowly so did my reputation. But it started with me trying to respect

[03:16] myself first and then others began to respect me as a result. If you want to control people think

[03:21] control what they say. This is the third lesson I learned and this is more of a business

[03:24] slash marketing lesson but if you want to talk about products and services you have to equip people

[03:30] with the words to describe what you have because otherwise you're asking them to solve the problem

[03:35] of how to describe your business and if right now you can't even figure out how you're going to

[03:38] describe your business and you own the darn thing how do you expect them to do it in a half second

[03:41] when they're telling their friend. And so this is really about equipping people with simple language so they

[03:45] can communicate what you do. So for example, what acquisition.com the mission when I started the business

[03:49] was to document it to share the best practical building world class companies. Most people don't know what

[03:52] that means. And so I have now and we probably will shift the language to make real business education

[03:57] available to everyone. They functionally mean the same thing. But giving people the words to describe it

[04:02] in a way that they understand allows me to give them more so they can explain to somebody else. You get

[04:06] more out of reading one book that's great five times than out of reading five mediocre books.

[04:12] I don't read many books. And what I mean by that is I buy lots of books. I skim most of them and

[04:17] quickly realize that it's not worth reading. And so then I toss them aside because just because

[04:21] someone wrote a book doesn't mean you need to finish it. It's nothing to do with you. It means that

[04:24] they didn't organize it well. I have found that books that are older in general tend to be

[04:27] better because the reason the person wrote it was a different attention. They wrote it because they

[04:29] wanted to transmit knowledge to the next generation. Whereas people who are at books now are either

[04:33] writing for money, writing for no variety, writing them to sell other shit. If you find books for the

[04:37] author is actually writing because they want you to convey knowledge to the next generation, those

[04:40] tend to be better books in my experience because the intent is to actually teach not to

[04:44] persuade. Slide difference. When you do find those gems, I have realized that if I read something

[04:49] once and to end, I still don't know yet. I will read a book two times three times four times five times

[04:54] until I can teach the book when I feel like it is worth learning. And then once I have like squeeze

[05:00] the book for everything that it has to the point where I can convey the message to somebody else,

[05:03] like I can teach the concepts of the book, which is something that I've done many times,

[05:07] or I'll actually make a presentation on the book so that I can wrap my own frameworks around how I can

[05:11] remember it. That's where a lot of these frameworks come from is because it's me trying to make

[05:14] sense of the world in a way that I can remember. If your behavior doesn't change in a result of

[05:17] reading a book, then it means you'd learn nothing, which means it was a waste of time. And many

[05:20] people who read books are just wasting their time because their behavior doesn't change. And so I can

[05:24] sell it once I find something that's good, I plug everything I possibly can into and suck the juice out of it.

[05:29] So that I can change my behavior as a result, which comes from the frameworks and how I think about it.

[05:33] How deeply do you understand the knowledge of the book? There's a handful of books that if you just

[05:36] did them for the rest of your life, you would win. Because if you just did how to make friends and

[05:39] influence people and you put it into your DNA, you would be successful. Number five is that most

[05:43] champions do not have something that you do not. They lack something that you have. It's a different

[05:47] thought process. Because if all of us have the exact same hours per day, it means that they're

[05:50] allocating their time differently. Many times they eliminate things that you are still doing. They

[05:55] have sacrificed more. They have given up things that you have continued to have on your tree

[06:00] as branches that are distracting from growing up. Champions, when I look at the people who are

[06:04] further ahead of me, they're even more ruthless with their time. They even have lower tolerance

[06:07] for friends, family, people around them that are not at the bar that they hold themselves to. For me,

[06:12] going through college or when I was younger, I always thought it was about adding to your play.

[06:16] Saying yes to everything, saying yes to opportunity, say yes, say yes. When all I did was I just

[06:20] completely got distracted and spread super thin. What most champions have is singular focus,

[06:25] and they're willing to say no to everything else. And that took me too long to learn. Six is that

[06:29] goodwill compounds faster than money. Like if you actually think about what goodwill is,

[06:33] it's that you have positive sentiment and you have a degree of influence over a person's behavior.

[06:38] That's what goodwill is. If one person has goodwill with you and then shares your stuff with

[06:42] somebody else and you create goodwill in that next person, you can double your goodwill or

[06:47] 10x your goodwill in a matter of 12 weeks. 10xing your money in a matter 12 weeks is very,

[06:52] very unlikely. Goodwill because it's based on audiences and humans can compound significantly

[06:56] faster than money can. And when I realized that that goodwill could be translated into money,

[07:00] if I so desired at a future date, that I realized that rather than focusing on the money that I'm

[07:04] trying to make today, why don't I focus on the compounding vehicle that compounded a much faster

[07:08] rate than money does, that compounds tax free by the way, building the audience's tax free,

[07:12] and then we need to choose to have the conversion event. You can do that at your own choosing.

[07:16] But if you focus on the audience, you focus on the goodwill, that will go significantly faster than

[07:19] any kind of months very move. But you can still translate that later into money when you want.

[07:23] 7 is that you're going to die two weeks after you die. Most people have forgotten about you,

[07:28] and six months after you die, no one will talk about you. And if they're not carrying enough

[07:32] then, then it certainly doesn't matter what they think about your life now. Because if that's

[07:36] the most significant event that's going to happen in your life, which is that you stop living,

[07:39] how much credibility or weight should we give to other people's opinions on what we should do with

[07:44] our lives? My opinion, very little. Unless the person has a vested interest in seeing you succeed,

[07:49] comma and the context to provide the advice. Most of the times, it's just worth ignoring.

[07:53] Because they're trying to live their own life and they're projecting their own beliefs and experiences

[07:55] on you, and you spent all this time trying to improve your own view of reality through the beliefs

[08:00] that you've shed and shifted that they have not. And so what they believe to be true is what they're

[08:04] casting onto you. And if you don't like the life they have, then I don't think it's worth listening to.

[08:08] 8. Extraordinary accomplishments come from doing ordinary things for extraordinary periods of time.

[08:13] This is just me speaking about me, but when I was younger, my action showed that I was more impatient.

[08:17] I always was willing to sacrifice what I had today to get the quick buck. I was always

[08:22] a shifty like that because I just thought that that was how it worked. I thought there was some

[08:25] shortcut I didn't know about. And I would see the guys on stages being like, this is what we do.

[08:30] We do the basics. We do a lot of it. I was like, they're just trying to hold the secrets back.

[08:34] And I'm here to tell you that that is not true. Like I wish I could go and shake my college self and

[08:38] get like if you do one thing for a very long period of time, you will get very good at it.

[08:42] And it will compound onto itself. And maybe I would listen to me. I mean, if future self showed up in my

[08:46] living room now, I would totally listen to them. But you know what I mean? And so I can't do that.

[08:51] So the next thing I can do is try and shake you by the collar. The thing that makes the action

[08:55] extraordinary is the commitment to it, not the nature of the action itself. Working out and doing

[09:01] reps is not extraordinary. If you saw one set of a workout from me at the gym, you wouldn't think,

[09:05] oh, this guy is amazing. Look at them. Quad. It's the fact that you do it for 20 straight years.

[09:12] Is what compounds on itself. If you listen to one guy make one phone call, you listen to one

[09:16] majorly baseball player one at bat. Nothing about that is extraordinary. It's the dedication to

[09:20] doing it over and over and over and over again, despite feeling like there's better opportunities,

[09:25] despite people approaching you with new and exciting things, but saying that you're committed to the

[09:29] original vision you had. And that reality has not changed in such a way that your need to

[09:32] believes are no longer true. You said, I believe that X, Y is true. And as long as that remains to be true,

[09:37] then I will continue on this path for an extraordinary period of time. And that, not the action itself,

[09:41] but your commitment to the action is what makes someone extraordinary. Nine. If it's worth doing

[09:45] it's worth doing well. This is a really great saying. I shortcut it so much stuff when I was younger.

[09:50] I just wanted to like get it done, get it done, get it done, get it done, rather than doing it well.

[09:54] There's kind of two ways you can take the saying which is why I like it so much, is that if it's worth

[09:57] doing, it's worth doing well. Because many times I was doing things that were not worth doing.

[10:01] I didn't have the time to do things well because I was doing so many things that were not worth doing.

[10:06] The first criteria is, what problem are we solving? What am I hoping to accomplish? Is this worth

[10:12] doing at all? Because if it is worth doing, then I have to understand that to do it, come a right,

[10:17] to do it well, it's going to take this much time. Now, given that, is it still worth doing? And if

[10:22] it passes that test of any being worth doing in the long haul, and because it is worth doing worth

[10:27] doing well, then it gives us this lens to reach to see the activities we do, so that we can prioritize

[10:32] the things that will make us the most money or get us closer to the goals we have.

[10:36] And so younger me had more energy than me does now. I made way more money than younger me

[10:39] that, it's because I do fewer things and I do different things than I did then. And now, if I write a

[10:45] book, I'll take a year on writing the book because if it's worth doing, it's worth doing well.

[10:49] Because I understand that taking one year today will mean that that book might sit and sell and

[10:54] distribute itself to millions of people over the next 50 years or 100 years or after I'm dead,

[11:00] compared to me just putting words on a page that are pretty good and then shipping it. And I think

[11:05] the vast majority of people don't get the difference between good and great. The ocean between

[11:08] good work and great work is vast. It's five times 10 times the work to go from something good

[11:14] to something great, which is why you have to be really selective about the few things you choose to

[11:17] do that are worth doing and in being worth doing worth doing well. 10, be willing to negotiate

[11:23] everything except for your values. And so there were so many things when I was coming up that like

[11:27] in college, even right after college, his jobs, like I always just took things at face value.

[11:33] So prices, terms, relationships, everything. I took it face value. So whatever someone presented,

[11:39] I said, yes or no to. I have now realized that virtually everything is negotiating. People present

[11:45] with basically their best bad guess and they're hoping that someone takes them by the hand it says,

[11:48] you know, that makes no sense. What if we did it this way? What problem are you solving

[11:52] what problem I solving? And then ask the right questions to get someone else's true desires and

[11:56] wants and then knowing what your own true desires and wants and what you're willing to give up,

[12:00] allows you to make better deals. And so I used to think of negotiating as a zero-sum game and

[12:04] it's not at all. You can find the way where both parties get better than they were before,

[12:08] which is the entire point. That is how negotiating works if you're doing it well. And so I didn't

[12:13] understand that. I thought everything was an arm wrestle. I thought everything was like this for that

[12:16] tip for tat, like no give and I also thought really short about it. I was like I was trying to get

[12:21] one over as ruthless with vendors. I swung the other direction. So first I didn't negotiate anything.

[12:26] And then I found out you could negotiate and then try to get everyone to give me their last penny.

[12:30] But then I realized that this long term doesn't create good relationships and they will not be

[12:34] loyal to you at all, which long term has a more negative impact than giving them the extra

[12:38] 10% of having an amicable relationship. You want to negotiate everything except for your values.

[12:42] I negated everything in that second example, including my values. Because I was doing business

[12:47] in a way that was contrary to the values that I wanted to espouse to want to embody.

[12:50] Because the deals we do with that was just not a con for example, like I could probably ask

[12:54] for significantly more than I do. And I have had many times to be like, I want to give you

[12:57] good. So I'm like, I don't want that. Because I don't think you know what that means. This is what I

[13:01] think is fair today and in 10 years. And so it's balancing both your need today, your need in 10 years,

[13:08] and their need today, and their need in 10 years. And you have those four points that you try and

[13:12] find the closest point given your reality. And you can explain that this is how you're thinking

[13:17] through it with them. And I think they will appreciate all four data points on the map to come to the

[13:21] best solution for today and tomorrow. 11.

[13:27] Humility. This is a big one because I want to be a different voice on this because I have heard

[13:30] all over the internet recently. People saying, humility is stupid. If you looked up with the

[13:35] word means you wouldn't want to be it. Because if you look it up on Google, it says thinking

[13:38] less of oneself. This is why looking into finding terms is important. Because if you look at

[13:43] my webster, for example, it's lack of pride or arrogance. I don't think people would say you

[13:46] wouldn't want that. I'm like, no, I think I think people are okay not being prideful arrogant.

[13:50] I think that's okay. But even more so, and the definition that I have taken on is actually the exact

[13:54] opposite of that, which is it is not decreasing your regret for self, but increasing your regret

[13:59] for others. That's from Clayton Pristinson, who is a Harvard professor, go to a human. I thought

[14:03] that posturing when I was younger was the thing that would get people to like me. But what I realized

[14:08] later was that you gain status by giving more to the group than you get. This is especially

[14:14] true for guys. It's probably true for girls, but I can't speak to that. If you want to gain status,

[14:18] the way you do it is by sacrificing more for the group than everyone else does. If you want to gain

[14:22] status in a company, you give more to the company than anyone else does. More than the company

[14:27] gives you back. Because what do they do? They have a word that behavior. The group rewards the

[14:31] person who gives to the group. It's how it works. The people who take from the group, they only go

[14:35] in to get status from the group and end up getting banished by the group and bat it down because

[14:39] everyone wants to get that person down because they don't serve anyone else. And so it was only

[14:43] by realizing that I had to give my life in order to get it. I had to give status. I had to serve

[14:48] because when you serve someone you're giving them status. You're increasing your guard for others.

[14:51] When I gave status, I got it back. When I gave respect first, I would get respect back. And it

[14:57] was understanding that group dynamic, which is what made me present at the fraternity that I was in.

[15:01] All of these things started compounding when I realized that truth. And if you do that,

[15:05] I promise you, you will have all the status you want. 12. The happy man has the thousand

[15:10] wishes the sad man has won. This is a little bit more of a heartful one for me because when I was

[15:15] younger, I was definitely angry or probably darker in general. And a lot of that came because I had

[15:21] expectations that were fictitious, real or otherwise from other people in my mind that existed.

[15:26] We're constantly judging the behaviors and actions I was doing every day. And we're telling

[15:29] me that I was not enough. In some ways, that created and reinforced behaviors that I still continue

[15:34] this day in terms of the actions I take. But the way that I feel and think about them has shifted.

[15:38] When you are sad, you want to not be sad. That's the main focus. You want to feel better. And many

[15:45] times people will take the short term way of getting out of that, which is alcohol, drugs, etc.

[15:49] because in the moment they can feel better. Everyone just wants to feel better. And so when I think

[15:53] about things that I used to think people were wronging me, right? You know, angry, that's been

[15:57] my self out. I use a different frame now, which is they just wanted to feel better. Do you think

[16:02] it had nothing to do with me? And they just wanted to feel better about themselves? And that's

[16:05] given me a lot of peace about many of the things that used to anger me. Being able to quiet

[16:09] the hundreds of non-existent voices in my head that were constantly judging the activities that I

[16:13] was doing and labeling them good or bad or good enough or not good enough, etc. took up a tremendous

[16:18] amount of my attention. And because of that, all of my focus was on feeling better. And so I couldn't

[16:22] actually have any energy left over to do stuff because all I was focused on was feeling better.

[16:27] And all I was spending all my day was in my head trying to not feel like shit and doing both

[16:31] short and long-term things to do that. And so it was only when I came up with the mantra, which I

[16:36] have said before, but fuck happiness, which sounds ironic because I said the person who's happy

[16:39] as a thousand wishes. But in choosing not to admit the deficiency between my current state and the

[16:45] future state of what I desire to be, I was able to accept where I was. And then the deficiency

[16:50] of not being good enough, not being happy enough, disintegrated in my mind. And then I was able

[16:53] to focus on just doing things. And then when I started doing things, I started making progress.

[16:59] When I started making progress, I started looking back and feeling proud of a farad coat.

[17:03] Because it wasn't about the many voices outside, it was about the only one that matters.

[17:06] And so that shift is what I think genuinely from a spiritual standpoint is the thing that was

[17:10] able to give me the strength to do some of the things we have done. But I wouldn't have been able

[17:15] to ever start on this path because I was paralyzed about what I thought other people were to think

[17:18] about me. Only to realize that they weren't thinking about me at all.

[17:21] 13 failure, leads to learning, learning leads to success, success leads to complacency,

[17:27] complacency leads to failure. And so a lot of times, I'm a reused thinking that like there was a

[17:31] destination. But I think the actual entrepreneurial cycle is not a destination, it's not a

[17:35] destination, it's not linear, it's cyclical. And so that's why I talk about entrepreneurship in terms

[17:38] of seasons. Because there are cycles where you learn a lot, right now you just say this a lot

[17:42] where I'd say either the business is growing or I am. Either I have learned lessons and I am

[17:46] applying those lessons to the business and the business is growing. Or the business is not growing

[17:50] and has problems. And now I am the one receiving the lessons from the business and until I learn

[17:54] the lesson that I'm supposed to learn, the business will cease to grow. Until I have learned this lesson

[17:58] until I beat this boss at this level. And the difference between video games and real life is that

[18:01] sometimes in order to beat that boss you're not doing it in 10 minutes and might take you 10 years.

[18:05] Recognizing that you were not above the cycle, but that that cycle is inevitable. Because you have

[18:10] failure, learning, success, complacency. The goal is if you can identify that, how quickly can you get back

[18:15] to learning success, learning success, and try to skip the complacency step altogether. It still happens

[18:20] to a degree. When I can start feeling the feelings and it's rearing its head, I'm aware of it

[18:24] and then it allows me to speed through it faster. And to the same degree, I stop labeling things

[18:27] is good or bad because if I'm failing, it means I'm about to go through learning. And I see learning

[18:31] is good. And on the flip side, if I'm succeeding, I succeed in it is good. And so either way they

[18:35] lead to my success and framing it that way took a lot of the judgment and the label and the depression

[18:40] around not achievement away from it. And also, when things are good, it allowed me to not be so high

[18:46] on my supply because I knew that whenever things were good, everything is good is followed by

[18:50] something that is not as good. And so you always have aggression to the meat, right? You have

[18:53] aggression to the meat. And so things are amazing that it means they can only come down from here.

[18:57] If things are terrible, it means you can only go up.

[18:59] 14 is that I would pay any amount of money to make obvious truths real for me.

[19:04] There is a reality that no one can see right now. True reality. And no one can see it because

[19:09] we are shaped by the many things that we've been told throughout our lives and many of those things

[19:12] were not true. Much of the path of entrepreneurship in my opinion is shedding these false truths

[19:17] so that you can see the world more clearly. If you see these business people were super far ahead,

[19:21] and all of a sudden it's like they can lose it and then they can get it all back again and things

[19:23] seem so seamless for them. It's because they have a more accurate view of reality than you do.

[19:29] And so imagine trying to hit a target with a blindfold on. You're just going to keep missing

[19:33] and keep missing and keep missing. Now imagine there's a guy next to you who's got a blindfold

[19:36] on too, but it's clear. And he's just kneeling it. And you're like, what the hell? I'm doing the same

[19:41] thing with my wrist. I'm doing it. You know, I've got all this technique down. It's simply

[19:44] because he sees the target and he sees all the environment around it more clearly than you do. And

[19:49] for me the whole concept of ignorance tax and ignorance debt has been one that I have taken with

[19:54] me for life and I actually heard this a speaker said this on stage and he was actually using

[19:58] as a close for the audience. He said how much is not making a million dollars a year costing you.

[20:04] He said, well if you make $50,000 a year right now, said it cost you $950,000 a year to not know

[20:10] how to make a million dollars. I thought about that and I was like shit, we were paying a debt

[20:14] service to a false reality in order to get the real one. And so for me, I will pay any amount of money

[20:21] to speed that process up to see the world more clearly in a way that is true. And if the views that I

[20:26] have do not serve me and someone else is further ahead of me in the game than they are better

[20:31] at the game of business than me in some way in that way, I can learn of them. It doesn't matter

[20:36] what they're doing. Some people were like, oh, this guy's a nethical, this guy's a

[20:39] you can learn from everyone. If they're making more money than you, you can learn from them. And so

[20:43] taking that and taking my ego head off, right, taking my ego head off and saying like, I'm the

[20:47] student here. This guy's better in some way. What does she believe to be true about the world I

[20:51] don't or what do I believe to be true that is it? And simply trying to observe to see those

[20:56] realities is something that I will always pay for. If you're a company and you're doing $10

[20:59] million dollars or more, acquisition.com would like to have to get $200 million. If that's you,

[21:03] go to acquisition.com, everybody else enjoy all the free stuff.

[00:00] If people have to treat you a certain way for you to be happy, then it means that your happiness is in their hands.

[00:07] I get asked about mindset a lot on podcasts.

[00:10] When you're building a business or building your career, there are stressors that come into play.

[00:14] How we manage the circumstances or the conditions that come to us dictates how our life turns out.

[00:18] Everybody has bad stuff happen.

[00:20] You probably believed in nodded your head like, yeah, everyone has stuff happened.

[00:23] And then we choose to make it better good.

[00:25] Imagine for a second, two children that are playing.

[00:28] One child tells the other child, your nose is really big.

[00:31] Where your fat, interesting is that the child who hears it is unaffected and the child who says it is unaffected.

[00:38] They're like, you're fat.

[00:39] And he's like, huh, parent comes in and over hears it.

[00:42] And she's like, oh my god, takes the child that was called fat.

[00:47] Pumfords, them, gives them the expectation that they should be upset.

[00:50] And then tells the other one that that was bad.

[00:53] And in a moment, there was something that is now traumatic that otherwise wouldn't have been.

[00:57] And when we're kids, we walk in the world with no meaning.

[01:00] All we do is we observe.

[01:01] And then whatever the adults around us tell us and say this means that we take it's fact.

[01:06] And it's not true.

[01:07] It's their interpretation of the world and we inherit them.

[01:09] And then we spend the rest of our life trying to undo and examine these beliefs that we have been told by people that we probably don't agree with.

[01:16] When something bothers you, pull it out and look at and say, what happened and why is this bad?

[01:22] And what would it look like if it were good?

[01:24] And so the two tools that I use are time and volume.

[01:28] The volume example is thinking, okay, I'm in traffic.

[01:32] If this happened every day, would I be upset?

[01:35] If it happened every day, I'd probably expect it, which means that I would not be upset about it because this just how things always are.

[01:40] If you want to make it positive, you say, well, what if every time I got into car normally would take an hour?

[01:44] And today it took 30 minutes.

[01:45] I'd be pretty excited about it.

[01:47] And so all we did is just change the volume on the circumstance to recalibrate the meaning that we're choosing to a certain amount of time.

[01:51] To recalibrate the meaning that we're choosing to ascribe to it good or bad.

[01:55] I like to think of circumstances a lot like weather, which is like you've got sunny days and you've got rainy days.

[02:02] And the problem in my opinion is that people any day that rains, they say, is bad.

[02:06] And any day that sunny, they say, is good.

[02:08] When in reality, it just is.

[02:10] It's just the weather.

[02:11] Contrast is what create the quote, good and bad.

[02:14] When reality, there's just a middle line and half of its above and half of its above.

[02:18] Then what we can do is artificially move the line in our minds by saying whatever this circumstance is, what would it look like if it were worse?

[02:25] And what would it look like if it were worse all the time?

[02:28] And if so, then maybe today's a good thing.

[02:30] The second frame that I like to use is time.

[02:32] A hundred years out, but 10,000 years out, how much is this going to matter?

[02:36] The reason something affects you is because you have deemed it meaningful.

[02:39] You've said it matters.

[02:41] It's my world view that nothing matters with the capital M.

[02:44] Like nothing matters in the universe.

[02:46] It doesn't matter.

[02:47] There's this statue of a head that's in the stands of Egypt.

[02:50] It's bigger than this whole room.

[02:52] It's just the head.

[02:53] It's worn out and then it's scripted along the forehead to hear lies, crazy name.

[02:58] Who owned everything that the eye could see, the immortal sounds of.

[03:02] And the only thing that was left was a worn out statue head that no one knew who he was.

[03:06] And it was 5,000 years old.

[03:08] If that guy who ruled the known world to him, wealth probably mattered, right?

[03:13] But does it matter?

[03:15] No, probably not.

[03:16] I've relieved a lot of the pressure in my life so that I could make better decisions by zooming

[03:20] way out and thinking 10,000 years from now, will this matter?

[03:23] And if the answer is no, does it matter to me?

[03:26] And then if I can make the decision of like good or bad, based on my new context that I created,

[03:30] then I can live a life a lot easier.

[03:32] And so for me that helped me decrease anxiety, it helped me decrease sadness around certain circumstances.

[03:37] And I'll give you the last example of this.

[03:39] So I'd a cat named Bill, chill Bill, rest of the piece.

[03:42] Tell me, love the cat.

[03:43] He died, six and free cart thing or something.

[03:45] So he died in like two years.

[03:47] When he died, I was bought, I was like this sucks.

[03:50] Then I thought to myself, what if cats only normally live six months?

[03:53] How stoked would I be that he lived four times the normal length of a normal cat?

[03:56] I was like, I probably really stuck on Bill, like, dude, he lived a long life.

[03:59] I can't believe we had him this long.

[04:00] And all of a sudden, my perspective around the death completely changed.

[04:02] I was like, I was still grateful that I got to have him this long as I did.

[04:05] When you play with time and you play with volume, first off, we have to be aware of the levers of meaning that exist.

[04:11] And then once you're aware of them, you can start moving up in your favor and then looking at your current conditions through different lenses and say,

[04:17] what would this mean if it were amazing?

[04:18] What would the conditions have to be in order for this to be an awesome thing?

[04:21] And then all of a sudden, you just exit the game of happy sad and get to be your own game maker.

[04:26] At least that's what I tried to do when I get upset.

[04:28] Look at it, pull it apart, thing like, is this real, is this true?

[04:32] Is anyone doing this perfectly?

[04:33] No.

[04:34] But simply being aware of the fact, gives you a lot more control over your own perception of light.

[04:40] And the conditions that are presented to you.

[00:00] What's going on, Mose Nation?

[00:01] This is Alex Hormose, your host and most legit YouTuber

[00:06] with the best setup in existence, including my mom's basement.

[00:10] I'm kidding, this is a $5 million condo,

[00:11] and I just happen to not like Windows,

[00:13] where I work, that being said,

[00:15] the purpose of this video is to blow up some of the things

[00:18] that I saw online with relation to,

[00:21] how to make more money when it comes to getting a raise

[00:25] if you are an employee.

[00:26] Number one, one, two, getting a raise

[00:28] from your customers as a business owner,

[00:30] because at the end of the day, all of us

[00:32] are still beholden to our customers that we serve.

[00:34] And so if you don't know why I am an Epsilon,

[00:36] ZION acquisition.com, it's a portfolio of companies

[00:38] that's over $100 million a year,

[00:39] and I make these videos because I think it's fun.

[00:42] So let's rock and roll.

[00:44] So I think the easiest way to solve this dilemma

[00:46] or this problem for not getting paid enough

[00:48] is to understand what are the variables

[00:50] that influence pay, right?

[00:51] Right, damn right.

[00:52] And so I think a fun process is to go through this

[00:56] and think about it using inversion thinking,

[00:58] all right, which is something that Charlie Munger champions

[01:00] and a lot of other great thinkers.

[01:01] And so if we wanted to, and this would be the problem

[01:04] that we're solving for, if we wanted to make

[01:06] as little money as humanly possible,

[01:07] and we were employees and or business owners,

[01:10] what would we do?

[01:11] Well, number one, we would provide very little value.

[01:14] All right, there'll be the first thing that we do

[01:15] is we'd have, we'd have skill set

[01:17] that just does not provide a significant amount of value

[01:19] to a business and or to a customer.

[01:21] All right, let's let's first off, is what we would do.

[01:23] The second thing that we would do

[01:25] is we would not ask for very much of that

[01:27] value that we were creating.

[01:28] So hopefully we're creating some level of value,

[01:30] which is why we're getting employed or where

[01:32] why we were asked to solve some problem for a customer, right?

[01:35] We're solving a problem, there's a job to be done.

[01:38] That is the value, that is the potential amount of money

[01:40] that we can earn.

[01:41] The amount of that potential money that we earn

[01:43] is predicated based on our ability to negotiate.

[01:47] And so we ask for a very small amount of that money.

[01:50] All right, so low value and then of that small number,

[01:53] we ask even for a smaller percentage of that number

[01:55] because of our ability to negotiate.

[01:58] That would normally be the only two things that you think,

[02:00] okay, well, this is my potential,

[02:02] and this is how much I ask for.

[02:03] And so there's the only two variables

[02:05] that would create how much I'm getting paid.

[02:07] Ah, but there's a third, all right,

[02:09] and I'm gonna get to the three

[02:10] and how you can flip this at the end of the video.

[02:12] All right, but the third one that we're gonna look at

[02:14] is supply demand dynamics, meaning how easily replaceable

[02:19] is the value that we're providing.

[02:21] And so in an unideal world, in bizarre land

[02:24] where we wanna get paid as little as possible,

[02:25] using inversion thinking, we would one have low value,

[02:28] to ask for very little of it and three,

[02:31] have a line of people standing behind us,

[02:33] the opposite of scarcity, right?

[02:35] Working against us, we are commoditized.

[02:37] Our skill is easily found and easily replaced

[02:41] by other willing people who want to do it for less money, right?

[02:44] Because they hate us, they hate the economy,

[02:46] they hate capitalism, and they hate generally moving up in life, okay?

[02:51] So if you are an employee or you are a business owner

[02:55] and you are trying to get paid more,

[02:57] then we can invert this process and think to ourselves,

[03:00] what are the ways that we can, number one, create more value,

[03:04] which I wrote a whole book about, all right,

[03:05] 100 million offers, 99 cents if you wanna.

[03:07] Number two, is how do we negotiate?

[03:11] Now we have a high potential value that we are creating, right?

[03:14] So we've now, we've flipped the equation,

[03:16] we're creating tremendous amount of value for the person.

[03:19] Now, one of the keys in communicating value

[03:22] is using multiple lenses to search to see it, all right?

[03:25] So it's not just about, and the easiest one is just the quantitative

[03:30] number value in terms of how much money are we creating, right?

[03:35] How much money are we helping to produce?

[03:37] All right, so that is monetary value.

[03:38] There are other forms of value, right?

[03:40] There's lots of services out there that exist

[03:42] that especially consumer services,

[03:44] where there is no direct amount of value,

[03:46] but there's indirect value.

[03:47] So if you help someone lose weight,

[03:49] the amount that you can charge on that will depend on who you serve, right?

[03:52] Which would then actually get into a fourth bucket,

[03:54] which is picking the right customers, right?

[03:56] And I'll tell you a quick story about this,

[03:58] but for I die back in, I think you'll like the tangent.

[04:01] So there's a boy, and he's 16 years old,

[04:03] and he's looking to get his first car,

[04:06] and his father, one day,

[04:08] surprises him with a vehicle, right?

[04:10] So he's super excited, he sees the car,

[04:12] but it's a little bit of a clunker, it's an old car, right?

[04:15] But he's fine with it.

[04:16] And the dad says, hey,

[04:17] if you want, you can go cash this in,

[04:20] and then use the money to get something else if you want.

[04:22] And he says, okay, so he says, hey,

[04:24] why don't you just go down to the car a lot,

[04:27] and see what they'll give you for it?

[04:30] So he goes over the car a lot,

[04:31] excited to see what they'll trade the car in for,

[04:34] and they said, you know what,

[04:36] we'll give you $5,000 for the car, and he goes like,

[04:38] okay, so he goes back to his dad,

[04:40] tells him the story, he says, okay, son,

[04:42] we'll want you to try the pawn shop,

[04:44] see what they'll give you for it, like the scrapyard.

[04:46] So he goes over to the pawn shop, slash scrapyard, right?

[04:50] Goes there, and he asked the same question,

[04:53] he says, you know, this is the car,

[04:54] how much can you get for it?

[04:55] And they're like, well, probably give you $1,000,

[04:57] it's just for like the parts in the metal.

[04:58] And he's like, so he walks back to feedly to his dad,

[05:01] he's like, you know, it's only worth $1,000,

[05:02] so those guys, that says, hmm,

[05:04] what'd you go down to that antique dealership?

[05:06] See what they say?

[05:07] So he goes to the antique dealership, shows on the car,

[05:10] and they say, oh my God, this is historic XYZ car.

[05:14] There's only this many of them ever made,

[05:16] this is $200,000 vehicle.

[05:17] The kid blown out of his mind, runs back home,

[05:20] he's like, dad, you won't believe it.

[05:22] And the dad's miles, I mean, he's like, what?

[05:23] I was like, they say this car's unbelievably valuable,

[05:26] it's historic, it's like one of a kind, blah, blah, blah, blah,

[05:29] and so the dad pauses and says, so listen, son,

[05:31] what I want you to see from this is that the value

[05:34] that someone will give you is not necessarily just

[05:37] a result of the vehicle, of who you are,

[05:40] but who you were talking to.

[05:41] And so a hidden bonus of this video that I'm gonna give you

[05:45] right now is that there are three who's what I said,

[05:47] but the fourth one is who we are serving.

[05:50] So the amount that you can charge if you are a business owner

[05:52] will be also predicated in who you serve.

[05:55] If you can help a billionaire, lose weight,

[05:57] he will probably pay you more than somebody who's on

[06:00] who's on unemployment, right?

[06:01] It's just the nature of that problem,

[06:03] to that person is more valuable to solve, right?

[06:06] And that's because indirectly for them,

[06:08] if that helps the billionaire, right, get his wife,

[06:12] which he might value more, right?

[06:13] Or he might be able to seal the deal

[06:15] because people respect him or whatever it is, right?

[06:17] Then there is more indirect value that you can

[06:19] ascribe to the services that are being provided.

[06:21] Okay, so I said there were three,

[06:24] but there's actually four,

[06:25] because I'm trying to keep you interested in the video, right?

[06:27] Keep you going, keep you guessing, all right?

[06:29] But so I said, number one was value, okay?

[06:31] So value is gonna be predicated on who we're serving

[06:33] and also how much value we can provide,

[06:36] which is gonna come into, what's the dream out

[06:38] and we're providing them, how likely do they think

[06:40] that they're gonna get that with you as an employee

[06:42] and or as a business that they're hiring

[06:44] because all of us are doing jobs, all of us are employees,

[06:46] right, in one way or another.

[06:48] How quickly we can get that done?

[06:50] And then how much work they have to do is resolve to that,

[06:52] which you can translate in a couple ways.

[06:54] If you're an employee and someone always has to check up

[06:55] when you're in always has to give you direct instructions,

[06:57] that is less valuable than employee,

[06:59] then somebody, then employee who's coming with the ideas,

[07:01] can get things done quickly,

[07:03] I have a large amount of confidence

[07:04] that someone's gonna do the job,

[07:06] and the perceived outcome that I want to create

[07:08] that employee can duplicate quickly.

[07:09] Awesome, so that's, you can reverse the value equation

[07:12] that I talk about the book,

[07:13] whether you're working for a customer or you're working

[07:15] for a boss, either of those things.

[07:17] And I'll get to how you can make more money

[07:18] as an employee in a second, okay?

[07:20] So one, we're flipping the inversion to,

[07:22] we create lots of value.

[07:23] Number two is going to be, how much we ask for, all right,

[07:26] so how much we negotiate.

[07:27] And so as a business, we do this by setting our prices, right?

[07:32] That is fundamentally the negotiation that occurs

[07:34] as we set our prices.

[07:36] And a lot of times you'd be amazed

[07:37] that just asking for more, you get more, right?

[07:39] Because most people saw from their own wallet

[07:41] as they think this is a lot of money

[07:42] and therefore they ask for what they believe is a lot of money.

[07:44] And here's the fundamental fallacy with this problem.

[07:47] What comes easy to you is typically not easy for other people.

[07:51] And so I'll give you a simple example personally.

[07:54] I am not a car guy.

[07:56] I am not a fix-it guy.

[07:57] I just don't care.

[07:59] And so if I went to a mechanic shop

[08:01] and they said, hey, we've got a change or oil

[08:04] and do X, Y, Z in your car,

[08:06] it's gonna be 100 bucks.

[08:07] If they say 100 bucks, 300 bucks,

[08:09] it really isn't gonna,

[08:10] like I've not gonna notice I'm not gonna care.

[08:12] But if you talk to another mechanic,

[08:14] they're like, you charge that guy $200 to change his oil.

[08:17] That's crazy.

[08:18] It only takes two seconds.

[08:18] And all you have to do is turn the knob

[08:19] and oil comes out and then pour back in whatever.

[08:22] And it's because to them,

[08:24] to a mechanic, changing oil.

[08:26] Seems like a very easy thing to do.

[08:27] And it probably is.

[08:28] But to me, it's something that is gonna take me time

[08:31] to learn that I don't care.

[08:32] And so what is easy to one person

[08:34] because you have been doing it for so long

[08:36] might not necessarily be easy to other people.

[08:38] And so your perception of the value is actually skewed,

[08:41] which is why you should not be the one

[08:43] necessarily setting your prices.

[08:44] You will allow the market to set the prices

[08:46] for your services and or the pay that you get.

[08:48] So number one, we provide lots of value.

[08:50] Number two, you negotiate or ask for a higher amount.

[08:54] Okay, and if you're an employee and easy way to do that

[08:56] is create some sort of variable compensation for yourself

[08:59] and say, hey, these are ways that I think I can

[09:01] tie into the revenue of the business.

[09:03] Would it be fair?

[09:03] Would it be unreasonable?

[09:05] For me to ask for a percentage of that,

[09:07] not for the whole necessarily the whole company,

[09:08] but at least in this way,

[09:09] so that I can drive towards those goals

[09:11] which are ultimately make the company more money.

[09:13] Which is exactly what we're doing is,

[09:15] when we serve customers, right?

[09:17] Especially if you're gonna be to be services.

[09:18] You see, listen, I think that this thing will yield

[09:21] this amount of result and I would like a percentage of that.

[09:23] And it's variable compensation.

[09:24] So the best way in the highest people who make the most money

[09:27] have variable compensation, business owners,

[09:28] have variable compensation depends on how well your business

[09:30] does and how much you serve your customers.

[09:32] The business itself is variable compensation, right?

[09:35] The enterprise value.

[09:36] So if you can shift your thinking around this,

[09:38] it will pay dividends.

[09:39] So value, negotiation, scale, and the third one,

[09:42] which is competitive landscape, competitive dynamics

[09:44] or supply demand for the job to be done.

[09:47] All right?

[09:48] So think about this way.

[09:48] If I have lots of people who can do the job,

[09:51] if I have somebody who comes up to me,

[09:53] let's say they're an employee.

[09:54] And they say, hey, I'm providing lots of value

[09:56] and I would like to ask for more.

[09:58] I would not have leverage on this situation

[10:00] if there was 20 other people who were lined up

[10:02] who could do the job and were willing to accept less.

[10:05] Which is why this applies for both labor

[10:06] as it does for owning a business.

[10:08] It's both sides, right?

[10:09] If I want to provide XYZ service

[10:12] and there's another guy who's willing to provide XYZ

[10:13] service for less and there's nothing

[10:16] that really differentiates us, then most consumers

[10:18] will just go to the one that costs less.

[10:20] Which brings up the important lesson

[10:22] of how do you invert this, how do we solve this problem?

[10:24] Which is we have to be an encategory of one.

[10:27] All right?

[10:28] And so we do this by trying to niche down

[10:29] and create more specialized services

[10:31] because then we decrease the pool of people

[10:33] that we were competing against.

[10:34] Now, as you scale up in a business,

[10:36] I'm gonna answer this as a business

[10:38] and also for employees, as you scale up in a business,

[10:40] you do in general go broader,

[10:41] but usually you can use the experience,

[10:43] the depth of knowledge you have,

[10:44] and then be able to be better at that stuff

[10:47] at a larger scale.

[10:49] And so the easiest thing to do,

[10:50] which is why I talk about this in the book,

[10:52] is is niche down at first, right?

[10:54] So that we can get really, really good

[10:56] at delivering one very specific high amount of value

[10:59] to a very specific customer, right?

[11:00] And so when we do that, we basically fall into

[11:04] creating lots of value, we price high,

[11:06] so we're asking for a bigger percentage

[11:07] of the value that we're now creating.

[11:09] And we're doing it as a category of one,

[11:11] in that there's no other people who can do it.

[11:12] And so we add other features and bells and whistles

[11:15] and bonuses and guarantees to create offers

[11:17] that are more compelling to a customer

[11:19] that are one of a kind, which make it more difficult

[11:21] for other people to compete against us.

[11:23] And thereby allow us to capture a larger percentage

[11:26] of the value that we are creating.

[11:28] That's the idea, that's the point.

[11:30] Now, after you're an employee,

[11:31] and you walk through this process,

[11:33] then the idea is, how can I use my unique unique being

[11:36] the key skills and experiences to make the business

[11:40] that I'm working for more money?

[11:42] Right, because ultimately, that is,

[11:43] I mean, that's where you're getting compensated.

[11:45] It's a percentage of the revenue

[11:46] that you were responsible for, right?

[11:48] Indirectly or directly, and the more directly,

[11:49] you can be associated with it, the more you will get compensated

[11:51] because the more clearly you can point

[11:54] to the value that you are creating, right?

[11:56] Because the more direct it is, the less argumentation

[11:59] or discount that will be applied to the value

[12:01] that you're creating for the business, right?

[12:02] Does that make sense?

[12:03] Hopefully it makes sense.

[12:03] Okay? So, if we are an employee,

[12:06] and we want to make more money,

[12:08] then we're going to use our unique skills and experiences,

[12:11] and we're going to try and quantify

[12:14] to the highest degree possible

[12:15] how we can directly impact the bottom line of the business.

[12:18] We're going to ask for a variable compensation

[12:20] around the value that we are providing for the business,

[12:23] which just works the same if you're a business,

[12:25] and we're going to be able to get it,

[12:27] and this is the third piece here.

[12:28] The reason that we're going to be able to get it

[12:30] is because no one else can do it.

[12:32] And that's the idea.

[12:34] And so this also kind of brings in that part

[12:36] that the bonus number four, which is the type of opportunity

[12:39] that you are pursuing in terms of the overarching umbrella

[12:42] of business that you were working for

[12:43] will also dictate how much you get paid, right?

[12:45] Like if you work at a dry cleaning business,

[12:48] it will be very difficult for you to make a million dollars a year,

[12:51] and that's because the business doesn't make a million dollars

[12:53] year in all likelihood, right?

[12:55] And so your opportunity vehicle will always be a subset

[12:58] of the business opportunity that you're working underneath of.

[13:00] And I think this is a good thing to hit on,

[13:03] because what it takes, which is a great book

[13:05] by Stuart Swordsman, Stephen Swordsman.

[13:08] It's starting, the guy started a blackstone.

[13:10] Okay, anyways, that guy is worth $37 billion today.

[13:14] So he's pretty rich.

[13:16] And he's pretty good.

[13:16] And what he talks about is the idea,

[13:19] and I think many other visionaries have said this,

[13:21] but you need to have a vision that is big enough

[13:22] for your business that others people, visions fit inside of it.

[13:26] And so what that really means is that you need

[13:27] to have a pie that's big enough that everyone can go wealthy.

[13:30] And if you're operating in an opportunity vehicle

[13:32] that does not allow other people to go wealthy,

[13:34] then you will probably not attract 10 out of 10 talent.

[13:36] And if you are 10 out of 10 talent,

[13:38] then maybe you should be looking for bigger visions,

[13:41] bigger visionaries, bigger companies who have

[13:43] bigger goals and bigger dreams,

[13:45] so that you can learn union expertise

[13:48] while working at those businesses,

[13:49] because listening to Uncle Warren,

[13:50] there's only two things you should be working for,

[13:52] whether you're learning or you're earning.

[13:54] Right, so you should get paid in one or two

[13:56] or ideally both ways when you work,

[13:58] which you should be learning all the time,

[13:59] and you should be earning.

[14:00] And it should definitely at least be one of those two things.

[14:03] And if you're not learning and you're not earning,

[14:05] you should stop working wherever you're working.

[14:06] All right, which is why we're seeing a precipitous drop

[14:08] in, I would say, front line, retail,

[14:11] very generic workers, last two months,

[14:13] I think of eight million people quit their jobs

[14:15] in those kind of front line sectors,

[14:17] because the opportunity was not big enough.

[14:19] And so for us, we can think about this as business owners,

[14:22] when we're thinking about our employees,

[14:23] we can think about this as business owners

[14:25] as we're communicating values for our customers,

[14:27] which is how can I create the value?

[14:28] How can I capture the value through my pricing

[14:31] and my ability to negotiate?

[14:32] And then how can I create a category?

[14:33] Once I'm not competing,

[14:34] it's everyone else's shitty prices.

[14:36] And so as the employee, we do the exact same thing,

[14:39] except our prices are the wages that we charge.

[14:41] And so in that way, being a business owner

[14:44] or an employee actually is very similar,

[14:46] it's just that we are just one degree separated

[14:48] from the customer.

[14:49] So the business owner is closer to the customer

[14:52] than the employee that works for the business

[14:54] from evaluation standpoint.

[14:56] Business serves the customer, employee serves the business,

[14:59] right?

[15:00] And they do that, I say that as a big picture perspective,

[15:03] even though the employee may directly be servicing the customer,

[15:06] they do it within the overarching infrastructure

[15:08] of the business that exists.

[15:10] And so right now, if you want to make more money,

[15:13] you want to get paid more,

[15:14] whether you are a business owner or an employee,

[15:16] think about how you measure up in each of those three dynamics.

[15:19] And if you're like, how do I create more value?

[15:20] I read a book about it, it's 99 cents,

[15:22] you can grab it if you want to turn Amazon,

[15:23] it's 4,000, 5 star reviews, I think people like it at least.

[15:26] Release, they just like leaving five star reviews for it.

[15:28] So either way, I'm cool with it.

[15:29] Ideally, they like it though.

[15:31] But that's about the value creation.

[15:33] Your ability to negotiate honestly,

[15:34] like you could have all the tips in the world,

[15:36] I'll tell you the simplest law of negotiation is this.

[15:39] He who has the most options wins the circumstance.

[15:41] And so your ability to get other customers,

[15:44] your ability to have other jobs if you're an employee.

[15:47] Those that you bring to the table prior to your negotiation

[15:51] will give you all the leverage you need.

[15:52] If you have 100 girls who are lined up to date you,

[15:55] or 100 guys who are lined up to date you,

[15:57] you have more leverage in the equal negotiation.

[15:59] If you have hundreds of other businesses who want you,

[16:02] you have far more abilities in negotiate,

[16:04] which is why people are like,

[16:05] how does this CEO make $50 million bonus

[16:07] or whatever from his public trade companies?

[16:09] It's like, well, do you know the amount of guys

[16:10] who can do that specific job?

[16:11] You can count on one hand in the entire planet.

[16:13] And said, that is why,

[16:14] because the supply demand on AMX for that specific role,

[16:17] and the value that's being created in the percentage

[16:19] that they negotiate, that's how that kind of money gets created.

[16:22] You can make up scene amounts of money

[16:24] as both a business owner and or an employee

[16:27] as long as you understand those three dynamics.

[16:29] All right, and as again, the added

[16:31] bonyed caveat to that is that those guys

[16:33] can make that kind of money

[16:34] because they're operating within a business

[16:36] that has a massive dream that is really to impact humanity

[16:39] overall, and lots of people can get wealthy in that.

[16:42] Both the owners and the employees

[16:44] because in a lot of ways, the compensation structure,

[16:46] the bonuses, options, things like that,

[16:47] the structure are based on variable compensation

[16:50] on the overall production of the business.

[16:53] All right, so lots of love everyone

[16:54] if you're new to Mozine Nation, welcome,

[16:56] and I will see you guys in the next video.

[16:58] Bye!

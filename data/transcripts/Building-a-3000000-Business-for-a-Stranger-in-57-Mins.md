[00:00] This is Ben. He's a cocktail consultant who helps restaurants and bars optimize their

[00:03] drink menus to increase profits. But his revenues unstable, sometimes he's a great

[00:07] month and then other times he sells nothing and sometimes it goes down. I'm Alex from

[00:10] Aussie, I would acquisition.com or portfolio companies that generate hundreds of millions

[00:15] of dollars per year in revenue. What I suspect Ben needs to work on is optimizing his

[00:20] funnel, fixing his offer, he's trying to sell a $30,000 thing to strangers who've never

[00:23] even worked with him before, which is pretty tough. And then once that all that stuff

[00:27] fixed, it's spending more on his actual marketing. So the first thing I'm going to do

[00:30] is dive deep into the business and then I'm going to break down all the tactics that he

[00:33] and you can use to scale your business to your dreams. Hey Alex, I'm Ben. I'm one of

[00:38] the co-founders of unfiltered hospitality where we help hospitality operators build

[00:43] better beverage programs. Tell me about the business. So we are bar and beverage program

[00:47] development specialists. In 2024 we did 1.1 million in revenue, 123,000 in net profit,

[00:53] so about 11.3% in net margins. We've been in business for about four and a half

[00:59] years, but we've helped over 200 bars launch or elevate their concepts. So what's the

[01:05] goal? We learned it. My goal? 3 million by the end of 2020. It's big goals. Yeah,

[01:10] triple this year. Yeah, triple this year. Rock and roll. So how do you get started? In 2008,

[01:15] I started my life in the world as an investment banker. Okay. And so I hated it. Quit

[01:20] my job there. Over the next seven years I worked in bar room restaurant to round the city.

[01:24] A few years after that, I opened my first bar. It was all going really well until 2020.

[01:29] Okay. Remember what happened then? It was just like the small pandemic. It's over now.

[01:34] So yeah. Fortunately, I got approached by a restaurant that was still operational and

[01:39] they said we need new cocktails. I said great. I'm very good at that. So I tapped my

[01:44] business partner, ghee, and so we started on filter hospitality. All right. Yeah. So who do

[01:48] you? We currently work with restaurants, hotels, bars, country clubs, cruise ships,

[01:54] nightclubs. If they have a bar, we help them. How do you help them? We help them by taking

[01:59] their bar programs from good to great. Phase one, which we call better cocktail consulting,

[02:05] takes 90 days. We design a cocktail menu for them. We train their teams and then we install

[02:10] an operating system to keep it all running smoothly. Phase one is better cocktail consulting,

[02:15] phase two. Phase two is what we call the program performance retainer. Okay. So the point of

[02:19] this is to maintain what we did with better cocktail consulting and then continue to develop

[02:24] the program. And we do that by having a weekly KPI call where we check the score card to see

[02:29] how well your metrics are doing. We also then provide seasonal monthly seasonal cocktails.

[02:35] We want to maintain the training. And so we have a quarterly training program where we fly

[02:38] out there and we significant. Train the team for two to three. You don't mind flying. That's good.

[02:43] Exactly. So I have an inkling that Ben needs to go up market. Restaurants that make over a

[02:49] certain amount of money. They're going to think about like a business, not just like their

[02:51] passion project. Passion project, business owners are kind of tough to deal with when you come

[02:55] from a business perspective. They're not willing to make like sometimes really obvious, clear,

[02:58] good business decisions for whatever limiting belief they have. Okay. So let's say help them. How

[03:03] do you make money? Great. Our core offer, which is what most people buy from us, is better

[03:07] cocktail consulting. We charge 30,000 for that. Again, that's just the development and implementation.

[03:12] And what we love to do is upsell everybody or at least have them initially by the better beverage

[03:17] program, which is what we call better cocktail consulting plus multiple program performance retainers.

[03:24] Okay. What percentage of people go from the core offer the episode? Less than less than 20%.

[03:28] Ding ding ding ding. So my little alarm went off when I hear barely 20%. That's an indication

[03:33] for me that there's probably an offer issue on the back end. Maybe even the front end or a

[03:37] combination of the both of how they work together. So what's the main problem? Let's hold

[03:40] it back. We need more better based on that. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, tell me. Yeah. Higher quality,

[03:47] higher quantity, more more consistency because it's like two-month, two-month,

[03:50] two-month variability, lower cost. So the lack of consistency really feels awful. I don't know

[03:57] what next month is going to be. Is it going to be a good month or a bad month? The good months are

[04:01] pretty good, but I can't really fully enjoy them because the bad months are so awful. Because

[04:06] the way that we're doing sales now is we will go for days, sometimes weeks without any leads at all.

[04:13] And finally, when we do get a lead, we'll get them on the phone, we'll have the calls, we'll pitch them,

[04:18] they'll get excited, we'll get excited and we get to the end, we present the price and

[04:24] deal with debt. So if you could imagine that massive drought followed by a huge disappointment,

[04:28] I'm really looking forward to getting rid of that. $12,000 a pack is crazy for a special

[04:35] ding ding ding number two, we have a super expensive cost-to-car customer and this is a customer that

[04:40] should probably be $1,500, $2,500, $2,500, $3,500 so it will be there's definitely an offer

[04:47] mismatched between what is being advertised and what they're selling if cack is so high or they just

[04:51] have a trotis sales process. So it's either an offer or sales process issue or both and we're going to

[04:57] figure it out. What we've noticed at that are our best clients are existing restaurants. Yeah.

[05:01] And so we're considering refining or targeting down just serving restaurants that are currently

[05:07] operational making $4 million a year or more in revenue. What could you sell for like 8 to 10,000?

[05:14] Something that we've tried in the past and could easily bring it back is essentially a

[05:18] DIY like we'll teach you how to do it. Mm-hmm. The uptake on that is what I would assume at

[05:24] lower people have a hard time like doing things if they're already not doing things. I would think

[05:28] is there a different thing that could be sold that was still in that price point that wasn't

[05:33] DIY. I mean basically I wouldn't position as DIY. I would just be like we're not going to fly out.

[05:37] The good news is I think this is super fixable. Let's do the quick recap of all the numbers you

[05:41] got so far. 2024 revenue $1.1 million profit $123,000 or cack $11,800 very high,

[05:50] LTV to cack of $1.71. I'm marketing spend without salaries is $10,000 a month close rate $66.

[05:58] So come here real quick, check this out. This is the $100 scaling roadmap. Ben is at stage 4 prioritized.

[06:04] Ed let me know if this sounds familiar. He's saying yes to anyone who would pay he's got all these

[06:08] different types of avatars. He's getting way too many unqualified leads but he's getting people

[06:12] or clicking he's getting people opting in but they're not the right types of people. Here's his next

[06:16] problem. The result of all this stuff is that he's got two specializes product. He's got to make

[06:21] better free stuff and have better creative to boost the volume and add qualifications and friction

[06:27] sounding familiar. And so the thing is is that as much as it always feels like this unknown journey

[06:31] when you're a business owner, business is behave in patterns. We broke out after studying

[06:36] our portfolio company seeing where they got stuck and how we broke through and put in a 10 stages.

[06:41] If you're curious about where you're at this is absolutely free just go to acquisition.com

[06:45] for slash roadmap plugging your business information in our automation thingy. We'll tell you what

[06:49] stage you're at and what you need to do to get to the next level. So it's absolutely free. Go

[06:53] check that out and if you want our team to double check the work and make sure that it's the right

[06:57] one and give you more tactics around it you can hop on a call on the next page and we love to help you out.

[07:01] The nice thing is that like I feel very confident that your business will we'll grow because

[07:06] there's some really obvious holes. I think I honestly have what I need. What do you come on this

[07:10] side and then we'll probably we'll power off through it together. Is that work? Yeah sounds great.

[07:14] All right but before we get started we're just going to find a major cocktail.

[07:18] All right I'll be saucy for our for our cocktail. Oh no no no no no no

[07:48] really going to help us stay like on task so we have grapefruit juice fresh grapefruit juice squeeze it myself this

[07:53] morning a ginger mint cordial to get a little spice and a little herb or bassiness and then we have our

[08:01] pineapple kombucha I have no way more people's drinks than their actual names

[08:10] Grandslam offer hi I'm Matt for breakover yeah moments thank you oh look at the

[08:16] Oh yeah full experience there we go all right thank you cheers cheers

[08:23] oh that's great awesome I could definitely have the kombucha would take off the edge of

[08:27] like it could hide a spirit really easily with that oh yeah okay so there's a lot of things so I think

[08:33] that we need to actually talk with the offer which is something that don't always get the opportunity to talk

[08:37] about but I think that you have a clear offer issue I think we need to talk about avatar that won't

[08:41] be as it relates to the offer number three and this is going to be a big one is going to be the funnel

[08:45] there's a lot of stuff that like a lot of missing things there that I think we can like really

[08:49] quickly fix and then sales and then finally maybe essentially and so that's kind of the big

[08:58] overarching theme so right off the bat I think that you have an offer issue so either that means

[09:04] that we're getting the wrong app charge on the phone we're getting the right app charge on the

[09:07] phone we're off the wrong thing okay so I would see 30 thousand dollars is super expensive for just

[09:12] a straight literally just a straight call funnel very tough so when I like said I had an offer problem

[09:17] I had a strong feeling he was right because four and a half years into the business if we're

[09:25] struggling the way we're struggling there's got to be something broken and if he likes as it's the

[09:29] offer to good chance it's the offer for what you're looking at cack for a small business or a

[09:34] restaurant I would imagine it should probably be in the April of the 1500 2500 dollars okay that's

[09:39] where that's like if you were up at three or three 500 be like okay fine but it's going to be in that

[09:43] kind of range and so I think there's you can probably cut it by at least two thirds compared to the

[09:49] you know 12 thousand or whatever that you're spending right now because I think there's there's a

[09:52] lot of opportunity from that perspective God this there's so much stuff like I'm just gonna think okay

[09:58] why don't we just start tip of the spear and let's open up the ads since that's the one that we

[10:03] can control the most so right off the bat we need to have clear call outs so we need to be talking

[10:08] about what avatar we really looking for so struggling to get the most out of cocktail program

[10:12] I don't know if that's necessarily even the language that would matter I also wouldn't restate my name

[10:16] one for infiltration hospitality because we already have it above there so it's like it's it's some of

[10:20] the most valuable advertising real estate yeah and so I would probably have something that you

[10:25] could really have like restaurant owners, astric, astric internet mean and then like second line

[10:30] like is you are like are you doing over you know X million dollars per year or it could just be

[10:35] formerly dollar plus per year uh restaurant owners is call out number one and then the question

[10:39] would be pain-based hook all right so check this out so I'm on page 136 of the leads book the first

[10:45] part of talking about here's the call out so we have to get the right people to notice the ad and it

[10:49] is by far the most important and so I'm trying to compress the things that he's looking for in his

[10:54] ideal avatar into just one line so they're like oh I'm a formerly dollar plus per year restaurant

[10:59] owner or bar owner just put it there and then like this is for me and once I do that 80% of the

[11:04] work of advertising is actually done as crazy as that sounds what I'm getting into further after that

[11:09] is okay let's see if we can ask a yes question or an if then statement or talk about some

[11:15] ridiculous assault all of these things are kind of the line after actually calling out the prospect

[11:20] right now once we get a little further into the copy I like using the what who went framework so

[11:24] this takes the value equation which I talk about in my first book this guy and tries to like

[11:29] explode this into many different copy variations and so what we want to talk about is both

[11:34] the dream stuff which is what's the good outcome how do we make it fast to make it likely how to

[11:38] make it easy and then on the flip side the pain which is what's your nightmare scenario and so this

[11:43] gives you a lot of different angles to approach the copy for a customer whether it's a B2C customer

[11:47] or B2B business owner and the reason I'm such a big proponent of pain in advertising is one

[11:53] is it's super compliant too I have the belief that the more precisely you can articulate the pain

[12:00] of a prospect to that prospect and even describe it more accurately to themselves than they can

[12:07] articulate it they will believe that you can help them almost better than any promise that you can make

[12:13] them so if you're like hey did Sally say this yesterday did you have this problem that showed up

[12:19] and are you consistently running out of your most expensive ingredients but then sometimes they go

[12:23] bad all of a sudden like god this kind of is exactly where I'm at and now I'm far more likely to take

[12:28] the next step has cockjails been less than 10% of your revenue your every year something like that

[12:33] right or because I know you said in the messaging they're not as receptive to like profit money

[12:38] related stuff there are there are avatars that like profit but a lot of them like recognition

[12:45] cool yeah and being right yeah they want to be cool and they want to be like popular like they

[12:48] want to be able to show up so people have different histories of reinforcement meaning they've had

[12:53] good things that happened to the past from different things that they've done and so if somebody

[12:57] did really well in school they like you know getting aes and maybe the the score matters more for them

[13:02] other people it's like they like the applause other people it's like they like showing up and having

[13:06] people flock to them like everyone has different drivers we wanted to describe what it's like the

[13:11] experience of success in as many varied ways as possible to attract the most varied avatars as long as

[13:19] they meet our requisites like is your cocktail program flasso it would probably do great yeah

[13:26] has no one ever posted anything good about your your cocktails in the last two years if you look at

[13:31] your reviews on yelp have do you just have long island ice teas and you know vodka sodas like you

[13:38] might need a insert you know a bar we haul instead of saying because what this is is super feature

[13:43] heavy data driven menus designed to get more orders team training the delivers just all that's

[13:47] like work yeah for me and so what I want is what occurs as a result right and so I'd be talking

[13:53] more at like classy typically 10 10 X their investment the first year 30 percent increase in many orders

[13:57] I'm not sure if it like bites at me you don't it mean and so it would be more like with the

[14:01] experience is like from people just ordering the things that they know off the top of their mind

[14:06] to getting excited when they open up your menu and then all of a sudden saying how many I want to

[14:10] try so many of these and then ordering two or three times more so it's like dial into the experience

[14:15] of what the avatars gonna go through right and then I would translate it okay what about the restaurant

[14:19] owner having you know your restaurant featured in some of these types of magazines which honestly

[14:23] doesn't take as long as you think as soon as you make these types of changes sure they know what a

[14:27] lot of restaurant owners don't know is that one of the largest profit drivers in the business is

[14:30] his alcohol and it's the one thing that they're the least focused on right if you want you can book

[14:34] all but even if you don't what I did was I took the you know the top 10 worst drinks to serve

[14:41] and I'll show you how to replace them with the top with 10 drinks that are better than that

[14:45] that work for just about any bar now on the thank you page so you can download that on the next page

[14:49] but on the thank you page if you want us to personalize it to your bar concept we'll show you

[14:53] how to organize the bar so you can get way more drinks served you can do it with higher margins

[14:56] and you don't have to train people for nearly as long because if you set it up the right way if that's

[15:00] interesting book called next page right and so that would be more or less my ad right at least my ad structure

[15:04] and so the the big thing number one is that a is that we need better ads yep so that's going to be

[15:11] both the copy so we want callouts to avatar we want to have paint based hooks we want to have

[15:16] be more benefit versus featured driven b we want to bang and lead magna what we want to do ideally with

[15:23] lead magna is demonstrate authority and expertise with something that they didn't know that they

[15:30] right because either you reveal a problem you give a sample of a solution or you give a one step of

[15:34] a multi-step process those are the three types of lead mags you can give so check this out real quick so

[15:39] this is a perfect example of an offer in lead magna mismatch so kind of what I was saying in the

[15:44] beginning like word-honing in here and I'm pretty sure this is the problem so what I explained here

[15:48] this is page 30 of the leads book he's trying to do this he's trying to go from low trust

[15:54] straight to a sale right and in that scenario he might sell a couple people which he is but instead what

[15:59] I'm trying to get him to do is put some sort of valuable lead magna at first which goes

[16:04] getting people from low trust to high trust and then that increases the number of people

[16:08] be more likely to buy from him after demonstrating value this is probably the like first big jump

[16:13] that we're going to do in the business that I think is going to have a huge impact on the growth

[16:17] and what I was referencing for him is under lead magnets there's always a continuous problem

[16:22] solution cycle into the three types of lead magnets are just like I need real problem have a free

[16:27] trial or one-step of a multi-step process it's almost like I wrote the book on this

[16:33] like I think that's the right direction because I think it being cocktail focused because right

[16:37] now we've been working on a lead magnet that's a profit focused okay and it's straightforward I mean

[16:42] essentially it's a tool that they abuse an excel and they pull up a p-mix they put in their top

[16:47] then sellers the quantities the price yeah they make a fifty cent dollar two dollar a just

[16:53] and fifty thousand dollars in profit yeah yeah you know that's great for the profit driven

[16:59] avatar yeah and so I don't know if there's a way to like kind of stack lead magnets so I wouldn't

[17:05] stack them I would just test one versus to done so if we were to just test ninety seven versus

[17:09] forty seven you might think okay well maybe you know just from the front end ninety seven dollars

[17:14] in the test that we've run actually it converted almost the exact same out but it was twice the

[17:17] money so that was a good idea but where the real money was was the fact that people who bought this

[17:21] were way more likely spend money now for me to answer why no idea just know that and so this is why

[17:26] we test all the way through LTV not just which one gets more opt-ins or which one gets more sales

[17:32] in terms of volume up front you might find though is that maybe the cost and this is why it's

[17:35] important to track all the way to the sale yeah is it you might find that the profit driven one get

[17:39] is cost three times as much to get the lead yeah but you close more sales sure and I'm going to

[17:44] show I'm going to break down some more fun stuff in a second because I'll I'll show you how we need

[17:47] to reorganize yours but I would just run that as an A.B. so we're going to run some ads we're like hey

[17:51] so you'll do the same exact intro yeah and then the transition will be like and if you want

[17:56] the top ten drinks that you shouldn't be serving that actually hurt bars and their profitability

[17:59] download my thing and I'll show you ten different ways of making them that are more profitable if

[18:03] asked or got it and then the other one is like and if you want to see how much revenue could potentially

[18:07] be missing out on sure I have a tool that we use internally that I'll just give you for free

[18:11] you can plug in your numbers and then it'll spend out exactly with the opportunities and if you're

[18:14] like you know what I don't I'm not really big excel guy that's fine on the sketch on the

[18:17] thing you pay schedule call we'll walk you through it specific to your ball right now right so I think

[18:23] both those work and I would I would just let's test that like I don't know the answer to that question

[18:26] they will but lead magnet for sure is one of the things that's missing from these ads and also

[18:30] probably why you're not getting the conversion you need to on the on the

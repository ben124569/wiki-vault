[00:00] Give me the next 30 minutes and I'll help you make the most of your 20s and your 30s.

[00:03] So I made my first million one out of 26.

[00:05] A decade later, my portfolio company has generated last year over $250 million an aggregate revenue.

[00:10] And I'm 36 now.

[00:11] And so in this video, I'm gonna give you the role of a lifestyle which someone had told me much earlier.

[00:15] So number one is you want to take asymmetric bets.

[00:19] If you're under 30, you have no reason not to go 100% all in under goals.

[00:24] The downside is nothing and the upside is everything.

[00:27] If you think about life as giving you kind of lottery tickets, right?

[00:31] You can scratch off a ticket and if you don't win, then what did you lose?

[00:36] The scratch off ticket.

[00:37] But the thing is is that when you have nothing to lose, you have nothing to lose and you only have things to gain.

[00:43] And so the objective when you have as little as you can is to take as many shots as possible.

[00:48] Because your downside is zero.

[00:50] Right? And so it's the only time in your career where you can take more shots than anyone else.

[00:55] And so the reason or the fact that people don't take shots and myself included when I was younger

[01:00] are so afraid to take a shot.

[01:01] But the only reason that was holding me back was the belief that other people who I don't even talk to anymore

[01:08] would somehow judge me as a quote failure.

[01:10] You never actually start from scratch ever again.

[01:13] Because every time after the first time you start from scratch, you start with an experience.

[01:18] So you still always net a positive.

[01:20] And so that's the beautiful thing about taking shots is that you either get the big win

[01:25] or more likely you learn something.

[01:27] And then that learning compounds.

[01:29] And so the thing is that I had a misunderstanding of how success worked,

[01:34] which is that it's far more stacking many things on top of each other than it is nothing,

[01:39] nothing, nothing and then something works.

[01:41] And so if you imagine success like a bridge.

[01:45] So you're over here and you've got this chasm that you have to get across.

[01:48] This is, let's say there's alligators here and lava and all sorts of stuff.

[01:52] And then there's you over here who's got your big smiley face and your happy and you're doing all the stuff you want.

[01:57] The thing is is that I thought that I just kept wanting to jump over this gap over and over again and think like if I just jumped hard enough

[02:04] or if I had the right opportunity that's what would do it.

[02:07] But more likely than not, it's really like you install these bricks on the path.

[02:12] And you keep walking and say okay, why fall here?

[02:15] Okay, we'll fix this one later.

[02:17] And then you start again and then you fall here and then you fix this.

[02:21] And you keep going and you fall here and then you fix this and then all of a sudden you make it all the way across.

[02:26] And that's what it looks like or what the experience of kind of becoming the overnight success is.

[02:32] And that's why so many people talk about it where it doesn't happen at all and then happens all at once.

[02:37] It's not that it happens all at once.

[02:38] The actual outcome of getting a system to work all the way through that is binary.

[02:43] But the process of building this system is actually very linear.

[02:46] I'm also not saying this from a position of like even though I saw some success early in my career,

[02:52] I also started pretty early.

[02:54] And so I had nine failed businesses.

[02:56] Nine before I had one that really worked.

[02:59] And so I bring this stuff to say that like I don't know what failure you're on right now.

[03:03] Maybe you're on zero failures, you're on one failure or two failures.

[03:06] But you have way more failures in you.

[03:08] At the end of the day like one of the big realizations I had is that since life is an infinite game.

[03:13] And what that means is that there are games where you have a defined time period and at the end you count the score.

[03:19] Right? And then there's infinite games where the only point of the game is to keep playing the game.

[03:24] And so like at the point of marriage is not to get married.

[03:28] It's to stay married. The point of health is not to get healthy.

[03:31] It's to stay healthy.

[03:32] And the point of business is not to get into business.

[03:35] But you stay in business.

[03:37] And so basically the only thing that you have to do to stay in business is to choose to continue to fight.

[03:43] And so once you realize that then you realize that you become a success the moment you decide you are.

[03:48] Because being successful is far more about being in the game, about being in the arena.

[03:52] And so when you're in your 20s, what you lack in experience you have to make up for in effort and hours.

[03:58] And believing otherwise leads to a life of honestly well deserved mediocrity.

[04:02] So if you're hearing this you're like, okay, I got it. I need to take more bets.

[04:05] And I need to say maybe risk your bets because my downside is nothing.

[04:08] All right, well which bets do I take?

[04:10] So number two, don't follow your passion.

[04:13] So passion is vague.

[04:15] And so it's very difficult to say I like this thing more than this thing.

[04:18] But what you can say is I'm better at this than that.

[04:21] And so passion usually then comes from confidence, not creates confidence.

[04:27] And so we usually like things that we good at rather than getting good at things that we like.

[04:31] Right? And so this is the thing like that I think confused a lot of people.

[04:34] And so the other flip side of this is that enjoying something doesn't even guarantee that you're good at it.

[04:37] Or that you're going to be able to make money from it.

[04:39] And I remember my dad just told me when I was much younger.

[04:41] He said, listen, if I were falling my passion, I'd be a bartender to ski slope.

[04:44] Right? He said, if you could just make money, he said the rest of your life, you can do whatever you want.

[04:47] And I actually think it was very practical advice for me.

[04:49] And a very grateful that I got that.

[04:51] But the thing is that getting good at anything, you have to slog through this period where you're

[04:55] probably not going to be passionate about it because it's very boring.

[04:57] It's very monotonous, it's very repetitive.

[04:58] Right? It's one thing he said, oh, I like ping pong.

[05:00] It's another thing to say, I like I hit 500, 400, 500 backhands every morning and every night.

[05:04] Right? It's a different level of dedication that you have to have to admit that.

[05:07] Isn't going to be something you're passionate about.

[05:08] You might like playing the game, but getting good at the game are two very different things.

[05:11] Right? And so it sets this false expectation that I think ultimately harms more people.

[05:16] And I think one of the biggest reasons of not falling your passion is that

[05:20] your passions will change as you age.

[05:22] I promise you the things that I was passionate about in the 20 is not things I'm passionate about now.

[05:25] And I'm sure that things I've passionate about in my mind and late 40s are

[05:28] be different than things I'm now. Same as 50s and 60s.

[05:31] And so this idea that I have to find this one thing, it puts a ton of pressure on that thing

[05:35] that it has to be perfect forever. And if it's not going to be perfect forever,

[05:38] then why don't we be practical now so that we can give ourselves options later?

[05:42] So fundamentally, all we're going to look for are things that you're good at

[05:45] that people already spend money on. Because that creates a very high likelihood

[05:49] outcome of you creating something that you can exchange in the marketplace.

[05:53] Once you've decided on something that you want to get better at, you're already good at it.

[05:55] You want to get better at it, which is hopefully, you know, maybe it is your passion, which

[05:58] be amazing, but a lot of times it's not. The next thing is you have to get good at one thing.

[06:02] Think about the equal opposite of this. How would I get someone to be poor?

[06:07] I would get them to keep starting new things rather than getting good at one thing.

[06:12] And so do you remember that guy who got rich, drop shipping, day trading,

[06:16] buy crypto and wholesaling all at the same time? Yeah, me neither. You have to focus.

[06:21] And it's arrogant to think that you can do multiple things at once and beat someone who's

[06:25] does one thing with all their effort. You have to pick one thing and go all in and then you

[06:29] become the one who's hard to beat. So I told you earlier that I had nine-file businesses.

[06:34] Now, here's the part that a lot of people will do. No. Six of those I had the same time.

[06:37] And so I like to tell people, oh yeah, I'm a CEO. I've got multiple companies,

[06:42] right, like, kind of the way I do now, but it's very different now because the thing is,

[06:45] is that I actually have CEOs who run those businesses, right? Not me. Because you can only be

[06:50] CEO of one thing, you're only drive one thing. Now, I drive acquisition.com, right? But CEO is

[06:56] of each of the divisions of each of the portfolio companies. Like, those are people who run their

[06:59] own profitable statements. And I didn't understand that. And so I had a car practical agency,

[07:04] a dental agency, a gym lunch business, where we did turn around. And then I also had five gyms in my

[07:09] own at the time. All right? It's depending on how you want to drive it. I had five locations plus the

[07:14] three, so I ate. It's a lot. All right. It's too much. And because of that, I was stressed out of my mind.

[07:19] I was so spread then. And basically, I had lots of things that generated revenue and I didn't make

[07:23] any money. The only thing that it fed was my ego, not my bank account. When did this big

[07:28] turnaround happen for me? Laila came into my life and she was like, hey, you're clearly really

[07:32] good at this one thing. Why don't we just cut everything else? And that's exactly what I did. It was

[07:36] the hardest period of my life. I had to shut down all the other businesses but one, which

[07:40] awesome at that. And partnerships with all these different other people that were relying on me.

[07:44] And that was hard. I'm not a lot like it was not fun. Like, these are people that I liked.

[07:48] But I had to make this decision. I had to cut off the life that I didn't want to have the life

[07:53] if you want to impress people who are poor. Talk about how many things you do. If you want to impress

[07:59] people who are rich, talk about how good you are with them. Like at the end of the day,

[08:03] your ability to demonstrate excellence is going to be the only thing that someone who is ahead of you will

[08:09] look at. And so you only fool the people who have no idea. And I'll be real. There's a lot of people

[08:14] have no idea. So the thing is is that this is where the whole imposter syndrome will start creeping

[08:20] up on you because you're like, man, I kind of feel like a little bit of imposter because you are

[08:23] you're misrepresenting yourself. You know you're not as successful as you pretend to be. And so if you

[08:28] want to eliminate imposter syndrome, just stop lying. When I say lie, I don't lie. If you present

[08:33] something in a way that you know is going to be perceived differently than what reality is,

[08:37] posturing, in my opinion, lying. You're misrepresenting. What you want to be able to do is state the

[08:41] facts until the truth. Period. And then if those facts and truth are not compelling and do not get you

[08:46] status, then change the facts and change the truth. Meaning, not that you lie about them, but you

[08:52] work so hard that the truth is compelling. And sometimes that takes time. But I promise you the people

[08:56] who are all that only apostles up, the guys that I knew that are that were, you know, when I was

[09:00] in my 20s who were kind of like hustle pros, whatever, a lot of those guys faded. You know,

[09:04] and the or there's still like jumping from thing to thing to think kind of like pretending to be

[09:08] successful. Like I know that they're barely able to afford their house. At the end of the day,

[09:12] it's a choice that you have to make. Do I want to pretend to be rich? Do I want to pretend to be

[09:16] successful? Do I want to look like I'm successful? Or do I want to be successful? Which more likely

[09:21] is do the things that success requires, which today do not look like success? It looks like a very

[09:26] long string of failures. Because you will be rewarded far more in life for your determination than

[09:31] your intelligence. But the problem with determination is that in the short term, it looks like a long

[09:37] string of failures until it works. Okay. So you're like, God, I'm going to focus. Now, let me give you

[09:41] something that's going to help you stay focused. Number four, stop networking. All right. Now, this is a

[09:46] really, really important point. Now, it's not that I even have some big problem with networking overall.

[09:51] That's actually not my point. It's more that there are there are seasons of life. Right? In the

[09:56] beginning, you're an exploration. I grabbed this from the wall and I really love it. Later on,

[10:01] you get into exploitation, which is where you go all in. Right? And so the thing is, is that in the

[10:05] beginning, you're tasting lots of stuff. You try to figure out what you are good at or have some

[10:11] proclivity towards. When you have that proclivity, then it becomes very clear. Now is the time to

[10:16] cut everything else so that we can focus and go deep. Right? So you go broaden the beginning, so that

[10:22] you can figure out what you do go deep on it. The broad period that you're in is never the period where

[10:26] you're going to make money. Like, this is the part you have to get and I'd say from the beginning of

[10:30] when I started until I really graduated from it was about five years. It's less of a binary more of

[10:35] a continuum in the beginning. You taste lots of stuff and then you just have to, because in the

[10:38] beginning you have to say yes to things. You have to say yes because you're so bad. You're so scared.

[10:42] You never want to say yes. But you learn to say yes a little bit and then you say yes more and then

[10:47] very quickly you learn to say yes and get overwhelmed. And so the only way out of this yes trap

[10:52] is you have to start practicing to say no. And if you're like wait a second, that means that I have

[10:56] to change what I do. Welcome to entrepreneurship. Like you have to learn. You have to evolve. You have to

[11:00] grow. So let me give you a very tactical example. So if you're debating between going to a networking event

[11:05] or like a lunch with some dude who's like hey we should collaborate. We should synergize. We should

[11:09] maybe trade ideas. Let me pick your brain. Whatever. And if you're picking between any of those things

[11:14] and working, choose the work because when the work works out, the people will still be there to

[11:20] take your call. But if you never do the work, no amount of networking will get the work done for you.

[11:25] And the bonus or negative bonus here is that if you don't get the work done, they're not going to

[11:29] take your call in the future. And so they're willing to take the calls day with whatever small amount

[11:33] of success that you have. But if you lose that success because you get distracted, they're not going

[11:37] to take the call in the future. That door will be open. I promise and not only will that door

[11:41] be open, a hundred other doors will open for you. If you win during the season, losers congregate,

[11:47] winners isolate. If everyone was supposed to win, they would have made podiums bigger. The top of

[11:52] the mountain isn't supposed to fit a lot of people. It's normal. The air is hard and breathe.

[11:56] And the thing is, if all of this seems antithetical or different than what you've heard or what

[12:01] other people around your experiencing ask yourself is that, do those people have the lives you want?

[12:05] A great way to make a mistake is to ask someone else's idea about your idea,

[12:12] who has no idea. When you make this transition from going from the exploration period to the

[12:17] exploitation phase, you go from many lose your connections to a very few tight ones. I tend to be

[12:24] very transactional as a person, but I think we all are and some people are just open about it.

[12:28] Everybody on some level does some sort of math in their head of like, the person, this person

[12:31] my life I get more benefits than I have costs. But the thing is, is that if you want to raise the

[12:35] standard of your life, you have to raise the standard of the people who you surround yourself with.

[12:38] Because the fastest way to change your life is to change who you're friends with. Because

[12:43] that reference group is ultimately going to be what you compare yourself to. And so if you change

[12:47] you compare yourself to all of a sudden, you will create deprivation around the difference between

[12:51] where they're at and where you're at. The only way that people let you into circles that you don't

[12:55] deserve to be in is work ethic. There is no other way. It is the universal currency of respect

[13:00] across cultures, across time periods, across cohorts, across generations. An old man or a

[13:05] respect a young man who hustles. And then will always be willing to give time to somebody who they

[13:09] think will execute. Like this is that was my secret. And it still is my secret. Like I now

[13:15] rip people who are above hope, you know, I punch above my weight class in terms of the people

[13:18] that I'm connected with because they know that I'll do the work. And so they don't feel like they're

[13:21] wasting their time by helping because the thing is a lot of people are actually very happy to help you.

[13:25] What they aren't happy to do is waste their time helping you when you actually don't help yourself.

[13:30] And so I've shed friends at every season of my life. And my close circle has always been very

[13:35] small, like very small. The thing is that I think of my life in kind of seasons. And so you're

[13:41] going to have friends for this season. And maybe you keep them for life. But maybe you don't. And I think

[13:45] giving yourself permission to say like that was that season. And they were amazing friends for the

[13:49] objectives that I had then. And then my objective change. It's not really fair to them to say,

[13:53] hey, I'm completely changing all the things that I'm doing. You have to still be friends with me.

[13:56] It might not make sense for them. And so not keeping this expectation over them has helped me kind of like

[14:01] free myself of that so that I can reinvest the time that I have. And friends that I think will help

[14:06] me get to where I'm trying to go next. Okay. So if we're taking these big bets and we're following

[14:10] something that we're good at rather than that we're passionate about. And we're not going to get

[14:14] distraction. We're doubling down on one thing. And we're turning off these other things that in the

[14:18] beginning we're exploring the little lunch is the little networking it because we know that if we just

[14:22] succeeded this one thing all of those doors will be open. What do we do to make money? So let me give you a

[14:26] money roll. Money loves speed. And this will relate back to the asymmetric bets. By the time you have

[14:33] all the information the opportunity is gone. Sometimes you just have to make your bet. And it's almost

[14:39] always faster to make a decision than make a mistake and then correct that mistake than it is to

[14:45] painstakingly deliberate on the decision. If you know how long it would take you to fix something

[14:49] if you're wrong then just make your best bet because you can always fix it later. And so said differently

[14:55] if it takes you five minutes to decide and then ten minutes to fix something don't take two hours to

[15:00] decide because you could just do it and if you're right you immediately are moving forward five minutes

[15:04] later. And if you're wrong you're moving forward 15 minutes later. But either way it's going to

[15:08] take you less time than trying to assume that you're going to know everything because you're just

[15:11] not. You have to get a grip with uncertainty. Like uncertainty is the job. Like if you want certainty

[15:18] don't try and go after your dreams because the thing is is that the only way to go after certain

[15:21] dreams do after an old dream. And if you go after an old dream that's already happened you're trying

[15:25] to fulfill something that will not happen again. And so you're either going to do the work or you're

[15:29] going to sit around wishing you'd done the work. And one of the things that took me very long time

[15:33] to to understand was that the things that dragged me down were not the things that I thought they

[15:38] were. Because the heaviest things in life aren't iron or gold but they're unmade decisions.

[15:42] They're the things that weigh us down. They take up all of our attention, all of our brain power.

[15:47] And so right now there's probably a handful of decisions that you know you need to make that you're just

[15:52] not. If you want to feel yourself go so much faster than you ever have, just decide. So few decisions

[15:58] life actually are irreversible. Even the ones that people pretend are irreversible. What if I

[16:04] should I buy this car? Should I buy this car? You can buy it and then flip it. It's not like you can't sell it again.

[16:08] Right? And so the real cost of the decision is the delts between what I can buy for what I can sell for.

[16:12] Okay. Well, how much does it cost me waiting six months to do this? Probably a lot.

[16:17] And if I need that card to you know, or trucks to that can like just go to job sites or pick up clients or whatever it is

[16:23] then like I am losing all of the time that I'm waiting to decide. And I'm telling you where people slow down

[16:30] is that the decision process more than at the doing process. Doing usually takes very little time.

[16:35] It's the deciding that people that box people down and quagmire, right? They just get stuck. They

[16:39] feel like they're trudging through mud because they just hit these walls and all of a sudden there's no

[16:43] action because they're just thinking they're planning. And I think I had to get comfortable with the idea

[16:48] that there are so many variables that I do not know that I had to have to get comfortable with the idea

[16:53] that I just should test and learn and I'll learn way faster than if I try and deliberate. And that

[16:58] has happened more times in my life than not and I'll say that approach has served me with bigger and

[17:03] bigger decisions in life. Like I have I've made monstromistics but the bigger mistake that I would have made

[17:08] is just not being able to make decisions to begin with. And so you can move through life at seven times

[17:13] the rate of other people by simply changing when you say you're going to make a decision from the

[17:18] end of the week to the end of the day. And if you want to move you even faster than that you can

[17:22] decide to think of the hour. And if you don't move it and it's faster than that guess we could do decide

[17:26] and so sometimes like my team has seen me do this well we're like okay so we've got to make this decision

[17:32] and people are always like yeah let's kick that to next you know meeting or let's circle battle

[17:36] let's let's go offline for that it's like no let's confront let's just choose let's pick which

[17:40] vendor are you going with which website does that and we like what headline are we going to use what's

[17:44] the ad look that we're going to go with just pick that's why all of this stuff comes down to bets

[17:50] if you want to have a future that you want you have to get comfortable with risk so if money

[17:54] loves speed where are some of the money pot holes so number six pay off your debt.

[18:00] Now I'm gonna hit you with something you probably have thought of before which is there are many kinds

[18:03] of debt there's obviously financial debt but the biggest and most expensive debt is ignorance debt

[18:08] it's the cost of what you do not know but should it to be clear I still pay off ignorance debt

[18:14] every debt if the debt in skills and knowledge that I should know to get faster and further to where I'm

[18:21] don't and so I have to just fail until I get this knowledge but the thing is is that if I don't

[18:27] fail I will never get it I am willing to pay in looking bad in money lost in time lost and people

[18:34] judging me to make bets and so I like this perspective on experts which is that an expert is just

[18:40] somebody who's made all the mistakes you can make in a very nearer field you have to learn how to

[18:44] lose before you can learn how to win and the first or losing is that you didn't lose you just learned

[18:50] you paid down the most expensive debt so then the question is if you know that you have to pay the

[18:54] stead off why aren't you and I think it's because you don't realize how expensive not paying it off

[19:00] really is and so no the price of inaction do you think that the reason that you're in the situation

[19:07] here and right now is because you struggle to decide in the past they've got an all the way of the

[19:11] edge you've got all the way up the precipice all the way to the front of the line and then you choose

[19:14] not to and so the question is how many times have you run that cycle how many times have you

[19:18] you thought through this decision and then not done something about it and is the life you have you

[19:22] want as a result of those actions because maybe the best thing you can possibly do is maybe see this

[19:28] and then just choose to make that call because not making that call is God Newarker. If you genuinely

[19:32] believe that you're going to do this sooner or later right make this bet make this call whatever sooner

[19:38] then he might as well do it sooner so you can start enjoying the benefits now because you're going to

[19:42] enjoy the benefits of the way but why would you want to delay the benefits of taking action the real

[19:46] real is because you want to delay the costs of potential failure. Let's say you have a reason why you

[19:51] haven't taken action whatever that is right just imagine in your mind like it's the visual thing

[19:56] realistically it's probably one or two voices in your head and it you can probably think about who's

[20:02] voice that is and it might not be yours and so who is the person that you're choosing to not live

[20:08] your entire life for who is judgment you cared that much about and so I will tell you the story I

[20:13] almost didn't sell Jim launch because I thought that $46 million was not enough to impress a specific

[20:20] colleague of mine real talk I was very very hesitant to sell the company and the main reasons

[20:25] because I thought that they would think that that wasn't that that impressive and when I thought about that I was like

[20:30] wow I was like and this is there's no family this wasn't friends this was just kind of a colleague

[20:36] that I respected when I was able to really listen to the voice whose voice is this belong to and what

[20:42] are they saying and most importantly is that the person who I want to give control over my entire life

[20:48] and once I saw that I was like well that's ridiculous I don't care about this they're usually

[20:52] subconscious like you don't notice them unless you listen for the voice unless you name the voice

[20:56] am I really gonna let John be the reason that I don't get married to this girl is Joe really

[21:01] gonna be the reason that I don't raise my prices is Sarah really the reason why I'm not going to sell this

[21:05] thing ridiculous but people do it myself included every day it look this isn't going to be easy

[21:12] right building these skills losing friends taking bets taking losses you might find yourself stuck

[21:17] and then blaming your previous experiences which is why number eight get over yourself

[21:24] everyone's childhood was difficult get over it and if you want to win the award for hardest childhood

[21:29] congratulations I'll give it to you you have the hardest childhood you win feel better right

[21:33] no one cares about what happened to you then only what you can make happen now and so the only

[21:38] person that satisfied with whatever that reason is is you and the everyone else calls that reason

[21:43] an excuse and at the end of the day you want to get to your life and have everyone be like you know what

[21:47] he wasn't successful but he had a lot of really good reasons wouldn't it be so much more powerful

[21:51] to say he had all these reasons he shouldn't have been successful but was anyways like those reasons

[21:56] actually give you even more fuel because you become a stronger story to everyone else like no one

[22:02] cares when the silver spoon kids exceeds really and so all of the reasons that you can normally tell

[22:07] yourself why you shouldn't do it or sometimes the best reasons of why you should if you had this

[22:11] advantage is I agree with you like you're right it's hard to be successful if this thing happened to you

[22:16] or if you're born with x or you're in this gender or this race or you have this birth deformity

[22:22] or you speak a different language or you're born in a different country or you had abuse whatever

[22:26] so the main point is despite the disadvantage you only have one choice what are you going to do

[22:31] you can take action anyway and become proved to other people like you your people who are also born

[22:36] into your situation whether it was abused whether it was your gender whether it was your race whether

[22:41] your country and you can prove to them or prove to yourself that you can overcome it and then

[22:45] they can overcome it too or you can do what the vast majority people do is that they protect

[22:49] their ego and blame and complain and to be clear this is not a pulpit you can do it everyone

[22:54] I support your choice go you but only one of those decisions is going to make you better

[22:58] and likely only one of those decisions is going to get you closer to where you want to go

[23:01] because at the end of the day here's the TLDR losers to find themselves by what has happened to them

[23:06] winners to find themselves by what they can make happen despite what's happened to them and so

[23:10] we're some person sees and excuse another person sees an origin story like you look at every

[23:15] champion every hero every comic book they all have hard paths and so you having a hard

[23:21] past whatever that is for you or some disadvantage just makes you like every other superhero who

[23:27] ends up you know changing their lives and I actually love this I heard this from Joe Rogan so this is

[23:31] not mine every single one of us can today wake up like it's the first day of a video game

[23:36] like you just like got transported into this body and you're like okay look around

[23:40] I have a wife I have some kids I have a job I hate or I have a business that I don't like

[23:44] or I have some bet that I have this thing inside of me that I know I can do more but I'm not

[23:49] you have all the stuff that's around you and now you can choose like everything else behind you

[23:54] you can just have to debut your spawn point and so when you're in a video game it's easy to just

[23:57] force take all that stuff because you don't have this emotional connection to it but the thing is

[24:01] is that like the action needs to be taken either way so whatever frame of mind you need to be

[24:04] in order to do it then do that all right so once we have this head trash out of the way

[24:08] then we have to get back to back to business if you will so what's the next thing that we have to

[24:12] do we have to solve bigger problems if you want to make more money in your 20s and 30s solve

[24:19] bigger problems right if you want to make a million dollars you have to be willing to endure a million

[24:23] dollars with a pain if you want to make ten million dollars you have to endure ten million

[24:27] dollars for the pain and here's the thing is that most people have never endured that and so when

[24:30] they start getting into it the thing is is the nature of the pain changes and so in the beginning

[24:35] the pain is I don't know what I'm doing later the pain is people judging me and later the pain is

[24:41] lawsuits and a lot of the pain is just not knowing what the hell you're doing at whatever stage

[24:45] of business you're at because that never goes away and so not knowing is a constant so trying to

[24:51] solve for not knowing is silly because it's never going to happen and so this is why you have to

[24:56] get comfortable with uncertainty if to make uncertain to your friend if we're going to solve

[24:59] problems right we might as well pick big ones and I'll give you a great a great analogy that I

[25:04] got from Stephen Torchman is the founder of Black Stone you said big goals and small goals are usually

[25:09] just about as hard a common VC saying is that having a really successful restaurant you might have to

[25:14] work 80 hours a week and manage all these different people to have a really successful local restaurant

[25:18] and you might also have to manage all these people and do all this other stuff if you want to

[25:24] build a billion dollar unicorn both of those things are hard and so if it's going to be hard regardless

[25:29] you might as well go big and actually it's been a very like that is a very helpful friend for me because

[25:33] one of the beliefs that I have about business and life is that suffering is a constant like I

[25:38] have to remind myself of this on a regular basis which is that if we're growing I am in pain if we're

[25:43] plateaued I am in pain and if we're declining I am in pain which means that I am pretty much always

[25:48] in pain and so to think that there's something wrong with pain misses the point of how this works

[25:54] it is a constant and if it's a constant leave it is think about it it shouldn't be a reason to do

[25:58] something or not do something because it's just always there competition for big goals believe

[26:02] it or not is actually much rarer it's thinner air people believe that it's so unrealistic that

[26:07] they don't shoot for it would actually make fewer people there to compete against and so it is

[26:11] probably harder in some ways to have a local restaurant that is really successful then it is to have a

[26:18] big business and what I found is that most problems are solvable which means that most things are

[26:23] noble and the reason that you probably haven't gotten tour you want to go is because you haven't

[26:29] actually started trying it and so you're going to have to be obsessive about it and I think one of the

[26:34] big things that I didn't understand was just how obsessive I was going to have to be is normal to not

[26:39] be like your other normal friends if you want to have extraordinary outcomes if you think about

[26:44] the reverse it wouldn't make sense if we do the same things as our normal friends and somehow get

[26:48] something different it's a positive indicator it's a green flag that you're living a different life

[26:53] than everyone around you like I had a conversation with my aces morning they're like man I feel like

[26:57] if you were a normal person that's what they said to me they're like I feel like if you were normal

[27:00] person you would drive this kind of car I like looked at them and I was like so basically if I were not

[27:05] me I would do things that not me would do right now it would make sense that you're going to do

[27:11] things that normal people won't do because you're trying to not have the same outcome as them 10

[27:16] obsession is the ticket of entry the price of entry and the thing is that obsession isn't really

[27:23] obsession it's actually just trying and no one else tries like that's the real real is that

[27:28] normal people call what I consider saying people to be obsessed but saying people which is what I

[27:35] consider myself consider everyone else insane because they do nothing and waste their lives

[27:40] and so we have to be comfortable with reasoning from first principles of like I'm only going to

[27:46] live here for not that long and I'm only going to have a certain amount of hours to do the stuff

[27:50] that I want to do why on earth would I not do it because of some face noise that's some person

[27:56] some other you know advanced ape is going to say to me about them having a preference about how I'm

[28:03] living my life and so you can boil almost all insults or judgments down to this statement and I think

[28:10] like I hear this I translate it when I hear hate you do not live your life in a way that I prefer so

[28:14] like you know you should it I do not live my life in a way that you prefer and that's okay because

[28:18] that's why you live a life that you prefer and not a life that I would prefer and that's why you

[28:22] live your life and I live my life and so people just get so triggered by this so when people hate on you

[28:27] it usually means that they're jealous and believe that you are undeserving of some part of your life

[28:33] and so it's be clear it's not that the jealous of your whole life they might be jealous of the

[28:36] attention you get they might be jealous of maybe just the money you make but not the way you look or they

[28:41] might be jealous of the the body you have right and they're going to be like oh here two into that

[28:45] food right or you know you work too much or whatever the whatever the little snide remark is right

[28:50] but what they basically think is that life has unjustly given you the benefit that they believe they

[28:56] rightfully deserve and they might be right but life isn't fair here's the thing people who

[29:00] obsess about work life balance are typically mediocre at both and so obsess people apply their obsession

[29:07] to everything and just call it life and they also don't consider themselves obsessed they just consider

[29:12] everyone else unobsessed and just plain and bane all and so I get criticized all the time for

[29:17] work life balance people say like Alex you don't have any hobbies right I don't want any I don't

[29:21] want any they're basically saying get again you live your life in a way that I would not prefer

[29:25] if I were in your position I would live life differently right and that's why you're not in my position

[29:28] so why should I sacrifice the things that I prefer to do in order to do things that I don't want to do

[29:32] right just to make your definition of work like balance happy which I don't accept so like work

[29:36] life balance is a wonderful goal I've no hate for it it's not going to happen if you want to be

[29:41] the best like you probably heard the you know worksmart not hard right that only works when

[29:47] your competing against people who are not smart if you compete against other smart people the only thing

[29:51] you'll have left is to work hard if you work smart not hard you will get beaten by someone who works

[29:56] smart and not and if I don't about you I would rather be that person because at the end of the

[30:00] day I would like to just win and that is put 11 which is work hard and smart a few extrapolate

[30:07] out with a normal life is like right maybe someone makes you know a million dollars or two million

[30:12] dollars or over the span of their entire career right 40 years plus I think there's just a certain

[30:16] amount of work that must be done to generate income and so what I would rather do is just take that

[30:19] 40 years and just cram it into four and then have the other 36 years in my life to do whatever I want

[30:26] with resources far beyond what I would be able to do there and so I remember Layla had this very

[30:32] early conversation exact I think is our first date she said she's like I just want to help people

[30:36] right there's like that's the whole thing and I was like do you think it be possible for you to

[30:40] help people and to make money and she was like well yeah and I was like okay do you think you could

[30:44] help more people if you made more money and she was like yeah and in that conversation she shifted

[30:50] from being what I would consider a bleeding heart of just like doing everything like just trying to

[30:55] just just help every single person but things is you're limit your resources are so limited you can't

[30:59] do much and so if you want to help a lot of people it's like you got to learn the game and the thing is

[31:04] to win that game it's like you probably have to outwork people a lot of people and you have to be called

[31:08] names by people who live lives that you don't like I want to be very clear about this when I say

[31:12] work hard and smart it doesn't mean it's going to be exciting so 12 here is except boredom

[31:20] like if you want to be creative you must first learn to be bored if you want to achieve a

[31:25] goal you'll either have to accept boredom or pain and the bigger the goal the more of both

[31:29] you want to get I have this great visual on my head about how winning works right so you imagine

[31:34] you have this this marathon right that you're running so you've got this starting line here right

[31:39] start and then you've got this big race right and then you've got to finish line over here

[31:43] today finish now when you've seen a race where do people gather they gather here and they gather here

[31:50] so here's the question where does the winning happen on your own because no one cheers for you

[31:55] not drinking for a day or not smoking on a lawn drive if you're trying to quit or not over eating

[32:00] for one night or skipping out on going to the club with the boys no one cheers for that no workout

[32:06] or meal is ever impressive on its own it's so the reason so few people understand success or at

[32:11] least achieve it in my opinion is that consistency never looks impressive in the moment only at the end

[32:16] because if you think about how consistent like it's very difficult to visualize consistency

[32:20] because you could only see someone do something once right you see a snapshot of someone

[32:25] take a shot or pit a back end the only way that you can actually witness consistency is working

[32:31] with people who are consistent because the thing that you have to see is that person show up

[32:36] every single day like someone could show a workout of me working out and someone else might be like

[32:40] okay well i mean that's a workout maybe i should kind of work out like that and sure there's

[32:44] a level of intensity that might be there or form and things like that whatever but the thing that

[32:48] people won't see is it's very hard to witness 20 years because you have to be there for 20 years

[32:52] and this is why i think so few people are able to internalize consistency which is the most

[32:57] important success trait because it's very hard to lose if you shop every day it's very hard

[33:01] and showing up every day is boring and so if we're willing to accept boredom the next thing

[33:06] that we're going to have to be willing to accept is sacrifice we have to give up some things to get

[33:11] others and so like at the end of the day like all we have our trade-offs we have what we have and what we

[33:16] want and the question is what are the things you currently have or you're willing to trade for the things you

[33:20] want and i think it's such a perfect way of thinking about it like you have everything in your life

[33:25] right now that you're going to have to trade like everyone trades everyone starts even when you

[33:29] that's your own you have things in your life and you have to trade those things for things that you

[33:34] currently want but don't have there's no perfect way to live your 20s or your 30s right you

[33:38] either live them up and become an underscored 30 or 40 year old or you work them up and become an

[33:42] under lived 30 or 40 year old you just have to figure out which you'd rather be and accept the

[33:47] trade-offs and know that there are no due-overs and that's okay and when we're really thinking about

[33:51] sacrifice right now no human will ever get more than 24 hours per day we all have that right and so

[33:59] fundamentally everything that you spend your time on that is not you pursuing your goal you are determining

[34:05] is more important than your goal and so if you look at what you did every single one of these hours

[34:10] and then you actually surfaced it say you know what watching Netflix you know doom scrolling

[34:15] TikTok and Instagram hanging around do nothing surfing the web or whatever it is that people do these days

[34:20] that is what's actually more important to you based on your behavior and so is it really a sacrifice

[34:26] to give that up for what you want because the thing is that a year from now you're not going to look

[34:30] back on today and be like man I'm so glad like those clips that I watched really change things for me

[34:36] they you probably won't even remember any of the clips that you saw they did a great research

[34:40] study on this where they did short-form versus long-form even and people remember like 11% like

[34:46] 24 hours later it was a tiny percentage and so we have to accept that the things that we spending

[34:52] our time on most of the time it's just wasting our time on and so I think Senika said this it's not that

[34:57] we don't have enough time it's that the we waste the time we have I come back to this which is like

[35:02] is it really a sacrifice or you finally just saying I believe this is my priority and therefore

[35:08] all of these things that are not helping me pursue that I'm not going to trade up for things that

[35:13] will help me get this priority that's it and to me if you like what you're going to get how genomic

[35:18] the train and so I just clip that went super viral from a podcast that I did yesterday and the

[35:22] host asked me if all my books and all my tweets and all my emails and all my YouTube videos were

[35:27] all deleted and I had to compress all of my stuff into into 60 seconds what would I say for somebody

[35:33] who's in their 20s and 30s this is what I said figure out what you want ignore the opinions of others

[35:38] and do so much volume that it would be unreasonable to not be successful

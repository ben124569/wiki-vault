[00:00] Big shit takes time and I had to learn that.

[00:02] Like, I want you to feel that because it took me a long time to learn.

[00:05] What I see happen all the time with entrepreneurs, especially when they apply to acquisition.com,

[00:09] you know, they've got a million dollars in profit maybe it's the bare minimum for us to consider for investment.

[00:13] And they're like, here's my idea for how I wouldn't expand and how I won't your help.

[00:16] I want to start all these new product lines because I've already saturated my market.

[00:20] Because I'm spending $50,000 in Facebook ad and I can't spend anymore than I currently am.

[00:24] Otherwise I lose the profit a little of the ads.

[00:25] So I'm going to start selling more and different offers and add massive complexity to my business that only makes $3 million

[00:31] top line per year.

[00:32] That is a mistake and in this video I'm going to walk through why.

[00:34] And the reason this is so important is because many people hit this first plateau and then

[00:38] think, oh, I should start a new business.

[00:40] Oh, I should start a new product line.

[00:42] When really they need to confront the problem ahead, which is they don't know how to get more

[00:46] customers within their current niche or space.

[00:49] Your market isn't capped, your mindset is capped.

[00:53] What I'm going to do is break down the three different frameworks I used to think through this

[00:56] so that you are never capped in whatever market you go after.

[00:59] Number one, from the marketing perspective, you have your method, which is the biggest thing

[01:03] you do.

[01:04] It's running paid ads, it's making content, it's doing outreach, it's getting referrals,

[01:08] it's getting affiliates, those are the methods that you do to get customers.

[01:11] Underneath of that, you've got the platforms that you do that method on.

[01:15] Do you've got Facebook, you've got phones, email, who blew YouTube?

[01:18] You've got Google app underneath the vet.

[01:20] You've got the media on the platform.

[01:22] So if I'm on Instagram, I can go Instagram DMs, I can go Instagram stories, I can go Instagram

[01:26] posts, I can go Instagram Reels, I have all these different media within the platform.

[01:30] One level below that is how much volume am I doing within that media.

[01:33] Am I posting one story a day?

[01:35] One story a week, multiple stories a day, multiple posts a day.

[01:38] So like that car, practical agency.

[01:40] If there are a hundred other agencies that market to carpractors and they're all marketing

[01:44] on Facebook, then you could probably add up all of the ads, bend it, every one of those

[01:48] agencies together.

[01:49] And that just gives you an idea of how much there is available in terms of number of

[01:54] new clients, per month, that all of them together are selling just on Facebook ads.

[01:58] Re-worn real quick, if you're trying to pick what market you're going to go in, I talk

[02:01] about this in my book, kind of a lot of offers, there's four things I want to look at.

[02:04] Number one, are they in pain?

[02:05] Am I actually solving a problem for someone?

[02:07] Number two, are they easy to find?

[02:08] Because if I can't find them, I can't sell them.

[02:11] Number three, do they have the money to spend in order to buy my thing?

[02:14] Is if I'm trying to sell to broke people, it's probably not going to be good idea.

[02:16] Number four, are they growing?

[02:18] I don't want to be selling a newspapers, I want to be selling to something like bold people

[02:21] that are there's more of them every single day that are retiring.

[02:24] If I have a market that checks off for those boxes, then I know I'm at least in a good

[02:27] opportunity.

[02:28] Now, once I have that in place, and I looked at the four variables that I talked about

[02:32] earlier, can I do a new method?

[02:34] Can I do it on a new platform?

[02:35] Can I expand a multiple types of media within the platform on curly-on?

[02:38] Can I increase the volume that I'm currently doing in the mediums that I have?

[02:42] These are the things you can do immediately to get more customers, get more leads today.

[02:47] Let's say you've cached all of those things, which is probably not true.

[02:50] But let's say you did because we're going into fantasy later.

[02:53] I'm going to introduce you to what I call the pyramid of markets.

[02:58] There are five directions that you can go in any marketplace to expand.

[03:01] I'll tell you a story of when I learned this.

[03:03] I went to this meetup of eight entrepreneurs together, we were doing $500 million

[03:07] a year in revenue.

[03:08] This was like a multi-billion dollar room, which is kind of cool.

[03:11] I was one of the smallest guys there.

[03:13] I think I was doing 30-ish million a year at the time.

[03:15] They were talking about their businesses.

[03:17] I was like, these guys aren't smarter than me.

[03:18] I didn't feel like they worked any harder than me.

[03:20] I was like, why are they making so much money than me?

[03:22] Two main factors.

[03:23] Number one, almost all of them have been in business longer than me.

[03:25] Big shit takes time and I had to learn that.

[03:27] I want you to feel that because it took me a long time to learn.

[03:31] There's not many billionaires under 30 that made it themselves.

[03:36] 10.

[03:37] In the whole fucking world, there's not a lot of them.

[03:38] Fact-checkers may be his 20.

[03:39] There's not a lot.

[03:40] The second lesson that I learned is that all of them are going after bigger markets than

[03:44] I was.

[03:45] At the point, you do saturate a niche.

[03:46] And I'm going to give you context to what that means.

[03:48] So Jim wants us to license and company.

[03:50] We specifically, at the time, only focused on microgms.

[03:53] Now we do health clubs and microgms because they expanded the market.

[03:56] Within that pie, there were only 50,000 microgms in the United States.

[03:59] We'd already spoken with 20,000 of them.

[04:01] We had, absolutely, have really maximized every media, every channel.

[04:05] We co-call, we call to you, we run ads, and Google your ads, and YouTube, we run stuff,

[04:08] Facebook, Instagram, we make content like we do all the stuff.

[04:12] We have really done a good job building a market leading business there.

[04:15] But again, it wasn't as big as theirs, and that's why we decided to open up another

[04:19] avenue.

[04:20] Now let me tell you about why we decided to do health clubs.

[04:21] So when we looked at our adjacent markets, we could have gone down market to personal

[04:26] trainers.

[04:27] We could have gone up market to health clubs.

[04:28] We could have gone to physical therapists or co-practors actually very similar.

[04:32] Or we could have gone more narrow.

[04:34] Those are the directions we could have gone.

[04:35] I asked our team one question.

[04:37] I said, of these different potential avenues or avatars that we could pursue, who do

[04:42] we provide the most value to.

[04:43] By dollars' may.

[04:44] It was no contest, health club owners, we were able to immediately make them like tens of thousands

[04:49] of dollars within the first month by restructuring some of the things that we could do

[04:53] within their business, and then doubling or tripling their bottom line by reorganizing

[04:57] their onboarding process, reorganizing their sales process, how they handle retention, and

[05:00] how they handle upsells.

[05:01] So if you deal with hair salons, maybe you sell consulting service.

[05:05] You sell to salons.

[05:06] That's your current market.

[05:07] You can go in five directions.

[05:09] Number one is you can go up market.

[05:11] That means on the pyramid there are fewer people on the higher part of the market and they

[05:15] cost more, but they spend more.

[05:17] Typically higher quality customers.

[05:18] That's where you go into enterprise sales.

[05:20] We're talking franchise doors as in people who have hundreds of locations under one umbrella

[05:25] or multi-location or chain owner.

[05:27] That's up market for salon owners.

[05:29] Down market, the second direction you can go is you go to hair stylist.

[05:32] You talk about people who are running chairs and doing hair with their hands full time not

[05:37] running the business.

[05:38] There's ten times more of them.

[05:39] The third direction you can go is you can go adjacent.

[05:42] So what's something that's similar in nature, but not exactly the same.

[05:46] That would be like a lash and nails place.

[05:48] But if our car factory might be physical therapy, like they're similar but different.

[05:52] You want similar business characteristics, similar avatars in terms of the owner, similar

[05:56] types of customer within the same larger industry.

[05:59] When you do that, you just open up another vertical and you attack it the same way you

[06:02] did your first one.

[06:03] The fourth direction you can go is you actually go broader.

[06:06] Now imagine a pyramid that's all the way like this and it includes all the adjacent

[06:11] pyramids within it which would then just be beauty.

[06:14] So that includes Medspot owners, lash owners, massage studio, like all of that kind of

[06:18] falls in the same psychographic they serve the same customer.

[06:22] So that would be going broader if we wanted to really open up the net.

[06:25] The last direction you can go is the only one that makes your market smaller but it doesn't

[06:29] necessarily mean you make less money.

[06:31] You could become narrower.

[06:32] Kind of just being also lawn owners, it might be salon owners who specialize in extensions

[06:37] or a blow hair place.

[06:39] They just do the Brazilian blowouts.

[06:40] They're just doing that specific thing.

[06:43] Oftentimes when you do niche down, sometimes you can still make more money because

[06:47] if you're not even close to tapping the method, the platform, the media or the total

[06:50] amount of volume you need to do to reach all of those people within that niche.

[06:54] And so then when you niche down become more specific with your messaging or offer and

[06:58] the value delivered.

[07:00] Because if you can make this one specific avatar, 10 times more money than the broad avatar,

[07:04] you should absolutely niche down on that.

[07:05] And we've done this with companies and doubled or tripled or sometimes 5x the revenue

[07:09] of business, despite cutting down who they market to by 85% by getting really specific about

[07:15] who we serve best.

[07:16] Big picture zooming all the way back out.

[07:18] If right now you're not getting as many leads as you want.

[07:20] And you think that your market is saturated because of what you do.

[07:23] You should be looking the way an investor looks at the marketplace and says, this is a 60 billion

[07:28] dollar industry.

[07:29] I have not even 1% of this industry.

[07:32] My whole point here is you have your four initial levers that you can immediately pull to

[07:36] grow how many leads you get and you probably haven't even done one of them.

[07:39] Do one of them, do another one of them and then eventually try and do them all.

[07:43] Usually there's this big checklist that you probably already know as an entrepreneur of what

[07:46] I call the should do.

[07:47] I know I should be calling my lead strategy.

[07:49] I know I should be following up better.

[07:50] I know I should be making more content.

[07:52] I know I should start a cold call thing.

[07:54] I know I should be running ads on more platforms.

[07:56] But you're not.

[07:57] And if you're like, man, that's going to take a long time.

[07:59] Welcome to the main point I had originally, which is it takes time to build big shit.

[00:00] You guys went here something absolutely insane. I was able to take home more than a year the CEOs of McDonald's Ikea

[00:07] Ford Motorola and Yahoo

[00:11] combined as a kid in his 20s and

[00:15] I have continued to for over half a decade

[00:19] Which results in a $200 million per year for full of and a hundred million dollar and I worth by age 32 and

[00:24] No one is more surprised than me

[00:27] Meeks pressing that back will create and re-en some

[00:31] anger at others

[00:33] Skepticism and most confusion in old people and

[00:36] Inspire select few you are going to make this presentation for it

[00:41] But before I dive in raise your hand if you like any of the following things to happen

[00:46] To be able to charge two times five time ten times more than your competition for the exact same thing like Yeti

[00:54] We have basically identical cops and somehow they're able to charge $40 versus ten dollars simply because of what's on the cup

[01:01] If you'd like to be able to have customers buy from you over and over and over again without

[01:06] Considering competition like Harley once you're a Harley guy you stay a Harley guy for life

[01:13] And if you'd like to virtually guarantee sales in any new business or product that you launch like Apple a lot of people just

[01:20] We'd lie they say just leave my credit card just bill me and send whatever you're gonna come out with and that's more or less

[01:25] How a lot of Apple buyers are once they become an apple person they become an apple person for life

[01:31] It's up you like that stuff great because that's what this talk is about

[01:36] And so I couldn't figure out how these brands these companies were able to do this demand these prices get people to stay loyal for really long time

[01:45] And I

[01:47] Feel like for me I always had to like big borrow and steal and I'd squeeze and push so hard just to get people to buy

[01:53] Whereas these companies made it look effortless and

[01:57] It's because I didn't understand this one thing and that's the subject of the talk today brand and

[02:03] The thing is even people who claim to understand it often don't and the few who do understand it do a terrible

[02:10] I'm teaching it so the stuff is gonna be marketing one of one class on branding presentation colors and logos

[02:16] And this definitely isn't going to be about feelings presence intuition or whatever

[02:23] This is about making money and

[02:25] This concept that I'm going to explain to you is how I build a 7.8 million person audience across all these platforms in the past 40 months or so

[02:33] I sold over a million copies of my last two books

[02:36] And your deals worth hundreds of million dollars in our holding company acquisition calm

[02:40] That is why you build a brand or least that's why I built mine and so today I'm gonna cover three things

[02:46] Number one what branding is?

[02:49] You don't know what it is you certainly can't build one number two

[02:52] Why it makes money because once you have a built you're like okay, well, how do I trade this thing for doll hairs?

[02:57] Which is what we want and then third how to start and grow yours?

[03:02] So let's start with the first one what branding is so when I decided to build a brand

[03:07] I'll let's it what many popular markets are said about it

[03:11] Here are some popular definitions that I have removed the marketers from them

[03:15] It's not throwing shade time just saying them a brand is a person's gut feeling about a product service organization

[03:21] A brand is not what you say it is it's what they say it is a brand is a set of expectations memory stories and relations to that take it together

[03:27] The count for a customer's decision to choose one product or service over another a brand is emotional

[03:32] Shorthand for accumulated and assumed information a brand is present when the value of what the product service or personality means to its audience is greater

[03:39] Then what it does for the audience a brand is a product for the concept that is publicly distinguished for other product services or concepts

[03:45] So it could be easily communicated and usually marketed

[03:48] Branding is the process of creating and disseminating the brand name. It's called ease and personality

[03:52] The promotion of a particular product or company by means of advertising and distinctive design if these sound vague and

[04:00] Confusing it's because they are and I was just just confused as you when I was trying to figure it out

[04:07] Because none of them told me what to do and so after looking at all these marketers words

[04:12] I think I pieced it together

[04:15] At least enough that once I started thinking about this way in a different way. I'm about sure with you my brand grew and it grew fast

[04:22] And the reason this is so important is that if you don't know what to do nothing's going to change fundamentally

[04:27] If you don't change your behavior obviously nothing's going to change as a result

[04:29] It's only to find this one term before we get going

[04:32] Learn it who here came to learn

[04:36] There's your hands fantastic or are there other words just being talking the wall?

[04:39] So learning means same condition

[04:42] New behavior and so if I wanted to teach someone a phone script

[04:47] Then after teaching you the phone rings again and you say the new script

[04:53] You learned learning occurred on the other hand if I tried to teach you the script and then the phone rings again and then you change nothing

[05:02] No learning occurred you learned nothing and

[05:06] That's why none of this stuff that these guys said helped me because I didn't know what I could do

[05:11] I didn't know what behavior I had to change the result of this

[05:15] So I did not it and so here's how burning happens

[05:20] Branding is a deliberate pairing of things

[05:23] Through an outcome so I'll say that again

[05:26] Burning is a deliberate pairing of things through an outcome

[05:31] So let's use Coca-Cola drinking it and liking it as our example the yum aka the outcome that's what people get

[05:40] They pair that with drinking the action so they do to get it with Coca-Cola the product

[05:48] So the next time you want some yum you're probably going to reach for a

[05:53] Coca-Cola if that was paired for you successfully

[05:56] It's a branding is a deliberate pairing of things throughout the outcome that's it

[06:01] But sometimes

[06:02] Businesses pair stuff pair their stuff with things that people don't like

[06:07] That's bad brandy

[06:10] This leads to losses for the business

[06:13] Now some of you guys may have seen this. This is Dillin Mulvaney doing a collaboration with Bud Light

[06:19] There's a lot of pressure on this advertisement

[06:21] This advertisement was actually agreed advertisement and you might think I'm crazy

[06:26] But it was let me explain it's just not the way you might think it was

[06:30] This is a great advertisement because it let a lot of people know about their stuff it let a lot of people know about the product about Bud Light

[06:38] By the way to curious that is the definition of advertising not branding advertising is letting people know about your stuff

[06:46] Branding is the pairing that occurs as a result

[06:48] So it was good advertising but bad branding

[06:52] Many customers hated this pairing lots of people found out but a lot of people hated it good advertising bad branding

[07:00] And so as a result of this bad branding people not liking the pairing fewer people both the product

[07:05] Which netty loss for the business and so to fix this

[07:10] Bud Light paired their product with stuff the audience liked

[07:13] Like Shane Gillis who is a man's man comedian and the UFC a man's man of sports if you will and sales begin to recover

[07:25] So that's the one-on-one explanation of branding

[07:29] Let's go into two-on

[07:31] So to go to the little zebra because the better you get it this the more money you will make like the more nuance you can understand

[07:36] How to brand and build a brand for yourself the more money will make I promise you that

[07:40] So to some people the Dilmalville Mulvaney pairing was actually good in general both good advertising and good branding

[07:48] Here we out for others. It was bad obvious

[07:53] All paris have positive and negative results and that's because everyone's different everyone has different preferences

[08:01] But for a business you can objectively see if a pairing was good or bad whether it needed you more money

[08:08] So

[08:09] More people dislike the Dilmalville Mulvaney

[08:12] Tough day. Dilmalvaney pairing so sales suffered making it a bad pairing

[08:17] So this isn't opinion they objectively made less money and so this pairing was a bad

[08:23] Four their ideal audience now the three-on-one version of this is is there a company or a product where the Dilmalvaney pairing could have been

[08:31] Both good advertising and good branding so that the majority of people would have bought I think the answer is yes

[08:37] It just doesn't necessarily mean it's but light for conservative males as the primary audience

[08:42] And on the other hand some people love the new gillys and UFC parings and

[08:47] Some hated it

[08:48] But more of the audience that is their ideal customer liked it saw it as good and so the business net

[08:56] It sales a result and they made more money good branding and

[09:00] So for Budweiser and I just want to call this out

[09:03] This is specifically for Budweiser in their customer base. It's not that singular so the UFC is magic in some way

[09:08] Or Dilmalvaney is unmagic in some way before that specific audience

[09:13] Yes, the pairing mattered and how much of the base liked it or disliked it

[09:18] So if you're anything like me

[09:20] Making money is the point

[09:22] So let's drive this home

[09:24] If you meet a pairing of your thing and your customer and you got to choose which outcome you had happened

[09:31] So you have your product and they drink it

[09:34] There's an outcome that happens afterwards, right that pairs with it on one hand 75% like it and 25 hated

[09:42] But on the other hand 25% like it and 75% hate it which would be the bottom example

[09:47] Which would you choose

[09:49] More one a good the big the big green one yes of course the top one

[09:55] Because it would make you the most money

[09:58] Instead of be clear for the two of one level of understanding

[10:01] Branding always happens

[10:04] Branding always occurs

[10:07] But our goal is good branding

[10:10] And good branding is a deliberate pairing of our business with good outcomes for our ideal customers

[10:18] And so what you pair your business with determines two key things

[10:22] One

[10:22] Pro-pays attention to your business and two whether to go towards your business like the UFC example

[10:29] Or away for your business like the delimitate example

[10:33] And so the being in this I said I was going to cover three things the first thing I said is what is branding

[10:38] But now that we have gone through that I want to reset what I

[10:43] Walked us through which is what good branding is

[10:46] Ideally what we're shooting for

[10:49] So now we cover that let's talk about why it makes you money like good branding makes you money

[10:54] Branding is out of fine. It happens everywhere all the time

[10:56] But business is used for profit

[10:58] So let's look at some of the early uses of branding if you get how we can use it

[11:02] So these are the first entrepreneurs who use branding to make money

[11:08] The earliest version of branding that we can think of at least that I can think of

[11:12] Happened on life side. It was literally a brand they would heat up metal they'd seared into the side of a cattle

[11:18] And they would get a lovely little logo maybe we'll have a Nike swoosh cow someday and so they literally burn these symbols into animals

[11:25] And those symbols had a magical effect

[11:29] So let's say you're walking around and you see a cow with no bread you say hello cow the cow says move back and it has nothing on it

[11:36] This is just a cow

[11:37] You might leave it alone

[11:41] And that might be it

[11:43] On the other hand, let's say the cow has a bread you recognize say it's your neighbors you might be like hey that's bills cow

[11:49] Now

[11:50] If you like bill you might grab the cow and pull him by the whatever you pull cows by and probably return it to bill

[11:59] If you hate bill then the cow may stay lost in the wilderness forever and become lunch for your family

[12:05] For the next month or two in the form of delicious burgers

[12:09] move

[12:10] But either way

[12:11] for better or for worse the brand affected what you did it affected your behavior

[12:19] And so to take this to the two of one level

[12:23] What if you see a branded cow but you don't recognize the brand you might be like who this I see a logo

[12:29] But I don't know anything about it

[12:31] Well then you would treat it how you treat branded animals in general in that you just know that it belongs to someone

[12:37] And so you would treat it the way that you'd treat it as though belonged to anybody else

[12:43] And even if only a tiny bit you would treat a wild cow different from a brand of cow in general

[12:48] So if you had one that was wild and you had one that you did and recognized but was branded you would still probably treat them differently

[12:54] So that just shows you the power of brand as a concept because it dictates a tie between that cow and a human being

[13:01] Or some complex animal that can brand cows

[13:04] And so these are all effects of brand in general

[13:07] So that's how it affects what people do

[13:10] And so now we want to get tactical on how to get how we translate that concept and getting them to buy

[13:15] So let's say we pair our bread so this is where we get really tactile and this is like okay

[13:18] If you don't have a bread, this is the step by step right now

[13:22] So you have a weak brand and we say it's a week brand because it's starting out you don't really a lot of association

[13:26] Fits us so now you want to pair it with people experiences other cuss other stuff that your ideal customer likes

[13:33] So in this instance I'm using little Nike pairing with LeBron and Tiger who are champions or class goats et cetera

[13:39] And so people who like sports and competition would see that probably as a positive pairing

[13:44] AKA good stuff and so if we do that pairing we make that pairing

[13:50] For the majority of people bringing will occur and so the brand grows

[13:55] And so the question then follows what's the benefit of a strong brand versus a weak brand?

[14:01] And so the the weak brand is before the pairing the strong brand is after the pair

[14:06] So a strong brand turns commoditized products like a five dollar white t-shirt

[14:10] Plus the strong brand into a premium product a higher value brand name product

[14:17] And pre-improdux with a strong brand

[14:21] Then get customers to want to pair themselves with the product so that they can associate the outcome

[14:29] Them cells with the outcome the brand delivers

[14:32] Which they do with their money so how do they make that association?

[14:35] They give money they get the shirt the association happens based on what they've seen where that logo has been elsewhere

[14:42] And so then they go from I want to be a winner to changing money and saying now I am a winner or I feel like a winner

[14:49] That's how this works and so this means that if the ideal customer likes sports winning and competition

[14:54] Et cetera, then they're more likely to buy stuff from a brand paired with those things

[14:59] So let's lay it all out

[15:01] weak brand

[15:03] paired with stuff customers like

[15:05] creates a strong brand

[15:07] strong brand

[15:09] gets put onto a winning product

[15:10] Transforms a generic to winning product

[15:13] then the customers want to

[15:15] associate with that winning product so they buy the product and they put money into your bank out in order to do it

[15:21] And so as long as you knit a positive between what it cost you to associate with tiger and lebron

[15:27] And how many t-shirts you can sell a result you make money

[15:32] And so here are some steps in words for those you were more word people

[15:37] You start with a brand that means nothing you have a logo just like the cow that the other person in recognize people know that it is a brand

[15:43] They just don't know what that brand means yet so it means nothing right now

[15:48] Then you pair that brand with something where someone that your customer is ideally like

[15:53] Third your brand starts to mean the thing customer likes to them

[15:57] Then they want to associate themselves with that thing they like or get more of it

[16:03] But they can't buy that thing

[16:05] But they can buy a tiny sliver of that association

[16:09] So they buy the shirt with the logo that means that thing to them

[16:13] And so they get the shirt you get the money and it all happened because you deliberately paired with something they like

[16:20] And this happens everywhere so dulce and gabbana classic example

[16:24] They paired with Kim Kardashian they made a line specifically for her and so for a lady who wants to associate with

[16:31] fame

[16:32] beauty

[16:33] wealth

[16:35] That would be a pairing that makes sense and so that lady who wants other people to associate her with fame

[16:42] High-class money luxury well will then buy dulce and gabbana and be like I'm just like him now she might not say that directly because she might just

[16:49] associate with the values but the transfer and still happens

[16:54] And so when someone looks at two

[16:56] Products that on the surface are generally the same you've got two t-shirts one that has a week brand or no brand and the other that has the strong brand

[17:05] The person that has the strong brand they're going to be more likely to buy and pay more for

[17:13] And this happens because they actually buy the elements that we've deliberately paired with the brand which they identify with

[17:20] And at this point of building a bread

[17:22] You do this to change customer behavior and that is to you meet that is the point of building a brand to change customer behavior in your favor

[17:30] When they see it with a product

[17:33] And so this is a quote from Warbuff that I like a lot kind of specifying some of the elements of the benefits of bread

[17:38] So the single most important decision in evaluating business is pricing power if you've got the power to race prices without losing business to a competitor

[17:46] You've got a very good business and if you have to have a predecessor before raising the price by 10% then you've got a terrible business

[17:52] And so if we have an unbredd it's sure for five dollars and we say you know what we think we have a strong enough brand that we can raise the price

[17:59] And then boom we can raise the price and still not lose that many sales

[18:03] But we in this it case 12x the price good branding drives that premium pricing

[18:11] Good branding also

[18:13] Improves advertising so with the generic brand if you're marketing this white t-shirt you might get half a percent of people

[18:18] There are many white t-shirts

[18:20] There are many like it this one is mine just get it so the put those you got the reference

[18:25] So if you have a point five percent click the rate on something that's generic

[18:29] There's nothing special about it on the flip side if you have a Nike bread t-shirt

[18:34] Same identical t-shirt and it has the swish now you might get six times as many people click and

[18:39] Buy at a higher price see how these things stack together

[18:43] That is why these brands exist for such a long period of time and makes so much money

[18:48] So they get cheaper customers they get higher returns and they have better response rates in advertising

[18:55] In on top of that if if as if there weren't enough good branding also drives customer loyalty aka

[19:00] They buy more stuff more times and so like the Apple example I gave earlier once you buy one apple product

[19:07] You tend to buy more and you tend to keep buying them and so this also a good brand

[19:12] Also protect your business from competitors stealing that customer in the future

[19:16] And so as I promised them beginning who seeing how this all the stuff allows you to

[19:21] One be able to charge 10 times more than your competition

[19:25] Two get higher returns and advertising so you can scale that much more that much faster and then three get people to keep buying for life

[19:31] Compounding your money making skills for good

[19:35] Okay, which is why I'm building a brand will make you lots of money

[19:39] It's also why brands outperform commodities in every single industry

[19:45] In give a lasting competitive edge that to be fair is there's to lose

[19:49] So there's another quote from Uncle Warren it takes 20 years to build a reputation in five minutes to ruin it if you think about that

[19:55] You'll do things differently and

[19:58] So I said that I was gonna cover three things one what branding is which we read in what good branding is

[20:03] Second why makes you money and we got that so now

[20:07] Let's go to how to start or grow your own brand

[20:10] So if branding is the deliberate pairing of things you're thing plus what your ideal customer has three outcome

[20:16] and good branding is the delivering of your thing with something good

[20:20] To start a brand we have to know what we want to pair it with two track ideal customers

[20:27] So here we've got but light you have see good outcome for the majority of the audience

[20:32] And we want to understand that just as much as we should also understand

[20:37] Which who avoid pairing our brand with to lose customers like the Domo Vite example

[20:42] And so here's how I like to think about assembling the pairings for brand so if you're a ground zero

[20:48] You have you have no brand you've got these elements that haven't been put together yet

[20:52] So I think about it like

[20:55] A table full of flowers

[20:57] So if you want to put it in bouquet together you start by having lots of different flowers all over the place

[21:02] On their own those flowers are not a bouquet

[21:06] Just as products values experience people, etc. on their own are not a brand

[21:11] The flowers are like the brand element that we pair with stuff are audiences like

[21:17] With enough pairing over and over and over again they form a bouquet

[21:23] Now replace the word bouquet with brand

[21:26] And so that assembly is the connection is the association between those things because the brand fundamentally

[21:32] Doesn't actually exist if I take the flowers out of the base and scatter them across was there ever a brand to begin with

[21:39] It's simply the association we make between those things that creates the one of one

[21:44] brand

[21:47] And if we unravel what the brand disappears

[21:50] And so the delivery pairing of those things makes the bread and if we want to get narrower on our brand so let's say I talk about

[21:57] tacos lifting and philosophy

[22:00] If I want to narrow my brand I'll just talk a bunch about tacos and then all of my flowers are just taco related

[22:07] If I'm only talking about tacos but I want to expand the stuff I'm talking about to my audience and maybe capture a wider audience

[22:14] Then I might talk about

[22:16] Tacos, case of deez, burritos, things that are tangential and then if I want to expand even broader

[22:20] I might just talk about food in general and then I might tuck in

[22:24] I'll go all that I might talk in restaurants and then things that go

[22:28] wider and wider from there and so we get narrower as we niche down and we go double down on one type of topic

[22:35] And we go broader when we branch out

[22:38] But distant and random pairings hurt a bread because they're so hard to make the associations with

[22:46] And this is what most brands are and do

[22:49] Most people's brands happen by accident. It's just whatever they appear next to

[22:55] Whatever their people associate their stuff with

[22:58] Good branding happens on purpose

[23:00] Because like what are we looking at with a bike a single flower some socks and a burger not a lot not a lot to hold together

[23:08] And so think about like curating a garden you want some flowers to grow and you want to pull out the weeds

[23:13] You have to do both you have to add the good and take away the bed in order to assemble the

[23:18] Ideal brand for you

[23:21] And in the beginning our brand won't be strong just like yours one if you're building it

[23:24] Then you might only have a couple flowers there and it's because you haven't had that many

[23:29] Instances to pair your brand for that customer

[23:35] But the more good stuff we pair with our brand for the customer the stronger it gets you go from one flower to many red flowers or many red roses

[23:44] That's just that become a bouquet of red roses

[23:46] That's what you're about and the more you're about it the more the brand strengthens

[23:51] Now, what if we make a branding mistake and pair with the wrong thing because it's going to happen

[23:57] One bad pairing can absolutely hurt a brand so if I now give my this lovely red rose bouquet of my wife and I say hey

[24:05] Don't you love this bouquet and she sees this rotten flower singing out of front she might be like

[24:10] This bouquet sucks war this brand sucks or hey that guy got a DUI and I thought he was this paramount of good ethics

[24:18] Well, that would hurt the bread and so just like one ugly flower messes up the whole bouquet

[24:24] It changes how everyone sees the bread this bouquet sucks

[24:28] Now to recover from something like that you just have to overwhelm customers with the stuff they like until eventually

[24:34] The bad pairing shrinks into a relivots so we don't try to eliminate the DUI we don't try to eliminate the devros

[24:40] It happened there's nothing we can do about it

[24:42] But what we try to do is just overwhelm it with way more of the stuff that the majority of our people actually like and

[24:48] So Kanye for example has said some things that people don't like

[24:53] But he also comes out with products that people love he made a super bowl add

[24:57] He's still choose he just came out with an album that came out after having some cancel culture stuff around him and things he had said

[25:04] And so over time people forgot the bad stuff and associated the cassette back with him and purchased

[25:10] They still bought

[25:13] And so you need to decide what values people experience is set or that you want to use to connect the audience to your product

[25:22] And equally importantly what things you want to avoid remove or ignore from the stuff they hate

[25:28] And so it goes without saying that even if you say your premium

[25:33] But people think your things sucks that suck will stick and so up to this point everything I've talked about has been the things

[25:39] External to the product they've been the people you associate the product with no most all of that occurs

[25:44] Fryer to purchase so you can absolutely get someone to buy the thing

[25:49] But how many experiences are people are going to have with this thing once they've purchased it

[25:56] Probably far more than they have with your advertisement and so the advertisement can let people know about it

[26:01] The branding makes a good association for the person they make the purchase and then afterwards the product does a lot of the branding after that

[26:08] Because if I buy that amazing Nike t-shirt and there is a hole in the armpit when it comes in

[26:13] I might say this is the first time ever bought a Nike product this product sucks

[26:18] Therefore Nike sucks and then I think the whole thing is a shame and then I also start to hate LeBron for even recommend

[26:24] Right, so she transfer backwards

[26:27] Now on the flip side

[26:29] Brand can influence how people see the product so if the product is what I would call good enough

[26:34] So it's it doesn't have any holes in it now is it the highest quality of possibly could be maybe not

[26:40] But it's good enough that no one's gonna find an immediate problem of the product

[26:44] That's where brand can carry you the extra distance to still make it a positive experience for the person and so brand in a very real way can affect how people perceive

[26:53] value through products

[26:56] Now I'm personally the support tip here

[26:59] If I'm going to charge a premium price I absolutely want to make sure that the product is dialed so that I only further reinforce how much they like my brand rather than

[27:08] Let my brand carry me or at worst have it conflict with the impression that I gave them the thing they're going to buy prior to them buying it

[27:15] This is a quote from Warren your premium brand had better be delivering something special or it's not gonna get the business and the only tweak

[27:21] I'd have on this is it it's not going to keep the business

[27:25] You'll get the first purchase you just won't get the ones after that

[27:29] And so all the things are like okay, God it so brand is pairing I get how the pairing makes me money

[27:35] I have these big margins I got more CTRs more people buy and as long as my thing doesn't suck

[27:40] You know ideally that it's good people keep buying awesome, but how do I measure that?

[27:46] So braid as three main metrics

[27:48] One which is influence which is how likely it is to change someone's behavior

[27:52] So if I show someone a brand and they react in any way

[27:56] They recognize it and they they do something about it

[27:59] Then we have influence second is direction. Are they changing the way we wanted

[28:05] Where they running away and

[28:07] Third how many people it changes for?

[28:11] That's it so if I show a 100 people and a hundred people react versus two people react the hundred person reacting

[28:17] At least recognition that is the reach how many people it changes it for so take into the hypothetical

[28:23] Extreme a small week and neutral brand very few people recognize and the people that do

[28:29] Don't care that much about it either way and

[28:32] On the other polar stream you have a large large strong positive red so that would be lots of people recognize the brand

[28:38] It changes behavior when they see the brand and the behavior is generally towards so they tried to in a

[28:44] Corridor with what that brand is asking someone to do and I want to make this point

[28:50] A lot of people have this misnomer that any strong brand is polar that because lots of people love it

[28:57] Lots of people also have to hate it now. I say this by percentage not necessarily by absolute if you have

[29:01] If the whole United States knows you are you're going to have a percentage people that hate you

[29:05] Just because there's crazy people and that's how we're talking about I'm saying is there a brand that can't have that kind of status

[29:11] That isn't polar so I'll give a polar example first

[29:15] So I have the silhouette of Donald Trump here and he has a very strong brand

[29:19] He's a big reach lots of people recognize him even just to silhouette alone people recognize

[29:25] He has strong influence as in the percentage of people that when they see this have a reaction

[29:30] Either direction positive or negative, but just that they react shows that he has strong influence

[29:35] And the third is the direction now for him. He is polar meaning many people move towards him

[29:41] Very strongly and many people move away from him very strong

[29:46] And so many assume that all brands are that way and that's just because there are many examples of that

[29:50] But it doesn't mean it has to be that way and so I'll give you a different example

[29:55] So some brands manage to change many people's behavior towards them all at once and so like Taylor Swift

[30:03] Sure, I'm sure she's got some crazy. Don't get me wrong

[30:05] But the vast majority of people who see Taylor Swift recognize her

[30:10] She changes their behavior and most of the time it's towards her

[30:13] So she is a large positive strong brand

[30:16] This is also personally why I think the idea of like seeking out controversy

[30:21] Absolutely gets you recognized

[30:22] But you don't have to make that trade

[30:25] You can't absolutely just build a strong positive brand. Mother Teresa has a strong positive brand a lot of people know her

[30:30] Influest lot of behavior did a lot of good stuff must be really like I hate mother Teresa

[30:35] Some people do but most people don't and the same thing goes with apple

[30:40] A lot of people like their products. I'm sure there are some tech eats that are like antlers way better

[30:44] Right are like PC's awesome and that's great. That's good for them

[30:47] But the vast majority of people who encounter the product like it which is why they're one of the largest companies in the world

[30:54] So all those examples that it gives you up to this point have assumed a large audience and I do that because this is a

[30:59] Prestition and it makes more sense for me to work with you on stuff that you already know

[31:03] But this concept carries independent of whether you have large reach and this is why it applies to you

[31:08] So if you have a small audience with high influence, what would you have?

[31:13] God mom and dad

[31:15] They are high influence as in most people when they see their parents the behavior changes

[31:22] They have low reach because for you they're only your parents. They might have any other fault

[31:27] They might be some other other people's parents, but not very many people's parents as you have low reach

[31:33] And it will be your behavior will towards for some and away for others

[31:38] Meaning some people hate their parents and don't want to do anything they say and some people like their parents to do whatever they say and there's a lot of people in between

[31:45] And so that's how we measure if what we're doing to grow our brain is actually working our more people finding out about it

[31:52] Our more people changing their behavior when they do it and ideally are they doing that towards the direction that we want them to go

[31:57] So if I say hey everybody go click here go download this thing go attend this event

[32:02] Go buy this product whatever it is if a lot of people do that then we know that the bread is growing

[32:09] And so we want when we want to build our brand we want to pair our stuff for the things the highest percentage of our audience like

[32:16] And so whenever we pair anything with a brand

[32:18] Because especially if you're starting out everything is new and so every new pairing has risk

[32:24] And so you risk losing a certain percentage of your audience who has a bad experience of the thing you pair

[32:29] There's always that risk there's always going to be some people who don't like something you do if anyone see a small time band go hit it big

[32:36] Some of the old counters like oh they sold out they did whatever but what they did was they

[32:40] Gambled the short-term loss of that local audience potentially for a much broader bigger audience

[32:45] So they made a bet they did lose people they did gain people they just gained more than they lost and

[32:50] So to the same degree when you make that bet it's the local band you risk gaining other people who have had a positive experience with this new thing

[32:57] And ideally we have more green than red and

[33:00] So those news parings the new parings you make with a brand always lose audience right he sold out

[33:05] I like the old stuff better this also happens with content by the end so this person is the red bucket fantastic

[33:12] And the new stuff might also cost people to say no this new stuff rocks and that person is in the green bucket

[33:19] And so whenever you try to grow and you make any new pairing meaning you make new content

[33:24] You make a new genre you're making new song you make a new anything

[33:29] You make a bet

[33:31] That more people from where I deal audience will like the pairing the people who don't

[33:34] TLDR that you'll net an increase in reach influence and positive direction

[33:40] And so my ask for over here is don't let the five mean comments stop you from gaining the 500 new people who like the new thing

[33:50] So many finish the real life example to make this whole thing real for you

[33:53] I want to associate myself with business value

[33:56] So I associate myself with making people money and growing their businesses so there's me

[34:01] There's me making content and then ideally money and

[34:05] So the best way I can do this is make content bore the small business under kids to consume and

[34:10] Books for them to read and use so that they then profit

[34:15] The good thing and then they associate that growth and profit with me

[34:22] And so then they consume more of my stuff they drink the next soda

[34:27] They buy the next shirt

[34:29] And so the next time they wanted to happen again

[34:32] They take the action for they have a higher likelihood of taking the desired action

[34:36] And equally important people who don't like business stuff won't like my stuff or they'll just prefer to watch other things

[34:42] So you've got this married couple they say we hate people who talk about money. They're probably not gonna like my stuff

[34:47] And that's okay

[34:50] But

[34:52] People who

[34:54] Like business

[34:55] Have a business or are trying to start one might want more and

[34:59] This grows the bread because people could assume the stuff and they say hey you got to check out her was stuff and the

[35:04] That person they tell to just says right on they check it out

[35:06] They get that positive outcome they make the pairing as well and the brand grows and ideally with my deal audience

[35:13] And so to see this in action if you use this information from today to make money

[35:19] Good branding has occurred

[35:22] And so I said I was gonna cover three things what branding is and do you look good rating is why makes you money and how to start and grow yours

[35:28] So hopefully you feel like I fulfilled those three things and so now we can test if the pairing good branding actually occurred

[35:36] So if you were my ideal customer so here's a business owner

[35:43] We can see objectively of this provided value. Did we get a good positive outcome a neutral outcome or a narrative one you might be like I hate this guy talk about money

## Full Transcript
[00:00] This is exactly what I did to make my first $10,000 online, and I'm gonna walk you through how I got my first in customers,

[00:06] what I did right, what I did wrong, so that you can copy me.

[00:09] So I had always been into fitness. From the time I was 13, 14 years old, I was already lifting weights,

[00:14] and was really into in college, was the vice president of the powerlifting team, and then I had my consulting job.

[00:20] And I talked about fitness all day long, I read articles all day, and so much so that people I worked with were like,

[00:24] dude, if you don't get into fitness, we'll front you the money to do this because you don't stop talking about it.

[00:29] And so I annoyed enough people around me that I was like, okay, maybe I am gonna do this.

[00:32] And so that's what created the free training project.

[00:35] And so the idea was I would ask people to donate $500,000 to the tier to their choice,

[00:40] and in exchange, I would train them for three months for free.

[00:43] It was free because they didn't pay me, but they still had to donate to something they cared about.

[00:47] But the thing that really made it click for me were I was like, you know, I'm gonna do something here.

[00:51] Is that there was this lady at my gym named Sandy Smith, and she saw me working out,

[00:54] and I was on the powerlifting team in my local area.

[00:57] And I was competing and I had other guys who were competing there too.

[01:00] And it was clear that we knew we were doing something well.

[01:02] So she asked me because I looked the least intimidating because I was the most jacked.

[01:06] That's why I looked the least intimidating.

[01:07] She said, hey, can you hop me with my foot?

[01:10] And I was like, sure.

[01:12] And she said, well, meet me at a pizza shop, and you can talk to me with my foot, which is hilarious.

[01:18] I meet her at the pizza shop, and we talk for like an hour and a half about, you know,

[01:21] it's like, hey, try by these things that's in it that, you know, maybe get more protein in this is the stuff that I like.

[01:26] I got to walk through everything.

[01:27] And I was happy to do it because I just like talk about fitness stuff.

[01:29] And at the end of the conversation, she reaches down to her purse, and she puts her purse on the table,

[01:34] and then she reaches in and she grabs her checkbook.

[01:36] And she writes, a hundred dollar check to me, and the check was literally this big.

[01:41] It was a clown check, and I was like, why are you a clown?

[01:43] Why am I a clown?

[01:44] Is this a joke to you?

[01:45] Is my passion?

[01:46] Something that means nothing, and I'm kidding, none of those are.

[01:48] But she wrote me a check for a hundred bucks, and she was like, thanks so much.

[01:51] And she slid it across the table and she gave it to me.

[01:53] And then she walked out and I remember being like, holy shit, I can make money doing this.

[01:57] I was like, that's pretty cool.

[01:59] And so that was like the light bulb moment for me to say like, I'm an actually go from this is a passion

[02:04] to I want to make this something I make profit from.

[02:07] So there's four stages that I went through in order to get to my first in customers.

[02:11] So the first stage I started with was homies,

[02:14] retops the people who know you and like you.

[02:17] And so for me, honestly, all I did was I took out this amazing piece of technology, which is my phone.

[02:21] And then I looked through my context.

[02:24] Please, reach out to a handful of my friends.

[02:25] And I got about six of them, ish, to say yes, I will let you train me for free because

[02:31] we're friends and you need before and after pictures.

[02:35] And that's pretty much all I did.

[02:36] It wasn't really that hard because people knew that I loved fitness.

[02:39] And I just said, I'll help you for free and be a homey and they said short.

[02:43] And so the reason I started with homies specifically was because I needed before and afters.

[02:48] I needed testimonials.

[02:49] I needed results.

[02:50] I figured if anybody was like me, they would think, well, sure, maybe you say that you

[02:54] can do that, but why should I believe you?

[02:56] And so I solved really over the top and this habit, maybe I lucked into it the first time,

[03:01] but I have done it with every single business I have ever started, which is get proof

[03:05] before anything.

[03:06] Like if you have 100 pieces of proof and a terrible offer versus an amazing offer and no proof,

[03:11] the guy with 100 pieces of proof is going to win.

[03:12] You don't need that many pieces of proof for people to believe you.

[03:15] You need proof that it's similar enough to them that they will believe that what you did for

[03:19] that person will also work for them.

[03:21] And so the testimony is that I had one guy who lost 50 pounds, I had a girl who lost 50 pounds.

[03:26] I had a guy did like a recomposition.

[03:28] He stayed the same way, but like looked crazy different afterwards.

[03:31] And so that kind of like covered a handful of different avatars for me later.

[03:35] Now that wasn't on purpose.

[03:36] That just kind of worked out to who responded to me and they all had different goals.

[03:39] But it worked to show that I knew what I was doing.

[03:40] After I had my homies, this took me like six months.

[03:43] So my dudes, I will take three minutes in this video to explain it.

[03:46] But it was six months of my life.

[03:47] And if you're like, man, I want to get rich in six seconds.

[03:50] That's amazing.

[03:51] Wait for stage four.

[03:52] I'll tell you how what I would have done differently to make this happen faster.

[03:54] But the second step I did was I asked them for referrals.

[03:57] Referrals are the most important type of marketing for a variety of reasons.

[04:02] Number one, referrals are free.

[04:05] And so if you are poor, great place to start.

[04:08] Number two, referrals have higher likelihoods of buying at higher prices.

[04:13] So that means you, these leads are worth more than every other type of lead because they

[04:16] have a higher conversion rate.

[04:17] And at higher prices, which is banger, third reason that they're awesome or valuable leads

[04:22] is that people who come from referral are also more likely to refer.

[04:26] And so the way that you come in is the more likely way that you will get somebody else to

[04:29] commit.

[04:30] For all those reasons, referrals are sweet.

[04:32] The big picture reason that referrals are so important when you're starting is that if you're

[04:36] not getting any, it means you're not that good.

[04:38] And so you don't want to let more people know you suck.

[04:41] So instead, you want to let as few people know that you suck until eventually people find

[04:45] out about how good you are, which is the right thing.

[04:48] Then you can poor gas on the fire and do all the other ways of advertising.

[04:51] And so for those of you who are starting out who are really just at the very beginning here,

[04:55] then I want to give you what I wish I knew.

[04:57] And believe it or not, we're actually running this as little experiment inside of school

[05:01] right now and the results are astounding.

[05:03] I'm not going to show the stats yet, but they're really, really good.

[05:05] We took the rule of 100 for more outreach and we've actually kind of like broken it down

[05:10] into something a three step process that's really tactical.

[05:14] You're calling at the rule of 300.

[05:15] And if you don't know what the rule of 100 is, which I talk about in my $100 million

[05:19] lead book, it's the fundamental process of applying 100 repetitions to any of these things.

[05:23] So 100, a warm-out reach is means you reach out to people who know you.

[05:26] Mind you, doesn't have to be your homies.

[05:28] Like you probably have 300 friends on Facebook and 500 followers on Instagram or whatever.

[05:32] All you know, 300 people inside of yourself.

[05:34] Like those are all the people you know.

[05:35] You reach out 101 to 100 plus cold prospects.

[05:38] We don't know you.

[05:39] You spend 100 minutes making content and then you post that content to be clear.

[05:43] You don't just spend 100 minutes making content and do nothing.

[05:45] You post it.

[05:46] And then finally, you can spend $100 a day on ads at minimum.

[05:49] All right, that's how you get started.

[05:50] Obviously, you can spend more on ads, but you spend at least 100 minutes making the

[05:53] ads, researching, looking good hooks, recording, et cetera.

[05:55] But if you do that every single day, you will get customers because you will let people

[05:58] know that you exist.

[05:59] Now the rule of 300, it's really just taking the 100, the rule of 100, the rule of 100,

[06:03] four-war-mount reach and breaking it down into three steps.

[06:06] So I'll break down all three for you right now.

[06:08] So number one is you post content.

[06:11] Just make a post.

[06:12] All right.

[06:12] On one platform, very simple.

[06:14] All right, you don't need to over-complicate this.

[06:16] After you make the post, you do 100 comments.

[06:18] All right, this is really big.

[06:20] Now the comments, my recommendation is you do it inside of a group or community.

[06:24] Now the reason that we do it inside of a group is that one, it's going to be a pool

[06:28] of all of your ideal customers.

[06:29] And the goal of the comments is to make the best comment.

[06:32] All right, so if you look at all the comments that are on someone, when you make it as

[06:36] a comment inside of a group, there's two benefits that you have might not have thought of.

[06:40] One is that inside of a group, you're not competing against everyone.

[06:42] You're now just competing against everyone inside the group.

[06:44] Secondarily, you're not competing against everyone, even inside the group.

[06:47] You're competing against everyone in the comments.

[06:49] And so it makes you look like you're super good, even though you're just this much better

[06:52] because you actually took a minute to make comment rather than just like cool stuff or

[06:57] awesome, right?

[06:58] That's not going to do it.

[06:59] You have to put out a thought of response to each post.

[07:01] Now the post that you do, you should just use them as prompts.

[07:04] So it should be a lot easier for you to come over the comments than to come up with content.

[07:08] All right.

[07:09] So that's the second step.

[07:10] Now the third step is that we now basically apply the rule of 100 to our new warms list.

[07:16] You're like, what's the new warms list?

[07:18] So this is like a, it's like a lukewarm.

[07:20] It's like right between cold and warm.

[07:22] And so what it is is everyone who liked your post, anyone who commented on your post, and

[07:28] anyone who liked any of your comments, now this is going to be a pretty big one, or

[07:33] replied to your comment.

[07:35] All right.

[07:36] That basically gives you four different sources to find the leads that you do, your

[07:43] one on one outreach.

[07:45] So this should hopefully solve the big like, who do I reach out these people?

[07:50] These people.

[07:51] And the reason we did this and this is key.

[07:53] The reason that we go after these four people is because these four categories have all

[07:58] done one thing which changes them from strangers.

[08:01] They have taken an action.

[08:03] They have indicated interest.

[08:05] So the point of advertising, which I define in the leads book, is to go from an unengaged

[08:11] lead, which is just a person you can contact, to an engaged lead, which is a person you can

[08:15] contact who has shown interest in the stuff that you sell, or at least has shown interest

[08:20] in you with that.

[08:22] This sounds really minor, but it's huge.

[08:24] You can then begin the conversation by saying, hey, saw you liked my, my content.

[08:31] What about it drew you in or like what made you do that?

[08:34] Oh, that was so cool of you.

[08:35] Whatever.

[08:36] Hey, I saw you commented or thanks for that comment and question, right?

[08:40] Don't just say thanks for the comment.

[08:41] That's not going to start a conversation.

[08:42] Ask a question.

[08:43] What made you do that?

[08:44] Are you looking to get in shape, clean your house, get organized, whatever the thing

[08:48] your content was about?

[08:49] Hey, I saw that you liked my comment.

[08:51] Are you looking to, right?

[08:54] And so anybody who's following the type of content that you're commenting on, by the way,

[08:58] duh, comment on, like if you're selling dog stuff, comment on dog stuff, don't comment

[09:02] on, you know, crypto make money stuff and try and find dog people now, then again, who

[09:06] knows?

[09:07] But if I'm in a pick, if I'm going to pick where I'm going to make my comments, I'm

[09:11] going to target posts that already have the types of people that I want to sell to commenting

[09:16] and posting on it.

[09:17] All right.

[09:18] And then finally, people who replied to your comment are going to probably be some

[09:21] of the warmest leads because they've already read the thing, took the time that they

[09:24] already basically message you in a way by by replying to your comment.

[09:28] So this, if you think about this, is like, we only need a hundred.

[09:31] If you make a post and you get 25 likes, it's like boom, there's my first 25 reachouts.

[09:35] Then I've got people commented, maybe I've got three or four comments.

[09:38] Okay, there's another three or four.

[09:40] Then I make my hundred member, remember here.

[09:42] So let's link these up.

[09:43] So these two go to this and then these two go to this one.

[09:48] See if I can cross the chasm here.

[09:51] There.

[09:52] So if you then do a hundred comments, you're going to at least get a hundred likes or responses

[10:00] because if you actually take them as time, the person who you even who made you made the

[10:04] post on will likely take the time to like your comment because they want to encourage

[10:08] other people to leave long thoughtful comments like that.

[10:11] This is one or one legion for you not having any audience.

[10:16] So it's gone.

[10:17] Like you have no more excuse.

[10:19] This works and the results that we're getting are fucking awesome, which I'm really

[10:22] stoked about.

[10:23] I'll share the stats later.

[10:24] We're doing as a big experiment.

[10:25] And there's one more reason that I think this is really sexy.

[10:28] Then it's on a big post will get way more reach than your initial content, especially

[10:35] if you're starting from zero because you basically get to piggyback on the reach that

[10:39] other people's content gets.

[10:41] And so it's in a weird way.

[10:43] It's almost like you running mini ads.

[10:45] Now to be clear, you want to have thoughtful comments.

[10:47] You don't want to say like buy my shit.

[10:49] Like that will one probably get you blocked by the person who's content it is.

[10:52] But also you look like a shithead.

[10:53] So don't do that.

[10:54] So you want to have a thoughtful response and this will take time to be clear.

[10:58] Like well, how many hours a day will this take?

[10:59] And notice I mentioned hours a day.

[11:02] It'll probably take you two to four hours to do this every day.

[11:06] But objective number one when you're starting out is let people know you exist because

[11:10] no one does.

[11:11] So I asked my homies after getting them results.

[11:13] So I provided I first and I said, hey, man, I've got your before and afters.

[11:16] I need like a few more.

[11:17] Can you send me some friends that have seen your results?

[11:20] And a lot of them had people were telling them like dude, you lost 50 pounds.

[11:23] You look awesome.

[11:24] Like, hey, you look, you have a bikini now.

[11:26] Like you didn't even want to go outside without covering yourself up like this is great.

[11:29] And so I got probably another six to 10ish referrals from those first six and a totally

[11:35] different thing happened here.

[11:36] These people didn't know who I was.

[11:37] They just knew that I'd help their friend out.

[11:38] And these people cared way less about like helping me and cared way more about just helping

[11:43] them, which unsurprising fine.

[11:45] But the thing that happened was because it was free none of them really did anything.

[11:49] And so that became a problem.

[11:51] And so then I was like shoot that whole thing didn't work.

[11:54] So then I moved on to stage three, which was the free training project.

[12:00] And so that is the title that we owe this section to.

[12:02] And so what I did was I said, hey, now when you refer someone, just donate $500,000 to

[12:08] the charity of your choice.

[12:09] That way you self-skinned in the game, but it's still effectively free in that you're

[12:12] not paying me.

[12:13] And so I was then public about it, people were like, this is awesome.

[12:16] And then a lot of people came into support the fact that I was kind of doing this for charity.

[12:19] But long term, I wanted to find a way to turn this into something that I could make

[12:22] money from.

[12:23] And next phase of customers, this gave me everything that I needed to then transition to

[12:29] paid.

[12:30] And so from there, I went to the Skinny to Swole Project.

[12:34] Now publicly, this was a year later.

[12:36] And so this was where I asked new people to pay $200 a month for 12 weeks to go from

[12:42] Skinny to Swole.

[12:43] And I had all these great transformation pictures from my friends, from the people

[12:46] with the free training project to then do Skinny to Swole.

[12:49] And I was able to transfer and this is a key point.

[12:51] I was able to transfer people from the free training project into Skinny to Swole without

[12:55] really losing many of them.

[12:57] I just said, hey, now you paid for 12 weeks to this charity.

[13:00] One up paid me instead, whatever you paid them.

[13:03] And they were like, sure, I didn't really care because again, all these people, they

[13:06] came because their friends got results.

[13:08] They were like, this is weird that this guy's making me donate to a charity, but I guess

[13:10] it's fine.

[13:11] They just cared about getting in shape.

[13:12] But that was me overcoming my own fear of charging for making money.

[13:16] And so that is when I got to my first 20 clients in Skinny to Swole, which is me posting

[13:21] and then reaching out to everyone else I knew with all the testimonials from the first

[13:26] three stages to say, hey, I'm now officially launching this thing.

[13:30] And I got 20 guys to pay $200 a month.

[13:32] And that was my first $4,000 per month.

[13:35] And that was for 12 weeks.

[13:36] And that was my first 12 grand.

[13:38] Now, you might be like, wait, where's the, so what do I do if I'm you?

[13:42] Well, let me tell you what I would have done if I knew everything that I know now.

[13:47] So here's bonus number five, a little, little stars around it.

[13:50] But would I have done if I knew what I know now?

[13:57] Great.

[13:58] So that's what this section is.

[14:00] There are a lot of different businesses that you can potentially start.

[14:03] The reason that I think for beginners starting an online service business is the easiest

[14:08] one to start is because it costs the least amount of money.

[14:11] And it has a lot of good economics around it.

[14:14] Meaning it costs almost nothing to deliver.

[14:16] There's low recurring overhead.

[14:18] You can do it from any place in the world.

[14:19] If you're watching this video, you already have all the technology required.

[14:23] And so like basically everything is there for you to start.

[14:26] And you get to learn all of the mistakes that you're going to inevitably learn on a low-stake

[14:30] business first.

[14:31] Hey, and I want to write you a check real quick and not just any kind of check, but one

[14:35] that you can actually take to the bank.

[14:38] And this is about starting a school community.

[14:44] The reason that I decided to become a co-owner and made a massive investment in school

[14:47] the platform is because for four years I was looking for what is the easiest business

[14:52] online that I can help people get started because I have a massive amount of my audience

[14:56] are business owners that you do do one, five, ten, a hundred million plus a year.

[15:00] And that's who watches my stuff.

[15:01] And I have a lot of deeper content for really tactical stuff once you're at 20 employees,

[15:06] 15 employees, hundred employees, 250 employees.

[15:08] But if you're just starting out, then it's like, yeah, that stuff's amazing.

[15:11] But what do I do today?

[15:13] And so I want you to give you this check because this check is what the average school

[15:18] community that's paid and monetized on the platform makes in recurring revenue per month.

[15:23] And so no, this is not a bazillion dollar check.

[15:26] This is not going to get you to be the richest person in your neighborhood, but it can help

[15:29] get you started.

[15:30] And so the tactics that I outlined earlier about the Rule of 300 were doing this right

[15:34] now for people inside of school and it's murdering.

[15:38] And so I recommend that you start because the coolest part of this whole thing is that

[15:44] you can start absolutely free.

[15:46] And so if that sounds at all interesting, I take a call every single Monday.

[15:51] You can go there at school.com forward slash games.

[15:53] I'm sure there's some link somewhere.

[15:55] Just let me know that you're new.

[15:56] I hop on and answer questions.

[15:58] We walk through basically what we saw after studying thousands of communities that are

[16:04] paid and doing well.

[16:05] And we just try to reverse engineering, boil it down to like, what are the actions they

[16:08] took?

[16:09] And so the instructions are very much like, do this x times per day, do this y times per week.

[16:16] And if you just follow the instructions, you will get an exceptional result.

[16:20] And so to be clear, I stayed in this box for over a year.

[16:25] I just kept reaching out to people, asking for referrals because I didn't even know what

[16:29] the word advertising really meant.

[16:30] I was just like, I'm just going to tell people that I have this thing and hopefully

[16:33] they'll want to buy it for me.

[16:34] And after a year of doing stage one, talking to whom he staged to getting referral, stage

[16:38] three, doing the donation stuff, stage four, that is when I moved on to here.

[16:43] All right, which is that I actually made my first content post.

[16:45] And so I'll read it to you because I think there's a lot of actually decent parts to this

[16:50] post, especially like being my first advertising post ever without being in this internet

[16:53] marketing world.

[16:54] I was just a consultant to the Baltimore.

[16:56] Everyone for this, you know, me, you know, two things.

[16:57] One, terrible with all things, technological, not that much has changed.

[17:00] For example, I just are about Spotify a few weeks ago seriously and people at that point

[17:03] had it for a good decade already.

[17:04] Two, I love training, nutrition, and fitness more than a lot.

[17:08] So today's sort of special because it marks the day where my love of training, bank, which

[17:11] my fair technology, which by the way, many of you should hopefully get to that day sooner,

[17:14] which is that you should be willing to deal with some discomfort in order to get what

[17:18] you want.

[17:19] So the better part of the year, I've been taking part in a free personal training project,

[17:21] the idea that I would give away free personal training to anyone who is willing to give

[17:23] some of their $500,000 to cause their choice.

[17:26] This way, what they wouldn't have to be motivated at the same thing is me, but be motivated

[17:28] to give it their cause and benefit themselves when I first introduced the idea.

[17:31] I was happily surprised at the amount of positive what I received.

[17:33] So almost a year later, for my first client, I now have a website.

[17:35] All right, to formally show us the transformation that have gone under way using my programming

[17:38] and as a formal means of context, I'm about setting up.

[17:40] Basically, I'm open for business.

[17:42] All right, so I put it in caps.

[17:43] I'm currently have a few thoughts on my roster.

[17:45] So, drop me a note, quickly be interested.

[17:47] Thanks so much.

[17:48] Take out a second, see some of the ridiculous transformations in record time.

[17:50] Check it out.

[17:51] That was my post.

[17:52] That was the post that got me my first 20 or so customers.

[17:57] I had been posting fitness related stuff for almost a year, but then when I finally was like,

[18:02] hey, I'm open for business, that pretty much like not me the customers I needed.

[18:05] By the way, you can actually model this post to a great degree.

[18:10] The intro doesn't really matter, but the main thing was just kind of want to say, what

[18:13] do I mean?

[18:14] Because I probably could have cut the first part of that post and just say, for the last

[18:16] year, I've been doing this, which is just inherent proof.

[18:19] And I would like to make that same offer to you and here's more proof.

[18:23] So if I did a better, I would have probably just been like the images of the transformations

[18:26] because a lot of people are not going to make the click, so I want to increase the likelihood

[18:29] people click or respond.

[18:30] And so I probably made an image post or a carousel with that and then the CTA at the

[18:34] bottom saying DM me or comment or whatever.

[18:38] And at the end of the day, we all know that anybody who likes comments or DMs were going

[18:40] to respond to anyways.

[18:41] I would just try and get as much engagement on this post as I could.

[18:43] I would probably text the post and links to the post to everybody I knew as well because

[18:47] then that link would already have all the embedded proof.

[18:49] I noticed I didn't have an offer here.

[18:51] I probably would have put an offer in if I wanted to do what I would I know now.

[18:54] But this is a great place to start, which is proof.

[18:57] And some sort of CTA, if you put an offer in there, it would be better if you do some

[19:00] sort of bonuses in reverse of risk.

[19:01] You do even better.

[19:02] If you say it's for a certain period of time, it does even better.

[19:04] Only do that if it's true.

[19:05] If you're like brand new and you're like have no customers, then probably you'd be willing

[19:09] to take customers whenever or so.

[19:10] Maybe you don't say that at first.

[19:11] But I said I have a few slots up, which is true, but I also had a lot of slots up.

[19:15] I say this because I'm proud of that kid who decided to make that move.

[19:18] And I think for many of you, you can skip to this step much faster, especially if you fall

[19:21] the rule of 300, which is just rule of 100 broken down and three things.

[19:25] And you'll be able to get started a lot sooner than you think and you can do it for

[19:28] free.

[19:29] And it's a big context when this happens, like Instagram was barely a platform.

[19:33] It was like new and it was just like this image thing, like all of this influencer world

[19:36] like didn't really exist.

[19:38] And so the world's changed.

[19:39] It's never been easier than it is now.

[19:41] And in case you're wondering why I'm in this narrow hallway, believe it or not, this is

[19:44] the narrowest hallway in my 36,000 square foot headquarters.

[19:48] But this was supposed to be as close to as possible as the closet videos that I made at

[19:52] the very beginning of my YouTube journey, shout out to the OGs who have been there since

[19:57] those early days with a webcam.

[19:58] So I told you the beginning of this video that I'd be sharing the lessons that I learned

[20:02] along the way.

[20:03] So this isn't like how to start your first business.

[20:05] Obviously there's things you can model.

[20:06] But I think that the real things are what did this allow me to learn so that I could move

[20:11] forward in my journey as an entrepreneur?

[20:13] So the first one is walk the walk.

[20:16] And this kind of always seemed obvious to me and maybe it's because I was born in the real

[20:20] world and not the influencer or social media world.

[20:23] But like if you're fat, it's going to be hard for you to sell weight loss.

[20:27] If you have terrible teeth, it's going to be hard for you to sell dentist stuff.

[20:32] It's kind of what I called the big obvious that a lot of people just like choose to conveniently

[20:37] leave out.

[20:38] They're like, hey, people aren't buying my investing advice and it's like, yeah, because

[20:41] you're poor.

[20:42] So maybe you don't sell investing advice because obviously it hasn't worked.

[20:44] You want to be able to answer the obvious first objection before you even get it, which

[20:49] is you should be the biggest walking billboard of whatever it is that you sell.

[20:54] And I was able to succeed without nearly all the stuff that I know about offers now.

[20:58] And guarantees in reversing risk and scarcity and urgency and how do you create value?

[21:02] I just knew at least at the most basic level if I had gotten results for myself and gotten

[21:07] results for other people that people would believe that I could get results for them,

[21:11] at least on some level.

[21:12] So I'll also encapsulate that into proof over promise.

[21:16] It's good to have a promise and it's good to have proof.

[21:18] But if you had to pick one, go for proof.

[21:21] Now the next thing that I did in terms of what worked was I lived cheap.

[21:25] Now the reason that this is so important in my opinion is that it allows you to go on

[21:29] the offensive.

[21:30] Right?

[21:31] Like I lived on I think $12 a month at the time and I was making you consultants income

[21:35] and I basically spent no money and saved everything I had.

[21:39] And I had saved up over the first two years of consulting about 50 grand, which is not

[21:43] bad for two years of work like post taxes.

[21:45] I was pretty proud of it.

[21:46] And so with that money, I was able to then say, you know what?

[21:49] I have the I have the cash to quit my job and actually go all in on this thing.

[21:53] It still took me like six months to do it.

[21:55] Don't get me wrong.

[21:56] Like it was a painful process because I was so afraid.

[21:58] But at the end of the day, I had the money and I knew that I could live on 50 grand for

[22:01] at least two or three years if I had to.

[22:04] Saving money won't make you money, but it'll give you the security to think further

[22:07] out and take bigger risks.

[22:09] Because if I had to make money the next month, I would never have been able to quit

[22:13] my job.

[22:14] But I knew that I had two to three years of runway that I had bought myself through

[22:17] saving so that I could basically give myself more shots on goal.

[22:21] At this point, I was in consultant and made decent money.

[22:23] I was able to say 50 after taxes with that income.

[22:26] So like I was living pretty cheap.

[22:27] But the big thing that I did was I only bought food at Costco.

[22:31] I meal perhaps all of my food.

[22:32] I never ate out.

[22:33] I didn't go out, which some people might see a sad or whatever.

[22:36] I actually lived right above the bars of a college town and basically never went to any

[22:41] of them, which was like weirdly sad for me.

[22:43] But anyways.

[22:44] That was it.

[22:45] I never going to a gym and they said the membership was $29 a month and I was like

[22:49] a month.

[22:50] Like we got crazy.

[22:51] And so I went to a different place that was like 19 or 10.

[22:53] Just to show you like how I thought about money at the time.

[22:55] And so I just didn't spend money.

[22:57] Like I guess it was really it.

[22:58] It's like I bought food and I paid rent and that was it.

[23:02] It was all I did and I paid for gas in my car.

[23:04] I didn't buy new clothes.

[23:05] I just didn't spend money.

[23:06] That was all I was like I'd saved money by just not spending.

[23:08] That was it.

[23:09] And I was working all the time because I was either working at my job or the rest of my

[23:14] time I was working on my next thing.

[23:17] And so for me, the biggest hack of all for saving money is to work more because working

[23:22] more makes you money in two ways.

[23:24] One is you get paid for the work you do.

[23:26] Second, you don't have time to spend the money you make.

[23:28] So the next thing that worked was and this is a big one that a lot of people somehow

[23:32] like miss out on is start free.

[23:35] All right.

[23:36] So I did free honestly probably longer than I should have or needed to.

[23:40] But I was one.

[23:41] I didn't need to make the money yet.

[23:42] So I wanted to give myself a lot of prep a lot of runway.

[23:44] I kind of haven't changed.

[23:45] Like whenever I go into something new, like I want to be over prepared.

[23:48] I want to know I'm going to win if I'm going to do it.

[23:51] And so for me with the start for free, most of you guys aren't that good yet.

[23:54] And so the easiest way to get proof is start free so that you have proof so that you

[23:58] can show that you walk the walk in that you have helped other people walk that walk

[24:01] too.

[24:02] Here's the cool thing with free is that there are many things that someone can do to make

[24:05] you money.

[24:06] Only one of them is them giving you money.

[24:08] But if someone gives me a bang or testimonial, I will likely make more money.

[24:12] From that testimonial, then whatever they paid me.

[24:15] And so think about it.

[24:16] If I can guarantee that that will actually make me more money just over a longer period

[24:20] of time.

[24:21] And so basically in the beginning, you're stacking yourself with all of these things that

[24:24] are worth more than the price you could charge so that you can cash them in later for money.

[24:29] And so testimonials are worth more.

[24:31] Feedback is worth more.

[24:33] Referrals oftentimes can be worth more.

[24:35] And so all of these things are things that are non-monitary that someone can do to compensate

[24:39] you for the work that you did.

[24:42] And so it's not that I worked uncompensated.

[24:44] I just didn't ask for money.

[24:46] I've followed Chick-fil-A's philosophy with pricing.

[24:48] It's either full price or it's free.

[24:50] I never discount.

[24:51] For a number of reasons.

[24:52] But the biggest one being I don't negotiate with terrorists.

[24:54] And so the price is the price.

[24:55] They either paid or they don't.

[24:57] And I can make the decision as a business under that.

[24:58] Okay, strategically I'm not getting the tickets.

[25:00] I want.

[25:01] I will strategically lower the price.

[25:02] But to lower the price to get some going to buy, communicate to them and to every single

[25:04] person they tell that your prices are not true.

[25:07] That everything that you have is up for negotiation.

[25:10] And if you want the rest of your life to be a hagle by all means, discount people and

[25:13] make one off deals for everybody.

[25:15] But in my experience, I have a standard price that I have thought a lot about why I price

[25:19] at this price.

[25:20] And that is what it is worth to make.

[25:21] And if you would do it for less and you still make money, then do it for less.

[25:24] Don't do that.

[25:25] But if you want to, go for it.

[25:26] I would prefer to say either our trade is non-monitary.

[25:30] It's free and you will do these things.

[25:32] Or you will give me money and I will do all of these things for you and you don't have

[25:35] to do any of this stuff.

[25:36] And if you choose to, it would be great.

[25:38] But I'm not going to force you to.

[25:39] So one of the other things that worked is that I had a template in one to many solution.

[25:44] So I worked for that year to figure out what everyone liked eating.

[25:50] And so what I did was I remember spending like, I want to say like 200 hours, which was

[25:53] a huge amount of time for me at the time.

[25:56] On this monster excel sheet that I could type in someone's weight, their goal, etc.

[26:00] And then it would calculate out the macros and then the grocery lists for them for 100 different

[26:05] meals.

[26:06] And then I could do my consultation with someone and then I purposely would take longer

[26:10] and send it to like a week later.

[26:12] But it would take me like 10 minutes to prep it and make you know format and make it look

[26:15] nice and only select the meals that I thought they would like.

[26:18] So I had 100 meals like a pick from and then I would just pick the ones that I thought.

[26:21] They would be cool.

[26:22] They were like, wow, he really thought through the grams of every single one of these

[26:25] meals that they would add up to my total calorie intake with the macros, etc.

[26:28] And so it was very valuable but it didn't take me a lot of time.

[26:31] And so I think during this free period is where you invest in the future.

[26:35] You're investing the future to get referrals, reviews, feedback and build out the, okay,

[26:40] I keep having these same six questions.

[26:41] Okay, let me give out really, really like maybe I include that in the onboarding.

[26:45] Maybe I make I spend one time time now so that I never have to do it again.

[26:49] I solve it right so I don't have to solve it twice.

[26:51] I helped a couple girls lose a lot of weight.

[26:54] I helped a guy lose a lot of weight.

[26:56] I helped another guy lose a decent amount of weight.

[26:58] And then the rest of the guys were like recomp or getting jacked.

[27:01] Now, when I did my skinny to school project, which is where I finally monetized, I can't

[27:05] tell you why.

[27:06] But I can tell you that the thing that everyone responded to was people who looked like

[27:10] me and who wanted to look like me.

[27:12] And so I ended up niching without trying into skinny to swole because that's what I also

[27:18] wanted to work on.

[27:19] I preferred helping guys get jacked to helping girls lose weight.

[27:23] niching down can help just because your solutions become more templated.

[27:27] And so if everybody's going through the same goals and having the same starting position,

[27:31] you can provide in real way more value to them that also cost you less.

[27:34] And so it's a double hitter.

[27:36] It cost you less because everybody has it so you can template out a lot of it.

[27:39] It is more valuable to them because you're being way more specific to their problems with

[27:44] way more depth of solution than if you had to generically make or personalize it at a low

[27:50] price for many people, you wouldn't be able to put that much attention to it.

[27:53] It just you couldn't, right?

[27:54] Unless you charge a lot more, which I recommend.

[27:55] And so the next great thing that I stumbled into was that this was a recurring business

[28:01] model.

[28:02] So this was something that would pay me month after month after month.

[28:05] Now again, I didn't like think through this like, oh, what type of, I just was like, oh,

[28:08] we'll finish a lot of people need to pay me this month next month.

[28:11] And so I just made a recurring business model to start with.

[28:13] What I made a mistake for was that I sold 12 weeks and then I didn't sell them again.

[28:18] I went to go find other customers.

[28:20] And so I didn't like have another offer prepared or say, hey, you want to go and

[28:22] maintenance like I didn't do any of that.

[28:24] I was just like, cool.

[28:25] Now I have to go find another 20 customers.

[28:26] So that was down.

[28:28] But you love you learn.

[28:29] So that's all the stuff that I learned that worked well in me making my first

[28:34] dollars.

[28:35] So now we'll go over what didn't work.

[28:37] So the first thing that didn't work is I didn't ascend anyone.

[28:41] So I didn't have a second offer or some sort of way for them to continue to pay.

[28:46] So I would say number one have another offer.

[28:50] Now if you're like, shoot, I don't know what other offer I would offer them.

[28:54] Let me tell you what I should have done and that you probably should do.

[28:57] Just for them more of that thing they just bought.

[28:59] So if they just bought skinny to slow, guess what?

[29:01] They probably still want to be skinny and swollen.

[29:04] We're more swollen than they are.

[29:05] So I haven't met a guy who added 30 pounds to their bench and then was like, I'm good.

[29:09] They're like, I'll add another 30.

[29:11] I could go for more, right?

[29:12] You just make the offer and I just didn't do it.

[29:14] So don't make them a stick.

[29:15] The next thing in this is a big one.

[29:17] I stopped for new.

[29:20] So what does that even mean?

[29:21] So I had a business that was making $4,000 a month in profit online.

[29:26] No mad lifestyle, 2013 before the internet even fucking existed, not really.

[29:31] But before a lot of these online businesses became kind of like the Vogue or the norm,

[29:36] like there were basically no online coach.

[29:38] Like I just didn't exist.

[29:40] And so I thought that the business I had was not legit.

[29:44] And so I saw my online business, which took me four hours a week to do, that was making

[29:49] me $1,000 a week.

[29:51] As not legit, compared to me spending all this money, signing a five year lease, investing

[29:58] into a brick and mortar location to start a gym.

[30:00] And so I knew that I ultimately wanted to have a gym because I didn't know another way

[30:05] that was legit.

[30:06] So if I were coaching me right now, I'd have been like, wait, so you're making $1,000

[30:11] a week, working four hours a week.

[30:14] What if you work 40 hours a week and made $10,000 a week?

[30:19] That would be not that bad.

[30:21] And you immediately be in the top 1% of earning as a 20 something year old, working wherever

[30:26] you want with no, like, no cost.

[30:28] And why do you not want to do that?

[30:30] But instead, I was like, oh, now that this worked, I should stop doing that immediately

[30:34] and do something brand new that I've never done before.

[30:36] Don't do that.

[30:37] So the next thing that I did that was messed up is that I didn't have a good offer.

[30:41] So I had no offer, which was dumb.

[30:43] If I had had an offer, I would have been able to make way more money.

[30:45] The next one is that I had no sale.

[30:48] So when I did this, I actually didn't like hop on the phone.

[30:53] I just like literally just sent people links to buy, which was stupid.

[30:58] And I should have got on the phone because I would have then been able to charge more.

[31:03] I mean, I was basically offering personalized everything for $200 a month.

[31:08] And part of the reason that this is a guess I'm ridiculous to you if you're listening

[31:11] to this.

[31:12] Part of the reason that I probably didn't keep doing the thing, it wasn't making as much

[31:16] money as I wanted.

[31:17] So $4,000 a month, like I was like I just made that doing consulting up so I want to

[31:21] make more than that.

[31:22] And so even though my first shot immediately matched what I was making before, I didn't

[31:26] think, oh, I could just raise my prices to make more money.

[31:29] I was like, oh, no, I should just start a brand new business, like just dumb.

[31:32] But yeah, because I didn't have an offer because I didn't have a sale script for a sales

[31:35] process, I wasn't able to charge more, which then caused me to stop something that otherwise

[31:40] was an amazing business.

[31:41] I would say the other thing that I did that was dumb was that part of the reason that

[31:44] I stopped this other thing was judgment.

[31:46] And so I'll explain what I mean by this.

[31:48] But basically, you heard me say it, like I didn't think this was legit, right?

[31:52] Like this isn't a legit business.

[31:54] If you sell a product or service, if you exchange goods and services for money, you have

[31:59] a business.

[32:00] Period.

[32:01] So I didn't like to find terms and like a lot of that stuff came much later for me.

[32:04] But I made really huge life decisions based on perceived judgment of people who weren't even

[32:09] thinking about me.

[32:11] Like I honestly was obsessed about thinking about what my classmates thought about me

[32:15] at the time, the guys that I went to school with, you know, obsessed about what my dad

[32:19] would think, and all of this kept me poor.

[32:23] And so one of the biggest mistakes that I made is that there was no YouTube world that

[32:28] had all of these like courses and trainings and videos like this.

[32:32] So I didn't get how I did this also, which is why I think it took me a lot longer than

[32:37] it has taken a lot of people who follow my stuff.

[32:39] And I mean, honestly, that's the point.

[32:40] Like I hope that like every generation stands on the shoulders of the generation before.

[32:43] And I hope that people who are younger than me make more money than I have made by the

[32:46] time I'm 30 or they're 35, right?

[32:48] Otherwise it means that I have failed.

[32:50] Like I haven't been able to transfer the knowledge successfully because I'll die, no one will

[32:53] remember me, it won't matter.

[32:54] And so the only thing that really good that I think that people can do to leave a legacy

[32:57] is to pass on the learnings.

[32:58] And so that's why I try to do what I do.

[33:00] But I didn't get help until later.

[33:03] And when I got help is when my, you know, my income went way up.

[33:06] So I got asked to give advice to group of entrepreneurs who were doing this little test that

[33:11] I was telling you about on the school.

[33:12] And they said, hey, do you have any words of advice for everyone who's starting?

[33:17] And so I was in a writing mood at the time.

[33:21] And so I actually did an upsetting of this massive slack message that has now been seen by

[33:25] like 4 million people.

[33:26] And so I will share with you right now.

[33:28] These are the directions I told them when they were starting.

[33:30] Number one, follow instructions.

[33:32] Number two, when you reach something you don't understand how to do, Google first.

[33:36] The amount of people who like host immediately, the moment they have friction, the

[33:39] amount of people who message me and say, hey, where do I find your books?

[33:42] I usually just respond, where do you normally find books?

[33:44] And then they're like, well, Amazon, I'm like, did you search?

[33:47] People go for an easy button rather than just like take the second step.

[33:50] Take the second step.

[33:51] Do the one Google search before then thinking, oh, I will then stop working.

[33:55] Because that's basically what happens.

[33:56] As soon as you send a message, you say, I have reached a point that I cannot cross.

[33:59] I've reached a chasm, so which no man has ever been over before.

[34:03] Google it third, when you figure it out, post it.

[34:06] Other people may have struggled there too.

[34:07] And so this is a way that you add value in content to whatever community that you're in.

[34:12] Four, actually follow the rule of 100 daily.

[34:14] And this is a big one because people get distracted really, really easily and their inconsistent.

[34:18] And so the thing is that their business is becoming consistent because they are inconsistent.

[34:23] So businesses themselves are machines for consistency.

[34:26] If you have consistent inputs, you'll have consistent outputs.

[34:28] But if you have inconsistency in your business, it either means that you are not consistently

[34:31] putting the inputs in or you need to put more inputs in.

[34:34] So for example, if you do 10 reach out today, then you might get your one sale every

[34:37] 10 days.

[34:38] It will feel volatile, but it just means that 100 inputs equals one output.

[34:42] So if you want it to be less volatile, then it means that you put those 100 inputs per day

[34:45] and get one per day.

[34:47] And so really just means that you're extending the time horizon on the results that you

[34:49] want to get.

[34:50] So do more faster, more consistently, and you will get more faster, consistent results.

[34:54] Five, you will be excited for a week.

[34:56] Then the excitement will wear off.

[34:58] That is when the work begins.

[34:59] And so this is like a key point that has helped me a lot, which is work starts when excitement

[35:04] ends.

[35:05] Not while you're excited.

[35:06] Having counted as work while you're excited.

[35:08] The work starts when you have to confront the reality that you have way more stuff to

[35:11] do, that you don't know how to do.

[35:13] And that's not fun because you will suck because most people doing things they don't know

[35:16] how to do art good.

[35:17] But you being able to walk that bridge of discomfort is what will separate you from the mediocre

[35:22] masses who stop at the casement and then just say, I don't know what to do help me.

[35:27] Six, your work works on you more than you work on it.

[35:30] You are the product that's getting built more than your community.

[35:33] Remember this was for school people.

[35:35] So remember that.

[35:36] You were the product.

[35:37] And so I had this tweet that got completely bombed and known cared about it, but I will

[35:41] tell you what it was.

[35:42] So I have this really weird trippy thought the other day, which is in prisoner of war camps

[35:47] throughout history, one of the psychological torture mechanisms is that they would have

[35:50] people do manual labor.

[35:52] And one of the particularly nasty ones is that they would have them dig holes and then at

[35:54] the end of the day fill the whole spacck up.

[35:56] And so the point was to try and drive the futility and the meaningless of life, the meaningless

[36:00] of work and it just breaks them down psychologically.

[36:02] What I found interesting about that is that every day I go to the gym and I pick

[36:05] up weights and I put them exactly back where I was before.

[36:08] And so in both instances there is physical labor that's happening and everything looks

[36:12] exactly the way it was.

[36:13] But in one instances scene as psychological torture and the other it seems self-care.

[36:17] And so it really just means that these things occur and then we describe them as labels.

[36:21] And so if you are the asset that is getting built, everything happens for you rather than

[36:25] to you.

[36:26] 7.

[36:27] And this is a big one.

[36:28] Everything is unscalable in the beginning.

[36:30] That's the point.

[36:31] It's how you learn every single piece of it.

[36:34] And when you learn every single piece of how something works predictably, that's called

[36:39] mastery.

[36:40] That's how you learn a skill.

[36:41] When you learn lots of skills put together, people are like, wow, that guy's good at it.

[36:45] That is how you describe someone who is more skilled.

[36:47] And so the pain that you have to go through when you're reaching out to all of these

[36:52] colder prospects, not getting responses, what happens is you're like, man, there has to

[36:55] be a better way to do this.

[36:56] And then as soon as you do experiment and do figure out a better way to do it, you have

[37:01] gotten better.

[37:02] And so that pain creates the catalyst to learn better ways of doing the same stuff.

[37:10] And that's how in a very real way, you gain leverage.

[37:12] Skills give you leverage.

[37:14] If two people start the same thing and one gets way more results, that guy did it with more

[37:18] levers.

[37:19] They did it with more skill.

[37:20] And the pain is the catalyst to make it happen.

[37:22] So don't run away from the pain, run towards the pain, learn how to deal with it by getting

[37:27] better.

[37:28] 8.

[37:29] That's what you're doing.

[37:30] That's what you're doing.

[37:31] That's what you're doing.

[37:32] That's what you're doing.

[37:33] That's what you're doing.

[37:34] That's what you're doing.

[37:35] That's what you're doing.

[37:36] That's what you're doing.

[37:37] That's what you're doing.

[37:38] That's what you're doing.

[37:39] That's what you're doing.

[37:40] That's what you're doing.

[37:41] That's what you're doing.

[37:42] That's what you're doing.

[37:43] That's what you're doing.

[37:44] That's what you're doing.

[37:45] That's what you're doing.

[37:46] That's what you're doing.

[37:47] That's what you're doing.

[37:48] That's what you're doing.

[37:49] That's what you're doing.

[37:50] That's what you're doing.

[37:51] That's what you're doing.

[37:52] That's what you're doing.

[37:53] That's what they give approval, which in this sense is when you do, when you go for penny

[37:56] parties, approval doesn't come in, but you do get attention in affection, which is why some

[37:59] people like to be sick because people pay attention.

[38:01] They give them affection.

[38:02] That's how those cycles begin.

[38:05] I will give you a quote that pop up almost you gave me in my wee days.

[38:08] He said, it is better to be envied than pitted.

[38:11] When you complain, functionally, the command that you give your audience is pitting me.

[38:16] I don't know about you, but I didn't get in the game to get pitted.

[38:19] 10.

[38:20] Literally thousands of people have succeeded.

[38:22] You are not special.

[38:23] Repeat the same actions they took to get the same outcomes they got.

[38:27] And if you repeat the actions that they took and you do not get the same outcomes, they

[38:31] got.

[38:32] That means that there is a variable that you have not identified yet.

[38:34] It doesn't mean that it doesn't work.

[38:36] It means that the way you did it wasn't the complete way.

[38:39] And so if you build a bridge and there's 10 bricks across the bridge and you put nine

[38:42] in, you can't say building bridges doesn't work.

[38:45] You say, I don't know how to build bridges the way he builds bridges.

[38:48] I think he only did these nine steps, but it's clear that he is getting people across

[38:52] his bridge and I am not.

[38:53] So I have to further study what specific things he did that I do not do that is creating

[38:59] the discrepancy between his outcome and mine.

[39:02] 11.

[39:03] Write down every reason that you're going to stick with it.

[39:05] Put it in front of you.

[39:06] Tap it to your mirror, put it in behind your laptop, put it wherever you're going to

[39:09] do the repeated boring work.

[39:10] And revisit it when you need to remember to stick with it.

[39:14] Because motivational fade very quickly.

[39:16] And so having I love this term, a big bag of wise is a great way to remind you why

[39:21] you need to continue.

[39:22] What are you running away from just as much as what is what you're going towards?

[39:27] And in the beginning of this video, I said, use what you've got.

[39:29] If you're not super passionate about getting started, but you do know that you hate being

[39:33] broke, you hate your current situation, then write all the things you hate and say, this

[39:38] is why I'm doing this because I'm sick of this.

[39:40] I don't want this anymore.

[39:41] 12.

[39:42] Business is shockingly simple, but surprisingly hard.

[39:45] The hard comes in the form of consistency.

[39:47] The moment you don't want to do it or just skip today is the day that you realize

[39:51] what hard actually feels like.

[39:53] And that's where you have to overcome.

[39:55] The hard is not in the complexity.

[39:57] What makes it hard is being consistent.

[39:59] That's always like, fitness isn't hard, eat less than you burn, move more.

[40:02] Like that's it.

[40:03] Like, and add more of a time.

[40:04] Like it's not complex.

[40:05] It's just hard to do because you have to keep doing it.

[40:09] And you have to keep doing it far before you see your results, for the work you do.

[40:14] And so this is a practice in being able to further disconnect what you do and what you

[40:20] get.

[40:21] The weakest, most impudent people on earth are people that must be immediately rewarded for

[40:25] the work they do.

[40:27] It's how social media addicts the masses.

[40:29] They get rewarded immediately for hitting the button, for checking their notification,

[40:33] for looking at their likes, for looking at the comments.

[40:35] They get immediate rewards.

[40:36] And that is how they weaken you.

[40:38] The people who are the most potent are able to do big things because they know it takes

[40:42] a long time to do them and they will have to work today for something that will happen

[40:46] a year or five years down the road.

[40:48] Imagine a competitor that you'd compete against where one guy has to get a result for

[40:51] what he does in the moment or he stops.

[40:54] Imagine the other competitor who's able to do it for a year straight without seeing

[40:58] a result.

[40:59] Who do you think will win?

[41:01] Obviously the one who waits a year.

[41:03] Be that competitor.

[41:04] Number 13, just win.

[41:06] Because once you win, one you'll get addicted to winning.

[41:08] Second, everything else that you did to get to there will fade.

[41:11] And so I'll tell you a weird analogy.

[41:13] If you've ever drank too much and had to throw up and had a whole night of throwing

[41:17] up, when you think back on it, you don't actually remember all the hours of throwing up.

[41:22] You just remember it kind of sucked a little bit.

[41:25] And the thing is, is that pain fades in time.

[41:29] That's something that is behavioral not just a human.

[41:32] It's across species.

[41:33] So punishment fades.

[41:35] And so the reason that you get hung over and the next day you say, I'm never drinking again,

[41:38] but the next weekend you go out with your buddies and trick again is because you're

[41:41] the benefit of drinking, stays.

[41:44] And so the reason that you have a past relationship and you're like, man, I remember the

[41:47] good old days is because the punishment from that relationship fades.

[41:51] It's why people keep revisiting these toxic relationships.

[41:53] They go back and they soon get back into your, like, why did I do this?

[41:55] I forgot about all this stuff.

[41:57] And so the pain that you were going through right now will fade.

[42:01] But the result that you get will stay with you.

[42:04] And so that disparity between pain and reward for me has been one of the biggest unlocks

[42:09] of life, just simply understanding that this pain will pass.

[42:12] But what I get for it will stay with me and achievement stays with you for life.

[42:16] What it took you to get there only stays with you in your mind as long as you choose to give

[42:20] it attention.

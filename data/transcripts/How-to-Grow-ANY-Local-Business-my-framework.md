## Full Transcript
[00:00] had two different businesses that approached me,

[00:01] both had franchises open.

[00:03] I had almost an identical conversation with both

[00:05] and I'll tell you one of them, which is a lightning,

[00:07] a teeth lightning business.

[00:08] But a breakdown is how I help them walk through this decision

[00:11] of should we go more franchises

[00:12] where should you go more privately owned?

[00:14] And it really comes down to four main variables.

[00:16] Number one is the cost versus the return

[00:19] of every dollar you invest in, obie moral occasions.

[00:21] The second is the actual effort

[00:23] that it takes to open a location,

[00:24] which comes down to is it centralized

[00:26] or decentralized in terms of where the work is being done.

[00:29] It's centralized and it means that there's

[00:31] more operational drag at the franchise or level.

[00:34] If it's decentralized, there's more work for the franchisee.

[00:36] The third thing was actually looking at this at scale.

[00:39] If you have a number you saw for which I was

[00:40] every entrepreneur that I know who is in a local chain,

[00:43] wants to saw for some big exit.

[00:45] Usually it's 50 or 100 million.

[00:46] And if you want to own a forever totally fine,

[00:48] you still think about building it as an asset,

[00:50] even if you're never going to sell it,

[00:51] which is transparently like we don't want to sell anything anymore.

[00:53] We want to hold and grow a buy-and-build, maybe that's what we do.

[00:56] But we also understand that so much of where

[00:57] you want to sell and reversing your net worth goal

[01:00] into what you actually have to open at a location level

[01:03] between franchise and local privately owned ones

[01:06] that you own all of them is a good math number to know

[01:08] because it makes the decision much much easier.

[01:10] And then finally, it's a little bit of a personal thing,

[01:13] which is which type of entrepreneur are you?

[01:14] Are you more of a emotional entrepreneur?

[01:16] So you love the sales of the marketing

[01:17] and selling the franchisees and selling the franchisees?

[01:19] Or are you more of a product driven,

[01:22] operational leadership driven entrepreneur

[01:23] who's like who with a longer time-rishing

[01:25] just loves investing in people

[01:26] and building kind of a big set?

[01:27] So we'll break down all four of these.

[01:28] Here are the business metrics that are important.

[01:30] Top line for location is about 500,000 years.

[01:33] Bottom line for location is 250,000 years.

[01:35] The cost to open is 50.

[01:37] So I spend 50, I make 500 top line, I keep 250 a year later.

[01:41] Really good numbers.

[01:42] If you have a business that gets less than 100% return on capital

[01:45] meaning it usually makes more sense to franchise right off the bat.

[01:48] Because the return on capital is too slow and not big enough,

[01:52] you look at a McDonald's for example.

[01:54] We cost 1.1 $1.2 million dollars to open McDonald's.

[01:57] They make 150,000 year on average capital.

[02:00] So you're looking at like a 15% rate of return.

[02:03] Versus spend 50, make 250, you're talking five X.

[02:07] Very different.

[02:07] And this happens all the time.

[02:08] I've seen this with moving businesses that

[02:10] have crazy returns on capital.

[02:11] See with the gym business, doesn't really matter

[02:13] with the businesses.

[02:13] But you have to switch from your business hat

[02:16] to your investor hat and start looking at your business

[02:18] investment.

[02:19] Because once you start generating real money,

[02:20] you have to think where is the best place I can put my money.

[02:23] And if opening another location five X is your money every year,

[02:26] you go from 1 million to five million five to 25 to 25 to 125 to 125,

[02:30] that becomes a very attractive machine

[02:31] if you expand the time horizon.

[02:33] We have this business.

[02:34] These individuals had decided to do the franchise.

[02:36] So this is what their franchise economics looked like.

[02:38] They would get seven and a half percent of top line

[02:41] with the royalty on top line and it's usually some sort

[02:43] of marketing fund that everyone chips into so you can get

[02:45] national branding.

[02:46] Some franchises do flat fees, some do royalties,

[02:49] doesn't really matter.

[02:49] There's a certain percentage revenue that you're going to collect.

[02:51] Now these guys are charging seven and a half.

[02:54] And so on 250, it was like $35,000 per year

[02:57] that they're making from the franchise.

[02:59] Okay?

[03:00] Stay with me.

[03:00] Now, if the franchise runs at the same margins

[03:03] at the individual locations at 50%.

[03:05] So $20,000 of what they're going to make in net earnings

[03:09] at the franchise or level per location that they open.

[03:12] Here's the kicker.

[03:13] And this moves us onto our second kind of variable here.

[03:16] You move past the first checkpoint.

[03:18] And you're like, okay, our economics are pretty good.

[03:20] We're over 100% we're in that line.

[03:22] But now it's like, well, how hard is it?

[03:24] If you have $20,000 in net earnings per franchise,

[03:27] you open, you've got 250,000 per location

[03:30] that you open on your own, the franchise is

[03:32] get usually two times the multiple that a brick and mortar

[03:35] local chain will get.

[03:36] So they might get like 15 times earnings in terms of the

[03:39] enterprise value, what uninvestor might buy for it.

[03:42] Because franchise is usually have a certain amount of open

[03:45] and usually more have yet to be of.

[03:46] And so an investor is willing to pay 15 times today

[03:50] because they already really know their pay

[03:52] if nothing else changes a five X multiple

[03:54] because they know the other 200 are going to open.

[03:56] guaranteed it's legal, passed out versus getting 8X

[04:00] on the individual locations.

[04:02] 8X on $250 be $2 million versus 15X on 20,

[04:06] which would be 300,000,

[04:08] which means that for every location you open at the franchise

[04:10] level, you add $300,000 to the franchise valuation.

[04:14] For every location you open on the privately held side,

[04:17] you would add $2 million.

[04:18] So that then informs how hard is it to open these locations?

[04:22] What is the constraint?

[04:23] If we have a super decentralized model,

[04:25] meaning the franchise is most of the work,

[04:27] then it might mean that we could open 10 times more

[04:29] franchises for the same effort as opening one.

[04:32] At that point, it might make more sense to open

[04:34] more franchise locations.

[04:36] It's super centralized as in you're doing most of the work.

[04:38] Then sometimes it makes a lot more sense to actually just

[04:40] keep opening locations in your own provided.

[04:42] The return on capital is there.

[04:43] You don't need to open spend a million dollars of

[04:45] one of the facility to make 200 grand.

[04:47] And the numbers pencil out where you just look dollars in cents.

[04:51] If I want to have a hundred million dollar exit,

[04:53] which you can't have an exit or not,

[04:55] but you can still always build as though a receivable entity.

[04:57] We will always build an asset so that it is sellable,

[04:59] not so that we sell it.

[05:01] So a hundred million means 50 locations open privately,

[05:04] or 333 locations open with a franchise.

[05:07] And so you have to look at that and think,

[05:09] okay, if I can open, let's say one or two locations a month,

[05:12] which most franchise locations do,

[05:13] then it would only take me like two maybe three years to get to this number.

[05:16] Now, what's my rate of opening at the franchise level?

[05:19] Often times, especially with when I talk to franchise stores,

[05:22] they're usually limiting factors internal, not external.

[05:25] The problem is internal,

[05:26] that it means maybe they can open like rear four locations

[05:29] for the franchise,

[05:31] which means it would actually take them longer

[05:33] to get their ultimate outcome.

[05:34] And that's assuming they can sell franchisees like hotcakes,

[05:36] which is not always that easy.

[05:38] That leads to the fourth point on this checklist that I walked through

[05:40] mentally, the final thing is just personality wise.

[05:43] So if I look at an entrepreneur and they're super pro-ocean driven,

[05:45] they love selling, they love the sizzle,

[05:47] they love the hunt, right?

[05:48] Of selling franchises, then franchising,

[05:50] when I'm at 50, 50, might still be the right place.

[05:53] On the flip side, if there's somebody who's a little bit more product driven,

[05:55] a little more leadership driven, like love the ops,

[05:57] all that kind of stuff, then it might be more a self-sustained,

[05:59] lower number, higher value play.

[06:01] And here's the key difference.

[06:03] If you have a really stark difference between franchises versus private,

[06:07] let's say a super promotion driven entrepreneur,

[06:09] but all the matches that you should own it privately.

[06:11] Then if you phrase the thing that you don't like as a deficiency in the business,

[06:14] then it becomes very solvable.

[06:16] So for example, staffing into these locations becomes hard.

[06:19] You've got all these kind of blow skill, low wage employees,

[06:21] which can be difficult to manage lots of churn, et cetera.

[06:23] So what do you do?

[06:24] You hire somebody who's ran a staffing for a franchise that's

[06:27] gone from 50 to 250 multiple times.

[06:29] That's what I would do when we invest, it's exactly what the move would be.

[06:32] We can take somebody who's super-proclaimed driven,

[06:34] and then bring in one or two people to support them in the things that they

[06:37] don't like that are way better than them at it.

[06:39] And then you get the outcome where the math and the personalities work together

[06:43] to build the ultimate enterprise rise.

[06:45] And on the flip side, if you're super like ops product,

[06:47] et cetera, type entrepreneur,

[06:48] but all the metrics say that you should franchise this thing,

[06:51] then we bring a really high-be sales driven person into the business to go hunt

[06:56] for you to bring more franchises in so that you can scale faster,

[06:59] because that's the way that your model is going to set up.

[07:01] Either way, these are variables that you can play with.

[07:04] And those are the four points that I look at as checklist of how I'm in a skill,

[07:07] local business that comes dust.

[07:08] We made a checklist so that you can actually look through these four things for yourself.

[07:12] Actually go through it and fill it out and look at those things,

[07:15] because you'll actually look at it as an investor and it'll make you a better business owner.

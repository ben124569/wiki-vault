## Full Transcript
[00:00] I was asked to speak at the War Room Mastermind, which is a $30,000-year mastermind.

[00:04] I think it's a two-three-hundred-person program run by Ryan Dice, Perry Belcher, and Roland Frazier.

[00:08] And it's a great program.

[00:09] And I was asked to speak on sales.

[00:11] I have given versions of this sales presentation a handful of times, but this is the best one that I think captured.

[00:16] The audio and the visual and everything kind of put together, and it's condensed into a 30-minute video.

[00:21] So I think you guys will absolutely enjoy this.

[00:22] So if you're building your first sales script,

[00:24] if you're scaling a sales team, and you want to make sure that you can onward new people

[00:28] and get them selling at the same percentage, or better than you are right now, which for many people,

[00:32] is the biggest bottleneck, especially when you're coming to for your first million or first three million per year.

[00:36] Scaling the sales team is one of the most difficult tasks.

[00:38] And so I've broken this down into three frameworks that I've used very successfully scaled lots of different sales teams.

[00:43] I say that the company I'm referencing in this video has 14.

[00:47] That one company already now has almost 30 sales guys, so this process continued to work past when I made this presentation.

[00:53] So if you're trying to scale sales, you want to close higher percentage, you want to get more guys closing.

[00:58] At that same percentage, or better than yours.

[01:00] And if you don't know who I am, my name is Oxramozionacquisitor.com.

[01:02] We're going to portfolio at this moment of six companies to do $85 million a year,

[01:05] keep being awesome. Love you and enjoy the video.

[01:08] What I'm going to be breaking down today is the scripting process that we've applied for calls, right?

[01:14] And so as the world's worst market, I saw my first email this year, I was very excited about it.

[01:18] We've been business for 10 years.

[01:20] Pretty big stuff, and it was because I couldn't get webinars. I couldn't get VSLs. I couldn't get all the fancy stuff

[01:26] that you guys get to work. And so I went back in time and just was like, if I can just get them to give my phone number,

[01:31] I'll be able to get them to buy shit for me. And so I went and called back all these webinar leads that never showed up or never bought or

[01:37] whatever, and then I ended up doing like 100,000 in sales in a day. And I was like, wow, this is so much easier.

[01:43] And so over time, I've consulted with sales teams. I've trained in own four,

[01:49] height ticket, performance teams. I think we have 12 or 14 sales guys now at kind of rotates.

[01:55] And so what I want to do is kind of show you what we've done to consistently replicate the skill of sales in another human being.

[02:00] With that be cool. All right. So if I can be add like 10% to your conversion rate in terms of how you

[02:06] attracts better closers, how you script the process out, and how you should close more deals and scale them till

[02:10] incentivize them with that be valuable for you guys. All right, sweet. So these are the three frameworks

[02:15] that transform losing funnels and cash machines. That was my real life. That was the picture of my actual first funnel.

[02:21] And that's what it became. And so these are the three fails, the frameworks. Number one,

[02:25] closer framework. How to ask questions they got prospects to say yes, adding this to a funnel is

[02:29] simply can make it profitable. This is my personal experience. Number two is conviction framework.

[02:34] All right. How anyone who believes can outperform a seasoned sales rep by simply learning control their tone.

[02:39] Really important. This is one of the biggest things that most salespeople miss.

[02:43] Number three, the scaling framework. How to easily duplicate this process across salespeople in

[02:47] any niche in seven days or less. So seven days from now, we can do this. So that'd be cool. All right.

[02:52] Let's rock. So number one, the closer framework. After going through hundreds of scripts of

[02:58] bug grants, stuff of art, the wolf raw street stuff, I bought all that stuff and going through my own sales

[03:02] process as I learned that the scripting process even was simpler I think than it's portrayed. It's not

[03:07] that it's something to be sold against, but every salescript that has been absolutely gangbusters

[03:13] has been a question-based framework that is based on this process. All right. And this works for

[03:18] beta C sales, it works for beta C sales, beta B sales, it works for $500 tickets, it works for $100,000

[03:23] tickets, the process is the same. And so this is the acronym, closer framework. As I said,

[03:27] worlds dumb as marketers, so I made it nice and easy to remember. All right. So C, clarify why

[03:32] they are there. When I look at creating a script, the first thing we asked is like, why the hell

[03:36] are you here? What made you reach out to us today? What was the thing? What is the goal you're

[03:40] trying to accomplish? Two, label them with a problem. We can't cure cancer unless they admit that they

[03:46] have it. Is anyone had that situation? I just want to find out more information. You know, we're

[03:50] had that? Right. Well, it's like, well, Maseul and you're not hopping on sales calls, are they just

[03:54] trying to find information? Is there a problem you're trying to solve? Oh, you're fat. Got it.

[03:58] All right. Boom. So you're that's a problem. We can solve it. After that, I'm assuming I'm not the

[04:03] first guy you've ever dated. Right. So is there anything else that you've had happened in the past that

[04:07] got you here that didn't work? I'd love to know more about it. S, once we've gone through the pain,

[04:11] we saw them the vacation. Right. There's a process that I'll walk through. We explain away their concerns

[04:15] because obviously, saying people don't make decisions on the first call, unless you're closer,

[04:20] in which case they do, which I'll talk about. And then finally, and this is something that we actually

[04:24] added in my original framework for my first couple of years was close. And then we added the R,

[04:29] because when you do this, it actually transitions into the onboarding process that will get higher

[04:34] LTV per customer, lower-turn, lower-refunds, or charge-backs, which are sales guys, and you will be happy about.

[04:40] Go on. All right. Let's rock. So we'll examine each one more closely.

[04:44] clarify why they're there. These are the questions that sounds like, what made you come in today?

[04:48] What made you reach out? What's your goal right now? Why is that important? Why that number

[04:51] specifically? What does it? What is it resony for you? Why is that real? L, the questions that we're

[04:57] looking at is, okay, so what I'm hearing is XYZ usual, is that sound about right? Really simple,

[05:02] but very important to mouse on the has to be hit in the process. Then we overview. This is where

[05:08] we're gathering all the insult. And for some of you guys, my goal is that you can take this to your

[05:12] sales team, your sales director, and run your script through this framework, and then see where you can

[05:16] plug in. You probably have some of it. But if you're missing one or two of these questions,

[05:20] the mouse notes, you're losing conversions on the call. Like your closing people who already had

[05:24] those obstacles covered, but everyone who didn't have two of these questions covered,

[05:29] you lose them. And you don't know why, and you watch the sales going, you're like, what that will

[05:32] happen here, right? So what if you tried to afford to accomplish that? How this is what we call

[05:37] the pain cycle? It's a forced-ed process. What if you tried to afford to accomplish this? How long did

[05:41] you do that for? How long ago? How did that work for you? What else have you tried? Right?

[05:46] So we just do that cycle until they're like, oh yeah, that's it. Now that you think about it,

[05:50] I've tried everything under the sun. Like, I can't imagine what that's felt like.

[05:54] Wow. Right? It's not your fault. You're so close. You're six inches away, right? And I think

[06:01] you've just had this one thing which amounts to showing a second. We could be able to help you.

[06:04] You want to hear about the program? Fantastic. That's when we transitioned to the sale, right?

[06:08] So, some of the vacation. The number one thing that people mess up, our sales pitch on the call

[06:13] is under three minutes. Three minutes. 180 seconds. When we talked about, I think someone was asking

[06:20] about, what are the bullets on the page? We don't say anything about that. Because what we're trying

[06:26] to do is get them to understand what they're going to experience, not how they're going to experience

[06:30] it. Right? And so when we have a sales pitch just about every time, we sell three things. Right?

[06:36] And it doesn't matter what industry and I was training a mortgage lead team and they were selling

[06:39] leads. Right? And it was like the leads are exclusive. They're timely and they're qualified.

[06:44] Right? And so we talked about, hey, if you've had leads in the past, I will the Zillow leads.

[06:49] My real estate people. Right? The Zillow leads are not, they are timely, but they're definitely

[06:53] not exclusive. These are people who just window shopping. Right? Our leads are different. Three things.

[06:57] You can always find them. You're someone fitness. You're someone fitness, you're nutrition accountability.

[07:02] Right? And so what we do is when we say the three bullets, get them to understand, yes, that takes five

[07:08] seconds. Cool. Fitness wise. We get the commitment. This is what I need you to do. Fair enough.

[07:11] It's going to be like, I need you to work out three days a week. Can you do that? Awesome. If we see

[07:15] any hesitation, you have a 30 second story that's memorized. Most of the script and this is what

[07:20] makes it scalable is a question based framework, which means if you get lost, you can find your way

[07:25] back again. If anybody here have scripts that are like paragraphs and stuff, anyone? Okay. Like no,

[07:31] no one has a script that's paragraphs and pages. Please. We all know. But if you have those things,

[07:39] it'll totally mess it up because the sales guy gets lost and then he's just freeballing and he has

[07:43] no idea where he is. Hot dog and a hallway. No idea what's going on. Right? And so the point is here,

[07:48] a little visual. Anyways, is that we were telling the story like with the fitness exemplar.

[07:53] So, hey, when you've filled in the past, like right now, do you have a favorite TV show?

[07:58] Game of Thrones? That's awesome. Do you feel like like you got to get motivated and watch

[08:02] Game of Thrones? You're like, oh man, I've been wanting to watch it, but I just can't get up the motivation

[08:06] to watch TV. They're like, well, no, I don't have that. It's like right. And so that's exactly how we're

[08:12] going to make your fitness program. So if you look forward to, you don't need the motivation,

[08:15] the willpower because that's what you've filled in the past. They're like, oh, I didn't talk about

[08:21] the workouts, the part rate and the calories they're going to burn and they're going to sweat

[08:25] because all that shit sounds like work. Right? What they do get is exactly what they want,

[08:30] which is, wait, so you're telling me that if I actually like something, I'm not going to have to

[08:35] try and it's going to feel like watching TV because I look forward to it. It's exactly what I'm saying.

[08:39] And if you can deliver, you make tons of money. And that's the point. So each of those points,

[08:43] your sales guy should know what that anecdotal story is. Right? If I was selling accountability,

[08:50] anywhere in your kids, anywhere in your childhood, anywhere in your childhood,

[08:53] kids of brush your teeth. And we have their kids of brush your teeth say, they don't want to brush their teeth.

[08:58] Anyone tell their kids, even they don't want to brush their teeth to brush their teeth anyways.

[09:02] And now you're an adult, did you pay attention to that to you? Do you brush your teeth?

[09:07] That's an example of external accountability turning into an internal habit. It's exactly

[09:11] with the accountability we're going to do in this program industry. So make sense? Great.

[09:14] Done. Next bullet. That's how you transition the pitch. Right? So if you think about this process,

[09:20] why are you here? I have cancer. I think we might be able to help you out, but I don't want

[09:23] to get into that because I don't know about you. Like I don't know what your situation is. Tell me

[09:25] which you've done. That sounds great. That makes sense. Okay. I think we might be able to

[09:32] help again. See a little bit about that. All it is that tell three stories. They make complete

[09:36] sense to everything you just told me. And then we transition. And so I pretty much just covered this.

[09:43] But we call it selling the vacation on the plane flight. Right? And so we're not selling TSA.

[09:47] We're not selling your mod. You're going to put your macros. You work out your sport team.

[09:49] You're URLs. You are whatever. Right? We're selling Maui. We're selling the final destination.

[09:54] And it doesn't matter what level of service you are selling. You always selling the same thing.

[09:58] It's always Maui. It's just how do you want to get there? Do you want to swim the Maui?

[10:02] Right? Do you want to take a boat to Maui? Do you want to take a normal flight?

[10:06] Or do you want to take a private jet to Maui? Right? So you're called. You're going to Maui either way

[10:09] because we're a man of our word. And I'm not going to sell you something that's not going to deliver.

[10:12] Right? But it's going to be a little different. A little rockier, but we're going to get you there.

[10:16] So everyone gets to Maui. The variables are the speed and the quality of the journey.

[10:20] The likelihood of arrival is assumed. So since it's always the same thing,

[10:24] you probably have multiple levels of business. But it's always the same process. Right?

[10:29] And so once we have that, they're like, got it. And then we just make the ask.

[10:33] Right? From this point going forward, it's explaining where there are concerns like any human being would normally do.

[10:38] I could drill price over comes with you. But I think it's more valuable to explain the thought process behind

[10:43] price, stall, and decision maker objections. All right. So the first and obvious one is,

[10:49] I can't afford it. Anyone get this one? Right? Go with people. Two people have gotten this.

[10:54] You guys have the best leads. Give me your leads. And so the easy question that I use to explain to our

[11:01] sales team because it's really about breaking their leaves. Beliefs is, if we were given away for

[11:05] R worries right now, for five grand, do you think they'd find a way to get the money? Yes.

[11:12] So that's simply, they do not understand the value we're trying to provide. And if you can get your team to

[11:16] believe that, then they understand that it is always their fault if someone cannot afford the program.

[11:21] Does that make sense? Fantastic. Second, decision maker clothes. One of the hardest things to

[11:28] overcome, right? I got to have my business partner. I got to have my husband, my spouse, my whatever.

[11:34] So we give a specific process that we go about this. And so what we do is in the very beginning, we just say,

[11:40] we circumvent, then we go over past agreements, and then we ask for forgiveness. All right, this is the best way

[11:45] way that I've seen to overcome this. So the first thing we say is, well, what if they say no?

[11:49] One out of three times will be like, I probably do it anyways. We're like, let's get started. Boom, it's done.

[11:54] You'd be amazed how many times that actually works. It's hilarious. If they say, well, then I wouldn't do it.

[11:58] Then we divert, we say, well, what do you think their biggest objection would be about it?

[12:04] Because now they're just using a foil. Even the person's not there in this, then I do with the

[12:06] program is because they're not involved with the call, right? They're like, well, I think this, and at this

[12:10] point we can attack the actual obstacle, even though the decision maker isn't there. Now if they still,

[12:14] if we still can't overcome it, then we go to past agreements. We say, well, does your business partner

[12:18] know that you guys are struggling on sales? Oh, yeah. Does he approve of that? Well, no,

[12:24] then why would he be against something that he already doesn't approve of? That doesn't make any

[12:28] sense. Why would he be against a business partner solving a problem? Then what you do? Let's

[12:31] great. You're being a great partner. Let's go. Right? And so we try and rely on past agreements that are

[12:36] obvious and use those to project into the present. Right? And then finally, you know, sometimes

[12:41] it's a better answer for forgiveness and permission, right? And so we'll attack that on Dan. You can

[12:46] put that at the end of any of the closes. And so when we're dealing with this with price,

[12:51] it's value. With decision maker, we go on past agreements. And with stalls, we just teach

[12:57] people to make decisions. People just so afraid of making the wrong decision, they're petrified.

[13:03] And so we do is we literally teach them on the call. Here's how you make a decision. These are

[13:07] the variables you should be considering. X, Y, and Z, right? Can the product meet your needs? Do you

[13:12] think that if you work with us, you have a greater or lower likelihood of losing weight?

[13:17] Greater. Fantastic. I think we're halfway there. Do you want to work with us? Do you think

[13:21] it could be fun to hang out and see me, everybody? Because believe me, this dash, I had to work

[13:25] 12 months to get my wife to say yes to that. So I understand if you're hesitant. Does that make sense?

[13:29] Would you be willing to do that? All right, let's rock. Right? And then do you have access to funds

[13:34] or no someone who does? Right? Because it's not just about you because if it's something that's amazing,

[13:37] we can find other ways to finance this. So do you have access or no someone who does? Yes.

[13:43] Well then great. Let's get started. And if for some reason, we haven't closed them at this point.

[13:48] We say how about this. Let's take a card down. We'll delay the payment to Friday. You go to your

[13:53] husband. You go to your business partner. You go to your husband. Right? And he says,

[13:58] baby, I want you to live a shorter life. I want you to. I want you to be a terrible example of

[14:03] our kids. I want you to not have generational health in our family to be passed down. I want you

[14:08] to sit in that corner. I want you to pull those sweat pants up. Take up a bag of cheetos.

[14:12] Run up your fingers on there. Right? And just get comfortable with the fact that you're never

[14:15] going to look better than you are right now. I said, if your husband says that to you, you call me back.

[14:19] And I will tear this contract up. Fair enough. Right? And you close them. Right? So explain

[14:24] where they're concerns. And then finally, we get the yes. We reinforce the decision. This is

[14:29] stuff that we started doing and it helped a lot. So personalized video from the CEO, hey, welcome

[14:33] aboard. So happy to have you. Thank you for trusting us with your business. Hey, we're so happy to

[14:37] have you thinking for trusting with your weight loss. During your new year in our personal instances,

[14:40] we want to do everything in our power to absolutely amaze you. Right? Little things like that,

[14:43] because the customer is usually deciding whether or not they like your business in the first 48

[14:47] hours after the sale. I'll learn this later. So how you hand off from sale to customer experience

[14:53] and activation is where this all happens. Does that make sense? Is that cool? Was that nice?

[14:58] Is that framework to work through? Okay. So that's the disclosure framework. That is the first

[15:03] thing that's where you can run your script through. All right. How to ask the questions to get the

[15:06] prospects to say yes. Check. One down. Two to go. You with me? You're still good? All right. Let's rock.

[15:13] So conviction framework number two, how anyone who believes can outperform a season sales rep

[15:18] by simply learning to control their tone. All right. So after I reworked all of our scripts,

[15:24] using the closer framework, some of my guys were really successful, but other ones still blew.

[15:30] And I was like, well, this sucks. Right? I was really excited. I had a little acronym in everything.

[15:35] I was like, that's like, it's like me a long time to come with acronym. Right? And I was like,

[15:39] what gives? And so I'll talk to my friends. And they recommended this book, which was awesome.

[15:45] And the biggest takeaway from this book is the concept of tone. And this was something that

[15:50] really helped take us and give an extra edge for our sales training ourselves process and the coaching

[15:55] that we give people. Right? And so in the book you talked about the hidden dialogue, which I just love.

[16:00] And I just never want to take credit for an idea because I got to remember. But there's two dialogues

[16:04] that are happening. Right? Because the words are the logic. Right? What you're actually saying is talking

[16:10] to the logical brain. How you say it is talking to the emotional brain. Right? And that's the one's

[16:15] making a decision. That's the one running the shot. All right? And so how you say what you say is what you say.

[16:24] So here's an example. That's my wife. She's going to be here with me soon. But if she were here,

[16:30] if she said Alex, right? Or Alex, right? Or Alex, very different manics, very different afternoon

[16:40] for me. In each of these scenarios, right? Based on how she said it because there's so much

[16:46] communicated. And that's just one word. Imagine a 30-minute dialogue where each word can be chosen

[16:53] to have packed with the meaning that you need them to feel. Does that make sense? Okay. So we need

[17:00] the words for the logical influence. We need the tone for the emotional influence. We need both.

[17:05] And so once you become a more seasoned like sales prep, you can learn to control your

[17:08] tonal purpose. Right? You can raise your voice at the end of the statement to make it into a question.

[17:13] Right? It's a question. This is John. Right? I didn't need to ask him. I'm saying

[17:21] you know to answer that as a question. I didn't ask you that. But you know that based on the tone.

[17:26] We're going to lower my voice right now, I see what I'm saying. Extremely important.

[17:31] Right? Tone matters. And so it takes time to develop this level of unconscious mastery. So there's two ways

[17:37] to develop this. And I believe that you can either trick yourself into it or you can train yourself into it.

[17:43] And since I don't have enough time in 30 minutes to train on the influence of tonalities,

[17:48] here's the trick. Is that all right? I'll give you the hack.

[17:50] Conviction will correct your tonal. If you believe in what yourself, you will say it the right way.

[17:58] And that's why some of you guys have the sales rep it comes on. Crushes it and then tanks.

[18:02] Because they did believe and then they saw your reviews. Or they got customer support feedback.

[18:07] Or someone called him up after buying it was like fuck you. I can't believe you did that.

[18:11] And they're done. And then all their tones off because they feel like out of ethics. Right?

[18:15] And so I'm lowering my toner right now so you know that this is really important.

[18:20] And so I'll go up beat. Kiss the boo-boo, bring us back up.

[18:23] And so real estate sales team consulting. This is a great story. So I was flown out,

[18:28] paid way more money than I should have been paid to fly out and consult with the sales team.

[18:33] All right. They were selling mortgage leads. The examples given earlier.

[18:36] And they were really excited. They wanted me to give this ABC always be closing chat.

[18:40] Like this huge pump up chat. And so I spent the first half of the day on the script.

[18:44] And the second half the day was supposed to be drilling the sales team. Right? So I get on the sales team.

[18:47] They got I think at a nine percent sales fort. And they're like we're having some problems with

[18:51] that giant. I was like, all right. Cool. So I was like, John, how good are the leads?

[18:58] He was like, well, you know, there's kind of, and I was like, I'm good. Thank you.

[19:04] And I was like, because if you fucking thought the leads were good, you would say,

[19:08] dude, they're unreal. I can't believe it. Right now I'm getting my mom to pass her real estate

[19:12] certification. So I can start sending her leads. I'm studying for mine. I'm a couple months behind.

[19:15] But I'm telling you, I soon as I fucking get this thing bad. I'm out of here. I'm going to start buying

[19:19] these leads myself to make more than I make right now the sales guy. That's what you'd say if you

[19:24] believed. Right? The way you say and what you'd say would be entirely different. It's one of the hacks

[19:29] on this, by the way. Is anyone ever gotten hot or has sales guy got hot? So I just closed and closed

[19:34] and closed and closed it. Anyone? That becomes the sales training for that person. Because the way

[19:41] they ask the question at what point, how they closed, that's how it's perfect. And so they should

[19:47] study the best game footage when they're on a streak. And that's when you can replicate it much more

[19:51] easily. Because it's like in the wild, you're witness it. And that's when they're masters, right? In

[19:55] those moments. All right. And so these are the actions that we do. Some transitioning and

[19:58] tactic for you guys to have teams. All right. Re-read the testimonials out loud daily in front of

[20:03] your sales team. If you got fresh ones, what you should, read them, makes their day, make some

[20:09] feel like they're making impact. They're getting the shit kicked out of every single day,

[20:13] getting hung up on, getting cost at, getting to the fuck off every day. Right? And like the best thing

[20:17] you can do is give them a couple of coffins and say, hey man, you're fucking doing good in the world.

[20:21] Right? So they need. So do it every day. Number two, fix everything you can about the product.

[20:25] This is obvious. But I want to say directly, like don't blame the customer for lack of success

[20:29] because it doesn't help anyone. Right? Don't help them, doesn't help us. If we can take ownership,

[20:33] then we can fix the product. Right? Three, never stop improving it. So you always know it's up to

[20:38] date. And this is a good one for the sales team. If your sales dip, take your head of customer support,

[20:43] bring them to the sales meeting and say, Erica, tell these guys what you do for our customers.

[20:49] They're like, oh, well, the first day what we do is he said this text and we send this letter and

[20:52] we give them swag and then we follow up with them and then we like write in handwritten card and leave

[20:56] them a back massage and a foot massage and then we find a wife for them. It's unbelievable. You know what I mean?

[21:00] And then the sales guy is like, God, this is fucking awesome. I'm like, I know. Let's go sell it. Right?

[21:04] And so these are the actions that you could do on a daily basis to get your team to be excellent.

[21:09] All right. And so that's how you can hack conviction and get your team's tone

[21:13] unconsciously correct by just truly believing in the product. Is that cool? You think you could sell more if you did that?

[21:19] Sweet. Thank you. All right. Could fix your family work number two? Check. All right. Number three,

[21:25] scaling framework. How do you easily do it? Give us processed across sales people on any niche in seven days or less.

[21:31] So we've talked about closing the family, we talked about conviction framework. And this is

[21:34] something I'm going to skip one. I know we are right. Great. So when I showed my sales team to

[21:38] this stuff, they didn't do it every time. All right. Because you're probably going to come back from here.

[21:42] All gung ho. You might show them this video and they're like, yeah, and they go raw raw for two to three days.

[21:46] And then it's like back to normal. Right? No one wants that. So piece by piece, we implemented processes to get the same outcome

[21:52] over and over and over again. Because of the $110 million leaf sold, which is crazy, it's been 100%

[21:59] over the phone. No one over the age of 20. No, we all won't guys 40. But beyond besides him, everyone's younger than 27.

[22:07] Not 27 dollars. 27 years old. All right. Like these are like crazy, you know, I mean like crazy veterans, right?

[22:14] But just do this process of figuring out getting the right thing. As a total aside,

[22:19] find people and educate them about your prospect and your product.

[22:24] That's the big fuck up because they shouldn't even be talking to them much about the product.

[22:28] They should be knowing everything about the prospect. And so right now, if your sales training is focused on your product,

[22:33] doing it wrong. These are the six seas that I used to scale teams from little guy to lots of guys.

[22:39] All right. So this still, you know, we used this to build a 3000 person affiliate base in our physical products company.

[22:46] It added 35 million sales, which is cool, which is awesome. And so I will show you how this works.

[22:52] And so we've used these sales teams and this is how we've kind of these raw multi-figure teams.

[22:56] And I'll show you what we did. All right. So closer sequence is the first C, which we went over earlier.

[23:01] The second C is consistent daily training conviction. And I'll show you how to do each of these.

[23:06] Call recordings. You got a recording. Communication cycles. Cuts. A competition. There's the six seas.

[23:13] So number one, make sure you have a question-based framework that follows those steps in the script.

[23:18] It should just be questions. It's so much easier to just follow questions. Because if someone's out and, you know,

[23:23] out and left field, you know, wandering, like, under the highway, you're like, whoa, hey, come back over here.

[23:28] This is the next question in this process. So thank you so much for sharing that. That was so hard for you.

[23:32] So what do you think that brought you? You go right into the next question, the sale. All right.

[23:37] Number two. Consistent daily training. This is the number one thing. If you take one thing away from this,

[23:42] besides conviction, because that'll do more for yourselves than anything, this is the second biggest thing.

[23:47] Is that daily training, our team trained 60 minutes a day, five days a week. We actually do twice a day stuff.

[23:53] But that's okay. Anyways, for right now, if you just do this, you'll already be way better than everyone else in your market.

[23:57] All right. So we do talking in listening because the salesperson needs to know how to speak the right tone,

[24:03] you know to listen, right? As we drill both skills. For talking, we have to read the script out loud and the questions with the

[24:09] correct tonality for 25 minutes. And if they fuck up, let's start again. Simple.

[24:16] Five minutes. We drill obstacle overcomes. I need to think about it. I'm not sure.

[24:20] I don't have the money. Can't afford that right now. I got to talk to my partner. Right?

[24:24] I know it's going to work in my market or whatever your specific obstacle is. Because those when they're in the red zone,

[24:29] they shouldn't have to think about those. So the only two things that someone will ever truly memorize

[24:33] will be those 30 second anecdotal stories I mentioned earlier in your obstacle overcomes. It makes it much easier to get new people on the team.

[24:41] Listening. So every day, we'll listen to 30 minute recording and we'll go with what went right in this call.

[24:48] What went wrong? What do you do next time? Very simple. You play the call. Everyone watches.

[24:55] It's game tape review. We're like, man, you got kicked in the balls on this one. Right? But you had

[25:00] great rapport in the first five minutes. Right? You're like, what went wrong? And that was about it.

[25:07] And what you do next time, I'm a transition from the report of the question asking without sound like a douchebag.

[25:12] Fantastic. All right. Next day. And you continue to improve.

[25:16] I know this sounds crazy simple, but it's so simple, no, no, no, no. So number three,

[25:21] seize is call recordings. If you don't call it like record your calls one, you're not compliant. But two,

[25:25] like how are you going to study game film? You know what I mean? Everybody's got all their data. And you've got your

[25:29] mouse tracking on all the pages and like, where's the mouse tracking on the calls? Right? That's where

[25:34] we're going to train your team. This is like every NBA team. They play the game and they watch the game footage.

[25:38] Right? Why are we not doing that with the sales team? And so you have to record it. If you use zoom,

[25:42] gong is absolutely the best. How you recommend it? It's been awesome. We used it for two years.

[25:45] They'll tell you exactly how many minutes people are talking versus someone else. They'll tell you who's talking the most.

[25:49] Where how many questions were asked if the AI they have there is unbelievable. It's expensive, but it's worth it.

[25:55] Four, Comcyclos and feedback. I don't know if you guys have heard the story, but if I were trying to fix your golf swing.

[26:02] Right? And I said, okay. So I take a swing looking like I do like a like a like a nitty-it. Right?

[26:09] He's like, all right man. Well, first off, loose 40 pounds so you can rotate. All right. After you do that,

[26:14] change your risk by two degrees. Turn your other hand over, put your thumb underneath. I need to take your first foot,

[26:19] put it forward and then point it the other way and then put this foot back and try again. I'm fucked.

[26:24] No chance of swinging, right? But if you just said, hey, take another 20 swings and just put one thumb under the other one.

[26:32] I'd have one thing to work on. I could probably get better. And so when you're training and this is for the sales directors,

[26:37] if you're helping them out with that call, well what been right, what been wrong?

[26:41] What am I going to do about it? It's the one thing. So that makes sense. And so in terms of communication cycles,

[26:47] we do weekly with the team. We've got daily training. We've got daily wrap-up at the end,

[26:53] which is really just a pump-up and kiss them on the forehead good night to make sure they feel okay,

[26:57] right? Because they do get punched in the face all day so it's worth being like, hey,

[27:00] you see Derek, so overcome this morning is fucking awesome. He killed it. Let's watch that as like highlight footage.

[27:05] Like watch him say he's going to have to talk to his wife. Boow, overcome, right? And then

[27:09] then they'll like do you kill it and then it just makes them feel like they're part of the team, right?

[27:13] And so that's where we do the feedback in the communications cycles and then we do once a week if they're new,

[27:17] we'll do one of ones. If they're a little bit older, we'll do one say we're other week. So that makes sense.

[27:21] Can you use this right now? What I'm giving you for your sales teams? Okay, sweet.

[27:26] Number five. Cut the fat. Cut it fast.

[27:30] Randy probably knows it's better than anyone. When you hire salespeople, at least in my experience,

[27:37] like it's sinkers swim. Like if you guys, if guys can't close in the first week to two weeks

[27:42] and let's just some sort of crazy complex thing, they ain't closing, right? And then I've got somebody

[27:47] who now came in neutral. Now they feel like they suck, right? They're actually worse than someone who's new.

[27:52] Because now I got to overcome what you're believed to them bring you back up. And so in my experience,

[27:56] it's been much easier to take a six and get them to a nine than try and take a two and get them to a five.

[28:02] It's more work and it's not good for me or him, right? Does that make sense? So in most cases,

[28:08] is anyone have a salesperson that you've been waiting for them to turn the corner for the last like six months?

[28:12] They're not going to turn the corner. Unless they have like a come to G's moment, which does happen,

[28:16] but it doesn't need to happen on my team. You can do that and come back. All right.

[28:20] 6 Competition and Career Path, all right? It's a big one. So salespeople are competitive, right?

[28:28] As they should be, right? They are hunters and they should go hunt. And so having competition or regular basis,

[28:33] what we have found is that six week cycles tend to work best. That is long enough that they believe they're going to

[28:37] accomplish something, but sure enough that believe it's going to happen soon. And so we run our competitions on six week cycles.

[28:42] For us, I think whatever Ryan said about the percentages, 10 to 15 percent actually works pretty well as

[28:49] like a group goal. When we have those, it's like top salesperson would like we did like weekend,

[28:53] the Vegas, so we'll split all the guys that we like 14 to 4. You know what I mean? They're all competing.

[28:57] So it's like you get the competitiveness, but you still get the camaraderie. Because if it's just one,

[29:02] one versus everyone, sometimes they can get a little bit too, you know, T-C. And so having like

[29:07] little mini teams helps too, because then you can kind of like make it a adjusted draft. You put the

[29:10] best out at the worst guy and then he helps him out and he speeds him up. Does that make sense?

[29:14] And then career path, this is one that I probably learned later, but it's really good.

[29:18] Is that you can have minor, minor, road milestones, like 50 deals closed, 100 deals close,

[29:27] 150 deals close, right? And they just get a little, just a little, you know, they go from

[29:31] 500 to 525 a deal, right? They go from 525 a deal to 550 a deal. Just the fact that there's this

[29:37] roadmap of where they're going and there's actual progress because sales is one of the most repetitive positions in the world.

[29:45] Just the fact that they're doing this and there's something is changing on the outside. I think just helps

[29:49] relieving anxiety and help the guys focus. So that is one of the things that I would recommend doing.

[29:53] With the career path and then obviously if you have roles like depending how big your team is,

[29:57] manager, etc. And you can move up. Something that I don't have on here that I will add is that

[30:03] this seems to be common practice, but remember, don't miss Mark Dronerath.

[30:06] I'm going to add a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of

[30:36] of this, the six-seek for scaling our closer sequence, make sure that's in a question-based framework, daily trainings and convictions that you're reading the system all the time of your day, you're training them every morning on talking, listening to those valuable skills that a salesman can have, call recordings to make sure that they're actually doing a game-tative footage to actually look at, communication cycles to actually improve on their skills based on the game footage that we just had, you cut the bottom people who are just dragging the team down that probably just don't have the makeup for this, and then you keep it competitive and you give them a career pass so they have something to look forward to in the future.

[31:02] All right, and so now you can understand anyone's access, but it's a plug-baby pro, even if you don't think you're any good, which is completely normal.

[31:09] Yeah, that sounds.

[31:11] Thank you.

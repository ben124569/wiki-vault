[00:00] If we were to just trip on get to a million this year,

[00:02] would you be okay with that?

[00:03] I were gonna make you so much money.

[00:04] This is Ashley.

[00:05] She runs a personal styling business,

[00:06] and my name's Alchimozi,

[00:07] and I own Actors.com,

[00:09] which is a portfolio company

[00:09] to make some more money

[00:10] than I will ever need for this in my life.

[00:11] And so today,

[00:12] Ashley will be explaining to me

[00:14] her biggest business challenges.

[00:15] And I'm gonna try to help her,

[00:16] scalar business $2 million revenue in the up.

[00:18] All right,

[00:19] hi,

[00:20] I'm Ashley Caps.

[00:22] I am founder of AC Styles.

[00:24] So we are a professional wardrobe

[00:27] and personal styling service

[00:28] that helps transform our clients' confidence

[00:31] and save some time.

[00:32] So revenue,

[00:34] we make about $390,000 annually,

[00:37] 130,000 in profits,

[00:39] that gives us about 42% in net margins.

[00:42] So we've been in business for about four years,

[00:45] and so far,

[00:45] we've served over a thousand clients.

[00:47] Thousands clients.

[00:48] Yeah.

[00:49] How'd you get a thousand in four years?

[00:51] That's over my whole career.

[00:53] So the business has been for,

[00:55] you've done a thousand yourself.

[00:56] Awesome, super cool.

[00:57] So my immediate reaction was,

[00:58] she serves luxury clientele

[01:00] and a lot of people who serve luxury clientele

[01:02] don't charge enough

[01:03] because they sell out of their own wallet

[01:05] rather than out of the wallet of the person they're serving

[01:07] or the value that they're providing.

[01:08] So that was something else in the back of my mind.

[01:10] 42% profit margin,

[01:12] healthy,

[01:12] a little bit low,

[01:13] given the fact that I figured this was like a solar burner thing,

[01:15] so I was gonna be curious with the other cost of the business war

[01:18] to make this happen.

[01:19] To who do you help?

[01:19] Right now, about 50, 50 men and women,

[01:22] typically in their 40s,

[01:23] all the way to their mid 60s,

[01:24] these are folks that are stay at home moms,

[01:27] they could be frequent flyers,

[01:29] they could be going up in their career into the C-suite.

[01:31] Those that really value their time

[01:33] and really also value having expertise.

[01:36] So how do you help them?

[01:37] We transform our clients,

[01:38] fashion, style, and confidence

[01:40] and also help save them time.

[01:42] So we have two different phases in the way that we do things.

[01:45] So onboarding phase, phase one.

[01:46] So we do a style assessment.

[01:48] So basically we establish baseline with our current style.

[01:50] So low style, if you look terrible.

[01:52] Like look at the mirror, you look horrible.

[01:54] Pretty much.

[01:55] Okay.

[01:56] So in the baseline, and then we show them where they can go.

[01:58] So once we show them where they can go,

[02:00] that's when we go in, we got the closet,

[02:02] we get rid of everything,

[02:03] and we get them into some new outfits,

[02:05] looking, feeling good,

[02:07] and then from there, that's when we determine,

[02:09] just based on their lifestyle,

[02:10] does it make sense to work together on a monthly level,

[02:13] on a quarterly level.

[02:14] At that point, we have ongoing styling sessions,

[02:17] we put lookbooks together.

[02:18] Okay, I call.

[02:19] And we have like an on-demand service as well,

[02:21] that they can text us if like,

[02:22] a fact in emergency, if you will.

[02:24] Pretty much.

[02:25] When you say you show them what the future looks like,

[02:27] is that just like here's a,

[02:29] looks of like other models or something like that,

[02:31] or like putting together a style mood board.

[02:33] And then we also prior to that, we say,

[02:36] hey, just based on your complexion,

[02:37] here's the colors that are going to implement you,

[02:39] and then based on your dimensions of your figure,

[02:42] here's like the silhouette that

[02:43] are going to work best for you.

[02:44] Oh cool.

[02:45] And then a big component of it is lifestyle.

[02:47] Like what are they doing on a day-to-day life?

[02:50] And making sure that whatever they buy,

[02:52] fits the life that they're living today

[02:53] and not just like, oh, that looks really cool on a mannequin.

[02:56] Got it.

[02:57] Initial reaction seeing phase one and phase two

[02:59] that Ashley put together was good.

[03:01] Every quality business has recurring or reoccurring revenue.

[03:05] Recurring means some sort of membership or subscription,

[03:07] reoccurring is like Coca-Cola,

[03:09] you buy some Coca-Cola this month,

[03:10] and next month, even though you're not on a subscription.

[03:12] And so the quality of a service

[03:14] product is dictated by the percentage of customers

[03:16] that want to buy it again and again and again.

[03:17] The idea is that you want to acquire a customer once

[03:19] and have them pay you for the rest of their lives.

[03:21] So how do you make money?

[03:23] Important question.

[03:24] So onboarding package that I mentioned,

[03:26] 8500 bucks, that's over the course of 60 days.

[03:29] Then it goes into either monthly at 2K a month

[03:32] or quarterly at 4,500 or quarter.

[03:35] And then right now we also make about 10% of our revenue

[03:38] from commission from close.

[03:40] We get about 10% margins from the vendors that we work with.

[03:43] Okay.

[03:44] And right now, we just actually focused on having just

[03:47] this luxury tier in the past.

[03:49] We had two different tiers and we focused more on one time.

[03:52] And you've realized you make more money

[03:53] on the luxury tier so you do more of that.

[03:55] Love it.

[03:56] All right, so to you, so I'll take a mic money.

[03:57] Where do you find them?

[03:58] So right now we're doing ad words.

[04:00] We're spending about 300 month with Google

[04:02] and then we're also spending about 300 month with thumbtack.

[04:05] We have affiliates with other luxury-like services.

[04:07] So matchmakers and things like that.

[04:09] We host events and then also of course client referrals.

[04:12] Do you know what percentage of customers

[04:13] come from each of those?

[04:16] Roughly.

[04:17] You don't know where is.

[04:18] Four are coming from affiliates.

[04:21] Think about a third is coming from the other two.

[04:23] And then a third is coming from.

[04:25] So you're kind of like evenly split between referrals.

[04:28] Would you consider affiliates referrals or not?

[04:30] No, I kind of segment those out.

[04:31] Okay, so referrals is one.

[04:32] Affiliates is another than paid ads between thumbtack and Google.

[04:35] I like to understand what percentage of customers

[04:37] are coming from every source so that I can see.

[04:39] Like, is sometimes there's one where it's like,

[04:41] oh 90% of my customers come from this.

[04:43] And then when I ask where they're allocating their time,

[04:45] it's like, well, I'm putting half my time

[04:46] and this thing is getting me 10% of my customers.

[04:48] And then the other half of my time is getting me 90%.

[04:50] It's like, okay, well, then let's double down on that thing.

[04:52] And the next following question is like,

[04:54] okay, well, is this tapped out?

[04:55] Is this an exhausted source or can we do more?

[04:58] And most times, you can do more.

[04:59] Okay, so that's where you get them from.

[05:00] How many do you get a month?

[05:02] So right now we're looking at about 12 total leads,

[05:05] eight appointments, 100% show for those appointments.

[05:08] Total sales for, so close right, 50%, show right to 100%.

[05:12] 40 clients currently in one churned in the last year.

[05:16] Okay, these 40 clients still pay you monthly.

[05:19] These are active.

[05:20] Okay, so they're coming in from different timelines.

[05:24] So some are monthly, some are quarterly,

[05:25] some are annually, just different package testing.

[05:28] We're gonna probably talk about that in a second.

[05:30] The four clients think,

[05:31] because I think you're probably a big revenue opportunity there.

[05:33] So what's the goal right now?

[05:34] All right, so just the easy five million revenue.

[05:37] And really, I think what we can do is,

[05:39] because it's easy for me to get stylist to train them,

[05:42] is to build like an education component.

[05:44] Just like a totally different business.

[05:45] I know.

[05:47] But have stylist and major metros.

[05:50] Okay.

[05:50] So have stylist and other mentors

[05:52] and then the long term is to be able to create

[05:53] a training program for them.

[05:55] Like super long term, like super super long term.

[05:58] Super super long term.

[05:59] Like the next lifetime.

[06:00] Oh, I'm just messing with you.

[06:03] But fundamentally, for this business,

[06:04] the goal is five million doing what you currently do

[06:07] or a scaled up version of what you do.

[06:08] And in other major metros.

[06:10] Yeah, no that's cool.

[06:11] That makes sense.

[06:12] Five million, big number, we can do it.

[06:13] What's the problem?

[06:14] So what's holding you back?

[06:15] What's getting the way?

[06:16] Leeds.

[06:17] Okay.

[06:18] So what's the problem?

[06:19] We need more of them consistently.

[06:20] And we just need more at bats.

[06:22] That's really what it is.

[06:24] And also I haven't been able to be as consistent

[06:26] with content creation.

[06:27] And I think there's opportunity, Miss Ther.

[06:29] For most small business owners,

[06:30] as long as the core economics are good,

[06:32] which a lot of times they're not.

[06:33] Once you have the core economics to the business,

[06:35] you have your price properly.

[06:36] So you have enough first margin.

[06:37] You have good stick rates.

[06:39] And people want to keep paying you over and over again.

[06:40] They come back.

[06:41] They refer their friends,

[06:42] which actually has all of these things.

[06:43] Then it's kind of shifting back to the front and saying,

[06:45] we've got to get way more leads in the door.

[06:47] We're going to let more people know about it,

[06:49] which is going to come down to advertise.

[06:50] All right.

[06:50] Understand all that?

[06:52] Show me the numbers.

[06:52] So 309 and total revenue,

[06:55] 130 and profit, 42% net margin,

[06:58] blended cac of 600.

[07:00] LTV is 10K annually.

[07:03] So that gives us a 16 to 1 LTV to cat ratio,

[07:06] 600 in marketing spend,

[07:08] show rates 100%.

[07:10] 50.

[07:11] Okay.

[07:12] Got it.

[07:13] From a basic economic standpoint,

[07:15] her business is actually really healthy.

[07:17] The fact that she's only lost one customer over a year out of 40,

[07:20] that's whatever 2.5% churn annually is phenomenal.

[07:23] The fact that she has decent rates and clothes rates,

[07:26] all of that's good.

[07:26] And so me looking at these numbers shows me that she's

[07:29] delivering some core value to key audits.

[07:31] And honestly, it's just the end is low.

[07:33] She just needs to do way more volume.

[07:35] And then do you have any other stuff by platform?

[07:37] So Google, we're looking at 3,400 for the year for 2024.

[07:41] Cost for click, a dollar 89, total clicks, 1800.

[07:45] Do you have prices on the site?

[07:46] When they click where they click,

[07:47] does it show your prices?

[07:48] Or is it just like an opt-in page?

[07:49] I do not show prices.

[07:51] Is there a video?

[07:51] That's being implemented right now.

[07:53] Okay.

[07:54] Okay.

[07:54] But I think that that's the big problem.

[07:56] Is this a sell?

[07:57] Okay.

[07:58] And you don't give them anything, right?

[08:00] There's no reason for them to opt in.

[08:03] We're going to make you so much money.

[08:04] It's a lot of fun.

[08:05] So when I saw 1800 clicks in eight sales,

[08:07] it was clearly a conversion issue.

[08:09] And so she's leaking a huge amount of prospects.

[08:11] It weren't immediately ready to buy.

[08:13] Because that's all she has available.

[08:14] It's click here, schedule call, and basically buy.

[08:17] And there's no incentive.

[08:19] And so I'm very interested to see what we can do

[08:21] to solve that conversion issue

[08:23] because it could be a massive unlock for the business.

[08:26] So despite basically no incentive for someone

[08:29] to actually book a call, you're still making eight sales.

[08:33] And so I think that was happening right now

[08:34] is they like the shop rate and the clothes rates you have.

[08:37] Like you're just basically skimming the absolute people

[08:39] who are like, are in such a dire game.

[08:42] And you don't know them

[08:43] because they're coming from ads, right?

[08:44] Right.

[08:45] Right.

[08:46] If you're in that situation, then like,

[08:48] like this may sound exciting for you.

[08:50] But like you could probably five to 10x the sales

[08:52] of the business just by fixing this.

[08:54] And we do nothing else.

[08:55] And you could just do that.

[08:56] So we'll get into that in a second.

[08:57] But okay.

[08:57] The good news is that even with the massive amount

[09:00] of inefficiency that's there,

[09:01] you'll see what you can't so early strong.

[09:02] It's really good.

[09:03] And I think we're just losing it.

[09:05] We're just leaking a lot in this process.

[09:07] Okay, show me the thumb, thumb tech one.

[09:09] Okay.

[09:10] Also people that are in pain right now

[09:12] because they know that they're searching for it.

[09:13] Yeah.

[09:14] So six K total spent.

[09:15] So you got leads here.

[09:16] Okay.

[09:17] Eight leads, 38 bucks a lead.

[09:19] Total sales, eight,

[09:20] 10, 750 same LTV.

[09:22] Okay.

[09:23] Thing is thumb tech is like 90 to 95%

[09:27] on qualified in terms of purchasing power.

[09:29] Hmm.

[09:30] So it's good because it was a way for us to rank higher.

[09:34] Uh-huh.

[09:35] For SEO through this page.

[09:37] Uh-huh.

[09:38] Through your thumb tech page

[09:38] that you then pay extra to promote.

[09:40] Yeah.

[09:40] On thumb tech.

[09:41] Okay, cool.

[09:42] 30 bucks at least not bad.

[09:43] Given the price point that you have.

[09:44] But the issues that they are unqualified.

[09:47] So you actually do have a minimum income requirement.

[09:50] I would say for this new model a million.

[09:53] A year and income?

[09:53] Yeah.

[09:54] Okay.

[09:55] So yeah.

[09:55] So this is definitely a top one percent.

[09:57] Because one percent.

[09:58] 8,500 plus what is like it's about 25K all in for the service.

[10:03] The other thing is they have to have money for the clothes as well.

[10:05] Yeah.

[10:06] So you're looking at about a 40, 50K.

[10:09] Let's just even say 25K years spent in clothes.

[10:13] Average, Joe Schmokenot.

[10:15] Yeah.

[10:16] I love that Ashley is going after high income earners.

[10:19] I think a lot of business owners are afraid to go after high income earners.

[10:21] And very happy that Ashley's already identified rather than trying to say like,

[10:24] I'm trying to come up with this diet, light really mini version.

[10:27] She's just leaned into what she's obviously really passionate about.

[10:29] And just trying to find the customers who can actually afford to do the type of work

[10:33] that she wants to help them with.

[10:34] She doesn't compromise her quality to meet lower end customers.

[10:37] And I think that's really cool.

[10:38] To be clear, I'm not saying that there's not a space in the market for something like that.

[10:41] It's just obviously not her passion.

[10:42] And so she should stick to what she loves.

[10:44] Is there a specific life event or something that happens that triggers people

[10:48] to like getting, at a getting into this buying cycle?

[10:50] Yeah.

[10:50] So it is typically a transition moment.

[10:54] I had a baby.

[10:55] My body has changed.

[10:56] No, no, no, I closed fit.

[10:57] That's for women.

[10:58] I got divorced both men and women.

[11:00] Or I'm just, I'm getting, I want to start dating.

[11:03] Yeah.

[11:04] My image isn't match my status.

[11:05] That sea level person, even VP.

[11:08] Yeah.

[11:09] So that's what you say.

[11:11] No, it's in the typical triggers.

[11:13] Okay.

[11:14] I feel triggered.

[11:15] No, you're good.

[11:16] Okay, so that's the thumb-dact data.

[11:17] Tell me more about the affiliate side.

[11:20] The, the, the, because you've got, I've got, I get both of these, these, I understand

[11:23] the referral side.

[11:24] I understand both of your pay-dact acquisition parts.

[11:26] I think the continuity is lacking.

[11:27] We can work on that.

[11:28] I think with there's an efficiency add funnel.

[11:30] We'll talk about that.

[11:31] I think affiliates is kind of the last piece before we dive into like figuring out what we're

[11:35] going to do.

[11:35] So there's you don't know who affiliate is.

[11:37] Come closer.

[11:38] I've got a book 100 milliliters and inside, I'll read you the definition.

[11:42] So affiliates are independent businesses that tell their audience to buy your stuff.

[11:46] And so affiliate seem like referrals on the outside, but are actually much different

[11:50] under the hood.

[11:51] First, they have their own businesses and do their own advertising.

[11:54] Second, they read off for your stuff to their engaged leads and exchange for money,

[11:58] free stuff for both.

[12:00] So she has these social clubs and these matchmakers that are existing businesses that

[12:04] advertise their own services.

[12:06] And she can kind of harness those businesses to just funnel some of their leads her way

[12:12] for free.

[12:13] Now, she has to do some sort of deal with them to make it worth their while.

[12:16] But sometimes some businesses are like, oh, you help my customers too and I don't want

[12:19] to do that.

[12:20] So here.

[12:21] So basically, it's just like a lead pass through.

[12:25] So they make the introduction and we offer a complimentary style assessment to help them

[12:30] get their dating profiles ready.

[12:32] It's really just a glorified sales call.

[12:34] Okay.

[12:35] Yeah.

[12:36] And so you have these how many matchmakers do you have who were for you customers

[12:38] on regular basis?

[12:39] So combination of private social club and matchmakers, we have about six.

[12:45] Okay.

[12:46] How did you find them?

[12:47] Googling them and reaching out.

[12:48] But you reached out and did it that way?

[12:50] And what percentage did they send you?

[12:52] So as of this year, it's about a third.

[12:56] And to rest.

[12:59] So when I see that she's got only six people that are sitting her a third of her

[13:04] business and then when I asked how she got them, she just said, oh, I just kind of like

[13:08] Google them and reached out.

[13:09] I was like, I had an inkling that she had not done that much work to get a third of

[13:14] her business.

[13:15] That sounds like one time effort and then ongoing new business.

[13:19] Like that's the type of high leverage work that I love to see because then each of these

[13:22] affiliates become consistent nodes of business for you.

[13:25] So even though the customers themselves may or may not recur, obviously she is a

[13:29] referring revenue model.

[13:30] But the affiliates themselves become consistent traffic sources where they send every

[13:34] month, one or two customers, one or two customers, one or two customers, and so all we have

[13:38] to do is say, how do we go from six to 60?

[13:40] Okay, cool.

[13:41] It's because it's like very aligned audiences.

[13:44] Yeah.

[13:45] They're literally already buying the types of services related to what you want.

[13:49] Yeah, it's great.

[13:50] I feel like I'm a pretty clear and what you said.

[13:51] Okay.

[13:52] Yeah.

[13:53] But if you were to become an AC style, it's quite nice.

[13:55] Okay.

[13:56] Here's an outfit.

[13:57] These really nice olive undertones, dark features, so navy browns, these are your tones.

[14:04] And they're in action.

[14:05] I like that.

[14:09] We want to look like the one of the right.

[14:11] We actually look like the one on the left.

[14:12] I could be a good chat.

[14:14] This could be me.

[14:15] Thank you.

[14:16] No, I appreciate it.

[14:17] This is good.

[14:18] Okay.

[14:19] So you want to make five million, right?

[14:21] And we're at 300.

[14:22] So that's a 17X from where you currently are.

[14:25] And so if we were to just triple and get to a million this year, would you be okay with that?

[14:29] Totally that way.

[14:30] Because then going from a triple to a five X from there is like, because the thing is,

[14:34] the business will usually change, there's something called the Chinese rule of three and

[14:38] ten, which fundamentally just means that Sipsons break when they triple.

[14:40] And so I like to think in triples, in terms of, unless there's some massive order of

[14:44] magnitude change that we can do, but the things that we have right now, a handful of these

[14:47] are triples independently.

[14:49] And so one put together, I think we absolutely could get the five, but I just like setting

[14:54] goals and expectations kind of that way so that you're not like, oh my god, I only made

[14:57] a million dollars.

[14:58] Okay.

[14:59] So Ashley's about to go over to this side of the table and I'm going to walk through

[15:02] a bunch of solutions I think can help agrarabistness.

[15:04] But before I do that, comment below and would love to see how you guys think and how

[15:07] compares to what we ultimately end up doing.

[15:09] All right.

[15:10] That was awesome.

[15:11] You did great.

[15:12] I've got some notes.

[15:13] One you should have over here and we'll game-play it out.

[15:15] I think what I want to do is break this down in terms of who.

[15:17] So let's talk about the avatar a little bit because then that'll inform the offer and

[15:22] paid add stuff a little bit more to get it targeted and then clean up the funnel.

[15:25] So first thing I want to talk about is going to be the avatar is getting clarity on who

[15:29] you are going to serve because right now you serve a lot of people not to see that it's

[15:32] a bad thing, but I think over time we are going to get narrower so that we can make our value

[15:36] proposition a little bit more compelling for them.

[15:38] The next is going to be the paid adds funnel which we're going to look at the pages and

[15:42] we're going to look at the offers so that we can see, okay, can we tweak something we

[15:45] add a lead magnet here that would get the right people and ward off the bad ones and

[15:48] if there are some process things that we can do that just will stop the leakage.

[15:52] The third piece is still acquisition so it'll be affiliates that I want to cover and then

[15:55] the fourth what I want to hit on is continuity.

[15:59] And so those are the big four that I want to hit on.

[16:01] We can talk about the corporate thing that you mentioned in between.

[16:03] My initial got reaction is not yet because the thing is like if we can get to a million

[16:07] probably we could probably give them the things that I think that we're going to uncover

[16:10] here you could probably get to like two ish to the three just from some of the

[16:14] things we're going to show you in a second.

[16:15] Okay.

[16:16] So if you get to there you're at three you might be like wow what if I just kept

[16:19] doing this rather than the other thing.

[16:22] Okay.

[16:23] So avatar clarity.

[16:24] Do you have any idea if there are some customers that are like we better than

[16:28] others or that you enjoy working with more like what's your dream customer and just

[16:31] like work backwards and there.

[16:32] Stay at home mom.

[16:33] Okay.

[16:34] Frequent traveler.

[16:36] Kids with many social events.

[16:39] Who has kids with many social events.

[16:41] Yeah.

[16:42] Okay.

[16:43] So you just got married.

[16:44] Okay.

[16:45] Sun is having a baby that kind of thing.

[16:47] So usually mom would say it's mom right so there's kids obviously because mom.

[16:49] Okay.

[16:50] I got a few of these women.

[16:51] Plus money.

[16:52] Got it.

[16:53] And they just want to have new outfits for all of their social life.

[16:57] Social life.

[16:58] But private.

[16:59] Not what people like.

[17:00] Yeah.

[17:01] I understand.

[17:02] Okay.

[17:03] So mom social life is that the number one your favorite avatar?

[17:04] And then men, CEOs.

[17:07] Okay.

[17:08] My percentage of revenue is at 50, 50.

[17:11] Yeah.

[17:12] It is interesting.

[17:13] Okay.

[17:14] See you on the day.

[17:15] Do you ever get cross-sales?

[17:17] See you men get wife.

[17:19] Wife starts or husband starts.

[17:21] Typically wife starts.

[17:22] Interesting.

[17:23] This is cool to us to actually that she really understands her avatar and she understands

[17:26] kind of the part of their life that they're going through and what path to status they're

[17:30] seeking to fill with her services.

[17:32] And the reason I was pushing on this is because sometimes you'll find a business

[17:35] that deserves two type of customers.

[17:37] Hates one loves the other and then still feels like kind of a holding the keeping that

[17:40] one that they don't like because maybe it starts paying the bills.

[17:43] And then also the reason I asked for the split is this as silly as a sound.

[17:46] Sometimes it's like 30% of my business is this customer I hate.

[17:49] And 70% of the business is customer I love.

[17:51] And in those instances it's like great get rid of those ones and double down on these ones

[17:55] that you love.

[17:56] Now she happens to love both.

[17:57] And so maybe in the future maybe at 3 million maybe at 5 million a year I would

[18:00] maybe look at this to revisit and say hey now that we've had way more reps do one of these

[18:05] customers stay longer.

[18:06] Are they worth more of some of these you know people refer more than others but right now

[18:09] given the data we have I don't want to have her pick I'm cool with sticking with us.

[18:13] Pay Dad's phone.

[18:14] Can we pull up her Google ads?

[18:16] Oh so they're not running right now.

[18:17] Oh they're not running right now.

[18:18] Okay do you know what page they go to?

[18:20] Let's go to the work with us page personal styling.

[18:23] It's probably the closest.

[18:25] Okay is it get more info?

[18:26] If we click that will that take us there?

[18:28] No.

[18:29] Okay.

[18:30] Click on that though.

[18:31] That takes us to.

[18:33] So right now they're filling out this air table form that and then I sent him kind of a

[18:40] brochure that breaks down our services and then gets into book a call.

[18:44] So that's a very simple funnel.

[18:46] All right so this is them filling out they basically check these boxes and then scroll

[18:51] down okay so we have the contact first.

[18:53] This is a big application.

[18:54] Yeah.

[18:55] Okay so first thing that we can do on this one is obviously this isn't I mean you could

[19:00] okay there's a lot of things here.

[19:02] But wherever you're driving your traffic too so whether it's the homepage or it's

[19:06] this page you probably have some big lead magnet that people are going to want.

[19:10] What's something that somebody like that would want a lot?

[19:12] So that's been my thing after reading offers and thinking about a lead magnet it's like

[19:16] what appeals to these people and they don't want to sit there and like get a checklist of

[19:19] how to go through their closet themselves.

[19:22] So the only thing I could think of and this isn't very scalable is the complimentary style

[19:26] assessment but that's one I want with somebody.

[19:29] And that's okay though because I mean you're still getting them to more of them

[19:31] as you opt in but right now is the assessment the thing that they're booking on the

[19:34] Google Ads page today.

[19:36] It's just a call.

[19:38] Okay so not being positioned as that.

[19:41] So right.

[19:42] Like the the one point in a version is style assessment is what you can basically promise

[19:47] them on the landing page.

[19:50] But I was thinking more something like really tactical like the perfect outfit for you

[19:55] like one perfect outfit or something to match their skin to like the your idea colors

[20:00] like that would be a cool because like that doesn't you have to like put a whole thing

[20:03] together.

[20:04] It's just like this skin tone you know there's like 10 tones and you just pick the one

[20:07] that's appropriate for them.

[20:08] Yeah.

[20:09] Okay so we we're gonna we we're gonna do that next and also something else we were

[20:15] going to do the one perfect outfit but it's kind of so nuanced but then we were thinking

[20:19] okay what if we just share with them hey here's how big what are some of the steps

[20:23] that they do to prepare to if they were to work with us how are they invested so we're

[20:27] thinking like taking their measurements having them do some of these steps like creating a

[20:33] a mood board themselves.

[20:35] So we want them so for a lead man to be really valuable we want it to be risk-free easy and fast

[20:41] and so those things require effort and so we don't want the avatar to work to get the

[20:46] value we want them to just click and get the value.

[20:49] Okay and so I think what we think about is like I like I think this is actually really

[20:53] interesting this is just me personally so maybe I'm a CEO man but it's like there

[20:56] are some some skin tones that combination basically it's like you have a combination of hair

[21:01] and skin tone and eye color that is unique to you and between all these different

[21:04] permutations there's a hundred different variations people can have and they have a different

[21:08] color palette that would be unique to them now you'll know behind the scenes that there's

[21:11] probably like eight different you know color style or whatever and so I think either

[21:16] doing color because that feels like the easiest one degree more nuanced than that would

[21:19] be a specific style being like you know straight where hip hot like whatever you know I'm

[21:24] saying like you know that better than me.

[21:26] Fashion all yeah exactly and so I think that this is like you could do this tomorrow

[21:31] going to change anything just by repositioning lead magnet so the reason that I'm hitting

[21:34] so hard to lead magnets and I have a whole chapter about this inside the leads book is

[21:38] lead magnets how to engage your leads is that she has this huge leak in her in her phone

[21:41] right 18 her collects only eight sales so it's like we can solve this with the right lead

[21:45] magnet now most people give terrible lead magnets so so a lot of people give no lead

[21:49] magnets the the the the few that do give lead magnets often give terrible lead magnets and so

[21:53] we want to have an exceptionally lead magnet which typically means we have to work more on the front

[21:58] end so that our prospect has to work less and so it's kind of like pre-digesting the food so

[22:01] they can just immediately get the value think value is a baby bird just kind of feeding your

[22:05] prospects the value and as a little pro tip for you if you have the choice between two lead magnets

[22:10] one thing that's more valuable but takes longer and the other is less valuable but immediate

[22:15] this is the one that customers will rather have especially as a lead magnet which then can

[22:19] lead to a service that looks more like this I would experiment with the different headlines

[22:23] there and then we need to measure the conversion rate of the page and that you've turned them down

[22:26] can you pull up the the her numbers the interesting thing here is like 1800 clicks I think we could

[22:32] be able to get somewhere in the neighborhood of like if we're doing this right like 500 leads

[22:36] from that amount of spend and just if literally we just need to nail this because on a Google ad

[22:42] high-intent search like this you should be able to get like 30% of people out to it so from a benchmark

[22:50] to this to something that is right for this audience the only reason we were able to identify this

[22:56] whole and huge opportunity and actually spaces because she actually had her data and so it is amazing

[23:02] to meet the amount of business owners who have no data on the business and they're like man I don't

[23:05] know what to do well once you get the data the data can often tell you where your opportunities are and

[23:09] so here there is a clear leak now she might not know the benchmarks for this but having been in the

[23:15] industry of business typically an opt-in page for some sort of lead magnet with qualified traffic can

[23:19] get somewhere between 20 and 50 sometimes 60% of people to opt-in for it if it's very clearly to

[23:24] find and there's a good match between the traffic that's coming in and so for her me saying I think

[23:29] 30% is a good benchmark is kind of where that came from so if someone's looking for personal

[23:32] size near me or personal size L.A. then it's like what is the first piece and like I always think about

[23:37] like our offer is you've got all these steps as someone has to take can I peel off the first one

[23:41] even though it's something that I normally charge for what's my actual cost it's going to be time

[23:46] can I template some of these things out so that I can still provide a lot of value but not have

[23:49] it take too much of my personal time and the cool thing with these like kind of like more costly or

[23:56] unscalabolied magnets is that you only have to give it to people who are qualified so you are not obligated

[24:01] to like you can choose to do this only if someone meets these qualifications and you just say that in

[24:05] the landing page so it's like hey if you're a mom with kids and a socialite or you're a shield guy

[24:10] and you're not getting what you want then like it's gets one of our style assessments where we'll

[24:17] go through personally your skin tone your hair color your eye color and find the things that will

[24:21] immediately make you look better just with the inner existing closet because that's like again they don't

[24:25] have to do anything and they'll immediately look better that's like immediate value not a lot of work

[24:29] okay so I'm like okay that's what we're going to offer so now I can get more people to apply

[24:33] now they're going to fill out their stuff and again if they're not qualified that's like what you

[24:36] didn't read the headlines it don't worry about it and then for them I would probably just send them some

[24:39] free things that they feel you know you still get them something but that would be the thing that I would

[24:42] do to improve the funnel right off the bat without really even seeing the funnel is clear ahead

[24:47] line around what they're going to get sub headline is either an image of like almost like a before

[24:52] and after a style or some sort of image that shows you know white skin brown hair don't do this

[24:59] okay and then they're like oh shoot I do that and so just like a simple thing that they're like shoot I do that

[25:03] and then they're like oh my god I need help and so all we're doing is increasing deprivation so that

[25:07] they take the next action okay so that would be the lead magnet component that I would do for these

[25:11] paydance now I think that you have the scheduler so they they apply it then they schedule I know you're

[25:17] going to put the video together yeah there's the video before the call that gets them to book

[25:22] and then I would probably consider sending them a second video between booking and showing

[25:27] okay and then that does a little bit of the pre-sale for you and I think about this in terms of like

[25:31] what are those things that you repeat on a regular basis on the call so there's usually like

[25:35] in every call there's kind of like a little bit of a sales pitch that occurs where you're like okay so

[25:39] let me tell you what we do I just try to put as much of that before the call so that I can spend the

[25:43] majority of the call on the person the decision making process rather than basically have this like

[25:49] pre-recorded script that I have to keep reading over it because the tires out you tires out

[25:52] your sales team eventually and so I would just I'd that's how I would I would try to do it I think that if

[25:56] we can do a lead magnet we can capture any more leads I think if we add the video to the

[26:00] till landing page so we have our page there we go we've got a little video here and so then we have

[26:08] our little scheduler underneath now this booker we should have our qualifications so we want to have

[26:16] like income right do you do s frame come no I would ask for income or budget if you only knew

[26:23] two or three things about them to make them qualified what would you want to know are they open to

[26:28] it's okay open to change yeah okay what about start date yeah that too okay

[26:37] the budget's really honestly the biggest thing okay well then I would definitely have that be

[26:40] prominently do you think it makes sense to put the pricing no no I don't think so I think that if

[26:47] we ask for qualifications and we describe the services that will give us 80 percent and then

[26:52] basically you just want to find because the thing is is like you don't want to just what because

[26:55] there's some people who will be in who have a smaller income but really want this yeah and so it's

[26:59] finding kind of that sweet spot which is like if someone then says like I want to start immediately I'm

[27:03] super open and they're budget's like medium then you probably take the call right if they're like

[27:07] my budget zero then like okay what does it matter how bad do you want it it's not going to work right

[27:11] so two important points here one is that when you give a very valuable lead magnet away you don't

[27:16] have to give away to everyone and so we want to make our lead magnet super valuable but only give

[27:20] them to qualified customers and so that's what makes it kind of like a honey trap for the right

[27:24] time of people number two is that what I'm going through is bands which is budget authority need timing

[27:29] and so that's what most people need in order to be qualified to then you know get closed and so

[27:33] asking those things kind of in the friction process helps push out the bad traffic and help us

[27:38] judge and score the lead that are coming in so that we can see which of these have the highest

[27:41] negative closing and then prioritize the leads to sell and so I think that on your qualification

[27:46] question which you'll have on your scheduler we just asked for the few amount of questions that are

[27:50] required for us to make the decision whether or not they should stay here all right so now we just have to

[27:54] figure out and this is where like the headline is like free you know look better you know dress

[28:04] for your your tone whatever and so this is something that you will just test more than anything else

[28:16] and it'll be relevant to whatever your little free be that you're going to give them okay

[28:20] and I like I really like the like existing clothes so like how to best use your existing closet

[28:26] I think is a really strong angle because now they're going to come in and then you're going to be like

[28:31] oh you don't have one of these oh you don't want to these ah like and then it's like and then you're like

[28:35] you're in the sale right so this is probably what I would do for the lender and I think that if we did that

[28:39] that'll give us more throughput that'll give us more leads in terms of follow-up you currently

[28:44] don't really have follow-up oh and like manual hey checking and kind of thing mm-hmm so

[28:50] if we want to have the 201 version of this we can take this scheduler and put it here which is like the

[28:55] thank you page and then just make this an opt-in where we just ask for this and then if they're qualified

[29:02] they go here and if they're unqualified they go like free thing you just give them a free thing

[29:08] that way you don't have to waste your time and they don't they don't feel like your calendar

[29:11] oh okay and that's like something different than the then the either of these are saying yeah

[29:15] okay we're doing an automated version of the same thing right right and so if we wanted to make it seem

[29:21] a little bit more we put it skin so like it it'll feel personalized if you're like what's your

[29:25] skin coat of what your hair color which your eye color that might be an easy thing that you

[29:28] could ask if you're like oh okay this is personalized and so if they say they have no money then it goes to

[29:33] the here's what people who have brown hair and white skin or whatever and then they can just get

[29:37] that free thing and then if they are qualified and have the money that's like hey great all you

[29:40] get it is you know book your appointment below and look for the talking to you and then you just

[29:44] work the lead confirm the appointment just like you normally would but then the lead is not so much

[29:48] about okay so tell me about where you're at with your style it's I think you'll do without in the

[29:52] sales call okay but I thought that with this skin tone thing will deliver it on the sales call

[29:58] delivered on the sales call right just trying to think how that would how do you how do you fit

[30:04] that into the script so the way I would think through this is that I'm gonna have like 10 templates

[30:08] that I know that are color palettes that work for these 10 you know characteristics people and if I

[30:13] have asked their skin hair whatever upfront then I know what I'm going into the call

[30:18] which template I'm going to be using when I talk to them so it's like hey oh you're above above

[30:22] blah blah blah I actually know I would describe you more as an outlet than white and I think this

[30:25] might actually be a better thing for you cool okay and then you go into your normal sales process

[30:29] which obviously works I don't I don't even want to talk about so the scale of the close and 50%

[30:32] okay right now it's like book a call a sales call basically and that's like obvious what I'm

[30:38] speaking about but then this feels like oh just have a call about skin tone this is sales

[30:44] yeah and then it's not an issue because we're they're already qualified you're only taking the calls

[30:49] of people who have the income so you're gonna take more calls you're also gonna hear more knows

[30:52] but you're gonna make more money like fundamentally I could I could just say like I could run a

[30:57] net that just said hey I have this really expensive thing book here if you want it and this is the

[31:02] price and the people who up on those calls will be incredibly qualified but if I just said I have

[31:07] this really free amazing thing that I'll help you with the first problem let me help you with that

[31:11] and then people are like oh but do you do any of I you know what I do do that stuff it's so funny

[31:15] you ask and I get 10 times the calls and so if I close 30% of a 10x number I still close three times

[31:21] the deals okay so make sense yeah and so there's a little bit and a part of it is because you're

[31:25] selling out of your own wallet in terms of time and so it's because you're like I have my time and

[31:30] I understand that but all we have to do is just tweak these things so like if you have somebody who

[31:34] you have the information about them you have the income and so what I try to do for these is band

[31:41] so budget this is kind of like the authority can you make the decision need how bad you want it

[31:49] which is your biggest problem and then timing when you want to start if I were to accept you

[31:54] when you get started and so you want somebody who says immediately I'm in high need I can make the

[31:58] decision and I have the money and so that's fundamentally what these are and if you want to add

[32:02] your personalization of like skin and hair and what you know is what it's like you know eyes

[32:09] upload your photo yeah oh really yeah that one's going to be a lot of friction so I would consider

[32:14] having that in the fall process okay because I want someone's like taking a phone and I got

[32:17] uploaded picture oh well because the thing with this there's a decision they have to make they're

[32:20] going to be like what picture am I going to pick and then it's just and then they're gone they're like

[32:23] in another world and then they're their phone and then I go yeah I forgot I have to call

[32:26] Sandra back and then it's like they're off I mean I can really just train somebody to just do it live

[32:31] yeah I mean as many things as possible you can do like we want to decrease the friction here

[32:36] four qualified people right so there's good friction bad friction so good friction is

[32:41] something that increases the overall point of lead and gets out people who suck bad friction gets

[32:46] everyone out a slow page load time for example everyone leaves good people and bad people we want to

[32:51] get the type of friction that only bad people leave and good people stay okay and so if we have

[32:55] budget authority need timing we have the specific things relative the lead magnet then you're follow

[33:00] up if you want like hey if you can send me a picture be great if not I can just go off of your

[33:03] face with profile something like that then they show up to the call you have your one of 10 plates

[33:06] that you already figured out ahead of time that then sets up the sale which is for you it's like oh you

[33:11] don't have this this this and this all we're doing is expanding the gap of like you're here you want to

[33:14] be here oh you're missing all this stuff oh you know what so funny I think you'd be perfect fit

[33:18] for we have can I tell you about it and then you're it got it to make sense yeah okay so this is what I

[33:24] would do to change the paid ads funnel can you spend more on this yeah well I'm like dude if you

[33:29] if I had a machine in front of me where are you and this is without you doing any of this that's

[33:34] the crazy thing that's without you doing any of this right so if I said okay um instead of paying

[33:39] $3,400 a year what if we paid like $3,400 a month yeah well that would 12 extra business that be chill

[33:46] right yeah I mean it beats the S&P 500 where you put a dollar and it's $23 back within the next

[33:51] week it's not bad right a lot of business owners are scared to spend more money on marketing because

[33:56] they don't have the data to show what the return is if you have a machine in front of you where you

[33:59] put a dollar in and it spits out $16 back in 30 days why would you have any kind of limit on that

[34:05] budget you'd put as many dollars in that machine as you possibly could right of course and so she

[34:09] has one of these machines and probably just in preparation for this show uh she got the LTV to

[34:13] Kak ready so she could see what a discrepancy to was if you don't know what LTV to Kak is it's the

[34:17] lifetime value of the customer relative to the cost of parking them so basically how much money does

[34:21] it cost me to get a customer and then how much money do I get from that customer once I got them

[34:24] the cheaper it is to get a customer and then the more money they give you the greater the

[34:29] description between those two numbers the more money potential there is in the business and so this is

[34:33] fundamentally the economic arbitrage that exists at the core of every business that then fuels

[34:38] all the growth of everything and here's the craziest part actually it's getting $23 back for

[34:43] every one dollar she puts into her machine and she's only spending $3400 per year in this machine but

[34:49] that $3400 times 23 is generating $78,000 in income within a year like imagine investing in the

[34:57] S&P 500 putting $3400 into the end of the year it's $78,000 you'd be like oh well it's the

[35:01] most amazing investment all I've heard business has that inside of it and she's like hey I don't

[35:05] want to put too much in I'm just giving a plunder chain but a lot of businesses have these huge

[35:09] treasure troves that are just sitting there and not being leveraged I'm going to put an order of

[35:14] actions here so I'm going to tear this off because we're going to save it and then the end we're

[35:17] going to order everything okay so the next thing that I want to go over is the affiliate because I think

[35:22] that's really important you would not touch Facebook ads well you already have an acquisition channel

[35:26] it's working in super profitable so I'm less likely to want to do that now so because you can spend

[35:31] more if you wanted to we'll do that I'll actually I thought it was a note for me so I'm going to put

[35:38] steps in here for you okay all right let's talk about affiliates so matchmakers yes okay so you have

[35:44] six matchmakers right now four matchmakers two private clubs okay so I'll go whatever yeah you're good

[35:54] okay so you got six affiliates yeah you've got four matchmakers and two private clubs okay

[36:00] got it so how much time did it take you to get each of these affiliates not much time okay

[36:07] we did a cursory google search of LA and found that there were multiple hundreds of the people who

[36:11] do this so in a magic world would it take for us to go from six to 60 yeah I think not that long

[36:22] okay and each of these sends you people under an inconsistent basis yeah what was the process that

[36:27] you did to integrate with them I met with the owner and exceeded outreach to get them manual outreach

[36:34] okay is it like phone calls tax email DM okay yeah annual outreach

[36:40] explained that we can offer a complementary service their new clients okay and you know that we

[36:46] we could close them love this almost like it's directly out of the affiliate section in the book

[36:53] wherever it is here at his catalogue you got her something all right anyways keep up

[36:58] and that's and then they would it what percentage do you close the people that you talked to

[37:03] um that's been the hard part is like talking getting them okay genome any outreach attempts you did to

[37:09] get to the sex um probably about 40 okay and I want to I want to paint something for

[37:21] things it's gonna be interesting okay it's not often that you find you know a single point of

[37:27] leverage in a business that's as clear cut as this one is for Ashley when I do find them I get

[37:33] very excited about it because it's like these are the things that can change people's lives right

[37:37] it can change the income they can have the the neighbor they live in the school's

[37:40] there the kids go to and just completely can change a family tree for generations and so when I find

[37:45] these types of opportunities I just like I I light up because I'm so excited about it because I know

[37:48] what's going to happen I know what's going to happen later once this lever gets really cool when she

[37:52] said that she'd only emailed 40 people to generate a third of her revenue like 40 emails because

[37:58] I have a context of what kind of response rates cold email gets and it's certainly not you closing

[38:04] 15% of cold out now normally if you get 1% or a half or percent you're thrilled and so she's at like

[38:10] 10 times the efficiency 15 times the efficiency of what normal outbound does and so as soon as I saw

[38:16] that I was like this is it she said 40 emails and you were able to close six right okay now how much

[38:22] money do those six so it's a third of your revenue right so it's 100,000 owners of your roughly

[38:27] okay so think about this so every one of these emails need you 2500

[38:33] yeah that feels like pretty good turn yeah for sending emails probably copy and paste

[38:39] right mm mm mm do you more of them what I've I've a wild idea what if we send for 100 emails

[39:03] yeah that's it yeah if Ashley Jessica is from six to 60 affiliates and they're currently a third

[39:13] then that would be a 10x of something that's one third so that alone would more than triple her

[39:20] business and here's the crazy part what's the cost of sending 400 emails it's even less than the

[39:25] paid ads so her LTV to cack on this particular channel is even better than her paid ads channel which

[39:31] is already insane I don't even want to mess with the affiliate process that you have right now

[39:35] yeah you're reaching out manually is obviously effective you sent out 40 emails like if you did

[39:40] that for four hours every day mine that I mean you'd probably be able to send even if you did them

[39:45] completely personalized completely manual the way that you probably did you don't have to

[39:48] find yourself right like you can just send the emails you'd be able to do that in like a week

[39:53] or two weeks if you want to spread it out it's like not a lot you know we'll give you

[39:57] you that we'll give you the weekends off so we'll go so it's 40 emails a day

[40:01] 40 emails I'll give it to you in a month how about that so we'll do 20 emails a day

[40:05] that feels like that feels reasonable yeah okay cool let's do that best place to like pull

[40:11] the data good question because I think it's the matchmakers but it's also could be executive coaches

[40:18] could be high-end fitness trainers people going through a transformation weight loss weight

[40:24] yep they need they need yeah for sure I would think about I think you have the these in

[40:29] segments right and so you've got high-end trainers high-end PT's number one you've got exact

[40:35] coach right you've got the dating people right yep you've got I'll give you one divorce attorneys

[40:48] so that's for list these ones you can find probably from Google this you can find also from

[40:53] search and Instagram there's also like list brokers so you just like Google this broker

[40:58] whatever city and then you can usually they'll have this massive national list and then you can

[41:01] will let it down to a localized area can you do any remote services yeah yeah we definitely

[41:08] let's say 50% up like especially during COVID we only work virtually but I I prefer

[41:15] prefer versus that's fine that's cool I like doing this stuff in person because there's there's

[41:18] so much more richness to the interaction I can see someone's where I can see I can see

[41:23] minor expression changes and I can gauge how my you know recommendations like are they confused

[41:27] by what I said or like are they I can I can sense if they're like not they don't want to push back

[41:31] because they're like they don't want to salt me or something like that but I can see if they're like

[41:33] they don't really believe it it's okay I need to dive in here more and make sure that I can

[41:36] break any belief that's here or maybe explain something a little bit differently I don't think

[41:40] I get as much of that online or in like a zoom setting and honestly I just like I mean I love

[41:44] business and I think that when I have like kind of the talking head videos there's plenty of

[41:48] the on this channel I am a little bit more intense in those settings because I'm when I talk to a

[41:53] camera and there's no one else there I'm basically talking to myself and I talked to myself a little

[41:57] bit more rough than I would talk to somebody else and so I think in this setting you can see that

[42:02] like I don't know like I'm pro entrepreneur you know what I mean like it doesn't matter whether

[42:06] you're making a hundred thousand dollars a year or you're making a hundred million dollars a year like

[42:08] you're in the game and for that you're eternally somebody that I you had my respect okay

[42:14] so this obviously makes money and doesn't require any financial risk yeah and is also a

[42:21] compounding way of acquiring customers because you did this work think about this you sent 40

[42:25] emails one time and then you got six people to send you business for good not bad now what do you

[42:32] do to continue to react to it them host events okay so you do you do you do events okay so for the

[42:38] affiliates yeah okay cool I mean like especially for like the matchmakers they're happy because

[42:44] their clients are getting made over they get better pictures therefore they get better matches so

[42:50] I love that yeah really good so I think do you do that like regularly like it's on a calendar

[42:55] or it's just like okay good because that's obviously that's why part of my work because they're

[42:59] normally one of the things that that falls off of the affiliates is that they don't stay activated they

[43:03] don't keep referring you and so you have to like work them like customers like it's another

[43:06] set of relationships but if you can put them all together in event on regular cadence we're like

[43:10] all of the dating coaches bring all of their people and they all look good and they all get to

[43:13] me and each other like that's value for everybody it hasn't quite turned out like that okay but just like

[43:19] more one off okay like hosting events with just individual company okay well still that works yeah

[43:25] yeah and I think if you do like one or two of those a year or three of those a year I think that's like

[43:28] more than enough to keep that right well to me and I would I would try and figure out a way to

[43:33] put them in the same room just because I think you'd be like I would be pitching on collaboration rather

[43:37] than competition which is just like hey you have single people so do that maybe that's true actually yeah

[43:42] they're all single yeah they're all single and obviously looking to mingle and I look at their

[43:46] best life like it also be desperation city but anyways so that's let's see if they piece okay I

[43:52] feel I feel really good about that okay and so in terms of lists I'll go list brokers and then

[43:57] I'll sort sort social media and Google first that'd be like my first thing and then I'll look at

[44:01] list brokers once I ran out of that okay but between like these four sources you need to send

[44:05] 400 emails it's not that bad and then what's crazy is like if you send it and then they don't respond

[44:11] you can send it again okay next one's continuity so let's talk about that okay so this is about

[44:19] increasing LTV right so you already have pretty good LTV but I have this feeling like there's

[44:24] something that we can do better okay so right now LTV is $10,000 right okay so walk me through so

[44:34] someone comes in so I come in I'm see 8500 dollars I pay you for my whole lookbook etc

[44:40] transformation yep okay and so the delivery of that transformation is like a lookbook primarily

[44:45] and then like yeah walk me through out a little more no so this assessment figuring out where we're

[44:51] gonna go with your style you're look then going through your current closet getting rid of all the

[44:56] old stuff you actually go to their house okay get rid of all the old stuff reorganize the closet so

[45:02] that it makes it works for their life okay so closet tear down yep and then we document

[45:07] we do an inventory of everything in their closet so that way when they text us or they say hey I'm

[45:12] going to Turks and Kicos hey great pull this pull this pull this pull this and we can give it to their

[45:18] housekeeper or whatever here's your packing list okay then we get new outfits new clothes

[45:25] right now our promise is about five to ten new outfits okay we don't want to get the whole new wardrobe

[45:30] right but you know enough to like okay I'm excited I feel good and then that's when we make the

[45:37] determination okay does this make sense giving your lifestyle you travel all the time on a monthly

[45:42] level or accordingly level yeah in terms of the continuity you mean well do you have

[45:46] turn on the continuity do you a lot of people so people stay and they keep paying if it's in front

[45:51] of these people not the one-time people these people they don't it was the one-time thing so it was

[45:56] priced at 3500 and you just did this but then didn't have anything else yeah and it was um it could be

[46:02] all virtually okay or it could just be like a one-day shopping a better do a person it's a different

[46:07] relationship yeah yeah I like that I'm a fan okay so and then the ongoing price point is what

[46:12] on the back end uh two-key per month or four five hundred so LC so of eighty five hundred and then

[46:20] two thousand dollars per month so L so we should be at now I'm guessing that you have a lot of

[46:24] grandfathers people of those forty customers that are paying less than yeah okay what are they paying

[46:29] um 1500 monthly yep week or month okay so it's like wow okay and then uh some are on like

[46:39] 1500 quarterly okay got it got and we're guessing the majority number of 1500 quarterly yeah okay got it

[46:46] because then it's 500 bucks a month because this is just all transitioned in September god

[46:50] feeling like two people currently on the new system okay so most people are 1500 dollars so if you

[46:56] have call it 38 customers who are at I'm just gonna say in general right five hundred dollars per month

[47:02] because it's 1500 per quarter I'm just gonna get it revenue okay because this now makes sense with the revenue

[47:08] okay cool so the vast majority of the money is actually in a recurring revenue base mm-hmm that's

[47:13] bad that's good yeah that's really good and it turns love it's all that stuff's good okay so I actually

[47:17] don't really want to mess with this that much because you have a low-churn what's the percentage

[47:21] people go from here to here now that I've just said hey we're only working with you on a reoccurring

[47:25] basis it's it's it's good um the thing is I'm almost wondering if I could say that yeah good

[47:32] I'm almost wondering if we kill this and just do the quarterly because this seems to be

[47:38] not most people okay do you think that it's better to simplify things or just still keep it

[47:43] no I think you can have it what happens is serves as a price anchor okay so even if only 10

[47:47] percent of people take it it increases the people who take that one so I don't think it's actually a

[47:51] mistake that it's there because if you're like because they have the reaction I did I'm like 6,000

[47:55] a quarter my Jesus like or just do 1500 like oh no that works I'll do the 1500 oh no no it's 2k a month

[48:01] or 4,500 a quarter with this one yes okay so you're saying at the at the new price point yes

[48:09] it's at this okay but this is brand new and here you have all the retention that you have so I

[48:14] do vent you her continuity because there's oftentimes a lot of opportunity here in terms of billing

[48:19] cycles in terms of pricing in terms of ascension process to get more people to go from front

[48:24] and back and most of her stuff here was working and I'm trying to be mindful of the fact that she's

[48:28] she's the very small business and she has limited resources limited time limited capital and so

[48:33] I want to be really selective about the things that I recommend that she do and in what order so that

[48:39] we select the things that the highest likelihood of working that have the lowest you know initial

[48:44] cost and time and effort to make a happen even though I probably saw some opportunities here that

[48:49] I think we could exploit later for now it was like this is good enough to scale we'll deal with it later

[48:55] once we achieve more volume and then we'll have more data that can make get that can inform our decisions

[48:59] even better and most importantly we'll have the resources and the cash flow to be able to enact

[49:03] those changes without overwhelming actually yeah okay but you haven't had any issue ascending people

[49:07] into that into the 4500 dollars a quarter either I mean the few that we'd had enough but it's the same take

[49:12] rate okay yeah so I'm fine with quarterly billing so if you have monthly quarterly that's fine

[49:17] I'm good with that yeah so if it's now to give more slash 4500 per quarter

[49:25] but even if like 90% opt into this versus this that's fine totally fine totally fine that's great

[49:30] no big deal yeah all that I mean honestly we'll just like like I feel comfortable with that but I always let

[49:36] the market tell me so like I just keep adding up the price until people stop saying yes and then I'm like

[49:41] okay that's about right and then you can back down a little bit you're like that's my price now I know

[49:44] that for these for these types of people that's the number that they're willing to pay the

[49:48] unless we change the avatar the marketing and the messaging that's gonna track these people and

[49:52] they're willing to say asset that price okay so from continuity perspective I don't think we

[49:55] change that so then we just change that so that stays the way it is I think the $8500

[50:00] I know that's the best 10,000 but $8500 for the tear down and then you have the quarterly and so

[50:04] this LTV that you have here is probably gonna go out and I'll just keep going up what we're talking

[50:08] okay great so I mean honestly the so the good news is the actual business is strong okay

[50:14] so you have good-ish margins 42% continuity has almost no turn that's great LTV hacks strong

[50:22] and so the real leverage with this business is that we just need to do more all right so

[50:29] this is this is gonna be the priorities in terms of how we're gonna do this all right now you

[50:34] stop spending money on that why because we were adding the video and we were adding in

[50:39] your fixing that stuff first and then okay cool so this is what we're gonna do so video sales letter

[50:45] plus lead magnet

[51:03] so plus the bit qualification so budget authority need timing plus skin tone color

[51:12] analysis personalization yeah okay cool so that's number one so once we fix that that's a

[51:19] conversion mechanism so then what I want you to do is increase your addspend and so currently you're

[51:26] spending 600 was it $300 a month so what do we just go to 600 how much actually let me ask

[51:33] the question how many can you handle like how many more leads could you handle then you currently are

[51:37] more like how many more like that can we're in a new clients yeah well like how many calls

[51:43] basically it's a call thanks when it calls can you take you're currently taking 12 right yeah easily

[51:49] could double or triple that okay so let's go with 600 and 900 per month because sometimes the lead

[51:55] pass might go up a little bit that's okay just like so basically you might get a little bit less

[51:59] efficient but that's fine because you're still you have really strong team to catch so it's not a video

[52:03] all right number three is we need to send the 20 emails per day to fillets

[52:17] plus one event for quarter to keep them activated bus for affiliate types that we went over

[52:29] all right so this is a big three so the reason that I put it in this order is that she was already

[52:34] working on the video sales letter and so it didn't meet like I wasn't really going to change

[52:38] and even she was already doing so it's basically like go put this in place and just add the lead

[52:42] negative which is really just like you know you put a PDF together it's an afternoon and you

[52:46] change the headline on page that's not a huge lift there increasing the addspend is literally

[52:50] clicking a button so the first two things are part basically no effort maybe a half day of work

[52:55] maybe one day total that could in of themselves double triple the business then it's like okay

[53:00] the next big lever which is the affiliate play is to then let's 10x the affiliates that we have

[53:06] using the tried true channel you already are doing and just do way more of it but that requires work

[53:10] and focus and effort she has to google people she has to find them and just to reach out she's

[53:14] a personalized those responses it's not going to take more time and so I wanted to just knock out quick

[53:18] wins that she could just do with a click of a button in a day before getting to the kind of like

[53:21] the more media things that might take a few weeks and then I don't want to mess with the continuity

[53:25] so those are the like so if we're looking at like how much could this do it's like okay here we have

[53:29] a two to three x here actually it might do this because Michael asked me to do this so we've got a

[53:35] two to three x here that we have from this guy I think this if I knew what the conversion rate

[53:43] was on your page so if you sold can you go back to the yeah okay so here so you got eight sales

[53:51] this year so it's like one like a little bit less than one a month right so I just wish I knew

[53:57] how many leads were coming from google I just really wish I knew that number and those eight

[54:02] sales were those just like phone calls and closed us over 16 calls created eight sales kind of thing

[54:07] yeah okay so and they weren't from the ads they were from search Ghana but then they clicked on your

[54:15] ad because you got totally I don't even know if they clicked on the ad okay so we're also going to do

[54:21] this before we put in the ads but so 1.5 so this is 1.5 we need to get attribution track okay

[54:32] because we have to know like the first step of running ads is no it happens otherwise you're just

[54:38] spending money in the dark so obviously I think you're you're getting a return by accident rather

[54:42] than on purpose and so let's get the attribution tracking in place so this is gonna go

[54:47] show let's use blue this will go up here all right so you'll fix the funnel

[54:55] yep you with the attribution tracking in place I think the funnel lift could very well like this is

[55:02] gonna sound wild this could somewhere they would have like 2 to 5x the lead for you just doing this

[55:08] especially with a good lead magnet okay now the next piece is that each of your affiliates were a third of

[55:14] your revenue and if we were to 10x that then we would 10x one third which would be a triple if we did this

[55:21] and so the result of a called a 2x the 2x and a 3x would be a 12x which would take us from

[55:30] 300k per year to the 3.6 million great well in our way try it yes thank you oh you're good

[55:42] you're gonna crush it so actually was amazing I'm super stoked to see how this depends

[55:46] after in the next 6 to 12 months and you know see how her numbers go I'm very bullish on it I think

[55:50] she's great if you like this type of content of actually diving into real business owners real

[55:54] stories I personally love to making this I prefer making this type of content but if you guys like this

[55:59] tile please let me know I'll probably end up just making more anyways because I don't like but

[56:03] either right let me know and then it'll make me feel better about making more effort

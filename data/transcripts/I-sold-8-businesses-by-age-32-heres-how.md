[00:00] In this video, I'm going to talk to you about how to sell a business.

[00:02] And if you're wondering who is this dude in his mom's basements closet wearing a wife

[00:07] Peter, have anything to do with talking about how to sell business, how does he even have

[00:10] the right the audacity to talk about these things?

[00:13] Let me first make a quick intro.

[00:14] I've sold eight businesses.

[00:15] My name is Alex from as the ionacquisition.com, which is a portfolio of companies that does

[00:19] over $100 million a year.

[00:21] Make these videos because I was once broke and worthy speeders out of necessity, rather than out of

[00:25] choice.

[00:25] And was in my mom's basement out of necessity, rather than actually I'm not an businessman.

[00:29] This is a $5 million condo in Vegas, but that's not the point.

[00:31] I just like working in places that have no windows.

[00:34] So I have sold eight businesses over my career just to name a few of them.

[00:38] I sold Allen, which is a software company that did 12 million in trailing 12

[00:43] months sales.

[00:43] I cannot disclose the price that I sold to.

[00:45] But that was the top line revenue.

[00:47] The NDA is actually fairly common in sales agreements, especially in an appreciable amount of

[00:51] money.

[00:52] And the reason for that is because they don't want a potential new acquireer in terms of

[00:56] if you were to roll in other companies after they buy your company to know what you got

[01:00] for yours because then it hurts their negotiating power.

[01:02] Now, that being said, the next two companies that I sold in 2021, I sold for $46.2 million.

[01:07] And I was able to do that because I negotiated that in because I was tired of not being

[01:10] going to talk to the other one.

[01:11] And so there's the press release from that on top of that.

[01:13] And I'm like, well, I don't have businesses that big.

[01:15] That's okay.

[01:16] Fear not.

[01:17] I also sold five brick and mortar locations prior to this.

[01:20] And so I've sold actually that seven.

[01:22] I don't know why I said eight.

[01:22] I shut down one.

[01:23] There's the other one.

[01:24] There you go.

[01:25] I had fiberg mortar locations that I sold and here's what's even cooler.

[01:29] I've actually sold those businesses to six different types of buyers.

[01:31] I sold to financial buyers or private equity.

[01:33] I sold to an and family offices.

[01:35] That's what FOS or private equity or family offices, which is all forms of private equity.

[01:39] But institutional buyers or family offices.

[01:41] Second, I bought I sold two strategic buyers, which is the one who bought my self-recomedy.

[01:46] I sold to friends.

[01:47] I've sold to competitors.

[01:48] I've sold to customers and I've sold to partners.

[01:50] All right.

[01:51] So I've done a lot of these deals and interestingly enough, as it was going on, I never thought,

[01:55] wow, this is someday going to come in handy in that I can help other people go through this as well,

[01:59] because I've gone through all these kind of weird scenarios.

[02:01] All right.

[02:01] And so I've learned a lot in the process and I would like to make this because I get questions all the time

[02:06] about value in companies and buying companies and we have companies that reach out to us.

[02:11] So for acquisition.com, we work with specifically service-based companies, especially internet,

[02:15] service-based businesses, guru businesses, e-learning businesses, course-business, et cetera.

[02:18] We purchase minority stakes in this companies to help grow them, which is what the portfolio does.

[02:22] Now, which is why it does over 100 million.

[02:24] That being said, we're very familiar with this process.

[02:26] And so I wanted to walk you through this.

[02:27] There's a lot of people have questions about it.

[02:28] And so I'll walk you through the overarching process and then I'll dive into each of them in more detail.

[02:32] So, good.

[02:33] Awesome.

[02:34] So phase zero zero is the prerequisite.

[02:36] These are these things that must be done or even even a required for you to be able to sell

[02:41] or have any kind of enterprise value to begin with, which I'm going to be really weird with you.

[02:44] Most companies, most businesses are not valuable at all.

[02:48] All right.

[02:48] Most of them are just assets.

[02:49] You might have equipment.

[02:50] You know, if you're a physical presence and if you're an online business, you very little value

[02:53] unless you have a lot of these things in place.

[02:56] All right.

[02:57] So, most people want to try and go and business sell their business and find out that no one

[02:59] actually wants to buy it because people are not stupid.

[03:01] All right.

[03:02] So, next is, once you have these prerequisites or talk over, you have to find a banker or

[03:06] broker.

[03:07] All right.

[03:08] And this is something that I've gone back and forth on.

[03:09] I sold some of them without.

[03:10] I sold some of them with.

[03:11] I'll go pros and cons and I'll explain to you kind of how to negotiate that process and figure

[03:14] it out.

[03:15] After that, now we can actually start the selling process.

[03:17] We have a bank where if somebody representing us to help us go sell our stuff.

[03:19] All right.

[03:20] And so this is the prep.

[03:21] This is phase one.

[03:23] Phase two is now that we have prepared all this stuff.

[03:25] Now we go market the thing so that we can sell the thing to somebody.

[03:28] All right.

[03:28] Phase three is now that we have people who want to buy the thing.

[03:30] Now we've got to close the deal.

[03:31] All right.

[03:32] And so I'll walk you through each of the intricacies of these and there are honestly a lot

[03:35] of steps in this process.

[03:36] If you want to have a big number money in the millions for a deal.

[03:40] All right.

[03:41] So, let's start at the top.

[03:43] All right.

[03:44] Pre-requisite.

[03:45] So these are deal killers.

[03:46] These are things that make a deal not actually happen, which I'll be row through is the

[03:49] vast majority of the time.

[03:50] Most companies are not that big.

[03:51] And when I say this, mind you.

[03:53] I'm talking about institutional sized businesses.

[03:56] So if you want to have a deal that's five million dollars plus, which is about the smallest

[04:00] deal that any like real institutional investor private equity family office will look at,

[04:05] is there has to be a big enough size for it to make sense.

[04:08] Right now you can have tons of people who do a lot of private investors and retail investors,

[04:14] people who just have a little bit of money saved up, they might want to buy a dry cleaning

[04:17] business.

[04:18] They might want to buy a GM or they might want to buy a whatever.

[04:21] All right.

[04:22] Like those are normal businesses, but those are, that's not what we're talking about here,

[04:24] because those are all one off and they're not going to make you rich.

[04:27] All right.

[04:28] And so that's why I'm focused on the how to make you rich type sale.

[04:31] Because these are much more difficult to understand and the process a little bit more nuanced.

[04:35] All right.

[04:36] It took me a long time to learn this.

[04:37] And guess what?

[04:38] No one taught me this.

[04:39] I didn't see this anywhere and it took me a long, long time.

[04:41] It took me a year to just kind of understand how the entire process worked and did.

[04:44] So that is what I'm trying to save you is a year of painstaking effort for me.

[04:47] And I don't know who you are.

[04:48] So I'm making this so that there you go.

[04:51] All right.

[04:52] So the biggest one though is that people are too small.

[04:54] The next one is that there's a customer concentration.

[04:56] Meaning you have two few customers that equate to the business.

[04:59] Right?

[05:00] If you have like 10 big customers, if two of them leave or three of them leave, all of a sudden

[05:03] you lose like a 30 year business, that is very risky.

[05:05] All right.

[05:06] People don't like that.

[05:07] And so they will give you a massive discount on the value of business or not even be

[05:09] interested because it's too risky.

[05:10] And especially if that's like those relationships are there because of you and they, you know,

[05:13] they like you and you're the kind of like relationship manager, which happens really commonly

[05:16] in small businesses.

[05:18] Next one is no to find sales process.

[05:19] A lot of times people don't really have an acquisition process for getting new customers.

[05:22] They don't know how they get customers.

[05:23] They just kind of come their way.

[05:24] And so if you don't have a repeatable or reliable way of acquiring customers, ideally through

[05:27] multiple channels which are covered in a second, you will probably not get a very good

[05:30] multiple or even want to get any kind of deal at all.

[05:32] Next is that when people do start this process, a lot of the mistakes that they make

[05:36] because they don't go through enough potential cars.

[05:38] They're not trying to target a people.

[05:39] They're like, I talked to 10 people and no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no shit.

[05:41] You talk to 10 people.

[05:42] We've got to talk to 500.

[05:43] Right?

[05:43] And that's how you can get somebody who's going to give you the right kind of multiple

[05:47] on your business if you want to sell to an institutional investor.

[05:50] Next was getting timing wrong.

[05:51] So everybody always thinks that like, man, if I said another 18 months, I cannot tell you

[05:54] the amount of times.

[05:55] Like, it's almost like the standard response much, but it's obvious that they're

[05:59] already an 18 months because a year, they know they're not ready.

[06:02] But 18 months for some reason feels like it's far enough out that they'll somehow magically

[06:05] have way of their one and all their problems will be done.

[06:07] Which is not true.

[06:08] All right.

[06:09] So, getting the timing wrong is a huge issue and a lot of people sell to late.

[06:12] Very few people sell to early.

[06:14] Most people sell to late in my opinion.

[06:16] And in so doing, they can't sell it all.

[06:18] And so the thing is, I heard this quote from the the managing partner of APG, Fraser

[06:22] Preston, really, really bright guy.

[06:24] He said this one for Carl.

[06:25] She said, well, business is always going to go up in value over time, except when it doesn't.

[06:30] And in case it becomes unsalable.

[06:31] And so it was very, very interesting to hear that because that is kind of the truth.

[06:34] It's like, either people see this thing as like, oh, wow, this is a growing asset that's

[06:37] increasing in value.

[06:38] And even if you stay the same for a period of time, just more years under your belt makes

[06:42] it actually more reliable.

[06:43] So it's less risky.

[06:44] So literally the older a business gets, even if it stays the same, it becomes more valuable.

[06:48] Right?

[06:49] That being said, if you get the timing wrong, as in it starts going down, no one wants to catch

[06:53] a falling knife, all right, especially in private deals like this.

[06:56] Stocks and whatnot, people are trying time.

[06:57] It's a big enough company.

[06:58] It's been around long enough, et cetera.

[06:59] It's different than small businesses, which is what that's from jarred people who are

[07:03] watching this video have.

[07:04] Small business being defined as less than 100, I think, employees.

[07:06] Next one, you think it's worth more than it is.

[07:08] And this is a big one, right?

[07:10] A lot of people are like, man, I heard that, you know, so and so got 20 times

[07:14] top line.

[07:15] It's like, yeah, and that's because that's why it's newsworthy because it's weird.

[07:18] It's not common.

[07:19] If there's a complete sale, I think I just can't remember where I pulled this step from.

[07:22] The median number for M&A deals for this was for $5 million plus deals, I'm sorry,

[07:29] can't remember what the median was.

[07:30] Shoot, I think the median was $5 million, I can't.

[07:32] Screw that.

[07:33] The point is that the multiple was 6.7 times trailing 12 months.

[07:37] And that is for institutional buyers, right?

[07:39] Now you might not have an institutional buyer, which is why the vast majority of businesses

[07:42] get sold get sold in private deals for like 1x, 2x, 3x.

[07:46] And it's because they're not really reliable businesses.

[07:47] For the most part, they're just kind of asset sales.

[07:49] Like I'm handing, you know, a handful of employees over with some kind of working model

[07:53] and I'm just moving on to do other things, which is honestly the vast majority of businesses

[07:56] that get sold get sold from is nothing.

[07:58] All right, so we hear about the big wins, but that's not the majority.

[08:01] All right, so I want to be clear in that most businesses either don't get sold or get

[08:05] sold for very, very little money.

[08:07] And so the point of this presentation is how to sell it for a lot of money.

[08:10] All right, which you have to meet these requirements to even be considered.

[08:12] Okay?

[08:13] The next little due dad that we have on our list listicle here is not growing big enough

[08:20] to ham or growth stress, which is three different things I put in one books I needed

[08:22] to fit in one place.

[08:23] All right, so if the business isn't growing, you're going to get a big discount on it.

[08:26] Now I said earlier that the longer businesses in place, the more variables which is true.

[08:30] But if you're not growing, you don't have to like a ways of growing it or it means

[08:32] that like the strategy you're doing is no longer working, people will see that as a risk.

[08:35] So if you have even a tiny amount of decline, people will see that as a big red flag

[08:39] because then they'll extrapolate that into infinity.

[08:41] On the flip side, if you have a tiny amount of growth, people do extrapolate that out further.

[08:44] So like flip it around and sustain that growth for 12 months, 18 months prior to the deal

[08:50] to get a much better number.

[08:51] Big enough, ham.

[08:52] So people might think, oh, this is this business is cool.

[08:55] It's an inch, but it can't expand beyond this niche.

[08:57] So you need to have a good growth story as in how are we going to really ten X this thing?

[09:01] Because people are buying not to buy your business.

[09:03] They're buying your business for what they think the business will become.

[09:06] All right, that's what kind of private economies all about.

[09:08] And once really trying to buy the thing, they want to try to buy with things would have

[09:10] become.

[09:11] And so that's when you make great deals, right?

[09:13] That's on their side.

[09:14] So you have to tell them or explain to them the story of how it's going to work.

[09:17] And the more they can believe that story that it's likely to occur, then the more valuable

[09:20] your business will become.

[09:22] The next one, this is a huge one for small businesses, Kim and Rask.

[09:24] As in like, are you the one who's the rainmaker, you the one who's bringing in all the

[09:28] deals, or you the one who's the special man who does all the fulfillment, all that kind of stuff.

[09:33] Like, are people coming for you?

[09:34] If they're coming for you, then they're not going to come for your business, which means

[09:35] that when you leave, the business is worthless.

[09:38] And so you're a big risk.

[09:39] And a lot of times, this is, I'll be offering with you in Acresus.com, we work with companies

[09:44] that have key man, and we work them over the next three or five years to help them not

[09:47] have key man risk, which is how we were able to exit Jim launch, which was started as kind

[09:51] of a more guru-esque business, and then transformed into just a true business licensing business

[09:57] at an enterprise level.

[09:59] And so there is a process of getting through that, and you have to take the time to do it

[10:02] if you don't, your business will not be valuable.

[10:05] And then finally, and there's more risks.

[10:07] These are just some of the big ones.

[10:08] A single channel dependence, meaning you only have one way of getting customers, you have

[10:11] another way, and if tomorrow that chart off, you be screwed.

[10:14] People just imagine, well, if it chart off the nine of these by money and good investors don't

[10:17] take risks like that, they don't want to go to zero.

[10:20] And so that will massively impact the value of your business.

[10:23] All right, so these are deal killers.

[10:24] These are things that can't get you to not sell or sell for very, very little money.

[10:26] And so you must check off these boxes before you can get big institutional money.

[10:30] All right, so this is the big bottom line of that section, which is enterprise value is a

[10:34] discount applied to future sales to future sales, which means you have to take the total

[10:40] amount of sales that a business takes between now and the end of time, and then you apply

[10:43] a discount to it, which basically means risk.

[10:45] What's the likelihood that it occurs?

[10:47] All right, and so if you can show that you have a lot of future sales are going to happen,

[10:50] and it's very, very likely that they're going to occur, then you have a very, very valuable

[10:54] business.

[10:55] If you have a small amount of future sales or a declining amount of sales, then the

[10:58] likely that it happens as low, and the amount is also low.

[11:01] All right, so that gives you low enterprise value.

[11:03] So that's the bottom line.

[11:04] That's what we want to show is we want to show that we're going to make lots of sales,

[11:06] if you continue to grow, and the likelihood of occurring is very, very high.

[11:09] They should be asking you, why are you selling this business and you need to have a good

[11:11] reason for it?

[11:12] So check off that box.

[11:14] Let's go to Phase 2.

[11:15] Let's see, you check all those boxes and you're like, okay, I think I have all those things.

[11:18] I now want to find a banker or broker.

[11:20] And quick difference here, bankers are what you're going to need to sell to an institutional

[11:24] for the most part.

[11:25] Brokers are usually when you're selling for less than 5 million.

[11:28] You get a broker and they have different fee structures because the amounts are lower and they

[11:32] have to do more deals like that.

[11:34] And to be fair, I think sometimes being a broker is even harder because you're selling

[11:38] shit.

[11:39] Let's be real.

[11:40] Okay, so the way that I did this and so I'm just being real, like the way that I did this

[11:44] is that I network for introverts.

[11:45] It's very hard.

[11:46] I think you can try it, go Google investment banks, Google Top, whatever investment banks.

[11:50] And specifically, you want them in your market and your size.

[11:55] So there's two components.

[11:56] Do they have the sold, some businesses have the sold, e-commerce businesses, have the

[12:00] sold, software businesses, have the sold e-learning businesses, have the sold whatever

[12:03] type of business you have, number one, and there are two of these sold them of your size.

[12:07] If someone has sold lots of e-commerce but they've only done deals that are like 500

[12:10] million up and you're doing like 10 million top line, you're not going to be a fit for them.

[12:14] Because the buyers that they already know are not going to want to buy your thing because

[12:19] they're checking too small.

[12:21] And so these guys right, are proportion to the fund size that they have of the capital.

[12:26] If you have a billion dollars, you're not going to make a thousand dollar investment.

[12:28] It just doesn't make sense.

[12:29] The time investment makes no sense.

[12:31] So I use my network, which means I just called everybody I possibly knew and said, hey,

[12:35] do you know anybody who knows anything about this?

[12:38] And so you can start with entrepreneurs, you can start with people, you can start with

[12:41] your actual bank where you go, like actually to do banking and you just pull threads.

[12:46] And this is what took me a long time, which is why I make this video to hopefully save you

[12:49] guys some time.

[12:50] Is that like networking to try and find these introductions was a pain.

[12:53] I didn't, I don't know anybody.

[12:54] You know what I mean?

[12:55] I was in born into an investment bank, so I have no clue.

[12:57] And so you network for introductions to these banks.

[12:59] Okay, once you have that, that some introductions, right?

[13:04] You then give them a one page summary document.

[13:06] You send them because they'll be like, okay, well, send me a teaser, right?

[13:10] It's like a sizzle, sizzle page of like all the sexy things about your business.

[13:14] The assets, your lists, how you, you know, it's just literally a one page summary that

[13:17] should look really sexy as I'm looking at and be like, I would like to take another call

[13:20] of these people.

[13:21] That's it.

[13:22] That's the objective.

[13:23] Just to get them to say, yes, I'll take a call of you.

[13:25] Once they say, yes, I'd like to take a call with you, you then basically sell them

[13:29] on selling your business.

[13:31] All right?

[13:32] So you sell them on selling your business.

[13:34] And then if they do like that, they will usually fly out to you and meet with you in

[13:38] person with the team and then they will sell you on why they should sell your business.

[13:42] And so the process here goes like, you network for as many introductions you can to

[13:45] bankers who are relevant to your size in your space.

[13:48] You send them the one page teaser so that you can get them interested.

[13:52] They then a certain percentage of those will take a phone call.

[13:55] Other phone call, you sell those people on why it's a good deal.

[13:57] They will then fall with you and say, yes, I think it's a good deal.

[13:59] Let's talk in person.

[14:01] You'll then probably meet with, you know, four to six bankers to tell you why they think

[14:06] they would be the best ones to represent you and get you the highest enterprise value.

[14:09] And that's where you're going to negotiate their fee structure and you're going to be

[14:12] asking them questions around what other deals like yours they have sold and what their

[14:16] network looks like.

[14:17] Now they're all going to say they know all the people and all the decision makers and all

[14:19] the things.

[14:20] The real thing you want is people who have sold businesses similar to yours in terms

[14:23] of market and size in recent history.

[14:26] All right, because that means that they are, it's recent.

[14:29] They're in the know.

[14:30] It's not like they sold something three years ago that was similar because they're way

[14:32] out of, way out of touch.

[14:33] All right, you want people who do this type of deal all the time.

[14:36] Now the typical fee structures would ask what to watch out for.

[14:38] So the, their fees and agreements, they usually have an upfront amount.

[14:42] Sometimes that's all these things are negotiable.

[14:43] You can negotiate that out, you can negotiate it in.

[14:45] They usually will ask for upfront if the number is lower.

[14:48] So if they don't think that it's likely that they're going to sell, they'll ask for an

[14:51] upfront, which you can use a negotiating point, which is like, do you don't think you can

[14:55] sell it because then it gives you a point to argue back to somebody else, right?

[14:58] They'll give you targets for what they think they get self-for, and then they will give

[15:02] you ratchet, which is like, and if we suffer over X, we get X% and we suffer over Y, we

[15:06] get Z%.

[15:07] Well, bankers will actually do is once they will help you package the business and they will

[15:10] go out to market and they will pound the pavement and they will talk to hundreds of buyers

[15:15] and they will walk you through this process.

[15:16] So it's good to have an understanding of this process by and large so that you can not

[15:20] sound like an income poop when you're talking to them.

[15:22] All right, there's usually also a breakup fee which you can negotiate out of the deal or

[15:26] at least decrease it.

[15:28] And you can also, on the flip side, have minimums, which is like, if you guys don't sell

[15:31] me, if you don't get an offer above X, then you don't get paid at all, right?

[15:35] And so we had minimums in our deals so that they wouldn't actually get paid.

[15:38] So they're super incentivized.

[15:39] So the things that like, you really want to be cognizant of is the minimums, and especially

[15:46] how they're going to get paid, like what number they're getting paid off?

[15:48] Are they getting paid off the total enterprise value?

[15:49] Are they going to get paid off the cash you receive?

[15:51] Right?

[15:52] And you want to go cheat off the cash you receive, not the enterprise value, because let's say

[15:54] you sell 10% of the company for a billion dollars.

[15:57] All right, I'm saying for, you know, silly math.

[15:59] So you get a hundred million bucks.

[16:01] If let's say they got 4% of enterprise value, right?

[16:03] They would get 40 million of the hundred million.

[16:05] All right.

[16:06] So there's little things like this that they will use to fuck you.

[16:08] All right.

[16:09] So like, be cognizant of these things.

[16:11] And the targets and the ratchets that they put in place, it sounds like it's, you want them

[16:16] to be really excited to push it, but the things that I really would want you to pay

[16:19] it's into, are going to be the minimums and what they're getting paid off of.

[16:22] And break up fees and upfronts.

[16:23] All right, because at the end of the day, you know, the ratchets and targets, hopefully you're

[16:26] happy with this on the front end, because what happens sometimes is the reverse, which

[16:29] is people as all of a sudden start hearing the L.O.Ys and whatnot and start getting greedy.

[16:34] And I don't think that's why it's like, decide right down a number before you start the

[16:37] process and talking to all these guys, because they'll blow your mind up and they'll

[16:40] tell you that you're going to sell for a billion dollars and then you sell for a notably

[16:42] dollars.

[16:43] Okay, for much less less than that.

[16:44] So right down the number, right, it's to a lot out of your self and say, I would accept

[16:47] this for this reason.

[16:48] All right, because this is one of the most emotional processes you can possibly go through

[16:51] selling a part of your self, selling part of your identity, and so you can get tied up in it.

[16:55] Okay?

[16:56] Now, you will sell your company better than almost any banker, right?

[17:00] So they're going to be experts in the process.

[17:02] You will be the one who's going to be an expert at selling your company, especially if you're

[17:05] a promotional entrepreneur, you know how to sell, right?

[17:08] And so you want to be very instrumental in giving them the selling store because they're

[17:12] going to be the ones who are doing the selling, but you're also going to be doing selling as

[17:15] well.

[17:16] So you need to be giving them the selling points.

[17:19] You think that they're going to say that they're experts at this, they're not, like

[17:22] even though they've sold a handful of companies, they've only sold a handful, right?

[17:24] They're just so five like yours.

[17:25] That's still a ton, just like yours, but you want to have the really selling points that

[17:28] only you will know because they don't know your business, right?

[17:30] You got to give them the really sexy stuff, right?

[17:33] And as a reminder, these people are like real estate agents.

[17:36] They're trying to sell both sides.

[17:37] They're trying to get a deal done more than the best deal, even though they have ratchets,

[17:40] even though they have these things, the big thing they're trying not to do is not close

[17:44] a deal.

[17:45] And so they will do everything they can to get both sides to just meet in the middle and

[17:48] sell, but that's not necessarily in your best interest, okay?

[17:50] So just remind you here, it's not necessarily your best interest.

[17:53] All right.

[17:54] Now, this was the false belief that I had, which is they will know what they're doing and

[17:58] we'll get you the best deal, which is not true, which I just explained this.

[18:01] And so this is the negotiating point.

[18:02] This is a writer down here for you.

[18:04] They only responded and I had to learn this the hard way to if I don't get this point,

[18:10] the deal is off.

[18:12] Otherwise, they basically just steam roll you and you might say like, well, maybe you

[18:15] had bad banking experts who knows, but I'll just tell you, this is my experience is that

[18:19] you have to be willing to walk away from the table in order to get the best deal, all right?

[18:25] Which is why you win negotiations before you start them by having options.

[18:29] All right.

[18:30] You want to have an amazing business.

[18:31] You want to have a business you don't want to sell.

[18:32] That's the best way to sell a business.

[18:33] It's to not want to sell it, right?

[18:35] And you have to get there.

[18:36] And if you're like, I would just get rid of this thing for nothing, then prepare, be prepared,

[18:39] get rid of this thing for nothing because it's going to get there because they're going

[18:41] to drill you because these other professional negotiators on the other side of the table.

[18:44] This is what they do all day long.

[18:45] You might have sold your business one time.

[18:47] They buy businesses every fucking day.

[18:49] All right.

[18:50] So they know exactly how you feel and they know exactly how to manipulate your emotions to get

[18:52] you to say yes to lowest price.

[18:54] Okay?

[18:55] So what you want to say here is that if I don't get this, the deal is off.

[18:58] And it took me a really long time to learn this and then all of a sudden when I start speaking

[19:02] in this language, the beggar started responding and me like, oh no, this is really a big

[19:05] doff of them.

[19:06] If they don't get this and then all of a sudden, they start negotiating for me because

[19:08] we'll happen in this world of institutional, they just say no to everything.

[19:12] Unless you say you're going to walk, then they're like, okay, fine, we'll give you that one.

[19:16] Right?

[19:17] So they will just say this is our deal structure and unless you take your leave it, unless

[19:19] you say I'm willing to walk on these points.

[19:21] All right.

[19:22] And then they will start moving.

[19:23] Just my observation.

[19:24] Now, I'm telling you, I'm sharing this stuff because no one shared this with me.

[19:26] All right.

[19:27] So, we covered finding the banker, how to negotiate the fees, what to look at in terms of

[19:32] how to interface with them, two negotiators on your behalf.

[19:34] Now let's start the actual process.

[19:36] All right.

[19:37] And this is a big picture of what this whole process looks like.

[19:40] Once you've got audited financials, once you've got a sim which is a, I don't even know

[19:45] that it's something model, I think.

[19:48] But basically, it's like this 100 page plus thing of really in depth of the financials

[19:53] and the story and the competitive analysis and the marketplace and the growth

[19:55] trajectory and all the stuff.

[19:56] And that's what they should be doing for you.

[19:58] All right.

[19:58] They should make that thing.

[20:00] And they will send the teaser out to all the 500 people of those people, a certain

[20:07] percentage will sign NDAs, which is not just goes to agreements because then because it's anonymous.

[20:11] They won't, when you're sending out the teaser, it doesn't disclose what the company is.

[20:14] That way, you know, employees and things like that don't get scared by you just shopping

[20:18] the company.

[20:19] All right.

[20:20] So, this is how I recommend doing this.

[20:21] You have 500 buyers contacted and you don't want to ask these questions.

[20:24] How many buyers we're concentrating?

[20:25] How big is your list?

[20:26] What are your potential buyers, right?

[20:29] 98 NDAs from there, you'll usually get like 14 or so, IOS 15 percent, right?

[20:35] From there, about half of those, you'll do kind of like management presentations.

[20:39] From there, you'll get two to four LOS and IOS indication of interest, which is nonbinding.

[20:43] And LOS is also typically nonbinding, but it's a letter of interest, which is like, this

[20:49] is what we're prepared to pay for the business.

[20:51] From there, you negotiate them against each other and then you get one deal, right?

[20:54] And then you sign the LOS and then you go through the diligence process and then you close.

[20:58] Okay.

[20:59] That is how these sales numbers break down.

[21:00] If you've talked to 10 people, then loan behold, you probably are not going to get

[21:03] a good number.

[21:05] And so that's how this process works and things.

[21:06] A lot of these guys are lazy, so you have to push them on these numbers to send

[21:09] them more, like, repeat follow up with these people and I'll be honest with you.

[21:13] On the deal that we ended up doing, it wasn't the first set of buyers that we got to the

[21:17] table.

[21:18] It was actually somebody that my CFO pushed our bankers to follow back up with again, the

[21:22] ended up being the final acquires.

[21:24] All right.

[21:25] So, like, you want to push them because at the end of the day, they're going to try

[21:27] and do as little as possible to get paid.

[21:28] All right, I'm just being real with you.

[21:29] That's the real world.

[21:30] All right.

[21:31] So, let's do it.

[21:32] Now that we have no understanding of the sales process works, this is now you're working

[21:36] with the bankers.

[21:37] You got to get this prep stuff done.

[21:38] So, you got to get your due diligence in.

[21:39] You got to get organized.

[21:40] A lot of people don't have this stuff.

[21:42] Drifting the sim there.

[21:43] It is confidential information.

[21:44] Memorandum.

[21:45] All right.

[21:46] So, you got to complete that.

[21:47] Get a review that's a huge amount of work.

[21:48] All right.

[21:49] And these weeks are just rough.

[21:50] All right.

[21:51] These are rough amount of weeks.

[21:52] All right.

[21:53] I'm going to show you 20 weeks in this presentation, but like that whole pre-process of getting

[21:56] the bankers took another, like, three months.

[21:58] So, I would say, roughly, from the time you start this process, the time you get a

[22:02] checking your bank account is usually 12 to 18 months.

[22:05] All right.

[22:06] I'll say 12 is a nice, like, if you're like, if today you decided you wanted to buy,

[22:10] it would take a year before that actually you'd have a checking your bank account.

[22:14] All right.

[22:15] So, then they're going to put together the list of potential buyers or investors.

[22:18] Then they're going to have the summary fact sheet and the confidential, the NDA is agreed

[22:23] upon.

[22:24] And then that's it.

[22:25] That's the prep phase.

[22:26] All right.

[22:27] That's it.

[22:28] Simple.

[22:29] All right.

[22:30] Now, we start marketing because we got all the materials done.

[22:30] Now we market them.

[22:32] So, now we contact this prepactive virus.

[22:34] We go need a teaser, then NDA, then which is the one to three page blind description

[22:39] of the business, then the data room, which is basically like they have to put the stuff

[22:43] like in the cloud so that people can always have access to it.

[22:45] So, all these potential buyers will be sifting through all your resources to come up

[22:49] with questions that they're going to ask you or say that's not a good deal for them.

[22:52] Right?

[22:53] This is when you have your kind of your pitch deck, right?

[22:55] Of what you're going to present to them, right?

[22:58] You're going to dry run, practice it, et cetera.

[23:00] The potential investors will then submit their IOS.

[23:03] All right.

[23:04] That's the indication of interest that they're like, we might be interested in buying

[23:07] this business and they'd give a rough range, right?

[23:10] And then you have potential, you have people who are, I'm trying to go through this

[23:13] part faster because it sounds boring, but this is the stuff, this is how it works, right?

[23:17] So, potential investors visit company, they provide, you provide access to the data room

[23:20] of all the, the diligence stuff that they're going to need.

[23:22] So, they have a cursory idea of what they need.

[23:24] And you do the data room so you don't have to do all this interaction.

[23:26] Just put all the shit up there and they can all have access to it.

[23:28] And then when you start the actual offers, which is here, we can't even find offers received

[23:33] and evaluate it, strategies determined for moving forward with final parties, right?

[23:37] So, this is where you bid them back against each other and then you get final offers,

[23:41] which is LOS, okay?

[23:42] Letters of intent, okay?

[23:44] Now, once you have the letters of intent and you bid them back together, you're going

[23:48] to have different deal structures that are going to be presented to you, which I think is

[23:50] covered here, okay?

[23:51] So, you start to go shading those, you go back and forth, et cetera.

[23:54] Now, here's the thing.

[23:56] Here's the price and then how it's paid.

[23:58] It's price and terms.

[24:00] And I can't tell you, like getting good terms is worth discounts, right?

[24:04] Now, it depends on why you're selling.

[24:05] You just want to sell to have a story and that's one thing.

[24:06] But if you're selling it, you get rich.

[24:08] Then the terms matter a lot, all right?

[24:10] So, people share a big number.

[24:11] Like for example, if I wanted to say I sold, you know, Jim Lunch, prestige of up to $100 million,

[24:15] I could have gotten $100 million in paper, all right?

[24:18] So, here me out.

[24:19] So, if I said, hey, pay me $25 million or not if we do a billion dollars this year and

[24:24] sales.

[24:25] Sure, they'll sign it and then I could say that added $25 million in a price value on

[24:29] the sale.

[24:30] I will be transparent with you.

[24:31] I had no seller financing.

[24:33] I had no earn out.

[24:34] I did do, I did roll equity because I sold 66%.

[24:39] And I had no transition services and no consulting, all right?

[24:42] And that was because that was the agreed upon way that I wanted to sell this business.

[24:45] And I said that upfront to everybody.

[24:47] I said, this is a full leadership exit.

[24:50] I will not be involved.

[24:51] I will not have transition because the thing is, if they're like sure, if you just keep

[24:54] working for the business for two years, yeah, we're fine selling to you.

[24:57] It's like, well, that might as well just own the damn thing, right?

[24:59] And I'll just grow up myself, right?

[25:00] And so, this is where this is important.

[25:03] Now, mind you, acquisition.com, for example, for our business, we only do minority investments

[25:07] because we want the leadership team there.

[25:09] So we actually want to just participate in the growth and help grow the companies from

[25:13] 3 million to 10 million to 20 million to 50 million in beyond, right?

[25:15] We want to participate in the growth and we're happy taking a smaller life of what we consider

[25:19] to be a bigger pie, rather than ripping out the management, right?

[25:22] So we work with people who are like not tech.

[25:24] Not really ready for institutional yet, but want to get that $20 million, $50 million, $100 million

[25:29] plus exit.

[25:30] I'm going to get them ready.

[25:31] Just for context, all right?

[25:32] So these are the things that will discount you.

[25:34] So if you had $100 million, for example, for an exit, they might say, okay, well, we're

[25:39] going to put $25 million in and earn out, $25 million going to be seller-financed.

[25:42] You're going to roll, 20% which is $20 million.

[25:45] So there's $30 million left and so we'll give you $30 million in cash.

[25:49] And you say, oh, I saw what company for $100 million, right?

[25:51] And of the 30, you've got the bonuses and you've got other equity partners if you have

[25:55] those.

[25:56] And then you've got the tax man.

[25:57] So all of a sudden, let's say you've got 20% that's given to your team.

[26:00] So now you're at $24 million and then tax man takes his 30, right?

[26:05] And you've got closing fees and things like that in escrophies.

[26:08] And so now you're at, whatever, $18-17 million.

[26:11] So you solidifies for $100 million, we only got $17 million, right?

[26:15] That's why this stuff matters, okay?

[26:18] So you want to make sure that you know why you are selling and what the most important

[26:22] things are for you and you need to ruthlessly, ruthlessly communicate that to the bankers,

[26:27] okay?

[26:28] Very important point because they will negotiate on those points for you.

[26:31] Now, the things that they're also looking for for them is, is it's a fit within their

[26:35] portfolio, like a family office, for example, it's just going to buy something that they

[26:38] think is a good cash flow investment.

[26:40] And price is going to be very important to them.

[26:42] A strategic buyer will be somebody who's going to be, let's say, let's say you own a car

[26:46] wash, you know, chain or whatever.

[26:48] If there's a bigger car wash chain that just wants to buy yours, they'll give you better

[26:51] multiple because they already have all these systems in place.

[26:54] So they're going to make more money from your business than just a generic buyer will.

[26:57] So the ideal way to exit is to a strategic is you get the best multiples, but to be fair,

[27:01] there are more financial buyers than there are strategic.

[27:03] So that's kind of the trade off, okay?

[27:05] And you want to make sure that your business isn't good hand so that you want people

[27:08] who have relevant experience.

[27:10] We were very fortunate that the people that we felt were most equipped to buy the company,

[27:13] we're also the ones who ended up giving us the best offer.

[27:16] And so that doesn't happen, we were very fortunate in a working out with that way for

[27:19] us.

[27:21] But this, it doesn't always happen the way.

[27:23] And then this is a really simple one.

[27:24] Do I like these people?

[27:25] Well, my team, like these people, because ultimately the team's going to be working with

[27:27] them, right?

[27:28] So you want to ask those questions as you're going throughout.

[27:30] So like you can have assholes who pay you a little bit more and then really nice guys

[27:33] who pay you a little bit less, life's short, man.

[27:35] So like I would go with people who a lot of people were grit just taking the highest offer,

[27:41] rather than 10% less and having a much better life.

[27:44] At this point, you would sign your L.O.I.

[27:46] All right, and most of the times it can be exclusive, saying like, if you have a tremendous amount

[27:50] of interest, you might be able to sign L.O.Is and have the not be exclusive and they still

[27:54] bid all the way up to the purchase agreement.

[27:56] Most times that's not the case.

[27:57] They don't want to expend the money.

[27:59] So like the, so APG when they bought us, spend probably about a million bucks,

[28:03] indiligence, just intelligence, right, to figure out whether our companies were buying.

[28:07] Right.

[28:08] And again, you're not going to attract guys.

[28:09] You're going to write a hundred million dollars of diligence for five million dollar

[28:13] deal.

[28:14] It makes no sense.

[28:15] If you want big money numbers, you have to, you've got to follow the big money process.

[28:18] All right.

[28:19] So at this point, you sign an exclusive L.O.I. meaning you can't shop the business to anybody

[28:23] else during the period of the, of the due diligence.

[28:26] Now, I'm going to say it at the end, but I'm going to say it again.

[28:28] All right.

[28:29] And I've got a special tree for you, which I'm now remembering.

[28:31] At the end of this video, I'll actually, I video taped us actually having the, the

[28:36] escrow hit and the final signing and you can actually see it go down for real.

[28:40] All right.

[28:41] It's very anticlimactic.

[28:42] But you can see it for real and see what a $50 million dollar sell looks like.

[28:45] Okay.

[28:46] So the due diligence will begin.

[28:48] They're going to try to negotiate time saying, oh, we can get a faster close.

[28:51] If Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, if you accept this little or a pride, bullshit, they're

[28:53] going to take as long as they want.

[28:54] Literally ignore it.

[28:55] They seriously.

[28:56] They will try and you speed.

[28:57] I had every single person try to you speed as a selling point.

[29:00] I thought it was legit the first time.

[29:02] They said 30 day close.

[29:04] And it took, sorry.

[29:05] I said 30 day close and it took 112 days.

[29:08] And I accepted worth this is on one of the other companies we sold.

[29:11] I accepted worth terms on them.

[29:13] So the next time I came around, this is why I'm giving you this stuff.

[29:15] Next time I came around, they were like, oh, we could do a fast close.

[29:17] I was like, whatever, take your time.

[29:19] My company's grown, do whatever you want.

[29:21] And when you do it that way, you're in the position of power.

[29:24] Okay.

[29:25] So they're going to audit your quality of earnings, which is something you have to get the

[29:27] bankers.

[29:28] Looks like it's not going to do that.

[29:29] Which is to make sure that your numbers are legit, that they are what you say they are.

[29:32] But you can put numbers in the excelsi, but are they for real?

[29:34] Right?

[29:35] Then they'll do legal diligence.

[29:36] So they're going to make sure you actually own the company.

[29:37] Do you have any lawsuits against you?

[29:39] Are you breaking any laws?

[29:41] Which actually is fairly common when it comes to claims and things like that for like FTC,

[29:46] things like it's actually fairly common.

[29:48] So you want to make sure that stuff's all right.

[29:49] And that stuff can blow deals up.

[29:51] I had a coin to some line that had two different deals blow up that were like nine

[29:54] figure deals multiple years apart because they were not compliant.

[29:58] All right.

[29:59] So like, and they thought that the lack of compliance was one of the reasons that they were

[30:01] so successful.

[30:02] And so they didn't want it to risky.

[30:04] All right.

[30:05] What they'll then do is they'll start interviewing your customers.

[30:07] All right.

[30:08] This may sound freaky, but that's what they're going to do.

[30:09] They're going to talk to your customers and they're going to talk to you and

[30:10] employees and they're going to interview them.

[30:11] The firm that that purchase has been like $250,000.

[30:14] I'm pulling that number out of error, but it's a lot on research to see what your customers

[30:20] think about you.

[30:21] So if you're terrified to think about what your customers who are past customers, who no

[30:23] longer pay you, think about you, be prepared.

[30:25] They're going to talk to them.

[30:26] You're like, should I buy this company?

[30:27] Is this a good company?

[30:28] Was your experience been like?

[30:29] Right?

[30:30] Same thing with your employees.

[30:32] Now they're not going to ask them about that stuff.

[30:34] They're going to only talk to people already know about the deal.

[30:36] But they're going to interview them really heavily to see what your involvement is.

[30:39] Is he really, really passively involved?

[30:42] What do you do on our daily basis?

[30:43] What are they doing at daily basis?

[30:44] They want to know that if you leave, it's still going to keep going and growing.

[30:46] All right.

[30:47] Then you've got background checks of you and your management team to make sure no one's

[30:50] a convicted criminal or something sketchy, which more realistically is like financial fraud.

[30:55] Employment contracts to make sure that if you leave, they don't all leave with you or

[30:58] they're like only there for you, etc.

[31:00] And you're like, okay, I feel like I'm done.

[31:02] There's more.

[31:03] So, once you've gone through this whole delgis process, which takes 16 to 90 days.

[31:06] Now if you're tracking with me, there was like three months of looking for bankers and

[31:10] figuring that part out and making sure that your business is ready may take much longer than

[31:14] that.

[31:15] But assuming your business is ready, right?

[31:17] And you have met the prerequisite.

[31:18] Might take you 12 weeks to find the right bankers from there.

[31:20] It's 20-ish weeks to get to this point.

[31:22] And then you might have another 60 to 90 for intelligence.

[31:24] Now bankers will say that it's going to take less time.

[31:26] They're incentivized to tell you that it takes less time.

[31:28] So I was talking to a good friend of mine who was like, hey man, I got, they said they're

[31:32] 30 day diligence and it quick close.

[31:34] And I was like dude, it's not going to happen.

[31:35] And it was for a nine-figure number.

[31:38] And Lomba Hold, 90 days later, he was like, yeah, fast, they said wrong they were.

[31:45] Right, he's like, why didn't you tell me this was going to be so much fun.

[31:48] And he's now, I think, like, five months into his process of post-posed agreement site.

[31:53] So like, I'm not saying that that's typical.

[31:56] But I'm saying like, you need to prepare it for a year.

[31:58] Again, it's going to be a year-slag.

[31:59] And a lot of your focus is going to go to this process.

[32:02] So like, you really need a strong management team of place who can continue to grow the business

[32:05] without you.

[32:06] And that'll prove the point.

[32:08] And this is a note.

[32:10] The longer the process takes, it is in the buyers' advantage that it take a long time.

[32:14] All right, so you want a fast close.

[32:17] They want a slow close.

[32:18] And being real, the only way to speed up the close is to keep growing like crazy.

[32:23] Because then they're going to realize that all of a sudden the valuation from the beginning

[32:27] to the end will have changed.

[32:29] And then you will have much more negotiating power and you can break the agreement and get

[32:31] other offers, right?

[32:33] So important point there.

[32:34] Now, so once you've gotten that point, you'll get a person's agreement.

[32:38] Inside of the person's agreement, you will have these different pieces you have to watch

[32:40] out for.

[32:41] Indemonities are the things that you were liable for.

[32:43] These are the things that will keep you up at night.

[32:45] You need to go shade hard on these things.

[32:46] Now give the things that are reasonable.

[32:48] Like, yes, like fundamental, you know, in denogate warranties, I think, is the thing

[32:52] of the clause.

[32:53] Whatever.

[32:54] It's like, you actually own the company.

[32:55] You actually own the trademarks.

[32:56] Like, yes, you have to, like, guess otherwise, the all purchases off, right?

[32:59] And you can be liable for the total versus amount for that stuff, right?

[33:02] Now, that's the indemnities.

[33:04] But the other indemnities are things that are completely out of your control.

[33:07] So you want to make sure you negotiate those things out.

[33:08] And again, with all these negotiations, you have to be willing to walk away.

[33:11] It's like, I don't, like, if this bullet's in there, the deal's off.

[33:15] Like, and if you can't say that, you're going to get it raked over the calls, okay?

[33:18] Now, non-competes depends on why you're selling and what you want to do next.

[33:22] But you want to be very specific.

[33:23] And this is one of the hardest things that you're going to get into negotiating, especially

[33:26] if you have a skill.

[33:27] If you're really good at, you know, trash compacting, they're going to not want you

[33:30] to touch anything trash related for a long period of time, all right?

[33:33] And what's really tricky about this is that if you roll equity into the new company that

[33:38] they're going to be buying your company in or whatever, they will write in the Articles

[33:42] of Incorporation that none of the people who have that can compete.

[33:45] And so even if you have a purchase non-competes, you may have a non-competes as long as you

[33:49] are an equity holder in that other company, which means that if you want to breach your

[33:52] non-competes, you would have to give up the equity that you rolled.

[33:55] In addition to the, that's once the other non-competes expired.

[34:00] So you have to be very, very careful about how these non-competes are written.

[34:05] And the definitions that you have on this is so important.

[34:07] Like I can't, like so, for example, if you were selling, let's say a skin care line.

[34:12] They might say, the first one you get might just say like you can't be in beauty anymore.

[34:16] Well, that's be freaking ridiculous, right?

[34:18] Because you know the space and you're not competing with your company, instead of skin care,

[34:21] you start getting into makeup, right?

[34:23] And you have to make that argument, right?

[34:24] Depends on the size of the deal and what you're willing, like if this is the one deal that's

[34:27] going to seal all deals for you, then maybe it will be willing to give more.

[34:30] Right?

[34:31] And be like, alright, I'm not going to touch the space for a long time, right?

[34:33] On the flip side, if you're like, I already know what my next thing is going to be.

[34:35] And this is the best thing to do with the non-competes is know what you're going to do next.

[34:39] Because if you know what you're going to do next, then you can be very specific with

[34:41] the language and you can make sure that you're 100% covered and just tell them, this

[34:44] is what I plan on doing next.

[34:45] I just don't want that to be affected.

[34:46] And if you say that, and I'm telling you guys, the best way to negotiate these things

[34:49] is to be honest, just tell them what you want.

[34:52] And a lot of times it's much easier than trying to guess and ascribe blame and all that kind

[34:55] of stuff.

[34:56] Alright?

[34:57] Schedules is all the stuff that you provide is basically another word of proof, right?

[35:00] We're doing all this based on these assumptions and the assumptions have to be true.

[35:03] For some reason, the schedules are not there.

[35:05] Like we did this based on this, you know, cusher segmentation analysis.

[35:08] If you've mentioned it in the selling process of getting them to say yes and negotiating,

[35:12] but then you don't include it in the agreement as a schedule, it's as though it didn't

[35:15] happen and then they can come back and screw you.

[35:17] Now, this all sounds scary.

[35:19] Most of the times these agreements don't get repealed, alright?

[35:21] But you want to make sure that you include all the stuff and that stuff sucks, but you

[35:23] got to do it and you got to have a good lawyer for it.

[35:25] Alright?

[35:26] Definitions.

[35:27] This is kind of interesting as a total philosophical point.

[35:30] The agreement itself is almost as long as the pages of definitions for the terms that

[35:35] are used in the agreement.

[35:36] And I think Socrates said, wisdom begins with the definition of terms.

[35:39] And so like fundamentally, the agreement is like party A as defined by x agrees to pay

[35:46] y according to these terms to party Z according to these terms according to the, you know,

[35:53] this amount according to whatever.

[35:55] So it's like all these things are just terms that have to get defined.

[35:58] And so I'll give you an example term that we were able to redefine, I think it was, actually,

[36:03] I think we redefine a term within the non-capit that dramatically changed the meaning of

[36:08] the document and made it much better for us to do whatever we wanted to do next.

[36:12] And so like just changing the definition of a single word can run through an entire agreement.

[36:16] And sometimes rather than fighting on clauses, it's better to really narrow down the definition

[36:21] of what you're trying to define.

[36:23] So the scope might be geography for non-capit or it might be that, like there's a million

[36:28] things they define in these documents, but making sure that you read the definitions for

[36:32] what these words mean is really important.

[36:34] Alright?

[36:35] The few points, and this is just the points that you want to negotiate there's a zillion of the

[36:38] things.

[36:39] These are the main, the big headers.

[36:40] Networking capital, this is the very end you've already read on everything, already read

[36:43] on the term, you're in the private, oh, oh, right?

[36:45] Now you have to grow a networking capital, which is how much money you're going to leave

[36:47] in the business, right?

[36:49] And this is what we're going to try and, you're going to try and get you there too, right?

[36:51] It's like, hey, let's see, you've got a million bucks of working capital in the bank

[36:54] account.

[36:55] They're going to be like, well, you've had a million dollar sitting there for a whole year,

[36:57] so that comes with the business.

[36:58] You're like, well, I've just had it there because I didn't take dividends out of it.

[37:00] Which why, by the way, is a good reason to dividend out stuff and keep little in the bank

[37:05] account if you're a small business.

[37:06] Now, if you're reinvesting and buying and doing it and doing it and stuff, then that's a

[37:09] different question, which most of you guys are not doing that right now.

[37:11] So that being said, now working capital is, how much money is required to run this business

[37:15] so that when we have this transition, they can continue to work as normal, right?

[37:18] And you want that to be as little as possible so that you can take as much of that cash

[37:22] to the bank account in addition to what they're going to pay you.

[37:24] Alright?

[37:25] And then finally, the S-Crumount.

[37:26] So let's say you've got that $100 million dollar deal, like I said earlier, and they

[37:29] might say, we want to keep 20% in S-Crum.

[37:31] All of a sudden, you've got $20 million in S-Crum.

[37:34] And again, we still have the S-Crum, we've got the seller finance, we've got the earn-out,

[37:38] we've got the splits that you have, we've got taxes, we've got all these other things

[37:41] that are going to come out of it.

[37:42] Alright?

[37:43] As you got to make sure it makes sense.

[37:44] And so S-Crumount's, like if you can keep it under 10% you're rocket, alright?

[37:47] Now they're going to probably keep some of it there and that's because they keep that

[37:51] as insurance.

[37:52] Like if something else comes up or there's some bill or blah blah that's your fault, some

[37:55] back taxes, whatever they take it out the S-Crumount.

[37:57] Alright, that's how they do.

[37:58] And then usually they will release that and again, when they release it, they can release

[38:02] it in phases.

[38:03] So I think we had, I think there was like a 90-day and then a one-year for ours.

[38:07] But like it can change.

[38:08] Some people have S-Crumount that holds for two years, some people don't have any S-Crumount,

[38:11] but it's a negotiating point.

[38:12] Alright?

[38:13] And I'm repeating this.

[38:14] Don't let speed be negotiating until you used against you.

[38:16] Alright?

[38:17] It doesn't matter, they're going to take as long as they want, so don't let them use

[38:19] that against you.

[38:20] Alright?

[38:21] Finally, you've done all this stuff.

[38:23] You've negotiated all the, the hard points.

[38:25] You've gotten here and it's now payday.

[38:28] Alright?

[38:29] So first off, it's very active because it takes all this time and then all you do

[38:33] see is just like a big deposit or bank account or like, oh, well I guess I am the

[38:37] same.

[38:38] So I'm just telling you that's what's going to happen.

[38:39] Alright?

[38:40] That being said, you actually don't even sign papers.

[38:42] There's so many papers that you actually have to pay someone to sign up because it

[38:44] takes so long.

[38:45] So we actually paid our attorneys and I think it took like six hours just to sign on our

[38:49] behalf for all the documents and do that for us.

[38:51] Alright?

[38:52] Now once all the documents have received by the S.R. company, both parties have signed

[38:56] everything at that point they initiate the deposits to the parties that have already been

[39:00] predefined.

[39:01] So if you have payouts that go to, let's say your bankers are brokers that comes off

[39:04] the top, if you have payments that go to the S.R. company, comes off the top, if you have

[39:07] distribution that come to your employees or other equity holders or investors that then

[39:12] all comes and then you get your piece.

[39:15] So to, and just hold on because I'll show you the actual video, it's only like I think

[39:20] 30 or 40 seconds of the actual signing moment for us and you can see what it really looks

[39:25] like to close a $50 million deal.

[39:27] But just a few closing thoughts on this is that they're going to treat you like you don't

[39:30] know anything.

[39:31] Alright?

[39:32] Now to get smart, you got to read stuff, watch this video, rewatch it and understand

[39:36] the pieces that someone's going to try and do to screw you over.

[39:40] And you know, a trust is going to be a big component of this.

[39:43] So like you have to trust the people that you're going to do business with and if you

[39:46] don't, it's going to be really difficult.

[39:48] Now that being said, you can trust them but you still want to verify.

[39:50] You still want to make sure that the words say what they say they say.

[39:52] You know, a lot of times that's not the case.

[39:55] Alright?

[39:56] And so big picture, if you do get to this point, congratulations.

[39:58] It's very, very hard to grow business, do all the stuff and sell to an institutional buyer

[40:04] who will pay tens of millions or hundreds of millions of dollars per company.

[40:08] These are just some of the lessons that I learned and this is the process that took

[40:10] me a long time to even just figure out how it worked.

[40:13] And for most of the nation, I make these videos because I know and told me this stuff.

[40:17] And so I'm hoping that for you guys this helps you out and hey, if you're doing over

[40:21] 3 million, you're going to have this up and we'll see what we can do to help you out and

[40:25] help walk you through the process.

[40:26] You know, this is the actual video of us giving the final word and seeing a $50 million

[40:33] deal go down in the world between us and the lawyers and the private new firm.

[40:37] So it's all there and joy it.

[40:39] And so if you could confirm that you release your signature pages, contemporary instantly

[40:48] with the release of the seller's signature pages, we will be done on our side.

[40:54] Okay, confirmed.

[40:57] Great.

[40:58] All of this.

[40:59] Yep, we are good.

[41:01] We are good.

[41:03] confirmed.

[41:04] Okay.

[41:05] Great.

[41:06] And Alex, can you confirm your release of signature pages, contemporary instantly

[41:11] with the buyer signature pages such that we can close?

[41:15] Confirm.

[41:16] Great.

[41:17] Well, congratulations everybody.

[41:22] Just in time for a pretty nice weekend.

[41:24] Hopefully, you know, turn it over to Franchor Alex if they want to say any word.

[41:30] Congratulations.

[41:31] Yeah.

[41:32] Alex, can I use Lea on?

[41:34] Oh yeah, yeah, right here.

[41:36] She's right.

[41:37] Excellent.

[41:38] Great.

[41:39] Okay, good.

[41:40] Well, guys, congratulations.

[41:41] This is a big milestone.

[41:42] We're happy to be here with you.

[41:44] And, you know, I know this has been like a long road and we're happy to be at the

[41:52] starting line here.

[41:55] Sorry, we're excited for the future.

[41:58] And we have so many, it's going to be fun to announce it to the team on Monday and Tuesday.

[42:04] So we're stoked.

[42:05] It's going to be a good, it's going to be a good next phase.

[42:08] It's going to be a good kick off year for everyone.

[42:10] Yep.

[42:11] Always, lots of love everybody.

[42:12] See you in the next video.

[42:13] Keeping awesome.

[42:14] Bye.

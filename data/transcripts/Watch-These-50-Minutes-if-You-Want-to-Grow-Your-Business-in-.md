[00:00] You're about to see a fascinating conversation

[00:01] to hide with Dave Ramsey where we talk about how he makes money.

[00:05] The advantages of in-person versus remote,

[00:07] a project that he lost millions of dollars on,

[00:09] that I think has underlying lessons

[00:11] that any business owner can take from them.

[00:13] And finally, five stages of scaling

[00:15] all entrepreneurs go through.

[00:16] I think you're gonna love it.

[00:17] Enjoy.

[00:18] Welcome everyone to the game.

[00:19] I'm here with Dave Ramsey,

[00:22] the man in the myth legend.

[00:23] Honorabe, back with you, my friend.

[00:24] I'm so excited.

[00:25] Well, everything is happening with you guys.

[00:27] You're blowing up, man.

[00:28] I'm proud to watch it.

[00:29] It's great.

[00:30] Well, thank you.

[00:31] We're trying to fall in the Ramsey footsteps.

[00:34] There's so much stuff that I had written down

[00:36] in prepare for today and I doubt we'll get to all of it.

[00:38] But if you could walk me through just kind of

[00:40] leave the land in terms of Ramsey solutions,

[00:43] as the business existed today,

[00:44] because I think it'll be helpful for the audience

[00:45] to give context.

[00:46] Yeah, what ended up happening with us was

[00:48] weak, classic entrepreneurs.

[00:50] We were a wee bit ADD.

[00:54] And so, you know, just something flashy

[00:57] and shiny went in front of us, we would look at it.

[01:00] But it all came through the funnel of,

[01:03] or the filter of, does this serve our mission?

[01:07] And our mission is just to help people

[01:09] with common sense education and empowerment.

[01:11] It's some area in their life.

[01:12] It started in the money piece.

[01:14] And so, when I first started,

[01:15] I was doing a free, I was working for free

[01:18] at a talk radio station,

[01:20] doing a little talk radio show in the local station.

[01:23] And I printed a little book,

[01:24] started selling it out of the trunk of my car.

[01:25] So publishing was born, right?

[01:28] And then we did an event at the local Ramata Inn.

[01:30] So live events were born.

[01:32] And so, each of these, in those days,

[01:35] everything was analog.

[01:36] And of course, the internet comes along.

[01:38] And one of these kids working for me comes in and goes,

[01:40] hey, we need a website, and I'm like, what's that?

[01:43] And so we built a website on one of those tiny little

[01:47] antique y'all to look them up there, cool.

[01:49] Those little, first little Apple computers,

[01:51] the first little, they look like a little shoebox.

[01:53] And he built this aside on there with coal fusion.

[01:57] And it was pitiful.

[01:59] But it was still cutting edge.

[02:01] It was a big time deal.

[02:02] And those days, because nobody had a website.

[02:04] We had one of the first people had a web store to sell stuff.

[02:07] Because it was a platform, again, platform, platform, platform.

[02:10] So we're platform agnostic.

[02:12] And anytime we see an a new, earner, emerging platform,

[02:17] analog or digital, we're going to put our toe in the water.

[02:20] And keep doing the ones we're already doing.

[02:21] We're not going to abandon them.

[02:23] If they die on their own, fine.

[02:25] If something runs, it's course we're done with it.

[02:29] But we just go on and do the next thing.

[02:32] And God walks in my office in the early 2000s,

[02:34] and we need a podcast.

[02:35] And what's a podcast?

[02:36] And I know what this is.

[02:38] And we were one of the first, certainly one of the first

[02:40] and talk radio to put a podcast out.

[02:43] Because the talk radio people resisted it.

[02:45] They were afraid it was competition.

[02:46] So on and on and on and on it goes.

[02:48] And now we end up today.

[02:50] We've got about 14 profits centers here.

[02:53] Inside the organization of days, there's

[02:55] about 1100 of us, 650,000 square foot campus.

[02:59] That were the you've been here and hung out

[03:02] where this at our home.

[03:03] And so we've got the Ontary Leadership

[03:06] Brand, or we're teaching leadership and coaching small businesses.

[03:09] And we've got events around that books around that.

[03:11] The book we're talking about today is from that idea.

[03:15] And we've got a huge coaching business in that area.

[03:18] Coaching small businesses, 200 and fewer team members.

[03:22] And we're not real good with the large corporate

[03:25] goobers.

[03:26] We don't help them much.

[03:27] So and then we've got the obviously we've got all the stuff

[03:32] in the money space, financial piece of university's now

[03:34] digital.

[03:35] It's no longer a VHS or a DVD or an even an MP3.

[03:39] It's a digital format.

[03:41] We're rolling that up into slowly.

[03:44] We're invaded, a slowly start to move pieces of that

[03:47] into the every dollar app, which is the largest budgeting,

[03:50] one of the largest budget apps on the planet right now.

[03:52] We've got 50 million downloads with that.

[03:56] That app is huge.

[03:57] It's exploding.

[03:58] And it's fabulous.

[03:59] It's very robust.

[04:00] Our tech team is done in incredible job.

[04:02] So that's the digital, very scalable thing.

[04:05] You know, on one of the barbell.

[04:07] And then we've still got coaches over on the other end.

[04:11] And we still do small high-end ultra VIP platinum events.

[04:16] We're 25 people go to my event barn at my farm

[04:19] and hang out with me for a weekend.

[04:21] So we go all the way, we stretch the spectrum

[04:24] from the high margin, high touch, expensive thing,

[04:31] all the way over to free on the every dollar app

[04:34] or free on the podcast consumption or the YouTube consumption.

[04:39] Probably more of an answer than you wanted,

[04:40] but that we're all over the place.

[04:42] And all of these things that we'll have to do with just

[04:44] is there another way to preach this message?

[04:47] Is there another platform?

[04:48] So we're platform agnostic.

[04:50] Someone said you're a, you're a best selling author.

[04:52] No, that authors want the things we do.

[04:54] You're, you're talk radio guy.

[04:55] No, but talking on the microphone

[04:56] just one of the things we do.

[04:58] And we're not married to any of my got one wife

[05:01] and that's, that's plenty.

[05:03] Ha.

[05:03] All right, I have a bunch of follow-ups on that.

[05:06] So with all these different profit centers,

[05:09] number one is what you have 14 and it's been,

[05:14] how many years?

[05:15] 35 years, 40 years, how many since you started?

[05:17] About 35 years.

[05:18] 35 years.

[05:19] So it's roughly like one profit center per,

[05:24] per two and change years, right?

[05:26] Two and a half years almost on the nose.

[05:29] That gets started more than that

[05:31] because we've killed some along the way.

[05:32] Yeah, even better.

[05:33] So what makes something worth pursuing

[05:36] versus what makes something and no?

[05:38] Is it just its on mission?

[05:39] Cause I would imagine that there's,

[05:41] you have resource constraints.

[05:43] You can't do everything that you would love to do.

[05:44] So what, what makes something

[05:46] what worth doing versus not worth doing?

[05:48] Well these days we are much better.

[05:51] In the old days I was just, we just did it.

[05:53] I mean, it was an ex-stupid.

[05:54] That was just stupid.

[05:56] And but nowadays we actually do run a beta on something

[06:00] and we look at the ROI's

[06:01] and we look at the customer acquisition cost,

[06:03] the row has and so forth.

[06:04] And we're looking at, you know,

[06:07] is this a good use of our bandwidth,

[06:10] of our marketing bandwidth, of our leadership time frame.

[06:16] You know, the time invested.

[06:18] Overhead committed to this project.

[06:21] And so, I mean, we can, you know,

[06:24] we drop a lot of stuff in the test bucket.

[06:27] And but if it doesn't,

[06:29] if it's not gonna have a great row as if it's not gonna

[06:32] have a great conversion and if it's not gonna have a great

[06:34] margin when we're done, we can't afford to do it

[06:38] because of opportunity cost.

[06:40] We can afford financially to do it.

[06:42] But the missed opportunity on something

[06:44] that was working 10X of what this little thing

[06:47] that we fell in love with over here.

[06:48] But sucks, you know, we have to just let the thing

[06:52] that sucks, and it didn't make it out of the test tube.

[06:55] That's all in a mountain today.

[06:56] You take more of a test, test quickly,

[07:01] lots of ideas kind of strategy.

[07:02] And if something hits, then it's then you double down

[07:06] on those things.

[07:07] That's kind of how you think through kind of new product

[07:09] or expansion of like profit centers,

[07:11] things what you said.

[07:13] Exactly.

[07:14] And or can we, you know, can we iterate it five or 10

[07:16] degrees and cause it to work?

[07:18] I don't, we don't kill everything instantaneously.

[07:21] But I mean, if we're gonna invest even enough to get it

[07:23] into the test tube, we're gonna iterate, iterate, iterate

[07:25] before we kill it.

[07:26] But when we lose hope that the thing is gonna have a scale

[07:31] or have a margin that is commensurate with the,

[07:35] with the resources committed, as you said,

[07:37] that then, you know, when we lose that hope,

[07:39] we've got to be grownups and go,

[07:41] yeah, I really like this thing, but it just,

[07:43] it's not nice, it's not good business.

[07:45] So with these new endeavors, the first thing I wrote down

[07:48] when you started, when you brought it up was,

[07:50] was who does new?

[07:52] And the reason I bring this up

[07:53] because I've mentioned a lot of business owners

[07:55] have many ideas, you know, you said it the earlier

[07:57] I'd like Shiny object, like, oh, this looks exciting,

[07:59] this looks exciting, this looks exciting.

[08:01] But for something to work,

[08:02] you typically have to have talent overseeing it.

[08:05] Now, to imagine at the point that you're at now,

[08:06] you're probably not overseeing each of these kind of

[08:08] new profits centers or new ideas,

[08:09] maybe they're, you know, brought to you

[08:11] and you review the metrics, but you're not really driving

[08:14] unless you are, in which cases

[08:15] it open question.

[08:16] Who, who does new?

[08:19] Because are you gonna take resources from something

[08:21] that's working or are you bringing somebody new in?

[08:23] Or do you have a specific testing department

[08:25] that's all they do and then they hand it off to somebody else?

[08:27] Like, you walk me through that process?

[08:29] Probably a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a,

[08:32] a little bit of all of that.

[08:33] I don't do it.

[08:34] No.

[08:35] Um, but, but what we have created is this collaboration

[08:39] of freedom for anybody to throw an idea on the table.

[08:46] And then you got to defend it.

[08:48] You got to make a case for it.

[08:49] Um, and so you can't just throw it out there and go,

[08:52] well, you guys go do that now because I'm so smart.

[08:54] I came up with it because I deserve it.

[08:55] Dima doesn't people who can implement them or the problem.

[08:58] Any one of the profits centers, for instance,

[09:00] on trade leadership, okay.

[09:01] So it's got several components to it.

[09:03] It's got a digital component on trade leadership elite,

[09:05] which is a digital coaching product for small businesses, right?

[09:09] So if somebody comes in and says, I got a great idea

[09:11] to add something, a tool to that digital product or whatever,

[09:15] that's usually going to bubble up somewhere in that

[09:17] on trade leadership team from that device president,

[09:21] who's running that Jason or, um, you know,

[09:24] John Falcons are seeing your coach over there.

[09:26] So he's got a lot of coach,

[09:27] he's, I mean, his coaches there on the front lines.

[09:29] They're interfacing with the customer all the time.

[09:31] The customers are going to throw needs at him.

[09:33] They went, okay, we need to serve this need.

[09:34] How can we do that?

[09:35] Is that a digital thing?

[09:36] Is a coaching need?

[09:37] How are we going to fill?

[09:38] So fill the need, fill the need, fill the need from an entrepreneurs

[09:40] expert, but what we do is we give a lot of power to the vice president

[09:45] of that particular business unit or sub business unit, uh,

[09:50] to bubble things up.

[09:51] And then on top of that, if somebody's in another whole area,

[09:54] they're more than welcome to, you know, pull the pen on a grenade

[09:58] and throw it over in another area and you'll, hey, guys,

[10:00] I got a great idea over here.

[10:01] I want to blow some stuff up.

[10:03] And so, but again, you've got to defend that and then you've got

[10:06] to defend the resource usage, uh, to take it forward, to take it past gleaming

[10:13] idea that I had while I was on the running trail this morning, uh,

[10:16] what you get a new idea every freaking morning if you're doing this, you know,

[10:19] it's just, and 90% of them suck when they actually come in,

[10:22] but when they're on the running trail, they're all great, you know,

[10:25] before they see the light of day in the actual business climate.

[10:29] So anyway, this is, I'm convinced that, you know,

[10:32] everything Ramsey has done has been on about 10% of our ideas.

[10:36] 90% of them when they made the light a day sucked and some of them really suck bad,

[10:41] but, you know, you don't know that sometimes to get in their swinging.

[10:44] So all that to say, it's bubbling up, uh, occasionally,

[10:49] we'll have something that doesn't have a home, uh,

[10:53] and we have a special project's wind team that is an incubator.

[10:57] It's a shark tank, if you will, for, for ideas that don't, they can jump in

[11:01] and so you've got some senior leaders representing several of the disciplines

[11:05] that sit in there and special projects works on two things,

[11:08] broke things, broke, you know, something, an area's got the flu,

[11:12] and it's, you know, we're not meeting budget, we're not hitting our revenue goals.

[11:16] And it's a, you know, it's a good size thing and it's problem.

[11:18] I sit in that, I sit in that work team.

[11:20] That's one of the things I sit on.

[11:22] It's one of the group's work groups that sit in because I'm entrepreneur on a love

[11:25] working on broken things.

[11:26] And we'll take a baby thing in there that doesn't have a home in orphan and, you know,

[11:30] put it in an IQ in there and let's get this thing, let's get it nourished.

[11:34] Let's see if we can get it moving and see if it can survive.

[11:39] If we can get the thing to where it's passed beta and it's actually,

[11:44] the business is actually got some social proof, we'll make it a new profit center.

[11:50] Or we'll drop it into one of the existing ones that even though the, I didn't

[11:54] didn't come from them and go look, this fits over here, the best.

[11:58] So we're going to drop it with you guys and, and, you know, we'll send a leader

[12:02] when we send it over there, put a new leader on it and let, and then start to staff it out.

[12:07] So when you put a new leader on it, that's, so that was the who does new.

[12:10] That was kind of the heart.

[12:12] So when you put a new leader on, is that you typically pull like a junior, like,

[12:16] if you VP is ahead of a division, you pull somebody who's kind of one of their right

[12:19] hand, they get the opportunity from a career path and perspective that they can run this new thing.

[12:23] Or like, how do you think through, through bringing those leaders in or you mostly,

[12:27] yeah, I've just loved to know how do you think through that part?

[12:30] Probably 80% maybe even 90% of the time it's in house and we're constantly working on bench depth around here.

[12:39] And so we've got somebody waiting in the wings and it might be them that that birthed the new idea and brought it into

[12:47] special projects, you know, and so they may have been rocking the baby for a little while and then they just get to,

[12:52] they get to grow it on up, right?

[12:54] They get to give the orphan a home and they become the new mom of daddy or of the thing.

[12:58] So, yeah, that's how I like to do it because if the person, if it was born in their heart,

[13:07] they will fight all the enemies internally and externally for their survival of their baby.

[13:14] I mean, and they'll champion the cause, baby.

[13:17] I like champions.

[13:19] They paint their face blue and, you know, and, you know,

[13:24] ride a horse with a big sword coming through the thing to get everything and sometimes you've got to send them to,

[13:30] I would lot rather try to take somebody like that and pull them back and polish them a little bit than trying to light wet wood.

[13:37] White wood, that's a great analogy.

[13:40] Well, when you when you start these new divisions and I think I want to,

[13:45] the reason I'm hitting on this is because I think if you asked 100 entrepreneurs,

[13:48] what's the number one thing that you wish you could do,

[13:52] it would probably be more new stuff.

[13:54] And so, at this field, it's like a very, very relevant thing to talk about.

[13:58] And I think that happens at all levels because, you know, in the beginning,

[14:02] you're just barely figuring out what's going on and so you're just trying and seeing what sticks.

[14:06] Later, you have more resources.

[14:07] So, you think you can do more, but oftentimes you also distract the team.

[14:11] They feel whip-lash and then sometimes the corbusiness starts to falter because

[14:15] everyone's looking at the new shiny toy rather than the main game.

[14:19] We started it with one area and it was tech because tech was exploding 20 years ago.

[14:26] And so, you know, we had the web department, you know, as well as called, it's had lame-mix, right?

[14:32] And so, but these, so these, you know, these programmers and tech people are all sitting in a room,

[14:40] but they're getting paid off the P&L of that profit center.

[14:44] So, the guy or gal running that profit center wants some freaking accountability.

[14:49] But instead, we had them just over here.

[14:50] They were on the own little island and we had to break that up and that's when we

[14:54] busted it about, it's about 20 years ago.

[14:56] We went to this matrix approach.

[14:58] Well, this is a great segue.

[15:00] So, with each of these VPs, I would imagine these are, you know, among the most valuable people

[15:04] in the business, right? Because they're, they're fundamentally running a business unit.

[15:07] Yeah, they got literally APNL and they literally get paid off the P&L bottom of,

[15:12] would they get billed for portions of the overhead, the rent for the building in their area?

[15:17] As if they were, you know, a standalone business, so to speak.

[15:20] So, we're job-colsting if you want to use accounting terms and, and then they get paid off that bottom line.

[15:27] So, if they, if they're bottom line, go zoom zoom, they're personal income, go zoom zoom.

[15:31] I want them to be very wealthy because that means they made me,

[15:36] a lot of money.

[15:38] And so, I love it.

[15:39] And, yeah, and we want everybody in the building doing that.

[15:41] Also, though, we have a high respect for the C-suite.

[15:44] We have a high respect for that senior marketer and the, the value that they bring,

[15:49] not just the entrepreneur running the, the vice president's role.

[15:53] Or, again, a senior VP sitting some of those and even some executives, some of our operating

[15:59] board members sit in some of those seats. But, um, but that's how, you know, it all rolls up under

[16:04] a business unit.

[16:05] And then the C-suite I imagine gets kind of compensator from the company overall.

[16:08] Yeah, because what I've got is our operating board is half C-suite and a half business unit.

[16:14] And so, what we've got to have is we've got to have this, um, we have to have an accounting

[16:19] system and a budgeting system that serves the business units and notifies the rest of us

[16:26] if the business, how the business unit is performing. And so, uh, it's not really optional.

[16:31] You've got to do that. And, and if you're a bootstrapped entrepreneur that came out of sales

[16:38] remarketing, you might not know how to do all that accounting stuff. And so, I got to roll some

[16:43] accounting support up under you to make sure that that you get to keep doing the stuff you're

[16:48] good at. But we also actually want to count the beans.

[16:51] And make sure that you're on, you know, pay taxes. Yeah, there's stay open.

[16:56] Stay out of jail.

[16:59] I get, I get this question a lot. Some curious you're taking on it.

[17:02] Equity packages, stock shares, anything like that, or is it all pure based on bottom line

[17:07] profit? Is that the kind of the performance compensation component of the, the leadership that

[17:12] you bring in for either business units or C-suite? You know, when we first started sharing off the

[17:18] bottom line with people, that's when we had to answer the equity question. Was are we going to,

[17:24] let's someone have stock? Okay. So our in-game, we decided a long time ago in-game is not going

[17:32] public. In-game is perpetual operation, generationally. And so it's, I'm a Senate calls the

[17:40] infinite game. Okay. So we don't have an exit to an IPO planned. We're not doing that. We've decided

[17:48] distinctly 25 years ago, not doing that. We don't have a sale of any kind to a VC or anything else.

[17:57] We don't have a liquidity moment anywhere on the horizon at all. If you do, it would change what

[18:03] you're doing maybe. Okay. Because if you're going to take the thing public and you give some people

[18:09] some equity, that's not a big deal. Okay. But if you're running it infinite like that and about the

[18:16] only thing that we're 100, the about the only person in the building we're 100% sure is still going to

[18:20] be here is me. Everybody else could might someday want to leave or have to leave. And so,

[18:30] and I didn't want that. I wanted everybody to stay forever because I love our people. And I,

[18:34] you know, there's some of my best friends or my leaders here that I mean, we do stuff socially with

[18:38] our wives and husbands and everything else. I'd love them. I've got high respect for them as human

[18:44] beings, as their spiritual character, everything. But still, I have over, over all these years found

[18:50] that sometimes people leave. And I cry a little. But I cry a lot if they took stock with them.

[18:56] And so, we don't have any equity positions at all. And you make unbelievably good money when you

[19:03] move into leadership and you're paid off the bottom line here, like lights out, scary good money.

[19:08] Like nobody does what we do. We're so freaking generous because these are the people that are

[19:17] running the thing. They're the people that grew this. They deserve to get paid like they're a partner.

[19:22] And so, I have zero greed over that. But you don't own anything. I don't 100%

[19:29] well, I don't own the stock anymore. It's in my kids names. From a state standpoint,

[19:34] but, and they're, you know, my grown kids, the next gen of grown ramsies. So, but aside, I mean, I got 1%

[19:44] to be clear, but they only voting stock. But the, but anyway, no, in order is no equity. There's no

[19:50] equity anywhere except ramsies. That's it. I love that. I'd say Layla, and I have a similar perspective

[19:56] about acquisition.com, and that it's kind of our forever business. You know, we plan on just continuing

[20:01] to own and continuing to operate it. You know, we will enter. We kind of see it as the goose versus the eggs,

[20:08] at least how we think through it, which is probably like we use a different analogy. But similar,

[20:12] you have 14 profit centers. There's the eggs. And then the goose is like, why would we get rid of

[20:15] acquisition.com? It's, it's the, the mothership to use your language. So, it brings, so that brings up

[20:22] two, two different points that are probably somewhat related. So, one is, is 100% of ramsie in person,

[20:29] or anybody, is anyone remote? Not we all work at work. Yeah. So, there's no like, like, you know,

[20:35] have like exceptions, we're like, you know, like editors for for for for social media or, you know,

[20:41] maybe some of the coaches or something like that could be remote. Everybody moves to, to Tennessee.

[20:48] Yes. And the, the, the, with the exception of a lay occasional temporary thing. Yeah, of course,

[20:55] the contract. But, but in terms of the actual structure and the reasons very simple,

[21:01] our quality of communication in person communication, quality goes way up. And so,

[21:09] things are actually communicated. We all know this. Anyone that's got walking around since knows

[21:13] the 85% of communication is, is body language and tone and hate not words. And so,

[21:21] when you are sitting beside someone, you can feel the spirit of what's going on and you are

[21:30] getting a whole different quality level of quality of communication. What that does is it increases

[21:36] two things. It increases trust and it increases productivity. And then those two things increase speed,

[21:45] because an organization is moved at the speed of trust. And, and so, when I am not sure because I'm

[21:52] using a text or I'm even a zoom, and I'm not really sure what she meant or he meant. I can't really

[22:01] tell if they were being passive aggressive. But if you're sitting with him, you're sitting with him,

[22:06] you know, and I can, I can go, just go walk around the building and I can feel the air. I can

[22:13] feel it in the air. I've been leading a long time. And I teach my leaders to do this. There's an

[22:17] old book a thousand years ago in search of excellence. It was the good to great book before good

[22:23] to great before Jim Collins did. It was back in 92. And, you know, they studied great companies.

[22:30] And one of the things the managers did, they did management by walking around, just walk the floor

[22:34] of the plant, if you're in manufacturing and feel the vibe of the workers, feel the speed, feel the

[22:39] energy in the air. Look for chaos. Look for dirt and filth versus organization. And I walk through

[22:48] a smell food inside of our building. No, that's not cool. We have a cafeteria. You don't need

[22:54] it your desk. Leave your salmon somewhere else. Nobody wants to smell that crap, right? And so,

[22:59] you know, they're just little stuff. But you just walk through and you can kind of tell, you know,

[23:05] I walk past people. They're on a coaching call on a Zoom call with somebody on his pop my head

[23:10] in there. You know, smile wave and disrupt the whole call and then leave. It's breadhaken

[23:15] decision, right? So that kind of thing creates a cultural level of trust and productivity.

[23:25] I call them drive by communications. I can just drive. I can walk past and I read through the weekly

[23:30] reports and uh, someone says mothers got cancer and I walk past this touch them on the shoulders.

[23:35] I'm saying, man, I'm praying for your mom. Sorry about that. Thart, you know, six, eight, second

[23:41] interaction that does not occur if they're remote. I think you might like this. I think it was either

[23:48] Uber, Airbnb, someone can correct me in the comments. But they did a research study because I think

[23:55] they were trying to prove or at least definitively know whether in person versus remote, you know,

[23:59] which one is better, et cetera. And they they found an it depends answer at which is

[24:04] and I talk about this because obviously we're in person. We have a big, big headquarters here in

[24:08] Vegas. Um, that especially, especially for the first third of someone's career. So basically like

[24:16] called 18 to 35 is where those people get a disproportionate upside for being in person because of

[24:24] all of the unstructured learning that occurs that's not on your quote career path. You know,

[24:30] like if you're ever sitting right next to marketing and you're in sales, you know, you you over here,

[24:35] you know, what what's going on in terms of the organic stuff. You over here what's going on in the

[24:38] paid side. You start learning a little bit more about funnel, you know, about well landing page and

[24:42] conversion rates and things like that. And then all of a sudden when you are on a sales call,

[24:46] you know, with a business owner, who ever and they bring something of that up, you're like,

[24:50] oh, I actually know something about that because but if you were in an only zoom environment,

[24:55] you lose out on all of that. And so I'm a big advocate and because I obviously have a big, you know,

[25:00] percentage of the audits that I have that's in their early 20s, beginning their career. I would

[25:05] encourage you all to to work in person. I really mean that I did read one, I did read one piece of

[25:11] research that you get more chances at promotion. Oh yeah, in person, then if you're sitting

[25:18] at home and you're only on the calls, the commissarant to the task assigned to you. And so,

[25:23] you know, we can add to this even further. You've been here. We've got this massive fabulous

[25:29] cafeteria, a restaurant at Ramsey. So, and on top of that, we dropped several million dollars a year

[25:38] into that to subsidize the food cost. So you can eat here for about half of what you can drive

[25:44] down the road and, you know, get a fast food burger or whatever. Why do we do that? Because when

[25:49] people eat together, oh, that adds a whole another level. When you break bread with someone else,

[25:56] it changes everything. And so what happens is people that don't work together, end up eating

[26:01] together and what you're talking about occurs. They learn from each other. They, you know, they talk

[26:06] about stuff. They're working on, uh, something that they just talk about personal stuff. But then the

[26:09] next time an issue comes up, they trust that person because they've actually developed a bit of

[26:14] a relationship with them. I look over in our tech guys and we got a bunch of techies in here,

[26:18] a bunch of programmers and stuff. And they're all over their hulled around some table,

[26:22] we'll play in some weird board game thing that I don't even know how it works. Um, and, you know,

[26:27] that only programmers would play, right? And, um, are some weird card game dungeon in the dragon's type

[26:33] stuff or whatever. I don't know. And they're having a blast and they're playing together and eating

[26:40] together and that changes the whole vibe of the deal. I will tell you that if you just are

[26:45] only concerned about a task and that's it, a simple tactical do this thing, that's fine for remote.

[26:55] But our stuff is always 100% of the time. We want more out of the interaction than the simple

[27:02] task being accomplished. And that's why we've stood firm on this. And we've lost some people to that.

[27:07] They want to go work and have work-life balance, which are whatever they call it and say that they

[27:14] can work from home. But what that actually means is I'm not playing to work eight hours. Right?

[27:20] Because if you're working eight hours at home, you're not talking in interacting with your family.

[27:24] So I don't know how you added hours to your family unless you're cheating the company.

[27:30] And so, um, I don't, I don't understand it. But I'm not mad about it. It's just why we've decided to do

[27:36] it. And then, but some people, some people jet and then we've lost some good people over that.

[27:41] And we've had a lot of discussions about it here. But we're pretty firm on that.

[27:45] There's a couple of dovetails that I'll hit on that. So one is, you talked early about Bensteph.

[27:49] And I would imagine that one of the best ways to build the Bensteph is having more people

[27:52] across functionally learning in person from other leaders at cafeteria, at the water, break area,

[27:58] and what have you. You also spoke about trust, the speed of the company's based on the speed of

[28:02] trust. And I would, I, I, a hundred percent agree. And I think that translates into faster decision-making.

[28:11] And so I'm, I'm a big, I'm a big believer in the speed of decisions as the speed of the company,

[28:14] which can only be based on the trust that people have. If you have to double check every single

[28:18] thing that all of a sudden approval process, it has to get put in place. And then bureaucracy kills everything.

[28:23] Well, and, and it, it, it interferes with delegation. The, the essence of delegation is trust.

[28:31] And so when I can let something bubble up from the bottom, it's because I trust the people

[28:36] that they're, that the idea is going to get filtered and vetted. It's, we're not going to go drop a million

[28:40] dollars on a bad idea. You know, and so it's not, I trust the competency of the people. That's a

[28:46] debt, that's a form of delegation. And I think you spoke to two things that you spoke to with confidence

[28:50] and intention, right? So intention, you know, like, are they good at their job? And, or do they, do they,

[28:54] do they mean mean well, which I think it kind of ladders up to on brand versus off-brand? Is this a

[28:59] Ramsey thing to do? Is this the Ramsey way? So if, just because I think everybody loves the,

[29:06] the good story, what's the most? What's the biggest goof up you've had in 35 years on something

[29:12] that was off-brand for Ramsey that you were like, man, I can't believe we did that, or like, like,

[29:17] and, and, and what, what then, what'd you do about it afterwards? Because I'm sure every business

[29:22] owner's had a big goof up and you're like, shoot, that was bad. You know, I, I don't know if it was off-brand,

[29:29] but, I think one of the most expensive things we ever did was that we got about several millions

[29:40] of dollars into the building of a debit card. Okay. A Ramsey debit card that we, it wasn't off-brand,

[29:50] it was right on brand, but, but, but, well, this is one of those things we didn't know what we

[29:56] didn't know banking regulations and, and so forth. So we're looking for a click-in-water bank to

[30:03] park the thing in, because it's, we're not in the banking business, we're certainly not going to

[30:06] open a bank. Good Lord, no. That would be, there's no way, but there's tremendous revenue

[30:15] potential in the transaction fees. And so we're looking at the Ramsey debit card and it's

[30:21] something that we could promote, we could brand it, had a nice little gazelle on it, had a nice little

[30:26] r on it, that kind of stuff. And we screwed around that, that thing was born in special projects

[30:32] committee. It was a baby as an orphan and we put it, we brought it, that's a deal. We brought it

[30:37] in an outside guy that knew the banking world and he's still with us today, works in another area.

[30:41] He was brilliant guy, really smart. And I never want to lose the guy, but we got down into that

[30:49] thing and it, you know, of course it has to survive through the pandemic and that slowed everything

[30:59] down, shut everything down for a while and had to back, put it on the shelf, get off the shelf

[31:03] and dust it off, okay, get it going again, get the beta pick back up, get the alpha picked up,

[31:07] first and get the beta picked up. And I think we're at about 10,000 people in beta. Okay, and

[31:16] the outside fraud bots started hitting the thing. And we thought that the bank had the

[31:29] software to catch all of that and then we're looking at, okay, we're responsible for these

[31:34] overdrafts that are being created. We have to cover them in our contract and real quickly

[31:41] the things start going sideways and I'm like, man, I'm so many millions into this thing. I really

[31:47] don't want to kill this thing, but we're looking at the risk and the upside and we just we blew it

[31:52] up and we killed it. And I still got one of those little debit cards and I followed our carrier

[31:57] to remind me of how stupid it was. We weren't stupid, really. We did everything correctly, but what we,

[32:04] we were ignorant, we did not know what we didn't know about what our exposures were and once

[32:09] those exposures became evident. We just had to go, this is way scary, I can't breathe and we're

[32:19] not doing this. The hard losses could be infinite, huh? Exactly, exactly, I'm like, yeah,

[32:27] if we lose the several million we've got in it, that's that payles in comparison to how bad this

[32:33] could be if we don't stop. So we're going to stop now and I think the bank that we were working with

[32:40] later went sideways and was in the news and blew up. And so I think I think God protected us by

[32:47] letting us ex the thing early because we would have gotten the opportunity to exit anyway.

[32:51] Are we would add to move the whole project to another bank when that bank blew up? But I was a

[32:56] click and mortar bank thing. I feel like a lot of people have had that same like, this is such a

[33:00] good idea on paper. Why is this not working the way? Well, and it's exactly. And it was working,

[33:05] the customer loved it. We would have been able to track for the customer track their expenses

[33:10] and give them report and feedback. The data we could have reversed furnished back to the customer was

[33:15] going to be, oh man, it was going to be beautiful. I mean, I see it. It's compelling.

[33:22] And you know, and we had written so many of the APIs and so much of the tie-ins, you know,

[33:27] to get all that stuff. We're running it on every dollar in the beta. But, uh, yeah, I got,

[33:34] I got Harry. Well, let me pivot from something from from the super tactical of that to zooming

[33:40] all the way out. So a lot of entrepreneurs myself included, you know, you start to build a lot of wealth.

[33:47] And then there's also the biggest percentage of your wealth sits inside of the enterprise that you run.

[33:53] Right. And so how do you think about family office, like, you know, you start, you start,

[34:01] you start getting this money, right? That comes into the business. Or comes out of the business.

[34:04] Excuse me. Do you have any kind of mental framework that you work through in terms of

[34:10] percentage reallocation to new, you know, new investments within within the overarching structure?

[34:17] And where this gets more tactical for me to use, Lailon, I have run almost everything inside of

[34:24] acquisition.com. And that means like we own buildings, we own apartment complexes, all that stuff. It's still

[34:30] sits in acquisition.com. Obviously, there's entity structures and things like that. But in terms of

[34:35] the team that helps run it because, you know, agreson.com primarily is an investment, you know,

[34:39] it started as a family office. But it's just, it spun up these other, uh, profits centers to use your language.

[34:46] Um, over time. And so I'm curious. Have you, do you completely separate church and state to, to use that

[34:53] language in terms of, you know, Ramsey personal versus, yeah, can you just walk me through how you think through that?

[35:00] No, we, we have done all other investing outside of Ramsey solutions and in separate legal

[35:09] entities as well for for risk management purposes, that simple. And also for a state planning

[35:16] purposes. Uh, so for instance, the campus that you were on is probably a $600 million asset roughly,

[35:24] something like that. Um, maybe so. You own in cash. Yeah. Yeah. It's one of the audience to, I just

[35:31] wanted the audience to know. So when we, when we bought the dirt to start laying the first bricks

[35:38] on the first thing on it, uh, that was a $10 million purchase. And it's the largest purchase that

[35:42] ever done in my life. I don't know about the dirt. And I was freaking out. And I'm like, now I got to build something too.

[35:48] You know, now that I bought the largest thing, now I got to do something even bigger. And it's like,

[35:51] we're going to cash. So we cash flow, uh, everything, as you said, um, but we immediately dropped that into

[35:58] the children's trust so that I'm not the owner. And, uh, and so you avoid, um, and you don't avoid

[36:06] capital gains on the, uh, arms are state tax on the basis of what you put in there. But you do on all the

[36:13] growth. And so while we've owned this property, it's doubled in value. Um, and so there's hundreds of

[36:20] millions of dollars that have now avoided, uh, a state tax by that being over there. Plus, if someone wants

[36:27] to sue Ramsey, which apparently is a hobby for some people. And, uh, then, then they, uh, you know,

[36:33] that's not on the plate because Ramsey does not own the campus. Ramsey is a Ramsey solutions

[36:39] as a tenant, uh, of the children's trust. And then, you know, same thing if we, we don't a bunch

[36:44] of other real estate because I love real estate like you do. And, um, um, I just buy that and drop it

[36:50] into an LLC. And if it's anything over, uh, 10 million, I drop it into a single standalone LLC so that

[36:56] all risk is associated with that property is contained within that property. And, uh, from a

[37:01] little litigation standpoint, uh, or, or maybe anything else. But, um, and also then that gives us

[37:09] some other estate planning things we can do, uh, with, uh, because partial interest LLCs can,

[37:15] with one of the kids can be, uh, or a kid entity, uh, a trust can be greatly, uh, reduced in,

[37:24] a presyl value, uh, and you can slip more and more of that into the estate plan and not have taxes on it.

[37:30] So we've been doing a bunch of that for 20 years and playing with all this stuff. And that,

[37:35] so the reason was estate taxes and risk management is the only reason is there.

[37:41] Fill us softly. It's all in one lump. Well, that's exactly, and that really teases to the,

[37:47] the heart of it because for sure, the entity structure from a risk protection perspective, then, uh,

[37:51] you know, uh, from a succession planning and avoiding estate taxes later that 100% makes sense.

[37:57] I was curious about the actual team. So like, would the same legal team that does Ramsey stuff

[38:02] do some of these other deals? I asked because this is me selfishly asking because my, you know,

[38:08] my, my estate attorneys, you know, who manage all of that stuff? Um, and I have our M&A attorneys that

[38:14] handle a lot of our, our, our, our deal flow. Um, a lot of times we share, I share the same resources

[38:20] same, same people, um, for things that are, quote, personal versus acquisition.com. Um,

[38:27] and I was curious if you had any like, like basically, if you had had a mistake from that,

[38:31] that I don't know about, I would love to know. No, I have used, uh, I've done both. Uh, so all

[38:38] accounting for the whole thing is in-house. Ramsey accounting team does it. Okay. Taxes

[38:44] are have been an outsourced forever. Anyway, estate planning has been outsourced forever.

[38:51] New-enched litigation has been outsourced forever. Uh, but a little thing, if I need, uh,

[38:58] if I need somebody to look over a lease or, uh, verify that we wrote the L.O.I. up and for doing

[39:03] a, uh, about a piece of property this week. And, uh, you know, with, or I've got it on L.O.I.

[39:08] I don't have a contract. So, uh, you know, well, well, my real estate team, which does not work for Ramsey,

[39:14] run, walk down the hall. They do a sit here, but then we're technically for Ramsey. Okay. They

[39:19] walk down the hall and run it past the general account. Somebody at the general council on the legal

[39:22] team probably. Yeah. Uh, but minor stuff, but pretty quickly, if anything gets, like if you're,

[39:28] if we're rezoning a piece of property, my legal team here does not do that. I've got, that's going

[39:33] to be an outsourced guy. I'm going to bring in a zoning attorney that knows what the flip they're doing.

[39:36] And those everybody at the county that can walk it through, because my guys would be stumbling

[39:40] around not knowing what they're doing down there. General council would be. Man, this, that's super

[39:47] helpful. For those of you who are, you know, further along in the path, like some of this stuff that

[39:50] we're talking about with asset protection and an edistructure, although it's something that you don't,

[39:55] I didn't, I wasn't like, I don't wake up every day, me like, man, I can't wait to learn about

[39:58] asset protection. Uh, but it's, you know, I did not anticipate when I was 64 years old that I would own

[40:06] zero. I don't even own my cars. I don't own anything. Everything is in an LLC and my wife holds the L.L.C.

[40:14] I actually am a very poor individual. You know, we built this again. We referred to it sales

[40:21] times, but we, we love our campus and I'm proud of this property. We've done a good job with it.

[40:26] But when we're sitting on the interstate, a two, six story buildings with big huge Ramsey

[40:31] Solutions signs on them. And I thought, because I'm a real estate guy, I thought, okay, traffic count,

[40:36] that's branding. You know, people going up the interstate, they see Ramsey and they stop in and

[40:41] watch the show here because it's on the glass and it's all this customer interaction and

[40:46] it was like, we're, you know, the stuff we're teaching is working for us. So it's proof text for the

[40:52] customer, right? And it's so it's branding and it's all positive, positive, positive. I had no idea

[40:58] that when you did something like build this building and put it on the interstate that you basically

[41:02] should have put right under the sign, the words, sue me. Or bulls, yeah, that's bulls, I, right?

[41:06] Bulls, I, a little bulls, yeah. Because I think people, some people got from that that this is now a,

[41:13] a, a, a target rich environment. And then we've had to spend, we've had to spend some money

[41:18] convincing them otherwise. Because I don't, I don't do well with this kind of stuff. I really

[41:25] don't negotiate. I'm going to pound you into dirt and I've got some of them that are six and seven

[41:30] years now that I've been, that I've been sitting in court and I'm not going to quit. I'm going to

[41:35] destroy them because I cannot stand the theory that that represents. I can't stand a thief.

[41:43] I love this so much. I could, I could talk probably another hour on this, but I would have pivot

[41:49] for this hit to the audience. Can you walk me through the six stages of scaling that you,

[41:53] that you talk about in the, in your book? Well, we came up with, we're looking for, because the

[41:59] best selling book we've ever done and, and the probably the most known thing in the entire

[42:04] Rimsie brand has been the baby steps. And that was the total money makeover book 12 million copies

[42:08] now. And what we discovered from that, teaching people the seven baby steps, this is what you do

[42:14] if you want to go from broke to wealthy, is when people have a clear path, it gives them hope.

[42:20] And they don't have paralysis of the analysis and they don't have, if you have a clear map

[42:25] to get to Florida, your anxiety goes down if you're on the way to Florida, you know? And if you

[42:32] need a clear path and so I didn't have a clear path running a business and so I'm kind of

[42:37] making it up as I go and I got a lot of bumps and scars and bruises and I went slower than I should

[42:42] have because I didn't know what the next step was. So as we've coached ourselves now through 30

[42:48] plus years and about 10,000 small businesses were observing that businesses go through five stages.

[42:55] It starts with a treadmill stage when you're by yourself, you're so low-prinour,

[42:59] all revenue is based on you, all production is based on you. You don't even really own a business,

[43:05] you just own your job because if you don't work, nothing happens. And so you come home from work

[43:10] and you flop down on the couch, I would when I was at that stage and Sharon said, what you do today?

[43:14] I don't know, but I did a lot of it and I'm exhausted. And so you just run run run run run run

[43:22] and it's if it's to be it's up to me is not a motto, but it is the motto and so man you get her done and that is fun

[43:31] it's invigorating it's a fun time you're still you still believe this business thing is going to be easy because

[43:37] you're naive at that stage, but it's not sustainable. You don't meet 10 year treadmill operators

[43:46] because you run out of breath. It's too hard if you just own your own job. They end up closing going to work for somebody

[43:55] or they end up growing the business. So what do you do to grow? What each of these stages we figured out

[44:00] there's some things you do to level up on that one it's pretty simple time management. You got to do

[44:05] what our friend burger at E-Mith says and that is to work on the business, not just in the business.

[44:10] So you've got to allocate blocks of time, you got to start blocking time and say, I got to work,

[44:15] I got to start thinking about something other than freaking Friday and pay you know and the second thing is

[44:21] I got to learn how to hire people and I got to bring all my first folks and I can delegate to them so that

[44:27] someone is creating production and someone is creating revenue both that is not just me so that if I'm

[44:34] hurt or I'm on vacation or one of my kids is sick and I need to tend to them the whole thing doesn't stop

[44:42] and when you do that you level up, you know, get your first hire you start a little bit of baby

[44:47] delegation here and you get some good time management you go to the Trailblazer stage.

[44:53] Trailblazer is just chaotic. It's crazy. I mean you're trying to herd cats you got 1015 people

[44:59] and they're running in 16 directions nobody knows what nobody's doing but we're doing a whole lot of it

[45:03] and it's communication is is really fun and there's a lot of passion and a lot of zeo it's a

[45:12] good stage I love the Trailblazer stage but again it's eventually so frenetic that eventually

[45:20] you start to go I really want to get a little bit more sophisticated than this because this is killing

[45:24] me and so how do you do that well you start actually doing some planning which is a whole new idea

[45:29] for the tactical person like me because when in doubt I bust something in the nose right,

[45:34] when in doubt I'm a run into the wall let's go do something not if I run into enough times it'll fall

[45:39] over and I just start you know I got to stop being so tactical I got to start thinking about long

[45:43] term I got to start really developing my first layer of leadership inside my team that takes you up to

[45:50] the pathfinder stage or that's pathfinder up to Trailblazer stage Trailblazer stages the middle stage

[45:58] of the five I skipped one and Trailblazer stages the middle stage of the five this is where you actually

[46:03] were first started hearing about strategic thought I'm so straight commission sales guy mentality

[46:12] tactical guy that when someone said we need strategic thought that sounded like corporate America and

[46:17] I went no you should just not go get your work done and so but then I started hiring some guys and

[46:22] gals that at MBAs and they started I think a hundred percent of the MBA programs teach strategic thought

[46:29] as a primary thing and so they start teaching me the values of strategic thought they're like look you

[46:34] don't have to run into the wall if you turn right and then turn left you go around the wall it's a

[46:38] lot less energy burnless colleges calories I'm like how do you know that well I got above it I had

[46:43] a 30,000 foot view I wasn't just looking at the day to day the moment to moment thank god it's

[46:47] Friday oh god it's Monday and so we blow past that and we start actually doing strategic thought so they

[46:54] my MBAs that I hired and other people taught me strategic thought I didn't know it and I always

[46:59] laugh and say I taught them how to work so but you know so we did that and then you moved to pathfinder

[47:05] is the fifth and that's where it's really sweet man your bailing money now everything you got your

[47:10] systems in place the processes in place planning is in place revenue level is here this is around

[47:16] I'm sorry but revenue levels would you like treadmill is like zero to a million you know we we tried to

[47:21] attribute it to that and we could do that with our journey but we really couldn't it changes from

[47:28] industry to industry so if I'm dealing with a guy that's got one heating and air truck and he's fixing

[47:34] he's doing HVAC you know when he gets the 20 trucks and 70 employees is he there I know he could still be

[47:41] he wouldn't be treadmill but that doesn't necessarily mean he's pathfinder versus trailblazer right

[47:47] so because he could still be doing some of the dumb stuff three layers below what it looks like he

[47:52] should be doing and that's what that was mean that's what I did the last stage is what we spent a lot

[47:59] of our time on which is where we are today and that's the legacy stage where you talk a lot

[48:04] about succession what's your in-game how you're going to hand off and you've got a bench depth

[48:09] if the ultimate bench depth is how you're going to replace yourself and and move to the family

[48:15] office mentality as you said and those kinds of things so we walk you through those five stages show

[48:21] you a clear path and then there's six drivers that drive those I won't cover them all right now but

[48:26] you know it starts with personal growth I am the problem and I'm the solution I'm the thing

[48:32] holding the business back at every stage and so I've got to get better at every stage right

[48:38] and uh purpose and people the quality of your hires the quality of your culture the quality of

[48:45] the connectivity and the culture with the core values all those things evolve as you go through the

[48:50] stages and um profit planning and then you just cycle back through the six drivers we think we've

[48:57] been through the six drivers it rams you probably somewhere 10 to 15 times while we went through the five

[49:03] stages because they they change as you you know it's like you read a great book and then four

[49:10] years later you read it again and you're a different person so you see different things and so you

[49:15] changes you go through but that clear path between the six drivers working to get through the five

[49:21] stages has set a bunch of our folks our clients our customers free so we decided to put it into a

[49:26] book and that's what building a business your love is. Well Dave I think we're close to close to

[49:33] time but I want it to a person say thank you for the impact that I think you've made on millions of

[49:39] lives I'm sure you hear it every day but um I just I want to say thank you because I think sometimes

[49:45] when you're when you're at the top you don't you don't hear it as much and so I think it's it's

[49:50] real good stuff. Well thank you brother. No for real and I think your heart is clear I think people see

[50:02] what your intention behind it is. I mean the man owns a $600 million campus in cash.

[50:08] He doesn't need your money. It's nice right but but but he doesn't need it and I think I think it's

[50:16] really cool what you've done. I would love to talk for another hour on even like going from personal

[50:22] finance to you know the entrepreneurship brand but I know our our our time is limited so anyways I

[50:28] want to say thank you again for for for come on the game and I'm sure uh I don't know well definitely

[50:33] definitely have a couple moments of uh PTSD here because some of the stories would have hurt

[50:39] and maybe hopefully avoid future PTSD by uh by taking a ride and then the left very cool well thank you

[50:44] for having me let's do it again. Yeah no awesome thank you. If you enjoyed this conversation there's

[50:48] actually a second uh long form conversation I've had with Dave I had one I think two years ago it's

[50:53] one of the top videos on the channel um that people seem to love and so if you like this you'll love

[50:57] that.

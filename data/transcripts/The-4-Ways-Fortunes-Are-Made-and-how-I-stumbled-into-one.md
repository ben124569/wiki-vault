[00:00] When I was 27 years old, I just sold all of my gems and put all of my money into a new venture and lost all of it.

[00:06] And so I had a thousand and thirty-six dollars when I was 27 years old.

[00:10] Two years later, I'd over $17 million from my bank account and it's because I accidentally stumbled

[00:15] into one of the four ways that fortunes are made.

[00:18] All right, and so one of the key things that we have to understand and we're trying to break down today

[00:21] is one of the different student money and wealth, two, the four types of leverage that exist.

[00:25] And then within those types of leverage, permission and permissionless leverage.

[00:29] And how you can harness those things in your business so that you can make them into things that can build fortunes.

[00:33] So the first thing is understanding what is money, right?

[00:37] Money is simply the way that we transfer wealth from one person to another.

[00:40] All right, that's all it is.

[00:42] It just functions as a medium of transfer.

[00:43] It's actually not in it and of itself valuable.

[00:46] It's valuable in so far is it allows us to require assets, which gets us to the second column, which is wealth.

[00:52] This is what you want.

[00:53] And that's why there's a difference between rich people and wealthy people.

[00:56] Well, is about assets that earn or you sleep, meaning that you don't have to trade any time

[01:01] to have these assets make you money.

[01:03] And so one of the things that I think I got from Taylor Wash was,

[01:08] poor people do the wrong things, rich people do the right things,

[01:12] wealthy people own the right things.

[01:14] And so as you're transitioning through life, you have to think about am I, am I something to do the right thing?

[01:18] Or am I something to try to own the right things?

[01:21] And so for example, lawyers, doctors, accountants,

[01:25] they can never really make crazy money.

[01:28] They cannot get wealthy super wealthy unless they transition from being a practitioner or

[01:34] they're turning time for dollars into owning an entire practice of lots of doctors working for them,

[01:38] which means they then they have created an asset which then generates wealth while they sleep, right?

[01:42] It's a giant money while they sleep, which is what makes it into wealth.

[01:44] All right.

[01:45] And so if you look over the last hundreds of years, we're talking 500,000 plus years,

[01:50] fortunes have been made in four ways.

[01:52] In the beginning, so this is then, the first way was through labor, all right?

[01:57] And the reason labor is the first way of gaining leverage is because there was no other way of getting it.

[02:01] That's why the kings and queens had hundreds and hundreds of servants.

[02:04] That's how the pyramids were built.

[02:05] Right? That's how Rockefeller was able to build his oil across the United States, right?

[02:10] It was through labor, right?

[02:12] And so because of that, he didn't have to trade his own time for dollars.

[02:14] He was able to buy other people's time, right?

[02:17] Now labor is the hardest type of leverage to employ.

[02:20] I don't impress your parents, but he won't actually.

[02:22] It's one of the hardest things to employ anybody who knows who has 50,

[02:25] hundred, 500 plus employees understands that it's one of the hardest things to employ,

[02:29] but it is one of the things, one of the four ways of gaining leverage.

[02:32] And one of the key tendons of these first two,

[02:34] as that these are permission-based leverage.

[02:36] You need other people's permission.

[02:38] You need to appease others in order to use this type of leverage.

[02:42] The second type of leverage, which is also still permission-based,

[02:46] is capital, right?

[02:48] That's money.

[02:49] Specifically, other people's money.

[02:51] And so just an example of what capital is,

[02:53] is let's say I want to buy something that doubles in value over five years.

[03:00] All right? And let's say I get somebody to give me 100% of the money to buy this thing, right?

[03:04] And so after five years, I have to repay the person back,

[03:08] but that thing doubled in value, right?

[03:10] So let's say he was a $1,000 dollars when I bought it from someone else's money.

[03:13] And then it's $200 after five years.

[03:15] Well, I have to pay back the $100 plus some interest,

[03:18] but then everything else I get to keep.

[03:20] And so that is a type of capital where, if you think about how much my returns were,

[03:24] they're basically infinite because I didn't put any money down, right?

[03:27] And that is why capital has been the second main way that fortunes were built.

[03:32] This is where the newer billionaires get newer,

[03:34] but still old now, billionaires were created.

[03:36] This is the Buffets, this is the Munger, this is the Carl icons of the world,

[03:40] who made their wealth through financing and using other people's money as leverage.

[03:45] Both of these things, you have to ask for permission.

[03:47] People have to give you the money to have to,

[03:49] you have to take that money under terms under which your coins you give it back, right?

[03:54] Now, the new way of creating wealth, there are two of them,

[03:58] and they are permissionless, all right?

[04:00] So here you don't need any permission in order to use these things.

[04:04] And that is what the new fortunes are being made of.

[04:06] The first is through code, all right?

[04:09] So this is all the big software companies that you see, the tech giants that exist,

[04:14] they use code for permissionless leverage,

[04:18] because with code, it costs zero dollars to have an additional person consume or get utility

[04:24] from what the code does, right?

[04:26] And so if you have a piece of software that's a CRM, adding 100 users or adding 1000 users,

[04:32] cost you no additional amount for that one more user, right?

[04:36] And so that is why code is one of the things that's created fortunes in the present day.

[04:40] Now, if you're like, well, Alex, I don't know how to write code.

[04:43] Well, then let me tell you the fourth way, which is the one that I accidentally stumbled in,

[04:47] when I switched my business from a service-based business, which was just selling other people's

[04:51] time to a media business, which was number four, which is media.

[04:57] Now, if you think about the type things that exist out there, Zuckerberg, he's media.

[05:02] He sells eyeballs.

[05:03] He sells impressions, Google sells impressions.

[05:05] They sell media, right?

[05:07] Bloomberg, he was old school media.

[05:09] So he was the news.

[05:10] He was radio all that kind of stuff.

[05:11] All of that was in his network.

[05:13] And the beautiful thing about that is that when you have media,

[05:16] you have a calculator amount of eyeballs.

[05:18] You can continually sell those eyeballs.

[05:19] And as they grow, you just continue to sell them in a custom note incremental amount.

[05:23] And so the gross margin in this are basically 100%.

[05:26] There's no added cost.

[05:27] As you've heard me talk about having good margins in a business,

[05:30] these are the ways that you get the exceptional gold class margins,

[05:33] which is what builds fortunes, right?

[05:35] And so for me, when I transitioned my company from doing a done for your service,

[05:39] raised to fly out as a sales team and fill up locations of brick and mortar facilities,

[05:44] to licensing media, I was able to sell it zero incremental cost.

[05:48] And because of that, my margins with it, the roof, and that was enabled me to acquire money,

[05:52] which I was able to transfer into wealth.

[05:54] All right.

[05:55] Now, if you're thinking right now, like, well, there's some places like,

[05:57] you know, it is Google code or media.

[05:59] The answer is yes, it's both.

[06:01] And so if you can employ multiple types of leverage,

[06:04] then you juice the returns even more.

[06:05] And so that's why all the superwelf that is being created,

[06:08] a lot of times it's using two or three of these types of things.

[06:11] They're taking other people's money to get other people's labor to write the code

[06:15] that then they sell as media once they acquire all of the eyeballs.

[06:18] And that's the winner takes all games that are existing right now.

[06:21] But right now, I feel like, well, I don't know how to write code.

[06:23] Well, that's okay. I don't either.

[06:25] And so that's where we take things like this YouTube channel.

[06:28] This is why Joe Rogan can sell his podcast for $100 million,

[06:33] or so you can sell ad space because he owns media.

[06:35] And so right now, this is where you can create blogs for no money.

[06:38] You can create YouTube videos for no money.

[06:40] You can anything, you can make podcasts for no money.

[06:43] All of these things you can do as media to distribute

[06:47] at zero incremental cost.

[06:48] And that is how fortunes are built.

[06:50] And over time, as you can see, it gets, I want to say, easier to build fortunes,

[06:55] which is why now is the best time to be alive out of any time.

[06:58] Can you imagine a time where you, there weren't just fun,

[07:00] you couldn't just raise capital, you couldn't just have a credit investors

[07:03] that you could call up.

[07:04] These things didn't exist.

[07:05] It was just the time of labor.

[07:07] It was the time of pyramids, right?

[07:09] But as time has progressed, the ways to build fortunes have increased.

[07:12] And the level of permission that's required has decreased.

[07:16] Right? If you are the best coder in the world, you can build something that no one else can build.

[07:19] If you are the absolute best at providing value at capturing attention,

[07:23] then you can do this and you can create your fortune with no one's permission.

[07:27] And that's the beauty of being alive today.

[07:28] And so if you're looking about your own business and you're thinking about,

[07:31] how can I make my business more valuable?

[07:33] Try and tap into one of these four types of leverage because if you do that,

[07:37] I guarantee you will make more money and you'll have a chance at building one of these super fortunes.

[07:40] And I was very fortunate to have stumbled into this fourth one.

[07:43] And now I look for it deliberately.

[07:46] So, hope you found that valuable.

[07:47] And as valuable as it was for me when I started thinking about this stuff,

[07:51] and I'll see you in the next video.

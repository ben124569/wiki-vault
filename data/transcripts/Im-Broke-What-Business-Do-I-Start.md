[00:00] So if your broke or you don't know what business to start, by the end of this video, you will know

[00:04] what business to start, who you're going to serve, how you're going to serve them, and the exact

[00:07] message to send to get your first five customers. I'm a co-enter of school.com where we help

[00:12] tens of thousands of new people every single month start their first business online and right now

[00:18] one out of two people who start a paid community on school make their first dollar. One out of two,

[00:24] this process I'm going to show you works. So there's five parts of this framework and then two

[00:28] bonuses. One is that's advanced and one that I'll give you next step on what to do with this so you

[00:32] can make your first dollar. So it starts with the what, which is what is your business actually going

[00:37] to be about? And so I use something called the three piece framework. All right, so you can write this down

[00:42] the three piece and that's because almost all businesses get born of one of these three piece.

[00:48] And the first is pain. So it's something that you went through personally and had to overcome. So a front of

[00:57] mine has a wife while they're married and they have nine kids. And so in her going through this process,

[01:04] she was like, well, what would it work for me? And I'm like, well, you have nine kids. So I'll bet

[01:08] you that you just making lunch for nine kids every day is probably a process. She's like, oh, yeah,

[01:14] I have this whole thing that I do, so I organize this with everybody has their own bags and they all

[01:18] know who it is. And then I can do it in a time that's cheap for me and gets them all the food that

[01:22] you know, all the protein and all the other stuff. And she's like, I have a system around that.

[01:26] And I was like, that is the beginning of the business. The second is your profession.

[01:32] Meaning what you do for a day job or what you've done in the past. I've recently made a video about

[01:37] a lady who quit her job as a registered dietitian at a hospital and then started teaching

[01:42] other registered dietitians how to build insurance. And the reason that she learned how to do that was

[01:47] at the hospital, she had to work six days a week and work 12 plus hours per day as an R.D.

[01:53] And so she only had one day a week that she could build her personal clients on the side. And so

[01:58] she had to figure out this really complex billing system and how to do it really quickly. And so

[02:02] she took something that she learned from her profession and made a business around something really,

[02:06] really narrow. And so a lot of people think that it's got to be this big, crazy thing. If you

[02:10] solve one very specific problem for somebody, that is a business. And you might think, oh, well,

[02:16] how am I going to get a huge following from all that? This particular individual has 58,

[02:20] 100 people who follow an Instagram and you take some almost a million dollars a year in income.

[02:25] And so if you're an accountant or you do HR or you edit videos or you do whatever. Like every

[02:32] single job that exists in a business means that fundamentally people exchange money for the

[02:37] skill you have. And so any professional still that you do in a business, you can do as a consultant

[02:44] or as an independent contractor or teaching other people in that profession. There's lots of

[02:48] tree branches that come off of that. But this is the second big category that businesses are born

[02:53] from. The third bucket of peas is passion. These are the things that you're always interested in.

[03:00] These are the articles you read. These are the YouTube videos you watch. These are the podcast

[03:03] that you listen to in your spare time. It's the stuff that you're just inherently interested in.

[03:07] That you like can't get enough of. And so for me personally, I was somebody who was

[03:12] indefinite. It was what I was reading. I was reading T-Nation, which none of you guys have

[03:16] heard of. But it was this blog online that had all of the lifters in there and all these

[03:20] trainers and coaches that were talking about stuff. And every night, I would eat my meal and I would

[03:24] read whatever the new T-Nation articles were. And I did that every single night. And that's what my

[03:28] passion was. And when I went to work, the guys that I worked with are like, dude, if you don't start

[03:32] a gym, like they offered to front me the money to start the gym because I was so obsessed with fitness

[03:37] at the time. And so if you're like, okay, well, I overcame food allergies or I am an accountant or

[03:43] I'm into painting model cars. Got it. But how am I going to turn that into a business? Don't

[03:48] worry. That's what I'm covering instead of five. So let me break this belief for you really quickly.

[03:52] That you need to get the perfect pick on the first try. The reason this isn't accurate is that

[03:58] it assumes that you with zero context having not talked to customers and gotten zero feedback or

[04:04] are going to pick it right. The reality of it is that picking anything is the first step because

[04:10] that begins the iteration process of feedback. So that you can get it right. So the five-step

[04:16] process I'm going to walk you through is going to get you to your best bad idea as fast as possible.

[04:21] And the reason we say best bad idea is that we want to get it out there so that we can

[04:25] make it less wrong over time. And if you keep making a bad idea, less wrong, eventually it becomes a

[04:31] good idea. And then people say, how did you pick that right on the first shot? And you will smile

[04:36] and know that that's not actually how it worked. So great. If you have your first pee, you say,

[04:40] I know what pain it is or what profession it or what passion. Now we move on to step two, which is

[04:46] the who. So who are you going to do this what for? There's three categories that the who's

[04:52] are going to fit into. The first is people like you. The second is people that you have helped

[04:57] before. And that can be for money or not for money. But I'm assuming you're watching this video that

[05:01] you haven't helped them for money. You just did it as a favor, which I'll tell you my story about

[05:05] that in a second. And the third is people who you think are underserved. Now this is probably

[05:09] the more formal way that people look at markets that are growing, that you think there's an emerging

[05:15] trend. It's people that have this huge demand in their underserved. This is probably the most

[05:19] formal way of doing it. But most businesses that come from, I would say, the heart or the mind

[05:23] come from one of these two things. It's I went through this thing and then I took a long time to figure

[05:28] it out. And now that I have figured it out, I want to help other people who are like me figured out.

[05:32] Sarah Blakely was like, man, none of these underwear like, you know, hide the, hide the bad and

[05:37] show the good. And so then she created Spanks and then Spanks went on to sell for a billion dollars

[05:43] to Blacks. And I think earlier last year. And so you can absolutely build a massive business.

[05:48] Just trying to solve a very personal problem to yourself. differently, Zuck started in his dorm room

[05:55] to make some sort of platform for horny college kids that eventually would become Facebook or

[06:00] for me specifically the reason I made my first dollar, the first actual dollar that I ever made

[06:05] was there was a lady at the gym. And she said, she came to me and said, hey, can you help me with my

[06:10] food? And it was just because I looked in shape. And I was like, sure. And like I didn't know

[06:14] her super well. And so we met at a pizza shop ironically. And so she asked me to talk to her about

[06:20] her food. And so I just asked her which was buying for groceries and gave her a couple, you know,

[06:23] recipes that I did the increase of protein intake. And at the end of me sitting at that pizza

[06:27] parlor with her for like an hour and a half, she just took out her purse and wrote on a check

[06:32] a hundred dollars and she handed it to me. I didn't sell her. I didn't say it price. She just handed

[06:37] me a hundred dollars for the amount of help that I'd given her. And it was really weird because

[06:41] we walked out of the pizza parlor and she got in her car and I like opened up the check again.

[06:45] And I was like, holy shit, I could get paid to do this. And it was this huge moment for me.

[06:50] And forever, always grateful, Sandy Smith. So once you figured out whether it's someone like you,

[06:55] someone you've helped before or under-served market, you pick one of these three things and then you

[07:00] plug them into this, which is a call out. And so the call out describes the person back to them.

[07:06] This is going to be important for what we use in one of the later parts of this. That's why if I had

[07:10] to pick one for you, I would have it be this one because you already know what it's like to have the

[07:15] pains of this person. You're usually in the demographic, you have you're in the age group. And so you

[07:20] probably know a lot of the aspirations and dreams that they do rather than have into the

[07:24] research. So this is the quick and dirty way and many, many, many businesses are started this way.

[07:29] And in my opinion, this tends to make mercenaries, this tends to make missionaries. And so what I mean

[07:37] by that is people who start purely based on analyzing markets and trends and things like that,

[07:42] they're like, they're in it for the money, they don't really care about the product or even the

[07:45] customer. But if you're helping people like you overcome something that you overcame before,

[07:49] you know their pain and you will care that much more to deliver an exceptional product and improve their

[07:54] experience over time. And I think this is what keeps you in it for the long call. And when you look at

[07:58] some of the biggest companies out there in the world, many of them started with a founder and a garage

[08:03] with some problem that they hated and then tried to fix. So let me draw this on a new page to give you

[08:08] a really clear idea of why this next part is important. If you're just like people like me,

[08:15] that's not descriptive enough to get really clear on the avatar. And so I think about it as having

[08:20] five kind of frames that I think through to narrow down my avatar. I've got the age, gender,

[08:27] profession, like before because if you are going to use profession, then you might as well say it,

[08:31] got their problems or their pains and then we've got their interests or passions. And you'll

[08:36] notice these are more or less the three piece from before. Okay? And so what we do is you want to pick

[08:42] three. And so let me give you an example. So if I'm looking for a 35 year old men,

[08:49] it's not narrow enough, right? Or if I just sit 35 year olds, not narrow enough. 35 year old men,

[08:54] who were a countenance. Now I can get even narrower by adding more, but you have to have at least three.

[09:00] You want to do three or more. So 35 year old male accountants who are bored at their jobs.

[09:07] Right? Great. Well, that's a pretty clear avatar. If I say that, and there's a room full of 35

[09:12] year old male accounts or bored at their jobs, and that was in the other room, that other room should

[09:18] light you up. So think about it this way from visual perspective. If you could fill a room with

[09:23] just a certain type of person that you get excited to go in there and help them, what is that

[09:28] room of people look like? What are they interested in? What are the problems they're suffering from?

[09:33] What's their job? Now, you could do the same thing and not have the profession, but I'll give you an

[09:38] example. So if I said 35 year old or 45 year old women, who are struggling to move up in the workplace.

[09:45] Okay? That's at least three. Get the idea. So you just want to get narrow enough that they know

[09:51] you're talking to them. Let me break a second belief for you that if you get really narrow,

[09:55] it means you're not going to be able to make it as much money because you know as many people

[09:58] to sell to. The other part of that is the more specific you get, the more you can charge.

[10:03] So let me tell you something that might blow your mind. So if I sold time management as my thing,

[10:09] that's really really broad. All right, that's my one. Okay? Well, I might be able to charge

[10:15] for my time management PDF. I don't know. 19 bucks. Okay? Now, if I said, I've got a time management

[10:22] product for salespeople, then all of a sudden, this is probably $199 product.

[10:29] If I said, I've time management for outbound salespeople, then that's going to be even more specific.

[10:35] And this might be a 1999 product. And if I said, I have the entire outbound time management system

[10:43] for garden and power tools, then this could be a $10,000 thing. Because anybody who's this

[10:52] specific with their niche knows that they're going to be able to make a couple sales with this new

[10:58] system and more than pay for it. And so as you get more specifically with your prospect,

[11:02] you can get more premium with your price. And if you're the best at time management sales for

[11:08] outbound saleswrap that do garden and power tools, how many competitors are you going against?

[11:13] Almost no one. And so you're selling in a total blue ocean, where it's just you with the

[11:19] life raft and all of them are in there in the pool around you struggling. And then when you have

[11:24] your lifecraft and you're the only boat in town, they've got to pay whatever you want in order

[11:29] to scoop them out of the water. If you're enjoying this process, I run something called the school

[11:33] games, so you can go to school.com for such games. You can start for free. I'll help you build

[11:37] your first business by taking you through frameworks like this and many others and give you the

[11:42] platform to do it to make your first dollar. Right now, more than one out of two people who

[11:46] start the school games with a paid community, make their first dollar online. Very proud of it.

[11:51] So if you like that, go check it out and start for free. So that's step two, that's the who.

[11:55] Now we go to the how. And there's two parts to the how. So let's cover those now. So with how

[12:01] part one, we think about the upside. This is all the good stuff that you're going to help them

[12:07] achieve or experience as a result of using your thing. All right. So you want to think about how

[12:13] much easier their lives are going to be as a result of using your thing. You want to think about how

[12:18] guaranteed the outcome is now as a result of using your thing. You want to think about much faster

[12:25] they're going to be able to get what they want using your thing. And you want to be able to

[12:29] describe to them how it would feel to experience their dream scenario. And so if these look familiar,

[12:35] these are the four elements of the value equation, but written in the positive. And so the perfect

[12:40] offer is something that is incredibly easy guaranteed to happen immediate and is exactly what they want.

[12:48] And the subpartum this is exactly the way they want to get it. I'll give you a beat of be

[12:53] example from Jim Lunch. So the average Jim makes $30,000 in their first 30 days using the Jim Lunch

[12:59] system. Now the average Jim owner makes $36,000 a year and take home income. So if they make

[13:06] $36,000 a year as take home income, then we can help them get what they want easier,

[13:11] guaranteed, faster, and exactly what they want to do, which was to fill their Jim up and make money.

[13:16] Whatever benefits you sell, there's some good stuff. And so we want to say, hey, here's all this

[13:21] good stuff you want. And here's how I make it easier, faster, guaranteed. And this is what it looks like

[13:27] when it's right. That's what we explained with the how part one. So now that we've listed out

[13:32] all the good stuff, let's flip over to how part two, which is going to be the bad stuff. And if you

[13:38] think about motivating an individual in general, you fundamentally only have two things that are

[13:43] going to increase the likelihood that they do what you want. You either have to take away the

[13:47] bad stuff that they don't want or give them more good stuff that they want. That's it. That's all you

[13:53] can do. And so thinking about it from this framework has helped me show much in copyrighting and

[13:57] sales is like, you're either saying you're going to get this thing or you're going to avoid

[14:00] this thing you hate. That's it. And it's just how well you can describe either of these things,

[14:05] which makes it more and more compelling, which is why picking someone like you makes it easier to

[14:10] describe the very intricacies of their pain. So for example, if I said, lose weight fast, that might

[14:15] have worked in the 1900s. But people quickly learn that they can't believe things that people say.

[14:21] And so the more specific you are about the pain and the benefit, the more likely they are to

[14:26] believe you. If I say, hey, stop feeling your thighs chafing when you're out in the sun,

[14:32] that's a very specific pain. And so someone will be like, oh, I experienced that. But it would

[14:37] pass their guardrails and their banner blindness around ads and copy and marketing because it's

[14:42] very specific to their pain. You want them to be like, I can't believe they know this about me

[14:46] because you know it about you and you just describe it back to them. So now we're going to talk

[14:50] about the bad stuff. So these are the inverse of the things that I was mentioning earlier. So instead

[14:56] of the guarantee, we're going to talk about the risks that we're going to help them avoid.

[15:03] Instead of how fast it is, we're going to talk about how slow it is for them that they're not

[15:08] going to have to experience that slowness. Instead of it being easy, we're going to talk about

[15:14] all the pain and sacrifice and suffering that they have to go through in order to experience the

[15:21] benefit. So the nice thing with this one particularly because there's going to be the most meat here

[15:26] in terms of what you're describing. Because the guarantee you just say, this is where you

[15:29] state stats and you show what you've done, what you plan to do. The fast and easy you put a time line

[15:34] around it and what they can expect versus the timeline of what's bad. And with the ease, there's

[15:39] two sides to this. So one is what are all the good things they normally have to give up that they

[15:46] no longer have to give up with your system and what are all the bad things that they would normally

[15:52] have to start doing with other products or other services to solve this problem that with your

[15:57] product they don't have to start doing. So let me give you an example. So weight loss is simple.

[16:02] So if I have to start working out and waking up early, that's something bad I don't want to

[16:10] start doing. And so if you use my system, you don't have to start doing this bad thing you don't

[16:15] want to do to get the result. If I want to avoid the negative thing that you don't want to give up,

[16:20] which is, hey, you like doing Taco Tuesdays and eating out with your friends, normally you have to

[16:24] give that up. But with my system, you can keep that thing you like without sacrificing it and still

[16:29] get the result. And so you show both of these that make it easier because what makes things hard,

[16:34] what makes things hard is doing things we don't like and giving up things we like. And so if we have

[16:39] our solution that they can not have to do things they hate and keep doing things they love, then they

[16:44] will like that better. You might be thinking, okay, well I get the good stuff in the bad stuff

[16:48] for how part one and how part two, but how do I get all this stuff? Well first off, if it's you,

[16:52] then you know what these pains are. If it's not you, then you do the three letter method. You're ready for it.

[17:00] Ask people who you want to sell. So you get on the phone, you reach out to people, and you basically

[17:05] do an interview. Now a good interview basically functions like a sales call, which is like

[17:09] what are the problems you're struggling with right now? How long have you struggled with them?

[17:12] What makes it painful specifically? Can you describe what the experience is like when it's not

[17:17] could you describe your ideal experience if it were done the right way? What are some of the things you

[17:21] have to stop doing that you like doing that you don't want to stop doing when you've done things in the past?

[17:25] What are the things that you have to start doing that you hate doing that you've had to start doing in the past?

[17:30] And either of those scenarios and all of those scenarios you're learning more about the

[17:33] customer you're learning about their dreams and aspirations, but the pains that they've experienced

[17:36] along the way. And the culmination of all of those answers become how part one and how part two. The

[17:42] good stuff you're going to help them get and the best stuff you're going to help them avoid. And if you're

[17:45] still wondering how am I going to make money from all this stuff? Don't worry we're going to get there right now.

[17:49] Step five putting it all together combined. So this is the Mr. Miyagi moment in Crodicid where you've been

[17:56] waxing on and waxing off this entire time so you can get to the moment where you can finally get your car.

[18:01] So we're going to do a Moshi Money Madeline. We're going to drop everything in. So I help

[18:06] who, which we got from Step two, which is the combination of what the big things about and then

[18:11] narrowing it down through Step one and Step two, I help who 35-year-old male countenance get a new

[18:17] income stream, whatever the good thing that they want is, which is how part one without how part two,

[18:25] the bad stuff, through and this is going to be the bonus item and cover in a second.

[18:30] All right, which is something called a unique mechanism. All right so I'll cover that in a moment.

[18:35] But fundamentally you could ignore this last part and this is the basic version of it and this is the

[18:40] more advanced one once you get some reps and the reason I'm going to explain that one in a second is

[18:44] because if you haven't done it you don't have a unique process. And so if you're just starting out this

[18:49] is me meeting you where you're at. I help who get good stuff without bad stuff. I help 45-year-old women

[18:56] who just had kids get into high school get back into their high school jeans without giving up time

[19:02] with their family. I help nonfiction business authors get on the Wall Street Journal best seller

[19:09] with out looking cringe. And listen, it doesn't have to be like you don't have to perfectly do this every time.

[19:14] I could just say I help young guy starting school for the first time pick their community under 30 minutes.

[19:20] Like it's just if you can nail them then the person's like shoot that's me. Right? The more you add these pieces in

[19:26] like that's exactly what I'm struggling with. This is exactly what I want and then the unique mechanism

[19:31] makes it nice and sexy. So now that we hit the bonus let's go to the bonus section.

[19:35] So the bonus number one is going to be something called the unique mechanism. All right.

[19:40] Now the reason I wanted to combine it before the unique mechanism is that if you are starting out you

[19:45] might not have a unique process yet. All right. But the unique mechanism is something that differentiates

[19:50] your solution from other people's. So if there's two people in your market or 10 or 100 people in your

[19:56] market one you could probably go narrower on your who and the problem you're trying to help them solve.

[20:00] But let's assume that you did that and there's still 10 people that all help 35-year-old male

[20:05] countets watch friends reruns because that's your passion without feeling the judgment of other

[20:12] people because you have a cool streaming platform or you know access between all these other ones

[20:16] that allow them to do it for free. Whatever. Okay. So let's say that that's your niche and there's

[20:20] 10 other people who are serving them. What you want to have is some unique mechanism. And this is

[20:25] not a new marketing concept. You want to have some sexiestness or some special sauce that makes

[20:32] the prospect thing oh I'm going to push all of my hopes and dreams into this process. Like if I had

[20:38] only had this special sexy thing I was six inches away from gold and then I just needed this thing

[20:43] to get me over the hump. And the point is that that's what they should feel like. Oh if I just had

[20:47] this thing all along I would have already been successful. So it's like you have this secret that you

[20:51] can help them be successful with and the proof is in the pudding. And so even if you think about this

[20:57] YouTube video as a product if you wanted to, the unique mechanism is the five step process or the

[21:02] five step niche narrowing the niche narrowing, none chuck, right? Because it's a fucking boxed in the head.

[21:08] So let me explain how this works. Is that you're going to either have a list or steps that someone

[21:14] has to follow to achieve results. Fundamentally that's what it is. You're either going to say you have

[21:17] to do all these things. So just think of checklist. Like once you have done all four of these things

[21:22] you'll achieve the outcome or you have to follow this in sequence. You have to do one and then you

[21:27] have to do two and you have to do three and then four. The difference here is that these don't have to

[21:31] be in order. You have to do them all. Here you have to do them in a specific sequence. But either way

[21:35] you're going to have a list or a step or a series of steps that someone's going to follow and then

[21:39] all you do is that you wrap this whole thing and then you name it. Because this becomes your proprietary

[21:49] process and that proprietary process becomes your unique mechanism. If you've heard me talk about

[21:55] content we have promise, proof plan. And so it's hey I'm going to help you pick your niche by the

[22:01] end of this video. proof is that I've held tens of thousands of people do this on schools or pretty

[22:05] good at it and then the plan is we're going to follow these five steps to die and here we are. And so

[22:10] that process we can call the Mozi Money niche method whatever. So if you've heard of P90X the

[22:17] unique mechanism they had was muscle confusion. And obviously a zillion fitness influencers

[22:22] like there's no such thing as muscle confusion and they're right. But the thing is it was unique

[22:26] mechanism and they sold hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars a thinnest

[22:30] programs using it. If you look at weight watchers they have a point system the point systems

[22:34] they're unique mechanism. If you look at some of these other ones they have their XYZ portion control

[22:39] thing. Like they all have a unique mechanism their way of doing it. Think of this as the vehicle.

[22:44] This is going to take them from where they are to where they want to go and you're the one who's

[22:48] piloting this ship with them in the back seat or their piloting it with you in the back seat with

[22:54] you as the guide. The point is is that that becomes the special sauce and everybody should do this.

[22:59] And that's where you can have the naming conventions I cover naming stuff in my last chapter here

[23:03] on the offers book where I either like something that rhymes or I like a literation if I can

[23:08] if I can do it. So as promised if you're following this process then you got the what which helped

[23:14] you narrow down the who you followed the steps in that to niche down to figure out very specifically

[23:18] who the avatar was someone like you so many help before or someone who's underserved we did the good

[23:23] stuff we looked at the bad stuff we put it all together into one sentence so you can immediately use it

[23:27] if you're a little more advanced then you figure out what unique mechanism or your system or your

[23:31] process your method to put it all together so they're like wow this is exactly what I need.

[23:35] So what's this last bonus? Well I said I'd help you get your first five customers. So let's do that.

[23:40] All right so I'm going to give you the absolute simplest system for getting your first five

[23:43] customers using what we just had. And so what you do is you will greet someone greetings hello

[23:50] you'll mention something specific about them that's a compliment you'll insert that sentence that we

[23:54] just went up with came up with and then you'll ask them if they know anybody who could benefit

[23:59] from that and you will do this for four hours per day or until you reach a hundred.

[24:09] I don't care which you can do four hours a day or until you reach a hundred and if you do this every day

[24:14] and you make this process what you reach out to people you will get five customers.

[24:20] I align this entire process inside of the lead's book in the first chapter called warm outreach

[24:24] to help you get your first five customers and if you'd like me to help you lead along and you want to

[24:28] do it via community you can go to school dot com for slash games I walk people I literally walk

[24:33] thousands of people through this every single month so we're pretty good at it like I said

[24:37] more than one out of two people make their first dollar line so um take it out.

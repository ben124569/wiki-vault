## Full Transcript
[00:00] When I was 17, I made $6 an hour.

[00:01] When I was 21, I got to $25 an hour.

[00:03] When I was 23, I got to $250 an hour.

[00:05] When I was 26, I got to $25 an hour,

[00:08] but I got to $18 an hour.

[00:10] And so in this video, I'll show you three ways

[00:11] to 10X here income.

[00:12] So the first way is through something called arbitrage.

[00:16] And so arbitrage is just a fancy word

[00:18] that means buying and selling between two different markets

[00:21] and capitalizing on the difference in price for the same asset.

[00:25] Now, there's a lot of ways that you can arbitrage.

[00:27] So this applies for both businesses and employees.

[00:30] Entire financial sectors,

[00:31] almost built on arbitrage, which is,

[00:33] can I buy a stock for a certain price

[00:36] and then sell it later?

[00:37] And that's where you have options trading

[00:39] and all these other types of things

[00:41] that banks and financial institutions will make hundreds

[00:44] of billions of dollars a year on.

[00:46] So number one, on a personal level,

[00:48] you can buy cheap locally wherever you're at.

[00:52] And then sell whatever you have,

[00:54] like your services, even, two more expensive market,

[00:57] which is why the number one money-making skill in 2024

[01:01] is English.

[01:02] And so if you live in a foreign country

[01:04] and you live in Thailand, you live in Malaysia,

[01:06] you live in Vietnam, whatever.

[01:07] You have something where it's very cheap to live.

[01:10] And then you can sell your services globally

[01:14] at the most expensive market,

[01:16] which would be probably Europe and the US.

[01:18] Then you could in a real way have this big arbitrage

[01:21] between what you make and what you spend.

[01:24] And so for example, in Thailand,

[01:26] the median income is about $2,700 per year.

[01:30] And so if you can sell your services

[01:32] even at the US median income,

[01:34] which is closer to like $50 or $60,000,

[01:36] you're looking at more than a 10x increase

[01:40] between what you make and what you spend.

[01:42] And wealth, which a lot of people don't understand,

[01:44] wealth is a ratio, it's not a number.

[01:46] It's how much you spend relative to how much you make.

[01:48] So you can make $50,000 a month or $500,000 a month.

[01:51] If you spend more than that, you're going to feel poor.

[01:54] Now if you make $5,000 a month and you spend $500,

[01:57] you're going to feel rich because you always have more

[01:59] than enough.

[01:59] And the key about wealth is having more than you need.

[02:02] And so you can either make more or need less.

[02:04] So let me show you this to you visually.

[02:06] So personally, right?

[02:08] You have a couple options.

[02:10] So one is your income stays the same,

[02:14] but you decrease your expenses by moving

[02:21] geographies.

[02:21] So you change where you live.

[02:23] The other way is that you can live somewhere

[02:27] that's normal.

[02:28] It depends on where you're starting.

[02:30] And then sell to a different geography overall.

[02:35] Now again, there's an interesting story that I'll tell you.

[02:38] When I had my really nice mention in Austin, this is years ago,

[02:43] I noticed that when people came to my house

[02:45] to bid services, I was like, I feel like this is way more

[02:47] expensive than a comparable service that I've paid for in the past.

[02:51] And then I started talking to my neighbors about it.

[02:53] And they were like, oh, that's just called the zip code

[02:54] tax.

[02:55] And I was like, what does that mean?

[02:55] They're like, you have a nice house.

[02:57] People will just raise the prices because they know you

[02:59] can afford it.

[03:00] And I was like, oh, well, that sucks.

[03:03] And so I learned about that.

[03:06] Now I'll tell you a real example of a company

[03:08] that I had actually invested in.

[03:09] So I live in a high-rise building now.

[03:12] And there was a guy who met me in the elevator.

[03:15] And he literally elevator pitched me for his business idea.

[03:19] And I thought the business idea was actually really interesting.

[03:22] He had a prototype.

[03:23] He pulled it up on his phone.

[03:23] Literally, I mean, I live high-ups.

[03:25] So there's a decent amount of time in the elevator.

[03:27] And I ended up going to dinner with him.

[03:29] And I ended up investing in the business.

[03:31] And it's actually one of our portfolio companies.

[03:33] And so I asked him though, because I knew

[03:35] what the revenue the business was, I was like,

[03:37] how can you afford to live here?

[03:39] And he said, I can't afford not to live here,

[03:41] because I get to meet people like you.

[03:43] And so he was way living above his means.

[03:46] But the arbitrage that he was basically getting into

[03:48] is network arbitrage.

[03:50] Is that he was basically overpaying to have access

[03:53] to the best people who had the most money

[03:55] in that specific market.

[03:57] And I still, I'm not the biggest fan of that,

[03:59] because it's so risky.

[04:01] But he ended up funding his entire growth

[04:04] of the software company based on people

[04:07] that he met in our building.

[04:08] And so I find that kind of interesting.

[04:10] And he ended up proving it out

[04:12] in the companies actually really successful.

[04:13] So it's definitely one of those I wouldn't do it this way,

[04:16] but people have done it.

[04:17] And it obviously worked.

[04:18] And so these personal income things,

[04:20] I still think completely applied to business,

[04:22] because the only way you can go aggressive in business

[04:26] is being able to reinvest capital as you grow.

[04:28] And if you're just making income,

[04:30] the amount of capital that you have to get aggressive

[04:32] with is proportional to what you make versus what you spend.

[04:35] And so it's like if you don't know how to make more,

[04:38] just spend way less.

[04:39] Like when I started that, my first gym,

[04:42] I was first living on the floor.

[04:44] But even before that one I made the transition,

[04:46] when I wasn't sure where I was gonna have

[04:48] the gym, I lived in a spare better $400 a month.

[04:51] And so like, I bring this up because it's not like

[04:54] I was bawling out.

[04:55] And mind you, I had money saved up.

[04:56] I had $50,000 saved up, and I was making it

[04:58] at the time about $4,000 a month from training people online

[05:03] before I made my transition to my gym.

[05:04] And so I say this to say like,

[05:06] I strongly encourage you to employ some level of arbitrage

[05:11] within your life, either in your business

[05:13] or personally or both.

[05:15] And you can do that geographically,

[05:16] you can do it via network,

[05:17] or you can just do it by massively decreasing your spend,

[05:20] by spreading your expenses between more people,

[05:22] which is how I just shared a bedroom with somebody.

[05:26] And only bought food from Costco,

[05:28] and that was the only food that I ate.

[05:30] And so at the most basic level,

[05:32] all business actually comes down to some sort of arbitrage.

[05:35] Because even if you have a skill difference

[05:37] from someone else, you have an information advantage.

[05:39] And so the arbitrage you have is that

[05:41] you know how to do something

[05:43] for less than it costs someone else to do it.

[05:45] And so they pay you to do that thing.

[05:47] And the arbitrage between what it costs you

[05:50] and what you charge them is how you make a profit.

[05:52] And so arbitrage is absolutely at the core

[05:55] of everything economic where babies basically profit is created.

[05:58] The best part about arbitrage is that you can

[06:00] employ it at all levels of personal income.

[06:03] So even if you're just working a job versus you make a ton

[06:05] of money in your business, there are levels of it.

[06:08] And I would encourage you to start when you have nothing

[06:10] because you basically arbitrage is a way of thinking.

[06:13] It's like how I live my life in a way

[06:14] that I always have this differential between what something

[06:17] costs me and what I can sell it for in the future.

[06:22] So the second way that you can ten extra income

[06:24] is through increasing the number of people

[06:27] who know who you are.

[06:28] Now the way to do that is to give away amazing stuff for free.

[06:34] And so giveaways is one of the strongest.

[06:36] I mean, they're so strong that they're literally regulated

[06:40] by the government.

[06:41] That's a really good telltale sign that something works

[06:43] is that the government steps in because it's so powerful

[06:45] that people abuse it.

[06:46] And so the two most powerful words in marketing are free and new.

[06:51] And so when you have a new giveaway,

[06:53] you want to have it be something free.

[06:55] Now I have been able to 10x my income multiple times

[06:58] my life, like I said earlier.

[07:00] And I have done it basically in every business

[07:03] through some sort of giveaway and I'll explain what that is.

[07:05] So the first massive increase when I talked about

[07:08] was actually through something that we call this six-week challenge,

[07:12] which was where we actually just gave away six weeks of service

[07:15] and accountability and workouts and nutrition planning.

[07:18] And everything two people.

[07:19] Now no one else in my market competing against that

[07:21] because they were just giving trials 14 days,

[07:23] sometimes 21 days.

[07:24] And it was just like workouts or is just access to the gym.

[07:27] I gave away a full program.

[07:28] Now I had a way of structuring it so that they would pay

[07:31] but then they'd get the money back if they did it.

[07:33] And that encouraged people to give it a shot.

[07:35] But it was what took the gym to a completely different

[07:38] stratosphere.

[07:39] And just trying to do traditional marketing,

[07:42] just didn't really work that well.

[07:43] Or at least I got traditional results, which were mediocre.

[07:46] Now the next big thing that I did was in gym launch,

[07:49] I wrote the gym launch secrets book.

[07:51] And you'll notice this is a common theme for me

[07:53] is that I write books before I get into any market.

[07:56] And I do that for a couple of reasons.

[07:57] One is that when I write a book before I get into a market,

[07:59] the writing process itself is actually a learning process

[08:02] for me.

[08:02] And so it's like how much can I learn,

[08:04] how much can I consolidate and synthesize information

[08:08] to put it into a really coherent way

[08:09] because I think writing is one of the best ways

[08:10] of learning how to think.

[08:12] And so the gym launch secrets book, the reason

[08:14] this was so crazy is that it outlines everything

[08:16] that we did to turn around gyms.

[08:18] And I was so afraid to publish this because I was like,

[08:19] oh my god, it's going to be all my secrets.

[08:21] Everyone's going to have it.

[08:22] But then this is where a lot of the giveaway,

[08:24] the secrets, selling, and the mutation,

[08:26] mindset came from.

[08:27] And so you should never be afraid of the things

[08:29] that you're giving away.

[08:30] And this process of doing these types of giveaways

[08:34] is what generates huge amounts of demand.

[08:37] And so fundamentally, if you're going to grow business,

[08:38] you either got to get way more customers

[08:40] if we would have 10X.

[08:41] It's like we had 10X to customers.

[08:42] We got a 10X how much of their worth.

[08:43] And I'll get to that later.

[08:44] So I'm going to put something to rest

[08:46] that you're probably worried about.

[08:48] I was so frightened to launch gym launch secrets, the book,

[08:51] because it was like this is everything that I learned.

[08:53] I was like this is like my life's work

[08:56] in this book.

[08:56] It's 400 pages of how to just run a gym.

[08:59] It's like the trainer adds, the salesman adds,

[09:02] the training, the scripts, how to set up your lobby,

[09:04] like the upsell process, the different pricing packages,

[09:07] how to do some of it, how to do larger.

[09:09] Like everything was in there.

[09:10] And I will say this, like a lot of big decision points

[09:12] in my life, like Layla, kind of like put her hand

[09:14] on my shoulder and she's like, if you're afraid

[09:16] that it's too good, it's probably the right thing to give away.

[09:18] And I remember being like, all right, like here goes

[09:24] nothing, you know, like this could destroy us.

[09:26] But the thing that ended up happening is two things.

[09:28] One is that all my sales team was like,

[09:31] can you give away more books?

[09:33] Anybody who's read the book is like,

[09:34] so bought into our method,

[09:36] our way of doing things, like the immediately,

[09:38] like we don't have to sell them on the gym one's way.

[09:40] They're like, can we just, I just need your help.

[09:42] I want to do it right.

[09:43] I want to do it right the first time.

[09:44] I want to try and like try and learn air at this thing,

[09:46] which was the goal.

[09:47] But the sales guy saying that I was like,

[09:49] okay, well, that's super encouraging.

[09:51] And the second thing I'll tell you later.

[09:52] But this one is one of the most effective ways.

[09:54] Now, give you a couple more examples.

[09:56] So when I started my software company, Alan,

[09:59] what I did was I gave away, and this is crazy,

[10:02] I gave away basically unlimited coaching

[10:05] and training, like a whole course

[10:08] that most people would charge a gazillion dollars for.

[10:11] I just gave it away for anybody who used my software.

[10:14] And so with Alan, we were able to go from zero

[10:17] to $1.7 million per month, all right.

[10:21] Just using this within six months.

[10:23] And so most people were trying to charge agency owners

[10:26] like show them how to sell customers,

[10:28] how to package their offers, how to run ads.

[10:30] I did all of that for free for anyone who just used my software.

[10:34] And so that was a crazy, often,

[10:36] that was a crazy giveaway.

[10:37] And that's what generated a ton of demand inbound.

[10:40] For prestige labs, which was my supplement company.

[10:43] The big thing that I give away there was the entire,

[10:45] what I called sublim selling secrets.

[10:46] I used to say secrets a lot, I don't say anymore.

[10:49] But I eventually called it S3,

[10:51] which was the selling system for supplements.

[10:54] And so this is something that had made me,

[10:56] I mean, so much money in my gym career,

[10:59] that it took me two years to release it.

[11:00] I was like, I held it so close to my chest.

[11:02] Hey, if you actually want to implement this in your business,

[11:04] just send this video to whoever is going to be implementing it

[11:07] or your partner or just to yourself.

[11:10] If you need to or share it to your story,

[11:11] it means the world's me.

[11:12] Otherwise, back to the video.

[11:13] But basically, instead of selling this,

[11:15] I just gave it away.

[11:17] And then I just encouraged people to sell my product.

[11:19] Now, the thing is, is that people could take this

[11:21] and many people did.

[11:22] They just took the selling system

[11:23] and they just sold other supplements.

[11:25] But I had built prestige to have specific technical components

[11:29] into how the business was operated,

[11:31] that made it so much more advantageous for people

[11:34] who went through this training to use my supplements.

[11:37] So it's like, I should show people how to sell massive bundles,

[11:39] how to sell subscriptions.

[11:41] All of these things, and I priced it so that anybody who would sell

[11:44] would be able to have a discount far below

[11:46] what's in look at your get for retail.

[11:47] And so it was specifically made for people

[11:49] who were going to go through this free giveaway.

[11:51] And you're like, man, did he stop there?

[11:53] No, because with school, like right now, for example,

[11:56] we're giving a $100,000 away or a cyber truck

[12:00] to the person who uses the software, right?

[12:03] And gets and builds the biggest group within a 30 day period.

[12:07] And we've done three of these so far,

[12:09] and I think we're doing another one here in December.

[12:10] But the thing here is that this is what generates a ton

[12:13] of demand on the front end.

[12:14] And so it's like, if you want to, if you want to 10X,

[12:17] you can't do an incremental change.

[12:18] You have to do an order of magnitude difference.

[12:21] And so that comes from giving away actual tangible value,

[12:24] real stuff, like people were charging $10,000 or $20,000

[12:28] for what I was giving away here for free.

[12:31] And the thing is, it's not like, oh, I just like,

[12:33] just like tossed it up.

[12:33] I actually had the support the same way.

[12:36] Somebody who ran a business that had like a coaching business

[12:38] would run it, except I just did it for free.

[12:41] And with prestige labs, same thing.

[12:42] We had reps who would go out, call the gym owners up,

[12:45] train their teams on how to sell the product,

[12:48] all stuff that you'd normally charge for where we did for free.

[12:51] Gym mode secrets, six week challenge.

[12:53] The $100,000, like all of these things

[12:54] had real costs that we were willing to incur,

[12:57] because it generated so much more demand

[13:00] that it was offset with the amount of customers

[13:02] that we could bring in the door.

[13:03] And the only way that you can do a giveaway long term

[13:05] is that you have to have some sort of product

[13:07] that you know you're going to sell in the back of it.

[13:09] You have to still have a monetization system

[13:11] that makes sense.

[13:12] It's thus to lead to something.

[13:14] So here it's like cool this led to the memberships.

[13:17] And then gym mode secret led to gym mode,

[13:19] which is the licensing.

[13:20] And then Alan led to the software,

[13:22] prestige labs led to the products.

[13:23] And so each of them, basically,

[13:25] I gave way this thing that was really valuable,

[13:27] but then it led to we monetized the different way,

[13:29] which I've said this before,

[13:30] but my favorite business model in the entire world

[13:32] is look at what everyone else is buying,

[13:35] make it better, make it free, monetize another way.

[13:38] And so even with acquisition.com,

[13:40] I wrote both the books that are free.

[13:42] And I just recently released a scaling roadmap,

[13:46] which most people charge a gazillion dollars

[13:48] for it's 14 hours.

[13:50] And every single stage has 30-ish pages of what you need to do

[13:54] to solve the problems to get to the next level.

[13:55] And it's free.

[13:56] You just go get it, it's on the site.

[13:58] But the whole point here is that this is what

[14:00] it's allows you to provide outside's value to people.

[14:03] And I bring this up and I show each of these examples, right?

[14:06] Because people don't believe me or at least I see the giveaways

[14:09] people do and they're just lame.

[14:10] They either don't do it because they're afraid

[14:12] of giving too much value away,

[14:13] or they give away something that just doesn't have

[14:15] a lot of value.

[14:16] But the key is that there has to be some

[14:18] of some sort of hard costs that people can actually

[14:20] realize, oh, this is real value that I'm getting for free.

[14:24] Because otherwise you don't have reciprocity.

[14:26] We want to jam value into someone else's wallet

[14:29] so that they then have to transfer it back to us

[14:31] in the form of money later.

[14:32] Now, the big key here is that you got to be willing to wait.

[14:36] But if you can do that, the cool thing is

[14:38] is that so few people have that level of discipline.

[14:40] This strategy will literally always be available.

[14:42] I can shout it from the rooftops and still 95% of you

[14:44] aren't going to do it.

[14:45] And so if you're like, how do I come up with this thing

[14:47] that I give away for free?

[14:49] In $100 billion leads, I wrote a whole chapter on this

[14:51] and gauge your leads with offers and lead magnets.

[14:54] And I basically break down exactly what you need to do

[14:57] and how to think about lead magnets in general,

[15:00] how they generate more money for you.

[15:01] And kind of the different types of lead magnets

[15:04] that you can reveal, it probably can do free trial.

[15:06] You can do it one step in a multi-step process.

[15:08] And so each ones of these are different versions of this.

[15:12] So if we're to look at this as our little rubric here,

[15:16] six-week challenge is going to be essentially

[15:19] a free step in a multi-step process.

[15:21] Because most people who work out for six weeks

[15:23] want to work out more later.

[15:24] So it's like, OK, cool, you're going to need this other thing

[15:26] later.

[15:27] Jim wants secrets.

[15:28] This one was more about revealing a problem.

[15:30] So it shows all the things that you need to do.

[15:33] And then people were like, oh my god, this is so overwhelming.

[15:35] There's a lot of things I need to do to fix my gym.

[15:37] It'd be nice if I had help.

[15:38] And so then they take the next natural step.

[15:40] With Alan, same thing.

[15:42] Now with this business, the way that this model was kind of

[15:44] structure, there's almost like a freemium, where, again,

[15:47] you solve a problem for someone you help them grow their agency

[15:50] and then they're going to need the software even more.

[15:52] And the way the software structure

[15:53] is built as they grew.

[15:55] Prestige Labs.

[15:56] So with this, basically, the problem that they had

[15:59] is they didn't have a supplement sales system.

[16:01] Once they implemented a supplement sales system,

[16:03] the next problem they would actually have

[16:04] is what supplements do I sell, which did we have

[16:07] Prestige Labs.

[16:08] And so in each of these cases, you want to think about,

[16:11] can I reveal a problem for my prospect?

[16:13] Can I give them a trial of the thing I have?

[16:15] Or is it one step in a multi-step process?

[16:17] And I give examples of these.

[16:18] And then you can have different delivery mechanisms,

[16:20] which I want to get into.

[16:21] But you can check that out there.

[16:22] So the third way to 10x your income is

[16:24] through making customers worth more, which is going to come

[16:27] down to in the fastest way possible pricing.

[16:31] And so I talk about price a ton.

[16:33] And it's because it's the most powerful lever on profit.

[16:37] And if you're in the game to make more money,

[16:38] then you should try and raise it.

[16:41] And so the nice thing with this is that you can do this again,

[16:44] whether you're an employee or you're a solopreneur,

[16:47] or you're at a super big business, it works the same way.

[16:50] So you got your pricing lever.

[16:52] OK.

[16:53] So as an employee, you basically have three options.

[16:57] So number one is you can simply ask for more money.

[17:00] Now I don't recommend doing that because you're

[17:03] not going to 10x your income that way.

[17:05] So then it's like, OK, so if I just ask for more,

[17:08] ask, OK, I might get a little bit of raise if I'm good,

[17:10] if I'm not, they'd might just say no.

[17:12] The way to really ask for it is to take on more risk.

[17:16] And so you will be compensated for the amount of value

[17:20] to create your ability to negotiate how replaceable that skill is.

[17:23] And most importantly, the risk you're willing to take on.

[17:27] And so a business owner gets paid more

[17:30] than the employees in the business

[17:31] because the business owner takes a more risk.

[17:34] Right, Eduardo Savren, who's the first investor in Facebook,

[17:36] he put $30,000 up.

[17:38] And that was worth a gazillion dollars today.

[17:41] And he really didn't do much besides providing the first $30,000

[17:44] of capital for the servers for a Facebook to begin.

[17:47] And so he took on risk.

[17:48] And as a result of that, despite not really doing any work,

[17:51] he was able to make a significant amount of money.

[17:53] Now, as an employee, what is taking on risk look like?

[17:56] It means that you switch to a percentage of your compensation

[17:59] or the entirety of your compensation based on some key metric

[18:02] that you have responsibility over, that you can draw a connection

[18:05] between what you do and how much revenue

[18:07] or profit the company makes.

[18:09] Now, in some positions like sales,

[18:11] it's a little bit easier to draw that.

[18:12] And that's typically how those roles are structured.

[18:14] But if you know your job well, then you can think of ways

[18:18] to tie what you do to what the company makes.

[18:20] And you should do that because the closer you

[18:23] can tie yourself to revenue, the more valuable you will be.

[18:25] The third thing you can do is employ is you can just switch.

[18:28] You can start applying to other roles,

[18:31] either within the business or in other businesses.

[18:34] I actually think that the within business swap

[18:36] is one of them is underrated.

[18:37] So in terms of which one of these will make you the most money,

[18:40] this will probably make you the most,

[18:42] which is you taking on risk.

[18:44] You switching, sometimes you can get a significantly larger race,

[18:47] and then simply asking.

[18:48] And I think the reason for that is that if you have,

[18:51] if you're in a role where there's multiple people in your role,

[18:53] it sets a precedent for the business

[18:54] that even if you're a higher performing

[18:56] that they feel like they have to, then increase everyone else's pay,

[18:59] which is kind of a risk to the business.

[19:00] Basically here, you ask the business take on more risk

[19:02] versus here, you take on more of that risk.

[19:05] Now, the switch allows the business to maintain face

[19:07] and allow you to get into a role that takes

[19:09] on more responsibility or has a different title,

[19:11] and then you can earn according to that.

[19:13] Now, the final thing here is obviously you can start a business

[19:15] which then would switch your category overall,

[19:17] but let's talk about that.

[19:24] So the pricing lever here is really related to your income.

[19:26] The pricing lever here in businesses

[19:29] is related to what you sell.

[19:30] Now, I want to be really clear,

[19:31] and employee sells your services.

[19:33] You just sell them on a recurring contract,

[19:34] but fundamentally it's what it is.

[19:35] And so I think people see these in very different categories.

[19:38] I don't see them as that different.

[19:39] Personally, obviously only real difference is risk.

[19:42] Now, from a business perspective,

[19:43] think about that, this, what's the difference

[19:45] at employee in 1099, mostly government shit?

[19:48] But the actual day to day, obviously there's control

[19:51] and you have to show up on time,

[19:52] and you can have other customers,

[19:55] but the actual like what you do doesn't

[19:57] phenomenally change between being an employee

[19:59] and being a 1099, but a 1099 business owner

[20:01] and employee isn't.

[20:01] And so I just think that if I can smooth over that wall,

[20:05] I think a lot more people would be willing to take the risk

[20:08] because fundamentally the doingness is not that dissimilar.

[20:11] And so here you have services which you sell your time for,

[20:14] and you have a price which is your salary

[20:16] or the way that you negotiate your compensation.

[20:18] And that's it.

[20:19] Now, as a business owner, you do the exact same thing.

[20:21] But instead of having one boss, you have many bosses,

[20:24] and you have to talk to them every day,

[20:25] which you're gonna be your customers.

[20:27] And so I have talked to this at length

[20:29] and still known none of you do it.

[20:31] So the big thing to do here is implement a price anchor.

[20:34] Now, a price anchor is basically just a price

[20:36] they put way above your normal prices

[20:38] that mentally anchors how people perceive the remainder

[20:42] of your menu.

[20:43] And so people actually frame all numbers

[20:46] with respect to the numbers they heard first.

[20:48] And so by the way, if you're ever selling something,

[20:50] you wanna include even earlier in the presentation,

[20:53] massive numbers.

[20:53] Even if it has nothing to do with the price

[20:55] that you mentioned later, just big numbers will frame people's minds

[20:59] in big thoughts so that when you say,

[21:02] now I'll give you a simple example and I'll tell you a story.

[21:04] So if I said $10,000, right?

[21:08] And then I said $100, it sounds very different

[21:10] than me saying $100, $10,000, right?

[21:15] It's a different shift in terms of, oh my God,

[21:17] that's so many different units, right?

[21:18] Now obviously you heard the first one first

[21:20] and it does influence it.

[21:21] But big picture, the anchor makes everything else

[21:23] seem cheap by comparison.

[21:25] And so let me tell you the story about a crazy steak house

[21:27] that Salbei made.

[21:28] There's this restaurant by Salt Bay, who's like a meme.

[21:32] But he actually has like, I think like 10 or 11 locations,

[21:34] something like that called Newsarret.

[21:36] And so Newsarret is a super expensive steak house.

[21:39] And everything they have is a little bit more

[21:41] than the very expensive steak house.

[21:42] So like a normal steak there is, I want to say like 90 bucks,

[21:46] which is pretty steep at least today,

[21:48] even for a high end steak place, maybe a hundred.

[21:51] All right, but here's the thing is that they have this gold menu

[21:54] which they just wrap the meat in gold foil.

[21:58] And they charge like $2,000, $3,000 for these steaks.

[22:02] And you're thinking, why on earth would someone go

[22:05] and spend $2,000 or $3,000?

[22:07] Because they want someone to know they spent $2,000,

[22:10] and so that would be by it's very different, a luxury item.

[22:13] Where the price of the thing itself

[22:15] confers the value to the product,

[22:17] meaning the more expensive it is, the more desirable it is.

[22:19] And the key to luxury products is that other people know how expensive

[22:22] it is so that you get status by proxy by being able to afford the product.

[22:26] Now that's very different than a premium product,

[22:28] where the value isn't in the fact that it's expensive,

[22:32] the value is in the fact that it is significantly more valuable

[22:34] in terms of the result or experience that it delivers.

[22:38] This is what we call in the biz a profit maximizer.

[22:43] And so a lot of entrepreneurs,

[22:46] especially don't understand, is that the thing you sell most of,

[22:49] isn't necessarily the thing you make the most money on.

[22:51] All right, so let me say that again.

[22:53] So if you look at McDonald's, for example, they sell burgers.

[22:56] They don't make a lot of money on burgers.

[22:58] If they only sold burgers, they would go out of business.

[23:01] And so even though it's the core product,

[23:03] it's not the profit maximizer.

[23:05] They make significantly more money on fries and a Coke,

[23:08] because the margins on fries and Coke are way, way better

[23:11] than meat and a bun and fresh lettuce and tomatoes and onions and all the other stuff.

[23:15] And so the thing you sell the most amount of

[23:18] is not always the thing you make the most money on.

[23:20] And so you can absolutely build their business,

[23:22] that McDonald's corporate business is real estate,

[23:24] but the franchise e-business is really the Coke, ice cream,

[23:28] and fries business, because that's where they make the disproportionate

[23:31] amount of profit.

[23:32] And so this is why the giveaway thing that I was mentioning earlier is so important

[23:36] is that you can have this very valuable thing that you give away for free.

[23:40] And then you maximize your profit with this other thing that's significantly more expensive.

[23:44] That is typically going to be a very more handheld, more done for you,

[23:49] more heavy service, more concierge, more white glove,

[23:52] version of whatever it is that you sell.

[23:54] Now, if you sell on the product side, typically it's going to have to be newer designs,

[23:58] different materials that will make a better experience.

[24:01] So, friend of mine actually implemented this into his online business.

[24:05] And he had this, he just created this super expensive 101 version of his thing

[24:10] that was 10 times more expensive.

[24:11] So his thing was $500 monthly charge $5,000 monthly.

[24:13] It was a business to consumer business.

[24:15] And what the craziest thing happened,

[24:17] he then had a ton of people take this more valuable offer,

[24:21] which he had zero intention of actually selling.

[24:23] He just wanted to have more people buy the next thing.

[24:26] But not only that, a higher percentage people bought his previously most expensive package,

[24:31] because it looked like the much more affordable, more reasonable, middle option.

[24:35] Because I want to over-deliver him, also gave you a fourth bonus way of 10xier income.

[24:39] And so, if leverage is getting more for what we put in,

[24:41] then we want to take maximal advantage of the assets we already have.

[24:46] And so, a big part of doing that is saying, okay, who do I already know?

[24:50] And so, you want to hit your list with the combination of those three things.

[24:56] So, you're like, okay, I'm going to arbitrage myself,

[24:58] and basically sell stuff from more than it cost me.

[25:01] I'm going to live in places that cost me less than what I need to spend.

[25:03] So I can be more aggressive and take on less personal.

[25:05] So I can take on more business risk.

[25:06] Cool. Next thing, you're like, okay, I need to give something amazingly valuable away.

[25:11] Got it. That generates more leads.

[25:12] Then, I'm going to upsell people into a super expensive thing.

[25:16] Got it. And so then finally, the question would be like, okay, well, who am I going to do this to?

[25:20] And so this is where you look at your cell phone, you look at your email list,

[25:24] you look at, when I say email is just literally the context that are in your email.

[25:27] Not like you've developed some emails.

[25:29] Now, if your business obviously you should have an email list, then if you don't shame on you.

[25:32] All right. So you've got your cell phone, you've got your email list on top of that.

[25:37] You've got all socials.

[25:38] And then let them know about this free thing that you have.

[25:42] And then create the ascension process that naturally leads from the giveaway where you solved the problem.

[25:49] So you reveal the problem, you give them a trial of a solution or a one-part solution to a multi-step solution.

[25:55] So that they then naturally want to buy your next thing.

[25:58] And so our largest portfolio company actually ran this exact play.

[26:02] And in one email campaign, all right. So literally just like a three email blast, right,

[26:08] to the list that they had, they drove everyone to a webinar, where they just said,

[26:16] hey, here's this amazing offer.

[26:18] And they were able to make $2.3 million from this one campaign.

[26:22] Now obviously this is a business that has millions of emails on the list.

[26:25] But I mean, I don't know what your income is now, but three emails for $2.3 million, ain't bad.

[26:31] And so if we scaled this down one-tenth, then it would be $230,000.

[26:35] And if we did it, $100 less than it would be $23,000.

[26:38] But this is a great way to implement all of the stuff that I just said immediately.

[26:43] Yeah, and the reason that this is one of the strongest ways of 10xing your income,

[26:46] there's no real additional cost, right.

[26:48] So you're just making money for it not a lot of cost, because we've already incurred the cost of getting the customers.

[26:53] And so again, arbitrage being a theme here.

[26:56] Like we already paid for this, so cost is zero.

[26:59] And we're going to sell this thing that cost a lot to them, but not much for us.

[27:02] And if you like this video, you're going to love this video on 10 ways to make a million dollars.

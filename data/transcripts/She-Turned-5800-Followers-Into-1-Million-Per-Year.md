[00:00] You're new to me, it's going to blow your mind.

[00:01] One million dollars in profit from less than six thousand Instagram followers.

[00:07] What I want to walk you through is a story of a business owner that I just recently met doing

[00:11] those exact numbers from a tiny audience and what you can use from those strategies for

[00:17] yourself to get started making big money even if you have a small audience.

[00:21] I had the most insane thing happened last night and it has had me at a loss for words.

[00:28] I was actually at a loss for words like speechless, befuddled bewildered and I was like,

[00:32] what is going on?

[00:34] And it took a concept that I kind of believe in and I've made some moves around it and it

[00:39] took it to the absolute hyperbolic extreme that you could imagine and it still held true.

[00:46] And I think that for business owners who are listening to this for people who make content

[00:50] who are listening to this, but just in this is going to, I mean, it has slightly nudged

[00:55] how I see the world and I'm just put it that way.

[00:57] And I feel like a lot of the beliefs that have around the world are still relatively,

[01:00] I hold on, I believe them pretty strongly.

[01:03] So here's what happened.

[01:06] So we'd come to come in and the lady who owns the company is a registered dietitian.

[01:15] And I'm not going to shout out, I would shout her out because I wanted to get all the

[01:17] cudos in the world, but I don't want it to mess up what she's doing.

[01:21] And so that's why I'm going to keep it anonymous.

[01:23] So she's a registered dietitian.

[01:26] She takes home just under a million dollars a year helping other registered dietitians

[01:30] Bill insurance correctly.

[01:32] And so it's super niche in terms of what she's really good at.

[01:34] So she knows how to be an R.D. and how people Bill insurance goes properly.

[01:39] And so the average, I think, a dietitian adds like a hundred thousand dollars in income

[01:45] using just like her kind of coding system for billing them, right?

[01:48] Crazy niche, crazy crazy niche.

[01:51] And so I spent some time with her.

[01:53] We talked about her business and things I was like, hey, I think you can move this stuff

[01:55] around.

[01:55] And I think that the business could probably do about three million a year to five

[01:58] million a year in profit if she just moved some of the things around that we

[02:01] talked about.

[02:01] And so I was like, cool, this is great.

[02:04] And so we had dinner and I was like, hey, let me see your your your your Instagram.

[02:10] So I just wanted to pull it up because I was going to make a point about something

[02:12] because I assumed that she had like I wanted to see what kind of content she had.

[02:16] I assume that she had at least a relatively large following.

[02:18] I honestly hadn't looked shame on me.

[02:21] And this is what happens.

[02:23] I pull it up.

[02:24] Number one, her account is not verified.

[02:27] And I'm like, this is your number one source of income and you're not paying 1499 a

[02:31] month, like, what do you do it?

[02:33] What are you doing?

[02:34] And after after yelling at her for that, I then was then drawn to the next natural

[02:40] absolutely unbelievable thing that I'm going to say to you.

[02:43] She had 5,800 followers.

[02:47] Her average post got 19 likes and like one comment.

[02:51] And 100% 100% of her acquisition came from her organic Instagram with just

[02:59] under 6,000 followers.

[03:01] I pull up her account says because I was losing my mind seeing the amount of sales that

[03:05] she was making off of this account.

[03:07] Her account her reach for 30 days of her account was 2,800.

[03:14] That was her reach 2800.

[03:16] Like for context, I do about 20 million a month context.

[03:22] And I was like, what is happening right now?

[03:26] Like, what am I, what do I not?

[03:28] What is what is going on?

[03:30] How is this possible?

[03:31] And so she's doing 10 plus sales a day at a low ticket price and doing three

[03:36] ish sales a week at a higher ticket price.

[03:38] And when I say higher ticket, I'm talking like, you know, four or five

[03:41] thousand dollars type price point and then a lower ticket thing for just

[03:45] like some cheat sheets of like here's all the codes and this is taking

[03:48] do them whatever.

[03:50] And a 10 a day a day.

[03:55] Okay.

[03:55] And so this is that that's that's that's the big story.

[03:58] Now I'm going to zoom out and I'm going to say what I think is so cool

[04:01] about this.

[04:02] So she says this and I was like, how how how are you doing this?

[04:06] And she's like, you know what?

[04:07] I got my first sale when I ate people on my email list.

[04:12] Eight.

[04:13] Eight.

[04:15] And I was like, that's nuts.

[04:17] And she was like, yes, it was really confirming for me that like there's

[04:19] people were listening.

[04:20] And so I was like, well, how big is your email list now?

[04:23] And she's been doing this for a few years.

[04:24] I've got I talked 2,000, 900 people on our email list.

[04:31] And she makes sales for emails.

[04:34] And it was such a great reset for me.

[04:37] It was such a good nudge as a reminder that the view count you have on the

[04:43] other side, the 19 likes, like there's a real person on the other side of this,

[04:49] that is watching your clip that has five views.

[04:52] There's a real person who's opening up your emails when you have a list that

[04:56] has 300 people on it.

[04:58] Like people are watching people are listening.

[05:02] And the thing that was unique that I found about her, I'll say two things.

[05:05] And I think that there's a really good meta concept here.

[05:08] One is she her content was consistent.

[05:12] And she said, yeah, I do one post and I do one story every day.

[05:16] And I like, but she was six out of it.

[05:18] I was like, this is adorable and also crazy.

[05:21] But the post that she talks about 100% of them are about billing insurance as

[05:25] registered dietitian.

[05:26] Like, could not be more niche.

[05:27] Couldn't I couldn't even think of one, right?

[05:29] Maybe it's for I couldn't even imagine one.

[05:32] And despite that, she's making the sales that she is.

[05:34] And so I'm going to zoom out on this because I think it's really interesting.

[05:37] So if you, if you go to my Alex's homepage, like as a user of Instagram,

[05:42] my user page, I've showed this to people because people really like this to really

[05:45] where it all I have is philosophy stuff, comedy and gym equipment.

[05:48] Like, that's my whole feet.

[05:49] I have no news.

[05:50] I have it's philosophy, comedy and gym equipment.

[05:54] Because that's what I look at.

[05:55] And what's interesting is that the philosophy is kind of a lot of those are kind of like mid-sized

[05:59] the comedians are mass markets.

[06:01] A lot of those guys are bigger.

[06:03] But I get tiny comedians like 5,000 followers, 10,000 of our comedians get shown to me

[06:07] all the time because Instagram knows I like comedy and equipment dealers and equipment

[06:13] manufacturers and metal fabricators, not always the best marketers.

[06:17] And so like, these accounts that I follow there have like 500,000 like two

[06:23] dots like they're not huge accounts.

[06:25] But I get served everything in that space on Instagram because that's what I'm into.

[06:30] And so I think that there's a couple of really interesting things here.

[06:32] One is that I think that niche content will make you a hell of a lot more money

[06:38] if that's what you're actually selling.

[06:40] And I have, here's the thing, I have learned this lesson twice.

[06:43] So I like to, you know, I like to pretend that I'm, you know, I, I like to think

[06:47] of fancy business man who learns all these lessons.

[06:50] But I, I have mess this up two times now two times.

[06:54] And so I tell the story about how my podcast was getting, you know, 2, 3000 downloads.

[07:00] per month, which is like 100 downloads in episode, not a lot, right?

[07:04] But, and that was for like a few years.

[07:07] But I don't tell you this other part of the story, which is that my podcast started growing

[07:12] in numbers when I started talking about general business.

[07:15] It all started growing in numbers even faster once we sold the company for Jim

[07:18] much.

[07:19] But there was a period of about 18 months prior to me selling where I just talked about general

[07:23] business because I was like a tired of how to talk about Jim's.

[07:25] I just want to talk about business in general.

[07:27] During that period of time, our organic sales went to basically zero.

[07:33] And it took us like six months to figure out that the reason that that had happened was

[07:38] because I stopped talking about Jim's shit.

[07:40] And Jim owners were like, less interested in my content than generic business

[07:45] got to that makes sense.

[07:46] Like, if you're, if you're a business owner, you're going to listen to business

[07:49] stuff in general.

[07:49] If you're a dentist, then you're going to get a lot out of a dentist, only podcast, right?

[07:53] But there's not that many dentists.

[07:55] You're not going to get a lot of listens, but the listens in terms of relevancy

[07:57] is going to be through the roof.

[07:59] And so we started making less sales, but I was getting more views more

[08:02] listens, right?

[08:03] Now I ended up wanting to go in that direction.

[08:05] So it was fine.

[08:06] And I'm talking about general business now, right?

[08:08] I mean, that mistake second time, not necessarily mistake we learned, right?

[08:13] Three, six months ago, we were like, let's experiment with some wider content.

[08:16] And by experimenting with wider content, we sure as I got more views more,

[08:19] more bunch of other vanity metrics.

[08:21] But the number of business owners that was watching and the way I measured that

[08:24] was our CPMs on our videos on YouTube, the amount of people who opt in at acquisition.com,

[08:30] people who buy our books, all of those, all of those metrics were actually down to

[08:34] spread our views being up.

[08:35] And so this little story that I have of the dinner that I had last night,

[08:40] blew me away because it just showed how much you can really make if you have a

[08:43] die-hard audience that doesn't need to be big less than 6,000 followers.

[08:48] Her account reaches less than 2800 accounts per month.

[08:51] And she's taking home almost a million dollars here.

[08:54] That's income, not revenue.

[08:55] I'm just talking profit.

[08:57] And right now, if she just takes makes the couple of obvious changes that she can make,

[09:00] she'll probably make someone the three to five million dollars a year range income income.

[09:07] And if you're looking to make your first dollar online or monetize your audience

[09:10] no matter what the size is, school.com, for such games is the easiest way that I know

[09:15] how to do it.

[09:15] I take a call once a week inside of that community to answer questions for people who are getting

[09:19] started.

[09:19] I have a step by step course that lays out what exactly to do to make your first

[09:23] dollar online.

[09:24] And once a month, I drop eight hours of training from the top 10 community business owners

[09:29] showing exactly what they're doing to scale their communities today.

[09:32] School.com, social.s games, you can start for free.

[09:35] And I say this because there's there's two angles on this right on one side people

[09:40] like, well, I don't want to start making content because what if I have low numbers?

[09:44] I believe now the algorithms are so good that if you make it about one specific type of

[09:48] thing, it's going to show to those people.

[09:49] And right now, by the way, like the guy who runs Instagram talked about,

[09:52] he's actually favoring smaller creators now, so that's a good thing.

[09:55] If you're trying to get into it, but beyond that, I think there's so much power in

[10:01] and when I talk to her, she's like, I just want to show up.

[10:03] She's like, I show up whether there's no one, there's one person.

[10:05] And I just, I show it like, like, it's a whole lot of it's more of it.

[10:08] She said this thing.

[10:09] And I have just noticed this with fucking winners, right?

[10:12] It's like they're doing it because of what they because she's a missioner.

[10:16] She just genuinely wants to help Richard Dietz, and she's like, I get it.

[10:20] I worked at the hospital.

[10:20] I was doing a hundred hours a week, and like, I was under, you know,

[10:23] understaffed underbuilding.

[10:24] I had to start making this business work on my own doing one day a week.

[10:27] So I had to figure out how to do this quickly in terms of all this billing stuff.

[10:29] And she gets so passionate when you're talking about it.

[10:32] I've, I've confidence.

[10:33] She's not going to change industries.

[10:34] She's been in 20 something years.

[10:35] Like, she's not going anywhere.

[10:36] She loves this stuff.

[10:37] And the people who stay in the game the longest like the game the ran.

[10:41] And so I have this thing that I heard from last dance, which is the Michael Jordan

[10:46] documentary, which you haven't seen.

[10:48] You should tell us you it.

[10:50] There's their interviewing Jordan.

[10:51] And they're like, why do you bring such a high intensity every single time you

[10:56] shut up to the arena?

[10:57] And he says this line, and I remember getting chills when I heard it.

[10:59] He was like, I just never, I know that there's one guy who's bringing a son.

[11:04] And they saved up for months to go to this one bulls game.

[11:07] And that's the one, it's not going to be some prime time night.

[11:10] It's just going to be a random Tuesday game in a series.

[11:14] And he's like, and that's the only time they're going to see me play in their lives.

[11:17] He's like, and I want, I want to perform for them for that kid, for that for that dad who

[11:22] wants to impress a son.

[11:23] And like that, like I almost get choked up on a tell that story because like that's so

[11:29] real for me.

[11:31] And the way that she brought the energy like the energy you brought in terms of how

[11:34] she wanted to shut when there's eight people on her life or two people on her

[11:38] life or when there were eight people on her email list and she made her first

[11:42] $39 sale.

[11:44] I was like, this is real and people need to hear this, which is why I wanted to tell

[11:48] the story because I think it's absolutely insane.

[11:50] And it just, it put like I say what I say, right, which is, hey guys, like start

[11:55] making, you know, start making cuts at supper, money yourself.

[11:57] If more people know about your stuff, you're going to make more money period,

[11:59] fight me, right?

[12:00] That's, that's what it is.

[12:01] But you just forget sometimes that like when you have 10 views on a YouTube video,

[12:06] that's 10 people and I remember when I was in the gym, what if I had 10 people that

[12:08] I could talk to us, don't, right?

[12:10] The fact that we can do this from home behind a camera, my God, how amazing

[12:13] is that?

[12:14] And so like if I had 25 people, my God, that's like, that's like a talk, that's like

[12:18] a workshop you, a lunch and learn that you do as a business owner trying to get business.

[12:22] The fact that you can make a niche content, Instagram will serve as to only people who

[12:25] were interested in it.

[12:26] I only like gym equipment and I get gym equipment stuff all the time.

[12:29] They've got like 13 likes on it, but I see it, right?

[12:32] I see it because Instagram knows.

[12:33] And the algorithms will only get better.

[12:36] And so I wanted to cover all that stuff because I thought it was really important.

[12:41] And from how do you make this?

[12:46] She has endless sources of content because she just literally answers their questions.

[12:51] They just keep that, she's like, so where do you get to stuff from?

[12:53] She's like, oh, they all have questions.

[12:54] And so I just, I just make my posts answering their questions.

[12:58] That's it.

[12:59] And I will say this, I think she could do a lot of things better to be clear.

[13:03] But like, she just had every other post just had a buy the way.

[13:06] There's a link in my bio that has more stuff that you might like.

[13:10] That was it.

[13:11] That was the whole strategy.

[13:12] And she was doing a million dollars a year take home, just under.

[13:16] And so I was just blown away by this.

[13:17] And I find it actually one of the most hopeful messages that I have seen in in person in

[13:23] a very long time.

[13:24] And so people have, you know, like unless I have 100,000 followers, not people make money,

[13:28] unless I have to.

[13:29] The thing is is that people seek the followers with the idea that the followers are going

[13:34] to make them rich.

[13:35] The followers will make you famous, understanding business will make you rich.

[13:39] She understands business.

[13:40] She's like, I'm just going to talk to the people that I want to serve.

[13:43] And I'm only going to serve them.

[13:44] And I'm going to answer all the questions.

[13:46] And the way she talked about it, she's like, I just want to be useful.

[13:48] She's like, I just want to help him out.

[13:50] And so if you're coming into the frame rather than like, I want this piece of content to

[13:54] perform and think there's eight people in their side.

[13:56] I just want them to be better off.

[13:57] And hopefully answer their question from this piece of content that making, you will get

[14:01] raving fans.

[14:03] Even if your audience is five thousand people.

[14:06] There's a book, a camera that got wrote in the book.

[14:09] He says, you only need a thousand true fans.

[14:12] And I think that like a thousand fan, like you can, you can do whatever you want with a

[14:16] thousand fans.

[14:17] Even at 10 bucks a month, right?

[14:18] Like you can make on a thousand dollars a year if you just do that.

[14:20] Right?

[14:21] Thousand true fans that are diart.

[14:22] And you can make a lot more than that with a thousand true fans.

[14:25] And so people think because we have this eight billion people in the world that you need

[14:27] to be, you need to be the Brock, you need to be a Kim Kardashian, you need to be Mr.

[14:30] Beast and sure.

[14:31] With massive numbers, like those, you're going to get famous.

[14:34] Those things are required.

[14:35] But like you can make an absolute killing just talking about what you really get

[14:40] at.

[14:41] And that's the other piece here is that I'm, I'm, I'm half, I'm shadowing this at myself,

[14:44] too, which is like, we, we, we may, we may piece of marriage content a couple, you know,

[14:49] a couple of relationships stuff, get a little bit of fitness stuff.

[14:52] And the thing is, it's like, there's, there's no relationship billionaire.

[14:58] Like the only objective measure of if your marriage is good, just from a society standpoint

[15:02] is that you are not divorced.

[15:04] That's it.

[15:05] And then it's that measured by how many years you put up with each other.

[15:10] That's it.

[15:11] And I don't like that because it's one of those, it's one of those crappy things where

[15:14] everybody's been in a relationship.

[15:15] So everybody has an opinion.

[15:17] And there's no objective proof that one thing is better than another.

[15:20] And so like, I hate, I don't like making content in that space.

[15:23] We try it out because like we have a unique relationship, like Lenin, we like what we do.

[15:28] And it's worked for us well.

[15:29] But I would say that I have more credibility in business.

[15:36] And so she has credibility in not just, she has talked about nutrition at all.

[15:41] She just talks about how to be a restructur dietitian and Bill insurance properly and get

[15:46] credentialized and do this whole process that apparently is a big pain.

[15:50] And so if you are somebody who has a very specific niche that you're good at, I would

[15:56] highly encourage you to just make the content that gets 40 views, that gets 100 likes,

[16:03] that you know for sure will help a very specific person because when you do help that very

[16:08] specific person, they will like you a lot more than many people who like you a little

[16:13] bit.

[16:14] And the people who like you a lot are the ones who buy from you.

[16:18] And that's the thing.

[16:19] And I, I'm making this because I need to remind myself of this, which is like, you can

[16:23] need to be rich where you can be famous, you can obviously be both, but honestly, sometimes

[16:27] a lot faster to just get rich.

[16:29] And many of you get in the game because you want to make money from social media, from

[16:33] making content, from things like that, from advertising the business, you want to do more

[16:36] of that, get your face out there or whatever.

[16:39] But you start chasing the views because the views is what the algorithm encourages.

[16:43] But the business side, and this is why I'm trying to make this point, is that the metrics

[16:47] don't necessarily follow the bit, your business metrics don't follow your vanity metrics.

[16:52] And so just because you get more views doesn't mean you get more revenue.

[16:56] Just because you get more subs doesn't mean you get more options, right, for your website,

[17:01] or for whatever it is that you sell.

[17:02] You don't get sales from that stuff, subscribers don't mean sales.

[17:07] And so there are, there are tons of stories of tiny new channels.

[17:10] We have, we have insurance brokerage that we own.

[17:13] And the, the head of the insurance brokerage has like, when, when we, when we invest in

[17:18] the company head, I think like 5,000 followers on Instagram, or sorry, not on Instagram,

[17:23] on on YouTube.

[17:25] And the business is doing many millions of dollars a year.

[17:27] I'll just be that be very clear there, many millions, not just one or two.

[17:32] And it's because he talks about a very complex structure of insurance that, that he specializes

[17:36] in his, one of the, at foremost experts.

[17:38] And his videos get like 100 to 500 views.

[17:41] But those 100 to 500 views are people who are looking for incredibly high end, very specialized

[17:47] insurance products.

[17:50] And so don't be afraid of the empty room.

[17:54] Very low views doesn't mean low revenue.

[17:56] It just means that it's more specific.

[17:59] And that you're talking to a more specific person.

[18:01] And a specific problem being saw for a specific person is how you make big money.

[18:07] And so I, I thought this was one of the most hopeful messages that I had seen in real life

[18:12] in a long time.

[18:14] And it was really confirming for me.

[18:15] It also doubled down on the direction that we're doing, which for those you said I said,

[18:18] mistake, may the mistake twice.

[18:20] We have come back to go back to business, baby, only business, only Alex, only business, only

[18:26] for the fans, just kidding.

[18:28] And I hope you hope, I hope this at least encouraged you to just divorce yourself more and

[18:34] more from the Vinity metrics around it because I am now leaning so hard to this because

[18:38] our business metrics and I have a big long thing that's coming out soon have skyrocketed.

[18:44] Because we stop going anything that's not business.

[18:48] And so I feel so confirmed in this direction that I want to encourage as many of you

[18:52] seemingly possible to just toss out the Vinity metrics because they do not fucking matter.

[18:59] If you're trying to make money, if you're just trying to get famous then yeah, but I

[19:02] mean it's great metric for fame.

[19:04] Right.

[19:05] And so yeah, just do that.

[19:08] Be willing to have a thousand fans, make stuff that has 19 likes because you know that the

[19:13] 19 people who liked it were like this was unbelievable for me and they will take the next

[19:16] step and they will purchase from a business.

[19:18] Keeping awesome, have an amazing day.

[19:20] Bye!

[00:00] If you use organic marketing to get more leads for your business or you're starting from

[00:04] scraps, whether it's a new department or brand new for your business, I talk to room

[00:08] full business owners for eight hours and this is one of the best moments that we pulled

[00:12] out of just talking about organic strategy to help them make more money.

[00:15] Though these two worlds where there's like the world that makes money and just needs traffic

[00:18] and the world that has so much traffic and has no money.

[00:21] And so when you learn how to marry those two, you just make absolutely obscene amounts of money.

[00:27] I mean, like Logan Paul merging with Prime, like he had the audience in the traffic and

[00:31] then he had a way to make money, Mr. Beast with the chocolate, like he had, he had distribution,

[00:35] he just needed a product.

[00:37] Alex Shmozi needed a product for the distribution base, school, right?

[00:41] Tons of traffic, where do we send it?

[00:43] Right now, if you have paid ads, starting organic will immediately make the pay

[00:47] ads more profitable.

[00:49] Because what will happen is people will look at the ads, then they will look at your

[00:52] organic and then they will take the next step.

[00:54] And if they took the next step and booked a call, they will actually show.

[00:57] And if they show, they'll have a high percentage of closing.

[00:59] Like, don't worry about the views and all of that stuff that happens in the early days.

[01:03] Just keep making it and just think about it in the beginning as lead nurture.

[01:06] In the early days it'll be nurture.

[01:08] As you get bigger and bigger, it'll become acquisition.

[01:11] But just from a value perspective, if you can just make that shift, it'll make your life

[01:14] a lot easier.

[01:15] From a scaling organic perspective, I tend to always start with an agency for every new medium

[01:23] or platform that I want to go on.

[01:24] Now, if you don't want to do that, that's fine.

[01:26] I just prefer to buy lessons and trick my time ones.

[01:29] And so I started with a guy that I think I was paying like five grand a month.

[01:32] And no way was he special.

[01:34] Basically did nothing.

[01:36] But it kept me accountable to making three videos a week.

[01:39] And so I would do that and he would post them.

[01:41] I still don't really know how to post a video on YouTube.

[01:46] So I say that because if you just focus on making the content exceptional, like it will grow.

[01:53] And just my recommendation is do not promote in the content to the greatest ever.

[02:01] So think about it like this.

[02:03] Is that you want to have this big valuable thing, all this content that you're teaching.

[02:07] The CTAs, in my opinion, in content are not very effective.

[02:11] Like they kill reach, it feels weird, no one likes it, whatever.

[02:15] People will naturally just take the next step.

[02:17] If you put it in the descriptions, you put it in your link in bio.

[02:20] Like you do those two things, you will get traffic to your stuff by just saying this is what

[02:25] I do rather than, hey, why the way?

[02:29] I don't think that's the right way to do it.

[02:31] The beautiful merger of these who here knows how to run ads.

[02:34] And just like it, show a hands.

[02:36] Okay, so like half of you guys?

[02:37] Okay.

[02:39] Where the magic happens is where you build all the goodwill for free.

[02:43] And then you use ads to do the CTAs.

[02:46] And so as I know here read the leads book.

[02:49] Okay.

[02:50] So there's the whole content section about the give ass ratio.

[02:54] The, unfortunately, be based on the book and the limitations of the book.

[02:57] I can't get into like more advanced stuff.

[03:00] Where it gets really juicy is that all of your content is only give.

[03:05] And then the ads are the ask.

[03:08] So then you don't have to balance a give to ask ratio.

[03:10] You just only give in content.

[03:12] And then the ads serve to be the CTA.

[03:16] And for whatever reason, it protects the brand.

[03:18] It's a totally different vibe.

[03:20] If I was like right-hooking in every video,

[03:22] like hey, go to here, go to here, go to here, go to here,

[03:24] people be like, whoop, and then that would be it.

[03:26] Like, no one will watch myself anymore.

[03:27] But if I keep providing value, they get value.

[03:30] I deposit goodwill.

[03:31] And then later we could hit them with an advertisement to go do something.

[03:35] And they exist completely separately.

[03:38] And so we just want to think about the mind space of like,

[03:40] the three to one ratio still exists.

[03:42] If you think about someone's newsfeed,

[03:43] so they have like content one for you, content two for you,

[03:46] content three for you, and then they have an ad for you.

[03:50] And so here's the money one.

[03:51] And all this other stuff is free.

[03:53] And so think about it from a larger perspective.

[03:55] And that's where like, this is where the obscene money is.

[04:00] What do you guys have questions about here?

[04:02] So I'm going to just ran it at you for a second,

[04:04] trying to cross this many of these out as I can.

[04:05] So from a topics volume, these kind of all go together.

[04:12] So Evelyn, for you.

[04:14] If you were looking at, I make this really niche

[04:16] content, I need to go wide.

[04:18] In my experience, like, keep making the content

[04:21] that's going to serve your avatar.

[04:22] If you want to have, I would say like, if you want to sprinkle in,

[04:25] I just consider it further top of funnel.

[04:27] And so like, we have made some of these like,

[04:29] I made one video on some meal stuff I did.

[04:31] And I would say that for us, we kind of swing a little bit like a pendulum

[04:34] where I only like making business content.

[04:38] The team will urge me to not make business specific content

[04:42] so that we can appeal to a wider audience from time to time.

[04:45] And usually like, the more I do this, I'm like,

[04:46] I don't want to.

[04:48] And then I swing back over here.

[04:49] And I'm willing to know that the volume drops.

[04:52] And I'll just tell you, let me just share this experience with you.

[04:54] So we did a workshop here, that's why I set up like this.

[04:58] And I asked the room, I said, hey, of the content that I make,

[05:02] which you guys are consuming like the case study stuff,

[05:04] where we like build out a sales team and like how we do onboarding

[05:07] and like all that stuff.

[05:08] And who here is consuming like lessons to my younger self.

[05:13] The whole room was this side.

[05:16] And so even though these got one-third the views of these ones,

[05:19] sometimes this can introduce people,

[05:21] like the right people will then just think about it as top of funnel.

[05:24] Like this gets more people in, they'll see other stuff you have.

[05:26] And then they'll go down the longer niche,

[05:29] more niche videos that's specific to them.

[05:31] Now the other people who just come for that,

[05:33] although wait till you have your next one of that

[05:35] and then you too, but whatever we'll display it to them.

[05:38] So that's from a topic perspective.

[05:40] I would say if you do like three to one, four to one,

[05:43] in terms of your longs, like one I go a little bit wider

[05:46] and the rest I still stay on topic,

[05:48] you'll probably get the best of both worlds.

[05:50] What I would tell you though is that I think

[05:52] your stuff's really good and I think you just need to get.

[05:56] You need to learn more presentation skills.

[06:01] And that's okay, that's not like this is me trying to help.

[06:05] And so I think that you could probably take the same content

[06:07] you're currently making and just simply structure it better

[06:11] and you'd probably get 10 times the views.

[06:13] A side note for you guys is you'll notice the bigger the creator,

[06:15] usually the less frequent they actually make videos.

[06:17] And it's because they realize just power laws exist,

[06:19] which is that if you spend 10 times more time on one video,

[06:23] it doesn't get 10 times the views,

[06:25] sometimes they get 100 times the views.

[06:28] And so like especially platforms nowadays

[06:31] are so heavily relying on quality,

[06:34] you create the quantity to figure out the quality.

[06:39] And so in the beginning more people make lots of content

[06:41] and then you start figuring out the stuff that works,

[06:43] figuring out the stuff that works.

[06:44] And then you'll notice that they're like,

[06:45] oh man, well we did spend more time on the video.

[06:48] Okay, well if we're gonna keep making videos like that,

[06:50] I don't think we can make this money,

[06:51] but it's okay because you make it up

[06:52] on the fact that the total quality of that

[06:54] and it gets shared more people watch it longer.

[06:56] And I think Mr. B said this, but it was like,

[06:59] if you make 10 videos or you spend 10 times

[07:03] and you make that one video 20% better

[07:06] in terms of AVD or click through rate,

[07:08] you don't get 10 times the views,

[07:09] you get 100 times the views.

[07:11] So you get a disproportionate return for quality.

[07:14] And so I think it's fine from the niche concept perspective,

[07:18] but I would go really deep on the topic

[07:20] and try and keep it as congruent

[07:23] with the packaging of the video,

[07:25] which is where a lot of people lose off.

[07:27] And you need to assess about your first 30 seconds.

[07:29] But like this last weekend I watched,

[07:32] my top 35 YouTube videos,

[07:34] I watched the first three minutes of all of them.

[07:36] And I wanted to figure out like,

[07:37] what was it that I did in these videos

[07:39] that I didn't do in other videos

[07:40] that had similar average view duration,

[07:43] but I didn't, like I didn't carry as many people throw.

[07:47] And I'll just share this with you,

[07:51] the three p's that I found at least for us,

[07:53] which is Promise, Proof, Path.

[07:57] And so you wanna cover that,

[07:59] and this is where this is for you

[08:01] in terms of the big differences between educators

[08:03] and entertainers, they don't think that way.

[08:06] And maybe I'll find out in two years I'm wrong here,

[08:08] but this is what I think right now,

[08:10] which is that like there's a huge obsession

[08:13] of like match the exact words of the headline

[08:16] with the first however many seconds of the video

[08:18] confirmed the thumbnail in the background.

[08:21] And that's really, because if you say,

[08:23] hey, we're gonna crush a Lamborghini

[08:24] and they go and it's a talking head,

[08:25] there's no Lamborghini, they're like screw this

[08:27] and they're out, right?

[08:29] But if you're educating, then I think the Lamborghini

[08:33] in our situation is proof,

[08:36] is the big, biggest lights of why should I listen to you?

[08:40] Sure, I wanna learn more about guarantees, okay?

[08:42] But why should I listen to you?

[08:45] And if you can answer that as quickly as possible,

[08:48] like the videos that, like when I looked at my top ones,

[08:51] it was just like, hey, I saw my company for $46.2 million

[08:54] a big part of that was that we had a guarantee

[08:56] that beat all of our competitors.

[08:57] And so we did four things that we used

[08:59] that made our guarantee stronger.

[09:02] Done, and if that's what I said the video is about,

[09:04] they're like, okay, there's a promise

[09:06] of what he's gonna help me do, there's a path

[09:08] and I've proved for why should listen to this guy.

[09:11] And so you wanna have that.

[09:13] Like what's in it for me and why should I believe you?

[09:16] And then the path in my opinion is just to show

[09:18] that there's structure and you can set expectations

[09:20] and then meet the expectations.

[09:21] I think that's more about watch time.

[09:22] The first two are about why should I stay

[09:25] and then that's what's gonna happen.

[09:27] I will probably write a book on branding at some point.

[09:30] I think I have significantly increased my understanding

[09:32] what a brand is.

[09:34] And so I think first starting with the term of defining it,

[09:38] which is it's an association between two things.

[09:40] Like that's what a brand is.

[09:42] It's between things that people know

[09:43] as people that they don't know.

[09:45] And so branding is also worth for teaching.

[09:47] Like if I say, if I were a hat in every video,

[09:52] then people start to associate the hat with me.

[09:55] If I provide value eventually,

[09:57] you can take the hat off and people still associate the value

[10:00] with the hat.

[10:02] Fundamentally that's what branding is.

[10:04] And so if you're trying to make content

[10:07] about a certain topic, they will associate you with that topic.

[10:10] And so if you wanna be known for certain things,

[10:12] like the background, everything that goes into it,

[10:15] people make associations.

[10:17] That's how we learn.

[10:18] And so there are three elements to brand.

[10:21] The first is the strength of the influence.

[10:24] When people see me or see a logo or see something,

[10:27] does it change their behavior?

[10:29] And so if we were to go to the etymology,

[10:30] the word basically where it first began,

[10:32] branding was like if I branded a cow, right?

[10:34] You brand accounts.

[10:35] It's got to mark on it.

[10:37] The reason for that was because it would change people's behavior.

[10:39] If I saw a cow that didn't have a brand,

[10:40] a cow that did have a brand,

[10:42] I would maybe catch this cow,

[10:44] I would leave it alone, I do whatever.

[10:45] But the one that has ricks,

[10:47] logo on it, I might give it back to Rick.

[10:48] Right, kill Rick, or kill the cow, if I hate Rick,

[10:50] or it's still the cow if he either way, the brand,

[10:53] I would treat this cow differently

[10:55] than the cow that had no brand.

[10:56] And so brands change behavior at scale.

[10:59] That's why they're so valuable.

[11:00] And so the question is from an influence,

[11:03] is what percentage of people

[11:05] does it change their behavior?

[11:06] If it changes a lot of people's behavior,

[11:08] Donald Trump changes a lot of people's behavior.

[11:10] Now, the next question is,

[11:12] is that behavior going towards or is going away?

[11:15] For some people, it's very strongly towards

[11:17] and other people's very strongly away,

[11:19] but he changes people's behavior.

[11:20] So he has strong, he's strong brand

[11:22] from an influence perspective.

[11:24] The directionality is going to depend on the person.

[11:26] And then the next piece, the third piece,

[11:28] is just the reach, which is how many people in general

[11:30] have this association with you.

[11:32] And so if you're thinking, I want to build a brand,

[11:34] then you think about the hypothetical max

[11:35] of what a brand would be, which is you'd want,

[11:38] as many people as you can possibly,

[11:40] moving towards you and all changing their behavior

[11:43] at once when they see your thing.

[11:45] That would be the hypothetical max of a brand.

[11:47] Right, like Taylor Swift has a brand that's very close to this.

[11:50] Everyone knows who she is.

[11:52] She is a very strong brand in terms of changing people's

[11:54] behavior, and they tend to move in the direction

[11:57] that she wants them to go.

[11:58] So I also relatively reject the concept

[12:01] of all publicity is good publicity.

[12:05] I would just say all publicity is publicity.

[12:07] It will increase the reach of your brand.

[12:09] It won't increase necessarily these two,

[12:11] but it will increase the reach.

[12:12] More people know about you.

[12:14] And so it's just being specific about what a brand

[12:16] actually is.

[12:17] And so if you understand that a brand is built

[12:19] for associations, then you're also very careful

[12:22] about who you choose to appear next to.

[12:26] And so there's a reason that I don't speak on stages anymore

[12:31] that I don't own.

[12:32] Mostly because the audience will associate me

[12:34] with the other speakers.

[12:35] And I often don't want to be associated with the other speakers.

[12:39] Podcasts, even to a certain degree, have the same thing.

[12:42] They spend an hour with me and this other person.

[12:44] And I've become more and more strict about this

[12:46] to the point where I really don't appear,

[12:50] like I'm not really trying to appear with anyone anymore.

[12:52] You are always going to be the purest version of your brand.

[12:55] Like you are your brand.

[12:57] And so you leaning into more of you

[13:00] is the stuff that's going to accomplish these things.

[13:02] And if some people are turned away from you, that's fine.

[13:05] But what we can do to change that is we try and reach

[13:07] as many people as we can.

[13:09] And we try and provide value to these people

[13:11] so that they change the behavior and ideally go towards us.

[13:14] I just wanted to draw that out for you guys

[13:16] to thought, hopefully that was helpful.

[13:19] Mitch versus White algorithm, big picture here,

[13:22] don't worry about it.

[13:23] Like always just align your objective with the platform.

[13:27] Like hacks are stupid.

[13:30] Because if you grow off of a hack, like hashtags, work,

[13:33] or whatever, as soon as they close the loop,

[13:35] because all platforms do, you would just go down to zero.

[13:37] It's not a long-term strategy.

[13:38] So just why do it in the short term if it's not going to work

[13:40] long-term?

[13:42] The long-term strategy of every platform is to keep people

[13:44] in the platform.

[13:45] And so they want you to make content

[13:46] that lots of people click on.

[13:47] And that lots of people watch all the way through.

[13:49] And ideally, watch something else from you.

[13:51] So everything that they do in the algorithm is just

[13:54] to always optimize for those three things.

[13:57] And that's not going to change.

[13:58] Now, the math they do to code it might change.

[14:01] But the objective will always be the same.

[14:03] And so if you align your objective with the algorithms

[14:05] objective, you will never have an issue.

[14:08] And that goes for shorts.

[14:10] It goes for long.

[14:10] It's like that's why the hook is so important.

[14:12] Because they will see that a lot more people

[14:15] are making a path to the first three seconds.

[14:16] So we will show it to more people.

[14:17] And if a lot of people are watching all the way through,

[14:19] they'll show it to even more people.

[14:20] And that's all it is, because we're

[14:21] aligning our objective with theirs.

[14:23] That's it.

[14:24] OK.

[14:26] Short versus longs.

[14:30] In the beginning, think about a long

[14:31] as just many shorts put together.

[14:34] Just from, like, if we have that path that I was talking about,

[14:37] like, think about your path as the seven shorts

[14:39] that you're going to strain together.

[14:40] You just don't have necessarily 60 seconds.

[14:42] They have to get it.

[14:43] You can get it 90 seconds, whatever.

[14:44] But you still structure them the same way.

[14:47] And that will be beneficial for you.

[14:49] But in terms of longs, there's only three formats.

[14:53] You've got lists, steps, and stories.

[14:55] And you can enter mix all three of them.

[14:57] So you can have a list of things

[14:59] and have steps within the list.

[15:02] And then tell stories about each step.

[15:04] But all three can be intermixed.

[15:06] Because that's fundamentally like what content is.

[15:08] It's lists, steps, and stories.

[15:10] Volume, max.

[15:13] So from a volume perspective, we put out, if you want to

[15:16] like blow your mind, we put out 350 pieces a week.

[15:20] So it put 50 pieces out a day across all platforms.

[15:23] I would start with something that you can commit to.

[15:26] And then basically, you just keep ramping up.

[15:28] And the big, the big flex on this is understanding

[15:31] where you get double triple, quintuple, quintuple dips

[15:35] on content.

[15:36] And so a lot of people don't know this,

[15:38] but the highest leverage thing that I do with my time

[15:40] is I make tweets.

[15:42] Those tweets are actually the life source of everything.

[15:45] So my tweets, which I think you have to have a couple

[15:50] ways that you want to capture.

[15:51] Everyone captures content differently.

[15:53] But for me, if I get an idea, I can tweet it in two seconds.

[15:56] It's not hard for me to do that.

[15:58] And so by doing that, I capture moments throughout the day.

[16:02] And then when we do record with the team,

[16:04] they'll pull up my tweets and be like, what was this about?

[16:06] And then I have content on that.

[16:08] And then when they're like, what do we

[16:09] capture in this Instagram?

[16:09] They take my tweet.

[16:11] And so I get, and then the tweets themselves become reals.

[16:14] And I can also say the tweet out loud and make it a video.

[16:17] And so all of these things all stem from one place.

[16:20] And when I had Jim launch before I was public,

[16:22] this actually was an old habit of mine.

[16:24] Because I actually had this big email thread to myself, which

[16:26] was like lessons and failures throughout the year.

[16:30] And every year, I kept a one email thread

[16:31] that whenever I learned something, I would just send it

[16:33] to that thread.

[16:34] So I keep it.

[16:36] And I just replaced that with Twitter.

[16:37] And I just now word them slightly better.

[16:42] But I think you need to have a repository

[16:44] for where your ideas are going to go as they come up throughout the week.

[16:47] If you don't know topics that you can go on,

[16:50] look at your calendar, look at every single meeting

[16:52] you had that week, and what you spent your time on.

[16:55] And that will give you more than enough content to talk

[16:57] or yeah, this meeting.

[16:58] And one of my clients had this issue with her order bump.

[17:02] And it wasn't working.

[17:02] And so this is what we did.

[17:04] Great content.

[17:05] Like, unless you look retroactively,

[17:06] you might not think about it when you're on the spot.

[17:09] And so one is that I always, I document in real time

[17:12] through tweets or emails, do whatever you want.

[17:14] You have notes on your phone.

[17:15] Two is I look at my calendar.

[17:17] Like, what did I do this last week?

[17:18] That was interesting.

[17:19] Or like that I learned or something that came up

[17:21] from meeting perspective.

[17:22] The third category is far past.

[17:24] So like, what are the big lessons that have

[17:26] that changed or shifted my beliefs that are valuable to somebody else?

[17:31] And so we've got far past.

[17:33] You've got recent past of just your calendar.

[17:34] You've got real time, which you do your tweet dumps on.

[17:37] And then the fourth category can look at

[17:39] is what I call manufactured, which is like,

[17:41] I lived on $100 for a month, which is much closer

[17:44] to entertainment.

[17:45] I don't really do much of that.

[17:46] But it is another bucket of topics of content.

[17:49] I started a school community from scratch.

[17:51] And this is what I did.

[17:52] That would be manufactured.

[17:54] And so that's why I think about it

[17:56] from a topical perspective that keeps it both interesting

[17:59] and less that we never have a lack of content.

[18:04] We always have stuff.

[18:05] How do you get those frameworks out of yourself?

[18:07] Because I think that's one thing that sets you really

[18:09] fired, is that you framework everything?

[18:11] Do you have a method to turn it?

[18:12] Yeah.

[18:13] I actually have an answer to this now.

[18:15] I've gotten that question a million times

[18:16] but I do have an answer now.

[18:18] So like the framework for making frameworks

[18:21] is that even if I'll just use the micro story

[18:23] I had about promised path plan, right?

[18:25] If I have to do something repeatedly and I have to do it

[18:28] over and over again, I want to create some sort of templates

[18:29] that don't have to remake the same decisions

[18:31] or have to re-solve the same problems.

[18:32] And so I tend to then drink in a ton of data.

[18:35] So I watched 35 of my YouTube videos, the intros.

[18:37] And then I was like, OK, what are all the things

[18:40] that happen each one of us?

[18:41] I wrote them all down.

[18:42] And then I was like, OK, well, this one had five things.

[18:45] This one had seven things.

[18:46] This one had two things.

[18:47] OK, well, what did they all have in common?

[18:48] Well, they all had these three things.

[18:50] And so then you narrow down to what

[18:51] are the few fact basically delete everything.

[18:54] And if we only had these three things that they all had.

[18:57] And so this was the same thing when we had Jim Lach.

[19:00] I didn't know how to retain customers.

[19:02] I was really good at selling them.

[19:03] But the Jim members, like I had industry average shirt.

[19:06] And we did to solve that problem was that I got my customer

[19:11] base.

[19:11] I said, who here has less than 3% monthly turn for six

[19:14] rate months?

[19:15] And so there are 20 Jims that had that out of how

[19:17] many thousand.

[19:18] And so I got them on a call and I said, OK, tell me every single

[19:21] thing you do to retain customers.

[19:23] And each one of them had 20 plus things that they were doing.

[19:25] But when I interviewed all of them, all of them,

[19:28] were only doing five things in common.

[19:30] And those became the five horseman retention, which

[19:32] became the framework for how we retain customers in a Jim.

[19:36] And so you drink in a ton of data, you get everything.

[19:40] And then you circle where are the commonalities.

[19:43] And then if I want to make it sexy, I try to have them

[19:45] to be the same letter, promised path plan.

[19:47] Easy to remember.

[19:48] Or make it an acronym, something like that.

[19:49] But that's the real process.

[19:52] And then the naming thing is the super easy.

[19:55] That's how it makes framework.

[19:56] Good.

[19:57] So I'll say this, and this is your hopefully

[20:02] put a lot of you guys at ease.

[20:04] I actually don't think you can be canceled.

[20:07] I just don't think it's true.

[20:08] You can only be canceled if a platform, if all means of communication

[20:12] that you can't communicate with an audience,

[20:13] are removed from you.

[20:14] Like you are unable to communicate.

[20:17] And you stop making content.

[20:20] R. Kelly has been canceled, because he also

[20:22] stopped making content.

[20:23] Now I'm trying to think of the most hypothetical

[20:25] issue of terrible scenario.

[20:27] I would bet, I mean, you look at Kanye.

[20:29] He can say anti-Semitic stuff, whatever.

[20:31] He continues to make content.

[20:35] And people still continue to follow him.

[20:37] Like you become uncancelable as long as you don't accept that you

[20:40] can be canceled.

[20:41] And I think fundamentally that's it.

[20:43] Now, from a controversy perspective on that,

[20:46] this sheet that I had earlier about reach,

[20:48] controversy helps you get reach.

[20:50] The other two, maybe maybe not.

[20:52] And so thinking about it, it's basically the same as getting

[20:57] on a trending topic.

[20:59] To me, controversy and trends are the more or less the same thing.

[21:03] Like more people on average will be interested,

[21:05] or at least click, it drives CTR.

[21:08] But what do I want them to?

[21:10] I would not want to associate with a lot of different

[21:12] controversies.

[21:13] So I don't talk about them.

[21:15] I personally don't talk about that stuff.

[21:18] It's just, I don't care enough.

[21:21] But yeah, some people do.

[21:22] I don't.

[21:23] Feel of a good feeling organic in terms of making content

[21:25] where the topics come from.

[21:26] Algorithm stuff, short-s versus longs.

[21:29] Find one person to hire 10 people who's really smart,

[21:31] overpay them.

[21:32] Volume comes from commits what you can.

[21:36] And then slowly ramp up.

[21:37] The volume is really so that you learn the quality more

[21:39] than anything else.

[21:40] And then product market fit.

[21:41] The customers that you have are going to come from the niche content

[21:44] even if it's the answer to views.

[21:46] So you want question to be true?

[21:47] H, C, or started hiring a few books?

[21:51] I did both.

[21:53] So I first started with the agency.

[21:55] And then I was like, OK, now we're really serious.

[21:58] Basically, when I sold Jim Montju, I was like, OK, now

[22:00] I can really do this.

[22:01] When I had Jim Montju, I was just starting some of the YouTube

[22:03] videos and podcast.

[22:06] I had a podcast agency that just posted it.

[22:08] And I had a YouTube agency that posted it.

[22:10] And then when we were like, OK, we're really doing this.

[22:13] I brought Caleb and he then started managing the agencies.

[22:16] And then he hired people in house to replace them.

[22:19] And basically, I literally outlined the step in the book on agencies.

[22:23] But there's going to be a period where they work and your team

[22:26] works.

[22:26] So you pay twice.

[22:28] And until your team beats their team, and I tell them,

[22:31] I'm going to beat you.

[22:32] That's all I'm trying to do here.

[22:34] And as soon as our team beats their team, they go away.

[22:36] How do you actually find a good agency or a good,

[22:40] the creator that they're actually.

[22:42] Talk to 10.

[22:43] Listen to all of them.

[22:45] You'll quickly see who has their shit together and who doesn't.

[22:50] You can also bid them to, against each other if you really want to.

[22:52] But I rarely do that.

[22:54] I usually just quickly see who's good and who isn't.

[22:57] And I try to go off for referrals of people.

[22:59] Because good, like I'll say this, the best agencies don't need

[23:02] to run ads.

[23:05] Like they have more customers than they can handle.

[23:08] Food.

[23:09] Nam, Nam.

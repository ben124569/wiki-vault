[00:00] So my last company for $46.2 million that was Jim launch and one of the keys was learning how to grow businesses.

[00:07] And so you might not know this but there's two ways that you can double a business.

[00:10] One is you double the amount of customers that you sell every month.

[00:13] The other is you double how much they're worth.

[00:16] This video will give you seven things that we did to double how much customers were worth

[00:20] in our companies and the ones that we buy in Investance today.

[00:22] And so this is a money checklist that you can literally immediately do by the end of the video

[00:26] that I do when I buy a company to make all the customers more valuable and ultimately make way more money.

[00:31] So here's our outline. And just to give you a little bit more context on this,

[00:35] I, Jim launch was a company that licensed to Jim owners. We had over 5,000 locations

[00:39] that licensed our business model. And one of the things that they did in the consulting process,

[00:44] which I learned before this as a white color consultant for defense contract and which you don't care about,

[00:48] but that's okay, is the consulting process. And the way that we discovered answers to hard questions was

[00:54] we would survey a large percentage of the population. Then we'd find the people who represented

[01:00] the solution that we wanted. So in this instance, I looked at all the Jim owners and said,

[01:04] who is the top 1% of Jims that have the lowest turn? And I said, if you've maintained that for six months or

[01:10] more, tell me what you're doing. And so I hopped on the phone with every single one of those Jims.

[01:14] And that each one of them gave me 30 different things that they were doing to decrease

[01:17] turn. It gave people a stay longer. But when I looked at all of the data across

[01:21] every one of these Jims that were on the top 1%, all of them were doing five things. And so I'll

[01:26] give you those five and I'll also add two more that we decided to do that cut our turn in half,

[01:30] which ultimately made Jim much a sellable company. And we've now implemented this since in all the

[01:34] businesses that we buy. So the first one is exit interviews. Now, if you're in a business that you can't

[01:41] do that, that's fine, but I'd almost recommend that you do it. And I'm going to break down each of these

[01:47] in detail on that board as soon as you're going to do it. So I'm going to go through each of them

[01:55] as we go. So let's start with exit interviews. So exit interviews have this amazing thing that we

[02:02] figured out. So the Jim owners would say, hey, when somebody wants to cancel, we obligate someone and

[02:05] we'd ex-stigust it up front. Anyone someone's signs if we say just FYI, if you do choose to cancel

[02:10] or when you choose to cancel, we just ask that you do an extra interview. And the main reason for

[02:14] that is to that we can make the product better. Because if every time someone cancels, we get to learn

[02:18] one thing, that overtime will be able to plug all the little holes in our product and people stay

[02:21] again and again. And so what happens is you get on the phone with this person and you say, why so

[02:27] sad, right? More or less. And then they will then usually need to vent. And so let me give you the

[02:35] rule of the anger book. So my first or second business mentor, I worked at his, he was a furrier

[02:41] and he said only one person can be the anger bro. And this is how it works. If someone's angry

[02:45] about you or your product or your business, the only way that you can actually solve the problem

[02:50] is get more angry than them. But you're getting angry not at them, but at the problem. And so

[02:55] they're angry at the problem. And then they feel validated when you're even more angry. And guess

[02:58] what happens? If someone comes in and they're like, this is dog shit. I had such a terrible experience

[03:02] you're like, that is ridiculous that they had the experience. I can't believe you went through

[03:05] that. That's absurd. We have to get to the bottom this right now. We will, we promise you,

[03:10] we will fix this for you. Thank you so much for telling me. But I'm more upset than you are about

[03:14] this. Now what happens is they will then say, well, I mean, it wasn't that big of a deal. Like,

[03:18] I appreciate your business own and things happen. Like, thank you so much. They feel validated.

[03:22] And they start trying to call them you, do you? I guess what happens? You win. All right. And so

[03:26] half the time when we'd get on the phone with these people, half we would just say, hey, we're

[03:32] angering you. And we said, let me make it up to you. And so we'd say, hey, all the money that

[03:40] you've paid up to this point, I'm going to give you and you can pick them out or you can give the whole

[03:43] thing. So I'm going to credit that towards you stay so that I can make it up to you. And if after

[03:48] that period of time, you still aren't happy with the solution that I now have given the fact

[03:52] I know you're upset, no worries. But at least let me help try and make it up to you. By doing that,

[03:57] you can either save them or if they say something to the extent of like, well, I thought I was

[04:03] going to get way more help. I thought any more implementation, any more whatever, any more handholding,

[04:07] believe it or not. This is what's crazy. Many of these people actually get upsold. And you say,

[04:13] you know what? It's armistake. You are actually sold into the wrong thing. You need way more help

[04:18] than what we currently giving you at this silver level. But you'd be perfect for gold. Because

[04:22] that actually what you described as the problem is literally what gold does. And so let me make it up to you.

[04:28] Let me take everything you paid for silver and credit it towards gold and let's get you taken care of.

[04:33] And by doing that, we took a negative and actually made a more valuable customer. And so if

[04:37] half your customers or half of that half, upsell to something that's two times or three times more expensive,

[04:42] you're a revenue-turn just disappears. Like, very smart businessman when I say revenue-turn

[04:47] it means the amount of revenue you lose because if you lose half the customers, but the other

[04:50] half spend twice as much money, you actually don't lose revenue. Now, the other half say,

[04:56] f-u and then they leave. And that's okay. And that's part of the game. But if you can save half

[05:01] of the people by simply adding this one step, guess what? You cut down on chart. So that is number one

[05:07] ex-interviews. The next one was reachouts. Now let me explain what this means. So I had to come to this

[05:15] conclusion after looking at all the data across all the locations we had who were doing really

[05:20] well. Now a lot of them did this in different ways. But my hypothesis around why this works so well

[05:25] is they basically approximate a real relationship. So the reason that most gyms and many small

[05:33] businesses that are recurring, especially in the service industry, gets stuck around 100 to 150

[05:38] customers, is because it's something called Dumbar's Number. And so Dumbar's Number is a postulate

[05:43] that people can only manage 150 close relationships or medium relationships in their mind.

[05:48] After that, it's just too many people. And so because of that, without any systems, you can

[05:52] usually manage about 150 people, which guess what is what most people's business cap at until they

[05:57] have systems. And so the reachouts essentially approximate what you do to have a personal relationship

[06:03] with someone. But you put it into a system. And here's the key part about these reachouts is that

[06:08] the reachouts don't need to be necessarily about the product you sell or their experiences a customer.

[06:12] But more checking in on the human being overall. And it doesn't need to be every, you know,

[06:16] every 14 days and you don't necessarily even need to sell that. And this is the key point.

[06:20] It's you're not selling the reachout. You sell the product. You sell the membership. You sell the

[06:24] subscription. You sell whatever. And then you just do this because on the back end, you over-deliver.

[06:30] You like, and one of the key points of this is you can do more than you say you do.

[06:36] Like, you're offer that you give someone, you don't have to tell them everything you do.

[06:40] You need to tell them enough to get them to buy and that everything else becomes surprising to light.

[06:45] And so you can know that every 14 to 21 days, you're going to reach out to them and say,

[06:50] hey, how's life? Or hey, I saw that your daughter is going to college. Or hey, I saw that you went

[06:55] to that concert this weekend. How was it? What it does is it creates a relationship. And it's a

[07:00] lot easier. You can write this one down. Lot easier to quit a membership than it is to quit a relationship.

[07:05] And so what we want to do is facilitate that bond that people will have. And so what we did is we

[07:09] systematized this so that every trainer, I'm just giving you what we did so that you can make it

[07:13] work for your business. Every single trainer had 40 or so customers that they were responsible for.

[07:18] And they reached out on a 14 to 21 day. So if you got 40 customers, it means you reach out to 10 or

[07:23] 15 people a week, not a big deal. And you just check in, which hopefully you want to do anyways.

[07:28] But by systematizing it, we created personalized relationships at scale and cut down church.

[07:33] Also, that becomes an early warning system because if someone does have an issue,

[07:36] they reach out to the person they already have already in communication with. So it's not this

[07:40] like who do I talk to? They just talk to the person they're already talking to. So you get way faster

[07:43] feedback from the front lines. Thing number three. So we got this guy, reach out. Next one was events.

[07:49] So this is member events. Now no matter what business you have, whether you're real estate agent,

[07:53] you're a plumber, you're a gym owner, you're an agency, it doesn't matter. Having events for your

[07:58] customers shows that you care. But more importantly, you can also make money from them. So let me

[08:04] explain. So out the events, we made the events for everyone. So customers could bring their friends,

[08:09] they could bring other potential customers. And by doing this, it actually became lead gen for us too.

[08:13] So we more than paid for the events in the sales that we were able to do with the events. And so if you say,

[08:19] hey, I'm just going to give you the gym example. Hey, bring a friend to our events. Everybody brings a friend.

[08:23] Great. You have twice as many people there as you normally would. And then of course, you make a

[08:27] crazy offer while you're there for anybody's a friend. You say, hey, because as an aside, if you don't know this,

[08:32] referrals are typically worth two to three times more than the normal cold customers. And so if anyone,

[08:37] if you should pay for any lead, the most it should be referrals, or be willing to pay the most for referrals.

[08:42] And so out of events, the way that we do this, and I'll give you the, I'm going to give you a little

[08:48] tip here. So number four is handwritten cards. I'm going to show you how these work together. All right. So

[08:55] that means handwritten card. We found out that handwritten cards work every six-ish weeks that also

[09:01] tends to co-inside with the cadence that you can run events for your members. Now, an event,

[09:07] if you run it, afterwards your turn will go up. People get a lot of value and they say, you know what?

[09:11] I got an a value on a leave. And so the key to making events work is the open loop. You have to tell them

[09:16] when the next event is going to be while or right before they have this event. So they always have

[09:23] something to look forward to. Otherwise, they'll get the value and then the leave. And I found this out the

[09:26] hard way, which is why I'm telling you. Always have the next thing in place. Now, the key to making

[09:30] the referral thing work is that you send them a handwritten card with their name. You sign it

[09:36] whatever. You say, hey, we appreciate you. We know that you could choose, you know, a lot of places to fly.

[09:39] Thank you for choosing Alex Airlines. Whatever. Now, here's the PS statement. This is the important

[09:44] mark. You put PS at the bottom and you say, take a picture of this card and text it to a friend

[09:52] in a three way. Keep your mind out of the gutter. In a three way and that way your friend is

[10:00] invited to. So you write them the handwritten card. You remind them of the event that's coming up.

[10:04] So that one that shows that you carry took the time to you give them a benefit to the theme of

[10:09] the event. You call it crazy sock, Wednesday, whatever. Who cares? All right. Then, that's obviously a

[10:14] gym scenario. If you have marketing, you would make it theme around something else. Then, you say invite

[10:19] another best owner. And if they have this picture at the door, they'll get light in. And so they then

[10:23] get kudos from their friend to inviting them to a free event where you generate leads from it. And so

[10:28] you reinforce the relationship with a customer. You reinforce the personal tie. And you give them

[10:32] a benefit. We're also allowing them to give a benefit to somebody who becomes a customer of yours.

[10:36] And by doing these two things together, check, check. We kept more customers. So the fifth one.

[10:42] And this is, this is, if I had to, I'm, I'm getting to the best ones last because, uh, yellow. All right.

[10:47] Uh, this was a tenance tracking. All right. This one's big. All right. We're getting into the meeting,

[10:57] meeting meetings. The double meets. The double meet retention tactics. Come down Jason. All right.

[11:03] All right. So. So we have a tenance tracking. So what we were able to see from tracking attendance

[11:11] at our gyms is let's say it's, it's something you own a three times a week membership. So you have three

[11:15] times a week, they shop, then three, then two, then two, then one, then zero, and they cancel. All right.

[11:20] This is pretty much, you could see it. You could just see it clear as day. People just start, they

[11:24] fall, they come down once and then they slowly trick off and then they cancel, which by the way,

[11:29] the easiest correlation with cancellation is lack of consumption. So if you want people to stay in

[11:34] pay, you've got to get them to use it. And one of the things I had in the gym world that I think

[11:38] is worth writing down for anyone is that no matter how cheap a gym membership is, a gym membership you never

[11:44] use is never worth it. And so whether it's five dollars or fifty dollars, if someone doesn't use it,

[11:50] even if the most amazing thing in the world, they will not keep paying for it at some point

[11:54] because it's a waste is a waste. And so on the flip side, almost no one complains about a gym membership

[12:00] they use every day. No matter how expensive it is, because if you use it every day, you're going to

[12:04] want to keep using it. And so the goal is consumption. And so a ten-tracking helped us get an early

[12:10] indicator that someone is about to fall off. And if you don't have early indicators in your business,

[12:16] that's what you need to have because churn, people canceling is a lagging indicator. It means it

[12:20] happens after the bad thing happened. We want to find out the moment the bad things happen so we

[12:24] can turn something in tragic to magic. That's a Disney thing. But what we found is that if we found

[12:29] that somebody went and they missed one session of the three that they were supposed to go to,

[12:33] if we reached out to them a bunch of times here the next week in this scenario, say miss, boom,

[12:42] they're back at three, back at three, and we saved them because they found out that someone was actually

[12:47] paying attention to whether they were coming or not. And so they felt accountable to showing up

[12:52] because someone is paying attention. And so this works for whatever it is that you sell is you want

[12:56] to make sure that they know that you're paying attention to whether they're consuming it or not.

[13:01] And the way that you actually do these reachouts is reverse of leads. Okay? So let me explain.

[13:08] With a lead, like a marketing lead, you reach out a lot of times the first day,

[13:13] fewer times the second day, fewer times the third day, fewer times the fourth day, and eventually

[13:17] you stop reaching out to them, right? Because they didn't buy the none interested, whatever.

[13:21] With customers, when you reach out, you reach out once the first day. If they don't respond,

[13:26] reach out twice the next day. They still don't respond. You reach out three times. Basically,

[13:30] escalate rather than de-escalate when it's a customer's joke. Hey, we need to figure this out.

[13:35] And by mapping this reach out structure to attendance tracking, you can go from this scenario to this

[13:42] scenario. And that's exactly what happened for us and for all the memberships that I've been

[13:45] appointed. So that covers attendance tracking. Let's go to number six. Also, a big beefy boy

[13:50] coming down Jason, which is onboarding. All right. This one is like one of those silent killers that you

[13:55] would not believe how important and effective it is to implement this within your business.

[14:01] So now, if you have a one to many type solution where you're onboarding, you know, you have

[14:06] a hundred customers day that get sold because you have a five dollar amount, $10 or whatever thing,

[14:10] you just want to automate the onboarding. If you have any type of service that you can

[14:14] possibly, I would say honestly, even if it's a hundred bucks a month, you can still do group on

[14:19] onboarding. And so the idea is that you want to have a clear choreographed experience for day one,

[14:27] all the way today, whatever day X. And you want to tell them, this is what's going to happen.

[14:34] And the key word in this whole thing is expectation setting. Is you want to set expectations

[14:42] and you want to reconfirme the buying process, buying decision. So essentially, you're reselling them

[14:52] on why they chose to buy for me to begin with. A lot of people in the first 24 hours is where they

[14:56] get cold feet, they back out, they say, hey, you know what charge back, refund whatever it is,

[15:01] they didn't even consume the thing it. And so you want to reconfirme the buying decision, tell them

[15:05] why I was a great idea, give other reasons that they didn't mention and also confirm the ones

[15:09] they used to buy. And then you say, this is the roadmap. This is what you can expect to see from us

[15:14] and the ideal client relationship. You simply set expectations, meet expectations, meet expectations,

[15:19] meet expectations. And if it's up to you, I would rather you set and meet multiple times rather than

[15:26] set 20 and then meet all 20 on this day. So let me give an example. If I had a marketing agency

[15:32] and let's say we did website design and SEO and whatever a bunch of other stuff. If I had a weekly

[15:38] cadence with them, where I said, hey, this is all the stuff we did in the last week, it would be more

[15:43] effective to say this is what we're working on today and the next day's then the minimum, like,

[15:48] hey, we finished that part and tomorrow working on this. In the same seven days, they're going to

[15:53] get seven positive feedback cycles with you and your business, of you setting expectations and meeting

[15:59] expectations. Even though it's the same work, simply taking the second to reach out to them

[16:04] and each of these scenarios to let them know what you did will get them to stay longer. Imagine you

[16:08] sign up in the next day that, hey, we're ready to this. We're like, oh, that's just recon from the

[16:11] buying decision and they met the expectations they set. And then you do it again and then again and again.

[16:16] And by the time day 30 comes around like, man, these guys are amazing. They're so on it. And that's what

[16:21] you want customers to think about you. And so you want to set the expectations, you want to recon

[16:25] from the decision and I like to think of something like a walkthrough, which is how do you use the

[16:30] thing, whatever it is, how do you use our service? If this happens, what do you do? And this process,

[16:34] you want to have this all over the place. Like this, you're going to repeat over and over and over and

[16:42] over and over and over and over again. Because they're not listening, they're on their phone,

[16:46] they've got their kids in the backseat, they don't really care that much about your business. They bought

[16:49] it one time on a whim, whatever. You want to make sure that at least one of the times they hear

[16:53] part of it and they can assemble the whole Mona Lisa picture together through the many times you told them.

[16:58] So onboarding, if you're not doing it, please for the love of God do it because you will be

[17:03] amazed at how many you will get, you could probably add one or two months to your recurring revenue

[17:09] by simply setting the expectation properly, reconframing this decision and walking them through

[17:14] exactly what they just bought. So that gives us our onboarding. And finally lucky number seven,

[17:21] unlockables. All right. So what's an unlockable? Great question Jason. Unlockables and milestones.

[17:28] Okay. Now this is going to be so painfully obvious and yet known, doesn't. What do you want a customer

[17:34] to do? Like really? You're like, what do you want a customer to actually do? Besides continues to

[17:38] stay in pay? There's other stuff too, right? So right off the bat, what I want someone to do is

[17:43] want them to activate. Now if you have a defined what activation is, you look at the customers that

[17:47] is say with you the longest and you ask them what are the things they did early that provided the

[17:50] most value. You can also serve this depending on the size of your customer base. You say, hey,

[17:53] what was the thing that provided the most value? And you can try and guess at this. Once you get this

[17:56] point, right, everything you do drives to activate customers. So for example, if you had a software that

[18:01] built landing pages, you might find out that if you get some of the switch to a customer or a

[18:05] rail rather than, you know, x-way as you saw for a dot, whatever their name is, as soon as they make

[18:09] that switch, they stay five times longer. You want to figure out what that activation point was.

[18:13] For Jim launch, it was if we get someone a $2,000 for seven days, the likely they stay and continue

[18:17] to pay was monstrous. And so we drove a lot of attention to trying to make sure people actually

[18:21] made a darn sale that was really big in material in the first week. Duh, right? If I have someone

[18:26] in weight loss, I want them to lose five pounds of one the first week. Duh. So these are these

[18:30] key points that seem like duh things, but if that's actually so important, why aren't we driving

[18:33] all over effort towards that thing? A different software company that I know, they call the first

[18:38] five clients problem, they had to get a trainer's onto a software and they realized that if they

[18:42] just got the trainer five clients, then they would never cancel. And so everything drove towards

[18:47] getting the person the first five customers and all of that is activation. So that's step one.

[18:52] Step two is, what else would I want from my customer? Well, I don't know you, but I would want

[18:58] to test a module, right? I mean, if I activated them and they're happy now, let me see if they can

[19:03] get me more customers. So I want to get a review, I want to get a test a module and you can do

[19:06] that in a variety of ways that you can do it post, they can leave you a review on a review site,

[19:10] they can leave you a personalized video, number different ways you do it, or all the ways,

[19:13] you can ask them to do those things and you get something else from them. Number three is I want

[19:18] to refer, right? You know people, why do you hate me? Why don't you want to tell your friends

[19:23] about my product? Do you hate them? Or do you hate me? You hate one of us, right? So we have

[19:27] about it as, and I think I used to, like, again, this is where we're going to work

[19:31] to the place and how big your business is, but like when I was like, young guy, I feel like,

[19:34] why do you hate me so much, Sarah? And she's like, what are you talking about? I don't hate you.

[19:37] I be like, you haven't sent any friends, or do you hate your friends? And if you're like,

[19:42] I don't hate my friends, I be like, then let's meet, let's hang out and introduce me. Let's do

[19:45] it three way and they're like, whoa, just kidding, ha ha, same jokes every time. Anyway, and so

[19:50] you do the text intro, you get it, you're like, hey, take a picture with me and Sarah,

[19:54] and we take the picture, I take it on her phone, we send it to her friend with me as the third person,

[19:59] that way they can ignore you, and you have it on the iPhone so it's all blue and everyone knows

[20:03] everyone's legit, but because of that they have a face that they don't know, the face they do

[20:08] know, and the face they do know is in the text message throughout, there's a can't be a dick to me,

[20:12] because they know that Sarah likes me, and that's how you can get referrals. Referrals number three,

[20:16] number four, and you're like, wait, how's this tiny retention? Don't worry, don't you worry,

[20:20] we'll get there, he's a sentient. So this is actually wild. There was a great research that was

[20:27] done by one of these big fortune, whatever companies, and they found out that the single greatest

[20:32] thing that you could do to retain customers is get them to buy something else, because at a certain

[20:37] point, people get this itch to buy. Like it's been a year since I bought something in this space,

[20:42] and if you don't satisfy them, like literally providing another offer to them, they will just go buy

[20:46] somewhere else. And so as silly as this sounds, sometimes the best way to retain someone is to sell

[20:52] someone again, and sell them something else or bigger. And so if we think about this from a

[20:57] reverse standpoint, if I had a customer, I would want them to activate, I want them to leave me

[21:01] a testimonial, I want them to send a referral, and I want them to buy more stuff, and more expensive

[21:05] stuff. Well, if that's what I want them to do, then for God's sake, why don't we make these things

[21:09] the unlockables? Now, the unlockables are another fancy word for bonuses, that someone gets

[21:20] after they do a certain thing. So if I want everyone to activate, then I might make whatever my

[21:24] KPI is for activation, get a big carrot on top of it. They get a big jackpot for doing this thing.

[21:29] Right? And so if I was in a digital environment, let's say I have a school community. So you can,

[21:34] say, hey, if you stayed for three months, you get this big mega training on ads that I did,

[21:39] and the reason I have it three months is because you got to do the fundamentals. But if you stay

[21:41] past one three, this unlocks, wow, boy do I have a bigger incentive to stay them on three?

[21:46] If I know I've been to get this big jackpot of value, and guess what I'm gonna do?

[21:49] And month three, and month six, and month nine. And the thing is, you want to go some little human

[21:55] behavior thing. You can actually extend this time on it. You can go three, and then you can go eight,

[21:59] and you can go month 15, like you can extend the time horizon between the big positive reinforcements,

[22:05] and then just make them bigger and better every time, and they look forward to them more and more.

[22:10] And so unlockables can either be on activity, meaning they did something. I'll give you this

[22:16] ad-street and if, you leave me in testimonial. I'll give you this ad-street and if, you send me

[22:21] a referral. I'll give you the ad-street and if, you buy the next level, or it can be off of tenure,

[22:26] which means they don't do anything besides staying pay, which hey, we're also happy to do that.

[22:31] You get this at month six, you get this at month three, you get this month eight,

[22:35] this month 15, whatever. And so the unlockables can get people to stay that extra time.

[22:41] And if you're not tracking this every month, which you absolutely should be,

[22:44] you should be able to tease that number up, you should see every month, okay, we're at 3.7

[22:47] months, all right, we're 4.2 months. All right, what do we do to get from 4.2 to 4.7?

[22:50] We need you from 4.7 to 5.6, and you just keep adding and plugging the holes in the bucket,

[22:55] because I promise you with retention, it's not the silver bullet. It's all of these things put together,

[23:01] and when we did this, it took our turn from 11 percent to 6 percent monthly. Now,

[23:08] let me walk you through the final thing to explain why this is worth it. So we're going to talk

[23:12] about retention. Why does this matter? All right, so let me give you a very simple example.

[23:17] Let's say you sell something that's $100 a month, okay? Great, awesome, it looks $100 a month.

[23:23] Now, let's say you're churn as in the percentage of people who leave every month, it's 10 percent.

[23:27] So if you got 100 customers, month later you've got 90s, 10 percent churn. Now, my lifetime value

[23:32] per customer is a thousand dollars. That means they stay on average 10 months. This is v1. This is

[23:39] pre everything about to show you. Now, if all we do, if you follow everything that I show you in this

[23:43] video, is you get that 10 percent. Let's say, what do we want to get it to? Survey says, give me a number.

[23:49] What do we want the churn to become? 6 percent, all right, that'll be tough for math. Let's go 5 percent.

[23:53] So we get churn from 10 percent to 5 percent. Doesn't seem like a big difference. You go from 10 to 5.

[23:59] All right, we decrease by 5 percent. Big what, right? Well, let me show you how big of a what it is,

[24:03] come down Jason. All right, it's that means that my new lifetime value per customer is $2,000.

[24:10] And while everyone else in your industry is assessing about how do I get more customers, how do I get

[24:14] more customers? If you can double how much your customers are worth, you more than double one

[24:19] you double your revenue. But secondly, you'll more than double your profit because you don't have to

[24:23] pay the additional cost of acquisition every time to make that extra revenue. And so all the

[24:26] saving drops straight to your bottom line. So the incremental margin on this is huge. And guess what

[24:32] other jackpot bonus you get? If everyone else can only spend, let's say if they're doing $3,000,

[24:37] $300 to get a customer, guess what, you can spend $600 to get a customer. That's if you're keeping

[24:44] $3,000, which I recommend. All right, so you can get whatever $650, you get the point. All right,

[24:49] per customer. So here's the crazy thing, is that if you can only spend $300, you might cap out,

[24:55] let's say a thousand dollars a day and a spend. But if you can spend $650, you might cap out at

[24:59] a hundred thousand a day and a spend. So getting a double on LTV, I'll give you an example

[25:03] for one of our businesses. One of our companies, we took, we won.9xLTV. Actually, really similar to this.

[25:09] It was actually, it was, it was 2000 to start and we took it to 3800. And we did this through a

[25:15] massive list that I'm going to show you in a second. But by putting, by going from 2000 to 3800,

[25:21] that's an eight, we went from $2 million per month in the business to $2 million per week.

[25:31] That, that's why this matters. So let's dive in. So we talked about what retention is, we talked about

[25:37] why it matters. You can massively make way more money by just changing the things you do inside the

[25:40] business. Also, you'll be a better business overall. But the third one was how to actually change it.

[25:45] So I'm going to give you a bonus number four, which is, okay, Alex, I haven't done any of these things.

[25:50] Which should I start with? If I was going to give you an order to order these things and I was just

[25:54] an aferious motherfucker, which I am, I did this, not in reverse order. I would probably think about

[26:01] this both in cost to put into place and then return from it. Because some of these things might be

[26:06] really powerful, but take a long time. And I'd rather you do this in order of like bang for buck.

[26:11] All right. So number one, would be onboarding. You literally just add one step in the process after

[26:17] someone gets closed and then you reaffirm the decision, you set the expectations and then you give

[26:22] them the roadmap. You give them the walkthrough, what's going to happen next. It's all you do.

[26:25] All right. And you talked to them, makes them feel like you're human that they didn't just pay money

[26:28] some glum big, gray box of money making. All right. So number one, we onboard. Number two is I would

[26:36] probably do unlockables. Main reason here is that you pretty much just set the incentive in place.

[26:40] Once you have it, it's like a one time fix. Like you do, you figure out what your unlockable is.

[26:44] And then you just set up when you want it to be. And for example, if you're currently people are

[26:48] currently staying four months, then put it in month five. Just trying to get them to get over that edge.

[26:52] Just give them something to look forward to at your moment. Right. So you want to just put it just

[26:56] path where they're currently canceling. So that would be the second thing that I would do.

[27:00] The third thing that I would do would be the exit interviews. That's a three.

[27:05] There we go. Because you can pretty much implement this quickly. And I think you as a founder.

[27:10] Especially if you're getting into this, this is so valuable. Like you get so much great data

[27:14] on what you can do better. And you have the opportunity to save the customer and you have the

[27:19] opportunity to ascend the customer. Like so, so high value. Definitely worth it.

[27:25] If I had to go number four here, attend is tracking. This one takes more work, but huge returns.

[27:31] And so I would say this one has super effective in terms of power. It just takes more work to do.

[27:37] This would probably be number one or number two in terms of like actual effect on retention.

[27:42] It just takes a little bit more work. So I would do one, two, and three first. All right.

[27:46] Let's do after that. I would say survey says number five. Right here, I would go reach out.

[27:52] We want to facilitate a human relationship. This takes a little bit of work because you got to

[27:55] disseminate customers between people. And if you don't have that, then you have to set up systems

[27:59] to automate some of those reachouts and make, and here's the key. If they know it's automated,

[28:03] it will not work. It has to be systematized, not automated. It's automated. Like how many times

[28:08] do you respond to the green text that's like obviously automated? Never. You don't care because

[28:14] it shows that they don't care. And so the best way, and this is a laylaism, the best way

[28:19] to get people to think that you care about them. This is a really key trick is to actually care about them.

[28:24] That's it. So reachouts. And then I would say these two, I would implement together. So we'll go

[28:29] six and seven because they're just such a perfect little marriage. Of doing the events in the

[28:34] invitations via handwritten cards. This is something that's just like fun. It's value at. The key is

[28:40] the open loop between the events and you get the referrals you get from the handwritten cards. So that's

[28:44] the order that I would do these in. And I've got something else for you, something extra sexy because

[28:48] you know, I love you. Little Easter egg for everybody else. Right now we've got the school

[28:52] games running. And if you don't know what that is, I'll tell you the outcome of it. Which is that

[28:58] right now 30.44% of people who start the games and finish their first month. All right, first month.

[29:08] Just finished their first month. Make their first dollar online. Which I cannot explain to you. Like

[29:15] going from here wherever you're at now, if you don't have a business to making your first dollar,

[29:19] is the hardest bridge to get over. There's so many things that feel unknown. And so the fact that

[29:24] we're getting 30.44% I could not be more excited about. And so if you're somebody who's trying to

[29:28] start a business, we help you facilitate a lot of this stuff in school automatically. And so automatically,

[29:34] if you. And so you can give it a shot. I've got a course. We do a bunch of calls in there. I put

[29:41] articles inside of the group there that are specific related to that business model. And you can start

[29:47] absolutely free. So if you want, you can give it a shot. School.com for such games. Everybody else

[29:52] keep crushing. And if you ever business, you want to sell. Good luck with your knock-on.

[29:55] See you later.

[00:00] This video is for every 17 year old 16 year old 18 year old 19 year old who's considering going to college or quitting college right now should I spend the next four years going to college.

[00:09] Hopefully I can equip the parents and the kids to make call with his little societal pressure as possible.

[00:14] When I lived in Austin, my next door neighbor was 18 years old. He always had this important decision as life where he was deciding whether he was going to go to college.

[00:21] He was always parents and it's kind of interesting because I sit halfway between his parents and him so I kind of have both sides.

[00:25] He decided to enroll at Pepperdine. After a semester, he didn't really like it and I think a lot of it was because it was just kind of expected that he'd go to college there.

[00:35] I had developed a rapport with him and he used to work out with me at my home gym after school and whatnot.

[00:40] And so I was like, hey man, let's go for a walk and I think we walked for about an hour and we just walked around the neighborhood and I'm pretty sure that that conversation significantly shifted the trajectory of his life.

[00:52] There we go.

[00:54] Alright, the reason most people to go to college is because that is what's expected. They don't think about the decision they just do it because it feels like the next national path.

[01:01] It's the same thing for having kids and getting married and buying a house, but let's not get into that.

[01:04] He went from going to Pepperdine to dropping out. His friends, his family, his friends, parents, so they're looking at him different.

[01:10] He was like the trouble tribe, he was like the odd owner about him.

[01:12] Two years later, he now has $250,000 saved up as a 20 year old.

[01:17] It makes $200,000 a year right now as a sales guy. What I want to do is break down the split in the road of two different lives that he could have lived or that you could live or that somebody that you know is facing the decision could go through.

[01:30] And I'll tell you how the conversation I had with him went.

[01:32] Some man, so I said listen, you're at a crossroads right now.

[01:35] We have crossroads every day in our lives. I was like, but some crossroads are bigger than others.

[01:38] And when you're trying to make a decision, you have to think how reversible is this decision.

[01:42] And how much long term impact is death.

[01:45] If I'm choosing between Chinese and Mexican for lunch, it's a split in the road.

[01:48] And it's really not going to affect much from me down the road.

[01:50] Choosing to go and commit four years of my life between 50 and $200,000 of money.

[01:55] And the lost income that I would have made during that period of time.

[01:58] Those are very big irreversible decisions.

[02:01] And they need to be treated with the same amount of respect.

[02:03] And a lot of people don't because they make that decision because their parents are signing them too,

[02:07] which seems like the overused one.

[02:08] But realistically because they don't want to be the kid who didn't wrong.

[02:11] Who didn't do what they were supposed to do and didn't do the next natural step.

[02:15] That's a terrible reason to go to college.

[02:16] I would like you to approach it with a decision making firm with them,

[02:19] so it starts with, and this is me telling him this.

[02:21] I was like, what problem are you solving? He's like, well, I want to make you.

[02:23] So the question is, four years from now, if you have a degree,

[02:26] and you've lost the money and you lost the earning potentially had during those four years,

[02:29] he's at that you, more able to generate income than an alternative view.

[02:33] Because what we have to analyze is not the cost of college,

[02:35] but the opportunity cost of going to college.

[02:38] The opportunity cost is the loss of potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen.

[02:43] So when we choose to go to college, there's an opportunity cost that exists,

[02:46] and it is the single greatest cost that people do not take into consideration.

[02:49] It's the cost of not doing of what you could have done in the meantime.

[02:53] One is it's going to cost you money because you actually got to spend money to do it.

[02:56] The second way of costing money is that you're not going to earn what you probably could earn full time working

[03:00] if that's what you wanted to do.

[03:01] You got two sides there.

[03:02] If you spent four years versus starting a business and then four years later,

[03:05] the opportunity cost is the business you could have started and what you would have for years later.

[03:08] So I'm walking with him and this is like a one-hour really in depth.

[03:11] Like this is probably deeper than he and I have been because I'm still this neighbor from across the street

[03:15] that makes money on the internet, right?

[03:16] But his parents like trusted me enough to be like, you know,

[03:18] I know that you have a lot of influence over our son and like we just want you to know that like,

[03:21] we know you do and so like, please be careful.

[03:24] And I was like, I'm aware he's in good hands.

[03:26] Don't be afraid for what I'm going to tell your son.

[03:28] I was like, listen, if you want to make money, then you need income generating skills.

[03:32] Do you think you're philosophy degree, your sociology degree, your psychology degree,

[03:36] your economics degree, even, which is still a little more useful.

[03:39] It's going to give you actual skills to make money.

[03:41] It was like, I don't know.

[03:43] And so I'm here to tell you what actually makes money.

[03:46] There's this lie that has been sold that you need to learn general education.

[03:50] I can tell you ancient Chinese literature has never impacted my ability to make money.

[03:55] Or as tech culture.

[03:56] Don't know anything about it.

[03:58] But it's classes and they somehow fool kids in the thinking that if they take this

[04:01] class, they're now somehow going to be more equipped to add about in the marketplace.

[04:04] If Alex were redoing the education system, the majors would be in accordance to

[04:08] the departments of a business.

[04:10] You'd have marketing and it would have the actual ways to market,

[04:13] which is creating the materials of marketing and how to distribute it.

[04:15] You'd have sales, how to get strangers to give you money, delivery portion,

[04:18] which would be either physical products delivery or services delivery,

[04:21] which would be customer experience, customer success, or it'd be technical,

[04:24] electrician, plumber, lawn mower, whatever it is.

[04:27] So then you have the actual technical component of the services delivery.

[04:29] And then you have the supporting services, which is like finance, HR, legal,

[04:33] those are the things that people should major in because those are the things that you're going to

[04:37] get hired to do.

[04:38] Google stopped requiring college degree, big tech corporations stopped it because they

[04:41] realized the two that it's not value additive.

[04:43] If I'm a doctor or lawyer, you need to agree.

[04:45] Sure, but for the 99% of people who don't fall in the six fucking careers that you

[04:49] have to have one, people are like Alex, who went to Vanderbilt.

[04:51] I graduated a year early, so I tried to get out as fast as I possibly could.

[04:54] One of the regrets that I have is that I could have started sooner.

[04:57] And the reason why I didn't drop out of college is because I was too too

[05:00] shit scared to disappoint my father.

[05:02] If you're going to do it eventually, it might as well do it now.

[05:05] When I see the guys who were starting a 18, I'm like, man, I wish I had started then

[05:08] rather than 23. I would have five more years.

[05:10] Zimming back out, I'm walking in the street, we're talking together.

[05:13] And I told him this line, I said, the world doesn't need another 3-1 business

[05:16] degree from Pepperdine.

[05:17] Another B student who graduates, because he didn't really give a shit, right?

[05:21] He would just do good enough that he would get through.

[05:23] And this is what he brought up, he's like, but what about like the social experience

[05:26] of college?

[05:27] I was like, so do you think that if you don't go to college, you're not going to be able

[05:30] to party with people who are your age?

[05:32] I was like, real talk.

[05:33] And he was like, well, like, kind of.

[05:36] If the problem to be solved is to socialize you, there are way more efficient ways to socialize

[05:40] you than spending $200,000 and not making income.

[05:43] You can work all day and then make my objective for this period of time to have fun, then

[05:48] fucking work all day and then literally go out every single night.

[05:51] And you'll end up debt free with savings and have a hell of a crazy four stories.

[05:55] And that's fine if that's what you want to do.

[05:57] And I was like, exactly what you want to do is like, no.

[05:59] And I think at some point in the conversation, she's like, I kind of want to do what you do.

[06:02] And I was like, well, then you got to learn the skills that I had to start.

[06:04] Fucking five years older than you to start learning, right?

[06:06] And the first thing was you had to learn how to sell.

[06:08] Let's just go down that path.

[06:09] If you're watching this, you're like, well, I don't like sales.

[06:11] I told you all the other departments that you could focus on, if you're like, you know what?

[06:14] I like being behind a camera.

[06:15] They cool.

[06:16] What do you think behind a camera means in a business?

[06:18] Behind a camera means you're making content, you're making commercials.

[06:20] Pick one.

[06:21] That's what video is useful, right?

[06:22] If you're like, I like writing words.

[06:23] What do you think writing words are useful in business?

[06:25] They're used to sell shit or delivers shit.

[06:27] That's it.

[06:28] Or legal to protect people from selling in delivery shit.

[06:30] I like dealing with people.

[06:31] It's like, well, it depends.

[06:32] Are you a little bit more aggressive?

[06:33] You might like sales.

[06:34] If you're a little bit more passive, ish, and I'm not saying it's a bad thing.

[06:36] You might like more of like the HR, or you might like recruiting.

[06:39] You might like selling people rather than selling products.

[06:41] Different ways of thinking about it.

[06:43] And so you can take your skills and then bucket them into which of these departments make more sense.

[06:47] And then that's what I'm going to focus on.

[06:49] Zoom it back out.

[06:50] So I said, now we need to look at your three one degree, $200,000 of debt, four years later,

[06:55] versus four years from now.

[06:57] You're going to have saved money this whole period of time.

[06:59] So he's living with four guys because I was like, dude, you're living cheap.

[07:02] That's how this works.

[07:03] So he saves a lot of money, which is why he is $250,000 saved up at 20.

[07:06] That's not from Alex doing anything.

[07:07] Like, he worked for it.

[07:08] He worked for it.

[07:09] And he saved every dollar that he made.

[07:10] And what do you think he's going to be able to do in four years?

[07:12] He's going to be able to start his own thing with a ton of capital and skills.

[07:15] As we're walking through these four years, what do we think happens now?

[07:18] And he's like, I really like sales.

[07:19] Now he happened to have like sales.

[07:21] The blessing that he got was he had a mentor, which obviously he was me.

[07:24] I could see his personality.

[07:25] I was like, dude, I think you do well here.

[07:27] And he did like he did well.

[07:28] But if he was that camera guy and he really liked more of that stuff,

[07:31] or if he was really techy out of like dude, go start coding.

[07:33] And so all of like, give this base skill.

[07:35] It's like, where do I want to apply it?

[07:36] If you're like, I don't know.

[07:37] You're never going to know because how would you know?

[07:39] You know by starting and then you'll gain context to make the decision later.

[07:43] All you know is the experiences you have.

[07:44] And so all you have to do is just always look around every so often.

[07:47] You're like, have I learned everything that I'm going to learn from this branch?

[07:50] And if you've learned everything you're going to learn, then at that point you can make the pivot.

[07:53] Right?

[07:54] But if you're like, dude, there's still a lot for me to learn.

[07:55] Do I want to learn that?

[07:56] Is it the direction I want to keep going?

[07:57] I remember when I did my first years of consulting.

[07:59] I looked down the road 25 years and I was like, I don't want that light.

[08:02] This is a hack that I will give you for very big decisions.

[08:04] Is that you want to keep thinking on it, keep chewing on it, keep digesting it

[08:08] into you can get into a single statement, which is for him.

[08:10] Four years from now, given the cost, which of these two paths will give me the most potential

[08:14] from my future and he was like, well, I think the other one.

[08:17] And I was like, then what are you going to do?

[08:19] So you decided to drop out and then go to the sales and he was terrified.

[08:22] In the beginning, he sucked itself because he had never done it before.

[08:26] Of course, he would suck.

[08:27] And of course, you will suck, too, because you haven't done it.

[08:29] But how do you think you get good?

[08:31] You start by sucking and then you suck less.

[08:33] That's how it works.

[08:34] Eventually, you look back after hundreds and hundreds and thousands of repetitions

[08:37] and you're like, oh, I'm actually pretty good at this.

[08:38] And it's reasonable that you get good because you've done it a thousand fucking times.

[08:41] What do you like sales is probably going to be the direction that he takes directionally in his life?

[08:44] He's like, what do I need to learn now?

[08:46] So he's like, okay, how do you move up?

[08:47] It's like, I can start a business.

[08:49] I was like, yeah, I was like, what skills are you going to need to start a business?

[08:51] I got to know how to market.

[08:52] I was like, well, you already learned how to cold call.

[08:54] Like, that's your first acquisition channels.

[08:55] We got that handle, which is why I put them there.

[08:57] So I go, okay, so I have that.

[08:58] So I can get customers.

[08:59] And I know how to sell.

[09:00] So I got that.

[09:01] I was like, what are you going to deliver?

[09:02] It's like, well, I really do like teaching sales.

[09:04] I was like, well, who the fuck have you taught sales to?

[09:11] Somebody else.

[09:12] What are the other skills he's going to have to learn?

[09:13] Well, he's going to have to learn how to finance it.

[09:14] So he's going to have to get contracts set up.

[09:16] So he can have services agreement, things like that.

[09:18] But again, these are all Googleable things that you can do.

[09:20] You can figure those things out a couple days.

[09:22] It's not a big deal.

[09:23] For the parents who are watching the kids who are watching this at home are trying

[09:25] to make the decision is, do you why think that four years from now with 50 to 200,000

[09:29] dollars in absolute costs and probably higher than that in opportunity cost of the cost of the path not taken?

[09:34] Which of these two paths will lead me closer to where I want to go?

[09:37] And if the goal is to make income, then you have to look at that 200,000

[09:40] dollars and all the things you could buy with that 200,000 dollars and four years of time

[09:45] and think is there another way that I could reverse engineer four years to get me to where I want to go?

[09:49] Or if you just really like the technical expertise that you have, you go super deep on the technical expertise

[09:54] and then you bolt on one additional skill.

[09:56] This is the one skill I will give you that you need to bolt on to instantly give yourself the lift and whatever career you have.

[10:00] You got to learn how to deal with people.

[10:01] You got to learn how to manage, you got to learn how to lead.

[10:03] You're like, that sounds like the soft stuff and it is, but it's also how you're going to get promoted.

[10:07] It's how you get respect, it's how you gain influence.

[10:09] And you also realize that the technical thing that you really get at is probably not the thing you're going to be doing in the business.

[10:13] You just got to know well enough to teach it to somebody else.

[10:15] His parents came to me after like I talked to him and they're like,

[10:18] Alex, can you please just tell me again on why he should be like telling him to quit college?

[10:22] I was like, I'm not telling him to quit college.

[10:23] I'm telling him to make the best decision for where he wants to be in four years.

[10:26] I'm not telling him not to get educated.

[10:27] I'm telling him to get super educated in the thing that he wants to do.

[10:31] The best people in the world or anything learn for themselves.

[10:34] They are self-talk.

[10:35] If you can adopt the mentality, then the world is your oyster.

[10:37] Because you realize that you can learn whatever you want whenever you want.

[10:39] You don't need a certification or permission to do that.

[10:42] Which of these paths for years from now,

[10:44] given the opportunity cost, is going to give me furthest towards Michael?

[10:47] There we go.

[10:49] All right, some, man.

[10:51] What's up?

[10:52] What's up?

[10:53] What's up?

[10:54] So I was responding to the conversation that they didn't think that you were real.

[10:57] So this is my YouTube audience to know that Jacob is indeed a real person.

[11:03] Can you confirm that you lived as my neighbor next to my house?

[11:07] I didn't think it was.

[11:09] And then we did work out every day after school.

[11:12] Yep.

[11:13] Yes.

[11:14] And how are you now?

[11:16] I am 20.

[11:17] Still can't drink it.

[11:19] Tough life.

[11:20] So you're in sales now.

[11:22] Right? What are you making right now?

[11:24] I probably had 250.

[11:25] 113 in the first six months of this.

[11:28] I'm already on track.

[11:30] Where do you have that?

[11:31] Nice to be king.

[11:32] And then how much money have saved up?

[11:34] Two ten.

[11:35] Two ten.

[11:36] Okay. So I thought it was 250.

[11:38] I got the 250 mixed up. So it's two ten.

[11:40] What would you say has been the biggest,

[11:42] I don't know, mental, my shift,

[11:44] change, et cetera, from our talks and our chats.

[11:48] I'm a good question.

[11:50] Well, you decided not to go to college, right?

[11:54] Is that the walk that they did?

[11:56] That's the walk that I closed it because my

[12:00] I did go really aggressive with that walk.

[12:02] So you had now that point been in school for a semester.

[12:05] What was the reason you decided to take that jump?

[12:08] I think the line that really hit when you said

[12:13] I'm paraphrasing it.

[12:14] It's totally acceptable to fail it on entrepreneurship

[12:17] because you're still in school.

[12:18] You're using it as a crutch.

[12:19] I think that that's what's like up.

[12:21] That's it.

[12:22] So I do need to go on.

[12:24] Yeah.

[12:25] So you were, because you were a dabbling on the side

[12:27] and you weren't succeeding at the odd birthing,

[12:29] which is what you really wanted to do.

[12:31] And you were using college as a social safety net

[12:34] to give yourself an excuse for why you weren't winning.

[12:36] Exactly.

[12:37] And so then you decided to go on with it.

[12:39] Everyone all in, let me do it.

[12:42] All right, say hi to Moses.

[12:44] I'm in the closet.

[12:45] You're in the closet.

[12:46] Say hi to Moses Nation.

[12:48] What's up?

[12:49] So that is to confirm that Jacob is indeed a real person

[12:52] with a real pulse and a real story

[12:54] and if it worked for him it could work for you.

[12:56] Thanks for that appreciate you.

[12:58] Go back to sales calls.

[12:59] I have a call over here.

[13:01] Jacob was lucky as hell that he just happened

[13:04] to have been my neighbor.

[13:05] So I take.

[13:06] I could just tell that he was incredibly hungry.

[13:09] I knew that he had this really deep desire to prove himself.

[13:12] When I see something like that, I'm like, cool.

[13:15] Like, and the way I tested that I was like,

[13:17] shut up after school every day.

[13:18] We'll work out.

[13:19] And I wanted to see if he would show up.

[13:21] And like clockwork, no matter what,

[13:23] every day he would text me.

[13:24] It wasn't like me having to text him or remind him.

[13:26] I knew that he had that desire and he would take as much as I was going to give.

[13:29] If this video caused you to question a couple of things

[13:31] or maybe even brought up more questions than it did answers

[13:33] because it opened up your mind of some things.

[13:35] What I'd recommend doing is watching this video.

[13:37] My video about how to analyze opportunities.

[13:39] And so if you're looking at, okay, maybe I don't do college

[13:42] but what path do I go on?

[13:43] That will give you the framework to make the decision

[13:45] on how you analyze opportunities in your life

[13:47] and a business that you might potentially start at set up.

[13:49] I'll be enjoying.

[13:50] They're like, when are you going to start?

[13:51] Like, hermosie university and like,

[13:52] training these guys on the skills and maybe someday.

[00:00] In this video, I'm going to tell you a story about how I solved to turn for the entire

[00:04] gym industry and I think there are a lot of things you can take from this, both in the

[00:08] actual outcome itself, but also the process that was used to achieve it.

[00:14] One of the things I'm going to read one in the time clock here, so if there's you don't

[00:17] know, I had a chain of gyms in California, I founded 2013, I had six gyms by 2016, that

[00:25] I grew just using cash flow from the growth of the facilities.

[00:29] So I was very good at the marketing and selling process of getting people in the gyms

[00:33] and opening them at full capacity, which was kind of my claim to fame.

[00:37] Over time, I then pivoted to licensing that acquisition system to other gym owners across

[00:42] the US.

[00:43] That was kind of the path and then the gym owner took off from there.

[00:46] There was a two-year step in between there where I did turn around and I'd fill other people's

[00:50] gyms up for a percentage of the revenue that I was bringing in.

[00:54] That was kind of the long story short.

[00:56] Fast forward, and now we've got thousands of gyms, right?

[01:00] This is still a few years ago, but fast forward in the story.

[01:02] It's got a few thousand gyms at this time.

[01:04] One of the issues is that all these guys are bringing in people in the door, but they can't

[01:08] retain them for a long time, so they can convert them into members because we had a process

[01:12] around that, which again was sales, but they couldn't keep them for a long time, right?

[01:17] And this wasn't because of the acquisition system, they just couldn't keep any of the customers

[01:21] for a long time.

[01:22] And so what's interesting about this is that this is for any type of service based business

[01:26] that has any kind of recurring revenue model whatsoever.

[01:30] And so here's what I did to solve a problem that I did not know the answer to.

[01:33] So this is the takeaway that you can take from this.

[01:36] So what I did was I said, hey guys, has anyone in this huge community achieved 3% monthly

[01:43] turn or less for six straight months?

[01:47] So 3% monthly turn if you do the math on it, let's actually look together shall we?

[01:51] So if we want to see how much what percentage of your customers are staying, and if you

[01:56] have let's say 3% monthly turn, so that's 0.97, right?

[02:01] And let's say that this is for 12 months, all right?

[02:03] So we're going to go X to the Y for 12 months.

[02:07] That means that I'm going to keep 69% of my customers.

[02:11] I'm going to lose 31% of my customers year every year if I have 3% monthly turn.

[02:14] That's still a decent amount of customers that are losing, right?

[02:17] Just being real with you.

[02:18] Now 3% is like a top 1% of J, I'll be wrong with you.

[02:21] Like most Jims do not do that.

[02:23] The industry average is about 9%.

[02:25] Now if you want to have something that freaks you out, let's just do this one together.

[02:28] So 9% means we're retaining 91% per month.

[02:32] Now we're going to do our little twisty twistiness so that we can do our fancy math.

[02:35] We go X to the Y and we'll do 12 months again, right?

[02:38] Right.

[02:40] Look at the difference there.

[02:43] 42% of your clients are still there.

[02:46] Meaning you lose 68% of your recurring clients if your monthly turn is 9%.

[02:55] This is why people don't want to buy these types of businesses.

[02:57] This is what makes your business unselable.

[02:59] And so I had this problem, right?

[03:02] I was like all these Jims are acquiring customers and their industry average is that they're

[03:06] going to lose 3 quarters of their customers by the end of the year.

[03:09] Right?

[03:10] Right?

[03:11] So I said, okay, so if you think about this math wise, right?

[03:13] I've already got the top 1% and I've got the top 1% and I've got the top 1% and I've

[03:17] got the top 1% and I've got the top 1% and I've got the top 1% and I've got the top 1%

[03:21] and I've got the top 1% and the top 1% and the top 1% and the top 1% and the top 1% and the top 1%

[03:37] and I said, okay, so if you think about this math wise, right?

[03:38] I've already got the top 1% and I guess this is the top 2% but top 2% of the entire gym world

[03:45] and so I had them all together on a call and I said, I need you to tell me every single

[03:50] thing that you do to provide excellent value or a customer surplus to your members.

[03:58] And so I went person by person by person and I was sitting there and I was like, and

[04:02] then what do you do?

[04:03] And then how does that work?

[04:04] And then why do you do that?

[04:06] And I wrote down every single thing that every one of them had and so by the end of

[04:09] this I had like four pages of notes, right?

[04:11] So this is what I did next.

[04:12] So we ended the call and so I looked through all the notes and then I recadigized them

[04:16] because a lot of them were repetitive.

[04:17] Some of them were different, you know, one-off weird things.

[04:21] And so I said, okay, it's clear that all of them do lots of things and the first one being

[04:25] they actually track it and focus on the metric which 95% of people don't even do, which

[04:30] is why most people are poor.

[04:33] Second thing that all of them did is that they had lots of different strategies to combat

[04:38] churn because they know that and you guys want to know something crazy?

[04:42] Of course you do.

[04:42] We're watching the world's coolest YouTuber.

[04:45] All right.

[04:45] So if you, let's say you have a service that's $100 a month, okay?

[04:52] $100 a month.

[04:53] And let's say that your churn is 3%.

[04:56] Right?

[04:57] Because that was the goal of these people, right?

[05:00] So 3% churn, all right?

[05:01] And so what I did was they did 100 divided by 3%.

[05:07] That's $3300 of LCV, right?

[05:10] Lifetime value, right?

[05:11] Lifetime amount of revenue they're going to be able to collect over this customer.

[05:14] If they pay $100 a month, they're going to get 33 months at this person because it's

[05:17] 100 divided by 0.03.

[05:20] Watch this.

[05:21] Same $100 price point.

[05:22] When price at the industry average is 9 divided by 0.09.

[05:28] 11.11.

[05:30] 1100 bucks is with the LTV of those gyms are.

[05:33] So the people who had conquered their churn made 3 times more revenue per customer than

[05:39] everyone else.

[05:41] But here's what's even crazy about that.

[05:42] If you make 3 times more revenue per customer, think about how much more profit you're

[05:47] making.

[05:48] A lot more.

[05:49] All right.

[05:50] And this is why this was such an important thing.

[05:51] So a lot of them were doing lots of things.

[05:54] I consolidated all of the things into buckets.

[05:56] And then I said, what are the things that every single one of them is doing?

[05:59] And you can think about this like a voting system.

[06:02] If all of them are doing one thing, the next probably an important thing.

[06:07] If I've got 20 guys and there's something that only one of them is doing, it's probably

[06:11] not important because the other 19 are accomplishing the objective without doing it.

[06:14] And so the goal is how little, how few of these things are the things that are actually

[06:18] driving the outcome.

[06:21] And so what I ended up figuring out after doing this entire process is that there were five

[06:26] things that they were all doing to maintaining their members.

[06:30] Now, you can either say, oh, OK, Alex, well, the next five things that he's going to

[06:34] share are probably only for gyms.

[06:37] Yeah, because humans are totally different in your business.

[06:40] But anyways, so let's rock and roll.

[06:43] First thing that they were all doing, all of them, is that if someone missed and they're

[06:50] not showing up at the gym by Wednesday of that week, so they missed one day and missed

[06:54] Tuesday.

[06:55] They escalated them and they had all of them at different processes around the

[06:59] some of them did it by Friday, some of them did it by Tuesday.

[07:02] But the end point was, if someone was not consuming the service, they immediately escalated

[07:08] it and would have repeatedly tried and contact them to get them scheduled four time to

[07:12] come in, which means they had accountability around consumption.

[07:15] Number one, number two, the vast majority of them had exit interviews, meaning if someone

[07:20] wanted to leave, they would have to come in and talk to somebody.

[07:24] There's two benefits of this.

[07:25] One is you get to identify the things that are wrong with your business because these

[07:28] people will tell you why they're leaving.

[07:30] This gives you the opportunity to fix things that are not good, which is incredibly viable

[07:35] data, right?

[07:36] Number one, number two is a lot of times people need to vent and the things that they're

[07:40] venting about, it sounds like pain, means it can be soft, which means a lot of times

[07:44] over half of those people get resold into a higher level pack, just like no one ever

[07:48] contact me, it's like, well, you're not in the contact me plan, you're in the, you know,

[07:52] do it yourself plan, you should get into the coaching level where we actually hold you

[07:55] accountable.

[07:56] Oh, I didn't know you guys had that.

[07:57] Yeah, we just didn't know that you needed that.

[07:59] Ah, that's our fault.

[08:00] We should have asked you better questions on the front end, right?

[08:03] Right, cool.

[08:04] And then all of a sudden, this person goes from being a loss and a cancel to being an

[08:09] ascension.

[08:10] So number one, they make sure people are consuming.

[08:14] Number two, they save exit interviews so they can get collect data and ascending

[08:18] existing customers.

[08:20] Number three, they all did member events.

[08:24] All right, so they had some sort of community component that happened on a regular basis.

[08:28] The extent to which they had it was different.

[08:31] The cadence was different.

[08:32] But I'll tell you right now that if you do it on a quarterly basis, that usually works,

[08:36] you know, for in terms of bringing the community together, usually in good hands.

[08:40] Number four is that they had hand-written cards that they would send out on a regular basis

[08:47] to each of the people in their community.

[08:51] And some of them would send it out with gift cards to bring friends, which is a great

[08:55] way to generate referrals as well.

[08:57] Some of them would just have it as appreciation.

[09:00] Some of them would give them some sort of kudos or whatever.

[09:03] And here's the key point about how these cards had to be written.

[09:05] They had to be personalized.

[09:07] All right, so can't just be, hey, thanks for being a member.

[09:11] Love you lots, send.

[09:13] It doesn't work.

[09:15] It has to be, hey, Charlotte, you've really been advancing on your pull-ups.

[09:20] And if you're like, well, this only works for gyms.

[09:22] I'm not even going to comment on that.

[09:24] Use your brain.

[09:25] Can you personalize something to any kind of improvement that someone has had in your business?

[09:30] Probably, hopefully.

[09:31] But it's like, hey, Charlotte, you've made a lot of progress in your pull-ups.

[09:34] When you got here, you had to use the big thick black band.

[09:36] And now you're using the yellow band, which is, you know, twice as hard in terms of the

[09:42] versus level for you.

[09:44] Keep it up.

[09:45] You're doing a great job and you're already down 10 pounds.

[09:48] So they're also reminding them of the victories that are happening, right, on a recurring

[09:51] basis.

[09:52] And the fifth one, I honestly cannot remember what the fifth one was.

[09:55] But the point of this story is the process of solving the problem, right?

[10:00] That was the point.

[10:01] All right, the process of solving the problem and then you can use this for any type of complex

[10:07] problem that you have.

[10:08] And so the way that this is done, this is called a consultative method.

[10:11] But you go and you talk to experts in the space.

[10:13] So if you sit on top of the community, all of the solutions to all of the problems that you

[10:18] have already exist in that community, someone has solved it.

[10:22] And so all you have to do is get all the smartest people in one room and then interview

[10:26] them, tabulate the answers, use a weighing system of which of these answers comes up

[10:31] most frequently.

[10:32] And then consolidate to what are the fewest number of these things that everyone is doing

[10:37] to solve this complex problem.

[10:39] And a lot of times when you use that type of process and that type of thinking, you will

[10:43] be able to solve the more complicated issues that come up in business.

[10:46] And a lot of times the payouts can be rich and very rewarding.

[10:50] All right, oh, remember the fifth thing.

[10:52] Every two weeks, they were able to contact them on a personal basis, independent of the service

[10:57] based stuff.

[10:58] So it's just checking in on them as humans, every other week or so.

[11:01] So it's like, hey, imagine your phone buzzes with a text every 14 days, every 21 days

[11:07] or so.

[11:09] And it says, hey, just checking in, how's life, how's things, how you doing, just making

[11:14] sure everything's great.

[11:16] And just want to help you accomplish your goals whatever.

[11:19] And so you get that text from your service provider.

[11:23] You're like, wow, it almost appears as though they care.

[11:27] Isn't that wild?

[11:29] Of course it is.

[11:30] And that is why people pay you to pay attention.

[11:32] That is what they are literally paying for.

[11:34] All right, people want your attention.

[11:36] And so do not automate what you should systematize.

[11:40] It's one of the things I have when it comes to service.

[11:42] As soon as someone finds out that communications are automated, they stop paying attention

[11:46] because you stop paying attention to the communication.

[11:49] That's a little, a little nugget, a little tidbit for you as well is that do not automate what

[11:53] you should systematize.

[11:55] Okay, you can have a system around something, just do not automate it because as soon as

[11:58] you're in touch, it's going, people stop caring about it altogether.

[12:01] And it actually withdraws goodwill from the goodwill making out of your customers rather

[12:05] than depositing.

[12:06] It's better to say nothing at all than to automate things for the most part.

[12:09] Many times I have found when it comes to customer success and getting people to believe

[12:13] that you give a shit, which is kind of the point of most services.

[12:16] Okay.

[12:17] So, the best way as a total side note of getting people to think you give a shit,

[12:24] is to actually give a shit.

[12:25] So with that, I will leave you most ination keeping awesome.

[12:28] If you're new to most ination, welcome.

[12:29] We love you.

[12:30] We appreciate you keeping awesome.

[12:32] We make these videos because there's a lot of people not want to be one of them.

[12:35] And why didn't say this at the beginning?

[12:36] Because I always forget, my name is Alex Shmozi.

[12:38] I own acquisition.com.

[12:39] And about $8,000 a year.

[12:41] Keep being awesome.

[12:42] See you next video.

[12:43] Bye!

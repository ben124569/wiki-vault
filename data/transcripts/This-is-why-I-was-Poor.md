[00:00] What's going on everyone? Alex was here. See of Jimi Lusk's pasties labs and

[00:04] Allen and a number of other profolio companies that we have we did 120 plus million

[00:08] So what I'm going to do is show you some of the lessons that we have learned along the way so

[00:13] Volatility and risk so I had a conversation with somebody on my team and it was such a good conversation

[00:19] I wish I had recorded it and so this is going to be my attempt to break this down for you

[00:24] So this is if you are an entrepreneur and you have a sales team you can send this to your sales team

[00:29] If you are kind of still in the selling mode, this will apply to you and if you're an employee and you're looking at making more money

[00:35] And you want to become wealthy this will also apply to you too. All right

[00:39] So the employee question came to me. He requested like a 15 minute time which I knew something important because that doesn't happen very often

[00:44] And so I was I was kind of looking for it. I was like hey, what's up man?

[00:47] And what was interesting in the first you know four to five minutes of the call

[00:51] You know the person was just like I just really want to pick your brain on like the direction of my life and I was like

[00:56] Well, that's a really big amorphous topic like

[00:58] What problem are we solving right which is always if you ever talk to me

[01:01] It's usually like what problem we solving right because then we can start tackling it

[01:04] And I don't think they knew what the problem that they were solving was because what it was is in reality

[01:08] They had family members who were saying hey you you shouldn't you shouldn't be in this job

[01:12] You need something that's more secure, right?

[01:14] And so as I dug deeper into this conversation

[01:18] There were so many nuggets that came out of it that I think I've wrote them all down on a list that I'm gonna try and hit as many as I can

[01:23] All right, and so the first thing was

[01:26] This person in particular is on our sales and we've allowed us at you know 20 plus sales people and

[01:31] They they

[01:33] Their family said you should get out of sales

[01:36] You need something that is less risky, all right, and so the first thing I asked was

[01:42] Do these people who are giving you this advice make more money than you and you said no?

[01:46] Now it's like real number one

[01:47] Do not listen to people poorer than you about advice on money

[01:51] So for everyone who has family or friends or parents who make less money than you or make the same amount of money

[01:57] The new at an at an older age

[02:00] Don't listen to them all right, listen to people who make far far far far more money

[02:02] I don't even think you should listen to millionaires listen to billionaires. I think that's great advice from Grand Cardone listen to billionaires

[02:07] So number one number two

[02:11] They had a must understanding a volatility and risk all right. This is a classic poor person thing

[02:16] All right, so I'm gonna break this down for you

[02:21] With an example let's say I own an insurance company, okay?

[02:26] And I know statistically that every nine years there's going to be a super catastrophe

[02:32] There's gonna be a hurricane which Katrina hurricane Maria something that's gonna destroy everything and I'm gonna lose a

[02:36] But load okay now

[02:39] That means that one out of nine years I'm gonna get destroyed

[02:42] But the other eight years I'm probably gonna make a lot of money, right?

[02:46] Right so the question is is my insurance business risky?

[02:51] The answer is no and I'm gonna make the assumptions that I have a sound business model and I've margins and all that stuff

[02:56] But the route is that my insurance business is not risky

[03:00] It is volatile those are not the same things

[03:04] All right, and so if you if you flatten out the curve over the nine years and look at the growth

[03:09] It's going to occur in my business based on those metrics

[03:12] I will be far better off than something that might be less volatile less up and down

[03:17] But not grow as quickly, all right sales and is an example of a highly volatile

[03:23] Profession that still is low risk and let me explain why

[03:28] Who do you think is the most secure in the company?

[03:31] Somebody who generates revenue or someone who costs overhead

[03:34] Someone who generates revenue so sales people are by definition people who generate revenue

[03:39] Which means they are the lowest risk in a company now for them

[03:44] They may have more volatility from paycheck to paycheck, but in general

[03:48] People in sales generate make more money than people who are not in sales, all right?

[03:52] And if you're good at sales even more so which this individual is right and so with the concept of volatility versus risk

[04:00] I said what you should do if you want to decrease the volatile near in your life and get the upside

[04:06] Benefit of your position is you need to decrease

[04:09] Your expenses to your salary all right, so his salary and I said now your salary is what you need to assume your is all you're going to make

[04:16] Now I'm not saying live on your salary. I'm saying

[04:19] You should be saving off of your salary now think about this. Let's say this individual is living as it has a salary

[04:25] If let's say $40,000 a year all right

[04:28] Now if I can get them to live on 25k right a year

[04:33] Then that delta can be invested in the S&P 500 and

[04:37] Within 20 years their top one percent

[04:40] Crazy I know and if you split where you live with other people and you really try and live down

[04:45] You can do that faster, right?

[04:47] But the ground is that this isn't all the person's gonna make but you should plan like it is because then what happens is all of this

[04:54] becomes gravy and even if you have a bad month which

[04:57] There's no salesperson in our company that would not that would not make any sales

[05:01] It doesn't even make sense, right?

[05:03] But even if you had a bad month they still this person would still feel like they're making progress towards their wealth

[05:08] Freedom and independence goals, all right?

[05:10] But the reality is that they would probably make you know another hundred k per year on top of that

[05:16] But now they've set up their lifestyle such that their expense they can raise you is so favorable

[05:22] That that they can save so much of their money and they get to their goal faster which is

[05:27] The next point

[05:28] Which is

[05:30] wealth and I've said this before and I will say it again is not a number and this is one of the things that I did I did tease out in this conversation

[05:36] wealth is a ratio

[05:38] It's a ratio between how much you spend versus how much you make it's inflow versus outflow

[05:43] not I need to make x to be free now if you want to have a crazy lifestyle

[05:47] I have another video about about what living like the ultra-walthy is but the reality is it's a not that fun

[05:54] Not definitely not fulfilling and I'll tell you what is way more fulfilling having the freedom and the peace of mind

[05:59] Which is actually what people want knowing that you're gonna be set up for life and the way to do that is to have a strong

[06:04] income to expense ratio and so this individual if he's making a 140,000 and he lives on 25

[06:11] He's making nine times more or whatever the math is there whatever six times six times more you may get six times more

[06:17] Then he's spending that's a great income to expense ratio his wealth is going to build very very quickly

[06:22] Right and with that that extra money will more than cover his 25,000 was a year

[06:27] Right like the 140 that he or sorry the one one 15 that he's saving in this example right every year in pure cash

[06:35] He's already saving four and a half years of income every year now let alone the fact that if he's just gaining at 10%

[06:41] Right S&P's nine but like just for math sake let's just say 10 that he's he's going to be generating self

[06:48] compounding growth with which means that in two years two years will be at 230 right

[06:55] He would technically be able to retire on his current income think about that right now if you want to if you want to spend more

[07:02] Then fine, but later there's a 24 month wave of saving your way to wealth right now

[07:07] What I want to retire in 230,000? No, but if you work for a decade by the end of that period of time

[07:12] You'd have to you know 2.1 something right and at that point

[07:16] Then he can he can totally just retire and not only that if he keeps his expense ratio at 25,000

[07:22] Maybe even bumps himself to 40 or 50,000 which for most people is is a really comfortable living

[07:28] You know as long as you're not doing anything crazy right and if you do it that way

[07:32] Life will be better now the next point that that that came up was used like okay

[07:37] Well, I've got I've got some debt so what should I do he's like so I've got student loan debt

[07:41] I've got credit card debt that's that's about

[07:45] I can't remember I think it was 20 grand right between both of those and I was like okay

[07:48] You student loans have super super super low interest

[07:52] So let's not worry about those let's worry about your credit card because the credit card has 16% compounding and so you think about that

[07:58] It's like a negative investment right you've got something that's compounding against you versus something that's compounding for you

[08:03] So the way to guarantee a 16% compounding rate of return is to deep is to take away the drags that are at negative 16%

[08:11] All right, so if you're in this situation the first thing you do is you pay off your credit card debt

[08:15] All right

[08:16] Number one after that you're gonna have your your student loans and then your investments the reality is

[08:22] The student loans the interest because the head with the government setting them you know have set them up

[08:26] It's it's basically just it's the cost of you learning this however long ago. I think it's horribly

[08:33] Unethical that they they do student loans. I think I'm so wildly against student loans in general

[08:38] In what world would someone ever give an 18 year old access to 200 thousand dollars

[08:42] Who has no skills whatsoever to then get something that has no return more than what their current earning potential is it makes no sense and

[08:49] If you if you if you can't even bankrupt your way out of it

[08:51] It is purely a scheme by banks to make more money purely it makes you a slave to the bank for the rest of your life

[08:57] But there's no interest on it and so I'm not gonna think about that for right now all right, so credit card loans first and then

[09:03] You stack into investments now me personally

[09:06] I just don't like having any debt and so if you want to it's a personal choice and they even make mathematical sense

[09:10] It makes emotional sense

[09:11] You can pay off the student loans and then everything else gets plowed into the S.P. 500 the reason I say that is because

[09:17] Warren Buffett the

[09:19] The advice that he's given the people who are managing his will is that he just wants everything put in the S.P. 500

[09:25] Summon us investor of all time that's what he's doing

[09:27] So I think it is worthwhile advice and very easy to follow all right

[09:31] Next one and you do this every month. It's called dollar cost averaging so that even when it goes down and goes up

[09:35] You're gonna participate at all time so when it's overpriced

[09:38] You're still buying and when it's underpriced you're still buying don't try and time it

[09:42] I have another video about trying to time the market you're gonna lose so just dollar cost average in and then get rid of any of the anxiety around getting a good deal

[09:50] All right

[09:51] Next one so he's like okay, I want to make

[09:54] You know I want to know how I can grow all right

[09:57] So

[09:58] This is for anyone who's in any company the close you can tire yourself to an acquisition channel the more value bar to the company because you're

[10:05] You're driving revenue right and so what I what I explained to him was I said listen

[10:10] You've gone through all my trainings. You know you know you know the different ways of getting clients

[10:14] Pick a channel that we're not currently using and in your in your off time trying to figure that channel out

[10:21] And we pay more for for leads for sales that come that don't that that someone goes and brings out brings in on their own compared to stuff that comes in for

[10:28] Marketing right I was like so you're gonna get disproportionately paid for those off the bat and then as soon as you figure out that system

[10:34] I said come to me and say hey Alex I figured out the system I figured this process is getting us more clients

[10:40] I want to build a team and I think that I can show five other guys how to do this and

[10:45] Generate revenue and I just would like a piece of all of there of their of their sales and I would say absolutely and so if he does this

[10:53] He'd be able to two or three X's income as a result of that right and so that is a way

[10:58] Figuring out how to provide more value now the next thing was

[11:03] A beat I think this came up from the family too was going off on your own right now

[11:07] Obviously as the owner of the business you would think that my incentive is to keep it keep everyone and

[11:13] Over time my my incentive is shifted my incentive is I want to

[11:18] To be the best human I possibly can be and if that means that that this it's time for that person to go and

[11:24] Spread their wings then that's fine and I encourage them and I wish them the absolute best

[11:28] And I mean that genuinely because I never want to be the person you hold someone back from accomplishing their dreams

[11:32] That being said understanding risk is important so

[11:37] many many people

[11:39] Many many many of my salespeople make more than many entrepreneurs do in fact

[11:44] Probably up the stats. I think the average small business. It makes like 78 thousand dollars a year

[11:48] So if my salespeople make 150 or 200 thousand dollars a year and if he does all this thing

[11:53] He could make five times with the average small business under mix five times

[11:57] Five times and that's income right that's what's important and so

[12:02] Sometimes you can see the lure and this is a classic employee mistake is

[12:06] You look at all the revenue and you say oh that must be the owners that must be Alex's

[12:11] And every business owner who's watching this is laughing themselves because they know that is so far from the truth it is is hilarious

[12:17] But but people still make that logical fallacy and so

[12:22] For perspective if you if you are a 200 thousand or a year salesperson

[12:26] You own in my mind a million dollar business because if you're running a 20% net margin after everything

[12:31] That and the thing is is not just profit in the business

[12:34] But it's net free cash flows the amount of money that you as an owner can take out after reinvesting in the business

[12:37] Right and so if you have a you if you're a salesperson and you're making 200 thousand here

[12:43] It's the same as you owning a million dollar business and so many times and in this instance depending on your skill set

[12:48] You may not want to do with HR and finance and and figuring out fulfillment and

[12:52] Generating leaves on your own all the other aspects that come with owning a business legal and all the other crap right

[12:58] And so I'm not saying don't be an entrepreneur obviously when entrepreneur but I'm saying

[13:02] Understand adequately understand the risk and I think that if I adequately understand the risk and I'm being very very honest with everyone here

[13:08] I don't know if I would have become an entrepreneur I really don't know because

[13:12] I'm pretty risk-averse believe it or not and I think I've told you I had a really good paying job before I

[13:17] Before I quit and it was because I was so miserable that I decided to do something else

[13:21] But I did not have the table on entrepreneur story of like I was always bad at school

[13:26] And I knew I had to do my like I didn't have that at all. I was good at school

[13:28] I got a good job and I just I was miserable so I did something else anyways next point

[13:34] Oh last one okay, so I'll give you another saying to work off of track

[13:42] Don't slack

[13:44] All right easy to remember and so one of the easiest things that you can do to increase your net worth is

[13:51] Start by tracking it all right. This is one of the easiest things so right now every week

[13:55] I get a I get an email that has every single one of my assets every single one of my bank accounts

[14:00] All of my portfolio and it has one number at the bottom and so I know every week how I'm doing and whether I'm going up and up

[14:07] Now you might be like well, man isn't the market volatile sure

[14:10] But I also have other investments too, etc

[14:13] But the point is

[14:15] Especially the earlier on you are you can you can decrease that cycle now you can do that every quarter

[14:20] I'm just I tend to be obsessive about it and I like looking at it because I like making progress

[14:25] If right now you are the sole provider in your household or your solo business owner or an entrepreneur or even you know

[14:30] You have a seven or any figure business, right?

[14:32] But you haven't like your your actual net worth hasn't surpassed

[14:35] You know a million five million

[14:38] tracking every day

[14:40] The cumulative amount of your bank accounts is one of the single greatest things that I ever did

[14:46] Ever like ever ever ever ever and so

[14:51] It became this habit that first thing the morning I would open up my my chase app

[14:55] I would and the nice things if you have one of the big commercial banks you can you can

[14:59] They give you dashboards you can you can pull all your accounts in together

[15:01] So if you have you know two business accounts and then you have a savings and a checking personal and then you maybe have like a poor fault

[15:06] All of that stuff you can have in one place so it's actually pretty cool

[15:09] Anyways, I didn't excite sheet that had all my assets on them all my bank accounts all my investments and everything and I would take five minutes in the morning and I would update it

[15:18] And every single and I did it daily so I saw every single day and I could just scroll over time and watch my bottom number

[15:24] Continue to go up and here's what's magical about this

[15:27] Is that when you look at your bank accounts every day you start to get a pulse on the flow of money

[15:32] You start to get a feeling for oh, yeah

[15:34] Two days is when this goes out. Oh, yeah on the first the week of the month. This is when this goes out

[15:38] But then what happens is all of a sudden you're like hey, I went down by 200 bucks

[15:42] Let me examine let me investigate and you look in there and you're like holy crap

[15:47] I've been using this software for however long cancel right and so as soon as you start doing this you'll start decreasing

[15:53] You'll plug the holes you'll decrease the

[15:56] The outflows of money in your life because you're tracking and not slacking

[16:01] So as long as you're not a slacker become a tracker track your net worth right and so for this individual

[16:07] The action plan that I made for him so that he could create the wealth that he wanted was this kind of recap for you all right

[16:14] Number one track don't slack you have to track your net worth if you wanted to improve

[16:18] So how can you even track like how can you personally even know what it is track

[16:22] Track track don't slack now your debt should also be on there

[16:24] So if he's paying down debt his net worth will go up because right now

[16:27] He's got $20,000 net so his net worth is negative $20,000 compared to his cash

[16:31] Right, so boom track don't slack next pay off high interest credit cards or high interest loan debt first

[16:39] Next dollar cost average all of the money that you that you make an access of your

[16:44] Expenses into the S&P mind you. This is not investment advice. I'll probably post a legal disclaimer under the video

[16:50] Do whatever the hell you want

[16:52] Investment has risks. There's no guaranteed returns life is risky, you know, no one comes out alive. Okay

[16:57] Back to the main point. So dollar cost average of the S&P and

[17:01] Actively decrease your expenses as much as you can possibly possible if you have a salary with variable compensation on top of it

[17:07] Try and save off of living off your salary and if that sounds crazy cool

[17:12] Don't be ordinary be extraordinary do things different because the average person

[17:17] Literally retires with nothing don't be like that you can be different and the thing is is all of these things that we aspire for

[17:24] Which I made this other video about

[17:26] Right all these things we aspire for private jets exotic cars penthouses

[17:30] Expensive clothing fancy restaurants. I can tell you firsthand

[17:33] They're not with their cracked up to be I like I like B. J's and Chilly's more than I like Ruth Chris

[17:39] I really like the cheap my cheap jorts more than any of the fancy pants that are out of fancy pants

[17:44] I can tell you that when I lived in a $1200 a month apartment in an

[17:49] Albuquerque, New Mexico, which is a really nice place

[17:52] I was happy as can be it I'm my happiness is in no way change having the place that I have now

[17:56] I regret the exotic car that I have and private jets are wildly expensive and you can you can get anywhere you want on

[18:03] Spirit for way less all right

[18:05] So decrease your expenses all right and

[18:09] In terms of increase in the income tie yourself to an acquisition channel

[18:13] Try and find a new way of acquiring customers of the business that you're currently in is not doing

[18:17] Do that and then build a team underneath of you that can do the thing that you just learned how to do

[18:23] All right because then you will be closer to what I call a rainmaker and rainmakers are always paid the most in every business and

[18:30] Understand that when you do that if you even getting to 200,000 was here you own a million dollar business

[18:35] It's the same thing right except you have way less risk

[18:39] Because if you want a million dollar business

[18:41] You can work your ass off two months in a row and become poorer

[18:45] Whereas if you work your ass off for two months in a row and a business you're gonna get richer

[18:49] All right, and that's the differences between big and entrepreneur and employees that a lot of people don't adequately

[18:54] Monitor the risk all right and finally

[18:57] Understand the distance volatility and risk overall something that goes up and down a lot is not necessarily risky

[19:03] It's just volatile and if you can understand that words matter and how you describe things matter and understanding the definition of words

[19:11] You can put better concepts in frameworks around your thought process and make better quality decisions

[19:17] So anyways, I hope you found this valuable

[19:19] This was a great conversation. I wish I had recorded it

[19:22] But hopefully you got the nuggets from that you can apply to your own life in business

[19:26] Keeping awesome leave a comment and I'll catch you guys in the next fit. Bye

## Full Transcript
[00:00] So July 16th, 2025, we are 30ish days out almost to the day.

[00:06] To the August 16th, live launch.

[00:09] I wrote the book because I hadn't heard anyone talk or write anything

[00:14] about it at all.

[00:15] And I saw it as one of the most important things

[00:17] that you can put in a business.

[00:20] I am knee deep in just a bunch of different facets of the launch.

[00:26] So it's funny because it's, you know, it's a few hours

[00:28] every day.

[00:29] It's like multiple years of preparation that we're doing.

[00:33] We're on the way to the airport.

[00:36] Go meet Alex and my left four a.

[00:39] Light is content in the plane to be as better.

[00:44] So I just grabbed basically every hook that's from the working

[00:48] for the existing winners, plus a bunch of the organic ones that did well.

[00:54] Yeah.

[00:55] So again, I'm going to judge Scott Connor.

[00:57] They turn it off and they turn it off.

[00:59] Oh, I thought it was that worth it.

[01:02] They're easy being easy.

[01:04] So you're good just witnessing ads.

[01:08] Oh, I'm going to be clipboard guy.

[01:12] While they're underrated.

[01:14] Everybody's like, let's go to AI.

[01:16] I'm like, let's print shit out and put it on a fucking clipboard.

[01:20] You can write on it, you can hold it, you can pass it to someone.

[01:23] You can keep a couple sheets in there.

[01:26] You guys might want to wait to do ads until you take off.

[01:30] Well, it's fun.

[01:31] Yeah, Layla's been a sport being not bothered by me just doing ads and doing this

[01:36] BDS while she's in silence.

[01:41] What do you think about the launch?

[01:42] I think it's a good idea.

[01:43] I think what's the first.

[01:44] I think it's your own.

[01:45] What do you want to air for a long time?

[01:48] I think about it.

[01:49] I think that's more fascinating than you're about to look at.

[01:53] I don't even think people would believe it.

[01:56] Because like a day or day, I don't like entrepreneurs.

[01:58] You don't get a lot of, you know, honestly, we just get shit on most of the time.

[02:01] Like we can tell more about people.

[02:02] They tell one and they make it a bit.

[02:04] Buy us for us.

[02:05] To help solve as many of those problems I've possibly came in one day.

[02:08] I can tell you.

[02:11] I can tell you.

[02:15] I can tell you.

[02:16] I can tell you.

[02:19] I can tell you.

[02:20] I can tell you exactly how many hours I'm sleeping.

[02:22] I'll see you in my last.

[02:23] That's nowhere.

[02:24] Yeah, yeah.

[02:25] Yeah.

[02:26] The insurance is open and lazy.

[02:27] The reaper is not getting it.

[02:29] Oh, man, what was it?

[02:30] Five hours and 45 minutes last night.

[02:32] Five hours and 20 the night before.

[02:34] Five hours and 17 the night before that.

[05:06] Yeah, that was your birthday.

[05:07] Yeah, that was your birthday.

[05:08] Yeah, that was your birthday.

[05:09] Yeah, that was your birthday.

[05:10] Yeah, that was your birthday.

[05:11] Yeah, that was your birthday.

[05:12] Yeah, that was your birthday.

[05:13] Yeah, that was your birthday.

[05:14] Yeah, that was your birthday.

[05:15] Yeah, that was your birthday.

[05:17] Ready?

[05:18] Hi there.

[05:19] That was a good one.

[05:20] Thank you so much.

[05:21] Appreciate it.

[05:22] Thanks for having us.

[05:23] Hello.

[05:24] Hello.

[05:25] How are you doing today?

[05:26] Good.

[05:27] So what did you guys, I guess, for today, we want to make sure we hit, I don't see the sun, but try the sun.

[05:30] A couple of pictures.

[05:31] I mean, we're hoping to do over a million copies.

[05:34] So, full of a box.

[05:36] We're striving very, very aggressively to get all of the shipments out within 72 hours, which is just a

[05:41] a per million feet because I think we're going to pass all of the launch sales that we did last

[05:46] time before we even released the book this time.

[05:48] Yeah, how many, how many posth we guys have?

[05:52] I'm not going to ask you to take all the pounds down.

[05:54] I'm just, I just want to have an understanding.

[05:56] Roughly about 80 of these.

[05:59] Hmm.

[06:00] I think we just take one pallet down and then we'll just film it and call it a day.

[06:05] Well, it's 240,000 divided by 3 and 80.

[06:10] So how many people will be here to like, actually move the product?

[06:15] What's kind of the tentative plan for getting, because I mean, I do that math, like, okay, 10 guys.

[06:20] I don't know how many, how many books a minute somebody can put out.

[06:23] You would know that math better than me.

[06:25] Because last year we had 30 and they got fucking hammered and I am five, this will be five times bigger than last year.

[06:34] Now, this time we are distributing between three different warehouses across the US, that way we can get it to you guys faster.

[06:41] We have 300 plus support staff that are going to be here for the launch.

[06:45] We have installed a really exceptional AI.

[06:48] It's just a lot.

[06:49] It's a lot because we have high standards.

[06:51] It really just comes down to that.

[06:52] It's a lot because we wanted to be exceptional for everyone at any touch point, any surface area that you're exposed to at the brand.

[06:58] All right.

[06:59] So we're opening this flat boy up.

[07:01] Somebody's going to get a lucky copy.

[07:05] Our goal is to get 1,800 more of these pounds of books.

[07:09] And we're going to try and do it in 24 hours, which is absolutely absurd.

[07:12] So we're here and we haven't started promoting it yet.

[07:16] Yeah.

[07:17] At all.

[07:18] From that's an email.

[07:19] One email.

[07:20] From all those things that we have done for my box office again.

[07:22] So yeah.

[07:23] No, I appreciate it.

[07:24] Thank you so much, Stephen.

[07:25] So we just got out of the warehouse.

[07:27] Just double checking on numbers for pounds and books.

[07:30] And what's going to get pre-kitted and make sure that they're staffed up so that they can handle a volume.

[07:35] Obviously this is not all the locations.

[07:37] This is one of many.

[07:38] So we're having meeting tomorrow and centralized with leadership and make sure that it's fully staffed so that we can accommodate it.

[07:46] But there's always the unknown.

[07:48] So thank you guys for all of us.

[07:50] I appreciate it.

[07:52] I'm Alex Shemozie.

[07:54] That's where it starts.

[07:55] So it's like, I'm actually Mozie.

[07:56] This might have been a bunch.

[07:57] And then we like rock and roll, right?

[07:59] Yeah.

[08:00] Those ads are actually already done.

[08:02] We've finished the 40 or so at least.

[08:04] And what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the best hooks that are still still work.

[08:09] Yeah.

[08:10] Great.

[08:11] So last launch.

[08:13] There was no.

[08:14] There was no offer to liquidate ads spent.

[08:17] And so I just wanted to monitor for the advertising.

[08:20] This one I'm demonstrating in the concept of the book, which is the money model.

[08:24] So basically, how do you pull cash forward?

[08:26] Like salary, cash conversion within a business so that you can scale.

[08:29] And so I want to demonstrate that with the launch.

[08:31] So that's what I'm doing.

[08:34] And so basically, the goal is to spend as much money as simply possible while maintaining

[08:39] break even or better.

[08:41] And the end result should be more good people knowing about it.

[08:45] So this one should be bigger than the last one.

[08:47] We'll find out as long as ad accounts and all that stuff works the way.

[08:52] You know, we hope.

[08:53] If you're struggling to get as many customers as you want or it's costing you too much to get customers.

[08:58] Rather than thinking, oh, I'm spending too much to get customers.

[09:01] Do what you can control.

[09:03] Make more from each one.

[09:04] And so if you want the freedom and the secret project, you only have to do one thing.

[09:09] Click the link.

[09:10] Red shirt.

[09:11] I'll see you there.

[09:12] Well, cut.

[09:13] I feel like I'm going to do a bottle of coffee.

[09:14] Yeah.

[09:15] That book is beef.

[09:16] I think it's possible to put a book in the hand of every entrepreneur in America.

[09:22] Books and experiences are the two things that really change my life.

[09:25] The goals that just have a really awesome experience for everyone in

[09:29] Mosaic and to come together and do watch better things and do it for the greater good.

[09:35] This is rarely die of starvation.

[09:38] They often die of indigestion.

[09:40] Fundamentally, you need another way to attract customers.

[09:42] Your business isn't growing because you don't have a good enough money model.

[09:45] When was the last time you ever heard of a money model?

[09:47] Well, you probably have it because no one's talking about it.

[09:50] So we can say, you got another green dude.

[09:52] They're in a party.

[09:53] I like this.

[09:54] He's going to pop off.

[09:55] Come to the book lunch.

[09:56] August 16th.

[09:57] Yeah.

[09:58] Well, I'll see you there.

[09:59] No, you bet.

[10:00] See, this is why we advertise.

[10:01] No one knows.

[10:02] We think we're so important.

[10:04] No one knows.

[10:05] And if you're watching right now and you didn't know, now you know, August 16th.

[10:08] The book comes out.

[10:09] It's going to be sick.

[10:10] Five mystery headlines.

[10:11] Four amazing free bonuses.

[10:13] If you just pre-order and I've got one secret project I've been working on for multiple

[10:17] years and you'll get it for free just by registering.

[10:19] See you there.

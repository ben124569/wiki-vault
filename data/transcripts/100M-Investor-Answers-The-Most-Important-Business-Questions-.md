[00:00] A number of businesses just lined up over two days

[00:02] to ask me questions.

[00:03] They reached from $200,000 a year to $140 million a year.

[00:06] And the crazy thing is, the questions

[00:07] between businesses are so similar

[00:09] that they apply to all of them.

[00:11] And we pull out the best moments

[00:13] that we think will give you the highest ROI in joy.

[00:17] Hey, Alex, thanks.

[00:17] Yeah, you bet.

[00:18] So my name is Zach Levine.

[00:19] We sell hand management services to New Yorkers.

[00:23] OK.

[00:24] Integrate a pen.

[00:24] So you can't get back if you tea.

[00:27] But like old people, young people, women, men.

[00:29] We have a bunch of avatars around

[00:30] which is potentially a problem.

[00:32] Brick and mortar.

[00:33] Brick and mortar.

[00:34] We're out of network endurance.

[00:36] Yeah.

[00:36] Because a dying which we'll get to.

[00:37] Sure.

[00:38] We do 4.2 in revenue.

[00:40] OK.

[00:40] Do your mostly insurance?

[00:41] Pretty well as a cash.

[00:42] Mostly insurance.

[00:43] Oh, mostly insurance.

[00:44] Out of no, we've got it.

[00:45] Yeah.

[00:45] 4.2 want to get to 20.

[00:46] OK.

[00:47] Got it.

[00:48] We have three offices.

[00:49] OK.

[00:50] And don't know exactly how to transition

[00:51] out of the dying business model.

[00:53] Obviously our industry is growing.

[00:55] Yeah.

[00:56] So what business model are you thinking about?

[00:58] Switching to cash.

[01:01] I have a bunch of friends who are in network and murdering it.

[01:03] In network.

[01:04] Yeah.

[01:04] Once you get a network.

[01:05] We've just heard it's a grind.

[01:07] Come out of ties.

[01:08] It is a problem.

[01:09] I mean, race to the bottom.

[01:10] Yeah.

[01:11] Why do you feel like the way that you have right now

[01:12] is dying for how to network?

[01:14] Because reimbursement from pairs are declining each year

[01:18] whereas inflation.

[01:19] Also going out.

[01:20] And because the amount of people who have out of network

[01:23] benefits is to induling as well,

[01:25] it's mostly just corporate.

[01:27] And that's even declining.

[01:29] Yeah, they're just getting smarter and they want to push

[01:31] everyone in network.

[01:32] So we're getting squeezed.

[01:34] Administrative burdens through the roof.

[01:36] Prior to all this crazy bullshit.

[01:38] So this is a therapy provider who bills insurance.

[01:42] He's dealing with an issue that a lot of out of network

[01:44] or dealing with just that reimbursement, aka what insurance

[01:47] companies pay providers is going down.

[01:49] But inflation and costs are going up

[01:51] and so that's squeezing their margins.

[01:52] And for this individual, he was making zero profit.

[01:55] And so he felt like he needed to change his model quickly.

[01:58] And so basically a two option.

[01:59] So you get to go in network, which is you

[02:01] have guaranteed customers.

[02:02] But you're getting in a lot of ways

[02:04] like lower quality customers that the government

[02:07] and things like that are paying for, mass market

[02:09] insurance is paying for, or you can go cash pay.

[02:13] Like you can people can just pay privately for whatever you want.

[02:16] And so he felt more aligned with the cash payment.

[02:19] And so either way though, I think understanding

[02:21] what strategy is required to win within each of those paths

[02:26] was kind of the real decision, which is like,

[02:28] what problem do you want to solve?

[02:29] Do you want to solve the problem of learning

[02:30] how to market and sell customers?

[02:32] Because that's what it's like when you are in kind of the cash

[02:35] business.

[02:36] And if they've never done that before, then that's

[02:37] a real, that's a real beast to get over.

[02:39] On the other hand, if you want to be in network,

[02:41] then it's going to be a business

[02:42] all that operational efficiency.

[02:43] It's a matter of terms on a capital.

[02:45] And basically how efficiently you can step up

[02:47] and how low you can keep costs across the business,

[02:50] because you have no pricing power.

[02:51] So it has to all be off of efficiency.

[02:53] And so those are basically the two paths that he had.

[02:56] And so I wanted to walk him through the questions

[02:59] to figure out which of those he felt more aligned with.

[03:02] And it sounded like he definitely wanted to go more

[03:04] the premium cash pay version.

[03:06] And so that was kind of the direction of the element.

[03:08] So you basically see it as like, I could either go

[03:09] in network and then make your entire business model

[03:12] around operational efficiency, which is,

[03:15] I mean, I've got somebody who murder it doing that.

[03:17] So I don't think there's anything going with that.

[03:20] Or alternatively, you just go premium, be the best,

[03:23] and be private, right, be cash pay.

[03:25] So the question is, how do you transition it?

[03:27] Yeah, yeah, I think we've decided as a team to believe

[03:29] we just don't want to be in that work.

[03:31] Sure.

[03:32] Because of the lifestyle.

[03:33] I guess so.

[03:33] And who you deal with?

[03:34] Yeah.

[03:35] A pain, literally for you.

[03:37] A really, I guess for them.

[03:39] So fundamentally, I think you just have to think about this

[03:41] as basically starting a business over

[03:45] but with resources already.

[03:47] We don't really have to think about the service.

[03:48] We probably have to think about the packaging itself.

[03:49] Like what's the, what's the grant sum off her for this?

[03:52] Yeah.

[03:53] And you'll have a number of,

[03:57] you're just going to become a normal business,

[03:59] which is just like you will run advertisements

[04:01] and you will make offers to people

[04:03] and they will come in and then they will take their credit

[04:05] right out and they will buy stuff from you.

[04:08] And so it's probably more that it conceptually feels

[04:11] complex more than it actually is.

[04:12] And so it's probably a ripping the band-aid off thing,

[04:16] which is that I would just,

[04:17] so one is what channel of acquisition

[04:19] you're going to use, I'm guessing right now,

[04:21] is it mostly word of mouth?

[04:22] Yeah, it's referrals.

[04:23] Okay, yeah.

[04:24] It's the first one time.

[04:25] Yeah, so one is you can start up selling existing customers.

[04:29] So like obviously they have what's covered

[04:31] in from insurance but then, you know,

[04:33] up selling other packages that'll get your team a little bit

[04:35] used to being like it's okay to pay us.

[04:37] That's from like a really tactical level.

[04:39] From an acquisition perspective, you've got content,

[04:41] you've got outreach and then you've got,

[04:42] you've got paid ads, right?

[04:43] And alternatively you can have affiliates.

[04:45] So we have to pick, so of those four things,

[04:47] which ones do you feel like you are better suited?

[04:49] So from affiliates it's like go to,

[04:52] shoot injury attorneys or like you want to find the person

[04:55] that they're going to see prior to hitting you.

[04:57] Try to bunch of that and the issue there is that

[05:00] they want to send in network or if your injury

[05:02] attorneys to workers' cop cases, which they pay very well.

[05:06] Okay, so you don't want to go from that perspective.

[05:07] So you don't want to do affiliates content,

[05:09] probably in my opinion probably isn't the best way.

[05:13] So then you have outreach and you've got paid ads.

[05:15] I'm going to bet paid ads is going to be your better bet

[05:16] since it's local, it's pretty straightforward.

[05:19] Operationally is not complex.

[05:20] Like running paid ads in a local area is like pretty easy.

[05:24] You drop a pen.

[05:25] You do it.

[05:26] You say we need more, so obviously we have a bunch

[05:28] of different types of avatars.

[05:29] So like really now, like how would you say going about?

[05:31] You're probably going to end up finding

[05:33] that you have one to three offers that actually convert.

[05:37] And then the remainder of your business

[05:38] will be upselling and crossselling when they walk in the door.

[05:41] So instead of thinking about your business

[05:42] is having like, you know, we have 15 services,

[05:45] we advertise all 15.

[05:46] You're going to have one to three that convert really

[05:48] profitably on the front end and then the remainder of your

[05:50] business is crossselling and upselling.

[05:51] So it's like you're going to have the most efficient door

[05:53] into your business and then you'll end up just crossselling

[05:56] and upselling people and retain people from there.

[05:59] And so like in terms of next steps,

[06:00] it's you need to record an actual ad for an offer

[06:04] and then put it on meta and then drop a pen on the map

[06:07] and do a 10 mile radius, hopefully all three are close together.

[06:11] And you'll run the ad that'll then go to either a CRM

[06:14] or if you're low tech, you can just go to Google Sheets

[06:17] and then you can have your front desk call them within 60 seconds

[06:20] and then if they don't pick up, call them again

[06:22] and get them booked.

[06:23] Because your time is valuable, you'll probably

[06:25] want to consider running some sort of highly discounted

[06:29] assessment on the front end.

[06:30] So that'd be like a $200.

[06:32] Yeah, X-ray or something like that.

[06:34] They can get for 19 or 20.

[06:35] You don't care about that.

[06:36] You just want to credit card on file so that

[06:38] when they walk in the door, you have two things.

[06:39] One is that.

[06:40] When they walk in the door, well, one, you want them

[06:44] to walk in the door because they paid to,

[06:45] you can charge a notion if you want to.

[06:48] But typically, if you're getting even a low ticket amount,

[06:50] you'll be in the 70-80% sure, right?

[06:51] So you won't waste a connection or tap.

[06:54] So tap for on, actually,

[06:55] over the phone.

[06:56] Yeah.

[06:57] Yeah.

[06:57] And just for the discount offer, now when they come in the door,

[07:00] you'll do the assessment.

[07:01] And then after the assessment, you don't treat them.

[07:03] You'll do the sale appointment then.

[07:05] You sell up point of greatest need, not point of greatest satisfaction.

[07:08] So at that point is when you'll make the offer.

[07:10] And then you'll be like, hey, awesome.

[07:12] You'll use the card.

[07:12] We have a file because you already

[07:13] have it on file because you got it earlier

[07:15] to make some much smoother or so.

[07:16] So the issue he's dealing with is that he's

[07:18] at Optimize State.

[07:20] She's 20 to 49 in terms of his head count.

[07:22] And the issue number one that he has is that he can't hire

[07:27] higher level talent because they expect full competition.

[07:30] And he basically has very little cash to bring in the talent

[07:33] that he needs.

[07:34] So that's number one issue that he's dealing with.

[07:37] He's spending money to grow, but he's not growing,

[07:39] money's missing.

[07:40] And so that's an issue that he's dealing with in finance.

[07:42] Because he has so many products and services,

[07:45] the improvement between this thing says going down.

[07:47] And as our convert, basically, he doesn't have any real ads

[07:50] or real way of getting customers in.

[07:52] And the costs are going up.

[07:53] And so these are the issues he's dealing with,

[07:55] which is really common at this stage.

[07:57] Now let's look at what he has to probably do

[07:59] in order to improve it.

[08:01] And so he has to create customer segmentation

[08:03] by cohort and activation process.

[08:05] And then install sales training for his team

[08:09] so that he can start segmenting people

[08:13] and upselling them down a customer journey path.

[08:15] Instead of marketing all of these different products,

[08:17] he basically needs to make one or two

[08:19] or three entrance points in the business.

[08:21] Then across selling upsell, all of these additional services

[08:24] that might not convert as well in the front end,

[08:26] but work very well for continuity or for upsells and downsells

[08:29] or even high ticket upsells on the back end.

[08:32] And so he basically has to shift his perspective

[08:34] from somebody who builds insurance,

[08:35] that's just like whatever they take off the menu.

[08:37] Because insurance encourages people to be like,

[08:39] here's all the different services,

[08:41] and this is what we pay for them,

[08:42] and so people just trying to offer lots of stuff.

[08:44] Once you have a cash business,

[08:45] it's all about efficiency of acquisition.

[08:47] You're trying to acquire customers as profitably as possible

[08:49] and then ascend them to the highest LTV.

[08:51] And so this is basically what he has to build

[08:53] is the sales system, the ad assembly process,

[08:56] to increase the volume of people coming in,

[08:58] segment the customers, and then learn to head

[09:00] hunt higher levels of roles once he increases the cash flow.

[09:02] Got it.

[09:03] That help?

[09:04] Yeah.

[09:05] But that's what you have to do.

[09:06] Like you have to learn how to acquire customers

[09:08] that are cash based.

[09:09] And so that means that you have to run ads

[09:10] and you have to sell shit.

[09:11] What would you do, like if you were saying

[09:13] from a strategy standpoint, like we have the current business

[09:15] that's doing 4% to 1,000,000 and revenue?

[09:17] You're going to keep that business.

[09:18] So all of your discretionary resources

[09:20] are going to go towards this.

[09:22] If you want to build a bridge to tomorrow.

[09:24] Yeah.

[09:25] Should we do any of the more on the things

[09:27] that are still working within out of network?

[09:29] Like it's really just that we have limited resources

[09:32] how much should we spend on each.

[09:35] Let's profit?

[09:36] We're at base good zero.

[09:37] Oh, shit.

[09:38] Yeah.

[09:39] Let's start with the problem.

[09:41] Yeah.

[09:42] We waited.

[09:43] Yeah.

[09:43] We waited longer than, yeah.

[09:45] Yeah.

[09:45] I understand.

[09:45] Because you can't control how you're reimbursed.

[09:48] No.

[09:48] But we can remove the lowest reimbursement.

[09:51] Reimbursing patients, which is like,

[09:52] remove them here, then we can lower our cost structure.

[09:54] We can go that route.

[09:55] I think that would probably be the first thing

[09:57] that I would do.

[09:58] And then you want to free a cash flow?

[10:00] So yeah.

[10:01] You use this resources in terms of time and money

[10:03] to build a bridge.

[10:05] Can we say that?

[10:05] Thanks a lot.

[10:06] Yeah, you've got all of these things

[10:08] are on the graduate list at this stage.

[10:10] And that's because businesses behave in patterns.

[10:12] By the way, as a free gift for you,

[10:14] if you like the scaling roadmap,

[10:15] I'd like to know where you're at.

[10:17] You can go to acquisition.com for slash road map

[10:19] and plug information.

[10:20] And it'll spit it out for you.

[10:22] Exactly where you're at.

[10:23] Don't worry.

[10:23] It's absolutely free.

[10:24] So go and enjoy it.

[10:25] If you want my team's actual help on the thing you paid,

[10:28] you can schedule a call.

[10:29] And we'll see if we can help you out.

[10:30] Hey, Alex.

[10:30] My name is Henry.

[10:31] I sell education.

[10:33] I teach people how to fix and flip.

[10:35] Mainly the Hispanic market.

[10:36] So it's only in Spanish.

[10:38] We did 1.3 mill last year, second year in business.

[10:41] And we want to do 3 million this year.

[10:44] So with a more better new, right?

[10:47] Right now, we only do two events a year.

[10:50] Big events, 600 people.

[10:52] And we upsell to a high ticket, 12,000.

[10:56] And we convert 20% of the room more or less.

[10:58] So that 80% that went to that room

[11:03] never sees me again.

[11:04] I never sell them anything again.

[11:06] And while that 20% they bought my high ticket,

[11:08] that mentorship is a year.

[11:10] And after that, I don't sell them anything ever again.

[11:13] OK.

[11:14] So more better, do I just do more of these events

[11:19] and like never ending looking for new customers

[11:22] for the rest of my life for your info?

[11:24] Yes.

[11:25] You're good.

[11:25] You're in education.

[11:26] Yeah.

[11:27] And education graduates people.

[11:29] Yeah.

[11:30] It's how education works.

[11:31] So if you look at the education system overall,

[11:34] the way to create continuity and education,

[11:35] it's just always have something else to learn or teach.

[11:38] I like first year.

[11:39] Now you're an undergrad.

[11:39] Now you're an graduate student.

[11:40] Now you have a master's.

[11:41] And then there's a PhD and you get a second PhD.

[11:42] Like you just keep the young people who

[11:44] just become endless students.

[11:45] And so do you want to sell the business eventually?

[11:47] Or do you just want to make money?

[11:49] Make money.

[11:50] I mean, we're not.

[11:50] That's fine.

[11:51] No, I prefer the truth.

[11:53] I mean, the easiest thing to do is to double the amount of engineering.

[11:56] Either you either go to 1 or 1 or 1 or 2 or 1,200.

[12:01] And would you travel or just stay in where I'm out in Miami?

[12:05] Is that where you run them?

[12:05] No.

[12:06] In Miami?

[12:07] Yeah, I'll do these goes.

[12:07] West Coast.

[12:08] Yeah.

[12:08] That may be Texas or something.

[12:09] Yeah.

[12:10] OK.

[12:11] So Henry is at the product-sized stage and the issue that he's

[12:15] dealing with is that customers have nothing else to buy and

[12:18] turn.

[12:19] Literally right there, first line, and he says it himself.

[12:21] And so in order to graduate, he has to connect his customer

[12:24] successor product and then make something new to sell them,

[12:26] which is the backhand.

[12:27] So I recommended he fall exactly that advice and create

[12:30] either a higher level thing or if you want to build out a continuity that

[12:35] actually sticks, maybe consider downselling something that's maybe a

[12:39] cheaper annual fee for continued access to some of his services and

[12:44] events.

[12:45] But the big picture though is what does he want to do?

[12:47] Now, if he's just said, I want to sell this company, then we have to

[12:49] create some sort of revenue retention so that it becomes valuable.

[12:52] But for him, he was like, I just want to make more money.

[12:55] And so then the obvious answer is like, cool, then just do way more.

[12:58] And so instead of just having the two events on one side of the US,

[13:01] put two events on the other side, just like that, you can double the business

[13:04] with really no operational risk whatsoever.

[13:06] I mean, you have a really simple solution.

[13:08] Like just run the same playbook more times.

[13:12] If I want, if you were like, I want to build a more valuable business

[13:14] then I would say take the year to figure out revenue retention, which is

[13:17] how do I get these people who pay me $12,000 to pay me another $12,000.

[13:20] Or pay me $30,000 next year.

[13:23] Or even downsell them to something that's $5,000 year, but they stay.

[13:26] Right.

[13:27] I'm focused on retaining that top tier of that paid me a high ticket.

[13:31] Yeah, but I think considering for the model that you have downselling the

[13:34] upsell, I actually like a lot.

[13:36] So if they paid you $12, maybe they'll stay for three or three to five.

[13:42] Just to have access to the network and some of your vendors and the stuff that you

[13:45] kind of like provide.

[13:47] And I think that's something that people would be far more likely to stick with.

[13:51] And so then you can basically think about your business as, for more zooming all the way

[13:55] out perspective, is that the $12,000 is actually like an offset cac, which is like

[14:00] you could break even the $12,000 if you know that someone gets it into a $3,000

[14:03] membership that's pretty much all margin that doesn't leave.

[14:07] So it's like that allows you to spend way more than your competition because they need

[14:11] to make money on the 12, you can break even on the 12.

[14:13] And then you just have the stack of $3,000 bills that just keeps stacking up.

[14:18] That's like low effort to maintain.

[14:19] Got it.

[14:20] Makes sense?

[14:21] Yeah.

[14:22] That's good.

[14:23] That's what I want to make for what it makes us a lot easier.

[14:25] Yeah.

[14:26] Yeah.

[14:27] Don't say I want to make an impact.

[14:28] So big picture, he's an education business and education business is graduate customers because

[14:33] they teach him.

[14:34] If you do a good job, you graduate.

[14:35] That's kind of how school works.

[14:36] And so the real continuity of education is just more education.

[14:39] Look at college than you have a master's, than you have a PhD and they have a double

[14:42] PhD.

[14:43] And then you just crazy who knows.

[14:44] All right.

[14:45] So the point here though is that he could try and build a recurring revenue stream from

[14:51] this business.

[14:52] But in all likelihood, his goal was just to make more money.

[14:54] And so why add complexity if that's not his goal.

[14:57] So I was like, cool, just run more events and do them in different areas so you

[15:00] track different customers.

[15:01] Hey Alex, thanks for everything that you've done.

[15:03] I'm James.

[15:04] I sell custom branch railings to homeowners.

[15:07] I we did 420 or so last year.

[15:10] I was I've read 10X is greater than 2X.

[15:14] And so last night it was coming to me again.

[15:15] Like, do I really just want to double or do I want to try to 10X?

[15:19] And so what I want to try to do is to develop a network of products best fires, our

[15:24] tax designers, contractors that can act kind of like a referral network.

[15:27] I want to shift away from the Minos and to focus more on Wales.

[15:30] We had one client last year about $50,000 worth of handrails.

[15:34] And if I could get 10 of those in a year, then I would double revenue just with 10 clients.

[15:39] So kind of what are my best strategies to go about achieving that?

[15:42] So where did you source the single way all this year?

[15:46] He found me.

[15:47] It's all inbound.

[15:48] It's all through search.

[15:49] So SCRPBC.

[15:50] SCO.

[15:51] I just started Facebook ads about three or four weeks ago.

[15:54] They were going pretty good, qualified about half of the lead so far.

[15:59] So I would.

[16:01] So if you want to go well hunting, then I think your initial thought strategy of finding

[16:06] the architectural firms and engineering firms at what not is a good one.

[16:10] I would probably try the outreach method as my primary right because you can be hyper-targeted

[16:15] in terms of who you're reaching out to.

[16:18] And the key to making it work, that was like, what's in it for them?

[16:23] To refer you business.

[16:25] Are you asking me that?

[16:26] That's an excellent question.

[16:27] OK.

[16:28] So architects will typically in a plan like if they make a set of plans, they'll specify

[16:32] what kind of tiles to use and what kind of windows to use, et cetera.

[16:35] So we've gotten plans in the past where it's got the pictures from the website with the

[16:40] CAD drawings and everything on the plans.

[16:43] And so it's like how to persuade them to do that kind of an upsension.

[16:48] And I should also note that we ship nationwide.

[16:50] So this is not like a hyper-loved one.

[16:53] Are you shipping or are you doing insolvers or no?

[16:54] No, we haven't done anything.

[16:55] Are you just, you just, you just.

[16:57] You just ship product.

[16:58] Interesting.

[16:59] Got it.

[17:01] Then who are the decision makers?

[17:03] Well right now it's been primarily residential.

[17:05] It's what it sounds like.

[17:06] Right, it's primarily homeowners.

[17:07] We've done some commercial work, but it's primarily homeowners who are looking for something

[17:12] different.

[17:13] And so it's very, what I call intentional inbound search.

[17:17] It's like they're looking for something, they're deliberately searching it out.

[17:20] They find it, you know, we have a lead magnet, kind of, which is like 250,000.

[17:24] That's the odd.

[17:25] Yeah.

[17:26] Yeah.

[17:27] Well, this is a fundamental change in business strategy.

[17:30] So you're aware of that.

[17:31] So with that comes risk.

[17:33] Because the highest risk you just return move or lowest risk, I guess, is probably

[17:38] that.

[17:39] If I were like tomorrow, what I do, I'd probably just add PPC in right now because you

[17:43] already have something that's working on SEO.

[17:44] I would probably see how can I get way more articles written to the My SEO traffic and

[17:48] go out, can I tackle more, you know, more keywords.

[17:52] That's like the foreshore will work and make you more money play.

[17:56] The going after Wales for sure can make more money because why not add zero to things.

[18:03] It'll just be a completely different sale and you'll have two levels of sales.

[18:07] So sale number one is going to be for the affiliates and then figuring out what's going

[18:10] to make it worth it for them.

[18:11] And then the second level is what's the actual sale to the well customer.

[18:15] So what James has is he's using affiliates to get customers, which is this is inside

[18:19] of the leads book.

[18:21] All right.

[18:22] And so affiliates are businesses that have your customers that market and sell your stuff

[18:28] to them.

[18:29] All right.

[18:30] And so fundamentally, I walked James through the three different ways that I have found

[18:34] that work best for affiliates.

[18:37] So who's the decision maker with the Wales?

[18:40] Like the final decision maker?

[18:41] Yeah.

[18:42] It's going to be the homeowner, whoever's doing the project.

[18:46] But so you just want bigger homeowners?

[18:48] The architects have the ability to specify it and to put it in front of the client.

[18:52] So like we also did another one, which was about 60,000 for a guy that was doing development

[18:58] of Airbnb's in Virginia.

[19:01] So you put up like six-year kind of things.

[19:03] Yeah.

[19:04] And so I had two bit very big.

[19:05] So both of them were architects that sent you these.

[19:08] The one was an architect and the other was a construction company.

[19:10] OK.

[19:11] Yeah.

[19:11] So you're going to have to go beat a B outreach.

[19:13] Is the, basically, when you look at Core 4, that's going to be your, what you're

[19:17] going to do.

[19:18] And then they're going to be your affiliates.

[19:20] And so the million dollar question is, what's in it for them?

[19:24] So my proposition would be, so there's three ways you can do a fillet.

[19:30] That's at least in the world of Alex.

[19:33] So you have they sell you shit for you and they get a commission.

[19:36] That's option one.

[19:38] That's typically my least favorite option.

[19:40] But it is an option.

[19:41] Option two is that you give them some morsel of something that you sell.

[19:46] They can sell for 100% markup.

[19:48] They can keep all the money.

[19:49] But you get the introduction.

[19:50] This is my favorite way of doing it.

[19:52] The third way is that you allow them to just bundle in your free thing with their services.

[19:58] And with architecture firms, they sell like they're going to bundle in a railing.

[20:02] For there's sort of a discovery of everybody else.

[20:03] Like those are the three things.

[20:04] So it's like, they bundle your, you're basically, you're lead magnitude in for free with their

[20:09] thing they sell.

[20:10] So it makes, it enhances the value of their raw package.

[20:12] You give them the things that they can upsell your lead magnitude for an amount of money that

[20:17] they can keep on 100% of or they just sell your stuff and they get a kickback.

[20:21] Is there a version for this where they can just upcharge?

[20:25] You can do a small portion of this that they get 100% of.

[20:29] 100% like I don't think so.

[20:30] Maybe some kind of contractors are architect discount.

[20:33] We want them to be stupid to say no.

[20:35] Yeah, because like the generic like you get 20% kickback is just like everyone does it.

[20:43] Like who here does 20% kickback for anybody who refers to you business?

[20:46] You can raise your hand.

[20:47] I'm not going to be upset.

[20:48] Okay.

[20:49] And so the point is is that and you probably know and hear as referred to anyone else business.

[20:53] Because no one cares.

[20:54] That's kind of point.

[20:56] And so it has to be an irresistible offer.

[20:59] And so if we give away the lead magnitude or something, think about it as like my

[21:03] cack for a $50,000 customer is the cost of the lead magnet.

[21:08] And if I close one out of three introductions then it's three x the cost of lead magnet

[21:12] is my cost to a hard customer which is usually pretty darn good.

[21:15] So what I outline with James is right here on page 237 is that there's three ways you

[21:20] can integrate your product into their offer.

[21:23] Basically getting an affiliate to sell your stuff.

[21:25] And so I order these from easiest to hardest.

[21:27] So first you can give away your lead magnet with every purchase.

[21:30] So they just give away your stuff for free in order to get to get leads.

[21:34] So those other product with your lead magnet or those give your lead magnet away.

[21:37] But either way you're not making anything from it, they're just going to give it away.

[21:41] Second is that you can get them to sell your lead magnet separately to their audience,

[21:44] which is my preference.

[21:45] You give away something that has hard cost or real cost and you let them sell it for

[21:51] whatever and then the cost to you is just the cost of delivering the thing.

[21:55] And so if I had a marker business, right, I might say I will let you sell one of my markers

[22:00] and let's say my marker cost me 50 cents for whatever you want to charge for it.

[22:04] And they're like, I can sell this marker for $5.

[22:06] So I'm really cool.

[22:07] You sell for $5.

[22:08] But I now have a contact of somebody who bought these markers and I might call them up and say,

[22:12] hey, you've got blue.

[22:13] Do you want red and do you want green and you want black and all of these are $5.

[22:18] And my hard cost is just the 50 cents it cost me to deliver the marker.

[22:21] And so the question is, what percentage of customers do buy a blue marker by the other

[22:25] three?

[22:26] And so if I found out one out of two customers who buy a marker at 50 cents and to buying

[22:31] these, then my cost to acquire a customer through affiliates is 50 cents times two.

[22:37] So the cost of delivering my lead magnet is the actual cost.

[22:41] And here's the craze part.

[22:42] If they go make zillions of dollars selling your thing, great.

[22:46] It means that you're going to make even more money upselling your stuff.

[22:50] And so a lot of people get very greedy about what other people are making off of their

[22:53] stuff, just focus on the money you're making with the deal makes sense for you.

[22:57] That's one of the piece advice that Layla actually taught me.

[22:59] She said, never count the other guys money.

[23:01] And it's a really good piece of advice and I'll pass it on to you.

[23:04] But it sounds like an irresponsible offer to the architecture firm because they're like, we can

[23:07] just sell this and keep on to percent.

[23:09] Like, yep, just make the introduction and deliver that.

[23:11] And then when you talk to the customer, you're like, yeah, I'll deliver that.

[23:13] Here's one rail.

[23:15] You need 10 more.

[23:16] And then you make the sale.

[23:18] Does that make sense?

[23:19] A lot of entirely short, like people would order the entire project.

[23:23] So it's not like you can just, like I can't just ship you a sample and be like, hey,

[23:26] look, here's a.

[23:27] Yeah, so then you're going to have to do the commission based structure, which is not my favorite.

[23:29] But that's probably the way you're going to have to do it.

[23:33] So either you can do the discount.

[23:34] I mean, I would say guys, I have 20 percent that I can play with here.

[23:38] So you can take all 20 and give them no discount.

[23:40] You can take a 10 percent discount and then they get, and you get 10 percent kickback.

[23:44] Like, this is what I got.

[23:45] I'll make it work whatever you want, but this is my bear bottom price.

[23:48] Okay.

[23:49] And I think that's what, like that's the outbound strategy.

[23:51] So should I then in turn raise prices for direct to consumer?

[23:56] Yeah, I love that.

[23:57] Okay.

[23:58] Thank you.

[23:59] Yeah, I love that for you.

[24:03] The reason I like that second offer, because I think it's very compelling.

[24:06] Now obviously the third week you can do it is just get them to sell your offer and then have some sort of kickback.

[24:09] Obviously many companies do this.

[24:11] It has to be very compelling because almost every business I know is like, yeah, I give

[24:15] 20 percent, at least in services.

[24:17] Every business I know gives 20 percent kickbacks for anybody who refers business their way.

[24:22] It's like, yeah, but no one does anything with that.

[24:24] And so it has to be enough that would really change someone's behavior.

[24:27] And so think about it like this is that the offer has to be good enough that it changes

[24:31] what they do with their business.

[24:33] If it does the change what they do, the offer wasn't compelling enough.

[24:35] Or you made it too hard.

[24:37] Right?

[24:38] So it's either make the thing better or make it easier for them.

[24:40] My name's Cody.

[24:41] Myself roofs the people.

[24:42] We did 140 million last year trying to do 250 million this year.

[24:47] Trying to figure out how to follow the principle of giving away more guarantees and bonuses

[24:53] when I have such high hard cost and such a high ticket item.

[24:56] Yeah.

[24:57] What are gross margins right now?

[24:58] 40 percent.

[24:59] Gross.

[25:00] What's that?

[25:01] 10 to 15.

[25:02] Okay.

[25:03] Got it.

[25:04] Do you want to sell it or do you just want to keep it forever?

[25:06] Well, I actually just sold my roofing business and now we're part of a PE.

[25:10] I'm not sure if I can confirm that now I'm directing that entire all.

[25:13] Sorry, you the platform.

[25:14] Yes.

[25:15] Okay.

[25:16] So you're the platform and how many tuckins have they done?

[25:17] Eight.

[25:18] Got it.

[25:19] How long has it been since they started?

[25:21] About three, four years.

[25:23] I've just got acquired 30 days or we just closed 30 days ago and now they're trying to roll

[25:26] everything into my brand and I'm scared.

[25:30] Yeah.

[25:31] Got it.

[25:32] Okay.

[25:33] So sorry.

[25:34] Go back to the original question.

[25:35] I have a better context on this.

[25:36] So how do I give you a follow the principle of give away more value?

[25:38] Make the offer so good.

[25:40] It's, you got to feel jump saying no.

[25:42] When I've such high hard costs, I can't really do a money back guarantee.

[25:45] I can't really give away more than a roof.

[25:50] Well, the question is, is that the constraint?

[25:52] Is that the thing that's limiting the growth of the business?

[25:55] In my theory, yes, because if I create a good enough offer, then I could roll that offer

[25:58] out to the other eight other brands and that would be the biggest amount of leverage

[26:01] I could deliver in the shortest amount of time.

[26:04] And is everyone insurance based?

[26:06] That's why they acquired us because we're retelling.

[26:08] So through the only guy selling just new roofs, everyone else is doing storm chasing and

[26:12] damage repair and shit like that.

[26:13] Correct.

[26:14] And what they want us to do is bring the retail model to the other brands and down

[26:18] another layer as we sell everything 100% virtually.

[26:20] So no-in-home appointments.

[26:22] It's all, you know, digital.

[26:23] So that's what they, that's the vision is taking that, you know, nationwide.

[26:27] Centralized sales virtually.

[26:29] Correct.

[26:30] So you want an irresistible roof offer.

[26:31] The greater the change, the greater the risk that the change doesn't yield the outcome

[26:35] that you want in the business.

[26:36] And so fun, really, you're always making a bet that you're going to get a higher return

[26:39] off of incurring the cost of change than it cost you to do the change, right?

[26:43] And so in this instance, he is now, you know, 30 days in or 60 days post acquisition of his

[26:49] roofing company getting bought with seven other roofing companies and for them to try and combine

[26:53] them.

[26:54] He's the one who's supposed to like, lead the effort of combining all the stuff.

[26:56] And so the idea of like, let's change the offer.

[26:59] The offer is one of the highest leverage things you can change, but it also affects every

[27:03] department.

[27:04] It changes how you build.

[27:05] It changes how you sell.

[27:06] It changes how you advertise the changes everything, right?

[27:08] Which is why it can change the business over.

[27:10] Right?

[27:11] But it can also destroy the business over.

[27:12] And so when I see a business set in aggregate between this eight has $140 million in revenue

[27:16] and $38 million in EBITDA, you're talking about a business that's got probably $300 to $400 million

[27:21] enterprise value.

[27:22] I would be very hesitant to immediately change something that's obviously working.

[27:27] And so there's lesser degrees of change that have higher like goods of working, that

[27:30] could still materially impact the business in terms of increasing the likelihood that it

[27:34] exits.

[27:35] And $1 million, I'm guessing that's what he wants to get his slice from.

[27:38] Centralizing the sales would allow them to decrease costs because they could not have

[27:43] guys on the road.

[27:44] It's just cheaper to do it.

[27:45] It's also easier to hire salespeople or remote.

[27:47] All of these kind of downstream cost savings.

[27:49] The other benefit is that when you hire remotely, you have access to a bigger pool.

[27:52] So you can get better salespeople at lower prices who close more deals and they could

[27:57] cut down all the the real big costs for this business is salespeople are unproductive.

[28:02] All right, so people who they're losing leads on people who can't close.

[28:06] And so by reducing costs, increasing talent and increasing sales looted utilization, all

[28:12] three of those things reduce costs and increase revenue, which could disproportionately

[28:15] drive EBITDA, which is what that company is being valued on.

[28:19] And so when I look at that, I'm like, this is a change that you have to do in order

[28:22] to sell the company and we'll result in revenue and EBITDA growth.

[28:27] And so let's do this massive change first before risking the biscuit.

[28:32] Right, because we might just found out that just from doing that, we get a 25% increase

[28:35] in EBITDA and that might be enough.

[28:38] Just bringing everything together plus adding the 25% you like you might be right

[28:41] is right and at that point why risk it?

[28:43] I feel like if I were in your position, the first thing that I would do would be

[28:47] centralized everything first without trying to change.

[28:50] Basically, I would I would take the model that I already know works is what was your revenue

[28:53] before you did that before you were applying.

[28:55] Okay, you're doing 20.

[28:56] So I would like in terms of introducing levels of change, so this is actually pretty good

[29:00] for everybody.

[29:01] I would typically not try and change like five things at once.

[29:04] And so you centralizing all sales is going to get cost efficiency improvements and

[29:10] you're going to be able to have higher sales utilization so you probably cut off the

[29:14] bottom third of the sales force that's low performing.

[29:16] That alone might give you a 25% lift in general because the best sales guys will take

[29:21] more of the sales and you'll have centralized all the costs like we'll have centralized

[29:25] all the costs right.

[29:26] And so you'll have an increase in revenue and a decreasing cost that's paired.

[29:30] That would probably be my first step.

[29:32] The third part of that position, that's only where I did that position is that they

[29:35] were going to give me full control and centralized sales.

[29:37] So but like I wouldn't I mean, I know the question is about roofing, but like that's

[29:41] what I would do first and that will probably take you six months or more.

[29:45] Realistically, in terms of in terms of the offer to roofs, in offer that's worked really

[29:52] well in home services is instead of being a money back guarantee, I position as a profit

[29:58] guarantee.

[30:00] So it's like listen, you want your thing to be on time and on budget probably and so I guarantee

[30:04] that I will deliver it on time and on budget or I'll give you my profit which is 20% whatever.

[30:10] And that way it's like you're not underwater and you still have 40% gross margins.

[30:14] You're not really losing on the deal.

[30:16] But then people are like, okay, so he's got skin in the game.

[30:19] And so that's a way of closing significantly more deals because the two biggest obstacles

[30:25] that you would know this, but in most home services it's on time on budget and probably

[30:29] for roofs.

[30:30] It's like in how much am I going to be displaced, how much it's going to interrupt my life.

[30:33] And so I would put my guarantee around those items and then just have a marginal amount

[30:37] that's back.

[30:38] But it's really just because all they don't, so the big thing that just right, we're

[30:42] going to guarantee is that people don't want their money back.

[30:44] They want the roof.

[30:45] And so they just want to know that you care enough to make sure the roof gets delivered.

[30:48] And so that's really the solve for the guarantee is it just pays down risk of them not getting

[30:53] what they want.

[30:54] And so as long as that gets accomplished, you don't have to do with money back.

[30:56] You can just do it with some money back that gets them to say yes.

[30:59] So help.

[31:00] That's perfect.

[31:01] So you wanted a better offer, despite all of those improvements and I was like,

[31:05] okay, I think I can, I could think of something for you.

[31:07] So if you, if you look inside the offers book, page 125, I talk about guarantees.

[31:12] And so this is the guarantee formula.

[31:14] So whenever you're thinking about adding a guarantee, like this is what I think through.

[31:17] So if you don't ex in why time, we will z, like that is fundamentally what a guarantee is.

[31:23] And most people, I would say a lot of times people just say, I guarantee it.

[31:27] But that doesn't mean anything.

[31:28] You have to say what the terms of the guarantee are on a timely.

[31:30] What do I get if you don't perform, right?

[31:33] And so with this business and some people just like, well, I can't give a money back guarantee

[31:36] because I would just lose too much money, understandable.

[31:39] Now if you have our costs like he does, then what we can do is we can just give something

[31:42] else.

[31:43] We need their lesser portion of money.

[31:44] We can give something else for free.

[31:46] And so the guarantee is a consideration.

[31:48] That's what are we going to do to show you that we're just as invested as you in the

[31:53] outcome being positive, right?

[31:55] And so we basically, we shift some of the risk from the customer on to us.

[31:59] And this is all you're doing is the business when you're doing guarantees.

[32:02] They take some risk of buying and you're saying, no, I'm going to take some of that risk.

[32:05] And so sure, you can take 100% but in this situation, you'd be taking like 200% of the

[32:10] risk, basically you'd be losing money, right?

[32:12] And so the idea is, again, you can add stuff.

[32:15] So hey, if you don't get what you want, I can add things, which is like, hey, if you don't

[32:19] hit your goal, I'll add more time, which does work as a sales tool.

[32:23] Sometimes though in the actual, in the real world, if someone's not getting your results,

[32:26] they're like, I don't want any more from you, I hate you, right?

[32:29] And so it does still work as a sale, but it's one of those like mid, right?

[32:33] Now alternatively, you can go the reverse direction, which is take away negative, which is

[32:37] a discount, right?

[32:38] So, hey, I can't give you all your money back, but I can give you back my gross profit.

[32:41] I can give it back 20% or I can give you back 10%.

[32:44] These are all things that you can choose to get back.

[32:46] And the thing is, is it just shows that you have skin in the game, and all we have to

[32:49] think about, this is the point of a guarantee, so I want to make sure I'm very clear.

[32:52] The point of a guarantee is not to have the craziest guarantee.

[32:55] The point of a guarantee is to maximize net conversions.

[32:58] All right, so we just need to increase sales more than we increase refunds.

[33:04] So proportionally, we net more sales.

[33:06] And if you can just do 10% back, then that's enough to change behavior.

[33:10] And that's the point.

[33:11] Like, if there's no difference between giving 25% back and giving 100% back in terms

[33:15] of the actual performance of the sale, then give 25%.

[33:19] And so you can move what you're guaranteeing in order to find the sweet spot and figure

[33:22] out what's actually compelling to your customer.

[33:25] And most times, the things that you want to guarantee around are their biggest fears.

[33:29] And homestores and stuff, it's usually me around time and around budget, right?

[33:32] Are they getting a dental time?

[33:33] They get around budget.

[33:34] If it's other services, it might be different than that.

[33:36] And so you'll know your service is better.

[33:38] But you want to list out what their biggest fears are, and then crush those with the guarantee.

[33:42] Hey, Alex.

[33:43] Hello.

[33:44] Thank you for the condo you create.

[33:45] My name is Monafetal.

[33:46] I'm the founder of Elfan.

[33:47] OK.

[33:48] So basically, we sell tools to creators to help them make more money.

[33:52] And we also simplify how brands collaborate with creators.

[33:54] OK.

[33:55] They say tools like software.

[33:56] So software and agency tools.

[33:59] So we have a music label, a creator agency for big creators, and then a platform as

[34:03] well.

[34:04] OK.

[34:05] So I'm coming to that just in a bit.

[34:06] I know the focus topic.

[34:08] We made around 4.3 million last year.

[34:10] And basically, my goal is to get to 100 million.

[34:13] Now the issue here is, which is split between the three interns are out of it.

[34:18] One million for the creator agency.

[34:20] 1.3 million for the music label.

[34:24] And then the rest is on the brand side.

[34:27] My issue here is that I got 40,000 creators, but only 1,000 are making money.

[34:32] And I've been kind of struggling between going on a SaaS model to be able to scale,

[34:35] because when I do any social marketing, we get a creator that comes on board, but they

[34:39] don't make money right away.

[34:41] So it's not like the longer it takes you to a group, your ad spend is not usually a good

[34:46] metric for scalability.

[34:48] So I'm kind of pivoting.

[34:49] Should I go into a SaaS model, where whatever I make from the creator, I'll just be like,

[34:54] hey, just pay me that price.

[34:55] And I think 0% from you.

[34:57] And then I just charge the brands that can mission to collaborate with those creators.

[35:01] This way I can scale the business in a much faster.

[35:04] See the last part again?

[35:06] So instead of me making percentages from creators, I provide them the same tools that a lot

[35:10] of them make money, and I keep 0%.

[35:13] OK.

[35:14] But then let's say they have to pay like 20 bucks a month.

[35:16] Sure.

[35:17] But then I still make my money on the upside on the brand side by connecting them with

[35:20] these creators.

[35:21] OK.

[35:22] So switch to a subscription.

[35:23] Switch to the subscription.

[35:24] OK.

[35:25] Um.

[35:27] Because right now, like I have 40,000 creators who signed up, but I'm really making money

[35:30] off a thousand.

[35:31] And it's free to sign up, and you only get paid if they get paid.

[35:34] Yeah.

[35:35] So you're in a prosumer audience.

[35:38] So if you look at like Shopify, for example, it's super.

[35:44] If you look at the amount of people who've tried to go to marketplaces, almost all

[35:47] of them fail.

[35:48] And it's my opinion that the best marketplaces do run a SaaS, and then once they get

[35:53] to scale, they can kind of push more marketplaces like Shopify, for example.

[35:58] Like it's $20 bucks a month or whatever it is.

[36:01] Because they know that the vast majority, like they make more money charging $29 a month,

[36:05] and getting 4% on zero for the vast majority of stores.

[36:09] But people continue to pay for the hope that someday they will make money.

[36:13] And so I think the idea of switching to SaaS is not a bad one.

[36:18] I am concerned about the four businesses that you have.

[36:23] So because in order to win at SaaS, you have to be like all in on software.

[36:30] And so the alternative to that would be instead of letting creators come on for free,

[36:36] you would charge them to come on, which you could do has like a one time setup fee, and

[36:39] then maybe increase the likelihood that they win.

[36:41] Either path would work.

[36:43] But if the ultimate goal is that you want to build a network of creators, then you want

[36:49] to have the lowest barrier possible on the creator side.

[36:52] So I'm still thinking about free tier and the paid tier with some minor benefits.

[36:56] But then if you really want to make money, you got to end up paying subscription.

[36:59] Yeah.

[37:00] Yeah, you'll have to play with the feature set because that's always a bitch.

[37:05] It's just a path of least resistance to getting to 100 million.

[37:09] Yeah, so I think adding the subscription for the base and then still maintaining the revenue

[37:15] that you get from the sponsors makes sense.

[37:17] I would maybe push back slightly on the hypothesis that they can't convert anything, because

[37:23] it dramatically decreases the value of the network from the sponsors side.

[37:29] What do you mean?

[37:30] Because some people will pay for impressions.

[37:32] And so those guys can for sure deliver those.

[37:36] And so maybe there's like two tiers that you can sell.

[37:38] You have another product on the ad side, are there on the media side?

[37:41] It's just something to consider.

[37:43] Perfect.

[37:44] Thank you.

[37:45] That's a little bit.

[37:46] Each amount did in my thoughts.

[37:47] Oh, good.

[37:48] I'm glad.

[37:49] No, I think it makes sense.

[37:50] Yeah, either after basically you have to position as higher ticket and do premium, the wake level

[37:52] morning, and then select only for the really good creators, and that would be like you charge

[37:56] five or $10,000.

[37:58] You really get them set up, or you basically flip the other way, go freemium, and then it's

[38:03] all based on basically media arbitrage for your just running tons and tons of ads to get

[38:08] people into the platform and you just know what your average revenue per platform is.

[38:11] Perfect.

[38:12] Thank you.

[38:13] So this guy obviously has multiple businesses and is, you know, sitting.

[38:16] He's doing the cardinal sin of chasing multiple rabbits, more and more particularly many

[38:20] women in the red dress.

[38:21] That being said, I still wanted to help.

[38:23] And so he wants to build a software company.

[38:25] And that's really what he wants to build, then he's got to go all in because if Sass is

[38:28] one of the most, if not the most competitive space that's out there, I guess now there's

[38:31] AI, but Sass is still competitive.

[38:34] Everybody your computer gets has is typically very well funded and also a very smart.

[38:39] And so they're going to have significant advantage.

[38:41] And so if you think that you can split your attention and still beat them, it's a toll order,

[38:45] right?

[38:46] And so for him, my whole goal was that at least he had clarity on what he needs to do so

[38:49] that hopefully he can get that business up and running as fast as possible so that he can

[38:53] basically shut off the other things and go all it.

[38:55] Hi Alex.

[38:56] Hello Alex.

[44:07] guys have for contracts and whatnot, you could absolutely go all in on that and get that to like

[44:13] 50 or 60%.

[44:14] And then you just need to have a different acquisition system.

[44:16] So you probably need to go spend money acquiring customers.

[44:20] And that already cash flows because of the education side.

[44:24] Are the people who are still paying you on the software also education customers are now?

[44:28] They usually come from the education from my legal services as well.

[44:33] So I have some clients that be 80% of the job.

[44:36] You just a million dollar question.

[44:37] The million dollar question is if they stop the education do they keep paying for the software?

[44:42] Yes, because it's our one time.

[44:43] Well then that's what you mean the software is one time?

[44:45] No, the education.

[44:46] So then they just pay and they're going to use the software.

[44:50] As long as they say the only thing they were solving for is revenue retention on the software.

[44:54] And so like enterprise into itself is not more valuable than lower market.

[44:59] It's just that tends to be stickier which is what makes it more valuable.

[45:01] But if you can get a larger marketplace, easier to a park customer to stick as well as a large enterprise customer,

[45:09] you've got a gold mine if that's true.

[45:11] And so if you want to go spend money, acquire customers with the education or media as your liquidation,

[45:16] and then get 100% like but the goal that you guys should have is like we don't care at all about the education.

[45:21] All of your focus, all the profit goes into just fixing one number which is that you need to look at M12,

[45:26] so month 12 retention and just say like okay we're at 40, how do we get to 60?

[45:31] And then how do we get to 70?

[45:33] And that's all you're solving for.

[45:34] Because if you solve that then the thing will just keep growing.

[45:37] And that's the beauty.

[45:38] I mean that's fundamentally the beauty of software once you get it right is that it just keeps growing.

[45:41] Thank you.

[45:42] Yeah.

[45:44] And so for me that was I thought the higher likelihood path and also because you already knew how to get those customers whereas getting Sony and some of these large brands could be significantly more difficult.

[45:54] And so for me I saw that was like I think that's the direction that has a higher likelihood of succeeding given their goals.

[46:00] Infinite banking.

[46:02] Yes.

[46:03] Insurance.

[46:04] You're 29 agents.

[47:14] You're.

[47:15] You're.

[47:16] You're.

[47:17] You're.

[47:18] You're.

[47:19] You're.

[47:20] You're.

[47:21] You're.

[47:22] You're.

[47:23] You're.

[47:24] You're.

[47:25] You're.

[47:26] You're.

[47:27] You're.

[47:28] You're.

[47:29] You're.

[47:30] You're.

[47:31] You're.

[47:32] You're.

[47:33] You're.

[47:34] You're.

[47:35] No, most of it's coming from for sure that and then the challenge with the agents that we originally was called me teaching people and do that had to go go out there and get business going up work.

[47:44] Go join B and I chamber of commerce.

[47:46] Yeah, that's what works for me.

[47:48] And then we get good people that were like, hey, I don't have any network.

[47:51] Yeah.

[47:52] So I said, all right, and they asked where we leads were and I said, all right.

[47:55] So let me go create leads and we started calling business owners.

[47:59] That's why I was selling to, but they were not showing up and they weren't really busy.

[48:03] So whatever we were offering wasn't whatever.

[48:05] Then I reread $100 million offers and $100 million leads.

[48:08] And I looked at the value equation.

[48:10] I said, best value I can give is to real estate investors.

[48:13] So let me go get real estate investor leads.

[48:15] And then we're calling them all day long.

[48:17] And the people that I'm hiring don't have to communicate with them properly.

[48:21] So the only they end up just setting up appointments and then they hand them back off to me.

[48:25] Okay.

[48:26] And they're good.

[48:27] But I think it comes down to recruiting people want leads.

[48:30] The first one where we're good leads.

[48:32] So if you say you have to go generate your leads, they might go look at somewhere where they give them leads.

[48:37] So we started giving people leads.

[48:39] So we make an offer to recruit.

[48:41] That's good.

[48:42] Well, I think that one is you could probably just take the existing brand that you have and just be more delivered about the call to actions that you make.

[48:50] And because like if you talk about high level insurance stuff, that's going to track both people who want to learn more about insurance.

[48:56] But many of those people will be agents.

[48:58] Yes.

[48:59] And so I think if you basically alternate the CTAs, you'll be able to basically, I don't know what's the chase to, but you know, but but in some ways you kind of can double dip here.

[49:08] Because as long as the constant strategy fundamentally doesn't really change or just changing really the calls action, then you can kind of get a little bit of the best of both.

[49:14] But I do think that the big thing that you need to crack is teaching them to generate their own.

[49:19] Okay.

[49:20] Like that is 100, like that's the limit of your business.

[49:23] Okay.

[49:24] So you need to bring them on and you need to have the training system to get to reliably get them to self-generate.

[49:28] Like that's it.

[49:29] Like that's what you have to do.

[49:30] If you do that, this Christ will have it.

[49:32] And the 20 people that we have at a 29 that are just simply coming in and cold calling real estate investors all day.

[49:38] Yeah.

[49:39] Right now that are setting up and saying them out, I think it offers not great.

[49:42] So I'm going to go to the joint with that.

[49:44] But all those people now I got to go teach them.

[49:47] Just teaching them how to cold call.

[49:49] Well they already are cold call.

[49:50] They already are cold call.

[49:51] They are cold call.

[49:52] Okay.

[49:53] Well they're coming in.

[49:54] I'm teaching them the cold call.

[49:55] That's why they're going to come in and teach them to go shake hands and kiss babies.

[49:57] You want to teach them the highest efficiency strategy for getting customers.

[50:01] So whatever that is.

[50:02] So you can just like whatever your method is that you think the highest percentage people will succeed with.

[50:06] That's what you teach.

[50:07] Cool.

[50:08] So whether it's shake hands, kiss babies or it's cold calling, whatever.

[50:11] Or it comes with those.

[50:12] Yeah.

[50:13] Or it comes with that.

[50:14] Either way it's fine.

[50:15] But like fundamentally like look at the biggest insurance companies in the entire world.

[50:18] They are that big for a reason and almost all of them.

[50:21] They are recruiting machines.

[50:23] Right.

[50:24] Like that's where fundamentally.

[50:25] Because they're not a supply constraint business.

[50:27] You can sell as much as the insurance as you want.

[50:28] Right.

[50:29] They're not supply constraint.

[50:30] Right.

[50:31] Like you're just a man constraint.

[50:32] So you just got to get guys and then put the system in place that they learn how to sell.

[50:36] And then that's the business.

[50:37] All right.

[50:38] Thank you.

[50:39] Appreciate you.

[50:40] Yeah.

[50:41] This is why there's higher leverage of him getting lead getters than him getting lead.

[50:45] So this is the lead's book 175.

[50:47] So right now he's in scenario one, which is that he is getting leads.

[50:51] Right.

[50:52] He's getting customers and he's sending those leads to his

[50:54] agents to close.

[50:55] Right.

[50:56] Look at a much higher leverage move.

[50:58] Let's go to scenario three where he spends the same amount of time advertising.

[51:02] But every time he's getting lead getters and so every month he's getting more agents into the business and each of those agents are now getting money.

[51:09] Now it's the same level of effort for him.

[51:11] Look, his line is still the same.

[51:13] He's still working the same amount every day.

[51:15] Same amount every day.

[51:16] But here he's got these new nodes that are generating business for him.

[51:20] And so if you add up all of this.

[51:22] These are all the extra customers that he's gotten just from this level of effort.

[51:27] And so this has far higher leverage than this does, which is why I recommended that he start making CTAs in his content to both continue to generate because I don't want to kill the business.

[51:37] Continue to generate his normal leads, but also make it clear for agents if they want to join him and gain access to some of the leads that he has.

[51:44] That he can come in.

[51:46] He can train that many can show them how to get the leads on their own, which he can benefit from.

[51:49] My name is Mike Nathan.

[51:51] I sell cellular therapy in home to the old affluent injured probably and athletic.

[51:59] We're new, but we've got a million dollars in revenue half an ebeta.

[52:03] We would like to get the 25 million in home or in home.

[52:08] Okay, got it.

[52:09] Consider mobile healthcare.

[52:10] Okay, is it like guy drives out or is it you sending machines?

[52:13] Our end drives out gives you an IV infusion in your home.

[52:17] Okay, got it.

[52:19] We're going to get to 25 million.

[52:20] We're built to be bought.

[52:21] We want to exit.

[52:22] So we think we're on the cutting edge of this.

[52:24] What's stopping us is my team is awesome.

[52:27] Great.

[52:28] And from the NFL, it's a lot of good.

[52:30] We have great business to doctorate.

[52:32] B.D.B. sales experience.

[52:34] Zero B.D.C. experience.

[52:37] And that playbook we're learning is wildly different.

[52:40] We have no idea what we're doing.

[52:42] Yeah.

[52:43] So what's the option from just doing way more of the doctor stuff?

[52:47] It doesn't it doesn't quite pay as well.

[52:50] Meaning we have people that not gun doors to orthopedic surgeons who are looking for patients with.

[52:56] All turned into the surgery.

[52:58] PT cover practice.

[53:00] It's a lot of effort and there's some that are going to refer to you and some that just will not.

[53:05] So that's our constraint in a one-marb in the Twin Cities.

[53:08] It's a one market play.

[53:11] We know there are more people looking for the solution.

[53:15] So we want to understand what the B to see is.

[53:18] If we go to then Dallas, Philly, LA as we try to scale it.

[53:22] Work convince the needs to be a ROI that maybe we're doing right now.

[53:26] What do you do?

[53:27] So you're big and 50% margins.

[53:29] So what's the cost to acquire a physician?

[53:32] Cost to acquire a physician.

[53:34] Who refers to business?

[53:36] Cost to acquire a failure.

[53:38] It's oftentimes just it can be a physician.

[53:40] So we don't track it that way.

[53:41] But it's five hundred dollars.

[53:43] Okay, so cost you five hundred and then what does the average physician refer to you in a year?

[53:48] In terms of business.

[53:49] Six thousand.

[53:50] Okay.

[53:51] So I'm getting 12 to one there and you already know how that works.

[53:54] So what stops you from doing 10 times more of that?

[53:57] Oh, we.

[53:58] You're saying they don't pay well, but that's the part of the shirt.

[54:00] Well, we're going to 50% more.

[54:02] One through the woods and hit all the people that are going to refer us.

[54:05] The numbers not amazing.

[54:06] Or at least I just know there's more there.

[54:08] I assume there's more.

[54:09] There's gotta be more than the, you know, the 200 people we've hit.

[54:13] Like you've, I mean, you've only really talked to 200 in terms of like reachouts and

[54:17] And you're 200 signed up as a affiliate.

[54:19] It's kind of like I don't know the number off the top of my head, but it's in, it's in the hundreds less than a thousand of.

[54:24] Be to be a PT, carer practice or the pediatric surgeons.

[54:29] We've done that in the twin city.

[54:31] And the super small people that have given us has been some give four five six.

[54:36] Some give zero.

[54:37] Yeah, do you have an active affiliate manager who's like regularly reminding them.

[54:41] Yeah, so with, so the way that I think about affiliates is it's basically a second tier of customer.

[54:47] And so you need to have somebody who's regularly kind of like stoking the affiliate fire to keep them activated and continue to get them to continue to refer business.

[54:55] So I'll give an example. So there was a roofing company for it was a restoration company.

[55:00] They had one star star salesman and all he did was he'd go around other tradesmen and get them to refer them business.

[55:07] And so they would get a thousand bucks to refer the restoration business business.

[55:12] But the sales guy got 500 for every time they referred.

[55:16] And so that guy all day long was knocking on doors, walking in the front door with donuts,

[55:21] asked them how they're doing, bringing coffee to the guys, and then reminding them that they existed and that's all he did.

[55:26] And so I think you were getting, you're doing the hardest part, which is getting them to refer.

[55:32] You just didn't have the consistent referrals because if you had 200 active affiliates who were consistently referring to business.

[55:40] And most of these physicians, you know, especially like GP, things like that, like, I mean they see thousands of patients.

[55:47] And many of them could probably benefit from the services you have.

[55:50] And so the activation is both getting them to refer consistently, but also percentage of customers that they see that they refer to you.

[55:57] So it's kind of both sides of it.

[55:59] So I think that the missing link with what you were already doing, which is that you didn't have basically the continuous affiliate marketing strategy to get them to keep sending you business.

[56:07] So that's probably like right now today.

[56:09] I would fix that first because you already have the acquisition system, you already have the network.

[56:13] And so for me, like, reactivating that affiliate base would be the first thing that I did.

[56:17] So this gentleman is using B2B outreach to get physicians and therapists to refer him business.

[56:24] Now, the part of what he was missing is if you go to 240 in the lead's book, which is the affiliates chapter.

[56:29] I talk about the launch and integrate model.

[56:33] And so basically right now he actually was missing both of those.

[56:36] So launch is like you want to do some sort of big promotion with them so that you get to all their customers.

[56:40] Now they were giving him like a trial customer and he was basically not getting any customers beyond that.

[56:45] And so if he's acquired 200 affiliates and each of them is sending him one customer,

[56:50] it's because he's basically not following up with the test that they're making.

[56:53] Like imagine if you, you know, if you have a business and you have customers, someone's taking you from a business,

[56:58] you might be like, I'll send you one and I'll see what they say, right?

[57:01] But it's a trial.

[57:03] And so basically we have to think about getting these affiliates on board is like a trial,

[57:06] but to convert the affiliate into an activated affiliate.

[57:09] Right? And so a launches step one, which is that, okay, maybe you succeed with the trial.

[57:13] And then you propose, hey, let's do some big campaign to send a lot of your customers over.

[57:17] And then you can make money, we can make money everybody's happy.

[57:20] But the long term goal is full integration, right?

[57:23] Which is at what point in your process can we integrate our business so that what you sell is merged with what we sell.

[57:29] So that we don't have to do any extra work or remind you, you just do it on your own.

[57:33] The second thing maybe, because you might just reactivate the base and all of a sudden you're like,

[57:37] I got 200 guys referring to business holy shit, right?

[57:39] 10 million.

[57:40] But the second thing I would consider probably, I would still probably focus most of my time on the B2B because you already have it.

[57:46] But for this business, I think that it lends itself for what's the price point?

[57:51] $6,000 treatment.

[57:53] Per treatment, okay.

[57:54] So the average doctor will send you $1,6,000 patient per year when you said you cost you 500,

[57:59] they'll send you one patient.

[58:01] Interesting.

[58:03] So do you have a process for once the patient get the thing calling the physician up?

[58:07] Sorry, so they're like, I'm Dr. Smith, I send you Sandy.

[58:11] Sandy goes and gets the, well, you come to Sandy and Sandy gets the treatment.

[58:14] Is there a cycle where you call back, need Dr. Smith and say, hey, we just out with Sandy, here's some of her stuff.

[58:21] Not in a medical term like we're not putting notes back in because it is private.

[58:25] For sure, yeah.

[58:26] But we do, we ask for more referrals and there's a circle back that way.

[58:29] There's not a patient loop back.

[58:33] Okay.

[58:34] That's not true.

[58:35] Sometimes that does happen.

[58:36] Excuse me, it does.

[58:37] Yeah.

[58:38] That's not systematized.

[58:39] Yeah, I would.

[58:40] Yeah, because it's like, hey, you just sent me this person.

[58:42] Like, let me close that loop for you.

[58:44] She's awesome.

[58:45] We did this thing.

[58:46] She loved it.

[58:47] By the way, and then we have the, you know, the opening to the, to the other, like, what customers are,

[58:51] customers are, sorry, what patients did you see this week?

[58:53] Who you think it would be a good fit, right?

[58:55] And rather than saying, do you have any, it's which ones would be?

[58:58] Yeah.

[58:59] Is the question?

[59:00] Small training stuff, but it matters.

[59:02] So I feel like there's so much on the B to B side that I don't see.

[59:05] I'd, that's probably where I'd be.

[59:06] So you cannot go after a B to C approach, like,

[59:08] I've been trying to get that opportunity to do that.

[59:11] It's not that I wouldn't, it's that when I think about,

[59:14] so this is a difference in, like, theoretical and actual, like, I would,

[59:19] given the fact that you're, like, you're already running good margins on this thing,

[59:23] basically doing it and take this the way I mean it, completely unoptimized, right?

[59:28] Right now, right?

[59:29] And I, again, I'm not, this is not a, a slight.

[59:32] Um, then I'm like, there's so much juice left in this thing.

[59:35] I don't want to now start something new.

[59:37] It's like, I barely got this one going.

[59:39] I want to, like, crush this.

[59:40] And when I, when I'm like, no, we, like, we follow up with every single person.

[59:43] I've got a full time affiliate manager who steps by our affiliates.

[59:46] I'm, I'm calling them plays, but drop by the docs once a week,

[59:49] just a reminder, say nice things, hey, by the way.

[59:52] Like, that is happening all the time.

[59:54] And we've already covered, like, literally every single physician in the Twin Cities.

[59:57] And I'm like, okay, let's go B to C.

[60:00] But if we haven't completely squeezed the hell out of this thing,

[60:02] and it's already working at the level it is right now,

[60:04] with, like, you're like, you're only getting one patient per doc.

[60:08] It's like, so, yeah, so you getting B to B customers.

[60:10] The same is getting one B to C customer.

[60:12] I understand why you'd be frustrated because you'd be like, well,

[60:14] fuck it, I'll just fuck it.

[60:15] I could sell one customer on my own without having to deal with the doc.

[60:18] But the whole point is that, like, I want them to be sending 20, 50 a month.

[60:22] And they can, because they have the volume.

[60:24] And I think that first one has to be, like, a beautifully choreographed experience.

[60:29] Because that first patient's the test run for them for you, right?

[60:32] They'll refer you one and they'll see what happens.

[60:35] Right?

[60:36] And so, one, it's like, Sandy's got to be blown away.

[60:38] Right? She's got to come back and be like, oh, my God, that place was amazing.

[60:41] And then you also have to go back to the doc and be like, we blew Sandy away, by the way.

[60:45] And so, I think you have to tackle it from both sides.

[60:48] Okay.

[60:49] That's what I would do.

[60:50] Getting into the ad side, you absolutely could do it.

[60:52] And I could walk through some, you know, whole strategy there.

[60:54] But I, if we swap places, that's where I would be focused on.

[60:59] We're going to try to expand into other major metros in the next 18 months.

[61:04] Would you, would you have the B to C sorted out before you went to the next market, or would you?

[61:09] Honestly, no.

[61:10] I crushed my B to B play, then I just rub my B to B play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play, play

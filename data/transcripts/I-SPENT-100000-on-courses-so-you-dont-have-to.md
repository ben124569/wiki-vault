[00:00] In this video, I'm gonna explain you exactly why the courses that you buy are not making you money and it is not for the reason that you think

[00:08] This was kind of prompted because I was tagged in something where someone was like I thought this guy sucked

[00:14] And it was because I heard some other guy talking about him and so I just immediately, you know, made a judgment and

[00:21] Now I started watching his YouTube and I wrote his book

[00:24] Everybody offers you can get for no matter how it sounds and I was like, oh this guy's pretty legit and

[00:29] And for some reason this has got me my head racing on number of different topics and I tried to write him all down on my phone

[00:35] So I could make this for you, but I'm gonna explain you why your course didn't make you money

[00:39] I'm gonna explain

[00:40] How you can try and use to get the best out of courses how you can know how to use judgment and went to apply it and finally

[00:48] I'll explain to you why Spanish is a scam all right lots of lots of packed stuff today

[00:53] First off the reason the course that you bought didn't make you money is

[00:57] Oftentimes because the thing that the course taught is not the only thing that is required to make money

[01:04] And so for example if I were to learn how to do math

[01:10] Do I need to know how to do math in order to be good at business?

[01:13] Yes, does knowing math make me good at business?

[01:16] No, it is a subset super set relationship. Do I need to know how to write copy to be good at business?

[01:23] Yes, if I only know how to write copy

[01:26] Well, I make money no

[01:28] The reality is that in order to get the first dollar across the bridge

[01:33] It's much more important to see it as a bridge from where you are and where you're trying to go and each one of the bricks

[01:38] Represents the skill that you'll need if you do not have one of the bricks

[01:42] You will not be able to continue to pass the difficulty in what most people have is that they continue to reinforce one brick

[01:48] And they still have a gap so it's like I take six different courses on copywriting

[01:53] But copywriting isn't the link that is broken in the bridge to get you from where you are to where you want to go and get that first dollar across or get the

[02:01] Increasing dollars across because if you want to think about it differently think about it like a pipe and

[02:06] Right now you've got let's say thick tubes for the vast majority of the pipe

[02:10] So you could have lots of water that's flowing here, but then you have this tiny little tube over here because it's a weakness in the system

[02:17] And it affects the overall throughput from your entire business, right?

[02:20] And you should think about business in my opinion like a pipe, right?

[02:23] You've got eyeballs over here and you've got

[02:26] Money over here, right?

[02:27] It's everything that happens from eyeballs to headlines to as the copy to click to conversions to sales to

[02:34] Upsells, et cetera all of that is just this process where eyeballs get turned into money and so if you can just shift your perspective

[02:40] From like I bought a course on copywriting or I bought a course on Facebook ads or whatever it is and I didn't make money

[02:48] It's not because the course was bad, maybe it was but that's not the point the point is that it's probably because you're missing another piece of the puzzle

[02:55] That's why it takes so long for so many people and they get into the game and they get so frustrated at the beginning

[03:00] Because everybody tells the story I bought all these courses didn't work for me

[03:03] And then I finally got this thing and then it all took off

[03:06] But many times that last course was just the last piece of a bridge that other people help you build and

[03:11] I think that if you can shift that perspective

[03:13] You'll stop a having such negative

[03:15] You know views around some of the earlier teachers in your life and then you'll also be able to just

[03:21] Spot the gap in your learning and then attack it ruthlessly and I think that's one of the things that most people don't do is

[03:27] They just start continuing to learn about the things that they enjoy rather than continuing to focus on the things that they lack

[03:33] Now sure

[03:34] Double-ning your strength from a large perspective is a very good idea

[03:37] But the business as a whole especially for solo perner

[03:41] Right or an entrepreneur who's starting out and only has a team of five maybe ten people like the business has to do all of these things

[03:47] Period so you can be

[03:49] You know skewed into certain directions you may be better at acquisition you might be better at product maybe better for film

[03:53] Whatever it is right you may be better at those things and like learning about that stuff

[03:56] But in order for the business to be successful all of these roles have to exist and even if you don't want to specialize in it

[04:01] You still need to know enough about it to be dangerous so that you can make a judgment on how good someone else is

[04:07] To make to know if they can fit in your business

[04:09] So I wanted to cover that first off the second thing is that

[04:13] For some reason and actually for some reason I'll tell you exactly with the reason this people get very upset about

[04:19] Courses they buy on the internet and yet for some reason known as upset about the fact that they took four years of Spanish and can't speak a little Spanish

[04:27] Hmm, why is that?

[04:29] Because of expectations

[04:31] It's all it is because of expectations they believe

[04:35] Maybe you believe I don't know that

[04:38] If you buy a course

[04:40] Right that immediately you should be successful and I'm gonna be here to tell you that that's not true

[04:46] And that's because if you just show up at school

[04:49] I mean shoot some people in rolling classes and never show up

[04:53] Is like if you enroll in a Spanish class and never show up is the Spanish a scam?

[04:59] Probably not do you believe that is possible that there are good students and bad students just like there are good teachers and bad teachers

[05:05] Do you think it's possible that half of students or below average half of the people watching this might people leverage?

[05:12] Interesting and so if half the people that take an educational course or below average

[05:17] Then it would be reasonable that half the people take a course we get bad results now a good teacher can shift that percentage

[05:24] And but the thing is is what ends up happening is it's a bell curve

[05:27] Right and this is studied a zillion times over classes and humans exist in a bell curve and so a good teacher can move the bell curve

[05:35] One direction or other but they're still gonna be the outliers on the front and the outliers on the back

[05:38] And so the reason that people get upset is because of the expectations they cast upon what they believe they're going to get

[05:44] I think part of that's a phone of the marketing and the sales process, et cetera

[05:47] And they'll give you wrong. I think there's definitely things that could be improved there

[05:49] but I think that you can try and wish and cast stones on those people

[05:55] Or you can just understand going into it that there's a responsibility that you would have as a student just like if you want to college to do a certain amount of stuff

[06:02] And the reason that I'm bringing this up is because I genuinely am super passionate about education in general over half the companies are

[06:09] Profolio our education in training companies. I believe in vocational type

[06:13] Training stuff which is why you know our gym company is basically how to run a gym right and

[06:18] You know companies that I like are like niche expertise type things like how to run an auto shop

[06:22] How to run a plumbing business like because that stuff doesn't get taught anywhere when I look at the educational system is a whole

[06:27] I think almost everybody watching this

[06:29] Social figure in my channel we can agree that the education system as a whole has failed us, you know learning about

[06:34] Astaclitature

[06:35] Probably isn't going to serve us in the real world and so I think that the reason that all of that e-learning is booming is because

[06:42] Education is failed to keep up with the times and it's wildly overpriced the value to price proposition is one of the most

[06:49] Lafable in the entire world. They seldom an entire generation with debt and no way to repat it

[06:53] You get to the end of four years or a hundred thousand dollars in debt and and you have literally no more skills

[06:58] That will qualify you for a job you can get the same jobs before and after four year to great

[07:03] It's nuts and so the reason that you know acquisition not come exists for us is so that we can

[07:08] Hopefully you know my goal is to is to build the new world of education

[07:12] Which is how people can actually get skills that can feed themselves

[07:15] And it was because I went to some of you as many of them

[07:18] Me not know this but I went to Vanderbilt. I graduated medical body in three years

[07:21] So I was a good student. I don't have the typical entrepreneurial journey of like teachers never understood me and like I

[07:27] I was messed around and can pay attention like I didn't have that like I worked really hard and I got good grades and

[07:34] Despite that

[07:35] Nothing that I learned at Vanderbilt at all in any class was more valuable than any course

[07:42] I've ever bought in eLearning. They don't crazy that is

[07:46] Like I've bought courses on freaking everything

[07:49] I bought courses on YouTube

[07:50] That bought all courses on on cooperating

[07:52] Both courses on sales are both multiple courses on sales

[07:55] I bought I mean everything you can possibly imagine about mentors to our workshops about seminars all of these things

[08:00] If you were to spend the same $100,000 that you'd spend on a four year degree

[08:03] Versus spending a hundred thousand dollars on the in the eLearning community on the on the most vetted courses and

[08:08] To go through them and give yourself four years to be successful if you compare the two people

[08:13] It's apples and oranges

[08:14] It's not even close in terms of income generation that they get in that same comparison

[08:18] Which is why I'm so pro eLearning in general

[08:21] I wanted to hit on this because I think it's so important and this is why people get upset and they buy one course

[08:26] And they think I didn't make a million dollars and therefore all eLearning is bad which is just like

[08:31] Such a poisonous thought that I just hope that if you're watching this you don't feel that way because you will like

[08:36] The moment you decide you don't want to learn in an in online. It's the new world

[08:40] You don't even like I don't even know it to say like it's it's the new world and I make this channel so that anybody who

[08:45] Who who doesn't want to spend any money? You can have access to everything

[08:48] I've courses for free at acquisition.com

[08:51] I'm publishing 10 books and I'm giving them away at 99 cents because I can't give them cheap on our Amazon

[08:56] So that everyone can happily I made these as textbooks

[08:59] So that you can actually know like this is this is how you make it offer right and this is how you can start your business

[09:05] And start selling stuff anyways not not to go more into that but one

[09:08] You're courses making money because it's probably not the weak link in your chain number two

[09:13] You're probably a set about it because the expectations that you had was that if I buy this thing

[09:17] I will make lots of money and that's partially one of the marketing of the people who are selling the course

[09:20] So I'll agree with you there

[09:21] But overall if you remove that expectation

[09:24] There's lots of good stuff defining courses and I've and I've learned

[09:27] Basically everything I know from courses and application one thing that I think is important is

[09:32] That if you were in a service business right or you were somebody who's trying to learn a skill

[09:36] Like I said earlier you have to come a certain percentage the teachers to come a certain percentage and the better the teacher

[09:41] The less skill the student needs to be but at the end of the day if I take a course or I go into a workshop

[09:47] Or I take you know whatever I know because if I am that I am going to get a return on my money because I will find something to learn

[09:55] I've learned from bad courses

[09:58] Because I'm like these are things that I'm not gonna do when I build my course and that has been valuable to me

[10:03] And so a lot of people just create themselves as victim and continue to play this story

[10:07] Like woe is me and you just gotta get over because no one cares no one's gonna help you like only you

[10:12] We're gonna help you and if you keep telling yourself the story it's gonna it's gonna kill you. Let me give you a fun example

[10:16] If you've ever been to Derrick Queen and

[10:19] I have which is delicious by the way for some reason. Let's say the girl at the front when she flips the thing flips your flips your dear queen

[10:27] Shake right the ice cream falls out because she does it bad right whatever

[10:33] Do you then all of a sudden say screw you Warren Buffett and your terrible business one star?

[10:39] What do you think it's possible that that employee is new the last piece that I want to say is um around judging others and

[10:47] It was kind of what I started with this thing was

[10:49] one of the guys who posted this thing said that

[10:52] Someone else had told him bad stuff about me. This is a rule

[10:56] So I'll try and share as many of the algorithms that that laylin I have developed in terms of making decisions

[11:00] Which is we try and make if they end statements that we don't have to repeat decision making processes

[11:05] Because it's a lot of attention and time and energy to make decisions and so if you've made one

[11:10] Then just boom that is an algorithm that if this than that and then you don't have to make it again

[11:14] And so it just makes your day faster and easier because you don't have any emotional effort

[11:19] So I'll give you one of our money ones which is no diligence no deal

[11:22] Really simple right and if we don't both agree

[11:25] We don't move forward so there there are simple things that we've done over time to just simplify our decision making process

[11:31] And so decision making algorithm on a give you a run people that I have is that if I don't know someone first hand

[11:37] I'll make a judgment right and

[11:40] Let me tell you a couple reasons why because there's there's a couple variables that I think are worth exploring the first is that

[11:45] Who here has thoughts in themselves when I look back on my own past I was an idiot?

[11:50] I do all the time every day right and sometimes today

[11:55] I think guesthouse needed it

[11:57] And so if you think back to your past you're like man that guy was an idiot, right?

[12:00] You're so arrogant you thought he knew so much

[12:02] How can I then assume that right now 10 years from now not gonna look at who I am now and think the same way and so I question

[12:08] Meas judgment from five years ago. I'm like man the perspective which you saw the world was ridiculous first off me

[12:14] Just me trying to just deal with my own variable of my own judgment is

[12:19] Shaky at best right and so if I'm looking at someone I barely will cast the judgment because I

[12:25] Am an idiot half the time and I know this because of how I know what I was 10 years ago and hopefully 10 years from now

[12:31] I'll feel the same way now now that's variable number one

[12:34] Variable number two is that the person that you were listening to

[12:37] Also isn't he to you now compared to who they're going to be and

[12:41] They probably might be in a certain mood or they might have certain views about the world that are

[12:47] Contrary to what I just brought up earlier and so they're like if I buy something it should immediately work now as

[12:53] Business owners we want to take complete responsibility for that absolutely hundred percent bar none like our goal

[12:58] Always should be a hundred percent of people who do business with me get value and access to what they paid so much

[13:05] So that they want to tell their friends right that is always the goal and that is always the ideal that we have to charge

[13:09] Mine because us blaming our customers is the stupidest possibly the stupidest thing you can ever do because it does not improve your business at all

[13:16] You get you get no benefit from blaming your customers

[13:19] But as a customer

[13:21] You have to understand because if you're a winner

[13:24] You'll notice that winners are just taking responsibility for both sides of the equation right and so if that person

[13:30] Right that that you're getting the judgment from isn't a winner and they have stories that they tell themselves and

[13:35] They might be an idiot now compared to who they're going to be in in X amount of years that if they tell you so and so

[13:41] How many times you earn here's there's two sides to a story the more you get around the business game right like

[13:46] There's always going to be another side of the story and so I would have judgments that I would

[13:51] Cast on people earlier on that prevented me from doing deals with people that I now know and I was like

[13:56] I can't believe I didn't have this person my life for five years because of some post I saw it was so ridiculous

[14:02] I give this post more power than my own ability to make judgments as on another person

[14:07] I guess the moral of the story is if I'm not close enough to know someone and actually have conversed with them

[14:12] Then I'm not going to cast a judgment you know the amount of people who who who go nuts on the fact that I I paid grant 30 grand for an hour

[14:19] By the way, I paid 120 grand for four hours. It was actually what it was and that was just the first hour

[14:23] But so if anyone wants to go even more nuts about it

[14:25] But the point is is that like everyone there most people I would bet have never actually met Grant

[14:31] And so they cast judgment without knowing who he is and I think that even if you don't like someone

[14:38] And I'm not saying that Grant is

[14:41] Perfect or by any stretch of the imagination my god the man has demons so do I you miss all of the gold that people can provide you in your life

[14:49] By writing off an entire person I think people are made up of lots of things or complex being sometimes you have good days

[14:55] Sometimes you have bad days and if someone meets you on your bad days

[14:59] You're like oh, I was having a bad day, but that's just the judgment that they have

[15:03] Hopefully you're getting the idea here that there's so many variables that it makes it virtually impossible to cast judgment on someone

[15:10] Unless you have some sort of direct relationship with them and even then 10 years from now

[15:15] You're gonna think you're a moron right now. Hopefully if you grow and so

[15:19] I take 19 grains of salt. I take pounds of salt with everyone of the judgments that I have and I just try and think to myself like

[15:26] Is what I am getting from this person valuable is there something that I can learn of this person rather than this person is good or bad

[15:32] And I think that a lot of times we like to create binary judgments this person is good this person is bad rather than the fact that people exist on multiple

[15:39] Continuums this was a

[15:42] Hopefully a perspective shifting video that I was inspired to make because of the pose that I was to act in

[15:46] I just hope that everyone could take a quick second before you know if you if you buy something

[15:51] Buy it and understand that it probably won't be the one link that you're missing if it is

[15:56] Then that's the thing that creates this crazy breakthrough

[15:58] But oftentimes it's just one of the many bricks that has to be built on the way to where you're trying to go and

[16:03] Understanding that we're responsible and that that teachers and students have a heavy

[16:07] Two-sided relationship the better to the teacher the less bad the student is but half a people or below average

[16:13] Right and like I said half the people listen to this or blah average something about that for a second and then when we cast judgment

[16:18] Another people is it really worthwhile or is it maybe more useful to say I hate this person

[16:24] But they're better than me in these ways and I can learn of them from them

[16:28] And so that has been some of the some of the useful shifts that I've had as an entrepreneur

[16:32] That have provided a tremendous amount of value to me in my life and have helped me move past things

[16:38] Both emotionally

[16:39] Where I didn't get you know in ideal experience instead of holding onto this poison

[16:43] Just letting it go because and now this point

[16:46] I don't even really experience the poison because I just don't have the expectation

[16:49] And so I think that the more where we can become this is just me talking the more where I can become a my own expectations

[16:55] The more honestly the happier I am in life because I don't really create a lot of room for myself to get let down

[17:01] Because I'm not expecting anything it leaves room to be pleasantly surprised

[17:04] So anyways if this provided value to you if this video is a pleasant surprise hopefully or shifted some perspectives

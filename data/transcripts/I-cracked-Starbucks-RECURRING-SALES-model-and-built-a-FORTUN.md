[00:00] I'm one of the go my wife and I sold our eight figure software company and that deal closed 30 days ago.

[00:06] And so what I wanted to share with you was one of the biggest and much profound takeaways that I had from selling that business

[00:13] and what we look at when we're buying our own companies.

[00:18] If you guys don't know my am, I'm Alex from IzzyOenacquisition.com or my wife and I own acquisition.com.

[00:22] Our portfolio does about $85 million in revenue.

[00:25] So what I want to talk about today is one of the things that took me way too long to realize in looking at creating products

[00:32] and ultimately buying and selling businesses that are valuable.

[00:36] The biggest piece or biggest takeaway that I've had in creating quote fortunes is understanding one concept.

[00:43] It's so simple to understand and so hard to do.

[00:47] The key, the one way direction to creating a fortune through business is to only self things that

[00:55] people do not stop buying.

[00:58] I'll say it again.

[00:59] The way to create a fortune in business is to only sell things that people do not stop buying.

[01:06] Some of you probably drink Starbucks.

[01:08] You probably will not stop drinking Starbucks.

[01:10] Some of you drink Coca-Cola and will probably not stop drinking Coca-Cola.

[01:14] Some of you buy Apple and will probably not stop buying Apple.

[01:17] Right? Some of you watch Netflix and will probably never stop watching Netflix provided.

[01:21] They just continue to do what they're currently doing.

[01:24] The thing that is disheartening, right?

[01:26] I'll say this because I think it's just like these are the obvious things that are so obvious

[01:30] known as them. Simple scales fancy fails.

[01:33] Our repeats successful actions do the boring work.

[01:35] These are saying we have in our community because most of the success that I've had with business

[01:40] has not been from curing cancer or inventing a new technology, but improving something to the

[01:45] point that people want to continue to buy it and continue to pay for it.

[01:48] Right now, this is the thought experiment that if you were a small business owner,

[01:53] I would like you to do. If you were to write down the total number of people that you have ever sold

[02:00] ever all time and you were to tally that number up and then you were to multiply that

[02:06] by your current average monthly price.

[02:10] How much money would that be? Probably a lot.

[02:14] Maybe a lot more than you currently are making.

[02:16] The next thing to do is if that is the amount of money that you were making,

[02:21] how much money would you have available for you to spend in acquiring your customers?

[02:25] Probably a lot. How convicted would you be if every customer you sold you know you would not lose?

[02:32] Probably very.

[02:34] And so I think rather than thinking about all of the many tactics and there are lots of them

[02:40] of making more money. How do I get more leads? How do I optimize my pricing?

[02:44] How do I sell a higher percentage? All of that stuff, right?

[02:47] Those are a lot of the hand-to-hand combat and I don't want to be mistaken here. Like,

[02:51] you can become a millionaire just learning to be okay at those things. Right? If you just learn how to

[02:56] market in sell, you'll be able to make money. You won't be able to build a fortune, but you will

[03:01] be able to make money. The thing is is that if you can optimize around the single question, which is,

[03:08] what is something that I can sell that people will never stop buying it after they start?

[03:12] And how do I structure the thing in such a way that the value they're getting is so far in

[03:17] access to what they're paying me that they never want to leave, that they call me when they're

[03:21] credit card goes down to make sure that they continue to stay in pay. So right now many of you

[03:26] probably with your Wi-Fi, right? If your Wi-Fi went out because your card didn't go through,

[03:31] you would probably immediately update your card and get the Wi-Fi back up. If your phone service

[03:35] went down, you would immediately update your card and get it back going. If your Netflix got canceled,

[03:40] you do the same thing. Right? And that is because we value those services far in access of the price.

[03:46] There's what is called a customer surplus, which means you are getting far more than what you pay for.

[03:51] And so you feel like you're not only getting a good deal, you're getting a crazy deal,

[03:55] and so you never want to stop buying it because the value exchange is so far in your favorite.

[03:59] And so when I am now looking at businesses, I am seeing what the overall opportunity is that we're

[04:06] pursuing and what the main value proposition is. And I am thinking to myself, so I'm just giving you

[04:10] the mental frameworks that I'm working with, which is how can I turn this thing that is valuable

[04:15] into something that someone will never want to stop buying? All right? So there's a couple of frameworks

[04:20] that I will walk you through. This is probably the most, this is for B2B scenario, but you can

[04:25] probably apply to anything. Many times, there are especially like the E-learning space. People will

[04:30] sell a method, which I think, by the way, is silly because people will never stop. They will

[04:35] definitely buy the method and they never need the method, right? Which is why I prefer models to

[04:40] methods. But a model can have lots of methods that feed into it, but a method can only, it's like a

[04:45] one, one and done, right? And so ideally you want to transition your business from a method selling

[04:50] business to a model selling business because then you will have a model that can always evolve

[04:54] over time. Franchise is some models and the marketing will change. It was Groupon that it was email.

[05:00] It was Facebook ads and Instagram ads and YouTube ads and all the things that have happened since,

[05:04] right, media will change, but the model remained the same. And so if the model is something that

[05:08] someone used to continue to have, then that's something that they will not get rid of, right?

[05:11] Now in the Netflix video that I made like how I crack recurring revenue, there's eight

[05:15] seas that I look at to make something stick. All of those things will increase the stick. But the

[05:19] biggest one, by far, is the simple customer surplus, the value discrepancy and what you sell,

[05:25] sorry, what you deliver in the price that you charge for, right? And most people try and cut their

[05:29] prices in order to get there. When in reality, we should be increasing the value. So that rather

[05:34] like you can create a customer surplus by lowering the price so much. The thing is, is there

[05:37] not a lot of profit left over, anyone have a big business. And so unless you have something that

[05:40] causes $0 to reproduce, you know, like, drop box, right, virtually $0 to reproduce more storage.

[05:49] Then it's very difficult to do something like that, right? The idea, if you want to create a fortune,

[05:54] is to think consistently, how can I make this so that no one stops buying? And in the software

[06:00] world, which I highly recommend you look at all the writers for business in software because

[06:06] software is software as a service, right? SaaS, right? Now that means that all the metrics and all

[06:11] the things that they have quantitatively been able to measure in software as a service, 100% applies

[06:15] to service because it's just software doing the job that services supposed to be doing. And so

[06:19] if we can do that, right, if we can, if we can quantitative in this way, quantify in this way,

[06:24] then this is the, this is the three step process that they go through when they're trying to

[06:27] create a billion dollar unicorn company. All right, and I got this from Mark Rebehrs,

[06:31] who was the one of the, one of the early guys in, in Hubsbyp, right? I think he took them from zero to

[06:36] 100 million and now he's a lecturer at Harvard, all right? This is the process that they go through.

[06:40] The first step is is is getting enough promotion so that you can get customers, all right? He said

[06:47] we're not worried about pricing, we're not worried about value. We needed to be priced high enough

[06:52] that people will care, but not so high that we're trying to maximize profit because that's not the

[06:56] goal of this period of time, all right? Now this unfortunately is where most of the internet marketing

[07:01] community stops. They learn how to promote and they think that that's how they're going to make money,

[07:05] but that's not, you'll make some money, but you won't build a fortune that way, right? So the

[07:10] promotion period is simply to get customers, all right? You make sales to get customers. You're not

[07:15] getting, making customers to get sales, all right? Very important distinction. And so when we do that,

[07:20] the idea is that we're, we're continually testing the product until we get to the point where people

[07:25] don't leave. And in theory, we should never really leave here until we have figured this piece out.

[07:32] Once we have figured this piece out, then we can start scaling it, right? And so if you're thinking

[07:37] about this in sequence, it's promotion, which is usually zero to a million, product, which is one to

[07:43] ten million, which is where you're optimizing your product so that people never want to leave,

[07:47] they never want to stop buying. And then once you have something where the product is such that

[07:52] people don't stop buying, all of your marketing efforts in and of themselves will start compounding

[07:56] because people won't leave. And so it's just like you've got this glue and you're blowing all this

[08:00] traffic at this glue and it just sticks and it just keeps. And if you never lose a customer,

[08:05] you will literally never stop making more money year over year. Think about that, just like

[08:10] hypothetical, just think about that for a second. You will never stop making money,

[08:14] you will never stop making more money year over year if you never lose a customer. And I think that

[08:19] it's just such a profound ideology shift. It's so easy to say and so hard to do, which is why most

[08:24] people don't want to do it. But if you're part of a donation and you like doing the

[08:27] boring work, you like doing the things that other people are not willing to do, then these are

[08:31] the things, these are the keys to the kingdom. It's creating things that people will never stop buying.

[08:36] And that means that you're interviewing customers. It means you're surveying them. It means you're

[08:40] looking at usage patterns, you're looking at the things that they're consuming, you're looking at

[08:44] how you can increase the collateral within your community so that people don't want to leave.

[08:49] And we do these things over and over and over again until we get to the point, we're at 1%

[08:55] 2% monthly turn. At most, rather than 10% or 20% which is what most people have. And if that sounds

[09:03] hard, of course it is. But the thing is, is that I guarantee you that no one else is doing it.

[09:07] Everyone's obsessing about their stripy count screenshots. But the thing is is that the fortunes

[09:12] are not even made in the follow up. The fortunes are made to never losing customers. Because then

[09:16] you have time on your side because then over a long enough time horizon, even if you suck at

[09:20] marketing, people will find out about your product. Over a long enough time horizon. And if you have

[09:25] a product that people never stop using, you will be able to make a tremendous amount of money

[09:30] because in 20 years, if you were to think about whatever amount of sales you have right now is

[09:35] a small business owner. You might have been doing this for three years or five years. Whatever it is.

[09:39] Right? If you were to multiply this in your 20 years into your career, you've actually been doing

[09:43] the same thing. One, it would be far more likely that you'd have something that you would have figured

[09:46] out how to make the product so good that people wouldn't leave. But also, 20 years from now,

[09:51] you'd have so many customers even if you weren't that good at promotion that your business would be

[09:56] gigantic. And so I think I've told the story before, but I had a consulting engagement that I did

[10:02] a years ago where somebody was selling the exact same amount of clients as I was. And they were

[10:06] making 300,000 a month and we were doing 4,000 a month. And I think I had 100 times the profit

[10:12] of their company. And it wasn't because they were like, we were selling the same amount of customers.

[10:16] It was just that we had such a better amount of situation. If you were such a better product,

[10:19] we were able to deliver so much more value that we were able to grow to with much bigger size.

[10:24] Like, if you sell 100 clients a month, be to be, you should be able to build that into a $100

[10:28] million enterprise. You have the sales velocity. And so then it's just simply, and I know that's

[10:33] like, well, what about pricing? Over a long enough time horizon, you should still probably, if you're

[10:36] be to be, you'll probably be in a price point where you would get there. If, here's the big

[10:40] you don't lose customers. And so I think the vast majority, if there's one message from this video,

[10:44] it's, what can we look at or reimagine within our customer experience and the product that we

[10:48] deliver that will deliver outsize returns with that we have a customer surplus, which means the amount

[10:52] of value provide is far and excess to the price that we charge. And that doesn't matter what the price

[10:57] is. So when someone says, I charge high ticket, I think it's a silly, silly concept altogether,

[11:01] right, because it really should just be high value. That's the real concept, which is high value.

[11:06] All right, because what is expensive? If I said, hey, I'll give you my, you know, my lambo for 20

[11:11] grand, is that a good deal? Absolutely, right, prices what you pay values, what you get in that

[11:16] discrepancy is going to be the customer surplus. And so right now, if I said that to this channel,

[11:20] hey, and the first person who wires me 20 grand, right, gets the lambo, a lot of people would probably

[11:25] wire me 20 grand, right, because the value is clear to understand. If I was selling a house and I said,

[11:30] hey, give me, you know, it's a $500,000 house, give it you for 50 grand. It's a great deal.

[11:34] Most people would make that offer. And so the thing is is that that is what the business, like that

[11:39] is, reforchens are built, is finding a way to build a house for less than $50,000, to build a $500,000 house.

[11:46] Build it for $10,000, build it for $5,000 and sell it for $50,000. That's the game that we're trying to play.

[11:53] That is, reforchens are made, that is, reforchens are founded, that is where you sell things that people

[11:58] will never stop buying. And that is the real key to making more wealth and more money than you know what to do with.

[12:03] And the reality is, it's very simple to say, and very hard to do. And that's why most people

[12:08] will never be wealthy. But you are part of Mosian Nation, and you are not going to be one of those people,

[12:13] because we do the boring work. We do the things that people are not willing to do so that we can have

[12:16] success that they have never dreamed of. So anyways, keeping awesome. If you enjoyed this, my name is

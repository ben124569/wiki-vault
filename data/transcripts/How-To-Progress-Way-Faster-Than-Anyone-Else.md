[00:00] If you feel like you're not making progress, this might be why.

[00:03] In my earlier part of my career, I read a ton of self-help books,

[00:06] everything I get my hands on, but I realize my life didn't change.

[00:08] And so this video is about why that might be the case,

[00:12] and more importantly, what you can do about it.

[00:13] If you think about climbing a mountain, a lot of people think that there's like,

[00:17] what is the perfect path of the mountain?

[00:19] But in my experience, there's usually multiple paths of the mountain

[00:23] that you can take. But none of the paths will work if you are constantly trying to jump

[00:28] from path to path, because in the real world, one path might be direct and might be steeper.

[00:33] Another path might have more loops.

[00:36] Now, you might see the other path and think, man, that was not a steep,

[00:39] but we don't see about the path until you get on it, is that, oh man,

[00:42] this one's actually going to take me way longer to get up the mountain.

[00:45] And so most of the time, we need perfect conviction about our plan,

[00:50] more than we need a perfect plan. And so think of the paths of the mountain as your strategy.

[00:55] Like, the mission is getting to the top. That's what we want to do.

[00:57] But the strategy is how we're going to prioritize our resources to getting there.

[01:00] Right? And so your ability to execute on the path, walk the path, stick to the path,

[01:05] is ultimately the thing that's going to predicate your success far more than the path itself.

[01:10] Provided, it's sensible. And what I found in my experience is that most people actually have a

[01:14] pretty decent idea what to do. I'll give you a different analogy. So, if I said, hey, you need to get

[01:17] in shape. If you know nothing about getting in shape, you still probably have an idea that you should

[01:22] probably stop eating crap and you should start moving more. And if you're trying to get in

[01:26] muscle, you should probably like lift weights. And if you want to get bigger, you should probably

[01:30] make those weights or those reps go up. These are probably things that you'd be like, I kind of

[01:34] already knew that. But the thing is, is that people don't do that. And so the issue usually is like,

[01:38] I want to have this perfect plan. But like, if you just did only that for the next three years,

[01:42] you'd probably be way better off than the vast majority of people. And so this is a big realization

[01:46] that I had, which I had this, this over analysis of like, what is the perfect plan? And I call it

[01:51] the fallacy of the perfect pick, which is that we wait and we wait to try and find the perfect

[01:56] pattern thing. This is a five-millimeter, all your business owners. So this has nothing to do with

[01:59] where you're at. This happens at all levels, right? The mountain just gets bigger. But it's the same

[02:03] concept. And so for me, there was a period of my life before I started making a more money,

[02:10] where I had nine different businesses, all right? And I had nine businesses that I was CEO,

[02:15] and I wasn't making any money. Now, we're making revenue, but because I was so spread

[02:18] thing, I couldn't focus on any of them enough. And so all I could do is just barely keep my head

[02:23] above water. I had, you know, a dental agency had a car park to get to see I had my launch business,

[02:27] where I was flying out. So it was in different cities every week doing these launches. And then I also

[02:32] had six locations of gyms that were running too. So I was so spread thing. I'll stress out of my mind.

[02:38] And so most people can't execute. And so what I would think at that moment in time, like now looking

[02:44] back, it's obvious. And maybe you hearing it's obvious. But for some reason, it's certainly the

[02:48] where your nose is an inch above your mouth. But you need somebody else to tell your breath

[02:51] to brush my mouth. I think it's the same thing with this, which is that at the time, if you, if I had

[02:56] asked younger me, what do you think the problem is? I think I need to change my strategy. I think

[02:59] to change all these things up. When around is the most times you don't need to change that much at

[03:02] all, you need to actually just do the one thing really well. And so it's not about coming up with

[03:07] the plan or doing the plan. It's sticking with the plan, right? You can beat most people at anything

[03:13] if you just stick with it for a year. If you're willing to suck at something for a hundred days

[03:18] in a row, then you could be most people at most things. The bar for excellence has never been so

[03:23] up. And so most of your competition quits after the first sign of difficulty, the first

[03:28] in-pass in the mountain where they don't immediately get it because they've never known what

[03:32] hard feels like. And so you having to figure something out, the unknown is the hard part.

[03:39] The figuring it out is the hard part. And so people think that oh, I should switch paths because I

[03:43] understand the path of getting here. So you might get this far up the mountain and you might be on

[03:48] this path and think, oh, I could do this path or this path or this path. The thing is,

[03:51] is usually you have to go back down and then you got to go over and you go go up again. Right?

[03:55] So it's actually a lot longer to keep switching paths. But we don't think that because this path we

[04:00] can see. We already walked down here. We already see the bottom of the mountain. We could see the path

[04:04] to here. But then from here, we get stuck again. And so we keep, you know, re leveling up and going

[04:09] from you level one to level two level three really quickly because we beaten those bosses before.

[04:13] But then you get to level four again and you're stuck. And so you have to grit through that period

[04:17] where you don't know what you're doing. And this took me so long to understand like the not knowing

[04:21] part is the part that's hard and that is where people give up. It's not usually the, the like

[04:26] watch the or work harder. Sure, there's some people who are weak and they just lose there. But most

[04:30] of the time when I talk to business owners, that's not actually where they lose. It's because

[04:33] they don't know what to do. And so they think, oh, I'll change more strategy. Rather than figuring

[04:38] out what to do is the strategy. And so most strategies do work. So I want to hit on this a little

[04:43] harder. One of the misconceptions about businesses that there's this one secret thing. Right?

[04:46] There's usually lots of ways to win. There's a few ways to skin a cat, right? If you have a

[04:52] dull knife on the other hand, you're never going to be able to skin the cat. And the sharpness of

[04:57] your knife is your ability to execute whatever path you have. Right? Whatever way of skin and

[05:00] cat, which is actually pretty visceral and nasty. Like who's actually skinning cats? Probably retire

[05:05] that saying. Let me think about a skinned cat. It's built off. Anyways, when I was talking back

[05:09] to the business owner, I said, okay, so with execution is the issue. What's the, that's the,

[05:13] okay, that's the surface solve problem. You're not doing what you know you should do. The underneath

[05:16] of that is why is this not happening? And so I see this is a combination of two different things.

[05:21] And so one is culture and the other is talent. So I'm going to explain both in a more operationalized

[05:26] manner. So it's not just these buzzwords. All right. So what is culture? So culture is the rules of

[05:31] reinforcement and a business. Okay? So what are the things that govern what gets rewarded and what gets

[05:36] punished? And so if you think about culture, there's probably a hundred or a thousand behaviors

[05:40] that exist within any business or any environment. Right? When we learn a culture as a society,

[05:45] there are things that we do. You hold a door. That's one thing that you do. And it gets rewarded.

[05:49] And if you don't do it, it gets punished. Right? If you cut somebody off in traffic, it gets punished.

[05:53] Right? And so each of these things are things that get rewarded or punished. And that's what creates

[05:56] culture. But within every business, there's kind of a sub culture within the larger culture.

[06:00] We have more and more nuanced if things that are your preferences is a business owner. But if people

[06:04] are not working to your preferences, that means the culture you have the rules that govern reinforcement

[06:08] are not being adequately exercised. And the way that you reinforce culture is one,

[06:15] who you hire and who you fire. So who you will allow to exist in the business tells more to your

[06:23] team about what you think is acceptable. Number two is the behavior that you do not allow to change.

[06:30] So if someone does something good and you don't reward it, then they learn that they don't

[06:33] get rewarded for doing that thing. On the flip side, if someone shows up five minutes later,

[06:37] meeting and no one says anything, then you teach everyone it's okay to be late. And so the first

[06:43] issue with his business was that there's probably a culture of non-performance. And we have to get

[06:48] very specific with what makes somebody not perform. And sometimes it's only two or three behaviors,

[06:52] oftentimes it's like 20 or 30. And you have to be able to observe what are the things that makes me

[06:57] not like my team. And what would I rather than do instead? And so I use the format of start,

[07:04] stop, keep. So what I want you to start doing that you're not doing, what I want you to stop

[07:10] doing that you are doing. And what do you need to keep doing that I'm going to keep reinforcing?

[07:13] It's a very simple way to give feedback that I really like. Now what about talent? Because that's

[07:18] the second half this. One is the quote is the rules, right? The talent is the people who are actually

[07:22] doing the behaviors, doing the stuff. And so from a talent perspective, a lot of businesses can't

[07:27] expand anymore, not because they don't have the model to do it, but they don't have the ability to

[07:33] execute on the plan. And the ability to actually don't the plan comes down to the quality of the

[07:37] people that you have in the business. And I can tell you this firsthand, you probably don't have

[07:42] high enough bar for who should be working for you. And I say this for myself too. The moment I

[07:47] increase the quality of the people who work with me, the more money I make. Right? And so it was

[07:52] really interesting is that I think that this is one of the greatest arbitrage opportunities that

[07:54] exist in business to this day still, which is that the 50% mark for a role is $75,000 a year. Now for

[08:01] you to pay 90th percentile, it might be $115,000 per year. Right? Now you might be like, wow, that's a

[08:07] big difference. But here's the thing, is that this person is probably like five times more effective

[08:12] than this one, but they only cost 30% more. That's a great deal. That's a good investment. And so at this

[08:19] point, all I really try and do is just find rainmakers. I want people who are exceptional, who are

[08:23] obsessed with this task. Now, how do you differentiate the people who are good versus not? I'll give you

[08:28] tactical on this. So when you're interviewing, I like to know what someone's doing in their

[08:31] off time. And if what they do in their off time is not what I want them to do in their full time,

[08:36] then they're not going to be full time. Right? They're going to be always moonlighting to their

[08:39] other thing. And so I'd rather say like, what do you obsess with? And I like asking that question,

[08:43] what are your extra curricular activities? Now, if they're like, honestly, all I do, let's say I'm

[08:48] hiring a video. I prefer like all I do is videos stuff. Like, this is what I'm really passionate about.

[08:51] This is what I spend my time watching on YouTube is like, how do I, and we're the lighting, how do I

[08:54] improve the audio, how do I improve the sets? Like, this is the stuff that I like really

[08:57] obsessed about. I probably know that that person's going to do a pretty good job because also

[09:00] if I tell them, hey, you need to improve this stuff. They're like, great. I love this feedback. I want

[09:04] to get better. Now, if somebody's like, oh, I love, you know, a pickleball and use it, you know,

[09:08] and working out, there's nothing wrong with that. It's just that is that the thing that you're

[09:12] obsessed with. And so, asking that question in a couple of ways in an interview will tease out

[09:16] whether someone's been there discretionary effort in time on the talent or the skill that they

[09:21] need to win in their role in the business. And so, that's on the pick side, right? The third

[09:27] element of this, uh, here we go, is training. So, if you have rules that govern the reinforcement

[09:33] of the business, okay, this is what we like, this is what we don't like. And then you get really

[09:35] good people in. You still can have people with potential versus actual. And so, obviously, the

[09:40] higher up in the business, the more you're hiring for actual, the less you're hiring for potential,

[09:44] the lower someone is in the business, the more you're hiring for potential, and less for actual.

[09:47] And so, when we're picking somebody, it's like, I'll pick somebody who's just generally intelligent

[09:51] and has work ethic over somebody who might be more experienced in the career, but doesn't demonstrate

[09:57] the same level of intelligence. Because I think the smart person will be able to catch up to that

[09:59] dumber person really quickly and then pass them. And so, what is training look like? And so,

[10:04] training in the business in order to execute, it'll be really clear here. The reason that your

[10:08] plan isn't working is because no one's doing the plan. So, why are they doing the plan? These are

[10:12] the reasons. And so, from a training perspective, it typically comes down to observing the details.

[10:18] I'm going to give you a story about this. So, I was meeting with a different business,

[10:21] which is a solar sales company that was doing, you know, multiplayer figures, which is a great

[10:24] good size business. And the founder was telling me that they were struggling to develop a sales

[10:28] leadership within the business. And he said they did an offsite and they came up with like there

[10:32] six pillars of sales leadership and it was like accountability, time management, blah blah blah.

[10:37] Right, they had like six things. I don't remember they were. And he said after the two day,

[10:40] two day event, where everyone came together and agreed on those principles, they went back and

[10:44] no one changed their behavior. And I said, okay, well, what does accountability mean in terms of

[10:49] behavior? What is like show me what someone who's holding someone accountable does? How would I

[10:54] know that accountability had occurred? Right. And so, what happens there is he was like, wait,

[10:59] so I need to be like, oh, you need to text your team every morning. And you have to do end of

[11:04] week reports of every person review. And you need to at the end of the day give Kudos to people

[11:09] who did well. And then ask the people who didn't do well, what they were struggling with and then

[11:14] drill them on how to improve that skill. He's like, oh, I was like, right, say that. Don't say

[11:21] accountability, no, no, it doesn't mean we have to translate these big words into smaller actions

[11:27] that we want someone to make. And then it's very easy to say, hey, you didn't do these four things,

[11:32] rather than you did and hold someone accountable because they're like, I don't know. I thought I

[11:35] was holding him accountable because we both have different definitions for the same thing. And if this

[11:39] sounds more nuanced, to guess what, welcome to business. Right. These are skills that you just need to

[11:43] develop at some point. Because changing strategy forever over and over again is never going to get

[11:48] you up the mountain. All you're going to do is keep going down from this one, over to this one.

[11:52] And then maybe you get to hear and then you change over and then you go over to hear. And so each time

[11:56] you're wasting all of the extra effort, keeping switching paths, rather than saying, oh, the issue I

[12:02] have is talent, which means I need to recruit better. Of the issue is culture, which means that I have

[12:06] to show my leaders how to punish and reward behavior in the business. Oh, we're getting people in,

[12:12] but they're not being productive. So we need to improve our training rather than just say, oh,

[12:15] everyone sucks, right? And so a lot of success comes to sticking with something long enough to make the

[12:20] number of mistakes required to actually figure it out. Otherwise, you just keep starting from zero

[12:25] every single month. And you can beat 99% of people without being smarter or luckier, but by being

[12:30] willing to underpane an uncertainty for longer, that's the path of the mountain.

[12:34] Hey guys, real quick, if you want to have a blueprint of how to get up the mountain,

[12:39] this is the free $100 million scaling room at the zillion dollars scaling room at.

[12:44] This is something that was actually an internal tool that we made for ourselves. So we could

[12:47] better identify at every level of scaling, what a company would probably have to work on in order

[12:52] to get to the next level. And then we just decided to make it free. And so if you want this,

[12:56] you go to acquisition.com for its RodeMap and you enter business information and grab it.

[13:00] And if you like my team to give you personalized tactics that on the next page,

[13:05] you can book a call, we'll get to know you, get to the business, and ultimately invite you out

[13:09] if it makes sense. And at that point, we'd actually meet with you in person and say, hey, these are

[13:14] the things that we think are going to be the unlocks for your business right now. These are the

[13:18] things that can help pay down the uncertainty on the path you're already on. So hey, just look around

[13:23] the edge, you know, just here's a drill bit so you can get through the rock, right? Rather than

[13:27] say, oh, we have to reinvent the business. Because most time we just need to do what we're doing,

[13:30] a little better, a little different, by doing that and enlocks the path of the mountain so you can see it.

[13:35] So click the link and maybe I'll see you here in Vegas.

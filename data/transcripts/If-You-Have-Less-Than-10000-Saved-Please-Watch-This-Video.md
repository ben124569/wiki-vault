[00:00] If you're broke and you don't want to be anymore,

[00:02] Governor Beecher's of stats, if you're going to blow your wine,

[00:04] and then I'm going to give you six steps, so you don't have to be poor.

[00:06] The average American is a literal negative network.

[00:10] Means that babies are richer than people who are not babies,

[00:13] because babies haven't gone into debt.

[00:15] Number two, the average US minimum wage employee will make $1 million,

[00:19] and their entire lifetime in earnings.

[00:21] And if you are immediate of US income, you would earn $3 million,

[00:25] or, of course, your life.

[00:26] So the reason staying poor is the decision.

[00:29] It's because, you know, as long as you continue to work,

[00:32] you are going to make $1 million of dollars.

[00:36] And most of the time, it's going in places that don't make sense.

[00:40] So, challenge number one is the buying nothing challenge.

[00:42] It's very simple. You just buy nothing.

[00:44] So, just connect your credit card from Amazon.

[00:46] Leave your wallet in the home when you go to works.

[00:47] I've no way if you're to pay for something,

[00:49] either gas, if you're insurance, rent,

[00:51] car payment, if I had food, just don't grocery stores, you pack your lunch.

[00:54] That's all.

[00:55] If you buy nothing, that is, as a stair,

[00:58] we're hardcore as my recommendations may appear.

[01:03] I do not ask people to do things that I haven't done.

[01:06] And so, when I was taking 20,000 dollars a month,

[01:08] me personally, I was in a house with six roommates,

[01:13] and I split my bedroom with one roommate.

[01:16] And so, like, yeah, two beds,

[01:18] your dude's looking at the stuff every night.

[01:20] When I was making a million dollars a month,

[01:22] I was living on less than 15-toning.

[01:23] And so, the key takeaway that shifted how I thought about

[01:26] making money in more importantly,

[01:28] keep the money, is that wealth is actually a ratio

[01:31] between what you earn and what you need,

[01:34] and the number one rule of money is spent less than you make.

[01:39] And so, I always like being sure,

[01:41] more super conservative with my expenses,

[01:44] relative to what I made, because I don't like spending money,

[01:47] I feel like I need to view the three YouTube

[01:51] odd commentators who think that this is a crop set.

[01:55] You get this in the government, no.

[01:57] It's all they are.

[01:59] The first thing you have to do to be corrupt no fees,

[02:01] that you have to decide to be corrupt,

[02:03] and you have to decide that it's under your control.

[02:05] You have to switch from victim to victim.

[02:07] So, as much as you may have had to disillude

[02:09] and you're maybe, you got an identity to be court decision.

[02:11] You have to be the person who's most powerful,

[02:13] be in your life around money.

[02:14] The other third thing, and this is the one that really kills me,

[02:17] is that in the US, 35% of every paycheck,

[02:21] most rewards paying one thing, what I don't know is,

[02:25] banks, lenders, for 10, 35%.

[02:30] That's because people think about their mortgage as debt.

[02:32] They don't think about their car payment as debt.

[02:34] They don't think about their credit crisis debt.

[02:36] Those are reasons that banks are a front-end plus years old.

[02:40] Because they don't go out of business.

[02:42] They make so much money on money.

[02:44] Money is their product, and you keep buying their money from,

[02:48] at a bad price, and in a compounding price,

[02:51] they goes up every single year.

[02:53] And those people don't do the math on compounding,

[02:55] but like, right now, so many people are trying to get 10% at 9% of returns,

[02:59] and the stock market with the credit cards to 24% against them.

[03:03] And so, the easiest thing you can do right at that,

[03:05] we get a pay off the things that are guaranteed 24% negative returns.

[03:11] They're guaranteed, it's amazing.

[03:13] They're guaranteed returns against you being wealthy.

[03:15] Compound interest is the eighth, what are people important in Charlie Booker?

[03:19] And you want to face off head to head against the eighth one,

[03:22] or it will get to your goals.

[03:24] Go ahead, I TN.

[03:25] So, the thing is, if you're earning enough money,

[03:28] and they have very habits, being broke is a temporary status.

[03:32] So, step one, see if rent emergency fund.

[03:35] And so, these steps are similar to the rent emergency,

[03:38] maybe steps, maybe I think he's permanent on a dime-diver,

[03:41] and he's worth modeling, since.

[03:44] So, the one, see free to work just fun.

[03:46] When she's basically between $1,000 and $5,000,

[03:48] so recently, so many people don't hit their savings goals,

[03:51] because something happens, right?

[03:52] And so, it's like, having a work to fun for one year or a day,

[03:54] see where it's in your far-ward museum or a place,

[03:57] you know what I mean?

[03:57] This is that things that are unexpected,

[03:59] you can expect them to hear.

[04:02] You just don't know which one it's gonna be.

[04:03] Because if you look at it here, it's like about once a month,

[04:06] you'll have something unexpected, or anything,

[04:08] and you know it's gonna cost you.

[04:10] And so, it's just preparing for the expense,

[04:13] not which expense it is.

[04:14] What about like, dent, so I made it all first,

[04:16] no, learn to save money first,

[04:19] and just watch the amount go up into the athlete.

[04:22] By citizen, because I'm not trying to make your life difficult.

[04:25] I'm trying to tell you what I did to get here,

[04:27] and for those of you find that useful,

[04:30] you can model whatever you want,

[04:32] and have a good stop with it.

[04:33] So, even when I was making $1,000 a month,

[04:36] earlier, I went for a rent was $1,200 a month.

[04:40] So, that we ball out, that we appetizers,

[04:42] and we get the big, big, true, bad boat, boat for so,

[04:45] shout out to both of us.

[04:46] I took like a hundred dollars from,

[04:48] I felt like a rich guy.

[04:50] So, I think it's because some people just immediately

[04:54] change how they live when they make more money.

[04:56] Even the fact that I was in the story in 2003,

[04:58] it was because I saved every dollar I made.

[05:01] So, I got a $50,000 more soon.

[05:03] But, what's in my mind, I was making crazy money.

[05:06] I think I made $55,060,000,

[05:10] I think my first year out of college,

[05:12] and then I made, I want to say,

[05:16] seven year, eating something like that next year.

[05:19] And I saved 50 after taxes.

[05:21] So, I'm going to show you something really quick.

[05:23] If you have a $200 parent ordinance that you really want to buy,

[05:29] now you might want to buy them today,

[05:30] and let's say you're 25 years old,

[05:32] and you're like, I deserve these at work really hard for them.

[05:35] Okay fine.

[05:36] But, that $200 invested just in the S&P 500.

[05:42] When I begin to S&P 500,

[05:43] I'll talk about that later.

[05:44] Between now and the time you retire,

[05:47] do you want to know what that actually is?

[05:48] Yeah, $200 refugees.

[05:51] And we're going to give it 40 years,

[05:54] we're going to make our return 9% additional contribution.

[05:58] And instead of buying that $200 per year,

[06:01] who's going to be $65,000, if you just invest in the S&P.

[06:07] So, if you wouldn't buy those shoes for $6,000,

[06:12] then maybe don't buy them today for 200.

[06:15] When you buy Jordans, there's no upside that money is gone.

[06:20] It's just $6,000 that could have been something that's just going to be zero.

[06:23] And that's a big loss we do at Bovering over in Bovering.

[06:27] Really, $6,000, $7,000.

[06:30] Don't take a lot of this and add up to $1,030.

[06:33] $30,000,000, if you take a good business risk, there's upside.

[06:46] It's just that, sometimes you can't take this business risk because you're personal risk

[06:48] to too high.

[06:49] And so, for me, my full life, I've tried to jam this risk.

[06:52] But was I possible good so that I could go on the offensive on the business side?

[06:57] I think this was just like when I had my job so I've been started to jam.

[07:00] That was a big risk.

[07:01] But I had my lived on.

[07:02] There was nothing in Baltimore.

[07:04] So that I could take that swing.

[07:05] And if I hadn't had the basics then, I would not have to able to take that shot.

[07:10] And I sold those businesses live lost everything two or three times.

[07:14] If I had had to go on your debt, just a little bit, then I wouldn't even ever been able to take this second.

[07:18] And so the full point is it's like, you will make sure your shots are on goal by living

[07:25] risk free low risk in your personal life.

[07:28] You would be able to feel more like I feel more time to be not telling you.

[07:31] I feel businesses that have failed partnerships.

[07:34] I have many failures.

[07:36] But the only reason I could get back up is because I don't have this big thing that I have to take

[07:41] it up.

[07:42] It's like I mean that I can live on peanut butter sandwiches and egg whites.

[07:46] We can see protein and plenty of butter from the gas station with the water.

[07:49] I can do that.

[07:50] I can say, I'm already there.

[07:52] But I've lived on shit right now.

[07:53] So I have to lose it right now.

[07:55] Like that.

[07:56] And he's like, I like him.

[07:57] They're fine, they're perfect.

[07:58] And so I can live when I was enough.

[08:00] You can't even bother me because I know I was pretty contemporary.

[08:03] I was born, pretty consistent now.

[08:05] I like to be able to work out.

[08:07] So I'm bringing all these points up because singing one, it won't make you money.

[08:12] But it won't blow you up.

[08:13] So think further out and make bigger bets, which absolutely breaks my money.

[08:19] If I had not done that, I would have to do it.

[08:20] I had an end of June.

[08:21] I would have done it.

[08:22] The June for her.

[08:23] I was the finder that she turned around.

[08:24] This is how I would have done June watch.

[08:25] Did you do it?

[08:26] Well, I don't know.

[08:26] We didn't want to choose season that.

[08:27] She's not able to sell this June, Alan.

[08:30] From there, we're going to be able to do it because she's not calm.

[08:31] So like, it sounds small.

[08:33] But it's a tiny dominant and you can control.

[08:36] All right, step two.

[08:37] Which is, you can get it back after.

[08:38] There's two ways to think about it when you're out of makeup.

[08:40] After.

[08:41] There's a larger boy in the psychological way.

[08:41] I would recommend the psychological way.

[08:43] So let's say that you've got three different cards in the U.O.

[08:47] You've got one that's 20% and one that's 10% and one that's 10%.

[08:51] Okay, logic which did, that you should go after, that's 20% one.

[08:54] Psychology, you should go after one that you can pay off fast.

[09:00] So my recommendation despite the fact that the math would say,

[09:03] oh, I should pay off the one that cost me the most first.

[09:06] We're going to pay them all off of each week and you've been dealing with ball free

[09:10] of them for like years now.

[09:11] So chill, maybe just follow the process, which is get a wind faster.

[09:16] That's the whole point.

[09:17] And so pay them off in reverse order speed and pain in the wrong.

[09:21] So it's like, well, might not go down.

[09:23] Toon might not come out.

[09:24] I think when I have those little like jackpots,

[09:25] but I'm going to learn as much as you have more of them sooner in your process.

[09:28] After one thing you have the high-seater withdrawn,

[09:30] is also the fastest way to pay off the deflate.

[09:33] That's a double way.

[09:34] Like you can kind of like frequent wins and you're just waiting like nine months to do that.

[09:38] Because you have to pay this big note off, just let the way.

[09:40] It didn't be clear what I'm talking about when you off that.

[09:42] I'm talking private airlines.

[09:43] Super debt and credit cards and things like that.

[09:45] If you have a car, I recommend trading it down.

[09:54] Easy to pay off your car is pay off the cheaper car.

[09:56] And the one you have, just you're lending me on your beans.

[10:01] It's just that you thought your beans were higher than the other.

[10:03] That's okay.

[10:04] That's why you're watching this.

[10:05] I want to give you one mint with a mint that should hopefully

[10:08] drag through by this issue.

[10:11] So you're going to save about 10 bucks a day for you to get a million dollars in for the years.

[10:18] So the amount is $250 a month that you could away.

[10:23] The compound is a 9% that you can be at a million for the years.

[10:27] That feels so easy to do.

[10:30] We only think these here is not doing.

[10:33] And if you were to just put $500 a month, you'd be at $211 million in 30 years.

[10:42] That'd be clear most people can live on about 4-inch percent.

[10:46] And that's with never touching the principal.

[10:48] At some point, you can start on wanting it and spending the money.

[10:50] Right?

[10:51] At 4% which is very safe and about getting it spent off that.

[10:54] You can let one day to go in here.

[10:56] This is the game application that I want you to think about.

[10:58] Which is that for every 250 dollars that you say every month,

[11:02] it's a million dollars in for leaguess.

[11:04] Let's basically just use that as we're going to.

[11:06] And you're like, wait, so much even 1,000, you're like, right?

[11:08] That's 4 million.

[11:10] You're like, I'm safe 2,000, you're like, that's 8 million.

[11:13] Right?

[11:13] And so the thing is, that's where you're going to get into this game.

[11:16] Where you're going to be like, VG water, you're like the smooth VG water.

[11:20] Right?

[11:20] But I don't always use this big into the bank.

[11:22] And I've never watched it in this new way.

[11:23] Well, didn't use it with all this money on this.

[11:25] Yeah, there's levels.

[11:26] Right?

[11:26] But you got to get from live at one first, which is, you got to spend less than we make.

[11:30] We got to see what we're keeping.

[11:32] Okay, it's steps three.

[11:33] Because you're actually going to be going to double down on step one,

[11:35] which is this, is that you've explained your emergency savings.

[11:38] One to five, $1,000 is not a real emergency savings.

[11:41] That's like just to produce something you want to kind of save money.

[11:44] The real emergency savings is really heavy.

[11:46] Like, 3 to 6 months of living expenses saved up.

[11:49] You can just leave it in and interest very account,

[11:52] which there's plenty of places that will be 5% per set, at least today.

[11:55] We're making you this video on the money you put in there.

[11:58] The magic of this is that when you put that cash there,

[12:02] your level anxiety around everything else in life will go down.

[12:05] And this will then, I snowball and being able to actually take your advice

[12:11] from paycheck to paycheck will look about.

[12:14] Then this is where saving money makes you money is that it allows you to see the opportunities

[12:17] around you because you actually can't loan the offense.

[12:20] And we believe we're not going to invest this money.

[12:22] This money is just your brick and safety that you will always have because you don't know what's

[12:25] going to happen next.

[12:27] So that seeks the way to step forward, which is the limited risk he's spending.

[12:30] So if you have a car lease, turn it in.

[12:32] All right. And then buying $5,000 a click.

[12:35] All right. So 5 green, 10 green, and cash.

[12:37] Again, we're at the worst step forward.

[12:39] All right. So you've already saved some money and you've learned how to save.

[12:42] You've even paid off some debt.

[12:43] Now, treat that thing in.

[12:44] But in it, I'm going to every car we had in cash and all we had bought the use.

[12:48] I think my first video car is all on that.

[12:50] Over 100,000 miles a day.

[12:51] I was just how I thought everyone bought cars.

[12:55] Go sheet. Look for a car that's 100,000 years old.

[12:57] Looking car facts.

[12:58] I'd probably have something that has low insurance and low repair.

[13:02] And a lot of that stuff you can look at.

[13:03] Average cost for repair by different vehicles.

[13:06] Next thing is vehicle, multiple cars.

[13:07] Don't agree to one.

[13:08] I mean, Leeland, I lived with one car for years.

[13:11] I can't agree with story about either told the story for a...

[13:13] So the first time I drove up to Jim Lodge event.

[13:16] So we had, I think, like, 30 or 40 bucks per second at the time.

[13:19] You know, for all the Jim Lodge team around, so this was an Alvin Precini vaccine.

[13:23] That's where Leeland I was living in.

[13:26] And as a cool guy, I pulled into the Laelos car.

[13:28] Now, who's power-fired and there was no other car.

[13:30] And he had a crack in the windshield and a dead in the door.

[13:33] Her Bajibot or Seamy.

[13:34] And one of the ladies who's in the group was like,

[13:37] I can't thought he was supposed to be rich.

[13:39] So oh, she's like, I can do it.

[13:41] I know, we'll game on play.

[13:43] The game you're judging on is a stupid game.

[13:45] If you have kids, maybe there's considerations that are even then like,

[13:49] is there a way that you can just use foresight and say,

[13:52] how will we share a one car?

[13:53] Because there are many families that do have kids that do share one.

[13:56] Or, and so if they can do it, so can you know,

[13:58] then what you're doing is you're paid for convenience.

[14:00] But that convenience is costing a member of $500 a month.

[14:03] What's that? That's $2 million.

[14:05] That's what that convenience is.

[14:07] Is it $2 million worth that?

[14:09] Oh, no.

[14:09] And so what I want to push on is like, what's your advice?

[14:12] Some people like we love going down to eat.

[14:14] People love shoes.

[14:15] That's guys egg, right?

[14:17] Some people love clothes.

[14:18] So people love vacation.

[14:20] So I'm just like, live a neighborhood that shouldn't be it.

[14:22] You've got to look at how that translates in the time.

[14:25] It translates into the future.

[14:27] But so there's the two big mainstream things

[14:30] I want you to use.

[14:31] If you can translate all this stuff yet.

[14:33] So like, that car is a $600 worth least that you have.

[14:36] Right?

[14:37] That means that.

[14:38] Let's say that he made $100 a day.

[14:41] Guys, that's 12.5 to you.

[14:42] Okay, let's say, let's say that for post-hands.

[14:44] So you're at 15 or someone like that.

[14:47] Look at that means that if you were four weeks

[14:52] a lot of 22 days of work is in a month,

[14:55] you were working six of your 22 days for the car that you drive to work with.

[15:02] Okay?

[15:03] That can't be translating the money into the time.

[15:06] It's not something that he spent $1200 a month on your lease.

[15:10] Maybe you're a little bit hungry, you let.

[15:12] Right?

[15:13] Okay, well, now you got 12 days.

[15:16] So we got six in 12, right?

[15:17] In the team of our 22nd weeks.

[15:20] You don't have much left.

[15:21] Right?

[15:23] It's like how much of each of these days might you and my using up

[15:27] to just do my fixed costs.

[15:29] And these are the ones that you can completely jam down.

[15:32] Well, anything that people are eating is dear ego.

[15:34] And what I said earlier,

[15:36] that I'm not going to ask you to do something you haven't done.

[15:38] I was in a white color consultant who saved $15,000 in an out of contact.

[15:44] And I got rid of that.

[15:46] And then basically we did a vote for our

[15:48] Gerrovacrossely country.

[15:50] Didn't have a place to live.

[15:51] Had it guy like basically allowed me to read

[15:55] but met room for $400 a month.

[15:57] And I went by Jim Rit, to $5,000 a month.

[16:00] I'm not sure how much I can anywhere but not.

[16:03] So I lived in my J.M. by L.J. on zero.

[16:05] So I was in the home, I saw my life in Southwich.

[16:06] I was fine.

[16:07] I was just not like, I tried to quiet say like,

[16:10] oh my god, you should be taking a better care of this car.

[16:13] It was like dirty and I had like washed it or whatever.

[16:15] That tiny action represents a hundred and thousands of smaller actions.

[16:20] And it would be it's where I'm going to.

[16:22] And so they're grateful for that man.

[16:24] At that time, he was going to take that sacrifice

[16:28] for me to do what I could do.

[16:30] So a great question that I have for you

[16:32] is what are you willing to give up to me?

[16:36] Rather than what you're willing to do.

[16:38] Because a lot of the times in the beginning

[16:40] it's about a millionation, not a dish.

[16:43] The people that you're going to get out of your life.

[16:45] It's the expenses that you're going to get out of your life.

[16:47] It's the posture.

[16:48] It's going to be the showing off.

[16:50] If you weren't willing to sacrifice anything to become a millionaire

[16:53] and you will become a donor.

[16:56] The dormitory of what building is going to fall into place.

[16:59] That's really it.

[17:00] He went from having a six footer dollar with a two-binding car

[17:04] and cash.

[17:05] That he now owns that spoke big down grade 49.

[17:08] But he's paying off his debt.

[17:09] And now he's like just seeing every month my debt could down.

[17:12] He's like it's so like reinforcing what I'm going to do.

[17:15] And I hope he what I found out.

[17:17] So that's of the highest number of those who live in paycheck to paycheck.

[17:20] I'll talk to more if he would not necessarily want to be

[17:22] a millionaire.

[17:23] It's so interesting to be able to have the people who are the wealthiest

[17:27] that once you've had the most saved up the most invested or not

[17:31] often the highest rhinos.

[17:33] Again, it's this misconception that people think

[17:36] a unique lot of money have a lot of money.

[17:38] It often comes on the ace of all.

[17:40] And I don't know about you.

[17:41] I'd rather be underestimated from what you've got.

[17:44] And so the group wishes do a little bridge.

[17:46] I do a little beer.

[17:47] And I think a lot of you guys are going on with your sauce model good work.

[17:51] You all keep looking into your gaps or the bridge.

[17:53] You don't actually want to have this money.

[17:55] Me and I'm actually very riskable.

[17:57] I hate a hate feeling, I hate the feeling of being a money

[18:02] more than you do.

[18:05] That's why I did everything in my life so that I would have to feel that one.

[18:08] Real fun.

[18:09] You want tolerance for poverty is a higher.

[18:13] You've accustomed to that feeling.

[18:15] You're willing to do what that's for us.

[18:18] I'd be like, we've got a feeling things like that.

[18:20] So you just to spouse how we're changing.

[18:22] What pays us is the never we need to be.

[18:24] It's weak and far-cooling.

[18:25] You have to be real about this.

[18:27] And if you're not going to keep up with the jokes this

[18:29] today, but you will pass the dreams as eventually.

[18:32] If you want to look rich, long term, the best way to do that is to actually do it.

[18:38] Because it will be stressful.

[18:40] It will be stressful about one.

[18:42] And I think that does have a wheelchair change in how your life feels.

[18:46] So I'll just return to it going for Charlie Wood.

[18:48] I said, the first one in Grand Is a Mitch.

[18:50] But you got to do it.

[18:51] I don't care what you have to do.

[18:52] If it means walking it, we're not eating anything that wasn't purchased.

[18:56] If you coupon, find a way to get your hands on a budget grade.

[18:58] After that, you can use something else.

[19:00] Now, why did he set this years ago?

[19:03] So he's probably close to $150, maybe $200,000 in a,

[19:07] and so I said this because you want to make it fun.

[19:11] And so I gave you my little story with the door to be real.

[19:13] Put it on the next social.

[19:14] If I take this, what's your reward?

[19:16] If I take this one, they see how quickly you can knock it down.

[19:19] Right?

[19:20] So the next one is run mortgages.

[19:22] If you're renting, you want to downgrade to something that's cheaper as she was

[19:26] you boss with you.

[19:27] If you have a mortgage that you can afford hardening it out of that.

[19:31] And so you can refinance if they're the visual lower.

[19:35] If they're not lower, then you want to try and get a 15-year fixed.

[19:40] And that way, you can just try and pay it down as fast as possible.

[19:42] The idea is that you just want to pay the house off.

[19:44] And now we don't have to worry about it.

[19:46] Unless the government comes after for problem attacks.

[19:48] Well, I can tell you that living in cash be for house is very chill.

[19:52] Be alert.

[19:53] Okay. My car is paid for cash.

[19:55] My house is paid for in cash.

[19:56] What happens is that you're earning capacity starts snowballing.

[19:59] Because if you don't have this car pivot and you don't have a mortgage,

[20:02] all of a sudden you're like, whoa, I'm only working two days a month for my normal expenses.

[20:06] The other 20, I have now, for going all-aid on investments in either way self-wrass

[20:12] that's at the above or above total.

[20:13] So step five is in best 15% of pre-tags in pre-tags income.

[20:20] It's just up to the student of open retirement.

[20:23] Now, the way that I like Lee Bethes is,

[20:25] auto-me investments,

[20:28] frictionalize, spending.

[20:30] So basically, you make it hard to spend easy to say.

[20:33] Easy to do it best.

[20:34] And so I like to take the things that have to get,

[20:36] have to get to the subject, and invest it off the top.

[20:39] Affinear, I begin everything else.

[20:42] Now, I still would have another bucket there.

[20:44] There would be education that I would invest.

[20:46] It's purely like, man, you talk about the S&P 500.

[20:49] I don't know about it though.

[20:50] The money for you, right?

[20:51] It'd be into due educational stuff.

[20:53] It's like, well, spend less.

[20:55] And if I can't spend less, you can always spend less.

[20:57] Right?

[20:59] But you can still split it in sale.

[21:01] Okay, I'll put 15% pre-tags into investing up another 15% pre-tags into why education.

[21:07] Because that's going to be majoring in capacity.

[21:09] Because as soon as you can replace what it cost you in education for that investment,

[21:15] everything else is great.

[21:16] It's like how soon it will be.

[21:18] And so the full goal of the first educational investment is to cover itself.

[21:22] Well, it's that happens like all doubling down after that.

[21:24] And that's my recommendation.

[21:25] It's like the data you stop investing in your education,

[21:28] and getting more skills, is that you decide that you don't want to make any more money

[21:31] than you currently are.

[21:32] By the way, this is an investment advice.

[21:34] You can do whatever you want.

[21:36] This is just me telling you what I told by the team.

[21:38] So next one is a little money.

[21:39] Have it.

[21:41] Still under the step five is you want to check your account's daily.

[21:44] So this is something that I recommend for everybody who's basically before your savings.

[21:49] I stopped with the MI accounts every day.

[21:51] It was across like 20 million.

[21:53] That was when I literally stopped checking every day.

[21:55] Because the volatility stopped making sense.

[21:56] It makes sense anymore.

[21:57] But you want to have a post for your money.

[22:00] And so you want to know, you want to know what's coming in, what's going out.

[22:03] Like, you want to feel that.

[22:05] And when you're looking at expensive, that's a lot for me.

[22:07] Because you know how much that hits your account.

[22:08] And like that, that was a good hit in flow.

[22:10] You're willing to to to spend more in some areas that you're like,

[22:14] I'm getting returns there.

[22:15] But like you can't know that unless you're in the Indian account every day,

[22:19] you have that flow.

[22:20] So if you want to know something wild.

[22:22] So if you were 20 years old right now.

[22:25] And you do the thing that I forgot to tell you,

[22:27] it's going to sound insane.

[22:29] But you would have $50 million saved up in the end.

[22:33] So here's how it works.

[22:35] You take on an extra job.

[22:37] You work in extra shift.

[22:39] You make an extra 25% off of someone.

[22:41] That means you drive Uber, you say,

[22:43] you go to your boss to say, I have more time.

[22:45] Can I do someone else's job?

[22:47] Or can I look at other jobs and take portions of that for more pet?

[22:51] And a lot of times, if you offer to work more,

[22:54] businesses will pay you more because they have more work to do.

[22:58] And so you can make an extra $1,000,000,

[23:00] they don't sell us a lot.

[23:01] But if you've made an extra 25,000 hours,

[23:03] but you put that every single month towards just investing

[23:07] into the S&P five, again, not S&P, just S&P.

[23:09] All the other stuff we said stays, we're just doing this all the time,

[23:12] but we're not touching it.

[23:13] So then you would have 55 years of compounding at 9.7%.

[23:21] And let's say you're starting a month or zero.

[23:24] And you're going to put $25,000 a month.

[23:27] Oh, my.

[23:28] If you did that for 55 years, you'd have $52 million at the end.

[23:35] Like you'd be ultra-hine at work.

[23:38] And so I say this because wealth is a decision.

[23:41] It's a really control, and it starts with spending less than what you make.

[23:46] It's about increasing your own capacity,

[23:49] sequencing and paying off the things that are that are dumb to be paying for,

[23:54] walking in the negative compounding against you and walking those,

[23:58] so that you can start the positive compounding,

[24:00] developing the simple habit of saving something,

[24:02] then paying off smaller ones and saving up bigger ones.

[24:06] Then getting a little bit more on the offensive, restructuring,

[24:09] how steth so that you can pay it off faster, what's your there?

[24:11] Then it starts snowballing.

[24:13] Then you go more aggressively into your work, the extra shifts,

[24:16] you invest the 15 free tax, maybe you invest the 15 free tax into yourself,

[24:20] if I had to pay between the two, bar none, not even close, I'd invest in me.

[24:24] You could sure build it up earned, we're using money.

[24:26] It's going to always be higher than what being S&P, five or even do.

[24:30] So let's say that you put $10,000 into BS and P500 in a gross 10%

[24:34] you have $1,000 bucks great.

[24:36] But say instead, you take the $10,000, and I said that,

[24:39] working that extra shift, maybe instead of a shoveling snow,

[24:43] you buy a snowblower, and now the snowblower takes you from doing three driveways a day to doing 20.

[24:48] When you knock doors and say, hey, I'm snowblower, and you're driving for you,

[24:52] would seven to six year or an acre pass?

[24:54] Will that make you more than an extra $1,000 this year?

[24:57] Yes, buy a lot, buy a long shot, and say,

[25:00] the key is not thinking about what you can do passively with the money, although I like having this

[25:06] understanding of it, especially in the beginning, it's about an increase in your active income.

[25:10] So here's the craziest thing.

[25:12] That $52 million that you would have.

[25:16] That's being made by someone no matter what.

[25:20] Think about this for a second.

[25:22] If you didn't change your habits,

[25:24] you'd more or less make the same amount of money.

[25:26] But that 35% of the American paycheck is going to someone,

[25:30] and that someone is taking that money and putting into something that

[25:33] cupboards, and they're doing it for the entirety of your life.

[25:36] And so the question just comes down to who do you want that $50 million to go on to?

[25:41] Do you want it to belong to the banks and their shareholders?

[25:43] Or do you want it to belong to you?

[25:45] But either way, that money is being made.

[25:47] It's just whether it's going to be you pass it again.

[25:49] So the last step, just to be clear, is that you pay off your mortgage,

[25:52] then all of your basic living expenses are covering your fixed costs,

[25:56] and are done.

[25:58] And now, all of that, a lot's even more investment into your long-term legs.

[26:03] Now, this works really well when paired with the the $30, $12,

[26:09] all right, $35, well, walking challenge is basically you work 30 days straight,

[26:15] no weekends, 12 hours a day, and you don't take days off.

[26:19] Now, what happens is, now everyone's going to be like,

[26:21] that's not sustainable.

[26:22] That's why I said 30 days, not the rest of your life.

[26:24] The point is, is that you'll realize that the end of 30 days

[26:28] that you can't work harder than you thought you could.

[26:30] You can't go a week or two without thinking day off,

[26:33] and you're not going to die.

[26:34] Because believe they're not thousands of years, we didn't have weekends.

[26:37] Weekends are a new concept that's happened to as soon as factories were invented,

[26:40] and I think it was a way to get even more something out of people.

[26:44] A cable moment where it was.

[26:46] The point is, is that if you stop spending all your money,

[26:50] and then you take all the time when you normally spend money,

[26:52] and then make money, you get a double, you reduce the negative end-ad and the positive,

[26:56] and see how much damage you can do in 30 days,

[27:00] and then you could say, is it worth it for me to get more and more?

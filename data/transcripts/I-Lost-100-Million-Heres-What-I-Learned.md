[00:00] I've lost a hundred million dollars over my career and in this video I'm gonna

[00:04] break down every single one of my mistakes so you don't have to. My first big

[00:08] loss was crypto and I'm gonna be order these roughly lowest to most amount of

[00:13] money at the very end I'll give you the big good one of the one that I lost

[00:16] absolutely a shit load on that you'll probably be able to learn the most from. In

[00:20] 2017 a buddy of mine was like hey man you should buy this stuff called a

[00:23] theory em it was a hundred bucks I set up the account I put a million dollars in

[00:27] and then like right before I'm about to click purchase at a hundred dollars it

[00:31] went down to like 93 and I was like I don't know about this and so I decided

[00:36] not to pull the trigger long story short it then you know 30 extra

[00:39] whatever it was this next time around a few years later it would have been

[00:43] going like this and then right here Bitcoin was at $60,000 a theory and was

[00:49] really high to I called my buddy up not the same guy different buddy and I was

[00:52] like hey man I'm gonna get it on this and he was like I'll put a million bucks in

[00:56] if you do and I was like fine so we put a million bucks in and then lost 500

[01:01] grand in a matter of weeks but there's two things that I think were good

[01:07] reminders from me from this whole experience the first is that me making

[01:11] million dollar bet at the time was not a huge percentage of my income or my

[01:15] net worth and I made more than every month anyways I didn't plan on having this

[01:18] be how I made money I made money doing stuff that are fundamental business

[01:22] things and then I basically made a bet or a gamble which realistically

[01:25] it was just gambling the second big point was that one buff in Charlie Mugger

[01:30] talking about your sphere of competence business is very much within that

[01:33] marketing sales acquisition pricing product there's the things in very good

[01:36] at now outside of this is probably real estate and crypto and a bunch of

[01:43] other things that other people do and have spent lots of time developing their

[01:48] skill set those people should do those things I have no idea and I have just

[01:53] noticed the further away I get from my core the more money I lose and the

[02:00] closer I am to the core of what I'm good at the more money I make I will give you a

[02:04] little tidbit that a mentor gave me if you know how to create wealth just

[02:10] create wealth don't fuck with investing if you know how to make money and he gave

[02:16] that to me his advice and I try to remember that as like what am I good at

[02:19] and so I think it's important to think about what are the themes that are going to

[02:22] be around these mistakes you're hopefully not going to repeat the mistake

[02:25] I'd rather you just get the lesson without the scar right and so number one

[02:29] out of my sphere of competence number two I latched on a phomo I saw these

[02:33] people's like man I would like to make quick fast easy money too right when

[02:36] everyone thinks something is a good idea it's usually a bad idea whatever you

[02:40] feel that phomo I've now learned pause so the second big mistake I had was in

[02:45] real estate and you'll notice there's multiple big mistakes that I will make

[02:48] in real estate over my career and hopefully I start making them this one was

[02:52] actually my first ever real estate investment so later than I've been making a

[02:56] ton of money in general for a few years now I think at the time we probably had

[03:00] honestly like 20 million bucks in cash so buddy minds like hey I've got this

[03:03] guy he sells houses in Ohio because houses in Ohio are actually really cheap

[03:08] when I got on the phone at the guy and he said yeah I buy him for 30 I

[03:13] fixed him for 10 grand so I have 40,000 and then I flip it to you for 50 so I

[03:18] make 10 on this bread he's like that's my problem I just sell a lot of them I was

[03:21] like okay that's cool he's like well do you want to buy five do you want to buy

[03:23] 10 what do you want to buy and this is from a lesson that I learned earlier on

[03:26] less money I was like why don't I did my toe in like let's not lose a

[03:31] shitload of money if this doesn't work but I said why don't I just buy one of

[03:35] these houses and see what happens it turned out that the house was not in fact a

[03:40] three bedroom it was actually a two-bedder house and the third bedroom was

[03:43] actually in a closet that they'd put a mattress into the house did not actually

[03:48] have electricity they were running it from the neighbor's house illegally the drive

[03:51] way was so in shambles that the people couldn't actually park on it so 10

[03:55] it's couldn't park there fixing the driveway on its own was like $7,000 now for a

[04:00] house that's cost 50 that's a huge chunk of what you put into his an investment

[04:04] remember I'm trying to get like 6,000 a year a friend of mine who is in real

[04:07] estate different friend looked up the county records or whatever and found out

[04:10] the baguette who had sold it to me actually bought the house for $19,000 and

[04:14] had put no money into the house and so his business model was buy for 19

[04:18] flip at the 50 to people who don't know any better that was made and the 10

[04:21] it's paying $700 a month now all right so that was what we got we're able to

[04:25] rent this place for now $700 a month doesn't cover the the driveway that I had

[04:29] to repair I doesn't cover the electricity that I had to actually run from

[04:33] scratch into this thing to make it livable and honestly really kind of tenants

[04:37] they were like hey you think you know it would be nice if we could have our

[04:40] owner electricity and like of course they fucking should I didn't know I was buying

[04:44] it out of state what did I have to do because it was unlivable I'd put them up in a

[04:47] hotel while we had to basically make this place livable and so that took like

[04:51] 30 days this family isn't a hotel that I'm paying for this whole time as the

[04:55] landlord selling the house with the tenant in it I think for $20,000 because I was

[05:02] like just get rid of this fucking thing the thing that I lost beyond just the

[05:05] 30 or 40 or 50,000 dollars I lost in the deal was you amount of time effort and

[05:09] energy and emails and phone calls so in back and forth about this bullshit

[05:14] thing and for context at the time I'm making 50,000 a day in profit like I was

[05:19] like just fucking get this out of my life what am I stake so anyways I call the

[05:23] guy up who sold me the house you know it's like dude like what the fuck and

[05:28] basically he stopped responding to my my attempts to reach out to him because it was

[05:32] apparent what he had done and I basically was like I just want to let you know

[05:34] I'm really grateful that you taught me this lesson for searching and he being the

[05:39] scumbag that he was said you're welcome he very much was aware of the fact that

[05:43] he was totally running a scam let me walk you through some of the lessons that I

[05:47] got from this so number one is that if it's too good to be true he usually is now

[05:51] he was telling me about 25% plus cash and cash returns right I caught a

[05:55] buddy one who owns a billion dollar fund and I was like hey what do you think about

[05:59] this thing he was like this doesn't make sense he's like because if he really

[06:01] was doing that he should just don't know about how it's like why would he why would

[06:04] he sell these houses and I was like no man you should not believe her too good to be

[06:08] true all right usually is and the thing is is the hard part about this one this

[06:12] one's really deceptive is that if you're in early on something sometimes it is

[06:15] really good but the thing that makes it the to be true part is that if no one else

[06:19] is aware of it there's this double-edged sword of like am I seeing some

[06:23] opportunity that's gonna close in the marketplace or am I just about to get

[06:26] fucking rob blind the second thing is you'll see this lovely recurring friend

[06:31] we have here is that I saw my friend's making money and I was like oh man I

[06:35] should do it and he was a business guy and I was like oh if he's a business guy I

[06:37] can do it I'm a business guy I could do he lost his ass too which leaves me the

[06:40] number three which is now if someone tells me about an opportunity that they're

[06:43] doing for investing which for me is now much longer time rising I say how long

[06:47] you've been in this deal for if someone says they've been doing it for less than

[06:51] two or three years I don't care point three is that what's the whole period if I'm

[06:55] hearing about something from somebody they better be doing it for multiple

[06:58] years before I'm gonna even consider it and so what I would say I do now with these

[07:03] types of things is that one I'll do it with somebody but I want to do it with the

[07:08] guy so that guy who was on the phone with me selling me the property what I would

[07:12] do now is to say all by a property that you bought and if they don't want to go

[07:15] on with me great then I'm not doing it in the beginning I was really

[07:19] greedy I was like oh how do I anybody have the upside now I'm having to give

[07:21] partners the upside because the more money they make the more they want to make it

[07:24] with me and we'll do it together and I'd rather have a very sure 20% than a

[07:28] really risky 40 and whenever I feel that little tickle in my stomach or the back

[07:33] of my neck or I'm like oh I feel like I'm missing out I literally just stop and I

[07:37] say wait because every huge amount of money that I've made has never been from

[07:41] any investment it's been from me seeing an arbitrage opportunity in marketing

[07:46] and sales and seeing that I can acquire customer for $10 that's worth a thousand

[07:49] and then saying great let's Jim is much cash it's hugely possible into that

[07:53] but that takes lots of iterations to get there and I was there every single step

[07:57] of the way it doesn't just appear on some spreadsheet showing how rich I'm

[08:00] going to get so mistake number two my little house in Ohio for $50,000 that taught

[08:04] me lessons far more valuable that I've saved me way more than $50,000 over the

[08:09] rest of my investing career so $50,000 goes survey says good bye so my third

[08:17] lovely mistake that I had was terrible partners now I'm going to go through a

[08:22] few of these and I'm going to ladder up to the worst partnership I had the

[08:26] first partnerships I made I made because I was insecure I made them because I

[08:31] didn't think I could do it on my own I just partnered with people that I thought

[08:35] would know more than me just because they were there more or less and this is

[08:39] not any disrespect to those people it was my mistake not theirs I have had nine

[08:43] failed partnerships in my entire life before I started making money nine different

[08:49] people that I was partnered with I'm going to give you the the nitty-greet of

[08:53] every lesson I learned from all of them so the first partner that I ever took on

[08:57] was an advisor told me hey you should partner with this guy to start a gym

[09:02] all right my very first gym and he said he's already got a gym in the

[09:05] neighborhood you want to be in you can start with his client tell base and just go

[09:08] into a bigger gym and come together and I was like okay that sounds good and he's

[09:11] like yeah you guys both of the exact same skill set and you have the exact same

[09:15] business you guys should just split it and then I will take 10% for putting the

[09:20] deal together so you'll be 45 he'll be 45 and I'll be 10 for advising and

[09:25] putting this all together and we both said sure now guess what the worst way to

[09:30] start a business partnership is you both have the exact same skill sets and you

[09:34] both mean the exact same thing to the table we're both bringing work and very

[09:38] little capital to the table where we have the same business that we're trying

[09:41] to do and guess what most people do when they start a business exactly that so

[09:45] lesson number one of partnerships they have to have something you don't so

[09:49] they either have to have time you don't they got to have money you don't

[09:52] they got to skills you don't that's it if they don't have one of those three

[09:55] things one of you isn't needed all right lesson number one they got to have

[09:59] something you don't lesson number two you lose the most equity day one so most

[10:03] people are so inal about how they want to sell their company for this amount of

[10:06] money and blah blah blah blah they're thinking about their equity but day one

[10:09] they lock half off we give it to somebody they don't have two thirds off and give

[10:13] one third here and one third here because they've got three buddies and they say hey

[10:16] well there's three of us let's cut the pine to thirds and we'll go into

[10:19] business together doesn't work that way because oftentimes the economic

[10:23] contribution is not equitable if you look at time money skill between all the

[10:27] people that are going to get into business together if you have more than one

[10:29] of those and they have more than one of those well how much is each person

[10:32] contributing now part of that comes down to negotiation being really honest

[10:35] about it but people want to avoid these hard conversations early on because

[10:38] only what if hey if it works out we make a lot of money is not gonna matter I

[10:41] fucking promise you the more money you make the more it's gonna fucking matter

[10:45] I'm not living that from experience you lose a lot of equity day one equity

[10:49] doesn't need to be equal so for example if you did want to bring partners in you

[10:53] could have a 95 five split just make sure that what people are doing with

[10:57] their investing in time money and skills is appropriate for their

[11:01] contribution and if they bulk at that then think fucking God you said that on day

[11:06] one so you don't have to do with it later now you have this fear well what if I

[11:09] can't do this business without them I promise you can do the business without

[11:13] them all right every successful business I had during the period after my

[11:16] nine field partnerships I did on my own with Leila my OG rider die partner

[11:21] so I give half no matter what that was from my first two partnerships that I

[11:25] had the second two partnerships that I had when I got into business with these

[11:28] guys I was gonna run the business all day every day I was gonna be there I

[11:32] also invested capital and I was also the one who knew everything about fitness and

[11:36] the individuals didn't know either of those things and work in him

[11:40] spending all their time in the business like I was they didn't take a

[11:42] salary to the other income streams they were far while here than fucking

[11:44] for older than I was and I didn't and so I had saved up about seventy thousand

[11:49] dollars in the first you know six months or so my business you're like

[11:52] wait a second you were making money and the business was growing and then you

[11:55] brought partners in damn straight I did and then I sold two thirds of my

[11:59] business for the cost it cost me to start it not for what it was making me every

[12:03] month I made two thirds of what I got paid for the entire two thirds of my

[12:07] business because I was a moron and so not really I was inexperienced I didn't

[12:12] know any better it was me paying down ignorance debt which is why I'm making

[12:16] these videos for you so you don't have to do it either okay and if you're the one

[12:20] using the business you should get paid as an employee as well like there's

[12:24] ownership and then there's working in the business if you're saying hey I want to

[12:28] be fifty fifty in this business but I'm gonna be working in and you're not for

[12:31] example which happens a lot I'm fifty fifty but I need a manager salary because

[12:35] this is what this would be and that basically makes out for the fact that you're

[12:39] doing the job and taking the risk of make sure that if you're in the

[12:42] business and you're doing a job you get paid like you're doing a job

[12:45] the amount of times I talked to my friend is where like I'm like how much you

[12:48] take on this year and they're like nothing and I'm like why they're like I'm

[12:51] reinvesting everything in the business I'm like okay not making a profit is

[12:54] not reinvesting everything in the business it means that you're business sucks

[12:56] and it's much harder to say that and it's way sexier when you say hey I'm

[12:59] reinvesting all my reinvesting and growth but if you're actually reinvesting

[13:03] and growth then I would say then what's your return on capital if you don't

[13:06] have the answer that question you're not fucking reinvesting and growth you're

[13:08] just not making money I'm still gonna come back to partnerships I'm staying on

[13:11] this page because it's gonna be a recurring thing mistake number four

[13:14] getting fancy so my first location in Huntington Beach cost me 37 thousand

[13:19] lower so I had duct tape sandbags from Home Depot that I used to sandbags

[13:23] I couldn't afford the nice ones like I was I had so little money to start this

[13:29] thing what's crazy though is that within six months that business is making

[13:31] 2025 thousand dollars a month right in profit was making good money but the

[13:34] thing is is that once that business my hundreds of these locations are

[13:37] making money I was like okay my next location is gonna be really sick so I'll

[13:41] went from a five thousand square foot warehouse that was behind an auto shop two

[13:45] an anchor location in a retail center that was seven thousand square feet so

[13:49] bigger more expensive rent big storefront I spent two hundred and fifty

[13:54] thousand dollars to open it up I wanted to be we got class lobby we like we

[13:58] like you know we did it all up it made the same amount of money as my first

[14:02] location and so the lesson for me was like I literally just burned money so I

[14:07] could say I was investing in the business but all I did was buy shit that

[14:11] didn't necessarily turn into revenue and so that's why and this is the lesson

[14:15] here so this is Deer whatever around right is RLIC I want you to write it down

[14:20] that's return on invested capital if you're going to spend money in your

[14:24] business every expense you have on your expense line you should be able to say

[14:27] how is this making me money how am I getting a return on this right if you

[14:31] buy cost of goods you buy you buy products for ten bucks and you sell for 30

[14:34] you have a return there you're tripling your money that's a great

[14:36] investment if you can get it you go from ten to eight and off somebody comes

[14:39] three and a half or whatever it is right where the math is there but where you

[14:42] lose is where you spend twenty five thousand dollars on something and you do

[14:45] make twenty five thousand dollars over the next ten years will fuck that means you

[14:49] make twenty five hundred dollars extra this year you're just down twenty two

[14:51] thousand five and in a small business you should be making three to one five to

[14:55] one ten to one on the dollars you spend because you can when you're small you

[14:58] can be way more efficient than big organizations can you can buy leads for

[15:01] buck and sell five hundred dollars things to one out of five spend five bucks

[15:05] spend twenty bucks make five hundred like you can do that flip and that's where

[15:09] you can make crazy money really quick and that's where that's the mean economic

[15:12] engine and so the role is don't be fancy do the basics all right so I had a

[15:20] really interesting business mentor who I called when I was considering selling

[15:25] my selling gym lunch years later he had been a private equity CEO and so all

[15:30] he did was basically they dropped the sky in when they buy company and then

[15:33] he would have the job of tripling it in three years or so and he had done it three

[15:37] times and so I'm on the phone this guy and I was like so what's your

[15:40] secret man and he's like don't be cute backyard football he's like it'll be

[15:44] tries to get cute get fancy you know when you're you're kid you're like okay

[15:47] so we're gonna do it with a double deep fake and we're gonna go a high to the

[15:51] right and we're gonna spin it back and then you're gonna toss it back to me and

[15:53] then Johnny's gonna go to the left and then we're gonna toss it to him and

[15:57] then and then we're gonna get the skin so he's like what happens I was like I don't

[16:00] know he's like you fucking fumble and you lose the ball right and you lose the

[16:03] game he's like no we play fondamentals football he's like two-fac guy's in the

[16:08] middle to the right he's like that's how we play he's like don't be cute I get

[16:12] to cute right I get fancy with my expenditures right but I also get to fancy

[16:16] my strategy just saying like we want to provide superior service very easy to

[16:19] say very easy to understand and if you do it well most people get it if you do a

[16:24] good job people tell their friends they come back like it makes sense but really

[16:28] hard to do how do you get all of your staff to smile how do you get all of

[16:31] your staff to remember people's names how do you how do you write handwritten

[16:34] cards on a systematic basis so that people see that you're going above and

[16:37] beyond like how do you do those things like that takes systems that takes

[16:40] effort right but the idea of just doing backguard football of just hey if we

[16:44] treat customers well they're gonna come back if we provide a good product they're

[16:48] gonna come back right we think through the details we actually drink our own

[16:50] cool aid we eat our dog food so that we know if something comes off I could

[16:54] write a book on business that if I just gave the people who buy companies who

[16:58] take me way less effort because I could just write it for them but to be able to

[17:01] write a book that somebody who has no idea how to run a business and somebody

[17:05] who buys companies can both get five out of five value from takes a shitload more

[17:09] work and so that's the kind of obsession that happens with product that when you

[17:15] start getting fancy you don't have time for a 4.4 product compared to a 4.7

[17:20] product and Amazon in the same category the 4.7 might get 10 times the sales

[17:26] you see a 4.4 and a 4.7 which when you buy it it's like it's obvious you're not

[17:30] buying the 4.4 neither does anyone else it's just a game of incremental

[17:33] improvements on the big basics that if you just get those right nothing else

[17:37] matters and I got really fancy and I got distracted from the thing that

[17:40] mattered most whatever that was me being fancy let's go back to partnerships

[17:43] so I had two different partnerships after the first four that I talked about

[17:47] where I said like you know what I've got my gym business thing going I'm going to

[17:51] start doing launches two and then I'm also going to start these agencies right

[17:55] and so I'm going to get partners because that's what smart people do I was

[17:58] still the main economic driver in all of them and so I was the one who was doing

[18:02] the sales and doing the delivery what is the partner right besides having the

[18:07] idea that we should start a business together all the partners I've had I've

[18:10] learned a ton from and I wish all of them the best and it was my

[18:14] deficiencies it was not their fault it was my fault like I shouldn't have made these

[18:17] mistakes which is why I'm making these videos so that you don't have to make them

[18:22] too I was the rainmaker if you're the one who brings them the customers and makes

[18:27] the money you should get a disproportionate share of the proceeds if the

[18:31] business can't function without you but it can function without them you are

[18:34] needed there or not and here's a really hard truth you might think man I need an

[18:38] accountant okay cool most businesses do in fact all businesses do but it doesn't

[18:44] mean that when I start a business I partner with an accountant just because I

[18:47] need it doesn't mean that they have to have equity in it and so just because

[18:49] you can identify a function in a business that is required in the beginning it

[18:53] doesn't mean that you have to have to give equity there like you can hire

[18:56] these people you can have vendors right you can other companies that do this

[18:59] for a living and then you just fractionalize the costs and you picked them and

[19:01] they have systems in place and at a certain point maybe bringing a house maybe

[19:04] you don't right but these are decisions that early on I made mistakes for and

[19:08] so the partners that I had had functions that they could do they just want

[19:11] core to the business does it get customers in the door is it part of how we

[19:15] deliver you acquire the customer you deliver on the customer that's it and so

[19:20] if they are not core to those things they are probably not people that you

[19:23] need to get equity to in the beginning or at least any meaningful share to a

[19:26] completely makes sense partnership is where one person in handles product is

[19:30] like I would just make sure our things absolutely exceptional and the other

[19:33] person's like I will tell the world about it a phenomenal split a great split

[19:37] that many people now I'm going to get to the the bad one now because I know

[19:40] you guys were waiting for it so I lost a lot of money a lot of money a lot of

[19:44] brain power when I got in bed with a very bad partner so I'm going to tell

[19:51] you what I did what I did wrong all right so this is number five bad

[19:55] partners now I had partners before and they were good partners we had bad

[19:58] partnerships this is bad partners so I want to be really clear about the

[20:02] difference all the partners I had before ethical find people nothing wrong with

[20:06] it we had a bad structure and so you have the person and you also have the

[20:09] structure of the relationship that both have to be aligned the bad partners

[20:12] I'll define as people who have in various intentions who actually want to

[20:15] hurt you this was actually the last partner that I took on so this was

[20:18] punishing enough that it was quote traumatizing it permanently changed my

[20:21] behavior and so I had just sold so I had six locations at this time with my

[20:26] gyms all right I had bought out some of my past partners which cost me a

[20:31] lot of money and so I had six locations now I shut down one because it was too

[20:34] new and I decided to switch gears because I wanted to start the licensing

[20:37] business and I sold five now I had big pile of money this is now like basically

[20:42] my egg what I have to show for it all this work and all the sack from

[20:45] estate in this point I've got this that's it I was doing gym launches at the

[20:47] time so this is why made the transition I started flying at the gyms started

[20:50] making money and I could do like a hundred thousand dollars in sales in about

[20:54] three weeks and I would keep that cash for myself because I had almost no

[20:57] cost besides my airfare my hotel and the ads been which usually for me was

[21:00] like one to three grand so not a lot and one gym owner was like hey you

[21:04] leave in so much money on the table red flag number one so much money on

[21:10] table you can't pursue every opportunity so it's the definition of entrepreneurship

[21:14] that you have to say no which means there's always money you could make you

[21:17] choose to leave small amounts of money on the table so that you can have the

[21:21] one pile of money that is on the table that you're choosing to play at get

[21:24] bigger he's like you're opening these gyms and you're filling them up to full

[21:27] capacity he's like you should own average gym owner makes 36 thousand dollars a

[21:30] year for full year of work working eight hours a week I was making a hundred

[21:33] grand in twenty one days and walking away way better business me being a

[21:37] moron I was like sure this is what I'm more on what to do so I should do it

[21:40] he says have it this I used to run this gym four point two million dollars

[21:44] year I know how to run a gym I don't know the marking sales stuff you go to

[21:48] the marking sales I'll come behind you and I'll run the gym after you so he's

[21:51] like every month you up in a gym you fill it up I'll come behind you all staff

[21:54] it he's like every month you can open a gym and I was like man that means

[21:57] at the end of the year I'll have twelve gyms that means that my ego will go

[22:00] up and I can tell people have told gyms so I launched his gym across that

[22:03] and so he's like hey so now let's do this next year as we're about to sign

[22:06] the least he says small detail you know I have a little bit of a bad credit

[22:10] situation big misunderstanding but you're gonna have to personally guarantee the

[22:14] least sure make sense where partners offer some guaranteed also I mean you just

[22:18] made all this money on gym you should run the cost for the new location and I

[22:22] said of course also you should run the whole thing and then I'll come after you

[22:27] I was like okay so I'll take the risk do all the money and do all the work and

[22:29] then you'll have half and you just like yeah I was like how steel what a great

[22:33] partner and so I crushed this launch to 370 sales in like six weeks like new

[22:38] members I put all the cash into the account like all this cash my big Easter

[22:42] because I didn't understand how money went and so I put all the money into the

[22:44] new bank account for the new ones because I was going all in on this new

[22:47] idea and then I wake up a morning because I would always check the bank

[22:49] account every morning because it was a habit all of a sudden it was at zero or

[22:53] close to zero it was actually just one withdrawal and it was to hit huh and he was

[22:57] like oh yeah I was just taking my half I know you're taking your half off top

[23:00] he's like I'm just taking my half he's like I did the math he's like this is

[23:04] how much my half should be and I was like first off you're accusing me of

[23:07] stealing second off what I had a coach at the time and I was like do what

[23:10] should I do pre-out the financials go line by line and show them where all

[23:14] the cost were and I was like okay so I printed all the all the expenses took me

[23:18] like three hours I'd am I say everything and I was like let's go have lunch and

[23:21] like let's go over this I put the papers down and he pushed them off the table

[23:24] I don't need to see that shit and I was like oh I just got robbed he ended

[23:30] up sending the money is to his girlfriend in Sweden and finally bankruptcy

[23:33] second so remember when I said like he said oh there's this big misunderstanding

[23:36] early on the whole least thing he had been in dieted for fraud before that I knew

[23:41] about I have my own demons of like I fucked up in the past two and I'm trying

[23:46] to you know do good now and so I want to always give people that benefit of

[23:50] the doubt and I'm gonna say something that probably won't be popular I don't

[23:52] do that much anymore there's just plenty of people I can partner with that

[23:55] I don't have to do with that for here's my little TLDR lesson on this if someone

[23:59] shows you who they are believe them the first time red flags are red flags

[24:04] four reasons I'm not even gonna tell you the amount of money that it was because

[24:07] I will tell you what's more important is that I lost all my money and what

[24:15] felt like years of work and so from a loss perspective it was the amount of money

[24:21] was one of the smaller ones in terms of total dollar amount that I lost but

[24:24] in terms of emotional significance I went from a multi-location gemowner to

[24:28] successfully exiting my gems to losing everything that I spent years building

[24:33] in six months use that lesson so you don't have to have the scar

[24:37] mistake number six is the classic example between push and pivot all right so if

[24:41] you don't know what the push and pivot that cotton is for most entrepreneurs

[24:44] most people in general say there's sometimes where shit gets hard and you need

[24:47] to push through it and there are other times where your fundamental assumptions

[24:50] are wrong and you need to pivot you need to change directions because the thing

[24:53] that you originally thought was true is no longer or you found out that it

[24:55] isn't and so the hard part is sometimes when you're in the thick of it you're

[24:59] not sure if this is a push or this is a pivot it's one of the hardest decisions

[25:02] in entrepreneurship there are dead bodies on either side of this road and it's

[25:06] hard because you just got to use judgment to be able to make the best guess you

[25:08] can and the thing is you can never replay the game so I graduated three years

[25:11] from Vanderbilt and I got a job in a management consulting firm that did

[25:15] space out of at least the project server was based out of intelligence

[25:17] of the military so as a BT firm fence caught tracking that's what I worked on

[25:20] sounded fancy that's why I took it when I was there I had the desire to learn I

[25:24] did learn a lot quickly in the beginning after that period of time which

[25:28] might be took 69 months I didn't feel like I had more to learn and so I had

[25:35] two options and I took neither of them and I think that was the real mistake

[25:38] I didn't push and I didn't pivot I did nothing I coasted I was actually in that

[25:48] job a fairly bad employee you can look at work environment you can look at

[25:51] people you work with I was a bad employee and I would actually group them I

[25:55] didn't get challenged in that last period and so I just read books all day at

[25:59] that point it was either a go to business school or starts something else and

[26:02] so that's why I decided to start something else if you are somewhere where you

[26:05] know deep down you are you are not living up to your potential and you are

[26:08] cutting corners and you're looking into clock and you're trying to just like

[26:10] count minutes and you're like holy shit it's only been an hour of seven hours

[26:12] of the shit like if you were living like that leave whatever the alternative is

[26:17] is better it was one of the most costly mistakes I made also because of what I

[26:20] started feeling about me you know what I mean because I was like am I a slacker

[26:24] do something just don't do this push pivot push being go up let me learn more

[26:30] give me a challenge pivot being I'm gonna change career paths I did nothing

[26:34] until it was forced upon me so that was mistake number six where I lost a lot

[26:38] of time and honestly a lot of self confidence during that period of time which

[26:41] cost me dearly later so my seventh thing mistake was actually getting to the

[26:49] food business now the food business per se is a mistake is like what does this

[26:53] have to do with me it actually has much more to do with getting to a product

[26:56] than I'd low understanding of and so I thought okay I'm in fitness I talk about

[27:02] nutrition I can start a food company right because we have this big distribution

[27:06] of gyms they already sell our supplements I went all over the US try to find

[27:10] co-bacters who could handle the volume that we could do basically overnight

[27:14] and scale which means I had to go to really big companies that can handle that

[27:16] kind of volume we did this big launch we did this big build up the first one

[27:20] sales were a little disappointing for me so we did like 600 thousand the first month

[27:23] now maybe like that sounds like a lot of money let me walk you through the

[27:26] margins of this business so 600 thousand dollars and you're like okay where's

[27:30] the mistake this day coming from don't worry we'll get there the average meal

[27:34] was 10 bucks so we were selling 60 thousand meals per month it's a lot of

[27:39] meals right a lot of meals you think wow this is a successful business well

[27:43] sounds good right times 10 dollars now here's part that no one wants to talk

[27:47] about in the food business my cost was nine dollars I had to cover every

[27:52] expense that I had in the business marketing sales payroll customer support

[27:58] refunds for shit that went bad boxes that broke all of that on this one

[28:04] dollar I was able to make in this business somewhere in the neighborhood of seven

[28:09] percent profit margins that's because I ran this as a skeleton business because

[28:13] I knew that it was low margin and I already had the supplement infrastructure

[28:17] for support and so that was a little bit of a help for why I didn't lose my

[28:21] complete ass on this here's a little fun stat for you 80 percent of my customer

[28:27] support complaints came from this 90 percent of my profit every month came from

[28:34] my supplements from that line of business so you mean to tell me I just five

[28:38] acts the amount of headache for an extra this much profit just because you

[28:43] don't lose money doesn't mean you didn't lose money honestly I might have made

[28:46] 500 grand on this whole thing but for the amount of work of me building up to a

[28:50] launch using some good well with my audience to say hey use these meals I

[28:54] had to hold separate website build out one if I had just done nothing and taking

[28:59] all of that effort and just put it into the other one that was making 10 times

[29:02] more money could I have made 10 percent more on that business to make up for

[29:05] this fuck yeah I could alternatively if I had just done a different opportunity to

[29:10] go pursue could I have made more money than I did on this one and the answer is yes

[29:14] and the main culprit was that I did not know what I was getting into I didn't

[29:18] talk to anybody in the food business and say hey tell me how you make money

[29:23] real talk the only guys I did know we're losing money the co-packer that I

[29:27] that I did this deal with was losing money you had to keep raising funding

[29:30] he was not profitable I didn't understand what I was getting into and I

[29:35] split focus and so right now more excited earlier about there's money on the

[29:41] table there was money on the table there was this tiny little pile of money

[29:44] and I decided to take my off the big pile of money and go on the small pile of

[29:49] money and I lost a year of effort and build up and marketing and sales that

[29:54] I could have just directed towards the big money and maybe growing that by

[29:57] 50 percent here I did all these new things had to figure all these new problems

[30:00] from ground zero and that's one of the biggest mistakes I made so many times

[30:04] in my entrepreneurial journey they now I'm so obsessed about you here be

[30:07] talked about more better more better more better because I had to learn the

[30:11] hard way of how many times I lost money splitting my focus when I could have

[30:14] doubled down to make so much more so this mistake realistically cost me probably

[30:19] about ten to twenty five million dollars reason being I ended up selling

[30:24] Jim launch and we had a big multiple on that and so if I've been able to just

[30:27] make two or three million dollars more in profit on my main business the would

[30:31] have resulted in ten to thirty million dollars more in money to me that's

[30:34] not hypothetical money like I did sell that company and it was based on

[30:37] profit and that took away from the profit I would have made so don't do that

[30:44] this is mistake number eight all right so I'm actually going to do this is a

[30:48] two-parter these are two separate mistakes that actually stem from the

[30:51] same principle so I had my lawyer situation and I had my payroll situation

[30:56] all right so I'll tell you but I wake up one day and I look at my emails and

[31:00] there's this email that says cost of living adjustment huh I look into it

[31:04] and it said you have a zero point zero zero cost of living adjustment so

[31:07] I meant I had no change and I was like I wonder if this was like a payroll

[31:10] change entity thing like they're re-organizing something whatever so yes

[31:14] who's one of our employees who's our executive assistant was like hey I just

[31:18] got a six thousand dollar raise thanks I was like Laila what she was like I

[31:25] don't know I'm figuring out right now we had a director of HR who lived in

[31:29] California and she had asked for a raise she was denied a raise because she

[31:33] didn't have enough experience with she will soon see why and so she took it

[31:38] on to herself to say well I deserve more money because I live in a more expensive

[31:42] area she then ordered a cost of living study on my dollar took that very

[31:47] expensive cost of living study and then looked at everyone's pay and said okay

[31:52] if you were living in an area where it's cheaper we're not gonna change how much

[31:56] you get paid but if you live in an area where it costs more we will pay you more

[32:00] now after making this decision you know literally the way she chooses to

[32:04] announce this is just a blast email to everyone with just the amount that they

[32:09] got paid more so like if I were actually gonna give everyone a raise I want to

[32:13] get some fucking credit for it you want to tie it to something that someone does

[32:16] so you can reward behavior that cost increase cost me 600 thousand year

[32:21] profit for zero additional anything by the way she was in California and so

[32:27] she got one of the largest cost of living increases under herself she cost me

[32:32] 600 thousand dollars a year everybody just gets a raise you now then say like

[32:36] just kidding she's an idiot like what do you do right like just kidding you're

[32:40] actually all not getting paid more very tough situation that I got put in so

[32:44] what we did was we got rid of her so she went from getting a 10 thousand

[32:48] raise to get a zero hey the reason I want money this is my principle I'm gonna

[32:51] give you no where the bodies are buried if you are too far away from departments

[32:58] if you say hey what's going on and they say everything's good and you don't

[33:02] know how to go one layer deeper because you are too far away it means that you

[33:07] don't know where the bodies are buried I don't need to know everything but I

[33:11] do need to know what problems that every department is struggling with just

[33:14] some aware so I can keep loops like updates on what's going on because I was so

[33:18] far away she was able to carry out a cost of living analysis and execute a

[33:23] company white pay raise all without me even knowing until it was way too late

[33:27] second mess up my CFO Suzanne came in to gym launch and she said hey are you

[33:33] guys in a lawsuit and I was like and I was like why do you say that she said well

[33:38] you have a legal expense it's 120 thousand dollars a month yeah that's like

[33:41] you're on a full-fledged like multi million dollar lawsuit that's going on

[33:46] with like litigation and arbitration all this shit and it's just like that's

[33:48] how much that cost and I was like oh I just deligated compliance to my team so

[33:53] then I clicked down a level and I was like hey what are we doing that's causing

[33:58] all these lower bills they're like oh well we do a we do a biweekly meeting

[34:03] with the entire legal team it's 150 dollar an hour lawyers two one hour

[34:08] meeting so we can you're like well that doesn't it just wait and then what

[34:11] they're reviewing is all the work that they're smaller attorneys that we're

[34:14] getting billed at 200 to 500 an hour are reviewing every piece of licensed

[34:20] marketing that we made and that we gave to our licensees and so we were creating

[34:24] tons of marketing hundreds of ads every single month we're creating tons of

[34:29] trainings hour long trainings two hour long trainings so if I did an a one-hour

[34:33] call every day to help my licensees I had four lawyers watching every hour and

[34:39] then sending notes on what I could have done to be more compliant now guess

[34:44] what I never read any of the notes and guess what neither did anyone else

[34:48] but because I said we need to make sure that we're compliant they said great

[34:52] lawyers what do we have to do to complete compliant they're like well why don't

[34:56] you just have us review everything and because I wasn't signing the checks and it

[35:00] was someone I was uncle Alex's money they were like oh great instead of us

[35:03] doing work we'll give it to this law firm they'll do the work for us and not only

[35:07] did they not actually implement anything from all the notes that came in

[35:12] from this they were happy to just have the meetings every because they

[35:14] started getting their buddy buddy with them and of course they were when you

[35:17] pay someone a million dollars a year it would be nice as fuck to you know where

[35:22] the bodies are buried part of the reason I brought a CFO it because I was doing

[35:25] other stuff she saved me you know for first much who's like well paid for

[35:29] myself already saved you million bucks a year which is true she just gave me

[35:32] million dollars you right I was very good for it I didn't have the ding on that

[35:35] because I was able to solve it but it cost me one point two million dollars

[35:42] so that's mistake number eight multi million dollar mistake let's go number

[35:47] nine you're like doesn't get worse I get so much worse I started off

[35:50] suffering on Alan use out it was because I wanted to solve the next problem

[35:54] the most Jim owner's had which is that they didn't work really so we could

[35:56] get leads for them we give them had to think you had leads for themselves but

[36:00] they wouldn't work the leads if you don't work the leads you don't make

[36:01] sales it's kind of worse I saw where AI was going and we're messaging was

[36:05] going versus pick up rates and I was like I thought that we could create like a

[36:09] really strong on me to buy with enough data and enough conversations that

[36:12] we could probably do as good of a job as kind of a low-scode employee it turned out

[36:16] that we were right and so the average front desk girl at the time or guy at

[36:20] the time would get 10% of losing the door and we got 19% of the door here was

[36:25] the mistake that I made so Alan was a purely software business I had never

[36:30] built software before I've never been a code before and so I did with all

[36:35] very impatient founders do I just said I'll just go find a software company and

[36:40] just have them built it for me and then I'll charge for it here's what

[36:48] actually happened so I went to the software vendor I went through this really long

[36:51] competitive process for people to bid the software out someone came in and

[36:56] said I can build it for you for like 100 grand or something like that I said

[36:59] sure fine let's do that the 100 grand came in and the thing wasn't

[37:02] really good but now I have some cost policies and I've put money into it and

[37:05] it may promises and so might find we'll keep going and so when it was said

[37:08] and done I think I put 1.0 something million into the software now you might

[37:13] be like okay well you spend a million bucks to the software company you

[37:16] had a big database you might have made sense it probably would make sense

[37:19] except once the software was operational and started making money who

[37:23] maintains the software the outsourced development team if you're an outsourced

[37:27] development team and someone needs you to make money and guess what they can

[37:31] see how much money it makes what do you do to your fees you just raise them you

[37:36] just keep eating it up and what else did they do they didn't document any of the

[37:40] code which meant that no one else could go in and start working on it we

[37:44] couldn't have an outside firm come take this off or over because there was no

[37:47] road map it was like writing a book with no table of contents they just

[37:51] consistently increased their fees to consistently reduce my margins until they

[37:56] ate up everything the mistake that I made in this big one was that you need to

[38:01] have a technical founder and the reason I believe that is that naming one

[38:07] massive software company that doesn't have a technical founder naming all

[38:11] weight a technical co-founder can hold them accountable right so you could have a

[38:15] technical founder and then have part of your team outsourced but the technical

[38:19] founder keeps them on it keeps them accountable make sure they're

[38:20] documenting things correctly keeps bidding things out and then over time you

[38:24] can start hiring people in house and name house doesn't even need to be

[38:26] US based in house could be overseas but they still work for you their

[38:30] loyal to you not to whoever their bosses you are the check who's not you this

[38:33] time obviously with school I'm not the person who is the technological person

[38:38] nor am I trying to contract that person I found the product just amazing

[38:41] amazing developers and they already had an amazing product and then I'm

[38:44] coming with it right I'm boosting on top of it remember I said the core

[38:48] engines of a business you either have to know how to get customers you have to

[38:51] know how to deliver I was trying to outsource the core value generation of the

[38:55] business to an outside company that is a fundamental mistake these guys

[38:59] businesses these dev shops they rely on you making this mistake unless you have

[39:04] a clear plan of having somebody in house who knows more than them about software

[39:09] who can hold them accountable who probably has to have equity to give a

[39:12] shit you are just going to be at their mercy over time I was able to

[39:16] sell to an actual software company that did have developers who could actually

[39:19] read into the stuff and they were able to retrofit the software and

[39:22] incorporated to their business so again I had this big pile of money that I could

[39:25] have just worked on doing more better of and yet again it's got distracted

[39:29] and you feel like keeping track you're like wait there was a food thing there's a

[39:32] software thing yeah like more on all right so like I share these lessons so

[39:37] that you don't have to as well okay multi-million dollar mistake number 10

[39:44] vendors this was one where we had a company I can tell you the amount well

[39:50] 15 million dollars real money all right so not not hypothetical not opportunity

[39:55] cost cost boss money we were building up for a big product launch in one of the

[40:01] companies we paid 270 thousand dollars for vendor literally for only one

[40:07] purpose was to have insurance that they could handle the volume that we're

[40:11] gonna push through this particular company was like we're pros of this is

[40:14] all we do that's what I'm paying this insurance bill for is that it goes okay

[40:18] as the launch approaches I hopped on like one of the vendor calls and the this

[40:21] was now one level of this was in the owner of the company this is one of his

[40:25] employees is like oh yeah this is crazy this is breaking all the records we

[40:29] have ever seen we've never seen anything like this before and I was like what I

[40:33] thought this is gonna be like another walk in the park like that doesn't

[40:36] sound good we're ever spitting up all these extra systems just to handle it but

[40:40] now we're like 24 48 hours out we wouldn't have changed this I think we're

[40:44] going to have been more risky to change at that point we we do the you know we do

[40:47] the launch even though it went quote well 75% of the traffic that was supposed

[40:53] to go to the launch didn't make it there after all the marketing after all the

[40:59] the leaking of the you know the stuff and the goodwill that was built in that

[41:02] company 75% didn't make it they lied just straight up they lied they lied because

[41:07] they wanted to build their resume because they wanted to say that they they were

[41:10] you know doing something with that particular company and put it on on their on

[41:14] their website or whatever if you're going with vendors with the founder of the

[41:18] company didn't do is that he didn't look for references didn't ask for a

[41:22] single person who had done this before at the size that they claimed they had

[41:26] done I want references just like me right just like just like whatever you're

[41:30] doing right references like you not just references but references like you or

[41:36] your use case so number one that never happened number two if someone shows you

[41:42] the way they are the first time believe them the first time all right there were

[41:44] flags that had happened early on we probably should not have ignored those flags I

[41:49] should have listened to that I fucked up that was on me everyone will lie to you

[41:53] and they'll lie even more if they benefit from association and so when you have a

[41:58] bigger company people will basically just promise that they can deliver for you

[42:02] because they want to stick your logo on their website references just like you

[42:06] who have done what you want to have done and if you have any semblance where the

[42:10] story doesn't match up when there's bad news it's always worse after it

[42:15] happens than when you think it could happen so as much as it could be bad news

[42:19] before and because it's gonna be more work for people it's a fuck load worse

[42:22] loose 15 million dollars on something that you spend nine months building up

[42:25] to less number three that I've learned about this referrals mean

[42:27] injection so if someone says hey I've got a great guy for this I say great I'm

[42:31] gonna treat you as though I don't know you I'm just going to give you the call I

[42:34] think setting that stage up front with any potential even it's like your

[42:38] closest friend has this guy who did all my T services or whatever it is or this

[42:42] guy did all my marketing services whatever I want to be really clear

[42:45] you helped Mike out you helped him out in a big way that's why we're on the

[42:49] call today but from this point going forward I'm an act as though I've never

[42:52] met you before and I'm gonna ask you for a lot of things for assurances to make

[42:56] sure that this goes well if someone gets weirded out by that walk away so this

[43:00] was 15 million dollars we got an eight figure losses now technically we had another

[43:04] eight figure loss earlier we're gonna start using ten thousand dollar bills

[43:06] that we're shredding all right you can take that to the big the last mistake

[43:13] this is the big boy this is the biggest of the one the worst mistake of all

[43:16] I'm like could it get worse than that I could get worse than that I mean the biggest

[43:21] mistake ever made before I get into it I want you to think how big of a

[43:26] mistake do you think it was like how much money get Alex really lost why you

[43:30] will find out shortly this one mistake lucky number 11 I actually made a

[43:34] pricing here this is 2019 things were going well business wise but like I

[43:39] felt things are going well on paper now but I feel like the trend is wrong like the

[43:43] five-business feel right like the comments I'm saying we're losing steam

[43:45] we're losing momentum there was a competitor in the marketplace who basically

[43:49] took all my top gyms and offered them a partnership and said just teach

[43:53] Alex's shit as though it's your own and then you guys can run this business I'll

[43:58] do all the ads and sales and then you guys do all the delivery they undercut me

[44:02] on pricing what I decided to do was I was like okay I'm gonna look at all the

[44:07] stuff that they're doing and all the stuff I'm doing and I'm just gonna take

[44:10] everything they do and just add it on top so I'm gonna do all the stuff we're

[44:14] already doing and add in a huge level of one-on-one which I'd never done basically

[44:18] accountability for all the gym owners so I took I took 35 of our best gyms and

[44:22] basically gave them status around specific skills that they were

[44:26] good at and then created group space revenue of the gyms and grouped

[44:30] them together with the gym owners that were a little ahead of them so they could

[44:33] kind of help them with the next step and then once you do that you love a lot

[44:36] you go to another group that was kind of the thinking mind we had all the stuff

[44:38] that we were doing that group gyms already and we had

[44:40] this huge accountability like very operationally complex component on top of

[44:44] it I thought to myself well not only am I gonna give more I'm gonna do it

[44:48] for less I went from $1,000 a week so 4k a month

[44:53] $800 a week now this doesn't sound like a big difference I made this change so I

[45:00] said I'm gonna do X I'm gonna do Y I'm gonna do Z I'm gonna do W I'm gonna do V I'm

[45:04] gonna do all of these things plus this this this that everyone else is doing

[45:10] and I'm gonna do it for less the first comment was a complete they were like

[45:17] you could have been charging me this the whole time fuck you which shot me

[45:20] less number one which is that whenever you change price people complete I

[45:23] literally lowered the price for everybody like grandfather lower not like new

[45:26] people everyone just pays me less tomorrow for the same thing but better and

[45:30] more the second thing that happened is that when you lose 20% of your top line

[45:35] revenue and you run 40% margins you lose half your profit you run 40% margins

[45:41] all right and if you take off all of this and then you deliver more this is your new

[45:51] margin and so the difference between this and this even though it doesn't seem

[45:56] like a lot changing from here to here lost me about 5 million year in profit I

[46:01] never recovered the additional $5 million in profit per year and so when I sold

[46:05] at a multiple that $5 million difference got multiplied by a big number that

[46:10] would be the entire suitcase worth a cash by a lot one all pricing changes people

[46:17] don't like it's more so that they just don't change the second thing is that I

[46:20] was not being proactive I was being reactive it was one of the first times when

[46:24] is this career where I was trying to respond to the market rather than trying

[46:27] to anticipate the market I was looking at other people's ads looking at what they

[46:31] were doing what they were talking about and I was like oh shoot we need to do

[46:34] that people are like you got to pay attention to your better's you got paid attention

[46:38] to your customers if you basically your customers your competitors are kind of

[46:41] rather I think Paul Graham said this he said every business problem can be

[46:46] solved by talking to your customers every business problem you can solve at the end

[46:50] of the day by talking to your customers core business problems finances go get a

[46:53] financial person like the point is is that the core engine got to talk to the

[46:56] customers that it is thick I only want to make what's so I'm going to take

[46:59] some more of this money and we're going to feed it in here and we're just going to

[47:04] keep feeding it in while we have probably have this time and just really think

[47:09] about this lesson that we all learn together about listening to our customers

[47:13] and not our competition keeping awesome love you I'll see you in the next one

[00:00] So it's talking to an entrepreneur who applied through acquisition.com to potentially become a portfolio company and one of the questions that I asked him on the call was

[00:06] So what's your LTV like how much you know how much you make per customer over lifetime and

[00:11] He honestly was like I don't know what what it is. I know I should know blah blah blah

[00:15] So I'm making this video so that you know one of the most important metrics in entrepreneurship

[00:19] And I'll give you three different ways you can calculate it. I'm gonna try and remember I had three before I start this video

[00:23] But one of my videos since I've forgotten so the first one and the easiest one to do this is off of lifetime

[00:29] The second way to do it is off of turn and the third way is to do it is off sales velocity

[00:33] All right, and I'll finish with sales velocity because it's the one that I use most frequently

[00:37] But all of these are good ways of getting it

[00:39] And it'll give you approximations and I'll explain how you took them is calculated now as a quick side note the reason that this is so important

[00:44] If you don't know I am

[00:45] I cuz this is not common on it

[00:46] We portfolio it is about 100 million dollars a year

[00:48] I just make these videos because I like doing this and I'm a crazy person and I am what appears to be looks like I'm in a closet

[00:53] Which I am actually in a closet because I don't like having windows where I work and I wear a wife beater

[00:58] And I've choice rather than necessity anyways, so let's rock and roll with the three ways to calculate LTV

[01:02] Okay, if you are a growing business this will under estimate your LTV

[01:06] But if you have especially recurring like recurring and it's you've been doing this for a while and you are growing what you do is

[01:11] Let's say that you did

[01:12] You know a one million dollars your one you did two million your two you did three million new three

[01:16] All right, let's just say that for simple example and let's say over over that entire period of time

[01:21] You sold let's say

[01:22] 600 customers, okay?

[01:24] So what you do here is you add these up which means you have six million in total sales lifetime over

[01:33] 600 total customers lifetime, all right, and so this will give you the the it's just this is again

[01:39] Back of napkin math of how to get to how much you make per customer

[01:43] So be six million divided by 600 which is probably like 10 grand. I'm guessing it's 10 get and

[01:49] So that would give you an under estimation because you will have customers

[01:52] We're still continuing to pay you so if you it gives you basically from the beginning until now

[01:56] But it doesn't take the future new account so it will be under what it is in theory

[02:00] But this will give you something to work off of so that's number one

[02:02] So that's this guy music give you a highlight that's this one all right now the second way that you can calculate LTV is

[02:09] Based on turn and if you don't know what turn is it's gonna be the percentage of customers that leave at the end of the month that we're here at the beginning of the month

[02:16] So let's say you have a hundred customers at the beginning of the month and let's say of those hundred you got 95 at the end

[02:20] Note that the amount of customers you sailed sold between here and here does not matter in this calculation

[02:25] All right, just because people get really fucked up with us

[02:27] So if a hundred customers at the beginning you have 95 at the end it means you had five that left and you do five

[02:34] Divada by 100

[02:37] Right, which means you have five percent turn. All right. That is your turn very simple. Okay

[02:42] Now if you're like well I had some people cancel beginning again all of these eroff estimates

[02:46] Because you can't ever have a beautiful snapshot in a business ever because time is a component that fudges the world

[02:51] All right, so once you have turn

[02:53] This is how you use that turn so you take your price your average monthly price so let's say you've got a hundred people and

[03:00] You're making whatever hundred thousand dollars a month

[03:03] So you've got a hundred k per month divided by hundred people which means you're making a thousand dollars per month per client

[03:09] That says client go for it. Okay. It's a client. So that's our average price

[03:12] When we divide that which is this thing right you divide that buy your turn

[03:17] So a thousand divided by five percent would be 20 x

[03:22] one k which equals 20 k so that is your LTV and so if I had this business and let's say they were stable at a hundred thousand dollars a month

[03:30] I would know that they are probably only selling five new clients a month

[03:33] But interesting now if they're selling more than that then I know that they are actually growing and they haven't realized or tapped out with their with their new

[03:39] Revenue threshold is going to be kind of interesting. This is why it's important to know this stuff is an entrepreneur because you might be like

[03:44] Why is it growing faster?

[03:45] But if you're in the situation you've got five percent turn you're doing a thousand dollars a month

[03:49] You've got a hundred customers and you're selling 20 a month then your hypothetical max is gonna be 400 k

[03:54] So you don't need to change anything you just got to wait and you're gonna hit four hundred k a month

[03:57] All right, that's why LTV is so important to understand how to calculate it all right

[04:01] So you can do it off lifetime which I showed you first the second way you can do this off turn and the third way is off sales velocity

[04:06] And this is the one that I do most commonly and the reason for that is because the lifetime

[04:11] I mean it'll give you an approximation and this is important especially if you have like a low

[04:15] Price very high volume like recurring membership lifetime one is helpful with turn

[04:21] You can do this

[04:22] That one is also useful for that, but it's more of a hypothetical and sometimes it overestates it

[04:27] So you're gonna want to average out your turn because let's say you get five percent turn one month

[04:30] But you had 20 the month before and 13 the month that you know before that

[04:34] So you want to average your turn on billiard all right, well we average 12 percent right and then you use that as the turn number

[04:39] That you use the calculation to calculate for the business and you want to do it the most recently because if you all of a sudden

[04:43] Start selling more but then your turn goes up that is the new those are the new metrics your business

[04:46] You can't use your turn from a year ago when you were only selling one off people and now you have a sales machine

[04:51] But you're not doing as well on fulfillment because you don't have enough personalized attention, right?

[04:54] That's why this is so important now sales velocity this is the third way to calculate this so sales velocity number three is you say

[05:00] How many people are you selling for month? You just ask them and you can say like last three months. What do you average it?

[05:05] Let's say they say 10 people per month is what we're averaging in new sales

[05:08] All right, this is important new sales now. I'll say what are you doing in revenue now?

[05:13] The reason the sales velocity one are the conditions in which this one works is if the revenue has remained

[05:19] Relatively the same so for the last three or four months

[05:21] Let's say they've been at a hundred thousand ish a month, right now that they're they're at a point of stagnation

[05:26] All right, or close enough stagnation that we can use it for a calculation

[05:29] So let's say a hundred came on this what they were averaging in their business and they're selling 10 ten deals a month

[05:34] You know, or this is going then I can tell them that the rough estimate for their LTV is gonna be 10k and

[05:40] That gives you a good idea because if they're just maintaining it this then it means they're losing some

[05:44] They're gaining new ones and they're staying at that level which means they've already hit that point of equilibrium

[05:48] And so all of the thing with LTV is the relationship between sales velocity and how much your clients worth and so the

[05:55] Turing calculation showed a little bit more depth around pricing and turn to get the LTV right number

[06:00] But all that gets around to answer the simple question is how much the customer worth to us and then from there

[06:04] We can make better decisions and so when we're looking at companies

[06:07] We want to see companies with strong LTV's or the potential to have strong LTV's so that in the future

[06:11] We could spend more in the acquisition and scale the business right and a lot of times this is one of the weakest points in

[06:18] In companies especially in that three to 10 million dollar range is that they don't actually make enough per customer

[06:21] They're more targeting squeeze which compresses their ability to scale. I'm gonna go a little deeper on this on this concept of using LTV to project and

[06:28] I just want you guys to know like I'm not an Excel way

[06:30] It's like I'd learn this stuff because like I'm just not I just haven't naturally been that good at it

[06:34] So I had to learn the back of napkin way of doing business and I'll be wrong with you just about every major business

[06:38] This year and I make I just make it on back of napkin because even the most precise calculations

[06:42] Can still be done off of rough data sets and so you got to just understand like where your gut is and just kind of like the directional math around the stuff

[06:48] So let's say we have I'm gonna give you two scenarios

[06:51] So I'll give you scenario a scenario big this is important because it will help you make decisions for your business about what to do to grow

[06:56] All right, so let's see we've got a business that's selling let's say 10 people a month and they're doing

[07:02] $100,000 per month and their turn is and let's say their their price point is whatever

[07:08] Let's say it's five thousand dollars a month is the price of what they're selling for these 10 people right and let's say their turn is

[07:15] 20% right so that's that's the numbers that we haven't scenario one right?

[07:18] So this is new sales and let's say we have the same the same ones so we have new sales that say it's 10

[07:24] Let's say price points five k month and let's say that they're doing

[07:27] 500 k per month and their turn is 20% now

[07:31] Let's see the difference between these two scenarios all right

[07:34] So if we have a 10 k per month sorry 10 10 clients per month and they're selling it five k and we know

[07:41] Churn is 20% then what do we have to figure out we've to figure out the lifetime value right and so if we take the five k per month

[07:47] And we divide it by the 20% turn we're gonna have a 25 k LTV

[07:51] Right this makes sense now if we're selling 10 new people a month then it means that this business is going to continue to grow

[07:58] And it'll slow down at 250,000 per month

[08:01] This is a back-of-nab in way that you can do projections

[08:04] So think about it if we have 10 new clients and they're signing up at 5,000 dollars

[08:08] We're adding 50,000 a month, but we're also losing 20% and so as we the first month will make 50 the next month

[08:15] We'll do 50 plus 40 right the next mother do 50 plus 40 plus 30 right so it continues towards this asymptote

[08:21] Which means it approaches zero but it approaches a number, but it doesn't actually hit it

[08:25] So this is the asymptote

[08:26] So 250 250,000 is the asymptote and at that point we'd have to change something the business we have to change the price

[08:31] We have to change terms the churn we'd have to change the number of

[08:34] New sales that are happening in order to grow this business now if I'm talking to somebody here or you are that person there

[08:39] Then I know that this thing is growing which is great even if we change something the business is going to continue to grow awesome now

[08:45] Here's the flip side let's say we have that same scenario

[08:47] 10 five except the only difference here is it's at 500,000 a month, right?

[08:51] Well, if we know that this thing is going to cap out right at 250 k the line's gonna look different

[08:57] Because it's gonna do this so it's gonna drop dramatically in the beginning and then it's gonna even out at 250 k

[09:02] So if I'm talking to this business then I know that they're at 500 today and this guy's at 100 k today

[09:08] But they're both going towards 250,000 because that is the reality of the business

[09:12] So if you're selling 10 a month at 5 k with 20% churn your business does 250,000

[09:17] That is what I want you to take away with this is that you will know and understand what your

[09:21] Cap rate or your hypothetical max is for your business simply by doing the math and so you'll know if you have the capacity to grow

[09:27] You are you are on a shrinking curve or which common is your in scenario C

[09:32] Right, which is your at 250,000 a month you're selling 10 people per month at

[09:37] 5 k per month in your churn 20% and you're stagnant like this

[09:41] Which means that one of these things must change?

[09:44] We either have to sell more people we've got to change the price

[09:47] We got to add add some zeros to the price or we have to fix the churn

[09:51] Now here's where it's kind of interesting if we can fix the churn of this business

[09:55] Let's say we just get it from 20% to 10% turn doesn't seem like it's a big difference doesn't it's a hell of a difference

[10:01] And so if you're thinking about the levers that you're gonna point your business

[10:04] You could say all right if I wanted to get to let's say a million a month

[10:08] Which is probably common for somebody who's at this stage right?

[10:10] They want to get to a million a month. That's their next objective

[10:12] Well, let's talk about the ways they can get there all right scenario number one to get to a million a month

[10:16] We start selling 40 people a month right and change nothing else start selling 40 people a month equals one million per month

[10:22] All right because we just four acts this number the second way we can get to a million dollars a month is we could four acts this price

[10:28] We can start selling 20k per month, right with the same number of sales and now get us to a million a month

[10:34] Assuming turns stays the same the third scenario is that we would say that's this one the third scenario is that we would reduce churn to five percent and change nothing else

[10:42] Which of these seems easiest well for Xing price might be difficult right that might be?

[10:47] Uh, has a you know represents a serious risk to the likelihood that you know the value exchange might not be there

[10:51] And so you probably not choose this guy this one probably wouldn't be the first bet

[10:56] Right so then you're pretty much left with I'm going to either

[11:00] Four acts the number of sales which means I guess been one money on ads or I got to do more reachouts

[11:04] I got to do more posts or get more affiliates or get more word of mouth, whatever or I got to work on my back in and reduce churn

[11:11] Here's the interesting tidbit if you fix this right if you fix that

[11:16] It's easier to fix churn and then do this and then all of a sudden you're at four million

[11:22] This is why business is fun and so that is how like that's how we approach business problems and

[11:27] I'm not going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going to do that. I'm going

[11:57] to keep the business afloat even though you know that you have this 20% term which is killing your business. In order to make this thing a sellable business or have a business of value or enterprise value, we have to fix the product.

[12:08] We have to fix the client experience so that people actually want to keep it to pay for this thing. I guess my formula and the mouth got cut off here.

[12:15] There you go. This is how you can fix the back end first. Then you have to have your LTV quadrupled. Now you can go and spend whatever you want in the acquisition.

[12:25] It's still be profitable. Whereas in this scenario, you probably have to compress your margins because usually when you increase acquisition margin to get compressed.

[12:33] But you already compressed them. Like you didn't expand them to begin with. So let's say you read a 30% margin and you forex your sales. Now you're at a 10% margin. That sucks.

[12:40] And so what we want to do is we want to expand the margin expand the lifetime growth profit per customer by extending the LTV through turn and creating a better experience better product product market fix.

[12:49] And then at that point, then you can open up the opportunity to scale it crazy.

[12:54] And so this is definitely a more technical video than I normally make and that is because I like to mix it in with some of the life stuff because I do love business.

[13:02] Probably more than just about anything business is awesome. And so if you can speak in these terms, you will impress people and more importantly, you will impress yourself because you'll have more tools in your entrepreneurial toolbox.

[13:12] And if this was at all interesting to you, please let me know in the comments. Because I'll make more maybe a little series on entrepreneurial toolkits or things like that.

[13:20] But otherwise, keep being awesome.

[13:21] Moseenation. I love you. If you don't know why I am or you're near the channel, my name is Oxermosie and ecstasy.com.

[13:25] We're full of companies that's 100 million dollars plus a year.

[13:27] Alright, keeping awesome, see you next video.

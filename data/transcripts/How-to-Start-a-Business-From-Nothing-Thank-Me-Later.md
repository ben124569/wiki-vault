[00:00] I made my first 100,000 dollars when I was 20 years old when I opened my first gym location.

[00:04] In this video, I'm going to cover everything I learned from that.

[00:07] And so first, it's going to be how I started it next, my first 100,000, and then third,

[00:11] and most importantly for you, the lessons and tactics that I still used to disdain that

[00:15] you can use to to hobby your business.

[00:17] And it felt appropriate to film this video in my current gym in the background because this

[00:22] is where I kind of had all started from.

[00:23] So let's talk about how this even started.

[00:25] The reason this was the riskiest move in my life was that one quitting my job as a artist

[00:30] thing I ever did.

[00:31] Two, it was during a time where the economy still wasn't like roaring.

[00:34] It was like, you need to kind of okay.

[00:35] And I had saved up $50,000 for my job.

[00:38] Now I spent 10 to get into the group for the gym owners.

[00:42] I actually signed up for a gym mastermind and I didn't have a gym.

[00:46] So I had like 40,000 left.

[00:48] And then I spent 34,000 dollars opening up the location.

[00:51] So I had $6,000 left.

[00:53] I signed you, the rent was five.

[00:56] And so I had exactly the amount of money required to have like one month.

[01:01] And so I was like, oh my god, oh my god, what am I gonna do?

[01:03] And so it was by chance that I went to a different seminar that taught about this thing called

[01:06] Facebook ad.

[01:07] And so I ended up running an ad and here's the craziest thing of all.

[01:10] I actually found this out years later.

[01:11] $4,972 in cash collected in the first month.

[01:16] And my rent was $4,972.

[01:19] I only found this out years later when I looked at my processing records.

[01:22] And I was like, I'm not a divine, you know, dude, but wild.

[01:27] And so I basically had no money at all.

[01:29] My money was in the gym equipment.

[01:30] And I spent the thousand bucks basically that I had on these ads.

[01:33] And so when I started this, what I was like, man, this is, this is hard.

[01:37] So first big lesson that I learned was when you're poor, barter.

[01:41] All right.

[01:42] And so I had basically no money.

[01:43] And so, but I needed stuff.

[01:45] So I needed people who could train.

[01:47] I needed people who could clean.

[01:49] And so I had people come in and be like, I can't afford to do this.

[01:52] And I'd be like, hey, well, you want to clean the gym.

[01:55] And if you clean the gym, I'll let you turn the classes.

[01:57] Because the, like, someone else attending a classroom, he wasn't really any cost for me.

[02:01] And I mean, my cost for fix.

[02:02] So anything that I could basically barter for $200 a month or $300 a month of services,

[02:08] I would just, I did everything like that.

[02:10] I was like, hey, can you fix my computer?

[02:11] One personal training?

[02:12] Like, I did that.

[02:13] Like, I got my first printer and scanner from a guy who had an IT company.

[02:18] Because he felt bad for me because I was doing everything on paper.

[02:21] And he said, you shouldn't do this.

[02:22] And I just did PT lessons for him so that he would pick for that.

[02:25] And so like, I just, I borrowed it like crazy.

[02:27] I still barter this day because guys, it's tax efficient.

[02:31] Neither party has to pay taxes on anything, right?

[02:33] It's the most efficient form of trade.

[02:35] So if you have the opportunity to do it, do it.

[02:37] On top of that, I actually had a client who was a food, like a food prep person.

[02:42] And so they would end up bringing a refrigerator and I could eat the food that they

[02:47] would bring for free for having access to my member.

[02:49] So like I'm saying literally everything.

[02:51] My laundry, I had a different client who did my laundry for me.

[02:54] Like everything that would take any of my time or money, I just traded for so that I could

[02:58] spend all my time in the gym just trying to make this thing work.

[03:01] So if you're like, okay, well, how do I apply this to make?

[03:04] Look at every single line item that you have on your expenses, right?

[03:08] Like your credit card or whatever your bank account.

[03:09] And anything that I had, I just tried to find somebody who did that thing.

[03:13] And I just was opportunistic looking.

[03:14] If somebody came in and they're like, oh, I do.

[03:16] Because I was always like, oh, what do you do?

[03:17] And they would tell me, I'm like, oh, I actually need one of that.

[03:20] One of, I want to do this.

[03:22] And this happened a lot.

[03:24] And I would just keep asking for less and less service until it was the amount of money

[03:28] that was the equivalent of a membership.

[03:29] And then I was like, sick, let's do that.

[03:30] My first ads, I got a videographer who came in because it was California, right?

[03:34] And this guy comes in.

[03:35] He's a small time videographer.

[03:37] And he was like, I can't afford this.

[03:39] And I was like, well, I can't afford you.

[03:40] So, and so he recorded my first, some of my first ads for the gym, which actually ended up

[03:44] in a project.

[03:45] And so, just you got like, bartering is one, but I'll put it second here, which is like,

[03:49] be creative.

[03:50] And I think in order to do this too, is that you just can't have an ego.

[03:53] Now, I was lucky that I was 23 and, you know, poor.

[03:58] And so like, I had no shame for asking.

[04:00] I was like, please, that's like, help.

[04:02] I like, I need it.

[04:03] And so I think that a lot of, I'll just, I'll be honest with you guys.

[04:06] I see a lot of y'all's Instagrams, you know, who you are.

[04:08] And a lot of you guys are posturing and pretending like you have something that you don't.

[04:12] And it actually, I think it actually does a lot of disservice to you.

[04:15] Because if you're like, hey, I need help.

[04:16] Hey, I'm trying to build this thing.

[04:18] People will reach out and help.

[04:19] People will be way more willing.

[04:20] If you pretend like you're, you know, you've got it all figured out, no one's going to

[04:24] try and help you.

[04:25] And I think at that time, it's like, when you're earlier on, is when you want all the lessons,

[04:28] you want all the favors you can get.

[04:30] And the way that I could get extra calories in is that I would actually, uh, with the

[04:34] food prep stuff, I would sell clients on food prep.

[04:37] And sometimes some of them wouldn't pick up all their meals.

[04:39] It happens.

[04:40] I would wait for the food to expire and then it's so expired.

[04:43] We weren't allowed to distribute it anymore.

[04:45] And so I would just take it and I would eat all of the expired.

[04:49] It's fine.

[04:50] I call the people if they didn't respond, then I would take it.

[04:52] And that's how I fed myself.

[04:54] And for those of you who have a moral quandary with me, suck it.

[04:56] Next thing, boy, what was trying to eat?

[04:58] I was growing.

[04:59] All right.

[05:00] Now, number two is that when you're early, you need tactics, right?

[05:02] Which is why I make a lot of the videos that I do.

[05:04] I actually be fair.

[05:05] You need tactics at all levels.

[05:06] But especially when you're starting out because you're not really thinking in terms of

[05:08] strategy.

[05:09] Shoot, what fires do I have in front of me?

[05:11] I got to pay bills like let's get this done.

[05:12] And so I joined this mastermind of a guy who had a really successful gym,

[05:15] same back to you are.

[05:16] And he had a group of, I think, probably like 30 or 40 gym owners who kind of paid him

[05:20] to kind of learn some of the stuff.

[05:21] And yeah, so I showed up to this first mastermind and I'm 22 years old at the time.

[05:25] And I didn't own a gym.

[05:27] But the most valuable thing that I got is so many mistakes that I didn't have to make

[05:30] that all of these guys had made when they started their gyps.

[05:33] And so I just went around the room and I was like, hey, so what kind of location were you

[05:37] looking for?

[05:37] And they were like, oh, definitely don't do it in these

[05:39] markets.

[05:40] You definitely want to have this kind of square footage.

[05:42] Try to get a layout that only has this much office and this much, where else it was like,

[05:46] and they're like, oh, yeah, parking, make sure you, and so all of these things.

[05:48] And I was like, okay, what I'm going to buy this is going to go, oh, no, don't buy that

[05:50] equipment.

[05:51] That's how spiritually fast.

[05:52] Fry for this brand.

[05:53] And I've got a guy I hook you up with him.

[05:54] And like within the first conversation, I was like, oh my god, I saved the entire cost of

[05:58] what I paid in the first day.

[06:00] And basically that was such a reinforcing experience for me that whenever I enter anything,

[06:05] I always just pay if I can to just get access to people already doing it.

[06:09] And they can just tell me all the mistakes that I can avoid upfront in this why I invested

[06:13] in the school.

[06:14] Like, I think communities are the future anyways.

[06:15] They also told me, so on top of that, what I would do is on my weekends when I had

[06:19] time, which was basically never, but when I did have time, I would make weekend trips to

[06:22] the other gym owners in the community.

[06:24] And so then I would just basically shadow them and pester them like a leech.

[06:28] And I would just ask as many questions like, I'm like, why did you do that?

[06:32] And then when they sign up, what do you do?

[06:33] Where do you put the contract?

[06:34] I asked 100 questions.

[06:35] But the thing is, all these guys are older than me.

[06:37] And they kind of felt bad.

[06:38] They were like, yeah, this is what I do, this is what I just took every note I possibly

[06:41] cut.

[06:42] And so I think the meta lesson for me was that the thing that has carried me into this day

[06:45] has just been the intention to keep learning.

[06:47] And I think that life like for me, the meaning of life is learning, is to change behavior

[06:50] based on the conditions.

[06:51] And so I hope that I live the end of my life differently than I do now, hopefully I'll

[06:54] have learned.

[06:55] And so I went out with gyms, I asked tons of questions.

[06:58] And all of those little things that I learned, I would try and not all of them worked,

[07:02] obviously.

[07:03] Some of them did.

[07:04] And so I just tossed out the stuff that didn't work.

[07:05] I wasn't like screw that guy for trying to help me for free, because he gave me a

[07:09] tactic and work.

[07:10] I was like, well, he gave me another one that did.

[07:11] So works for me.

[07:12] And so I'll give you this little thing, which is that when you're starting out, it's actually

[07:15] one of the only times that people are willing to help you.

[07:17] And so take advantage of that.

[07:18] Like this is a strategic advantage that you have when you're starting out, is that people

[07:21] are willing to help, especially other entrepreneurs.

[07:23] It's like fairly common.

[07:24] Like most entrepreneurs are willing to help people who want to stay up behind them.

[07:27] Now, this was a big mistake that I made, which is number three, which after I learned

[07:31] this, I'd forever change how I do every business, which is that pre-cells.

[07:35] So I thought that the way that I should make money, because I was like, I don't have any

[07:40] money, I need to start this gym as fast as possible in order to make money completely

[07:44] wrong.

[07:45] We need to start doing a marketing and selling as fast as possible and then delay delivering

[07:48] as long as possible, because every location I opened after my first after having learned

[07:52] this lesson, I was like, oh, we're going to pre-cell for three months.

[07:55] And we're just going to keep marketing, keep selling, keep collecting cash, keep getting

[07:57] members, keep getting members, keep getting memberships, right?

[07:59] And then only, like, basically as long as possible, because that's when all your cost start.

[08:03] So it's like, just market and sell, get people to pre-pay for three months, six months,

[08:08] a year, get people into, in a trial and the memberships that kick in later, like, whatever

[08:13] you need to do in the beginning to just start kind of with a bang.

[08:17] And so if you're brick and mortar more than anything, obviously every kind of business would

[08:20] benefit from a grand opening strategy.

[08:22] But if you're brick and mortar, grand opening strategy is one of the core ways you scale.

[08:27] Like you cannot scale without having a killer grand opening strategy.

[08:30] Look at every brick and mortar, retail, food, gyms, like, you know, massage, it doesn't

[08:36] matter.

[08:37] They have a crazy grand opening strategy, otherwise it takes way too long to get your

[08:42] money back, right?

[08:43] You have to be able to get to be profitable as soon as you really possible.

[08:45] And so what I did with pre-cells, as I got more sophisticated, is that if I, instead of being

[08:50] like, oh, I think I would open up a location in, you know, La Habra, what I would do

[08:54] is I would run ads, so I'd spend like $500 or $1,000 in five or ten markets.

[08:59] And I would see where I got the lowest lead costs.

[09:01] And so as soon as I saw that, I was like, oh, well, some people are like, oh man, it's

[09:05] such like, do that guy's market is so easy compared to mine.

[09:08] And I'm going to be real with you.

[09:09] Some markets are easier than others.

[09:11] Like there are better and worse markets, absolutely for any type of service.

[09:15] But guess how you can pay down that risk?

[09:17] So instead of signing a lease, doing a buildout, and then beginning to market to figure out

[09:21] whether it's a good location or a do it first, worst case scenario, you spend the

[09:26] $5,000 or $10,000 in ads across 10 locations.

[09:29] And you pick a perfect spot, a one out of 10 spot rather than a who knows what location.

[09:34] So instead of rolling the dice, pay $10,000 for pre-cell insurance of checking.

[09:38] And it's like, okay, if you're wondering, well, what do you do when people opt in and

[09:43] then you don't have a location?

[09:44] Do you with 99% of business owners do anyways, ignore the leads?

[09:47] Right?

[09:48] That's what everyone else does.

[09:49] So like, don't worry about it.

[09:51] Like, you'll be okay.

[09:52] They'll just keep living their lives.

[09:53] And you paid at Google and Google, got there better fit and everybody's happy, right?

[09:56] But you get to avoid signing a five year lease for 500 grand or whatever it is that you're

[10:00] signing for a bad spot.

[10:02] And not to be really clear.

[10:04] Duh.

[10:05] I can't give up.

[10:06] I have to say this.

[10:07] Don't sell shit that you're not going to deliver.

[10:10] If for whatever reason, you think you're not going to open up a location.

[10:13] For, for f*** sake.

[10:14] Don't take money and not deliver.

[10:17] Like a really great way to just have people hate you.

[10:20] So don't do that.

[10:22] And get in trouble.

[10:23] Don't do it.

[10:24] So the next big lesson I have was variation in ads.

[10:27] All right.

[10:28] So I'm explaining this, this skill ended up benefiting me for the rest of my life.

[10:33] And so when most marketers advertise on a national level, they get really lazy.

[10:37] Because they're used to running an ad and having an ad work for a month, two months, three

[10:41] months, sometimes like YouTube has a run for six months.

[10:43] I wasn't that guy at all.

[10:45] I had to make new ads every week because my local market is so small.

[10:51] And so in the, in the hundred million dollars offers the last chapter, I talk about the magic

[10:56] headline formula.

[10:57] And so basically what I figured out was that I can't, I don't want to change my service.

[11:02] Right?

[11:03] I don't want to start like offering back misoges or something at my gym.

[11:05] Like that, I don't, you don't want to change your core thing.

[11:07] But what I want to do is change the wrapping paper.

[11:10] So the same present, I just present it differently.

[11:13] And so that's how I got, you know, that's how I figured out.

[11:15] Oh, okay.

[11:16] Lean my Halloween.

[11:17] Slim for Santa.

[11:19] Big booty boot camp.

[11:20] 42 day detox.

[11:21] 42 day fix.

[11:23] 42 day transformation.

[11:25] Six week transformation.

[11:26] Six week challenge.

[11:27] Like I learned how to permuteate my promotional headlines because I had to.

[11:33] And then later on, and once I went to a national level, I was willing and able to make

[11:36] so much more variation in my ads and my copy and my lead magnets than my competitors.

[11:40] All of them were spoiled in this world where they only have to make a couple ads a month.

[11:44] I was like, I'm used to making 20 or 30 a week.

[11:47] And so this is where I actually learned both the volume of creative and the variation.

[11:52] And it's really just slight variation in the naming conventions of the promotions that I'm

[11:57] running.

[11:58] All right.

[11:59] So you want to make it look like a different offer, but you're still, I mean, what's

[12:01] it going to be?

[12:02] It's going to be your workout a couple times a week, eat differently.

[12:04] If you have a trainer.

[12:05] Like the core deliverables is the same.

[12:06] It's not going to change.

[12:07] And you just change the way it looks, the change the way it feels and that's what keeps

[12:10] it new at a market.

[12:12] Yeah.

[12:13] And what's changed between what I learned this lesson in today is that the creative itself

[12:18] is part of the targeting now.

[12:20] And so who you have in the ads like like attracts like.

[12:23] And so if you want more girls, have more girls in the ads.

[12:25] Well, more guys have more guys in the ads.

[12:26] One big jack guys have more big jack guys.

[12:28] If like, and so this is something that is more new now than then because then the targeting

[12:32] was much more basic.

[12:34] But big picture, if you're local, you don't need to work too much about this because

[12:37] you're just going to drop a pen and say everybody in this local area.

[12:40] But as you go national, that's where it becomes a little bit more important.

[12:42] And real quick, I spent 200 hours this year just making this one project for you, which

[12:49] is the $100 scaling roadmap.

[12:50] And a broke up, the stages of business in a 10 stages.

[12:54] And you can identify where you're at by simply just putting in your business information.

[12:58] You go to acquisition.com for slash roadmap.

[13:00] And it'll spit out this custom report that tells you what the constraints are at that current

[13:04] level and what you need to do to graduate and get to the next level.

[13:07] This is our gift to you, absolutely free.

[13:09] On the thank you page, you can book a call with our team and we'd love to help you figure

[13:12] that out and ideally get past it.

[13:14] So this is how it was generating leads.

[13:16] But then what was the actual offer that really like made or broke the business?

[13:21] Right?

[13:22] And so this is where I learned the six week challenge offer.

[13:25] And the six week challenge offer is a win your money back offer.

[13:29] And there was also an unconditional money back here in T.E that I paired with this.

[13:34] So it just made it an absolute hurricane of an offer.

[13:37] And if you curious about guarantees, I have a chapter on guarantees in general, the guarantee

[13:42] formula, which is just if you don't achieve x by y time, I will z, which is what's the consideration.

[13:48] So you have some sort of thing you're promising.

[13:50] There's some sort of timeline you're promising at all and some terms.

[13:53] And then you have what you'll give in consideration.

[13:55] And so one of the big mistakes people make when they're doing any kind of guarantee offers

[13:58] is that they say, I guarantee this.

[13:59] Yeah, but you have to say the or white, right?

[14:02] The or else.

[14:03] And it's the or what that gives the guarantee power.

[14:06] There's the word guarantees not going to do nearly as much as the stakes you're putting on

[14:09] the line.

[14:10] Now inside of the book, I actually have 11 of my favorite guarantees that have I have

[14:14] used and work.

[14:16] And so you can you can check those out.

[14:18] But the two guarantees that I use most frequently were a service base guarantee and an

[14:22] unconditional guarantee.

[14:23] All right.

[14:24] So let me explain what those are.

[14:25] So a service base guarantee is, hey, I'm an W chief x by y, but if you don't, I'll continue

[14:30] to work with you until you do.

[14:32] Now this matters more importantly when there's actual cost associated with delivery.

[14:36] If you're like, I will, you're your digital person.

[14:39] It's like, yeah, you get access to this course for six weeks.

[14:42] And if you don't hit the goal, you keep getting access for another six weeks.

[14:45] It's like, access is not that valuable of like I didn't hit it.

[14:50] But we were actually training people.

[14:51] And so for me, that was like real stakes on the line.

[14:54] And it was very compelling.

[14:55] The second guarantee that I offered was an unconditional guarantee, which is that during the six

[15:01] weeks, if at any point, you feel like you haven't gotten $500 of value from us in the

[15:07] pit of your results, I'll give you the money back.

[15:09] I says that means that five weeks, six days and 23 hours from now, if you don't think

[15:14] that we gave you the value, I'll give you the money back.

[15:16] And I'm telling you, like, that closed so many sales for me.

[15:20] And because we really obsessed on delivery, my team knowing that that guarantee exists,

[15:25] forced them to just love a lot, and be like, we just have to bring it every day.

[15:28] And I want to tell you the actual number, which is over the years of doing it, I had two

[15:33] people who asked me for the money back on the unconditional.

[15:36] Now, there were people who obviously hit the goal of losing 20 pounds in the six weeks,

[15:40] and they won it, which is fine.

[15:41] And that was the deal, right?

[15:43] Which if you aren't familiar with the offer, it was lose 20 pounds in six weeks.

[15:47] Obviously, this for people who were over a certain BMI.

[15:49] If they were below the BMI, would just say 10% of your body weight.

[15:52] Except it was like 140 pound, you know, person.

[15:54] And they're like a little overweight.

[15:56] They lose 14 pounds in six weeks.

[15:57] That's like two pounds of weight or two in change.

[15:59] And mind you like, I knew that people, people were like, oh, in the comments, like, oh, my God,

[16:02] that's unhealthy.

[16:04] People gained it.

[16:05] I knew that.

[16:06] So when they came to Wayne Day, they were at that six pounds of water and, you know,

[16:10] bricks in their pockets.

[16:11] Like, I knew people were gaming it, right?

[16:14] It's like, to be clear.

[16:15] And at the end, they're like dehydrated like a raisin.

[16:18] You know, they're naked on there, just like, you know, covering, covering themselves to

[16:21] like get underweight.

[16:22] So like, the wheat, like, I knew there was a five or six pound giveaway on both sides that were

[16:26] happening.

[16:27] Right?

[16:28] But we had almost 80% of people were hitting the goal at the time.

[16:30] And so it was very compelling.

[16:33] And the reality is that most people who work out for six weeks straight want to keep

[16:36] working out.

[16:37] And so that's why it's the offer worked.

[16:39] It got people really motivated in the short term.

[16:41] But then it was like, hey, listen, Cindy, you've lost 14 pounds.

[16:44] That's amazing.

[16:45] You told me your goal was 50 though.

[16:46] Yeah.

[16:47] Okay.

[16:48] Well, it's going to take longer than that, right?

[16:49] Yeah, I know it's going to take longer than that.

[16:50] Cool.

[16:51] And let's just get you going for a year and actually get you there for good.

[16:53] Right?

[16:54] Easy transition, even though people came in for a defined program on the front.

[16:58] Now the beauty of this particular offer was that compared to the rest of the industry, everyone

[17:02] else is giving free trials, free months, or low barrier offers like $21 or $20, 20 days,

[17:07] things like that.

[17:08] And so when they were trying to market against me, I was making $500 in the first transaction.

[17:13] And then $48 later, I was telling another $200, $200 of supplements.

[17:16] I had so much more cash up front.

[17:18] I could wildly outspend them.

[17:20] For them, they have $21, okay, basically nothing.

[17:23] And then they have to wait three weeks to convert into a normal membership price of $99, $199

[17:27] a month.

[17:28] And it would take them three months to just get what I got in the first transaction.

[17:32] And because of that, I was able to massively outspend them.

[17:34] And so by doing that play, I was able to dominate markets.

[17:37] And the beauty of the guarantee the way I had structured was one, obviously there was a goal,

[17:41] and if they won their money back by hitting the goal, they had it.

[17:44] It was straight up.

[17:45] They have the money back.

[17:47] Sometimes, some later on, we started doing it as credit.

[17:50] And saying, hey, this is credit.

[17:51] So we'll credit it back to any other services.

[17:54] Just have to disclaim in the advertising all the stuff.

[17:56] I've been able to laws your area.

[17:57] Now, beyond that, what it enabled me to do is do something like,

[18:00] is one of my favorite clothes, is ever, which is the best case worst case clothes.

[18:03] And so I'd be like, hey, Cindy, let's just zoom out for a second.

[18:06] Best case scenario, you change your life forever.

[18:08] You finally get in shape.

[18:09] You find a community of people, and you actually stick with this life.

[18:12] That's best case.

[18:13] Worst case scenario, you work out for six weeks.

[18:16] Basically, for free, you tell me I suck and I give you your money back.

[18:18] You have nothing to lose, except the only thing that is more guaranteed than that

[18:22] is that if you leave, you're definitely not going to get to where you want to go.

[18:25] So what do you want to do?

[18:26] Like, it was a risk-free move.

[18:28] And that closed a lot.

[18:31] So all of this stuff is what helped me get to $100,000, multiple $100,000

[18:35] from revenue the first year.

[18:36] Now, I also had a decent amount of profit that was left over.

[18:40] But the thing is, is that I didn't take that money out of the business.

[18:43] I left the cash in the business, and then when I opened my second location, it's like

[18:45] that cash from my first location, and basically spent it all on the second.

[18:48] It cost me $250,000 for the second location, which is a big mistake.

[18:51] I weigh over spent because my ego is tied to it.

[18:54] But the thing is, it took years before I actually ended up taking money out of the business

[19:00] and putting it into my personal bank account.

[19:02] The richest I've ever felt, which I talked about in the last story of this book, was when

[19:06] I put $100,000 into my bank account from the launch business.

[19:12] And so I kept doubling down on new location, new location, new location.

[19:17] And so I felt like I was living on like a razor's edge because like I basically had,

[19:20] I was really asset rich in cash for.

[19:23] I just had all these locations, all this equipment, all this payroll do every month.

[19:27] And so there was cash on all the bank accounts of the businesses, but like nothing in

[19:30] mind.

[19:31] And I think if I could do it over again, I would have said, dude, like what's the rush?

[19:34] Like why are you rushing?

[19:36] Like take money out.

[19:37] Like get yourself set up so you can breathe.

[19:40] So I think that I was running on such high like stress at all times that it dramatically

[19:45] impacted my ability to make good decisions because like there is no finish line.

[19:49] There's no like, there's no award I get.

[19:52] Like it's not like there's a network effect in gyms.

[19:55] Like you just have to keep executing really well for a very long period of time.

[19:58] And then eventually you can build something that has hundreds and thousands of locations.

[20:02] But like you still have to run a really good business.

[20:05] And I just had this artificial sense of rush because I was trying to prove myself to

[20:09] everyone in my head that didn't even care about me anyways.

[20:12] Now, the interesting thing with this whole challenge thing is that it took me a while to

[20:16] get good at it.

[20:17] So the first challenge I've ever ran, only 15% of people lost the weight.

[20:22] And what's interesting is that between then and you know, you're later, multiple years

[20:25] later, like we were almost 80%.

[20:27] But like fundamentally, we still had more or less the same workouts and the meal plans that

[20:31] I provided in terms of the calorie restrictions that are basically the same thing.

[20:34] And so it was like, what was the difference?

[20:36] And so the difference was I actually learned how to operate a business.

[20:40] Number two is I really leaned on to accountability, which is like make reminding people

[20:44] to shop for the gym, reminding people to follow their meal plans, telling people they have

[20:47] to weigh in a regular basis, make sure they're documenting that publicly.

[20:50] Like I started doing all these little things, right?

[20:52] There was no one thing that made us just like every time we just got better and better

[20:56] and better.

[20:57] So even though the stakes were there with the money, that actually was enough to motivate

[20:59] some people.

[21:01] But the reality is that like I should have just made it easier.

[21:03] So I like took the meal plans and I made them color coded.

[21:05] I made them, they didn't have to weigh anything.

[21:07] They have to count count.

[21:08] Like I learned a lot of things that made it more accessible to people who were just getting

[21:12] started because I was starting with beginners.

[21:15] But I was an advanced, you know, fitness person at the time, I had multiple state records.

[21:18] Like I was like, I was hard core in it, but like the people I was starting were not made.

[21:22] And it took me a minute to learn that.

[21:24] And I'll tell you how I figured this out.

[21:26] So I, I'm freaking out, near the end of the very first challenge I ever ran.

[21:30] I call my dad.

[21:31] I was a physician and I was like, I think I'm crashing people's hormones, metabolism.

[21:36] Maybe I'm mistricting their calories too much.

[21:37] That's why they're not losing weight.

[21:39] And any experienced doctoral tell you's like, oh, they're just not adhering.

[21:43] And I was like, no, it's obviously not that.

[21:45] It's obviously like some sort of scientific thing.

[21:47] And obviously he was right.

[21:48] It was just known as following it.

[21:51] Right.

[21:51] And so one of the things that I learned, this is good for anybody who has clients who have

[21:56] to do anything to get a result.

[21:57] So it doesn't matter what you sell.

[21:58] But if you have a service where a customer has to take action in order to see an outcome,

[22:01] what I learned was asking specific questions.

[22:04] So when I would ask people,

[22:05] hey, did you follow everything in the beginning?

[22:07] They're all like, oh, yeah, follow everything.

[22:08] Did it say 100%.

[22:09] And then I could literally follow that up with, okay, so how many days at a seven?

[22:13] Did you eat all three meals exactly to plan with nothing else?

[22:17] And they'd be like, oh, I mean, at least three days a week.

[22:20] And I'd be like, you just said that you followed it 100%.

[22:24] And then the next question was how many days at a seven?

[22:27] Did you eat all three of nothing else?

[22:29] They were like, oh, yeah, only three.

[22:31] Right.

[22:31] And so I got more specific about it.

[22:33] Like how many days did you have three and two shakes or whatever?

[22:36] And they would be like, oh, that's what I had.

[22:38] Now, if anybody who's like listening to this is like, oh, fitness stuff.

[22:40] Boyping is that ask specific questions and you'll get much more specific answers.

[22:45] Now, the sixth thing that kind of got me to that $100,000 plus was

[22:50] sell the vacation, not the plane flight.

[22:52] So I want to give you a visual in this because I think it's really important.

[22:54] Like this, when I understood how this worked for sales, it really changed.

[22:59] I mean, how much money am it.

[23:00] So what happens is let's say somebody's here, right?

[23:03] They're sad because they're like, oh, I'm sad.

[23:05] And my eyes are really weird.

[23:07] I look like a cyclops.

[23:09] Right, I'd be sad if I look like that.

[23:11] And they want to get over here.

[23:13] They want to be happy version of them whose got eyes that are evenly spaced

[23:18] and has a smiley face.

[23:19] Now, there's going to be some process of getting them here.

[23:24] Now, what happens is, most sales people will talk about all of the steps of getting

[23:30] here, right?

[23:31] That's what they're going to talk about.

[23:32] And the thing is is that that's like telling somebody, hey, I want you to go on this

[23:35] vacation.

[23:36] And so what's going to be required is you're going to have to wake up at the crack

[23:39] of dawn.

[23:40] You're going to have to pack your stuff tonight before you're going to have to be

[23:42] stressed out.

[23:43] The way in the line is to pull your idea.

[23:44] They're going to weigh it.

[23:45] You might have to pay an extra bill.

[23:47] Right.

[23:48] And then once you get to the plane, they're going to make you sit for another hour.

[23:50] And then you're going to get caught up like cattle and put into the input into the

[23:54] compartment of the plane.

[23:55] And you're going to have somebody sneezing and coughing next to you.

[23:57] Of course, it's going to be a baby on the plane.

[23:59] They're going to be crying the whole time.

[24:01] The food's going to be terrible.

[24:02] And you might get jet lag.

[24:03] There's going to be a delay for sure.

[24:06] And by the way, did I mention the layover?

[24:07] Yeah, you're going to have to do it all again another time in order to get your final

[24:11] vacation.

[24:12] Now, once you get there, you're going to actually not be there.

[24:14] You're going to get, you get the point here, right?

[24:16] Painful.

[24:17] That's what most people say, I'll sound like.

[24:19] But instead, if I just said, hey, you're here, you want to be in Maui.

[24:26] Let me tell you about Maui.

[24:27] And let me tell you how it's not like Baltimore.

[24:29] So Baltimore, it's like it's raining here, right?

[24:32] Ah, that's rain.

[24:34] That's like a looks like an octopus or jellyfish.

[24:36] It was that's rain.

[24:37] All right.

[24:38] So it's raining here.

[24:39] Right.

[24:40] Like rain.

[24:41] You got your little umbrella.

[24:42] Very sad.

[24:43] Right.

[24:44] It's terrible here.

[24:45] What we want to talk about is the pain of their current situation.

[24:49] Pain increases their desire to change.

[24:53] So think about this way.

[24:54] You want to sell at the point of greatest deprivation.

[24:57] So that's why like when someone's in pain is when they want to go to a doctor, right?

[25:01] You want to solve that.

[25:02] And so we want to remind them of the pain.

[25:04] So you want to talk about them where they're currently at, all the problems that exist.

[25:07] Then we say, cool.

[25:09] Well, let me tell you about Maui.

[25:11] Maui's got beautiful clear water.

[25:12] It's got white, white sand.

[25:14] Very fun.

[25:15] It's almost like powder when you're stepping into it.

[25:16] You're going to have poolside service and ocean side service depending on what you want.

[25:20] And you're going to have a kabana boy who's got little drinks, the little umbrella is

[25:23] in it.

[25:24] And you're going to be sipping there, having its home your life, creating memories that you

[25:27] will have for until you die.

[25:29] And the thing is, is that this vacation isn't just going to pay dividends from you there.

[25:31] You're going to enjoy it.

[25:32] But you're going to enjoy it two other times.

[25:34] Every day leading up to it, you're going to be looking forward to it.

[25:36] It's going to make every day better.

[25:37] And then afterwards, you're going to be able to look back at this pictures and re-experience

[25:40] it.

[25:41] And so it's not even about the vacation.

[25:42] It's about something that you're going to be able to use and think about for the rest

[25:44] of your life.

[25:45] Right?

[25:46] Notice what I didn't talk about.

[25:48] The plain flight, the TSA, the guy, the baby, you know, smoking cigarettes next to you.

[25:52] I don't know what this baby's doing, but he's doing something crazy.

[25:55] And so the point is is that you want to focus on the pain of their current and then what

[25:59] the experience of the result will be like.

[26:01] And then them signing up is the process of getting there.

[26:05] Now this part's key.

[26:07] Number seven was the role of bonuses and discounts.

[26:11] Okay?

[26:12] So I'm getting in.

[26:13] I think I learned this really early on.

[26:14] And so I've never been a discounter when it comes to my core product.

[26:17] Now, very different than saying, like, I'm going to peel a piece off.

[26:20] It's going to be a lead magnet.

[26:21] That's a different situation.

[26:22] But if someone wants me to discount my core service, the answer is always no, because

[26:26] we don't negotiate with price terrorists.

[26:28] So what do you do instead?

[26:31] So I'll give you two different things that have worked really well for me.

[26:34] So number one is that if somebody asks for a discount, what I would prefer to do is just

[26:39] out of bonus.

[26:40] If somebody asks for a discount, the first answer I usually says, well, I could do it for

[26:43] more.

[26:44] And a lot of times that gets people to buy.

[26:45] Now if they still don't want to buy, they say, okay, how about this?

[26:48] Because maybe they're like, I literally can't.

[26:49] Like, okay, can you refer me three friends?

[26:51] If you refer me three friends, I'll give you that discount, which is different because it

[26:55] changes the terms.

[26:56] So if someone else finds out, hey, you can sue the sign up for a $400 and you may need

[26:59] sign up for $500.

[27:00] Like, oh, dude, bring three friends.

[27:01] I'll give you the $100 bucks right now.

[27:03] They're like, oh, she didn't say that.

[27:05] I'm like, yeah, I changed the terms.

[27:07] And so you can use discounts as barring tools to have them advertised for you.

[27:12] So like, I'll give you a hundred bucks off if you also make reviews on all these platforms

[27:15] or do other things.

[27:16] Basically, any kind of discount I'll have, my terms will change to all the advertising

[27:20] they will allow me to do, which is worth more than me than whatever the discount is.

[27:23] Now, if somebody presents with a specific obstacle, I'll give you the actual story.

[27:27] So the first time I realized this, there is this lady business professional had the money,

[27:30] she was like the money signup problem, I was like, okay, she said the issue is I travel

[27:34] off her work.

[27:35] And she's like, so how am I going to be able to stick with the plan when I'm not here?

[27:39] She's like, do you have a travel meal plan?

[27:40] And I was like, well, I don't.

[27:41] And she's like, well, that's kind of a deal break for me.

[27:44] And I was like, okay, what if I made you a travel meal plan so that every time you travel

[27:48] you know how to order at the restaurant, so you can eat out and actually keep with this

[27:53] when you're gone?

[27:54] And she was like, oh, if you can do that for me, I'm in.

[27:56] And so I made that thing for that one lady.

[27:59] And then for every other person after that, when they'd come in and say, hey, what happens

[28:02] if I travel or have to go somewhere for work or I have this vacation in the middle,

[28:05] what do I do?

[28:06] I'd be like, oh, I'll give you the travel plan.

[28:08] And then boom, the obstacle is done.

[28:10] And so what happened is I started collecting kind of all of these obstacles that people would

[28:14] present with for the reasons that they wouldn't buy.

[28:16] And then I ended up making things.

[28:17] So I made a budget guide meal plan.

[28:19] So it's like, I can afford the thing, but I can't afford the food.

[28:21] I'm like, oh, what do you spend on food right now?

[28:23] Cool.

[28:24] This budget groceries is cost less than $40 a week.

[28:27] And you'll be able to stick the calories and lose the way.

[28:30] No, it's amazing.

[28:31] I won't even save money on this plan.

[28:32] And they're like, what if I'm on the go, I've got the shakes guide?

[28:34] Oh, what if I, like, what if I don't know what to eat for breakfast lunch and dinner?

[28:38] Okay, well, not only will you follow the plan, I'll actually give you specific breakfast

[28:40] lunches and dinners that you can make with your prep.

[28:42] Oh, what about working out when I'm away?

[28:44] Oh, that's why I have my while you're away workout guide.

[28:47] Right?

[28:48] What about if I can't make it in the gym because of time constraints, can I work out at home?

[28:51] Yep, I have my ad homework out guide.

[28:53] And so basically every single thing that people would present with, I would take the one time effort

[28:58] of making a beautiful solution for them.

[29:00] And they're like, wow, you want to bump them beyond.

[29:02] But then I took that templated solution and I stuck into my stack so that when somebody

[29:05] would talk to me and they'd bring up an obstacle, I'd go, oh, don't worry.

[29:08] Something like this with that help.

[29:09] And they're like, oh my god, that'd be amazing.

[29:10] And so I wouldn't, in a one-on-one selling situation, different than group sales.

[29:14] I would have my big stack of bonuses in my back pocket so that if they presented with it,

[29:19] I would just match their objection with the bonus that would overcome it.

[29:23] So this was a pretty terrible thing in terms of lessons, which was overspending.

[29:29] So what made my first location kind of so successful was that I was there.

[29:35] And I, you know, what above and beyond for customers and I tried to make everyone happy.

[29:40] And people could tell that I wasn't like rolling and money.

[29:43] You know, I had these sandbags that there's nice sandbags so you can buy that like fitness

[29:47] sandbags.

[29:48] I went to home deep-o and just bought sandbags.

[29:50] And then just tape them with duct tape and people just like would carry these like babies

[29:53] around of sand, right?

[29:56] And so when my second location happened, I saved it, I was money up and up at 200 of

[29:59] the thousand dollars in the second location.

[30:01] So like I spent for this eight times or whatever is more on my second location.

[30:04] And here's the crazy part.

[30:06] It made the same amount of money as my first location.

[30:08] And so like it was way worse for turns on a capital than my first one.

[30:12] And the thing is that I didn't actually understand what made my product good.

[30:16] What made people actually like my stuff.

[30:18] And so people weren't coming to the gym for fancy top tier equipment.

[30:23] They weren't coming for granted counter tops in a glass wall, which is what I did.

[30:26] My glass wall, my second location was almost the same price as my entire first location.

[30:30] What they were coming forward was the accountability and the quality of the training,

[30:33] quality of the experience, the people they liked.

[30:35] And so that's when it took me a 250,000 dollars to open the lesson, which is that I

[30:40] had to understand like what's the job to be done, what's the job that I'm actually

[30:43] accomplishing for the customer, right?

[30:45] Or like what is my product as a service deliver?

[30:47] And so for us it was community and accountability.

[30:49] Like people are very lonely.

[30:51] People want to feel like they belong.

[30:53] And obviously, you want to do things that are good for themselves.

[30:54] But what I realized over time is that the people who stuck with it, a lot of them didn't

[30:57] like dramatically change after they've done their way loss challenges.

[31:01] But they kept coming back and getting it again.

[31:02] And they just liked it because they wanted to look good, feel good.

[31:04] They just wanted to just like feel good, see their friends, listen to music, you know, get

[31:08] a little sweat on and then they go have their margarita Tuesdays or whatever.

[31:11] And I used to get really upset about that.

[31:13] But I was like, but it was because I didn't understand what we were actually doing.

[31:16] What we're really doing was providing a place for people to like get away from home and

[31:21] get away from work.

[31:22] It was like that third spot.

[31:23] I think Starbucks talks about that like what's that third location?

[31:25] Like for us, the gym was that.

[31:27] I think the only way you can really discover this is by actually talking to your customers and

[31:31] just asking them and say like, what need does this feel for free?

[31:35] Feel for you.

[31:36] Like what problem does this solve?

[31:37] Like where does this fit in your life?

[31:39] And I think listening qualitatively to the feedback, you'd find out like in the key when

[31:45] you're asking these things is you don't want to leave them alone.

[31:46] You want to say like, are we the third location for between your house and you're like,

[31:50] you're job?

[31:51] Are we that thing that fills your community whole up?

[31:53] It's like, no, that's not what you're asking.

[31:54] You're just saying, you want to keep it super open because you want them to tell you.

[31:58] And what that has helped me with is where I allocate my time in terms of reinvestment in

[32:03] the service or product to make it better.

[32:05] Because it's not better in my eyes.

[32:06] It has to be better in their eyes.

[32:07] Because I spent way too long obsessing over like the puredization of the training and like,

[32:13] and I completely disregard the music, but like the music mattered more to people than like

[32:17] the training.

[32:18] Like in terms of the actual workout, so the quality of the trainer differ it.

[32:21] But like how many reps and sets they were doing how much volume they were doing, they didn't

[32:24] care at all.

[32:25] I mean, shoot, half the time they'd skip a workout or two.

[32:27] So like the periodization was irrelevant, right?

[32:29] But I always said sister that because I was into it.

[32:31] Yeah, and I think the vast majority of business owners spend a huge amount of time solving

[32:35] problems that aren't problems.

[32:38] And so it's like you completely and excellently solve something that only you think is a problem.

[32:43] And so that's where like this tremendous ways to resources happens.

[32:46] Now let me tell you the next big lesson I had, which was proof.

[32:51] So what I did was, and I recommend this to every brick and mortar business owner, is if

[32:57] you have a sales area or sales room, these are examples that I have of before and after

[33:02] pictures, I've as you need permissions and all that stuff from people, make sure you're

[33:05] following the law, but just showing overwhelming social proof.

[33:08] And so right now, if you have yellow, or you have Google or whatever, there's going to be

[33:12] all these five stores you've gotten, people have left you reviews.

[33:15] Well, what a waste for them to only live there.

[33:17] So screenshot them, go to the dollar store, buy one dollar frames and then frame them all.

[33:22] And so when somebody's in your sales office, if all they see around you is before and

[33:26] after pictures of people saying you're great, it's hard for them to be like, well, is

[33:29] this place legit?

[33:30] You're like, I mean, yeah.

[33:32] And then I asked, and this is the question, right?

[33:34] This is the question I want to ask.

[33:34] I say, well, how much proof would you need to see in order to believe?

[33:38] And then the file question is, and if they didn't, you know, is that reasonable?

[33:43] Because you tell me when is it that one, like one, two, three, just tell me one, five, six,

[33:49] seven, eight, just tell me when it's good.

[33:50] Nine, ten, there be like, no stop, I get it.

[33:52] I'm like, right.

[33:53] So like, at some point, it probably isn't about that.

[33:55] It's about something you're afraid of.

[33:56] So what do you afraid of?

[33:57] Right now I'm back in the sale.

[33:58] I'm actually dealing with the real thing, the reason behind the reason, not the easy one

[34:01] that's a smoke screen that they're just putting out to not buy.

[34:04] Mostly because let's be real.

[34:05] Someone for at least for a gym, they're scared.

[34:07] They're afraid they're going to get made fun out.

[34:09] They're afraid they're going to slip.

[34:10] They're afraid they look stupid.

[34:11] Right.

[34:12] That's the big fears that people.

[34:13] I didn't even realize this.

[34:14] It took me a long time to realize that like, these are actual fears.

[34:17] And it was weird for me because I love the gym.

[34:19] So I'm like, everyone should love the gym.

[34:20] But it wasn't like that at all.

[34:22] Yeah.

[34:23] And so I made a whole video about this, like required viewing for business owners.

[34:26] You can go check it out.

[34:27] And inside the video, I basically talk about a flywheel that every business has to have.

[34:31] And I realized I learned it with this business, which is that you're going to get customers

[34:34] in the door, step one.

[34:36] You're going to get those customers results, step two.

[34:39] And then step three, you need to use those results to get you more customers.

[34:41] And so that's the flywheel that every business needs to build.

[34:44] And so you have moments in your customer experience or your product experience or customers

[34:50] are going to get these wow moments, right?

[34:52] Ideally.

[34:53] Right?

[34:54] And you want to be there at those moments to capture their reaction so that you can feed

[34:57] that into your marketing machine.

[34:59] And so there's the milestones along the way.

[35:01] And then obviously the end goal.

[35:03] So for us, obviously with challenges, we was easy to be like way in, way out, big moment,

[35:08] awesome picture, video.

[35:09] Was this great?

[35:10] Yeah.

[35:11] Leave us a review of fantastic.

[35:12] And so trying to engineer that into your customer experience, pre-mo way to get more

[35:17] customers in and enhance your sales.

[35:18] I'm going to fish that by saying proof system and displaying.

[35:22] So it's both both collection and displaying of the proof.

[35:25] Now the next one was partners.

[35:27] Now, man, it's taking me a very long time to learn.

[35:31] Learn my lessons with partners.

[35:33] So I have this really nice acronym for partners that I'm going to share with you.

[35:37] So if you want to partner to join your team, they should accomplish one of the team

[35:42] acronyms, which is mean either they have time that you don't have.

[35:46] They've got expertise that you don't have.

[35:49] They've got assets that you don't have or they've got money that you don't have.

[35:55] So assets would be like they've got a brand.

[35:57] They've got a following.

[35:58] They've got an audience.

[35:59] They might have a machine.

[36:00] I mean, whatever.

[36:01] distribution-based of customers.

[36:03] They have a network of affiliates, whatever.

[36:04] They have something that you don't have.

[36:06] They have expertise.

[36:07] They've a skill that you don't have.

[36:08] You can't do this without having the skill.

[36:10] They can work in your predisposed or they've got money and you need it.

[36:14] But fundamentally, every single partnership should have one or more of these things that

[36:20] they're bringing to the table.

[36:21] It's complimentary.

[36:23] If the worst business partnerships in the world is when two people have the same expertise

[36:27] get into business together because they're friends.

[36:28] It's like the recipe for the ad partnership.

[36:32] Two lessons on partnerships beyond the team framework.

[36:35] Number one is that if one of you is the working partner and somebody else is the outside

[36:39] partner who's maybe funding it, you need to figure out if you're going to have some sort

[36:44] of salary to live on.

[36:45] This was a mistake that I made and I basically lived without taking a salary from the

[36:49] business because I brought in partners and they weren't taking a salary but I was the one

[36:53] working in the business and they were.

[36:55] So I basically lived without taking an income for two years and so the reason that I'm so

[37:00] sensitive to cheapness and personal finances because like what I made in the first five or

[37:05] six months of me being in business is what I lived there for the next two years and so

[37:08] I lived on like 30,000 dollars a year or less and that's why I was so sensitive to it.

[37:13] The idea is make sure that you have some reasonable compensation if you're going to be the

[37:17] manager of the business because long term you need somebody else who's going to be the manager

[37:20] in your stead.

[37:21] So that's a cost of the business is going to have to incur regardless and you're doing

[37:25] a job in addition to being the owner.

[37:27] So that's like there's you want to make sure that that's clear.

[37:29] Are you doing a job in the business different than the owner?

[37:33] That's only going to be in the situations when somebody's funding your thing.

[37:36] All right point one.

[37:37] The second point is that the equity that you give away in the beginning is the most

[37:41] expensive and so to the degree that you possibly can hold out on giving equity away early.

[37:49] Now if you have to bring people in and you absolutely need them in the chart that's

[37:52] part of the game.

[37:53] It's just like it's so often that someone's like, cool, here's the pie.

[37:57] There's two of us boom, here's half, right?

[37:59] You don't always have to split things evenly between the number of people.

[38:02] There's different value of skills.

[38:04] There's different value of experience.

[38:05] There's knowledge that.

[38:06] So like you can bring two people in and each of them can have 5% and then you have 90.

[38:09] Like the slices of the pie don't necessarily need the same and a big variable that they have

[38:14] there is are they taking a paycheck or not, right?

[38:16] And so it's a lot of this has to come down to one big word risk who's taking on the most

[38:21] risk and so typically that is how the pie is sliced.

[38:24] So number 11 was owners.

[38:27] You're like, how is that different than partners?

[38:30] Let me explain.

[38:31] So every brick and mortar now I have a lot of experience with this now, but every brick

[38:36] and mortar business that I know that's been scaled privately, not franchiseed, which actually

[38:42] still follows the same wall.

[38:43] But that scales privately with one or a couple owners that own everything is that they

[38:48] figure out that every brick and mortar location typically needs to do a profit share.

[38:53] They need to have somebody that they have what feels like a stake in the location.

[38:58] So if you look at like Chick-fil-A for example, they have their location operators and

[39:04] those operators have a percentage of the profit from each location.

[39:08] Now they're not the majority owners, they don't have controlling, but they can run the

[39:12] day to day operations.

[39:14] And so basically every brick and mortar business that I have seen scale has this thing.

[39:19] Now, some people have to go, well, how much do you give them profit share?

[39:21] I'll tell you how I come to it.

[39:23] I think how much would someone need to make that has the level of skill required to thrive

[39:29] in this position?

[39:30] And so let's say that I think that the skills that are required here would require five

[39:33] years of experience and 150,000 years.

[39:36] Okay.

[39:37] So I'm going to say the on target earnings, OTE, is 150K.

[39:42] Okay.

[39:43] So what I'd probably do is say, all right, well, what is my average location make?

[39:48] And let's say my average location makes 250,000 hours in profit.

[39:52] All right.

[39:53] Well, I don't want to give 250,000 hours in profit.

[39:55] It's straight to the, that doesn't make any sense for you as an OTE.

[39:57] So then what do I do?

[39:59] So I would probably do something like this.

[40:01] You get 75K as a base.

[40:04] So 50% and the other 50% which would be 75,000 dollars would mean that you would get,

[40:10] let's say, 10, whatever, 12.5% I don't know the math is here.

[40:14] 12.5% of the profit from the location.

[40:17] Now if a location does really well, it does 350,000 dollars, then all of a sudden, this

[40:24] 12.5% is even more.

[40:26] So now they're at 185 or whatever.

[40:28] Now if they underperform and let's say they're at 100K, well, then they would only get

[40:32] an extra 12.5K, right?

[40:34] And so then they'd only make whatever that is, $87,000.

[40:37] And so this still keeps them very invested as an operator for the location and feeling

[40:43] the top line and bottleneck, in packs of what it costs to run the business.

[40:47] And I want this person to be like, I want their picture on the wall, I'm going to be like,

[40:50] this is John's location, right?

[40:52] And this is where I love this from a long-term perspective because this can become a very

[40:56] easy career path for people.

[40:58] So people who are kind of like, if you have a business at Quartar's low or medium-level

[41:01] skill, somebody can come in, do an amazing job, and they're like, what's my long-term

[41:04] career path here?

[41:05] It's like, well, if you do an awesome job, I'm happy to put you in a job.

[46:56] well when I started my first location, Huntington Beach, I had one PT client who paid me like $4,000 a month and it's because they trained five days a week and it was like hour and a half or two hour long sessions and so it was 10 hours a week of PT basically guaranteed that I would do it them and so it made me a significant amount every month and I basically just lived on that now is that part of the model? No, but I did it because that's like what allowed me to be more aggressive with the expansion of the business, I could take all the cash to come in by new equipment, fix things, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do

[47:26] things, whatever, you know, hire more people and so there are some things that you're going to do in the beginning that will not skill with the business and that's okay. So you just want to make sure that your nail it portion doesn't include the unskillable parts that I still think you should absolutely consider doing to make the whole process a lot easier on yourself and so it's like if you have your core business fine, if you have five, five clients you pay you more personalized attention for stuff that you can like live on that money, part of you is going to be like me and I should just do this and maybe you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you

[47:56] can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can do that, you can

[48:26] that sounds like it's contrary to the woman in the red dress, but we're not building two businesses, you're just accepting very high ticket clients that you can on a one-on-one basis, not building a separate business, minimizing the time requirement, and so for me with my personal training client, I did the middle of the day, it worked out fine for me, finished by more sessions, I'd have a couple hours, I would do two hours with him, and then I'd start my evening sessions, so I basically just started that as my evening sessions, and that's just what a lot of Alex to each polling, and if you're like, wait, I thought you ate the expired food, I did that too, but sometimes a week to do that,

[48:56] but I'm not going to expire, so I had each polling to me.

[48:58] All right, so this next one's really big, especially if you have a team which basically anybody who has a business eventually has a team, is that doing is not the same as teaching, so it's one thing to be able to sell, it's another thing to be able to teach to sell, it's one thing to be able to train, another thing to be able to teach to train, one thing to be able to run ads, another thing to be able to teach people run ads, and so I had this kind of ego thing where I loved being the most viable player, right?

[49:21] And I love being able to come in and save the day, put the team my back, and it was like, rocky, rock, you know, whatever, right?

[49:25] And that was something that handicapped me, and so I wanted to be the best salesperson, but what a terrible thing to want if you want to have a business, and so I had to shift my identity to being, I want to be the best sales teacher, I want to be the best marketing teacher, I want to be the best operations teacher, right?

[49:42] And by doing that, it shifted how I saw what winning looked like, and so before this it was like, oh, they went to for six today, I could go and close five out of six.

[49:50] Okay, cool, well, that means that you suck as a teacher, not that you're great as a sales guy, and so you have to basically level up your game and think this is the new identity that I have to be, and this took me this took me a long time to learn.

[50:02] And I'll tell you the first time that this was like very real for me, is that I went home for Christmas. This is like the first year of the gym, and I was very afraid to do that, and I had trained these girls who had sold tanning before.

[50:17] And so I taught them how to sell the challenge. And I remember when I was driving, I remember where I was, I was driving on the road to go back to my actual house, where I lived when I grew up.

[50:26] And I get this phone call, and they were like, yeah, you know, the day ended, and I was like, how'd you do? And they were like, oh, we had, you know, we had five people show sold to.

[50:34] And I was like, you sold them though, like credit card, like it ran, like the whole thing, they were like, yeah, one was paying fully others, I was put pay. And I was like, hold on. So today, $750 came in, like it prides it successful next to it. And they were like, yeah, they were like,

[50:48] back to the, like, why is this guy being so weird? And I ended up pulling the car over and I remember it was like one of the few times that I had like a real big emotional like experience.

[50:56] One of a few times ever. And I almost got like teared up because it was it was the first moment where I realized like I wasn't the one who's going to have to make every dollar in this business.

[51:04] And it was the first moment where I realized the value of transferring a skill of somebody else because until then I just wanted to be MVP. I just wanted to be the best trainer of the best sales guy, but whatever,

[51:13] but as soon as I gave it to someone else, it was like, it was like, I tasted freedom. And once I had that, I was like, I'm going to get,

[51:18] I'm great at this. And I think a big part of honestly the stuff that you guys see today with YouTube and the books and things like that,

[51:24] like, because I shifted my perspective from being like, it's one thing to learn. I have to learn it. I've learned it. So that I can teach it. Rather than I want to learn it,

[51:32] so that I can be the best person. I don't think of the best at basically anything. If I can be one of the best at teaching the thing,

[51:38] then I can help thousands and millions of people and that's a much higher leverage skill. So the next thing kind of bolts on to that,

[51:45] which is less than 15 for me, was simple. All right, simple scales, fancy fails. All right. Now it's like, okay, we'll do. All right,

[51:52] but let me talk about this within the context of systems and and training. So a lot of people have these very, very complex sales systems.

[51:58] And I honestly just trying to cut more and more things out of the sales stuff that I teach because I wanted to be something that someone can immediately pick up.

[52:06] And so the whole like, closer framework came out of just trying to make this as simple as possible.

[52:12] Clarify why they're here when they come in, label them with a problem to show that you listen, ask them. You overview the past experience,

[52:18] their past pain. What did they try it so far? Then sell the vacation, tell them about our thing. Make the offer.

[52:24] If they say no, explain to where they're concerns once they buy, then reinforce the decision, tell them they did a good job. That's it. It's all we're doing.

[52:30] Right. And so I used to have all these like really complex things that I tried it. Like it'd be really hard for people to learn.

[52:36] And then I was like, okay, I just need this so that somebody who has no idea how to sell can go through this thing and then be able to sell after it.

[52:42] And I remember when I started launching gyms that the sales training I had in total was like an hour and 15 minutes. The whole thing.

[52:48] And what's crazy is that that sales trading came from the intention of like people have to watch this and at the end to be able to close.

[52:56] And what's so interesting is that I see like lots of sales trainings that are like sold and things like that on the internet.

[53:00] They're, you know, they're 100 hours long. But I had a sales training that was like, just do this.

[53:06] Don't do anything else. Just do this and I only had to get them to understand seven steps in this process and if they could understand seven steps, they could close.

[53:14] And so I would encourage you to first think, what is the absolute minimum required in order to close that? What is the absolute minimum required in order to make a great training session, right?

[53:24] And then try and boil it down to the core components rather than make it complicated because the complexity piece again makes you feel important like you're so advanced when reality like there's probably fewer things that matter than you think.

[53:34] All right. So this is a very kind of technical advance thing that I learned from the gyms, which is that you want zero cost up sells. Okay. So what does that mean? So I realized early on that people will come in the gym and then I'd sell them service, right?

[53:48] But they also would want other things after that. They would want a pair of all. They would want apps. They would want food. They would want supplements like there's all these other things, right?

[53:56] And so I realized that it would cost me about 200, well, later 200 earlier cost me less, but let's call it 100 $100 real car cost for okay.

[54:05] The question that they asked myself was, is there something that I can sell them that cost me no time because selling service cost me time, right? There's something I could sell that cost me no extra effort that could recoup that original cost.

[54:16] And the answer was yes. And so if you sell a service, I think one of the easiest things you can do is upsell products that go with the service that you just make your margin on and you can liquidate your accost up front.

[54:28] And so for me, I sold supplements that sell 200 dollars, supplements that every person and the margin I made on the supplements was usually enough to cover the cost of all of my advertising remote.

[54:36] So basically, I would just recover all my advertising bill with my supplements, so I could spend whatever I wanted to get customers because then all of my service revenue was basically gravy on top.

[54:45] And so the goal that I would like, don't think, oh, that doesn't work for my business, ask a different thing, how could I make something like this work for my business?

[54:52] So like if I have a yoga studio that's like, fine, sell yoga bots sell mats sell leggings, whatever, because they're going to want that stuff.

[54:58] There's always going to be a couple of other things that someone's going to want when you have a service typically.

[55:02] And if you're like, why can't immediately think of something, fine, then give yourself more than immediately to think about it.

[55:07] Because you only have to figure out one or two things that it could change your business forever.

[55:11] So, pro tip, if you want, you can sell a guarantee. So, guaranteed, so you don't have to be free, you can sell a guarantee.

[55:17] So, you can sell your normal services and if for an extra 10% we'll guarantee this, people will buy a guarantee.

[55:22] And guarantees are basically zero extra costs that they don't take it.

[55:25] And so it's like only one out of two people buys a guarantee and is taking me up on it.

[55:29] And it's like, okay, well, the 90% of the time it's just profit, pro tip.

[55:31] And you can also charge more than 10% obviously.

[55:34] 17, I learned the power of what I called internal plays.

[55:37] All right, so internal plays are basically internal promotions that you run to your existing customers in the list.

[55:43] And so one of the things I realized is that customers get bored of things and so you just need to sell them more stuff.

[55:49] And so I would say, okay, you know, we have our normal gym membership, but we're going to run a big booty boot camp.

[55:54] We're going to run a bunch of guns and guns. We're going to run a sex, you know, get your sexy back, whatever.

[55:59] Right. And you laugh, but this is this is the Southwest, right? I didn't have the norms for our good produce.

[56:05] And the thing is, it's sold. It worked great, but here's the best part is that I remember the first time I did this was Big booty boot camp.

[56:11] So Sam, the guy that I said in fourth said, hey, Cindy's emails. So I was like, all right, so cool. So I sent these emails that were about Big booty boot camp.

[56:19] And the emails, all of a sudden, like, came back, we were like, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in

[56:49] I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I

[57:19] I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I

[57:49] I'm just gonna peel off one portion of that and then say, hey, all my customers and if you want this one thing like really maxed out and 10% or 20% of the customers will be like, yeah, I'm interested in that and then boom and that thing that you end up selling is actually super high margin.

[58:03] Internal plays are almost all profit you can run them four times a year, recommend.

[58:07] Yeah, it's, it's all, it's basically all profit because you already paid the cost of pouring the customer and so the only cost of the cost of delivery.

[58:15] And it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like

[58:45] you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it

[67:45] it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like,

[68:15] you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it

[68:45] needs not shows, not calls, leads 55% and I was like, dude, how you doing it? He was like, oh, I pay one girl full time. She has no other job, but to call leads the moment they come in. And I want to give you an idea of a scale here. He gets about two to three leads a day. That's his business. Two three leads a day. That's all he gets. And he pays a girl full time. And the only job description is be available. That's it. So 24 seven, whatever lead comes in, you stop.

[69:15] Put your doing you call the lead. That's it. That's the only job she had. But and think about crazy. It is because as a business. So you're like, well, I should give them something else. Well, think about this.

[69:23] Most people in his position close 10% of the leads. And we've all heard the statistic that if you call lead within 60 seconds, you have a 391% increase in sales.

[69:33] Okay, 3901%. Let me translate that into X is that's a 4x, say 4.9x for business. What's the 5x? If you have something that could 5x the amount of sales that you're getting from the leads that you're working right now is there's something

[69:45] right now that you could do that's more valuable enough. Probably not. And so the question is, or the interesting thing is, is that the cost of actually achieving that is the cost of one maniac that you have to pay to stop whatever they're doing to call the leads.

[69:58] That's it. And so think about what the difference of a 2x 3x 4x 5x and revenue would be for your business in terms of efficiency on the leads that you're currently getting.

[70:06] And then if that number is larger than what it would pay one maniac to call the leads, find the maniac and pay them. And so I figured out way too late that lead nurture oftentimes is a larger potential throughput.

[70:18] There's a larger discrepancy in performance on nurture than almost any part on acquisition. And so we focus at acquisition.com on that super heavily because it's one of the easiest lowest risk levers that you can even have to change any of it.

[70:31] And the change in your delivery, you just nurture better. Okay. Number 23. So this is going to be a callback, which is never rely on another business to feed yours. Now I made an entire video about one item, which is that if you only have one kind of point of failure that becomes the weak link in the chain.

[70:51] And so I told you about the gym mastermind that I joined and everybody there was running group on. Well guess what happened when group on stopped working? They were all out of luck.

[70:58] But you have to you ideally want to have multiple ways to get customers. Now I like to have multiple ways to get customers as I get bigger.

[71:05] I want to have one channel that I can reliably get customers when I'm starting out. But if it's another business, that's my source. I don't like that.

[71:14] So there's a difference between having a single channel risk versus another business risk.

[71:19] So if another business can choose to shut off my my leafload of morrow, very risky. And so if I say, okay, I do door knocking, I do upbound.

[71:28] That is one channel and that can scale up usually to about a million dollars a month.

[71:32] And then at that point, you can kind of diversify. Now if you're brick and mortar or local, it's one of those business is that's a little bit different than like the online or national space, which is that it's easier to have multiple streams.

[71:44] Typically with brick and mortar, you're going to have naturally a little bit more work of mouth. It's easy to set up your Google search terms winning local SEO, not that hard running paid ads local, not that hard.

[71:55] All right, so it's more common to have multiple streams open in a local business than it is at a national level, just because the nature of basically ease of competition there.

[72:04] The next three lessons are going to be 24 25 26, which is close to when I finish the gym and so my gym, my gym season and so we're going to end on there. So 24 25 26.

[72:18] All right, and so all three of these are going to be around people. And so the first thing is around what you have to pay for people, right.

[72:26] So if you can't pay to get pre great people, you're going to have to work to get great people. So let me put it differently.

[72:33] It is faster to get better people by raising how much you're willing to pay. You'll just have better quality candidates that'll come towards you.

[72:39] If you raise basically the ticket or the buried entry, that being said, I have that exceptional people that came for less.

[72:46] You just have to talk to like 10 times more people to find those people. So it's basically going to video game you have to like grind or pay, right. It's like you if you like work to level up or you can pay to level up.

[72:58] Well, if you're poor, you're starting out in your business. It just means that you're going to work and the work is outreach and running, you know, job postings and doing a lot of interviews and kissing a lot of toads before you're finding your magic prints, which hey, I'm glad that you found your magic prints, which was your customers success right.

[73:16] All right. And so you think I got a grind or you got to pay. So that's not a more than the number 24 but number one for people. So number 25 is a platinum rule.

[73:24] And this was a really eye-opening experience for me. I had an employee that taught me one of the most interesting lessons I've ever learned in managing people. So my single best manager across all my gym locations, everyone loved him. He's an amazing trainer, he had great energy, he was in shape, he's great at sales, he was awesome.

[73:39] So I ended up promoting him to manager and he did an amazing job one of the best managers ever had and it like months six he came to me and he was like, hey man, I don't want to be manager anymore.

[73:49] And I was like, what's going on? What's wrong? Like let's figure this out. And he was like, I just don't like the stress of being manager. He's like, I'd rather just like train clients train myself, go home.

[73:58] And I was like, well, so you still want to work here. It's like, yeah, I love him here. I was like, okay, I was like, so you just want to go back to your old job.

[74:06] And he was like, yeah, so I was like, you're going to make half as much money. He said, I'll guess be poor then. And I remember him saying that and it was like my world like torn around me. I was like, I don't understand this at all.

[74:18] But he said it was so much conviction. I was like, I don't understand it, but I respect it. And the lesson that I took away from that was not everyone's motivated by the same things is me.

[74:28] And to the same degree, it means that they're motivated by other things. And I have to learn with those other things are so that I can build career paths and roles and incentives that are right for them.

[74:39] And so that was the whole concept of the platinum roar of the golden roll. It's like treat others way you want to be treated. It was treat others the way they want to be treated.

[74:45] And that was my big takeaway that I've tried stick with myself to this day that I still mess up all the time. But it was just like it was such a crazy lesson for your church. So 26 on people can you be friends with your employees. This is a controversial one employees question mark friends question mark.

[75:04] I'll tell you the difference. So when I started, I was friends with all my employees, whatever the professional line was, I definitely didn't have it.

[75:11] And so I was just friends because I was 20 something right now. People worked for me were 20 something like we're all just like a bunch of, a bunch of whooligans right like trying to run a business basically I didn't run that well right like I would show my emotions on my sleeves if I was upset they would be upset. I take my emotions on them.

[75:25] And like when I needed them to change something it was weird because we're friends with my hanging in can you you know like it just was it sucked. So I then kind of create the rule like can't be friends with your employees right. And so I kind of lived that way for a while and that mean tain a professional line.

[75:38] And I would say that where I'm at now in my career is that you can be friends with your employees as long as you maintain a clear line which is that you they have to respect and the easiest way that I have delinited this is literally doing a hat change sounds silly.

[75:53] But it doesn't have to be an actual hat, but I I'll start a conversation with like friend hat and then I'll talk whatever I'm going to talk and sometimes I'm like hey man boss hat like this is this is what's going wrong like you need to change this right and by being able to maintain that and I know that's a matured.

[76:07] And I know that's a maturity thing or whatever's happened first was like friends with everyone that didn't work friends with no one. You can do that but I would say like life is lonely.

[76:15] And then the you know the third version at least where I'm at now is that these are the people that help me accomplish my goals.

[76:21] I mean I can't imagine a better definition of a friend people who like try to help you accomplish what you're trying to do and so the people that work at acquisition calm I'm friends with many of them but we also have a line of kind of like mutual respect and professionalism because at the end of the day this is the kind of thing that we're business athletes and we're all in the team.

[76:36] And so everyone needs to perform and so it's kind of having more like a coach relationship I think where it's like a coach is still if I would say friends with the players, but there's just some line that you don't cross and I think that that's that's really what it comes down to like I'm there for them 100% I'm probably not going to like come in.

[76:52] And then I'm going to come in in tears because my dog dies to somebody who's on my team like it I don't think that'd be appropriate right so it's just maintaining that line.

[77:00] So these are the 26 lessons I learned from building my gyms and if you want to see me apply these lessons to a real everyday business that's not at all in the space.

[77:08] Check out over here where I help a stranger build a million dollar business and join.

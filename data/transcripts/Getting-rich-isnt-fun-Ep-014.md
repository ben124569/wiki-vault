[00:00] Success isn't falling. It's hard.

[00:03] Effort always goes on notice. Get used to it.

[00:08] You're good. You never bother.

[00:12] Let us, let us get it.

[00:14] So there's this myth that probably happens with this influencer status of like,

[00:19] we own businesses and businesses grow.

[00:21] You're like the last three months of revenue, I've been like.

[00:23] Yeah, so if you look at this here,

[00:25] so what's been trending down this point?

[00:28] Okay, Jesus.

[00:29] Yeah, it's heal.

[00:30] Yeah, it's a grime.

[00:31] Obviously.

[00:32] Ag was just down 60% of what it was.

[00:34] Yeah.

[00:35] But the thing about growth is that the closer you zoom into it,

[00:39] the more jagged it looks and the more jagged it feels.

[00:42] You can feel the nice edge of the up and the down and the up and the down every single day.

[00:46] In this vlog, you're going to see me hop on a lot of calls.

[00:49] And that's because that's what a lot of running our businesses is to lay on.

[00:54] Nice to meet you too.

[00:56] You just you spread from air conditioning to air conditioning.

[00:59] Hey, we're fair.

[01:00] Just cool ocean it over here.

[01:02] You know how it is.

[01:03] Hello.

[01:04] If two doors in your room, it looks different.

[01:05] If Queen.

[01:08] Oh wow.

[01:08] What's up, man?

[01:09] How's he going?

[01:10] Good.

[01:11] Congratulations on being you.

[01:14] Oh man, he's not from being you.

[01:15] I don't know how I, how I, how I,

[01:16] how we're kidded from Baltimore and up in Vegas.

[01:20] Alright, I'm going to go ahead and share my screen.

[01:23] Because of the proliferation of social media,

[01:25] entrepreneurship appears to be the things that look nice.

[01:28] So it's the private jets.

[01:29] It's the cars.

[01:31] It's the watches.

[01:32] It's the money.

[01:32] But the things is that all of those are outputs from business that people use for personal

[01:38] game that then look attractive.

[01:40] But the actual doing this every day of entrepreneurship is predominantly communication.

[01:45] It's talking to other leaders, other employees, teammates, vendors, customers.

[01:51] And when you look at it on a real day today of what that looks like,

[01:55] it's a lot of meetings.

[01:56] It's a lot of calls, a lot of zooms.

[01:58] And those don't look good on Instagram.

[02:00] And that's part of your talk about a pain or, you know,

[02:02] they're not really joy or their expertise.

[02:05] Yeah, at a certain point, you actually stop being able to pay for expertise.

[02:08] Because when you start talking to people who have a shit little money too,

[02:12] like there's basically more valuable things than money,

[02:16] to trade.

[02:17] Like that's where influence connections,

[02:20] introductions, deals, things like that become a more valuable thing

[02:24] to discuss.

[02:25] There's free communities, there's paid communities,

[02:27] there are benefits to both, you know, paid communities, sometimes the price tag is the gate

[02:32] to give you some level of qualifier, you know, legitimacy.

[02:35] I mean, even like you join a golf club where it's $100,000 a year to keep buying.

[02:38] You're going to meet a caliber of people that don't care about spending $100,000 a year,

[02:42] like it's a very different type of person.

[02:44] If you just change the five meals that you eat,

[02:46] because like everyone thinks that they give up variety when they go to diet,

[02:49] they're like, I can't just take this.

[02:51] But people eat the same five-seven meals.

[02:54] Yeah, so I put 20 pounds back on, and so there's a key point there,

[02:56] as I put it back on.

[02:57] It wasn't like the first time I've been this way before.

[03:00] After the book lunch, and that was because actually going into the book lunch,

[03:04] it was the longest period I think that I didn't work out.

[03:06] I didn't work out for like six weeks.

[03:07] Most people eat the same five-seven meals,

[03:09] and so they think that like changing their diet is going to have to be this massive thing,

[03:12] but you really need to find five to seven meals that you like,

[03:14] because you currently already like five to seven meals,

[03:16] and that's what you already eat, and so you just have to swap those for other stuff.

[03:20] And if you just do that, you're 80, 90% of the way there.

[03:23] The older you get, the fewer friends you tend to have,

[03:26] and that's not because you are less social,

[03:28] but it's because you have higher standards.

[03:30] Even then, man, even though like my homiest of homies,

[03:33] you can still like, you just slowly stretch out communication,

[03:36] and eventually it's just...

[03:38] It just fizzles.

[03:40] Like it's hard, you have to maintain relationships,

[03:42] so you just don't put the effort into maintain,

[03:44] and then they usually just end.

[03:45] Like if you're not in close proximity, that's the thing.

[03:47] It's like, most people's friendships are out of convenience.

[03:50] They're not out of design.

[03:53] And so they're just friends with people who are like,

[03:54] lived across the Hoffman.

[03:55] But what is the chance that like,

[03:56] the prison looks across Hoffman is actually going to be

[03:59] a perfect fit for the type of person you want to be with for a long time,

[04:01] probably not.

[04:02] And so, I think people will let friends happen by accident,

[04:06] rather than on purpose.

[04:07] Well, would you consider like a unicorn,

[04:10] and the fence ground, like what trades would that?

[04:12] They truly report, and they make you better,

[04:14] in multiple arenas, which is basically like,

[04:17] they are competent in ways that you are not.

[04:20] They have a line to interest with you,

[04:22] and ideally their value is one, and it's yours.

[04:25] That's a, it's just very hard to do.

[04:37] We were going over pricing to cheaper software

[04:40] about to roll out, or largely portfolio companies,

[04:42] and I think the, one of the emphasis they did made the product,

[04:47] now, have a tenable pricing structure.

[04:49] So we were able to catch it before they rolled it out,

[04:51] which would have literally cost millions of dollars.

[04:54] So we avoided that, so great.

[04:57] We got chops.

[04:58] We got almost smells good though, you notice that?

[05:00] That's how it smells.

[05:01] Yeah, go for it.

[05:02] Yeah, I'm going to get a little trim,

[05:05] a little chop.

[05:06] I met Layla and I had short hair, and she said,

[05:09] I think you look good with long hair, and I said,

[05:11] okay, and then I didn't cut it.

[05:13] And so that was one of my hair went from shorter to longer,

[05:15] and it's pretty much just stayed there.

[05:17] If you're an ugly guy, you might want to consider growing a beard,

[05:20] because it leaves half of your face to imagination.

[05:24] So I had this, when we had Jim launch,

[05:27] this is right when we transitioned, right started making money.

[05:29] And so remember, I had just been looking at bankruptcy lawyers,

[05:33] like a couple months earlier, and so we have a meet up with 28 Jim owners

[05:37] that come to Albuquerque, and next week I'll go,

[05:38] and I'm like super nervous because I'm afraid that they're just going to, like,

[05:42] think I saw or whatever.

[05:43] So the night before, you know, I was like trying to look nice,

[05:46] and so I had this gruff, and so I, for all the guys who know this,

[05:49] like you start shaving down and just like getting yourself in like different hair,

[05:52] you're like, all right, I'm going to do the Wolverine, and then I'm going to do

[05:54] mutton chops, they like you work your way down.

[05:56] And so the last thing that I left was this, this big gunslinger must actually,

[05:59] like a big handlebar must actually.

[06:01] And so I like looked out of the bathroom at Layla, and I was like,

[06:05] and she was like, you look ridiculous.

[06:07] And so I looked back at the mirror and I was like,

[06:09] I think it's perfect.

[06:10] And so that actually makes you sound cooler than I was.

[06:14] What really happened is that when I looked in the mirror, I was like, well,

[06:17] at least I won't take myself too seriously.

[06:19] And so I figured that was that would like kind of,

[06:22] because I was so nervous going into it that I wanted to have some sort of

[06:25] comic relief from myself as like a visual reminder.

[06:27] So I look in the mirror.

[06:28] I think everybody's got fuel, it's just not necessarily the one that is sexy.

[06:32] So a lot of the guys out there are like find your fashion, find your purpose,

[06:35] but I think for most people, their purpose is like,

[06:37] pay rent and not be broke.

[06:39] And so like if that's what you got, then that's what you use.

[06:41] Growth is painful because you become aware of the artificial disease.

[06:45] Reality shows you point blank all of the areas you're weakened.

[06:50] And so when you've adjusted to something, you've kind of filled the gaps.

[06:53] You filled the holes between where you are and what is required for that current season.

[06:57] But when you go into a new season or you go to a new level and you battle a new boss,

[07:01] all of a sudden this guy has a whole host of different skills that you've never seen before.

[07:04] And you just get your ass beat over and over and over and over and over again.

[07:07] And those ass beatings hurt.

[07:09] I mean, everybody has lots of things they hate.

[07:11] Like right now, I would ask you where are 10 things that you hate about your life.

[07:14] It's probably you can come up with them pretty fast, but if I ask you 10 things you're grateful for,

[07:16] it takes a lot longer.

[07:17] And so it's like rather than trying to get people to be different than who they are,

[07:20] it's like find the 10 things you hate the most of your life and use that the reason.

[07:23] Use those as the reasons to just start working.

[07:26] Because I mean like whatever you're going to do is going to suck.

[07:29] It's just whether it sucks less than what your current existence is.

[07:31] And for me, I had a lot of stuff that sucks inside just wanted to change.

[07:34] It's a bit spectacular for me.

[07:37] Where's the boss?

[07:38] The boss is going to have fun with that.

[07:39] That's stuff.

[07:40] So the big thing that the internet doesn't understand is that like Lala operates,

[07:44] backwards is not calm. She's the operator. She does everything.

[07:46] She sees, she actually is involved with most part in the day to day of business.

[07:51] I mean, obviously I'll say how to people around the office who are not.

[07:54] And he shenned against going on here.

[07:57] What was that going to ask you?

[07:58] Oh, I was going to let you know.

[07:59] Um, I brought the other half of the chair.

[08:02] Oh, I saw that.

[08:03] Yeah, I brought it.

[08:03] So that's right there.

[08:04] First tobes.

[08:05] So, uh, cross the pun.

[08:12] That is how we have found Lala and I work best together.

[08:15] And I work on like big, medium projects for extended periods of time

[08:20] that are huge rocks that move things forward.

[08:23] And then Lala just like basically, you're through force of will just keeps

[08:27] everyone on board, everyone aligned and continues to hire and train and scale the business.

[08:33] And that's what she's exceptional.

[08:34] I mean, that's why we're able to build companies with such enterprise values that

[08:37] quickly is that she just understands building infrastructure behind things.

[08:43] Yeah, I don't want to lose any mask on on those stairs.

[08:46] Yeah, my dad told me he said doesn't do cardiac because he wants to see his heart beats.

[08:53] He's a doctor.

[08:56] He's kidding.

[08:57] He was joking. That was a joke.

[08:59] Thank you.

[09:01] I'm going to do this thumbnail.

[09:02] And then I'll be out of where we added to.

[09:04] We're going to ice coffee.

[09:06] I was Graham Stephenson and Jack Selby.

[09:09] We're going to talk about ice coffee for hours.

[09:13] I actually, I don't know what they want.

[09:14] I don't know what they want to talk about because I've been on a couple of times.

[09:16] I was like, I hope I have something new to say.

[09:19] So we'll find out.

[09:20] Because the thing is that everyone is waiting for this like one home run that's going to

[09:23] like change everything and that basically never happens because it's all a game of incremental

[09:28] improvement. It's about a small one percent of improvements that add up a

[09:32] time. And while you're making the improvements, it never feels big.

[09:35] It only feels big in retrospect. And it looks like an overnight success from the

[09:40] outside because whoever sees the overnight success is never the person who experienced the

[09:44] overnight success because no one who actually is an overnight success would describe it as

[09:47] overnight because they always say, you guys don't see the 10 years that it took me to get here.

[09:52] I mean, everyone wants recurring revenue, but no one wants recurring work.

[09:56] And so it's this idea that everyone wants to just like get, get, get forever.

[10:00] But no one wants to do do forever. And one doesn't come without the other.

[10:05] And oftentimes it's more like recurring work with zero recurring revenue.

[10:08] For a very long period of time before you get your first far less amount of revenue relative

[10:13] to the amount of recurring work you do. I mean, think about it. Until you win, effort always

[10:19] goes a notice. Get used to it. With whatever business you're getting into, the more difficult

[10:24] is to get into, the fewer entrance there will be. So the less competition you'll have to

[10:29] meet against with the more barriers you have. I'm always amazed at the amount of people who are

[10:33] like, man, this is hard. And they somehow say that like it's a bad day. If it's hard, good. It

[10:39] means no one else will do it more for you. Like the heart, the level of difficulty that you

[10:45] have to go through in order to get whatever you want is literally the barrier that everyone

[10:49] else has to go through in order to achieve it too. And so the bigger the goal that you have,

[10:53] the bigger the obstacles that you have to go to, which is why so few people will get it,

[10:57] which is what makes it worthwhile to begin with. If it were obviously easy, then everyone would do it,

[11:02] and then you wouldn't be a goal because everyone would have it. And right now it's not a big goal

[11:06] for people to breathe because everyone can breathe. It's not a big goal for people to put your shoes

[11:10] on the morning because everyone can do that. And so therefore it loses its value. What makes you

[11:13] exceptional is what you can do that other people can't do, which means stomaching the harder thing

[11:19] is the thing that makes you the exception.

[11:21] Graham, there we go. Oh that's the male lock. Oh, like where's the normal?

[11:32] I heard what's on this? I'm sweating a little bit. I was going to have a look. Yeah. Nice to meet you.

[11:36] Butter, butter. You guys should make an amazing podcast together. I have to say that it would

[11:41] be a crazy conversation. Oh, it's really in SuperCall. Yeah, but he's leaving right now for

[11:46] Oh fun. Okay. Cool. Yeah, cool. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

[12:02] There would be a fun debate. Oh, yeah. Sure. Oh, it's for you. Did you was a gift from you?

[12:08] No, no. What is one hour of your time worth?

[12:13] I don't know. I will probably wouldn't do anything for less than 50 grand.

[12:16] 50 grand. Let's just say for if someone wants to advice 50 grand and if this podcast is two hours

[12:23] long, whoever's watching this is theoretically getting a hundred thousand dollars of value just by listening to this.

[12:31] So I just want to practice it by saying stick around for the episode. You're getting a lot of value

[12:37] for this. Wow. Yeah. That was fantastic. Yeah. That's also good to have.

[12:41] Two of the point that you may have like why not make 50 million. I think that I want my brand to

[12:47] stand for something more than that. And so I made it the mission to make real business education

[12:53] successful for everyone. And that is what I have been. I have not waited for that since I started doing

[12:57] this. And I have two aspects that one is like the distribution of how do I get this to everybody?

[13:03] And how to make it accessible and that has multiple levels to it, which is one is like,

[13:06] is it easy to understand? But also like, is it fun and entertaining? And I'm getting better at that.

[13:10] I think I'm better at the easy to understand part. I'm still working on how to make this more entertaining.

[13:15] So that like a stay at home mom will actually click and maybe get interested in something like this.

[13:22] And maybe recommend her son or her daughter to like watch something like that. I'm not there yet.

[13:26] I like, but that's like in order for me to get that level of accessibility, like I need to get better.

[13:30] But on the flip side, the context that the content is consumed within is basically my background.

[13:35] So like at the very beginning, like hey just for everybody who doesn't know, here's this guy.

[13:38] Right, if I had said, hey, I make 100,000 more years. Listen to me.

[13:43] I mean, I think fewer people would listen to me. I mean, maybe somewhat. But like far fewer would

[13:49] listen to me as a quote, authority on making money in general. We can't have both growth and comfort.

[13:56] One is the price of the other. And so like if you're really comfortable, it's probably

[14:01] indication that you're plateau that you're in the same space. Which then means that you have to

[14:06] voluntarily go into pain in order to come out the other side better stronger faster.

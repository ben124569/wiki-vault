[00:00] Every business needs to solve each of these four problems

[00:03] in order to make more money and scale.

[00:06] And the first of those problems is figuring out the customer

[00:11] that you're actually going to serve.

[00:13] And in talking to many of you, the issue is you have no idea.

[00:18] And that's OK.

[00:20] Because in the beginning, you need to sell everyone

[00:23] because you have no money and they have a pulse and a credit card

[00:26] and you only require one of those things.

[00:28] And so you ask them for their credit card

[00:31] so that you can pay your bills so you can actually make your business work.

[00:34] And that's OK and that's normal and that's expected.

[00:36] But when you keep taking every single time

[00:40] to can hear you can give you a third down today and I'll pay when I get paid.

[00:43] And everything else they're like, hey, do you think you could give me the world

[00:47] and you're like, I could give you two worlds?

[00:48] And they're like, awesome.

[00:49] Here's my credit card.

[00:50] Again, bill me on the fifth.

[00:52] That's when I get paid.

[00:53] And you deal with all of these bad customers and you promise the world,

[00:57] which is normal in the beginning because there's only you.

[00:59] And you maybe can help this person in a completely unscalaboy

[01:02] and that's what you should do because you just need to generate income.

[01:05] You need to generate word of mouth.

[01:06] You need to help people out.

[01:07] Cool.

[01:09] But there comes a point and it's usually around a million bucks a year.

[01:12] Sometimes there's a million bucks a year where the operational complexity

[01:15] of the business becomes really tough.

[01:16] Because now you've got a lot of different customers

[01:19] that all have different needs that have different promises,

[01:21] a different price points that you've sold,

[01:22] and they're still just you.

[01:25] And so this process is the sticking point,

[01:29] this is sticking point number one.

[01:32] What you have to do is you have to learn how to say no

[01:36] to people who are not the ideal customer.

[01:38] And if you're like, well, I don't know who my deal a customer is,

[01:41] that is the problem.

[01:42] And so you take all of the customers that you have

[01:46] that you have sold over your entire history.

[01:48] And then you look at them and you say,

[01:49] which of these people do I love?

[01:51] Okay, call them one.

[01:53] Which of these people have spent the most money?

[01:55] Call them two.

[01:56] Which of these people did I have the highest operational profit from?

[02:00] Call them three.

[02:02] Call them four.

[02:03] Which of these was the easiest to deliver on?

[02:06] And so you look at these different lists and you're like,

[02:08] huh, are there any common themes?

[02:10] Are there any people who were two or three of those columns?

[02:13] I really like them.

[02:14] They made me a lot of money and it was really easy

[02:17] to deliver the thing.

[02:18] Huh.

[02:19] Well, that's weird because that's not the main thing that I sell.

[02:22] But I guess I have sold a few of those.

[02:24] Huh.

[02:24] Well, if you were to then take that concept and say,

[02:28] well, if 10% of my customers are in this really ideal bucket,

[02:32] what if I had 100% of my customers that were just like that?

[02:36] So you take the same amount of customers you currently have,

[02:38] but they were all just that customer.

[02:41] If you do the math again, you usually make five to 10 times more money.

[02:45] And the cool part about that process is that it doesn't require more infrastructure.

[02:49] You already have the infrastructure to serve as that number of customers.

[02:52] You're just serving the wrong people because you haven't learned to say,

[02:55] no yet.

[02:56] And so one of the most attractive things in marketing and sales

[02:58] is saying, I don't need your money because it makes everybody want you more.

[03:02] And so what you do to harness this is you tell everybody you actually don't want to sell.

[03:07] That you actually don't want to sell them.

[03:08] And crazy.

[03:09] And then you let the people who are the right type person,

[03:14] because they're like, oh, I'm not that.

[03:16] I'm not that.

[03:16] Hate those people too.

[03:17] Oh, and you say, but if you just happen to be this perfect unicorn,

[03:21] that has these two three four traits, I can absolutely change your life.

[03:25] In this very specific way, that means a lot to you.

[03:28] And they're like, wow, sounds like this adds just for me.

[03:30] And that's exactly what I want.

[03:32] And guess what happens now?

[03:34] Once you make that kind of change in messaging,

[03:37] you attract more of that right type of customer.

[03:40] You can now charge the premium price,

[03:42] even at the more operationally efficient and productized service level,

[03:45] because now you're doing the same thing for every single customer.

[03:48] So you get better at doing it.

[03:50] So you get higher percentage success rates.

[03:52] You do it at higher margins, because you both have higher price and lower costs for doing this.

[03:56] And this is how you solve problem number one.

[03:59] But you have to learn how to say no.

[04:00] And most people literally never learn.

[04:06] And so I get, I have had this conversation so many times

[04:10] that I want to shout it into a microphone, which is what I'm doing right out.

[04:14] Okay.

[04:16] So that's how you solve problem number one.

[04:20] Problem number two that I see businesses get stuck at where they're in rock and

[04:25] hard places.

[04:26] Like I don't know what to do.

[04:27] It's two sides of the same problem.

[04:29] You either charge too little or you pay too much.

[04:34] And I want to put caveats around this.

[04:36] I'm a big believer in hiring great talent.

[04:38] I'm a big believer in bringing good people in.

[04:41] Absolutely.

[04:42] But if you want to have a frozen yogurt store,

[04:44] and you want to pay the people behind the counter,

[04:46] 20% of revenue each, your business will not make money.

[04:52] From line I'm done.

[04:54] If you have a physical therapy, where you at,

[04:58] physical therapy clinic, and you give 50% of revenue to everyone of your people

[05:03] tough to scale.

[05:04] That was somebody here.

[05:09] You have to nail the individual model

[05:12] where you can make enough money at full capacity.

[05:17] And so which is going to trickle in a problem three.

[05:20] But you get into this position where like,

[05:22] wait, I realize now that I can't give profit share,

[05:25] a servicing person.

[05:26] I specifically can't give revenue shares to all these people.

[05:29] Or my salesmen can't make more than I do.

[05:34] In the business, and maybe they do in the beginning,

[05:36] but at scale they shouldn't be able to more than the owners.

[05:39] Then you have something that's mismatched.

[05:41] And so you have to have these moments

[05:44] because otherwise business owners will stay in this lane for years.

[05:48] Because they'll just say like,

[05:50] well, if I tell them I have to change the comp, then I'm going to lose them.

[05:53] And I'm like, yeah, and if you don't, you'll never grow.

[05:57] So which one do you want to do?

[05:58] And so the the the the pharious part about each of these

[06:01] problems is that they have a a purely impossible

[06:05] issues with each one of them.

[06:06] With the first one, you're like, well, I can't say no to money

[06:10] because I need the money in order to pay my bills.

[06:12] But by saying yes to people who aren't the ideal customer,

[06:14] then I will never be able to grow this business because I won't be able to

[06:17] charge the premium prices, get the best customers, have the operational

[06:20] margin that I need in order to expand.

[06:22] And so all of these are a rock and hard place problems.

[06:24] But you have to have the intestine afforded.

[06:26] And this is why your lifestyle is your competitors' opportunity.

[06:30] What you require to live on is what prevents you from being aggressive in the

[06:33] business to make the best decisions to the business.

[06:35] Because the business doesn't care.

[06:37] Like the ideal perfect version of your business exists.

[06:40] You just have a number of steps that you have to take to get there.

[06:43] And the people who get there faster are the ones who are willing to

[06:46] stomach uncomfortable conversations, low profit months,

[06:50] and a hit on their lifestyle for extended periods of time.

[06:54] And so you being able to be aggressive with your lifestyle and I say aggressive,

[06:57] I mean, being able to live on very little, especially when you're in that one, three,

[07:01] five million a year range allows you to take bigger risks, think longer,

[07:06] because you're like, okay, we're going to change this thing.

[07:09] Well, I've got a hundred grand saved up.

[07:12] And so I can stomach a year if I need to take nothing out so that we can make this

[07:17] pivot because this was right for the business now.

[07:19] And more specifically, this is right for the business for the next five years.

[07:23] And so rock and hard place.

[07:25] So if you're with the, I have all these employees and they're all

[07:28] compensated incorrectly, you have to sit down and you have to say, hey, guys,

[07:33] and this is how I deal with all really hard conversations.

[07:36] I just told the truth, I messed up.

[07:39] I said that I was going to help you guys grow with this business.

[07:42] I said we were going to do these big things, but based on the decisions that I made,

[07:46] because I'm a numb nuts, I mispriced your compensation.

[07:50] And because of that, I'll never be able to give you career growth.

[07:52] I'll never be able to reinvest in you.

[07:54] I'll never be able to be the opportunity to open new locations or move up in this business,

[07:57] because this business will not grow.

[07:59] Based on how this works.

[08:01] But if you're willing to go on this ride with me and change your compensation works

[08:05] and to be clear, I'm taking nothing.

[08:07] So like you work every month and you're still going to paycheck.

[08:10] I work every month and I get poor.

[08:12] That's the difference.

[08:13] So I just want to be clear, I'm in this ride with you and I'm not asking you something.

[08:16] I'm not willing to do.

[08:17] But if you're willing to go on this ride with me for six months, maybe 12 months,

[08:20] we're going to have opportunities to meet 10 times bigger than this,

[08:22] because it's going to be right for the business.

[08:24] But you have to have that talk.

[08:25] Otherwise, you will be stuck in this.

[08:27] Well, if they leave, then I won't have a business.

[08:30] And some of them will leave.

[08:31] And guess what skill you get to develop now?

[08:34] The ability to recruit talent with your new compensation structure,

[08:36] with your new vision of what's going to happen in their lives,

[08:39] along with your business.

[08:41] So that's the second problem.

[08:42] And the second stick of point.

[08:43] And each of these are just these levels that people just go around.

[08:46] And they just say, stuck for years.

[08:49] This part 2B of that one is not charging enough.

[08:57] And so this is how it presents.

[09:00] Hey, my business is at full capacity.

[09:03] My business is at full capacity.

[09:06] And we're not making that much money.

[09:09] And so I think I need to open a new location,

[09:12] or I need to add another product line.

[09:14] When this is the core thing of the business.

[09:17] If the core thing of the business at capacity, even at a small level of capacity,

[09:22] like if you have one rep that can handle 10 people for your agency,

[09:26] or you have one physical therapist who can handle 50 patients,

[09:29] it doesn't matter.

[09:30] There's going to be some ratio of cost of good sold and what you charge,

[09:34] and then you have other costs associated, administrative, and fixed costs, whatever.

[09:38] And there's going to be a point of capacity with that small unit,

[09:44] where if you're still not making money,

[09:46] the business model is flawed.

[09:48] And so either you need to find a way to dramatically decrease the cost that you have to deliver,

[09:52] which sometimes is the compensation of the employee's image if it's way off.

[09:56] Or oftentimes, it's just you're charging too little.

[10:01] And there's all these ethical things of like, I feel like an imposter,

[10:05] and like, dude, you're not an imposter, you're broke.

[10:09] You only get an imposter syndrome when you pretend to be something you're not.

[10:14] Like, this question all the time,

[10:15] like, I feel like an imposter for charging that much money.

[10:19] You only feel like an imposter because you're lying.

[10:21] If you, like I had an agency under yesterday,

[10:24] we said, I had an agency, I got to 150 clients,

[10:27] and I have a really good client-gating system,

[10:30] but that business stalled because I didn't know how to operate,

[10:34] and so it kind of like crashed and burned,

[10:36] but I knew how to get customers for my agency really, really well.

[10:40] And he's like, but I feel like an imposter, charging for that system.

[10:43] And I was like, why?

[10:46] And I was like, is it because you're pretending you were really successful agency under?

[10:49] And he was like, yeah, I was like, well, then why don't you just tell the truth

[10:54] and say, I got 150 customers, despite not knowing anything about running an agency,

[10:59] because the system's really good.

[11:00] I suck at operating, and so for that reason,

[11:02] I'm just going to give you the system, and you can figure out how to operate the business.

[11:06] I was like, I still believe you, and then you don't feel like shit.

[11:09] He was like, oh, I guess I can just tell the truth.

[11:13] And so the whole imposter syndrome we're on charging,

[11:16] if fundamentally, if someone, like, you will only have that,

[11:19] if you're misrepresenting something, if a customer wants to pay you for something,

[11:24] and you have the thing, and they're willing to exchange is voluntary,

[11:27] not holding a gun to them.

[11:28] It's voluntary exchange, that's how capitalism works.

[11:30] You have a thing, they want the thing, and there's a price that they're willing to pay for it.

[11:33] If they're willing to pay for it, phenomenal.

[11:36] Like, that's capitalism. We want.

[11:37] And so we try and do it as many times as we can.

[11:39] And so the idea of having ethics around prices ridiculous,

[11:42] if they're willing, and you don't want to sell out of your wallity,

[11:45] if you're broke, but the thing that you provide provides a lot of value to a specific person,

[11:49] then you charge based on the value, not based on what's in your wallet.

[11:52] If you're broke, and you're like, this really would help me,

[11:53] is like, cool, it'll probably help them even more.

[11:56] And if it just happens to help you, that's how capitalism works.

[11:59] Both parties say, thank you.

[12:01] So, part two B, if you're at full capacity, and you're not making money,

[12:07] you often need to just charge more for the thing you have.

[12:10] And if people say, no, fine, guess what you get to learn?

[12:14] How to sell better?

[12:16] And that's a skill that if you want to build this big business,

[12:18] you're going to have to learn anyways.

[12:19] She might as well face that boss now.

[12:21] Instead of just forever being in this, like, I guess I need to expand this business

[12:25] that already doesn't work, but I don't have the money to expand,

[12:27] because the business doesn't work, right?

[12:29] And since this is impossible place that you spend for years and years.

[12:34] Where's my phone?

[12:35] I wrote them down. I should know them all, but

[12:38] sometimes I forget things.

[12:40] So let's see, what do we think problem number four is?

[12:42] Or number three is?

[12:44] Oh, that actually leads perfectly.

[12:45] So, I remembered it before I pulled it up for the record.

[12:50] The third problem that every business has to solve is not getting over your

[12:55] skis, not over expanding, okay?

[12:58] So, problem two often leads to problem three.

[13:01] Is that you're not making enough in the core business,

[13:03] you say, great, I'll do more of this.

[13:05] But more in that instance is more of the wrong thing.

[13:10] Like a little bit isn't working, let's try a lot.

[13:12] Right? You're scaling, you're scaling the problems, not the solution.

[13:16] And so, right? Glad that I'm hit.

[13:21] And so, and so the idea, and this happens most frequently,

[13:26] I want to say most frequently with brick and mortar,

[13:28] because it's such a clear unit where you're like,

[13:31] I have one location that's doing mediocre,

[13:33] but I want to have a big French.

[13:35] Like, I can't tell you the number of times I talk to local businesses

[13:37] who have this issue.

[13:38] And it's mostly because we have this ego thing around growing revenue.

[13:43] And so, a lot of you guys are like, then I say, what's your goal?

[13:45] It's like, I want to get from 1 million, 3 million, 3 million,

[13:47] 3 million, it's 10 million, 10 million, 10 million, 10 million,

[13:48] 30 million, whatever it is.

[13:49] Right? Like, everybody's got this big number goal.

[13:51] And so, what happens is you make the goal the thing that you focus on.

[13:54] But when the goal isn't output,

[13:57] you then get weird about inputs because you try and make the output a curve.

[14:01] Rather than thinking, I have to fix this model

[14:04] where once I get the inputs clear,

[14:07] I jam as many high quality inputs into it,

[14:10] and then revenue occurs.

[14:13] Revenue is a consequence, not goal.

[14:16] And so, the inputs that we put in the system,

[14:18] so when we make what we're going to do for content,

[14:20] we talk about how many pieces of content we're going to make,

[14:22] what's the schedule that content is?

[14:23] What's the checklist we're going to follow that will increase the likelihood

[14:26] that these video views go to the right people

[14:29] and get the most of them to see it.

[14:30] If we hit 100 million, like, who cares? Of course we care,

[14:36] but what will it change about what we do?

[14:40] All we know is that it'll just give us feedback to change our inputs.

[14:44] But if you make me hitting this number and not attach it

[14:48] to what you have to do, then you start building really stupid things.

[14:53] And so, this is the classic internet marketer who scales too fast,

[14:56] for their core businesses, the agency who just takes

[14:59] on lots of clients because they want to hit this revenue goal,

[15:01] or the brick and mortar business owner who opens up a second location

[15:04] when their first one isn't even working.

[15:06] And so, it's like, they want to get to three so fast

[15:10] that they'll never get to 10.

[15:12] And so, we did that little thing earlier where,

[15:14] if you build a building as fast as you possibly can,

[15:18] you can't add more on top of it.

[15:20] It just breaks. The foundation is not there.

[15:23] And so, oftentimes, the fastest way to 100 million dollar business

[15:27] is slower to 10, but faster from 50 to 100.

[15:32] And so, if you can actually have that perspective,

[15:34] you won't care if it takes you three years to get the single location right,

[15:38] because once it's dialed, then when you copy paste it, it works.

[15:45] And so, the big thing that's missing when you're doing the over-expansion thing,

[15:50] I'll tell you what the core issue is.

[15:52] It's who?

[15:54] You sell too many people too fast before you hire and train good enough people to backfill.

[16:02] And then you get too many people in with not enough talent,

[16:06] but you have bodies and not brains.

[16:08] And so, now you have to keep selling more people to manage your overhead of all these dumb people

[16:12] that you haven't taken the time to train.

[16:14] And they're dumb because of outputs and the reason that they're dumb is because you didn't train them.

[16:17] And the real dummy is you.

[16:19] Because either you weren't patient enough to interview more people,

[16:21] or you weren't patient enough to train them,

[16:23] but both of them are your fault.

[16:26] So, you get overexpended because you have this arbitrary goal

[16:32] that was around growth and not quality.

[16:35] Quality creates growth, growth creates blow.

[16:38] So, if you make growth the goal, blow is what occurs.

[16:42] If you make quality the goal, growth occurs as a result.

[16:46] So, make getting better the goal and then you will get bigger.

[16:48] If you make bigger the goal, you'll get bigger and you'll get worse.

[16:52] And so, when I hear the many problems that come here,

[16:56] oftentimes you're over your skis, you overextend,

[16:59] you have too many people and non enough smarts.

[17:01] And so, rock in hard place.

[17:04] I have to keep selling these customers so I can cover this overhead,

[17:07] but my reputation is getting worse and worse and worse,

[17:09] because I can't deliver on the promises,

[17:10] but I have to keep making the promises so I can pay my bills.

[17:14] And that's where your lifestyle comes into play again.

[17:16] You're like, I made a goof up.

[17:19] I needed to decrease my lifestyle.

[17:20] I'm going to stop taking money out of the business.

[17:23] And I need to have some hard conversations

[17:24] and I probably need to work overtime for a while.

[17:27] The thing is, is that the overtime isn't like a week or a month.

[17:30] Sometimes it's years.

[17:34] And it's tough, you know?

[17:36] Like it's tough.

[17:37] You give up weekends over and over and over again.

[17:40] It's not like you give up weekends.

[17:41] You just have, you don't remember the last time you took one.

[17:44] And so, I say this out of care.

[17:46] But like, you have to be like the hardest part of being in business is that

[17:54] you will always encounter these rock and heart-place scenarios

[17:57] because you don't know everything.

[17:59] And until you've been there, you're like,

[18:01] this is all going great until it's not.

[18:03] And then you realize you're woopsy.

[18:05] And so I think your willingness to endure the pain of undoing your poor decision

[18:10] is what will get you out of the long-term pain faster.

[18:14] But the short-term pain is way worse.

[18:17] And so, and this is where the growing pains come in because

[18:20] let's say you do pull it back.

[18:22] You stop selling as many new customers so that you can focus more on training the team up,

[18:27] interviewing new candidates.

[18:29] Maybe even having to pay them more because they're more qualified

[18:32] because they come in with some knowledge that you don't have.

[18:35] Profit starts to drip.

[18:37] Starts to dip.

[18:38] So what do you do?

[18:39] Well, you know that if you keep going on this path

[18:42] and you do fix delivery, you do fix turn.

[18:44] All of a sudden, you can't get your head back out of water because now you're selling people in their

[18:48] staying and all of a sudden you're starting to get referrals again because

[18:51] word of mouth is picking up.

[18:52] And then all of a sudden your profit goes back from negative to neutral,

[18:57] to up to your previous max, but then just keeps going again.

[19:00] And then you get excited and you make another dumb mistake.

[19:02] And then you have to repeat the process again.

[19:04] And so the thing is is like the entrepreneurial growth pass,

[19:07] the pain of it is the big mess up that you realize you make that you then get into the rock

[19:14] and heart situation.

[19:15] And most people can't make a decision so they just straddle it,

[19:18] and stay in the mediocre middle, destroy the reputation, and stay stagnant for years.

[19:23] And so you have to like whatever that hard,

[19:25] sticking place you're at is, is you just have to confront it as fast as you

[19:28] really possible.

[19:29] And so it's like I always would rather have an intense short term pain rather than very long

[19:33] term pain of not living up to what I think I can do.

[19:38] So that's sticking point number three.

[19:41] Number four.

[19:45] I will say this until I'm blue in the face.

[19:50] But the fourth problem that every business owner has to conquer is focus.

[19:57] And what is so nefarious about focus, it's so sneaky because

[20:03] we're rewarded as entrepreneurs for taking a leap of faith,

[20:06] for taking a jump when there's nothing there, and then something starts to work.

[20:09] And so that's such a rewarding experience.

[20:12] You go from complete control to complete freedom.

[20:14] Well technically you go back to control again, but I won't get into that.

[20:17] And in that moment you're like this was the best decision of my entire life.

[20:22] And the problem is that you should never do it again.

[20:26] Because what happens is you reinforce such a strong loop where you're like man.

[20:30] And then when this gets hard like my job was you then think oh I'll do the same thing I did last time.

[20:36] I'll switch, I'll try something new.

[20:39] And then that'll be exciting.

[20:41] And new just like in your relationship and then all of a sudden you get out of the honeymoon phase

[20:45] and you realize oh there's problems in this business too.

[20:48] And then you're like oh I'll do it work that other time.

[20:50] It's still work half of the time.

[20:52] And so then you jump again.

[20:54] But the reason that it's so nefarious besides the fact that it's encoded in your DNA from being an entrepreneur

[20:58] from quitting your first thing to do this to begin with is that every time it looks different.

[21:04] And that's why focus is so tough.

[21:06] And there's always a very strong argument for why you should do the new opportunity.

[21:12] And that's why by the way as a sales pitch new opportunity is a great way to sell.

[21:18] Because it's so hard to have the discipline to be like nope I'm just going to keep doing

[21:24] the thing that I've been doing for 10 years and I know the good and I know the bad but I know

[21:29] I'm both.

[21:31] And I know where I'm deficient and I just need to do these things better for the next six months.

[21:36] And if I just do those things better we will grow by 50 percent.

[21:39] And here's the fun fact about this is that once you get to a million a month, five million a month,

[21:44] 10 million a month, 100 grand a month, whatever.

[21:48] Going from that to 50 percent more, a lot easier than going from zero to whatever number you were just at.

[21:58] So if you have your current thing you forget how much you've learned about what you're in.

[22:02] You're in there for three years, five years.

[22:04] However many years have been in real estate, right? A lot.

[22:08] And we forget about it. But this other thing has all of these booby traps all over it.

[22:12] Right? This lady in the red dress has climidious. She's got daddy issues. She's got an

[22:17] ex-boyfriend with with a guy who's who stalks her. Right? You don't know yet because she presents

[22:22] the same because anybody in a first-day can look good. Anybody on one she it's like,

[22:26] hey, my buddy's making an a killing on this. Right? And he's like, oh yeah, I married her sister.

[22:30] Didn't tell you about the baggage, right? It's that's part of it. And that's why the focus part is so

[22:36] tough and I had to define focus for myself and I'll define two words for you because it's helpful for me.

[22:41] So one is commitment. What is commitment? A lot of you guys are like, I'm committed.

[22:49] Commitment is the elimination of alternatives. Very simple. And so if you want to become more committed,

[22:56] you will eliminate alternatives. And so there's an old story of this where the football coach asks

[23:06] one of the kids on the football team out to breakfast. And so you know they're sitting there

[23:11] having a good time talking about this game, talking about his future. He says, you know, I'd like to play

[23:14] college ball. And he's like, I think you could. I think you could play college ball. It's like,

[23:19] but you might not, too. He's like, well, what do I have to do? He's like, well, it depends.

[23:26] He's like depends on what? He leans in. He's like, are you interested? You committed. He's like,

[23:31] well, I'm, I'm committed. He's like, I don't know if you are. He says, you see your plate.

[23:38] He's got eggs and he's got ham on his plate. He says, the chicken, the chicken's interested. He's like,

[23:44] the pig, the pigs committed. And the point there is that in order for that breakfast to occur,

[23:50] the chicken keep having eggs over and over and over again. But that pig only has one breakfast

[23:54] survey. And so the same way is that we have to eliminate alternatives. It's what we, like,

[24:00] the word decision comes from Latin Dicadere, which means to literally cut off or to kill off.

[24:06] And so the idea is, what are, what are you killing today? What really juicy, incredibly sexy

[24:13] opportunity that you know you could crush, you turn down today, because you made a commitment.

[24:19] And I've, I've been thinking a lot about the decisions of my life that if I had the biggest return.

[24:25] And the more I've thought about this, the more I think that, actually I'll read this, I'll read this to you,

[24:31] because I think it might come across better that way. So I wrote this down earlier today,

[24:39] which is, the best diet is the one you follow. The best person to marrying is the one you stay with.

[24:48] The best business is the one you stick with. The thing that makes it the best isn't the thing itself,

[24:55] it's our commitment to it. And so there's a lot of different diets that work if you stick with it.

[25:01] There's a lot of different businesses that will work for you, if you stick with it,

[25:05] but none of the diets will work if you don't. And none of the businesses will work either.

[25:10] And I think it's a very good framework. There's a perfect diet for you that's perfectly measured,

[25:14] and we'll get you the absolute fastest results. But if you do not stick with it, it won't happen.

[25:19] Ever. And so it's not about the actual intricacies of the diet,

[25:24] it's about your willingness to stick it out. And so when you listen to Basos and you live into

[25:30] Steve Jobs and you listen to Sam Alman, who was in charge of YC before he started opening a I.

[25:35] They talk with this one thing and they're like, you know, the more I've thought about it,

[25:38] it's just persistence. It's just being willing to stay the course, despite all odds,

[25:44] despite the many shiny objects that come your way and just say, I get it. No.

[25:51] So commitment is the elimination of alternatives. And I measure focus by the number and quality of

[25:55] things I say no to. And so if you want to give yourself a rapid reward cycle, which I like to do

[25:59] because the hardest of these ones that I struggle with is focus is that every time I say no,

[26:05] I give myself a mental point. It's like, I'm focused. I'm making an active decision to stay focused.

[26:11] Because I know that if I just only stay focused, like it's hard to imagine a guy or a guy who's an

[26:16] entrepreneur and does just one business for 50 years and consistently has the hard conversations

[26:23] and just says, I'm going to get better. I'm going to keep learning. I'm not going to repeat the same

[26:27] mistakes and they do that for 50 years and doesn't become unbelievably successful. It's hard to imagine

[26:34] a world where that would exist. And so we have this blank check from the universe that says,

[26:38] I guarantee that you will be successful. No matter what, if you do one thing, which is you just say

[26:44] no to everything else. And so when I have these conversations, the woman in the red dress always presents

[26:50] differently and that's why she's so sneaky. And there's always a very legitimate reason why you could

[26:57] make money with it. And the reality is you could. But you can't do two things. You can't be

[27:03] CEO of two businesses. You can own multiple businesses. But I'm going to be real with you.

[27:09] You don't. You're CEO of both. And you're running everything. Right? No, no, no. I've

[27:14] scaled myself out of the day today. So if something happens to the business, what happens? My phone rings.

[27:18] Right. You're not out of the day today. If you buy a share of Apple, you're out of the day today.

[27:23] All right. You're an owner. And so use that as your litmus test. Do I own this business or

[27:28] this business own me? If it owns you, then you're a CEO. Welcome to business. Right? And so

[27:34] there's this big misnomer between I'm an owner and I'm a CEO and a lot of people say I'm a small

[27:38] business owner. But you really don't own the business for a very long time. Like until you get

[27:42] to 10, 20 million dollars a year, very tough to own a business. The business owns you. Come at

[27:47] that's okay. Because what else you get at it? Right? You're going to work anyways. So you have to

[27:51] be on the path. But I think it's good to have clarity around that because the amount of time

[27:55] is like I've got this new opportunity vehicle. And people always quote my story back to me.

[28:00] They're like, hey, but you had the gyms and then you started doing the turnaround business.

[28:05] Yeah, I was 26 and before that I had nine businesses and I made no money. And so this was a big

[28:12] improvement for me. Right? But the real question is not did it work, but was there alternative

[28:19] that would have also worked? Which is if I had just stuck with gyms being super real at this

[28:24] point of my life, I probably have two or three hundred locations. Probably worth the same amount of money

[28:27] I'm new. And so there's the fallacy of success, which is if I do this thing, it will work and the

[28:36] fact that it works meant that it was the right call, but you can have multiple outcomes that lead you

[28:41] to where you want to go. But when you straddle multiple is where you guarantee that you'll never

[28:47] get there. And I'm just saying this and trying to beat this into ground because one I shouting at me,

[28:54] mostly. But also because it's probably a third of the conversations I have on a regular basis.

[29:02] And the craziest thing is that all the problems I just said have nothing to do with

[29:06] on the more leads. I need to learn how to sell better. I need to follow up my leads faster.

[29:10] You know, I'm not retaining customers. None of that. These are the things that get you stuck.

[29:16] These are very easy problems to solve. Market more. Do more reps on the sales. Reach out faster.

[29:22] These are not complicated things. But it's all this crap that we stay stuck in because we

[29:27] stay in these rock and hard place scenarios, which are the real core issues. And the last problem

[29:32] bonus that I see on a regular basis that walks through these doors is you have a product and you don't have a

[29:40] business. So you sell one widget, one time, to one person. There's no back end, there's no upsell,

[29:49] there's no recurring, there's no revenue retention. That's from the strict definition of a business.

[29:56] It makes money. So it is technically a business. But it is not an asset that is valuable.

[30:02] And so that's something that you will consistently have to put inputs into rather than it be self-sustaining.

[30:08] And so I've always been in the world in the world and probably you are too. We're like, I will

[30:12] solve any problem no matter how complex once. But I don't like having to solve them the same thing

[30:19] over and over and over and over again. But when you're in that business, you have to just keep doing

[30:24] the same thing over and over again. And the day that you stop is the day that it dies. Which really

[30:29] just means that it's an amplified version of you in terms of a job. Which again is fine. But I would

[30:35] rather build an asset that I can own rather than just a slightly fancier higher leverage job for myself.

[30:41] If I can afford to do it. And so when you're thinking about this with your business,

[30:48] to be clear, it's selling a better or extra version or recurring version of whatever your thing is.

[30:55] So that people will buy again. Now, there are businesses where it is reoccurring rather than

[31:00] recurring. Coca-Cola doesn't have a subscription, but they know that I buy and I will buy again.

[31:05] And so if people are not buying your product again, then figure out why. And if your business is one

[31:12] that doesn't lend itself to that at all, that's one where I would say, look at the other

[31:17] businesses that are super billion dollar businesses in your space, that what have they solved that you

[31:23] have it and then that becomes your path. And if there is no business, that is in your space, that

[31:28] sells that one thing. That's very big, not all businesses are worth owning. And you might think,

[31:32] wait, Alex, I thought that I had to stick with the hard thing. And so the fundamental, this is the

[31:39] different rock and hard place is one of the quintessential questions of entrepreneurship.

[31:43] Is, do I push or do I pivot? And so, nine times at a ten, you have to push. It just means

[31:51] I have a problem that I don't know how to solve. And if you have a problem that you can at least

[31:55] define the problem, then you can try and solve it. If you have an issue that the market fundamentally

[32:03] like wedding rings, if you can only sell one redding ring and you have no desire to create more

[32:11] wedding rings, and you're not a jeweler, then it's probably not the right business for you. Now,

[32:15] the caveat there is that there's probably a jeweler who that is the perfect business for. And love

[32:20] doing all sorts of wedding rings, then also gets into the girls' rings and gets into multiple rings

[32:24] and expounds from that because they have a specific after they can serve. So there is a version

[32:28] of this business that could work. But businesses don't die. Entrepreneurs feed. Entrepreneurs lose their

[32:38] sizzle. They lose their love of the business. And so one of the things that has helped me

[32:44] stay in love with businesses that I have for longer periods of time. And I've had to learn these

[32:49] disciplines because that's what it takes to stick with something for a very long time. And if I know

[32:55] that sticking with something for a very long time is which required to build this very big thing

[32:58] that I want to do, then I better learn that skill. And so learning to relive new things in the

[33:03] business, which I like to frame as, what do I not know how to do? And so I love personal development.

[33:10] I think that entrepreneurship is one of the best paths to making yourself better. Because you have

[33:14] such a quantitative measure of saying, did you improve? And so simply saying, I don't know how to,

[33:21] rather than this business won't work because is a much more empowering frame. So rather than

[33:27] say, hey, this business won't work because the market doesn't like my stuff. You say, I don't know

[33:33] how to market my stuff. This business won't work because no one can sell like I can. No,

[33:41] I don't know how to get someone else to sell like I can. That's solvable. And so simply reframing

[33:47] what I believe to be problems that I cast under the universe is things that I cannot change,

[33:51] where I place the finger of blame, you flipped at the thumb of accountability and say,

[33:55] this is a skill deficiency. And because it is mine, I can change it. And so thinking about things

[34:01] from that perspective has really helped me be able to fall in love with the game of business

[34:07] because I can constantly feel and see myself objectively get better. These are skills I didn't have

[34:13] and now I do have this. I couldn't focus on anything for more than six months in the very beginning

[34:17] of my career. I'm more ADD than you. I promise I have no direct reports. Zero. Can't manage people.

[34:25] I don't have the skill. The question is, what return do I get on learning everything that

[34:30] Layla has? Well, she spent the last decade doing it. So that's not going to be a good return

[34:34] on my time. And so, but for her to try and learn all the acquisition and market stuff that I know,

[34:39] is it could not be a good return on her time. And so that's how we divide things up. And so I

[34:42] can go deeper and better on mine. And that's how you start filling out the holes in a business.

[34:45] Because fundamentally, every business operates trying to give a non-body building example.

[34:54] But you need every component of a car to work. Is the wheel more important than the engine?

[35:06] You need both. If you don't have an engine, the car doesn't move. If you don't have wheels, the car doesn't

[35:10] move. You don't have a chassis? There's no car. Right? Like, there's these core components that

[35:16] have to exist. But once you have those things, if you have better grip on the tires, the car will

[35:22] go faster. If you have more cylinders in there, I don't know the car now. Just be at the idea.

[35:26] If you have faster engine, the car goes faster. And so you can still have components that can get

[35:31] emphasized. But for the business to work, you have to have all the pieces to go from zero to one.

[35:38] But from one to end, it's how many of these things are we emphasizing. And that's where you can

[35:42] double down on things. But being able to say the problem of this business is that this is the issue.

[35:49] We can't get this engine needs to be a 16 cylinder and it's an eight cylinder. Okay. So I either have to

[35:54] learn how to build a 16 cylinder engine or I got to find somebody who does. Or I got to buy a 16

[36:01] cylinder engine from somebody else. Right? But that's how you have to approach it. And so,

[36:06] continually re-learning that process has helped me stick with things because I don't feel like I'm

[36:11] in the same business anymore. I feel like every six months I'm going to completely different business

[36:15] because the problem is solving or different. And so, I'll leave you with this one last thought.

[36:20] Which is that number one, I genuinely believe if you love the business or space that you're in,

[36:25] you can take any business to a hundred billion. I like I want to challenge somebody to tell me

[36:29] like a business that can't take 200 million dollars a year. I think you can absolutely take any

[36:32] business to 100 million dollars a year. The second thing is that when you scale any business,

[36:38] no matter the market, at the highest level, your day is the same. You manage a handful of

[36:44] very intelligent people who do their jobs on your behalf with lots of leverage. That's the end

[36:50] result of all of these businesses. Whatever business you're in. And so, if you're in that spot,

[36:54] we're like, I don't like the business I'm in. You're going to get to the same spot in a different

[36:59] business that you also won't like. You have to beat the boss so that you can eventually get to the

[37:04] place where, fundamentally, you're going to have ahead of marketing. You're going to have ahead of sales.

[37:08] You're going to have an IT, head, you're going to have ahead of legal. You're going to have ahead of finance.

[37:12] You're going to have ahead of an option and customer success. Every business has it different words

[37:17] for different industries, but fundamentally, there's the components. And so, if you see that

[37:21] as the natural extreme that's going to occur in any business, the idea of switching businesses

[37:25] because you want to avoid what the natural extreme will be is ridiculous. Because if you succeed,

[37:30] you all roads lead there. And so, that is one of my antidotes for a weight I should switch,

[37:36] because my day to day, what I actually do, will not change. And neither will yours. And so,

[37:43] you have to push through. You have to confront the fact that it will suck and you have to

[37:47] undo mistakes and when you undo mistakes it hurts extra bad. But the alternative is you never

[37:51] fix the mistake and you ever grow. Which I think is the larger mistake overall. So, those are the

[37:55] big five that people get in the rock and hard place for business. I see these every single time.

[38:02] I have these conversations over and over again at everyone thinks that their situation is unique,

[38:08] that they can't raise prices because their market is special. They can't change the

[38:15] compensation to ours because everyone will leave. Yup, and they're going to leave eventually anyway.

[38:18] See, mys will learn how to fix it now. And they think that in order to hit the goal,

[38:23] like they have to keep selling even though they're overexcended, they have no one to help them.

[38:27] You're right. Keep doing that forever. Tell me all that works.

[38:31] Right? Each of these problems feels in the moment less bad to keep doing it,

[38:37] but what you have to do is confront it. And that's the boss that you have to beat at that level.

[38:41] So, thank you guys so much for the ads. Hope you guys enjoyed the workshop.

[38:45] Appreciate you. And then

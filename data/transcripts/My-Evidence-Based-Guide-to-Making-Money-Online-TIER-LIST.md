[00:00] I've grown my brand over 10 million subscribers across all platforms, and in this video I'm gonna break down

[00:06] by tier which of these platforms has the highest potential for making money with my real up-to-date

[00:12] stats and where I'm investing for the next year. So let's start with TikTok.

[00:16] So if we're gonna analyze platforms based on how much money making potential they have inside of them,

[00:21] then these are the stats that I care about. First is who? So who's on this platform? If there's a platform

[00:26] with tons of kids on it versus people who have gazillions of dollars, I'd rather be on the one with gazillions

[00:30] dollars. How many of those people are in the platform is a function of how much market share that

[00:36] particular platform is captured of my ideal who? Next we have what's my ability to grow in the platform?

[00:42] Some platforms are really easy to grow, some platforms are really hard to grow. The next one is the

[00:46] death because I don't want people to just recognize my face although that is good, but I'd

[00:51] much rather have them have a good relationship with me where I can provide tons of value

[00:55] which then increases the likelihood of them converting. And then finally I'm gonna give you the

[01:00] results that I have. Now underneath of death I'll also give you a little bit more intrinsic stats like

[01:05] average uteration, average percentage viewed so you can look at your own stats and kind of have that as a

[01:10] benchmark. So let's start with who? I looked at Pew Research to see which percentage of platforms have

[01:16] a hundred thousand dollar families or higher and how many of them are on that platform.

[01:20] Want to know what it is for TikTok? It's 27%. All right, so 27% of family so almost one out three out of four

[01:28] are not on TikTok who make over a hundred thousand dollars a year. That was surprising to me, but when you

[01:33] hear some of the rest of the stats it'll become less surprising. The next question is how many do we have here?

[01:40] And so this is a function of market share within the United States which on TikTok is 33%. Now we're like

[01:46] okay, so we've got a low-ish amount of people who make money. There's 33% market share across the

[01:51] US at least. Now let's talk about growth. Now on TikTok growth is one of the highest and best components

[01:58] of TikTok as in it's one of the easiest ones to grow. But I will say that in recent history it's

[02:03] become harder and harder to grow and because of the way that they've changed the algorithm what we've

[02:08] noticed is that shorts on one platform don't necessarily work on TikTok anymore. And so now it's

[02:14] platform-specific. Something that works on Facebook girls might not work on. Instagram rills,

[02:18] then might not work on YouTube shorts, which might not work on TikTok. And so it's actually

[02:22] becoming more and more fragmented, which is why this video is so important so you put your attention

[02:26] where matters most. With all that being said, TikTok still ranks high among the platforms in terms

[02:34] of discoverability and your ability to grow from zero, meaning it favors newer creators. Now it's

[02:39] still maybe hard, but it still favors people equally versus other platforms where they still

[02:46] skew towards larger creators. So when it comes to depth our next marker, it's about how much time

[02:51] are they going to actually spend per unit of content that we put out. So TikTok ranks really low here.

[02:57] So on the low side you get something like five seconds to 20 seconds. At least these are the

[03:02] statistics that we have on the low to high side in terms of duration per view. Now mind you,

[03:07] that's not a lot of time to provide a ton of value, especially if you're someone's immediately

[03:11] scrolling immediately scrolling. And if you absolutely murder it and you get 25 seconds from them,

[03:15] I think the main benefit you get is that they just recognize your face. I can almost tell whenever

[03:19] I get recognized in public when someone is a TikTok viewer because they're like, you're that guy,

[03:24] I don't know your name, but yeah, I see you, right? Versus people on like YouTube or like,

[03:29] dude, you've changed my life. You've made me so much money. You're the best. I know your name.

[03:34] I bought your book. It's completely different avatar in terms of the experience. So then we have

[03:38] conversion. Now TikTok has two things that are kind of interesting that you might not know. So number one,

[03:43] Gen Z prefers Instagram DMs to TikTok DMs. And so in terms of your ability to convert people from

[03:50] TikTok, it actually tends to be significantly lower. Now for very low ticket things, things like

[03:55] TikTok shop or coming out or having massive adoption, which is encouraging, but if you're selling any kind of

[04:01] services, which 78% of businesses are, this one's kind of tough. And so I'm going to put this as low.

[04:06] And to be clear, TikTok a couple of years ago was amazing for new creators because it was the first

[04:12] one that had short videos, which is easier for someone to get into. It's much harder to make a 20

[04:17] minute high production, nice valuable piece of content for YouTube versus a 15 second short

[04:22] that you could put on TikTok. But then the other platforms caught on and you got YouTube shorts,

[04:26] Instagram reels, the Facebook reels, and all the other platforms that have short linked in

[04:31] has shorts now, like they're all over the place. And so let's get to the results. And this is where

[04:36] it gets really crazy. And so I have almost 900,000 followers on TikTok at the point of this video.

[04:42] And the amount of traffic that I get for my TikTok, despite being about a tenth of my follower

[04:49] is only 2.5% of all of the traffic that goes to my page, which I've tracked on our CRM.

[04:58] And so it basically has one fourth, the effectiveness per unit compared to the other platforms,

[05:05] which means that some other platforms are disproportionately making up the volume.

[05:10] And the whole reason I wanted to collect all this data for me was because there was a

[05:13] business owner who was a winner of the school games, so school.com for its dash games.

[05:18] And when he came out he was like, yeah, it's really weird. I have 800,000 on TikTok,

[05:23] and I have 200,000 on Instagram, but 90% of my revenue comes from Instagram. And I thought about

[05:29] that and I was like, wait a second. So think about this. The amount of time that he spends on

[05:32] TikTok could he spend all of that time on Instagram and get 10% more to make up for all of it.

[05:39] And the answer is probably yes. And so that totally changed my perspective in terms of thinking

[05:44] wait a second. We want to grow everywhere, but there's definitely some platforms where we get

[05:48] higher returns for our avatar, which is business owners. And so for you and your avatar,

[05:55] looking at the stats should give you where you should put your time so you can make the most money.

[05:59] Especially if you're on a budget and you can't do 10 platforms, right? You can maybe just do

[06:04] one or two, you should do the ones that make you the most. And by the way, if you want to check

[06:08] out one of our workshops, you can go to acquisition.com. We'd love to talk to you. It's for business owners

[06:11] only. So if you don't have a business, go to school.com and we can help you start one. With all this

[06:17] taken into consideration, what am I doing with my TikTok strategy? I am rating it an F. And it's

[06:24] something that I'm not putting a ton of time and attention into because there are other platforms

[06:28] that are making me way more pre-inative time, money and effort in putting it. And one more thing that

[06:33] my team just told me about TikTok real quick is that the average session length of someone going

[06:38] from TikTok to acquisition.com, my website is eight seconds. Now you'll see some of the ones later

[06:45] are way higher. So the next platform is the tubes, which if you're watching this on YouTube,

[06:50] then this is for you. So we're going to cover the same metrics just before and we're going to start

[06:54] with hope. What percentage of families over 100k are here? So if I says 89%. So take that in consideration

[07:03] versus TikTok, which was much much lower than that. All right. People who have money are on YouTube.

[07:09] The next thing is what percentage of the United States is on here? 83%. All right. So you've got a huge

[07:15] percentage of the people who are making the most money on the platform. And so growth for this platform

[07:22] really comes down to how discoverable is your content on the platform. And to give you context for me at least,

[07:28] 80% of my traffic comes from the suggested or browse features, meaning, you know,

[07:33] more than three quarters of the people that come and watch my stuff. Maybe you right now.

[07:37] Actually, we're coming because you were a subscriber, but because the algorithm said you might like this

[07:42] video. And so for me, I read this as high. Now the next question is, okay, so we've got the right

[07:48] people. We can grow on this platform. These are all pluses. So the next thing is, well, how much time

[07:53] are these people actually spending with you? So you can really provide value. Well, for us, our average

[07:59] iteration per video across all channels is over eight and a half minutes. All right. So it's eight and a

[08:05] half minutes. Now compare that to the five to 20 seconds that we're getting on TikTok. I mean,

[08:10] we're talking 20 times. I did do the math, but it's a lot. A lot more time is spent here versus others.

[08:17] And so this allows you to develop a more realistic, a deeper, real-er relationship with your audience,

[08:23] because you can actually give them value that they can do stuff with. If we want to do a quick

[08:27] app, it's the TikTok. Obviously YouTube has YouTube shorts. So let me tell you something interesting

[08:31] about this. The average YouTube short that we have has a 33 second average view duration.

[08:38] Remember, five to 20 on TikTok? We're more than twice that over here on YouTube. Now, how does this

[08:45] actually translate to what we care about, which is conversion? When we talk about the convertibility of

[08:49] YouTube, it's actually one of the lower ones, but there's a massive caveat here, which is that you can't

[08:54] DM you, if you're a subscriber, there's no real story that I can post and immediately see it.

[09:00] The closest thing is the community tab that you can do, which by the way, murder. So if you do have a

[09:05] YouTube channel, highly recommend doing CTAs on the community tab sporadically when it makes sense.

[09:11] And so for here, I would rate this low to medium. The community tab kind of brings it up a little bit,

[09:17] but by and large, it's very hard for people to immediately convert. They basically have to click a link

[09:22] somewhere else. And if you put it in the video, it does kill your futureation. So it's like if you're

[09:27] going to say something, you just got to make it short, make sure that it's not too big of an ask

[09:31] from the audience. And then you could put links in the description, which by the way, if you look at

[09:36] our description, you could just look, you want to put it above the fold. So you want to have to be

[09:39] the first thing that somebody sees before they even click C more is where you want to drive them.

[09:44] You can also pro tip, put the first comment that you have in the comment section, just pin that

[09:49] comment. So that gives you two different places. And third inside the video where you can drive

[09:53] traffic, this is just something that I've learned over time. But still, that's a lot of effort.

[09:56] And it's not like, hey, respond to my Instagram story for shadowing. And we can take, we can start a

[10:02] conversation immediately on the platform. And to give context on this little community post thing I was

[10:06] saying, my community posts over the last 30 days had two and a half million impressions. And to get

[10:11] put that in context, my short videos got about 18 million impressions. So it's not, it's not nothing.

[10:17] It is, it is really, totally significant, especially when you can load it with some sort of

[10:21] call to action in there. But no matter what, you pretty much have to take people off the platform

[10:26] in order to convert to them and potentially convert them. Now, let's talk about results. Because all

[10:31] of this stuff is conjecture, let's get to the brass tax, which is here's the crazy thing,

[10:36] drum roll 28.6% of our traffic comes from YouTube. All right. So a massive amount. But there's

[10:46] another caveat that I want to put on top of this. Our YouTube traffic converts at three to four

[10:51] times every other platform. So when people, these clicks that go here are worth a ton. And so the

[10:58] actual percentage of the context that we create, people who want to become poor for the company,

[11:04] but it's business owners that want to scale and go to acquisition.com, almost 60% of those contacts

[11:10] actually come from YouTube originally. And remember that little eight second average that tick

[11:15] talk gave us in terms of how long people even spend on the page. One, I guess what it is for YouTube,

[11:20] it's 91 seconds. It's a minute and a half. So we're talking 10 to X, the amount of time that people

[11:27] actually spending on page. All right. So you're taking somebody who has high intention that you've

[11:33] delivered value to, they actually remember your name. And you can actually start a meaningful

[11:37] conversation to help them in a more deep way via commerce, selling stuff, whatever. So one of the

[11:43] things that actually got me on YouTube originally. One of the last pieces of content that I

[11:46] consumed before I was like, you know what, I'm going to start creating was I heard this guy who had a

[11:51] 20 something question application. And he was on a podcast and he said, I get about 3,000 applications

[11:57] a month. And I looked at his YouTube channel and he had like 300,000 subscribers. And I was like,

[12:01] holy cow, because at this point all I had done was paid at. And so I was like 3,000 inbound

[12:08] warm applications. I was like, my god, if I had that kind of volume, I'd be able to do so much with

[12:13] that. And so when I saw the 300,000 and I saw that that translate into 3,000 applications a month,

[12:17] I was like, there's something here that I'm going to try and figure it out. And so if you are getting

[12:20] started, listen, I have a massive team, but it didn't start that way. So I had one guy who I stayed

[12:25] committed to posting three videos a week. And if you look at the very earliest videos on my channel,

[12:29] it's me with a webcam at my desk, just talking about business stuff as it came up throughout the

[12:34] day. And so I would encourage you to just start and then all you have to do is every month,

[12:41] wherever you week, look back at the three videos you made the week before and just try and improve

[12:45] one thing. And if you just stick that, what happens is you create this checklist over time to

[12:49] becomes this Mando checklist of what ultimately creates an exceptional video that performs.

[12:54] I remember when I got so excited and we had my first thousand view video in 24 hours. And I was like,

[13:00] do, can you believe? Like, there's going to be a time where you get 10,000 views in a day. And now we

[13:04] do 100,000 views in our first day. And so the levels just keep going and going and going as you grow

[13:10] in skill. And if you're going to obsess about something, these are the two things out of obsess on.

[13:14] Number one is the thumbnail. What are my last two videos was no BS advice on how to get rich in 10 years?

[13:21] And we split tests nine different thumbnails. And so thing one is the thumbnail matters a lot.

[13:27] Thing two is the first eight seconds of your video. You want to be done talking about what the

[13:33] video is going to be about and start. And this is something that when I see a beginner video,

[13:38] I watch and it's like two minutes before they actually start the video. You've already lost everyone.

[13:42] And so you're going to lose most people in the first 30 seconds. And so you want to crush

[13:46] the intro. So they know exactly what you promised in the thumb ahead line. And then you get to the

[13:52] meat as fast as possible. And this video right here, we did eight different takes of the intro,

[13:58] where I slowly worked from 30 seconds down to eight. And then that's what became the

[14:02] intro that you saw before seeing this moment right now. With all that being said, the YouTube

[14:07] gets the highest praise in the internet ecosystem, Jesus. And gets the S tier ranking,

[14:16] because this is where I'm doubling down and continuing to pour more and more resources,

[14:20] resources, because this is where I'm getting the best returns. Next up, we have the artist

[14:25] formally known as Twitter, currently known as the X factor. First up, we've got who's on this platform.

[14:32] So X has 29% of people over a hundred thousand dollars in household income are on X. So about the

[14:39] same as TikTok actually a little bit higher. The next question is how many of these people, right?

[14:44] What percentage of the population in the United States is on X? And so here, this is where it's a

[14:50] little bit lower. So TikTok's got them. They're at 33 versus 22 on X. Now let's talk about growth.

[14:56] Growth for X is one of the most viral platforms because the share button is the easiest button

[15:02] on X in Twitter. And this is fundamentally what allowed people to organically grow on Twitter to

[15:06] begin with. But it is a platform that you have to be really, really good at words and it takes

[15:11] a very long time to do that. But the advantage is that you can actually tweet a sentence or a word,

[15:16] or an image, or a meme. And so there's a lot of things that are native to the platform and

[15:21] Elon continues to put more and more stuff on there to make it more and more viral and just continue

[15:25] to improve it overall. And after being stagnant for years, Twitter is actually back on a growth curve

[15:30] now. But here's the interesting tip for X users. It's a little bit more of a silo, but the people

[15:34] were on X tend to be really hardcore. And so the average X user spends 34 minutes per day on the platform,

[15:41] which is about half of some of the other platforms, but still not bad at all, comparatively. The next

[15:46] one's real quick. Depth, we don't have stats because there's no real average view duration for Twitter.

[15:53] But the easiest thing that I look at for this is how many comments, how engaged people are,

[15:58] I don't have particular stats on it. But with that being said, let's move on to conversion,

[16:02] which is what matters. Now, Twitter is interesting. There's lots of people that have 1,000

[16:06] person followers, 8,000 person following and make multiple millions of dollars a year on Twitter,

[16:12] because they're super niche down in terms of the types of topics they talk about. In fact,

[16:16] there was a business that came here the other day, who is in a CRO marketing agency that specialized

[16:21] in e-commerce companies doing over $10 million a year. So talking about like a niche of a niche of a niche,

[16:27] and he was doing $5 million a year from his 8,000 person Twitter following. And all he did was have

[16:33] in-depth threads where he would just say, here's a split test that one, here's another split test that

[16:38] one, and the entire thing of his bio was, if you want to call, click my calendar link and book

[16:44] a call. And he told me that he was getting 8 to 12 calls a day with unbelievably qualified prospects.

[16:49] And so one, you have to go off platform, but you have this link that's right there and immediately

[16:55] the second thing on Twitter is you can DM. And so many people DM on Twitter all the time.

[16:59] And so people who are on that platform are very accustomed to it. And the amount of access that you get

[17:04] on Twitter slash X is kind of unbelievable. Like you've got superstars on there who will reply to

[17:09] DMs. It's not. First thing you don't want to do if you're just DMing people on Twitter is just

[17:13] DM them with an ask. The amount of people that have, like, hey, can we hop on a call? No. No,

[17:19] we can't. Thanks for the ask though. I think compliments are a great way to start like, hey,

[17:24] I love this thread. Don't just say, hey, I love your stuff, point to a specific thread that you

[17:28] liked and then explain why. And if someone says, thank you, then you can respond afterwards. If someone

[17:34] doesn't say, thank you to a compliment, then they're probably not going to engage anyways. And so I

[17:37] would just start with some like, what is valuable to somebody is just telling them that they did a good job.

[17:41] So I rate this a high on the convertibility of the audience. Now, what is that actually translate into

[17:48] us for results? So before I give you the stats on this, I want to give you a little bit of context.

[17:52] The reason I like X so much is that X is actually my hub for content. So what I mean is, I consume X

[17:59] more than any other platform personally. And I on the fly create on X. So 100% of the tweet that

[18:07] are on X are me in the moment, just tweeting them out. I heard something on a meeting, someone said

[18:11] something and I think about Pithy way to say it and then I shoot it out. Right. Now, the thing is

[18:16] that X January is a little bit of results and I'll explain what it is in a moment. But what it does

[18:21] do is it actually feeds all the other platforms because the captions on my Instagram are tweets from here.

[18:28] And the long form stuff that we put on LinkedIn are just multiple tweets put together and reformat it.

[18:33] And so if you ever see written word from Alex Shermozhe on any platform, they are words that I wrote.

[18:38] I have no ghost writers. I do have people who assemble the words that I have and then put them in a

[18:44] order or group them together. But that's how I've been able to scale my voice without ever being

[18:49] like, oh, that's really cringe. So your ability to repurpose all the stuff you put on X is super high.

[18:54] Our percentage of traffic that we get to our site is 6.12%. And if you look at how many people I

[19:00] have on Twitter, it's about 6% of my total subscribers. And so it's about 1 to 1 in terms of

[19:05] ratio. Like it's pulling its weight in terms of conversion. Even though this is a short form platform,

[19:13] compared to TikTok, the average session duration on my site from someone from X is still 4 times higher

[19:20] than TikTok. So it's over 30 something seconds is what people do from X on my site. And for that

[19:27] reason, I give X an A rating for me. Because the main thing is is I'm not going to stop going on X.

[19:34] We don't really have a lot of team dedicated to X. It's pretty much just me and my team takes

[19:39] what I put there and then sprays it everywhere else. And so this is for me incredibly valuable.

[19:45] You all thought I was going to put it on S. I know. But no, this isn't A tier for me. I mean,

[19:48] if I had to pick YouTube or X, I would do YouTube. But X is the wellspring of everything else that I

[19:54] make. Which leads us to the in of linked the LinkedIn magic, the professional network where all

[20:00] people are serious, but no one really is. And let's break down how much money this platform

[20:06] actually makes. And I think it will, it will surprise you. And I have changed my view on linkedin.

[20:12] Who's on linkedin? Now this one may surprise you. 53% of households over $100,000 are on linkedin.

[20:19] So this is double TikTok. Like we talked about earlier. Now the next question is how many people

[20:25] in the United States are on linkedin? And this one was kind of surprising me. It was 30%. So I

[20:30] actually thought it was a way lower than that because I figured no one uses linkedin. But it turns out

[20:35] a lot of people use linkedin just not as much as you think in terms of per day. And so the average

[20:39] amount of time spent on linkedin per day, linkedin users is about seven minutes. So way lower than a lot

[20:45] of the other platforms. So let's talk about growth. So growth for me and growth for you should probably

[20:50] be incredibly important because if the point of advertising is to let people know about your stuff,

[20:54] you want platforms that let way more people than already know about you know about your stuff.

[20:58] And so I give linkedin a medium to high and I'll explain why. So linkedin is super shareable and

[21:06] very connection driven. And so the part that I would say is high about it is that there's a lot of

[21:10] people who share on linkedin. It's very common to share stuff. It's kind of like a sharing culture.

[21:15] And when you create high value stuff, people want the association with that value and then they

[21:19] share public because it makes them look like they've got you know, their thought leaders. Now

[21:24] the flip side is the reason that I I still have this medium anchor is that because it's connection

[21:30] driven. So think about it like a hinge. So if you have 10 people, a lot of your posts will get

[21:36] shown to people who are friends with your connections. Right? So it's like so and so is friends with

[21:40] so and so who made this post. Right? And so in the beginning, it can be harder for you to get

[21:46] started because you might have only a few connections. And so let me give you a tip on this.

[21:51] Right now, wherever you went to high school, wherever you went to college,

[21:55] if you went to college, wherever you work, all of these places are very customary to have

[22:00] linkedin profiles. And by the way, I would strongly encourage you to at least put one up there

[22:04] that looks like you exist because from a professional setting, I'll tell you some of the big

[22:08] benefits that I get that are not on this list that have been worth it for me. But you can get your

[22:13] first 500 connections. And the nice thing with linkedin is they just say 500 plus. So it's not like

[22:18] you have to think like, oh my god, I need millions and millions of people. Like you max out your

[22:21] personal connections at 500. So it's very you could do that with a high school class. Like it's not

[22:25] hard to get going. So let's talk about depth real quick because there's no average

[22:28] view duration. We have no real stats on that. So let's get on to the drum roll of conversion.

[22:32] Now linkedin, so think about, think about like, you know, TikTok is like a bomb or like a sprinkler,

[22:39] right? Linkedin is like you've got a hose with a laser pointer on it and you can shoot whoever you

[22:45] want with it. All right. And so the conversion ability on linkedin is extremely high. All right.

[22:51] And I'm going to talk about this in a couple, a couple, a couple of different vectors. So number one is

[22:54] it's very high because there's a ton of sophisticated tools. Linkedin is built for outbound,

[23:00] meaning you can get incredibly targeted with your search ability criteria for prospects. And so if you

[23:07] want to find hedge fund managers who are in this state and above this age, you can do that. And so

[23:13] linkedin has something called sales navigator that you can use 40% of B2B marketers say that this is

[23:18] their primary channel for getting customers. So like do not sleep on the ability. Now mind you.

[23:23] Linkedin adds shaky. Some people make a work. Uh, linkedin content overall. What help you

[23:29] convert when you do GMs. But this is an outbound monster. All right. And relative to the following

[23:35] count that you have on linkedin, your ability to make money is probably the highest. So you can

[23:39] have the tiniest following and make the most money on linkedin because of how targeted you can

[23:44] be with your outreach and how easy it is to message someone who engages with your content. And before

[23:49] I move on to results, I want to give you a little hack here for the growth. One of the biggest

[23:53] growth methods right now on linkedin is getting large accounts to comment on your stuff. And so if a

[24:00] large account comments on your thing, it gets shown to all of their following. And so it's a massive

[24:06] leverage point. Like think about a comment on what's as a collab. And so you want to do whatever you

[24:10] can to attract those bigger accounts. And I'll tell you an easy hack for this. Right about them.

[24:17] Talk about how great this person is or how great a particular piece of content they made is.

[24:22] Like actually write something significant. And you have a high likelihood that they will say like

[24:27] hey, thanks for this was awesome. And the longer their responses, the more engagement draws to it.

[24:32] Like there was a guy that made a comment, made a post the other day. And I commented on it. And he

[24:39] had a small-ish following. And that post got like 50 times his average in terms of likes and

[24:46] comments after that because I have a large following on linkedin. And so he got to leverage basically

[24:50] entirety of my audience by just making a piece of content that I found relevant. So drumroll for

[24:55] the results and this will surprise you. Over a 9% plus of my traffic to my site comes from linkedin.

[25:03] And the average session duration of these people is over 40 seconds. All right. So it's higher than

[25:08] every other platform, a size YouTube. All right. So really strong intent from these people. Now let me

[25:16] give you the thousand IQ move that is the reason that I like linkedin a lot. So for me, we have a

[25:21] portfolio of companies that act with a genocom right now. It's just under 10 companies that do

[25:25] over $250 million a year in revenue. And so we constantly are recruiting high-level talent

[25:31] for a portfolio company and for a holding company to acquisition. And so the biggest unspoken ROI that I

[25:38] get from linkedin and that layle gets from linkedin is that our DMs are about recruiting. So we can go

[25:43] directly head hunt some of the best people in the world. And because we have following because they

[25:49] can look at the stuff we put out there, the response there is that we get. I heard that any other

[25:53] platform for talent. And so if you want to get really amazing people, linkedin is going to be the

[25:58] big lever that you can use to grow your business by just getting the smartest people on your team.

[26:04] So with all that being said, we've got a lot of people with money. We've got decent growth. We've got

[26:09] high conversion ability, high intent and just to give you context on this 9% it's about twice its weight

[26:15] based on the percentage of followers that I have on linkedin. So we get way more per follower than

[26:21] like TikTok where I get one fourth the amount of followers that actually translate into results. So

[26:27] where does linkedin go? Survey says boom, beats here. And main reason here is that I don't think that

[26:35] it can generate as much, at least for me. But it is like I would put it like almost between the two.

[26:40] But in terms of where I'm putting my actual resources, we use a lot of my ex content on linkedin

[26:46] and it's worked exceptionally well. And so we're probably like it's going to continuously continuing

[26:51] to invest the same amount that I have been investing in linkedin. Next up we've got the Graham,

[26:55] the myth, the legend, Instagram itself, champion of children, father to the fatherless and

[27:04] money maker to people who shake their booties. So that being said, I'm a B to B guy, I serve as

[27:09] business owner. So how does Instagram measure up for me? Again, the results may surprise you like they

[27:14] did for me. So number one, 1% of people over 100k are on here, 54%. All right. So really monster percentage,

[27:22] the second highest that we've had so far across all platforms, only second to YouTube. Next,

[27:28] how many people in the United States are on Zigram, which is 47%. Again, the second highest that we've

[27:36] come to so far. So pretty promising up top. Now let's talk about growth. Growth because of the

[27:41] advent of reels right now is high. All right. You can if you were formatting your stuff correctly,

[27:48] get viral growth and they're putting more and more to try and favor new creators. If you look at

[27:52] a guy named Mosseri, he's the head of Instagram. I recommend following him, no association. He just has

[27:58] a lot of stuff like from the horses mouth of what they're doing in the algorithm, what they want to

[28:03] favor and I'll tell you, fun fact that he shared with me personally, not really, on his Instagram.

[28:08] Is that a lot of people think that Instagram's favoring video and he said, no, people favor video.

[28:15] And so that's what gets shared the most. It's not that we did anything to the algorithm. He's just

[28:19] people just prefer to engage in videos and the big thing that they care about is shares. They want to see

[28:25] how many people take your video and then immediately send it to friends. And especially if you send

[28:30] it off platforms, if you copy the link and then text it, that's who gets more people to Instagram.

[28:34] That's the holy grail of what they want for the bad news. So the depth on Instagram is lower.

[28:40] Now it's not as low as TikTok, but for us it's 12 to 20%. Sorry, 12 to 20 seconds. Now I'm going to give

[28:47] you a little bit of context on this number. So I personally tend to do a lot of tweet reels.

[28:52] And my tweet reels are like three seconds or five seconds long. So no one can even watch longer than that.

[28:58] And so that skews my data lower. And so if we had the, if we wanted to take the time to

[29:03] like look at every single video that's not a tweet reeling and parse the data out,

[29:06] we could probably figure it out. But I'll bet you that it's significantly higher than this

[29:10] based on some of these down funnel metrics. So people see the tweet reels. They share them.

[29:14] That's how some of my growth comes. But a lot of the depth for me comes from alternating between

[29:19] these kind of higher top of funnel, if you will tweet based videos versus the kind of in-depth

[29:27] me talk to a business owner, me at a Q&A or whatever. This is something that we learned the

[29:31] hard way. So Instagram is unlike TikTok in terms of the fact that they penalize you for posting too much.

[29:38] And so we've tried, you know, eight a day, six a day, four a day. And so we found our sweet spot at

[29:44] two sessions per day. So one in the morning, one in the evening, and we kind of spread them out.

[29:49] Now TikTok, for example, we post way more frequently. And as you see, I'm going to be

[29:53] divesting some of my attention there. But you don't get penalized. Same as X, you don't get

[29:59] penalized for tweeting more. You don't get penalized for posting more TikToks at the moment.

[30:04] And so for us, we really spend more time creating the one to two things that we put out per day on

[30:10] here because they're the only shots we've got. So let's talk about your ability to convert your

[30:15] audience on Instagram. So this one, I would say, honestly, he's probably only second to LinkedIn

[30:21] in terms of your convertibility. LinkedIn has other things that make it worse than Instagram,

[30:25] some of the other stats I shared. But in terms of your ability to convert on Instagram, it's so good.

[30:30] So the only thing you can't do is get laser targeted the way you can with sales and navigate or

[30:33] whoa. But what you can do is you've got stories where you can do CTAs. You can do swipe ups,

[30:39] people can click links. You can link it with tools like many chat where if someone DMs you a

[30:44] certain word or comments a certain word, it begins the conversation with them. And so you can do

[30:49] all of your commerce directly on Instagram. They also have Instagram shop. Like they have really

[30:54] and they're continuing to invest in this to make this such a high converting platform. And the

[30:58] story that it's all the very beginning, a guy who had 800,000 on TikTok and 200,000 on Instagram

[31:02] was getting 90% of his revenue from Instagram. I was like, I need to make a video on this because

[31:07] I need to look at our data to see if we need to reallocate our own resources to make the most money.

[31:12] And so here's a really important point with conversion. A lot of people chase views. And so like if

[31:18] you go up to strangers on the street and slap them and run away, you're going to get a ton of

[31:21] views because it's crazy viral stuff. But you're not going to get the right types of views from the

[31:26] right who unless you sell how to sell, you know, how to slap strangers in public and not get hit back.

[31:31] Right. But unless that's what you sell, that's probably not going to be relevant content for you.

[31:35] And so if you're an educator, you're a business owner, which most of us are educators, not entertainers,

[31:41] then what you're going to want to make sure that you're making content is about the stuff you sell

[31:45] and about the problems that your avatar or ideal avatar suffers from and how you can help solve them.

[31:51] All right. And so there's a there's a nutritional diet tissue who I met had 5800 followers on

[31:58] Instagram. She's at a million dollars a year and with a couple of tweaks that I walked through with her.

[32:02] I think she'll do three to five million just from 5800 followers. And her content, here's the

[32:08] Grazebart. The highest piece of content that I could find when I scrolled had 19 likes.

[32:13] But she was making 10 sales a day on average for her $39 to $99 thing. And then she would manually email

[32:21] every person who bought the thing and say, hey, one of my more expensive thing. And she was doing almost

[32:25] 100,000 dollars a month just from that simple system. And you know what her really niche was?

[32:31] She talked about how to build insurance companies more profitably. All of her content was like, hey,

[32:36] here's a etna and how you can build them way more than you currently are as a registered

[32:41] dietitian. So like a niche of a niche of a niche. And me personally, I look at a lot of gym equipment.

[32:47] It's something that I'm really interested. I'm a hobbyist if you want to call it that. And so a lot of

[32:51] metal fabricators, you might be surprised are very terrible marketers. And so a lot of them have like

[32:56] 5 likes 20 likes on their posts. But guess who season me because that's what Instagram knows. I love it.

[33:02] They put a new machine that I haven't seen. I'm clicking on it. And so I would encourage you.

[33:08] Don't worry about the likes. We're about who the likes are coming from. And one of the cool things

[33:14] with Instagram because of all the different ways you can convert on there is that you can always be

[33:19] seen as giving and you can convert in private. And so you don't even need to make asks publicly.

[33:24] If you just say, hey, DM me this or hey, I want to send you this thing, then you can start the

[33:28] conversation and you can do the commerce on the conversation rather than in public. So give them

[33:32] public, sell and private. And this enables you to do both. And this may be the stat that blows your mind

[33:38] the most. The amount of traffic that goes to my site from Instagram is 48%. 48% of my acquisition

[33:48] dot com traffic comes from Instagram. Now, I'll give you a little caveat here because it'll be

[33:55] important. Is that by absolute amounts, Instagram sends more traffic to acquisition dot com

[34:01] than YouTube does. You're like, huh, well, that's interesting. Now, in terms of session length,

[34:07] remember this was 91, this one is 28 seconds in session length. So it is shorter. Now, mind you,

[34:13] a lot of the content here, shorter. So it kind of makes sense that people would follow their

[34:16] same kind of consumption pattern when they click over. And so here's the the down fact about Instagram

[34:22] from this is that when they go to my site, people on Instagram convert significantly less than the

[34:28] people on YouTube. But they convert about the same as the other platforms. TLDR tons of traffic

[34:34] coming from Instagram conversion about the same. And for that reason, I rank the gram in. Let's see if

[34:42] I don't tear this damn page off. There we go. I rank this as an S tier. Is it as an S tier? Is

[34:50] out the Gen Z kids say these days? It is an S tier. It's the top guy. It's very good. I put both of

[34:55] these as my two top dogs that we're investing the same or more resources going into the next year.

[35:01] Next up, we have the book of faces. The man, the myth himself, smash book original. This one is actually

[35:08] one that I've changed my mind on. And so before I dive into these stats on Facebook, I had to restart my

[35:16] account because and I'll tell you what I made as a mistake. So years and years ago, I was a new

[35:20] entrepreneur and someone told me, just go run ads in Thailand because you get clicks for like a penny

[35:27] and you can get followers for like 10 cents a piece. And so I ran ads to get my Facebook following

[35:32] to 70,000 so I looked legit. Now here's the problem with that. Is that Facebook then serves

[35:39] content that I have. This is back in the day. Two people who are the people who liked my page

[35:44] unsurprisingly. And it turns out people who don't speak English and are just randomly selected

[35:49] from Thailand are not that interested in business content. And so it basically prevented me from

[35:54] growing my account when I actually wanted to go legit and make my book content. This is years and

[35:59] years later, but I still have my original profile. And so we had to restart my Facebook profile just

[36:04] in this last year. And so for those of you who were like, man, he's got all these files. I started

[36:09] at zero this year. All right. So and like we were like, hey, we got a thousand views on a video and

[36:13] we started a little over again. So like, don't be afraid of that. It's just part of the game.

[36:17] Everyone starts at zero. So let's rock the stats real quick. So of people over 100k, how many

[36:22] them on here? 68%. All right. So second, only two, Zitu. How many of people in America now? This is a

[36:29] wild one. It's also 68% of America is on Facebook. Now known as meta. I thought both are meta. I'm

[36:36] confused. You get the idea. Now let's talk about growth. All right. Because this is where it matters.

[36:41] All right. God, we got a bunch of the people that we want on there. A lot of the United States

[36:44] is on there because it's an older platform. How about growth? Now, because now there was a moment

[36:49] for a few years where Facebook was very tough to grow. So it was like organic on Facebook crushed

[36:54] and then all of a sudden it stopped crushing and they were like, you have to use our ads platform.

[36:57] If you want to get it and if you use, and basically Facebook, organic like died. And then they

[37:02] resurrected it again when Reels came out and they started making Reels for Facebook. And so now

[37:07] growth on Facebook, I would say, is high again. All right. If you make stuff that's platform specific,

[37:13] again, I've noticed we have noticed that stuff that performs really well on Instagram doesn't

[37:18] necessarily perform on Facebook. And stuff shorts on TikTok don't necessarily perform on here. So each

[37:22] platform is getting more and more separated in terms of what performs well. So with this one,

[37:28] we weren't able to pull our average view per, but I would say that it's high because the average

[37:34] session length for us is 53 seconds on our site from people who come from Facebook, which means

[37:41] that of all the ones that I'm going to spoil this one for you. Of all the platforms, it is the second

[37:46] highest session length on our site, which has a higher translation over to contacts and downstream

[37:53] things like money. All right. Now, let's talk conversion. So the convertibility on Facebook, I would say,

[37:59] is high, not as high as Instagram, but high because a lot of the same features have been carried over.

[38:04] One is you've got Facebook stories and people can respond to your stories. You can DM on Facebook.

[38:09] It links with tools like many chat where you can do automation on Facebook. And so you have a

[38:14] lot of different ways that you can convert people and it's a platform where many, many, many, many,

[38:19] many people have profiles and get notifications when they get messages. So we will rate this as,

[38:24] let me say, a high medium to high, like super high medium, extra medium, a medium, if you

[38:31] well. And so let's talk about results because this is what matters most to everybody here. Right.

[38:35] And so this one is also fast sitting. So 3.8% of our traffic comes from Facebook. Now, I only have

[38:43] like 150,000 followers on Facebook. So for me, that's the smallest of all the accounts I'm going to

[38:48] talk about today. But this is more than TikTok, which has almost 900,000. So my 150,000

[38:54] followers on Facebook generate more than almost double the amount that my TikTok does with one sixth

[39:03] the amount of people who are actually following. So you look at the relative difference. It's

[39:07] one and a half times more conversion on one sixth. So it's nine X the potency. So you catch an

[39:13] on with this here, you're like, wait a second. You spent all this time here. And in just a few

[39:17] months here, you were able to get way more people to your site to ultimately convert later. Yeah.

[39:23] And so if you're like, should I start a TikTok or should I make more content on Facebook?

[39:28] Well, I'll let you use your second brain cell and figure that out for yourself. And so one of the

[39:32] cool parts about Facebook is it's kind of like a hybrid between LinkedIn and Instagram.

[39:37] Because you can do long-form text posts and like very long thread based stuff. You can do pictures

[39:42] and you can do video on there. And so it's a platform that's been really adaptable in terms of the

[39:46] amount of different types of content that you can create. And I see that as a big plus. Because Facebook

[39:51] is almost like the whatever you want to make, they'll support you and making it with the

[39:55] exception of maybe audio. And with that being said, I have now moved Facebook in my life. So

[40:02] before this, it was below F tier. We weren't even making content on Facebook at all. But when we

[40:07] started looking at these stats, I was like, oh, this is, oh, this is, oh, oh, oh, yeah, this is actually

[40:17] an A tier for me. And that may be surprising for you. But this is where I'm putting more of my

[40:22] resources in the next year because of all the things that I said. And to be clear, before I made this

[40:27] video, I, it was lower. But when we looked at all the data, this is how I'm prioritizing my

[40:33] resources. And so if you're like, man, which one should I should create on this should inform you?

[40:38] Also, if you want the the metal lesson here, look at your data. So I just do with the data

[40:43] tells me to do, which is, oh, we get, we have high growth here, we have high conversion, we have

[40:47] lots of people who have the money, who are on this platform. It's the one of the oldest platforms.

[40:52] They now have more discoverability. And so yeah, I'm putting more time into it. And before I get into

[40:57] our double feature for this next one, I'm going to do some honorable mentions at the end that I am

[41:04] putting some resources towards that I didn't want to put on this list. That I think will be very

[41:08] valuable for you to least understand, but more realistically make money from. So our double feature

[41:14] of the day, we've got zip podcast, which is a Spotify thing, but it's still a podcast because

[41:20] you know that Spotify is podcast. I know crazy. And email, you know like, wait a second, are these

[41:25] social platforms? Yes and no, and that's why I'm going to talk about the same time because I actually

[41:28] think that these two platforms are more similar than they are different. And so the big reason is all

[41:34] of this stuff is kind of your growth mechanisms. And I'm already doing a little foreshadowing on

[41:38] our growth one here. But like your email list, for example, is not going to just like sprout

[41:44] babies and have more emails that get made. Right? If you've read a banger email, you're probably

[41:48] not going to really grow the list. But if you have a banger piece of content in these platforms,

[41:52] you might absolutely grow your following, which then goes to your site, which then into your list.

[41:58] And so the same happens with podcasts, right? Podcasts and email are both what I would consider

[42:02] long-term nurture. You're basically putting your audience into a bucket so that you can consistently

[42:08] add value to them. Now, here's the interesting thing with both these. This is considered owned

[42:13] media, meaning you can directly email anybody who gives you their email address. Obviously,

[42:18] people have CRMs and things like that. So you can blast email, but you're still guaranteed to

[42:22] reach the email that they gave you. Spotify and Apple podcasts and whatnot. People only listen to

[42:29] this. This is so important. People usually only listen to three to five podcasts. And so think about

[42:36] your Instagram, for example. If you look at the number of people you follow, you might follow

[42:39] 500, my follow-thats, my follow-thats, my follow-thats, 3,000 people on your Instagram. And so all

[42:43] 3000 of those accounts are competing for your scroll every time you log in. But if you get on someone's

[42:49] listener, follow-orship, earballs, you are only competing against three or four other people.

[42:58] And so as long as you continue to consistently deliver, you will basically be able to keep that

[43:02] person over the long call. Now, let's talk about some stats and then we'll get into the money. On the

[43:06] people who got money, we've got 54% now the stat that we found here with 75. We can find the

[43:12] stat for 100k. That's all right. 54% of people over 75k, listen to podcasts, and 96% now this

[43:19] might be unsurprising of people who have 100k or 100k or 100k, or on email. Now, let's look at

[43:25] America. So 92% of Americans use email. I'm like, what are the other 8% I want to be in the 8%

[43:32] there? But 64% of Americans are using podcasts or audio in some format, which is actually way higher

[43:39] than I thought this was going to be. I thought it was still like more of a, you know, kids,

[43:42] tech, whatever, but no, a lot of people listen to podcasts. I thought more people would be on radio.

[43:46] Let's talk about the one I want to wear, sad news for both of these. Your ability to grow a podcast

[43:52] is really low. It's very, very hard to grow a podcast. Same as growing an email list. Now,

[43:59] to be clear, these things paired with these things very valuable. But these things on their own,

[44:05] the vast majority of like big podcasters, what do you think they also have?

[44:10] Big ass YouTube's. So they take their podcasts, they put them on YouTube, and then they grow. Now,

[44:15] the very, very, very early days when like six people were having podcasts, there was growth on the

[44:20] platforms. But now there are so many podcasts that are out there. It's very hard. Now, podcasts relative

[44:26] to the amount of people who are on Instagram. I think it's like six million podcasts and there's

[44:30] I don't know two billion people on Instagram who are quote creators, whatever. And so you're

[44:35] still competing against a much smaller slice of creators, but the card that someone's looking at

[44:41] they only got three to five. And so there is fierce competition here. Now, emails, lots of people

[44:46] are spamming people's inboxes. And so you have to be something that people want to click on and read.

[44:52] So that brings us to the depth. Now, both of these are going to be off the charts compared to

[44:56] everything else. So the depth on podcasts, do you check this out? 20 minutes.

[45:03] Is the average for us in terms of listen duration for people in podcasts? I mean, it blows

[45:08] everything out of the water. I mean, the closest is YouTube at 8.5. Now, emails, we don't have

[45:12] a depth because I can't say like how long it's just going to read. But for us, we've about 40%

[45:17] plus open rates on our emails. And so I see that as like okay, they're engaged. They are at least

[45:22] clicking and reading the stuff that we send out, which is very sporadic because I need to work on that.

[45:27] That being said, let's talk about conversion. So we've got these two. We got lots of people with

[45:31] money, low-ability to grow, really deep, which you know what that's going to mean, is that these guys

[45:37] are plus plus, they're high in terms of your conversion. I mean, email is the conversion platform

[45:44] of conversion platforms. So I'll give you a step. If you're not making at least 30% of your revenue

[45:50] from email, you're missing out. And if you're not emailing well, and this is, this is me talking

[45:55] to myself too here. You're just losing so much money because the thing is is that the return on

[46:01] email is the highest across all platforms. All right. So the average person gets 36 to 1,

[46:07] return it. So if you have to spend money on someone writing emails for you, these are basically

[46:12] free delivery. Like the only real cost is the cost of delivering the message and whatever CRM or

[46:17] sender you have to pay for how many emails a month you need to send. And the person who's actually

[46:21] writing the email if it's not you. That's it. That's the only real cost. And you can absolutely

[46:26] write amazing copy, make crazy offers. There's the least amount of compliance that you have to

[46:31] do with like if you get your Facebook ad account shutdown or you get your Instagram, you're not

[46:35] really going to get your email taken down. Now, you could get a bad reputation with like Gmail and

[46:40] then they stop putting you in the main inbox that put you in promotions. But big picture, as

[46:45] long as you're doing things the right way, you can have exceptional results with email in terms of

[46:50] converting an audience. And with podcasts, I'll say this. I put a plus here. I'll make it a plus minus.

[46:59] The amount of people that trust the person that they listen to podcast is through the roof. All

[47:05] right. So when you make a recommendation, the percentage likely that your audience that listens

[47:10] converts is very high. But the actual difficulty of converting on podcasts is also high.

[47:16] Because most times people have to take out their phone, type in the address, or like it disrupts

[47:21] the experience. Most people are listening. They don't have their own their own their their listening to

[47:25] their car radio because they're listening to their car or their the phone's next to them or it's

[47:29] you know, they're at the gym. And so they have to stop midset and be like, okay, now I'm going to

[47:33] type in this address in the good convert or they have to remember to do it later, which they never will.

[47:37] And so that's to me a very big downside of this. But it's still in my opinion allows you to just

[47:45] get the huge amount of depth with an audience so that when you do make CTAs everywhere else,

[47:50] it increases the likely they convert. But let's talk about results. Now for podcasts, I actually

[47:56] can't give results because when people type in separately, I can't know if they came from anywhere,

[48:02] but I know that podcasts help us. Now emails is absolutely tracked and I can't tell you that

[48:09] those numbers that we said are good. Now here's where it gets wild.

[48:15] 133 seconds is the average session time of summer on email on my site. Now here's why this is

[48:22] exceptionally powerful. We already have the email. So this isn't me trying to convert them

[48:28] I already have their contact info. So this is when I'm making a call to action saying,

[48:32] hey, we just opened up a new date or two dates for a scaling workshop at our headquarters at

[48:37] acquisition.com in Vegas. If you're a business student or a million bucks a year, go there.

[48:42] So by the way, you can go there at acquisition.com and just hit the scale button. If you're a business

[48:46] owner, if you're not a business owner, don't do that. But if you're spending a minute, you know,

[48:51] two minutes plus on there. It means that you're actually like engaging with what's on the site,

[48:55] deciding to book a call with our team. All right. And so this is monstrous. And for us,

[49:01] we're working on sending more emails because honestly, I'm so particular about written word,

[49:05] which is why I've been so hesitant to send emails to begin with. You'd be surprised, right?

[49:09] They go off their likes is very particular about its words. Yeah, that's me. And so like I said

[49:14] for Facebook, there are some things that this video is changing about my behavior. And so

[49:20] definition of learning, same condition, new behavior. And so if you watch this video and then it

[49:24] changes what you do as a result of it, then you have learned. And so for me taking this data,

[49:29] I have learned things. And so let me tell you, learn prioritizing.

[49:32] Two, three. Yeah. All right. So where are these guys going? Where are these guys going? For me,

[49:39] this guy is staying in the B class. All right. I do like the depth of it. I hate the fact that it can't,

[49:45] it's really hard to grow. But I do think it long-term is good for brand and things like that.

[49:50] Email right here. I'm putting on the same level. This is eight here. The only reason

[49:56] it's not an S tier, because you can't grow. But in terms of convertibility, this is the monster of

[50:00] convertibility. It's linked in sales, navigator on-striots. It's the people that already trust you the

[50:05] most. And you can consistently continue to deliver messages to them whenever you like as long as you

[50:12] continue to provide value. So I have four honorable mentions that I'm not going to do the full

[50:16] deep dive on. But I think are important. And the last one is the one that you will not expect and has

[50:21] made a tremendous amount of money for me that if you're good, you can crush on. So the first three

[50:28] are Pinterest, Snapchat, and Twitch. Now, right now, Twitch has been favoring super-super-long

[50:35] streams, like all day long streams, like walking along with me, living, day in the life, whatever.

[50:40] And people are going nuts for it. I, it's been tough for me because I do a lot of meetings with

[50:46] a portfolio companies and we share stuff that I can't really talk about. And so like it gets stuff.

[50:50] It's actually why I haven't made many vlogs because it was so hard the end and the out and

[50:54] if I'm working for hours so I haven't done it. But if you have a life or a work style that allows

[50:59] you to do it, I think Twitch is a huge opportunity. Now, Snapchat has done an exceptional job at commerce.

[51:05] And so the average revenue per viewer on Snapchat, I think is one of the highest, if not the

[51:09] highest across all platforms. And so it's really big in millennials, but it's coming at coming back

[51:14] fast with like Gen Z, which is kind of interesting. And so that's one that I kind of have my

[51:19] eye on. I still haven't put it on my list of where I'm going to invest resources into. I want to

[51:23] keep doing what we're doing better, but it's one to keep an eye on. Now Pinterest, if you are in a business

[51:29] that has anything that's very visual, you should absolutely be on Pinterest. So I had an art dealer who

[51:36] came here and she had 90% of her business came from Pinterest and Pinterest has the highest average

[51:44] revenue per user. All right. So I think it's 120,000 plus is the average. It's wild. How many

[51:50] how much people who are on Pinterest make? And so like it tends to be female skewed and so like think

[51:56] about the arts and craft stuff, think about why and think about decoration, whom to core, those types of

[52:01] businesses. If you're in one of those, smash and highly recommend putting resources there. Because again,

[52:07] you're not going to be competing against a lot of people because far fewer creators are on there.

[52:11] All right. So what is my big secrets? Number four. Drummer will please. Well, I've actually

[52:18] been seeding you with it this whole time and know the books are not a traffic source. It's actually

[52:23] Amazon. So if we think through the same vectors we had earlier, Amazon, what percentage of people

[52:29] who are over a hundred thousand on here? All of them. 300 million Americans are on prime.

[52:34] Are on paid subscriptions. Absolutely absurd. The most successful product adoption in history

[52:40] was Amazon Prime. Next is how many? It's the whole United States. Everybody's on Amazon. So for

[52:44] you to grow on Amazon, you absolutely can. And so what a lot of people don't know is that Amazon was

[52:50] actually one of my earliest platforms. And so when I had only 10,000 followers on Instagram and I had

[52:55] maybe 10,000 followers on YouTube. I don't even think I was making YouTube's yet. I published this book.

[53:00] And so a lot of people think that this book has the 26,000 five stars that it has on Amazon because

[53:06] of the following that we have. And that's not true. This book sold more copies than I had people

[53:12] on my email list. All right. So talk about contacts versus customers. Now, Amazon has all of

[53:20] this traffic of all these people who have money. Now, are these people able to convert? Fuck yeah.

[53:26] They have a credit card on file and they can buy in one click. So Amazon is built for

[53:30] Congress. It's also why Twitch is one of the things that there's some, there's big opportunities there.

[53:35] Now, I'm going to do a little caveat here. If you are an influencer or you would like to start creating

[53:40] content, I think that Amazon is a sleeper. And so let me walk you through some math. My book page

[53:48] converts at 30%. All right. So like if you had a 30% often, you'd be like stoked, no, no, no,

[53:54] 30% of people who view my book page by a book. And to give you a relative comparison here, Shopify,

[54:03] the average is around 2%. So it has a 15, at least for me, 15 times higher conversion for me

[54:11] versus Shopify because there's so much trust innate to the platform. So if you are an

[54:17] Instagram influencer or creator, if you promote someone else's stuff, the commissions on Amazon, I'm

[54:22] pretty sure, fixed about 10%. But if you convert 10 times more people when you send them to Amazon,

[54:31] then you do when you send them to something that you get 20 or 30% on, that only converts it.

[54:36] 2% you're still going to make more money. And as an added bonus, when you promote stuff on

[54:42] Amazon, in my opinion, it doesn't feel nearly as asking. If you're like, hey, I was reading this

[54:47] really cool book. I think you like it. I've got a link here. People are like, oh, he's always selling

[54:52] a stuff. It's like, no, you're just providing value from products that you found. And so I think that

[54:56] the Amazon affiliate model is one of the most undertapped for influencers where like, I don't know

[55:02] it's a sell. It's like, dude, sell the stuff you like. So like, instead of trying to think of products

[55:06] and things like that, I think the V1 is just like, hey, these finals are awesome. If I don't

[55:10] want Amazon, and here's the link, right? And so these are not Amazon, unfortunately. But point

[55:15] being, I think this is one of the most undertapped opportunities because here's what's cool about

[55:21] this traffic source. On top of all the things I just said, if you put CTAs inside of your

[55:28] content, inside of your books, the stuff that you sell, people can go there and then find you.

[55:33] And these are people that I would never have otherwise found. All right. So they found a book

[55:38] that had a Zillion Five stars. They bought red the book and then that is how they discovered me.

[55:43] And so my growth here that I want to say is it's incredible and also very difficult

[55:50] because the only way that you can grow on Amazon is having a good product. But if you do have a

[55:55] good product, you can put in the QR codes, you can put CTAs if it's education based like me to like

[56:00] books. If you have physical products on Amazon, you can put the little QR codes in there. But this is

[56:05] another huge stream of people finding out about your stuff who otherwise wouldn't have. Now,

[56:11] results. These books, so almost a thousand books a day on Amazon, which is absurd. A lot of people

[56:19] really excited to get a thousand email contacts a day. We get a thousand customers a day from the

[56:24] books. And to be clear, this is not how I make my money. But these actually have become a much bigger

[56:29] revenue stream than I expected. Given it's just, you know, it's 30-dollar dollar book and also

[56:33] by the way, guys, you can get it for free on my podcast. Both of these are an audio format for free

[56:38] on my podcast. You can search my name. This one's a sleeper and if you are good, it's worth putting

[56:44] some of your best stuff up there. Even if you put it free somewhere else because I see it as a

[56:48] traffic source. And the more money you make Amazon, the more they push it. If you enjoy this video

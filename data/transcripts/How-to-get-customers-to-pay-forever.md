[00:00] If you understand the steps that I'm about to share with you in this video,

[00:03] you will be able to step by step create a fortune.

[00:05] If you don't know why I am, I cost $100 million in that work on us 32.

[00:09] We have a portfolio at AcreSers.com that is $200 million a year.

[00:12] We way too long to learn how fortunes are built.

[00:15] If you imagine the amount of people that you have sold in your lifetime and whatever business

[00:18] you have, whatever it is, side hustles, gigs, anything.

[00:21] And you were to instead add up all of them together and then they continue to pay you month

[00:26] over month, over month, that would ever price you sell stuff out.

[00:29] How much bigger would your business be?

[00:32] If it were mine, a lot bigger.

[00:33] My first big business was called Jim Lunch.

[00:36] Jim Lunch to date has 5,000 brick and mortar gyms that have purchased the licensing from it.

[00:41] If I had 5,000 of those gyms still paying right now, that company would be worth over $1 billion.

[00:47] That company is probably worth now at close to about $100 million.

[00:50] So I've missed out on about $900 million during my career just from that one company alone

[00:54] because it took me so long to learn what I'm about to share with you.

[00:57] The big problem that most people have when they are starting their business is that they are in the

[01:01] selling business, not in the reorder business.

[01:04] They don't have recurring revenue.

[01:07] They have one time sales.

[01:08] Can you see these merch drops and these things where people are just selling crap?

[01:12] And they get the one-time purchase and no one buys again.

[01:14] The reason they can't make money is because they have no compounding vehicle.

[01:18] What that means is that if I sell somebody today, I want to get credit for that person that I

[01:22] sold today in a year because what happens is if you don't have that, then you're always selling

[01:27] for tomorrow.

[01:27] You're always selling for the paycheck this month.

[01:29] You're always selling to pay rent rather than benefiting from a sell you made 10 years ago and

[01:33] having that person still pay you today because the thing is that you need to harness time.

[01:38] The people who understand wealth understand time.

[01:40] If time is a liability against you, it means you are thinking like a poor person.

[01:44] For the wealthy time becomes an asset because the longer you wait, the more you win.

[01:51] And so you imagine a business as a wall of glue and you're blowing people at it.

[01:55] If you never even increase the amount of people you sell, let's just say you sell one person a week.

[02:01] In 10 years, you'd have 500 customers every month who pay you.

[02:05] And if you have any price point that is reasonable, that is a lot of money.

[02:09] That is a fortune.

[02:10] And the reason people don't have that happen is because they don't get it and they're

[02:14] only thinking about the short sale for tomorrow.

[02:16] The easiest question that I like to ask when we're analyzing one of the businesses that we're

[02:20] thinking about purchasing and is there a way that we can get someone to buy this and never stop

[02:24] paying for it?

[02:25] Is there a way that we can make this so good?

[02:27] The moment their card changes or they get a new credit card, they call us ahead of time because they

[02:31] don't want to stop receiving value.

[02:33] If your phone gets changed, your phone carrier and your credit card goes out, what do you do?

[02:37] You call your phone carrier and you replace it because the value is there.

[02:39] If your credit card goes out, what do you call Netflix?

[02:42] You're going to make sure that your card goes through.

[02:44] If your utility is going out because your card doesn't go through, you fucking pay it.

[02:47] If your rent doesn't go through, you make sure that it's paid on time because these are things

[02:52] that cannot live without.

[02:53] The goal is to figure out a way to make our value so high that people don't want to stop paying.

[02:58] You want to be in the reorder, not the order business.

[03:01] There are recurring revenue businesses and reoccurring revenue.

[03:05] So this applies whether you have a subscription business or you have a one-time purchase business.

[03:09] The point is that people come back.

[03:11] Facebook is a massive company.

[03:13] They do not have a recurring revenue model.

[03:15] They have a reoccurring revenue model.

[03:18] Meaning I go to the Facebook store today, I buy some eyeballs, and tomorrow I might go back again

[03:23] and buy more eyeballs.

[03:24] I don't have a subscription, but I reorder over and over and over again.

[03:28] The question that I ask the portfolio companies that we're trying to grow them

[03:32] early on and really get the product to be exceptional is if tomorrow you could not market anything.

[03:37] You could not get any new customers whatsoever and the only thing you had were the customers you

[03:41] have today.

[03:42] And any new customer that you get could only come from referral and word of mouth of the people you

[03:47] have right now.

[03:48] How differently would you treat them?

[03:50] How different would their experience be?

[03:51] And how much better would you product be if the only way you could get new customers was them

[03:55] sending new business your way?

[03:57] When you start thinking like that, you start thinking like the wealthy, not like the poor,

[04:00] we're always in a rush for the next sale, the next paycheck.

[04:03] Because the reality is you don't get customers to make sales.

[04:07] You make sales to get customers.

[04:09] It's an important distinction.

[04:10] We only transact in order to create the relationship so that we can have revenue again and again

[04:15] again.

[04:16] You want that customer to exist like a node of revenue in your business that pumps money

[04:20] your way, month after month after month.

[04:23] So the big issues that the stuff that most people sell stocks, they're constantly focused on

[04:27] promotion, they're constantly trying to find the next customer.

[04:29] We're going to have a confronted the real issue is that you're just not that good.

[04:33] And that's okay.

[04:34] But the problem is that you're not focusing on the hard work which is getting better.

[04:37] There are three steps that you look at when you're actually trying to scale a business.

[04:40] You would have voted zero to a million, make a couple million bucks a year.

[04:43] You can just promote and sell shit all day long and never build real well.

[04:46] For me, I want to build a fortune.

[04:48] And the only way to build a fortune is to get people to never stop paying.

[04:51] If that is our goal, we only need to learn how to promote as much as we just need people

[04:56] to start trying our product.

[04:57] The point of making the first sales is to get customers.

[05:00] The point of those first customers is to give you feedback.

[05:02] And you keep getting feedback and not even caring too much about how hard you're marketing.

[05:07] Because the goal is to get the product and service better and better and better.

[05:11] And this is why most people can't scale because they start selling a little bit and say,

[05:16] oh, I should promote even more.

[05:17] But the problem is they never fix the product.

[05:19] They keep selling more and more shit and then what happens is if you sell 100 people this month,

[05:24] you have to sell 100 people next month, just to maintain.

[05:26] And then the month after that, if you bulk to 200 new sales a month, then the next month

[05:30] you have to sell 200 just to maintain.

[05:32] But if you have 10 customers a month and they never leave you in five years, you have 600

[05:37] customers a month that are paying you only with 10 new customers a month.

[05:42] When you get customers who do not leave you, you can afford any marketing.

[05:45] You can afford to outspend everyone.

[05:47] There's a company that we're about to make a huge investment in.

[05:50] And right now, their lifetime value per customer compared to their competition is 10X.

[05:56] And their cost to a car customer is the same as their competition.

[06:01] Who's going to win in a bidding auction for who can buy the next customer on Facebook or

[06:05] YouTube or pay for the eyeballs between them and their competitors, but wait every time.

[06:09] Because when you get that right, everything else is easy.

[06:12] Step one is you promote just to get people to become customers.

[06:15] Promote it so that you get the first seed, which is consumption.

[06:18] The second piece is that actual improvement loop.

[06:21] What happens is when their business gets hard when they hit a plateau, when people can't

[06:26] grow anymore, they do one of two things.

[06:28] They start marketing more, which is crazy.

[06:31] Because it means more people find out about the stuff that you sell that sucks.

[06:34] Or they create another product.

[06:35] If people don't consume your product, people don't consume your service.

[06:38] It's not that they're numb nuts.

[06:39] It means that you suck.

[06:41] Means you have created such a difficult experience for someone to interact with.

[06:44] You made it so difficult for someone to onboard that they never even experienced the benefit.

[06:48] The amount of people that I hear, especially in the internet space, were like, oh, these

[06:52] people don't work hard.

[06:53] They never follow the through.

[06:54] Does Amazon complain about all the service tickets they get?

[06:59] No, because they fix the products.

[07:01] They spend the time to keep solving problem after problem, after problem, until they're

[07:05] almost no problems left with the product.

[07:08] Taking four responsibilities and saying, you know what?

[07:10] We can make this better.

[07:11] And the way you do that is through surveying the customers to figure out what you can do better.

[07:16] Looking at their client experience, looking at the results, seeing if you can make it happen

[07:20] faster, seeing if you can make it happen easier, making sure that you've added so much

[07:24] value that there's no one else that they can compare your product to.

[07:27] Keep doing the feedback loop on those customers until you get a product where people are

[07:32] referring business to you.

[07:33] To add the cherry and sprinkle on top, you make it harder to leave.

[07:37] And if you're in a B to B situation, you want to add in collateral or controlling the

[07:41] money flow.

[07:42] If you work with Stripe, they probably process your money.

[07:44] They control the money flow.

[07:46] They don't worry about the client cards because they collect your money flow.

[07:48] You upfront.

[07:49] The person who controls the money has leverage.

[07:51] And then once you crack that, once you say, I'm only going to sell so that I make sales

[07:55] to get customers.

[07:56] The continued to improve and iterate the same product over and over and over again until

[08:00] the point where I have so many people who are coming to me because of how good it is, then

[08:04] I'll put gas on it and spend as much money as I can on the market because now I can

[08:08] outspend everyone in the same marketplace.

[08:10] I'm making 10 times a hundred times more than my competitors because when people buy for

[08:15] me, they don't want to stop.

[08:16] But most people do it in reverse.

[08:18] Or remove the new filth.

[08:19] They sell as many as they possibly can.

[08:21] Burn all the good well they have.

[08:22] And then come out with another product.

[08:23] Put a lot to hype around it, sell a bunch of them and then do it again and again.

[08:27] But they cannot build a compounding vehicle of enterprise value because if every single

[08:31] launch, if every single customer that they had sold for the last 10 years were still paying

[08:35] them today, they would have more money than no to do it.

[08:37] It's not about the price in an absolute term.

[08:40] It's all relative to the value that someone receives.

[08:42] So if someone's prices here and the value delivers here, you can make this price whatever

[08:45] you want.

[08:46] If this price is a million and they get 10 million of value, they will pay you for it.

[08:49] And this is what you pay values what you get.

[08:51] What we want is a customer surplus.

[08:53] We want an insane deal.

[08:55] We want a bargain that people do call ahead of time to make sure that they never stop getting

[08:59] built.

[09:00] The game is saying, hey, I've got a 500,000 dollar house.

[09:03] I'll sell to you for 50 grand and I learned how to build it for 10.

[09:06] But even if you provide more value up front and it's less profitable, that's okay because

[09:09] then through the iterations that you have of getting better, you get more and more efficient

[09:13] and you can drive down your cost while also increasing the value.

[09:16] And maintaining your brand and reputation.

[09:18] This lesson took me seven years to really internalize.

[09:22] Because when I looked back at my own customer list and I saw 5,000 locations on there,

[09:25] I was like, I would have a billion dollar business if I had taken more time up front to

[09:30] figure out how to never lose people.

[00:00] If you're stuck in your business, then this video will help you get unstuck.

[00:05] So this morning I was reached out to buy a business owner who's doing about one and a half million dollars a month in

[00:10] Revenue and he was like, hey man, I'm kind of stuck doing what I'm doing and I just don't know anyone who's in my space

[00:15] Who does more than two million dollars a month? He's in the online marketing space and I thought that was really interesting and

[00:20] We had a good conversation about it and so I wanted to share what we talked about and so the first thing is I completely opposed that viewpoint

[00:28] And I think this is so interesting because the reason we get stuck in our business is because we either have a belief that is incorrect

[00:33] We there's a character trait that we lack or there's a skill deficiency

[00:36] We don't know how to do what we need to do. We don't know how to be who we need to be. We don't believe what we need to believe

[00:40] Right that's what we think about the world and so whenever I'm looking at a business or business owner or myself

[00:45] And I'm stuck at a certain level. I think is this a belief that I'm lacking or that that's wrong?

[00:50] Is it a trait that I have that I need or I need to change or is there a skill right and a lot of times

[00:57] It depends on who you're talking to but you need all three and a lot of people who are just really good at character development

[01:01] Only talk about traits people really good skill development only talk about skills and people who kind of like a little bit more

[01:05] Woo, we only talk about beliefs, but you need all three right and so when I was talking to this guy is it

[01:09] You know no one's in the online space making one $2 million a month and

[01:13] I thought this was interesting because when I came into the gym space with our first company

[01:18] There was known who is making more than $3 million a year in that space and

[01:22] Those you don't know you know we hear that company to $30 million a year plus and so we ten acts with the biggest person in the space

[01:28] Was doing at the time and so a lot of that's kind of like running the form in it

[01:31] My off of the first time is like just because no one has done it doesn't mean it's not possible and so

[01:35] You know for this individual is like well break it down to physics right break it down to like tell me why you think

[01:41] That you can't get past that no one's excuse me that no one can get past $2 million a month

[01:46] Like why is there not enough customers right and he's mass market

[01:50] So of course there's enough customers like so tell me like why can you not do it right as we're talking about this

[01:56] I want you to think like think about your business right?

[01:59] I get reached out to all the time like hey, I'm doing a million you know a $2 million a year

[02:03] I'm doing $5 million a year. I'm doing $10 million a year

[02:05] I just don't think we can grow any bigger within our market now there are real market constraints

[02:10] Right so for example if you were if you were serving

[02:12] Carpractors and there's 50,000 caraparacted the United States if you had all 50,000 of them then yes, you wouldn't be able to grow

[02:19] In that space and then at that point you could grow a JSON and so then at that point your business

[02:23] Well, it's still would continue to grow and it's normal for businesses to go vertical to vertical and expand

[02:28] Horsally in that way but in if you're an a mass market business or a business that serves consumers in any anyway

[02:34] The entire marketplace is your base and so when he said that he just known anyone who's doing over $2 million a month

[02:39] That is a belief issue right?

[02:41] Well, let me give you this one to think with well if you have 10 competitors and each of them are doing $2 million a month

[02:47] That means that one of you could be better than all of you and make $20 million a year

[02:50] Say with that for a second think about it because when I when I looked at the gym space when I got into the very beginning

[02:55] I looked at all of the people were out there and I saw that all of them were doing one to $3 million a year

[03:00] And so I was like if I'm better than all of them then I should be able to do 30 million

[03:03] I should be able to add up all of their businesses and that should be what my business should be able to do

[03:08] And so if you think about like that like it is a hundred percent that way how much do people spend on

[03:13] Logistics and you know fulfillment right how much do people spend in consumer can you imagine Jeff basis like in the in the early days of Amazon

[03:20] Think you do himself like well

[03:22] Like you just can't get past $10 million a year

[03:24] Just can't get past $100 million a year like there are so many people the reason that people get limited is because of their beliefs and the reality is

[03:31] Because they don't have one of those three things and so with this individual

[03:35] I first started with the belief I said do you believe it's possible that

[03:39] You can get there because like if we don't have that then nothing can happen right and so I was like well

[03:43] Let's just add up all your competitors. Is there any reason that you couldn't just get all of their revenue?

[03:46] Right, I was like well, no, okay cool. So that one's done traits. Well, this one is like are you are you patient enough to see it out

[03:54] With which in part of that comes to the fact of like if you believe you're making a positive impact

[03:58] Right and you believe that your product or service really is benefiting the world

[04:01] Which is honestly what I think one of the biggest issues is a lot of people don't really genuinely when they look at themselves in the mirror

[04:06] And I believe that the product is good enough and so subconsciously they do not push it further than to meet their own individual needs

[04:12] Think about that for a second like if you if you if you've matched your own individual like you've you've

[04:17] Capped out your ability to spend money in and like your ability to generate money

[04:22] The only reason to make more money past that if you're self-aware individual is because you actually believe the thing that you have is going to help more people

[04:29] And so it shifts from being a self-centered focus to an other-centered focused process, right?

[04:32] And so that person may not have the traits where the like to have that like to do that, right?

[04:37] And the third is like he might not be able to grow because he likes the skills like he might not have the skills of

[04:44] Recruiting somebody to

[04:45] Open a new sales channel, right?

[04:46] He might not have the skill himself to do it or the skill to find someone because those are two different ways to think about it

[04:51] Like you can always acquire the skill, which is how do I do it?

[04:54] Or you can have the you know probably the wealthier mindset of like well who can do this, right?

[04:58] And so that you can make you can approach that but as long as you know what needs to happen

[05:01] Then you can find the who now if you are completely unaware because I get this question all the time

[05:05] Like well what at what point do I bring someone into like run my business for me?

[05:08] So I had someone asked me this yesterday

[05:10] They were making I think like 50 or 100 a month that Cameron was and I was like dude like you're just starting

[05:15] You don't even like you're just getting into the game like

[05:18] What's the you don't even like you don't need to have like is your market cap?

[05:22] Is there a reason that you like why do you want to do this, right?

[05:25] And I think it's because they didn't really believe in the thing right that they're selling because if you believe in the thing

[05:29] Then you want to you want to be the one who's driving it, you know and continue to grow it over time

[05:33] So anyways all that to say right now if you're stuck right are you perceive yourself to be stuck?

[05:37] I would break down is there an actual cap on how big my market is right and have I sold a hundred percent of my market

[05:44] I sold 30 percent of my marketplace and if you're in like the one percent of your marketplace

[05:48] Are half a percent of your marketplace or a point one percent of your marketplace?

[05:50] You haven't caped your market you just have kept your skill or your beliefs or your traits and so then I would look at

[05:58] Okay, well if all my competitors are doing this put together

[06:01] Then there's no reason I can't get all of that or half of that if I were way better than all of them, right?

[06:06] If you were better because each one of those businesses has a specific way they acquire customers a specific way for filling those customers

[06:11] Right, and so if you knew how to do each one of those things and you did it better than them

[06:15] There's no reason that you couldn't beat them, right?

[06:16] And so if you think about that then then then all of a sudden that should break the limit that you have on how much

[06:21] You can actually make within your current vehicle

[06:23] Then you get forced to look at the other two which is like is there a trait that I lack or is just skill that I lack

[06:28] In getting to where I want to go and so this was the conversation I have with him at the end of conversation

[06:31] She's like wow I guess I can get this thing to 10 million dollars a month, etc

[06:34] And I was like right and so that was the entire purpose of this video is that if you are stuck and you're thinking that you are capped

[06:41] You might be but it's not because your market oftentimes it's because of your beliefs a trait or skill that you lack and then figuring out which one it is and then attacking it is usually the way to go through it

[06:49] So when it's hoping for a value in this video keeping awesome. Hope you like my mobile studio setup

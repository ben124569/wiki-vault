[00:00] People are making podcasts and thinking in 90 days

[00:02] they're somehow going to blow up.

[00:03] In the beginning, 150 episodes is just me talking about

[00:06] how to run a gym better.

[00:08] I got a DM the other day.

[00:09] Somebody who's like, yeah, it's easy for you to build this brand

[00:11] because you already have this big audience.

[00:14] I was like, dude, just start.

[00:15] He was discouraged by the fact that he had no following

[00:18] he had no audience, et cetera.

[00:20] 99% of people were watching this.

[00:22] Do more push it and then you'll have push it to talk about

[00:24] rather than regurgizing other people's stuff.

[00:25] But for everyone who sees the overnight success, right?

[00:28] What I want you to do is go to my podcast

[00:30] and look at the timestamp in my first episode.

[00:33] It's 2017.

[00:34] Five and a half, six years ago, it just now hit the top 10.

[00:39] And in that six year period, I did not miss.

[00:42] Every week, one to three podcasts, four, six years.

[00:48] And so people are making podcasts and thinking in 90 days

[00:51] they're somehow going to blow up.

[00:52] When the reality is that you're finding your voice

[00:54] for the first year, you're figuring out what way you communicate.

[00:57] You're learning how to teach how to entertain.

[00:59] How to present.

[01:00] You're learning to speak.

[01:00] And you're also learning about the stuff

[01:02] that you're learning meantime.

[01:03] Right?

[01:04] Like in that period of time, I might not have had as much

[01:05] stuff that was as cool in the beginning.

[01:07] That applied as many people.

[01:08] Because the first 150 episodes is just me talking about

[01:11] how to run a gym better.

[01:12] Right around 150, I start talking about marketing in general

[01:15] because that's what I was into at the time.

[01:16] And then I start talking about sales.

[01:18] And I start talking about business in general

[01:19] and M&A and things as they evolved over time.

[01:21] And so the subject matter as well as my skill

[01:23] and delivering it both improved over that period of time.

[01:26] And now the podcast is top 10 on entrepreneurship

[01:28] and very high ranked in business.

[01:30] Next to names that I looked up to my whole career,

[01:33] I'm my whole account.

[01:34] I'm like, wait, wait, we just went up on this guy

[01:37] that I've been looking up to my whole life.

[01:38] It doesn't take 90 days.

[01:40] It takes years.

[01:42] If you think in days, the time's gonna pass no matter what.

[01:45] But if you can think in decades,

[01:46] when you make your goals, when that decade does pass,

[01:49] it'll show that you were thinking that way.

[01:51] Right, not the outcome of all make the action to go.

[01:53] If the action is, did I make the post,

[01:56] did I make the reachouts every day?

[01:57] Then you were a success.

[01:58] You checked both boxes.

[02:00] I want to tell you a quick story.

[02:01] So there was a guy who started at the first gym with me

[02:05] same day.

[02:06] All right, and we've been friends since then.

[02:07] And I started my gym and then he started his gym

[02:10] and he started changing gym so we went in parallel.

[02:12] And he ended up selling those gyms

[02:14] and he wanted to go online.

[02:15] He was like, dude, I need to build like a brand.

[02:18] And I was like, dude, you just need to start posting

[02:20] short form stuff, making stuff that's valuable.

[02:22] He posted every day for six months.

[02:27] And then one video took off.

[02:29] And then the next video took off.

[02:31] And the next video took off.

[02:32] And then I'm all of a sudden now,

[02:34] he's making $100,000 a month from the content

[02:37] that he was making.

[02:38] He'd already been doing business for nine years.

[02:40] And then all of a sudden it took off.

[02:42] And he messaged me and was like,

[02:43] I'm super grateful that he told me to do that.

[02:45] And so he did the post, he did the reachouts.

[02:47] And what ended up happening is that earlier on,

[02:50] he would have videos that would start taking off.

[02:53] He would start doing reachouts.

[02:54] He started making sales.

[02:55] And then he'd make some money.

[02:57] And then he would slow down.

[02:58] And then all of a sudden he'd get in scarcity mode

[02:59] once he was like, oh shoot, there's no money coming in.

[03:01] There's no money coming in.

[03:02] And then you start making content

[03:04] to start doing reachouts again.

[03:04] And then you make money again.

[03:05] And he was like, dude, how do I break the cycle?

[03:07] And what we did was we shifted what he was focusing on.

[03:09] Because he was focusing on the sales,

[03:10] he was making, he was focusing on the money,

[03:11] he was making rather than focusing on the process.

[03:14] You were not successful in my eyes

[03:16] because whenever you see some outcome,

[03:18] you stop the activities,

[03:20] which means you don't have the trait of consistency.

[03:22] It's like the reason you aren't where you want to be

[03:23] is because you can't do things repeatedly.

[03:25] And so most people can't do one thing over and over again.

[03:29] You need to be able to do the doing

[03:31] without seeing the result of your doing.

[03:32] And you have to keep doing it.

[03:34] And if you can't keep doing things, independent.

[03:36] And this is both ways.

[03:38] If it goes really well, you keep doing the thing

[03:40] that got you there.

[03:41] And if it's not going well, come again.

[03:44] You keep doing the thing so that you get good enough

[03:46] that one day it will.

[03:47] And that's the shift that most people don't make.

[03:49] And I think that's why most people just stick with.

[03:50] And the reality is that if you can commit to the actions

[03:52] and the behaviors and the traits that you will grow

[03:56] through doing, then at the end of this process

[03:58] a decade later, you will be the type of person

[04:00] who can do something for a long period of time and wait.

[04:02] And I promise you that if you have that trait,

[04:04] money will never be a constrained ally.

[04:06] And this is from a topic habits.

[04:07] Every winner and every loser have the same goals.

[04:11] So when you measure yourself by having this external thing

[04:14] and people like set goals, everyone wants to be rich.

[04:17] Everyone wants to have a six pack.

[04:19] Your goals don't make you unique.

[04:21] It's the activities that you do that make you unique.

[04:24] The goal of the winner is to commit to the activities,

[04:26] the goal of the loser is to commit to the goal.

[04:28] 52% of 18 year olds, high school seniors,

[04:31] think they're going to be millionaires by 25.

[04:32] The world is going to be shook.

[04:35] Many of you will fail.

[04:36] And that's because most of you have the same goal.

[04:37] Well, 50% of you think you're going to be a millionaire.

[04:39] That's just the math.

[04:40] But only a small percentage will because if you want to be

[04:43] a million, you're not going to focus on making the million

[04:45] dollars, you're going to focus on the stuff that makes my dollars.

[04:47] And so when you can divorce the activities from the outcome,

[04:51] then you can focus on the doing, which, whether your income

[04:55] does this over that period of time, your self-esteem remains

[04:58] the same because you're committing to what you can control.

[05:01] If you can make that shift, it will change your life.

[05:04] So I started making podcasts six years ago.

[05:07] I committed to that process.

[05:08] When I signed on with a YouTube vendor a few years ago

[05:12] on the first call I said, I'd like to have this channel

[05:16] be something in five to 10 years.

[05:18] I was like, we'll look at it then and see if it was worth continuing

[05:21] to do.

[05:22] I was like, but I'm in for a decade.

[05:23] And he stopped me afterwards.

[05:25] He was like, I've literally never had a client say that to me.

[05:28] Ever.

[05:29] He's like, they're all like, how can I get leads in the first 90 days

[05:31] from YouTube?

[05:32] They're like, blah, blah, blah.

[05:33] I was like, if we're making progress, I'm good.

[05:37] I will commit to that.

[05:38] I think that if you can think that way,

[05:40] you will get what you want.

[05:41] And then people will ask you a decade from now.

[05:43] Man, how did you have this overnight success in blah, blah, blah, blah

[05:46] and art you, like, don't the followers and the fans,

[05:48] like, how does it not get to your head and you're like,

[05:50] because it was never the goal?

[05:51] And so I feel just as good at year one as I do at your eight

[05:55] because the activities that I committed to remain safe.

[05:58] If you can think that way and you can shift your perspective,

[06:00] it will decrease your emotional ups and downs.

[06:02] And I think we all need ways to decrease our emotional ups

[06:04] and downs in the game of business

[06:06] because we need to have second lives that their lives

[06:08] in the fourth lives.

[06:09] And the way to do that is to not put your life

[06:12] your game playing life in something that you can't control.

[06:15] But putting all your game playing life in the things you can.

[06:18] Right now, we just crossed our 400th episode,

[06:21] 400 episodes.

[06:24] Like if I did one a week, that's 52,

[06:27] 48, one a week for a year,

[06:29] that would be eight years of doing that.

[06:31] If I had 400 episodes, I'm at like year six.

[06:33] If you make 400 long form pieces of content,

[06:37] I guarantee that you're following

[06:38] what we'd be bigger than it is to be.

[06:40] Well, how long is that gonna take?

[06:42] As long as it takes, because the goal was never

[06:44] the outcome, the goal was to do it the same.

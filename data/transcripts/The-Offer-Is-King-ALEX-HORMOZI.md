[00:00] Hello everyone and welcome back to, I guess my show.

[00:03] So anyways, I guess you could call a show.

[00:06] I don't know, thoughts, anyways.

[00:07] So I wanted to make something,

[00:09] so this called the offer is king.

[00:12] And that's because the offer is king.

[00:14] So if you have a good enough offer,

[00:17] you don't have to sell hard.

[00:18] You don't have to have amazing copy or amazing creative.

[00:23] You just get a lot of people to sign up for your thing.

[00:26] And so if you really think about your business,

[00:30] most business should be founded on a core offer that is

[00:33] exceptional, right?

[00:34] Can the e-resistant law offer?

[00:35] That is what it's going to grow the business, right?

[00:39] And so what I want to walk you through is three really

[00:42] good offers, the three components of those offers,

[00:48] and then seven ways to ethically use freight.

[00:50] So we're going to cover a lot of ground really fast.

[00:53] So three of the greatest offers of all time

[00:55] were Domino's offers.

[00:57] So I guess maybe remember this, but it was delivered

[01:01] to your door in 30 minutes or it's free, right?

[01:04] That's an e-resistant law offer.

[01:05] And they had shit pizza.

[01:06] But because of that, people wanted to make the order.

[01:09] They didn't have to sell them on it.

[01:10] They saw the offer and when they were hungry,

[01:11] they were like shooting 30 minutes, I can do that.

[01:13] I can have pizza at my door.

[01:15] And sometimes it's almost a challenge.

[01:17] It's like, well, if it's not in 30 minutes, I get the pizza free.

[01:19] So it was something that was incredibly compelling.

[01:23] It was one of the fundamental keys to their growth and why,

[01:26] back in the days of the other pages.

[01:28] It was literally an entire section with pizza.

[01:30] No other restaurant had a food category of pizza.

[01:31] Everything else is just restaurants, right?

[01:33] So any of you, that was because of that one key,

[01:37] yours is law offer.

[01:39] The next was 10 CDs for a penny.

[01:41] This was from I think it was so many way back in the day.

[01:44] Now obviously, it came with continuity.

[01:46] And so that was kind of like the first trial offer.

[01:49] But that offer was one of the single greatest offers

[01:51] of all time for those who were old enough to remember it.

[01:54] Third offer, you may recognize, which is, when it absolutely has to get there

[02:00] by tomorrow morning.

[02:01] And that is FedEx.

[02:02] So you'll notice the first two kind of have a pricing component.

[02:05] FedEx does not, but it has a really high value component to it.

[02:09] So I just want to break down these things into three pieces.

[02:13] Each offer has a component of believability, right?

[02:18] Here's a famous marketer who said, for every dollar you give me, I'll give you $1,000

[02:22] back, you ran it at the paper and you got zero responses.

[02:25] That is a crazy offer.

[02:27] But it's so good that it's not believable and literally no one responded to the ad.

[02:32] And so one of the things that makes offers believable is having a reason why that you

[02:37] would do this.

[02:38] If you're like, hey, I'm dropping all my prices by half off because all my inventory

[02:42] is going to go bad.

[02:44] People believe that.

[02:45] They're like, OK, or like, I'm overstacked.

[02:46] And I got to make a room for new inventory.

[02:50] Everything's half off.

[02:52] People believe that.

[02:53] It's a good reason why.

[02:54] So believability number one.

[02:55] Number two is a high ROI offer.

[02:57] So basically, it offers that people deemed valuable that can be communicated in a couple

[03:03] of words.

[03:04] Like, guaranteed to your door in under 30 minutes.

[03:06] That was valuable.

[03:08] For FedEx, it was at delivered to wherever you need to be or wherever you need to go by

[03:12] next morning.

[03:13] That is valuable, right?

[03:14] You can give offers, but if people don't find it valuable, it's not going to matter.

[03:18] And so the third piece is kind of the business around it.

[03:22] And so that's kind of what I want to cover with free offers.

[03:25] Because you'll notice the penny offers basically free.

[03:28] The Domino's Pizza offer has a free component to it.

[03:32] And so understanding how to use free as a marketer is probably, in my opinion, the

[03:37] single most valuable thing that you can learn how to do.

[03:40] It's learning how to build a better mouse trap.

[03:42] And so right now, I'm working on a book called Acquire.

[03:46] And the subtext is building a better mouse trap.

[03:49] Which is just kind of like, how to structure offers in a way that you can get tons of

[03:52] volume, but also make money on the offers, right?

[03:55] And so this is, you know, my notes for the different ways that you can use free offers.

[04:00] And I think I've seven on here.

[04:01] So I'll walk you through them pretty quickly to just kind of explain them.

[04:05] So the benefit of having free offers is that you get the highest line of leads, right?

[04:10] Number one.

[04:11] It's typically the lowest cost to acquire customers.

[04:14] So the number two.

[04:16] And the third is that, in my opinion, the key to having massive growth is to having

[04:21] a free offer, right?

[04:22] And especially something that's irresistible that can spread through a word of

[04:24] math that other people can comprehend.

[04:26] All right?

[04:27] So first of the free offers is a free buy offer, right?

[04:30] So this is where you offer a, so when someone comes in, you offer a program for free

[04:35] as a benefit for signing up, right?

[04:37] So Frank Kernway back in the day did a, he had all of his courses that he'd ever made.

[04:41] So high value offer, probably $12,000 in value.

[04:44] He said, I'll give you all of the courses that I've ever made.

[04:46] Absolutely free.

[04:48] If you sign up for my $397 month continuity, right?

[04:51] And my newsletter would have, right?

[04:53] So that's a free buy offer.

[04:54] So you can use the word free, brings lots of attention, has huge value in ROI.

[04:58] But it was a free with purchase, right?

[05:00] So that's kind of the idea.

[05:01] It's like if you buy this much smaller thing, you get this huge value thing for free.

[05:04] And it's also a really nice price anchor, okay?

[05:06] So that's number one.

[05:07] So the fitness thing, it's like, hey, our 6th week challenge is $1,000 or you can just

[05:12] sign up to become a member and get our $1,000 chance for free and only become a member

[05:15] for $200 a month, right?

[05:17] That becomes really compelling offer, lots of people say yes, and you get people straight

[05:20] in the continuity.

[05:21] All right?

[05:22] The second is a limited free offer.

[05:23] A limited free offer is, let's say, this isn't AB close.

[05:26] When someone walks in the door, obviously the vast majority of the people who are seeing

[05:30] this are your money, so I'm going to just make it, Jim specific.

[05:33] So if someone's coming in, you say, okay, the free thing, let's say, you sign up for

[05:36] 14 day or let's say it's 28 day.

[05:38] You come in for 28 day promotion.

[05:41] The free thing has one, you could say 28 day trial, they come in.

[05:45] It's one day a week of workouts.

[05:47] You have no personalized nutrition, no accountability couch, right?

[05:50] Now during the sales process, they'll already said they're not motivated, they need help

[05:53] all the while.

[05:54] And so then you upsell, right, as America is out for buy, a 28 day challenge or 28 day intensive

[06:01] or whatever you want to call accelerator, where they pay $1,99 or $2,99 or whatever,

[06:06] for the enhanced version that has three workouts a week or unlimited workouts and personalized

[06:11] nutrition and an accountability couch.

[06:13] And if they don't lose 10 pounds in the first 20 days, you give them another 28 days for it.

[06:19] So you have an upsell from an initial offer that makes it incredibly compelling, right?

[06:23] That's the point.

[06:24] All this is volume for free, but then you can sell upsell, three out of four people into

[06:28] a paid offer, right?

[06:30] So that's how you use free and you can monetize it.

[06:32] The third way of using free is a free trial post-pedal day.

[06:35] So this would be a down so these can be used in conjunction with one another.

[06:38] So if someone doesn't take that, the AB closed that I just mentioned, because they

[06:44] awesome, if you're going to stay, then you have to put a card down because you want to

[06:47] be held accountable.

[06:48] You have to work out this many times.

[06:49] If you miss your workouts, we're going to charge you for the missed workouts and you

[06:52] have to attend a feedback session and a transformation picture session and a nutrition

[06:57] session, right?

[06:58] If you know sure any of those that's $50, and so they have a huge motivator to actually consume

[07:03] your product or service, so the likelihood they convert in the back of this significantly

[07:06] higher, right?

[07:07] That's the point.

[07:08] And so that way at least your trials become more qualified trials and more invested,

[07:12] and it's really easy close to close someone on a free trial.

[07:16] If you can't close free trials, then you have other issues.

[07:20] Okay.

[07:21] The fourth one is a free with deposit.

[07:23] So this is a classic, the old six-week challenge that we ran for a very, very, very

[07:27] long time was probably the most popular fitness offer in the last decade.

[07:31] Because a free six-week challenge obviously you have to be compliant, put stipulations for

[07:34] any types of things on your advertisements, states, differ, et cetera.

[07:40] But that's where if someone hits a goal, they do an outcome, they can get their money back

[07:44] or get it credited towards something.

[07:46] So it's free with a contingency.

[07:48] So it's like you put $X dollars down.

[07:51] If you do XY and Z, you can either get it back or you can get it towards program whatever.

[07:55] That's kind of the pitch there.

[07:56] So it's a free with deposit.

[07:58] So free with stipulations.

[08:00] The fifth way of doing free is free forever.

[08:05] And this is a really compelling offer.

[08:07] So this is where you have to really know here in mass trap works.

[08:10] So if you have multiple ways of monetizing a customer, I could say, for example, I will

[08:14] train you for free for legitimate free.

[08:16] Like I will give you free training, straight up your membership to your forever.

[08:20] As long as you just do the things that I tell you to do, which may include buying supplements

[08:25] from us.

[08:26] That's part of the program.

[08:28] A good friend of mine owned a chain of French eyes of weight loss clinics.

[08:35] And they made only like 5% of the revenue on service and they made 95% of the revenue

[08:40] on supplements.

[08:41] And so people would come in and they'd essentially give the service away for free.

[08:45] But they had were required to use the supplements as a part of it.

[08:48] So that's a free, 100% free.

[08:51] But you're bolting on a different revenue streams.

[08:54] And that's where you can offer multiple services and monetize a different service than

[08:58] the one you're giving away for free.

[09:01] And especially if you have something that's high margin, you can give it out of way for

[09:06] free.

[09:07] If something's high margin in low value, it's an easy thing that you can give away

[09:10] for free and then give something also a way that's higher per se value or make them

[09:13] buy something that's higher per se value.

[09:15] People tend to appreciate physical products more than they appreciate service or value

[09:20] service.

[09:21] All right.

[09:22] So that's kind of a free forever model, which is really understanding that how you can monetize

[09:24] the second need, the next thing they're going to need after the first thing.

[09:28] The sixth way is a free giveaway.

[09:32] This is a classic, you run a free giveaway, let's say meals for a month.

[09:39] I'll pay for all your food for a month.

[09:41] I'll pay for your whatever.

[09:44] And so you get tons of people are going to opt in for that.

[09:45] And you say like, well, we picked one person.

[09:47] But if you're still under the program, it's this.

[09:49] And we'll give you discounts since you signed up.

[09:52] You know, signed up to be a part of it.

[09:53] So the thing is, is when you have this, people are still raising their hand to demonstrate

[09:56] they have a need for the service, right?

[09:59] And so if you have a giveaway that's perceived as high value and something that's related

[10:03] to the core offer that you have, you instantly get tons of very cheap leads that are qualified

[10:10] for the service.

[10:11] All right.

[10:12] A good friend of mine just started running a $25,000 transformation challenge and

[10:16] he's getting people to buy without even doing phone calls straight on the page because

[10:21] of $25,000 challenge and it's like $300 to sign up online.

[10:25] So people are seeing the huge giveaway and then choosing to participate to have the chance

[10:32] to earn that, right?

[10:33] Now, obviously, with giveaways and things like that, you always have to make sure you're not

[10:36] gambling or like kind of stuff.

[10:37] But I'm just talking big, high level marketing.

[10:40] All right.

[10:41] The next and probably last one of these seven, there's probably more of these are just

[10:45] the ones I thought I thought I was on my head.

[10:48] It's a free with commitment.

[10:50] So not contingency but commitment.

[10:52] So that's where you say your first 28 days or your first month is free as long as you commit

[11:00] to a nine month contract or you commit to a whatever.

[11:03] And so when you do that, you can still market free.

[11:06] You'd have to, again, put the contingencies in.

[11:08] You want to be a compliant advertiser.

[11:11] But that way, you can still get people free on the front end.

[11:13] It makes the sale very easy.

[11:14] It puts a little bit more of that onus on the fulfillment.

[11:17] But if you get the commitment, which you should, then you will be able to convert a very

[11:21] high percentage to people in the front end.

[11:22] And typically, at higher average contract values, because they're not confirming that price

[11:26] on the front end, it's more like perceiving the back end.

[11:30] They're kind of sort of going to see how it goes.

[11:32] Right?

[11:33] Now, that being said, during the process, you still need to sell the people, even if you're

[11:37] not closing them.

[11:38] So even if someone has their car file and it's planning on rebuilding, you still need

[11:41] to sell them on staying.

[11:42] So just the big mistake that I see happen all the time is that when people give trials and

[11:46] things like that, they're not actually just sell the trial rather than selling the continuity.

[11:50] Selling someone on a trial is just selling them on trying it.

[11:53] You have to still sell them again, even if they're on, you know, auto-biller, whatever.

[11:57] Because the thing is, you know, 30% of the people who go through are going to immediately

[12:00] call you up and say, oh, no, no, I didn't mean to let that go through.

[12:02] And then you have to charge back some all sorts of crap.

[12:03] So you don't want that.

[12:05] Make sure they know they're getting it built.

[12:06] And if it were me, I'd probably only build the people that I knew had been sold and had kind

[12:12] of at least verbally agreed to.

[12:14] We already have the contract, but at least I know that they're in.

[12:16] So those are seven ways to make free offers to get lots of people in the door and make

[12:22] it.

[12:23] It was a simple offer that will ultimately make you more money.

[12:25] So learning how to monetize free is one of the biggest tools in your skill set, in your

[12:31] toolbox.

[12:32] And if you don't know how to do it, you will be a significant disadvantage because your

[12:35] competitors will be.

[12:37] And they can acquire more customers at a cheap price than you do.

[12:40] And if they can monetize them in the ways that are just outlined, and you just know the metrics,

[12:45] you know what percentage, convert what percentage, stay what the average ticket is.

[12:48] And that's why I know in the math is so important.

[12:49] But if you know those metrics, then you can market with reckless abandon because you know

[12:53] what your LTV is.

[12:55] And you know that you can win based on those numbers.

[12:57] So anyways, I hope that was about before you.

[12:59] The offer is absolutely king.

[13:01] Like if you get the offer right, someone should be able to explain to someone else in like

[13:04] one sentence or two sentences.

[13:07] What it is that the offer is.

[13:09] If you can't explain it like that, then it is not clear enough to a prospect.

[13:13] And if you get the offer right, it will make you more money than you know what to do with.

[13:18] All right.

[13:19] So anyways, hope you guys are doing amazing Tuesday.

[13:22] Keep rocking and rolling and I can see you guys soon.

[13:24] Like and comment if you found this valuable.

[13:25] So the guides of the internet will favor this and show it to more people.

[13:29] All right, keep being awesome.

[13:30] Good you soon.

[13:31] Bye.

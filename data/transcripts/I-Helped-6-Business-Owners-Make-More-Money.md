[00:00] There's three ways you can get leads, right?

[00:01] One is you can manually assemble the leads list.

[00:03] The second ways that you can buy leads from brokers

[00:06] and the third ways that you can scrape leads using software.

[00:08] For me, I usually will start with...

[00:10] How's it going?

[00:16] Good.

[00:17] I have two questions, sort of both different topics,

[00:20] but the first one is more lead related.

[00:22] Stubbing to figure out which method is the best method

[00:25] to focus on, so I don't feel like I'm wasting my time,

[00:29] doing something to try to get leads.

[00:32] Who are you going after?

[00:33] The three main avatars would be like text startups,

[00:36] B2BB to C SaaS, and then really any company

[00:38] that has like a custom software.

[00:41] So there's three ways you can get leads, right?

[00:43] One is you can manually assemble the leads list.

[00:45] The second ways that you can buy leads from brokers

[00:48] and the third ways that you can scrape leads using software.

[00:51] I usually will start with scraping if I can,

[00:55] because it tends to be the cheapest.

[00:57] And so I'll use like if you just Google tool for whatever,

[01:00] like, you know what I'm about to say.

[01:01] Yeah.

[01:02] Yeah.

[01:03] And then I'll take the top four, five of them

[01:05] and I'll run my search for avatars into each of them

[01:09] and then I'll take a sample of like let's say a hundred

[01:11] or 500 leads of each, work all of them,

[01:13] see which ones I get the highest response rate

[01:15] and then I'll double down or whatever platform

[01:17] got me the highest throughput.

[01:18] You're saying which platform gets you the highest response rate

[01:21] that we're referring to?

[01:22] Which lead source?

[01:23] Yeah, I mean, in terms of reaching out to the actual leads itself,

[01:25] I reach out on everything.

[01:26] That's sort of tied into next thing.

[01:28] So one thing I've been thinking about is,

[01:29] you know how you talk about to lead with sort of with value,

[01:32] offer something essentially for free.

[01:34] So that's like a big thing where I'm just like not really sure

[01:38] how to even figure out what we could offer

[01:41] being that like, am I like stepping, is this like stuff?

[01:45] No, you're good.

[01:46] This is like I go through this literal step-by-step process

[01:48] in the book of everything that you're saying.

[01:50] So it's like how to figure out what you're going to give

[01:52] the person for free, how to structure it,

[01:53] how to make like, here's the script to get replies, all that stuff.

[01:57] So the good news is the book will solve your problem,

[01:59] but the best framework that I can use for coming up with things

[02:02] that people will reply to is give them something free

[02:05] that they would normally pay for.

[02:06] So rather than be like, I made this amazing thing,

[02:08] but if it's the same free valuable thing that everyone else gives,

[02:11] then how good is it, you have to compete

[02:13] by being significantly better.

[02:14] But if you just do something that normally other people charge

[02:17] for even on a micro level and they can describe real value

[02:20] to that, people will respond to you.

[02:22] And then you're operating on a way better frame

[02:25] and then you can have a much better conversation.

[02:27] The other thing was more like on a personal side.

[02:29] So if we could just sort of step back

[02:31] when you were sort of going through that volatility

[02:35] of you had like success, then big failures

[02:37] and come back up, in terms of how you structured your life

[02:41] if you did it all so that you put yourself

[02:43] in the best position to where like you're cutting certain people

[02:47] out, maybe you're bringing certain people

[02:49] or that might be even resources for skill development

[02:52] or whatever in, how do you go about doing that

[02:55] so that you're not doing things that don't really help you move

[02:59] forward and grow long-term big picture?

[03:02] Yeah.

[03:03] So it's a really good question

[03:04] because the number one way to change your behavior

[03:07] is to change your environment.

[03:09] So if you change the conditions, you'll behave differently.

[03:13] Like if there's a red light, you act differently

[03:14] than a green light.

[03:15] And so that's a micro example of how we act like in Baltimore

[03:19] when I live there, I act differently than when I move

[03:21] because I had to clean slate.

[03:22] Like I didn't have to talk to old friends.

[03:24] That would treat me a certain way

[03:25] that then I would respond to in the way that I didn't want to.

[03:29] And so first thing from a people perspective,

[03:32] like I think a lot can be gained

[03:33] from literally just moving 30 minutes away.

[03:35] Like even if you like I can't move out of,

[03:37] I'm not gonna move from Baltimore to California.

[03:39] Okay, that's fine.

[03:40] Just move to the other side of town.

[03:41] Just get out of the micro environment.

[03:44] The second thing that'll then lead to

[03:45] is the people that you will frequent will change.

[03:48] And I think that you'll have to get a custom or be okay

[03:51] with the fact that you will lose a lot of friends.

[03:54] And that's not a bad thing.

[03:56] Because the thing is, if all you have in common

[03:59] continues to shrink and shrink and shrink

[04:00] and the only thing you have left to talk about

[04:02] is the past, remember the good old times.

[04:04] Remember that time we got so drunk at Rippies,

[04:06] you know what I mean like whatever,

[04:07] then like they're not trying to help you create

[04:09] the future that you were ultimately looking for.

[04:10] And it just like I will say that as I've gotten,

[04:13] you know, further along in that path,

[04:16] my time to cutting people has just shrank.

[04:18] Because if I figure if I'm going to cut this person

[04:20] eventually, I might as well cut them now

[04:23] and start enjoying the benefits of not having them

[04:25] in my life and having all this back.

[04:27] And it's like all those times,

[04:28] if I have somebody who just keeps inviting me to shit

[04:30] and then making me feel guilty,

[04:31] if I go out and they're like,

[04:32] why aren't you drinking or like why aren't you?

[04:33] Like, oh, he's on another diet, you know, whatever.

[04:36] It's just like you're not helped.

[04:37] Like just asking the question like,

[04:39] how do you think what you're saying is going to help me?

[04:41] And if there's like, well, I'm just giving you

[04:43] a hard time is like, yeah, understood.

[04:45] How is that going to help me?

[04:47] It's not.

[04:48] Okay, so like either change your behavior

[04:50] or I will change it for you meaning I will just not

[04:52] have you in my life.

[04:54] The third piece is that I remember there's this video.

[04:56] I had just opened my six location

[04:59] and I was looking to open seven through 10

[05:01] and I had already mapped out

[05:02] where I was going to be opening them for my gyms.

[05:05] And I remember I did this Facebook live

[05:06] and I was like beat up.

[05:08] You know, I was tired.

[05:09] I was doing 12 hours a day as a sale.

[05:11] So I was taking sales from eight to eight every day

[05:13] and then I would still do the rest of my work

[05:15] before and after that.

[05:16] And somehow trying to work out.

[05:18] During that period, I remember saying,

[05:19] what are you willing to give up?

[05:21] So I made this live.

[05:22] It was like, these are all the things I'm giving up now.

[05:24] So like these are things that I used to do

[05:25] that I'm not gonna be doing anymore.

[05:27] So I was like, I'm not falling the ravens anymore.

[05:29] So I was a Baltimore ravens fan.

[05:30] I was like, I'm not, I'm not watching football.

[05:31] I'm not looking at fantasy.

[05:33] I'm not gonna build a team.

[05:34] I'm just on Sundays.

[05:36] I need to work.

[05:37] Like I can't give the three hour.

[05:38] I can't do it.

[05:39] So I gave up football.

[05:40] I gave up Netflix.

[05:41] I was like, that nighttime

[05:43] were like normally I like decompressed.

[05:46] I was like, I don't have time for that right now.

[05:47] Like I got a process payments.

[05:48] I got process contracts.

[05:49] I got fog with leads and do reminders for the next day.

[05:52] And so it was changing where I was places wise.

[05:56] Being okay with the fact

[05:57] that I was gonna have a period of a little bit more solitude

[05:59] because as soon as you cut things,

[06:01] you create room, a creative vacuum.

[06:03] But new people will come in who are like in this world.

[06:06] And I would recommend just connecting with people online

[06:08] because there's so many, there's so big

[06:09] or communities of people who are trying to do the same thing

[06:11] online versus wherever you're at locally.

[06:14] And then the third is just like, what are my behaviors?

[06:16] What are the things I'm going to give up in order,

[06:19] like because you gotta make room,

[06:20] like you only have 24 hours, right?

[06:22] So it's like what are the things that aren't getting me

[06:23] where I wanna go?

[06:24] And the things is if you just say I'm not gonna do those,

[06:27] positive behaviors will fill the gap.

[06:29] I think for me, it comes to more maybe a family side of things.

[06:33] Like those people, I have a different way of dealing with them,

[06:37] their family, but like I don't know how to necessarily

[06:40] navigate that.

[06:41] So two things.

[06:42] First off, I have very extreme views on this.

[06:44] So like just take that with the grain of salt

[06:45] that you will, right?

[06:47] If we zoom all the way out, like I didn't choose to be born,

[06:50] that was forced on man.

[06:51] And so like I don't feel like I owe anyone for that, right?

[06:54] Now that being said, I believe in Fairx

[06:55] Ginger, a bun and exchange, meaning like,

[06:57] I'm gonna make everybody in my life better for being there.

[07:00] But I want them to also make my life better, right?

[07:03] And so I think the first layer of this is approaching it

[07:06] with absolute candor, which is like what you would tell me,

[07:09] being like man, my dad, you know, he just treats me

[07:11] like a McKinney, he always brings up these things,

[07:13] like when I was 14 years old,

[07:15] and he keeps it up, you know, Zeev's got a short temper.

[07:18] You know, like my dad says that,

[07:20] he's like you want, you're such a short temper, right?

[07:21] He's always telling me that.

[07:22] And so you have to reset, like you have to reset

[07:26] about like these are the rules of engagement.

[07:28] Like if you want me in your life,

[07:30] this is what is required for me,

[07:32] which is like you cannot speak to me this way.

[07:35] Like if you're big uncle,

[07:36] graduate by the neck, and he's like,

[07:38] look, I wanna look at you, you know, whatever,

[07:40] something like, I'm not saying he's doing that,

[07:41] but I'm saying, as an extreme example,

[07:43] like what would you do there?

[07:44] You, you're like, no, it creates a moment where they're like,

[07:51] oh, now they'll then probably try and shake it,

[07:53] I'm like, dude, I was just kidding,

[07:54] it's like it wasn't funny.

[07:55] I'd be like, it's just you and me, and I'm not laughing.

[07:59] And then it's like, whoa, that's a new tone, right?

[08:01] And so like you have to reset boundaries,

[08:04] have to reset the rules of engagement.

[08:06] And then the thing is is that you have to enforce those,

[08:09] which means that at a certain point,

[08:11] you have to decide that I'm in a decrease

[08:12] in my communication cadence.

[08:14] I'm gonna decrease my proximity to you.

[08:16] I'm not gonna be as accessible.

[08:18] When you text me,

[08:19] might take me a couple of days to respond, right?

[08:21] When you say, hey, got him in, I might not have a minute, right?

[08:25] Like you have to earn that.

[08:27] And like the fact that you are family

[08:29] gives you morally way, but not infinite.

[08:32] And so one of the unfortunate things about family

[08:34] is that we treat family worse than anyone else

[08:37] because we think that we can't lose them.

[08:39] And so I reject that notion entirely.

[08:40] I just don't, I believe in treating everyone the same,

[08:44] family and stranger.

[08:46] And then if I can benefit them awesome

[08:48] and if they can benefit me awesome,

[08:49] and then we both keep loving our relationship

[08:52] because we don't feel like we're owed anything.

[08:54] And so that's bidirectional though.

[08:57] Cause that's the thing is if you're gonna play this game,

[08:59] my opinion, this is the way I play it,

[09:01] which is that you're like, listen, I don't owe you stuff,

[09:05] but it means I'm also not gonna say you owe me anything.

[09:07] And like we're starting there.

[09:10] That's how I approach those things.

[09:11] Thanks for taking my questions.

[09:12] Appreciate it.

[09:13] You've been so appreciate your good luck, man.

[09:17] Hey Alex, how is it going?

[09:19] Selena, what's going on?

[09:20] How do you strike the balance between offering free value

[09:24] to pay offers?

[09:26] Like when is the perfect time to make that switch?

[09:29] So you give until they ask,

[09:31] simple as that.

[09:32] You give and you keep giving and you keep giving

[09:35] until eventually people are like, dude, what else do you have?

[09:38] Can I get this from you?

[09:39] Like, dude, you've helped me so much.

[09:40] Like, is there?

[09:41] And what happens is you'll start hearing

[09:43] what different people want from you.

[09:45] And then you'll start noticing the common thread.

[09:47] And then you can ask permission from your audience

[09:51] of the people that you are providing this value to.

[09:52] And be like, hey, if I did something like this,

[09:54] would you guys be interested?

[09:55] And then take a poll, very easy, right?

[09:58] And if they say lots of them say yes,

[10:00] then it's like now you have permission from the audience

[10:03] to then say cool, well, I'm gonna go spend

[10:05] three months building this for you.

[10:07] And I'm gonna get it to you guys.

[10:08] Just because you give things away for free

[10:10] does not mean that everything that you do is free.

[10:13] We give free stuff in order to get more people interested

[10:17] and earn more trust so that a longer time rising

[10:20] can convert more people into customers.

[10:22] A purchase decision is a prediction of future value.

[10:26] Like, I'm gonna buy this thing

[10:27] because I believe that after I buy it,

[10:29] I'm going to get in access to whatever I paid for, right?

[10:32] And the best way to increase someone's conviction

[10:36] that they're going to get value from you in the future

[10:38] is to provide a value to them in the present.

[10:41] Yeah.

[10:42] And so that's the whole game.

[10:44] And so I'll give you a different example.

[10:46] So if I were to go up to 100 people and say,

[10:48] hey, buy my thing, right?

[10:50] I might get one person to buy it

[10:51] because I might have caught him on a good day

[10:52] and they're really struggling whatever, right?

[10:55] If I go to the same 100 people and say,

[10:57] hey, can I solve one of your problems for free?

[11:00] More than one person will say yes.

[11:02] Maybe 20 people will say yes.

[11:03] And then from those 20 people,

[11:05] when you crush it for them and then say, hey, by the way,

[11:08] I solved this first problem,

[11:09] you now have another problem,

[11:11] that's a better problem, but it's still a problem.

[11:13] And I can solve that for you too,

[11:15] in exchange for money,

[11:17] a way higher percentage of that 20

[11:19] will now take you up on the offer.

[11:20] And then you get half of those 20 to buy your thing.

[11:23] And you go from one sale,

[11:24] talking to 100 people to 10 sales.

[11:26] So you can 10 acts your conversion rate

[11:28] by just adding a level of trust prior to the ask.

[11:31] How do you come up with that idea and think about,

[11:33] okay, I'm going to give this for free.

[11:36] And you have the idea.

[11:37] You have the idea.

[11:39] Honestly, okay, I'm gonna dive a little level underneath,

[11:42] is that you're not accustomed to the level of work

[11:44] that's required, like real talk, you're just not used to it.

[11:47] And that's okay.

[11:48] My level of output and my understanding

[11:50] of how much work capacity I have

[11:52] has continued to increase over time.

[11:53] I've put 200 hours into the presentation

[11:56] that I'm gonna be giving on Saturday.

[11:59] Most people don't put 200 hours into their product.

[12:02] It's just orders of magnitude in terms of difference.

[12:05] And so like if people saw how much time I put into the things,

[12:08] they wouldn't be surprised by the value.

[12:10] They'd be like, well, that makes sense.

[12:11] He spent 200 hours on actually,

[12:13] I'm a little embarrassed for the guy.

[12:14] He spent basically five weeks of work hours

[12:17] to make one, you know, 90 minute presentation.

[12:20] And so I think that if you were to think about,

[12:21] like, for you to actually spend legitimately,

[12:24] like working hours, spend 200 hours

[12:27] on making something really good.

[12:29] And that doesn't mean making it longer.

[12:31] It means making it better.

[12:33] And then give that away for free.

[12:37] And then what happens is that really is good.

[12:39] People will then share it with other people.

[12:41] And then you get double effect.

[12:42] You get more people to take you up on the free offer

[12:44] and then their friends, then you other people.

[12:47] There's so much more work that goes into it.

[12:50] I spent six hours a day for two years on this next book.

[12:53] I work from six to noon every day

[12:55] and then I take my meetings.

[12:57] I did that every day for two years.

[13:00] And now I'm releasing the book, right?

[13:02] And I feel very confident that it's a good,

[13:04] it's a very good product, right?

[13:06] And so again, I think my level of work

[13:09] in terms of hours is probably greater than what you were doing.

[13:11] And I have a lot of stuff going on, right?

[13:14] But you just have to be able to block the time

[13:16] and say the first four hours of my day,

[13:18] every day for this month are making this thing.

[13:21] And I'm gonna make it exceptional.

[13:22] And the thing is document you making it,

[13:25] show people how much work you're putting into it.

[13:27] And then when you do have it, they're like, wow,

[13:29] she really did this.

[13:30] She didn't just whip up a PDF that took her a day.

[13:33] I used to think that a day of like,

[13:34] oh, this took me a whole day,

[13:36] a whole day in my mind was a long time.

[13:39] And the nice thing is that the really valuable fruit

[13:42] are right in front of everyone.

[13:44] It just has a very tall ladder.

[13:46] So you just have to climb a lot longer

[13:48] than other people will to go pick the fruit,

[13:50] but it's right in front of you.

[13:52] You just have to spend way more time

[13:53] making the thing exceptional.

[13:55] Which also means that all the other distractions

[13:57] that you're probably distracted on right now

[13:59] these little side projects.

[14:00] This is me just guessing right now, right?

[14:02] You have to cut that because what you realize is

[14:04] the amount of work that's required

[14:05] to make something exceptional

[14:06] precludes you from doing multiple things.

[14:09] Yes.

[14:10] Like you can't do multiple things well.

[14:12] You can do one thing exceptionally well.

[14:14] And that means that you have to say no to everything else.

[14:16] Yeah.

[14:17] How do you find that exceptional thing then?

[14:20] It's not that you find it, you make it.

[14:21] The more you do the better you get

[14:23] and the more you pull the thread on any of the things

[14:25] that you're interested in, the deeper you'll go on it

[14:27] because you will get better at it

[14:29] by the very fact of how much volume you're putting into it.

[14:32] So whatever it is that you help people with,

[14:34] the one that makes you the most money right now,

[14:36] ignore everything else, ignore the other opportunities,

[14:40] and say like, how do I make this even easier?

[14:42] Like thing about the value equation.

[14:43] How do I make it faster for them?

[14:45] How do I make it less effort for them?

[14:46] How do I increase their perception of the likelihood

[14:48] that they're going to succeed?

[14:49] Which means that, you know what?

[14:51] I've been offering one product,

[14:52] but I really have three avatars.

[14:54] And so I need to just make this tiny tweak here

[14:56] so that this person and this person and this person

[14:58] will be successful.

[15:00] Now, if I was going to lean even more out,

[15:02] they just pick one of the three

[15:03] and then exclude the other ones.

[15:04] Just master a puddle, just be queen of a puddle.

[15:08] And then you can be queen of a pond

[15:10] and then queen of a lake and then queen of a bay

[15:12] and then queen of an ocean, right?

[15:13] Like, but you got to start with the puddle

[15:14] because you're like half in half out between different ones.

[15:16] Figuring out what's my thing that I'm really, really good at

[15:20] and like spend a lot of time on and perfecting that.

[15:24] Don't even think the thing that you're really good at

[15:25] is you might not be that good at anything right now.

[15:27] And I'm not saying that, that's not a rat.

[15:29] I'm just saying like, that's not a dig.

[15:30] I'm saying do the one that you forget about time

[15:34] while you're doing it and then you will become excellent.

[15:39] Because you'll be able to actually keep working.

[15:41] Like, you have to solve for what is the thing

[15:43] that I can work the most.

[15:44] Like, this amount of work is required

[15:47] to get where you want to go, right?

[15:48] It'd be exceptional.

[15:49] And so then what you solve for is,

[15:51] how can I find something that I don't mind doing

[15:54] this much work of?

[15:55] But this much work is required no matter what.

[15:58] And if you do this much work, whether you're learning

[16:00] to be the best plumber or the best architect

[16:02] or the best whatever weight loss coach, that, like,

[16:05] if you can do that and forget about time, you'll win.

[16:08] When I started on YouTube, I told the guy

[16:09] that was editing my thing.

[16:11] I said, listen, I'll do three videos a week for 10 years.

[16:14] I was like, and then if we'll measure whether it worked or not.

[16:17] He's like, I've literally never had anyone say that.

[16:18] So like, what now is just like, you need a perspective shift.

[16:22] Thank you so much for the opportunity.

[16:24] And thank you so much for the answer.

[16:29] Joe, what's up, man?

[16:30] How are we doing now?

[16:31] It's nice to meet you.

[16:32] Nice to meet you too.

[16:34] Awesome.

[16:34] My name's Joe, I'm in the gym space.

[16:37] I'm in the very important gym space.

[16:38] The space you move.

[16:39] I know some stuff about it.

[16:41] I know stuff about it.

[16:42] And I'm one of those guys who read gym launch a couple years

[16:46] to late over older.

[16:47] So I made all the same, all the mistakes you talk and talk

[16:51] about when I felt like when I read the book,

[16:53] I felt like I was reading a day job,

[16:55] but I was like, oh my god, all these things happened to me.

[16:57] So my question to you is, me and my business partner,

[17:01] Dan, are launching a series of semi-five

[17:04] of personal training studios which build that space.

[17:07] And we're launching one shortly.

[17:09] And so using the $100 million leads book that's coming out

[17:13] and some of the stuff from gym launch

[17:15] and $100 million offers, what would you do to launch a gym

[17:19] or plan every six months for the next few years

[17:23] until we get a number that we're happy with and we keep it in thought?

[17:27] My preference, my preferred model is one of two.

[17:31] Now you're already doing one of them

[17:31] so I won't even get into the other one.

[17:32] But I love the semi-private model.

[17:35] I love that like $300, $400,

[17:38] and month price point two to three times a week.

[17:41] I like going after avatars that have a little bit more money

[17:46] specifically because they're not paid

[17:50] during the holidays.

[17:51] I mean for them, they're not going to be breaking the bank

[17:53] over $300.

[17:56] And the nice thing, and I think this is,

[17:58] I got this from Rick Mayow of alloy.

[18:01] That model allows you to get to about $500,000 a year

[18:05] with 1,200 square feet, 1,400 square feet,

[18:08] like super small footprint and a single manager

[18:12] who's got maybe 10, 20% profit here,

[18:14] maybe like 40 50 k base.

[18:16] And two helpers.

[18:18] So it's a very simple lean model,

[18:20] 106, 108 depending on how you want to do it.

[18:24] And all you have to do is get to 120-ish at the location.

[18:28] And it's usually 50% margin.

[18:30] I mean, I have over time simplified and simplified the model

[18:35] so that there's just so little operational complexity

[18:37] so that you can scale.

[18:39] And because of you from Luma Dunbar's number, yeah.

[18:42] So the reason I like this model

[18:44] is that like most micro gyms cap at 120 to 150.

[18:48] And it's because the systems required

[18:51] to purposely manufacture human connection

[18:55] become significantly more complex

[18:56] as you cross that barrier.

[18:58] And so rather than create this very, very complex machine

[19:02] to make it run at 600 service-based members,

[19:05] I'd rather just have a model that runs very profitably

[19:09] at 120 to 150 members.

[19:11] And so lead gym perspective.

[19:14] Number one is that I would do a three month pre-launch.

[19:17] Number two is that I would disproportionately

[19:19] spend on the launch.

[19:20] So I would put like 30 grand into the pre-sales

[19:25] and I would open it for capacity.

[19:27] The best gym franchises know how to pre-sale

[19:31] so that they are in the black in the first month.

[19:34] And like every time I opened a new location,

[19:36] there's the first location was the one

[19:37] that I didn't learn that I learned,

[19:38] met the lesson on my first one.

[19:40] Because I thought I was trying to get it open as fast as possible

[19:42] so I could make money.

[19:43] But with everyone after that,

[19:45] I tried to do pre-sales as long as possible

[19:46] so I could make all this money

[19:47] and not have to pay any expenses.

[19:49] And so that what you can also focus too

[19:51] because you can just sell for three months

[19:53] to do nothing but work leads and close contracts.

[19:56] And then after that, I'm sure you're,

[19:59] what's your turn right now for a semis?

[20:01] Right now, only about 5%.

[20:04] Okay, I mean, I would shoot for three, you know what I mean?

[20:07] But five's okay.

[20:08] You know, if you've got, let's just say five, right?

[20:10] And you've got 120 members,

[20:12] it's six members a month you got a replace.

[20:14] Like it's just like it's so easy to replace that.

[20:18] And just expect like if you have

[20:21] in what's your price point monthly, about 400.

[20:24] Okay, so 400, so that's an 8KLTV, right?

[20:28] In terms of revenue and profit,

[20:29] but like 8KLTV, like you should be able to spend

[20:32] 500 bucks to a car crash where not even sweat on it.

[20:34] And so like if you pay up to 100 bucks to leave,

[20:37] local so they can close 20% of those in the contracts.

[20:41] I'm not saying those are good numbers.

[20:42] I'm saying those are exaggeratedly bad numbers.

[20:45] You still be fine, right?

[20:47] Because even if you had a close six customers the month,

[20:49] it's three grand a month and a ad, it's just a maintain.

[20:51] It's nothing.

[20:52] Now, when Jim will want you to talk about,

[20:53] you know, doing your six-week transformation,

[20:55] you can still recommend that as the primary giveaway

[20:59] because that's all the best I've got.

[21:00] I mean, the last thing.

[21:01] The rapper can change.

[21:03] You know what I mean?

[21:04] I was just wrapping paper on the present,

[21:06] but like we're still doing nutrition,

[21:07] we're still doing workouts.

[21:08] So like whether I do six week, 42 days, 21 days, 28 days,

[21:13] belly fat blast, metabolic reset,

[21:16] like slim by Halloween, you know,

[21:18] lean by Halloween, you know, to the slim for Santa,

[21:21] big booty bootcamp,

[21:22] free six-week challenge, 42-80 talks, like a fucking down of mile.

[21:25] Like at the end of the day, like all of those are rappers

[21:29] that you rotate locally just so that your ad is not fatigue,

[21:33] but you want to always push it into the same sales process

[21:35] so that the ops don't change.

[21:36] So it's like the adult change,

[21:38] and then you get on the phone, you're like,

[21:39] hey, what made you sign up for insert name or promotion?

[21:41] They're gonna be like, well, I'm kind of overweight,

[21:43] and you're like, great.

[21:44] What have you done so far, right?

[21:46] You start going through it.

[21:47] So my second question is, you know,

[21:48] with a business partner who, you know,

[21:50] we have kind of like a different person

[21:52] as we work really great together,

[21:53] 17 years of the great partnership.

[21:56] How do we, how do you manage,

[21:58] or what would you recommend?

[21:59] My preferred mode is take risk, scale fast,

[22:04] like we have momentum,

[22:06] we're maxed out in both our other gyms.

[22:08] We have a great local reputation and recognition.

[22:12] I'm like, let's do 10 of these in the next like three years,

[22:16] and he's like, loses mind over it.

[22:18] Like, he's more of a prove it guy.

[22:21] In your experience, you know, what's better,

[22:24] you know, speed, or, or, or, or,

[22:27] proven, you're both right.

[22:29] A good partnership has a yes man and a, and a no man, right?

[22:33] And so like in my dynamic with Leila,

[22:35] it's like, I'm yes, she's no, right?

[22:37] And that's basically how everything gets managed.

[22:40] If you're up to me, we joke,

[22:41] it's like we would have 100 businesses

[22:43] if we're up to her, we'd have none.

[22:44] He says no because he's known so much work it is, right?

[22:47] Like if you're the promoter and the, you know,

[22:50] CEO, whatever you want to call it,

[22:51] then there's usually more like strategic works,

[22:54] there's leadership stuff, but in terms of like,

[22:56] day to day, they usually bear the brunt of the work.

[22:59] And so it's cost more to them, it's more painful.

[23:01] And so I'll give you my advice from what I would do

[23:05] having now worked with an implementer for a long time

[23:07] is I say, what would you need to see

[23:09] for us to be, for you to feel comfortable with us doing that?

[23:12] And then she'll say, here's the checklist.

[23:14] If you do these things and you make sure

[23:15] the user the things that are done,

[23:17] we can do the next one.

[23:18] And then that way we have an agreement.

[23:20] And it's like, and to be clear,

[23:22] if we do the same checklist at location three,

[23:24] you feel good again, and like, yeah, I'm good again,

[23:27] if we have these things.

[23:29] And so, and then you're, and then you're aligned.

[23:31] And then it's like cool, let's just keep the party going.

[23:33] That's perfect, yeah, that's great.

[23:35] That's great advice.

[23:35] Thank you so much.

[23:36] I'm really excited and grateful for everything

[23:39] you've given after the community of strength.

[23:41] For sure.

[23:42] Appreciate it, man.

[23:43] Thanks, y'all.

[23:46] Nicole.

[23:47] What's up?

[23:48] I don't know if you remember me we met at Eric's

[23:50] who's, yeah, mastermind.

[23:51] So since then, I started a podcast doing pretty well.

[23:57] I made most of my money as a creator doing brand deals.

[24:01] So for example, I was big in the crypto space.

[24:05] The second I started my podcast,

[24:06] I had like a six-figure deal, which coming to an end,

[24:10] I don't think it's gonna be renewed.

[24:12] Everyone that I talk to is like,

[24:14] Nicole, you've grown on all of these social pages.

[24:18] Not just my personal, but like, you know,

[24:20] other brands that where I'm like curating other people's

[24:23] content, and everyone's like, it's a no fucking brain

[24:25] or do a newsletter.

[24:27] I talk to, say, he'll bloom, for example,

[24:30] just so lads in his and that's his model.

[24:34] But you know, then I also reduce say recently

[24:37] that like subscribers and followers don't really mean

[24:41] anything like their vanity metric.

[24:42] And your like the game is now click retain reward.

[24:47] What exactly does that look like?

[24:49] Because it's like, currently I have nothing to sell you up.

[24:53] You're good.

[24:54] So it's two separate applications.

[24:56] So from the growth perspective,

[24:59] like growing the audience, getting more people to see your stuff,

[25:02] like that in that world, subscribers.

[25:05] I mean, the TikTok has changed the game in terms of how

[25:08] all the algorithms work, right?

[25:09] Like right now, if you have 10 million subscribers on YouTube,

[25:12] if you're next video sucks, it's not gonna give you this.

[25:15] Period.

[25:15] Yeah, it works, same thing with Instagram.

[25:17] You see people with 10 million per, you know,

[25:18] 10 million accounts make a post and it's got 300 likes on it, right?

[25:23] It's because on the flip side though,

[25:25] it's good for new creators because you can come on

[25:26] with zero followers, make a bang in video,

[25:28] and get 10 million views.

[25:30] And I actually think it's good thing for everyone

[25:33] because it equalizes the playing field and makes content king,

[25:35] like the quality of what you put out,

[25:37] which I'm always down to compete on that.

[25:39] And so that's from the growth perspective.

[25:43] From building out a newsletter, like one is top of funnel,

[25:46] the newsletter subscribers, I mean that,

[25:48] like those are customers, you know what I mean?

[25:50] And so, I mean, no way against having, you know,

[25:54] a newsletter of any sort that provides values,

[25:57] especially to a niche audience because a buddy of mine

[26:01] has a ton of data on subscriber stuff.

[26:02] And like the ones that do the best in terms of LTV and whatnot

[26:06] are typically hyper niche and high value.

[26:09] So usually a little bit higher price point,

[26:11] but very specific to, like,

[26:13] because they're so niche,

[26:15] they can provide it like a lot of value to a person

[26:19] versus being super wide.

[26:20] It's very hard to provide tremendous value to everyone, right?

[26:23] And it's kind of like Elon Musk's thing of like,

[26:25] you can either provide a little bit of value to a lot of people,

[26:26] or a lot of value to a few people.

[26:28] And so I think if you feel like you're better at a specific niche,

[26:31] I think it makes sense for you to go.

[26:34] Top of funnel is just get really good at making content

[26:37] and then that just converts into your subscriber network.

[26:41] So your newsletter and then you sell ads

[26:43] to the newsletter if you want to from an endorsement perspective.

[26:45] If you can also have your own products if you want to,

[26:48] but you just become a media business at that point.

[26:50] Which is fine.

[26:51] I mean, I'm a big fan of media business.

[26:53] Okay, that's really helpful.

[26:55] The other question that I had, your dynamic is so different

[26:58] than what we've seen in like traditional relationships,

[27:01] yet it still works and you guys kill it.

[27:04] So what's that dynamic like?

[27:07] And how is it different?

[27:08] And why do you feel like you guys thrive?

[27:12] We sit out, solve a different problem with our relationship.

[27:17] And so I think that the premise that most people

[27:19] come into the relationship with is different

[27:20] than how Laila and I approach the relationship.

[27:22] And I think that's where I think fundamentally,

[27:24] like when you're solving a business problem,

[27:26] I'm sure you've probably asked this,

[27:27] this is like what problem are we solving?

[27:28] It's like the first question you asked is

[27:30] what problem are we solving?

[27:31] And so most people don't even ask that,

[27:33] the B if they do ask that,

[27:36] they're usually trying to solve a different thing.

[27:37] They're like, I want to have lots of romance

[27:40] and this big Hollywood love,

[27:43] which from everything that I know is something

[27:46] that is short-lived and then disappears

[27:49] and then you're left with someone

[27:50] that you're looking at and you're like,

[27:51] well, shit, what do we have in comment?

[27:53] And so Laila and I had both rode that roller coaster,

[27:57] multiple times before and we both were at a point

[27:59] where we were like, you know what?

[28:01] And mind you, I was very, you know,

[28:03] dejected at the time when I met her.

[28:04] I was like, listen, I'm not trying to do anything.

[28:06] I'm trying to build this, this is what I'm doing.

[28:08] And the first 30 dates we had were 30 days in a row

[28:12] where after our first date,

[28:14] which we went to Frozen Yogurt,

[28:16] the next date was not a date,

[28:17] I was like, I'm gonna be working from nine until I go to sleep.

[28:20] So if you wanna work with me, you can.

[28:24] And so that was what we did every single day

[28:27] is that I was like, I'm gonna be working,

[28:29] if you've got work, we can work together.

[28:31] And so it ended up just being somebody

[28:32] that I enjoyed spending a lot of time with.

[28:34] And the romance stuff, honestly,

[28:36] I feel like didn't really like kick in

[28:38] until like two and a half years into our marriage.

[28:40] And I think that our relationship was based on that.

[28:44] Like respect was first.

[28:46] And then we learned the love part.

[28:48] It's very hard to learn respect.

[28:50] Being hot or being physically attracted to somebody,

[28:52] I feel like it's the ticket of entry.

[28:54] It's not like I see a lot of successful guys

[28:57] go find the Instagram model.

[29:00] I meet said Instagram model.

[29:01] And I'm like, how do you live like this?

[29:03] Like I would kill myself if I had to talk to this person

[29:06] every day.

[29:07] They're like, oh, the secret is that I don't talk to.

[29:08] I'm like, that sounds horrible.

[29:10] And so again, it's like they were solving a different problem.

[29:13] And so for me, my goal has always been number one.

[29:18] Like where I wanna go, right?

[29:20] And having somebody who wants to go that way with you

[29:24] because I was engaged prior to Laila, right?

[29:27] Wonderful girl.

[29:29] But we ultimately ended up deciding to cut it off

[29:31] because we simply had different goals for our lives.

[29:34] She was like, I wanna do this.

[29:35] And I was like, I don't wanna do that.

[29:36] And it was like, what are you gonna do?

[29:39] And if like, maybe you're a great person

[29:41] and I'm a great person,

[29:42] we're just not necessarily like meant to be.

[29:44] And that's okay.

[29:45] Cause I think on some level,

[29:46] we say these things like non-agosibles,

[29:48] but then we negotiate.

[29:50] And so it's like, either it's a non-agosible

[29:52] or it isn't a negotiable.

[29:53] And for me, it's like where I wanna go

[29:54] is non-agosibles.

[29:55] So it's like, I have these goals,

[29:56] which is where I wanna go, my values,

[29:58] which is how I wanna get there.

[30:00] And then lifestyle, which is what are my interests?

[30:02] Right?

[30:02] And if I can find somebody wants to go the same place,

[30:04] the same way and have and likes doing the day-to-day

[30:07] the same way as me, then I'm good.

[30:09] Like the fact that Laila was in a fitness was like,

[30:11] great, I go the gym too.

[30:12] You go to the gym.

[30:13] It's not gonna be weird.

[30:13] I wanna be like, oh, I don't wanna, you know,

[30:15] like she's in the same mindset of that, right?

[30:17] If I'm like, hey, I wanna go invest in this workshop

[30:20] or something.

[30:21] She's not gonna be like, I can't believe we're spending

[30:22] $10,000 on this.

[30:23] It's like, that person who say that is not my partner.

[30:28] And I think in terms of me being the guy

[30:31] telling you what like the number one thing

[30:33] that attracted me about Laila was that Laila

[30:36] never tried to change me.

[30:37] If you wanna do big things, then whoever is going to come

[30:41] along with you has to be equally big as a person.

[30:45] And I think a lot of people settle for $45,000 employee.

[30:51] I mean, and you can even, if someone,

[30:52] yeah, in the reverse if I were you

[30:54] and someone's like, man, I'm looking for a wife

[30:56] and I be like, what are you looking for out of wife?

[30:57] Like, real talk, like, not politically correct,

[30:59] like what are you actually looking for?

[31:01] And so then, if they're like, man, I would love it

[31:03] someone cooked and cleaned and fed me and washed my clothes

[31:06] and ironed and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, you're like,

[31:07] okay, question, if I paid someone $45,000

[31:11] you're to do that professionally,

[31:14] then what would our relationship pay?

[31:17] Because that's an expense.

[31:19] You know what I mean?

[31:19] Like, we could just write the check

[31:20] and like all those things are solved.

[31:22] So like, now what?

[31:25] Andy, what's up, man?

[31:27] What is up, Mr. Alex Hermosie?

[31:29] Okay, so question I have for you.

[31:31] I've heard you talk a lot about investing in the S&P me

[31:34] and said the S&P index, like the me, the 100, right?

[31:37] What would you say with those skill acquisitions,

[31:39] like which skills and then what order would you suggest

[31:42] maybe a person to go through?

[31:43] Because that kind of ties into your skill stacking

[31:45] is a mathematical way that you think

[31:47] this naturally ascends to the next one.

[31:49] I would think about it from the order

[31:50] of how you would actually make money.

[31:52] So it's like, well, I have to have something to sell, right?

[31:56] So you have to have some sort of base skill

[31:57] that you could sell if you're gonna get into services

[31:59] or have some sort of base product, right?

[32:01] Once you know how to do that,

[32:03] so like if you're getting any commerce,

[32:04] you have to build a store, talk to manufacturers,

[32:07] make the thing that you're gonna sell,

[32:09] step one, on the service side,

[32:10] it'd be like what's the key skill that I'm gonna acquire

[32:13] to show people how to do it?

[32:14] And you can acquire that skill by like working a job,

[32:17] buying a certification, going through a course,

[32:19] going to a workshop, like I learned how to run a Facebook guide

[32:22] that it workshop.

[32:23] You didn't mean to cost me three grand

[32:25] and the other workshop and you had to run Facebook ads.

[32:27] And so, and that $3,000 has made me

[32:30] many more than $3,000 over the rest of my career.

[32:32] So, point being, first thing you start with the thing, right?

[32:36] The second thing you're gonna do is,

[32:37] you have to focus on promotion.

[32:39] So it's gonna be advertising.

[32:40] And if you think about this, this is the order I did the books, right?

[32:43] Offers is what answers the question, what do I sell?

[32:45] And leads answers the question, who do I sell it to?

[32:48] Right? So like once you have the thing,

[32:49] then you gotta go sell the thing

[32:51] and let people know about it and you have to advertise.

[32:53] And so that is, that would be the second big skill stack.

[32:56] The third one would be conversion,

[32:58] which is like kind of persuasions of sales.

[33:00] And there's different ways you can do it.

[33:02] So like you could learn how to build,

[33:03] be you know, shopping pages and e-commerce that convert,

[33:05] you could take phone sales,

[33:06] you could learn how to pitch and make VSLs.

[33:08] All of those things.

[33:09] And then finally, if you wanna learn,

[33:11] the next piece would be leadership and operations

[33:13] because then you're gonna have to hire people to help you out.

[33:15] With the cover of people you work with

[33:17] and the different levels of threat has there been anything

[33:19] that you would say maybe is the common one or two missing

[33:21] principles that most business owners are not doing.

[33:25] Or if it's maybe questions that they're not quite asking

[33:27] that you see like, sometimes if you're

[33:29] gonna do like the one or two things,

[33:31] not that they're not all the other.

[33:32] What are they?

[33:33] Yeah, so I just say to tweet the other day,

[33:34] but like the difference between, you know,

[33:36] a thousand and a million is skills, right?

[33:39] The difference between a million and a hundred million

[33:42] is character.

[33:43] difference between a hundred million and a billion

[33:45] in my opinion, we'll see if it works is time.

[33:48] And so once you have the base skills,

[33:51] then it's really becomes about who the person is.

[33:53] And so as you scale up, the speed of scaling

[33:58] often correlates with the speed of talent recruitment.

[34:01] Because if you are a shitty person or a shitty boss

[34:04] or a bad leader or can't have cast a vision

[34:05] or can't explain why this is gonna benefit a lot of people,

[34:07] not just inside the business, but also outside the business.

[34:10] Then you're not gonna get the best people.

[34:11] And if you don't have the best people,

[34:12] you have to work over time.

[34:13] And then you never really able to pull yourself out of the business.

[34:15] And so you can measure the size and the scalability

[34:19] of the company by the talent that they can attract.

[34:22] Like there's a reason that Google and meta and Goldman Sachs

[34:26] and all of these ones pool from all the Harvard,

[34:28] all the Ivy League schools and all that stuff.

[34:30] And we make fun of those people,

[34:32] but they also make all of the money.

[34:34] And so it's because they have a brand

[34:37] and they have a huge pipeline of training

[34:40] that they train people on.

[34:41] And people also know that when they go to that brand,

[34:43] Goldman Sachs, begins you whatever,

[34:45] that they're gonna be able to go

[34:46] and do whatever they want afterwards.

[34:47] And so like what happens is you realize

[34:49] that there's a two-sided funnel, right?

[34:51] So on one side, you have to learn how to attract customers.

[34:54] But on the other side, you have to learn how to attract talent.

[34:57] Because if you just only know how to attract customers,

[34:59] then everything always breaks

[35:00] and you can never get over the hump

[35:02] and you can never scale.

[35:03] Brilliant.

[35:04] Brilliant.

[35:05] Goodman.

[35:06] Well man, thank you for reaching back

[35:08] and helping all of us go forward

[35:10] and taking the shortcut.

[35:14] How would you approach creating strategies

[35:16] to generate leads and cultivate

[35:19] in during customer relationships

[35:20] in this rapidly evolving enterprise,

[35:23] be it a be landscape?

[35:24] Right, when I say enterprise,

[35:25] let me clarify, I'm speaking to Fortune 500,

[35:29] global 2000 type organizations.

[35:31] I'll tell you two very different things.

[35:34] On one hand, I've got a buddy who sells only to Fortune 100.

[35:38] And he was telling me that one of the most profitable strategies

[35:41] was hiring people from the Fortune 100

[35:44] in the departments that they're trying to get on board.

[35:48] And then they hire them and they already have

[35:50] all the sway, all the influence, all the know,

[35:53] all the know-how, and then they can bring that account with them.

[35:56] And then the majority of their revenue

[35:59] actually just comes from cross-selling

[36:01] all the different markets that those people are at.

[36:04] So it's like, okay, I had to start with Google,

[36:07] Southwest, whatever, right?

[36:09] And then I'm moving on to Google, Mexico,

[36:11] Google, Latam, or whatever, right?

[36:14] And so there's are the two biggest areas

[36:15] of expansion from that perspective.

[36:17] In terms of the lead-gent, like,

[36:20] I don't think the lead-gent really changes very much.

[36:22] I think more or less it's just how quickly

[36:24] can I involve as many stakeholders as possible

[36:26] and make sure that my pitches oriented to them looking good

[36:30] and them having no risk in terms of their job.

[36:33] It's like, here's my path to you getting promoted

[36:36] and arrays and here's no downside.

[36:39] Like it's all about them, you know what I mean?

[36:40] But I think part of it is like,

[36:42] and I'm assuming you're a leader in the company.

[36:45] Yeah.

[36:46] I think a lot of it is really getting

[36:47] the commission breath out of the sales guys.

[36:51] And oh, this is like, I'm getting in the tactics,

[36:54] but I love the term Bam Bam, right?

[36:58] Book of Meeting from a meeting,

[36:59] which is that we never have anyone falling through the cracks.

[37:02] Like we always know what we're doing to move the ball forward

[37:05] and I think some guys get tired or they,

[37:08] I don't always say lazy, but like they get tired.

[37:10] And they're like, yeah, I'm waiting for a response from that.

[37:12] It's like, well, when are you meeting with them?

[37:13] I'm like, well, I'm waiting for the response.

[37:16] It's like, if you're not able to push the ball forward

[37:18] from one meeting to the next, like that, in my opinion is a loss.

[37:21] Like, that's like a missale.

[37:23] Even though maybe you could save it,

[37:25] but you can dramatically decrease the pipeline

[37:28] because even setting the frame with the enterprise sale

[37:32] of listen, normal enterprise sales take 12 months,

[37:36] 18 months, six months, depending on the thing

[37:37] that you're selling.

[37:38] If you explain to the prospect you're like, listen,

[37:40] it actually doesn't take 12 months, it takes 48 hours.

[37:45] hours of work, not time.

[37:47] So if we have 48 one hour meetings to get this done,

[37:52] we can just take that and we can stretch it over two years.

[37:55] Or we can do it in three months.

[37:57] It's really up to you.

[37:59] And I think even just setting that breaks a little bit

[38:01] of the like, this feels fast, kind of language

[38:04] that a lot of like more corporate people will use.

[38:06] And then making sure that the bean counters

[38:08] who are approving budget, like, I'm spin-roll.

[38:13] That their asses are covered, and that they can look good.

[38:17] Yeah, I'm for sure no, it's all good feedback, my friend.

[38:19] So I just quick follow up question,

[38:21] and I'll let you go regarding lead gen, specific companies

[38:25] compete against your very familiar with McKinsey, Boston,

[38:27] et cetera, right?

[38:29] Seems like a lot of the lead gen is based on content,

[38:32] specifically gated content.

[38:34] And part of your value equation that I really like

[38:37] is value on the front end, which is kind of difficult

[38:40] at the enterprise level.

[38:41] Any thoughts there moving forward?

[38:44] Is that you see that kind of staying the same?

[38:46] Maintain that?

[38:47] I think that's 100%.

[38:48] Yeah, I mean, I think it's the same reason McKinsey, for example,

[38:50] puts out all those white papers in Goldman Sachs,

[38:52] but all their industry analysis out, right?

[38:54] And you opt in and you get it, and then they'll follow up with you.

[38:56] And I think, I mean, in my opinion,

[38:58] this may be an oversimplification, but I'm a simple guy.

[39:01] Like, I'll get the name from anywhere in the org

[39:04] that downloads the thing that's valuable for them.

[39:07] And then that's where the scripting comes in of the judo

[39:10] of, like, how you got this thing?

[39:11] What do you get in this thing for?

[39:12] Well, while we're working on this initiative, whatever,

[39:14] it's like, well, like, what's, you know,

[39:16] you get in a sit, like, you get in a sit.

[39:17] Like, what's the objective?

[39:18] What are you guys trying to do?

[39:19] Cool.

[39:20] And then you start moving away through the org.

[39:21] So I want to pull the thread from wherever I can.

[39:25] I'm sorry, get the thread, and then just start pulling my way.

[39:29] No, that's that's great stuff, man.

[39:30] I really appreciate it looking forward

[39:32] to the new release on Saturday, man.

[39:34] Thanks, but appreciate your job.

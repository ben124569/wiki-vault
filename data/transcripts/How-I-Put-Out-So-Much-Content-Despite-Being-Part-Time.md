[00:00] Are you struggling to make content that rocks?

[00:02] Well, I did too, and I made this crazy video without talking myself into a tree with this crazy background.

[00:08] On how to actually fix this.

[00:10] So I was actually asked to speak at a seven figure entrepreneur event.

[00:13] It was a paid event.

[00:14] And one of the questions that came up that I was told the answer that I had was impactful for many of them.

[00:20] Was it around the concept of content?

[00:22] And if you don't know who I am, my name is Oxmozi, I own Acquisition.com.

[00:25] It's a portfolio company that is about $85 million here.

[00:27] All right, so this is an excerpt of the video of me answering that question.

[00:31] If you're struggling to make content, enjoy this.

[00:34] What is the best way to create content?

[00:38] I know it's not specific enough.

[00:40] I'm not the best type of it.

[00:41] So I really love what you guys are putting out right now.

[00:44] Seriously, straight fire, both of you guys, good old.

[00:50] And maybe I'm just stuck in my head, but I'm having difficulty just putting it out there.

[00:56] I know I could talk for hours on any topic, fitness, business life, whatever.

[01:00] And I do with my friends consistently all day.

[01:02] But when I get in front and I'm like, what's the fuck do I make?

[01:05] Excuse the language.

[01:06] I'm like, what do I make?

[01:07] How do I structure this?

[01:08] How should I say this?

[01:09] And another guy, ah, that's what happens.

[01:12] So I've done it.

[01:14] And I'm not sure if it's just like I've done it so much now that I, I also, I'm looking more

[01:19] so on for my end to like work with people who want to perform better, who don't just want to lose a little bit of a who really want to

[01:26] be you know, legit better version of themselves.

[01:29] You know, I know that's probably you is consistently across the fitness industry.

[01:33] But like that's genuinely what I want to help you with it.

[01:36] I want them help like you hit that potential because I, that's what I like doing for myself.

[01:40] So that's my like question there.

[01:42] I can do like I probably struggle more with content creation than Alex hasn't in a while now.

[01:47] So maybe I could talk about that.

[01:48] Well, he's like Alex creates better content for me.

[01:50] Like I think that he's been doing this for like, fucking eight years.

[01:53] I started like six months ago.

[01:55] And every time I'm like, dude, I look like shit, I feel like shit, this terrible, it's awful.

[01:59] You know, that's all I say.

[02:00] Like I'm like, look, everyone hates me like for sure they're bad.

[02:04] What Alex is like, I observe Alex and a lot of times like I'll literally take notes on his videos and deconstruct these doing.

[02:09] So I think he's really good at it, right?

[02:11] And I'll watch him while he's creating and I'm sat there when he's coming up with videos.

[02:14] And there's two things that I identify that help me a lot, which is one, Alex is really sure about who he's talking to.

[02:19] And he knows every time he's talking.

[02:21] Okay.

[02:22] So then when I'm talking, like who am I talking to?

[02:24] And a lot of the times the things that probably inspire you, friends, are like about the clients.

[02:29] So like a lot of the times when I just made like a really good piece of content the other day,

[02:33] because I got off the phone with a company that we have in more invested with.

[02:37] And I was like, I had this to pick me on the phone with them and I was ranting and I just thought and went and made the content.

[02:41] I see Alex do all the time.

[02:42] He's like, I got it.

[02:43] I got to go make it now.

[02:44] And I think it's really hard because like I never believed Alex in the beginning where he's like,

[02:47] no, you just gotta like catch it when you get it.

[02:49] You gotta go like make like six videos.

[02:50] And I was like, dude, no, I like organized my whole schedule.

[02:52] I set time side.

[02:53] I need to film now.

[02:54] But it's almost like a self-inflicted pressure when you like set that time sometimes.

[02:59] And then you just start getting your head.

[03:00] You're like, I must make five pieces of content right now.

[03:04] And I'm not.

[03:05] So I must fucking suck, right?

[03:07] And instead it's just like you're just not in zone because creativity isn't like constraints.

[03:12] So it's like you have to catch like when the creativity's there when you're less constrained and you're more free flowing.

[03:17] I think that's one thing's from most carefully.

[03:19] That plus knowing who you're talking to.

[03:22] And then the other thing I'll say is, I don't think that you should be content on anything you don't want to make content on.

[03:28] Which I've heard Alex say a million times when it's because he's I know I asked him for advice on it a lot right now.

[03:33] So I feel like I can say this to you because I've been asking Alex a lot of questions.

[03:37] And he's like, dude, don't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.

[03:40] And sometimes make the content that you want to make even though you don't you're not sure.

[03:45] Look it.

[03:45] Like there are certain videos that I've made like on how to have run a great meeting.

[03:49] And my YouTube guys like you don't need to get some fuck and I was like, I don't care.

[03:52] I need to make this video like for me, I know it's fucking important right.

[03:56] And so I think it's allowing yourself to just do whatever the fucking want kind of makes it better.

[04:02] And you hear Alex's videos, they do it.

[04:04] I'm not making this for you guys.

[04:05] And he's serious. He's making it for himself.

[04:07] And so I think um, you know, I I observe that and I'm like, that's how I feel like, I mean Alex,

[04:13] you know, I'm just speaking for you.

[04:13] But I feel like that's how you've been able to continue to make content as your wife who watches you and sees you at all time.

[04:18] Like you do, you make a lot for yourself.

[04:20] You make a lot for the people that you know who they are and who you're talking to.

[04:23] And if you don't feel like making it, you don't do it.

[04:26] I make videos for really only one of two reasons.

[04:29] One is because I want to document a thought process.

[04:31] So that means it's for me or it's fresh off of some sort of conversation I had with, you know,

[04:36] a client employee or one of the, you know, the business owners that they were invested in.

[04:40] And so I'm basically making it for them and I just make it anonymous.

[04:44] And usually I'm very passionate about the topic which why I want to make the video.

[04:48] But I heard this for I'm a brand cardoon and when we were talking about his content strategy.

[04:55] And he said, you just got to make shit and you have to assume no one will see it.

[05:01] Like the assumption is zero and then just make all your content from that perspective.

[05:05] Because the thing is is like you guys have heard me say this, but like the work works on you more than you work on it.

[05:09] And doing the content is a long play.

[05:12] It's a super, super long play.

[05:15] And unfortunately, it takes a long time to be good for two reasons.

[05:19] One is that you actually have to be good at doing it, which you will get better with repetition.

[05:23] And the second is that people don't care about you until you've done something.

[05:28] Like if I tweeted the same shit Elon Musk tweets, no one would care.

[05:32] But it's Elon Musk and so he's the richest man in the world.

[05:35] And if he just does a poop emoji, he gets shared, you know, 500,000 times.

[05:40] It's not because the message, because of the mess and juror and the mess and juror is a big part

[05:44] of the message.

[05:46] Part of the reason the content doesn't hit even if it's really wonderful content is because

[05:50] people are like why should I listen to you?

[05:52] And if you don't have a genuine answer for that, then they won't have one either.

[05:56] My views on content have shifted dramatically over time.

[05:59] But I think the reason that the content that I have now hits is because like we've made a lot of

[06:03] fucking money.

[06:04] And people are like, wow, that's impressive.

[06:07] When I started, I wasn't as big on content because, honestly, it was like, I just don't think anyone was going to give a shit.

[06:13] And they probably weren't.

[06:15] And so like, I'm just adding those as quick caveats, but for you specifically, what you don't want to do

[06:21] is start talking like everyone else.

[06:23] Right?

[06:23] Don't talk about when they should time their carbs.

[06:26] Don't talk about how they should be more splitting up like no one cares.

[06:30] If you're talking to your specific avatar, then the types of things that you should be making should

[06:35] be relevant to that specific avatar, which oftentimes will be different than when everyone

[06:39] else is talking about.

[06:40] And it'll be unique to you.

[06:42] That's kind of my, my big picture stuff on on on content creation.

[06:46] But I put two notes in there, which is like, do it when it's fresh and do it when you feel emotions.

[06:51] Those have been like kind of two of my, my mainstays for making content.

[06:55] I often feel the way that what you've talked about is like, I haven't done shit yet.

[07:01] Like, I like why you're right.

[07:03] Like, so I'm almost in that same point with business.

[07:05] And I feel it with being online, the difference between being and being in gym and being online

[07:10] is, you know, online is the same.

[07:11] I think working with the online coaches is the same thing is like, why should I work with you?

[07:16] You know, what have you done, right?

[07:18] So that's kind of my next follow up question.

[07:21] It's actually second basis.

[07:22] It will fly a set of quick.

[07:23] What is the best way to generate those type of leads when, you know, you haven't done shit?

[07:28] Like, I hadn't the job done shit.

[07:30] What the thing is is, okay, this is a really, I think this is a good to have you out for everyone.

[07:35] Everyone here is done shit, but not everyone here is done shit that they want to talk about.

[07:40] So this is the classic example of the dudes who were talking about how to make passive income online,

[07:46] make 10 grand a month, and they've never fucking made 10 grand a month and they're talking about how to

[07:50] manipulate the stock market and their stock portfolio is 100 grand.

[07:53] Like who gives a shit, right?

[07:54] Like you're not Warren Buffett, right?

[07:57] But the thing is is that you are at expert at some things and you should just stick to only talking about that stuff.

[08:04] If the source of your content, this is like, I'm going to disus fucking big.

[08:09] If the source of your content is other people's content, don't make it.

[08:16] What makes content interesting is the unique anecdotes that you have experienced in gone through,

[08:21] which add value.

[08:23] And this is kind of a big issue in general with the, like, the content creation world,

[08:27] is that people are making content because it's easy to make content and because they have an

[08:33] alternative agenda.

[08:34] The content that hits is content that is made for its own sake, as with the intention of adding

[08:41] to the body of knowledge on a specific subject matter.

[08:45] And so if you have been working with clients and you're like, this is something that's worked

[08:50] really well for the guys that I have. I only have seven clients, but like, this is worked really well.

[08:54] I hope it works well for you.

[08:55] You say that, you have domain expertise in those seven clients and no one can question you there.

[09:02] Now, if you start talking about science and you don't fucking know anything about science,

[09:05] but you read it on Mike's reatteller, you read it from Dr. Cashie.

[09:09] You're not Dr. Cashie. And so of course, like, it's not going to sound as good from you.

[09:13] And if I'm going to try and listen to that, I'm listening to Dr. Cash.

[09:15] And so it's like, we have to know what we are experts in.

[09:19] Like, I'm only a little bit talking about investments stuff now, but for the vast majority of the stuff

[09:23] I talk about, I talk about sales, I talk about acquisition, and it's because we built it for six

[09:28] different companies and we've exited six different companies. You know, 10 years, right?

[09:33] And different types of companies, right? Software, we've exited brick and mortar, we've done

[09:37] service business, like we've done different types of things. And so I can speak about that with authority

[09:41] and people know that. And then I have a story to back that up. When you just talk about content,

[09:46] no one cares. And so, tied to stuff that you actually know, and one of my last rules of content is,

[09:51] if you don't have anything worth saying, don't say it. And I know this is probably a little

[09:57] contrary to other people's stuff, but I don't really give a shit. Like, if it's not worth saying,

[10:01] don't say it because in my opinion, I'd rather have someone not consumed shit for me than consume

[10:06] something and then decide to never listen to me ever again because there's a waste of their time.

[10:09] That's my content. Drop. So that piece that I just said, that probably was a piece of content that we

[10:13] probably could play. All right, that helped very much. So thank you guys so much. Five.

[10:20] And if you have specific, and this is a side note for tactics, right? If you have a handful of

[10:25] specific beliefs that people are trying to overcome, rather than necessarily addressing the belief,

[10:29] you can make it relevant by saying, hey, if you're struggling with this, my client,

[10:33] Karen, and then all of a sudden you have domain authority because you're now introducing a real story,

[10:38] rather than just saying, here's how you overcome overeating. Now, I have two clients. I won't,

[10:44] I'll just use Sarah and Kate as the name for these are real clients that are on my roster right now.

[10:47] And this is the issue that we're struggling with. This is how we dealt with it. And I'm going to say

[10:51] one more piece on this content thing because I think it's, it's also, like I've learned a lot of

[10:54] things over this. Is that you don't want to make declarative statements. You want to say, this is the

[11:00] way it is. This is very easy to contradict that. Instead, it's, this is my two cents. This is how I see

[11:07] the world and what I have experienced. I might not know shit, but I'm sharing what has been

[11:11] diable to me and my clients. And when you stay it from that perspective, one of the intention is

[11:15] pure and two, no one can fuck with you on that. Because you're, you're not saying this is,

[11:19] you're not saying this is fact. You're saying this is, this is how I see it. And if things change,

[11:23] I'll tell you how, how I think they've changed. That's really dope. And it's also a super unique because

[11:28] it's like, it's your experience, right? So it has to wildly different than everyone else's or at least someone.

[11:33] Yeah, step one do stuff. And then step two talk about the stuff you did. Right? The problem is that

[11:37] people start talking about stuff they haven't done. And then that's where they get in trouble.

[11:41] Because all they do is they read someone else's article on passive income. And then they do a

[11:44] worse deluded version with less authority.

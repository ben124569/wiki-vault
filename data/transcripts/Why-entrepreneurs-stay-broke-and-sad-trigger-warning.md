[00:00] What's going on with the nation in this video?

[00:02] This is a hot take that I had when I was very, very fed up with the amount of people who are failing at life and business.

[00:10] And this is one of the top 300 videos that I released into a private community that I had for three or four years that were not public.

[00:19] And so I wanted to share kind of the best of that community.

[00:23] And this one was entitled, I have the Tiger and Sustained Victory.

[00:27] And it was I think a mindset, mindset and perspective shift that will provide significant value to you.

[00:34] And I think it will be worth the investment of time to get the return from it.

[00:40] And so if you're new to the channel, by the way, my name is Alchromozi.

[00:43] I would have position.com.

[00:44] It's a portfolio of companies that is about 85 million dollars a year.

[00:47] All right, so I make this channel and I make these videos because a lot of people broke and I don't want to be on them.

[00:51] And so that is why I'm trying to share the lessons in the failure.

[00:53] So we've had to get to this point because I think that a lot of people can be more successful.

[00:58] If they just had a couple of different tools and frameworks to see the world.

[01:01] So lots of love and enjoy the video.

[01:04] What I wanted to talk to you about is I have the Tiger.

[01:07] So I just had our like a three day match in my type thing with the top seller.

[01:12] So two or three gyms who came here were over seven figures and the other one is going to probably hit it within the next very months.

[01:18] So it was really, it was great because it was a really higher level conversation that I might typically have with

[01:23] a much better experience which is fun.

[01:24] What we talked about was kind of more amorphous but I think it's incredibly valuable and I think it's probably the one thing that sets apart the guys who are really winners, slash gals,

[01:32] who are really winners and the ones who are.

[01:34] And so it's really just around hunger.

[01:36] What I mean by that is recently I had some of our older OG gym boards who's been a while, you know, I mean they they they they turn their gym around, they throw,

[01:46] they're at you know, close to seven figures or right around there and they've been doing it for a while.

[01:50] And they were complaining about show rates they're like, yeah, our show rates are low.

[01:54] And you know, you go through the same way you do in the reminders you do all this above like, yeah, we're doing all this up.

[01:59] Okay, cool. And I did a little bit deeper and I look and it turns out that they're only open one hour per day at seven 15 a.m.

[02:09] for their availability for new clients.

[02:12] And I'm like, how the fuck do you think that you're going to grow your business?

[02:17] If the only time that you can take new customers is at seven 15 a.m. in what world does that make sense, right?

[02:24] Like imagine a grocery store that's only open from seven to seven 30 because that's when it's convenient for the owner.

[02:29] What chance do you think that that grocery store has at succeeding virtually none?

[02:35] And so what happens is people have success.

[02:39] They implement tactics. They use gym watch and then they make money, right?

[02:43] And then what happens? They get comfortable. They get complacent, right?

[02:47] And they lose their hunger. Like after that point, everything like I'd almost like, I must say like,

[02:52] after you like quote made it in your mind and that's what's funny is that making in some people's mind is like,

[02:58] having 10 grand in the back. So like it's scary in terms of what level of making it is.

[03:02] But like once people have made it, I almost want to say like none of these tactics matter

[03:06] because you're just not hungry. Like it doesn't matter. Like the obvious shit you aren't doing.

[03:12] You know what I mean? If you're a child, was going to die or you're spouse or you're

[03:16] sitting together, your family member, whatever it was, was going to die unless you succeeded,

[03:21] unless you've got more clients, unless you've made more money with your gym.

[03:24] How would you approach it, right? Would you only be able to be able to be available for one hour a day?

[03:30] Would you only be available from seven to eight a.m. Would you only set aside an hour a day to

[03:34] prosper for new customers? Would you only reach out to your, your customers or they hadn't shown up for a month?

[03:39] Sometimes people ask questions that they already know the answer to. It's like, duh, no shit, right?

[03:45] And it goes back to the main thing which is like, what drives you? What drives you? What drives you

[03:52] to be better? What drives you to continue to want to win? I was asked that question yesterday

[03:57] by the gym owners that were here. And I think honestly, it comes from a dark place. And I think

[04:02] I've said this before. But like, I'm saying it again because I think people need to hear it.

[04:06] Sometimes you have to wonder, like, why is it that only when someone else's life is on the line?

[04:12] Do you then actually try, right? Like, why is it only then you actually cut all the noise out of your life?

[04:18] And then it would go laser focused on actually succeeding. Like, why can't we do that all the time?

[04:25] Like, why can't we do that? Because it's like, well, then I would be happy, whatever happens,

[04:31] and so the people who are the most successful in the world are driven by something that is deep inside

[04:36] of them that is normally an insecurity or a fear of some sort. If you are only trying to make

[04:43] enough to live on, you will always only make enough to live on. And you will slack the moment you get

[04:50] comfortable and you will wonder, why is it that as soon as I start making money, I stop because you

[04:56] actually don't want to make money. That's why you actually don't want to make money. And so

[05:02] your internal motivation is not there, like, because you've accomplished what you set out to accomplish.

[05:08] The real question is, do you actually want what you claimed to want? Do you actually want it?

[05:12] Because if you did, you'd already have it. You'd already, you'd already be willing to sacrifice

[05:16] other things in order to achieve it. And that might mean like maybe waking up earlier. Maybe you

[05:20] like working for an APM to take sales appointments or whatever that thing is. It's just the obvious

[05:27] shit. Like if you were coaching you, what would you recommend you to do? Like a lot of times,

[05:32] if you think about it, like you most of the time know what to do. Like you do, on some level,

[05:40] like you probably know that you're like, man, I do stupid shit sometimes. You probably think that

[05:43] on some level sometimes, right? They know like, man, if I were, if you were step out of yourself

[05:48] and say, I need to coach myself, you probably have the answer. And it's just that you don't do it

[05:54] for some reason. And so all of your attention should be on that reason. Why is it that this thing

[06:00] is preventive me from doing the things that I already know I should do? Like this last

[06:03] last time I that I had served for the top sellers was really interesting for me because there's

[06:07] a first time that I had no one who had extra shit. I didn't have any like, everyone there had

[06:13] really like clean lives outside like really focused and just focused on doing the things that

[06:18] were going to grow the business. The conversations are actually really easy and very direct.

[06:22] Most times it's like, okay, well, here's the obvious hole in your business, but you're not doing

[06:28] anything about it. So let's attack why you're not doing anything about it, right? And so then I have

[06:33] to spend the next hour and a half digging into why they're not doing anything about it, which has

[06:37] much more to do with how they manage their headspace and how they manage their relationships

[06:41] and how they manage their, you know, and because what ends up happening is they start focusing on

[06:44] the business, the personal life goes to shambles. They then are like, oh my gosh, my personal life is

[06:49] going to shambles. I need to stop paying attention to my business. They go to pay attention to the

[06:53] personal life and then they're going to jump into the right. It's just this consistent cycle because

[06:57] they just don't know how to do both or they don't know how to prioritize this. All this to say like,

[07:04] it's just like, how hungry are you? Like how willing are you to put in what you need to

[07:08] achieve? Like, and if you're not, then that's cool. Then just to stop, stop saying you want it.

[07:12] You know, I mean, just be like, I only want to make $10,000. That's it. It's like cool.

[07:18] Then just say that and be good with it rather than constantly complaining about how you're not

[07:22] because you're not even willing to do the things that you already know you should do. Like,

[07:27] right now, I get on the phone with a gentleman. I was like, I know I should work my lead starter.

[07:30] I know I know I should go through this sales training more. Like, I know I should, you know,

[07:34] go through the portal. I know I should meet with my team more. I know I should form it. Like,

[07:38] then why aren't you? Why aren't you? Why? Why? Why? Like, I know you have time because

[07:44] other people have time and have the same businesses. So you have time. So why aren't you? Because

[07:48] once you have the tactics, right? And this is one of the biggest, the freeing and also most

[07:53] sole crushing parts of gym lunch. Is that once, once a gym owner joins gym lunch,

[07:58] you know how to make a set figure, gentlemen. You know how to do it. And so then it reflects back

[08:03] onto you. It's like, oh shit. I'm the reason that we're not there. And you have to swallow that.

[08:10] Right? Because up until they go to gym lunch, people been doing it for five years or seven years,

[08:14] eight years. And they're like, I don't know how. And then once they see how, then they're like, oh shit,

[08:19] I'm not sure if I'm going to do that. It's like cool. Once they know that there is no secret,

[08:23] there is no hack. It's literally like, my grandfather's uses the term chopping wood. Like,

[08:27] I call it doing the boring work. It's like chopping wood. It's reps. It's day in, day out.

[08:32] You got to reach out to people. You got to give great service. Right? The handwritten cards. Like,

[08:36] remind people to weigh in. You have to work the leads. When the person comes in the door,

[08:40] you have to be enthusiastic. You got to agree with the smile. You have to ask the same questions

[08:44] over and over and over again. Because to that person is the first time they've ever heard.

[08:48] And it doesn't matter if it's the hundredth time that month, you asked the same questions to that

[08:53] person to that person's day one. And so if you were trying to be successful, do you think that only

[08:58] having a availability for sales appointments at 715 to 745 in the morning once a day,

[09:03] it's going to get you the optimal outcome. Do you need a coach to tell you that?

[09:08] Really? You know what I mean? Like, really. And so like, or, or there was another one that

[09:14] I saw that was like between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. that was their availability. Hmm. Good luck with that.

[09:20] That's when that's when the people who have the most money are available. Right? I do a

[09:24] during the week. We know what to do. Right? Anyone who's in our world, like, you know what to do.

[09:30] It's just, you have to figure out why you're not doing it. Right? And then tack that because the

[09:34] tactics aren't the thing anymore. Right? The tactics are there. You can read a book and keep it

[09:38] away for free. Right? Like, you can do that. Like, figure out why you're not hungry.

[09:43] Figure out why you're not trying. Like, just figure it out. Like, there might be something inside

[09:48] maybe you don't want more. And like, you need to discover that. It's like, okay, then like,

[09:53] now you know, but like, if you claim to want more and yet you can't do what's necessary to get more,

[10:00] then that's where your attention should go. And you should figure that out because otherwise,

[10:04] this doesn't matter what tactics there are. You're just not going to do them anyways. So what's

[10:08] the point? So anyways, it was incredibly refreshing to have the three guys who were out here.

[10:12] We had Ed Turnney, my great phone. So both of those guys have been over, you know, some figures

[10:17] remakes for a while and doing really, really well. Those guys were just like,

[10:21] what do I need to do? Like, because they're like, they're clear eyes, you know, toes forward,

[10:26] no exactly what to do. And I was like, why is it that these meetings are so much easier than

[10:29] some of the other meetings I had? And so we probably spent a little bit of the day kind of digging into

[10:34] that. And it's just a question about you want it. I really think that's it. And like figuring out why

[10:39] you're not doing what you already know you should do in order to achieve it. Like, do you need to

[10:44] go pay someone a bunch of money in order to then get motivated? I don't know. Like, hopefully your

[10:49] kid doesn't need to be kidnapped in order for you to get motivated by your business. Hopefully. Right?

[10:54] And so it's like, what is that thing? For me, it's just fear. It's just fear and insecurity. It's

[10:59] fear failing. Fear of not being good enough. Fear of people who hated to be right. You know what I mean?

[11:04] That's what my fear. And so I did just like, that's what drives me. It's not about money. It's

[11:08] like, it's like, it couldn't have been about money because I don't need any more for the rest of my

[11:11] life at all. So it's like, it's it can't be about that. But if it is like about that for you,

[11:15] you feel like when you make your first $20,000 take home once your first $40,000 take home once your first

[11:19] $50,000, $100,000 take home once. But first time you hit that, like, if that's where you're like,

[11:23] oh, you feel this big side relief, then your motivation is not coming from the right place. I'm telling

[11:28] you straight up, if you feel relief when you make a lot of money one month, your motivation is not coming

[11:34] from the place of the champion. If you want to be the best in the world of something, that's not going

[11:39] to do anything for you. You shouldn't feel anything from that. I feel nothing. Really, because it's not about

[11:47] that. That's just an output, that's an output for an internal efforts. And you should be focused

[11:53] more on the internal efforts and all of the deficiencies that you probably had in still hitting

[11:56] a hundred k. It's like, oh my gosh, if we hadn't done this, this and this, we would have been

[12:01] less, right? And if we had done this and this, we would have been more like that's what you're focusing on.

[12:05] And you're only focusing on those things. And if you can do that, then you'll be able to unlock

[12:10] something inside of you. That's much stronger than what might currently be driving you. Anyways,

[12:16] guys, we'll be having amazing Saturday drop a like if you feel like this is cool, drop a comment

[12:21] if you feel like it was cool. If you don't, then that's cool too. Anyways, that's have an amazing

[12:25] day. And I will catch you guys soon. Hopefully that was valuable for somebody who was on the fence,

[12:29] who's like, not sure about why I think I can't achieve what they want, why they can't be consistent,

[12:33] because your motivation's not coming from where it takes. Right? You're just trying to make enough money

[12:37] to live on. And the moment you make enough money, you stop working. And then you wait for things to

[12:42] blow up again until you try hard again. How many times, all right, I'm going on a second, a little

[12:47] rant, how many times have you needed to make money? And then immediately made the amount of money that

[12:51] you needed in like a day in like a week, right? You need to make pay real. I'm going to make 10 grand

[12:56] next three days. How many times has that happened to you? And you always make it work. Why? Because you

[13:03] already know what the fuck to do, right? You just choose not to do it. You choose not to do it. You

[13:09] choose not to make money when you know how to make money, because whenever you need to make money,

[13:12] you make it. And so that's what you have to attack. You have to figure out why when you've already

[13:17] know how to make money, you don't do it. That is the summary of this entire, this entire talk that

[13:21] I was trying to get out of myself is like, you already know how to do it. When you need to do it,

[13:26] you do do it. So why aren't you doing it? That is what you need to focus on. And if you can conquer

[13:32] that piece, no amount of money in the world will satisfy you. And that is what's going to unlock

[13:37] your ability to become greater and for you to build your business to something that is much bigger

[13:41] than yourself. Because if the only thing that you want to satisfy is you, you're going to state this

[13:46] small. You're going to say, this big, because it's out of five, a single person or a single family

[13:50] doesn't mean a lot, right? But if you want to satisfy a community, you want to satisfy state,

[13:54] you want to satisfy nation, you want to satisfy entire group of people that has to be bigger than you.

[14:00] And so yeah. So anyways, hopefully that might resonate with somebody, if it didn't, then I apologize

[14:06] for the extra aggressiveness on this Saturday morning. But anyways, double like drop comment and

[14:10] now let's go over on our next year's on the flip side. All right, rock.

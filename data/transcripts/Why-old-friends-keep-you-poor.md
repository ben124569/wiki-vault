[00:00] I have shed friends every season of my life.

[00:03] My close circle has always been very, very small, very, very small.

[00:08] Very, very small.

[00:09] Very small.

[00:10] Not exist.

[00:11] I also feel like I grow really quickly because I don't hold on to things long.

[00:16] The moment something doesn't provide me value, I shed it.

[00:19] I think about my life in three to five years seasons.

[00:22] First, I was a high school womanizer for the most part and then I was also like really

[00:27] deeply angry.

[00:28] I had high school friends that when I left high school, I basically stopped being in contact

[00:32] with them.

[00:33] Then I had my come to Jesus where my dad was like, you suck as human, you have terrible

[00:36] reputation.

[00:37] Maybe you should stop being who you are.

[00:38] Clean up my act, I stopped drinking nearly as much as I was.

[00:41] I started going to school and studying 12 hours a day, pressing the fraternity and that was

[00:44] my college season.

[00:45] I had college friends.

[00:46] Then when I left college, I pretty much stopped being in contact with anyone that I went to

[00:51] college with.

[00:52] Most people suck at most things and aren't bound for greatness because of who they are

[00:55] and the choices that they're willing to make.

[00:57] The story is about friends leaving the hometown and no longer remember where they're from

[01:02] is one that is told by society because society is the majority.

[01:06] The majority of people get left behind.

[01:08] If you look at the things that you want to get in life, there's a price for them.

[01:12] You don't buy everything you see in the mall, why not?

[01:14] Because you don't want to pay the price.

[01:16] Just because you might think that a shirt or jacket is cool, just because you think

[01:19] an outcome is awesome, you might not be willing to make the trade.

[01:22] Winners and losers have the same goals.

[01:24] The goal doesn't make you unique.

[01:26] It's the willingness to pay the price that makes you unique.

[01:28] Because I like everyone else to be rich.

[01:29] One of the reasons that I cut people out sooner than most is because I do not like the labels

[01:35] they speak over me.

[01:36] One of the big things with identity is the labels that we say about ourselves.

[01:40] I am ex.

[01:41] I am impatient.

[01:42] I am angry.

[01:43] I am whatever.

[01:44] I am poor.

[01:45] I'm like saying it.

[01:46] People in your past have the identity that they know you as and then they will speak and they

[01:51] will beat that label to you because you are not matching their pattern.

[01:55] Why have you changed?

[01:56] You are ex.

[01:57] You are y.

[01:58] And you are trying to not be that because you are doing something different than changing

[02:02] you are growing.

[02:03] But they see it as change.

[02:04] And that's why the best response in the world or someone who says, hey, you have changed.

[02:08] You have it.

[02:09] The amount you like or love someone is directly proportional to what you are willing to

[02:12] give up to maintain the relationship.

[02:14] For example, if there is a piece of shit car, you work on it all the time.

[02:17] You might say, that guy must really love it because of how much time you put into that

[02:21] thing.

[02:21] Okay, must really love his country because he is willing to give his life for it.

[02:25] What are you willing to give an exchange to maintain the relationship?

[02:27] If you are not willing to give up basically anything to maintain the relationship, then how

[02:32] much do you love him?

[02:33] I think it's been a very helpful filter for me to say, not do I love my friends, but

[02:37] which friends do I love the most?

[02:38] Which friends am I willing to sacrifice the most to keep the relationship?

[02:42] And I am a big believer in utility.

[02:43] There is an exchange never relationship.

[02:45] You get something and they get something back.

[02:47] People don't like the idea that relationships are transactional.

[02:51] They are transactional just has a commercial vibe to it.

[02:55] But if we just think about it as from a behavior standpoint, you've got two things that

[02:58] can happen.

[02:59] A behavior is reinforced or it is punished.

[03:02] That's it.

[03:03] When you have exchanges quite literally with people, those exchanges are either reinforced

[03:07] or they're punished.

[03:08] Part of the strength of the relationship is how long you're willing to wait for the next

[03:11] time that relationship is reinforced.

[03:13] If you have a long history of positive experiences to the person, you're willing to

[03:16] wait a longer period of time if they're going through a breakup, they're having

[03:19] a hard time to keep the relationship going.

[03:21] But at some point, even if you've been friends with so many for 10 years, if there's just

[03:24] not any positive reinforcement at some point, you do cut it off.

[03:29] The people who are surrounded with when we grow up, it's very unlikely just from a population

[03:33] standpoint that they're going to be great.

[03:35] Statistically that they're going to be the top 1% or 1% is unlikely.

[03:38] So it would make sense that you change your friends over time.

[03:41] Why do people get so weird about keeping relationship to them don't serve them?

[03:45] I think it's just because we have a societal story around it.

[03:47] That you're a bad friend, but I can also think of me being as a good friend to my next

[03:50] friend that I just made room for.

[03:52] There's going to be a friend who's going to move into my spot on my buddy's calendar

[03:56] who does want to do fantasy with both.

[03:57] Who does want to drink with him on Sunday so it's not this like, all right, I'll go to the

[04:00] game with you but I'm not drinking.

[04:01] Ah dude, you're not going to come on man.

[04:03] Because the other guy's like, yeah, shots all around.

[04:05] They're going to have a blast.

[04:06] They would better be served with people who want the same things to them.

[04:09] Just because I'm not seeing them anymore doesn't mean that I don't wish them well.

[04:14] But if someone only tells you the stories and when you got fucked up and what you did

[04:17] that stupid thing, they're encouraging and retelling in the story of who you used to

[04:21] be.

[04:22] And you want people around you who don't believe the lies you used to tell about yourself.

[04:26] The character trait shift is not a binary.

[04:29] It's how patient are you, how kind are you, how loyal are you, how honest are you.

[04:34] And so you want people who encourage you in the behaviors that you want to be like.

[04:38] And this is why like shedding identities is such a core part of entrepreneurship is that you

[04:42] have to be willing to say, I am no longer this way.

[04:45] I will no longer behave in this way.

[04:46] And I don't accept that reality is truth.

[04:49] Many of the people I had around me, a weren't willing to pay the price that I was willing

[04:52] to pay for the things that I wanted.

[04:54] But also wanted me to give them more than I was willing to.

[04:58] And so I'll give you a story that will paint me in a bad light.

[05:00] And that's fine.

[05:01] There was a teacher that I grew up with in high school.

[05:04] He used the one who stayed with me after school for a year and worked out with me.

[05:08] Towards the day and he taught me how to work out.

[05:10] I got a shape, got more confidence, better at school from there that's no balled into

[05:13] me getting the fitness huge catalyst snowball.

[05:16] Somebody heard that story and then found the teacher and they linked us.

[05:19] He was like, hey man, I'm not acid for a lot.

[05:21] I would love to just have like a two hour call every week.

[05:23] I was like a two hour call every week.

[05:26] I was like, I don't even talk my mother that much.

[05:29] I'm talking to anybody that much.

[05:30] It's like my wife that's it.

[05:31] The value of the relationship was in the past.

[05:33] Maybe like Alex, your horrible person.

[05:34] And that's possible.

[05:35] Maybe I was not willing to give two hours a week, a hundred hours a year for the rest of

[05:39] my life to pay a debt for somebody who works out with me.

[05:42] We only have so much juice.

[05:43] We only have so much time with so much focus, so much energy that we can pour into things.

[05:48] And if you're not putting all your energy in one direction, it's scattered and then you

[05:51] don't move this fast.

[05:52] My closest friend, I spend one hour a week with every week.

[05:55] My closest friend, like clockwork.

[05:57] It's my highest party meeting.

[05:58] It is something that brings me joy.

[06:00] And we get lots of exchange with one of their, he's the one who helps you write my

[06:02] book, Dr. Cassie here.

[06:04] I get a lot from that.

[06:05] Now if I didn't get anything from that, over time, slow down the communication between

[06:09] us.

[06:10] I would make it every other week once a month.

[06:11] If you slow down your communication case with someone, how frequently you see them and when

[06:14] you accept invitations, it naturally fizzles.

[06:17] But if you get to a point where someone's like so close that it would be obvious and a

[06:20] conversation needs to be had, I encourage you to just have it.

[06:23] You want to be a kind person.

[06:26] And the way you are kind is that you tell the truth.

[06:28] And you just be honest.

[06:29] And the easiest way that I can tell you to be honest is you know when you talk about somebody

[06:32] behind their back, just say it to them.

[06:34] So, yeah, Sandra's been like all over the place lately and she's like, I don't drink

[06:37] it a little bit too much.

[06:39] Sandra, you've been all over the place lately.

[06:41] You've been drinking it a little bit too much.

[06:42] I'm just not sure if I want to say it with that right now.

[06:44] People just don't have the balls to do that.

[06:45] But if you do that, I promise you, you either have better relationships or you'll

[06:48] be done with this Mickey Mouse bullshit of not even being in a real relationship and not

[06:52] wanting to confront reality.

[06:53] Because you may have a shot at getting them to realize that they're not on the path that

[06:56] they wanted to be on.

[06:58] Because you were friends with them at some point.

[07:00] And so either your goals have changed or there's have.

[07:01] If you listen to Kobe's interviews where he talks about his friends, he says very explicitly

[07:07] that he's willing to put everything on the altar for his dream.

[07:11] Now, some people make me the argument that's not called healthy.

[07:14] The question that we're answering here is not how do we do healthy stuff.

[07:17] Question is how do we become the greatest?

[07:19] People judge you on how you spend time and their judgments are simply expressions

[07:24] that they would not spend their time the same way you do.

[07:27] Hey, you work a lot.

[07:29] And I could say, hey, you don't.

[07:31] To the same degree, it's like you spend so much time with your kids.

[07:34] Right?

[07:35] If I say it like that, you're like, wait, no.

[07:37] I'm supposed to.

[07:38] It's only the supposed to, this thing that gives all the emotional charge to these conversations.

[07:42] Otherwise, it's just observing reality.

[07:43] You can't expect to do the same thing everyone else is doing and somehow achieve a different

[07:46] outcome.

[07:47] Once you have the vacuum of friends because you're probably have weeded people out, then

[07:50] the best thing to do is join communities.

[07:51] And then you'll make friends to people in those communities who have the same goals as you.

[07:54] And then if you crush it because you understand that volume is the answer and time is the

[07:57] ingredient, you're going to rise in that community.

[08:01] And you'll gain more status.

[08:02] And you'll start hanging out with people where the topic of that community.

[08:04] And then you can leap frog into other communities.

[08:06] It's just lunch tables on steroids.

[08:07] I've wanted to live a rare life until I will have to be surrounded by rare people and rare

[08:12] people are by definition rare.

[08:14] They're not common.

[08:15] My hope is that the people that I meet now are trying to go all the way with me.

[08:18] I want to do epic shit.

[08:20] If I die and don't do epic shit, I will be bumped.

[08:23] How much am I willing to endure or sacrifice in order to maintain that relationship that

[08:28] I have with my dream?

[08:29] If I have many, many friends over different seasons, I'm totally good with that.

[08:33] Thank you for that season.

[08:34] It was awesome.

[08:35] I don't believe things need to be forever to be good.

[08:37] And it's only the romantic story that we are told of friends for life, et cetera.

[08:42] You die with one good friend or two good friends like you've had a really good life.

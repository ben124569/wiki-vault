[00:00] There's tons of other businesses that you can absolutely demolish.

[00:03] We're making lots of money just by doing the basics.

[00:06] And if you execute on that for 10 years,

[00:08] your business grows by default because your competitors won't do that.

[00:11] Growing businesses is hard because it's different than people expected to be.

[00:15] The singularity of focus is so important.

[00:17] We get presented opportunities every single day that could distract us.

[00:20] And the thing is the bigger you get, the bigger the opportunities that get presented to you.

[00:22] So the harder it is to say no.

[00:24] I'm gonna tell a quick story about the woman in the red dress and I'm gonna relate it to business.

[00:27] In the Matrix, one of my favorite movies,

[00:29] there's the woman in the red dress.

[00:31] And so it's one of the training programs that Morpheus takes Neon on the main character to teach him one simple lesson.

[00:35] And so they're walking through a crowd, it's normal, New York, lots of people,

[00:39] everyone looks different.

[00:40] And then there's this woman in this red dress.

[00:42] And Neon's head turns and Morpheus is still talking to him trying to teach him a lesson.

[00:46] Right? And then he looks back and Morpheus is like,

[00:47] we're listening.

[00:48] He's like, what is that?

[00:49] We're looking at the one in the red dress and he says, look again.

[00:51] He looks back at the woman and it's Agent Smith pointing at the end of his head.

[00:54] The thing is, is I see distractions and new opportunities.

[00:57] She's shiny object as the woman in the red dress.

[01:00] And at every level of business, the woman in the red dress becomes more and more attractive.

[01:03] Because at first you have to say no to thousand opportunities, then ten thousand, then hundred thousand.

[01:06] And you have to learn how to say no again at every level.

[01:09] Because I thought the ones I learned how to say no to the woman in the red dress,

[01:11] I'd be done forever.

[01:12] But that's not true.

[01:13] She comes back.

[01:14] Every level she just gets hotter and hotter and hotter.

[01:16] I used to think that like innovation was everything.

[01:19] And I think innovation is important to very, very small degree.

[01:21] But the vast majority of the business success is actually doing all the stuff that you know you should be doing, but you aren't.

[01:25] A friend of mine has a wife who's really popular and they have literally 60 businesses.

[01:29] He has an excelsi to keep track of all the businesses he has.

[01:31] And I think they make about total between everything, maybe figures a year.

[01:35] And to some of you know like, oh, that's amazing.

[01:37] But hear me out.

[01:38] So we're having this long conversation.

[01:39] And I just said, you know, if there were a magic wand and you could snap your fingers and eliminate all businesses.

[01:45] But one, how easy do you think you'd be to grow that business?

[01:47] He was like, oh my god, it'd be so easy to grow that to like 30 or 50 million.

[01:51] I was like, why don't you do that?

[01:52] And he said that that question has mess with him for an entire year.

[01:55] And he has since that conversation shut down business after business after business, after business.

[02:00] So that he could focus on the one that he thought was the biggest opportunity.

[02:03] Mark Zuckerberg didn't have side hustles.

[02:04] If you do one thing and you do a right and you would all the way, you can get his biggest you want.

[02:08] You can have a long, long, long business that covered the entire United States.

[02:11] You could do that.

[02:12] You could have a cosmetic business that covers the entire United States.

[02:15] You could have whatever type of business you want that covers everyone.

[02:19] If you waited for a long enough for your time and didn't get distracted.

[02:21] It's one of my favorite quotes is by Neil Strauss.

[02:23] He said success comes down to doing the obvious thing for an uncommon long period of time without convincing yourself your smart of the new R.

[02:28] It's the details that pay the dividends, the depth and the nuance of understanding how to do something.

[02:34] And so for example right now, obviously lots of opportunities that we have.

[02:38] I still don't feel like we're doing the basics.

[02:40] If we're not on every platform, why are we thinking of our starting new business?

[02:43] If we're not hardcore email marketing regularly and providing value, why are we going to start in the business?

[02:47] If we're not even building the SEO out on our site, why are we doing something else?

[02:51] If we haven't completely built out the sales training for our sales team to keep their execution high,

[02:56] why are we thinking about doing other things?

[02:57] And so so many entrepreneurs that I see who are talking about how they want to grow their business and do this next new thing or this exciting add-on aren't even doing the basics.

[03:05] And the thing and I've said this before,

[03:07] but being advanced means that you never don't do the basics.

[03:11] And if you're like, well Alex, that's going to take so much time for me to do each of those things.

[03:15] Welcome to building a big business because big businesses do the same things little businesses do,

[03:19] but they do them better and they fill the holes in the bucket.

[03:22] And so if you were to think about a business as a bucket and you've got water pouring in the top,

[03:27] which is the traffic or the eyeballs or whatever, and then the bucket is what you're keeping.

[03:31] So the first thing that you're going to do, if you want to grow,

[03:34] then you're going to want to have the bucket is you don't have multiple buckets.

[03:37] What you're going to do is probably fix the holes in the bucket you got.

[03:39] Number one, fix the bucket.

[03:41] Number two, once you fix the bucket, increase the flow to the bucket.

[03:44] Once you've done that and you've completely maximized that, then you add new flows.

[03:48] But most people have never done that.

[03:49] And so the monitor that I remember about this is better, more new.

[03:53] And so whenever I'm thinking about our business or our businesses in the portfolio,

[03:57] I think have we maxed out better yet.

[03:59] If we have not maxed better yet, there's no point in incurring the risk of more or

[04:03] new because more is riskier than better.

[04:05] Better is the lowest risk opportunity that everyone has.

[04:07] Do you should currently do it better?

[04:08] Follow it faster, follow it more, make better copy, make better creative,

[04:12] optimize your site, hire better people, train them better,

[04:15] have better managed systems better and send of systems to be like,

[04:18] but now it's not so boring.

[04:19] Welcome to growing big shit.

[04:21] How you do it?

[04:22] You literally feel all the holes in the bucket that you know you should be doing, but aren't.

[04:27] If you were to make a list of the top 25 things that you could do in your business that you

[04:31] are not doing, the obvious things that you know would make you more money.

[04:35] If I email them more, I'd be more, if I did more reach out to that big one money.

[04:37] If I made more content, I made more money.

[04:38] If I train myself to more, if I did more call reviews, I made more money.

[04:41] If I did reorganize our customer-armed working process.

[04:44] If I created a better cadence or training for our customer support team or customer

[04:47] suggesting, we'd make more money.

[04:48] Put out every single one of the obvious bullets that you had that you know would grow your business.

[04:52] Instead of doing the new thing, do those.

[04:54] First, and once you've finished that list, what you will see happen.

[04:57] And this is why it's spiritually difficult as an entrepreneur because we stop doing the old thing.

[05:01] We started the new thing and we got reinforced in that behavior.

[05:03] And so we learned the wrong lesson.

[05:05] We learned that when we start new things, good things happen.

[05:08] And so we think we should start new things.

[05:10] This is where it's difficult and we have to learn at each level.

[05:12] You start the new thing and you got rewarded.

[05:14] But now, if you start another thing, you will get punished.

[05:17] And some people never unlearn that first lesson.

[05:19] And so you have to switch from new to better.

[05:21] Because the innovation already happened when you got the product market fit.

[05:24] As soon as people started buying the thing you're selling, that's when the new needs to end.

[05:27] For a while.

[05:28] Because now you just need to do better and more.

[05:30] So you fill the holes in the bucket with all the better and then you do more.

[05:33] Then you go from one piece of content a day to five pieces of content a day.

[05:37] From one sales guy to five sales guys.

[05:39] From one video editor to five video editors.

[05:41] It's about doing more once you fix the first one and make it better.

[05:45] Businesses will grow by default and they will beat their competition if they do everything

[05:49] their competition does.

[05:50] But better.

[05:51] Because what happens is most entrepreneurs will divert resources from their

[05:54] core things.

[05:54] Think about the two paths.

[05:55] Bloring entrepreneur number one who finally finds product market fit people like the stuff

[05:59] that they're selling.

[06:00] And then they say, I'm not going to do anything new for the next five years.

[06:02] I'm going to do is do this better and do more of them.

[06:05] So I'm going to do.

[06:05] And then you think about the other guy who says, oh, we got some product market fit.

[06:09] Fantastic.

[06:09] Now I'm going to sell something else.

[06:10] And I get to get my rock stock and my jolly zone over here.

[06:13] Think about all this new stuff, all this new marketing, all this new product.

[06:15] Well, the other business starts to wither away a little bit because

[06:18] after a few starts happen because the things that were there when you're overseeing it

[06:21] aren't happening any more anyways and not only that, it's never improving and

[06:24] cost of me to go up.

[06:25] Cost of talent goes up and the business is literally getting worse relative of the market

[06:28] over time if you're not improving it.

[06:29] And so you got these two entrepreneurs.

[06:31] And this guy is diverting resources that would have been allocated back to the same bucket

[06:34] to fill the holes as instead taking some of that and trying to build another bucket over here.

[06:38] Meanwhile, the holes are getting bigger in the first bucket because it's getting worse and worse

[06:42] and worse and worse.

[06:42] And so then they find themselves with five buckets that are all tons of holes in them.

[06:46] They don't have the bandwidth to actually go to the one bucket and fix it.

[06:49] And that's when I ask the magic long question.

[06:50] So right now if you have multiple things going on, how easy would it be to grow your business

[06:54] if I could wave a magic once, snap my fingers and everything ended except for one.

[06:59] Pretty easy, right?

[07:00] So why not stack the chips in your favor?

[07:02] The thing that makes it hard is the discipline you have to have.

[07:05] Not the concept.

[07:06] Strategy is easy execution is hard.

[07:08] It's the execution risk that is the much bigger risk for most businesses.

[07:11] If you deliver dry cleaning that is always clean, always.

[07:15] And always on time, you'll have an exceptional business.

[07:17] The strategy isn't complicated.

[07:19] It's the execution is where everyone fails.

[07:21] But this is the thing is that the strategy is the new and exciting thing.

[07:24] People allocate tons of attention tons of time to new strategies new ideas rather than

[07:28] making the obvious truth of if I deliver everyone their clothes on time and they are always perfectly

[07:33] clean.

[07:34] This business will work.

[07:35] One of the things that we do when we're growing the business after understanding better

[07:38] more new when we think about anything that we're growing is what do we need to believe for

[07:42] this to grow?

[07:43] We need to believe that people will always want things fast.

[07:46] Do is that something I want to bet on?

[07:47] Yes.

[07:48] People always want a good product so that we clean their clothes perfectly every time.

[07:52] Do I believe that that's something that people want in the future as much they want

[07:54] to date or more?

[07:55] Yes.

[07:56] People always want good service.

[07:57] Do I believe that that's when people want on the future or in the day?

[07:59] Yes.

[08:00] It's one of the beautiful things is that we enter a market like something is boring as dry

[08:03] cleaner.

[08:04] Boring is long care.

[08:05] Boring is whatever.

[08:06] Often times you're actually not competing as the smartest people in the world.

[08:08] As far as people are older on Silicon Valley I'll try to make the next platform.

[08:11] But there's tons of other businesses that you can absolutely demolish.

[08:14] We're making lots of money just by doing the basics and what makes them basics is how

[08:18] hard they are to understand.

[08:20] But what makes you advance is how well you execute them.

[08:22] It's not hard to conceptualize that you take 10 guys and each guy makes 200 calls a day.

[08:25] It's 2000 calls and it's not hard to conceptualize that.

[08:27] How well did you train them?

[08:29] How well did you recruit them?

[08:30] What is their incentive structure?

[08:31] Do you listen to calls on regular basis?

[08:32] Is their leaderboard?

[08:33] Because you're thinking yourself when you have that big list we need to do competition

[08:36] for the sales.

[08:37] I need to get that leaderboard set up.

[08:38] Oh yeah I need to be doing more call reviews.

[08:40] That is the stuff that grows the business.

[08:42] It's not the big idea.

[08:43] People always want leads.

[08:44] Promise you.

[08:45] You know how to get a better?

[08:46] You will make tons of money.

[08:47] People always need to place a lift.

[08:48] You have better buildings that are cleaner and things run right and you treat your residence

[08:51] well.

[08:52] You have successful buildings.

[08:53] If you have lawn care where everyone communicates well and is cost effective and the grass

[08:59] always looks great and the hedges are clean lines, advocates that are perfect for most

[09:03] people.

[09:04] You will have a good business.

[09:05] You might be competing as people who are not who don't even think that way.

[09:07] And so you can absolutely take their lunch money.

[09:09] But you have to not get fancy.

[09:11] So when I was going through the sale process for two of our companies, bankers introduced

[09:14] me to a couple of other CEOs that they had done deals with because I wanted to know

[09:19] what it was like after things like that.

[09:20] Oh we can just connect with these guys.

[09:21] So I talked to one of them and the conversation changed my life.

[09:24] He was a mercenary CEO.

[09:25] So he was a third time CEO that private equity buy company, place him in, he'd grow

[09:29] it and then they'd sell it.

[09:30] And he'd done that three times already.

[09:31] So super seasoned guy was a long island guy.

[09:34] I really think I said, you know, everybody wants the super fancy trick plays.

[09:37] It's like okay hike and then I you know, fix the left and then we go right and then

[09:42] it's actually going to be a reverse, you know, whatever.

[09:44] And then we toss it and then what do you know happens?

[09:46] He catches it and then fumbles it and the other team takes it down for touch stuff.

[09:49] He's like no, we're doing simple backyard football.

[09:53] He's like, two fat guys in the middle run to the right, consistent yardage.

[09:56] He's like don't be cute.

[09:57] And he said that and it really changed the way I saw a business.

[10:01] You don't need to have any fancy play to be successful.

[10:04] You just have to be willing to get the consistent yardage.

[10:07] People want clean clothes.

[10:08] People want them fast.

[10:10] People want good service.

[10:11] And if you execute on that for 10 years and you fill every hole in the bucket,

[10:16] your business grows by default because your competitors will do that.

[10:19] This is where I say like business is not hard in that it is not complicated.

[10:23] It is hard because people cannot stay focused on the same thing for a long period of

[10:27] time.

[10:28] It's also because once people make a certain amount of money, if they only did it for

[10:30] the income, they're trying to find the next thing they can make them more income rather

[10:33] than the mission of the business.

[10:35] Because if you believe in the mission of the business, you will be willing to do it

[10:38] for an extraordinary long period of time.

[10:39] And I can tell you right now from all the friends that I have them, make shitloads

[10:42] of money.

[10:43] They've all been doing the same thing for a long period of time.

[10:45] So as much as the world wants to tell you, you should have 17 majors in college and

[10:49] you should taste everything.

[10:50] And I think there's value to that.

[10:51] It will not fight against the reality.

[10:52] Ben Francis started Jim Sharq when he was whatever 17 and now he's 28 or 29 he's got a

[10:58] billion dollar thing.

[10:59] Could he have tasted more stuff?

[11:00] Sure, he tasted from like 14 to 17, right?

[11:02] But then when he started that, he's been doing it for 10 or 11 years now.

[11:05] And now he's a billion dollar thing.

[11:06] The work needs doing and you just need to decide when you want to start the compounding

[11:10] clock in your favor, which means how long can I commit to this thing.

[11:12] And so I would say, once you've had a little bit of your entrepreneurial mix as fast as

[11:16] you can to learn those lessons, you have to think what need to believe in the

[11:19] leaves is there that I do not think will change over an extended time horizon.

[11:22] And then serve that.

[11:23] Every day, all you do is you look at how to do better and how to do more of it.

[11:27] And it's going to kill you inside because you like doing your shit.

[11:30] And that's what was possibly your enforced, your entire life is an entrepreneur in the

[11:33] beginning.

[11:34] And then you have to unlearn that lesson because that's what it takes to get big is you do

[11:37] the same thing and you just do it that much better than everyone else.

[11:39] And that takes time.

[11:40] It is arrogant to believe that you were going to out compete other people who are fully

[11:46] focused on one thing when you are split on five.

[11:49] Think about how arrogant it is to think that.

[11:51] And the thing is plenty people are arrogant.

[11:52] So many of you will still do this, but you will also still be poor.

[11:55] So whatever.

[11:56] Some dude is he's got a long care business and all he does is longer.

[11:59] All day, every day, that's all he does is mullons and he believes that everybody deserves

[12:02] amazing long because he's got a story when he's a kid and that was the only thing

[12:05] that his parents could do was cut the lawn to even though they were poor.

[12:07] It was like something that gave them stats and they put it in the rim of his dad crime

[12:10] because somebody gave him a compliment on and he hadn't gotten a compliment forever.

[12:12] Whatever that reason is, he's driven to make that company.

[12:15] And he got the other guy who's like, oh yeah, I'm doing dropshipping, I'm doing some

[12:18] long care stuff and I'm doing some consulting gigs on the side from marketing and I'm

[12:22] doing NFTs whenever, right?

[12:24] He's got all these things going on.

[12:25] Who is going to win at long care?

[12:28] It's obvious.

[12:29] And yet we still live like this other guy.

[12:31] And so my hope is that you recognize that if that's you, stop and I'm only saying this

[12:36] from place to place because I had nine businesses before Jim wants to go off.

[12:39] Before you think, oh, well, what I'm going to do, because I hear this all the time, I'm

[12:42] going to do them all and see which one takes off.

[12:44] None of them will take off.

[12:45] Because any of them could take off.

[12:46] If you just focus on one of them, thinking that the outside market is somehow going

[12:50] to make you successful, like you're going to pick the right bet when you can force any of

[12:54] them to be successful, right?

[12:55] Providing not selling newspapers.

[12:56] And a coin to my from high school, he said, hey, I've got a roofing business, you know,

[13:00] it's awesome.

[13:01] I said, oh, that's great.

[13:02] And he said, oh, yeah, we also do real estate flipping.

[13:04] I was like, okay, all right.

[13:06] He's like, oh, and we also do general contracting.

[13:08] Okay, he's like, oh, we do window stuff too.

[13:10] That's actually class and window stuff too.

[13:11] Because it's like, you want to be vertically integrated for real estate.

[13:14] Like, did you do it in like 4 million bucks a year?

[13:16] Like, you're not vertically integrated.

[13:17] You're just distracted.

[13:18] If you look at the biggest roofing companies in the world, they're billion dollar companies.

[13:22] Billion, multi-billion dollar companies.

[13:24] You can do one thing to scale and make all the money you want and you will only get there

[13:28] with the scale from the details, from the depth.

[13:32] That's how you get these compounding returns from doing the same thing over and over again

[13:34] because you get better, better, better, better at it.

[13:35] The other guy who's got four things, he's never going to get good at any of them.

[13:38] He's just going to be barely good enough and he's going to make barely good enough money.

[13:41] If you're not making money in any of the things, because you don't understand any of them

[13:44] all enough because if you can see anybody in your industry who's doing the thing that you're

[13:47] doing and making a hundred times more money than you, it's because they know it better

[13:49] than you.

[13:50] So how quickly you're going to pay down the ignorance.

[13:51] You're going to try and divide it by four.

[13:53] You're going to try and pay down the ignorance that of one of the misfases you can

[13:56] so you can start the compounding.

[00:00] In my second company, Prestige Labs, I built up to 5,000 affiliates that generated

[00:04] 20 plus $000 a year in revenue and that business continues to this day.

[00:08] In Alan, my software company, which was my third big company, we built up to over 1,000

[00:14] affiliates that were agencies, white labeling that software.

[00:17] For my book launch, for $100,000, we got 30,000 affiliates who promoted the actual

[00:22] book launch.

[00:23] I've also invested in companies that I've personally endorsed and so I bring all these things

[00:27] up because most people don't know how to quote monetize an audience.

[00:31] And after talking to a lot of creators or celebrities and influencers and also business owners

[00:38] who want to do deals with those people, a lot of people don't share a contract in terms

[00:42] of thinking through how to make those deals happen.

[00:45] And so I wanted to make this video to outline the four ways that I see those deals happening

[00:49] in the combinations between them and what considerations you might have, whether you're on

[00:53] the doing the deal side of having an audience or being the person who wants to quote

[00:58] by licensed rent the audience from an influencer or somebody who has those eyeballs.

[01:03] All right.

[01:04] So four ways to monetize an audience.

[01:07] Let's use a good marker that doesn't suck.

[01:12] Step one, have good markers.

[01:15] Four ways to monetize an audience.

[01:25] All right.

[01:27] Now right off the bat number one, we've got affiliates, which is what I was saying earlier.

[01:35] The second way that you can monetize an audience is through sponsorships.

[01:39] Some people call these endorsements.

[01:44] The third way that you can do this is through partnerships, which usually involve equity.

[01:54] And the fourth way that we can do this is starting your own if you're the influencer in

[01:59] this instance.

[02:01] All right.

[02:02] So we have affiliates, which is where you are getting paid after you make sales for a

[02:10] business, sponsorships where they pay you first to advertise on behalf of the business

[02:14] and typically endorse it via your brand.

[02:17] Partnerships where you go into a business that already has a product already has an infrastructure

[02:23] and you do one of these two things or combination of these two things for equity.

[02:29] And so the behaviors between affiliate sponsorships and partnerships are more or less the

[02:33] same, the difference is simply how you get compensated.

[02:36] And then the fourth is where you just start your entirely own brand to then promote to your

[02:40] audience.

[02:41] All right.

[02:42] So let's break down which of these and kind of where they sit on the continuum.

[02:45] And the reason I want to bring this up is because I'm having so many conversations with

[02:48] people who are like, I have this audience.

[02:50] I've built it for four years.

[02:51] I just don't know what to do.

[02:53] And so I think of these for on a continuum.

[02:56] All right.

[02:57] And I can think of this continuum in terms of difficulty and risk and value.

[03:02] And so on this side, you've got the affiliates.

[03:06] This is the fastest way that you can immediately make money.

[03:10] Most businesses that have affiliate programs, you can sign up automatically.

[03:14] They have predetermined terms that are associated with this agreement.

[03:19] And as unless you do something that's really nefarious or weird, they're happy to have

[03:23] you sell their stuff.

[03:26] So one is this one's fastest.

[03:28] This is low risk for kind of both parties because if you are an affiliate and you're

[03:35] promoting it, like they don't have to pay you until after you make a sale.

[03:39] Now for you, you also don't get capped.

[03:41] And so if you can make a ton of sales and you feel like you're being undervalued, then

[03:44] you just get to prove that you are actually good at promoting and that your audience is

[03:48] actually a good fit for whatever that product is.

[03:51] But from a value perspective, so I'll call it exit value.

[03:56] Afflead revenue streams are not typically that valuable.

[04:00] So they will contribute to the sellability of company.

[04:03] But the majority of that value would come in the terms of a multiple of the cash flow

[04:08] that you're receiving isn't affiliate.

[04:11] Multiplied or discounted by how reliable the business that you're doing business with is.

[04:15] And so if I'm an affiliate of the US government, you don't even mean an I recruit people

[04:19] for the military, then I probably can say that my business model is sound of the US government's

[04:23] not going to go away.

[04:25] I'm not getting no no standing theories and whatnot.

[04:28] But by and large, it's to be a trustworthy third party.

[04:31] On the flip side, if I have some info thing that is going to disappear tomorrow because

[04:36] there's some arbitrage opportunity that's your business opportunity, then this is going

[04:40] to be basically have no value because that business that underlines that cash flow has

[04:45] no value.

[04:46] And so we're moving along here.

[04:47] So this is the lowest value, probably middle work, low-ish risk for you.

[04:54] All right, the next is you've got sponsorships.

[05:01] So sponsorships is where someone pays you first.

[05:03] All right, so you receive cash and then you make the endorsement.

[05:07] And so usually this isn't two forms.

[05:09] You advertise to your audience.

[05:12] And the reason I say advertise rather than here at sell, here you only get paid after

[05:16] people buy with sponsorships you get paid first.

[05:19] And so that means that you are advertising.

[05:21] You are a traffic source for the business.

[05:24] And so you will get paid as a traffic source.

[05:26] Typically, based on CPMs, meaning cost per thousand impressions that you can have in terms

[05:31] of views to an audience.

[05:33] Now, these sponsorships come in the form of you posting stuff to your audience, which for

[05:38] them they see this as free traffic or technically paying for it.

[05:42] But you're monetizing the traffic that you have.

[05:44] The other way, which is the more scalable way, is something called whitelisting, which

[05:49] is basically them taking whatever your posts are and then running them is ads.

[05:55] And so let's say I have a million person audience.

[05:57] I make a post and only two hundred thousand people see it.

[06:00] And as most content creators would do, you wouldn't want to post over and over again about

[06:05] that thing because it would kind of be like, oh, this guy is just promoting this thing

[06:07] over and over again, it wouldn't feel good.

[06:09] And so you might make a post or two every so often to not interrupt the value that you're

[06:14] providing to your audience too much.

[06:17] And so the way to solve this really for both parties is you make an advertisement saying,

[06:22] hey, I just partnered with so and so.

[06:24] Their thing is awesome.

[06:25] I've actually been using it for years.

[06:27] Finally, keep you to agreement.

[06:28] I think you guys might like it.

[06:29] Check it out.

[06:30] Right?

[06:31] And so that whitelisting then allows them to blast it to people way outside of your audience.

[06:35] I like this a lot as a win-win because the business pays money to advertise your brand.

[06:42] So they make you bigger and they're spending money to advertise you.

[06:45] But at the same time, they get higher conversion rate because you're probably better on

[06:48] camera, you're better spoken and you already have a certain amount of warm audience that

[06:51] recognize you at least your face or your mannerisms so you convert it to higher percentage.

[06:56] So the business makes money.

[06:57] You grow your brand.

[06:58] This is a really nice partnership.

[06:59] Now, these deals, sponsorships are harder to come by than affiliate deals because most

[07:05] affiliate companies just have a program and influence program and affiliate program.

[07:09] And you just sign up on the standard terms.

[07:11] These are the partnerships tend to be more a lot of cart depending on the size of the influencer,

[07:15] relative to the size of the company.

[07:17] And so for extreme examples, if you're a huge influencer and there's a tiny company, you'll

[07:21] be able to get an amazing sponsorship deal.

[07:23] If it's a huge company like Nike and you're a small influencer, you might not get any

[07:27] deal and you still wear their stuff.

[07:29] And so it's really the balance between who has how much leverage in the negotiation.

[07:34] Which brings us to the fourth one.

[07:36] I'm sorry, the third one.

[07:37] Which is partnerships.

[07:38] All right.

[07:40] As we move along here, sponsorships also don't have kind of like a fillets, huge exit

[07:47] value.

[07:48] The only place that sponsorships really become exitable valuable, exitable value for a business

[07:54] is if you have a true media company.

[07:56] Now, if you're a personal brand, it's really tough to exit your personal brand.

[08:00] But if I have an army of influencers and I negotiate deals through my network and say,

[08:05] you know, perhaps Lou Ribbon or, you know, Budweiser, whatever, I have a thousand influencers

[08:11] that fit your ideal profile for customers and I'll negotiate an umbrella deal and then

[08:16] all of them are forced because they have with them to promote your stuff.

[08:20] Now you have a media company, which is very similar to a talent agency slightly different,

[08:24] but has a lot of similarities.

[08:26] And so then then that sponsorship for revenue is really the main revenue of your business,

[08:29] which is that you sell traffic at a discount.

[08:31] Right.

[08:34] But for the, for the influencer individually, these two things, very hard to sell, not really

[08:41] sellable, not much.

[08:43] Now once we get on this side, these deals get harder and harder to do and you do few and

[08:47] fewer of them as you go down this line.

[08:50] So a partnership can either be a minority deal or a majority deal.

[08:55] Again, if you're going to go a partner with a company and your huge and they're tiny,

[08:58] then it might be a majority deal.

[09:00] If they're huge and your tiny relative to them, then it might be a minority deal.

[09:04] Meaning you're not going to get all of the company and that can range from, you know,

[09:08] 0.01% of the business all the way to you getting, you know, 99% of the business in

[09:14] terms of the range.

[09:15] And so anything that you can imagine in terms of economics here is going to be negotiable.

[09:19] But one of the things or some of the things that I would consider here is performance, which

[09:23] is, this is again for both parties.

[09:28] You can have equity is the form of compensation rather than necessarily cash.

[09:32] And you say, hey, if I bring you an extra thousand customers, I get, you know, 1% per

[09:37] thousand customers that I bring you to the platform or whatever.

[09:42] And then you put a cap on that at some point where you say up to, to, you know, 10%.

[09:48] Great.

[09:49] And so that way, it's a little bit balanced for you and for the business.

[09:52] Now one of the considerations that you have to have, if you were the content creator or

[09:56] the influencer, is that the, the association that you make with their brand is permanent.

[10:02] As soon as you make that public decoration, you transfer all of that goodwill, you transfer

[10:05] that association to them.

[10:07] And so if you are going to do a deal like this, my recommendation is that you want to have

[10:11] at least something upfront.

[10:14] So no matter what for doing this deal, you get some amount of this equity upfront and then

[10:19] some percentage that's based on performance.

[10:21] Now, the, one of the last components that I'll say, and there's obviously a lot of ways

[10:25] that you can do deals, but these are just the things that I think through is time.

[10:29] And so somebody who's on the business owner side is like, well, I don't want you to just

[10:32] make one association.

[10:33] I want you to keep doing this for a long period of time.

[10:35] And so they can take some of this equity that they want to give you and say, all right,

[10:39] I'm going to give you, you know, 25% of your equity upfront.

[10:43] I'm going to give you 25% based on performance.

[10:47] And I'm going to give you 50% over time.

[10:49] And so I want you to promote for the next four years.

[10:51] And if for some reason, something happens, then you're not going to get that besting,

[10:55] because we had some sort of breakup, right?

[10:57] And so whenever I think through these terms, I just like to think of through all the

[11:01] W's, which is who, what, where, when, why, how, right, which is, okay, I want you to

[11:05] post.

[11:06] And if you're the contributor, you should be asking that same thing, which is how much do

[11:09] you want me to post, right, and about what?

[11:11] And you have to take into consideration that you have to keep building your brand, right?

[11:14] And so you don't want to just be like, all of a sudden, some shell, like, that's not good.

[11:18] You want to tastefully be able to integrate that promotion into the content that you have.

[11:23] And so you have to say, okay, well, I think the best way for us to do this is for me to, you

[11:27] know, put your links in my bio.

[11:30] And I'll put it up for one week of the month.

[11:32] And I will make one long form thing that mentions it.

[11:36] And, you know, five short form things via poster stories.

[11:39] And then when you define that, and the reason this is so important is that you define

[11:43] that stuff up front so that it's just very clear.

[11:45] Don't just say, like, I will promote the business in what I'm because it just doesn't work

[11:48] as well.

[11:49] And you might say, I will also, you know, record ads once a month that you can then use

[11:54] for white listing.

[11:55] And so all of these things, and this is where this gets more nuanced than deal making,

[11:59] is you can be a partner and still have affiliate revenue.

[12:02] You can be a partner and still get paid from sponsorship perspective.

[12:05] And so these things are not mutually exclusive.

[12:07] But like, you might have a primarily sponsorship deal with some element of equity.

[12:12] But I will say on a personal level, the more money you have right now, the more you

[12:16] want to lean this way, because the equity, the sponsorship cash that you choose to take,

[12:23] you do it the expensive equity.

[12:25] And if you believe in the product and you believe that the company is exitable in the future,

[12:29] then in my opinion, it makes sense to delay it for the little bit longer run.

[12:32] But this takes on more risk.

[12:34] Because here you get paid to day no matter what.

[12:36] Here, you might not ever get paid if the company doesn't sell.

[12:39] And so by taking on more risk, you want to make sure that you're getting a disproportionate

[12:42] reward in the form of stock shares, option equity, and things like that.

[12:47] And so as we're walking through this and you're thinking, okay, how can I monetize my

[12:50] brand?

[12:51] It's like, okay, the first level, I can do affiliates and just promote other people's stuff

[12:53] and get paid for it.

[12:55] The next level, I can be a media source for them.

[12:57] I can be traffic for them via sponsorship, right?

[12:59] These are a little bit more nuanced deals.

[13:02] Taking another step, I can actually partner with the brand and say, hey, I want to own

[13:05] percent, 5% and 10%, 50% depending on how big you are and how big your audience is.

[13:11] And then finally, you can start your own brand.

[13:20] And when I say brand, I say that all inclusive in terms of products and brand.

[13:24] And when you do this, you can either white label, which means you go to somebody who

[13:30] manufacturer stuff already and say, can you slot my logo on it, which is an option.

[13:34] And the other option is that you do custom formulations.

[13:37] Custom, I'll just say custom stuff.

[13:39] And so if I were selling supplements, for example, I might go to a company that already

[13:44] has a product that's done and I just say, hey, I want to slot my label on it.

[13:47] On the custom version of this, it's like, hey, I want this brand with this.

[13:50] We're going to test out flavors together and we're going to put it together and make a

[13:52] custom product that no one else has.

[13:54] Same things works with merchandise.

[13:56] So if you said, hey, I want to get a white t-shirt and you just try six different white

[13:59] t-shirts that people have off the shelf that are manufacturers, they say, okay, just

[14:04] slot my logo on it, let's go or you say, hey, what are the different fabrics?

[14:07] What are the different materials that I can put together?

[14:09] These are the cuts that I want to look at.

[14:10] This is how I want it to fit, right?

[14:12] That becomes more custom.

[14:14] And so white label is faster and easier from a speed perspective.

[14:20] But usually, me personally, I prefer to do custom stuff because I don't like anyone else

[14:24] being able to sell something that's identical to me and be able to have any kind of pricing

[14:27] power over what I have.

[14:29] Because the moment that people find out that you just have a generic product that you

[14:33] slap the label on, it just does, it's not a good look, right?

[14:36] And so again, I don't think there's anything like on a be clearly.

[14:39] I don't think there's anything wrong with doing the white label.

[14:41] I just think that if we were to put this on this fear, like white label would be here

[14:44] and custom would be here.

[14:45] But if you're going to take the risk on of starting your own brand, I might as well get

[14:49] all the benefits of doing it.

[14:51] But this costs more money.

[14:54] White label tends to cost less because you don't have to get custom templates, custom forms

[14:57] and pay and incur all those costs because someone else, their whole business is spaced

[15:01] around doing this for other people.

[15:03] All right.

[15:04] Now the difference here is that for all of these situations, you're going to promote

[15:08] stuff that already exists.

[15:10] Here, you're starting the thing from ground zero, which means that you're on the other

[15:14] side of the table now.

[15:16] You start with 100% equity and then you start paying people this way down the line.

[15:22] And so if you are an influencer, you have an audience or you're a business owner and

[15:27] you're trying to make deals with influencers.

[15:30] This is how I think through this.

[15:32] And I try and see there are elements that you can borrow from each of these kind of verticals

[15:37] to tweak the deal to make it right for everyone.

[15:41] And so I think about it in terms of, what's the exit value?

[15:44] What cash is going to be going in or out of the business?

[15:48] How much work is the person going to do and then how much risk am I or are they exposed

[15:52] to?

[15:53] Now I'm balancing those four things.

[15:54] You can usually navigate along this continuum to find the right part, the right deal.

[16:00] That's right for you and the product.

[16:03] That's it.

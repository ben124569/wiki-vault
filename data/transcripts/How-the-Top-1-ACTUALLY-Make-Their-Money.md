[00:00] How do the top 0.1% in the world actually make more money than everyone else?

[00:05] There's three layers. Let's start with layer one. Global.

[00:09] So if you zoom all the way out, the top 1% of countries in the world do things differently than the

[00:13] rest of them. And we can measure the productivity of a country by something called GDP, which is

[00:17] gross domestic product per capita. Now, the per capita part just means how much total production

[00:23] the economy does, so just think revenue thinks sales, and then per capita is per person. And so

[00:28] this allows us to normalize different countries that are big countries versus small countries and

[00:32] see how much the individual is making. Now, the reason this is so important and why we start at

[00:37] layer one global is because if you even out everything, you will be able to see the strongest

[00:42] levers on wealth creation because they're just done in aggregate. And to be clear, within each

[00:46] country, of course, there are some people that get way more of that slice of the pie than others,

[00:51] but even at the global level, there are some countries that get more of the slice of the pie

[00:55] than other countries. And so for example, the United States has the largest GDP in the world,

[01:00] and tovalu has the smallest. Now, per capita, it shifts around. Luxembourg is actually the

[01:05] country in the world that has the highest GDP per person, so 151,000. Now, I'll give you an example

[01:11] of number two, which is Singapore, they have the second highest GDP per capita and is also the home

[01:16] of Michael, who's our media director. And the reason they're able to do that is because they invest

[01:22] these countries in two major categories. Number one is education and number two is technology. And so

[01:28] if you look at GDP per capita for a country, the increases can almost directly be tied by reinvestments

[01:36] in education and technology. Singapore has $148,000 in gross domestic product per capita.

[01:43] Now, how do they have that? Well, the entire culture in Singapore is flipped compared to say the

[01:48] United States. Teachers believe it or not, there are actually seen as one of the most prestigious

[01:53] positions that you can hold and they are paid very well because the country understands that attracting

[01:59] good teachers is one of the ways to make the country more competitive long-term. And so if we think

[02:06] about this at a global level, which I think is important, is what are the inputs that every country

[02:12] has that's even. The inputs are time and bodies. And so at the very basic level, someone

[02:25] anybody, and all these countries at level zero can do manual labor, which is basically things that

[02:30] have required no skill to do. So if I had a conveyor belt of switchboards and I had to plug two things

[02:35] in and another one comes in and I plugged two things in, it's typically something that you can

[02:38] train someone to do in about five minutes. And then you're just basically having them trade their

[02:42] time and doing this very simple task repetitively. Now, that is typically not valued nearly as

[02:48] highly as other skills, which is why countries will invest in technology and education. The

[02:54] education so that they have more skills, technology to do three things. Technology does number one,

[02:59] it allows you to do more of what you currently do. So that switchboard person, if there wasn't a

[03:03] conveyor belt in front of them, wouldn't be able to do nearly as many of those things as someone who did.

[03:08] The second thing is that technology allows you to do what you can already do even better.

[03:12] And so think of both of those in terms of units of time, because remember this is one of the key

[03:16] inputs that everybody has that's even. Whether you're in the richest country in the world or the

[03:19] poorest country in the world, every single person has the same 24 hours. And yet some countries

[03:24] massively outcompete other ones, just like some individuals in every individual economy, massively out

[03:30] and people within them, which will peel back and layer two. Let's think about it like this.

[03:34] If you have a brain in two hands, then what allows you to do more with that brain in two hands?

[03:41] Well, technology lowers the skill requirement to do anything. If you had to figure out how to build a

[03:47] house, but you couldn't use tools, you'd have to ever tremendous amount of skills. But all of a sudden,

[03:52] if you have a saw and you have some nails, then you wouldn't have to figure out how to break

[03:57] trees and interlock them and do all sorts of craziness. That's at a very basic level.

[04:01] But on top of that, it allows you to do more of what you're already doing. So that means you're

[04:06] doing more per unit of time, remember everything's going to be traced back to time. Or you do

[04:10] higher quality, which also is traced back to time, because maybe it would take you a longer period

[04:14] of time to make something that good or it would just simply be impossible. Which is why it's such an

[04:19] advantage that in the early days of smartphones, and I don't even know if they still do this anymore,

[04:24] but you're not allowed to use a smartphone when you take tests because it's such an advantage

[04:28] that it shifts the whole curve, which I think, by the way, they should allow you to do that,

[04:32] because that's how the real world is, and I think the point of school is to prepare you for it.

[04:35] And so imagine you have two different sets of people. We've got a hundred people on one side,

[04:39] a hundred people on the other. And the hundred people on one side have electricity, Wi-Fi, internet,

[04:43] computers, versus the others, don't. Which one's going to produce more economic value?

[04:47] Obviously, the one on the left. Not because these people are inherently better than the others,

[04:51] they just have technology on their side. And so we have to think about ourselves from the country all the

[04:56] way down using the same tools. So at the first layer, the wealthiest people in the world, the

[05:01] point one percent, investing gaining skills buying technology, or learning skills to use that technology.

[05:08] Now, if you're hearing this, you might think, like, I would, well, cool, that's great for them,

[05:12] but what about me? So that enters into layer two. So let's zoom in on that. What are the

[05:17] skills that actually create the production at the individual level? So instead of global,

[05:21] now let's talk about that per capita, that person, just like you, just like me. Now how do the

[05:26] point one percent actually create that gross domestic product, that gross production, that revenue,

[05:32] that then gets categorized for the entire country? Well, there are three skills that I'll call

[05:38] BSL and then they're multiplied by something that I'll use as R. And you're like, what do these all

[05:45] stand for? Well, the first thing category of skills is around building. You make stuff. You

[05:52] either build bridges, you build software. Sometimes building is putting together things so that you can do

[05:56] services, but you build stuff. The second is you sell stuff. The third is you lead people. And these

[06:06] also chunk up if you want the fancier terms here to mechanical, verbal, and social skills. So these

[06:12] are the three overarching categories that skilled development as it relates to GDP can get

[06:17] bubbled up to. Now to be clear, each of these skills are not binary. It's not, oh, you know how

[06:24] to build. Oh, you know how to sell. Oh, you know how to lead. But it's how well can you build,

[06:29] how well can you sell, and how well can you lead. And so with each of these, they create leverage.

[06:35] They get you more for what you put in specifically time. Because if I build something, then I can have

[06:41] many people use it over and over again. If I learn how to sell, I can sell many people at once.

[06:46] If I learn how to lead, I can get many people inside my company to do many things on my behalf.

[06:53] And in each of these situations, that one person starts to accumulate the aggregate production

[06:59] of everyone else that touches either the thing they built, how they got people to exchange,

[07:03] 24, or the people that they were able to lead to deliver. And the outcome of all of these things

[07:08] is the big thing that everyone cares about, which is money. Now, the longer that this lever gets,

[07:14] meaning if I get better and better at building, then more money happens on this side. If I get

[07:19] better and better at selling, more money happens on this side. If I get better and better at leading,

[07:23] I can pull this lever with more leverage and get more money. Now, what are the richest people in

[07:29] the world having common? Well, not only do they have one of these skills developed out a lot,

[07:34] many of them have all of these skills super maxed out. And the difficulty with this drawing

[07:39] is that it's very hard to show that maybe the average person's lever looks like this.

[07:45] Compared to with the richest people, the point one percent actually make. So let's zoom in

[07:50] on some of the biggest financial success stories of our time. So if you look at Zuckerberg,

[07:54] for example, who's a founder of Facebook when he started, he probably mostly just had build skills.

[07:59] But those build skills were enough that eventually he learned a little bit more about

[08:02] promotion. He built some promotion into the product, which allowed him to get more more people on.

[08:07] Then over time, he developed leadership skills so that he could lead the company. And it's very

[08:12] common that building and selling happened in the beginning and then leading develops over time.

[08:16] Because in the beginning, who are you going to be leading besides yourself, right? Not many people.

[08:20] And this skill naturally will develop in time, but it gives you more leverage on the other too.

[08:24] So let's get tactical on build. So in this book, $100 offers, I talk about the concept of

[08:31] trimming and stacking. So it starts with looking at all the different problems that a customer

[08:35] presents with. And then thinking, okay, how many different ways can I solve them? And so I use something

[08:39] called the delivery cube to say, okay, if we have this one problem, how can I solve this by thinking

[08:44] about the level of personal intention I want to provide? What level of effort would be expected from them?

[08:49] If doing something like, what kind of environment or medium do I want to solve this problem?

[08:53] Do I want, how do I want these people to consume my solution? How quickly do I want them to

[08:59] get a response or get their problem solved using my services or product? And then if I were to

[09:05] create a product that was 10 times as expensive, what would that look like? And if I had to create a

[09:10] product that was one tenth as expensive, but still had to preserve the same outcome, how would I build

[09:14] that instead? And so this is a wonderful framework that I like to think through. And also wondering,

[09:19] is there a way that we can psychologically solve a problem rather than simply logically solve a problem?

[09:24] And worries Southernland talks about this when he explains that some people used to complain about

[09:30] having slow elevators. You could either replace the entire elevator system, put a bigger

[09:34] motor in and try and get people their faster or you can just put mirrors in the elevators

[09:40] and then people stare at themselves and don't notice the time pass. And so that would be a

[09:44] psychological rather than logical solution because customers are by and large, illogical. And so

[09:50] we want to make sure that the solution that we have solves the problem and sometimes it's not

[09:53] even in the way that you logically expect. Now the way that this problem solution cycle actually

[09:59] works, which I talk about in the lead's book, is that you're going to have one problem they present

[10:03] with and then you're going to solve it. And then what happens is that creates yet another problem.

[10:07] Because let's say that you solve someone's hunger problem with a salty pretzel. What problem comes

[10:14] up naturally? Well now they're thirsty. So then you solve that with a glass of water or a soda.

[10:19] And so this cycle continues in continuing continues. Now once you've solved those two problems,

[10:23] what's the next problem? Well now they're dessert stomach is empty. So we have to present them with a cookie.

[10:28] Right? And so there's always, if you properly solve a problem for a customer, there's almost always

[10:33] another problem that gets presented as a result of the solution. And the main reason for that

[10:38] is because people are never satisfied. And so over the span of many years, a good builder will

[10:43] develop an ecosystem of products that solves many customer issues at once. So if you look at Apple,

[10:48] one of the most valuable companies in the world, if not the most valuable, is that it's not just that they

[10:52] have one product. They've built an end to end ecosystem that's closed so that someone can use just

[10:56] their products and solve most of their digital needs. They've got a browser. They've got computers.

[11:01] They've got a phone. They have music where you can buy the stuff. Everything's interconnected.

[11:05] But if you're like, oh I'm going to build that. Well that also took them 50 years or how long it's been.

[11:10] So this stuff happens over time. So that cover is build. But what about sell? Well selling is about

[11:17] the perception of the prospect, which is that fundamentally you might have the best product in the

[11:22] world. But if they don't perceive it to be the best product or even know that it exists,

[11:27] then there's no way that they're ever going to use it. And so we want you to make sure that we can

[11:32] communicate that value to prospects ideally at scale. So the simplest lowest leverage, so think about

[11:38] this thing shortening, the lowest leverage version of selling is selling 101. You saw somebody in

[11:43] person. You saw them via chat. You're just selling and you're closing one customer at a time.

[11:48] Over time, you increase the leverage of sales by either you selling more people at once or getting

[11:55] through leadership, which I'm getting ahead of myself, getting other people to sell in your

[11:59] behalf. But in either situation, you gain more leverage on the amount of people that find out

[12:04] about your stuff and ideally shift their perception of it so that they want to buy it again and again.

[12:10] And when I talk about sell, I actually talk about everything that takes someone from completely

[12:14] unaware to giving you money. All right, so that's all of that position. So that's advertising,

[12:18] marketing sales, branding promotion, and conversion as getting the person to buy. And so the easiest way

[12:24] or the most important part of this is what I would call the call out, which is people noticing

[12:29] your ad and when I say, I mean, if you reach out to somebody that's an advertisement, you let people know

[12:33] about your stuff. Is the most important part. And so I love this quote by David Ogilvie. He says,

[12:38] after you've written your headline, you've spent 80 cents of your advertising dollar. Which just

[12:43] goes to show that that first impression is the part that won, I test the most, and the one that

[12:47] will shift their perception the most, which is also part of something called framing. And so how

[12:53] you position, again, how people perceive the reason the intro of a video so important, the reason

[12:57] the intro of an ad is so important. The reason the moment you introduce yourself, how you introduce

[13:01] yourself is so important is because it frames everything else that happens afterwards. And so let's

[13:06] imagine that you're in a cocktail party in a big ballroom. Lots of people talking groups,

[13:11] loud music playing in the background. In all that noise, a single sound pierces through

[13:15] it all, and you turn around. You want to know the sound? Your name. You hear it, and instantly look

[13:19] for the source. And so a call out is whatever you do to get the attention of your audience.

[13:24] Call that's go from hyper-specific to get one person's attention to not at all specific to get everyone's

[13:29] attention. So let me explain. So if someone drops a tray of dishes in that ballroom, everyone looks.

[13:34] If a child yells mom, then all the moms look. If someone says your name, then only you look.

[13:39] But again, they all get attention. And so we want to make our call out specific enough to get the

[13:44] right people and brought enough to get as many of them as we can. And so with each of these skills,

[13:48] you will typically start narrow and go broader. Facebook when it started as a product was very narrow

[13:53] and then it just started with college students and then it expanded to high school students and then

[13:56] it started going to adults. Right. When you sound in the beginning, you're just going to

[14:01] advertise to a very small niche. As tiny as you can, most of because you can't compete in the

[14:05] ocean. You're not a big enough fish yet. But you can win in the tiny pond, right? Or maybe even a

[14:11] puddle. But then over time, as you get better and bigger, you can expand the breath of the people

[14:16] that you choose to target. And so you will always convert a higher percentage, not absolute,

[14:20] but percentage of an audience by being more specific. And so the easiest way to figure out what your

[14:26] customer is want to hear when you're advertising and selling to them is to simply ask them.

[14:30] And if you want to be a super advanced student, go look at user reviews of all your competitors

[14:35] and figure out the things they complain about. And then talk about those pain points and the things

[14:39] that you want to attract them with. Now, the point one percent know how to build things, then how to

[14:45] let people know about it and get them to give them money for it. The second core skill here was

[14:50] then leads us to the third skill. Because once you're building and selling and building and selling,

[14:53] you're probably going to need help. And that enters into leading. So these are the social dynamics.

[14:58] The reason I think leading is arguably the most important skill besides learning is that it is a

[15:04] metascale. It gains you access to everyone else's skills. And so at its most basic form,

[15:10] if you were the best leader in the entire world, you would be able to get the best builder and the best

[15:14] seller to come work with you and align with your overall objective. I consider building, selling,

[15:20] and leading to be the tripod of business. You must have all three. They are the tripod of business.

[15:27] You must have all three. Now, you can be embalanced and have a stool that looks a little bit weird.

[15:36] But if you don't have one of these legs, this thing's going to fall over. And so you must have all three.

[15:42] Now, the extent to which you have all three will dictate how much money you're able to make.

[15:48] So if you can only sell and you can't build and you can lead, then you'd have a bunch of people

[15:55] who are really good at selling something terrible. So this would be like the Wolf of Wall Street's

[15:59] business. So what he went to jail for. And so that is basically lying at scale, not good.

[16:06] If you just build and no one finds out about it, and you're good at leading, for example,

[16:11] then you'll just have this thing that's sitting in your garage that you promise is amazing,

[16:14] but no one knows about it. And so if no one knows about it, no one can buy it. And on the third

[16:19] extreme, and this is why this one's a little bit more interesting, is that if you could lead,

[16:24] and somehow you found a bunch of people that no one in the organization knew how to sell or build,

[16:28] this is why this is a metoskill, then we'll really nothing would happen because you'd have nothing

[16:32] too build and no one would find out about it. And you just have a lot of people that work somehow

[16:37] organized around doing nothing. And so these are the core things that actually generated the

[16:42] leadership aligns those activities in one direction. So fundamentally, every single time you're

[16:48] considering bringing someone into an organization, and this is what we're thinking about, like,

[16:52] either you are the person getting brought into the organization or you're the person the own

[16:55] the organization. But we're talking about the point one wealthiest percent of people. And this is how they

[16:59] think, which is that every new person needs to support either selling more people or making them

[17:04] worth more through making the product better. Because the sad truth of it is that every new hire is a

[17:10] guaranteed cost, but is not a guaranteed return. And so unless they are building or selling,

[17:15] they must support the activity of building or selling or they are waste. And to give you a

[17:20] classic example that's been touted a lot is Steve Jobs, the late great Steve Jobs, was a very good

[17:26] leader. Now, a lot of people say that he was tough, but they say that they did the best work of

[17:30] their lives when they worked with him. And so it's commonly stated that Steve Jobs didn't build the

[17:35] iPhone. He built the team that built the iPhone. And this is why it's such a high leverage skill.

[17:40] And this is why it's a skill that the point one percent, if you look at the top of the Forbes list,

[17:44] all have this. That's fundamentally why it's the third bucket of the the biggest skills that

[17:50] generate the most money. But if you're like, huh, is there any other variable that dictates how much

[17:55] the point one percent make? Well, I'm going to give you the advanced one, which is all of this

[18:02] is multiplied by risk, which is the risk that you're willing to take on. And so whether you're an

[18:07] employee of a company or you're an owner of a company, there is a risk that you take on for the

[18:12] building selling and leading activities that you do that generate the economic activity that gives you

[18:17] the percentage of the production out there. If you're willing to take on more risk, this is a

[18:23] multiplier on all of these skills. So if Steve Jobs and I'll give you Steve Jobs a perfect example,

[18:30] when Steve Jobs had the company when it originally went public, he owned 15 percent of the business.

[18:35] He ended up leaving for a period of time starting Pixar and then he came back like 10 years later.

[18:39] When he came back, he was gifted a much smaller percentage of the company. Now, here's where it's crazy.

[18:46] When he originally, IPO'd Apple, he had 15 percent. If he had not sold those shares,

[18:54] that 15 percent today would be worth 465 billion, making him by far the richest man in the

[19:00] world had he lived to this point and kept his shares. And so the reason that he was never the

[19:05] richest man in the world is because when he sold his shares, he gave up a lot of his risk.

[19:10] He gave up a lot of his upside. Bill Gates to the same degree when he IPO'd had about 49 percent

[19:18] of Microsoft. Now, if Bill Gates had continued to double down on that risk, rather than selling

[19:24] and diversifying, which is what he did, today Bill Gates would be worth 1.5 trillion dollars.

[19:29] He would be more than a trillionaire. But because he chose to diversify, he decreased his risk.

[19:36] And so he got less on the asset that he owned, which was built through building selling and leading.

[19:41] If this video is helping make things click for you, which is, okay, I want to make the most

[19:47] money humanly possible. I want to model the point 1 percent. And I understand that I have to build,

[19:54] I have to sell, I have to lead, and I multiply all of that by the amount of risk that I'm willing

[19:57] to take on. If you know somebody else in your organization, or you want to share this with your

[20:03] employees, it would mean the world to me because I'm trying to make the world a better place through

[20:07] economic activity. And I believe that fundamentally every economy in the world could be super developed

[20:13] if everyone had enough education skills. So building and selling, that feels relatively straightforward.

[20:18] You learn how to code, you learn how to make a service, or you learn to advertise, you learn how to sell.

[20:22] But how do you learn how to lead? Well, I think an important part of this is learning how to

[20:29] orient, behavior in a specific direction that yields the highest returns. And when I say orient,

[20:35] behavior, I mean the behavior of the people who work for you or work alongside you. And the

[20:41] strongest way that I have been able to get better as a leader is by eliminating wasted communication.

[20:50] And so what that means is both internally amongst themselves, but also for me to them. And so

[20:55] that means that I think the vast majority of people are very ineffective communicators,

[20:59] is that they say many words and most of the times they don't even know what they're saying.

[21:03] And I'll give you an example. So I had a director a couple of days ago who came up to me.

[21:07] And they wanted to reconcile this director as a department. And they said, hey,

[21:13] one of the people my team has basically complained that somebody who's a director of

[21:17] part of mine is doing this issue. And so I said, and I'll tell you the words that they said.

[21:24] They said, I'm here because I want to bridge the gap between this department and this department.

[21:28] And I want to support the growth and the overall initiatives of the business. And all of those

[21:33] sound like wonderful corporate words. But I looked at the person and I said, what do you want

[21:39] to have happen? And they kind of looked at me differently. I said, what behavior are we currently

[21:44] doing that you would like us to stop doing? Or something that we're currently not doing that you

[21:48] would like us to start doing? And so what's interesting is that when that question was post to the

[21:53] individual, they actually didn't have the answer. And so this is very common. It's that someone will

[21:58] know that there is a problem, but they will not come with an intended change in behavior. And so

[22:02] you have to take that extra next step and say, okay, there's a problem. What potential changes in

[22:07] behavior on my team or someone else's would need to occur in order for us to decrease the

[22:13] likelihood that this problem happens again in the future? And so when you frame things from what

[22:17] would I like to occur, what would I like to have happen as a consequence of this conversation?

[22:22] You'll find that many conversations don't need to be had to begin with because most people don't

[22:26] even define that. And so they basically just make face noise at each other for 30 minutes and call

[22:31] but no one actually changes what they do. And so if you don't change what you do as a result of

[22:35] communication, it was wasted. It would literally took effort from both people, time from both

[22:39] people and the no change occurred. And believe it or not, this is the vast majority of people

[22:43] in the vast majority of companies, which is why the biggest threat to big organizations is waste.

[22:47] And so if you want to lead, you need to learn how to communicate clearly what you want someone to do,

[22:55] what you want them to stop doing or what them to do instead. And by defining it in those terms

[23:00] it cuts away a lot of the ambiguity. I had a meeting not that long ago with a different person in

[23:07] the company. And I said, I don't understand what you do. Please explain it to me. Now most people

[23:12] you could imagine would be terrified by this question. But I said, I'm not intending to intimidate you.

[23:16] The point is that I actually don't understand and I'm seeking security. And so one of the first

[23:21] things the individual brought up is I do a lot of this research so that I can better understand XYZ.

[23:26] And I said, what does that change about what we do? And the honest answer was, it hadn't changed

[23:32] anything about what we do. And I said, so then if all of this time that you spend researching,

[23:37] doesn't change our behavior, you don't need to do it. It is a waste of time. And so just like

[23:42] I could measure the temperature in the rooms when I record them and I could measure the temperature

[23:47] of every room that I walk in throughout the day, just because I can measure it doesn't mean that

[23:50] it's going to change anything. And so many people spend a lot of time trying to, quote, understand,

[23:56] but the only way you will get a return on that understanding is by changing what you do.

[24:02] And so finally after several kind of peeling back the layers, I was able to say, you do this.

[24:06] This is what you do. You click these buttons. You do this stuff. Okay. And then all of a sudden the

[24:11] scope of what this person's role was went from this to this. And I was like, these are the

[24:16] only things that drive economic activity. So how do we get you to do more of these things?

[24:20] Do them faster? Do them better. That is the question that we need to answer together. And by doing this,

[24:25] it just melts away a lot of the pretense, a lot of the corporate jargon. And so if you get into

[24:31] a conversation with someone and you don't know what they're saying, don't assume that you are dumb.

[24:36] Assume that no one knows what's going on. And I think that if you seek clarity and you seek truth,

[24:42] then you will ultimately find the best outcomes rather than seeking agreement. And so we started with

[24:48] education at technology. Now we zoomed in at the second layer of the individuals. What the actual

[24:53] point 1% wealthiest people did. They zoom in on their skills of building products that people love,

[25:00] being able to communicate the value of that products and sell them on buying it and using it.

[25:05] And then leading the team of people that could help do that at scale over and over and over again.

[25:10] And if you're like, well, which one of these should I start with? Well, everyone starts on a

[25:14] different BSL path. Now, I personally started with selling because it's a chicken and egg issue.

[25:21] At the very beginning, you must have something to sell. As soon as you have a basic amount of

[25:25] something to sell, then you must sell it. Once you do this well, then you have to recruit people to

[25:31] help you out. So then you will learn leadership. And so this trisable continue to expand as you get

[25:36] better and better and better at all three of the tripod skills. So if you're starting from scratch,

[25:41] you first have to figure out what to sell. Once you figure out what to sell, you need to learn

[25:45] how to sell it. No economic activity can occur without both of these things. You can't sell nothing

[25:51] and you can't build a not sell. A dollar must exchange for goods and services. So they have to know

[25:56] about it and you have to have something to exchange. And so obsessing over your logo and your branding

[26:01] and your website is neither of these things unless you're selling the websites. Right? And so you want to

[26:08] just start on how do I get people's attention so that they can give me their contact information

[26:13] so that I can communicate with them and explain the value of the thing I have. And then what is

[26:18] required for me to deliver that thing I have? The first business I ever started, I just gave people

[26:23] my email on my phone number and then I emailed them personalized nutrition plans and workout plans.

[26:28] So I had no CRM, I had no website, I just did those two things. If you are a business owner

[26:35] at some point your business will get limited by either the quality of your product or the product

[26:40] offerings you have, your ability to sell them, meaning you don't have enough people coming in the door

[26:46] or you have both of these okay but you can't seem to scale it because you need more people.

[26:50] And so being able to properly identify which of these things is the constraint will tell you where

[26:55] you need to reinvest your time to get more out of yourself. And then when you do that you expand

[27:01] the lever and then more money shoots out. So how does build sell lead relate to education technology?

[27:08] Well the educational components fairly straightforward, you develop the skills around each of these

[27:11] three but what about technology? Well if you can use technology in order to build more things faster

[27:18] then you will make more money. If the thing that you build is technological and allows

[27:23] more people to use it then you will make more money. If somebody builds a table they will make less

[27:29] money than a developer who knows how to make an app that a million people can use because they're

[27:33] able to provide value at scale just with their own skill set but it's the skill of using technology.

[27:39] So these things are very much inner-woven. With sales sure you can sell one on one but the

[27:44] leveraged way of doing is using technology. If you can develop a personal brand and have trust

[27:49] with a larger audience then you can sell one to many. If you run advertisements one to many

[27:53] you're using the technology of the platform and media so that you can get more people's attention

[27:58] and then ultimately convert it from a leadership perspective. If you can track what your employees

[28:04] you're doing if you run a project management systems you can increase the output per employee

[28:09] by using technologies around leadership. In each of these core pillars of value creation

[28:15] you're going to have the education to use the technology to maximize your output per unit of time

[28:22] and ultimately the money that you make which is what the point one percent do. And so with the

[28:27] advent of things like co-pilot for coders coders can actually write code 10 times faster than they

[28:33] could before. And so with that as our working model anybody who is not using technologies

[28:40] always can be at a disadvantage. And so if you want to be in the top point one percent it means you're

[28:43] competing with everyone. And so you want to use as many advantages as you can. And on a personal note

[28:48] I would say that I have been someone who's been more hesitant to use technology and I think that

[28:53] it has been a limiter to my success. And so it's something that I'm spending more and more time on

[28:59] of okay how can I incorporate more technology into the products and services that we build?

[29:04] How can I incorporate more technology into how we advertise and sell? How can I incorporate more

[29:08] technology into how we lead recruit managed people even on the recruiting side? It's like if we

[29:12] can have predictive analytics to figure out which candidates have higher likelihood of matching

[29:16] with the organization and being good long-term productive employees then that decrease so much waste

[29:21] for us. And again it increases our appropriate unit of time. And the coolest thing about

[29:26] education specifically not necessarily technology is that when you have these skills they cannot

[29:31] be taken away. They can't be confiscated. They can't be stolen. And this is near near to my heart because

[29:37] my family was who we are around in. But during the revolution we left the country and all of our

[29:44] assets were seized. And so in the United States it seems like a crazy thing that you could lose everything

[29:49] overnight. But another country just happens all the time. The government just says oh all that money is

[29:53] ours now all that land is ours now your house is actually our house now. But the thing is is that the

[29:57] family members that I had who had skills and then were able to scatter all over the world which my

[30:02] family is they were able to start all over again and rebuild what they had lost. The ones who

[30:08] didn't have skills and only had the few assets they had struggled a lot. And still due to this day.

[30:15] So the first layer was global and we figured out education technology. Underneath of education

[30:20] technology it's like where we investing that education technology technology around building,

[30:25] education around building, technology around selling, education around selling, technology around

[30:29] leadership, education around leadership. And so in each of those settings if we invest in them

[30:35] the lever expands and more money shoots out the other side. And so the final layer is environmental.

[30:40] So BSL creates the money and then that money is either wasted. So it goes off the map.

[30:48] It's stored meaning it basically stays the same or what the top point 1% do is it's multiplied.

[30:55] And the way that they multiply it is either by stuff or they lend. So you can only do two things

[31:02] with money. You can give it to people and then they give you a little bit more of it back in the form

[31:07] of debt or you buy stuff with it that either goes up in value. Sometimes you can go down.

[31:12] But the hope is that it goes up in value and it produces an output. So an example of the storage would

[31:18] be I buy a brick of gold. A brick of gold does nothing and it's speculative in that we hope that

[31:23] somebody else in the future will pay us more for that brick of gold. And no matter what currency I have

[31:27] I can trade gold for euros I can trade gold for for Bitcoin I can trade gold for US dollars.

[31:32] It doesn't matter it's a store of value and as far as we've had in human history people still

[31:36] value gold. Now you could take all of the gold in the world and this is a warm buffet example.

[31:42] You could take all the gold in the world and put it in the middle of a baseball field and it would

[31:46] be about as tall as the stadium and be a big round globe. It doesn't matter what you do to that

[31:51] big ball of gold a hundred years or not it'll still be a big ball of gold. But if you took that

[31:56] same amount of economic value and then you put it you would be and you invested it through buying.

[32:03] You could buy all the farmland in the United States and about 13 Exxon mobiles. And so the amount of money

[32:09] that those farms and Exxon mobile would spit out every single year over that hundred years would be

[32:15] at least greater than zero. And so in that way this is how this loop of wealth gets spun.

[32:21] And so when you are buying or lending you're either lending to people who are doing BSL and the

[32:26] risk that you incur is that they don't actually succeed and you never get your money back.

[32:31] You're compensated for the risk based on the interest that you charge for them. So you basically

[32:36] sell them money for more money later. With buying the assets what you're doing is your buying a

[32:44] percentage or the entirety of their build sell lead. Now if you were called earlier I said this is

[32:51] all multiplied by risk. This is where that money goes. You take on that risk. And so as a result

[32:58] you get to have an outsized percentage of what other people are doing to build sell and lead.

[33:04] And then this gives you even more money over time. And so in understanding this this is why I

[33:14] built acquisition.com the way I did which is we have these companies that generate money.

[33:21] And then that money either goes back into the company to make it a bigger company or it goes into buying

[33:30] another company that generates money. But then this process repeats itself over and over again

[33:38] and it compounds unto itself. So no matter how big you get you can keep reinvesting all of that

[33:45] money and then it's a percentage based growth. So whether it's a million dollars growing by 10% or a

[33:50] billion dollars growing by 10% you're still growing 10% but the absolute amount of what that 10% is

[33:55] is a hundred thousand dollars versus a hundred million dollars. And so if you're the individual

[34:01] you can take this money and you can invest it in people who are going to do build sell lead

[34:07] in your company where you take on more risk which means that you get outsized returns on the

[34:11] investment in the people that's within an organization. You can buy a slice of an organization

[34:15] of all of those people and not have to necessarily do anything that's what the public markets are

[34:19] more or less all about or investment funds do or at the most micro level you could just take that

[34:25] money and invest it in yourself by buying skills. And what does buying skills even mean? It means

[34:31] you pay someone to give you feedback on an activity such that you can replicate the outcome

[34:37] that they can already do. Fundamentally that's what buying skills is. And so you find someone who

[34:41] has the skill that you want and then you offer them money so that you can continue to do the

[34:47] activity in front of them until eventually you replicate the outcome that they have because they

[34:51] have taught you the variables that they use to recreate that skill. And once you can do it without them

[34:57] and get the same outcome then you have learned. And so if we're thinking about this in terms of levels

[35:02] you can have a piece of a company. You can have people that you hire in a company

[35:16] or you can put that money into yourself. But all three of these are going to relate to

[35:23] BSL, build, sell, bleed. And to what degree is the risk that you take on? So buying a piece of

[35:33] a company would be probably higher risk. A little bit less risk would be bringing somebody in and

[35:37] paying them. The lowest risk is going to be investing in yourself. But here's where it gets kind of

[35:42] interesting. Is that when you invest in yourself this can also give you all of the skills that you need

[35:48] to do all of these things better. Which is why and I will continue to hit this until the day I die,

[35:53] you will always be the best investment. And so you want to max out this bucket to the

[35:57] greatest degree possible. And the limitation that you will have when you do reinvest in yourself

[36:02] is the time it takes to learn the skills and how many skills you can learn. But at any given time

[36:08] you should always be spending as much money as you can to buy the most valuable skill that is

[36:13] constraining your growth. And so if you look at build, you look at sell, you look at lead, you figure

[36:18] out the one that's limiting you the most and you put as much cash into that thing as you can. You pay

[36:22] every expert you possibly know or don't know or need to know in order to get what you need to

[36:27] move forward. If I could isolate one decision that has changed my life forever was the willingness

[36:32] to invest my money in the potential to learn a skill from someone who is further ahead than me.

[36:39] And I will probably do that till the day I die because I have gotten better returns on that

[36:46] money than anything else in the world. And if you enjoyed this video and with a 0.1% wealthiest

[36:52] people invest their time in money into, then you're going to love the video that I made on leverage.

[36:58] It's the number one video on my channel. It's basically how to go through a wealth warplough time. It was

[37:01] one of the first presentations I made before I became public. Basically a consolidation of many

[37:06] of the thoughts that I had that created the generational wealth that my wife and I have been able to

[37:09] experience. I hope you enjoyed.

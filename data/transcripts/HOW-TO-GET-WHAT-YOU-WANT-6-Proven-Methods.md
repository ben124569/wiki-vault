[00:00] You can get anything you want in life if you can get other people to get it for you, which makes persuasion among the highest leveraged skills in the world.

[00:06] Tons of research has been done on how to become more persuasive.

[00:09] And I have to give my nod to Robert Kaldini the go, which we made most research accessible to the masses in his book Influence.

[00:15] What I want to do is show you the most effective ways I applied his methods in my own business that now do over $200 million a year in combined revenue.

[00:22] Tool number one is reciprocity.

[00:24] I try to get in contact with Arnold Schwarzenegger when I was running gym lunch, but I thought it would make a lot of sense.

[00:28] I wanted him to endorse my book. That was like my whole goal.

[00:31] Turns out nothing worked. It also turns out Arnold doesn't really care.

[00:34] But in order to get as a tentuant, Leyla and I did was he donated a million dollars to his charity.

[00:38] And then we ended up sitting down with Arnold.

[00:40] Multiple times.

[00:41] When you show kindness and generosity towards others, they're more likely to return the favor and like you as a result.

[00:47] The gift you have to do is proportional to the person you're trying to give to.

[00:50] So for example, if you pay for your friends lunch, that person now feels obligated to return the favor.

[00:54] They're like, hey, I'll get the next one, right?

[00:56] And it's the same reason that outside of a retail store as soon as you come in, they offer you cold water.

[01:01] It's not because they're nice people. It's because they know that you'll feel indebted to them and be more likely to a stay longer,

[01:06] be listening to them and see ultimately buy.

[01:08] I imagine how much it costs a store owner to give everybody who walks in the door a water.

[01:11] I don't know.

[01:12] $5 a day.

[01:13] And if they get one person to buy extra a week off of that, which they probably get a lot more,

[01:17] is that worth the investment?

[01:19] It's probably the highest return on investment thing and is in to higher business.

[01:22] Now, Kield, he gives a really beautiful example of how to leverage this in business.

[01:26] He shows an example for a waiter.

[01:28] So if a waiter puts up a mint on the bill, they get three percent more tips, right?

[01:32] People get something and they're more likely to tip them a little bit more.

[01:36] The waiter gives the person two minutes.

[01:38] All of a sudden, the tips increased by 14 percent.

[01:41] And the third way they did the waiter example was that the person put him in down,

[01:44] walked away, turned around, and put another mint on the table.

[01:48] And that created a 23 percent increase in tips.

[01:50] It's worth paying $5 a month for a big bag of mint just to make sure you get paid.

[01:55] But the thing is, is that in business, there are tons of these five dollar mint bags that are laying around.

[02:00] That you can immediately implement a zero in business.

[02:02] Years ago, I actually had this done to me and I saw the effect that it was wild.

[02:06] So there was this guy that I thought was a complete weirdo.

[02:08] Whenever I saw him, he would try and ask me like a hundred questions.

[02:10] So he was local to where I was, he was in like some entrepreneur works.

[02:12] And he would just like try and corner me now.

[02:14] I was like, dude, just get away from me.

[02:15] Eventually I had to confront him and be like, stop talking to me.

[02:18] Like go away.

[02:19] And so what happened is he was so ashamed of the whole experience.

[02:22] Whatever he started sending me gifts every single month.

[02:25] So I'm talking about like 500,000 audits every month, like Casco Nive.

[02:28] And like clothing, which was kind of weird, but it was expensive.

[02:31] We'll let him stuff anyways.

[02:32] For nine months, he said, I mean, birthday cakes that were custom made.

[02:35] And I just got like, was wild.

[02:36] After a while, I just started feeling bad because he just kept sending them.

[02:39] And he's saying like, so sorry.

[02:40] I hope everything's awesome.

[02:41] Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

[02:42] Now I was like, you know what?

[02:43] Maybe I just saw him the wrong way.

[02:44] And I was just like, got him off on the wrong foot.

[02:46] Even though I knew what he was doing, it still worked.

[02:49] And I ended up going out to meet him again.

[02:51] Turns out, still a weirdo.

[02:52] And so that's to show you how powerful this stuff is.

[02:54] You can just start by giving people free gum when you're in class, which is the first time I learned it when I was in middle school.

[02:59] People weren't as mean to me when I gave them gum earlier that day.

[03:01] And so it was tiny little thing that cost me almost nothing.

[03:03] They made my life in middle school a little bit easier.

[03:05] Tool number two is consistency.

[03:06] We judge people based on their actions.

[03:08] All right, consistency can be used in persuasion by asking someone to public commit to an idea or action.

[03:12] A public can be just in front of you, but it can also be widely to the world.

[03:15] If I said, hey, are you the type person who like takes action and is willing to invest in themselves?

[03:19] If someone says yes, then later on, if I say, hey,

[03:22] since you're the type person who's really willing to take action and really likes to invest in themselves,

[03:26] then I think this is perfect for you.

[03:28] Boom.

[03:29] And then I can make the ass because I just reminded them twice of the commitments they made earlier,

[03:33] and I'm asking them to be consistent with those later during the close.

[03:36] So there's a famous research that they did where they asked people in an neighborhood to put up a little sign that said,

[03:40] please drive slowly.

[03:41] When they asked people to put a massive sign on their front yard that said,

[03:44] please drive slowly.

[03:45] Most people didn't comply with that request.

[03:47] But when they asked people to put a tiny little sign in their window,

[03:50] the size of a no-car that said, please drive slowly.

[03:53] And then two weeks later, they sent them a letter that said, hey,

[03:56] since you are a type of person who's so pro-safety for the neighborhood,

[03:59] would you be willing to put a much bigger sign to save more lives?

[04:03] Guess what?

[04:05] Way more people said yes after saying the first yes,

[04:08] because they voluntarily identified as a certain type of person.

[04:11] And the researchers got them to remain consistent with the commitment that they had made.

[04:15] And so if you want to get the big yes, sometimes you get the smallest first.

[04:18] This is why lead magnets and front end offers tend to work well

[04:21] to get people to ultimately buy a much bigger thing later.

[04:24] Tool number three is social proof.

[04:26] People look to other people for cues about how to behave or what to believe.

[04:29] And this is how we learn to be human.

[04:31] So little kids, we just look at other people and we say, all do what they do,

[04:34] because that's what humans do.

[04:35] And then you start becoming human.

[04:36] If you see something on Amazon, it has 5,000 5 star reviews.

[04:39] You're way more likely to buy it.

[04:41] Amazon does this stuff because it knows it gets people to take action.

[04:43] And so if you've ever heard a laugh track on a show,

[04:46] it's like, ha ha in the background, people then laugh more than if there is no laugh track,

[04:50] which is wild.

[04:51] We are so conditioned to behave in accordance with how everyone else does,

[04:55] that that laugh track persuades us,

[04:57] gets us to do something they want us to do, which is laugh better than anything else.

[05:01] And so here's how I used it in my own businesses.

[05:03] I printed out every single 5 star review guy got online.

[05:06] For if you have a brick and mortar location, this is where it kills.

[05:09] Is that you look at all your yelper views and you screenshot every single one of them.

[05:12] So I screenshot it all of them and I framed every one of them.

[05:14] So that floor to ceiling, my lobby, was 5 star reviews.

[05:18] And then the other half was before and after pictures.

[05:20] Because imagine a world where someone says, hey, Alex, I don't think you can help me lose weight.

[05:24] Now I just look around the room and be like, really?

[05:27] And then I would say, how much proof would you need to believe?

[05:30] And at what point is your requirement for proof more and more reasonable than the amount of proof I have?

[05:34] And that crushes their belief of whether or not they could do it,

[05:37] or at least that I was good enough to do it.

[05:39] Tool number four, liking or what people would like to call it, report.

[05:42] People like people who like them or they perceive as friends.

[05:45] And the more you like someone, the more likely they are to say,

[05:48] ask you.

[05:49] And so the like in principle, states that people are more likely to be persuaded by those that they like and want to be like.

[05:52] And the second part is important.

[05:54] And even at a research study to test this, they told people that they paid strangers to compliment them.

[05:59] They then got complimented by a stranger who they knew were getting paid to compliment them.

[06:03] And guess what?

[06:04] They still like them more than strangers they did.

[06:06] And so even if you know what someone's doing, it still works.

[06:10] And they also found out that there's actually no cap to how much flattery someone will take.

[06:15] Provided it's genuine.

[06:16] And here's how I've tried to use this in persuasion.

[06:18] So I always use the ACA framework.

[06:20] They acknowledge what they say compliment what they did about what they said.

[06:23] And then ask another question.

[06:24] You can get basically anybody to like you in a sales conversation or in a social situation.

[06:28] Egnology what they just said because it shows they're listening and paying attention to them because the thing that people like more than anything that they pay.

[06:33] People hundreds of dollars in there or two is just to listen to them talk.

[06:36] See, you compliment them on what they just said and how it ties to them being a great person in some positive attribute.

[06:42] And then you ask them the next question to move them down the conversation.

[06:44] And so the way that I actually was able to keep my spirit tied because if you are ever front facing in a role,

[06:49] whether it's customer service or it sales or anything, you get tired.

[06:52] And so what I did was that I actually bought a mini trampoline and I put it next to my desk and so I would meet with people.

[06:57] And I was doing 20 plus consults a day in person.

[07:00] And I would be bouncing on this trampoline and they would look at me like a psychopath,

[07:03] people would close more because I like this guy set you go.

[07:05] You cannot be in a bad mood and on a trampoline.

[07:07] And when I didn't have the trampoline before that I actually used to do a cartwheel every single time before I shook someone's hand when they walk in my gym.

[07:13] So imagine walking the gym.

[07:14] Some guy to the cartwheel and is like, hey, welcome to your night fitness.

[07:17] Nice to meet you.

[07:18] Food crack up.

[07:19] You're like, who is this guy?

[07:20] But you know what you did after that?

[07:21] You give me money.

[07:22] Because you liked me automatically.

[07:23] Even if someone was a sour pus, I could still turn the mood around because what they ultimately wanted to buy was the feeling that I was giving them during the conversation.

[07:29] Persuasion till number five is authority.

[07:31] Think about a man who can tell the president of the United States to drop his trousers and stick his finger up his ass.

[07:38] Well, proctologists can do that whenever they want because they're a doctor and in the doctor's office, they are the authority.

[07:45] If Warren Buffett gives you investment advice, you can move on it fast because you just trust that he's right.

[07:49] Even if his advice is the same as a high school teacher.

[07:51] The reason it's so powerful is not because what an authority says is actually more persuasive in terms of the actual words they say.

[07:58] But because people put up fewer filters and accept more things is truth, which means it has more persuasive ability independent of the message.

[08:05] As soon as you find a trusted source, what do you do?

[08:07] You just listen to it.

[08:08] Right?

[08:09] Which is why mentors are so valuable because it actually decreases our speed to decision making and getting action done.

[08:12] Which is why we seek out mentors to begin with, which is maybe why you watch stuff on YouTube.

[08:15] What do you have to do to this?

[08:16] You show to plum as credentials awards, etc.

[08:18] And you're a track record, which is if you followed my channel at all, all I talk about is building your life resume and having a track record to stand on rather than puffing your chest and having lots of charisma.

[08:26] Instead, you're saying, you can believe me because of what I've done, not what I'm telling you I'm going to do.

[08:31] But on top of that, if you had third party accreditation, I printed out certifications for myself and everyone on my trainers.

[08:37] Because people would come to be like, well, are your trainers certified?

[08:39] I would say like, one, which ones do you want?

[08:41] They would never have any idea.

[08:42] And two, I would say all of my trainers are double or triple certified.

[08:45] Mind you, certifications are not accredited in the United States.

[08:48] Meaning I could have 10 certifications that I certified them myself.

[08:52] No, no, I did pay for my trainers to get certified through actual ones,

[08:56] but I also internally certified them, so they had more authority.

[08:59] Persuasive tool number six, scarcity and urgency.

[09:02] Urgency is a function of time, so promotion ends tomorrow.

[09:05] Scarecies, as a function of units, I only have 100 of them left.

[09:08] People value what is scarce.

[09:09] The reason gold is inherently valuable versus a rock is that there's just less of it.

[09:14] The reason to be here is become this diamond conglomerate.

[09:17] Even though rubies and sapphires are actually rare, then diamonds, as they own all the diamonds, they keep them in vaults.

[09:21] Just so that they can keep the scarcity high enough on the diamonds they fetch a premium price.

[09:26] And so the way that you implement this in persuasion is that you use limits.

[09:30] Limited time, limited supply, one time offers to create the perception of scarcity.

[09:34] The other way to doing is talking loss language.

[09:36] So instead of like, don't you want to get?

[09:38] It's you don't want to miss out on.

[09:40] Different way of framing the same concept.

[09:42] People have more loss of version than they have desired a game.

[09:44] So if you've seen Chanel or Gucci or Prada or whatever, they actually don't tell the stores how much of any item they'll send.

[09:49] They'll have a new spring line and they'll send one or two or three perses.

[09:54] And they won't tell the store how many they're going to send.

[09:56] In a real way, the sales people have the same concept of urgency.

[09:59] They probably figured it out at corporate, that even if they said, hey,

[10:02] say that we don't have that many perses, the sales people actually got more in the back.

[10:05] And so they just actually control the whole thing, essentially.

[10:08] They only send them and they're like, I don't know when I'm going to get the next one in.

[10:10] Or if I'm going to get another one in at all.

[10:11] But then they took it even further.

[10:13] And during COVID, if you saw it, there were lines out the door because there's like one person in one person.

[10:17] Now, you know what stores kept that?

[10:18] Well, everyone else let it go.

[10:19] The fancy stores because they want to hold a scarce resource.

[10:22] They want to show that there's tons of demand.

[10:24] That's a little bit of social proof.

[10:25] You have to be special.

[10:26] It's exclusive in order to get in.

[10:28] The key to doing this is not being fake.

[10:30] I don't know how to say this to you differently besides trust me.

[10:33] If you actually put true scarcity on something, you will sell more.

[10:37] So if you can handle 20 people a week in your business or you have X amount of product,

[10:42] tell people your limits.

[10:43] The reason Amazon still says 23 left in stock is because they know that more people will buy it.

[10:48] If they see that there's limits.

[10:49] So if I said, hey, I can continue a thousand customers smart.

[10:51] You probably couldn't take them.

[10:52] So just be explicit about how many of left and you'll actually sell more.

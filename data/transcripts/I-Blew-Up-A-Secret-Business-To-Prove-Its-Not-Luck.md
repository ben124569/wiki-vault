[00:00] This fashion style is making 300,000 a year, but leaving millions on the table.

[00:04] So here's how we fix the three course use in her business and how you can apply the same

[00:08] tactics to scale yours. My name is Alex Ramosi, I run acquisition.com, a portfolio of companies

[00:12] that last year did over $250 million in aggregate revenue. So let's dive in. To hear the

[00:16] quick facts, you need to know who does she sell to? Rich folks, what is she sell them? Fashion

[00:20] design and advice for their personal style? How much is she making? 390,000 per profit last year?

[00:26] 130,000 that's 42% margins. The number of customers she showed her lifetime is over

[00:29] thousand, so kind of impressive. And then this is her model. She sells an $8,500, 60 day kind of

[00:34] onboarding transformation where she picks new colors and palates and all that kind of stuff,

[00:38] and then she rotates them into a $2,000 per month or $45 per quarter on going style thing.

[00:43] Plus, she gets a fillet commission because if they buy clothing through her, she gets 10% of the

[00:47] purchase price. That's how she makes her money. Let's dive in. So a problem number one,

[00:50] Ashley had a leaky funnel. She has a premium offer, a good close rate, and customers who love her work.

[00:55] But when I looked at her funnel, it was pretty much not existing. She was sending paid

[00:59] cold traffic to a form with no headline, value proposition, or reason often. There was just a

[01:04] get more info, but here's the wild part. Despite all that, she was still getting customers,

[01:09] which told me the quality of her service was probably pretty strong. And so the bottleneck

[01:12] was her conversion rate. Basically, the number of clicks that actually turned into customers.

[01:16] And so the numbers actually backed up that hypothesis. But she was getting about 1,800 clicks

[01:20] and turning those 1,800 clicks only into 8 sales. A huge leak in her process. 0.4% conversion

[01:28] to traffic with high intent. Everettism is falling into two categories. You have interruption

[01:32] based and then you have intent based. Interruption based is everything that you see that you're

[01:36] not looking for. So if you're on social media and you see an ad, you didn't start that

[01:39] debut like you know what I wanted an ad for a new pillow. No, you just see the ad that's interruption

[01:43] based. So television, radio, social media, online banner ads, all of that stuff is just

[01:49] interruption. Intent is where you initiate it. So you start to look for it. That's usually when you

[01:54] search for things. You might call it friends and get referrals like those are high intent customers

[01:58] or at least high intent prospects. And you want to have very different metrics that you

[02:02] track separately. For each of those things. And one of the biggest mistakes that I think

[02:05] business and business bank is no one will blend that and try to understand their business,

[02:08] which you have to keep that separate because there's two different people who need two different

[02:11] processes and sometimes two different products. Sometimes people don't know if their stuff's

[02:14] good they're like, oh man, I think I'm doing terribly, but they're comparing their

[02:17] co-traffic metrics to their warm, or high intent traffic metrics and vice versa. The good

[02:22] news is we didn't really need to change what she was selling because she was converting a

[02:25] high percent edge and she has decent price points. So I'm not upset about that part. We just had to

[02:28] make it easier for people to buy. So this is what we did. So we made four core changes. Step one is

[02:33] we added a lead magnet. And think through all the different versions of what could we give away

[02:37] for free to get people to more interested because if you just say hey get more info number one

[02:40] not very compelling. Number two, that goes from like zero to let's sleep together. And so sure she

[02:44] had a high close rate but she was also dealing with the people who were like in desperate need.

[02:48] But there's so many other buyers, the 80 percent or more of buyers who like just give me a little bit

[02:53] first before I take the next step. That's where the lead magnet comes in. And I think this is a huge

[02:57] misunderstanding for a lot of businesses because like people think I'm going to give something like

[03:00] free I'm going to solve their problem. It doesn't work like that at all. If you do it right,

[03:02] what you do is you solve a very narrow problem that then reveals the next problem that you solve for

[03:06] the thing you sell. If I were to say hey come by my thing, I might get one out of 100 people to buy.

[03:10] But if I say hey you have this problem here's a free thing and then I might get 10 people to

[03:14] try my free thing. But then of those 10 people I can get three of them to buy. So I triple my sales

[03:18] by adding some sort of value prior to making my real money ask. And if you think what is content content

[03:23] is in some ways hundreds and thousands of tiny little lead magnets that you get for free without

[03:27] someone even having to opt in so that you can basically give a pre lead magnet to the lead magnet

[03:33] and so we can lubricate this entire process top to bottom. So what we did is we created a style

[03:37] assessment offer. Basically a personalized consult based on skin tone, body type and lifestyle.

[03:42] And somebody who's rich and feels like their status doesn't match the way they dress and cares about

[03:46] that obviously I care about that because my style is impeccable. The thing that makes a great lead

[03:50] mix I don't want you to take it like should I use a style assessment? No let me tell you that the

[03:53] pieces that make a greatly mega fast. Easy, narrow solves one complete problem. So I'll tell you

[04:00] my favorite lead magnet all the time I just remember this the other day so I'll tell you. So I saw

[04:04] this in the dating space. Is that how to know if a girl wants you to kiss her on a day? That's a

[04:08] huge need for a guy if he's on a date. But he doesn't want to be seen like a weirdo right? So

[04:12] there's huge pain that he's avoiding and great promise of if the she does like you you get a kiss.

[04:17] So like literally such great polar stakes for learning this one thing. So what they reveal and the

[04:22] lead magnet is I'll give you the answer is you try and brush her hair behind her ear if you do that

[04:28] and then she rolls her hand into or doesn't at least move her head away from her hand.

[04:31] Then you've got a girl who's okay with you kissing her on the flip side. If you reach for her

[04:35] she just moves your head back she probably doesn't want you to kiss her. Now I would also

[04:38] encourage you to not surprise the tech because most people would just move away anyways. Always get

[04:43] consent guys. Let's talk about why it works. So instead of perceived value especially for high-end clients

[04:48] who don't want a DIY checklist right these are high-end concierge they want a taste of that

[04:53] concierge experience. So the best thing we can do is let them try it out a little bit. Let them ride the

[04:56] bike. Let me tell you the action steps for you so you can actually do this in your emphasis. So this is from

[05:00] the hundred-but-dollar leads page 45. If you're struggling to get leads make an amazing lead magnet.

[05:04] Figure out the problem that you want to solve for the right customer. Figure out how you want to solve it.

[05:08] Figure out how to deliver it. Make the name interesting and clear. Make it easy to consume. Make sure

[05:14] it's actually good and this one like I still don't get this like they're like they put their trash

[05:17] as their lead magnet. I'm like 99% of people are never gonna buy anything for me out. You want the

[05:21] marketplace to judge you on your worst thing. I have now on average spent two years per book that I've

[05:26] written which is basically the lead magnet for my business. It's important. You don't need to give

[05:31] your lead magnet to everyone and this is something that Ashley brought up when we were talking

[05:34] about this. She said I don't want to give every time to can Harry for you personalized dial assessment.

[05:37] And I was like you're right. You don't want to do that. So when we're going to give someone this

[05:41] lead magnet which doesn't have to be automated. So people have this assumption like oh it has to be

[05:44] an e-book. It has to be a free video. It has to be a book. It doesn't even have to be a book. You can have

[05:48] a service as a lead magnet. All you do though is it's not for everyone. So in order to qualify for this

[05:54] free thing like there's no rules. We can say who gets this free thing and who doesn't get this

[05:58] free thing. It's America or wherever you live. You're allowed to choose to do business with one

[06:03] person or another. Say if you meet these qualifications then I will give you this free thing because

[06:06] you're a highly-cleanative. I would have given you a ride in my free jet if I want you to buy a private

[06:11] jet if you can't afford a private jet. There's no point. There's no way you can convert. So it's just

[06:14] pure cost for me. Not a good idea. And so the big four I always look for budget authority need timing.

[06:19] Do they have the money? Do they have the authority to make the decision? Do they actually want this

[06:22] thing and it's now a good time. If I get those four answers prior and they say yes to all four,

[06:26] now I've got a good qualified prospect. The first thing we did to fix the funnel is we gave something

[06:30] more valuable for someone to take a step with rather than get more into. So the second thing we did

[06:34] is we will be installed a VSL. So what is a VSL? VSL is a video sales letter which is just a fancy way

[06:40] of saying you you fill them yourself doing your kind of your best pitch. VSL is can vary in length

[06:45] depending on the nature of the traffic, the price point of the thing that they're selling and the sales

[06:48] process that follows. So the three piece for us in terms of making an acquisition process can be

[06:53] product, prospect, process. What are we selling? Who are we selling it to? How are we going to sell it?

[06:57] For her thing, she's going to be pre-framing this style assessment to then upsell on that call

[07:02] into remained thing. I didn't expect, especially given the nature of the traffic that she had

[07:06] which was high intent, that she would really need more than call it a three to seven minute video

[07:10] before the call. Explaining the offer, setting expectations, and this filters out bad leads and

[07:16] presales good ones. The reason preselling is important, especially as you scale, is that you want to

[07:21] always shorten sales cycles. For example, it takes you two calls to close prospects on average.

[07:26] If you can take that from two calls to one call, you can double your sales with the same size

[07:31] team. So it makes you more efficient per sales person that you hire. And some of you guys have three

[07:36] and four call sales processes that absolutely can get cut from four to two or sometimes even one.

[07:42] If you add in these pre-selling components, because, functionally, this is the belief that I would

[07:46] encourage you to adopt. It only takes a moment to make a decision. What takes prior to that decision

[07:51] is the information required to make the decision. When you have four calls or six calls or three calls

[07:55] in order to make a decision, it's because it takes that much information or you're

[07:59] inefficiently delivering that mission information. And so we have to think, what are the core

[08:04] elements of all three or four or five or six calls? Whatever it is that it takes you currently to close

[08:08] prospect. And when I say calls, this could be conversations, it could be emails, whatever it is that

[08:12] you communicate with people on. How can we take the most salient elements, bring them all to the front,

[08:16] and have everyone watch it so that when you start your sales conversation, you start with somebody who

[08:20] already knows all the main things, and we're really just talking about decision to make a purchase.

[08:25] And so not only can we eliminate or decrease the number of calls from call at three to one call,

[08:29] but we can also take our calls from call at 60 or 90 minute calls to 15 to 20 minute calls. Again,

[08:34] further increasing your efficiency with your sales team. And this is ultimately one of the most

[08:39] high leverage things that you can do in building a sales process. Don't worry, I'm not going to leave

[08:43] you hanging and how do you make a VSL. I'll just give you the quick and dirty. There's obviously

[08:46] more to this, but I'll just give you the things that can get you started. And I will give you this one

[08:49] caveat, which is don't obsess. I would spend so long on the lead magnet that I wouldn't even get it out.

[08:55] I spent so long on my VSL that I wouldn't even do it. You want to make it good, but you want to make it.

[09:01] It being made is it being posted, it being live. Now here's the cool part. You can always make it better.

[09:05] You can always make it better. You can always make it better. You can always revisit it.

[09:07] There's no VSL that I think that is active in any company that I own right now. I'm just thinking

[09:11] about how my head don't make it a major claim here, but I'm pretty sure that is the first version.

[09:15] We make it. We listen to the objections that come up on sales calls, and then we add those objections in,

[09:20] and then we listen to more. We add more of those in, and it's really simple. All you do is you record it,

[09:25] and then you just add a cut and afterwards, and say, hey guys, I got to come work on some people.

[09:28] So I figured I answered for you now. Here are the four steps. Number one, review your most

[09:31] comment objections and your sales recordings if you're recording your sales. If you're not, you probably still

[09:34] know what they are. Number two, record you answering those questions as a video. Keep it light. It depends on how

[09:39] depth your thing is, how many requirements on their part. So again, for her high-intent traffic,

[09:44] three, seven minutes works fine. And then make sure it gets sent to every single prospect in the

[09:49] funnel. Here's the little prompts it for you. You want to make sure that they watch the VSL. So how

[09:53] do you make sure they watch the VSL? So the way I like to ask it is, hey, we want to embed it automatically.

[09:58] Now, in that process, we'll still follow a prior to the call. It's a hate, did he can't just

[10:02] get a chance to watch the video. If you're doing a set call that leads into this. So tiny bit different,

[10:06] but like say you called outbound, you can still add a VSL in. You call the person, you set the call,

[10:11] and you say, hey, I'm going to give you a video. Would you rather watch it on your own,

[10:15] on your own time or with us? Now, most people say on my own time. And so then you just give it to them

[10:19] to watch before the call. By giving them that choice, it makes it much softer. I don't know,

[10:23] it just feels better. What happens if you get on a call and somebody didn't watch the video?

[10:27] Didn't watch the VSL's letter. It is my belief that you want to maintain the frame.

[10:30] And this is why I prefer shorter VSL's if whenever possible. Because then you can say, hey,

[10:35] you know what John, we got an hour. So let me give you the video right now. You can watch it,

[10:38] I'll go grab a couple of coffee. I'll be back in seven minutes. And then we can talk about it.

[10:40] That way you don't need to change your scripting because then you have multiple variations of

[10:44] prospects that are coming to you. Some of you watch this, some have it. No, you want to unify and

[10:48] uniform the process as much as possible. So we add a lead magnet to fix the funnel. We added a VSL.

[10:52] The third thing we did was we qualified harder. There are some things that in my entrepreneurial career

[10:58] have continued to be more true over time. They like age like one. One of them is speed over everything

[11:03] across everything in the business. More I'm in business, the more I think about speed for

[11:07] qualifying prospects, the more I think about it for products, the more I think about it for results.

[11:10] I always want to shorten time lengths. Another thing like that is qualifications. We always have

[11:15] this big fear that if we qualify prospects we're going to lose leads. But the thing is that if you

[11:19] don't qualify prospects you're going to waste your time. And what happens is if you qualify well,

[11:23] you actually turn people who are maybe into yeses because they're like, whoa, these guys are legit

[11:28] and they serve people only like me. And so qualification in a way is almost like positioning yourself

[11:33] within a niche, but the niche is qualified customers. Right? And so I said this earlier, but bent

[11:38] is the IBM invented this is not me. Budget authority need timing and we include that in the intake

[11:43] form plus a question about income. And so for her, she didn't have a sales team and she knew

[11:47] that she needed they needed money. And so she asked that question at a time because if they

[11:50] didn't have the money to buy a clothes, they were going to buy her services. She could spot those

[11:53] serious buyers before they even had the conversation. So she could automatically cancel to hate a

[11:57] qualified and that she doesn't have to create a personalized style assessment before talking to them.

[12:01] So it saves her time. Just that for her. She had this funnel what we needed to do is rewrite the headlines.

[12:06] Now if there's ever something to test on your funnel, it's the headlines. 80% of your advertising

[12:11] dollar goes to the first words that someone sees it literally frames the rest of the page. That's

[12:15] why headlines are so important. It's not just that it's compelling or interesting. It literally shifts

[12:19] how every other piece of information is consumed. It's the lens through which they consume her copy.

[12:23] We rewrote the landing page headline and sub-headline to focus on the freebie. Rather than trying

[12:27] to say, hey, come home with me, hey, come marry me. We say, why don't we just get coffee? Why don't

[12:32] we just have a date? Why don't we just meet each other first? What we renamed it was free lookbook

[12:37] to dress for your tone or skin tone using your existing closet. If you're like, how do I make a good

[12:42] headline? It's how to yay without boo even with greatest insecurity. The yay here is the dress for your

[12:46] tone. Also the free lookbook. The using your existing closet is going to be the thing that they're

[12:50] worried about. What's my biggest objection that someone's going to bring up? They're going to be like,

[12:53] well, I don't want to buy whole bunch of stuff. So it's like we want to lower the bar for now to get them

[12:57] on the phone. Free lookbook to dress for your tone using your existing closet. Now, there's no true

[13:03] boo on this one. But I would say that using your existing closet is a combination of big sincerity

[13:07] and the boo. One phrase that kind of combines both. And that would get us way more people to

[13:10] opt in and then ultimately book calls. And so the first thing we did was fix the funnel. And so she was

[13:15] converting barely eight of her 1800 blind clicks before. Now, with this new setup, complete with a

[13:20] lead magnet, a sales video, a real qualification process, and a better headline, she should

[13:24] hopefully convert a lot more. And so the reason we did all this first is so we could be confident

[13:29] our bucket wasn't leaking before we crank the dial on customer acquisition. So she doesn't waste

[13:33] money spending on ads that are going to convert. Ashley is a textbook stage four in the $100

[13:39] million scaling roadmap. So she needs to identify and double down under top 20% of customers. And

[13:45] she needs to make better free stuff to increase your conversion rate. And needs she needs to add

[13:50] qualifications or friction to the extra volume self-selects. So let's just have a look at her handy

[13:55] handy run-up here and see if that's actually what we tell people to do because you know what

[14:00] businesses behave in patterns. They're very similar across industry, across size,

[14:05] because we hit these stages, these are typically the problems that occur. So specialized product

[14:10] price to serve niche down avatar, which we had fixed, make better free stuff and more creative

[14:14] to boost volume. Great, ad qualification and friction to the extra blind self-selects. Like every

[14:19] single one of these and also track her KPI so we can start managing this. So she had this data

[14:23] because we asked for it for the episode that we did, but she didn't have it before that. And when you

[14:26] do look at the data, here's the crazy thing with data. Is that when you do look at it, a lot of things

[14:30] become obvious. And you add up 1800 fields low. But I believe it feels low. What do we need to do to fix it?

[14:35] And so if you want to figure out where you are at exactly on the scaling roadmap, you can go to

[14:39] acquisition.com where it's slash uh roadmap. And if you want us to take a look at your business

[14:43] like we did with Ashley's on the thank you page book a call every month we hold a workshop here

[14:47] at our headquarters and it's the easiest way that we can make a huge impact on some of

[14:51] his business is actually meeting you face to face and just working through this stuff. Next up is

[14:55] her biggest untapped gold mindset. This was awesome. I was so happy when I found this when we were

[14:59] doing the diligence. You're gonna love it. So the second problem is that she had a massive missed opportunity.

[15:04] And I remember what I saw this. I was like this is the mandom. If we did nothing else, this would be

[15:07] the big thing. And so when I asked Ashley where her best customer came from, she said,

[15:11] probably the matchmakers and social clubs that partnered with. Because I was like, wait,

[15:15] six partners send you a third of your entire business and she nodded. And I asked how she found

[15:20] up. She said, just Google them and sent them some emails. And that's what I knew we'd hit a big

[15:24] gold mind. Those six partners found through basic Google search and a few emails accounted for

[15:29] one third of her total revenue. And so then I was like, okay, how many emails did it take you to

[15:33] get those sex? And she said 40. Think about this from above. If you could send 40 emails and get a

[15:38] third of your business from it, which before you had sent those emails would be a 50% increase.

[15:42] Wouldn't you send more emails? And a book context on this relative to her revenue, that's $2,500 per

[15:48] email sent. Those metrics are absurd. Most founders would kill for a paid ad channel or paid

[15:54] acquisition channel with those numbers. And she was barely using it. Again, a huge missed opportunity.

[15:59] And this is the kind of leverage that gets me excited. And the thing is is that almost every business

[16:02] has multiple of these. They're just hidden in plain sight. And the issue is, sometimes it takes someone

[16:07] from the outside to see this. There's a get a saying that I like a lot, which is, your mouth is an

[16:11] inch below your nose, but sometimes you need someone else to tell your breath smells. We're so close

[16:14] to our own businesses as entrepreneurs. I'm not saying I'm immune to this. You have your own banner

[16:18] plan. Let's take your show in the weeds. It's hard to zoom all the way out and think, huh, man, this

[16:23] is a lot of work. This is a fire. But if I just did that, if I just poked over here, this will get me a

[16:27] huge return and make all the work that I'm doing right now, or rather, many of you might be laughing.

[16:32] That actually, it's such a big gold mine. She was ignored. You and me have these issues within

[16:35] our own businesses. And so sometimes we chase new opportunities without tapping into something that's

[16:39] already writing front of us with massive potential. You do something once it works. And instead of

[16:43] doubling down, you chase the new thing. And this is super common, especially the smaller you are.

[16:47] This is a perfect example of more than better than new. So why do so many business owners fail to

[16:54] tap into their kind of obvious gold mines? Honestly, I think it's because they're distracted.

[16:57] It's just there's so many things that are going on to the business. And typically, when you're

[17:00] small business, you're managing not only acquisition or managing pricing or making delivery or managing

[17:04] client-gen managing employees, there's all these things that are going on. Sometimes it's hard to

[17:07] think strategically and think, where do I get the biggest bank for a buck? If I could only do one

[17:11] thing to double my business this year, and it had to double the business, what would I do?

[17:16] Great. Why am I doing anything that's not that? Sometimes these questions kind of open your mind,

[17:19] but you have to ask them from the outside and you have a little bit of space. That was the problem.

[17:23] So what was the solution? This is what we did to scale her affiliates. We didn't change the

[17:27] play at all. We just ran it way harder. The first step we did was we was built the list. So if you're

[17:32] falling along and you're like, oh, I could do this. Yeah, you could. Everybody can build a list.

[17:35] All right. So we expanded the affiliate avatar beyond just matchmakers because let's face it. There's

[17:39] probably not 100,000 matchmakers in one city. There might be 20 or 50 or 100 or 300, but there's not

[17:45] a unlimited amount, right? What other types of businesses would have this type of prospect in this

[17:50] particular moment of the buying cycle? And this is key. She identified when we had our conversation

[17:54] that it's like divorcees or single people who are executives who have never found love or

[17:59] sometimes it's lives who feel like they and their husbands don't dress according to their social

[18:05] status or their perceived social status. We expanded it to private social clubs, executive coaches,

[18:10] high-end personal trainers, divorce attorneys, all of those are people who own a business that

[18:16] contain the ideal avatar for Ashley's business. Ashley could serve their clients and make them

[18:21] look in the process and the beauty of this is that she's not competitive with them. Right? Like a

[18:24] divorce attorney doesn't lose anything by referring their divorce client over to Ashley to look

[18:29] better and feel better. If anything, it's a benefit. That list is not exhaustive, but it was a

[18:33] great place for her to start and for you if you're looking at your business, we just have to think

[18:36] what other businesses sell to our customers and everyone typically goes to my competitors or

[18:41] could bring those people over. Yeah, but there's a ton of businesses that are adjacent and this is also

[18:45] like one of the strongest reasons of staying focused in your business. If you try to do all things for

[18:49] all people, you also can't partner with anyone. And so if you stay very focused on one specific

[18:54] avatar and selling them one very specific thing, then you can go to other people who sell something

[18:58] different and then you guys can work together. And so one of the ways that she did this issue

[19:01] hold these events that then benefit all of their customers because it's all these divorcees,

[19:05] that would want to meet other divorcees because they're all in every single single. And so you have

[19:08] this kind of meet-up thing that she could sponsor and it adds value to the divorce attorney and also

[19:12] it works as a way for her to solicit your customers. Windwit. First thing we did was both list.

[19:16] The second thing we did was send the darn emails. So I gave her the goal of 10xing her existing volume.

[19:23] So she had done 40 over her lifetime. I said, once you do 430 days. 40 emails generated six

[19:28] high-level partners. Then 400 might be able to get a 60. If she had 60 high-level partners,

[19:33] you could do the math on that. It would be a lot. And so she committed to sending the 20 out

[19:37] outreach messages per day. No fancy software. Literally just honor email. Just sending it out.

[19:42] Keep it simple. The third thing we did was activate and retain. Because affiliates, you have to

[19:48] treat like customers. And this is where people go wrong with affiliates. Like no one's going to

[19:52] do that work for you. You have to work it. You have to work them. You have to work the relationships.

[19:56] So it becomes much more like enterprise farming sale. So there's hunters and there's farmers.

[20:01] So there's more of a relationship manager. But you basically need someone and sometimes that's

[20:04] you to continue to farm the relationship, to keep them activated, to keep them engaged,

[20:09] keep them retained so that they keep sending you customers every single month. And so you

[20:12] want to think of them as nodes of customers. 20 people that I need to hit them up regularly so I can

[20:17] provide that to them by them dinner, host events for their customers. All these things to remind

[20:21] them to keep you top of mind. So why is this so powerful? affiliates will keep selling for you.

[20:26] They are a recurring customer generator. And they'll send you a few leads a month or sometimes

[20:30] hundreds of leads a month that have demonstrated they're already willing to pay for similar services.

[20:34] So they're most qualified. They're just like warmer furls passed on to you. The likelihood that

[20:38] you close these prospects super high in 10 is very high. If you're like, man, this sounds kind of

[20:42] interesting. I would love to have an army of affiliates just sending me customers. Like,

[20:45] she only had six. That was a third of her business. She had 60. My God. It would be a lot bigger.

[20:50] And so I wrote an entire chapter on this and the hundred-bought leads book. It starts on page 227.

[20:54] And I give you the list inside of the book of exactly what to do step by step. Two set up in a

[20:58] flater army. I've grown multiple businesses where it relates with the largest source of business.

[21:02] School is one of them. Recently, Allen, my software is since before that.

[21:06] Christie's labs are something company. All of those built up affiliates. I feel very confident

[21:10] we talk a few about this. But this is the quick and dirty. So number one, find your ideal affiliates.

[21:14] That was that list. Number two, you have to make them an offer. So for her, I was like, can we

[21:18] can I throw a vent for your customers? I'm going to pay for it. That makes them look good and

[21:21] give you an ability to sell them. Number three, qualify the affiliates because you want to make

[21:25] sure that they're actually like good and they have your right audience. Number four, figure out what to

[21:29] pay them or compensate them in whatever way. Sometimes it's like, I'm going to do stuff for your

[21:32] customers that'll make you look good. Sometimes it's I'm going to bundle an element of what I sell

[21:36] into your core offers. You can charge more for your core services or my thinking mean upsell that

[21:41] I give you a hundred percent of the cash on or you can sell my thing and I'll give you some

[21:44] percentage of it. All of those are different ways to structure these affiliate agreements. I talk more

[21:48] about it inside the book. But once you figure that out, then you just got to get them advertising and

[21:51] keep them advertising. The getting them advertising is how do we launch this relationship?

[21:55] Because typically they're going to have an existing base. How do we promote this new partnership

[21:59] together? So everybody wins. And then once that launch occurs, we want full integration. So how do

[22:03] we make sure that month after month they're sending new customers? And so most people spend $10,000 a month

[22:08] on ads and completely ignore affiliates that might bring way higher returns. And so Ashley was already

[22:12] doing it. She just needed to scale it. And so we first fixed Ashley's leaky funnel,

[22:16] then we took advantage of the hugely delayed opportunity that she had in front of her. And now

[22:19] we're going to fix pricing, which is problem number three. She had some big pricing and efficiencies.

[22:23] Her clients were high income. She served CEO, CEO, social lights, frequent flyers, people who get

[22:29] forward how comes not hours. But her pricing model didn't really reflect that. And she was charging

[22:33] a one time $8,500 on boarding fee. And then offered either the $2,000 a month for ongoing styling

[22:39] or $4,500 a quarter. So solid numbers, especially for boutique high-tech service. When I dug into

[22:43] existing clients, most of them weren't actually paying those rates. They were ran farther than at $1500

[22:47] a quarter or less. Worst, the website at intake prices didn't clearly set those expectations.

[22:52] And so there was no pricing revealed until after the call. No mention of tears, no mention of value

[22:57] framing. This is supposed to be a premium experience, but it was being delivered like commodity.

[23:01] This happens at ton by the way. Like a lot of businesses like want to be boutique for them

[23:05] the sales process completely breaks the frame. If I give you one word for what your sales

[23:10] process should look like, it's congruent. If you are high-end, you're at your actual

[23:13] client, the lead match to the client, the people you're qualified to look at, the price point should

[23:17] be about high-end, and then the product and service should be high. Everything has to fit. And if it

[23:21] does it, it'll break the frame and immediately something feels off and it'll plummet your conversion rates.

[23:26] And so when I asked her how many clients were actually opting into the $2,000 per month,

[23:30] she said only a couple so far, which wasn't surprising altogether. And so the question is like,

[23:34] why wasn't she getting up sales? Number one, is she recently changed this price?

[23:37] So that was for sure a factor. It's also pretty common that as a business expands,

[23:42] especially when you're smaller, that you don't charge enough upfront because you just want to get going.

[23:46] And that's okay, it's normal. But in time, you start looking at your margins, you're like,

[23:49] you know what? Maybe I can expand this. Now, to be clear, she had 42% more, just not bad.

[23:54] I mean, that's probably pretty good. There's no issues there. I never limit myself on like,

[23:57] oh, these are good margins. Therefore, I should not make more money. Biomines make more.

[24:01] There are no rules. The thing that she was missing was two things. Number one,

[24:04] she did never price anchor, which would dramatically affect the take rates on that back and offer.

[24:08] And number two, is she didn't have a frictionless upsell for a main offer into continuity.

[24:12] So she was selling the $8,500 thing pretty okay. She just wasn't getting as many as she wanted

[24:16] into the continuity, which is the real value of the business. First thing we did is we introduced a

[24:19] highest tier continuity option that would make the existing $2,000 a month or 45,000 per quarter

[24:26] seem reasonable by comparison. And so even if only 10% of the people took that high and

[24:30] offer, when that high and offer is 10 times as expensive, it still effectively doubles the revenue

[24:36] of the business. And for everybody else, it makes the normal price, which was once the most expensive

[24:40] price, feel like a deal. Now, if you want a pro tip on this, if you don't really plan on selling

[24:46] a lot of your price anchor, what you do is you want to have it be as similar as possible to your

[24:51] core offer, it only change one or two things that most people don't care about. Now, the richest

[24:56] customer is always just one of the most expensive things. But for everyone else, they'll see,

[24:59] wait, there's a dramatic price difference, it's about a very small feature difference. This is now

[25:03] a steel comparatively. So we set the frame and we operate within that frame. So the second thing we did

[25:09] after the anchor was a back end. And not only did we have the back end because you already had that,

[25:14] we actually made it default. All right. So how do we make it the default option? So one of the, I

[25:18] remember the first time I learned about this ages and ages and ages ago, it was in a book that

[25:22] talked about a one country that was able to get like 70% plus of their citizens to often being donors

[25:28] and every other country was at like less than 10%. And the main thing that country did was

[25:33] ask people to opt out of being an organ donor rather than every other country that asks the people to

[25:38] opt in. And so basically customers have a customer's humans have a default bias, which is if they think

[25:44] this is the thing that most people do, they will typically do that because crowd mentality,

[25:49] herd mentality keeps you safe. If everyone's doing it, it is already tested. They're all alive.

[25:54] It is lower risk for me to continue to do what everyone else is doing. Not the best recipe for

[25:59] outside's returns, but a very good recipe and reasonable for decreasing risk. And so we want them

[26:04] to decrease risk by buying. So instead of repinching continuity from scratch, we just positioned

[26:09] to ask the next natural step after onboarding. So you've already invested in transformation.

[26:13] Let's make sure it sticks. And so oftentimes the best thing to upsell people, by the way,

[26:18] if you're like, what do I upsell on my back end? Here are my two favorite ones that you can use

[26:22] all the time because they only always work. It's more of that thing they just bought or more

[26:25] help with that thing they just bought. They work exceptionally well. And what you want to do with this is

[26:30] you want to have an assumed closer. This is how we've always done it. This is how this normally works.

[26:34] We had the price sinker that we reintroduced. We made the back in the default. The third thing

[26:37] we did is we pushed price. Now you might have heard Ashley's original price is at 8500. She's already

[26:42] price so high. Why would she raise prices? So there's this thing in economics called a Vebling Good.

[26:46] Vebling Good is a good, where when you increase the price, it actually increases the value,

[26:49] which is especially common in luxury items. If people know, especially if people know,

[26:54] that's something costs a lot of money, they will then want it more. Is it always the case? But sometimes

[27:00] it is. And in other cases, you can just raise the price and it just changes nothing about the

[27:04] conversion rate. The easiest way to make more money and any business is to charge more for the exact same

[27:08] thing. Provided around the same number of people take it. Here's a pro tip for context. The point of

[27:13] maximum profit is after the point of maximum conversion. This should seem obvious. You made it for a

[27:18] dollar. You could get more people to buy. Then if she did not, her particular case, it might be

[27:22] so cheap at a dollar that few people would even believe it was good. So that gets into a different

[27:26] issue of pricing. But within the context of in general, price supplied demand, typically as supply

[27:32] shrinks, the price will move. Given the fact that you selling the luxury people, luxury buyers

[27:37] don't want the cheapest option. They're literally trying to look better than other people. They want

[27:41] the best. But if you don't give them a premium path, they'll just default to the lowest tier.

[27:45] So we had to make that path for it. Well, we did by reframing the offer and adding in the anchor

[27:50] and tightening the handoff from onboarding into continuity, actually could boost LTV on the back

[27:54] in and be able to slowly continue to push your prices until people work in a buy. Or until the

[27:59] point where she was making less money than she was at a lower price. But the thing is in my experience,

[28:04] there's so much more room here. Because think about it like this if it were a curve. Most people

[28:08] will try and be here where they have, like, let's say maximum, yeses. But the thing is, is that

[28:12] sometimes the maximum gross profit is here. This is a bad line to illustrate the point. But you're

[28:15] nose are going to increase and your yeses will decrease. But if the price here is 3x this price

[28:21] and you're getting half the yeses, you make more money. And so far, just key takeaways. So number one,

[28:27] we fixed the funnel first. She was already doing 2 to 3x. So we had to add it in the Viesel,

[28:31] the lead magnet, and we claw fighter leads. So that was the first thing we did to improve the

[28:35] conversion rate on the funnel itself all automated, which I think could give her a 2 to 3x there.

[28:39] We also fixed that headline. Again, that's the estimate, not a guarantee that's going to happen

[28:43] for it. But that's my estimate. The second thing we did is we doubled down on the huge missed

[28:46] opportunity she had, which was that she had 1 third or business coming from 6 to fill it. And so we

[28:50] got her to build the list, commit to sending 20 emails a day, and then afterwards activate and retain

[28:54] them by giving them high value that she could deliver to their customers that they would get quite

[28:58] it for. And then third, we continue to push pricing. And in order to do that, we reestablish the

[29:03] price anchor. We made the back end default so we could increase LTV and she committed to continue

[29:08] an increasing price until her conversion rate drops such that she made less to overall money.

[29:12] Now the business could attract more customers, convert them better, and retain them longer,

[29:16] and price higher with high-grace profit. And so if you want to see the full video of Ashley's reaction

[29:20] to this guy, then you can check it out here.

[00:00] If there were a way to get your business or new product to 2x, 10x or 100x overnight,

[00:06] would you do it?

[00:08] If there are a way to all the guarantee that no matter what business you're in,

[00:12] it could become more successful than it currently is, would you do it?

[00:17] And if you could compress a decade of building a business into weeks, would you do it?

[00:25] If so, this workshop is for you.

[00:28] And using the super influencer process all outlined in a second,

[00:32] will make someone here today enough money to retire.

[00:35] That is a promise.

[00:37] I would know because I've also used them about to share with you to do exactly that.

[00:43] I'm Alex from OZ. My first big business I scaled a $2.5 million a month,

[00:47] which was B2B, Jim Lontz, Jim Licensing.

[00:50] My second business is an e-commerce business.

[00:52] That sold through an affiliate and influencer program, which got to $1.7 million a month,

[00:56] which is B2B to C.

[00:58] My third company was a software for lead gen agencies,

[01:01] which we grew entirely off of affiliates and influencers,

[01:04] which we got to $1.6 million per month.

[01:06] And so I've paid real money to get influencers to promote my businesses.

[01:11] Just to give you some context, I spent over $20 million on influencers

[01:16] to promote prestige labs.

[01:17] That's the actual checks. That's what I paid out.

[01:20] Now we made. That's what I paid out.

[01:22] And in Alan, I spent over $22.8 million on influencers to promote the software.

[01:28] Those are my actual payouts from our dashboard.

[01:32] And I've had over 23,000 affiliates who promoted my last book,

[01:36] $100 million leads. That's a screenshot from our CRM.

[01:40] Which helped me sell over a million copies of my last two books,

[01:43] $100 million offers and $100 million leads.

[01:46] And you can see the slack message from my book manager there.

[01:49] And so this process that I'm about to share with you creates real life-changing value.

[01:55] And it allowed me to sell my first two businesses to American Pacific Group for $46.2 million.

[02:01] And sell Alan with a trailing 12 month of $12 million from revenue.

[02:06] And then use all that money to start acquisition.com to invest in and scale companies.

[02:11] And currently, our portfolio together is about $17 million a month.

[02:15] And so I've made millions using influencers to promote my businesses.

[02:18] And I can help you do the same.

[02:21] And so I start with this proof because there's a lot of sucky fluff that's being taught out there.

[02:25] Like this fluff sucks.

[02:27] From people who've never done what they claim and simply copy and pay stuff that they don't understand.

[02:33] People being like, I two things that I've never done.

[02:36] And I refuse to do that.

[02:39] And so after spending, losing, and then finally, making millions on influencers,

[02:45] I've learned a lot of what not to do.

[02:48] But I also figured out a few things that work.

[02:50] And today, I'm going to share with you a three-step, super influencer process.

[02:54] Anyone can use to get a flood of buyers into your business for free.

[02:59] Even, and especially if, you have no following or money yourself.

[03:06] And so here is the three-step process.

[03:09] Number one, no which influencer to pick.

[03:12] Number two,

[03:14] no how to get them to talk to you.

[03:17] And then number three, I'm going to show you how to get them to promote your stuff.

[03:20] Because if you know who to pick and you get them to talk to you and you get them to promote your stuff,

[03:24] you will make more money than if you do not.

[03:26] And arguably, if you pick the right influencer, you might make life changing amounts of money.

[03:32] And so think about it this way.

[03:34] If tomorrow, the rock or Taylor Swift agree to promote your business,

[03:39] do you think your business would grow?

[03:41] No matter what you sell.

[03:43] If you get umbrellas, contracting, tequila, or VAA agencies, or whatever it is,

[03:48] if the rock got up there and said, this is the dude,

[03:51] do you think you would make more money?

[03:53] Obviously.

[03:55] Of course it would.

[03:57] And better yet, do you think there's any single move?

[04:00] And this is the key point.

[04:01] We talk about opportunity cost of the time and effort we put into every move we make in business.

[04:05] Do you think there's any single move that you could make that would make you more money in less time than partnering with someone like that?

[04:12] No.

[04:14] Probably not.

[04:16] So why on earth are we not putting all of our time into the one thing that could make you the absolute most amount of money in the shortest period of time?

[04:23] I don't know.

[04:25] Why not?

[04:26] And so before I dive in, let me explain why taking action on about to share with you,

[04:29] maybe the most important decision in your life.

[04:31] So I would say option one, you could be lame.

[04:33] Option two, do it and change your life.

[04:35] So I'm going to opt for option two, and hopefully you do two.

[04:38] And so there's a reason that this is so important, especially right now.

[04:43] There's a big shift that's happening in the economy and specifically the economy of attention.

[04:49] Traditional advertising is dying.

[04:52] Social media and influencer brands are on the rise.

[04:55] You've all heard this, but let me show you some stats to support it.

[04:58] It's the reason that Logan Paul and Prime, a two year old company, two years old,

[05:05] is now beating. They have more sales than power rate, a 36 year old company.

[05:11] Two years, 36, and they're crushing them.

[05:15] It's the same reason Mr. Beast's feastables, a less than two year old company,

[05:20] are in the multiple hundreds of millions of dollars a year in sales,

[05:24] and they're gaining rapidly on herses, which was something that before this time,

[05:29] an age, was thought to be impossible.

[05:33] And it's why so many mega brands are getting launched with influencers like Kylie has her cosmetics,

[05:39] proper 12 with Conomer Gragger, Kim has skims, and you've got Ryan Reynolds with aviation gin,

[05:45] and he's got a bunch of other brands as well.

[05:47] So many of these mega brands are getting launched with mega influencers or super influencers.

[05:52] Because they can almost guarantee profitability on day one.

[05:57] So think about it like this.

[05:59] If you can reach one million people, four free, as long as your product sells for more than it costs,

[06:05] you make money.

[06:07] Period.

[06:08] And so the question just becomes which thing will make the most money,

[06:13] rather than whether that thing will make money at all.

[06:18] So Mr. Beast here has to make the decision of am I going to promote Margaritas or am I going to promote chocolate?

[06:24] But if he did promote Margaritas, guess what?

[06:27] He would still make money, not as much as he could if he did chocolate, but he would still make money.

[06:32] And what crazy world can you live in that you can guarantee millions and millions and sales on something

[06:38] that actually has poor product market fit?

[06:40] This is one of those big insurance policies you can take of it on the future of your business if you make the right pick.

[06:46] And this is never existed before this moment until now.

[06:52] And so here's some graphs because everybody likes graphs.

[06:55] It's the same reason that more viewers aren't internet than their own television.

[06:59] More podcast listeners than their own radio listeners.

[07:02] And even crazier, this costless and convert higher, which means that there's more total people watching listening and consuming,

[07:12] and more of them buying for less money overall.

[07:16] The game has changed.

[07:18] Yet so few businesses are taking advantage of it.

[07:21] And so you can see why this is such a huge opportunity.

[07:25] Said differently, if the only thing between you and the fastest business growth you could possibly imagine was three steps wouldn't be worth doing.

[07:36] Great.

[07:37] I think so too.

[07:39] So let's dive in.

[07:40] The three steps super influencer process.

[07:42] How to pick them, how to get them to talk to you, how to get them to wrote your stuff.

[07:47] So let's start with number one, how to pick the right influencer.

[07:50] So there was a movie that came out a year ago or a year ago called Air.

[07:54] And the premise was simple.

[07:56] Nike, a shoe brand, was struggling to enter the basketball market at the time.

[08:00] This is not drawn to scale.

[08:02] The representation is that they weren't making that much money.

[08:05] Everybody else was making more.

[08:07] Fantastic.

[08:08] And every year they would spend money on player sponsorships.

[08:11] And they would get, quote, second tier rookies to where they're stuff.

[08:15] There's the guy, he's second tier, he's wearing Nike.

[08:18] And they kept losing the best players every year to a deities in converse.

[08:22] Yes, converse was actually a big player back then.

[08:25] And so the exhausted partnership manager, AKA talent scout, insisted to fill night that they go all in on this new young rookie named Michael Jordan.

[08:36] He was one of the top picks and they bet their entire basketball budget.

[08:41] So they took what they were going to pay five to ten players and just gave it to one.

[08:46] And they did it in order to sign him.

[08:49] And he got the biggest deal that anyone had ever signed because Nike needed him more than he needed them.

[08:56] And they hoped they hoped that they would do $2 million in basketball shoe sales.

[09:01] But instead, they did $122 million in the first year.

[09:06] And they created an iconic brand that has yet to be surpassed decades later.

[09:10] And you can see how Nike now eats the entire pie.

[09:15] All because they went all in on the right influencer. They picked the right guy.

[09:21] And so the question for you is, who's your Michael Jordan?

[09:25] And so there's two ways you can approach this.

[09:27] One, you have a branded product and you go find a super influencer to partner with.

[09:33] So you have the thing and then you go to find the person or two, you find the person and then you brand something around them.

[09:41] Either works.

[09:44] So the Nike air story was an example of number one. Nike was selling basketball shoes.

[09:48] People who are basketball shoes tend to watch an idolized basketball players.

[09:51] So finding the best available basketball player made the most sense for them in this case Michael Jordan.

[09:55] So they kept their brand and then Jordan promoted a personal line.

[09:59] That's how they married the two because he needed them less than they needed him.

[10:04] But Nike overall was still a bigger brand than Michael Jordan was, especially as a rookie.

[10:10] An example of number two is some company that you probably haven't heard of, which is Congo.

[10:15] Congo is a drink manufacturer. They have three massive brands underneath of their umbrella and one of them is prime.

[10:21] The other two also do half a billion dollars a year in sales.

[10:24] And you've heard of those two, but for the purpose of the presentation, I'm just going to focus on Congo.

[10:28] So Congo, you've never heard of.

[10:30] Logan Paul, you probably have.

[10:33] And so they decided to say we're going to go find the influencer and create the product that's branded for them.

[10:39] And we're going to do the delivery.

[10:41] And so the difference these two examples is Nike, you get the influencer to promote your brand.

[10:49] Or you deliver on theirs.

[10:52] That's the difference between the two models both work.

[10:56] And so which brand you use depends on who has the bigger audience because you're like, wait, how do I get which one?

[11:01] Well, it just depends who's bigger.

[11:03] So Nike had a bigger audience than Jordan so he promoted them.

[11:06] Now he was still up. He was bigger in basketball than Nike.

[11:09] And so they created a specific line around Jordan.

[11:11] So that's kind of the nuance of this.

[11:12] And that's why understanding how this works is so important for you actually executing on it.

[11:17] Logan Paul has a bigger audience than Congo, more people have heard of him than Congo.

[11:20] And so they delivered for him.

[11:22] And so you can get an army of tiny influencers or find one super influencer.

[11:29] And the pro tip here is that the first, if you want to find lots of little guys who are 100K each, right?

[11:35] It will take you longer, but you'll be able to retain more ownership because you will pretty much always be bigger than them.

[11:43] And that's what I did in these companies. So with prestigious labs in Allen, both of those.

[11:46] I had lots of lots of little affiliates, lots of little influencers.

[11:50] The second is faster and easier to manage, but you give up more.

[11:53] Now I will say personally that I lean far more towards this now as I understand branding and I understand speed to market and understand the value of aggressive growth.

[12:04] And the insurance policy that a super influencer provides to a business, which is exactly what we did with school.

[12:11] I both co-owned and act as my own influencer for the school games and school the platform itself.

[12:18] And so you might be like, okay, well that's great for Nike and prime and feastables and school.

[12:24] But what about me? What about everyday business owners?

[12:27] How do we actually get in contact with influencers and super influencers?

[12:32] Well first, you have to know who buys the sort of stuff you sell.

[12:35] The fancy term for this is ideal customer or avatar or ICP.

[12:40] Then you got to figure out the influencers they follow.

[12:44] Then you got to pick out the super influencers from there that best fit your product.

[12:49] And so I think about contacting people in layers. So this is tactical.

[12:53] All right, so everyone's taking notes like this is the part we take notes on it.

[12:56] All right, so first I start with influencers I know personally. Now you might be like, well, I don't know influencer.

[13:01] Believe it or not, you probably do know someone personally.

[13:05] They might not be Logan Paul, but they probably have a bigger following than you.

[13:09] I can almost guarantee that you know someone who is a bigger following than you.

[13:13] That's why you know them.

[13:15] And if you contact all of them or don't know anything because they're going to give all the people with excuses in the room.

[13:21] They're like, I don't want to talk to people I know. Okay, fine.

[13:23] So if you did contact all of them or you don't know any, then you move on to the next circle, which is I asked my network who they know.

[13:30] I say, okay, I don't know any big influencers.

[13:32] Do y'all know any big influencers.

[13:35] And when I make this point on emphasizes, actually ask.

[13:40] You can even cut the person that you ask in on your side of the deal if they make an intro and it actually works out.

[13:45] And you can pay real money for this because it's exceptionally valuable for you and your business for all the points already made.

[13:51] And so you just say something like, do you know XXX person or do you know anyone who is that size audience or who caters to this type of people?

[13:59] And if you want to add the optional, I'm paying XXX for an intro.

[14:04] Now if they don't know anyone, so this is for the people who have excuses in the room, if they don't know anyone, so you don't know anybody.

[14:10] And your friends don't know anybody because you live in a rock fantastic, then you move on to the next circle out, which is influencers you follow or have heard of.

[14:19] And what I do is I reach out everywhere, multiple times and find mutual connections and I harass the living hell of them and offer bounties and crazy ifs.

[14:28] And when I say harassing living hell, I mean of my friends, not the person.

[14:31] All right, to be very clear, great way to not get a partnership done.

[14:35] But reaching out on multiple channels, super smart.

[14:39] So if you follow them on Instagram, also look at them on LinkedIn, look at them on TikTok, look at them via email, look at via direct mail, people forget about this.

[14:47] You can actually deliver stuff to people's address, by the way you can't unsubscribe from direct mail, fun fact.

[14:53] All right, so there are things that you can do to get people's attention. And here's what's interesting.

[14:58] Somebody who has a very large following on Instagram might have a very small following on LinkedIn.

[15:04] And they might check both of their inboxes.

[15:06] But where do you think you're more likely to stand out when they get one of 10 inbox messages on LinkedIn versus the one of 1000 they get on Instagram?

[15:14] Right? Go everywhere because you might stick out. And you can follow up to be clear. I'm not saying don't follow up do that.

[15:20] But I definitely want to take the people I know and ask them for it.

[15:26] And now, if none of them respond to you, then you can go through formal channels. And this is a little bit of a pro tip.

[15:33] So one, obviously some of these guys will have agents if you're looking for super influencers.

[15:37] And I will say this having now Douglas super influencers.

[15:40] It's not as much as you think most of the time.

[15:43] Most of the time, it's not nearly as much as you think. If you're a bigger business owner for those of you who get that otherwise you'd be like, I have to spend 10 million dollars to get this person.

[15:52] Honestly, super stars, you can get for a couple hundred grand a year. You'd be amazed.

[15:57] Now, here's the little pro tip for you.

[16:00] Most influencers of some sort have a website. And most of them sell at least one thing.

[16:06] And a little pro tip for you is just actually go to their website as another place.

[16:11] And opt in. Actually, contact support. Actually, reach out.

[16:15] Find the email address on the site and reach out. You'll be amazed.

[16:18] And again, instead of going to the thousand DM inbox on Instagram,

[16:22] that there might only be six people who are actually emailing.

[16:25] So there's just don't make the assumption that because lots of people see it, lots of people take action.

[16:29] So I'm going to tell you a quick analogy in this because I think this will drive it home.

[16:34] We recently put out, we did a contest for editors because we have a big media team, most media.

[16:40] And we had 1200 people off of one post said that they were interested in the role.

[16:45] Now, many people were probably like, oh man, I don't want to apply for something like that because I probably don't have a shot.

[16:50] Well, wait for the second step.

[16:52] We then gave all of those 1200 people who wanted to be editors one raw file.

[16:58] And we said, just edit it and you've got 48 hours to send it in.

[17:02] Guess how many of the 1200, the 1200 people actually submitted and edit 60.

[17:11] 60, 5% 1 in 20.

[17:16] So the odds are still in your favor if you actually take action.

[17:20] You would be in, and that's a pretty big number.

[17:22] And the same thing going for jobs, going for girls, going for whatever you want.

[17:26] You'd be amazed how low the bar is if you actually try.

[17:32] And so that's how you pick them tactically.

[17:34] All right, so let's just recap this work.

[17:35] Number one, find this biggest person that you connect with using the circles.

[17:39] If you're audits to Spirgrther than theirs, then you ask them to promote your thing.

[17:42] If they're audits to Spirgrther than yours, you offered a deliver for them.

[17:45] Finding your, quote, Michael Jordan can give you the benefit of years of building a massive audience without the time cost.

[17:52] And you immediately reap the benefits of their work in exchange for a portion of the upside.

[17:59] And so that's how you pick the right influencer.

[18:01] Number one, so let's move on to step two.

[18:04] You're like, okay, I've got my eyes on this guy.

[18:06] I've got my eyes on my Michael Jordan.

[18:08] Now you got to get him to talk to you.

[18:10] So no matter how good your thing is or the offer that you want to make them,

[18:13] if they don't respond to you or you can't get a hold of them, you're not going to get very far.

[18:17] So here's how I get them interested.

[18:20] Verify yourself, the magic message, and the rule 100.

[18:24] Three steps.

[18:25] So let's walk through the first one.

[18:26] So verifying yourself has two individual steps.

[18:29] First, you literally verify yourself on the platform if you can.

[18:33] Pay the $10 per month or whatever it is to get the blue checkmark.

[18:37] All right, you do this because you will get five to ten times the response rates.

[18:42] And so if I think about my time is valuable, if I can get, if I can compress my time to tenx time for ten dollars a month,

[18:49] I cannot imagine a better use of resources.

[18:52] That means for ten bucks, you can get five to tenx the time back.

[18:55] Absolutely worth it.

[18:57] Step two of verifying yourself is don't be like Ra-Kesh 0018.

[19:03] Don't be like him.

[19:05] Be like Jim.

[19:06] Jim has a verification badge.

[19:09] He has a description of what he does.

[19:11] By the way, if you want to partner with influencers to do stuff, say so in the description, say what you want them to see.

[19:17] If you're like, hey, I'm reaching out to influencers and it just says like,

[19:19] Big news at head and you're reaching out about e-commerce stuff.

[19:23] Probably not a good idea.

[19:24] They're going to immediately read your social resume and be like, this guy has nothing to do with what he's offering me.

[19:29] If you want to be a professional, act like a professional.

[19:31] Do it for money.

[19:32] Do it like it's your job because it is.

[19:36] Here's a profile picture.

[19:38] Now one thing that I would fix about Jim's is I would make it more of his face close to up and lighter and brighter.

[19:44] If you will, I put mine there because of course, you know, magic social media man that I am.

[19:49] Mind you, I had to learn this the hard way.

[19:51] This was like I was zoomed all the way out and you couldn't have seen him as super pixelated.

[19:54] All right, and so I've learned this stuff over time.

[19:57] So you want to make sure you have a picture that makes you look like human being.

[20:00] Fantastic.

[20:01] And then actually use the platform.

[20:03] Post a few things that show who you are on whatever platform you choose to.

[20:06] So you can see he's got posts, obviously this guy's in the music and it stuffs about music.

[20:10] That makes sense.

[20:11] By the way, I don't know either of these people I just grabbed from my DMs.

[20:13] I just saw who stood out and who were people had guaranteed would never respond to.

[20:17] All right.

[20:18] So in short, don't be a weirdo.

[20:20] I'll look like Ra-Kesh.

[20:21] Be like Jim.

[20:22] And to be fair, Ra-Kesh, if you do watch this, I don't think you're necessarily weirdo.

[20:26] You're displaying like one.

[20:28] All right.

[20:29] So number one, verify yourself.

[20:32] Check.

[20:33] So now, if we have verified ourselves, we've got to figure out what we're actually going to say to him.

[20:36] So let me give you the magic message.

[20:38] So this is a sample message script.

[20:41] You would send this to an influencer.

[20:43] Hey, long time fan first time messenger.

[20:46] I own a company that partners with the influencers to start communities.

[20:49] This is one I made for school that they own based on your following.

[20:52] It looks like you generate any from extra y per month and recurring income.

[20:55] Here's screenshots of people who started this month alone.

[20:58] Mind you, the screenshots don't necessarily need to be from you.

[21:00] They're just screenshots that's other people who've had the same experience.

[21:03] You get the majority of the profits.

[21:05] We do majority of the work.

[21:06] Would you be up for 15 minute coffee to walk you through what something like this would look like?

[21:10] That's it.

[21:11] Very straightforward.

[21:13] Now, to be clear, the more personalized the message the better.

[21:17] You only need one person to say yes.

[21:20] Put the time in to actually look like you took a moment to think about this person.

[21:25] Don't just blast 100 of these messages copy and paste.

[21:28] I say long time long time follow our first time messenger.

[21:32] Guess who some of the best people will start with our people you actually follow.

[21:35] Bonus points if they've already interacted with you before in the past.

[21:39] And guess what?

[21:40] If they don't respond, congratulations, you just got practice.

[21:43] For free.

[21:44] Bonus points.

[21:47] If it is your dream influencer, offer to fly out to show them your serious.

[21:52] If you incur costs, they will take you more seriously.

[21:55] If you want to play with the pros, you got to act like a pro.

[21:58] Now, if you're listening to this, you're watching this and you're like,

[22:00] Why don't have the money to fly out?

[22:02] That's fine.

[22:03] But if you want to play in the big leagues, you got to do what you got to do.

[22:06] And they're not going to take you seriously because they want somebody who has some level of resources and success.

[22:10] Now, you can think it before you make it, which I'm not really a fan of.

[22:13] Or you just say, I'm going all in on this.

[22:15] And you make the bet.

[22:17] And you're going to strike out sometimes.

[22:19] And that's okay because life is long and you only need one.

[22:22] And so what you'd say is something like this.

[22:24] You'd say, Hey, I'm out that way all the time.

[22:26] So it's no big deal.

[22:27] I'm happy to stop by so we can meet one another and see if there's an opportunity that makes sense.

[22:31] And the key part is like, I'm out that way all the time because they also don't want to inconvenience you.

[22:34] But if you're like, Oh, it's no problem.

[22:36] I'm out that way anyway because it also shows that you're busy.

[22:38] You're doing other stuff.

[22:40] They're not the only, uh, only frog in the kettle.

[22:43] I don't know if that's the saying, I'm going with it.

[22:45] Okay, fantastic.

[22:46] And next little bonus tip is that if they have a public office,

[22:50] spend time on money on it, seeing gift and a handwritten card.

[22:53] And offer to pay a lot of money for them,

[22:56] not you ahead of time for just 15 minutes.

[22:58] And I'll be very clear about that last point.

[23:00] The amount of people were like, Hey, I'll pay a hundred dollars for your time.

[23:04] That might be a lot of money for you.

[23:06] That might not be a lot of money for them.

[23:08] And so you got to understand who you're playing with, right?

[23:11] If you're going up to Carmen Electra,

[23:13] shoot, what's Jen's easy, equivalent of that?

[23:15] Haley Bieber, now she's married.

[23:17] Shit, who's a hot girl?

[23:19] Sydney, Sydney, Sydney.

[23:20] Great.

[23:21] You're going to Sydney, Swini, and you're like, Hey, babe,

[23:24] we got to dinner, dinners on me.

[23:26] Not a very compelling offer for Sydney,

[23:28] because they've got guys who are literally paid for all the food for the rest of her life,

[23:31] and travel and not just to get a picture of her underwear.

[23:35] Anyways, the point is, the point is,

[23:37] God, I'm down. The point is, is that you have to make it relevant to the influencer,

[23:42] or the super influence that you're going for.

[23:44] Hashtag something that they would actually value.

[23:47] And the personalization I will say on a personal level,

[23:51] that first one about making a big obscene gift,

[23:53] it's more about the thought and the effort that someone can see that you incurred to put the gift together.

[23:59] So I got an amazing gift the other day.

[24:01] It's a full set.

[24:03] Don't copy this.

[24:04] It's already been done, right?

[24:06] So I got a full size modern art piece that had the background of an ace of spades,

[24:12] because we were in Vegas or had Coursion Vegas,

[24:15] and it had this cool graffitiish paint all over it of the quotes that I had influenced the artist on.

[24:22] And so it was all the quotes that he'd had for me that had made an impact on his life.

[24:26] And I got that and I was like, This is so cool.

[24:29] And it was clear and obvious that he spent a lot of time putting this together.

[24:32] And it was relevant to me.

[24:34] And so as a side note, this is yet another pro tip for you.

[24:37] If you're going to give a gift to somebody in your business owner,

[24:40] don't put your logo on it.

[24:42] Put theirs on it.

[24:43] Why would I wear someone else like it doesn't make any sense?

[24:46] I want you to make something that I would want to wear all the time.

[24:50] And then I will think of you every time I wear it.

[24:52] Then I create the positive association.

[24:54] Okay, bonus points of fantastic.

[24:57] So you verify yourself.

[24:58] You look like a legitimate person.

[25:00] You send the magic message.

[25:01] You offer to incur costs.

[25:02] You try and send obscene gifts.

[25:03] If you can.

[25:04] If not, you just offer to fly out.

[25:06] If you can.

[25:07] And at the very least, you do a lot of work ahead of time, which I'll get to in a second.

[25:11] And you send the magic message.

[25:13] Great.

[25:14] Now, since it's time to send it, how many do we send?

[25:18] You send a hundred messages per day split between as many platforms as needed.

[25:22] 100.

[25:23] There's a rule of 100.

[25:24] It's consistent across industries.

[25:26] People talk about it.

[25:27] I don't know why, but I can say that it works.

[25:30] And so this will normally take about four hours per day.

[25:33] So set a kitchen timer and send the messages.

[25:36] You'd be amazed at how like if you just do this, it will take you that long and just rip the bandit off.

[25:41] Do it one day.

[25:42] Just do it one day.

[25:43] And then you'll realize that you didn't die when someone doesn't respond.

[25:47] And then you can do it a second day.

[25:48] And then a third.

[25:49] And then all of a sudden you'll start getting responses back.

[25:51] I just had a DM recently from a lady who's like, I read your book.

[25:55] I did my first day of the rule of 100.

[25:57] And she was like, I already got 10 responses.

[25:59] She was like, this is unbelievable.

[26:00] And she spent years delaying her first message.

[26:04] And I'm both happy for her and sad for her.

[26:07] Because imagine the potential you waste every day, you don't do what you need to do in order to get where you want.

[26:13] And then you keep repeating this until you get the replies.

[26:17] Bonus points.

[26:18] And this is what I was referencing earlier.

[26:20] If you already followed this influencer and you've interacted them in some way, you've come to know story.

[26:24] They like something back.

[26:25] Then you already even in.

[26:26] You already have a history with that person, even tangential, even tiny.

[26:30] It still makes you look more real than wreck-hash.

[26:35] Now, I'll give you also a pro tip as being a cool super influencer if you want to call me that.

[26:40] Share your target influencer stories.

[26:42] So this is what my DMs look like.

[26:44] So this is what my inbox looks like or whatever.

[26:47] So lots of stuff weirdo, obviously poor, blah, blah.

[26:51] Now, when I see mentioned you in their story, I create content.

[26:57] And so if someone created content for me because they mentioned me, then it gives me the opportunity to put that on my story.

[27:03] And if it's valuable, then it provides value to my audience for no cost to me.

[27:07] That's what I'm mentioning in a story is on top of the fact that they're spreading my message.

[27:11] So it's actually like one of the easiest ways to give to a super influencer.

[27:15] It's just share what they have.

[27:17] And also, if I go into a DM inbox.

[27:20] And I see that they've, because you can see how many times someone has mentioned you,

[27:23] or shared a story of yours, and you see 15 shares, I think, oh, shoot.

[27:27] You know what? I've incurred a little bit of a doubt with this person.

[27:29] It's so nice to them to share this stuff.

[27:31] They've been making content for me. They're spreading people to me.

[27:34] I like them more at the onset day one, day zero.

[27:38] So if you want to get their attention, that's just a little pro tip for you.

[27:41] And a big reminder, because I want to keep hitting this point, is that you don't need a hundred influencers.

[27:46] You just need one super influencer to take your company to the next level and transform your life.

[27:51] So recap on section two on what you actually say to get them to respond.

[27:56] Number one, be someone worth responding to, verify yourself.

[27:59] Two, look like a legit person on your profile.

[28:02] Three, send the magic message or variations of that and personalize it.

[28:05] Personalize it, personalize it.

[28:07] Offer doing cour costs to meet them. That's a little bit more advanced, but it will work.

[28:10] Send a hundred messages per day. This takes time, but you only need one.

[28:15] And share the super influencer stories and posts. You will gain more affinity from them than if you do nothing at all.

[28:21] So now that we have picked our influencer and we have optimized our messages and we're sending them, we're going to start getting replies.

[28:29] So here's how you close the deal.

[28:32] Here are the steps. One, over preparation equals profit.

[28:36] Two, every position has an advantage. Three, knows our yeses. So let's dive in.

[28:41] So before you speak with them, you want to prepare mockups of what their thing would look like on your product or the product that you want to make for them.

[28:51] Either way works. Remember, you can take your Nike shoes and say we've got this idea for a line and we want to put it under you.

[28:57] Or I white label drinks and I want to make a drink that's just for you, Logan Paul, or I want to make it to kill just for you, the rock.

[29:03] Or I want to make a whiskey, just for you, of her, greger.

[29:06] Or I want to make cosmetics, just for you, Kylie. See where I'm going with this? This is not new, but people aren't seeing it. This is why the opportunity exists.

[29:13] So on top of the mockups, you want to show graphs. You want to be like, this is you now. This is you with me.

[29:19] I say this simply, but this is literally what you want to show someone. You want to show someone you actually did a little bit of math.

[29:24] And you have some estimates and projections to go with that. You want to say, hey, you've got this many followers.

[29:29] If we pokes this post X times per week, we assume Y reach.

[29:32] And we convert 1% of clicks, which is standard based on these things that I've seen in the past within 12 months, we should be able to get to here.

[29:39] Does that sound interesting? If they say yes, awesome. You, you one step closer to closing the deal. If they say, no, you find somebody else.

[29:46] And you ask them, why is it interesting? Because you know what, they might give you some of the best feedback possible.

[29:51] And so bottom line is that you want to show that you worked a lot on this. And this is a key point. You'll see it as a recurring point when you're getting with the super influencer.

[29:58] And I'll tell you why in a second. The main reason you do that is because they want to work with a partner that's going to work hard for them.

[30:06] And the best way to prove that you're going to do it later is to do it now is to do it first.

[30:11] One of my favorite saying is the best way to show an audience that you'll give them value after they buy is to give them value before they buy.

[30:20] Brilliant. I know. But guess what people don't do? They're like, I don't want to take advantage of it.

[30:25] My time is valuable. No, it's not. And it's also relative. You're coming to ask something from them. Don't mistake it.

[30:32] Like sure. You're going to be like, they're going to benefit too. But if you're going to a super influencer, you're the one who stands again far more than them.

[30:38] Because they have themselves. And they can make that partnership with anyone. And you want them to pick you.

[30:43] Don't think about the time it takes you to make this great. Think about how much time you're going to save by them agreeing.

[30:51] That you move years of work in the future rather than the fact that it takes you a day or two to prepare one presentation for 15 minutes so that you crush it.

[31:01] And so for those who were like, but how do I structure the presentation? That's how you structure the presentation.

[31:06] Promise. You tell them the good stuff that they're going to get from the partnership.

[31:10] You're so them why they should believe you past experience or if you don't have that, stats of people like them doing something comparable.

[31:17] And if you have the product that you think that they should sell, bring it and show it to them. This is called a demo, aka a demonstration.

[31:25] You want to show them that because if they do have a strong brand, they're going to want the thing to be good because they want to make sure that they're serving their audience.

[31:31] And so if you've got the bees knees of products, let them taste the honey.

[31:36] Three, plan. Tell them what the next steps look like. What's expected of them and what you're going to do.

[31:43] And by the way, make your side look better than theirs so that they look like they're getting the best side of the deal.

[31:48] And to be real, they should be because they've already spent all these years leading up to this. So you don't have to spend five years to build this audience. They already did that.

[31:56] And so they're going to just point which takes a little effort, but that's because they're leveraging the years of work they put in.

[32:02] And then you're going to spend the rest of your time present forward, making effort, the fact that you didn't work the five to ten years to build the brand.

[32:09] And that's the deal. And you might still have a smaller percentage of the overall pie. And it's still worth it.

[32:17] And so finally, you've got the proof. So you've got the promise, you got the proof, you got the plan, and then you make the offer.

[32:22] So that you make it offer so good. They feel stupid, say, no, give them a Michael Jordan offer.

[32:26] If they're bigger than you, offer them more. If they're smaller, still offer a lot. And I'll give you a key little process on this. Help them grow.

[32:34] If you want to go after a middle sized influencer, they may want growth more than they want money.

[32:39] And so then offer them that instead or in addition. So you can give on these variables.

[32:44] It's like, okay, I can give you less than the economics, but I'm going to invest all these resources. I'm going to bring five guys. I'm going to hire for you to help you ten extra content.

[32:50] So we both win. Because real talk, if they are permanently associated with your brand, if they get 10 times bigger, guess who else gets 10 times bigger? You.

[33:00] Worth it. Now, I go through those four things. And the thing that most of you guys are going to struggle with is proof. So let's talk about that.

[33:07] So this brings to the second point of this little mini part, which is getting them to say yes.

[33:12] Every position has an advantage and a disadvantage. I really want you to drill this in.

[33:17] But for example, if you're brand new, you sell the benefits of being brand new. So for example, I used to help agency owners with my company Allen, which is the software for agency owners.

[33:29] And some of them service gym owners, which means they were direct competition of mine in my other company, gym launch.

[33:35] And so they'd say, well, hey, it's easy for you to get gym owners. You're the 800 pound gorilla in the industry.

[33:41] To which I would reply, well, one, I wasn't always the 800 pound gorilla. I started at zero like everyone else.

[33:49] But I promised a different set of benefits. I said, hey, these companies don't care about you. So if I was in your position, I'd be like Alex doesn't care about you. You're just a number to him.

[33:59] He just wants to hit quota. That's what his sales guys are doing. Right? You're going to get a sign to some dozen care account rep who just clocks in every day, that they trained for a couple of weeks just to get sped up.

[34:08] And they're never going to cater to you. But with me, you're my only brand partner. You have my full attention. I don't want to 100 partners. I just want one good one I can go all in on. Someone I can work day and night to help and grow.

[34:22] And so you have my contact you have myself on. You can come to my house. I'll cook you dinner. We'll be partners on this. It would be impossible for them to give you the same attention as me.

[34:31] Now if you're thinking, wow, that's not a bad point. Well, then I went with the advantage of being a hundred pound gorilla. Now from the a hundred pound gorilla. So once too much was then everyone in the industry.

[34:41] I would argue the opposite angle. I'd say, well, we have the best practice across a lot of accounts and I can feed them directly to you. This kid doesn't have any other experience. I can take the findings from thousands of accounts and feed them right to you.

[34:52] We have the infrastructure and scale to just plug you right into. This guy's got to hire all this. I've got specialists across all these different things that can help you at a higher level.

[35:01] And sure Sarah is only good at media buying, but she's better at media buying than his generalist.

[35:06] And we can help you scale on the business side because we already have. We know what we're doing.

[35:11] And you'll know that your audience is going to take care of because we have support in for sugar. Let's say this thing does crush.

[35:16] We'll guess what's going to happen to your little middle. He's going to get overwhelmed because he's never had this much attention before. We know how to do with it. We've done it before.

[35:23] And so the question is, do you want to trust your brand as someone who's just getting into the industry or someone with a track record?

[35:29] Do you want to risk what you work so hard for on someone who might not even be here in six months? We've been here almost a decade. And we're going to keep being here.

[35:38] So you're like, wow, okay, every position has an advantage and disadvantage. And you sell based on the position you have in the marketplace.

[35:46] So, play to your advantages. If you're new to the game, you're just getting into it and it's your first super influence of partnership, then you're going to have a nice personal touch.

[35:55] Care, flexibility, going all in. The owner mentality of this is us being partners. We're in this together. I'm going to do anything it takes to be successful.

[36:05] Now, if you're this guy, you're the 800 pound gorilla, then you're going to talk about track record. The best practices, the infrastructure, the specialists across functions.

[36:12] Brand association, they're going to get from associating with your brand where they don't get that with the minute.

[36:16] And once that happens, whichever play you have, they're going to say yes.

[36:21] And if they don't, then we go from our advantage to disadvantage to nos or guesses, which means we zoom out. So let's talk about that.

[36:28] If you don't have a track record, the other reason to overprepare and make your presentations exceptional.

[36:35] You say you can show them to other presentations that you make for other super influencers. So if I try to pitch Kylie on cosmetics and I make this beautiful deck and I show all these graphs and all this explanations.

[36:45] Guess what I get to use. I can take that when I go to Conomer Gregory and I say, this is some of the work that we prepared for other influencers.

[36:51] I'm not saying work we did for them. I'm just saying this is the type of stuff we do. Now, when you see that, what happens is people are like,

[36:57] Huh, they're going to see who you're pitching and they're going to see the work that you do over and over again. They're like, wow, this guy says stains, a high level of professionals and polish despite business he might not have won.

[37:08] And it's like, and the subtext is imagine what he do if we were actually working together. And that's what you want them to think.

[37:15] And so even if you didn't pitch them, this is the extra pro tip, is it even if you didn't pitch Kylie or Conor or Ryan Reynolds, you can show them alternative structures that you thought through.

[37:26] And if you show three different versions for three different influences, then maybe like, okay, I saw you prepared me and that was okay, but I really like what you did with Ryan Reynolds.

[37:34] I like that version. Can we do something like that for me?

[37:37] And so you give them more options to bait them in to engaging with you.

[37:42] And so all these things help you look more legitimate and increase the likelihood that you get one super influencer.

[37:51] And if you get frustrated, don't. The gap between no and yes is where the opportunity to make life changing money is.

[37:59] And so we went out over a lot of stuff today and to bring this home, I want to tell you guys two stories.

[38:05] One from a new business owner using the super influencer process and the other from a very large established business owner, because I want to cater to both people in the audience right now.

[38:12] So I'll start with who both use the strategy for life-changing wealth. So let's start with a big business owner.

[38:17] So some of you guys have heard of Tony Robbins in the U.S., they run a very large portfolio of businesses and they recently reached out to a super influencer, Matthew McConaughey.

[38:25] And Matthew McConaughey plugged in their infrastructure and they launched the art of living.

[38:29] So there's a product that Matthew was the front face of and they did the delivery on the back end.

[38:34] And they branded the product around what he wanted, the art of living.

[38:37] And they had the most people attend ever.

[38:40] They had two plus million people, read for the debt and almost half a million attend live and a million plus people see it.

[38:47] Unlike anything they'd ever had because they harnessed a single super influencer with a phenomenal brand.

[38:54] And I point this out to show you a single partner can bring in life-changing income.

[39:00] And so that's just an easy big business example.

[39:02] Alright, those guys had the infrastructure, they reached out.

[39:05] And I'm sure Tony Robbins is knowing all the presidents and things like that.

[39:08] He was probably one or two phone calls away from Matthew McConaughey and he said yes.

[39:11] Fine.

[39:12] But let's talk about a small business example.

[39:14] Because I think for some of you guys here this may be the most relevant for you.

[39:17] Since A-Lesters may feel out of reach for some of you and I want to be clear, I don't think they're out of reach for you.

[39:23] I just think you may feel that way.

[39:24] And so I want to at least meet you where you're at.

[39:27] Here's two U.K. guys, Manksen Fahad.

[39:31] And they added 44,000 per month in recurring revenue without ads or a follow.

[39:36] Neither of these guys says a following.

[39:38] And they weren't even the face and that's key, just like Congo with Logan Paul, known as who Congo is,

[39:43] known who knows who Manksen Fahad are.

[39:45] But when I show you they partnered with, you might have heard of them.

[39:48] And so here's what they did.

[39:50] They found an influencer at a view, a former pro bodybuilder from the U.K.

[39:55] He only had 50,000 followers at the time.

[39:59] And they reached out, just like I said in the presentation earlier.

[40:03] And then he replied, doing the exact thing that I mentioned in the presentation earlier.

[40:07] And then they told him that he'd be their only partner and the only client he had, just like I said in the presentation earlier.

[40:12] And they spent all their time growing his brand, which is exactly what they did to take him 50 K on because that's what he really cared about.

[40:18] And he agreed.

[40:20] And then they asked him if they'd want to start a paid-on-line community.

[40:25] And they told him, would be expected of him and gave him projections.

[40:29] Proof-promise plan.

[40:30] Here's the offer.

[40:31] And then they made the Proof-promise plan into presentation for him.

[40:35] Notice they focused on branding the product around him.

[40:38] It wasn't the Manksen Fahad community.

[40:41] It's the abue crew about people trying to get in shape, get healthy, get.

[40:45] And he's older now.

[40:46] So he's a slay little or demographic.

[40:48] Which I find actually a side note.

[40:50] Very funny because Manksen Potter, 20-old guys.

[40:52] All right, and Eddie Abuse in his 50 or 60s now.

[40:55] And so then they launched the community.

[40:58] And in the first 30 days, two 20-old guys with no following and no money got to 44,000 in monthly recurring revenue.

[41:05] And then United States at least, that's a top 1% income.

[41:08] And I want to be very clear.

[41:10] It's not because Manksen Fahad were able to take five years of work and compress it into one series of conversations.

[41:18] Because they were willing to give up the upside.

[41:20] They were willing to get rejected by the other 100 people they reached out to that didn't say yes so they could get the one that did.

[41:26] And so this work because Eddie's audience wanted more high value access to him.

[41:30] So Manksen Fahad made that happen.

[41:32] Very simple.

[41:33] And so they benefited from his brand and he benefited from their operations and the work that he wasn't willing to do.

[41:39] So when I talked to them, they were like, he just wants to make content.

[41:43] He doesn't want to do anything else.

[41:45] And so we just said, we'll do everything else.

[41:47] We'll bring the camera, we'll do the recording, we'll do the editing.

[41:50] We'll even put the stories up. They have the CTAs with the link so that we drive people with community and we'll manage the community itself.

[41:55] And we'll send you a cut of the money and he said, cool.

[41:58] And so they broke profit it.

[42:01] And so the point is, if you actually just follow this process, you can jump forward multiple levels of income quickly.

[42:09] Because you only need one super influencer to change your life.

[42:12] Just one.

[42:14] And so for more tax, six about this stuff, because we're getting close on time.

[42:17] I have free books and courses on outreach using affiliates.

[42:20] Also, if you zoom into that little picture of Manksen Fahad, you see a little book that they have in the background.

[42:25] The only book they have reference there.

[42:27] It's a good book. Check it out.

[42:29] And you can watch this stuff on my site.

[42:31] So I actually have the training for reaching out, getting affiliates, more in-depth stuff, more scripts, all this stuff.

[42:36] It's absolutely free on my site.

[42:37] Actors are not comfortable. It's our training. It's all free.

[42:41] And if you don't have a product to recruit a super influencer with.

[42:44] So the first ones, if you already have a product and you want to just go straight to get in and promote it, that's what that's for you.

[42:49] And if you don't have a product, then you can start like Manksen Fahad by building a community for an influencer.

[42:54] And the reason this is kind of like a one-fits, a one-size-fits-all product for most influencers is that pretty much,

[42:59] every influencer literally gets followed because people want access.

[43:03] They want more exposure to them.

[43:05] And so all you do is just have more exposure, more content, more access, just behind it pay wall.

[43:11] So that the highest fans get what they want and everybody else still gets stuff for free.

[43:14] So it's a win-win.

[43:15] And so if you want that, school.com forward slash games, it's also free to start.

[43:19] So if you're like, I don't know what the product, you can start one for free, and you can go start approaching influencers to do it.

[43:24] All right. So I hope that I fulfilled my promise to you from the beginning in the three steps super influencer process, which is one.

[43:29] Know how to pick them, two.

[43:31] Know how to get them and talk to you and three.

[43:33] How to get them and throw out your stuff so you can create life changing wealth.

[43:36] And hopefully I gave you the tools to lead Frogger income if you actually take action.

[43:40] So there's all your free stuff.

[43:42] Thank you guys so much. Enjoy.

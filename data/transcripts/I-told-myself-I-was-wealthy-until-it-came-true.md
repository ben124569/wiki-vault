[00:00] The most powerful things that change our behavior and our character are the stories we tell ourselves.

[00:07] I think that when I started out in business, I heard all these things in the personal development space.

[00:12] Like, ah, you should have, you should read these affirmations every morning, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[00:16] I never did that, and it was because it felt stupid to me.

[00:19] Now, that being said, there might be some people who've had life-changing results from doing that.

[00:23] But what I did notice is that the stories I would tell myself about myself were the things that changed my belief.

[00:29] They were the things that changed my character.

[00:32] And so a lot of times in some of my other videos I've talked about how entrepreneurship is about three things.

[00:37] It's about changing the beliefs that you have.

[00:39] It's about increasing the skill set that you have.

[00:41] And then the character trace that go along with that to make sure the skills are successful.

[00:44] So I'll give you a simple example for this.

[00:46] So a friend of mine, he started to fitness out.

[00:48] It was doing about 20,000 dollars a month.

[00:50] He was a top-game, a cross-fake games competitor.

[00:52] But he was really ashamed because he wasn't the winner.

[00:54] He was like, you know, really, really highly ranked one, but he wasn't the winner.

[00:58] And so he believed that his app wasn't good enough and so he never promoted it.

[01:02] So he grew to 20,000 dollars a month in revenue with him doing zero promotion.

[01:05] Right?

[01:06] And when he realized that it was okay for him to promote it and people got a lot of value from it in the app was good enough.

[01:13] He went from 20,000 dollars a month to like 150,000 dollars a month like that.

[01:18] And the difference was his beliefs.

[01:21] His skills were the same, right?

[01:23] His character trace were the same.

[01:24] He changed his beliefs, right?

[01:25] So let me give you a different example.

[01:26] So when I actually started out getting in my own business, right?

[01:30] I had a chain of gyms.

[01:32] This was a very, you know, this is a 10 years ago.

[01:34] I had chain of gyms.

[01:35] I knew how to run sales teams.

[01:37] I knew how to generate leads.

[01:38] I knew to do all these things.

[01:40] But what ended up happening was I had one missing piece, which was also a belief.

[01:44] I was actually trying to give you a different one.

[01:46] But I had a mentor come in and say, you need to be, you need to get in the licensing business.

[01:49] You need to license this model.

[01:50] Lots of people rather than doing the actual model yourself.

[01:53] And so I did make that transition.

[01:55] And then we went from, I think, you know, I think we did like $2 or $3 million to

[01:58] doing 7 in the next year.

[01:59] We did 28 million.

[02:00] So the year that we made the transition half like through is what jumped us from

[02:03] to a three to seven.

[02:04] And it was just in the last like four months that we saw this crazy gruff.

[02:07] And then we did 28 million the next year.

[02:09] And so it was because I had all these skills.

[02:11] And I also had the character traits.

[02:12] I just needed again to change my beliefs.

[02:14] I was trying to give you an example with the character traits.

[02:16] Let me think of one.

[02:17] So if you have a, for example, if I had had those skills,

[02:20] but I didn't have the character traits of being disciplined and being focused on one thing,

[02:23] I would have jumped between multiple entrepreneurial endeavors and never been able to see success.

[02:28] Because even though I had the beliefs about what was possible, like if I'd said,

[02:32] okay, I'm going to do gyms and I'm going to do caraparker,

[02:33] I'm going to do dentist and I'm going to do x, y and z, right?

[02:37] Until I had the character trait of focus, the character trait of discipline,

[02:41] then I would not have seen the success, right?

[02:43] And so the next answer question is, okay, well, if I have to have a line to beliefs,

[02:47] skills, and character traits at each level of the latter,

[02:50] because you can have.

[02:51] And this is what's crazy.

[02:52] When you see the overnight successes, this is what happens.

[02:54] I want to describe it to you, you understand it and how you can do it.

[02:57] So let's say that there's a ladder, all right?

[02:59] And you've got this pull on one side, you get the pull on the other side,

[03:01] you get the middle bar, okay?

[03:03] You need all three to move to the next level of the latter, right?

[03:06] And so for example, you might have the left side built up six stories above where you're at.

[03:12] And you might have the right side build up six stories, you know,

[03:15] uh, you know, ten stories from where you're at right now.

[03:18] But all of a sudden, if you change your character and that character trait development

[03:22] gives you three more runs, all of a sudden you go three runs because you already

[03:26] have the constraint has been removed.

[03:28] And so you can be more advanced in your beliefs than you're on your skills,

[03:31] or you can be more advanced in your character trait than you are in your skills.

[03:35] Or you can be more advanced in your skills than you're on your beliefs, right?

[03:37] And so it's having all three of those that are checked off at each level of entrepreneurship

[03:41] that gets you to one million dollars, you're a three million dollar, you're a 10 million dollar,

[03:44] you're a hundred million dollars, you're whatever it is, right?

[03:46] As you have to have all of them.

[03:47] And so what I, the point of this video, and I'm going to, is to get you to understand how to

[03:52] actually develop the soft things because the skills are straightforward, right?

[03:56] The skills are you just go by the course and you read the book and you consume the content

[03:59] like this and you practice, you apply, right?

[04:01] That's what you have to do.

[04:02] That's it.

[04:03] That's it, right?

[04:03] Um, one of the skills that I see lots of marketers these days not have is they don't know how to

[04:08] sell, they don't know how to develop a sales team, they don't know how to manage and grow a

[04:12] sales team, they don't want to lead a sales team.

[04:13] That's a skill they don't have.

[04:14] And as soon as they do, they go from 3 million to 10 million, like that, very, very easily, right?

[04:18] It's understanding that that's the skill deficit and as soon as they do it, boom, they block.

[04:22] I was fortunate because I had a ton of the skills in my skill toolbox, but I went for

[04:26] making nothing to tons because I had all of these rungs of this ladder already built out to a

[04:31] $30 million level except I just didn't have the beliefs.

[04:34] That was my issue.

[04:35] Kindily, I suffer from a lot of insecurities and so my wife was the one who was like,

[04:40] you can do this, like you don't have to have these gems, like you can license out the model, like you can,

[04:44] you can really succeed like this and I honestly just thought she was a really smart person and

[04:49] very wise and so I trusted her belief in me before I really trusted it for myself.

[04:55] And so hopefully you can have somebody like that in your life, but maybe that could be me.

[04:58] I trust in your skills and your beliefs so, so hopefully you can borrow some of that trust because

[05:03] I promise you the world does get better when you take those leaps of faith.

[05:07] But the point is, if you have these three things, the stories that you tell yourself,

[05:12] one of the things that Layla always says is my wife, she has her own channel, you can check it out,

[05:16] is she's like what's the evidence, what's the evidence that you're so bad at this, what's the

[05:20] evidence that you have because you keep beating yourself up about this, but what's your evidence,

[05:23] right? And so what I do when I identify a character trait that I lack or identify a skill that I don't

[05:29] have, we're a belief that I don't have. And this one I'll just specifically talk about the character

[05:33] traits because the thing that's really important is probably the one that people struggle with the most.

[05:36] What are the stories that you tell yourself about yourself? A lot of times I had dinner recently

[05:41] with a 5 million dollar entrepreneur and he was like, I had a lot of trauma when I was a kid and that's

[05:45] why I am this way. He speaks like he is this way because and I was like, I think that's a really

[05:51] convenient story to tell yourself about why you are anxious. Or why you exhibit anxious tendencies. I was

[05:58] like, but what if you did that and you just didn't exhibit anxious tendencies? What then?

[06:04] What if you just chose not to? What if you chose to not give power to that situation or that

[06:10] parent when you were growing up? Why they already made you suffer? Why would you let them make you

[06:15] suffer more by telling yourself that you gave you this character trait? And it's because it's

[06:20] uncomfortable for you to suffer through the change of changing your identity, right? But Lailand I

[06:25] both believe this is that your identity is fluid and you need to be able to change your identity

[06:28] in your character traits based on what the business requires if you want to grow. Right? Like if you're

[06:32] not a patient person, then you need to become patient macro, micro speed macro patients, right?

[06:38] If you want to develop a reputation, you need to become a person of integrity which means sometimes

[06:41] short term you have to sacrifice, right? You have to not make the quick buck. If you want to be

[06:45] disciplined and have focus, then it means that you have to be able to say no. Strategy means what do you

[06:50] say no to that still looks like it makes sense on paper? That's strategy. That's what it is.

[06:54] It's what things do we choose not to invest in, right? And the people who learn how to make the most

[06:59] money are the ones who know how to focus and that's a character trait. And so what you have to do is

[07:02] you have to peel on your past and say when did I exhibit these things? Is all of us have exhibited

[07:07] these characters trait at some point in our life? And then what you do is you say I am this way because

[07:13] and then you tell yourself the stories of the things you did in the past that exhibited those traits.

[07:18] And by doing that you'll start reminding yourself. So if I want to say like because I'll tell you

[07:24] I used to have more angry tendencies. I used to tend and trend towards being angry as response to

[07:29] things that I didn't like, right? But one of the things that I liked like that I try to tell my

[07:33] self is that I am wise, right? And this is a character trait that's probably been the number one

[07:38] character trait that I've tried to develop over the how many years just because I believe determined

[07:41] is the single greatest character trait you can have because if you make the right decisions,

[07:45] the whole world is your oyster, right? If you can make the right call, the whole world is your oyster.

[07:50] And so for me wisdom is that I'm more of a character trait that I wish to develop. And so when I

[07:54] think to myself, I am wise because I use the same formula that you that most people and most of us,

[08:02] myself included used to destroy ourselves with these insecurities, with these negative character

[08:08] traits that we believe we have. And instead of saying it affirmation, you tell yourself the story

[08:14] of why you're saying is true. You learn to argue against your own thoughts. And that's how you

[08:19] start developing this muscle, these traits that start to become a whisper and then a shout.

[08:24] And then they become the emanate from you and you project them when you walk in the room subconsciously,

[08:29] but it's a practice that goes from active to passive in your mind, right? If you are a patient

[08:35] person, if you are a kind person, if you are an integrity person, right? If you are a hard-working person,

[08:40] right? We all have these stories that we tell about ourselves. And so if you have a limitation right now

[08:46] on your character trait or traits, you don't feel like you are patient enough. You feel like you are

[08:52] too easily distracted. You feel like you don't focus enough. Then you need to start telling yourself

[08:56] the story, I am this way because not I am wealthy, stupid, in my opinion. I think our brains are

[09:04] too smart for that stuff. You have to give it the reasons. You have to make the argument. And I think

[09:08] instead of affirmations, if you make affirmations into arguments that you make with yourself every day,

[09:13] then those become things that will change who you are. And if you change who you are and how you

[09:17] make decisions, you'll change your entire life and you'll be able to watch your business grow as a

[09:21] result of who you have become. And so this is one of the things that was most powerful for me

[09:26] in my entrepreneurial journey. I had tons of insecurities, right? I had tons of anxiety. I had lots

[09:34] of anger. I had lots of perceived trauma and I'll say it that way because I don't even want to make it

[09:39] into trauma. That's what I perceived as trauma because I was a child in the world with the

[09:44] regulation of a child. And so things of course affect you more when you're kid. Everyone's traumatized,

[09:49] traumatized, perceived trauma as a child. Like if I go to a stage and I say hey, who here had a

[09:55] traumatic childhood in some instance or had a traumatic event occur? Everyone's going to raise their hand.

[10:00] So stop thinking that because you have trauma and I don't say this, I'll say this with, I'll say it this way

[10:04] better. For me, I chose to stop giving trauma, power. And I think if you can do that and you can

[10:13] tell yourself a different story about why you are, who you are and make arguments instead of

[10:18] affirmations, you'll be able to have stronger, faster change in the direction that you desire and

[10:24] you'll have more control over your emotional state. And then in so doing, you'll be able to level up

[10:29] the business that you have because most of the times when I see business owners, the reason

[10:32] to not see festivals, not because they don't have the beliefs or because they don't have the skills,

[10:36] it's just because of who they are. I had to call the other day and somebody hopped on and they were like

[10:40] like, ah, honestly, the guy was an asshole. He was like, man, I'm fully suck and I can never keep any

[10:45] good talent in the Bible, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I just paused and I was like, last

[10:48] not surprising. And he was like, what? I was like, have you met you? Like, I don't know what else to say.

[10:58] You know, have you met you? Like, I don't need to change this guy's marketing. Right? I don't

[11:02] need to change this guy's beliefs about his own business. He just has to change who he is.

[11:07] Right? And the only way that guy to do that is for him to get over the reasons that he tells

[11:12] himself it's okay to be who he is. And I think a lot of us do that. We give ourselves the excuse

[11:18] for being impatient. We give ourselves the excuse for cheating. Right? We give ourselves the excuse for being

[11:23] unfaithful. We give the excuse for being on loyal. Well, my dad was, where my mom was,

[11:26] where my brother was, or whatever, right? Or when I was growing up, or when from my town, I,

[11:31] XYZ, I'm this way because the cows is one of the most powerful words in English language. It's

[11:36] great for persuasion. Make sure you use it to persuade yourself in the right direction. So anyways,

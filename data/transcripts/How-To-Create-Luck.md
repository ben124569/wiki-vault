[00:00] What's going on everyone? I want to share a quick lesson that I had yesterday with my 18 year old neighbor

[00:05] Who's going through his entrepreneurial journey and this is a lot of fun for me because he's at ground zero

[00:09] So I'm I'm hearing you know the anxieties and the worries and the false beliefs kind of come up as they go

[00:15] And I get to you know confront them and kind of ask good questions and so

[00:20] Kind of the lesson or the theme of yesterday

[00:22] Was around volume and luck right and so

[00:26] One of the key differences that I see with people who are successful and and do grow and do scale

[00:32] Is that they have a firm understanding of

[00:36] Probability all right and what that means is chance

[00:39] What's the percentage likelihood that something happens right if you want to be an investor

[00:44] Right then you have to calculate the the risk associated with an investment

[00:48] That's a probability outcome if you are a business owner

[00:52] Right you have to gamble on marketing and assess the probability that you'll get a return on that investment right

[01:00] And what's interesting is that volume negates luck

[01:05] All right, so if you can put that in your brain volume negates luck and so luck is a word that people who don't understand

[01:12] Probability use as a as a space filler

[01:15] But if I were to say hey for every you know 100,000 emails

[01:19] I send I get 1,000 back and from 1,000 that I get back

[01:24] I know that I'm gonna close 500 of those people on a deal

[01:27] That's not realistic math. I would probably close a lot more than that but the point is

[01:32] But if I if I explain that math to you you probably I'd be like is that luck that I closed 500 deals

[01:38] You probably be like no

[01:40] That's just probability that's just I know that if I reach this many people the probability that there is one person who's interested in the

[01:47] The services that I have is high right and the thing is that if you do enough volume you can negate

[01:55] luck

[01:56] All right you can also negate skill

[01:59] Which is a bright product of the volume all right, so let me let me dive into that let me unpack that for a second

[02:06] So let's say you suck right because your brand new and of course you would suck because why would you be good because you've never done this before

[02:14] Whatever it is right and so this is like the conversation I'm having with my neighbor can imagine me as like

[02:21] Coach you get a deal you're all get him like of course you suck you're supposed to suck you're not supposed to be good

[02:26] Right and the thing is is like because of social media because of Instagram because of all these things

[02:29] Everyone especially you know the guys who are younger right now

[02:32] And maybe it's the same for guys who are in the 30th whatever is that they just immediately assume they should be a millionaire the first year

[02:38] Right, it's just like I should be a million why am I not a millionaire right and so that's what stops

[02:43] 99% of people from being successful because they're unwilling to suck right and it hurts through ego too much to be bad

[02:50] And so then they say this is in for me right and so

[02:54] Anyways back to the point of the volume verse, you know negating the luck in the skill component is that

[02:59] Let's say the normal numbers. Let's say I was I was coaching him on on cold calling right because that's what he's doing right now

[03:05] Nice to listen it's gonna take you know it should take you about a thousand cold calls to get

[03:11] You know one deal right and let's say he comes to me and he says why I've done five thousand right?

[03:17] I'm like okay and

[03:21] It's a lot of a deal like and

[03:24] You suck of course you don't have a deal you've never done this before do another five thousand because the thing is is eventually

[03:32] You will it will be unreasonable for you to suck anymore

[03:36] Right it would be unreasonable for you to not have found one person if you do this for a straight year

[03:41] And I'm trying to paint this longer picture for him a year and I know when you're 18 a year sounds like forever, but like

[03:47] a year if you did this for five years if you did nothing but cold cough for five years

[03:51] Do you think you would be good at cold calling?

[03:54] It was like yeah, probably I was like do you feel like you're much better now than you were one month ago when you started this thing was like

[03:59] I'm like nine day better like I can get past you know

[04:02] I can open now I can have coverage. I was getting hung up on and I was like right and so you have this binary measure of progress

[04:08] Which is I either close to sail or I didn't close to sail when in reality

[04:12] There's tons of bricks on the bridge on the way to getting the first dollar over right and the first deal the first dollar

[04:18] Independent of whatever you're doing is the whole ways the hardest one and it's because you have to learn a lot of little skills

[04:24] Before you get the big payoff right and most people learn one skill or don't learn a skill and then sync up

[04:30] This isn't for me right and so I told him that the only way that I would give him my blessing for him to quit is

[04:37] If the entire industry of wholesaling real estate had disappeared

[04:43] If you can convince me of the entire industry of wholesaling real estate is disappeared

[04:47] You will have my blessing to quit and

[04:50] Obviously that's not gonna happen because people have been making money and whole wholesaling real estate for a long time

[04:54] Right there's always going to be inefficiencies in marketplace between buyers and sellers right

[04:59] Unless some magical technology comes through which it might in 10 years who knows but right now it exists and so I said the only thing

[05:07] That's up right to you from what you want is skill and the only way to acquire that skill is volume

[05:13] Right and the thing is is when you have enough skill you get luckier

[05:16] Right you don't need to do 10,000 calls to get that one deal

[05:21] Because honestly maybe in the beginning that is that is that is the biggest laydown person you ever have but then it gives you conviction that it can happen

[05:28] Right and so

[05:30] The more volume you do the better you get and therefore the luckier you become but the big picture is that

[05:36] People who invest people who do business at larger scale just understand

[05:41] Probability right they understand that there is a percentage now what's what's the worst thing that can happen is

[05:47] Let's say his this is this is a fun scenario to think about is let's say his first day

[05:53] He gets on the phone and he somehow closes the deal

[05:56] Right and

[05:57] That one deal may have been that one deal out of 10,000 that if he had started at the other end of the call list

[06:03] It might have taken him a month to get there

[06:05] But he just happens to do it first how much do you think that messes him up a ton maybe maybe or probably even more

[06:12] Then working really hard to get there and so I don't know about you

[06:15] But I feel like I've definitely had occasions arrived lucked out and then I start questioning what am I doing different?

[06:20] What am I doing different? They might not be doing anything different you might have just hit the hit the gold nugget

[06:24] Way too early in the cycle and now you got to sift through a lot more nose to get to your next one

[06:29] You might have to sift through twice as many noses normal because you got to you got to account for the nose from the first one that you never actually hit right

[06:34] And so anyways as I'm walking him through this right

[06:38] It just reminded me of how when people are starting out they don't understand that the the concept of large numbers

[06:45] Right if you want to become lucky if you want to have

[06:48] Probability on your side you simply increase N increase the number

[06:53] Increase the volume and eventually you will strike gold and the thing is is that most people just literally don't go long enough

[07:00] He honestly was doing the the little system that he's that he's purchased the wrong way up until like a week ago

[07:06] And so I was like cool well your first three weeks are wasted that you weren't doing it the right way

[07:10] Right you've now officially been doing this for seven days

[07:13] Right you feel like it's unreasonable like do you feel like it'd be reasonable for you to have a top one percent in community United States after one month of learning a new skill

[07:20] He was like no and I was like then stop believing you should

[07:23] I was like if you do this for four years because he's not right now

[07:26] He's pushing off college to do this I was like if you do this for four straight years

[07:30] I was like do you think it'd be reasonable that you'd be able to close one deal a month by the end of that?

[07:34] He was like yeah, and I was like cool then you're already twice as wealthy as the average college person who would be leaving

[07:41] Right except you have four more years of experience than they do and so I'm trying to like paint these paint

[07:45] Just give him a different frame of seeing success and seeing the work that's required to get there

[07:50] And I was like what happens if what happens if it's six years?

[07:53] years when you're 24

[07:55] What happens if in six years 24 and you're not a millionaire yeah, what happens that?

[07:59] He was like I mean, I'd be you know, I was like what you'd be disappointed. You know a millionaire at 24?

[08:04] Come on man the thing is is

[08:06] He might actually be right if he actually sticks with it for six straight years

[08:11] But most people end up hopping and and always doing these half built bridges where they they learn two three four of the skills

[08:16] But there's 10 that they have to learn and they say this isn't for me and they jump to another one

[08:20] They start building a new bridge right when the reality is you just have to keep laying the bricks

[08:24] Keep laying the bricks keep laying the bricks all the way across the bridge from where you are to where you want to be and then the first dollar walks across

[08:30] And it takes a lot of time to put those bricks in place and to figure out which brick you're missing and the only way to do it is more and

[08:36] That is how you'll get better at the skill that gets the dollar across the bridge

[08:40] So anyways

[08:42] more more more sock as if my 18 year old workout afternoon lessons

[08:48] Hope you enjoy this if you do you know subscribe like comment all that kind of good stuff

[08:52] And I'll see you in the next video bye

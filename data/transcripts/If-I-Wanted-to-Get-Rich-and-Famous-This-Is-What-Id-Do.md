[00:00] These people all got rich in the influencer revolution.

[00:03] And in this video, I'm going to break down exactly how they did it,

[00:06] how I built my personal brand and how you can too.

[00:09] And yes, that's you.

[00:12] My close friend Taylor Swift has built one of the top 20 net worths of self-made women

[00:18] and has won the single strongest personal brands as a woman in existence two days.

[00:22] And here are five things that I learned from what she's done in building her brand that I used for me.

[00:27] The first thing that I learned from her, Long Javity.

[00:29] Gina How old she was when she made her first song, 16.

[00:32] It was in 2006.

[00:34] Tim McGraw was the first song that she released.

[00:37] These people have actually a very long time under their belts of how many years they put in

[00:43] to their personal brand.

[00:44] 14 years ago, a news force Harry Baldur, a meta-ness hiring country music singer from Henderson,

[00:49] ville High School.

[00:50] And so a lot of times we're measuring a two-year career against a 20-year career

[00:54] and everything compounds with time.

[00:56] She gained more popularity in the last 12 months than she probably did in the first 19 years,

[01:01] which sounds crazy but at the same time is also true.

[01:04] And so that's what Taylor did for Long Javity.

[01:06] But what did I do?

[01:07] My first podcast was in July of 2017.

[01:10] Six plus years that I've been making content.

[01:13] Now, to be fair, hers was at a larger scale and as I actually increased my scale,

[01:18] so too did my branding and awareness and reach follow.

[01:21] You got to do the same thing in a lot of quantity for a very long time

[01:24] before it really starts to get going.

[01:26] Don't compare your first year to someone's tenth year.

[01:30] The longer you do something, the better you get at it.

[01:33] Also, the longer you do something, the more you have done.

[01:36] Because if I post once a week for a year versus once a week for ten years,

[01:40] it's talking about 520 videos versus 52 videos.

[01:43] So I'm going to have all of the compounding of all those other videos that are going to be

[01:47] bringing people to my world that whole time plus 520 reps of being good at that thing.

[01:53] And just to give you some numbers around this, my first year posting videos on YouTube,

[01:57] I gained a total of 88,000 subscribers.

[02:00] The second year, I gained over 600,000 subscribers.

[02:04] And so far this year, I've done over 1.1 million subscribers.

[02:07] And so the more you do, the better you get, and to give you another extreme example,

[02:11] because I mentioned my podcast earlier, my first two years of podcasting,

[02:15] I got to a total of 2,000 downloads a month.

[02:19] And just fast forward to now 6 years in, I get about 2 million downloads a month.

[02:23] So these things can compound, they just take time.

[02:27] The second thing that I learned is scaling the unscalable.

[02:32] So she has famously been known for appearing randomly at some of her fans' weddings.

[02:42] To play songs for them, everyone loses their mind.

[02:44] All the iPhones come out.

[02:45] And then she goes viral on the internet for a few days.

[02:48] And newlywed couple got a surprise wedding pressure that they wouldn't dare to turn away.

[02:53] I am not a world-class performer, and I'm probably not going to be a performer at someone's wedding.

[02:58] But how can I take what Taylor did in scaling the unscalable in that micro-example and apply

[03:03] to what I do?

[03:04] Every so often, I'll do a sporadic Q&A live with people in our audience, in Mozi Nation.

[03:09] What do I do for a living?

[03:11] I invest in advice businesses.

[03:13] So what's a micro-eversion of that?

[03:14] I can invest in advice, someone who would never really have access to me in any other capacity.

[03:19] And so I can still take that and then multiply to thousands of other people because it's scale

[03:24] something that otherwise is on scale.

[03:25] I couldn't talk one-on-one to every single person on it.

[03:27] It's being possible.

[03:28] She can't shrub at every person's wedding.

[03:30] But she can still simulate the experience and to the same degree for me, the reason I put out all this

[03:35] free content, and I put out all my books, and my audio books, and the courses, and they're all free.

[03:41] And I do that because that's something that allows me to take a lot of energy, put it into one

[03:45] thing, and then distribute it to everyone.

[03:46] The third thing that I love from Taylor, vulnerability.

[03:49] Even in her songs themselves, she showcases her heart and her looking like the fool or the crazy

[03:57] person more times than not.

[03:59] And so what happens is she becomes still despyping the superstar that she is relatable at the

[04:04] lowest level to the girl that's still singing in her hairbrush into the mirror.

[04:10] Because they experience the same feelings Taylor does.

[04:13] The many flaws and pitballs and heartbreaks that she's had over her entire career,

[04:17] and just showing them to the public rather than trying to hide them.

[04:20] Taylor then, instead of having something that everyone can attack, flips it into a power

[04:25] because if you attack her for that, you attack her entire fan base for experiencing the same thing.

[04:30] And so she builds an army of people that will defend her because they resonate with the experience

[04:34] that she shared.

[04:34] Taylor Swift fans may have taken her hits on Shake It Off to Literally.

[04:39] It actually caused the equivalent of a 2.3 magnitude earthquake and then lasted several hours.

[04:44] That's a new record.

[04:45] Okay Alex, how are you vulnerable?

[04:47] All the stories I tell, the vast majority of them are me fucking up and losing all my money twice.

[04:53] She talks about relationships and love a lot.

[04:56] And so her equivalent of bankruptcy and losing everything is getting her heart broken.

[05:00] And so for me, I talked about the first time I whiffed on a sale.

[05:03] The first time I trusted a partner didn't work.

[05:06] The first time I had all my money stolen.

[05:08] The second time I had my money stolen.

[05:10] The multiple businesses that I had to shut down when I had nine businesses and had to shut

[05:14] eight of them down so they could go all on one.

[05:15] These are all stories that aren't like the fun cover of Forbes.

[05:20] Instead, there's just like, hey, I also was a small business owner and made a lot of mistakes that you

[05:25] might too.

[05:25] And so for another small business owner who hears that, they might be like, I've been there too.

[05:30] And then it takes something that seems crazy and unattainable, like a multi-hundred million

[05:35] dollar portfolio and makes it relatable.

[05:37] Thing number four from Tatei, I'm just going to put ownership.

[05:40] So one of the things that Taylor has done differently than many musicians is that she's a

[05:43] shrewd businesswoman.

[05:44] It's also why she's top 20 on Forbes for wealthiest woman in general, which she doesn't talk about

[05:48] as much.

[05:49] But girl knows how to make money.

[05:50] For last Airs Tour, it goes to her of $billion.

[05:53] On one tour.

[05:54] So what she's done is she independently publishes her stuff.

[05:57] And this has been something I think she's worked towards because in the beginning she sold

[06:00] our music and cheated by it back.

[06:02] Lots of drama.

[06:03] But she has moved towards this action.

[06:05] And because now she has more money and she has more leverage because she has such a big

[06:10] audience, she can negotiate different deals that other people wouldn't be able to.

[06:14] Now it's like, okay Alex, well, how do I do something like that or how do you do something like that?

[06:18] Right off the bat, I could have gone to a regular publisher to publish all my books.

[06:21] Like that would have been pretty much the normal path for the business influencer who wants to get

[06:25] the New York Times best seller, whatever.

[06:27] And so for me, I'd give away chapters left and right.

[06:30] I make it free on my podcast.

[06:32] No publishers like wait, I want to buy the right to your book so that you can only give

[06:35] it away for free.

[06:36] But I want to do that.

[06:37] And so in order to maintain control, I'm maintained ownership over my stuff because even in

[06:42] the short term, I could have taken a few million dollar check from a publisher just at front

[06:46] to write the book.

[06:47] But I'd so much rather own it for the rest of my life and be able to give it away as I see

[06:52] fit because I know at least for me conditions change.

[06:55] And me trying to make a decision today for something that I'm going to have to live with for

[06:59] the rest of my life feels steep even though it probably hurts more in the short term,

[07:04] which is why so many musicians and creators do sign away all their rights too early

[07:09] because the people who have been there before have seen a hundred other creators go through it

[07:13] and they know what's going to happen.

[07:14] But if you could have the stomach to be patient and actually believe that you're going to go

[07:18] all the way, then it never makes sense to sell.

[07:20] And so the last one that I learned from Taylor was shifting identity.

[07:24] Now, a different way of saying this is that her brand has shifted over time.

[07:26] Yeah, she's gone from a country music player to the girl who chases boys and gets her heart broken,

[07:33] to then just becoming this powerful woman today.

[07:36] And so she's shed her identity multiple times and transform her brand multiple times into what

[07:42] it is today. And I'd say that the Aeros tour, for example, is a great exemplifier of her

[07:46] leaning into this idea that she has said, Aeros in her life.

[07:50] Today, I didn't wear a no strip. What does that mean?

[07:54] It means I didn't wear a no strip today. And that's okay. I don't actually have my hat on today either.

[07:58] Why am I doing that? Does it mean that I'm making some big statement about it? No, I just want to be

[08:02] me. And if I ever feel like I have to dress the part to be on camera, I don't want any part of it.

[08:10] Play it out. If I then become beloved for something that I'm forcing myself into,

[08:16] then what I'm doing is I'm portraying something that's other than myself for people to fall in love with.

[08:20] It's I changing grow. I will grow further and further away from the thing that people love,

[08:26] which means that I will have to feel more and more like a fraud. I will have to fake it and pretend

[08:31] more and more as more people fall in love with this idol that I've created. That's not even real.

[08:35] And so for me, if I decide to change my shoes one day, I'm going to change my shoes. I'm not going

[08:39] to say, well, my whole audience expects me to wear crocs. I don't wear crocs by the way anymore. I

[08:43] think this is one of the beautiful things that creators have. And that us as individuals have.

[08:47] It's embracing who you are, which I think she's done unbelievably well and staying true to that

[08:53] North star rather than what critics wanted of it. And she's even changed that way in her music.

[08:59] And she's like, you know what? I'm just going to be me. That's what her audience is in love with.

[09:05] Her being her because she gives them permission to be themselves. And if you're curious,

[09:09] you belong with me is my favorite till Swift song.

[09:12] This is the rock. This is a life size cut out of him. Yes, I am huge. But not as huge as the rocks

[09:22] net worth, which just crossed multiple billions of dollars based on his stake in Teramana,

[09:26] Tequila. Here are four things I learned from the rock. First thing right off the bat is the

[09:31] same thing that I got from Tate which is longevity. Do you know how long the rock has been the rock?

[09:37] I mean, we even call him the rock, but he's Duane Johnson. And some people don't even know that

[09:41] he got his career started as a WWE wrestler. He started his career in 1996. Some of you guys

[09:47] watching this weren't even a glimmer in your father's eye in 1996. So point number one is longevity.

[09:52] Point number two is work ethic. One of the things that Duane Johnson has made himself famous for

[09:59] is how early he shows up to sets how late he will stay and how he never misses a workout no matter

[10:06] what. He's an flies into China. It's foreign the morning. He's lifting wings. Like what? The

[10:10] fuck when he started his career started at the bottom of the totem poem WWE. The guy that

[10:14] everyone beat up and he had to show up and work twice as hard. The same story is Kobe Bryant.

[10:19] Of like if they work out once if I work out three times, I'll just get better faster. He wasn't

[10:23] born this way. And even five years into that career, he wasn't Duane Johnson, the multi billionaire icon.

[10:29] He wasn't even still. Can you smell what the rock is cooking yet? Like,

[10:40] he hadn't really even reached the peak or the zine that I've been starting him. It took a long time

[10:45] for him to get there and he was able to stomach it because of his work ethic. And so how do I

[10:50] apply this to me? I have always taken the position that I work for the moment I wake up

[10:55] until the moment I literally can't work anymore, especially on the come up and so I'd work from four

[10:59] am until 10 and then from 10 am on, I would do my actual work with other people. And so I couldn't

[11:05] get the work I wanted to get done during the day because I had to run the business. And so I would do

[11:10] it before everyone else was up. So you have to work double time. You got to work the job that you

[11:13] have today, but in the mornings or the late evenings, you build for the job you want to have tomorrow.

[11:18] When I say job, I have a job too. Today, even though I own the businesses that were a part of,

[11:22] I still have a job to do. And so that job is doing what you have to do today and building for what

[11:27] you want to have tomorrow. Even in my current season, I spend six hours a day every day writing

[11:33] so that I can publish books on a regular cadence. And so my last book, I'm going to make all our

[11:37] leads. I spent six hours a day for almost two years writing that book and same thing for offers.

[11:42] And now with XYZ, secret book that's coming out, I'm doing the same thing. The first thing

[11:47] we'd say before I came in today here to film this with you, I edited my book for the first four

[11:52] hours of the day. So the third thing I learned from the rock is expanding niches. He became one of

[11:57] the most if not the most famous WD wrestler of all time. Now he could have stopped there,

[12:01] but he had bigger aspirations. And so over his career, he has continued to widen and

[12:06] broaden what he's associated him with, right? The very very beginning he was a football player.

[12:11] Then he spun that into the wrestling career and then he took that to the natural maximum.

[12:15] And then from there he started making movies. But what did he start with? He started with roles

[12:19] that required him to be in really good shape and show off that he was in it. If you remember his

[12:23] first two movies, the money returns than the later squirping king where he was actually a main character

[12:26] in that one, he was there pretty much to show off his physique. No one else in Hollywood is doing that.

[12:32] That town crews not real Smith. Now he's in Disney movies. So he's gone from being a really

[12:40] high-level football player to being bottom of the total WWE to top of WWE to low-low in the movie

[12:47] scene to high in the movie scene as an action career took the broadest space that you could have

[12:51] because when you get into Disney movies at that point, you're catering to everyone. Following the strategy

[12:55] has made him a mung and if not the highest paid actor today. And so for me you're like, okay,

[13:01] well how did you expand your niche? Well I started as just a dude who was in shape and then people

[13:06] started coming to be like, hey, can you help me get a shape? And I was like, sure, I guess and then

[13:10] somebody literally handed me money without me asking. And I was like, oh wow, I guess I could make

[13:14] money doing this. So then I got into the business of helping getting people in shape. And then I was like,

[13:17] maybe I could open a gym so that I opened a gym. And then I started doing what with the gym and

[13:21] the people who owned gyms were like, hey, can you help me run my gym? And I was like, I guess so,

[13:25] I don't know if this is business. And then again, literally someone handed me $5,000 and said,

[13:29] launch my gym and I said, I guess so. And then I took that to $5,000 locations. And then from there,

[13:34] it was like, hey, how did you expand this B2B licensing thing? So you went national businesses of that

[13:39] side started to approach me. And that has literally been my entire career. Do something really

[13:43] well, people ask me about it and then I say, okay, well, I'll show you how I did that. And each of

[13:46] these transitions has actually been forced every single time someone literally handed me money and said,

[13:51] can you do it? And I was like, I guess so. And then that's how it started. So on the talk of money,

[13:56] the fourth thing I've learned from the rock monetization. So the rock has spent the first 20

[14:00] plus years of his career, not really monetizing his direct brand. Now he was in movies, he obviously

[14:05] gets paid to do that, he was paid to be in the WTV. But he didn't really own anything that he was able

[14:10] to really push. And then all of a sudden, the last three or four years, he came out with Zowa,

[14:15] which is the energy drink and supplement line. He came out with Project Rock with Undrohrmer,

[14:20] which was a collaboration between him and them. And he came out with Terra Monna, the Tequila.

[14:25] And his slice of Terra Monna, I believe, is 30% stake in the company, which now valued over $6 billion.

[14:30] He's been very strategic about the highest leverage ways that he can monetize his brand

[14:36] without deluding who he is. We've all seen those actresses who come out with an alcohol line now,

[14:42] and they don't even drink, or they come out with makeup, and they actually are known for their natural

[14:46] look. Things that just obviously don't make sense. Now, would a people fall in with a rock for?

[14:50] They love the fact that he works super hard, but he also has cheat days on Sunday.

[14:55] He also sips the tequila and was doing that for a very regular basis, and people knew he

[14:59] loved tequila. And so it made sense for him because it wasn't a change. It was just reinforcing

[15:04] more of what he already was. And so if you think about how you want to monetize,

[15:08] you want it to be more of what you already are. And this is where people miss the mark. They're like,

[15:12] what's the thing that I can sell to the most people? What's the thing that's got the highest ticket?

[15:16] It has to reinforce the association that people have come to love about you. And so

[15:22] instooting the rock and thanks to these other influencers when I'm paying a lot of attention to

[15:27] is how they're choosing to monetize peacefully. How do I monetize tastefully?

[15:31] Well, I own companies. And so when companies consume my stuff and learn and grow and make more money,

[15:39] then they hit me up and say, hey Alex, can you help me grow and scale my company and invest?

[15:44] And I say, sure, if they're awesome. And if they're not, I just say just enjoy all the other stuff.

[15:48] I don't need 25 Facebooks. I actually want. And so I'm okay with the fact that 99.9% of people

[15:55] will only quote take from it and not give anything back. And I'm cool with that. It's the same

[15:59] reason it would be weird if I came out with the luxury watch line or a suit line of 3P suits

[16:06] that would be completely off-brand. Now, do a lot of my people on my audience probably wear suits

[16:10] and do business? Yes. Would that be a high ticket? I didn't like a public like a lot of money on?

[16:14] Yes. Does it make sense for my brand? No. And so that's the idea is that we have these associations

[16:20] that people have come to love you for and then to go counter that just to make money everyone sees it

[16:25] and then they lose trust with you. You can follow bankruptcy when you go way too far into debt

[16:30] and then you can start over. You can't follow bankruptcy on a reputation. Once it's ruined,

[16:34] it's ruined for life. And it takes a very long time to build one and a very short time to lose one.

[16:39] And so if you ever have the choice between reputation and money, always choose reputation because

[16:45] this one you can't get back. You can always make more money. All right, the rock. Now we're going to

[16:50] Mr. Beast. So first things first that I learned from Mr. Beast was his longevity and you're going

[16:59] to hear me keep repeating this and the reason I say this because everyone keeps comparing themselves

[17:02] to someone's 10th year. Okay, starting with what 13? What's up guys? Over excited generic YouTuber here.

[17:08] He's 11 years in of doing this at an obsessive rate. I feel like there's there's two stages in

[17:14] most people's career. There's the time they start and the time they get serious. He happened to do both

[17:19] on the same time. And so if you can decrease the time between when you start and when you commit,

[17:23] you'll start seeing the benefits of commitment sooner. Like I see so many people who got into fitness

[17:28] and they say I've been training for five years and I say have you been training for five years

[17:32] or do you have been going to the gym on and off for five years? And they're like, well, I've been

[17:35] training for six months. I've been going on and off for four and a half years. And I'm like, well,

[17:38] then the first one half years was literally just to prepare you for the first six months of digging this

[17:42] year. You're only six months into your working out career, not five years. And so they then compare

[17:46] themselves to somebody five years and be like, why am I not there? It's like you're really only six

[17:50] months in. Go pro. Be a professional and take it like your job. Number two, this is a big one. This is

[17:56] super tactical. So I was having a conversation with Mr. Beast and I was like, we're not trying to make

[18:01] you know, clickbait videos. We're going to make stuff that people feel is, you know, really have

[18:04] quality, et cetera. And he looked at me and he just looked at like I have four heads and he was like,

[18:08] you absolutely make clickbait videos. He's like, you just need to make the clickbait true.

[18:13] And it was such a great mindset shift for me because when I think about marketing, I think about the

[18:17] same way. If you want to market a product, make the crazy claim. But back up the crazy claim.

[18:23] Since somebody you guys have been commenting that we've kind of up our game on our videos and a lot

[18:28] of it comes from this frame of mind of like, how can we make it in seeing claim and back it up with

[18:32] even more in the same video. Number three is doubling down. The day he started was the day he went pro.

[18:37] He said he was either going to become a pro youtuber or he wasn't going to do anything at all.

[18:41] And he has shown that with his actions. As he makes more money, he puts all that back into

[18:45] the next videos and he has consistently done that since day one. And if anything, his current

[18:50] channel still runs as they quote non-profit in that it's not profitable because he actually chooses

[18:55] to monetize elsewhere through festivals and Beastberger and some of his other ventures.

[19:00] He has continued to reinvest in his compounding vehicle and you're notice compounding his

[19:03] a common theme around all these people that we're talking about is that he took the extra

[19:07] rather than putting his pocket, he said, would if I put it back on black again. And it is very much

[19:12] a gamble, but if you know what you're doing, you become the house. So for me personally, I have

[19:18] been willing to double down on my career and make big bets that otherwise didn't make sense.

[19:24] My first career as a consultant, most people said, oh, you should go do more of that.

[19:29] But I took all my learnings from being a consultant and then started a gym, which was a big bet for

[19:33] me, but I was doubling down on what I believe to be true. Then I scaled my gyms to six locations

[19:38] and then I just basically walked away from them. I fired sold them in 90 days and then started

[19:42] the licensing business. And from there, doubled down there until now, we now have actors to not

[19:48] come our portfolio of companies. Even when I was thinking about selling gym launch, so many people

[19:52] were like, dude, you have this amazing business that you don't have to do anything for that

[19:56] Prince, you have millions of dollars on London personal income. What is wrong with you? Why would you

[19:59] sell? Because the thing is that they will project their goals onto your reality. And as long as

[20:05] your reality is above their goals, they will not understand you. And so if you have big goals,

[20:11] then you only have to listen to you because whatever your is is, if you satisfy their checkmark,

[20:16] it's like, I satisfy you not me. And so being willing to double down and burn the boat and pursue

[20:20] the dream that you actually want is risky, but in my opinion, when I die and I look back,

[20:25] well, when I die, I won't be able to look back. But right before I die, and I look back,

[20:29] I'll be so much more proud of the failures that I risked than the successes that I didn't.

[20:34] And the fourth thing I learned from Mr. Beast was packaging, specifically around media. I watched

[20:40] Sam Take Apart someone else's video and in the first five seconds he said stop the video. And this

[20:44] is somebody who had already had 10 million views in the video and was upset that they didn't have

[20:47] 30 million views. And he said, oh, you didn't match the thumbnail to the first five seconds.

[20:51] You didn't confirm it. He was like, well, that's it. He's like, I don't need to watch any more of the

[20:54] video. That's why it's not a 30 million video. And it was such a tiny tactical detail,

[20:57] but it made such a massive difference in the amount of views. I now appreciate how important

[21:02] how you package the content you have. So for example, some of you guys have noticed that we

[21:07] run split tests on the thumbnails. And the reason for that is that there's two things we look at.

[21:11] One is how many people click, but then how long people who click based on that watch. And

[21:16] you'd be amazed that there's sometimes 20, 30% increases the amount of time that someone will watch,

[21:21] simply based on how the video was framed. And so for us, we want to make real business

[21:26] education accessible for everyone. And making an accessible for everyone means that we have to package

[21:30] it in a way that makes it attractive to everyone. And fulfills the promises that we made in the packaging.

[21:35] I made a video all a long time ago about luxury goods. Now the whole video is just about

[21:40] understanding how luxury goods fits within a pricing matrix and a marketplace. Sounds kind of boring.

[21:45] But I was like, huh, how can I package this in a way that would make it more accessible for more people?

[21:50] And recently, Bernard Arno, who owns LVMA, which is a holding company that owns many, many luxury brands

[21:56] that you've heard of, flash them on the screen. He had just recently come to the richest man.

[22:02] And so I was like, oh, this is relevant. How did he become the richest man through luxury goods?

[22:07] And just doing that dramatically improved how many people would benefit the video because it

[22:12] became timely, it became trending. And he was around someone who already demonstrated that it was a

[22:16] viable business model. And the last one I went ahead on from Jim is resourcefulness. Now a lot of people see him

[22:21] today as the person who spends a million dollars on every video and he's giving all this money away and they're like,

[22:26] I could never copy Jim and you're right, you can't today. But what you can copy is the things that he did to get here.

[22:31] And so his first ever viral video was him counting up as high as he could and I think he got to have

[22:36] a hundred thousand plus he now how much did that cost? Nothing just imagination. And as soon as he made

[22:42] ten thousand dollars from that video, he gave it to a homeless guy. This is not click-fate. I'm going to give a random

[22:47] homeless guy ten thousand dollars today. And then that video, and viral. He's consistently just said,

[22:53] how can I use what I have? Which if you follow any of my content, the first rule of entrepreneurship

[22:58] is use which you've got. And he has exemplified that in his content. And so how do you relate this to me?

[23:03] Well, when I started, I didn't have the big media team that I have today. It was just me and a webcam.

[23:08] And then from there, we're like, okay, let's get one with just like some lights in a professional camera.

[23:12] And then it was like, okay, I'm actually going to have a videographer here present with me when I do these

[23:16] videos. And then it was like, you know what, we might actually edit the videos rather than just

[23:20] trimming out the front and the end and the umps. It didn't make sense for me at the beginning to have

[23:25] a massive media team because I didn't know what I was doing. And so as we've gotten better,

[23:29] we've gotten better. And we've used the resources we have to continue to grow the team so we can make

[23:33] more stuff for you guys. I would recommend not beating yourself up for the fact that you don't have

[23:38] resources, but learning the skill of resourcefulness, which you will need throughout the entirety of your

[23:44] career, because at every level, you have to always be resourceful. And if you don't learn how to

[23:48] be resourceful when you have nothing, you're not going to be resourceful when you have everything.

[23:51] Thanks Jim. Appreciate that in the chocolate bars. Check out these. Right off the bat, what did I

[23:59] learn from Joe? Long Japanese, you're like, wow, Alex, why do you keep saying that? Because it

[24:03] fucking matters. All right, I keep repeating it because not one of these people is an overnight

[24:07] success. All of these are decade plus successes. And most of them are multi-decade successes.

[24:14] Joe started doing stand-up comedy in Boston in 1988. And for many of my audience, you also weren't

[24:20] alive then. On top of that, he got his first real break when he started doing fear factor,

[24:25] which is a show where he's basically emceeing girls get in rats thrown into a tub with them where

[24:30] they have to keep their mouth open. Joe's had the humility, there are his entire career,

[24:34] to be willing to do whatever it took. And I don't think when he was a little kid and was like,

[24:39] I want to be a star. He was like, I'm going to go MC Girls in Bikinis having bees all around them

[24:45] dripping with honey. I don't think he thought that, but he was willing to take the opportunities

[24:49] to present it itself. And he's been willing to stick with it for a very, very long time.

[24:54] Second thing I've learned from Joe, you know what, I think this is important enough that I'm

[24:57] going to put on here because he has restarted his career at zero multiple times. Like, he was

[25:03] a stand-up comedian, but then he's doing MCing for TV show. Probably wasn't as good as he is now when

[25:08] he does it for the UFC, one of the biggest sports in the world. He was willing to be humble and do

[25:12] it and suck. And that's why so many losers lose this because they're not willing to lose. They

[25:18] cannot accept sucking. And so they always lose. By default, because they never start. Yeah, until

[25:23] you win, no one pays attention to you. Get used to it. And the reason all these people look

[25:28] like overnight successes is because you just happen to find out about them when they hit it.

[25:32] And so you just mark the fact that when you find out about them is when they started doing it,

[25:37] which is ridiculous, but it's a cognitive bias. Just because you experience the world that way

[25:41] doesn't mean it's true. So for me, I have basically restarted my career multiple times. Probably

[25:46] the biggest slice of humble pie that I've had at E was going from being a white collar consultant

[25:51] on my way to Harvard to being a personal trainer at a local gym. So not even an owner or a manager,

[25:58] a front line trainer getting paid minimum wage. And so when you go from a six-figure job to a minimum

[26:03] wage job, your status changes a lot. And that was tough for me. But I knew how miserable I was doing

[26:11] the thing that I didn't like. And I believed that this wasn't what I was going to be doing

[26:16] for the rest of my life. And I knew that for me, this was a season of learning not earning. And so

[26:21] I never thought I was going to be stuck at minimum wage. I just knew that I felt like I was just

[26:24] getting paid to learn. So I was like, I would pay to be here. So the fact that they're paying me is just

[26:29] a great deal for me. Because the thing is, as you compare yourself today at D0,

[26:34] whereas what I left, I was probably at year six in terms of like all the things I did to get there.

[26:39] I had to prep for SATs to get into Vanderbilt, to graduate in three years, to have

[26:44] be president and vice president of the pilot team, president of the fraternity. And then

[26:47] do all the case to any stuff so I could get the consulting job and did that for two years and then

[26:51] prep for the GMATs. Like I was six years into that career. But I started over at zero because I just

[26:56] wanted something else. And all of you guys are watching this right now, you're watching this personal

[27:00] brand being built and all this content that I'm putting out. I just learned this stuff like two or

[27:05] three years ago. Right now I started making my podcast six years ago. But for three years, I didn't

[27:09] do anything else besides my podcast. But I didn't really go pro on making content and

[27:13] so the end of 2019, 2020. I didn't know anything. And so I hired people and was like, hey,

[27:18] can you tell me they're like, you suck and I'm like, yeah, I'm aware of that. And I told the first guy

[27:22] that I hired for YouTube. I said, I'm willing to do this for 10 years. And I was like, if it doesn't

[27:27] work after 10 years, I was like, I'll stop. And when we obviously took it in house, he said, on the way

[27:32] out, he was like, I just want you to know that you changed my entire perspective because I've never

[27:36] had a single person tell me that they were willing to wait a decade for something to work. He's

[27:40] like, every other person who comes to me is like, how do I get 100K subscribers, 90 days? And it's

[27:44] unsurprising now that we actually probably have a bigger subscriber race than anybody he never worked with

[27:50] because we approached it differently. I'm just willing to suck because I believe that someone

[27:53] else can get good at it. So can I. Number three, this is probably the most important one. You are the

[27:59] niche. I want to be really clear. There's the difference is being having a personal brand and building

[28:06] a brand into business. Building a brand into business is going to be around the products you sell

[28:10] in the avatar or the audience that you market to. So if you want to build content for a specific

[28:15] business that sells widgets, then it should probably people using that widget within the context

[28:19] they would use it in. But you building a personal brand should be true to the person just like you're

[28:23] being true to the product and be encompassed all the things that you really are. What is Joe Rogan's niche?

[28:30] Is it politics? But then he does all this biohacking stuff. Oh, well, okay, was it fitness?

[28:34] Well, then he talks about aliens, like a lot. Okay, well, is it fighting because he's really

[28:39] deep into fighting? But he's also a big time stand-up comedian. Well, shoot, what is it?

[28:44] It's none of them and it's all of them. It's Joe Rogan. Because if I said all of those things together,

[28:48] hey, what big celebrity do you know who's in the biohacking, aliens, politics, technology,

[28:54] fighting and comedy? You feel like Joe Rogan? Because that's his unique thumbprint. Now, all of those

[29:00] are different categories and in different proportions. So for example, he's got health, he's got

[29:05] well on his show, which of them takes up a greater percentage. Well, he probably talks more about

[29:09] biohacking and health and things that are going on in the total U.S. around health compared to

[29:14] comedy. Now, he still has comedians on his show and talks about comedy stuff. But the proportions

[29:19] different. So not only is it the number of categories, but it's the proportion between the categories

[29:24] that makes the unique thumbprint of the creator. Poit being, if you're building a personal brand,

[29:29] speak to things that you know. And if you're like, well, I don't know very much. You start with

[29:34] the one you know. Because you've lived your life up to this point and you spent time one way or another,

[29:38] which means that there are things that are unique to you that you were deeper on than somebody on the

[29:42] street. And one of the hardest parts about this and this is me just being with you is that if you

[29:45] know really well, you actually assume everyone does. If you were raised around cars, for example,

[29:50] and your dad was a mechanic, you just like love that stuff. You probably know a lot more about cars

[29:54] than the average person. I don't know anything about cars. I'm not really interested. But there are

[29:59] people who are. And so you make a content about the things that you actually care about.

[30:05] You will be knowledgeable. And there's a difference between telling people what they should do

[30:10] and sharing the things that you know. It's subtle, but one is preaching, one is teaching.

[30:14] And you want to be the teacher. Not the preacher. I think one of the things that he has given me

[30:18] permission to do is talk about all the things that I'm interested in. Because I spoke to many

[30:23] people and they're like, do you don't talk about your like death philosophy stuff? It's like really

[30:27] dark. And they're like, just just talk about money stuff. But if you're going to be talking

[30:31] my stuff, you should wear a suit because you want to look at that part. But I don't dress that way.

[30:35] I dress like this. But they're going to look like a meathead. So that which of these things is Alex

[30:39] and Rosie? All of them, none of them at the same time. Your brand will be stronger based on

[30:45] how closely it matches who you really are and the things that you genuinely care about. And as

[30:51] those things change, so too should your brand to reflect that. Rather than say, oh, I had a mustache

[30:58] for five years, which by the way, I did. I had a big gunslinger mustache for five years. And everything

[31:02] that was public had a gunslinger mustache. And then I was like, you know what? Kind of want to do a

[31:06] beer. It's so I put a beer on. And so what happened to my brand? It changed. But that was okay

[31:12] because that's who I was then and this is who I am now. And maybe in the future, I'll shave one day.

[31:18] And you know what? I'll still be me. And so if you want to measure the strength of a single

[31:22] person in your audience in relation to your brand, it's how many interests that you have that a

[31:28] person in your audience shares or overlaps with. If I like politics and fighting and comedy and

[31:35] hell and aliens, I'm probably going to love Joe Rogan. On the flip side, if I don't like any of those

[31:41] things, but I kind of like help, then I might kind of like Joe Rogan because I don't like the

[31:45] majority of the other stuff he talks about. And so taking this into my personal context,

[31:49] if someone likes trading cabs, they like desserts, they like being in shape, they like business

[31:56] in making money, they like philosophy. They're probably going to like my stuff. And some of the business

[32:02] people are like, dude, I wish you could just only make business content. It's like, but that's not

[32:05] me because I don't only talk about business, but the point is, is that like, I don't want to shy away

[32:10] from who I am so that I can meet some artificially generated algorithm character that doesn't

[32:16] really exist. And I think that in the short term, if I did that, I probably would win in the short term.

[32:22] But in the long term, I would resent who that character become because they had been to become so far

[32:26] away from who I really am. And then I would feel like a fraud and then you would see it in my content

[32:31] because I wouldn't feel legit. Number four, is that Joe only talks about sponsorships he believes in.

[32:38] Now, he obviously is equity in some of the companies that he promotes. He had a big exit with

[32:42] on it, which is a multi-hundred-million dollar supplement brand that he basically pioneered an

[32:47] alpha brain in the product that he talked about a lot. When we came up with alpha brain, it was the

[32:51] first one that I ever tried that it was like, this is like a very clear difference. But he's in a

[32:57] position where he could get, oh my god, if FTX wanted him to promote their product because I'm sure

[33:03] they did, he could have made a massive check from them for promoting it. But he didn't believe in it.

[33:08] So he said no. And so a lot of what he's defined himself by is all the things that he only truly

[33:13] wants to win. So he only promotes stuff that he actually wants to win and he believes in. And you

[33:18] can hear it in the endorsement that he gives. He's like, I use this stuff. And so I'm letting you know

[33:22] about it. I take a giant athletic greens every day and he doesn't come across seals and he just

[33:28] lets you know why he takes it. And so in my opinion, the thing that I've learned from Joe is that

[33:33] you want to promote things that are minimal changes in your behavior. So ideally, you exist exactly

[33:40] the way you were before except you just happen to get paid for something that you would already be

[33:44] willing to tell someone about. Now that massively limits the amount of things that you can promote.

[33:49] But that's okay because you don't want to be these people who just show a hundred things because

[33:54] by doing that, you also dilute the brand that you have because everyone knows it's not you because

[33:58] no one's interested in a hundred things. You might only be interested in two, three, four, maybe five

[34:03] things. And that's probably what you should limit your quote, brand bullets two. And the fifth one

[34:08] is no hacks. All right. This is so, so big because you can think about Joe is almost the anti-algorithm.

[34:14] It just says episode whatever in the name of the guest. And he doesn't cut all the stuff so you can

[34:18] make it the most action-packed scene. He just let's it cut unedited raw and uploads it. His Instagram

[34:25] he says he subscribes to post and ghost, which is he posted and then he ghosts it. They're not

[34:30] optimized. He just uses the platform as somebody who uses the platform and people choose to follow

[34:36] him because they are interested in what he is interested in. So he is interesting because he is

[34:41] interested if you look at every one of these celebrities. If you look at their social media,

[34:47] it doesn't look like their influencers. But they have more followers than almost all the influencers

[34:53] put together. That are what I would consider the hacky influencers. I always try to like algorithm

[34:58] pop or trend hop. You don't see Rogan hopping on the Taylor Swift trend for his Instagram. He just

[35:04] is Joe. I get approached by so many people who DM me saying, hey man, I don't think your LinkedIn

[35:08] is optimized. Hey, I don't think your Instagram is optimized for growth. Hey, I can do a shout out

[35:14] Let's do a giveaway to do 20,000 followers, 50,000. Whatever it is. None of those builds brand.

[35:21] They are simply trying to exploit an artificial hole or inefficiency in how an algorithm works.

[35:28] And if you face your brand on algorithm exploitation, you're basically you don't want to

[35:33] flaw in a system that will get fixed. And so what you want to do in my opinion is that you want to

[35:38] align what you make with what the platform wants. Rather than what the platform doesn't want

[35:43] and you hacking around it. What the platform wants is for you to make engaging content that an

[35:48] audience finds interesting. So they stay on the platform. That's it. And so the best way to make

[35:53] interesting content is to talk about the things you are interested in. If you post things that are

[35:57] real for you, you will be real for your audience. Rather than just something that's served on

[36:02] their new speed, that they can immediately go to your feed and see that all you do is trend hop.

[36:07] Which means that you actually don't exist at all.

[36:12] Kylie was actually the last chink in the armor for me deciding to start making content.

[36:18] And the reason for that was she got the cover forves as a quote billionaire at age 20.

[36:23] And I saw that and at the time I thought I was hot shit for being a multimillionaire. And when I saw

[36:29] her do that, I have a fundamental belief about business that if someone makes more money than me,

[36:33] they are better at the game of business in some way than I am. And that I can learn from them.

[36:37] And the big difference between what Kylie was doing and what I was doing was her brand.

[36:42] And she had built that through content. The first lesson that I'll say that I have learned from

[36:47] Kylie was yet again longevity. Because yes, she has a billion dollar brand and she's very young.

[36:53] But guess how young she started being on national television? She appeared on national television

[36:59] for the first time 20 years ago on keeping up with the Kardashians as a little bit.

[37:06] She's been in the game two decades. And so as much as she is young, she still has put time

[37:11] under the bar. And if you see a common theme for all these people, even the youngest people here

[37:15] haven't at least a decade and often multiple decades under their belts. So staying with it for a long

[37:21] term yet again rules the day. Number two is that she showed me leverage. Now leverage in multiple ways.

[37:29] Number one is that she is leverage from her family. She hangs out with other people who are famous.

[37:33] One of the easiest ways to get more exposure is to hang out with people who already have exposure.

[37:37] And she did that early on and has done that through our career. Number one. Number two is that she

[37:41] uses media. She records only one time and millions and millions of people can see it. And so by using that

[37:46] she gets more for what she puts in and so that's being able to accelerate her career. Number three is that

[37:51] based on the actual products that she has chosen to sell with her brand, she does things that scale.

[37:58] And so imagine if she was selling a tax service. It'd be very difficult for her to scale that to

[38:03] her audience. But if she sells a lip kit, she can make a gazillion of those. The only real

[38:08] constraint on that would be capital and she's got that. And so she was able to get a high leverage

[38:13] brand with a huge audience that she built with a long time and media and funnel it into something

[38:19] has a lot of leverage that she built one time and then could print over and over and over again to

[38:23] her entire audience. Just simply the business she chose to select was one that better suited a

[38:29] mass market be to see brand. A lot of creators make the wrong mistake here. I see guys starting a

[38:34] restaurant when they have a national brand, not to say that you want to make money. It's just that you

[38:39] want to make as much money as you otherwise could in a better vehicle. Number three is that she outsources

[38:44] her weaknesses. So the things that she is in charge of is the product and the marketing. So she

[38:52] cares a lot about the lip kits and she cares a lot about the messaging and how things appear

[38:56] and how she disseminates and promotes it. But everything else that she's not an expert. She's probably

[39:00] not an expert at third-party logistics. She's probably not an expert at actually manufacturing stuff.

[39:04] She's probably not an expert at running warehouses. She's probably not an expert at even building

[39:08] websites. But based on the brand that she has and the success of the company she has, we could

[39:12] probably make a leap of faith to say that she's pretty good at product and she's also pretty good

[39:16] promoting. And so by doing the things that she's good at, she's been willing to give up some of the

[39:20] pie to other people who have the next release. So she can leverage the fact that somebody else has

[39:26] 20 years in third-party logistics partners with them and to be fair, this is something you see across

[39:30] the Kardashians they do very well is that they don't try and own the entirety of the pie. They say,

[39:35] how can we all win here? And I'll take this from the late Charlie Munger. I don't need every

[39:39] last dollar because he believed that it's either a good deal or it isn't. And if it's a great deal,

[39:44] I'm going to make his honey money. And if it's not, he doesn't need to chisel away percentage points.

[39:47] And I think I've seen that across all of the Kardashians and how they structure their deals.

[39:51] They're willing to let other people in to leverage 20 years of experience to not have to start over

[39:56] at ground zero. They start at your 20 on someone else's career because of all the learnings and

[40:01] connections that person has so that they can just jump that much further forward because I don't

[40:05] about you, but I'd rather than 20% of a $20 billion company than a hundred percent of a million

[40:11] company. And number four is that she embraces controversy. They have time and again leaned into

[40:18] what other people deem as controversial and ridden the wave of attention that it brings with it.

[40:23] Kylie and her entire family has been willing to do that. Now that being said, I wouldn't say that I've

[40:28] completely embraces one entirely because I don't really talk about much controversial stuff. Besides

[40:33] poor people who stop doing poor people stuff, they start following what rich people do and do more

[40:36] rich people stuff. But besides that, not a lot of controversy and so maybe I need to do better there.

[40:41] But these are things that I think have helped build and propel her brand at a faster rate than

[40:46] other people. The next one is that she's adaptable, but she's been able to adapt as media platforms

[40:50] have changed. And so it was television ones. And then they went from television to Hulu, which is

[40:57] online TV. They went all in on Instagram really, really early and started making content

[41:02] their regular basis. And their content looks very different from the classic influencers.

[41:07] Their content feeds into their brand as super famous people. And they continue to reinforce

[41:12] that with the luxury brands they've all done deals with and the products they promote themselves.

[41:17] And the next one is that she is accessible. And this may be even her superpower. And this is

[41:22] partially because she's in the makeup industry. She leaned into just being who she was. And so she

[41:27] would do Instagram lives and stories where it was just her no makeup. Despite with the

[41:32] media may portray them as is making false and unrealistic expectations for girls,

[41:36] I think that what they actually make in their content is probably the exact opposite of that. They show

[41:39] the 16 hours that it took them to get ready for the Met Gala. And all of these things that they do

[41:44] were they have to paint the stuff onto them or they have to not be able to go to the bathroom

[41:48] for three hours because of the stuff that they're wearing. They show that stuff so that they become

[41:52] more accessible so that people who relate to that also want to buy their products. And so you might

[41:57] see all these things to be like how did you use this Alex? Well, one I started posting content

[42:00] in general because I saw how much she had made. And I was like I am missing this whole concept of

[42:05] brand and started leaning into it. Number two is that I would say that leverage literally is part of

[42:10] our logo and it's one of the things that I talk about all the time. It's something that I believe

[42:14] a lot is. Now, it's interesting. Weugness is that's why you hire great people. Every single time I

[42:17] built one of these channels out, I don't try and learn a new platform. I find so many already

[42:21] knows it and I pay them to teach me so that I can learn faster. I'm not good at embracing

[42:26] controversy. But in terms of adaptability and accessibility, we have continued to go into new

[42:31] platforms as fast as we can and as fast as they come out so that we can experiment and we're willing

[42:36] to have stuff that absolutely flops. And I think that's cool because we learn. And finally,

[42:40] the accessibility piece is even though in the beginning it was a webcam and it was just me in a

[42:45] closet making videos. I'd rather start with what I have than trying portray the life that I have

[42:52] because I went from being really rich in anonymous saying, you know what, maybe I'll make some videos

[42:56] to making lots of stuff and making it look really polished and highly produced. But it didn't

[43:01] happen overnight and I think that imagination has appreciated just watching the journey the whole

[43:07] way through. Just as they probably appreciate watching her journey, even though they know that she

[43:11] could put filters on or could only hop on Instagram live once she's done all over makeup, like

[43:15] I could probably flex more of my material belongings than I do because I just don't think that would

[43:21] so I don't. So I've learned that from them now, obviously she flexes a little bit of her

[43:25] material belongings. But you know, to me, it's a model, everyone's got different brands. I'm not

[43:29] going to come out with a lip kit anytime soon, so that's her brand not mine. So my brand has evolved

[43:35] over the ages. You can call this Mozi through time. And this is me as 23 years old, really

[43:41] in fitness and just starting my first gym. Here I'm much older as somebody who's the Master

[43:47] Gym Licenser. You know, I've five thousand post locations. I'm building gym launch, which is a

[43:50] company that's B to B servicing gym owners. And then over here, you've got Mozi today, who is the

[43:56] managing partner of a property firm called Acquisition.com that owns a bunch of companies. And so

[44:02] the question is, how does a brand as a personal brand evolved over time? In the beginning, look how I

[44:07] dressed. I've got my neon tank top and I've got my neon shorts. And the reason that I dressed this way

[44:14] is because one, this is how I actually dressed because I was into fitness. But also, I had a 70

[44:19] percent female audience. I needed to look approachable, not like a big scary dude. Me today,

[44:25] probably not something that Mozi women are going to be like, yes, I'm going to trust him

[44:30] in my wheat loss journey. They're like, I don't want to look like you and you have a beard. No,

[44:34] thank you. But this looks like a relatively approachable young man who's high energy and filled

[44:39] with the light of hope. All I was focused on was fitness, nutrition, and accountability. I was

[44:45] reanna on Tuesdays that I was cranking inside of the gym and I had women's only playlists.

[44:49] And I was catering to the audience that had it at that time. And me and reality was this person.

[44:54] All I was thinking about was fitness anyways and really just trying to get my career going as an

[44:58] entrepreneur. Now, fast forward here when I'm the master licensor. If I was this guy, the audience

[45:05] that I have here is 90 percent male. And not only 90 percent male, 90 percent jacked male jimmers.

[45:14] So look how my personal brand changed. Now, I want to be clear. It's not like every time I did this,

[45:20] it was the most deliberate thing. It was just that I also changed over time. Because what happened

[45:25] is here, all I was thinking about was fitness. I had just been competing, I had a few state records,

[45:30] I was falling pureization, I was counting my macros every day. It was what I was obsessed with at

[45:34] the time, which was why I started a business around fitness. But that second part, a business around

[45:38] fitness, started to become the most important part to me, which is why over time, I started carrying

[45:43] more and more about business and less and less about fitness. And so then, I became the gym lord,

[45:49] which was the name of our commute, which is gym lord's. And so I started wearing the stuff that

[45:54] wrapped my new company. And most of the people that followed my stuff then believe it or not,

[45:58] I was a lot prudent about making money back then than I am now. Because remember, this was the guy

[46:02] who wanted to be rich in anonymous. You will probably grow and change in your interests and the way

[46:07] you dress and the way you look also changed that way. Now, I think there's a bi-directional

[46:11] relationship I changed and so so did my audience, which also changed me back. The pants are falling

[46:19] up, I have to blur that out. So I'll call out two things that were very specific about this.

[46:23] Number one was that I called it originally gym rescue. And as soon as I got on the phone

[46:28] of people people were like, I don't be rescued, I don't need to be rescued and then there are

[46:32] egos of flowers. So I was like, oh no, what if we just launch your gym like we're doing a

[46:36] grand opening and they're like, okay, yeah, yeah, that's cool, even though they've been open for

[46:39] five years. But when I called it a launch, everyone was fine with it. So then I switched my language

[46:43] from gym rescue to gym launch because of my audience, not because of what I wanted. Kind of interesting.

[46:48] The second thing is you'll notice that I went from right-eye to Bushy-tailed kid here to

[46:54] made with a handlebar mustache. And so then the mustache became part of the brand and I did that

[46:59] for the entire time that I was the gym lord and running gym lunch. So then what happened is,

[47:03] as I started making more and more money, I started seeing people making even more money than

[47:08] they made. And it was all these private equity guys. And I was like, this guy bought a company

[47:11] for $50 million, it sold for $250 million, didn't have to start the company. And so as my interest

[47:16] started to evolve because I started investing more and I started buying real estate started buying

[47:20] businesses and I was like, huh, there's a game beyond the game. And I actually started moving away

[47:26] from being the gym lord because I didn't want to be the face of that company more. I just wanted to

[47:30] be the owner. And so this shift was me going from operator to owner. And as an owner,

[47:38] all I cared about was my return on investment and making sure that we were doing business in alignment

[47:44] with our values. And so I started dressing how I would dress without being public facing.

[47:50] Now the irony of this whole thing is that in dressing in a way that wasn't supposed to be public facing,

[47:56] I ended up becoming even more public facing than I ever thought. And so over time, the way that I

[48:00] dress, which is pretty much just the most utilitarian way I could imagine with these calves. And so

[48:05] this is Mosie today. And there may be a Mosie in the future who dresses differently because

[48:10] I changed my mind about stuff. But the thing is that over the years I went from loving fitness

[48:17] to loving operating businesses, to loving owning and scaling companies. And my progression as an

[48:23] individual has reflected in how I dressed and who I was talking to. But the point is that I think

[48:32] the only way to make a personal brand last is for it to be you. And I'll be really clear here.

[48:36] This is a visual prop set. And I'm using this because people need visuals to understand stuff.

[48:43] But I will say that I feel like this over emphasizes the importance of a quote outfit.

[48:47] It is not that important. If I start wearing black tank tops tomorrow and I start wearing sweats,

[48:52] no one's going to give a shit. Because my value is about the stuff that I provide that helps the

[48:58] audience do better. Hopefully you guys make more money, grow in the ways that you want to grow,

[49:03] achieve the goals you want. That's the value, not how I dress. It's just that because I dress this way.

[49:09] And I do it consistently because that's why I am. People have then associated that value with this

[49:14] outfit, which is why someone else can wear my logo and people will approach them and associate the

[49:19] value that I've given them with that person. And that's how you brand. That's how you build brand

[49:24] equity. And so I show this as a visual demonstration to give you the idea, but not to emphasize that

[49:31] you have to wear a certain thing in order to build your brand. But if what you wear as a representation

[49:36] of who you are, then it will probably have some degree to that because people at least at the

[49:40] onset will judge you by how you look. And just to give you some context on why a private equity

[49:47] investor would be even me making a YouTube video and be explaining this topic. So number one is that

[49:53] notice how all these people are all billionaires. Kind of interesting. Why are they billionaires?

[49:59] What's different now versus what it was before? Well now there's direct distribution. When Tom Hanks

[50:05] became famous he didn't have direct distribution. So he always had to do partnerships with

[50:10] movie companies who then did partnerships with movie theaters to distribute the concept. But now

[50:16] because platforms came in between the distribution and the end user creators could immediately post

[50:23] directly and interact with their entire audience. And so what that did is it cut out all these

[50:28] middlemen and allowed creators to take up a huge slice of the economics. And so me recognizing that

[50:35] in each of these people was part of the reason that I started even though I didn't need to start

[50:39] making concept because I saw the value in the audience. And just to give you some hard stats around

[50:45] this on why to decide it to basically give up anonymity, which I do like my privacy. One is that

[50:50] this is according to Goldman Sachs. The creator economy is projected to be at 500 billion

[50:55] half a trillion a year plus by 2027. This is not far away. This is 1 billion, 500 times in a row,

[51:04] every year. That's a lot of billions. And to give you an idea of the audience size, Instagram has 2.3

[51:11] billion and then YouTube has 2.6 billion users. And TikTok has 1.6 billion. These are all

[51:20] monthly active users. I mean this is the world. And then beyond that just to give you context in

[51:25] terms of just USA. YouTube alone creates $25 billion a year in GDP for the United States of America

[51:34] just from jobs that were created by creators, which right now is over 400,000 jobs. This is

[51:41] real economics that are happening in unfolding in front of ours. How business was traditionally

[51:46] done has been turned on its head. And when you see teenagers in 20 year olds becoming decommilators,

[51:52] sense of millionaires, and billionaires pay attention because the troll comments in this

[51:57] rotor like if you have so much money, why are you making these videos? Domainus, if I have so much

[52:03] money, why the fuck you think I'm making the videos? Because there's value in doing it beyond all of the

[52:08] obvious ones, which is you build an audience. You can stuff something to them. The larger one that's

[52:12] unspoken is the access to other people. Now if I want to reach out to a public CEO to say hey,

[52:18] can I hop on the phone or hate you want to do a podcast? The answer is yes, because I have an audience.

[52:24] And so whatever their message is, it doesn't matter how rich you are, if you don't have someone

[52:30] listening, you can't distribute your message. So you might be sitting at home or at the gas station

[52:36] or between things or you're on the can right now. Thanks for joining me. And wondering okay,

[52:40] I just saw some of the biggest influencers at all time and how they built their brands. What I'm

[52:44] I'm going to do now. So what we're going to use the process RIP Charlie Munger,

[52:48] called inverted thinking. So rather than say hey, here's the six steps to creating your personal

[52:53] brand, I want to talk about the things that would destroy your personal brand or guarantee that you

[52:56] never build one to begin with. So let's start off the top. If I were to only do this one thing,

[53:01] what would I do to guarantee that I can't build a brand? Well number one is I would talk about

[53:05] something that I know nothing about. So if you talk about stuff that you don't know anything about

[53:09] and are not interested in, I can guarantee we'll not build a very good brand around that topic.

[53:13] Next, I would be inconsistent and ideally not even start for fear of judgment. So let's call that

[53:21] quitting slash start stop. You can't stick with it because even if your stuff was really really good,

[53:27] if you quit for a long time or you start and you stop and you start and you stop, I can

[53:31] gear to, you're not going to build a big brand. Next thing I would do is I would try and

[53:35] do two things around selling. One is I would sell early. So that means that I haven't provided

[53:41] any value to my audience and I immediately start trying to sell them stuff. I have very little

[53:45] goodwill. I don't have a lot of people but because I'm desperate for money, I start trying to sell

[53:49] stuff and I sell it really hard. Well, that'll probably destroy the brand because people already

[53:54] have very little affinity towards you and now they have zero. So that would be one of the things

[53:58] I would definitely do to make sure that we destroy your brand. The other thing is I would sell

[54:01] wrong. And what I mean by that is that I'd sell the wrong stuff and so if I'm making stuff about

[54:08] gardening then I say, hey, you should take this credit card that has all these great reward points.

[54:12] It doesn't really match. Now if I was a financial or investing influencer, that might make sense.

[54:17] But if I'm a gardening influencer just because they're the only person to reach down and said,

[54:20] hey, we'll give you 500 bucks to do this sponsorship. Some money is not worth taking. But if we

[54:25] were to do that, we would definitely decrease our audience and decrease the likelihood that they

[54:29] want to tune into our stuff in the future. So the next thing I do is I was associated with the wrong

[54:32] crowd, the wrong people, people that their core values and the things that they're interested in

[54:37] directly conflict. I'll give you a couple examples for me. One is like a snake oil salesman. So

[54:43] if somebody has a really crappy product or they make these false promises or false claims,

[54:47] then me making association with them would hurt my brand. And so the idea is if we wanted to

[54:52] make sure we'd hurt your brand, we'd make sure to associate with the wrong people. Next is I

[54:55] would need perfect conditions. Don't start today, start when you have perfect conditions because

[54:59] the thing is that there are no perfect conditions. And so you're like, well, I will only succeed if

[55:04] I have a really big set and lots of people helping me and a script and a teleprompter and all these

[55:10] special effects. If you need that to win, you're not going to win because what I can tell you about

[55:14] every person we talked about earlier, all of them started with what they have. And so if you really

[55:17] think you're going to go all the way, then be willing to work with what you have. And the last one

[55:21] is I would never ever change because even if things did start working, if we guaranteed

[55:28] that we didn't change, then we can guarantee that eventually the conditions will change and we will fail.

[55:33] Because you're like, but this thing started working. I have to keep doing that. And then you

[55:37] slowly see it stop working less and less and less and less and you don't change with it. And the

[55:42] same degree, you change. If your brand never changes at all, you have changed. And it means that

[55:48] there's actually greater and greater distance between who you are, and who you represent yourself to be.

[55:52] And that long term will sink you. And so if everything I just covered, if you do these things,

[55:57] you can guarantee that your brand will not win and will not succeed in the long term. And so

[56:01] if we're being enterprising about this, what if we flip it? Because that might just be the

[56:06] recipe to succeed in the long term. Which means we talk about the stuff that we know and that we're

[56:11] interested in. We stay consistent with it and we just start and we keep going. You wait

[56:18] way too long to sell it all. If you are going to sell it to begin with, because you want to make

[56:22] sure that you always provide so much more value than you ever ask from your audience. And then if you do

[56:27] choose to sell something, you sell something that actually requires you to change nothing about who you are.

[56:31] If I already loved this type of tank top and people know that I've been wearing it for a few

[56:35] years, then it would make sense for me to say, by the way, this is the brand I use. No one's

[56:39] going to be upset by that because it makes sense based on everything they've seen up to this point.

[56:43] And I would associate with people who are like me who have audiences like mine who care about

[56:47] the things like I do so that those audiences combine and compound onto each other rather than

[56:53] deluding all of the associations I spent so much time curating and putting together to say,

[56:56] this is what I stand for. And we would wait for it in perfect conditions, which often means

[57:02] today because there are no perfect conditions. And finally, being willing to embrace change,

[57:07] because change is the only constant that will happen in branding at all is that the platforms

[57:11] are changed, the media will change, the packaging will change, and you your suffer will change

[57:14] over this whole time. And you have to be willing to do that or eventually you will die.

[57:18] And so these are the steps if reverse that can create a brand in my opinion,

[57:22] might be able to follow to get rich in today's influencer evolution.

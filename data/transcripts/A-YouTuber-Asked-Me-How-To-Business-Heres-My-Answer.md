[00:00] This is unspeakable.

[00:01] You've been doing YouTube for 10 years

[00:03] and it's 200 million people

[00:04] who watches videos every single month.

[00:08] We're gonna break down his business

[00:09] and how he's gonna go to a billion plus, let's dive in.

[00:12] I've so many puns that I wanna say

[00:13] like speechless and speak about it.

[00:15] I won't be able to do anything about this,

[00:16] but I want to.

[00:17] And this was an idea that Eric,

[00:19] because yeah, we're talking to him

[00:20] like dude, you should do this

[00:21] kind of like a mini series for your channel.

[00:24] Talk with people with big audiences,

[00:25] how would you think through

[00:27] what opportunity to go after it?

[00:28] It's like so many people are just like loss.

[00:31] Like what do I say?

[00:33] Yeah, what do I sell?

[00:33] There's so many options.

[00:35] Like I could sell energy drink,

[00:36] I could sell germax,

[00:38] I could sell these conference tables.

[00:39] Like it's literally in this.

[00:41] Yeah, you could launch on Brailleaus

[00:42] or you could launch clean-up boxes

[00:44] that are unspeakable.

[00:45] Unblobable.

[00:48] One down.

[00:49] And make money.

[00:50] And so the problem is that a lot of

[00:51] I feel like YouTubers and influence

[00:52] receive one influencer do something,

[00:54] make some money and then think,

[00:55] oh, I'll do the same thing.

[00:57] And then end up with a massively undermoticized opportunity.

[01:01] Okay, if we've got the market here,

[01:04] we've got the brand here

[01:05] and then we've got different monetization vehicles.

[01:07] Like what is the thing that kind of

[01:10] overlaps all three that works really well?

[01:12] So there's like three kind of vehicles.

[01:13] So you have unspeakable,

[01:14] the main thing, the biggest thing,

[01:16] it's like driving all the revenue.

[01:17] Yeah.

[01:18] And then you have zero to 60,

[01:19] which is a new business.

[01:20] That's actually why I'm here in Vegas for SEMA.

[01:22] It's an automotive shop paired with content.

[01:24] And then the third idea revolved around a consumer product.

[01:28] I won't say what we want to call it yet

[01:30] because the names are still kind of in the air.

[01:32] Sounds big, but it's not unspeakable,

[01:35] but basically what we really want to build a company

[01:38] similar to what Rebel has.

[01:39] Because I know so much about content

[01:41] and I know so much about all these platforms.

[01:44] I could build a marketing company,

[01:45] sell a consumer bull, whatever fits that,

[01:47] like target audience that I'm trying to target.

[01:49] But in that's all primarily driven off

[01:51] the unspeakable channel.

[01:52] Right.

[01:54] I don't know.

[01:54] I probably want to do a separate channel for it

[01:57] just because unspeakable's kind of got its own thing.

[01:59] Like it's four kids, you know?

[02:01] What's the age?

[02:02] I would say a large majority are like 12 to 16.

[02:06] So right now I sell merch from speakable.

[02:08] But my idea was to kind of launch a toy brand

[02:12] and just see where we can go with that.

[02:15] We talked about the energy trick idea, right?

[02:18] Yeah, so that's how I love.

[02:19] But that would be that third idea.

[02:20] I don't know.

[02:21] I don't feel like it would fit in speakable audience.

[02:23] Maybe it would, maybe it would.

[02:24] Yeah, but they're just bunch of kids.

[02:27] And I just don't, you know, like I wouldn't call it

[02:31] and speakable.

[02:31] Yeah, I was just launch a drink.

[02:33] No, first shit, well it doesn't have to be.

[02:35] It doesn't mean, but yeah.

[02:36] But the other thing that worries me is like,

[02:38] so I'm unspeakable, right?

[02:41] The brand revolves around me.

[02:43] The question is how long can I be unspeakable?

[02:47] Like, you know, right now I'm almost 25 years old.

[02:50] When I'm 30 years old.

[02:52] When I'm 35, am I still going to be wanting to do that?

[02:57] Probably not.

[03:00] Like I've tied myself to unspeakable for the past 10 years.

[03:02] So I can't really get rid of it.

[03:04] I can't like hire some other people to come in and just kind of like

[03:07] change who I am.

[03:08] You know, that's like if the rock was like,

[03:10] oh, I don't want to be the rock anymore.

[03:11] So I'm a higher this guy.

[03:12] Like it just doesn't work, you know?

[03:13] Like I love the energy drink for like the crazy,

[03:15] all the stuff that you're, you know, feeling your house with sand.

[03:18] Today I'm going to be feeling my entire island house with sand.

[03:20] Maybe I'm wrong, right?

[03:21] Yeah, it could fit the unspeakable audience,

[03:23] but I wanted to like expand.

[03:24] I wanted to go to like, you know, like skateboarders and snowboarders

[03:28] and like, I don't want just like kids that love ball pit balls

[03:32] of Nerf guns to drink my energy drink, you know what I mean?

[03:35] Yeah.

[03:36] I see the original distribution base is just like the launch pad.

[03:38] And the only thing that keeps it going is new distribution.

[03:41] And the product itself being good enough that people

[03:43] who are in the first ring tell their friends.

[03:45] And like that's the part that most people fuck up.

[03:48] They're like, I'll just stop my name on this thing.

[03:50] It's white label.

[03:51] I completely agree.

[03:52] I just know that I'm not going to want to film videos

[03:56] for the next 30 years in my life.

[03:58] Like I, there's already plenty of days where I dread videos.

[04:01] I still love them like so.

[04:03] There's so much fun, but I know like, I know when I'm 36 years old,

[04:07] I'm not going to be like, oh yeah, I'm so ready to, you know,

[04:09] fill my house with balls and let's put on.

[04:12] Let's put all the sand in.

[04:13] I don't know if I can see me doing it for that long,

[04:16] but when you start doing the car stuff,

[04:18] isn't that still going to be video too?

[04:20] Yeah, but we're actually looking for like co-hosts.

[04:22] So I just want to be the creative brands of the channel,

[04:25] just kind of like help direction.

[04:26] Can we segue real quick into the car shop thing?

[04:28] Yeah.

[04:29] Is the primary motivator for the car shop,

[04:31] making money, eventually franchise, is it to have like lots of locations?

[04:34] Or is it just for content to have a spot to make it?

[04:38] Yeah.

[04:38] So there's like three branches to the business.

[04:40] Like you have the shop, you have the content side.

[04:42] And then you'd have the marketplace side,

[04:44] which doesn't exist right now, but work on building it.

[04:46] Like, cards?

[04:47] Yeah.

[04:48] So like parts to custom mods and things

[04:50] like that.

[04:50] Yeah.

[04:51] That I see being the biggest part of the business.

[04:52] I have a lot of people that follow me

[04:54] that are actually interested in cars.

[04:55] Because when I first started my unspeakable channel

[04:57] like six years ago, older than all I did was car content.

[05:02] Oh.

[05:03] So I started doing car vlogs.

[05:04] I had like a GTR.

[05:05] I went to like car me.

[05:07] Okay.

[05:07] Like when on rallies.

[05:08] Because at the time, I just did daily vlogs.

[05:11] I was just like, yeah, guys, this is my life.

[05:13] That was what the unspeakable channel was.

[05:14] Like six or seven years ago.

[05:16] And then you started seeing what was hitting

[05:18] the crazier shit you did.

[05:19] Yeah, it was kind of more.

[05:20] Yeah, because YouTube like six years ago was like vlogs.

[05:23] Like Casey and I sat was like the biggest YouTuber.

[05:26] And he literally walked around New York City

[05:27] making really good entertaining videos.

[05:29] But it was just a day of his life.

[05:31] Yeah.

[05:31] That's what YouTube was.

[05:32] You had a bunch of other creators like Mr. Beast

[05:34] and other guys come in and they're like,

[05:36] okay, this is the new YouTube.

[05:37] This is challenges.

[05:39] Yeah.

[05:39] Where people are like, all right,

[05:40] survive on this.

[05:41] Survive on this.

[05:42] So I was like, I need to like change that.

[05:44] So that's where everything else came in.

[05:47] So if we're optimizing around,

[05:49] how do we make you the most money?

[05:51] Short and long term, right?

[05:53] And really more so long term.

[05:54] It's clear that you love this one.

[05:56] Like I mean, just from like your energy

[05:57] when we're talking about it.

[05:58] And this is just like your cash count.

[06:01] For a world as this didn't start,

[06:02] just for a business perspective.

[06:04] Yeah.

[06:04] Is that you only had unspeakable?

[06:06] You're making a good amount of money

[06:07] from unspeakable and at since every month.

[06:09] Of all the things I'm going to do,

[06:10] I'm going to leverage the existing massive media audience

[06:12] that I have and find one thing that they can all buy.

[06:15] And then that would be all that you would do.

[06:16] Then we have a phase out plan for you getting out of.

[06:20] So it's like, okay, next six months or next 12 months,

[06:22] you're co-hosting.

[06:23] One to three people who are with you in the shows

[06:26] as regular and then you just do one of these.

[06:28] And then they're leading it most of it.

[06:29] And you're making a couple of appearances

[06:30] and then you fall off the table.

[06:33] Yeah.

[06:34] Yeah, and speak well could transition to something like

[06:38] Red Bull.

[06:39] When you think of Red Bull,

[06:40] you don't think of one person.

[06:41] Like you just think of like crazy, anything crazy.

[06:44] Yeah.

[06:45] I still think that an energy drink is not bad.

[06:48] I feel like the energy drinks market is all saturated.

[06:51] Oh, it'll.

[06:51] If you put the same amount of attention

[06:53] to making the product the way you do videos

[06:55] where it's like, how does it taste in the beginning?

[06:57] How does the after taste?

[06:58] Like if you were to break it down at that micro level

[07:00] of really making an exceptional product,

[07:02] you're excellent at what you do.

[07:04] So like that character trait will carry over.

[07:06] You know what I mean, if you apply it to this.

[07:08] So if we're analyzing opportunity,

[07:09] it's number of units sold times gross profit

[07:11] potential per unit divided by competitive mode.

[07:14] Number of people times amount of money made.

[07:16] So like for me, we do deals with a very tiny percentage

[07:19] of people, but the amount of money that I make on a deal

[07:21] is significantly higher.

[07:22] And so for me that cross section,

[07:23] even though it's 80, 80 bitty,

[07:25] still makes it worth it for me, right?

[07:27] Because for that small person helping them go from

[07:29] to 100 million is very meaningful.

[07:32] And so I could help a tiny amount of people a lot

[07:34] and then help everyone else for free.

[07:36] And so we just have to figure out what that slice is.

[07:40] What do you like?

[07:40] So you've got the car thing.

[07:41] You dig that.

[07:42] What else you dig?

[07:43] What are your people know about you?

[07:46] I mean, just having fun with friends

[07:48] and just making videos.

[07:49] It's just kind of the whole vibe of like.

[07:51] Yeah.

[07:52] So you get money from add sense and whatnot.

[07:54] But do you have any other brand sponsorship deals

[07:56] like integrations and videos?

[07:57] Oh yeah.

[07:58] OK, so what are those advertisers?

[08:00] I've never like those.

[08:02] Elmer's glue.

[08:03] We've done some with WWE.

[08:05] OK.

[08:06] Five hour energy, pop pockets, honey,

[08:09] like the website.

[08:11] Yeah.

[08:11] Yeah.

[08:11] Yeah.

[08:12] A bunch of like small mobile game companies.

[08:15] Do they reach out to you?

[08:15] Do you reach out to them?

[08:16] They all reach out to us.

[08:17] Really?

[08:18] Of opportunity vehicles.

[08:20] The game would be by far number one.

[08:23] It would hit the most amount of the audience.

[08:25] You'd make the highest gross profit per user.

[08:27] It's operationally from a fulfillment standpoint.

[08:30] The easiest to handle.

[08:32] The big hard part is like building a software game

[08:35] that's actually really good.

[08:36] I've seen so many YouTubers make games

[08:39] and doesn't matter the following that they have like,

[08:41] if the game sucks, the game sucks, the game sucks.

[08:44] Like, I like the energy drink and cool.

[08:46] That only issue with these though

[08:47] is that they're cash, eaters, which sucks.

[08:52] What I'm going to say, you may or may not like

[08:54] so just take it for what it is.

[08:56] How can you do more of what we're currently doing?

[08:58] Because like, of the plays, like I like that a lot.

[09:02] Highlight, lead of success, right within your real house.

[09:05] Like, there's only a couple of tweaks.

[09:07] It's like, OK, find the other co-hosts.

[09:09] Like, if you're like, well, that's kind of hard.

[09:10] It's like, well, so is building a fucking software company.

[09:12] Like, it's all hard.

[09:13] Right.

[09:14] It's all hard.

[09:15] Like, this one, you know, like all the other variables

[09:16] you've got down.

[09:17] I feel like doubling down on the media might be the play.

[09:21] You could probably like tomorrow,

[09:23] five back so much money you make.

[09:24] Just by building out the sponsorship arm.

[09:27] That's all that you have to do.

[09:29] I kind of limit my scale on the speakable

[09:32] because I have to be in all the videos, right?

[09:33] I have to figure out who my co-hosts are

[09:35] and start sprinkling them in and seeing how the audience

[09:37] reacts to them, finding one or two people that are three people

[09:40] that they really like and then rotating them in.

[09:42] And to the point where ideally,

[09:44] that's people will be a group two or three people

[09:46] that are kind of like hosting and leading things

[09:47] along playing off each other.

[09:48] Characters, right?

[09:49] Yeah, so like scaling content that way.

[09:51] Because I think the growth for the channel

[09:53] could be so much faster.

[09:54] We put out 52 videos a year, right?

[09:57] We could put out 100 or 150 that are all the same quality

[10:02] of those 52.

[10:03] But it's just limits all my time because I have to sleep

[10:06] eventually.

[10:07] But when someone pays you a million bucks or whatever

[10:10] to do a year of sponsorship,

[10:11] it's like that goes straight to your bottom line.

[10:14] That is not common.

[10:16] Like which is why media businesses are wonderful.

[10:17] But like Warren Buffett had all of these newspapers

[10:19] because it's media.

[10:20] It's one of those profitable businesses in the planet.

[10:22] And you're good at it.

[10:23] Which is hard.

[10:24] What's the saying where it's like,

[10:25] I don't know who said this, but it was like,

[10:27] if you're good at sales, you can make a million five million

[10:29] 10 million, but if you're good at marketing,

[10:32] they have to make billions, right?

[10:34] Well, there's an Instagram from the Ball Royal Academy,

[10:35] which is you only sell because you don't know how to market

[10:38] and you only market because you don't know how to build a product.

[10:40] And what's cool about your product

[10:42] is that it is both marketing and product.

[10:44] It's one of the unique things about the media business.

[10:46] Is that how you market the thing that you have

[10:48] is also how you fill that thing.

[10:50] That's only a media thing.

[10:52] Like no other businesses like that

[10:53] where the marketing is the fulfillment.

[10:55] If we were to plan this out and say,

[10:57] hey, if you could forex your income in the next four years,

[11:00] would you do it just from the unspeakable income?

[11:02] Well, if the answer is yes, then it's like,

[11:03] well, then we could reverse into near that.

[11:05] That's super doable.

[11:06] I would bet that in that four-year span.

[11:08] There is an opportunity like somebody who approaches you

[11:11] who's got another energy drink brand

[11:12] is like we already have funding, et cetera.

[11:14] And we just want to face for it

[11:15] or we want to brand do associate with.

[11:17] And then you can do a brand deal with that company,

[11:19] but you do it for equity.

[11:20] I'll let this test number one, it's like,

[11:21] you love the product.

[11:22] The road path for unspeakable now feels pretty clear to me.

[11:25] How do you feel about that?

[11:27] Now I like it.

[11:28] And then you also have this car thing.

[11:29] Yeah.

[11:30] Even here, building the car parts thing,

[11:33] like that'll definitely make.

[11:34] And I like that as a business model.

[11:36] And if unspeakable didn't exist out, say, yeah, just do that.

[11:38] You thought about it before you built it.

[11:40] You were like, I'm going to build the content arm,

[11:42] I'm going to monetize over here,

[11:43] ensure we'll make some money at the shop, whatever.

[11:45] That's a complete business model in my mind.

[11:47] And it makes sense because it's fully integrated in the videos.

[11:50] It's like, hey, we just put this custom mod thing on the Lambo.

[11:53] By the way, you guys can check it out.

[11:54] I've got 20 available.

[11:55] First one, you can go get it.

[11:56] On the shop side, I already have a partner.

[11:59] So it's kind of running operate the whole shop.

[12:00] The shop, okay.

[12:01] Yeah.

[12:02] The shop is what is going to open first.

[12:03] The content, it's kind of like whenever we get a piece of content.

[12:07] Whenever we get access to the numerous ades that came out, you know,

[12:10] my main role is just to kind of oversee like direction and making

[12:14] sure the creative is, you know, on point.

[12:16] The marketplace doesn't even exist yet.

[12:18] If you were to do the marketplace, it would take the same amount of energy

[12:21] and attention and effort as scaling unspeakable,

[12:23] likely to achieve it lower than unspeakable.

[12:26] Yeah.

[12:26] Upside about the same.

[12:27] You already have a partner who's running the ops.

[12:29] That's good.

[12:30] I think all you need is just have somebody who's junior.

[12:33] Running the content, who wants to like mentor under you, which you have.

[12:36] I'm sure it can find somebody who would just like live with you and breathe the stuff.

[12:39] This is the main thing.

[12:40] This is the baby.

[12:41] This is what you're the best at.

[12:42] Are there any of the best in the world now?

[12:44] Do more of that.

[12:45] And then the only thing that you're going to attribute over here,

[12:47] you're dropping the marketplace.

[12:49] You have the partner to run the day-to-day ops,

[12:51] is just somebody to run the content for the car shop.

[12:53] And then you can sell sponsorships and whatnot that will go through there,

[12:55] which is actually kind of nice because then this one starts to merge

[12:58] with the path of this one.

[13:00] So then your attention will start to consolidate in terms of like,

[13:02] how you make money and how you think through things.

[13:04] But now it feels really simple.

[13:05] Yeah.

[13:06] So better?

[13:07] Easy enough.

[13:08] Yeah.

[13:09] Well, both all of these are hard.

[13:10] This one has so few unknowns based on what you already have in the experience.

[13:14] Congrats.

[13:15] So everything.

[13:16] Thank you so much.

[13:17] Yeah, you bet.

[00:00] What I want to choose to you is just one of the many vehicles that exist to incentivize employees

[00:04] and it's called Phantom Equity.

[00:07] So I was having conversation with a newer business owner and he was talking about how he

[00:11] had this person who was good at marketing and he wanted to give them a percentage of his business

[00:14] but not the whole business in order to do his marketing.

[00:18] And after talking about it a little bit more, it became clear that it really should just

[00:21] have a performance relationship and not give up equity.

[00:24] But one of the key things is that there are positions that are more difficult to measure

[00:28] within a business that it does make sense over time to give some sort of equity to an

[00:33] employee because I have realized over time is that in order to grow my slice of the pie,

[00:38] it's better to get a bigger pie and have more people get wealthy.

[00:42] And so having other people use my businesses of vehicle for their wealth as ultimately

[00:46] allowed me to gain leverage on how I can increase my own wealth.

[00:50] And one of my rules of life is the more money they make other people, the more money

[00:53] I make.

[00:54] And that is not just limited to your customers, it's also a place to your employees.

[00:57] And that's been something that it took me much longer than I expected.

[01:01] Much longer than I had hoped to learn.

[01:02] So hopefully I can transfer that lesson to you faster.

[01:05] Sam Walton even talked about this in his book, made it America how he said one of the biggest

[01:09] things that influence Wal-Mart's growth is when they created their employee stock option

[01:12] program.

[01:13] And by doing that, he said there was such a tremendous amount of buy-in that the company

[01:17] just continued to grow and grow and he said he wished he had done it sooner.

[01:20] So taking the advice from that man and somebody who has made much less money than Sam Walton

[01:24] myself, what I want to choose to you is just one of the many vehicles that exist to incentivize

[01:28] employees.

[01:29] And it's called Phantom Equity.

[01:31] This is something that I have used in every company that I own, believe it or not, I've

[01:35] used Phantom Equity to incentivize high-level employees in just about every company.

[01:40] And it happened because I actually had someone use it with me as an affiliate.

[01:44] So I was an affiliate of a big software company and the CEO flew out and was like, hey,

[01:48] how can I make this really worth it for you to push this?

[01:51] And I was like, listen man, I enjoy the affiliate commissions, but for me to really make

[01:55] this focus, I would need some sort of equity on the upside.

[01:58] He said, well, what if I instead of giving you equity, I can give you Phantom Equity?

[02:02] And I was like, what's that?

[02:04] And so he explained it and I want to explain to the extent that I understand it as an entrepreneur,

[02:08] explain it to you as we've used it.

[02:10] So I'm going to break this down to the employee in the owner.

[02:13] Now, in this case, the example I just said, I wasn't an employee, but I still have treatment.

[02:18] I'll use the employees the example here.

[02:21] All right.

[02:21] So there's a couple different variables that you can think about Phantom Equity.

[02:24] So Phantom Equity is simply put equity that is not vested, but has events that can trigger its

[02:29] vesting.

[02:30] Vesting means whether it's happened or not.

[02:33] Like does that equity exist?

[02:35] Is it yours or not?

[02:37] Has it vested?

[02:38] All right.

[02:38] So the first thing is,

[02:40] Phantom Equity is typically triggered upon a sale or change in liquidity.

[02:44] Now, there is variables.

[02:45] All of this stuff is negotiable.

[02:46] All of these things have variables.

[02:48] So I could say, for example, the Phantom Equity vests, or you are able to participate

[02:53] in a transaction of the company, if ownership changes, if majority ownership changes.

[02:58] So that would be a clause that I could say, if I sell majority of the company, then you

[03:01] can liquidate your shelves along with me.

[03:04] Now, the reason that you might not include something like that is because a buyer might not

[03:07] want the key employees to leave with the liquidation event.

[03:10] So that's something that would protect the owner.

[03:12] Now, if you wanted to say, hey, I want to do it so that you guys can participate, then you

[03:17] could also put like you can sell up to this amount or you can sell proportional amounts.

[03:20] So there's lots of different caveats here, but big picture.

[03:22] Most people have the Phantom Equity so that if there's a transaction of some sort, the employees

[03:26] can also participate in it and build their own wealth alongside the objective of Phantom

[03:31] Equity to get owner-like thinking and owner-like engagement-owner-like behavior among people

[03:36] who are not majority owners of the business.

[03:38] In a lot of times, this makes it time to sense.

[03:39] Like, I used to be so stingy with equity early on.

[03:42] Well, in the very beginning, I was really, really loose with equity and then I kind of

[03:45] like swung back the other direction and didn't want to give anyone equity.

[03:48] And I feel like now I've kind of fallen in the middle path of, I don't need to give huge chunks

[03:52] away to people.

[03:53] I need to find people who are key players and give them Phantom Equity that is proportional

[03:58] to the effort and the contributions that they have.

[03:59] Right?

[04:00] I used to give away disproportionate chunks and I ended up paying for it and then later I ended

[04:04] up trying to find ways to incentivize and attract high level employees and the best people

[04:08] want a stake because winners win and they know they're going to win so they want to have

[04:12] be able to participate in the upside.

[04:14] So, number one, that is where sale is triggered.

[04:17] The second is that it's beneficial from a wealth standpoint because the employee can increase

[04:21] the value of their wealth, their stake, the Phantom Equity by increasing the value of business.

[04:25] And the beauty of that is that it's entirely tax-straight.

[04:27] Now, the owner and employer completely aligned on this one together.

[04:30] Now, from a tax standpoint, the reason you've fed a equity instead of normal equity is that

[04:33] if you give normal equity, the employee also gets the downside of equity.

[04:36] All right?

[04:37] So, this is good for the employee, right?

[04:39] It's good because the employee doesn't have to buy the equity because normally, if you

[04:42] actually have an equity transfer, a true transfer, then what happens, they actually have to

[04:45] pay tax on it because they're getting something.

[04:47] That can't just, Zuckerberg can't just give all of his shares to Facebook to somebody, they

[04:51] have to pay taxes on it, right?

[04:53] And so, that is a taxable event when you transfer equity.

[04:55] So, you make it fair to equity because it doesn't technically vest unless a trigger occurs.

[05:00] And so, what that does is means that they don't have to get taxed on it, right?

[05:03] Which is beneficial for the employee, right?

[05:05] Now, the downside of this though is that typically it will get triggered as regular income,

[05:12] right?

[05:13] There's ways of writing this.

[05:14] I'm not going to get into the complexities around this, but this is kind of around the

[05:16] vesting schedule, which is when are they going to get this?

[05:18] So, for example, you could say, I want to give you 5% of this company and I want to give

[05:21] it to you over 5 years, which means you get 1% a year for the next 5 years.

[05:24] And you could say, hey, I want to create a cliff, which means that after the first year,

[05:29] the entire first percent vest than after that, every quarter, another 0.25% vest

[05:33] after that.

[05:34] So, that means that at, you know, month 9, there's still zero vestig.

[05:37] And then at month 13, there will have 1% that will have vested in its entirety.

[05:42] And then after that, it's piecemeal, right?

[05:45] What happens if the employee leaves?

[05:47] Now, one of the benefits to this and this protects the owner is, what if you say, you know,

[05:50] someone comes in, they're hot shot, they're smooth talking and they're like, yeah, man,

[05:54] I want to fan a mechody, whatever.

[05:56] And you're like, sure, I'm going to give you 5% of the next 5 years, right?

[05:59] And let's say they leave within, you know, expirit a time.

[06:03] Now, a upon determination of the employee, you can have them not get those.

[06:08] And you can also write that into the original agreement, which means that if you leave,

[06:11] you lose your fan of equity, right?

[06:13] Which also gets people to stick with it over the long return, which is why companies

[06:17] employ this structure.

[06:18] It's to incentivize people to stay and continue to grow the business, right?

[06:22] This protects the owner, the tax thing, it protects the employee.

[06:26] The other piece that protects the employees at with fan of equity, they're not liable, right?

[06:30] So if something happens to the business, the employees, in person, liable, which is why

[06:33] this is a nice attractive thing for many people.

[06:36] Now, this one is something that's interesting on what's talk about, which is profit, right?

[06:40] Because a lot of times people can flate equity with profit.

[06:42] You can be an equity owner and not participate in profit distributions.

[06:45] You can also participate in profit distributions and not be an equity owner.

[06:49] So these things are not connected.

[06:51] Oftentimes we think of them together because we as owners have both, but it doesn't mean

[06:55] that our employees need that necessarily.

[06:57] And I'm not saying you shouldn't do that.

[06:58] I'm just saying it is yet another variable that is considered in the negotiation.

[07:02] And so, one of the things through fan of equity, most times is going to depend on the value

[07:07] of the business.

[07:08] But what I learned from the mentors that I have spoken with, typically when you're having

[07:13] a leadership type position, who's a senior leadership.

[07:16] So somebody who's like on the executive track, they might get between half a percent to 2%

[07:20] depending again on the value of the business, their seniority, their experience, et cetera.

[07:25] And if you have a true executive that's a huge value ad that is leading almost half the company,

[07:31] et cetera, then that is where sometimes 3% 4% 5% can come into play.

[07:37] And so this is fan of equity.

[07:40] There are lots of different types of, you know, you can do bonus programs.

[07:42] You can do e-subs, which is a story in police.

[07:44] A lot of different programs.

[07:45] There's lots of different things you can do in a business.

[07:47] But this is one that I have used and has been very, very helpful for me.

[07:51] I've had people leave who had equity and we've been able to be on good terms, everything

[07:57] has been fine.

[07:58] They were projects from a tax standpoint.

[08:01] I tend to keep profit sharing, not to say that it's a bad or a good thing.

[08:04] It's just my preference.

[08:05] I love the fact that my employees can grow there well alongside me because they hear the

[08:09] same videos that you guys watch.

[08:11] And then finally, it's nice because they think in terms of a sale, so they're thinking

[08:15] in terms of enterprise value.

[08:16] So the moral line that can make my team and their life outcomes with my personal life

[08:21] outcomes, then the moral line will be, and ultimately the faster we'll move in that direction

[08:25] because we're not pushing, focus and effort and opposite directions.

[08:28] We're all 100% aligned.

[08:30] And so Phantom Equity is one of the best vehicles for that.

[08:33] I hope you found a value in this video and click subscribe.

[08:35] And if you're thinking about doing something like this, I'd recommend it.

[08:38] I think that it's better to increase the size of the pie.

[08:42] Give a handful of slices out to people who've helped you along the way.

[08:45] And I think that for me, as I've shifted, I really just want everyone to be wealthy.

[08:50] Heck, there's a lot of people who are broke and the reason I made this channel is so

[08:52] that you're not one of them.

[08:53] One of the best things that I can think of is helping the people who've about me build

[08:56] this.

[08:57] Building my employees wealth is something that is my is something top of mine for me

[09:01] and trying to find new ways and creative ways to build wealth about necessarily sacrificing

[09:06] we've built and risked to get here.

[09:07] So, hope you found the value.

[09:08] Well, click subscribe and I'll see you guys next week.

[09:10] Bye.

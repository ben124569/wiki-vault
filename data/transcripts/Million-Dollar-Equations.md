[00:00] These are seven investing concepts that will make you money,

[00:02] starting with number one.

[00:04] Lifetime, gross profit,

[00:06] compared to cost-to-a-power customer,

[00:08] which basically means how much money you make

[00:10] and profit from every person who comes to new business,

[00:12] compared to how much it costs to get them to buy to begin with.

[00:15] This is the fundamental economic unit of the business.

[00:19] You buy attention, you buy eyeballs to get customers,

[00:22] and then you sell those eyeballs,

[00:24] something that you're gonna make a profit from.

[00:25] All the profit that gets generated

[00:27] from the business comes from this one ratio.

[00:29] And so if someone has, for example,

[00:31] a one-to-one ratio of LTGB to CAC,

[00:34] they spend a dollar in the make-a-dollar back,

[00:36] and so that's it.

[00:36] Let's say a 20-to-one,

[00:38] it means for every dollar they put in,

[00:39] they get 20 back as profit.

[00:41] This becomes a business that you can scale endlessly,

[00:44] and become an incredibly attractive business.

[00:46] Getting really clear on what your LGP to CAC ratio is,

[00:50] is core to growing anything.

[00:51] So let's define these terms.

[00:53] Lifetime gross profit has a couple of components.

[00:55] There's lifetime, and then there's the gross profit component.

[00:58] So Lifetime is like, okay, well, how many times

[01:00] is someone going to payment?

[01:01] Within a product's business, how many times

[01:03] is someone buy on average over the lifespan?

[01:05] Shopify stores, things like that,

[01:07] well, actually just give you this metric,

[01:09] which is like the average customer buys 4.3 times.

[01:12] If you have a services business or a membership based business,

[01:15] then it might be the average lifespan.

[01:17] So how many months are they gonna stick with you?

[01:19] Now, if you don't know this,

[01:20] because you might be a small business that doesn't have a serum

[01:22] that reports on this kind of stuff,

[01:23] I'll give you the back of the napkin way

[01:25] to actually calculate this.

[01:26] How many customers did I have

[01:27] at the beginning of the month?

[01:28] Now, of these people that I had at the beginning,

[01:31] 30 days later, what's the number of those people

[01:34] that I have at the end?

[01:34] Not the number of customers in total,

[01:36] because you might sell people in between,

[01:38] but I wanna know of the people at the beginning

[01:39] of the month, how many of them are still there

[01:41] at 30 days later?

[01:42] So if I had 100 people here at the beginning,

[01:44] and I had 90 people at the end,

[01:46] then I would have 10% turn.

[01:48] You're like, okay, what is that?

[01:49] The number?

[01:50] No, what we then do is we take one,

[01:53] and we divide it by this number,

[01:56] which then means that our average lifespan in this example

[01:58] would be 10 months, or 10 intervals,

[02:00] whatever interval you're measuring on.

[02:02] Because if I did this quarterly,

[02:03] it would be the same thing or annually, it would be the same thing.

[02:05] Number of people at the beginning, 100, number of people at the end,

[02:08] 90, I lost 10, meaning I have a 10% turn,

[02:11] one divided by 10%, equals 10.

[02:13] So the average number of months that someone's days is 10 months.

[02:17] Everything that I'm gonna show you today

[02:18] is stuff that you can do.

[02:19] Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.

[02:21] There's nothing else.

[02:22] You don't have to be a genius to learn how to invest

[02:24] or build a business.

[02:25] So now that we just covered lifetime,

[02:26] now we need to figure out gross profit,

[02:28] which is how much extra cash do we have left over

[02:32] for me, each customer after we do a transaction?

[02:34] The simplest example I can give you is,

[02:36] if this cost me a dollar and I sell it for $2,

[02:39] then I have a dollar of gross profit.

[02:41] Now, I still have to take that dollar

[02:43] and pay other costs I have to pay rent, I have to pay,

[02:45] other fees that go along, and then my margin is now

[02:48] squeezing from that 50% that was left over

[02:51] until my net margin becomes at the end of the day.

[02:53] With widgets or physical products, it's really that simple.

[02:56] It's just price, minus, cost of good sold.

[03:01] And so cost of good sold are gonna be all the costs

[03:03] that you have to incur,

[03:04] specifically related to delivering the product.

[03:07] All you're trying to figure out is that the basic

[03:09] transaction, how much money you have left over.

[03:12] Now, with physical products, it's typically much simpler

[03:15] than with service-based businesses.

[03:17] But I'm gonna give you a service-based example

[03:18] so you can still understand it

[03:20] because you need to, you need to.

[03:21] If I sell customers for $1,000 a month

[03:24] and I've a employee who cost me $4,000 per month

[03:28] and each employee can handle 10 customers.

[03:30] That means each employee handles $10,000 per month

[03:34] for 10 customers.

[03:36] So now all we have to do is say,

[03:37] what is our gross margin?

[03:40] We're gonna take the $10,000,

[03:42] we're gonna subtract $4,000 from it

[03:44] and that gives us $6,000 per month, gross profit.

[03:50] Which sometimes here expressed as a percentage,

[03:52] which would be 60% gross margins.

[03:56] Both of these are the same thing.

[03:57] One is an absolute number, the other percentage.

[03:59] You're seeing how $4,000 is my cost.

[04:01] This is how much I make.

[04:02] Subtract the two that gives you the margin

[04:05] and that gives you the percentage.

[04:07] Now remember, we figured out what our lifetime was

[04:09] and we figured out how much we make per customer

[04:11] or how many months they stayed.

[04:13] And that instance.

[04:14] Now, we combine those two metrics

[04:16] to get the one lifetime gross profit.

[04:18] Earlier, we did the 10% sure an example.

[04:20] And so let's say that these customers

[04:21] stay on average for 10 months.

[04:23] Because this is for 10 customers.

[04:25] We can divide this by 10, which gets a $600 per month per customer.

[04:29] So I just divided the $6,000 by the 10 customers

[04:31] to get my how much do I make per customer per month.

[04:34] So that's $600 per month per customer and gross profit.

[04:38] Now we said earlier that they're staying for 10 months,

[04:42] which means that my lifetime gross profit per customer

[04:46] is $6,000 of LTGP.

[04:49] So now I know that customers are worth $6,000.

[04:53] So this is important because now this is all the money

[04:55] I have to go spend to acquire them

[04:57] and run the rest of the business.

[04:59] This is probably one of the biggest mistakes

[05:02] that business owners make because what they do

[05:04] is they look at their lifetime revenue per customer

[05:06] and say, oh, as long as they cost me less than that

[05:08] in advertising, I'm making money.

[05:10] But I'll give you an extreme example

[05:12] to point out why that doesn't work.

[05:13] Let's say I sell these for $10.

[05:15] This pen for $10.

[05:17] But it cost me $9.

[05:19] And the average person buys 10 pens.

[05:22] So it's $100 in revenue.

[05:24] But it cost me $90 to sell the $100.

[05:27] But if my team comes to me and says, dude,

[05:29] we're killing it.

[05:30] We're spending $50 to get $100 sale.

[05:33] We should do this all day.

[05:35] But what's really happening?

[05:36] I'm actually spending $50 to make $10

[05:39] in gross profit lifetime.

[05:42] Not a good equation.

[05:43] And so you don't want revenue to confuse you

[05:45] and this is like one of the biggest misunderstandings

[05:47] that I see business owners make,

[05:48] which is why sometimes because they don't know this,

[05:50] they don't know why they can't grow.

[05:52] The reason lifetime value and lifetime growth

[05:54] profit get conflated or confused is because

[05:57] many of the most formal businesses

[05:59] that are out there come from Silicon Valley,

[06:01] which almost exclusively is tech and software.

[06:04] And the gross profits on software

[06:05] almost always close to 100%.

[06:08] The two can flate.

[06:09] But for everyday business owners who have people,

[06:11] we have manufacturing, we have inventory,

[06:13] we have to pay for stuff to happen.

[06:15] That isn't 100%.

[06:16] And so we're not doing it off revenue.

[06:18] We have to calculate what our gross profit is

[06:20] because that's what we run our business off of.

[06:22] So far, we got our $6,000 lifetime gross profit.

[06:25] Cool.

[06:26] So we've got one part of this equation.

[06:27] This video is incredibly in-depth and tactical

[06:30] because I break down every concept

[06:31] to its absolute base units.

[06:33] So my recommendation to get the most out of this

[06:36] is to watch all of the concepts,

[06:38] understand them.

[06:39] So you see how they all work together

[06:40] to ultimately help you invest better

[06:42] and then come back through

[06:43] and then do each of the concepts individually

[06:46] so that you can apply them.

[06:48] Now we're going to talk about how much

[06:49] you cost to a car a customer.

[06:50] This is another one that people mess up.

[06:52] So what a lot of people do is they just look at

[06:54] how much it costs them to advertise

[06:56] to figure out how much it costs them to get a customer.

[06:58] That's partially true, but not completely for two reasons.

[07:01] The advertising budget if you're running paid ads, for example,

[07:03] is only one of the many costs

[07:05] that go into a car a customer.

[07:06] The other issue is that you're not including the labor.

[07:08] So let's say that we have five employees

[07:11] that cost in total, $50,000 a month.

[07:14] That's the labor.

[07:15] And then let's say we're spending $50,000 a month

[07:18] in software and advertising like Facebook ads

[07:22] or Instagram ads.

[07:24] That means that our total cost for as a company

[07:27] is $100,000 per month for all the customers

[07:30] that we acquired that month.

[07:32] And so then all we do is you look back and say,

[07:34] okay, how many do we acquire over the last 30 days?

[07:36] Let's say this $100,000 bought us 80,

[07:41] 3 customers.

[07:42] So our cost to acquire a customer would be $100,000 by 83.

[07:47] So if it says $124,000, so this divided by that equals $1200

[07:54] and $4 cost to acquire a customer.

[07:57] Let's look at our math.

[07:59] If we have cost us $124 to acquire a customer

[08:02] in that customer makes us $6,000 in lifetime gross profit,

[08:07] we're killing it.

[08:08] So that means that we have a five to one LTGP

[08:11] to cat ratio.

[08:13] And if you're like, is that good?

[08:14] Or is that bad?

[08:15] Five to one is great.

[08:16] You want to make sure that you're always

[08:18] at least greater than three to one.

[08:21] Meaning your lifetime gross profit,

[08:23] compared to how much it costs you to make that money,

[08:25] is at least three times greater.

[08:27] Otherwise it'll be too constrained to scale.

[08:29] If this is bad, I don't need to look at anything else.

[08:32] I can just automatically toss the business out.

[08:34] And if this is exceptional, I might be willing to overlook

[08:38] or forgive some other metrics

[08:39] that are coming down the line that aren't as strong.

[08:42] But if you don't know these numbers

[08:43] in a business that you're buying or investing

[08:45] or a business that you own, find them out.

[08:47] So I told you earlier that I was gonna give you seven.

[08:50] Well, it turns out that that was three of them,

[08:52] because the ratio is one, gross profit is another

[08:56] and cac is another.

[08:57] So we covered three, we're already almost halfway there.

[08:59] So number four is return on invested capital.

[09:02] All right?

[09:03] What we're looking at is how much money does it cost us

[09:06] to expand the business?

[09:07] There are some businesses like an accounting firm, for example,

[09:11] that the way that they expand the businesses,

[09:12] that they just hire more accounts.

[09:14] There really isn't a lot of what they call capital expenses,

[09:17] which is why I tend to like service businesses.

[09:19] Now on the flip side, if I was into manufacturing,

[09:21] I'd have to do factory in all the machines, a new location,

[09:24] another build out that would go into expanding our capacity

[09:28] to make more stuff.

[09:30] Whatever business you have,

[09:31] I do a lot of brick and mortar stuff.

[09:33] I wanna know first, what's the LTE GP

[09:36] Cac ratio at the customer level?

[09:38] But then how much does it cost me to make a location and scale it?

[09:41] So for example, let's say I have to put $100,000 in

[09:45] to open each new location.

[09:47] Now underneath of that $100,000 is gonna be

[09:49] the marketing budget to launch the location,

[09:51] the cost to do the build out, hiring staff,

[09:53] recruiters if we need that ads for Craigslist,

[09:55] to get new people in.

[09:56] Everything is included, because once you do this enough times,

[09:59] you do have a pretty good idea of what that number is.

[10:00] You say cool, it costs us a $100,000

[10:03] to open each new location.

[10:04] And at month six, we're here at 12 months,

[10:07] we're here and at X months, we're at capacity.

[10:11] The question is first, how quickly do I make my money back?

[10:14] Which is the payback period.

[10:16] Then what is my one year return?

[10:18] And then what am I making once it's at capacity?

[10:21] Cause I wanna know how much cash will this thing kicks off.

[10:23] And so in this example, I love to see at least three to one,

[10:26] ideally five to one, meaning if I put $100,000 in,

[10:29] once we're at capacity, we're at 500,000 per year in profit.

[10:34] I put $1 in, I get $5 out.

[10:37] And so this is the same concept as what we're doing here,

[10:41] but just it's scale.

[10:42] So I'm not buying one customer,

[10:44] I'm buying a custom printing machine.

[10:46] How much does it cost me to build another machine

[10:49] that creates profit every single year?

[10:51] And so from a returns perspective,

[10:53] if I can pay my investment back, for example, in six months,

[10:56] after that, everything's gravy.

[10:57] The part that people don't wanna talk about

[10:59] is that all of the stuff cost headspace, right?

[11:02] Which is that you have an opportunity

[11:04] to cost associated with any investment.

[11:05] Meaning what could you have done with the same level of effort

[11:09] and money in the same period of time?

[11:10] But if at month six, I'm breaking even,

[11:12] and at month 12, I'm at, let's say,

[11:15] pacing 250,000 year, and by the second year I'm at 500,000 year

[11:19] in profit, then great.

[11:20] This is now a node that just kicks off cash flow year after year

[11:24] after year, and then I say, okay,

[11:25] why 500,000 dollars, what am I gonna do?

[11:28] I'm gonna open five more locations.

[11:30] If something costs very little and makes me a lot, good.

[11:33] Now you might be like, well, the stock market gets

[11:35] 10% returns.

[11:36] That would be putting $100,000 in and getting $10,000 back.

[11:39] I actually really like to see at least,

[11:41] I mean, really three to one,

[11:43] which means a 300% return per year, kind of a minimum,

[11:47] which sounds ridiculous, but I'm putting time and effort in.

[11:50] So these are not passive investments for me.

[11:52] It's different if I give someone cash

[11:53] and they do all the work,

[11:55] then then I just get dividends, then that's different.

[11:57] But if I'm actively working, then I have to account

[11:59] for all the time that I'm putting into this.

[12:01] And so for me, I wanna make sure that I have a really

[12:03] strong return profile to justify the cost of time.

[12:06] So there's two big variables that come into faster slow

[12:09] payback period.

[12:10] One is how much is this build out?

[12:12] But if you have a massive build out,

[12:13] sometimes you can be hard to pay that back quickly.

[12:16] The second is how good they are at launching.

[12:18] Somebody might have five locations,

[12:19] but not really have a new location strategy for a new city.

[12:22] So this happens a lot in brick and mortar chains

[12:24] where they've got five locations in one city,

[12:27] and they can drive to all of them,

[12:28] but then they really wanna expand.

[12:29] And going from five to 20 is a totally different game.

[12:33] Now I mind you, that's what we specialize in,

[12:35] but you now have to go to a new market where no knows you

[12:38] and actually have a launch strategy that ideally,

[12:41] and this is what we like to do, fill up the facility.

[12:43] So I wanna get to this capacity as fast as you can possible.

[12:47] And sometimes that means, hey, you guys have

[12:49] a 10,000-dollar budget for opening.

[12:51] Let's put 40 into opening so that we're opening full.

[12:54] And then we're already at 500,000-year run rate by month six.

[12:58] So if you're a brick and mortar business, by the way,

[13:01] and you'd like to scale, go to acquisition.com,

[13:03] and to be clear, this is for businesses

[13:05] that are doing at least a million dollars a year in profit,

[13:07] ideally three to five.

[13:08] So let's go through number five, which is payback, period,

[13:11] simply put, how quickly are you paid back

[13:14] for getting a new customer?

[13:16] So we talked about return to an investor capital

[13:17] at the business level, but now I'm going all the way

[13:19] back down to the unit of how long's it take me

[13:22] to recover the cost you acquire customer,

[13:24] however, said, cat with $600, why spend 600?

[13:27] How quickly do I get it back?

[13:28] And so if you had two scenarios, one scenario where it takes you

[13:31] three months to get your $600 back,

[13:34] versus another scenario where you put $600 in and get $6,000

[13:39] in the first 30 days, which one do you rather have?

[13:41] Well, both of them at the same lifetime gross profit,

[13:44] you'd rather get the money sooner.

[13:45] That number of how long it takes me to get paid back

[13:48] is you can indicate of how cash little positive the business.

[13:50] For the big fancy investors, they don't care

[13:52] about as much because they're working with this massive companies

[13:54] and long payback cycles and all the stuff.

[13:56] But small business owners, that's how you live.

[13:59] And that's how you expand.

[14:00] What we try and do when we're looking at a business is,

[14:02] okay, what is the payback period?

[14:03] And are there some easy levers that we can do to drive it forward?

[14:07] I'll give you a couple of easy ones.

[14:08] So number one is I could say, hey, with that example we gave,

[14:12] it was a $1 a month.

[14:13] Could we just get them to pay first and last month of front?

[14:18] That being easy way to drive, drag some of that cash before it,

[14:21] then I could break even and make my payback period one month.

[14:24] A second way to do that will be some sort of fee,

[14:26] which is I say, hey, I have an onboarding fee

[14:28] and enrollment fee and initiation fee, a set of fee.

[14:30] But the point is that you charge a fee of some sort

[14:32] in addition to whatever the recurring revenue is.

[14:35] Third way to do it is you can have an upsell of some sort.

[14:38] This is structured as a fee, the others an upsell.

[14:40] This one is optional, this one is mandatory.

[14:42] Functionally, they're the same thing.

[14:43] We're trying to drag more of a new upfront.

[14:45] A fourth way you could do this is that you could get financing in place.

[14:48] You could get a third party bank or financing partner who says,

[14:51] I would like to make interest on some of these payments

[14:53] that you have with your business.

[14:54] I will front you the whole amount that this person owes you,

[14:58] but I'm going to take a piece for taking on the risk.

[15:00] It's you basically give your risk away to somebody else.

[15:02] They take a fee for that and then you get cash upfront.

[15:04] For easy ways that you can think about to try

[15:06] and decrease your payback period,

[15:08] in other words get more cash faster.

[15:10] If we're looking at this from a timeline perspective,

[15:12] so $1,200 with the cost to acquire,

[15:15] if we spread that out, the first one they get 600,

[15:17] so I'm still at negative 600,

[15:20] and then I have another 600 that comes at month two.

[15:22] So now I'm at zero.

[15:23] So it took me two months to break even.

[15:25] In the second scenario, I add a fee, let's say,

[15:29] another $600 and it's just processing fee.

[15:32] I cost me nothing to do this.

[15:34] So now my first transaction, I make $1,200 back,

[15:38] and I'm already at break and even at zero.

[15:40] And then here, I get my 600, but I'm plus 600 now.

[15:43] And so this business is a healthier business

[15:45] that we more adapt the more resilient

[15:47] and a downturn than this one.

[15:48] Let's do number six, six and seven are real short,

[15:50] and then I'll give you a bonus one number eight.

[15:52] So these are all about predictions.

[15:54] So up to this point, we've got steady state of,

[15:56] okay, this is what the business is.

[15:59] Six, seven and eight are all about what it can do in the future, okay?

[16:03] So number one, that I love this one, is sales velocity,

[16:07] times lifetime gross profit, which means

[16:09] how many units are we selling per month,

[16:12] times what are these people gonna be worth to me

[16:14] over the lifetime?

[16:15] Now you can also do this as LTV as well

[16:17] because that's also a good metric to at least understand,

[16:20] especially if sometimes margins can improve with scale.

[16:23] So that can be helpful to just know both.

[16:24] Let's say that I sell 100 customers a month,

[16:27] times $6,000 in lifetime gross profit,

[16:30] and it was $10,000 in lifetime value, right?

[16:33] Which is how much revenue they're gonna generate,

[16:35] remember because we still had all the cost associated.

[16:36] The nice thing with this is that we can see,

[16:39] especially with this one, where the revenue of the business

[16:42] is going to be at scale.

[16:44] Because especially if you're recurring revenue business,

[16:47] it might take time for the business to actually get

[16:49] to its hypothetical max.

[16:51] And so the assumption here is that if nothing else

[16:54] changes in the business, they don't sell more customers,

[16:56] and the customers don't become worth any more than they already are,

[16:59] where will this business even now?

[17:00] And so in this example, $1 million a month.

[17:03] Now, this is why this is so important.

[17:06] If someone comes to me and they're doing $500 in a month

[17:09] and they have these metrics,

[17:11] then I know that the business is going to double

[17:13] without doing anything, which is great.

[17:15] On the flip side, if a company comes to me

[17:17] and has these metrics, which it's still good,

[17:19] and is doing $2 million a month,

[17:21] then I know that it's going to shrink.

[17:22] It means that they were either selling more units

[17:25] earlier on in the past and things something happened,

[17:27] their Facebook ads got shut down,

[17:29] they got a bad wrap on their content,

[17:31] or, and this is probably the more common one,

[17:34] they're delivery started to drop.

[17:36] And so their insurance started increase

[17:37] and so their lifetime values actually dropped per customer

[17:40] because they couldn't scale well.

[17:42] And so I can say, even though you're at $2 million a month

[17:44] right now, if things keep going the way they are,

[17:46] it's actually even gonna drop down to a million a month.

[17:49] All right, and so this gives you a really good idea

[17:51] of a snapshot of where someone's going to be

[17:53] versus where they are.

[17:54] So you might be wondering,

[17:55] how can the lifetime value of a customer change for a business?

[18:00] Will a turn goes from 5% to 10%

[18:02] that it means you cut your lifetime revenue in half?

[18:06] Tough.

[18:07] But that's why turn numbers in retaining customers so important.

[18:09] Because if you go from 10% turn to 5%

[18:11] you also double the lifetime revenue of a customer.

[18:15] And so this is why the health of the business

[18:17] based on what it's hypothetical max is can change.

[18:20] And so the longer period of time you take the average over,

[18:22] realistically the more accurate will be.

[18:24] If you did this on a daily basis, it would be really volatile.

[18:26] In smaller businesses, more businesses are volatile.

[18:29] And so it's good to have snapshots of,

[18:31] okay, well, what was it?

[18:32] Trailing 90, Trailing 6 months, Trailing 12 months,

[18:34] to get a much better idea?

[18:35] And you can calculate this at each of those

[18:37] and then you can look at all three and say,

[18:38] okay, well, this is what I think it really is.

[18:40] And all of this helps you ask better questions

[18:42] as an investor.

[18:43] So I'm gonna give you the next one,

[18:45] which is very similar to this one,

[18:46] which is sales velocity divided by turn.

[18:50] So turn, remember we defined this earlier at the beginning,

[18:52] the number of customers, and let's say it's 10% per month, okay?

[18:55] It's the number of customers who leave.

[18:57] And let's say again, we've got 100 customers

[18:58] in terms of sales velocity.

[19:00] This means that our hypothetical max in terms of logos

[19:04] or a number of customers that the business is going to have

[19:06] to sustain or maintain is gonna be a thousand customers.

[19:11] Now remember, we have a thousand customers,

[19:13] members paying a thousand dollars a month, $1 million a month.

[19:17] These calculations work together.

[19:18] This tells me how much money we're gonna be making

[19:20] when we're at our hypothetical max,

[19:22] and this tells me how many customers

[19:23] are gonna have to be servicing at our hypothetical max.

[19:26] We're coming down and I'd say we'll do right now,

[19:29] you have the infrastructure to maintain 2000 customers.

[19:31] But we're gonna be at a thousand,

[19:33] you're gonna have to be looking at headcount,

[19:34] which sucks.

[19:35] On the flip side, if we've got 500 customers,

[19:38] we're doing 500,000 a month,

[19:39] and I know we're gonna get to a thousand,

[19:40] I'm gonna say, hey, how could we scale

[19:42] and make sure that we don't break on our way to a thousand,

[19:44] because we're gonna get there in X months.

[19:46] That's six and seven, and now we'll go to bonus number eight,

[19:49] the secret bonus, which wraps all of this stuff together.

[19:51] This equation is really in relation

[19:54] to how big the opportunity is.

[19:55] So Tam is just a fancy word for total adjustment market,

[19:57] which is how many people could I potentially sell.

[19:59] And so what I'm analyzing an opportunity,

[20:01] is number of potential units, times lifetime gross profit,

[20:05] is divided by risk.

[20:06] And so this ultimately gets at how big of a company

[20:10] do I think this could ultimately be?

[20:11] If we're servicing, you know, vegan, moms with three kids

[20:15] who like powerlifting, then there might only be 50,000 of them.

[20:19] And so I'm gonna have 50,000 potential units sold.

[20:21] That's assuming we get 100% of the market to buy.

[20:24] And that might not be true.

[20:25] But that would be here.

[20:26] Is what, how many units could we potentially sell?

[20:29] The lifetime gross profit is what,

[20:30] how much do we make on all of these people?

[20:33] This would give us an idea of how big the opportunity is.

[20:36] This is all the good stuff.

[20:37] The big question is how likely is that going to happen?

[20:40] Risk has a zillion categories.

[20:41] So that's beyond the scope of this video.

[20:43] But do I think that there is a trend,

[20:45] are there gonna be more vegan parallel thing moms in the future?

[20:47] They mean less vegan parallel thing moms in the future.

[20:49] So for example, right now I am looking at fertility stuff.

[20:53] Tons of people are having fertility issues.

[20:54] I think it's gonna be a booming market in the future.

[20:57] So something that services anything related to fertility

[21:00] will probably have big tailwinds behind it.

[21:02] You can apply risk to each of these.

[21:04] So from selling potential units is okay,

[21:06] is the way that we're a client customer,

[21:08] something that's really risky.

[21:09] Are there gonna be platforms that are gonna change?

[21:11] Do we expect that this method of getting customers sustainable?

[21:14] Is there key man risk?

[21:15] Is there somebody using charge of that department

[21:16] that if they left would be screwed?

[21:17] All of these are factors of risk

[21:19] of how likely to have in the future.

[21:21] From the lifetime gross prosper for perspective,

[21:23] are there other competitors that could come in and undercut us?

[21:25] How strong is our position in the marketplace?

[21:27] Do we have a better product that can sustain a premium?

[21:30] Are there economies of scale that we can have

[21:32] or is there shrinking margin?

[21:34] So sometimes it can happen at scale.

[21:36] And so these are all risks that could affect our gross

[21:39] profit per customer over the long haul.

[21:41] Some people, I think, okay, well, how important is tam?

[21:43] It is extremely important that the ability to assess it

[21:46] is very limited.

[21:46] This is one of those important and unknown,

[21:49] which is Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett

[21:50] talk about a lot, which is like, you've got things

[21:53] that are noble and unimportant and important.

[21:56] And we just wanna focus on the noble and important.

[21:59] The economy and interest rates,

[22:00] very important is it noble?

[22:02] No, so they don't try to predict it.

[22:04] With tam, I see it kind of in that, very important,

[22:07] but not noble.

[22:07] And here's why.

[22:08] The amount of companies that start with a niche

[22:11] and then expand and expand and redefine

[22:13] their customer, redefine their avatar, most businesses have.

[22:16] Especially the biggest ones.

[22:17] Amazon started as a bookstore, now it's in everything store.

[22:19] Facebook started as a social network for college kids.

[22:22] And then became the everything social network.

[22:24] And so many huge examples start small

[22:26] because they would a narrowly defined

[22:27] problem for a specific avatar and they expand over time.

[22:30] But the main point for this one is how much risk

[22:33] am I exposed to that is noble

[22:35] that I think could potentially break this equation

[22:37] from working in the future.

[22:38] When you take the first seven

[22:39] and you plug that into this framework

[22:42] for assessing value or how big this could potentially be,

[22:45] then you have a very good framework

[22:47] to analyze a business yourself

[22:49] or others to potentially invest in

[22:50] or say, I'm a no one this one dog.

[22:53] And by the way, if you don't have something like this,

[22:56] I'd recommend just put one Excel sheet together

[22:58] that tracks your numbers automatically every month

[23:00] because you'll get a much better idea

[23:02] of how your business is doing

[23:03] from a health perspective.

[23:05] Again, if you're brick and mortar chain

[23:06] doing a million dollars in profit per year or more

[23:10] and you've got a sound model and you want to expand,

[23:12] we're looking for you right now.

[23:13] We've done super well with brick and mortar chains,

[23:15] expanded really, really big

[23:17] and we're just looking for awesome businesses

[23:19] that we can get involved in.

[23:20] So specifically service based businesses

[23:21] million plus ideally three or five million in profit.

[23:24] So if that's you, reach out to us,

[23:25] so we can make it rainy again.

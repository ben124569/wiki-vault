[00:00] Bring on a f***ed emic, I got cash.

[00:02] And that's how I went broke.

[00:03] Walking through how you ended up scaling that.

[00:05] If you had advice that you could give 40-year-old Dave,

[00:08] would you tell him?

[00:17] I am super thrilled to be here today because Dave's a legend.

[00:22] And I'm going to give a little bit of an intro from my perspective of you.

[00:27] This is a little scary.

[00:28] And I actually wanted to take the first few minutes to actually kind of like hype

[00:34] Dave.

[00:35] And I think it's because like in the marketplace of attention right now,

[00:38] I actually still think you're underpriced.

[00:40] I still think that you are underappreciated for the amount of value that you provide to the

[00:44] audience to large.

[00:46] And flattery will get you everywhere.

[00:47] Got me here.

[00:50] But one of the things I wanted to hit on was, like I see, and I'm sure you do,

[00:55] your team does, like there are a lot of people who take, I'll use the term fake gurus,

[00:59] but a lot of people who haven't achieved a 100th of the level of success that you have,

[01:04] that take a lot of shots and at you.

[01:06] And specifically, we're in your views on debt, but sometimes just in general.

[01:11] And we have a big belief at Acquis or notcom that the only people ever hate you are never

[01:17] ahead of you.

[01:18] And I feel like that's been extremely true and tough for people to be ahead of you in general.

[01:24] But I just want to give context for my audience that number one, you've been doing this

[01:31] for three decades.

[01:33] Yeah, a little over three decades and overnight three decades success.

[01:39] Yeah, for real.

[01:40] And just in time to get old.

[01:44] And what I'm going to be directing the conversation in day around is actually around business

[01:49] stuff.

[01:50] And I'm going to be really resilient things on personal finance.

[01:52] I mean, I think that was the wedge product that helps you a lot of everything.

[01:57] But because our audiences predominantly business owners, I want to focus on the actual building

[02:02] of Ramsey Solutions.

[02:04] And kind of some of the things that you learned along the way, some of the big mistakes that

[02:08] you did, some things that you'd go back in time and would have done differently.

[02:12] And even as you've kind of scaled the brand.

[02:14] So that's kind of the direction.

[02:15] Okay.

[02:17] So can you give a little bit of background in terms of how Ramsey Solutions

[02:23] the education business, which was the first business, correct?

[02:27] They've all kind of evolved together.

[02:30] Okay.

[02:31] How did that come to be?

[02:33] And then what was your thinking around the business model at that time?

[02:37] And like, what is it evolved into?

[02:40] Well, all of it started extremely primitive.

[02:48] I mean, like, one plus one equals two barely, you know, kind of thing.

[02:54] And so, like for instance, we started, I went down there's a talk radio show,

[02:59] our talk radio station in Nashville at the time.

[03:02] There was in chapter 11 bankruptcy.

[03:04] And there was a guy doing a bad financial show, like a Saturday night live skit.

[03:08] You know, on there, I went on a guest on the bad financial show.

[03:12] And I didn't have any books.

[03:13] I just went on for fun.

[03:14] I was actually promoting a real estate club I was in.

[03:17] And he said, hey, I hear you're helping people with your foreclosures and helping

[03:22] them stop getting the car repot or if they're having financial trouble.

[03:26] Over to your church, are you doing that?

[03:28] And I said, yeah, I'm just kind of doing that for fun just to help folks as a minister

[03:31] at the church.

[03:32] And he goes, wow, if you got any questions about that, call up and phone rang.

[03:36] And he never got any phone calls.

[03:37] He didn't know what to do.

[03:38] And he even knew how to put the down the air.

[03:40] And so, he said, hey, come back.

[03:42] Let's do that again because there's phone never rings.

[03:44] And so, I went, I did it like two times and then he quit.

[03:46] And then we went down, talked to that guy that, that was running that station and

[03:50] deletting us work for free.

[03:52] And so, a couple of guys, me and a couple of the guys went on the air, answering questions

[03:57] in a really heavy, hillbilly twang.

[04:02] WW, tell you, Ian, you're talking nice feel, y'all calling in.

[04:06] I mean, it was nasty, buddy.

[04:08] I'm telling you it was nasty.

[04:10] But with information was good in the phone rang from the very first day.

[04:14] About the same time, I had finished writing on my laptop in my living room.

[04:20] On the very first version of Windows.

[04:23] This is 1992, my first book and I self published it, carried home on the trunk of my car.

[04:28] Got a thousand copies.

[04:30] And I went on the radio and said, hey, I'll get my book and some people did.

[04:35] And the 18 months later, Edject, to get to your question.

[04:41] We moved the card table out of my living room and one old beat up desk from the days when I went bankrupt.

[04:47] And open an office in 800 square foot, month to month rent.

[04:51] And me and another guy, the other guy was going to do financial coaching.

[04:54] The way I teach to do that.

[04:56] And when we launched an April of 1994, a class on how to handle money, it was actually how to avoid bankruptcy.

[05:06] And one of the lessons was on the different types of bankruptcy.

[05:09] One of the lessons was on how to stop a foreclosure if you're at SNAFHA, if it's a VA, or if it's a vanity,

[05:14] a different process, it's just a foreclosure.

[05:17] And all these different things.

[05:19] And the people that came weren't bankrupt.

[05:22] They were just making a lot of money and spending it all.

[05:25] So they were broke.

[05:26] It was all the money comes in.

[05:27] All the money goes out.

[05:28] Only the name of the change to protect innocent.

[05:30] But they weren't behind on their house payment.

[05:33] They just were fighting with each other in their marriage.

[05:36] And they didn't know how to do a budget.

[05:37] And no one ever told them about insurance.

[05:39] So I took the bankruptcy and the foreclosure lesson out and replaced it with a retirement lesson.

[05:45] And here's how investments work.

[05:47] Lesson compound interest.

[05:49] And which is still for the general public causes their brains to just go melt down.

[05:56] And a wonderful way the first time you see compound interest.

[05:59] And so yeah, that was called life after debt in April.

[06:04] And four people came the first night.

[06:07] A sole three of them.

[06:08] So for you digital people, I had a 75% conversion rate set up.

[06:12] But I'm telling you, it was primitive.

[06:14] Overhead projector bad suit, you know, that whole thing.

[06:17] And then we changed it to called it financial patient diversity.

[06:21] Five months later in September, six months later.

[06:25] And now financial patient diversity has had 10 million people go through it.

[06:28] And 50,000 churches have taught it.

[06:31] Unbelievable.

[06:32] So for context, the services that you had was education with some level of service kind of like

[06:39] Colding accountable or keeping them consistent on top of that.

[06:42] Which the reason that I was really intent on talking to you was that in the space that weren't today.

[06:48] And obviously the marketplace changed a lot.

[06:50] You have an education business.

[06:52] And I would say that the vast majority of quote education businesses are not perceived as legitimate.

[07:00] How do you think you've been able to anchor in it?

[07:05] Like it's very clear that range of solutions is a legitimate business, obviously.

[07:09] But why do you think that so many of them are not perceived that way?

[07:15] What's the gap?

[07:17] What are people missing there?

[07:19] I honestly don't know.

[07:21] I know that in the financial world in general, and I think most of your listeners and you and I will agree to this that there's a lot of us.

[07:32] I grew up in that world and I'm a nerd by nature and got a degree in finance for God's sake.

[07:37] So in other words, I thought the way to fix everything is with the math.

[07:42] And math treats the symptom, not the problem.

[07:46] And our brand differentiator, and it may be the difference in what you're talking about as well, is that we did come to understand that it's a behavior problem.

[07:55] It's personal finances 80% behavior 20% head knowledge.

[07:58] I've said that like I don't know, I eat million times in 30 years.

[08:01] But it is.

[08:03] And the problem with my money is the guy, my mirror, if I can get him to behave, he can be skinny and rich.

[08:08] And we've talked about all these lines.

[08:10] He's riffs that we did.

[08:11] And we do them over and over and over and over again.

[08:13] But that's the differentiator.

[08:16] That's the thing that you said, oh, yeah.

[08:18] Because knowing how to do a budget is different than actually doing one.

[08:23] Knowing how to live on less than you make or that you should is different than I actually doing it.

[08:27] Knowing that eating 73 donuts will make me fat is different than not eating 73 donuts, right?

[08:34] Personal testimony.

[08:36] But yeah, that stuff.

[08:39] I think that's the difference.

[08:41] And then what has happened is that if you go through and you do the stuff that we teach, and we've got the systems in place to help you be able to countable to do it.

[08:52] And encourage you when you're struggling and scared and hopeless.

[08:56] But if you're arrogant and prodful, either way, we're going to be there in your grill saying we love you so much that you need to change.

[09:04] If you do the stuff and you actually make the changes due to the accountability that because he's doing what you've been doing, you keep getting what you've been getting.

[09:13] So you got to change the recipe.

[09:14] So if you change the recipe, you have success.

[09:18] And lives transformed is legitimacy.

[09:22] That gives you legitimacy.

[09:24] And so in other words, I don't know if they set out to be illegitimate, but they didn't, maybe they didn't have the life wasn't actually changed.

[09:34] You know, if I join a gym and then I don't get anything out of that, I don't have any weight loss, no increase muscle tone, no increase to rub it.

[09:46] But whatever it is, you're trying to accomplish, if I don't get any of that, even if it's my fault, if feels like the gym is illegitimate.

[09:54] I don't think the gym is necessarily legitimate, but the results were illegitimate.

[09:58] And so then you get labeled that way.

[10:00] And so I hear people say, Dave Ramsey stuff doesn't work.

[10:03] The haters, right?

[10:04] And it absolutely does not work unless you work it.

[10:07] Yeah.

[10:08] I guarantee that.

[10:09] I can make you that personal guarantee.

[10:13] I'm going to go back to the business.

[10:17] Explain to me how the actual products we developed over time.

[10:21] So in the beginning you had the education and then you had the services that layered on top of that.

[10:26] Was that the main thing for a decade or, and like walking through how you ended up scaling that?

[10:31] Was that all through media?

[10:33] Oh, we had the radio show didn't make money for a decade.

[10:38] Because I don't pay you to do radio.

[10:41] Even today, I don't pay by radio stations.

[10:43] I have a clock split with them.

[10:45] And so, and we didn't have anything to sell when we split the clock.

[10:50] And so whatever we put into radio was lost dollars.

[10:55] But it was the megaphone.

[10:57] It was the lead mechanism.

[11:00] Okay.

[11:01] And so we, I start doing some speaking, and I thought, hey, we could do like a little public event in town,

[11:08] because we were only on the air and looked at, but we were on the radio and now it's just,

[11:12] I think we had, I don't know, a hundred people or something come out.

[11:16] And paid us like 40 bucks or something to sit for three hours or five hours or what it was.

[11:21] And listen to me, hammering my heel building, twang about getting out of debt.

[11:25] And so we had live events started to develop.

[11:28] We had the little book.

[11:29] So we had a little bit of a publishing thing going.

[11:31] And we had the class itself, which is a long form.

[11:35] It's a combination of 12 step and curriculum, so to speak.

[11:40] And so radio publishing live events, those were the first, and what becomes financial

[11:46] piece of university were the first, oh, and one on one coaching.

[11:49] Yeah.

[11:50] And one counseling we call it in those days.

[11:51] We now call it financial coaching.

[11:54] So there's no confusion that we're not licensed therapists.

[12:00] Some people can't seem to, it's not clear.

[12:02] But anyway, coaching is hard to mess that up.

[12:04] So yeah, so we do that.

[12:06] And each of those things grew at different rates.

[12:09] And so there were different times in the 30 years that financial

[12:14] piece of university was bringing in the lion share of the money.

[12:18] And then publishing would come up and pass it.

[12:21] Live events has pretty much always been a slightly profitable, but really good secondary

[12:28] lead source.

[12:29] Okay.

[12:30] So if you come to a live event, because you heard us on the radio, it's going down the

[12:34] funnel, the marketing funnel, so to speak.

[12:36] And then they might buy financial piece of university, which is nine week commitment.

[12:41] And it's a high, you know, it's still a $20 event ticket.

[12:43] It's a $80 to go through it or whatever they say.

[12:45] So we were working that there were always books on the back table too.

[12:49] So, and so once those things worked, and we had a new year, the book eventually

[12:54] evolved and was purchased by a publisher and became my first New York Times best

[12:58] seller.

[13:01] Once that happened, and then we start doing a bunch of, we start getting more and more

[13:05] radio stations and doing more and more media.

[13:07] So instead of just doing the local new sky, we actually, with the book tour the first

[13:12] time, got on the today show.

[13:14] And then that opened up something, then that opened up something.

[13:18] And then pretty much been doing New York media for 25 years.

[13:22] Obviously, all that's free, but it's lead generation.

[13:26] And so if I were to say this back to you, the radio station served as the big megaphone

[13:30] to gather attention and then point it in interaction.

[13:33] And one of the places you'd point it in the earlier days was the live events, which

[13:37] functioned a little bit as a conversion event.

[13:39] Exactly.

[13:40] And then those people would get funneled into whatever was appropriate for their budget.

[13:45] You know, either they buy some books or they buy the curriculum or they buy the

[13:49] curriculum and someone on one council.

[13:51] I'm already one of the five dots of coaching.

[13:54] And then that machine has been what you've continued to spend the wheel on and then

[13:58] gather more and more and more and more media.

[14:00] Yeah, we've got more and more product mix.

[14:02] Okay.

[14:03] I mean, we've got, you know, we ended up, I advertised for a stock brokerage firm.

[14:10] And then when I sent the leads, the people would go over there, the local broker that

[14:15] they went to would tell them to do stuff that I had just told them on the air

[14:18] not the right.

[14:19] And so that didn't work.

[14:21] And people are pissed off.

[14:24] And yeah, and so we said, well, guys, you don't can't do that with the leads.

[14:29] We send you what you can't tell us what to do.

[14:31] And I said, well, I can tell you, you can't advertise.

[14:33] So we're not going on the air.

[14:34] So we dropped those folk.

[14:36] And so the product suite from there, that was the core initial product mix.

[14:43] And then what we did was we would hear about some need that was a similar thing,

[14:49] a finger off of that.

[14:50] So for instance, a local coach at a Catholic high school was took my financial piece book and

[14:56] started teaching his seniors because they needed to know about personal finance.

[15:00] And then call me up and go, hey, I hope you don't mind.

[15:03] I'm like, well, I don't mind.

[15:05] And I'm kind of complicated.

[15:06] Let's work together on this.

[15:07] Let me have.

[15:08] So I went over and spoke to them a couple times or sweet kids.

[15:11] And he's a great guy to Greg Carson.

[15:12] He's a friend of this day.

[15:14] And we ended up out of that developing a high school curriculum.

[15:16] And this now been taught in 48 percent of the high schools.

[15:19] Six and a half million kids have been through it.

[15:21] And so, you know, that was, again, another product line, the Ed Solutions is another department,

[15:26] if you will, inside of Ramsey today, and pretty substantial revenues for high school

[15:31] college and even middle school curriculum.

[15:35] And then, you know, corporate America says, okay, we'd like for our employees to get this stuff.

[15:40] So we take a modified version of the financial piece university that doesn't have as much of the Bible

[15:45] stuff in it.

[15:46] And we have to not violate some HR rules and stuff.

[15:50] So we had to change some of it, make it a little more than I learned different things.

[15:54] And it's called Smart Dollar.

[15:56] And gosh, man, lots of 100, I don't know, 10,000 companies have now taught it, including big ones like you all in Costco.

[16:03] All of their employees are going through it.

[16:05] So that's a whole other product line.

[16:07] But it's, you know, the brand suite or the product suite continues to evolve as we look at different things where we can serve.

[16:14] We took over all the publishing and so we do all our books now,

[16:19] cell published have for about a decade.

[16:22] How do you think about spinning out new products like what to do versus, like, because there's obviously focus in a business, right?

[16:27] If limited time and resources like, how do you say this is going to be something we're going to just partner with someone on?

[16:32] Or this is something we're going to bring in house and actually own entirely.

[16:35] Or just not do it all in Ignore and just let somebody make some extra cash on it and we just don't worry about it.

[16:41] Yeah, well, one thing we don't do is we don't, we have made a conscious philosophical decision to not sell financial products.

[16:51] So we don't sell insurance, we don't sell investments, we don't sell real estate.

[16:56] We endorse people that do, but they don't work for us, they're advertisers of sorts, endorse, you know, our Ramsi trusted is what it falls under that brand.

[17:06] So some of them have ads on the podcast, some of them we say go the website a lot of form you find the realtor we recommend in your area.

[17:13] This Ramsi trusted that kind of thing and so that way when I'm giving real estate advice someone doesn't say, oh, he's just trying to get us to do that.

[17:21] Now they still say he's trying to just get us to be a real estate lead, but that's a different than he's trying to sell me a house or he's trying to sell me a mutual fund.

[17:29] We don't endorse particular mutual funds and we don't sell investments like that.

[17:35] So you can't say the reason they've done insurance is because or it's just turned about term insurance is because he owns a term insurance firm because I don't.

[17:43] And you know, one of the lies out there floating around is I own half of Churchill mortgage, I don't know a dime of.

[17:50] You've been nice if I had and I've done really well and I don't I don't have for some of his andre insurance or both advertisers been with me 26 27 years consecutively.

[17:59] And but I don't know any of those are just they're they're friends.

[18:03] I'm but I'm doing business with them for three decades and they do really well and I do a great job for our listener and so those are media partnerships.

[18:10] They're sponsors and that's how they're sponsors right.

[18:12] And they just advertisers on the on the original talk radio show, which is now like you guys I mean podcast and YouTube's and TikTok's and everything.

[18:22] Yeah, would have been some of the major.

[18:25] Beliefs that you had to break along the journey from and if so what's what's top line revenue today across all of the portfolio.

[18:33] I'm I'm comfortable using my own language, but at the problem for the solutions.

[18:36] Ramsey solutions are labs will be a little over 300 million a year.

[18:40] Okay, so for context in terms of size here for my audience 300 a lot.

[18:46] So what what what were some of them because you know a lot of businesses grow at least in my observation of businesses is there their stepwise.

[18:55] It's the whole grow the grow and then they'll hit something and they stay there until they figure out whatever that thing was and then they go super fast again and then they hit another wall and they keep going.

[19:04] What have been some of the you know two or three major pivot points in the business in terms of your lessons or beliefs that you had to reshape that allowed you to break through to new levels of growth.

[19:14] You know I think because the product line was so diverse.

[19:22] The different ones of those were stepping at different times and it caused our actual revenue growth to not stare step but to be fairly smooth interest on a curve.

[19:33] But like you know if we went for instance to financial patient diversity it went through different seasons where it would go.

[19:39] We in the it was stopping it was just sit you know and and we're kind of in one of those stop and sit modes now because we're making this transition from being primarily church distributed.

[19:48] Okay.

[19:49] Because churches aren't teaching classes like that in this current environment as much as they used to.

[19:53] And so we've got to have a more direct consumer digital distribution methodology and we're discovering that right now.

[20:00] So it's plateaued right now.

[20:01] That's especially University's awesome.

[20:03] It's excellent but it's from a business revenue perspective business model.

[20:07] It's you know it's big spike would have been the mid 2000s.

[20:10] Okay.

[20:11] I mean it made woo it went crazy up and it was kind of like the 800 pound gorilla revenue was inside the building and then it moved over to the other thing.

[20:18] So what are your question.

[20:20] I was not the stir step of question.

[20:22] Your question was what are some milestones along the way?

[20:26] Lessons.

[20:27] You've lived you had to shift that allowed you to be an entrepreneur that could get to.

[20:30] I mean, I mean do you remember when you hit your first 10 million dollars?

[20:33] Yeah.

[20:34] You're first 30 and you're first 100 and you're first you know.

[20:36] And you think any big changes that happened in you as a person that that you can denote and say I learned this and this is why we were able to break through that.

[20:43] Yeah.

[20:44] I figured out fairly early that.

[20:51] Organizations are not going to outgrow the character and intellectual capacity of their leadership primarily like me.

[21:04] And so if I'm if I remain dumb in some of the areas I'm dumb and then we're not going to be at 600 million.

[21:11] You know I've got to or somebody else will be doing it and if they remain dumb they can't you just kind of do I mean there's stuff you don't know and so I was a.

[21:20] I grew up in a real estate household, mom and daddy were in real estate business and so I've been selling my whole life straight commission for me myself employment is a.

[21:28] Is it my DNA? I don't know how to think about working before someone and so I'm and when you grow up in that world you know you learn to kill it and drag it home.

[21:37] You're getting anything to eat if you don't kill something drag it home and so.

[21:41] Very tactical and so I couldn't spell strategic when we started and we got large enough that we started hiring these things called MBAs.

[21:49] And these people that actually had and now over the years I got a ton of MBAs on the team and I love the MBA programs most of them that are out there.

[21:57] They do a really good job of teaching but one of the things I learned almost universally about MBAs they are heavily steeped in strategic thought.

[22:06] And so the MBAs on our team and me about 20 years ago might have really good trade.

[22:14] They taught me how to think strategically because I didn't know how and I taught them how to work.

[22:20] So it's a good trade.

[22:22] And so would you say that basically them coming in and talking strategy was like a big unlock in terms of what.

[22:29] And the critical thinking skills the way you solve a business problem how do you you know I would just go in there and go okay the answer is activity just go running into the wall and have times the wall will fall down.

[22:38] Meanwhile the MBA stand over the side going hey Dave over here there's a tour.

[22:42] Yeah just walk around.

[22:44] I mean you have to run into stupid wall.

[22:46] This is dumb and so because they're looking down on the maze.

[22:50] Yeah the land brinthens can see the way through and I'm just going just get after it.

[22:56] You know and you need to have both you have the energy of the hustle and grind and the because when in doubt activity is the answer but.

[23:06] Unfocused unplanned activity is not always fun it calls it pains sometimes too so we're much better at.

[23:14] Well my friend Jim Collins calls calibrated cannon balls now then just firing cannon balls.

[23:22] Which.

[23:24] From a branding perspective because I think you've developed a really strong brand.

[23:29] What are what are some of the deliberate decisions you've had to make to associate with versus not associating with.

[23:34] In order to continue to strengthen the brand expand the media because I would imagine like in the flywheel that is Ramsey Solutions the media is a huge part of that.

[23:42] And so like what has been one of the big things that kept that wheel spinning and expanding compared to the many other people who try to to top you.

[23:49] I mean even if people try to get more audience more earballs.

[23:53] Yeah I.

[23:55] I don't know we discovered I don't know how we figured it out it was accidental I guess it was people getting pissed at us and they were the guys.

[24:02] We you know like we would endorse something on the radio just local to local radio station and you know go to such as it's car live well somebody go over there and then go to try to screw me.

[24:11] Come up on the air come up in my house you know find me in the mall.

[24:15] You the guy you sent me to the dad gum crook Ramsey and so now I can trust you.

[24:20] Yeah and.

[24:23] And I would lose the advertiser because I would have to cancel them because I was ashamed of them.

[24:28] And so somewhere along the doing stupid stuff like not vetting who we're going to associate our brand with.

[24:36] And it's just buying it's oh we were so happy we had an ad sold you know middle revenue my god.

[24:41] And then you figure out that doesn't play well because you're destroying your credibility with the market we figured out we were a trust brand.

[24:47] And radio endorsement taught us to be trust worthy worthy of trust and so we're very careful.

[24:55] As a matter of fact just a few minutes ago I came out of a meeting where I turned down to potential advertisers and sales team said.

[25:02] We think we need to turn these down but before we do it's a lot of money we need to ask you and I said yeah that guy if we put that guy on he's going to cause our audiences not know that's not so would you send your sister there would you send your mom there would you send your friend that you place off ball with.

[25:20] You know would you send them over there and if that don't pass that acid test we don't put them on the air so if I won't really buy it or I don't really believe someone should buy it for their own good.

[25:31] I mean like a hundred percent of the things we advertise I don't necessarily buy personally if I stage of life but I'm not the market for them either.

[25:41] So but but I do believe in them and I believe they're good for you and sometimes we mess that up we've endorsed things we shouldn't have endorsed in the early days even I mean it's.

[25:55] For years I had a really disastrous one that was a mess and it calls me all kinds of problems but you know initially started out good and then turned bad and we didn't we didn't cut them off fast enough.

[26:06] And that's our fault for not cutting them off but we weren't doing it for money we were trying to help people and so it's a trust brand and so no single.

[26:16] The relationship advertiser endorsement is.

[26:20] It could not possibly give you enough revenue in our world to offset the damage it will do if they don't take care of the customer.

[26:28] Yeah because people all we've got is trust and if they don't trust us for that they also aren't going to trust us when we tell them to get out of that.

[26:34] Yeah also not going to trust us when we tell them hey this is going to affect your marriage you know the advice we give is no longer trustworthy if the endorsement is not trustworthy.

[26:41] So the whole stinking thing ends up revolving around this word and some we spend a lot of time discussing and vetting and.

[26:51] Cheeseclothing the whole it's a mess but yeah it's okay it's worth the effort.

[26:56] I agree.

[26:58] I'm with you on the and I mean I think that you know and that was not come we tried to the same kind of approach which is like how can we be as trustworthy as simply possible because you know we we do equity deals and so.

[27:08] We have a huge vetting process and you know 99.99% of the audience I have will never do business with me.

[27:14] But I still need to treat you know everyone so that the reputation which compounds is based on trust so that we can do deals over the long term and just to be very.

[27:26] Transparent it.

[27:28] It's emotional for me and most people in this building.

[27:33] When that doesn't go right.

[27:36] Yeah when we mesh that up somehow because we are intent is to never mesh that up and when it gets messed up it hurts our feelings more than it does anybody's.

[27:46] Mental mind give me this quote you might like it said never risk the empire for a pot of gold.

[27:51] Here it is that's a great one I love it.

[27:53] So speaking of positive gold so 300 million is where you are right now.

[27:58] You see as the next thing to get you know rampsy solutions to 600 million like you were saying earlier like what's the what's the path forward there like what do you see is the strategic opportunity what are you investing in right now.

[28:12] Well we're seeing an explosion with our every dollar app for one thing it's.

[28:20] With minimal effort honestly is a top fire so we're going to pull them we're guessing that while we're at it we're going to put some effort into it since it's working and we do think that financial piece of research is going to stir step again we've got to finish we've got to find that.

[28:35] Methodology for delivering those age old principles in a new met in a new way we are platform and delivery agnostic don't care how we get it to you but we got to get it to you and it's not an efficiently.

[28:48] With least friction possible so people actually do this stuff and so that that's there.

[28:56] Some things are going are logistically have in the last say 20 of the 30 years have.

[29:04] Not they didn't shrink they grew but they don't have the logistical ability to grow revenue wise as much an example that be live events only so much of that you can do.

[29:16] It doesn't it doesn't hockey stick right because you have a bottle that's not controlled bodies on a stage.

[29:23] Yeah and bodies to set the stage up and that kind of stuff and number of cities you can actually draw a crowd in and that kind of thing so.

[29:30] The only way you could hockey stick that thing would be to run the prices where they were just not for the average guy and our whole thing we do is for the average guy so.

[29:39] So that's going to if they if it stays the same regros at 5% and something else group 50% it's going to get to be a smaller and smaller piece of the pie.

[29:47] Mathematically but not still not be something we're ashamed of we love live events and I'm we're the biggest event companies in America we do it great live events.

[29:55] But but it's going to end up that one's not probably going to be the answer.

[30:00] Unless not streaming could.

[30:03] It would have to monetize for the first time but.

[30:07] I suck on monetization but but it's good to get an information out there so.

[30:16] I don't we don't see hardcover books is being something that's going to hockey stick in the coming years but I do think they're going to continue to be a valid part of the mix.

[30:27] So it's probably more digital application in delivery because it's the easiest to scale and lost cost of goods.

[30:35] And and it more easily iterates than anything analog.

[30:40] And the rate of change has exponentially increased in 30 years.

[30:46] It used what used to take us five years to see unfold in the market places unfolding in five or ten weeks right now.

[30:52] Yeah and how fast.

[30:56] And entire social media platforms become irrelevant is kind of amazing.

[31:01] And so you know betting the whole thing on one delivery method and as I'm and so.

[31:12] In my mind anyway but yeah so I think whatever it is is going to like an app like a budgeting app or a delivery digitally of FPU or delivery digitally of our on trade leadership which is our small business.

[31:24] A small business teaching and coaching.

[31:26] You don't have so many physical coaches for small business guys and that's got a limiting factor.

[31:33] I don't want 3,000 of those people in a building.

[31:35] No I really don't.

[31:37] Yeah a lot rather figure out another way to help you focus out there and that that is not as manpower hungry.

[31:44] So when you said the every dollar app just kind of like took off is that like a micro example of how product iteration works for you is like.

[31:52] Let's throw something together let's see how it works and then if it starts taking off disproportionately to like the effort you say okay.

[31:58] Now we're going to invest more resources in it.

[32:00] Yeah we put a huge amount of effort into building it.

[32:03] Oh you're launching the initial yeah it was a major initiative and a push and then it kind of you know it's it's how to good growth rate but it really wasn't.

[32:13] But something shifted in the marketplace I mean.

[32:16] Literally that's four five months okay and the way the consumer is viscerally responding to the word budget differently than they were certainly 10 years ago but probably even 10 months ago and so when we develop things so we're going to you know we've always iterated it we've always updated it we've always made it better every time and all that kind of stuff but it just seems to be some.

[32:41] And it's a potential that we didn't cause so why not join the parade.

[32:46] Yeah I think probably some of that's the macro economic environment has changed a little bit unless you know that period of time people are probably feeling the need for a budget.

[32:53] And it might be that I mean I think the product the original launch on it was.

[32:59] It's probably coming up on 10 years you know so okay and the you know the the number of people that are walking around adults that have.

[33:10] Never lived in the world that wasn't a smart phone world is much larger than it was 10 years ago.

[33:15] Yeah and so the marketplace is shifted in that regard with the the I phone the.

[33:22] Whatever whatever smart phone is native to a much larger percentage of population than it was.

[33:30] When it was launched so we may just be seeing that demographic shift and then.

[33:35] Yeah that because that you know that age group I mean if you're 28 you wouldn't ever think of doing a budget on paper.

[33:43] Right I would not occur to you that that come no more than you would handwrite a letter in cursive you know I mean it's just absurd so but you know when I started all this that wouldn't need one of those was that unusual right.

[33:57] So speaking of of the app in particular as is an increasingly large part of the pie.

[34:04] How does it measure compared to the other pieces like just by percentage you've got the events you've got the education you've got entrepreneurship.

[34:11] You've got the app you've got the live events like how how to how to how to how to those divide up in terms of like size for ramsy solutions.

[34:20] The ramsy trusted items which includes national advertisers and the whole smart vester pros all the indoors all the people we endorse for.

[34:30] Investing all the real estate agents all those there's about 8,000 9,000 different.

[34:35] People that we endorse for indifference areas tax really all that tax and real estate and investing.

[34:43] Through ramsy trusted and then you've got a singular national advertiser like a church or mortgage for mortgages and all that falls under ramsy trusted so that's a lot under there but.

[34:52] The the national associations plus the strategic alliances we call them that the what used to be called the ELP program.

[35:01] Probably amounts to 40% of the revenue really and so.

[35:07] Not.

[35:10] Not putting on back to our earlier conversation not putting on one that's bad.

[35:13] Yeah, is a big deal there because you're going to mess up the whole thing you know mess up the empire with that singular bad pot of gold.

[35:20] And so we have to you know to be a real estate agent and ramsy trusted you really are really really going to do the stuff we tell you do or really not go let you in there.

[35:29] Big deal you know and so because we love you and we love our customers and we want everybody to have a little love fast we don't need anybody pissed off so yeah you really going to do this stuff so that's probably.

[35:42] I think it's probably saying about 40% of the rams right now but that's half that had gum building to in terms of the 1100 people at work here on trade leadership is probably.

[35:52] 15% you know something like that a financial peace university is probably 15% you know every dollars.

[36:04] 10% maybe you're less is less than 10%.

[36:08] But they just kind of fall out like that publishing and live ends together not that huge revenue but again they're almost.

[36:17] Yeah they're almost lead gathering yeah things so.

[36:21] I'm probably thinking what else fallen in that piano but just something like that there's the big ones you know that's big rocks.

[36:27] How do you think about re allocating a reinvesting capital within the business versus taking it out of the business as an owner.

[36:36] Well we we don't randomly if we have something we can I can get more ROI here.

[36:45] On something that we have a high belief in then I could anywhere else.

[36:50] I mean certainly on mutual funds it really.

[36:52] I mean I love mutual funds real estate but I mean I can get a thousand percent our own launching a product and I can't even approach that on the other stuff so.

[37:00] I would rather deploy the capital here but I don't need to deploy it stupidly so.

[37:06] When in doubt we take it home and that take it out and you have to see it and plug it into the you know plug it in the generosity and plug it into some more real estate or mutual funds.

[37:20] So I'm going to pivot a little bit on the on the investing side because I wanted to give you something that you might not know but you did a podcast with Graham Stephan and he's a great guy.

[37:33] Yeah Graham's a nice guy.

[37:35] He's done a great job to on his stuff man.

[37:37] Yeah he's falling your footsteps in a lot of ways.

[37:40] He's different but I mean he's doing he's good he's we like him.

[37:44] Yeah Graham's a good dude and he showed you his investment.

[37:48] Poor folio.

[37:49] Oh yeah that's like a thing he does when he has a long and I'm like I don't know.

[37:52] Graham I don't know if I'm qualified to help you with that.

[37:55] You said something to him that massively changed the direction of how we invested just so you know that.

[38:00] Oh so I wanted to share that with you.

[38:02] So I think you had said loosely well before I look at this if this were your brain or your knowledge or your experiences what percentage of this pie would you say is real estate versus stocks versus anything else.

[38:16] He said well because he asked you do you think I'm over indexed on real estate but when you asked him the question you said well I mean I guess probably 85% of my knowledge is around real estate and I think is portfolio kind of reflected that you're like well then that's a perfect mix for you.

[38:30] And for me is we were coming out of the of our liquidity event we'd probably taken about 40 million home before that.

[38:36] I'm good for you that's all.

[38:38] It's not 300.

[38:39] It was 300 grossed.

[38:41] No you know the difference in grossing that.

[38:45] But anyways and so I had during while I was growing the business I basically just didn't really invest at all.

[38:53] I mean I just put in an indexes and it was like I'll deal with it later.

[38:56] And then we had the liquidity event and I had I talked to probably every guy that I know was who's rich or the main was like well should I do with all this.

[39:04] And the answers that I got were as different as there are people under the sun.

[39:09] Which left me more confused than anything.

[39:12] And so the reason that that little piece of advice that you gave to Graham was so meaningful for me was that it was personalized because everybody told me what they did.

[39:21] And what had worked for them.

[39:23] But you know one of the guys I asked was like oh take all that and buy one huge building and I was like I don't really think about I was like I really I don't want to risk everything on one building is like well I've been doing this 30 years.

[39:32] Like that's what you should do.

[39:35] I'm going to mess this up.

[39:36] Like that's where's the crap out of it.

[39:39] Yeah I've known it.

[39:40] I've known it in termites and toilets and all that stuff.

[39:42] I have no idea how any of that stuff works right.

[39:44] And so when I thought back on when I looked at that pie and thought okay well what's mine all is based.

[39:50] It was like his all business everything I've done has been business and all the money I've made has been business.

[39:54] And so I showed that clip to lay on my wife and I was like I think I think this is what we should do.

[39:59] I think we should just stick to business and just buy businesses and grow them.

[40:03] And so I love it.

[40:05] That's what we did with acquisition.com.

[40:07] Yeah.

[40:08] Wow.

[40:09] God for you that's a great.

[40:11] Wow.

[40:12] But that little piece of advice changed the direction of how I mean how we allocate all of our assets.

[40:16] And what we do because it's funny because when if I was going to write a five million hour check into a building.

[40:21] I got like you know three or four deals that were around that size in terms of check size.

[40:26] And I'd get all the way to the end and I was like I don't know what I'm doing.

[40:30] And I'm just trusting that this is a good deal like I had the Excel sheet and the you know projector returns on this stuff and I was like I don't feel good about this because I don't know.

[40:38] When on the flip side if I'm going to write a five million hour check into a business I feel fine about it because I'm like oh I know like I know I don't know everything.

[40:46] I don't know everything.

[40:47] It's not something.

[40:48] It's your it's your sandbox right.

[40:50] And so anyway that's beautiful.

[40:52] I love that that's what what happened was we had a product that we called.

[40:56] We called it a wealth coach for a little while.

[40:59] And we ended up doing these very small but we charged more than we ever tried like a thousand bucks because I'm always tried to 20 bucks.

[41:07] So to come to this little seminar and we didn't talk to these people that were millionaires or five million in ten million.

[41:13] And I kept asking them okay what do you put money into?

[41:16] Because they're they've actually done it they had money like you've actually done it you have money and so it's not someone with a theory.

[41:23] And so what I kept hearing from them was this array of all kinds of different things so I couldn't it wasn't the answer to the question wasn't a certain investment made them rich.

[41:35] What it was was they put money and stuff they knew.

[41:38] Yeah and I mean one guy was a car dealer and he had a massive classic car collection which for an ego driven person is a horrible idea.

[41:48] But because because you can lose your budding in any kind of collectible.

[41:52] Yeah, but for somebody that is in the car business and his grandfather had a dealership and he his father had a dealership and he had a he knows that love set.

[42:03] Yeah he goes out in the garage and pets the cars.

[42:05] I mean you know say guess what he's making that portfolio seriously gave him a great return.

[42:11] Now do I recommend to the general public go get a car.

[42:14] You know put money and stuff you understand and you love and don't put money and stuff because it sounds fancy.

[42:22] Or somebody you know it sounds sophisticated because there's something that happens when you get money you think that everybody that has money is sophisticated about their investing.

[42:34] And what I figured out is almost no one is.

[42:37] They're very primitive.

[42:39] A lot of people I talked to were farmers and we know what they're like lots of land.

[42:43] They got dirt man. That's it just dirt and it doesn't even I mean they don't even necessarily plan it but they just buy dirt.

[42:49] And one guy eight thousand acres of dirt you know and I'm like.

[42:53] And Kansas you know I'm like.

[42:55] I wouldn't even order good. I don't know anything about that kind of dirt. I like the real estate but that would scare me today.

[43:00] But for him it was the most comfortable natural thing in the world to your point.

[43:04] And so I just learned that. Put money and stuff you love and you understand don't put money and stuff because it sounds sophisticated.

[43:10] Because you're getting ready to lose your butt because you're trusting some guy who doesn't have any money who's trying to sell you something.

[43:15] And they're having a.

[43:17] Boy a bad car and so yeah.

[43:21] Well, name the bad car. But anyway.

[43:23] I mean that that's that's where that came from was just anecdotally hanging out with those folks and researching it and it gave me.

[43:31] Because I was starting to make bank for the first time and I'm like I need to be like doing double back flip limited family partnerships or some kind of crap.

[43:39] I don't even know what they are but I probably ought to be doing one if I'm making this kind of money and and then you talked to a guy and he's like yeah you ought to do a double back flip with a twist and I'm like.

[43:47] Yeah, but get right up to it and I'm going you know I don't have understood now. I think I'd rather just bury it in the backyard than that because at least I know where it is.

[43:54] You know.

[43:55] It's funny though because even though the dirt example.

[43:58] There was a guy who his entire investment strategy explained it in interview. He's like.

[44:02] You guys are going to be bored but we're going to do it for the next 55 minutes because I can explain it in five and we're like and I'm listing and like okay here.

[44:09] Here's it he's like okay. So what I do is I find a city.

[44:12] And I find the main street because usually there's a main street that goes through the middle of the city.

[44:16] It's the oldest street whatever second and I take a ruler and I go out 30 miles.

[44:20] He's like and then I buy all that land is like and then I wait 20 years.

[44:25] I love this guy.

[44:31] And what are the any questions?

[44:37] What are the any questions?

[44:39] So what do you want to do with the rest of our time together?

[44:42] They're like so how do you hedge he's like oh I didn't catch because you can't you know can't take loans on land and yeah that's that's what I do and we've been doing it for many many

[44:50] I'd dinner with the guy other than I did a two billion dollar net worth and he's second gen but his dad was dark doing dirt.

[44:57] Not unlike what your friend was doing and then he couldn't get the bank to do the deal.

[45:03] He was borrowing money to do the dirt and so he bought the bank.

[45:08] It was a little hometown bank and they screwed with him and so he bought it and he's like okay now they'll behave and then he started making money on the bank and got in and got to figure out how bank and and now they own like 15 or 20 thousand acres three wineries around the world and a whole bunch of banks.

[45:29] But it's a community banks and they and they're billion multi billionaires and so yeah, but it started from that and they don't really do anything else is that the wineries are more of a fun project.

[45:39] I don't think they know what they're doing with those probably the way he was talking he knew wine and the but the but he knows banks and it was dirt and that's where all their money is.

[45:51] And they're not diversified for having his millions with an ass you know I mean it's interesting.

[45:57] I though those kind of people are enthralling to me and it's interesting because most of the billionaires that I have looked at they usually make their money in one or two vehicles.

[46:06] They know exceedingly well where they feel like they have an unfair advantage and like they they get there not because there's a marketplace advantage but because they have an information advantage.

[46:14] They know it better exactly exactly and if you go through the four 400 I think it's 67% less time I looked at first gen.

[46:23] And they're all billionaires now you don't qualify if you don't have the and their first gen and I think I looked at them.

[46:33] Of the first gen's.

[46:36] It was 90 something percent or business driven so it was Michael Dale you know Bill Gates.

[46:43] Hobby Lobby David Green Chick-fil-A.

[46:46] Chiricathy you know and so they started a business and it led to either they took it public or they just monetized the credit I've been it just has a value marketplace valuation Oprah.

[46:58] Yeah, you know.

[47:00] But you know the secret of it.

[47:02] Oprah's wealth is not her celebrity status it's the empire she built under the celebrity status and so you know you go down those things like that and you go okay.

[47:10] You can get to one to five million dollar net worth with your 401k and your paid off home.

[47:16] Yeah, but you know mathematically impossible to get to a billion in your 401k it's not possible to do it.

[47:22] Yeah, so you got to do there's other strategies to be involved if you're going to do that.

[47:26] So I wanted to take a quick second because it would be hard for me to talk to Dave Ramsey about talking about debt and a lot of people so in my audience I'm kind of dead agnostic I don't talk much about it.

[47:39] But a lot of people don't know that I actually have no debt either and so everything that bought to this point my life has been cash.

[47:45] Now I'm not against it I just kind of like talk about a you know when I get right at the edge of something I just end up not doing it.

[47:53] It's been that way with most kind of loan things in general and I read financial or total money makeover.

[48:01] Years ago and you have this line in there about debt that was I'm going to try and say back to you as I understood it because there's obviously the big biblical component but for everyone who might not believe in that.

[48:14] I wanted to give at least my my rational understanding of how you see it which is that debt introduces risk and risk when it when compounded over a long enough time horizon no matter how big a number you acquire any number multiplied by zero still zero.

[48:29] And so if you know that you're going to be playing this game for a very long time even a small amount of risk when you're going 200 miles an hour can flip the car.

[48:37] That was my understanding of how you saw debt.

[48:42] Yeah accurate that's that's how I saw it or at least I interpreted your view on debt.

[48:46] And that line is actually from Warren Buffett.

[48:49] Yeah, and one of his famous annual reports there they're very cheeky funder read and especially the opening paragraphs or so and one of those he was talking about down year like a wait.

[49:00] You know we soon discover that leverage is not always your friend.

[49:04] That those of us that could do math realize that any number multiplied by zero is going to equal zero.

[49:10] Yeah, and that does that for you. So yeah, it's again having grown up in the real estate business.

[49:15] One thing you're going to do in the real estate business when I was growing up if you said I'm going to be a real estate investor.

[49:20] They took you to the hospital. They took out your risk meter and it broke it with a hammer and they put it back in.

[49:25] You're not allowed to perceive risk if you're going to be a real estate guy because because it's everything.

[49:29] It's everything. It's a glass have full where eternal optimists. Everything's going to work out because real estate's always awesome.

[49:35] It's just awesomeness on parade. You can't mess this up. The renters will pay your rent.

[49:41] Yeah, I'll pay your mortgage. How can you mess this up? And you know, so if a little bit of leverage is is good.

[49:47] Then a lot of leverage is amazing. And that's how I went broke.

[49:52] You know, I'd leverage up to my eyeballs on how to bunch a short term notes in the bank called did the unthinkable and call my notes when they got sold to another bank.

[49:59] And they saw 26 year old kid owed him a million to on the 90 day notes doing flips.

[50:04] This was before chip and Joanna told us how to do it. And so do a flip. Oh my god. And we didn't have HG to channel to tell us how to fix up a house.

[50:13] Without cable TV. I did it stuff. And so.

[50:18] Yeah, so that's where it came from. And then what happened to me because I lost everything following the.

[50:24] Barwall you can because it works plan. I had to stop and go. I think I've got a bad set of rules.

[50:35] The playbook I've got sucks. I keep losing. And my kids are getting skinny. I mean, this is not work or so.

[50:44] When I did that, the first as you said, the first door I went through was I was just become a Christian.

[50:51] And so I started studying the Bible. And so for my as a matter of faith, I started reading scriptures and all the scriptures say negative things about that.

[50:59] I don't say it's a sin. It's a your going to hell. But it's stuff like the bar or slave to the lender. You're a fool if you co-sign.

[51:05] I mean, it says these things as scripture. And then you talk to old rich people. And they go, oh, you stand at that boy.

[51:11] You know, and okay, that's kind of grandma. God's and grandma's always doing it. So what did I miss an academia when I fell in love with leverage from an academic viewpoint?

[51:22] Because how's it? It's incongruent to me that if this book of wisdom and these people that are long in the tooth with gray hair that have proof social proof.

[51:33] They've got money and they kept it are all saying avoid debt. What is it that we're missing in academic land with my intellect?

[51:41] So spiritual, social proof. Now I got to solve it intellectually. And what I ended up doing, I ended up speaking at Vanderbilt, who grew up in B.A.s early in my career.

[51:51] And it forced me to, because I knew I was going to go in there and get tackled, right? Because they're going to go in.

[51:57] You're primitive more on you believe the Bible, you know, you don't know anything and you don't know how to do math. And I know I don't know how to do math.

[52:04] As much of X about all I know how to do on my math guy. So what I figured out was, was that in business debt or real estate debt, business is not publicly traded.

[52:17] No one includes all the math. They leave out a risk factor associated with debt mathematically.

[52:27] And so we look at a very inaccurate and primitive measure of leverage.

[52:34] And so if I can borrow this money at 2% and I can invest it at 8, why am I not making 6?

[52:41] Well, A, you left that inflation, B, you left that taxes, but aside from that, and that's pretty basic, because this is argument.

[52:49] It's that argument, it's that primitive. But you did not adjust for the risk you took on.

[52:55] Because I think we can all agree if you have a business that's doing $10 million top line and you've got $12 million in debt, you have a lot more risk than if you had $2 million in debt.

[53:05] And even $2 million is more risk than if you had zero debt. We can agree that debt is equal to risk.

[53:11] And if we can agree to that, then we ought to be able to sign if we're going to really get down in the analytical jungle.

[53:17] We can assign a mathematical formula that. Well, Tata, there is one. It already exists. We just never applied it in that.

[53:24] In the investment world, they teach us to adjust. You don't compare an aggressive growth stock in mutual fund that has a high peaks and valleys on the graph.

[53:34] If volatile with a growth and income fund, which has almost no peaks and valleys. So a growth and income fund may have a beta of a point eight, meaning it is only 80% as risky as the SNP.

[53:50] When you're comparing it to an aggressive growth stock mutual fund that might have a 2.0, meaning it's twice as volatile, risky.

[54:00] And so in that world, we're taught, I mean, one of the first things you learn doing financial analysis in that world is the bet you use the beta as an inverse in the math and you flip it on its head and you multiply it through and you adjust for risk mathematically.

[54:15] So that you can then say after you adjust for the volatility, the point eight versus the 2.0 versus the SNP is a 1.0, it's your baseline.

[54:23] When you adjust for that risk, the perceived return of the aggressive growth stock mutual fund at 20% right return, where the other one's making 11.2, it goes away in neutralizes it.

[54:36] And you might end up with a risk adjusted, that 11.2 will come up and the 20% will come down, risk adjusted, and then you can actually compare apples to apples, but you've risk adjusted for the volatility and mathematically.

[54:51] We don't do that in business, right? We just go, oh, oh, oh, Bob Bulldozer, let's go get 50,000 to bank.

[54:58] And I think I can do it. I think we can push them to it and that is your risk analysis. Well, guess my butt, that is dumb, okay?

[55:06] And people do that all the time. And so what I determined was is that I'm going to go, if you want to compare two dry cleaners, you know, one has that one doesn't, I've got a risk adjusted for that mathematically and you have to apply beta formula that.

[55:20] I'm going to present that to the script of MBAs and they're all sitting there with their jaws on their lap going, ah, no one ever said that and I said it's because there have been said no one, no one does it in a world.

[55:30] No one does, no, you're not trained this way. You're trained that way and only one bucket of finance, all the other buckets of finance, zero real estate people do this. Zero.

[55:41] None. They do not analyze risk. And so if you take risk out, then unlimited leverage is logical. But if you say unlimited leverage, they go, oh, not quite maybe 80%.

[55:54] Maybe a 70% maybe a LTV, right? And, you know, if you push them up to the edge, they can actually feel it a little bit because there's a rimnant of a risk meter in there, but it just doesn't function anymore.

[56:06] That's where that came from.

[56:08] Oh, I love it. And more than you want it. But no, no, I wanted to kind of hear your take on it and because obviously in the business acquisition world, there's also debt that's that's factored in. Now we've done all cash deals up to this point.

[56:22] But I wanted to just kind of hear your take on it and I quote, I'm off of the lock.

[56:27] But even in the public-electrated realm, you know, if you, we were taught in and still taught.

[56:33] Bonser debt. And so if you're looking to come company with public-electrated stock, it has a heavy bond weight.

[56:39] You discount the PD. You don't compare that stock apples to apples with a company has no bond rate. Zero bonds.

[56:47] Zero debt. Then when bank debt, then on short term debt, there's no other debt free. You would give them some benefit on their stock analysis mathematically.

[56:56] We're taught to do that. But again, it does not transfer from the mutual fund world or the public-electrated world to the real estate world or the small business world.

[57:05] Small business, privately held business.

[57:09] This is not even. I mean, I know people that do, you know, have a billion dollar top line. And honestly, they don't even look at it.

[57:16] They just, they just, a lot of them just don't borrow money. They don't even know why they don't borrow money. They just don't borrow money.

[57:21] Because somebody told them to one time and they go, I like not being any debt. I can sleep better.

[57:25] And that's their entire analysis. You know, me, I've got analysis and I can do the country boy thing too.

[57:32] And so I just sleep better, bring on a pandemic. I got cash.

[57:36] Yeah. I'll bring this home because I had an, and I could talk to you all day.

[57:42] And I appreciate you taking the time to, you know, talk to me and the audience, the game.

[57:46] Have been on her. Fun. Fun conversation. If you had advice that you could, you know, I'll keep it specific to business advice that you could give 40 year old Dave.

[57:57] Would you tell him, then, that like you know now that you didn't know that?

[58:07] Play incremental long ball. Don't look for the home run.

[58:13] I keep waiting for somebody to call me and for this to get easy.

[58:18] One phone call and it's all over. And it's like, oh, no, I don't have to think about it anymore. Someone else is going to do it for me. It's all automatic.

[58:25] It's never going to be automatic. It's never going to be easy. It's a, it's a hustle and ground. It's a claw. You're going to make a bazillion mistakes.

[58:33] Make mistakes that are experiments that you survive. You put out hypothesis. You survive the experiment to live another day to have another experiment.

[58:42] I know that hypothesis is another product that fails. Another idea that fails. And our failures at Ramsey are, in, in, in number and in money or a way greater than our successes.

[58:52] The only thing is we survive them. A we didn't have debt and B we never bet the farm on one horse.

[58:57] And so from a diversification standpoint, we never pushed all the ships to the middle of the table on one hand.

[59:02] And so we're not looking for the singular home run. We're looking to survive and fight another day and keep iterating.

[59:09] And the culmination of that, the accumulated value of those iterations are what we call the gleaming mountain of success, which turns out as a pile of garbage and mistakes that you're just standing on rather than laying under it.

[59:26] I love that. One of the things that we have in our community is a hundred gold hundred golden BBs. No silver bullets.

[59:32] There you go. That's the one. That's exactly. You beat me. That's much better than mine. I'm just going with that.

[59:37] So same thing. I keep waiting on the phone call, but I mean, it's never. I had a couple of my thoughts yet. And then I was found out they were just people and they weren't magic.

[59:47] What's funny is I joke with our community because a lot of my community is small business owners. You know, probably, you know, from a hundred thousand dollars a year to a hundred million dollars a year.

[59:55] Probably like the broad brushstroke of the people who are listening to this.

[60:00] And the biggest thing a lot of them suffer from is, you know, shiny objects syndrome. Is that?

[60:05] Yeah. As soon as something starts to get hard, something new looks easy. And so they jump from the hard thing to the easy thing.

[60:10] And really it's just unenformed optimism. And then they get into it and then they have informed pessimism.

[60:16] That's beautiful. That's beautiful.

[60:20] Yeah. I mean, by the time it shines, you're late.

[60:24] You're late. It's too late. I mean, if you think TikTok is new, you're late.

[60:29] Yeah. It's already not new. It may have already turned down. And while we were talking right now.

[60:36] I mean, if we have a second, let me know. In terms of how, because you've survived a survived a strong word. You've thrived platform agnostic.

[60:46] You know, you have, I mean, you were in radio. You've done live stuff. But then I see YouTube clips of your show pumping out every day.

[60:54] You guys crush it on YouTube and you do it kind of your way.

[60:58] How have you thought about navigating platforms as they come and go and how you kind of reinvest in what where are we going to make a bad and say, okay, we're going to start expanding resources here.

[61:10] Or is it just if there's attention, we'll go there. Like how do you think through that?

[61:14] We try to go there and then we expend resources based on results. And so the YouTube shorts that we've been pumping out is only about a year and a half old.

[61:28] And we're getting incredible results. But we're getting results on those as an example.

[61:34] We don't view those as live transformation items. Okay. We view them as lead magnets to lead you to the long-form show to financial,

[61:43] and then you're going to have a good time.

[61:45] So, we're going to have a good time.

[61:47] So, we're going to have a good time.

[64:59] Create a YouTube short of anyone in the building or anything in the building.

[65:03] It is clipped from something we were already doing.

[65:07] So, it's repurposed content that was already developed for something else.

[65:11] You know, highly edited.

[65:13] Yeah.

[65:14] I mean, because I've observed what you're doing and thinking like,

[65:17] how can we do even more of that kind of stuff.

[65:19] Lots of payroll.

[65:21] That's a hard word.

[65:22] Yeah.

[65:23] We're media is.

[65:25] All right.

[65:28] This has been phenomenal.

[65:30] And I'm honestly just so grateful that they had me and my team out here to consider

[65:36] grandity studios.

[65:37] Is that what this would do?

[65:38] Yeah, I'm calling it.

[65:39] Grams, you should look for a studio.

[65:41] And just also so grateful for that one tiny tidbit that,

[65:45] wow, I'm honored.

[65:46] I had a tiny bit to do with all that you do, man.

[65:49] You're amazing.

[65:50] I'm proud.

[65:51] I've been well done.

[65:52] Means a lot.

[65:53] I appreciate it.

[65:54] Well, thanks so much for having coming on the game.

[65:55] Thank you, brother.

[65:56] I'll be something in the future.

[65:58] I absolutely can count on it.

[00:00] In this video, I'm gonna talk to you about incentives.

[00:02] How to get people to do the things you want.

[00:04] And if you don't know what the definition of power is

[00:06] by the way, the definition of power is how to influence

[00:08] events or people.

[00:10] All right, so the ability to direct your influence of

[00:12] events or people, that is the definition of power.

[00:14] And so most people, hopefully if you're watching this,

[00:15] you want to become more powerful.

[00:18] And the thing is that word makes you feel

[00:20] crazy on the inside, because you have a very poor

[00:22] definition of power.

[00:23] Power is neither good nor bad.

[00:24] What you do with it can be good or bad, right?

[00:25] It's just, it is just raw potential.

[00:27] So in this video,

[00:29] and if you don't know why I'm by the way,

[00:30] my name is Alex Ramosi, I'm an acquisition.com.

[00:32] It's a portfolio of companies that are $100 million a year.

[00:35] You wanna make these videos because a lot of people are broken.

[00:36] I don't want you to be one of them.

[00:37] All right, and I also have a lot of fun doing this.

[00:39] And so that is why I make it.

[00:40] So you want people to do stuff, right?

[00:42] There's the component of persuasion in getting them

[00:44] to believe that it is in their best interest.

[00:46] That is fundamentally what leadership is to get someone

[00:48] to believe that doing the thing that you want them to do

[00:51] is really just get them to want to do that.

[00:52] Right, that is what it is.

[00:53] And so a lot of leadership is power,

[00:55] which in a lot of power, if you sound in the definition,

[00:57] is selling.

[00:58] Today, I'm not talking about selling.

[00:59] I'm talking about incentives, right?

[01:00] So this is the kind of the brass tax side.

[01:03] There's the persuasion, the soft side,

[01:04] which is still very important.

[01:05] The psychology side, and the other side

[01:07] is kind of the behavioral side.

[01:08] And so this is adapted for a conversation

[01:10] that I had with my closest friend, Dr. Trevor Kashi,

[01:13] and we were talking about behavior

[01:15] and getting humans to comply.

[01:17] And so what I wanna talk to you about is the ways to do that.

[01:20] And so a big part of that, if my little,

[01:22] my little dude out of start working,

[01:24] let's just say, said, here we go.

[01:26] And we're gonna make a little boxy-do, boxy-do,

[01:30] fantastic, boxy-do completed.

[01:31] Okay, so if it's not a perfect box, do it.

[01:33] You've got pluses, and you've got minuses,

[01:37] and you can add them, or you could subtract them.

[01:40] With this means is that we have a combination

[01:42] of both punishment, and we have reward.

[01:45] Stuff that people don't want, and people stuff

[01:48] that people do want, all right?

[01:50] So for example, and I'm going to give us

[01:51] a simplistic reasoning to get someone to do something.

[01:54] So we'll use a simple one, which is,

[01:55] how do you get your kid to clean their room?

[01:56] This is a simple example that you can extrapolate to whatever,

[01:58] it is that you want someone else to do.

[02:00] You can add a good thing.

[02:01] I can give you a cookie.

[02:03] That is something that I can do.

[02:04] I can, if you do the chore, I will give you a cookie.

[02:07] Simple, you do the thing, you get the reward.

[02:09] Awesome.

[02:10] The next thing that we could do is we could subtract a negative.

[02:14] You get no cookies, all right?

[02:17] So they don't get to have dessert anymore,

[02:18] which would be impossible, because you can ever skip dessert,

[02:20] right, and it's like not in this family, right?

[02:22] And so we could subtract something that they do have

[02:26] that they like.

[02:27] Right?

[02:27] So if you don't do your chores,

[02:28] I will remove video games, or you don't get to eat dessert.

[02:31] Make sense.

[02:32] So those are two things that we can do with a positive

[02:35] or a reward.

[02:36] On the reverse of this is that we can add a negative.

[02:40] So you can say, I will spank your ass,

[02:42] I'm going to add a negative.

[02:43] I'm going to spank your ass if you don't,

[02:44] if you don't do your chores.

[02:45] Oh no, that sucks, right?

[02:47] But I'm going to add something that wasn't currently

[02:49] in your life that you will not like.

[02:50] All right?

[02:51] That negative, the fourth thing that we can do,

[02:53] and I'll get to how you can think through these in a second,

[02:55] we can subtract a negative, okay?

[02:58] So I plan on spanking every day,

[03:02] and I can remove spanking,

[03:04] or let's say there's something that you don't like doing,

[03:07] which might be like you're expected to do the dishes, right?

[03:10] You don't have to do the dishes,

[03:11] or let's say you don't like riding the bus, right?

[03:14] So you're only riding the bus,

[03:15] I'll drive to school, that's kind of like taking away native

[03:17] and adding a positive.

[03:18] Ah, right?

[03:20] And so we can do no dishes,

[03:21] which will be subtracting a negative.

[03:23] Think about these in this way.

[03:25] These are things that people want to avoid,

[03:27] and these are people, things that they want.

[03:29] Here's what's kind of interesting about all of this stuff.

[03:32] Incentive, strive behavior,

[03:33] there's tremendous amount of documentation on that,

[03:35] hopefully you're not going to fight that point with me, all right?

[03:37] But here's what's interesting.

[03:39] When you create punishments for people,

[03:40] people will do anything to avoid the punishment,

[03:42] which may not mean doing the thing that you want them to do.

[03:45] So for example, if your child stinks out at night,

[03:47] and then you punish them for stinky out,

[03:49] the incentive is not necessarily stopped thinking out,

[03:51] the incentive is to stop getting caught, right?

[03:52] It encourages criminal behavior.

[03:54] It encourages people to find new and ingenuitive ways

[03:57] to do the thing they want to do,

[03:58] which is their incentive, their plus side,

[04:00] and figure out a ways to avoid the downside.

[04:02] Here's what is kind of interesting about this.

[04:04] Is that with punishments in general,

[04:07] you get people to avoid the behavior,

[04:09] but you don't get to them necessarily to do what you want them to do.

[04:12] So if you want someone to do something,

[04:14] it's much easier to incentivize

[04:16] that if you do the thing, you get this, right?

[04:19] Because incentives direct behavior.

[04:22] Punishments for people to avoid anything

[04:24] that will give them the punishment.

[04:26] It's subtle, but hopefully you're picking up on it,

[04:27] putting down.

[04:28] The reason this is I think is very interesting

[04:30] is that when you look at, so Jim Collins wrote a lot

[04:32] of the best management books that are out there,

[04:33] and what's interesting if you if you follow his career,

[04:36] it seems like he's, he went from super super quantitative

[04:39] to more qualitative.

[04:40] Now he still did quantitative to arrive at his qualitative decisions,

[04:42] but he talks about how leadership is such an important part

[04:45] of building great businesses,

[04:46] and we know that great people build great companies, okay?

[04:49] And so we as entrepreneurs must be leaders

[04:52] and good people, so that we can attract good people,

[04:54] so we can build good companies.

[04:55] Now, big part of that is figuring out how to get people

[04:58] to do stuff.

[04:58] And so based on the research that he had that he presented,

[05:01] which I thought was really fascinating,

[05:02] is that over time, if you have negative reinforcement,

[05:05] performance to grades, right?

[05:07] It's always critical feedback, always critical feedback,

[05:09] always negative, only talk to somebody

[05:10] when they do something wrong.

[05:11] On the flip side, if you have positive feedback,

[05:13] by large majority of the time,

[05:15] performance improves, isn't that interesting?

[05:17] And so I saw that through this lens,

[05:20] which is we can direct people's behavior

[05:22] far more effectively with positive incentives,

[05:25] than we do with negative stuff,

[05:27] which has huge implications for the jail system

[05:30] and the punitive system and all that stuff,

[05:31] is like, people just find ways to avoid punishment,

[05:33] they don't necessarily do what people want them to do,

[05:35] because it's much, because punishment,

[05:37] people get the activity sprays in any direction

[05:40] that's just away from the thing,

[05:42] or as incentives directs it towards what you want.

[05:45] All right, and so we think about this

[05:47] within the context of vanishing people

[05:49] and giving them the do the things that we want them to do,

[05:51] then it makes more sense for us to add

[05:52] to think about an activity rather than a single outcome,

[05:56] into as many, many, many, many, many incremental substances

[05:58] we possibly can, and then incentivize those many steps.

[06:02] And the incentives don't necessarily need to be monitored.

[06:04] In fact, most times they don't need to be monetary.

[06:06] They need to be things that people can perceive

[06:07] as positive outcomes, which many times is just status

[06:10] and feedback, which is just great job.

[06:12] Awesome stuff.

[06:13] You did that thing yesterday and it was great.

[06:15] You just reinforce the things that they are doing

[06:17] that are good and we reinforce,

[06:19] and then now that they've realized

[06:21] that this one thing, not anything to avoid something,

[06:24] but I did this one thing, and I got this cookie.

[06:26] Well, I wouldn't do that one thing again,

[06:27] and they get another cookie, right?

[06:29] And we reinforce behavior.

[06:30] And so I like this process of thinking

[06:33] and Trevor and I talk about this a lot,

[06:35] because it gets around the hollow blue

[06:37] of trying to figure out what's going on inside of people's heads,

[06:40] and what we have instead are circumstances and the outcomes.

[06:44] And then we have our incentives

[06:45] and all of these things we can measure.

[06:47] We can say, I saw that this person,

[06:49] we were in the circumstance, which we can measure,

[06:51] we inserted this incentive,

[06:53] and then they did this outcome, yes or no, right?

[06:56] Whether they felt inspired, or whether they psychologically loved,

[07:00] we don't know, and we never will know

[07:01] because not everyone even knows how they're feeling,

[07:03] and whether they answer questions

[07:04] is not necessarily even true.

[07:06] We have no idea, but if we can just measure the conditions,

[07:08] then we can start directing behavior in the right ways.

[07:10] And so I thought this was a fascinating topic

[07:13] before getting others, and this applies to spouses,

[07:16] how do you supposed to do this stuff that you want them to do?

[07:18] It certainly doesn't come from nagging them all the time.

[07:20] All they're gonna do is try to avoid being net.

[07:22] Interesting, right?

[07:23] And so this gives you four boxes to look at,

[07:26] the these two boxes, you can't really see them, but it was.

[07:28] This one, this box over here, this guy, and this guy,

[07:31] those are things that you can't really direct people's behavior as much.

[07:33] Whereas this guy and this guy, you can direct people's behavior

[07:37] to the singular outcome that you're looking for

[07:38] and you continuously reinforce those behaviors such that.

[07:42] They start doing them without even thinking about it

[07:43] because it has been so reinforced, right?

[07:45] And so instead of trying to think,

[07:47] how do I, how do I have an amazing marriage?

[07:50] It's, how can I condition this person

[07:52] to stay married to me?

[07:53] Kind of interesting, little flip for you.

[07:55] So anyways, it's my imagination.

[07:56] This is the kind of stuff that I do get,

[07:57] got got on, and I think it's really interesting.

[07:59] I hope you enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed making this for you.

[08:02] This is how you get people to do shit.

[08:04] You can think about it in the Sims of Softside

[08:05] in terms of persuasion, but you can also think about it

[08:07] in terms of the hard side of what are the reinforcements

[08:10] that we're going to use either positive or negative

[08:12] and are we going to add positives?

[08:14] We're going to remove positives?

[08:15] We're going to add negatives?

[08:16] Are we going to remove negatives?

[08:17] So that we can accomplish what we want together.

[08:19] So lots of little positionation.

[08:21] Let me know if you like the stuff in the comments

[08:22] and keeping awesome, see you guys next video.

[08:24] Bye!

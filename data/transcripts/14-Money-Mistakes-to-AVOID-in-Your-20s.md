[00:00] There are 14 massive money mistakes that people make in their 20s that you do not want to repeat.

[00:05] And this is one of those don't buy an iPhone, buy an Android bullshit.

[00:08] Like if you make these mistakes early, you will have to pay for them for years.

[00:11] The good thing is that you can avoid them very easily.

[00:13] Number one, underspending on education and overspending on status.

[00:16] When you're in your 20s, you probably aren't balling.

[00:19] And the amount of people on Instagram I see with their checkmark that they bought in front of a lambo that they would ever like we all get it.

[00:24] Their full shit, we understand.

[00:25] The people who matter are not impressed.

[00:28] If I were a 200,000 dollar watch, all the buddies that I have don't give a shit.

[00:32] The guys who are ahead of you, they want to see you eating shit, living poor, learning and hustling.

[00:37] You drive around in your new roles or bends or whatever.

[00:40] Then you're matching out all of your expenditures so you can flex to other 20 year olds is stupid.

[00:45] Now you should take that same money and plow all of that into your own ability to earn more money.

[00:50] And that's what somebody who's ahead of you is going to look back and give you that status and respect for.

[00:53] Like you can get status in your 20s from people who are ahead of you if you're doing the right stuff.

[00:57] If you show that you're on the wrong path, they automatically think they're like he doesn't get it or she doesn't get it.

[01:02] They'll never associate with you until you understand the lesson.

[01:05] Number two, taking jobs to earn rather than to learn.

[01:08] And this is one of the biggest ones.

[01:09] We had a thousand people who applied for a YouTube editor.

[01:12] So for editing videos like this.

[01:13] So we offered somebody very good pay.

[01:15] And the guy said, I want an extra $3,000 a year.

[01:21] Missing the fucking plot.

[01:24] What he didn't understand was that he was in a season of learning, not a season of earnings.

[01:29] He might be able to go somewhere else and get 30%.

[01:31] Not even 3,000, 30% higher.

[01:33] The people who are going to pay that premium are paying the premium for everything you know and have nothing to add to you.

[01:39] If you're taking your jobs right now in order to earn, it's not the right season.

[01:43] You're trying to cash in early.

[01:44] The earning potential of you getting extra $10,000 a year or $25,000 a year in your 20s is so inconsequential

[01:51] on the long time horizon of the skills that you should be learning right now.

[01:54] 3 is that you save money.

[01:56] That is a mistake.

[01:57] Hear me out.

[01:58] You want to save money in your 20s, but not actually save it.

[02:01] You want to not spend it or blow it on shit.

[02:04] And you want to put it into a separate account.

[02:05] But that money you want to invest.

[02:07] Not a dollar cost averaging S&P or whatever it is.

[02:10] You can do that by all means.

[02:11] It's a great way to have some money later.

[02:13] But if you want to become filthy rich, which is hopefully what most nations here to do,

[02:16] you want to invest that money into you and your earning capacity.

[02:20] Right now, you make so little that the money doesn't matter.

[02:22] So if you save $500,000, $7,000 a month, you can put that into the calculator and look

[02:27] what it's going to be in 70 years.

[02:28] And like cool.

[02:29] One, it doesn't factor in inflation.

[02:31] So when people see that they're going to be worth $4 million dollars, $4 million dollars

[02:33] in 60 years is also worth like a million dollars today.

[02:36] Think about how much more you'll get back if you spend $10,000 this year and then you

[02:39] double your earning capacity.

[02:40] So you triple your earning capacity.

[02:42] Instead of saving money to invest in assets, invest in them more than asset, which is you

[02:47] and increasing your earning potential.

[02:48] 4.

[02:49] So much you're going to invest first before you spend money.

[02:52] Prioritization comes from taking, that's literally prior.

[02:54] It comes first, right?

[02:55] It's that you take the money off the top and you say this money has been prioritized for

[02:58] my learning, my education.

[03:00] And then whatever you have left, that you can spend.

[03:03] All that money, that account, you can let it stock pile up and then you see something that

[03:06] you want to learn and then deploy the capital.

[03:09] Not what do I have left at the end of the month?

[03:10] Can I afford it?

[03:11] You've got this big pile of gold over here that every month you plount to and then when you

[03:15] see the opportunity, you make the decision to pull a trigger.

[03:17] 5.

[03:18] So you want to make the investing and you want to manually spend it.

[03:22] You want to lubricate how easy it is for you to invest in yourself and you want to make

[03:25] it harder to spend on shit that never comes back to you.

[03:28] Dave Ramsey talks about people having cash rather than credit cards.

[03:30] You actually feel pain when you buy things and cash, but pretty using credit cards.

[03:33] The harder it is to buy something, the less you buy.

[03:37] Like the only one that even hits your account is the money that you're allowed to spend.

[03:39] The other money you've already allocated out to the other things.

[03:41] Like give your rent account maybe and then you've got your personal investing account

[03:44] SME.

[03:45] You've got your food and your car money, whatever.

[03:47] 6.

[03:48] So let's go shopping.

[03:49] Let's be real.

[03:50] You don't need another set of sneakers.

[03:51] The idea that someone says I'm going to go shopping like they have no agenda.

[03:54] It just means like I'm going to waste money today.

[03:57] Stick with the lists that you already have pre-approved in terms of your budget.

[04:00] This is my list.

[04:01] These are my groceries.

[04:02] This is whatever.

[04:03] And if it's not on the list you don't buy it.

[04:04] It's a very simple habit but it will pay dividends for the rest of your life.

[04:07] 7.

[04:08] Get Take Out Don't Cook Your Food Very Contrary I know.

[04:12] As soon as you make more than $15 an hour, it makes more sense for you to work that

[04:16] day.

[04:17] Get the takeout food and get the time back.

[04:19] It makes more sense financially.

[04:21] Most people can, like if you're not being a weirdo, you can eat out for 10 bucks ish

[04:25] meal.

[04:26] And you eat 12 twice a day is $20 a day, $600 a month.

[04:28] Maybe you can go to the grocery store and be 100 bucks a week.

[04:30] Versus $150 a week is the next $50 a week.

[04:33] Can you not make that up for the meal prep going to the grocery store, cutting cooking,

[04:37] cleaning, saving the pennies rather than investing in the mega millions which is you.

[04:40] 8.

[04:41] People live with the wrong people.

[04:42] They have terrible roommates who break things who are drinking, who are laid on

[04:46] rent like these are all things that will distract you from the thing you're trying to

[04:48] do.

[04:49] That's like level one worst type of roommate.

[04:50] A bug that you've got people who are responsible, etc but they don't want the same

[04:53] goals as you.

[04:54] They will speak over you they are limiting beliefs and they will oftentimes not actually

[04:59] root for you and they will kind of undercut you when you're on this path which is probably

[05:02] different than them and the thing is in the beginning what becomes successful looks like

[05:05] they're learning.

[05:06] You're not earning.

[05:07] They're already pulling their earning trigger.

[05:08] They're bragging on the fact that makes 70 grand a year.

[05:10] Whatever.

[05:11] You have a different goal and so never listen to people who have smaller goals for your life

[05:15] than you do.

[05:16] Making sure that you're living with a type of people who are trying to do the same thing

[05:19] as you are in your life will encourage one another and you guys are kind of like in the

[05:23] game together.

[05:24] That's what will shape the way you see the world.

[05:25] I do think it's worth living with multiple people in your 20s because one of your 20s

[05:28] can be lonely but two it's also just a lot cheaper.

[05:30] I live in a house with seven people in California and I was able to only pay 400 bucks

[05:33] a month in like a nice area.

[05:35] Which leads to number nine.

[05:37] Your micro community matters a lot.

[05:38] I would overpay for convenience in terms of being close to stuff close to the highway so I can

[05:43] get on and off and right to place that I need to close to a gym and close to a gym.

[05:45] Which you place is to eat.

[05:46] If I can do those things and ideally if I can walk to them I save time and gas.

[05:50] I get outside.

[05:51] If you live in the middle of nowhere and it takes you 25 minutes to get the gym and 25 minutes

[05:54] to go back there's all this time that gets eaten up.

[05:56] I'm willing to pay a premium to save all of the insolary costs it would go with living

[06:00] somewhere less convenient.

[06:01] Less safe.

[06:02] I live with more people in a better area than fewer people in a shit area.

[06:05] Number 10.

[06:06] Since you model the wrong season of life.

[06:07] Sometimes I'm going to go out and look at what I'm doing and they're like oh I'm going

[06:09] to do what else is doing.

[06:10] Things is like you don't have the track record and reputation is built on two things.

[06:12] It's built on what you've done and what you say you're going to do and having both

[06:15] of them come true.

[06:16] The thing that builds the reputation is not modeling what I'm doing now but modeling

[06:19] what I did before.

[06:20] You want to make sure that you model the right aspect of someone's life at the right

[06:23] time.

[06:24] Flying private doesn't make you rich.

[06:25] I mean you spend a lot of money.

[06:27] Seek what's matters.

[06:28] Number 11.

[06:29] Measure money in how long it took you to earn it.

[06:32] Let's see you make 20 bucks an hour.

[06:33] If you want to go buy a shirt for 100 bucks you have to think yourself okay I make $20

[06:38] an hour 20% payroll tax.

[06:39] I'm actually going to have to work six hours to buy that $100 shirt with tax whatever.

[06:44] So if someone said I want you to work all day and I'll give you the shirt what I do

[06:47] it probably not.

[06:48] I worked at smoothie game way as a 15 years old.

[06:51] $7.25 an hour.

[06:52] A six hour shift right.

[06:53] So I was making in 43 bucks.

[06:55] People would go next door.

[06:56] I remember noticing this and they would spend 15 bucks in lunch.

[06:58] I was like so you have $36 after tax for coming to work today and 15 of that is you going

[07:04] to lunch next door.

[07:05] So you're working six hours for 20 bucks.

[07:08] Number 12.

[07:09] Get competitive with money around what you're saving not what you're making.

[07:12] So I told you this is a season of learning not season or earning to know what you're going

[07:15] to learn.

[07:16] You have to budget towards your investment rather than thinking I'm making $5,000 a month

[07:20] and spending $5,000 a month, meaning I'm profiting personally zero.

[07:23] Say I'm saving $2,500 this month to invest in me.

[07:27] I've had people who I know have been making $100,000 and millions of dollars a year and have

[07:30] nothing.

[07:31] They blew everything.

[07:32] And so make your PR your personal records around what you're able to put into that

[07:36] bank account every month.

[07:37] Number 13.

[07:38] Check your account every single morning until I started doing it I stayed poor.

[07:42] I didn't want to look at my bank account because they would hurt my feelings seriously.

[07:44] I just I would look at it and I would just feel poor.

[07:46] But that's okay.

[07:47] You have to confront reality in order to change.

[07:49] Man, money's pouring out of this thing left and right.

[07:51] Once I got a pulse on it, I knew Tuesday's when I paid this Thursday's when I paid for this.

[07:55] It's a habit that once you learn it, it's hard to forget.

[07:58] And I promise you just like losing weight.

[08:00] If you get someone to measure the weight of your day, get someone to measure the bank

[08:02] count every day, it'll improve.

[08:03] Number 14.

[08:04] What is it okay to spend money?

[08:06] If there's one thing that I probably could have done better is I could have spent money on

[08:09] one time experiences.

[08:10] And what I mean by that is not going to the club and pop and bottles.

[08:13] Go to Europe and doing a you know sleeping in hospitals for three months.

[08:15] That's a cool experience that you're not going to be able to do in your 40.

[08:18] But you're just not going to do it.

[08:19] So there are times of our lives that are optimal for certain types of experiences in those

[08:23] windows closed.

[08:24] And so if there are experiences that you can only do in your 20s, I wholeheartedly support

[08:27] them but you want them to be things that when you're 80 you're proud of.

[08:30] Giving yourself permission to spend on an experience and a limited fashion you don't

[08:34] want to train your entire best for count.

[08:36] You want to go see the Grand Canyon for three days.

[08:38] Go out of the Grand Canyon.

[08:39] But there are some things that are little you need to you.

[08:41] I think these are the times that you can do that and it's worth spending the time in the

[08:44] money to do it.

[08:45] Even if it's not financially makes sense because at the end of the day you're going to die

[08:47] is not going to matter anyways.

## Full Transcript
[00:00] When I was 27, I had just over a million dollars in my bank account in cash.

[00:04] By the time I was 29, I had over 20.

[00:06] By the time I was 31, it was more than that.

[00:08] Here's how to get so rich you realize money was never the point.

[00:11] But first, you have to get rich.

[00:12] There's three strategies and the first one is building a brand.

[00:15] So the first time I saw the power of brand was when he released a new product to my existing distribution base of gyms,

[00:21] which was a software called ALN, which then later became ALN.

[00:24] There were a certain percentage of gyms in my distribution base who weren't able to attend the launch or see the web of our live.

[00:29] And what ended up happening was crazy.

[00:31] All of a sudden we started getting hours later, calls and tech saying,

[00:34] Hey, I heard that Alex offered something.

[00:36] Here's my credit card, just signed me up for whatever it is.

[00:39] And I was like, wait, they haven't seen the actual pitch.

[00:42] The realization was they just had a history of positive experiences when giving me money that they got more back.

[00:48] That they were like, oh, here's another time where I can give money and get more value back.

[00:52] Great.

[00:52] I'll utilize the opportunity.

[00:53] And so I was like, whoa, this is something different.

[00:57] I've never had this before.

[00:58] And so I was like, I need to protect this as much as you really possible.

[01:02] And is there ways that I can do even more of it?

[01:04] And so let me give you four visual examples of how branding even came to be.

[01:08] And so back in the day, you'd have bulls.

[01:10] Look at my beautiful bulls.

[01:12] Those bulls would originally be unmarked.

[01:15] And so people had no way of differentiating between their bulls and other people's bulls.

[01:18] They started branding literally, searing their own logo or whatever into the bull.

[01:24] And so let's say we've got our Nike bull here.

[01:27] Great.

[01:28] Now we recognize that as a logo.

[01:31] And we like that person.

[01:33] If we have that experience, then we're going to treat the cow differently than if it were unbranded.

[01:40] Now let's say that there's a brand that we don't recognize.

[01:43] We would then treat this bull like all other branded bulls in that it's a category that we just know that it belongs to someone else.

[01:50] The third scenario might be, let's say that it belongs to somebody that you hate.

[01:55] And so we have branding that you recognize and like, well, then you'd be nice to the count.

[02:00] Take it home.

[02:01] Branding that you recognize and hate, you might capture the cow, kill the cow and eat it for yourself or steal it.

[02:07] Branding of somebody you don't recognize, but know that in general, it belongs to someone which would then change your behavior.

[02:14] And then finally, a cow that was unbranded in general, and you treat it like you treat all cows that have no owner.

[02:20] And so the reason this is important is that fundamentally the point of branding is to change behavior of the person who sees it.

[02:26] All of this is an indication of past experience.

[02:28] It's saying, hey, treat me like you would treat me like you'd want to be treated.

[02:33] Treat that cow like you would want to be treated, which is exactly the point.

[02:36] No, but the owner is is communicating something to anybody else who sees the cow.

[02:41] That's the point.

[02:42] We want to brand our products so that they treat it ideally, like something that people like in love,

[02:49] which might mean that they buy it quickly at higher prices and over and over again and tell their friends versus not buy it.

[02:56] Tell people terrible things to sway their friends from buying it versus I don't know.

[03:01] Maybe I'll take a risk on this thing and then it's going to be the quality of the creative that's going to have to communicate.

[03:06] And this is again why if you had a really fancy brand and it looked high end,

[03:10] then they're just going to extrapolate what they know about high end brands in general to the purchase.

[03:15] Okay, this looks like a premium brand.

[03:16] I understand why they're doing these things, but I don't have history.

[03:19] Now, if you make the purchase and they have history, then it would shift into one of these two categories.

[03:23] In a word, Steve Jobs describes brand as trust.

[03:27] I define trust as predictive power based on past experiences.

[03:32] Just as much as you can trust someone to do a bad job, you can trust someone to do a good job.

[03:38] And so the idea here is obviously to build trust that we will deliver on our promises.

[03:42] And so fundamentally, you build that by making promises and keeping more over delivering on the promises you have.

[03:48] But brand is a big amorphous topic.

[03:50] And so how do you measure this in dollars and cents?

[03:52] And so there's basically three things that brand translates to in terms of economics for a business.

[03:58] And so the first is conversion rate.

[04:00] Now, what does that mean?

[04:03] So conversion rate is the percentage of people who when presented with your offer choose to buy it.

[04:08] And so let's say that you have a bad brand or no brand at all.

[04:12] A bad brand would be that you have a past history.

[04:15] People trust you to do bad stuff.

[04:16] You have lower than neutral.

[04:18] If you have no brand, it would be based on their experience with other businesses that look like yours.

[04:22] And so this is also why, quote, good branding.

[04:25] Even if you don't have a history of reinforcement, can still be important because if you walk

[04:32] talk and quack like somebody who is a scam artist, you will have people treat you like one.

[04:39] It's not just your experience, but their experience with people like you.

[04:43] Fundamentally like, this is what racism is about.

[04:45] But people pre-judge people because that's how we go through life.

[04:49] If we had to start at zero for every single person we met, we would use up all of the cognitive load that we have.

[04:54] And consumers like all humans try to use shorthand.

[04:57] We want to learn based on the things, put a label on it, put in a bucket and not think about it as fast as possible.

[05:02] And so from a conversion rate perspective, a good brand means that let's say neutral would be,

[05:07] let's say you close 20% of people who you get on the phone with at a specific price point.

[05:11] At negative, which actually get that, I'll just put up with zero here, negative one.

[05:15] And then positive, maybe, and this thing here is that this could go as high as you want.

[05:19] Like, if you have an unbelievable reputation, like plus plus plus, maybe you close 80%.

[05:25] And what's interesting about this is if you look, and maybe here it's zero percent because no one,

[05:30] everyone hates you.

[05:31] And you basically have to rely on people who don't know who you are.

[05:34] After I was wider and wider to find people who have yet to meet you, which is a terrible way to live.

[05:38] So, brand gives you an increased percentage of people who will buy one, present with your offer.

[05:43] Just like the guy who didn't even need to get presented with the offer, just knowing that I had an offer, he was willing to buy it.

[05:48] And the reason I use Apple as a great litmus test for this is that I think Steve Jobs is one of the best brand builders of all time.

[05:55] I mean, people lining up to buy whatever his next product was because of his past history of keeping his promises and over delivering on it.

[06:02] And so number one is conversion rate. This is like, if you had nothing else, this would be worth it.

[06:07] If you could forex, they mount a people that bought your stuff at a specific price. That would give you a material advantage over everyone else.

[06:14] But branding doesn't stop there in terms of its bid at business benefits.

[06:17] The second is CTR. Now it's like, okay, what does that really mean?

[06:20] So it's actually conversion rate again, but just earlier on in the funnel.

[06:24] And so let's say again, you have eyeballs. You've got people who see your promotions in whatever way you advertise.

[06:29] So that could be making content that could be outreach attempts, responding to emails.

[06:33] Basically, the number of engaged leads.

[06:35] Having a higher click the rate means people take the first action.

[06:38] They then convert on a landing page or a shop if I page or whatever.

[06:43] They're either buying a product or they're scheduling a call.

[06:45] And then on the call, they have a higher conversion rate as well.

[06:47] And so basically, you can think about this as conversion rate throughout the entire process.

[06:50] From the beginning to the money.

[06:52] And then obviously, if you continue to do a good job on resale's repurchase, etc.

[06:57] So let's say that generically, at negative one and then zero and then plus here you might have a 0.5% click the rate.

[07:05] And then here, maybe you have a 1% click the rate.

[07:07] And then maybe here you have something like a 3% click the rate.

[07:11] And this is super standard.

[07:12] Like this happens all the time, especially if you're going after markets that already know who you are.

[07:16] When I launched my leads book, we had never run ads before.

[07:21] And so this was all novel.

[07:22] And there was a past history of the first book.

[07:24] So the first book has I think like 26,000 five stars at the point of making this video.

[07:28] There was a lot of anticipation for the second book.

[07:30] And so the CTRs were like 6% for our ads.

[07:34] And so people were signing up for the book lunch for something like a dollar,

[07:38] which is crazy.

[07:39] And I'd never had anything like that before.

[07:40] Especially at scale.

[07:41] And sounds like man, these are some of the benefits of building trust with an audience.

[07:45] And so from the conversion perspective, if you think about those guys who bought at the

[07:49] ALN lunch, who weren't even presented the offer, they just found out that I had something

[07:53] to sell.

[07:54] Those are people who are otherwise in a neutral or negative business.

[07:56] Certainly wouldn't have purchased.

[07:57] They would have either needed to be convinced if they were neutral or they just would have

[08:00] not wanted to buy to begin with if they were at the negative side of the spectrum.

[08:03] That's how you can just demonstrate visually what the experience of having a higher conversion

[08:08] rate looks like.

[08:09] More people buy when they're presented with the offer.

[08:11] And I'll give you another really tactical example.

[08:13] My offer is book on Amazon, the actual page itself converts at 30%.

[08:18] So basically a little bit less than one out of three people who visits the page by

[08:22] his book.

[08:23] Now I think there's a variety of reasons for that.

[08:24] One of them is that many people who go there got referred via word of mouth, which

[08:28] will get to one of the big compounding things from that later.

[08:31] But the second thing is that even if you don't have word of mouth, when you have a 4.9

[08:35] rating and you've got 26,000 people who have rated it that, then you have high confidence

[08:39] that it's going to deliver at least a decent product.

[08:42] Now the third big brand benefit is price point.

[08:46] And so this is one that I think is probably more commonly touted.

[08:49] And Warren Buffett describes it like this.

[08:50] He says, if you have to say a prayer before you raise your prices by 10% you have a bad

[08:55] business.

[08:56] And so the idea is that if customers love your product, they will be more willing to pay

[09:00] a premium to get it.

[09:02] Rather, they are paying down the risk of buying somebody else's product.

[09:06] And so they buy your product with the existing promise.

[09:09] And then the extra is basically their insurance that they pay you knowing that they're

[09:13] going to get exactly what they expect.

[09:15] I can't overemphasize how important it is to pay down people's risk.

[09:22] Like risk is one of the three primary levers in terms of value creation.

[09:27] And so this is why McDonald's for example, even though they're product in and of itself

[09:31] it's not that good, it is consistent.

[09:33] And consistency in and of itself reduces risk.

[09:36] And people just like to have their expectations met.

[09:40] Now what's interesting about this is that to meet everyone's expectations, it means

[09:43] that you'll have to go really high because some people have high expectations, some people

[09:46] have medium, some people have low expectations.

[09:48] And so if you want to meet the expectations of a large percentage of the audience, you

[09:52] will have to try to over-deliver when the people who are the most demanding, you will simply

[09:56] have delivered.

[09:57] Now other people you will have over-delivered for.

[09:59] But I think this idea of like, you're always going to over-deliver.

[10:02] I don't think it's true.

[10:03] I think you just have to try as hard as you can.

[10:05] And a larger percentage of people will be satisfied.

[10:08] Now with this price in any competitive market, if you can raise price by, let's say this

[10:13] is your revenue and this is your profit before.

[10:16] So this is our neutral brand versus our plus plus brand.

[10:19] Okay.

[10:20] So let's say that they have the same base economics.

[10:23] So the cost of doing business is the same between these two businesses.

[10:27] But this business can simply charge 10% more.

[10:32] By doing that, they basically double the amount of profit that they're able to make as a

[10:38] result of their brand.

[10:39] There's one more point that makes brand make you even more money.

[10:44] And it just took me way too long to realize this because I got really good marketing and

[10:49] sales early and I came out of the perspective of like, I just need to go find more people.

[10:54] And it's so much more profitable to find the existing people that you have, they already

[10:58] have done business with and they want to continue doing business with you.

[11:02] And so I solve now for how do I get people to always want to do business with me again,

[11:06] rather than how do I find more people?

[11:08] And so the fourth piece is, repurchases.

[11:12] And so just like Apple, like I was mentioning earlier, they have such an amazing system

[11:16] of getting people into their ecosystem and then buying again and again.

[11:20] And again, it would take a tremendous amount of effort to get someone to reconnect all

[11:23] of the products they own, their phone, their computer, their music, whatever their app

[11:27] stores from their existing ecosystem of digital hardware.

[11:30] And so the fourth benefit is that not only do you get more people to respond, more people

[11:35] to convert at higher prices so you can make more profit, that profit then gets multiplied.

[11:41] So if we have our neutral example, let's put, I'm going to have to put the other one over

[11:44] here.

[11:45] Now we already have a higher price point.

[11:47] So we're already making more money than this guy.

[11:49] But not only that, the next year, some of these people might buy again, what do you know?

[11:54] Now our cost basis is going to go up because obviously they're buying something else, right?

[12:00] But so is our absolute profit.

[12:02] Uncle Warren, for example, every single year for she's candies has raised the prices and

[12:07] that's typically in accordance with costs of cocoa and butter and the commodities that

[12:12] actually create the product.

[12:13] But he has, I think, on average, and I'll have to look this up again.

[12:16] But I'm pretty sure on average, like some of the highest years were 17% increases.

[12:19] And that's like you were over year.

[12:21] But his average was much higher than the price index increases.

[12:25] And so basically he was able to continue to see that once someone bought their chocolates,

[12:30] they would continue to buy them over and over again, even with a higher price.

[12:34] Which then leads to, okay, from a repurchase perspective, keep and said this, he said,

[12:39] if you buy your darling, seize candies for Valentine's Day or the her birthday or what

[12:45] ever.

[12:46] And you guys enjoy them together.

[12:48] He said, we've got you for life.

[12:50] And the point there is that they've now cost, they spent the money to acquire you one time.

[12:55] But then after that, you keep buying again and again and again and again and that extends

[12:59] the LTV of the person.

[13:00] So you're getting more people interested who are then going to buy at higher prices.

[13:06] So there's even more gross profit per unit and they're going to buy again and again and

[13:09] again.

[13:10] I can hardly imagine something that would be more powerful for a business.

[13:13] There's a concept of the gift to ask ratio and I talk about it here in my leads book

[13:16] in the content chapter.

[13:18] And the reason that this is such an important metric is basically this is a history of reinforcement.

[13:24] How many times have you reinforced positively before you ask for something?

[13:28] But this is the part that people miss.

[13:29] And this because most people with products aren't that good.

[13:32] They're asked in their mind is perceived as a negative and the give is obviously perceived as

[13:36] as positive.

[13:37] And so you make this media, you give out this free stuff that gives you more and more

[13:40] pluses.

[13:41] Some people like to think about it like a bank account, you add more deposits and then

[13:44] you can withdraw.

[13:45] But when listening to jobs talk about this, he actually purely talks about it from an

[13:49] asks perspective.

[13:50] He says if people buy our product and they absolutely love it, then we have provided more

[13:54] value.

[13:55] We put a deposit into our relationship.

[13:57] He said if people buy our product and they hated it or just mediocre, then we've

[14:00] withdrawn from that relationship.

[14:02] This whole idea of give asked many people talk about this in terms of content and then monetization.

[14:08] But it actually extends all the way through the business.

[14:10] And in the perfect world, you give in the content and when you ask for money, it becomes

[14:17] a give because as soon as they buy the product, they're like, oh my god, this is amazing.

[14:21] Which is why for example, I think that like I try to get people to start with the books

[14:25] because it's the thing that I've spent the most time on.

[14:27] And cost relative to value is pretty insane.

[14:31] That allows me to give yet again and create a positive history of reinforcement with

[14:35] an audience.

[14:36] Brands compound over time, not because necessarily media compounds, but media is just

[14:42] a measurement tool for a word of mouth because your audience will grow because people

[14:47] will share your stuff.

[14:48] Like try and get it down to the people when analyzing these kind of like amorphous ideas.

[14:51] Like what happens when a brand grows?

[14:53] It means you did a good thing and then that person tells another person and then that person

[14:57] experiences the benefit themselves and then that person tells another person.

[15:00] And so the output of the brand is the trust with an audience that grows rather than

[15:05] logos and color schemes and fonts like it's none of that.

[15:09] It's just how many people trust me.

[15:12] But the reality of building a brand is that it's kind of like a friendship.

[15:15] Imagine meeting somebody and being like, we're past friends.

[15:18] But they said that the first time you met and be like, that's a bit weird.

[15:21] And so building a brand is a lot the same thing.

[15:22] It takes time to build trust and trust is predictive power based on a past history of

[15:27] experience.

[15:28] And so you have to develop that past history of experience.

[15:31] If somebody did something nice one time for you, you're not immediately going to be like,

[15:33] oh, I trust this guy with my life.

[15:35] That's a quite good one thing.

[15:36] But if you does thing after thing after thing after thing after thing, after thing, after

[15:38] thing, for an extended period and then makes an ask, you're like, well, I kind of owe him

[15:42] money.

[15:43] He's done a bunch of stuff for me.

[15:44] And so that's the idea is that it just takes a long time.

[15:46] Now, here's where there is high arbitrage with brand.

[15:49] With media and technology, one person can give to a million people at once in a very

[15:54] small way.

[15:55] And so the idea is, okay, how can I give to a million people at once over and over and even

[16:00] an fractionalized manner such that in 10 gives or 20 gives or 50 gives, I've now given

[16:06] effectively three full gifts or four full gifts to somebody so that they might be willing

[16:11] to put return the favor based on their cultural rules.

[16:14] And so in those four ways, building the brand makes you so much money that you have the

[16:20] first step taken towards realizing it wasn't the point to begin with.

[16:24] The second way to get so rich, that you realize that making money was never the point,

[16:27] is to know the inputs and outputs of your money making system.

[16:31] And you want to break those down to the absolute smallest action.

[16:34] That way, you can scale it while sustaining your margins.

[16:37] So whenever Lail and I get overwhelmed, right?

[16:40] Because it happens all the time.

[16:41] You basically clear your play it and you add more stuff to your play it and then you're like,

[16:44] oh man, I'm overwhelmed and you clear your play to you.

[16:45] And that's, honestly, I think a lot of that is just like entrepreneurship.

[16:48] When we look at our plate, what we do is I look at every single activity that I'm doing

[16:52] on a weekly basis and I say, how does that tie to how we make money?

[16:56] It's trying to understand what are the inputs that I'm pushing into our money making

[17:00] system and are there things on here that are either too indirect or just not actually

[17:06] driving anything at all.

[17:08] And so for example, I took over a department recently and I canceled all meetings that were

[17:14] recurring where people were just sharing data.

[17:16] And the main reason was that that data was not being used to change behavior.

[17:22] And so either the data is not correct or useful or we need to learn how to do something

[17:28] about that data.

[17:30] And so if we spend all this time going over data and doing nothing about it, then that time

[17:35] is completely wasted.

[17:37] Both in the collection, storing and analysis of data, but then also the reviewing it with

[17:42] a team of people.

[17:43] And so unless something changes what we do, we don't need to track it.

[17:48] And so this gets you much more targeted on the few things that matter.

[17:52] So Shoran Sivat Sizou is a public CEO, you know, I talked about this at length.

[17:55] He basically posits that for every company, it's one tenth of the employees that are

[18:01] actually creating the majority of the economics and the business.

[18:04] Like there's a core team that really is the one that moves the whole machine and a lot

[18:07] of the rest of the people are there more or less for the ride.

[18:10] And the idea is, what is it that those ten people do?

[18:13] What are their inputs that drive this machine?

[18:15] And I think that being able to identify what those activities are, not the general

[18:22] more-fist words, but what the actual activities are, like, is it writing an email?

[18:26] Is it writing ad copy?

[18:27] Is it filming content or filming ads?

[18:30] Is it reaching out to certain amount of people?

[18:32] Is it reaching out to customers?

[18:33] Is it hopping on a certain amount of calls, sales calls?

[18:36] Like all of these are activities that will drive revenue in the business.

[18:39] You basically look at a lot of other stuff that many people feel their counters with,

[18:43] and the majority of it doesn't make money.

[18:46] And if the point of a business is to generate a profit through providing value to a marketplace

[18:50] outside of the cost of delivering that value, then you want to put as much into the value

[18:55] creation as possible as it's little into the cost-based as responsible and do it as many

[18:59] times as you can.

[19:00] And everything that's not those things ultimately detract from the efficiency of the system.

[19:04] And so think about it like this.

[19:06] You have a money-making system.

[19:07] You have a box.

[19:08] Now in that box is your general activities of doing business.

[19:11] So you sell tables.

[19:13] You sell books.

[19:14] You provide services.

[19:15] Whatever your thing is, as you have a cost of delivering that thing and you have a price

[19:19] that should be above that cost.

[19:21] And then that discrepancy between those two things is how you make money.

[19:24] And you spend that wheel as many times as you can.

[19:26] Where this gets important is you have to understand the inputs into the system.

[19:30] And you have to break it down to activities.

[19:32] Like I can't explain to you how incredibly powerful this is to both understand this for yourself

[19:38] and explain it to your team and be able to revisit it on a regular basis because the

[19:42] inputs will change.

[19:43] And so for example, if I were to say, hey Alex, what do you do?

[19:48] What are the inputs in the acquisition.com when you make system?

[19:51] There's many things that occur in acquisition.com.

[19:54] But you as the founder of the entrepreneur, you're basically pushing the first domino over

[19:59] and then there's many subsequent activities that happen after.

[20:01] And sometimes there's two or three dominoes that are occurring that you're pushing.

[20:04] But what happens is when we describe what we do, we use lots of amorphous words that

[20:07] have very little connection to what we actually do.

[20:09] For me, for example, like what are the things that I actually do?

[20:12] My inputs for acquisition.com, right?

[20:15] So let's say the acquisition.

[20:16] Let's say if I can spell my own company.

[20:18] There we go.

[20:19] Acquisition.com.

[20:20] There we go.

[20:22] .com.

[20:23] Oh, God, no, it's foggy.

[20:24] There we go.

[20:25] There we go.

[20:26] Nice, nice, clean sea there for everybody to see.

[20:29] All right.

[20:30] So I script stuffed.

[20:31] Okay, cool.

[20:32] I record.

[20:34] That's something that I do.

[20:35] I check in on status of stuff.

[20:39] I review things and give thumbs up or feedback.

[20:42] I review deal metrics for deals that we're considering doing in acu.com or acu ventures,

[20:50] which is our ventro.

[20:51] I'm going to start it.

[20:52] I present to the team when we have kind of like new direction that we're taking.

[20:56] I also review hort co metrics and decide where the money goes.

[21:03] With an acquisition.com and then within the portfolio companies.

[21:06] When I say money, I say generically like the resources that we have.

[21:09] So we're going to allocate this person here, we're going to allocate these resources here.

[21:13] And so this is like what it actually is and this is today.

[21:16] Now these things shuffle over time, but you can notice here that these are me describing actual

[21:20] activities, right?

[21:21] So what you need to do is now if I'm going to look at this, there's going to be some

[21:24] things that feed this machine and then there are going to be some things that are me

[21:28] actually doing the stuff in machine.

[21:30] And so this, for example, these are feeders.

[21:33] This stuff feeds in.

[21:34] This is me providing feedback, me driving stuff.

[21:38] These are all for feeding this machine.

[21:40] Is how do we get more attention?

[21:41] How do we get more business owners to know about our stuff?

[21:44] How do they, you know, they can buy our books so they can learn to trust us.

[21:46] And then eventually, you know, maybe there's a deal down the line.

[21:49] Big picture, we've got these feeders that feed into this machine.

[21:53] And then we kind of have what I would consider.

[21:54] These are all the things of delivery, right?

[21:56] These are how the actual machine works and makes money.

[21:59] The reason that defining the inputs is so important is that many times when you look

[22:02] at where you actually do, you aren't doing things that drive an increase in number of

[22:08] customers or an increase in LTV.

[22:11] And so if you think about this, like this is the LTV, this is the number of customers.

[22:16] And you can basically drive growth in only those two ways.

[22:20] And so you have to dial in what is actually the thing that makes money here.

[22:25] And when you ever have a deadline, for example, all of a sudden your ability to focus

[22:28] gets really clear.

[22:30] And I think the reason for that is because you have no time to waste.

[22:32] And so most people do like, spend like 90% of their time on stuff that doesn't actually

[22:36] drive the needle.

[22:37] And then only 10% of the stuff when they actually need to make money, that does it.

[22:41] But what would happen if you actually spend all of your time on the inputs that mattered

[22:44] most?

[22:45] For example, I write 2 emails a week for the Muzzy Minute, which is what I send to the whole list,

[22:50] which is kind of like very tactical business concepts.

[22:52] It's very high leverage for me.

[22:54] It takes me about an hour-ish per email that I send.

[22:57] And that is something that drives, awareness, it drives business, it drives value, it drives

[23:01] portfolio companies, it drives everything.

[23:03] And so that's an input.

[23:05] And so it's betting very clear on most of the things that people do that are just not that.

[23:10] And so whenever you scale an input or like the inputs that you have in terms of your money

[23:14] making system or the inputs of what you do in order to feed that system, you essentially

[23:18] have three options for scaling.

[23:21] Option number one is you can automate.

[23:22] So you can get a machine to do it.

[23:24] All right.

[23:25] Now, some things are very difficult to automate.

[23:26] So I think that the AI is can automate a lot.

[23:28] Sometime in the future, there will be an AI version of me that can probably make content

[23:31] better than I can.

[23:33] And we'll cross that bridge when we get there.

[23:35] But that would be something that could happen.

[23:36] The second is that you get other people.

[23:39] So that means that I'm having somebody else then make this content for me.

[23:43] Now, there's, I want to be very clear, there's degrees here.

[23:46] A lot of people like to think in binaries.

[23:48] It's like, okay, well, can I get somebody else to script this stuff?

[23:50] Can I get someone else to check in?

[23:51] Can I get someone else to record reviewing your feedbacks?

[23:54] And then the only thing that I would have to do is record.

[23:56] Yes, of course I could.

[23:57] And so the idea is you don't necessarily need to replace every single part of what you do.

[24:01] But you can just basically chunk down the inputs into, okay, this one, someone else can handle.

[24:04] This one, someone else can handle.

[24:05] And then the final component of this is that you can do one to many.

[24:10] Now, what does that mean?

[24:11] If like, this is already a very leveraged acquisition system, right?

[24:15] Because it's me wanting to many, you're watching this.

[24:18] It takes me one time to say it, but many people can see it.

[24:20] But if you had a 101 method of reaching out to people, say,

[24:23] hold out bound as your way of getting people in,

[24:25] or maybe you get affiliates 101, then you're either going to have to automate that way of getting affiliates 101.

[24:31] You're going to have to get a team of people to do it.

[24:33] Or you're going to have to switch to a mechanism that allows you to continue to do it,

[24:36] but do it to many people at once.

[24:38] And so I think through this whenever I have to kind of scale any kind of delivery or marketing is,

[24:43] is this something that I can get other people to do?

[24:45] And this also works on the backend, right here.

[24:47] So it's like, okay, can I get other people to review,

[24:49] portfolio metrics, can I get other people to decide where the allocation is?

[24:52] Again, these things are very high leverage for me,

[24:55] meaning I don't have to put a lot to get a lot from it.

[24:57] And so it's worth me developing that skill set even deeper rather than potentially delegating it.

[25:02] But long term, in my opinion, every business can be delegated.

[25:05] It's just that you have to find stars.

[25:07] And you have to find people who are better than you, and oftentimes that's tough.

[25:11] Like, could Steve Jobs delegate big Steve Jobs?

[25:13] Well, I don't know.

[25:15] I mean, they have yet to really make anything as good as what he made.

[25:17] You know, if Elon died, would all of the companies do as well without him.

[25:21] I don't know.

[25:21] That's where it's like, okay, he has to automate or get other people.

[25:24] As many people as he can to do all the other stuff.

[25:27] And the stuff that matters most to him, like for example, he says,

[25:29] all my companies have zero marketing.

[25:31] Except for the fact that they have the most popular men like in history,

[25:36] being the person who's running them.

[25:37] And when I say popular, I just mean it from an absolute perspective, people know who he is.

[25:41] When he makes a tweet, a gazillion people see it.

[25:44] And so if we were, we probably could add this up and see what his total impressions are per month.

[25:48] Both directly on X and then also in terms of shared volume of the amount of pages that share

[25:53] his interviews and the rogue and stuff and YouTube.

[25:56] And so like, there's no marketing department because they have a one-man marketing department that

[26:01] in and of itself is worth, I mean, billions of dollars.

[26:05] And so I see everybody as an individual contributor at the most basic level.

[26:10] Like, everyone does things.

[26:12] And they are just either directly tied to some sort of outcome that gets customers or makes them

[26:18] worth more or they are not.

[26:20] And so I would encourage you, this is especially for this is me talking specifically to business owners

[26:24] right now.

[26:25] So there's three questions that I like to ask you to employ.

[26:28] Number one, what do you do?

[26:32] And they will use a more-fist terms.

[26:33] And you're like, no, no, no, like, not analyze.

[26:35] What do you do?

[26:36] What does that mean?

[26:37] And so they can define it in a way that like, okay, you look at numbers on an Excel sheet

[26:42] and you try and then you see if some are above a certain threshold or below it.

[26:47] Okay, got it.

[26:48] So that's what you do.

[26:49] Now, do you know what I do or what we do is a business.

[26:54] Now a lot of times people can't even explain it back to you and they work for you.

[26:56] So if they certainly can't explain it to you, they're definitely not doing something

[26:59] necessarily going to help it.

[27:00] All right, what do we do?

[27:04] And then here's the third question.

[27:06] How does what you do help what we do?

[27:08] And it ties what they do to the outputs of the business.

[27:11] And so fundamentally, let's say that someone says, I am in finance.

[27:16] Okay, cool, what do you do?

[27:18] I compile and tabulate our expenses versus what we generate and when something looks above

[27:25] benchmark or above our historic average, I flag it to make sure that it is worth spending

[27:30] money on.

[27:31] And if we do well in a business line, I flag it to see what we did better.

[27:35] And if we do poorly, I flag it to see why we did worse.

[27:37] And so that is what you produce.

[27:39] Now I would then say, how does what that does influence this and this?

[27:45] Now the intelligent finance person would then say, I influenced the decisions about

[27:51] what we spend to get more customers and how we make them worth more through doing more

[27:56] of the things that increase value and taking away things that add to costs.

[28:00] And that would be a very real answer as to tying their inputs into the outputs of the system.

[28:07] And so you have to be able to dial these things in.

[28:09] First you connect your actions to what makes a business money.

[28:13] And then scaling those actions through automation other people or gaining leverage on that

[28:17] activity.

[28:18] I'll give you three major money sucks that people do that are not this.

[28:22] So number one is they will work on projects that are not going to drive the main objectives.

[28:26] So it's like they want to reorganize a sauna in some way, right?

[28:29] Or whatever your project management thing is okay, we have this massive reorganization

[28:32] fine.

[28:33] Okay, great.

[28:34] Now it's taken up a lot of time.

[28:35] Or you redo your entire website, which takes you a ton of time.

[28:38] But is it really the constraint of the business?

[28:39] Is it the thing that's going to generate money?

[28:41] Or you should just split test your headlines on your landing page, right?

[28:44] Like there are other things that will drive more customers.

[28:47] And so basically like I can give you a list of a thousand things that you could do to

[28:52] grow a business.

[28:53] The question is which one of them will grow it the most?

[28:56] And so most people spend time on activities that they enjoy that drive very little business

[29:01] to the business, but they can mentally masturbate to the idea that they're being productive

[29:05] because it's business is related to business.

[29:09] And so it's like it's almost like they're doing like arts and crafts and hobbies

[29:12] while they're doing business.

[29:13] But those aren't the main drivers.

[29:15] The second thing is that they spend too much time on meetings.

[29:18] And this is a really common one, which is that people are social, people like to talk to

[29:22] each other.

[29:23] And so if they get an excuse to do it, they will do it.

[29:25] One of the most frightening things in the entire world, which I recommend you do, is actually

[29:28] look at how much everyone makes per hour, so look at their annual pay divided by 2000.

[29:32] And then look at a meeting when you have 10 people on it.

[29:36] And then I've all of a sudden you're like, I paid $500 for this meeting.

[29:41] And if you went out to dinner and took everybody to dinner and then you paid $500 for dinner,

[29:44] people like, oh my god, thank you so much.

[29:46] It's a generous of you.

[29:47] It's like every meeting is that.

[29:48] And so unless you can show how this is going to generate us $500 plus no mind you, you

[29:53] need to get a return on that.

[29:54] So you probably need to get something like four or five times that amount of money from

[29:58] that meeting.

[29:59] Then you probably just shouldn't have it.

[30:01] And where this gets really, really nasty is, once your business gets big enough,

[30:05] employees in general start meeting with each other.

[30:07] And so it's like you're not even involved.

[30:09] And these losses are occurring on a regular basis.

[30:12] Sometimes people call it time theft.

[30:13] I don't think the intentions there, but I do think that the end result is still the

[30:17] same, which is that the business becomes less efficient and bears more cost to deliver

[30:20] the same product.

[30:21] The third big kind of like hole that I see a lot of times is people who spend an

[30:26] in-order-in-a- amount of time on data that doesn't change what they do.

[30:30] So I'll give you an example.

[30:31] I could track what the temperature is of every room that I walk into.

[30:35] I could track the amount of words that I say on a meeting.

[30:38] You could track anything, right?

[30:40] Some people, especially swampers, so on and sometimes even on your team, will just love

[30:43] to show you all these excel sheets of all this data that they've tracked.

[30:47] It takes a huge amount of time and they get all these percentages and all these ratios.

[30:51] And then you just have to ask the question, why should I care about this?

[30:55] How does this change what we do?

[30:57] And I asked this question over and over and over again because so many people love to be

[31:00] like, oh no, we're data-driven.

[31:01] It's like, are you data-driven or are you data-destracted?

[31:05] And this is the limit test.

[31:06] It's the very easy limit test.

[31:08] If this number goes up, does it change what we do?

[31:11] If this number goes down, does it change what we do?

[31:13] If this number changing, doesn't change what we do, we don't need to track it.

[31:17] When you ask that question over and over again, because people are like, well, we want

[31:20] to keep an eye on that.

[31:21] I'm like, why?

[31:22] Let's take it to the natural strength.

[31:23] Why?

[31:24] The world is increasingly quantified and being able to with automation and software and wearables,

[31:30] like there's so much technology out there that wants to quantify everything because they

[31:33] know that people have an obsession with data.

[31:35] But not on data's useful.

[31:38] And so most businesses, you can figure out the metrics on the back of an app yet and if

[31:41] you got a few like it or not.

[31:43] That back of an app yet in way of running a business, in my opinion, is an exercise and thought

[31:47] discipline of the entrepreneur.

[31:48] If you know the clear inputs that drive the business, which for you might just be, I have

[31:53] to script, record, and edit content.

[31:56] It could be, I've to script, record, and edit ads.

[31:59] It could be, I have to do a certain amount of hourage attempts or manage a team to hold

[32:03] them accountable to doing these hourage attempts.

[32:05] Like, there are certain number of things that actually drive the business.

[32:08] If the data that you collect does not change what you do with your inputs, then you don't

[32:13] need to track it.

[32:15] You can reverse engineer this to figuring out first, what are the inputs that actually

[32:18] drive the output?

[32:19] And then, secondarily, what data would change how I do these inputs?

[32:24] If you find out that the CXR dropped on your ads, then you would probably change your

[32:27] hooks.

[32:28] That would change what you do, so it makes sense to track that.

[32:31] If like, number of tags on a social platform, you could track it.

[32:36] Let's say it goes up in general over a month.

[32:39] What are you going to do?

[32:40] Now you might say, well, I'll make more of the content in me that month, but if you made

[32:43] a variety of different pieces of content, would you then have to track a dealings if there

[32:46] was a spike?

[32:47] Okay, I got more tags in this.

[32:48] Okay, okay, wait, stay with me.

[32:51] How does getting more tags translate into us making more money?

[32:55] I can show you a number of people who get lots of tags and lots of likes and lots of

[32:59] views that don't make more money.

[33:00] And so again, it's not only like maybe it tracks to what we would do, but does does that

[33:06] track to us making more money?

[33:07] If you want to get so rich that you question the meaning of making money, then the first

[33:13] thing you can do is make sure that all of the work that you do makes you more money.

[33:17] And stop spending time on things that make you nothing, although they are fun distractions.

[33:23] Which leads me to the third way of getting so rich that you realize that making money was

[33:28] over the point, which is get other people to advertise for you.

[33:31] I remember the first time I ever had someone else sell for me.

[33:38] So I had to go home for Christmas.

[33:40] This was the first year of owning my gym and had to go home for Christmas.

[33:42] I went home for Christmas.

[33:44] And this is why I was still going home for the holidays.

[33:46] I remember I was driving home and I got a call and I had hired this sales gal and

[33:53] I had taught her my script and we were still running ads even though I was the one selling.

[33:57] And I had, I was the one who had done every single sale since the beginning of the business.

[34:01] She sent me a text that was like, oh, I went to for four.

[34:04] And I remember I got so emotional in the car while I was driving that I felt like I almost

[34:09] had just like pull over.

[34:11] Because I got choked up because I was like, oh my god, this could actually work without

[34:17] me.

[34:18] And it was like the first time where I realized that this could actually be a thing.

[34:22] It's not just like Alex working really hard and I have to make the money if no one

[34:27] else makes the money.

[34:29] It transitioned.

[34:30] It was the first leading indicator of transitioning from a job to an asset.

[34:34] Once I had that loop, I got really addicted to it.

[34:36] I was like, man, I wonder if there are people who could train without me training.

[34:39] I wonder if there are people who like, and I just looked at all the things that I did.

[34:41] And that that obsession has not really ended since then.

[34:44] You have to get other people to advertise for you in order to have more leverage.

[34:50] Okay.

[34:51] So leverages about getting more for what you put in and fundamentally, like in my opinion,

[34:54] all of entrepreneurship is mastering leverage.

[34:55] It's why it's core to our logo for acquisition.com.

[34:58] This is a full-crow.

[35:00] And because all of us have the same inputs at the base level, which is time.

[35:03] And so the people get the most for the time.

[35:05] The ones who get the most money for their time by doing activities that generate most revenue

[35:09] per minute or second.

[35:10] Imagine I had to just get customers.

[35:13] What some point I would max out the amount of hours per day that I could spend doing.

[35:18] No matter how efficient I get, I'm going to have to trade time to get it.

[35:22] If I'm doing on an inputs outputs that are directly correlated, one to one ratio, I can do

[35:26] the ratio faster, but I'm still going to have that connection.

[35:29] I can be a more efficient intro is getting better at that skill.

[35:31] But as long as the base metric is still there, I will be kept based on hours per day.

[35:35] So walk you through four levels of this and I talk about this in my lead book, which is

[35:39] second half, which is talking about lead getters.

[35:42] So I'll draw this out in real time for you, so you can actually get a voice over on it.

[35:46] So basically, at the very beginning, imagine that you are getting leads for your business.

[35:51] So this is just you.

[35:54] And so let's say you get 100 leads a day that you're calling or you're reaching out to

[35:58] or whatever.

[35:59] Now you can do this.

[36:00] Now your work's going to be high and your throughput's going to be fixed.

[36:02] There's nothing more you can do to it.

[36:04] Right?

[36:05] Now the next level here is that you do this thing, but then instead of getting leads, you

[36:11] get a lead getter, meaning you get other people to advertise on your behalf.

[36:16] And so functionally, instead of getting like you reach out to 100 people, you then get

[36:21] someone else, here's someone who's not you.

[36:23] Ta-da.

[36:24] Let's make it smiley.

[36:25] There you go.

[36:26] He's smiling.

[36:27] He's very happy to make you money.

[36:28] So now spends their time getting you leads.

[36:33] Okay, so we just had to do this once and then this created this node, how I like to think

[36:39] about it, of lead generation.

[36:42] Right?

[36:43] And so boom, this one day created this node ongoing.

[36:46] So who's more efficient?

[36:47] The guy who just continues to work here or the guy who works gets one person and then

[36:52] that person works on their behalf and doesn't even have to do this.

[36:55] He still gets the same output.

[36:56] All right, you sticking with me, like look at our return here.

[36:59] Return was 100 versus 300 in terms of units of effort versus return, but here we're

[37:05] getting way more.

[37:06] Every single month this guy does more.

[37:08] We still keep getting a higher return on this initial base.

[37:10] Now let's say that the next month you do this and you get another guy.

[37:17] Right?

[37:18] And this guy gets you more leads.

[37:21] So now you're working the same amount you were before, but now we've tripled the amount,

[37:27] well here we've doubled it because you're getting lead getters first, but the third

[37:30] day you would have tripled it, right?

[37:31] You keep getting more leads via these other people that you've been attracting.

[37:37] And so there are different types of lead getters that you can bring into a business.

[37:41] You can bring employees into a business.

[37:43] So imagine I recruit somebody and then I pay them to help me make content.

[37:47] I recruit somebody.

[37:48] I pay them to help me make media, right?

[37:50] Of course.

[37:51] The alternative is that you can go recruit an agency who does this work on your behalf.

[37:55] And the only real difference there is just the nature of the pay relationship, but it

[37:58] more or less works the same way.

[37:59] Now I will say this.

[38:02] The business is that it grow the fastest.

[38:04] Well typically have two different types of lead getters.

[38:06] They will have the lead getters that come naturally from their existing advertising activities.

[38:11] And so you let's say are continuing to advertise to get customers.

[38:14] But these customers now become lead getters on your behalf.

[38:18] They then are the ones who are bringing more people into your world.

[38:22] And that is what will end up compounded because over time in order to have a compounding

[38:26] business is what you need in order to get a really big business.

[38:29] You can't scale media indefinitely.

[38:32] Like at some point like you will get such diminishing returns that it won't make sense anymore.

[38:36] You have to eventually rely on word of mouth.

[38:39] Mind you, this is if you want to get super rich.

[38:41] If you want to just get medium rich like you can make $10 million just knowing how to

[38:45] market in sell and just find people who don't know who you are.

[38:47] You can absolutely do that.

[38:49] But I'm trying to talk about getting mega rich.

[38:51] And so you have to get leverage over basically lots of other people in a decentralized manner.

[38:56] All right.

[38:57] So if you get employees or you get agencies those are centralized.

[39:00] Those are people you have direct relationships with.

[39:01] You have to scale that those relationships.

[39:04] Whereas if you have affiliates which are other businesses that basically operate independently

[39:10] that have your customers and then send you business or customers that operate independently

[39:15] and then bring you more business that decentralizes the activities so that they continue

[39:20] to advertise on your behalf far beyond your ability to manage them.

[39:24] And this is really setting up a system of incentives such that they want to do it without

[39:30] your prodding poking and well, I guess prodding and poking.

[39:33] I don't know why you're poking your customers.

[39:35] We're doing so.

[39:36] A big visual here is that you've got customers of affiliates and employees agencies.

[39:41] And so these are businesses, these are individuals.

[39:43] These tend to be more centralized.

[39:45] These tend to be more decentralized.

[39:47] And the reason this is so important is that like if you think about how this flow works,

[39:51] that's like you're going to do the core four and these are the inputs that we're just referencing.

[39:57] These are the inputs and then these are the outputs of those inputs.

[39:59] You're going to get employees you're going to have your, get customers you're going to have

[40:01] your, get affiliates or business owners who are going to promote to their audiences.

[40:04] Right?

[40:05] So you tell other people about your stuff and then other people use the core four to do it

[40:09] on your behalf.

[40:10] So the more times you can spin this wheel, the more customers you're ultimately

[40:14] get in a decentralized manner.

[40:16] And if you want to get like if no one shared the content that we have, it would be very

[40:21] difficult to grow up right now.

[40:22] I would have to go one on one and you can do that.

[40:24] It's just tough.

[40:25] Right now the people who don't understand social media, so like sometimes you've seen like

[40:29] these old school business guys like who you're just like haven't realized like the world

[40:32] moved on, I see them all the time.

[40:34] And so what they do is they go and they will do one to many.

[40:37] They'll do like a circuit of in-person events.

[40:40] Now that's because they realize that they have to get more leverage so they just try and

[40:44] attend as many of conferences as they can and it totally is effective.

[40:47] It's just a different way of doing things.

[40:49] But that's their way of getting now if the LTV is high enough, you can still make a tremendous

[40:54] amount of money in that setting.

[40:56] But if you are a business consumer business, you're typically going to need a decentralized

[41:01] manner of a core customer.

[41:03] So like for example, school needs a decentralized manner.

[41:06] Like we have to have affiliates which last year 55% of all of our customers came from affiliates

[41:12] or referrals, right?

[41:13] People with on the platform referred other people, which is awesome.

[41:16] And so we're like, you know, okay, what if we actually like try to do this little

[41:19] harder and so we're doing this year?

[41:21] Right?

[41:22] And so the whole point is you can either do it and you will get capped or you can find

[41:29] a system that allows or enables other people to do it on your behalf.

[41:32] So the first mistake of getting lead getters is having a bad product and thinking that

[41:36] a good incentive system is going to outweigh a bad product.

[41:39] Imagine you go to a restaurant and the sandwiches are mediocre or a song year or not that

[41:42] good, right?

[41:43] And then they say, hey, we'll give you 50% off your next sandwich if you tell your friends

[41:48] to come here.

[41:49] We were like, I mean, I just, I don't want to tell my friends to come here.

[41:53] It's just not that good.

[41:54] Right?

[41:55] And imagine this, let's level up from a song you say, which is just like a mediocre sandwich.

[41:59] If they say you get 50% off of sandwich if you get somebody else, are you still like,

[42:02] are you going to refer somebody's for a mediocre sandwich?

[42:04] Like, I don't know, probably not.

[42:08] And so the big thing is, is people trying to jack more into the incentive when the most

[42:12] efficient thing to do, it's just make the product better because you want to get it so

[42:16] that this is just mine, this is my two cents on this.

[42:19] I want people who are like, I'm about to refer all my friends because your products

[42:24] really good.

[42:25] Is there some sort of incentive that you have that I can get paid for it?

[42:28] And so it's like, I want people who do already want to be doing this anyways.

[42:32] And then maybe reach out and ask so I can just lubricate the incentive system.

[42:36] More so than go from zero to one, I want to go from like one to end.

[42:40] Like I was going to refer people already, but with this incentive, I'll refer everyone.

[42:44] That's where this really gets magical, rather than trying to use the incentive as the

[42:48] zero to one.

[42:49] And I think me too, like me personally, I also probably in my earlier days spent too much

[42:53] time on like, how do I give even crazy incentives, rather than how do I just make the

[42:57] thing better?

[42:58] So that's the thing number one is like, if people don't want to refer your product,

[43:02] it's typically because the product's not that good.

[43:03] And so like we can obsess, you can read every referral book in the world you want, but it's

[43:07] always going to still come down to how good the sale is.

[43:09] So the second big mistake for getting lead getters is a poor incentive.

[43:12] Now, think about this is like a good product requires low activation energy.

[43:17] Like there's some products that are just so good that you want the credit you're going

[43:21] to get from your friend by telling them about how amazing they say, which is all right, they

[43:24] don't need to give you a dollar for every person you refer.

[43:27] You'll just do it because you want your friend to think you're awesome because you've

[43:30] turned them onto the great spot.

[43:31] But the incentive acts is a little bit of a counterbalance.

[43:33] So let's say that you've got a seven out of 10 product, but if you've got a 10 out

[43:36] of 10 incentive system, you're still going to have a lot of people referring you business.

[43:39] Right?

[43:40] And so I mean, there's some businesses that do have mediocre products, but they have exceptional

[43:44] affiliate programs where they basically affiliates make so much money selling their product

[43:49] that it's almost like their main product.

[43:51] And I think that most people think they're incentive is good and it's just not that good.

[43:55] Are you giving 20% to somebody or 50% off the next sale, which is just not that good

[44:00] of incentive.

[44:01] Now, if I say, if you get a friend here to try my sandwich that's mediocre and I'll give

[44:04] you say which is for life, I'll probably get people to refer more people to get sandwiches,

[44:09] right?

[44:10] But the thing is is like, it can't be so big that people are like, hey, just eat the

[44:14] damn say, which for me, so that I can get this incentive because then you're you're circumventing

[44:18] the whole point of this.

[44:20] The point is that they buy the product, they try the product, they like it and they

[44:22] buy it again, right?

[44:23] That's the point.

[44:25] A lot of times we try and Jerry rig our way around solving the main thing, but the

[44:29] core economics of every business are always going to come down to hug at the product

[44:32] is.

[44:33] And so like, this is something that has taken me way too long to realize.

[44:35] And I think the reason to took me so long to realize is I got really good at marketing

[44:38] and sales early.

[44:40] That was kind of my my 4A into into the business world.

[44:43] Like, I mean, obviously I had my Jim, but I, you know, the first offer I ever really ran

[44:48] was still the greatest offer that's run in the gym industry for the last like 12 years,

[44:52] 13 years.

[44:53] Like, and so like, I wrote a rocket as my first try.

[44:57] And so in some ways, like, I got lucky on my first shot.

[45:01] And so I did what most people would do, which is like, I had a very fast feedback loop

[45:05] of reward for doing that.

[45:06] So I did more of that thing and I did it harder to end it better.

[45:09] But you can only spend the marketing wheel so many times because at some point you will

[45:13] run out of customers and if you're saying which is our good, you'll just told the

[45:15] market plays very quickly, very aggressively, that you're mediocre.

[45:19] And that's what you want to avoid.

[45:20] And so like, I remember hearing people talk about this who were further ahead of me

[45:24] saying like marketing is just gasoline, it'll just like let it'll do whatever you're doing

[45:28] faster.

[45:29] So like, if you suck, it'll just let more people know that you suck faster.

[45:32] The problem is that it doesn't take into account numbers, meaning like, you can tell

[45:37] a lot of people that you suck really fast and still make a profit.

[45:40] And this is fundamentally why I think like the education space, the information space,

[45:44] gets a very bad name.

[45:45] But it's because like, if once you know how to market in sell, you absolutely can make millions

[45:49] of dollars.

[45:50] And you can deliver a pretty bad product, which I try to do my very best to try to reverse

[45:54] that trend and glue the very good product with the things that we educate like grab the

[45:58] books, like they're my biggest gift I can give you.

[46:01] Like, but big picture, I am a product of the alternative education space.

[46:07] Like I didn't learn all these things from college.

[46:09] I learned these things from other business owners who taught me specific skills that I was

[46:13] able to cobble together and piece together into building businesses that made money.

[46:17] The thing that I didn't learn until much later, and honestly the best people to consume

[46:21] products that are from is in Silicon Valley.

[46:23] Like listen to software people talk about product.

[46:26] They are obsessive of product.

[46:27] And there's a reason that some of the biggest companies in the world are all product

[46:30] of tech companies.

[46:31] And it's because product gives you the most leverage.

[46:33] Because if you think about it, you could conceivably not do any promotion.

[46:39] You have to do enough to get the first users, of course.

[46:42] But once you have those first users, if those users then continue to advertise and we have,

[46:46] like this is where you get the most leverage.

[46:48] This guy, this guy brings you another guy who does the promotion for you.

[46:55] This is, and now, like, think about this, imagine this doesn't exist.

[47:00] So this doesn't exist anymore.

[47:02] This doesn't exist anymore.

[47:03] All you did was make the best damn say on what you've ever made for somebody.

[47:07] And this guy tries to say which, and he's like, man, this say which is numb, right?

[47:11] I don't know, he's a weird guy.

[47:13] So he says, no, I'm a lot.

[47:14] And so he has it.

[47:16] And then he says, dude, I'm going to tell all my friends about this.

[47:19] And what people don't realize about referrals is that they typically are not like a one-to-one

[47:24] ratio.

[47:25] So it's not that like every person refers a person.

[47:27] It's typically like one out of ten people refers ten people.

[47:30] And so we have you kind of like micro influencers within their network that they have

[47:33] enough trust that people will listen to that.

[47:35] Like if Alex goes and gets say which is like, I'm a bit of a stay in which a fish

[47:39] you know, not a few of.

[47:40] I do love me a good sandwich.

[47:41] It's often like, do this place is great.

[47:43] I don't give compliments.

[47:44] I don't give cheap compliments.

[47:45] And so if I say that, then a lot of people like, well, one, he's had a lot of say which

[47:48] is two.

[47:49] He doesn't say that most say which shops are good.

[47:51] And he has the means of I would ever say which he wants.

[47:53] And so he probably has high his recommendation carries weight.

[47:57] And if I recommended a sandwich shop in the past, then it was good, then they will even

[48:00] be more likely this were brand comes in, more likely to listen to my referral again.

[48:05] And so the problem for the business owners is that we don't know which guy is going to

[48:09] be the ten.

[48:10] Which of the ten is going to be the one guy.

[48:12] And so that means that you just have to over deliver for everyone understanding that nine

[48:16] and a ten aren't going to be the person who's the matchographer.

[48:18] I got very lucky with my first store at a United Fitness at the time was transformation

[48:23] center hundreds and beach was my first gym.

[48:26] I think in the first ten customers, one of the customers that I signed up in that first

[48:32] two weeks, I think brought me like 20 more customers.

[48:34] And I'm telling you for a small business owner, like it was, I mean, it was like the difference

[48:38] between making right and not making right.

[48:40] And it was a nurse who knew all these other nurses and hurt, she brought her hair

[48:43] stylist and she brought her friends in.

[48:45] She brought other nurses from work in, like she brought everybody in.

[48:48] She brought her, like she brought everybody in and I was like, man, this is so cool.

[48:52] And you just want to look at what happened with that person that happened on accident and

[48:57] do it on purpose for everyone.

[48:59] So that one that next super refer comes in, you're ready.

[49:02] The third big mistake is not reinvesting.

[49:05] And so I'll explain what I mean by this.

[49:07] So if you decide that you're going to have a referral strategy or an affiliate strategy,

[49:12] as the prime where I'm getting business, which I honestly think that you should figure that

[49:15] out with a business, like it is the way that you create a compounding business that is

[49:18] viral in terms of its acquisition.

[49:20] And as you scale, any company, especially to see you need word of mouth and at the very least,

[49:24] the nice thing is that word of mouth for product also translates into retention.

[49:28] So if somebody refers somebody to you, the likely that they stay in continue to pay you

[49:31] is pretty high.

[49:32] And even if someone doesn't refer to you, if you structured something that was so good that

[49:35] most people do refer, the likely that people who don't refer still continue to stay in

[49:39] pay is still also high.

[49:41] And so you end up solving for both acquisition and retention with the same core activities,

[49:45] which for me is like high leverage, right?

[49:47] Like if you fix the product, you get more customers and you get the customers who stay to

[49:50] buy more.

[49:51] Once you find an affiliate system or referral system that works, it's just letting it go

[49:55] on autopilot.

[49:56] And I think that is a mistake.

[49:58] And so like I mentioned earlier, like school, for example, we did a lot of things this year

[50:03] to promote it.

[50:04] And then we saw that 55% of our customers came for affiliates.

[50:07] And so now we're like doubling down.

[50:08] We're like, how can you make this even easier?

[50:10] How can you loop get the process?

[50:11] How can we remove steps?

[50:12] How can we give them more training?

[50:14] How can we, you know, like, how can we just make this even higher likelihood that people

[50:18] already have a low threshold because they like the product?

[50:20] We just lower the activation they need, even lower so that more people can hop over and

[50:25] bring business our way.

[50:26] I told you at the beginning that would give you three ways to get so rich that you'd

[50:29] realize that making money was never the point.

[50:32] And so the first way is that you build a brand.

[50:34] And the translation that into making money is that you get more people to click on whatever

[50:38] you do for your advertisements.

[50:40] You get more of them to buy.

[50:41] You get them to buy at higher prices.

[50:43] You get them to buy more times.

[50:44] All of those compound into lower cost per customer and more lifetime value per customer, the

[50:49] two primary ways of growing a business.

[50:50] The second way is that you track your inputs and outputs so that you do more of the things

[50:54] that actually generate more customers and get your team to do more of those things that

[50:58] actually didn't work customers or get them to be worth more.

[51:02] And basically remove everything else and avoid all the mistakes and pitfalls that people

[51:06] get time sucked into that don't actually move the needle.

[51:09] The third is getting a higher leverage way to get customers, which is getting lead geters

[51:14] so that they can get customers in your behalf.

[51:16] And basically every Mundo business you've ever seen has this.

[51:20] And if you're like, man, Alex, that's hard.

[51:22] Welcome to becoming super rich.

[51:23] There's a reason that many people have it.

[51:25] And so you have to find ways to get leverage and the strongest way is to build an exceptional

[51:29] product.

[51:30] The second strongest way is to have an amazing incentive.

[51:33] And the third best way is that when you have a great product or a great incentive that

[51:36] you reinvest in the thing that's making it work.

[51:38] And when you do all three, you will make the amount of money because you have this amazing

[51:42] brand.

[51:43] You know the inputs that generate those types of returns and you will continue to reinvest in

[51:48] higher and lower leverage ways of getting customers to get you more customers.

[51:51] So that eventually it's decentralized that it grows on its own without you.

[51:56] It becomes a monster that you have to feed rather than dog that you have to pull by the

[52:00] neck to grow.

[52:01] And there's this great visual analogy for what this feels like at the end.

[52:04] So they say this in white combinator, I just love it, which is in the beginning a startup

[52:09] feels like pushing a boulder up a hill.

[52:11] And then as soon as you get product market fit, which is where the customers tell the customers

[52:14] about the product, you start getting referrals and that wheel starts spinning.

[52:17] It feels like you're chasing the boulder down the other side of the hill running after

[52:20] it.

[52:21] And so I love that visual because that's where you want to get.

[52:24] And to be clear, it's pain flow and both sides.

[52:26] It's just most people would prefer the pain on the other side of the hill.

[52:30] So I'll get real for you second.

[52:31] I'm 35 now so that the numbers go over here now.

[52:36] And I had a big kind of existential crisis right around this age when I sold

[52:42] demolition prestige labs in Alan for 46.2 million.

[52:46] And well, Alan is so separately, but whatever.

[52:49] And my big realization was, okay, I no longer materially need to make money.

[52:53] Like I can just sit this thing in a treasury and live on a few million dollars a year

[52:57] doing absolutely nothing.

[52:59] And that ended up making me really sad.

[53:02] And I'll explain something that maybe real for some of you, which is I remember

[53:07] when I was in college, the the power ball lottery had gotten over a billion dollars.

[53:12] And so I went and I bought a ticket with my girlfriend at the time.

[53:15] It was more just because it was like, fine, it wasn't because I thought I was going to win.

[53:19] But when the drawing actually happened, I remember having this moment of sheer dread,

[53:24] where I was like, what if I win?

[53:26] And the dread was that if I won, I would never have had a shot to prove that I was good enough.

[53:32] And that the only reason I was successful was because of luck.

[53:35] And even if I built success with the cash that I got from the lottery, it would basically

[53:38] be meaningless.

[53:39] Now you could talk about all the self-work you want there of like, well, you should take

[53:43] a billion dollars or someone offered you a billion dollars.

[53:45] Yeah, I think you should.

[53:46] But I still wanted to have the shot of being able to prove that I could do it.

[53:51] And I really wanted to prove it to me, I think, more than anything else.

[53:55] And when I did lose, I remember feeling relieved, of course, I didn't hit the billion

[53:59] dollar power ball.

[54:00] But selling my company for a material amount of money, so much that I didn't have to

[54:05] work anymore, it did help me realize that making money was never the point.

[54:11] It was just a way of measuring whether I was doing a good job in the thing that I was

[54:17] building.

[54:18] And so it's over basically an entire year of me being relatively sad because I didn't

[54:21] know what to do.

[54:23] And so sadness is, as I define it, a lack of perceived options, which is you don't know

[54:27] what to do.

[54:28] It's why I feel so hopeless.

[54:29] You don't know what actions to take, which is why I just want to stay in bed and

[54:31] do nothing.

[54:32] Exiety, by the way, is the exact opposite of that, which is you have many options and

[54:36] no priorities.

[54:37] That's why it's like, you have many things you could do, but you don't know which one

[54:39] to start with.

[54:40] And so for me, it was definitely sad and it sat that time.

[54:43] And so it took me that whole year of the sale, which was right here this year is

[54:47] when I sold, to realize that hard work for me was the goal.

[54:52] And so I want to take this quick second to make this point, which is that I get a decent

[54:56] amount of flag for talking about how I work.

[54:59] And I want to be clear, do whatever you want.

[55:02] Like, I just knew that when I didn't work, I was very sad.

[55:05] And when I work, I'm much happier.

[55:06] And so I work.

[55:08] And if you don't aren't that way, then that's amazing.

[55:11] Like you want.

[55:12] I talk about what worked for me.

[55:13] And I talk about that because it would have been helpful for me to hear somebody else

[55:16] who was like me, say these things.

[55:18] Like it will be hard regardless.

[55:19] I mean, I think a big part of the suffering that I've had has come from thinking that

[55:25] things should be different than they are.

[55:27] Like I should be happier.

[55:29] I should be, like I think most of human discontentness comes from thinking we should

[55:33] be happier than we are.

[55:34] I just have the expectation of the universe that life should always be happy.

[55:39] But it's like it's so rare that that occurs.

[55:42] And I've gotten significantly more feel goods out of looking back at what I've done and

[55:47] being proud of myself.

[55:49] And I think that that's something that I can kind of chew on day after day after day.

[55:53] Even if what my day-to-day is isn't always fun in games.

[55:57] You don't even like, if I have to report to the public, because I'm like, oh, okay, we

[56:00] got to do that.

[56:01] Then I do it.

[56:02] You don't even mean.

[56:03] Okay, with that.

[56:04] But it's because I like the output of that.

[56:06] I like the amount of businesses that I see that have come to me like dude, I had my job.

[56:10] I read your first book and I made 100,000 dollars.

[56:12] I read the second book.

[56:13] We got two million dollars this year.

[56:14] I love that stuff.

[56:15] And I'll die and no one will care and we'll all move on in weeks.

[56:21] And that'll be it.

[56:22] And so I live this way because when I looked back on the years when I was at this point

[56:27] and I knew I didn't need to make any more money, I looked at the happiest moments of my life

[56:31] when I looked back.

[56:32] And the happiest moments was when I was going through it.

[56:34] It was like when I was working.

[56:36] And I had this very, there's this saying that I really like a lot, which is like, you're

[56:39] always going through the good old days.

[56:41] When I was going through it, like, you know, I could tell Laila like, man, remember when

[56:45] we were like, broke his shit and trying to make this work.

[56:47] It's like, yeah, it's like you look back, nostalgicly, on those moments.

[56:51] During the moment, it's tough.

[56:52] But when you look back, it's actually like some of the fondest memories you have.

[56:56] And so reframing the fact that like all of my fondest memories were during my hardest

[56:59] times, I then was like, well, shoot.

[57:02] Maybe I should reframe how I see hard.

[57:04] Maybe I should pursue hard things.

[57:06] And so that's what became my kind of life thesis, which was hard work as the goal.

[57:11] I want to leave nothing in my take.

[57:13] I want to own a leave on empty, right?

[57:14] I want to have nothing left.

[57:15] Like those are the days that I enjoy the most.

[57:17] Is that I worked at the end of my eye, I know I can look back on my day and be like, I

[57:21] moved all of these things forward.

[57:23] And to me, that's meaningful.

[57:25] And to other people, it might not be.

[57:26] And if you're like, well, I don't want to work.

[57:28] I'm like, don't.

[57:29] Like, biomeans, don't, for the love God.

[57:31] Don't do it, everyone.

[57:32] Like, if I had one big message, it's like, do whatever you want.

[57:36] Like, the queen of England died a year ago or whatever it is.

[57:41] And you haven't thought about her, but she was like one of the most significant female

[57:44] marnor's of all times.

[57:45] She was one of the wealthiest people to ever exist.

[57:48] And you haven't thought about her until me saying this right now.

[57:51] Think about your great, great grandfather.

[57:52] You probably haven't thought about him until right now in this moment.

[57:54] And no one's going to think about you either.

[57:56] It takes three generations for you to be completely forgotten.

[57:58] Where you see pictures of your relatives, and you don't know anyone in the picture.

[58:01] They're just humans to you.

[58:03] And we're going to be humans to other people.

[58:05] And so I think in some way, it actually is a really nice humanitarian angle, which

[58:08] is that in four generations, like one, everybody who's in your progeny is so far removed

[58:12] in terms of gene pool that they've been mixed with other people.

[58:15] So much greater than not you than they are you.

[58:18] That like, it's just humans.

[58:21] And so like, in some ways, we're all family, not to get all cumbi on.

[58:25] But like, in a lot of ways, we are.

[58:26] And so I'm good with making stuff that helps a bunch of people.

[58:31] And using whatever unique genetic previous business I have, which is like, I'm willing

[58:36] to work for a long period of time.

[58:37] I don't lose focus very easily.

[58:39] I can keep kind of working for extended periods of time without losing energy.

[58:43] And so like, I do that.

[58:44] And there's some people who are painters and there's some people who are musicians.

[58:46] And like, they contribute in their way.

[58:48] But I think that I will always have respect for anyone who works their ass off.

[58:52] He's just one of those things like, you might not like him.

[58:55] You might not like what he does.

[58:56] You can't say the guy doesn't work his ass off.

[58:59] I was talking to a friend the other day and he brought this up.

[59:01] He was like, hey man, I think your content is sounding like a little hardcore right now.

[59:06] And when people meet you in person, he said, like, the number of things they tell me is,

[59:11] he's a lot nicer than I thought he was.

[59:13] And he's like, kind of funny and cracked jokes and stuff.

[59:16] And I heard that and he was like, I think when you started out, like, people think that

[59:20] you just do this to make money now.

[59:21] And I also say that to be clear so that I have brand coverage, which is if I just say I'm

[59:26] only here to make money, then no one can get it ever upset that I make money.

[59:30] I think where people get in trouble is where they're like, I only do this because I want

[59:34] to love humanity.

[59:35] It's like, well, if you do that, then never make money.

[59:36] Fine, just give it all away free.

[59:37] Like, you basically set yourself up for a trap to be destroyed later.

[59:40] So that's why I say that.

[59:41] Now, is it possible to both make money and do things that help people?

[59:44] Yeah, I think that's the nature of capitalism.

[59:47] Like, when I had this period of time right here where I was like, what am I going to do

[59:50] with my life?

[59:51] I originally thought I was going to start a charity.

[59:52] That was my whole.

[59:53] That was like going to be my whole angle.

[59:55] And the more I thought about it, the more I thought that charities were not sustainable.

[59:59] They can't feed themselves.

[60:00] You have to keep always asking for more money, really begging people for money so that they

[60:04] can care about your cause.

[60:05] But basically, it's an inefficient allocation of capital.

[60:08] Like, you take from one side, you give to another.

[60:10] But in order for something to be sustainable, it has to have a cycle.

[60:13] And so then I ended up reading this book by John Mackie called Conscious Capitalism.

[60:17] And to be really clear, I think I only read the first third and I was like, this is whatever

[60:20] I need to do.

[60:21] Anyways, I like, I get the point of the book.

[60:23] So basically, it's just that in order to have something be sustainable, it needs to benefit

[60:27] all stakeholders.

[60:28] It has to benefit the investors.

[60:30] It has to benefit benefit the employees.

[60:31] It has to benefit the environment.

[60:33] It has to benefit the customers.

[60:34] It has to benefit everyone.

[60:35] And so I essentially like re-derived capitalism from, from, from, from, from base units of like,

[60:42] how do I do good?

[60:43] How do I do good in a sustainable way?

[60:45] Oh, I need to have a business that does good, but because it does good to generate

[60:48] its profit because there's value to all stakeholders.

[60:51] And so fundamentally, like, that's why I had this whole like, okay, well, then I'll just

[60:54] give lots of value here, which then will create these businesses or attract businesses

[60:58] to then invest in.

[61:00] And then that will be the cycle.

[61:01] I get when you're broke, like, it's very hard to think about other people.

[61:04] But you will end up getting to that point.

[61:05] Now everyone's numbers different.

[61:07] Some people are like, I just want $10 million dollars.

[61:08] We're just want $1 million dollars.

[61:09] People want a billion dollars.

[61:10] Like, everyone's different.

[61:12] In terms of your, in terms of your requests of the universe.

[61:16] But I will say something that base has said, which is that small expectations are a

[61:19] self-fulfilling prophecy.

[61:20] And so like if you shoot small, you wouldn't smoke.

[61:23] And so if you're shooting, if shooting is going to take the same cost either way, it's

[61:26] going to be hard.

[61:27] And it's going to take time and years and effort.

[61:28] It's like, I think Peter still said this.

[61:30] He said, if you want to compete, open a restaurant in Chicago.

[61:33] You can just do that if you want.

[61:34] If you also want the monetary goal, which I just like, as it just shows me how, how, if I'm

[61:38] improving in the game.

[61:40] And back to what my friend was saying at the very beginning, he said, I don't think a lot of

[61:43] people understand that you just actually just like love business.

[61:47] And I think that's it.

[61:48] Like, I just so happen to have fallen in love with something that rewards financially.

[61:54] But like my litmus test for this is that I actually don't have tremendous affinity for any

[61:58] one business.

[61:59] I'm not like, oh, I love, I love sneakers.

[62:02] I love, I love insurance.

[62:04] I love whatever I love software.

[62:06] Like, I, I just kind of like love business.

[62:09] And I think trying to fit myself into a box, cost me a lot of pain and suffering.

[62:13] And so I will like, when I think about the moments where time stands still, it's when

[62:19] I'm talking to a business owner about their business about how it works.

[62:21] And I get to ask like a million questions and like, oh, what are the margins on that?

[62:25] Oh, and like, when I ask questions, are they super invasive?

[62:27] Because I'm just like, how much profit do you make?

[62:29] I like, what are your returns, but like, what's your conversion look like?

[62:32] What's the like, I ask all these things?

[62:34] And so many of you think some like, I'm trying to steal their stuff and I'm like, oh,

[62:36] I have no desire.

[62:37] But I, I just want to understand it.

[62:39] And so I think that's why like, I write books about this stuff.

[62:42] I make videos about this stuff.

[62:43] I draw pictures about business because it's, it's what I love.

[62:46] And it just so happens to be something that makes money.

[62:49] And that is what, like, if I were, if I were playing video games all day, no one would

[62:54] care.

[62:55] And it's just because there's a wider percentage of people that can play video games all

[62:57] day and people understand it.

[62:58] It's just that fewer percentage of people understand that I would work all day and

[63:02] talk about business all day.

[63:03] Because why would you ever want to do that?

[63:05] Well, it's just like, I feel like I have this very odd, enjoy, like, I have this like,

[63:09] I have this like business fetish.

[63:11] And I remember because I was very obsessed with fitness for like over a decade.

[63:14] I was, I competed like I was very in fitness like, and I'm a pretty obsessive person.

[63:18] And so enough that the people that I worked with were like, dude, like, please quit here

[63:23] and start something, finish really to it.

[63:27] And so I ended up doing that because they were like, dude, I can't hear your talk about

[63:29] fitness anymore.

[63:30] Like it's so annoying.

[63:31] But here's the craze bar.

[63:32] Two weeks into starting the fitness business I had once I had my gym.

[63:36] I realized that I loved business more than I loved fitness.

[63:39] And I love fitness a lot.

[63:40] And I still, I still work out this day.

[63:42] But I loved business even more.

[63:44] And that was weird for me because I was like, I'll never like anything more than fitness.

[63:47] There's no chance.

[63:49] And until I found it.

[63:50] And so if you are fortunate enough to love a specific problem or love a specific avatar

[63:54] by all means, like my hope is that you just lose yourself to that romantic love and just

[63:57] go all in on it.

[63:59] But I am hardcore, I'm willing to be hardcore in my content even for the sound bites, even

[64:03] though I know it makes me look more binary, more black and white than I really am.

[64:08] Because I think that for the younger version of me that was out there that was like,

[64:10] I felt very misunderstood, I felt very lonely.

[64:13] It was like, I just want to work all the time.

[64:15] And I want to work on weekends and I want to work in the morning and I want to work

[64:18] on the wake, basically.

[64:19] And it's because it's the thing, like, it's the thing I'm into.

[64:22] And I had a lot of suffering when people would judge me on it.

[64:26] And would tell me that I was doing something wrong.

[64:27] And that like, I was unbalanced or like, and it's really tough when you don't have the

[64:31] proof to show that you're good at it yet.

[64:33] And that's what it was for, I mean, like, these are years guys.

[64:36] This isn't like six weeks, six, like, these are years.

[64:40] And I started here, right?

[64:42] Like, like, this years.

[64:44] And so I bring this up because like you might be on year three, your three is before

[64:48] this graph even starts for me to put this in context.

[64:51] Like, this is your four for me.

[64:53] Like, 26.

[64:54] This is your four started 22.

[64:56] And so I bring this up because like, you're not on the wrong path.

[65:01] You're just early.

[65:02] Hey guys, this channel grows and helps more people when you guys

[65:06] share it.

[65:07] And so if you found this video viable or have found a valuable so far, I mean, the

[65:10] world to me, if you shot as a text or you shared it on your, you know, your Instagram stories,

[65:14] you're going to post about it.

[65:15] It helps more people see it and ultimately hopefully change their life should better.

[65:18] If you like this, then you'll like these two other videos on making lots of money.

[65:22] And finding meaningless in life once you do it.

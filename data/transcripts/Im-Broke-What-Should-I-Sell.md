[00:00] I just gave a guest lecture last week at University of Texas for a class on entrepreneurship.

[00:04] There are some people here who don't try for shit.

[00:07] One of the key questions that many of the spine entrepreneurs in the classroom asked is,

[00:11] what should I sell?

[00:12] First off, we have to define what are the actual things that can be sold.

[00:16] And this may sound crazy, but there's actually fewer of them than you think.

[00:19] And there's digital and physical formats of each of these things, which actually give you

[00:22] 14 different things you can possibly sell.

[00:25] Outside of finding those, I'll talk about how we can increase the scale of the deliverable

[00:30] that we have using something that I call the delivery cube.

[00:33] Number one is you can sell products.

[00:34] You could sell a physical product, which would be like I sell water bottles.

[00:38] A digital product would be something like APDF.

[00:41] The second category is services.

[00:43] So this is stuff you do for other people.

[00:45] In the physical realm, a service would be a massage, Boeing someone's loan, fixing someone's

[00:50] car.

[00:51] The digital side, oftentimes that service is something that happens in the digital space.

[00:55] So if you are an ad agency and you make ads, the ad itself that you're making is a service

[01:01] also buying media is a service.

[01:03] All of this things would be digital services.

[01:05] category three, you have access.

[01:07] Physical access is like you lease a building.

[01:10] You gain access to the building.

[01:12] Digital access is you gain access to a library of digital content like Netflix.

[01:16] category four is attention.

[01:18] You can sell or buy physical attention.

[01:21] You can be like a billboard, cars physically drive past it and see it to the same degree,

[01:26] Facebook and Google have digital attention and they sell the eyeballs and the attention of

[01:31] that audience.

[01:32] category five, like the hurricane, is risk selling insurance.

[01:36] But you can ensure a building.

[01:38] But you can also ensure against the digital format, a cyber threat.

[01:41] If you're in a established business owner and you sell physical products or even services,

[01:45] you can sell the risk associated with it, which is like ensuring the products.

[01:49] Some people give guarantees, but you can actually get people to pay for a guarantee which

[01:52] is insurance.

[01:53] Just like AppleCare is just paid for insurance.

[01:56] The next thing you can buy yourself is money itself.

[02:00] The entire banking industry is predicated on buying and selling money and the rate they

[02:04] charge is the interest itself.

[02:06] And so you can have physical money, right?

[02:08] Like the actual US dollars, you can also have digital money, which I'm not going to get

[02:12] into crypto, but that is a form of digital money.

[02:14] category seven is an endorsement or brand.

[02:17] In the physical world, I say, hey, you can use my logo on your shirt and you give me

[02:21] a percentage of all your sales in the digital world when they sell a check mark on Instagram.

[02:26] That is selling an endorsement, it's selling a brand, it's selling some sort of status

[02:30] that gets transferred and a fee is paid as a result of that.

[02:34] One of the key points here is that it can be a combination of those categories.

[02:38] So if someone sells a rock concert, for example, you're selling access to an experience,

[02:43] but you might also sell drinks and t-shirts while you're there.

[02:46] And you might record it and then also sell the digital versions that do what I'm going

[02:49] with here.

[02:50] In terms of picking which one to sell, it's mostly going to come down to two things.

[02:53] One is the resources you have and your skills value experience.

[02:57] If you're a first time much winner, then you're like, well, I don't have any other

[02:59] experience, but you actually do.

[03:01] And let me hear me out.

[03:02] Your parents did something.

[03:04] And if you don't have parents, the people who raised you did something.

[03:08] And if no one raised you, people you knew did something.

[03:10] And you were around them.

[03:11] So like, for example, my mom is a doctor.

[03:14] She's an eye surgeon.

[03:15] So I know a lot of stuff about eyes.

[03:17] That would be a category of stuff that I actually know a lot more about than you might expect.

[03:21] If your dad was a mechanic, you probably know what a carburetor is.

[03:23] I have no idea what it is.

[03:24] I've heard the word before.

[03:25] Oftentimes you've had little odd jobs.

[03:27] Like when I was in high school, I was a blender tenor.

[03:29] And then I did catering at an orthodox Jewish company.

[03:32] You probably know a lot of stuff just from as Moses of being around it.

[03:37] We have these seven things digital and physical.

[03:39] Is there any one of these that I already have a little bit more experience with?

[03:42] And then of those things, which problem is the biggest that I think I can solve, given

[03:46] the resources that I have access to.

[03:47] What I was talking about with this entrepreneurship group is that they had a hundred dollars

[03:51] to start their business.

[03:52] Now that would probably preclude you from most physical products, probably most kind

[03:56] of digital software type stuff.

[03:59] And so most of the time you're going to start selling your time, which is often services.

[04:04] Here's the first time I provide the most value to, for the least amount of money, to me.

[04:08] That's where your sweet spot is.

[04:09] Is the first or next thing that I would probably package itself.

[04:12] Once you've established that, top can I enhance or make it more or less valuable or more

[04:17] less profitable for me as business owner.

[04:19] The delivery cube has six pieces to it.

[04:22] That's eight.

[04:23] Six.

[04:24] Number one is can I deliver this thing one to one in a small group?

[04:27] Can I deliver it one to many?

[04:29] Each of these have different value proposition that are associated with them.

[04:32] If you sold semi-private group stuff, it's a small group of five people doing something

[04:37] that's different than doing a webinar to a thousand people at once.

[04:41] Versus having a call review system where you review someone's calls to give them feedback

[04:45] one on one.

[04:46] The second frame of the delivery cube is do it yourself, DIY, DWI, which is done with you,

[04:51] as in you're holding their hand through the process of whatever it is you're doing.

[04:54] Or done for you where you do all of the work yourself and you sell them a final product

[04:57] or some final outcome.

[04:58] Each of these give you different levels of scale.

[05:00] Do it yourself, you can sell it unlimited out.

[05:02] Typically the value is smaller.

[05:04] And with you, you have in between the two extremes of do it yourself and done for you.

[05:08] Done for you is the most expensive typically.

[05:11] Sometimes the easiest to sell but one of the hardest things to deliver on.

[05:14] The third frame is what level of support am I going to do and specifically on what medium?

[05:19] Am I going to offer support via chat?

[05:21] Am I going to offer support via email?

[05:23] Am I going to offer support via phone call?

[05:24] That's going to be Zoom call.

[05:26] These are all different ways than I can support whatever the thing is that I'm selling.

[05:30] Obviously if I do email support, that's going to be significantly more scalable.

[05:33] It'll probably also be significantly less valuable than somebody who's real time available

[05:37] to hop on a Zoom call whenever they want.

[05:39] Filter number four is how do I want them to consume the thing?

[05:41] They could consume it visually.

[05:43] They could consume it audio-wise.

[05:44] They could consume it live.

[05:46] They could consume a recording.

[05:47] They could consume it visually via text.

[05:49] So there's different ways we can have people consume some sort of thing whatever it is.

[05:53] Anything that's live is typically going to be perceived as more valuable.

[05:56] And if it's in person and live, probably the most valuable and probably the least scalable.

[06:00] On the flip side, if I did something that was recorded and was digital, it would be

[06:04] the most scalable, but probably the least valuable.

[06:07] The fifth lens is the speed and convenience of whatever we're delivering.

[06:12] This comes down to multiple things.

[06:13] One is it 24 hours a day or is it just 9 to 5?

[06:17] Frame two is how many days a week am I maintaining that level of service?

[06:21] Three is how fast is that response?

[06:23] So I might be open 24 hours a day, but I have responses that are guaranteed in 24 hours,

[06:28] which is different than saying I'm open 9 to 5, 5 days a week, but I respond within

[06:32] 3 minutes.

[06:33] And the ultimate extremes are either your over-staffed, but your customers don't have to

[06:37] wait.

[06:38] You incur inefficiency so that they have convenience, or they incur the inefficiency and all

[06:42] of your staff is 100% utilized because they're going to call it a call to call all day long.

[06:47] Different strategies, there's wildly successful companies that you both.

[06:50] Frame six is what I like to call the 10x to 110th test.

[06:53] If I charge 10 times more for my current thing, what would I have to change about

[06:58] my thing that I sell in order for it to be worth?

[07:02] 10 times more.

[07:03] This ultimately gets me thinking in much bigger ways about how much value I would need

[07:07] to provide.

[07:08] Let's say I go from a $10,000 thing to a $100,000 thing.

[07:10] That still would be profitable at a $10,000 thing.

[07:13] It just makes me think differently because I now have to justify my $100,000 price tag.

[07:18] The flip side of that is equally powerful, which is if I had to deliver the same or even

[07:22] more value than I currently am, but I could only charge one tenth of the price that I currently

[07:28] am.

[07:28] What else would I do that would be perceived as valuable?

[07:31] Would not cost me enough so I could still justify one tenth the price but maintain my value.

[07:37] This gives me a very good starting point to both figure out what the first thing I might

[07:40] want to sell is and then how can I scale it and make it more profitable and or more valuable

[07:44] to my end consumer and think through the ratio of how many people I would need internally

[07:49] my company to facilitate that.

[07:51] And so this is what I was explaining with the University of Texas.

[07:55] And if this was interesting to you, we actually have the entire full lecture in Q&A.

[07:59] The links somewhere around here.

[08:00] I'm sure it'll be available to you.

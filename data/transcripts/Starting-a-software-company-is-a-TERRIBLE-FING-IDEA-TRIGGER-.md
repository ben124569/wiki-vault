[00:00] In this video, I'm going to talk about why starting a software company as an information

[00:04] and service marketer, e-course, guru, etc. is a terrible fucking idea.

[00:09] If you don't know how I am, I am Alex from OZONacquisition.com, it's a portfolio company that

[00:12] now does over $100 million a year.

[00:14] In this video, I'm just here to trigger a handful of you and hopefully give a warning,

[00:19] a strong warning to those of you who want to do it.

[00:22] Now, the question might ask is why would somebody want to start a software company when

[00:27] they have an e-learning core service, etc.

[00:30] Well, I'll tell you why.

[00:31] It's because they think that one, it's going to make their service company stickier,

[00:36] because they're like, oh, software sticky.

[00:38] No, no, no, no.

[00:39] Software is not sticky.

[00:40] Really good software is sticky.

[00:42] Your software will not be sticky and will just cost you a lot of money.

[00:45] Well, let's just say, that's no one reason that they want to do it.

[00:48] The second reason that they want to do it, and this is the even shooter one, is that they think

[00:51] it's going to give them a really good multiple upon exit.

[00:54] Alright, when they sell their company in the future.

[00:56] Now, let's start breaking down why this is such fucking terrible advice and idea in general.

[01:02] Now, if you even look at the entire info guru, etc, space that's out there, how many

[01:08] of them have had big successful software exists?

[01:12] Anyway, right, there's only one guy who may have an exit and that's Alex Becker, and

[01:18] it's because he made the flip from being a guru and selling courses and things like that

[01:23] to a true software entrepreneur.

[01:26] The problem is 99% of people want to continue to run their info business and then drive

[01:31] it to a software company, in which case they do both kind of shitty and never actually

[01:36] get a the exit, be sticky software.

[01:38] And so they end up just having a kind of shitty mix in between because there's another person

[01:42] who's trying to solve the exact same problem and doing it better than them because all

[01:45] they focus on is the software.

[01:47] And if you're getting into the software game and you think that like, oh, I'm just going

[01:50] to market it and it's just like, coolers and then people are just going to have to stick

[01:53] with it and choose them to it's not true, it's not going to happen.

[01:56] You have to be really good at software and really know a lot about the business and not

[02:00] only that software is one of the hardest businesses to get into for a variety of reasons.

[02:04] Number one, it costs money to develop stuff and you're like, oh, I'm going to have an

[02:07] offshore team has its own risks, right, and making sure that the product is actually what

[02:11] you want.

[02:12] But let's just assume that you have figured all that out, right?

[02:14] You have the cost of development, that's number one.

[02:16] Number two, the people you're competing in is now are software people and they are much smarter

[02:20] in general than I would say the guru world is at large.

[02:23] And that's because there's real money to be made there.

[02:25] But it is a high-stakes game.

[02:27] And if you look at the VC world venture capital angel, things like that, the reason that

[02:31] they're portfolio theory works is because they make a hundred bets knowing that two of

[02:35] them are going to carry the entire portfolio.

[02:37] The thing is is that when you are one of those hundred, the likely that your words

[02:40] succeeds is very, very low.

[02:42] And so what you do is you take your eye off the main game and then play the one in 50

[02:46] game, likely ahead of succeeding and then you end up basically destroying both and wondering

[02:50] and then what happens is sunk cost-fowlcy kicks in, you're like, well, I put all this

[02:54] money in, I put all this time and I said it publicly, my ego is now attached to it,

[02:57] et cetera, then you wanted to be like, I'm a smart cookie.

[02:59] I'm going to move above the space, but you're not.

[03:03] And they're not going to give you the multiple that you think you, they are.

[03:06] And here's why it's not that tech gets great multiples.

[03:10] So here me out on this, the future value of a company is based on a discount applied to

[03:15] future sales between now and the day that the company dies.

[03:19] And so the number of sales that they think they could potentially generate in terms of how

[03:22] big the market could potentially be and the likely hit that those sales occur.

[03:27] Okay.

[03:28] Now, if you have a software that turns people out and mind you in software world, they

[03:34] measure turn annually, not monthly annually.

[03:37] And so if you have less than or above 10% annual turn on your software, you're fucked.

[03:43] You're just a service business, right?

[03:45] And so you probably don't have those types of turn metrics, which is probably why

[03:48] you're software sucks.

[03:50] And so unless you're a hardcore true God, you know, balls to bones, software entrepreneur,

[03:56] and you know everything about that world and you're willing to risk it to go all in on

[03:59] this, which is why a lot of these guys use funding upfront because sometimes in a lot of

[04:03] software companies need to have funding in order to get the initial stuff off the ground so

[04:06] they can get market share and then they can start up selling people later, right?

[04:10] It's a much more competitive space.

[04:12] I just see so many people trying to do this and it's just, it's just not what you think

[04:15] it is, right?

[04:16] Like it's just based on how likely the sales you have in your business are to occur

[04:20] in the future.

[04:21] Okay.

[04:22] So insurance, for example, gets good multiples, but all, and it's because the likely

[04:26] that people can send you to stay and use the same insurance, insurance is high.

[04:30] It's not because tech is magic or insurance is magic or whatever is magic.

[04:35] If you have a service business that never loses anyone and each client continues to spend

[04:39] more through over time, you're going to have a very valuable business.

[04:42] Period.

[04:43] It's a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very

[04:48] very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

[04:50] very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

[04:53] very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

[04:55] very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

[04:59] very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

[05:33] very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very

[06:03] very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very

[06:33] , very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

[07:03] very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very

[07:33] $100 million, $500 million, check. They didn't get there by being more ons. So why would you expect them to buy your bullshit software that you'd tacked onto your service business to automate one thing, be like, well, I'm tech enabled certain,

[07:46] or not, you're either service or your tech period. And if you, if you are a tech company, then you will know your true tech company, because you wouldn't be watching this video, because you'll be like, oh, no,

[07:56] I, obviously, I love competing against these other guys you're trying to make bullshit software, right? And if you're not a tech guy, and that's not your world,

[08:03] then play the game your best at where you have a competitive advantage. Right? This is what happens. And I'm going to, I'll wrap it up in a second.

[08:11] People here that you can get 10 times top line, 20 times top, 50 times top line, right, for software. But that's not the vast majority of software's in general, that could solve.

[08:21] Not only that, most software's don't get sold at all, most software's fan, like I mentioned earlier in the VC angel example.

[08:27] But of the software's that sell most of them don't sell for much, they sell for parts. And then of the very, very, very small examples of the ones that hit those crazy multiples.

[08:34] It's because they have tremendous growth. They're not losing users. They're getting people off of word amount. The people are, they hit product market fit, which by the way is buy used hell.

[08:43] If the way that you get people into your software is that you sell them your service and then you tell them to use the software, it's not a good software.

[08:49] People need to buy it so that we know that the problem that we're solving is valuable to them. They need to use it regularly on their own.

[08:56] And then they tell other people specifically about the software. Until those three things occur, the software is not about it. Think about it.

[09:02] If you're just blowing people through your software or vehicle on people cancel when they cancel your service, it's just service.

[09:10] And you just added some weird texting that's completely nonsensical to the service offering that you have rather than just making a probably smarter affiliate relationship with someone.

[09:19] And getting probably more profit from that relationship because you don't have the cost of everything running the business.

[09:24] And if you send a series amount of traffic to somebody, you can probably negotiate 20, 30, sometimes 40, 50% affiliate relations depending on the type of software, et cetera.

[09:31] And so I say this to say as a big warning to the vast majority of the people that are out there.

[09:36] And this tends to happen right around that like, I want to say like 1 to 3 ish million dollar mark is when people think they're going to get cute.

[09:42] I'm going to get fancy. They're going to be like I'm smarter than this.

[09:44] Some smarter than these people. I'm really trying to get away from from on this gear. You're shit. All this serviceing these customers who don't understand my value.

[09:50] You're not that good. It's why they're not saying like that's the real. Like, and you look yourself from here. I'm like, they're not staying because we're not fulfilling our promises.

[09:58] And then that is where you actually start to make real money and build something that's sellable and has value.

[10:03] And I promise you that when you actually solve the problem, you're not going to want to sell because you're going to love the business.

[10:09] Because customers come highly recommended. You have a great reputation. People get more than they pay for.

[10:15] They bring their friends. You sleep well at night because you're employees enjoy servicing the customers that you have segmented as your ideal avatar.

[10:21] And those people are connected and send more people your way. And because people aren't turning out the back door left and right,

[10:27] you know that next month, your month is going to be bigger than it was this month, even if you do nothing.

[10:31] That's how a good business runs. And it takes time to get there.

[10:34] And people get impatient. And so they try and think that there's a shortcut. And there's a visit.

[10:38] There just isn't. You just have to be better and better takes work. And work takes time.

[10:42] Do all I got. Pleasination. Love you guys. Keep being awesome. I'll see you guys in the next one.

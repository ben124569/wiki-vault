[00:00] My mentor sold his company for $3 billion and I asked him how should I set up my wealth.

[00:07] In this video, what I'm talking about is one of the many components that he broke down for me in terms of how I

[00:11] should set up my wealth and my investment as an entrepreneur. Everything I'm going to break down is based on what that

[00:16] conversation was and what he explained to me. So right off the top he was like, listen, there's only two things that you can do with your money.

[00:22] You can either buy stuff with it or you can lend it to people and get interest on it. That's it.

[00:27] And so once you understand that those are the only two things you can do then you can start analyzing your decisions appropriately.

[00:32] It's like from a risk perspective, these are the ways that we decrease risk for the investments, especially if you're lending.

[00:38] The first is that we make sure that you are the top of the cap stack. Cap stack just means the stack of capital.

[00:43] So if you have multiple people who are lending or own something, who gets preferential treatment.

[00:48] So a preferred predator or somebody has preferred stock means that if something goes bad,

[00:52] that person gets paid out first. You can't have a liquidation preferences. I want to get into that

[00:57] but if you're top of the cap stack. So for example, if you lose your job and you can't pay

[01:02] your mortgage anymore, the bank is the one who gets your house because they are the preferred predator.

[01:06] So you don't get your house, your bank gets your house. Even though you put money into it,

[01:10] the bank put money into it too and they are the preferred predator. So they get your house even though you lost the money.

[01:15] Right? And so that is the first element of risk. The second one is like you want to be able to see at all times what's going on.

[01:21] And so that's called transparency. So that's what kind of reporting do you have? What kind of relation do you have?

[01:25] How clearly you don't have to get the access to the books? This is why publicly traded companies

[01:28] for example, you have lots of transparency. Right? So the second way you decrease risk is through transparency.

[01:34] The third is through liquidity. All right? So this is speed to money. All right? Money transferring

[01:39] from money to money, right? Is liquidity. And that means that you can get in and out of position

[01:44] very easily or very quickly or you can translate one asset into money and back into it very quickly.

[01:51] And that also is an element that decreases risk. If you have to hold onto something and you want to get rid of it and you can't,

[01:56] that means it's not that liquid which means you're at higher risk. So this is what I'm thinking about when we're lending money.

[02:00] Now the second thing is what are we going to look at for the investment, right? There's four pieces to what you need to look at for all your investments.

[02:09] The first is what is the yield? Is this thing going to pay me? Month over month. So for example,

[02:16] if I bought crypto, that's not going to pay me anything. What that's going to do is increase in value

[02:21] or our hope is that it's going to increase in value. That is one of those the greater full theory which is

[02:26] you buy and then you hope that there's somebody else in the future who's going to buy from you for more money.

[02:30] And that's appreciation. So you have equity growth. The next is the yield which I mentioned earlier,

[02:34] which is do I get cash flows? If I had a real estate property that would give me cash for a five-owned

[02:37] of business that would give me cash flow. Whereas if I'm buying an asset and hoping it appreciates like crypto or like gold or whatever,

[02:44] those are the things that were hoping that increase in value. The next is is it taxed

[02:47] advantage and what it means by that is if you have two different investments and one of them has a

[02:51] better tax structure based on laws than that would be a better investment. So this is why it's a

[02:55] variable because if you can have two things and one of them has this characteristic then it would make it a

[02:59] better investment. And is there a way that we can structure our investments so that we get a better

[03:02] tax treatment in the answers yes? Finally is a preservation of capital, right? Which is how likely

[03:08] am I to lose my money? Right? And what I can tell you is of all the guys that I know who are worth half a billion,

[03:14] billion, this individual is sold his for three billion or more is that they are far more far more and they just

[03:21] repeated over and over and over again. So if this is repetitive then taking it in because I've been dealing with it,

[03:25] you know on their side too is that it's way more about return of capital than return on capital.

[03:32] They're far more concerned with making sure that they keep their money than that they grow the money.

[03:36] And I think that having this defensive first strategy has been something that I've seen over and over and

[03:41] over and over again and you listen to Charlie Munger and you listen to Warren Buffett it's always

[03:45] never lose money, right? It's always never lose money and that's always the first and second thing that

[03:49] they're thinking about because any number no matter how big it is multiplied by zero it's still zero.

[03:54] So you can erase an entire you know lifetime of excellent decisions by one very poor decision which is why

[04:00] mitigating downside is so important. And this preservation of capital kind of relates to these three things that I

[04:06] mentioned earlier. So now that you laid this as the foundation is like you're an entrepreneur,

[04:11] all right? And so you're going to have buckets of wealth and this is how we're going to set it up for you.

[04:15] So the first is I have acquisition.com, which is our portfolio company. That's where all of our companies

[04:20] sit in, all right? And so for this you don't know us at the time of this making we're doing about $85

[04:26] million dollars year between our portfolio companies, all right? And what happens is that cash cash

[04:31] will generate it, right? Every day every week there's positive cash that's being generated from these businesses

[04:35] because there was the types of businesses that we like to work with. So there are businesses that

[04:39] generate you know losses for long periods of time and then they try and sell later like software

[04:43] companies tend to be in that we own one software company. But the vast majority of our portfolios

[04:48] asset like high cash flow generating businesses. There are three buckets that this cash goes into.

[04:53] All right? The first and simplest bucket is indexes. And the reason we do this for us specifically is that

[04:59] they are passive and they are truly passive. I don't have to worry about Coca-Cola and how it's going to run.

[05:04] I don't think about it. I'm not on their board meetings. I'm not giving them insight, right? I

[05:08] let Uncle Warren do that for me. But indexes are the first, probably first and 50% bucket for us

[05:15] in terms of where I'll wealth is. And there's some advantages to indexes that I'm going to share in

[05:18] second that you get that most people don't know about. All right? Especially people who don't have

[05:22] as much money yet. All right? And that's what we're trying to solve with this channel here. All right?

[05:26] Indexes and the reason we do this is because A is super passive and B is because I'm bullish on the

[05:30] long run that I think the economy is going to go over the long term. And so I want you just

[05:34] preserve my capital and not have to think about it. So I can immediately allocate the cash. And

[05:38] this is something that people don't talk about. If I can allocate all my money almost immediately

[05:42] every single month, then I get so much more growth over my portfolio over my entire career because

[05:47] if every, let's say I only did real estate for example. Well there's a time delay to allocate cash

[05:53] flow in real estate. You have to go find deals. You have to review the deals and then you have to

[05:58] make your offer secure the deal and negotiate and then you have to fund the deal and then there's

[06:02] the whole Escraper. There's all this, there's time delay, right? And so during the period of time is

[06:07] when that money could have been growing but it's not just from a, from a context of perspective

[06:10] for you, like the speed of allocating capital also can increase the returns. Now I'm not saying

[06:15] do things in rush because one of our money rules is mistakes, love, rush decision. All right? So we

[06:19] don't want to do that. But it's just that there is an a map out of component to allocating capital

[06:25] quickly. Indexes is our first big bucket here. The second big bucket is multifamily real estate. And

[06:31] the reason we do this multi-specifically people are like why don't you do single-family home because I have to

[06:35] buy like two houses a day if I was going to do single-family homes like just from the amount of cash

[06:39] for that we generate and what's saying that to posture and just saying realistically like it, it would

[06:43] it would become an entire business and we could do that but then it would become a business but that's

[06:47] not my main business. This is my main business or here running our portfolio company. So that's what

[06:51] I need to spend my time doing, not trying to buy homes and bird dogging and things like that.

[06:56] This is just not my thing. So I'd rather buy 300 units at a time and an allocator capital in that

[07:01] here's the specific reason for us why we use multi. If you can design yourself as a real estate

[07:06] professional which is 750 hours or more per year then you're able to take your depreciation of

[07:11] your assets like buying a big real estate thing and appreciating it's your regular income.

[07:16] So let's say I buy a building for $10 million dollars. All right and let's say I make $10 million

[07:21] this year. I'm just using simple math numbers. Okay. Now I'm able to take an accelerated depreciation

[07:26] of about 40% on this against my income. So this now I only get taxed on $6 million dollars.

[07:32] All right. Here's why this is cool because the 4 million right that I'm saving is probably

[07:37] going to see me about $1.1 million dollars in taxes and that goes straight to my network. That's

[07:42] $1.8 million that I can now put into indexes or I can put into building or whatever it is.

[07:46] And so because of that I actually are able to grow my wealth that even fast rate because this is

[07:50] tax advantage if you remember this guy. That is why we like multi-family. Now here's something

[07:54] cool that you may or may not have known about. When you're looking at indexes for example,

[08:00] one of the things that's awesome about indexes is that you can actually loan money or get loans

[08:05] on your indexes at about 1.5%. All right. That's crazy low interest rates and the reason is because

[08:11] it's a secured loan. And typically you can take about 50 to 60% of your indexes. So let's say I had

[08:16] $10 million here. I'm just using simple math. All right. Then it means that I would be able to take

[08:20] $56 million dollars of this and only pay one and a half percent on that and I could buy real estate.

[08:26] I could buy whatever I felt like doing using that money and basically paying nothing on it. And so for

[08:30] context, you know, one percent of $5 million is 50 grand. All right. So you have $5 million.

[08:36] If I can't make $50,000 a year or $75,000 a year if it's one and a half percent on that money in a year

[08:42] then I probably suck a investing and that's okay. But like you get the idea, right? Like if I can make

[08:47] even 10% right on my $5 million dollars then I would make $500,000 and it would cost me $50,000, $75,000 per

[08:53] year to carry that money. Great deal for me. And that is why I like indexes a lot too is because it

[08:58] actually allows us to still reinvest in the other things with super, super low cost low risk money.

[09:03] The third bucket here is cash slash spec. Technically cash inspector different things but I'm just

[09:09] going to put it here for sake of explanation. And the reason he told me to put this here is like there's

[09:14] always going to be things. He's like your entrepreneur. He's like you're always going to have little

[09:16] deals that come up and you want to have some drive powder or it's the term that you use on the

[09:20] sidelines so that you can deploy that opportunistically. Like for example, I think I recently told you

[09:25] guys about a $2.5 million debt note that we wrote that we'll probably make $3,400,000 on in about 90

[09:31] days. Right? So I'm going to give $2.5 million and then they're going to hold it for 90 days and then

[09:35] I'm going to get $3,000,000 back plus my original money. I only get those types of deals because I always

[09:40] have cash on me. And so people know that I always have decent amounts of cash and so they will hit

[09:44] me up and be like, hey, can you fund this deal? Can you you know underwrite this this note or whatever it is?

[09:50] And because they know that I have a lot of capital in hand, I have these opportunities that come

[09:53] towards me. Right? And so with that I can generate you know pretty good returns on having this stuff

[09:59] and I just like having me personally for my piece of mind having a certain amount of cash on the sidelines.

[10:04] Right? This was the investment strategy that he outlined for us. This is kind of our wealth strategy

[10:09] in terms of big picture of how we allocate our money. So the money gets generated, boom it goes here.

[10:16] We basically split it between indexes and multifamily. We can always use our indexes to generate

[10:23] more. We can usually take loans against that if we want to if we want to deploy stuff and get

[10:27] even better returns or whatever. And then finally we have our cash and specular stuff and I tend to have

[10:32] a little bit more cash because I am an entrepreneur because I am an entrepreneur I like to have that

[10:37] liquidity available to me at all times. All right and you'll notice here that this is not a very

[10:42] high risk portfolio. And the reason for that is because all my net worth is being generated in this bucket.

[10:50] Right? This is where the vast majority of my net worth has been created and that and that is where

[10:53] all my risk lies. Now you can make the argument and this is what you know he made to me. He's like

[10:57] it's not that high risk because you know what you're doing. diversification is a hedge against

[11:00] ignorance as Uncle Warren says. And so he's like you know what you're doing here and so it's not

[11:05] actually low risk but it's still the vast majority of your net worth which is why we can quote

[11:08] beat the market by big by big amount because we're actively involved in these companies. We have

[11:14] niche expertise in these industries and we know how to grow them out of much much, much faster

[11:18] rate than what the market does. But this is much more a preservation of wealth strategy than a

[11:25] especially these three buckets here than a true growth strategy. But this is how we set it up for me

[11:31] because I'm an entrepreneur and this is kind of how my risk looks in my life. And so hope you

[11:38] enjoy this video. The reason that I make this video and the reason this channel exists is because we're

[11:41] trying to grow our portfolio to a billion dollars a year in revenue and the only way we can do that

[11:45] is by reaching more entrepreneurs and helping them out and then hopefully gaining the opportunity

[11:49] to invest in their businesses and for everyone else who is an entrepreneur my goal is to help you

[11:53] grow your business and not sell anything at all. So I've got something really cool that's coming

[11:57] out soon. I'm really excited about this one a lot of time on it. But I hope you guys see

[12:01] our value in this video. I'll see you in the next vid. Keeping awesome.

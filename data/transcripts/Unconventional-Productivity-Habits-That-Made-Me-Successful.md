[00:00] In this video, I'm going to show you the handful of abnormal routines that I do that people

[00:05] have left at me for, but that I believe will serve you.

[00:11] First off, I have to bet I'm not the type of person who does cold showers and light stuff

[00:17] and red sonas and the orange glasses and the fingertips shoes and the biohacking and

[00:24] all that stuff.

[00:25] I don't really describe to that kind of methodology.

[00:28] I would say that most of the things that I've seen that have been quote productivity hacks

[00:31] really become to borrow something from my wife, procrastination hacks.

[00:35] It's people who love spending all their time making lists and not really doing.

[00:39] And so I don't do a lot of things on a regular basis, so I don't have a tremendously complex

[00:44] routine and that is I think because I would rather spend my time working.

[00:49] I'll give you a handful of things that have served me well.

[00:52] The first is that for, I would say the first and this is where I think is more valuable to people who

[00:56] are coming up. For the first probably eight years of my business career, I woke up around four

[01:01] clock in the morning just about every day. And part of that came because I started in the fitness

[01:06] industry and I was doing that anyways, but also because I didn't have to talk to anyone and tell

[01:10] about 10 a.m. And so that gave me about six hours of uninterrupted work time that I could really

[01:15] move projects forward. And so yes, that means the first thing I did every morning was I would wake

[01:20] up and I would start working. And I think that the morning really actually starts the night

[01:25] before. And so this is something I don't know if it's talked about as much. But for me,

[01:28] I can't, it's more difficult for me to go to sleep until I have thought about what I'm going to do

[01:32] the next day. So I feel like I have to clear my mental kind of like bandwidth and say,

[01:36] all right, what are the few things with folks on tomorrow? And I've never really given myself more than

[01:40] three things to do. And so it's usually one to three things. People like, was it two words,

[01:43] a three or is it one? I don't really believe in making rules around that stuff. So if I'm just going to

[01:49] be editing my book tomorrow, then that might be the only thing I have. If I have a couple of things

[01:52] that are going to take a little bit of time, then I might have three things on the counter. Right?

[01:55] And that's about it. Right? And so the first kind of habit around this is that I plan the

[02:00] night before. I know what I'm going to do with the moment I wake up and then upon waking up,

[02:05] I pretty much just start getting to work. And I have my first four, six hours at the day

[02:10] dedicated to moving those things forward. And for a lot of people, that's hard. But I think that

[02:14] so is being successful and you just have to pick what kind of hard you want, being robust hard.

[02:17] So is being successful. It's just one of them, you know, my get you close to your goals.

[02:21] So that's the first kind of habit that I would say that I do, that's maybe atypical,

[02:25] is that I don't have some crazy routine in the morning, besides Dr. Kupakofi. And that's about it.

[02:30] The second thing is I try and decrease the amount of decisions that I have to make throughout the day.

[02:33] And so for me, I think decisions that we make over and over and over again, I think are

[02:38] wasted one, especially if they're the outcome is pretty much moved. And so one of those things is like

[02:42] food. And so I eat the same thing every day for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. And that may sound

[02:49] crazy to you. But for me, I like what I have for breakfast lunch and dinner. And so I look forward

[02:54] to it every day. And I don't really have any stress that goes around that. Beyond that,

[02:59] this is very, very small. But if you've acquired a lot of belongings over your, you know, time period,

[03:05] trinkets and things like that, I think you gain a tremendous amount of attention from getting

[03:09] rid of those things. Which is probably why if you've ever like cleaned out your garage or cleaned

[03:13] out of storage closet, you feel better. It's like, oh, and all these like little attention

[03:18] that was just like left there. And every time I walked by, I was like, oh, I should do something

[03:21] about that. Well, trying clear as many of those things as you can so that you have as much of that

[03:24] bandwidth back. And I think that that kind of manifests itself in just better higher quality decisions.

[03:29] The third thing that I'll say that I would do is that someone different, so the first being the

[03:34] night before, early morning wake up, no real routine there besides just get to work. And the second

[03:39] being like, I ate the same things every day. The third piece is kind of the the night time side of it,

[03:45] which is I think it's more important to have a bedtime than it is to have a wake up time. And so

[03:50] you might, you know, hear me say, yes, I wake up at 4 a.m. But that might mean that it's 445

[03:55] some days. It might mean it's 310 some days. It might mean it's even 530 some days. I'm more inclined

[04:00] to just go to sleep earlier and wake up when I wake up than trying to, you know, get myself out of

[04:06] bed when I'm exhausted. And from all the very, very wealthy people that I know, they value the

[04:13] quality of sleep that they have, not that they're obsessed with it because I know that I can work

[04:17] on 4 hours of sleep for a very long period of time. But I make better high quality decisions

[04:22] when I'm well rested. And so the third kind of have around that is, I said don't want them for

[04:26] your bedtime rather than your wake up time. It's a tiny little hack and I think it'll, it'll do

[04:30] you a lot of good. And so for me, you might think, wow, that's not a lot of routines. And I think that

[04:36] there's something to that. When I hear about someone who says, like, oh, unless I, you know, do a polar

[04:43] plunge and I walk outside barefoot and I have all these things that happen, I don't think that,

[04:47] to me, that sounds like you're not resilient at all and that you can't handle stress at all.

[04:52] I want to be able to be resilient so that no matter what condition I'm in, I'm adaptable and I

[04:56] can survive and hopefully thrive. And so if I, it's me, again, somebody who needs to have, you know,

[05:01] they're, they're all of their pens in order and all of their, you know, they're 20 minutes

[05:05] adrenaline in the morning and then they have to read their book and then after that, they have to do

[05:08] their, their out loud ohms and they have to do this whole song and dance. When it's happening,

[05:13] you start creating superstition around how you work and that's bad. Because now you become

[05:19] reliant on that action in order to just be functional, not above functional because anything that

[05:24] gives you like a short term, but it's oftentimes just become a crutch over time. And so I'm very,

[05:29] very sensitive to superstitions and having crutches because I would rather just say, hey, I can wake up,

[05:35] I can drink a cup of coffee and I can get to work. And I think that a lot of times people who look

[05:39] into all these productivity hacks, looking to all these routines, looking to all this stuff,

[05:43] many times use that as a crutch to lean on, to feel productive rather than actually getting

[05:49] worked done. And so make picture, those are the things that have actually yielded me disproportionate

[05:54] returns. I've tried a lot of that stuff. I've tried the gratitude journals. I've tried the, you know,

[05:59] saying things out loud, the affirmations. I've tried all of these different things and the things

[06:03] that stuck, where the things that were simple. And I think that if you look yet, lots of successful

[06:09] people, the sleeping hours that they keep are wildly different, there's some people who work,

[06:13] do their best work between 10, you know, 10 PM and 4 AM. And they work night out. So I've got a friend

[06:17] of mine who's a billionaire who does that. And that's, he's like, Alex, I can't wake up and do work

[06:21] anytime before 10 AM. And I'm like, that's cool. Like, that's how he does it. And so I think it's more

[06:25] important to figure out what's sleeping schedule, do I get the best work done in? And when can I

[06:30] allocate time that is just my time to think? And as entrepreneurs, like the higher up we go,

[06:35] it's more about the decisions we make rather than the actions we take. And that's something that

[06:40] I've stuck with. And so as always, tier Alex and Mozi owner of Jim launch prestige labs, and Alan

[06:44] done, you know, 120 plus million were on pace for over 85 million this year. I make these videos because

[06:50] I hope that someone learns from some of the lessons and doesn't have to fall for the,

[06:54] the many traps along the way of the productivity hacks and the by-hacking and all this craziness

[07:00] that can just get in the way of just get it done. Do the board work. And you'll see the results.

[07:04] I'll see you on the exact.

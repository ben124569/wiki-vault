[00:00] Catch.

[00:01] Top, right?

[00:02] Now catch.

[00:04] Much easier.

[00:05] So this one idea will change how you think about business.

[00:08] It's keep simple, but not the way you think.

[00:11] Fundamentally, it's about how to make a more profitable business

[00:15] and doing this from the top down from a strategy marketing sales product delivery perspective.

[00:20] And I want to take you through an exercise first and then I'll talk about it afterwards.

[00:24] Let's imagine that I have a marketing campaign.

[00:25] And I want you to understand some of the benefits of my services and my product, right?

[00:30] So I might have four different benefits that I think are really, you know, really material

[00:36] that I want someone to know.

[00:37] Okay.

[00:38] And so the problem is the vast majority of marketing looks like this, ready?

[00:43] One, two, three, catch.

[00:45] Well, it's very hard to catch all four at the same time.

[00:48] But if I just said, hey, real quick, I want you to understand something.

[00:53] Catch, you'd probably be able to catch that.

[00:56] And so it's a great visual analogy for the value of a simple message.

[00:59] Can Siegel who wrote the book in St. Lee Simple talks about this when he was in his

[01:03] meaning of Steve Jobs.

[01:04] And that was an exercise that he took the marketing team throw.

[01:07] Whenever they'd want to start saying multiple points, it would he knew that it would eventually

[01:11] devolve into every single thing under the sun that we could possibly say about this thing,

[01:16] which meant that we hadn't done enough strategic thinking around what is the one thing

[01:20] that matters most.

[01:22] And so the saying that they live by, which I really love, find the most compelling point

[01:27] and communicate it in the most compelling way.

[01:28] I'll say that again because I think it's so important.

[01:30] You focus on the one most compelling point and then you communicate it in the most compelling

[01:34] way, a thousand songs in your pocket.

[01:37] Right?

[01:38] It's, I think, a discipline that has to be taken pervasively from the top down.

[01:44] It has to start with the business owner, has to start with the CEO, has to start with

[01:46] the founder.

[01:47] Whoever person is calling the shots in terms of what we're doing as a business.

[01:50] Because this level of simplicity, right, takes more work than complexity.

[01:54] And that's what's crazy about it is that complexity is less work than simplicity.

[01:58] Because complexity is typically the child of lazy thinking.

[02:02] We can't prioritize, we're not sure which one of these four things is most important,

[02:06] so we'll just say them all.

[02:07] We have these four features, rather than limit it to one and then make that one better,

[02:12] we're just going to see all four because we want to appeal to all sorts of different

[02:15] people.

[02:16] Most really big business ideas in my opinion are the opposite of what you would naturally

[02:21] do.

[02:22] Because if what people's natural instincts led them to do were the things that made

[02:26] business successful, then most people would have successful businesses and that's anything

[02:30] but true.

[02:31] And so it's the constraint of, a forcing yourself to say no, there are three things

[02:36] here.

[02:37] There is one of these that is more important and we have to keep bootling it down or chunking

[02:41] up the language such that this one point is the most compelling.

[02:44] And you're thinking, okay, well, maybe this is just only applies to marketing, right?

[02:47] No, it has to go all the way through because think about it.

[02:49] If you figure out that this one core promise or core feature, right, is the most important

[02:53] thing, then that informs our product strategy.

[02:57] What features are we going to build?

[02:58] What services are we going to deliver?

[03:00] And if we only have one to do, would it we spend so much disproportionate amount of time

[03:05] trying to make that thing exceptional?

[03:07] Like, you look at raising kings, right, the chicken shop.

[03:10] They have seven ingredients on the menu.

[03:11] Like, they arguably couldn't have fewer ingredients in order to make a meal.

[03:14] They've got toast, they've got fries, they've got chicken tenders and then they've

[03:17] got sauce and beverages.

[03:19] They're six and there's one more camera where it is, right?

[03:21] And so I think Coastal are something like that.

[03:23] But it was point being, they could have, like someone say, hey, have you considered adding

[03:27] an eighth item?

[03:28] Yeah, they probably thought about it.

[03:30] But the ability to say, this is what matters most.

[03:32] If we only did this one thing, would we accomplish all of our goals?

[03:35] And I think it's one of the most powerful questions.

[03:37] Frank Slutman who wrote the book Snowball talks about this one thing where he says,

[03:41] a lot of companies will take, you know, they'll have five objectives and ten, five

[03:45] sub-objectives and they're going to sub-objective, you know, nightmare, right?

[03:49] He says, if we cannot say what the one thing that's most important in the business,

[03:52] then the job of the CEO, that CEO has failed.

[03:55] And I'm guilty of this, too.

[03:57] So I'm not saying this is not me saying this from a pedestal.

[03:59] This is me trying to document my own thinking rather than say this is a sermon.

[04:03] Is that what one thing, if it were true, 12 months from now, would change everything

[04:09] for our business.

[04:10] And what's interesting is that when you ask that question, like, what one thing would

[04:12] have to be true?

[04:13] Like if we had a dedicated lead channel that we owned, that one thing would change everything.

[04:17] If we just had a great supply of talent for our HVAC company for new technicians, if we

[04:23] just did that by the end of the year, it would change everything for us.

[04:26] If we were just able to to pull cash flow from 90 days to 30 days for each sale that we do,

[04:32] that would change everything for us.

[04:34] Thinking about that as the what must be true, then becomes the most important business

[04:38] objective because you might have objective 2345.

[04:42] But if you just did one, then it likely makes 2345 one, a relevant two by the time you

[04:48] accomplish number one, 2345 might have changed because you will not have new resources

[04:54] and new assets at your disposal.

[04:55] And so you're basically trying to make a decision about variables before the board has

[04:59] changed from the decisions that you're ultimately trying to make.

[05:02] And one of the difficult parts, and this is the, this is the really nefarious one.

[05:06] Once you make that one simple decision like this is the priority, this is the

[05:08] thing, this is what we're doing, all systems go.

[05:11] Every department seeks to make this one thing true about our world so that it relates back

[05:15] to this business.

[05:16] Sometimes solutions take time.

[05:18] Sometimes you have to sit with the pain of an unbuilt bridge without building a second

[05:24] bridge.

[05:25] So let's say you know that let's use the technician example.

[05:27] You're like, man, we've got the phones ringing off the hook.

[05:29] I could expand my practice.

[05:30] I could expand my XYZ if I just had more talent to deliver.

[05:34] Right?

[05:35] And that boat, you know, once you realize that you might kick off some sort of recruiting

[05:38] search, you might kick off some sort of community or some sort of play where you get referrals

[05:42] from all these different networks that would generate technicians for you or internships

[05:46] or whatever, right?

[05:47] But the thing is, is that one month in, that still might not really have happened.

[05:51] As in, like, you might not have this over, you're this overflow of new town in the business,

[05:54] right?

[05:55] But you know that if that one thing were true 12 months from now, that's the only thing

[05:58] that matters.

[05:59] And so the hardest part, and this is a lesson I'm kind of making this public so that

[06:02] me sticking with it, too, is that sometimes you have a lot of talent.

[06:05] You have to let the little fires burn.

[06:06] Is that like, you could, and like, we sometimes do, and this is, I'm guilty of this.

[06:10] I will kick off a real meaty solution to a big thing.

[06:13] Like, if we do this, it's the only thing we have to do and we'll crush it.

[06:16] But then because I'm impatient in a human being, I'll be like, it's, you know, 30 days later.

[06:21] And I'll be like, oh my God, it's not solved yet.

[06:22] And then I'll want to try and solve it another way.

[06:24] When, in reality, me trying to solve it in two or three ways ends up just pulling resources

[06:29] from the one way that I know will work, but we'll take time.

[06:32] And so I would rather take the sure bets on the thing that had the absolute highest leverage

[06:37] impact on my business, rather than many small bets that might or might not work.

[06:41] Because the thing is, it's like, this is the death by a thousand paper cuts.

[06:43] And so it's, it's that, that one thing that then also simplifies what everyone's doing.

[06:50] So this is a absolute high level strategy thinking process.

[06:54] But what's really fascinating about this is, and so they talk about Steve Jobs.

[06:57] He has this great comparison between art of Western and Eastern art.

[07:01] And you're like, where's he going with this?

[07:03] I'll explain.

[07:03] So Western art, when most people imagine like creating art, they think of a blank canvas, right?

[07:09] Or blank document.

[07:11] And so then what you do is you add to that document, right?

[07:15] What's interesting is that the Eastern philosophy is opposed to this.

[07:18] So they think of it as like, you have this big slab of jade.

[07:21] And so all we're doing is removing the excess to reveal the art or the sculpture underneath.

[07:27] And so it's the difference between Eastern and Western philosophy.

[07:30] And as it applies to business, it's kind of the same way, which is like, when you delete everything that sucks about a phone, what remains is an iPhone.

[07:36] And so I think about that with services a lot.

[07:39] Because a lot of times it's so easy to just say like, okay, well, I'm going to add more to the canvas, right?

[07:43] But when you, when you think about it from, from pulling things away, it's like, what are all the distractions that I'm creating internal my business,

[07:49] but also to my customers?

[07:51] Because you think about that, that, that, that cripple paper, right?

[07:54] If I say, I'm going to help you with this one thing.

[07:58] And then just help with that one thing.

[08:02] That's it.

[08:03] And Jack Dorsey says this and I love this quote, he says, perfect every detail and limit the number of details.

[08:09] It's so elegant.

[08:10] Like, if you're going to do it, do it well.

[08:13] And the vast majority of things you can't do.

[08:15] This has been such a struggle for me, for my entire career.

[08:20] Because the more capable you get, the more resources you have at your disposal, the more opportunities present themselves.

[08:26] The more the harder it is to consistently say, no, jobs also said, focuses the number of amazing ideas that you say no to, right?

[08:34] I'm just as proud of the things we did as the things we didn't do is one of this famous quotes.

[08:38] And so the idea that they like saying over and over again was amazingly simple and simply amazing.

[08:44] How do we just think like, I'm just going to make one sandwich.

[08:47] And if I just made this one sandwich to be the best sandwich in the city, I will probably have lines out the door.

[08:52] I don't need to have 20 sandwiches because if I just make this sandwich the best sandwich.

[08:56] And I think about it from the experience of someone eating it, the experience of them waiting for it, the spirits of them ordering it.

[09:01] How I source the ingredients, how those are going to get combined at what temperature, in what order, right?

[09:05] Who's going to be the one providing them?

[09:06] Like, what are the price points in which all of these types of things are it's the obsession on the details, but we're limit, because you can't go deep if you have too many things.

[09:16] And fundamentally that's the problem is like, myself included.

[09:19] We all have too many things going on and you just can't go that deep when you're spreadsheet thin.

[09:24] And the thing is is that all of the outsize returns come on the end of the curve, right?

[09:29] So it's like, you do this work, do this work, do this work and it's only when you're like, okay, I'm at the 50% mark, meaning I'm like about average.

[09:36] Right? You're at the 75% mark, you're above average, you may be a little bit better, right?

[09:39] But not that much better. You're at the 90% mark, okay, now we're starting to see it.

[09:43] But the difference between 90th percentile and 95th percentile, boom, between 95th and 99 boom in terms of who captures the market.

[09:50] Who's the one that people just can't help but say good things about you, right?

[09:54] And so I just think about what are these need to believe?

[09:56] Where are the things that if I if I just did one thing, then if you're thinking about this, you're like, well, there's a lot of things that if I did this, who would come by business?

[10:02] We're not thinking in increments, we're thinking orders of magnitude.

[10:05] So yes, if you improve your sales, close right, you, your business will grow.

[10:08] If you bump your, you're margin by some percenture business will grow.

[10:11] If you increase your lead, sure, the business will grow.

[10:13] But I'm not talking about those improvements.

[10:15] Those are what I consider the sausage making a business.

[10:17] That's the daily that's the end of now that's just like how you run a business.

[10:20] I'm talking about what are the orders of magnitude changes, the bets that we're going to make with our additional resources.

[10:25] Because fundamentally, let's see, you've got, you know, 100 people who work for you.

[10:28] You can 10, you can be one, isn't that?

[10:30] Point is that you have X amount of people work for you.

[10:32] Maybe they're at 70% utilization, 80% utilization.

[10:35] They've got a little bit of a little bit of bandwidth on top of the sausage making.

[10:38] They have to do every day to keep the trains going.

[10:40] So you have to scoop that little 20, 30% right?

[10:44] And you have one real bet that you can make on it.

[10:47] And so it's like, you want to make that bet worth it.

[10:49] What's interesting is like, how do you, how do you come up with these ideas, right?

[10:52] And so I think this level of like, how do we just remove everything that doesn't matter?

[10:56] And I can try to reverse my thinking process.

[10:58] This way, this is a lot like, um, munger's, uh, invert, like,

[11:01] okay, if I wanted to destroy my business, what I do, like, it's a really powerful frame.

[11:05] This is a different frame, which is how much can I take away and still have it be good.

[11:10] And not only be good, but it probably is better.

[11:13] And so I'll give you a real good example.

[11:14] Uh, in the school games, uh, we, we basically used to have more calls that we did,

[11:20] and we had more stuff that we put in the community.

[11:22] We had like three a week, and then we also had like,

[11:24] content was getting dumped in there.

[11:26] And basically, the number of reasons that people were canceling was overwhelmed.

[11:29] It was not, I need to provide more value.

[11:31] It was, I need to provide more value per second in fewer total seconds.

[11:36] And so rather than say, okay, so what we did was we removed two of the

[11:40] three calls, set kept it to one, and we moved the big download for a month and

[11:44] month to one's a quarter so that people could get on top of it, right?

[11:47] And we removed some of the things that were native and turned on inside of the app,

[11:53] so that people would have fewer things to do when they got in.

[11:56] So they were like, oh my god, there's so many things I have to do.

[11:58] Uh, I can't think about it and then they leave, right?

[12:00] And so we won't kind of like, you want to, like, you only introduce something when it's

[12:04] required or necessary for that person to get the, the desired value.

[12:08] Rather than say, here's all the different things you can do.

[12:09] It's like, well, why don't we just do this one thing that most people find valuable first

[12:13] and then perfect that step?

[12:15] And then once we've done that, maybe we'll show the next step.

[12:18] If you're actually subscribed into this, this ideology, which is something that I'm

[12:21] really trying hard to, I'd say like the inversion process is how I've made a lot of strategic

[12:25] decisions and I'm also thinking more and more often with this, this frame of one, which is

[12:31] if I can't decide what the one most important thing is, then I'm not doing my job and I need to

[12:35] think about it longer because the thing is, is that one provides more efficiency than just about

[12:40] any strategy.

[12:40] You want to cut costs, you want to improve your margins, do one thing.

[12:44] There's way fewer things to do.

[12:46] And if you do one thing, you also need to have way fewer meetings about it because there's only one thing.

[12:50] And when you have just one thing, you don't need to have lots of people at the meetings.

[12:54] You just have a very small group of very smart people.

[12:56] And fundamentally, that's how these products start to get organized.

[13:00] And the easiest way to screw up a project like this is to give it too much time.

[13:06] And so if it is simple, you can also do it faster.

[13:09] So you can say in 12 weeks, and it doesn't, what's crazy about this is that you can do projects,

[13:13] even at like huge company levels in 12 weeks because you have more resources.

[13:18] And so just thinking, what is the one thing that matters most?

[13:21] If I'm not sure, what are all the things that I can delete away and have it still be valuable?

[13:25] And if I do know what that one thing is, how deep on that one thing can I go?

[13:29] Because if I made this one thing true at the end of the year, all of my other problems would shrink into a relevant.

[13:33] They would no longer matter.

[13:35] It makes the noise go down.

[13:37] But the thing is, is that you have to subscribe to this philosophy through and through.

[13:39] Like you have to believe in it, boss to bones.

[13:42] Because you'd think you're overwhelmed.

[13:43] I promise your team's 10 times more of a well because they don't know what direction you're in,

[13:47] because you're changing it all the time because you have so many different conflicting priorities.

[13:50] And so having this focus of one is easy to communicate, people remember it,

[13:55] because there's only one crumple piece of paper.

[13:58] It's easy to sell because it's one thing and you can just make that point as compelling as

[14:03] you're seemingly possible.

[14:04] On your delivering on product or services, you just perfect that one result, that one deliverable.

[14:10] A lot of marketing agencies just expand and expand and expand their breath of what they do,

[14:13] all these different services they tackle, and talk about, now if you're in an enterprise value business,

[14:17] those companies, if you're serving Fortune 100, it's a little bit different in use case there.

[14:21] Because for them, the one thing is full integration.

[14:24] Right? Like that would be like chunked up one thing for that business.

[14:28] If they actually had one person that could globally support their business, then that would be the

[14:32] one big thing we try and solve for. But many businesses, it's like if you just got them leads consistently,

[14:38] they would be happy. Like you don't need to offer these other services, the other quote,

[14:41] value benefits because if you just did the one thing that mattered, they wouldn't care about anything else.

[14:46] And remember there was this moment in Jim Lodge when we had a handful of Jim Lodge

[14:51] reached out and said, hey can we hop on a call? And I said, sure. And we're like, hey,

[14:56] we're trying to prove the product, and they just cut us off and they were like, we just need leads.

[15:00] Like just more leads. That's it. Like if you just give us more leads, we'll be happy.

[15:04] And so it was one of those like, you know, it's the economy stupid. Right? It's kind of like the

[15:10] present. Like if you just fix the one thing that matters. And if it sounds like I'm hammering this a lot,

[15:15] it's because I'm hammering it into my own brain. And if you think of like if you're to deconstruct this,

[15:19] like I love this little quote of to achieve great things, to ingredients are needed, a plan,

[15:25] and not enough time. And so it forces you to prioritize so that you could actually do the things

[15:30] that matter most. And I think that this is something that I'm trying to artificially do. You see like Elon

[15:34] talk about this for the J.E.E. on just pretend he's cool for this conversation. You're also wrong.

[15:40] Anyways, point being, if you see the rate of innovation that they're able to do across the

[15:45] companies that he owns, a big part of he talks is accelerating timelines, which is making

[15:49] unreasonable goals because the unreasonable goals create a forcing function for performance.

[15:54] And this has also been a brychechsky talks about this from Airbnb. There's a bunch of other

[15:59] why commonators founders who talk about this, where they're like, if you want to speed up something

[16:02] happening, number one, big public goal, number two, make it really aggressive on timeline, number three,

[16:09] check up frequently. Number four, remove people who shouldn't be on the project because they just

[16:15] create more communication cycles and more waste and more people to talk and get approvals from.

[16:22] Fundamentally, you have to make bets and sometimes you just have to let people go.

[16:25] As in, let them work, let them cook, right? Because if you get out of their way a lot of times,

[16:30] if you have a clear goal, clear objective, you're checking in regularly, you don't need to do

[16:34] much more than that. And so this is something that I'm half shouting at myself,

[16:37] as a reminder of the few things that matter most, and if I do not have that one thing for my team,

[16:42] then I have failed not them. So that is my insanely simple. It's been top of mine,

[16:46] because I just read a couple of books that mentioned jobs recently. It's been really valuable for me.

[16:49] And so when I'm thinking about my own marketing campaigns, I'm like, what is the one most compelling

[16:53] thing I can bring up? And how can I say that one thing in the most compelling way?

[16:57] Hey, if you enjoyed this, I had one of my best presentations of all time where I talk about how to

[17:02] accelerate how you get to your goals, whether they be financial, physical, whatever,

[17:07] by focusing on leverage. And so it's the first real presentation I made after basically getting into

[17:14] this whole YouTube world. And it was just kind of like compiled from years of me thinking about

[17:19] wealth creation. And if that's an interesting view, you can click and watch it here. Enjoy.

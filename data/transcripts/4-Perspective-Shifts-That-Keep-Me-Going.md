[00:00] In March of 2019, my wife and I were walking together after just having finished a $4.4 million

[00:07] month.

[00:08] And she turned to me and she said, Alex, let's just shut it all down.

[00:12] She's like, I'm so tired of this.

[00:13] I'm so burnt out.

[00:14] I just don't want to do this anymore.

[00:17] And it was at that moment that I realized that in order to progress in the entrepreneurial

[00:21] game, we had to change the way we operated, the way we thought.

[00:25] And so if you were an entrepreneur and you were a European business owner, the number

[00:29] one thing that I've seen that creates success is longevity, meaning that you can continue

[00:34] to play the game.

[00:35] Because at the end of the day, none of us is going to quit business or hopefully not quit

[00:38] business.

[00:39] And so in order to decrease the likelihood that we quit, which is the only way to fail, we

[00:43] have to think through our problems with the defined framework.

[00:48] And so rather than focus on the actual framework of the decision making, what I want to

[00:51] do is focus around the state in which you can manage your own thoughts.

[00:56] And so I've had to deal with plenty of stressors, as you can imagine.

[01:00] So if you're stressed in your own business right now, like, you know, add a zero to whatever

[01:03] your revenue is and you'll have 10 times the potential for stress if you were 10 times bigger.

[01:07] Or 100 times this stress, if you were 100 times bigger, which depends on who's listening,

[01:12] we may be that for you.

[01:13] And so I can tell you truthfully that the way that I've been able to eliminate pressure,

[01:18] which is created along Jevity in the game for me, has been through four strategies that

[01:22] actually work in the real world for me.

[01:25] So the first that I do whenever I have any kind of negative situation is I go a thousand

[01:31] x-negative, all right.

[01:33] And then I reevaluate.

[01:34] So let me explain what that means.

[01:36] So if, for example, there's something that's bad that happens.

[01:39] We get a bad review where we get a client subset or I have an employee who says something

[01:44] bad to another employer, a employee that's key leaves or someone tries to, you know,

[01:48] a competitor steal stuff and then starts bad.

[01:50] Whatever it is, right?

[01:51] There's a million problems in GoVististry, if cash flow issues are, where you can't make

[01:54] pay, well, whatever it is, right?

[01:57] I like to think of this one as my first, this is my first line of defense, the first thing

[02:00] I think about is, if this were to happen a thousand times more, right?

[02:05] And this works really well with what I would consider like minor to medium-sized grievances.

[02:09] So things that happen that are kind of everyday business that can, you know, bother you

[02:13] for a day or two days or a week, right?

[02:15] Well, if you can just shorten that loop of that cycle of you being disturbed, because

[02:20] the thing is, there's lots of those things are going to happen every single week.

[02:22] A lot of times, you just don't know about them, right?

[02:24] Depending on the size of your business.

[02:25] And so I just happen nobody knows.

[02:28] So first off, I like to think about that.

[02:30] But second is, I'll do this, right?

[02:32] Which is all imagine that every day in my life this happens, whatever that thing is, right?

[02:38] Customers upset.

[02:39] Now, obviously, if it's a course, you have to resolve it.

[02:42] But in terms of like, it happening in my affective or my emotional reaction to it, then I think

[02:47] to myself, well, this happened every single day and this happened every hour of every day.

[02:51] At some point, I would become desensitized to it, right?

[02:53] Because I had so much stimulus to this, I would not be able to have an emotional response.

[02:57] And so when I think and I imagine myself experiencing this negative thing over and over and

[03:01] over and over and over again, it's called negative visualization, then when it's happening

[03:04] is I become immune to it.

[03:05] And so I think to myself, well, if I can become immune to it after a thousand tries, I can

[03:10] become immune to it on the first try.

[03:12] Because means nothing has actually changed only when I perspective on the occurrence.

[03:16] And so doing, you can shortwire yourself to that end outcome and then fast forward it to

[03:20] the present so you can live the rest of your day or less if you're weak without being

[03:24] emotionally disturbed.

[03:25] And when you do that, at least for me, I feel like I make better decisions.

[03:29] And so I think for most of us as entrepreneurs and business owners, we are judged by the

[03:32] marketplace, by the quality of our decisions.

[03:34] That's ultimately what it is, right?

[03:35] It's just how good are the quality of the decisions that we make.

[03:38] And so if I can decrease the likelihood that I make bad decisions and I can do that

[03:41] on regular basis, then this is something that protects my mind.

[03:44] And candidly, it's what makes life worth living.

[03:46] The second thing that I'll do is that when I'm preparing for something that I need to start

[03:53] doing, right?

[03:54] Because there might be habits or things that you need to start doing.

[03:56] This is a slightly different example, but it's giving you the four different strategies

[04:01] that it works really well for me.

[04:02] The second one is let's say you wanted to start working out because you're like, you know,

[04:05] I've been neglecting my health or you know, you don't start eating healthy, whatever it is,

[04:08] right?

[04:09] Those are fitness examples, but just go with me.

[04:12] What I will do is I will expect the worst circumstance, all right?

[04:17] So rather than saying, okay, I'm going to go work out and feel excited, right?

[04:22] To go work out, I'm super pumped.

[04:24] What I want to do is I want to plan and prepare my mental state for when it times to work

[04:28] out, when it comes time to work out, I'm going to be exhausted.

[04:31] I'm not going to have slept well.

[04:32] I'm going to have a lot of business stress.

[04:34] And so I have to expect that going into every workout.

[04:36] Now if I don't have that happen, then it's a bonus.

[04:40] Rather than expecting nothing to be my mental state and then when something bad does happen,

[04:45] then I have this reason, right?

[04:47] And so it really does go into truly expecting the worst case scenario and making the pre-form

[04:54] decision to act anyways despite that because you have plan for it.

[04:58] So most people, most humans, have really good psychological resilience if we brace for it.

[05:03] So if you're about to give someone bad news for example, you actually have to let them

[05:06] hey, this is bad news.

[05:07] Hey, you made what it's up down for this.

[05:08] These people actually are very resilient if you give them a moment to emotionally brace

[05:11] themselves.

[05:12] And so what we're doing here is using this pricing technique on ourselves in advance of a

[05:17] situation that is likely to occur at some time between now and when we die, especially

[05:21] if it's a habit that has to be ongoing.

[05:23] And so what I do is I emotionally brace for the worst scenario.

[05:29] All right?

[05:30] That's number two.

[05:32] The third thing that I do, and this is probably the one that I use the most, it's really

[05:37] the one that I use the most.

[05:38] Actually, I'll say that one for last.

[05:40] A different version of this, the emotional brace is an extreme version, right?

[05:45] So kind of this is imagine the thing that you just had happened that bothered you for a

[05:49] thousand times, then it stops affecting you.

[05:51] The second one is you emotionally brace yourself.

[05:54] The third one is you imagine worst case.

[05:59] All right?

[06:00] Now the point here is kind of like a pain anchor, okay?

[06:03] And so what I mean by pain anchor is it gives you perspective on your current issues.

[06:09] So for example, whenever you've had a family member die or someone close to you die or

[06:14] somebody even have a pet die, depends on what you're at and you're like, right?

[06:17] If you have something that was painful for you, right?

[06:20] All of us benefit, we get the gift of perspective from those who die.

[06:23] That's the one of the final gifts that any death occurs that's in your proximity will

[06:26] give you, right?

[06:28] And so for me, I think about that.

[06:31] I think of a big situation, I really like trying to soak myself in it, right?

[06:34] Really trying like put it on and walk around and what that painful state would be.

[06:38] Whatever worst case scenario I can imagine might be death of a spouse, might be death of a parent,

[06:43] whatever, right?

[06:44] Or child, something horrific, right?

[06:46] But if I can truly allow myself to go there, then what happens is I get so much context

[06:53] and perspective on the little thing, like somebody bashing a piece of content or someone's

[06:59] saying that they hate your ad or whatever, it might be the thing that is deriding you.

[07:03] And all of a sudden that problem becomes massively minimized, right?

[07:07] It becomes almost inconsequential.

[07:09] And what I found is that over my life in the business, there are so many, there's an infinite

[07:14] amount of problems.

[07:15] It's truly, there's an unlimited amount of problems.

[07:17] I could think of so many things we should be doing, or we could be doing better, or should

[07:20] not have happened, right?

[07:22] But it's only because we put the word should in front of it that we have an expectation

[07:25] that is different in the reality, which creates the friction in our minds, creates the

[07:30] dissonance, it creates the unhappiness that we have.

[07:33] And so if I can imagine the worst case scenario and then actively minimize my current situation,

[07:38] then I usually can get right through it.

[07:41] And most times what I found is that most problems shrink into a relevance within broader

[07:46] context.

[07:47] They actually never get solved.

[07:48] We just realize that we just don't care, and that they are no longer meaningful

[07:52] to us.

[07:53] And so that has been something that's been very useful for me as we've grown, because

[07:56] frankly, the bigger your company gets, the more ability and potential you have to become

[08:00] stressed.

[08:01] And I think most of us are here for freedom.

[08:03] And so if you want freedom, then you have to, at least for me, I have found that I have

[08:06] to manage my mental state in order to continue to make high quality decisions.

[08:09] And so that leads me to the last one, which is probably my favorite and most used one that

[08:14] I use on anything.

[08:16] And this may, this may bother some of you, and that's okay.

[08:18] This isn't end.

[08:19] Sorry.

[08:20] Universe.

[08:22] This is a, this is a world where you that I have.

[08:23] So if you are, if you are, you know, don't, don't be trigger, you know, don't, don't take

[08:29] offense to this.

[08:30] But I'm telling you what has worked for me.

[08:32] And so I believe that the universe will continue to expand until eventually everything

[08:38] becomes a fine mist.

[08:39] Over a long enough time horizon.

[08:40] The sun will give out.

[08:41] All stars will extinguish.

[08:43] And then everything will just become a fine mist.

[08:45] And as silliest that may sound, it means that anything that we do, this video,

[08:51] anything that I accomplish in this world will eventually disappear and be meeting

[08:55] with.

[08:56] And so some people find that incredibly depressing.

[08:59] I don't.

[09:00] I find that to be incredibly meaningful because it means to me that I'm allowed to,

[09:05] I am the only person that describes meaning to anything.

[09:11] Because it means that nothing has inherent meaning.

[09:13] And so that means that when I have any stressors in my life, I'm saying that I'm choosing.

[09:17] My brain is choosing to make meaning out of this.

[09:19] And when there was no meaning to be made to begin with.

[09:22] And so by doing that, I can play the notes of the piano of meaning that happen across

[09:27] the occurrences and circumstances in my life.

[09:30] And so when I think about it in this context, everything shrinks into a relevance.

[09:34] And so a lot of the concepts around like, I want to build a legacy.

[09:37] I want to make an impact.

[09:39] I want to leave a dent in the universe.

[09:42] You're not.

[09:43] You're probably not going to leave a dent in the universe.

[09:44] And even if you made some big advancement within 500 years, like it'll probably be

[09:49] forgotten.

[09:50] And that would be like if you're the top point zero zero zero zero one percent, right?

[09:53] It's unlikely.

[09:54] But it is 100 percent likely that over a long enough time horizon, everything will disappear.

[09:59] And by doing that, for me, it decreases the pressure that I put on myself.

[10:04] For having to, I must, I should, I have to, like, I can't live without those thoughts

[10:11] that strangle me.

[10:12] There's other things that destroy my ability to make decisions because I come way more

[10:16] emotional as a result of them.

[10:18] And so whenever I have any kind of bigative occurrence or stressors that come up in my

[10:22] life which are inevitable, I use this as my ultimate frame of reference.

[10:27] This is my ultimate trump card that I use to keep my emotions at bay.

[10:32] And ultimately say, I am the master of my own universe.

[10:36] I get to decide what has meaning.

[10:39] And for me, I'll tell you what I have found most meaningful for me is that my purpose in life

[10:45] to, to my knowledge at this point is to learn.

[10:49] I love learning.

[10:50] And so that is why I make these videos because I feel like I am able to better learn

[10:56] how to think.

[10:57] I'm better learned.

[10:58] I'm better learn.

[10:59] I'm better learn all of the aspects of everything by teaching it, right?

[11:02] And I'm sure if you ever did a book report when you were in high school, you learned the

[11:06] one chapter.

[11:07] You had to do your book report on or give a presentation on way better than any of the

[11:09] other chapters because when you have to teach something, you have to learn it better.

[11:12] You have to learn the nuances of what makes something work.

[11:15] And so for me, even cataloging these things, been useful for me because I think these are

[11:19] all the things that I do.

[11:21] Huh, but now I have a process that I can continue to use, use haphazardly just because

[11:26] I've just trained myself over time doing this.

[11:28] And so I don't know where you're at in your business career.

[11:31] If you're at, you know, you know, it's seven figures, right?

[11:32] Eight figures are multi figures, you have multiple companies.

[11:34] Whatever it is, right?

[11:35] This has been so personally impactful for me that it has helped me be in this for the long

[11:42] haul because if nothing has meaning, except for what I choose to give meaning, then it

[11:47] means I can choose to only play games that I find meaningful.

[11:52] And by extension, I will not fall out of the game or quit because the thing that I'm doing

[11:57] is the thing that I derive the most meaning from.

[12:00] And so I will be able to outlast longer players per suit.

[12:04] And what happened is for me, my life becomes a glorification to an ID faster and very close

[12:12] to the bottlenecks that you have.

[12:13] So for me, I think like this, I will do, everybody can check out one of my next videos that

[12:18] are coming out.

[12:19] I'm going through courses.

[12:20] The trends are going to make a sense of the lessons that I have more and more entertaining,

[12:23] more educational, have more stories woven into them so that hopefully I can transfer these

[12:27] things to someone else because that is what I find meaningful, not because it is eternally

[12:31] meaningful, but just because that ideal to me has meaning.

[12:34] And so that is something that I believe is eternal.

[12:38] Values are eternal, values in the universe.

[12:40] And so for me, I choose to dedicate my content to those ideals.

[12:46] And so anyways, I hope you find value in this.

[12:48] I hope this is interesting to you, subscribe, like all that jazz, and have an absolutely

[12:54] wonderful day where you can create all the meaning you want or remove all the meaning from

[12:58] the negative things that occur in your life using some of these four hacks.

[13:01] So lots of love, keep being awesome, and I'll catch you in the next vid.

[13:03] Bye.

[00:00] In this video, I'm going to walk you through the four

[00:02] scare-sist highest value skills that exist on Earth.

[00:06] It is the cornerstone upon which every single top 100 or even top 50 billion air has built their wealth.

[00:14] Before I dive in, just as heads up, if you're new to the channel, my name is Alex Shemozi.

[00:17] I own Acquisition.com. It's a portfolio of companies that is about 85 million dollars a year.

[00:21] All right, the reason I make this channel is a lot of people broke and I don't want to be one of them.

[00:24] Let's dive in. Before we get into each of the four skills, all right.

[00:27] An important distinction I need to make here is that when I'm saying these are the scarce

[00:31] of skills, it is because of two major things. One is that the assumption is that we are doing these

[00:36] skills at maximal scale, all right. Number one. Number two is that these are not binary skills.

[00:43] It's not a habit, I don't have it, but it's to what extent do I have it or to what degree do I have it.

[00:48] How masterful am I in the skill? And so these are the four skills that exist and you will see a clear

[00:55] corollary between the four ways to create leverage. So the first and easiest one for everyone to

[01:02] understand and that's why I'm going to start with it is the ability to raise and multiply money,

[01:08] which means you have the skill of getting money from other people and you can allocate that money

[01:13] in a way that it multiplies at a higher rate than anything else. Right. If you have that skill,

[01:19] you can create endless unlimited fortunes and again at scale, which means you can get lots of money

[01:26] and you can handle massive sums of money and you can multiply it because of how good you are at the

[01:34] skill. So that is scaricist high value skill number one. These are not an order. These are just the top four.

[01:40] Any of these four, if you have them, can build you to a billion dollars plus. Number two is the ability

[01:48] to capture and multiply attention. All right. And so think about a Joe Rogan for example. Right. He's

[01:56] able to build this empire that he has because he's able to capture attention and multiply attention,

[02:02] which is a function of medium. Mark Zuckerberg, he was able to capture attention, get people to look at

[02:07] his app and then tell their friends, multiply attention. And so the ability to capture and multiply

[02:12] attention is the second scarce and high value skill that exists. So right now, if you're not making

[02:19] the money that you want to make or you're poor, it's because you're usually not allocating your time

[02:24] to the highest value scaring skills that exist. And oftentimes these skills are not skills that can be

[02:31] top but there are skills that can be learned, which is a go at that gap in a Volvo, which I like a lot.

[02:35] And oftentimes you'll know that it's not just one component of this. It's not just being able to raise

[02:40] money, it's being able to also allocate it and multiply it. It's not being able to just capture

[02:44] attention. You have to be able to use that attention to then multiply the attention on its own organically

[02:49] at knowing criminal costs. That's the key point is that you have to be able to multiply it at no

[02:53] incremental cost to you. That's how you get unlimited leverage. Number three. And this is one that a lot

[02:59] of people are going to trip up. So I'm probably say this a couple different ways. The ability to return

[03:04] time to other people at no incremental cost to yourself at scale. So for example, if I can save

[03:12] everyone on planet Earth 10 minutes every day, I will be a billionaire. Think about that. And so the

[03:18] way to deconstruct that is to think, what is something that lots of people spend time on? Is there

[03:24] a way that I can automate this? And again, zero incremental cost, which means this is often going to

[03:29] be some sort of technology or software solution. No incremental cost to me, which means that if I build

[03:35] this thing one time, I can save everyone time forever. That is a way to build a fortune. That is

[03:42] a way to build billions and billions of dollars of wealth. That is scarce high value skill number three.

[03:50] So you can return time to other people. You can decrease the effort to sacrifice that they

[03:57] experience in their lives that they do not want to experience. And because it's at no incremental

[04:01] cost, you can sell that thing to everyone because everyone will pay something for their time.

[04:08] Now the amount may be widely varied. But if it cost you almost nothing, you can capture an entire

[04:14] marketplace by giving them time back. What did Google do? Give everyone time back. Now they obviously

[04:21] they monetize through advertising. But everyone was looking for something. Normally, it would take

[04:27] longer to look for something and then they consolidated it in one place. They saved everyone time.

[04:32] The fourth high value, scarce skill on planet earth is to be able to influence the behavior of others

[04:42] at mass scale, at no incremental cost to you. So you look at someone like Jesus or any prophet.

[04:50] I'm not saying he's a prophet that's not my point. My point is if you look at the mass leaders,

[04:54] probably shooting and brought it up otherwise people can trigger. Point is, is that there are people

[04:58] who have walked this earth. Thomas Jefferson. You know what I mean? People who have had massive

[05:03] influence over other people and their subsequent behaviors they take as a result. And so this is the

[05:11] ability to change people's minds. If you can help people, change their beliefs and change their thoughts,

[05:19] you will change the way they behave, which is why when people come to a new faith, all of a sudden

[05:24] you see this massive change in behavior. It's because the operating system and the lenses

[05:30] through it's they see the world, the perspectives that they weigh their judgments using,

[05:35] have shifted. And so if you change the decision making calculus, you change all of the

[05:39] downstream behaviors that happen as a result. And if you can do this in concert, at scale,

[05:46] you can age change the world, but be you can also make a ton of money. If you look at the best

[05:50] persuaders of our era, there are ones who for them I would argue aggregate it power because

[05:57] so people at a certain point you run out of needs for money, you start looking for power.

[06:01] And so if you have the ability to massively influence other people at scale, at no incremental cost

[06:09] to you, you have the fourth scarce high value ROI skill that exists. So right now,

[06:17] bozination, what it did. If you're looking for ways to increase your wealth,

[06:23] you can see that all four of these things are core Larry to the four types of leverage that exist.

[06:30] These are how forward since they're created. Leverage number one is on labor and actions on

[06:37] behalf of other people towards your goals. So other people do stuff for you. That was the

[06:43] fourth one when I just mentioned. All right, that's a run labor work and basically actions other

[06:47] people take. When I talked about money multiplying, right, that is leverage using capital.

[06:54] So the ability to maximally raise and multiply capital at scale is a high value skill. The third

[07:04] is being able to give people their time back. What we're talking about, this is a good friend

[07:08] of mine who's a technologist, he says all technology automates luxury and luxury is typically

[07:14] a function of convenience effort and sacrifice. And so we look at the places where people spend time

[07:19] and spend effort and sacrifice and we return it back to them at no incremental cost. That is how you

[07:25] create scale using technology, right, and the key resource for giving people back is time.

[07:31] And then the fourth and final one is media, all right, and so using media and then you're able

[07:38] to multiply media via the capturing and multiplication of attention because ultimately media is just

[07:46] the substrate through which impressions are conveyed to other people signals that they are

[07:50] interpreting through their senses. The idea is how can we capture as many senses as we can and then

[07:56] get those senses to get other people plugged into our thing. And then in so doing it will compound.

[08:01] And so one of the key notes to note about each of these four things that I just mentioned is that each

[08:05] of these skills compound, they are not multiplicative, they are not additive, they are not incremental,

[08:12] they are compounding, which means they are exponential in nature. A lot of people say it's an

[08:17] exponential growth, they don't even know what exponential means, but it means that it multiplies unto itself

[08:22] and then each time it multiplies itself bigger upon itself, not just like we we two acts every year,

[08:28] but it would have to be when we incremental to 10% 10% 10% growth that is where it's compounding.

[08:35] And each of these in the form of labor, people are influence, people tell other people,

[08:41] people tell other people, they do the thing for you and it compounds. With capital, the money that

[08:46] you multiply, get you more money, which you then multiply, it compounds. The time you say people

[08:51] more time, which is then you get you more people to say time for and it compounds.

[08:56] With attention, you capture the attention, you multiply the attention because those people tell other people

[09:01] and then the attention comes back. And so each of these are quadratic in nature in terms of the skills

[09:06] and those, my friends, are where you focus your time if you want to create a fortune. And so you can

[09:11] look at your skills right now and say which of these skills do I lack or which of these four buckets

[09:16] do am I currently at least working somewhat directionally towards. And then we can again think this is

[09:21] a binary checklist. If I have the skill or I do not have the skill, but to what degree,

[09:25] to what extent am I a master of this thing. And so lots of love, Mozi Nation, keep being awesome.

[09:31] I make this channel because a lot people broken, I don't want to be one of them. I think I said

[09:35] this earlier but if I had my name is Alex Shimozi, I would act with her, she would not come, you know,

[09:39] all the dollars, things like that and I'll see you guys next video. Bye!

## Full Transcript
[00:00] What I want to do is show you how to win and impress the only person that really matters,

[00:06] which is future you.

[00:07] Not the person next to you, not the person in front of you, not the person on stage, not your mom,

[00:12] the future you.

[00:14] The point of this presentation is to give you a different way to think about this process

[00:19] so that you can make it easier to win.

[00:22] And the nice thing is that the process I'm going to show you is how you can win it anything.

[00:26] And it works for winning at health, relationships, advertising sales, real estate business,

[00:30] investing in anything else.

[00:31] We have to do things to get stuff.

[00:34] Cool?

[00:35] Awesome.

[00:36] All right.

[00:37] So with that being said, let's begin.

[00:39] How to win.

[00:42] So I'm going to cover five things.

[00:45] What to do?

[00:47] How to do it?

[00:48] Why to do it?

[00:49] Who you need to become to do it?

[00:51] And finally, when to start.

[00:53] So let's start with number one.

[00:55] That's simply, what do you need to do to win?

[00:59] A.K.A. impressed the future version of you.

[01:03] And the reason I'd find winning this way is that for those of you guys are at the top and

[01:07] you guys know who you are.

[01:09] You can't compare yourself to everyone that you're already better than.

[01:14] And I say that from a success like objective measurement perspective, not as human being.

[01:17] Everyone's a wonderful snowflake.

[01:19] But you can't compare yourself to people that you're beating because you just get complacent.

[01:25] You know that for those of you guys who are the winners here.

[01:28] For those of you guys not at the top or who are on the climb, you can only control what

[01:33] you can control.

[01:35] And you only know what that is.

[01:37] And so there might be advantages or disadvantages that you might have been born with.

[01:41] It also doesn't matter.

[01:43] No one cares.

[01:45] The only people who like excuses, other ones giving them.

[01:48] Right?

[01:49] And so let's start with an activity to prove that you already know what not to do.

[01:55] So this is a process I call inversion and I use this a hilarious amount, probably too much.

[02:01] And so this I think at least I will attribute this to Albert Einstein, Charlie Munger talks

[02:05] about it a lot, invert always invert when you have a tough problem.

[02:09] And so I use this and we use this as a very strong tool because it's easier for our brains

[02:15] to find problems than solutions.

[02:17] So we had to think earlier just now like, let's think of things for gratitude.

[02:20] Did anyone first split second be like fuck?

[02:23] Right?

[02:25] Anyone else do that?

[02:25] Because I heard it backstage and I was like, right, you're about to be on stage.

[02:28] That you can be grateful for that, right?

[02:30] I was just thinking about that.

[02:31] But like, but if I say, hey, can you think of a problem?

[02:34] I can be like, I can give you 20 right now, right?

[02:36] Right off the top of my head is like my knee kind of hurts a little bit.

[02:39] Right?

[02:39] Like I can start giving you problems really easily.

[02:41] But this because we're programmed to survive not thrive, right?

[02:45] Our brains are programmed to find threats to make sure we live to see another day,

[02:49] not so that we enjoy two day.

[02:52] And so we actually have much stronger problem finding skills than solution finding.

[02:57] And so what I want to do is use our anxiety driven threat finding brain for something good.

[03:03] And so here's the activity.

[03:05] I want you to imagine the least successful version of you.

[03:08] Lose it.

[03:12] What does that person do or not do to guarantee that you won't win?

[03:18] How do they guarantee that you lose?

[03:20] All right?

[03:21] So these out.

[03:22] Just like, what does that person do to lose?

[03:26] Netflix?

[03:27] Okay, I heard that one?

[03:31] Drugs?

[03:32] Okay?

[03:33] We're going way deeper in darker than I was thinking.

[03:35] All right.

[03:36] He's like, a heroin addiction.

[03:37] I'm like, okay.

[03:39] Yes.

[03:41] Understood.

[03:42] I thought you guys were going to say something like this.

[03:46] The impatient, show up late, be unprepared, not confident.

[03:59] Heroin, we'll get through that up there.

[04:04] Being transactional rather than relational with your clients and customers.

[04:08] Don't follow up.

[04:09] Someone's like, hey, I've been thinking about selling my house and you're like, awesome.

[04:13] And then you just never call them.

[04:15] I've got a friend who might be interested in your services and you're like, that's a damn

[04:20] shame.

[04:22] Don't advertise, don't ask for referrals.

[04:25] These are probably some things that would guarantee that you won't be successful.

[04:28] There's probably more we could add to this list.

[04:30] I would encourage you, though, if you really think about this, to really put these things

[04:34] down, because this is genuinely the process that I think about when I want to grow a business,

[04:39] when I want to get into a new endeavor, I think how could I guarantee that I would lose?

[04:43] What would I, in the fewest moves I could possibly make?

[04:46] What are the fewest things I could do to absolutely guarantee that I lose?

[04:50] And actually the smaller the list you can make, the more potent those things are.

[04:55] If there's just one thing that you can do to guarantee that you lose, that usually becomes

[04:58] the north star of how you win.

[05:02] How do we use these things that our brains came up with to win?

[05:07] We invert it.

[05:08] We flip it.

[05:09] This is what that would look like.

[05:10] From patient, because sorry, the patient goes to patient.

[05:13] Showing late is to always being on time, being unprepared to being always prepared or over-prepared,

[05:18] not confident to confident transactional to relational, doesn't fall up to always follows

[05:23] up, to doesn't advertise to advertisers constantly, to not asking for referrals to always

[05:28] doing so.

[05:29] Quick story on this.

[05:31] One of our companies had one sales guy who was outperforming the previous top sales

[05:34] person by two X.

[05:36] And so I wanted to know what this guy was doing.

[05:39] So I hopped on the phone, which he was like, boo, boo.

[05:41] And so I was like, what are you doing, man?

[05:43] After I sell someone, I just asked if they want to bring somebody else.

[05:48] And I was like, yeah.

[05:50] And then I looked at the sales director, is that not in the fucking script already?

[05:54] He was like, no, no, it is.

[05:57] And I was like, why are we not enforcing it?

[05:58] He was like, we are now.

[06:02] And so simple shit, right?

[06:05] And so a lot of you guys already know how to win because you know how to lose.

[06:10] So flip it.

[06:11] So after all that, I guess everybody here does know what to do to win, right?

[06:21] But maybe you just don't know how to do it.

[06:23] So let's talk about that.

[06:25] So most times we don't know, we don't do things because we haven't broken them down

[06:29] to the most basic form.

[06:31] All right, the more skilled you are, the more general a command can be and you can follow

[06:36] it.

[06:38] So someone can go, shrunk and be like, hey, you want to leave you on this company with

[06:41] me?

[06:42] And then you be like, can you grow it?

[06:44] And I would say, sure, very general command, right?

[06:48] Can you grow this business?

[06:50] Sure.

[06:52] If you go to a toddler and say, grow this business, they're going to be like, what does

[06:55] that mean?

[06:56] But the thing is, is that we're not so dissimilar from toddlers.

[07:00] It's just that our ego is grew up, but not our abilities.

[07:03] And so you might say to the CEO, go advertise.

[07:07] The less skilled you are, the more broken down the command must be in order to follow

[07:11] it.

[07:12] So if I were to tell the toddler, genuinely, how to grow the business, it might start

[07:16] with, hit the button, then wait until the light comes on.

[07:21] Then click the blue circle, then type in Facebook.com, hit Enter.

[07:26] You guys catching this?

[07:29] So what's the difference?

[07:30] The level of detail in the instructions.

[07:33] And this is why two people can go through the same training or event and get wildly

[07:39] different results.

[07:41] Results come down to the number of skills the person has and the number of skills required

[07:46] to understand and execute.

[07:48] This is how learning happens.

[07:51] So skills for winner coming into this event today might be they already know how to email

[07:55] market.

[07:56] They've already have charisma.

[07:58] They know how to speak.

[07:59] They know how to follow up.

[08:00] They have these skills.

[08:02] The other person here might have no skills and they could test this event and then nothing

[08:05] would happen.

[08:07] Was it the event or was it the person?

[08:09] It's just that there are requisites just like in college.

[08:12] You've got requisites to do something.

[08:14] You have to have former skills to advance to the next level.

[08:19] And unfortunately, and this really applies to those you have teams and if you are a teammate,

[08:24] you can think about this in reverse.

[08:26] If you have one broken link in the chain of commands or instructions that someone does

[08:30] not understand, they get stuck and then they do not complete the task.

[08:35] And you're like, why are you so incompetent?

[08:38] And it might just because they don't understand one step.

[08:41] And so for example, let's say that you hear go advertise.

[08:46] Skill guy says on it, the less skill person says, but how?

[08:51] Now compare that to turn on your computer.

[08:53] Do you think everybody in your team can do that?

[08:56] Right.

[08:57] So that means that everybody here can be successful if you literally just break it down

[09:03] to a level that you cannot fail.

[09:05] That you understand every step.

[09:07] Does that make sense?

[09:10] That I can do.

[09:13] So you need to break things down to the most basic level so that everyone can learn them.

[09:17] And when you do that, you make it easier for more skilled people and you make it possible

[09:22] for less skilled people.

[09:25] So for example, I said earlier on purpose, be more charismatic.

[09:30] Right?

[09:31] Can we agree that if someone's more charismatic than I do better in this field?

[09:33] In general.

[09:34] Yeah?

[09:35] Cool.

[09:36] What does that mean?

[09:40] It means smile when people walk in, change emphasis and tonality when you're talking.

[09:47] Remember people's names, ask people about themselves, nod multiple times, and then respond

[09:53] when people are talking.

[09:54] Keep eye contact.

[09:56] Address everyone in the room when you enter an exit.

[10:00] We might then say, that person's charismatic.

[10:03] But if someone says to you, be charismatic.

[10:04] You might be like, okay.

[10:08] But if someone said do these six things, do you think you could do that?

[10:12] Yes.

[10:13] You have to break it down.

[10:15] And so this is the essence of good teaching and training.

[10:19] And learning how to learn will make you better at teaching yourself and then by extension

[10:24] your team.

[10:27] So here's the right or down.

[10:29] If you can learn it, it is a skill.

[10:31] And if it's a skill, you can teach it, which is why a wholeheartedly reject the concept of

[10:38] people being born a certain way.

[10:41] They might have physical attributes that orient the environment to reinforce certain behaviors.

[10:46] But if they became that way, they were taught to be that way, either formally or informally.

[10:52] But they learned that because it was reinforced at some part in their lives.

[10:56] Which means right now, if you're like, I'm not naturally charismatic.

[11:00] Neither are children.

[11:02] They learn.

[11:03] And if you can pockere ego, you can too.

[11:07] Which means that these traits everyone says, the best are born with or simply buckets

[11:12] of smaller skills that we group together into a single larger term to save time when we're communicating.

[11:20] We don't say, hey, Johnny set your good realtor because he smiles when everyone walks in the door.

[11:26] He remembers everyone's name.

[11:27] He changes his tonality when he speaks.

[11:30] He always addresses everyone inside and out when he enters and exits.

[11:35] We don't say that, which is that he's charismatic.

[11:37] But that shorthand in language is a source of confusion.

[11:42] And remember at the beginning, I asked those of you Mr. Miyagi, think, don't worry.

[11:45] It'll come back.

[11:48] And the thing is, is we know how to teach toddlers, but it's also how adults learn.

[11:52] Our egos are just too sensitive to allow it.

[11:55] And so what I want you to do is operationalize the list of actions that we figured out together earlier.

[12:00] We had this big list of all the ways that you know you can lose.

[12:02] We flipped those into how we can win.

[12:04] And then we take those words like, be patient, be charismatic, always be on time.

[12:07] We say, how do I operationalize that?

[12:09] What do I actually do?

[12:10] Turn on the button.

[12:11] Turn the computer on.

[12:12] Hit enter.

[12:13] How do we do that?

[12:14] And so if you're like, what does operationalize mean?

[12:17] Explain using actions or behaviors you can see with your eyes.

[12:22] Someone being charismatic, I can't see with my eyes.

[12:24] Did they smile when they walked in the door?

[12:26] I can observe that.

[12:27] Did they call some of my other name?

[12:28] I can observe that.

[12:30] Did they?

[12:31] Whatever the other things on my list were, right?

[12:34] So it's not feeling thoughts and tension and pressure and manifestations of psychology.

[12:39] None of those things, belonging and instructions.

[12:43] Why?

[12:44] Because you have no idea what anyone else is thinking.

[12:48] All we know is that as a group, when people follow this process, more people buy.

[12:54] And here's the cool part.

[12:56] That's all we need to know.

[12:57] We don't need to test the science of the psychology.

[13:00] We just know that when we greet people, we look them in the eyes, we shake them, we

[13:02] remember their hand, and then we follow up on this cadence, it works.

[13:07] That's it.

[13:08] It's all we need to know and then do it.

[13:12] And so we know that if we do these things, you get this outcome.

[13:18] And that makes learning and teaching a lot simpler.

[13:21] We deal with only what we can measure and observe.

[13:24] And I promise you, if you can look at the world this way, one, 90% of the content you

[13:28] see in your newsfeed, you will just be able to ignore as noise.

[13:32] Because people are like, it's the manifestation of the internal trauma from child.

[13:37] It's just smiling, shaking their fucking hand.

[13:40] Just stop.

[13:42] Stop.

[13:43] So let me give you another example.

[13:47] This is one that I actually struggled with.

[13:49] So I spent a lot of my time trying to operationalize words because it just helps me understand

[13:52] the world better because I don't feel like I understand much at all.

[13:55] And that's, and I just share that stuff in my content because I share the stuff that

[13:58] I figured out, or at least as I figured it out for me.

[14:00] And so I have always been somebody who identified as being an impatient person.

[14:05] And I figured if I was going to be an investor, patience would probably be very important

[14:09] character trait to have.

[14:11] And I was like, what, how do I do that?

[14:14] Someone's like, be patient.

[14:15] You're like, now what?

[14:20] So what does that mean?

[14:21] So patience means figuring out what to do in the meantime.

[14:26] That's it.

[14:27] AKA doing anything besides doing the thing you're avoiding, including doing nothing at

[14:31] all.

[14:32] This is why some of these dictionary definitions are very difficult to actually do anything

[14:36] with.

[14:37] It's not the capacity to accept or tolerate delay trouble suffering without getting

[14:41] angry or upset.

[14:43] Just figure out to do in the meantime.

[14:45] That's being patient.

[14:46] So a quick question.

[14:48] Who here has investments?

[14:49] This is in like a big flex question.

[14:51] Okay, cool.

[14:52] Now, right now, provided you literally aren't on Robinhood selling your shit.

[14:59] You are being patient by just being here.

[15:02] Like right now, your investments are moving in one direction or other.

[15:05] And you're being patient because you figured out something to do in the meantime.

[15:08] Huh?

[15:09] Not so hard.

[15:11] In other words, right.

[15:13] Yeah, I wrote this.

[15:14] There we go.

[15:17] Which brings me to my next how point.

[15:19] Binaryising Continuums.

[15:21] Real quick.

[15:22] It's not that you are patient or not.

[15:25] And the reason I'm emphasizing this is because sometimes it can feel unrealistic to

[15:28] try to teen these traits.

[15:30] It's like, well, it's so hard for me to be charismatic or not soft spoken or patient.

[15:36] But it's not about being it or not being it.

[15:39] The question is how patient are you?

[15:41] Which means that it's not a binary to continue.

[15:43] It's, can I move myself slowly in this direction by taking actions?

[15:48] Which makes every skill you work on, improvable.

[15:53] And so everything that we do to impress our future selves is another proof point that we

[15:57] act more times than not in this way.

[16:02] Until eventually, we begin to describe ourselves as patient or detent oriented or charismatic.

[16:09] And this allows us to see progress with these quote traits which are really just buckets

[16:13] of larger skills that we do short-hand with so we can communicate.

[16:18] So now that we covered that, I can finally define three terms that I think will matter

[16:21] for everyone in this room and cement the how.

[16:24] Learning intelligence and confidence.

[16:27] So let's start with learning.

[16:30] Learning simply means same condition, new behavior.

[16:34] So the same thing happens and then you respond differently.

[16:38] That's learning.

[16:40] So if I show you a red card and then I slap you.

[16:46] Like wow, that sucked and I put it back in my pocket and then I bring out my red card

[16:50] again and then I slap you.

[16:58] Then I bring out my red card again.

[17:00] You duck.

[17:02] You learned.

[17:06] The phone rings.

[17:09] Hello?

[17:12] No script.

[17:13] Phone rings.

[17:15] Hi.

[17:19] Phone rings.

[17:21] Read the script.

[17:23] You learned.

[17:25] Same condition.

[17:26] New behavior.

[17:28] Learning.

[17:31] So please remember this because I'm going to hit on this multiple times throughout.

[17:35] Learning means same condition.

[17:37] If you're presented with the same situation and you do not change how you behave, you have

[17:40] not learned.

[17:41] So that's learning.

[17:43] Intelligence.

[17:46] How fast you change what you do in the same situation.

[17:49] Intelligence is rate of learning.

[17:52] Speed of learning.

[17:56] So, Dumber.

[17:59] Phone rings.

[18:00] No script.

[18:02] Phone rings.

[18:03] No script.

[18:04] Phone rings.

[18:05] No script.

[18:06] Never changes.

[18:08] Dumber.

[18:12] We can call complex this.

[18:16] Smarter.

[18:18] Phone rings.

[18:19] No script.

[18:21] Phone rings.

[18:22] Read script.

[18:24] Change is faster.

[18:25] Smarter.

[18:28] Everyone wants to think they're smart.

[18:31] But many of you will leave this event.

[18:33] Go back to the same environment and not change your behavior.

[18:40] So if that's you, which one of these two are you below?

[18:43] Dumber.

[18:44] Everyone's like, or smarter.

[18:56] So you may not have ever thought that you were smart.

[18:59] But if you change your behavior, you can beat even the quote smartest person.

[19:04] Which is why you need to be delta.

[19:05] You need to be a triangle.

[19:07] Change instead of an L7 weaning.

[19:10] Square.

[19:11] Right?

[19:12] So I try and go as well.

[19:13] Because we change.

[19:15] So that's intelligence, which is simply rate of learning.

[19:17] How quickly you change your behavior under the same conditions.

[19:21] So how can we tie that to confidence?

[19:23] Because I think could we agree that a realtor who's more confident would probably do

[19:26] better in this field than what who isn't?

[19:28] OK.

[19:29] Awesome.

[19:30] The percentage likelihood that's something happens.

[19:33] In statistics, you have a confidence metric.

[19:35] How confident are we that something's going to happen?

[19:38] And confidence is domain specific.

[19:40] So you can be a confident realtor and a not so confident parent.

[19:43] Kind of interesting.

[19:45] So how do you increase your confidence percentage with proof?

[19:51] Well, how do you create proof?

[19:52] You do it a lot of times.

[19:55] And how can you make sure you have a high percentage likelihood that the script

[19:58] comes out the way you want it with a client.

[20:00] You do it in the exact situation a lot of times.

[20:04] Because confidence is domain specific.

[20:06] There are some people who practice their speech in the mirror.

[20:09] But when they get on stage, they freeze.

[20:10] They're like, but I practice this thing.

[20:12] You didn't practice it front of crowd.

[20:14] It becomes domain specific.

[20:18] You sound so certain.

[20:20] Here's how you do that.

[20:21] Do it enough times that you get bored of it.

[20:24] They're like you can complete the sentences.

[20:26] You can do it while you're driving.

[20:27] You can do it in any situation you want.

[20:28] Because guess what?

[20:29] That's when you'll be performing the script.

[20:33] So here's a writer down here.

[20:35] confidence comes from the past, not the present.

[20:40] If your planner requires luck, it's a bad plan.

[20:43] If you need to get lucky in order to win in this game,

[20:46] you will not win.

[20:48] So you can prepare.

[20:50] And you do that in the past before you need the skill.

[20:53] You dig the well before your thirsty.

[20:55] So now that we've covered the what, you guys all know

[20:57] the big list of things that you should be doing.

[21:01] And you can break it down into it, operationalized,

[21:04] little basic nugget of I can actually do this with the how.

[21:09] Let's talk about why you should but aren't.

[21:12] So we'll talk about two things

[21:14] that are in my little wide category.

[21:15] External conditions and internal conditions.

[21:19] So I'll start here.

[21:20] That's supposed to be like the economy.

[21:22] I don't know if that little visual looks economic,

[21:25] but I liked it.

[21:27] OK.

[21:28] So here's why you might not be doing it.

[21:31] I call this the five stages of opportunity hopping.

[21:33] So you go from step one, uninformed optimism.

[21:36] You're like, man, in this low-instituted environment,

[21:40] my cousins making a kill in an real estate.

[21:43] Must be amazing.

[21:44] I could do that too.

[21:45] Then you hop in.

[21:46] You go to step two, which is in form pessimism.

[21:50] This is not as easy as I originally thought.

[21:51] People aren't just coming to give me their homes to sell.

[21:57] Well, what you got, Ali.

[21:59] And then you keep going.

[22:00] You keep going.

[22:01] And you reach this third point where you're like,

[22:03] the value of despair.

[22:05] What is life?

[22:06] It's just really what I want to do.

[22:07] Am I passionate about real estate?

[22:11] You know, I really do love being a family part.

[22:13] You know, I just, and then you start just to find reasons,

[22:16] not to do something.

[22:19] And this is what most people do.

[22:21] Is they get to the value of despair.

[22:24] And they jump.

[22:25] Because in the beginning there, you saw your cousin

[22:27] who's doing well at real.

[22:30] And you were like, I'm going to jump in.

[22:32] But you were doing something before that.

[22:33] That you were just the value to spare of that thing.

[22:36] And so all you do is, or not you, but all many people do,

[22:39] is that they just uninformed optimism

[22:42] in form pessimism, value of despair,

[22:45] uninformed optimism, and form pessimism, value of despair.

[22:48] Uninformed optimism, and self-repetitive,

[22:51] some of you have lived this thing 10 fucking times.

[22:53] And so many of you guys are here right now.

[23:05] It's a tougher climate than it was 24 months ago.

[23:09] But here's what it looks like when it's right.

[23:11] You go to stage four, which is informed optimism,

[23:14] which is, you know what, there is a process

[23:16] that when I got into this, I didn't understand.

[23:18] But now I do understand it, and I broken it down into actions

[23:21] that I can do in perform on a regular basis.

[23:23] And I have a feedback cycle so that I can learn how to get better.

[23:26] And I will measure myself on the progress that I do

[23:28] to the things that I've committed to.

[23:31] I know how to win.

[23:35] And then you do that stuff.

[23:36] And you get to step five, which is you win.

[23:40] And then you question why life is meaning

[23:42] less to begin with, but you know, whatever.

[23:43] We'll get to that later.

[23:44] So we get more for what we put in when we stick with things.

[23:51] You get compounding returns when you stick with things longer.

[23:55] And so wealth is made during the hard times

[23:57] because the largest percentage of the market transfers

[23:59] to the few left standing.

[24:05] That guy, or go.

[24:08] The more you do anything, the better you get at it.

[24:12] And the more environments you do it in, the better you get at it

[24:15] in more environments, especially consider

[24:17] a macroeconomic environment right now.

[24:19] So the question is, who would you trust more to sell your house?

[24:23] The agent who's been through three recessions

[24:24] and never left the profession?

[24:26] That rhyme didn't mean to do that, but sounds cool.

[24:29] Or the agent who juggles three opportunities

[24:31] in hops and in out when it's convenient.

[24:35] What was something you were like?

[24:36] That's me.

[24:38] Right.

[24:39] And you wonder why you don't win.

[24:42] And so your clients feel that way too.

[24:44] And so even if the people who see you right now

[24:47] aren't in the market, they're always deciding

[24:49] who they're going to go with when they do.

[24:54] And so people, including future you,

[24:56] will be watching what you do and how you act.

[24:59] And so you need to do three times the work for the same outcome

[25:01] today, but 10 times the eyes are on you.

[25:05] And so if you close deals when times are hard,

[25:08] they'll know you can close their deal when times are easy.

[25:13] So TLDR.

[25:15] Down times as when champions are made.

[25:17] It's when skills are sharpened.

[25:18] If you can win now when the economy turns around,

[25:22] you will crush.

[25:23] I love this quote, a smooth sea never made a skilled sailor.

[25:27] Who here wants to be fucking great?

[25:31] Then we should fucking wish for storms.

[25:34] And you're happy.

[25:35] Because if you want to be a skilled sailor,

[25:37] then you can not be great unless you have something

[25:40] to test yourself against.

[25:42] You can't claim that you were loyal until someone,

[25:44] if you're married, until somebody comes up to you

[25:47] and you say, I'm good.

[25:49] You can just claim loyalty all day,

[25:50] but until you test it, you don't have the skill

[25:52] because you have no proof.

[25:54] Today, these times are opportunities to give ourselves proof

[25:58] of who we really are.

[26:00] And I think that is one of the most motivating things

[26:02] of hard times is that these are the stories

[26:04] that you will someday tell about yourself.

[26:08] So here's the writer down it.

[26:10] What makes you extraordinary isn't what you do.

[26:12] It's how long you're willing to do it for.

[26:15] There's nothing extraordinary about saying someone's name

[26:17] and shaking their hand.

[26:18] I mean, it's great, but is it extraordinary?

[26:21] I don't know.

[26:22] But if you do it every single time for the rest

[26:24] of your life, is that extraordinary?

[26:26] Something as simple as that?

[26:28] Yes, it is.

[26:31] So it's not what you do.

[26:32] It's how long you're willing to do it for.

[26:35] And so I was going to talk about two things.

[26:37] External conditions did that.

[26:40] Now, let's talk about this.

[26:41] Internal conditions for why you're not doing something

[26:43] that you should be doing.

[26:44] So where does motivation come from?

[26:47] I don't know.

[26:49] Right?

[26:50] Charlotte, trauma, I didn't get hugged enough, whatever.

[26:53] Right?

[26:54] Motivation comes from deprivation.

[26:58] Let me get dark for a second.

[27:00] I'll be fun.

[27:01] This person, for example, is very motivated to breathe.

[27:06] You're going to agree on that?

[27:08] Okay.

[27:09] Next point.

[27:11] Unmotivated to have sex.

[27:16] They might be who knows.

[27:17] So we guys are wild.

[27:18] All right?

[27:20] I don't want to breathe.

[27:20] All right, calm down.

[27:21] Okay.

[27:22] So.

[27:24] Go on, moving on.

[27:25] I know that we've been on.

[27:26] I've been on.

[27:29] So let me explain.

[27:31] So when are you more motivated to eat

[27:33] drink water, sleep?

[27:36] When you're hungry, thirsty, and tired?

[27:39] That's when you're the most motivated.

[27:41] If you're a fish to big meal and been like, man,

[27:42] I could go for another pizza, probably not.

[27:46] Have you drank a big gallon of water?

[27:48] And been like, I don't want any more fluids.

[27:50] Of course not, because you're not to thrive.

[27:53] And so when you're full, you don't want it anymore.

[27:56] After you finish Thanksgiving dessert, your stuff

[27:58] are used to hungry, no.

[28:00] After you drink a bunch of water, do you want more?

[28:01] No.

[28:02] So what does this have to do with motivation

[28:04] to win and make money?

[28:06] I'll tell you.

[28:06] I'll wrap it up.

[28:07] I'll move it.

[28:09] Because by this logic, wouldn't all poor people

[28:12] be motivated since they're deprived of money?

[28:16] That would make sense.

[28:17] But we know that's not the case.

[28:19] Because the people who make the most money

[28:20] are the ones who keep wanting to make more.

[28:24] So here's why.

[28:26] You know when you're tired, hungry, or thirsty,

[28:28] you perceive a gap.

[28:31] And your motivation is proportional to your deprivation.

[28:34] How much you don't have.

[28:36] Very hungry.

[28:36] This guy is much hungryer than the person who's just like,

[28:39] maybe I'll have dinner on the way home.

[28:42] And so here's why money motivation is more complicated

[28:44] than hunger, thirst, or being sleepy.

[28:46] With money, deprivation is not physiological.

[28:51] It's psychological.

[28:53] You only feel poor if you perceive a large gap

[28:56] between where you are and where you really want to be.

[29:01] So let me show you this visually.

[29:03] So let's say you're at $5,000 a month in income.

[29:06] And your desires to get to $10,000 a month.

[29:09] Fair enough?

[29:10] Cool.

[29:11] Now let's say this guy is doing a million a month in income.

[29:14] But he wants to get to $10 million a month in income.

[29:19] Relative to their goal, one guy is closer.

[29:23] He's only half of his goal.

[29:24] The other guy is one tenth of his goal.

[29:27] Who's more deprived?

[29:33] Hang around five people with 10 times the net worth

[29:36] that you have and you'll feel poor than you ever did

[29:38] when you were poor around poor people than you.

[29:40] Yeah.

[29:41] Yeah.

[29:44] That'll be a homozy fan, Amelia, tongue twister

[29:46] for my children.

[29:49] AKA, changing your minimum standard.

[29:51] Which I'd still from Sean.

[29:54] The number and predictor of wealth is an IQ, gender, race,

[29:58] and this one startled me.

[30:00] It's the zip code you're born in.

[30:03] Kind of fox with you a little bit.

[30:05] You're like, huh, it's not about race, it's not about gender.

[30:08] It's not even about IQ.

[30:09] It's just where you're born.

[30:12] Which means it's the things that we compare ourselves to.

[30:15] Because your environment sets your standards.

[30:18] If you change the environment, you change your behavior.

[30:22] This is why networks like this are so valuable.

[30:24] Like you can basically get someone to do anything

[30:26] if you orient the environment the right way.

[30:28] I can get everyone here to take off their clothes

[30:30] if I make this 150 degrees in this row.

[30:32] Yeah.

[30:33] Yeah.

[30:34] Yeah.

[30:36] Yeah.

[30:37] I could.

[30:39] You could.

[30:40] You change the environment.

[30:41] You can change behavior.

[30:42] If I told you to, like, everybody get digging.

[30:45] We're like, I'm good, Alex.

[30:47] Fair enough.

[30:48] Crank this thing to 150.

[30:51] People start stripping.

[30:54] How do you need to say anything?

[30:55] The environment change your behavior more than I ever

[30:56] could.

[30:58] This is why the places like this and networks like this

[31:00] are so valuable.

[31:02] And so, if you want to feel more motivated,

[31:05] change who you compare yourself to.

[31:08] Our environment stretches the gap and you experience the

[31:12] deprivation.

[31:13] Rich people are more deprived of money than poor people

[31:16] because they compare themselves to richer people than poor people

[31:18] do.

[31:20] It's a consider this extreme example.

[31:22] You've got the guy with a bag on his back.

[31:25] Nothing else he needs.

[31:26] I have everything I need.

[31:28] Two, I need everything.

[31:31] Who's more deprived?

[31:36] So, you might be like, huh?

[31:37] This seems kind of dark.

[31:39] Is there a clean way to make this comparison

[31:41] without focusing on other people?

[31:42] Because that's what I would be asking.

[31:44] Yes, compare yourself to the person who generally

[31:46] want to become.

[31:48] That's how you can create the gap.

[31:51] So, here's the writer down here.

[31:53] If you want to change what you do, change you compare yourself to.

[31:59] So, we covered external conditions that might be stopping you

[32:01] from doing the what, opportunity hopping and sticking it out.

[32:06] And now we covered the internal conditions

[32:08] that might have been preventing you.

[32:09] Who you compare yourself to and your internal levels of

[32:11] motivation and deprivation?

[32:14] So, now that we covered the what, and we covered the how,

[32:17] we covered the why, internal external.

[32:20] Now let's talk about who you have to become to do that.

[32:23] So, how do we become someone with certain traits?

[32:27] Well, contrary to popular opinion and the Instagram people,

[32:31] I don't think it has to be due with becoming at all.

[32:34] So, when we describe who someone is, what do we do?

[32:39] We describe how they behave and what they do.

[32:43] Being and identities become descriptions of what we do.

[32:48] And so, little Aristotle will ancient Greek.

[32:51] We are what we repeatedly do.

[32:54] And that's why I think this whole thing that has been very popularized

[32:56] by the the fluff people.

[32:58] Hopefully no one else said this earlier on this stage

[33:00] though, it's not.

[33:03] B do have is BS.

[33:07] So, let me explain.

[33:09] We describe someone at Zenite, we say,

[33:11] hey, he's honest, he's hardworking, he's a real estate agent.

[33:13] That's how we describe them.

[33:16] So, let's translate those.

[33:18] He's honest, he states the facts, he's hardworking,

[33:23] you complete tasks as fast or faster than expectations you agree to.

[33:27] There's real estate agents, someone who represents buyers and

[33:29] or sellers in real estate transactions.

[33:31] All right, that's the identity, but everything that we use

[33:33] to describe the identity or things the person does.

[33:38] Note that being has 100% to do with doing.

[33:42] So, if you want to be a certain type of person,

[33:44] they need to do with that certain type of person does.

[33:49] And when you do those certain things,

[33:51] then you get the results of those actions,

[33:53] which means you can summarize the entire thing of B do have

[33:57] to just do, because by doing you B and by doing you get,

[34:02] just do.

[34:05] This makes the person that you want to become

[34:08] the actions you take and we later describe as identity,

[34:11] what 100% under your control,

[34:13] which I think is very inspiring.

[34:16] Which is why one of my favorite things of all time is,

[34:18] and here's a writer downer, the work works on you more

[34:21] than you work on it.

[34:24] And so, I'll tell you a little story.

[34:26] So, I was at Sephora with my wife.

[34:30] It's a makeup store.

[34:33] It's where they sell paint for ladies.

[34:34] Anyways, so we're there and I'm standing

[34:37] against the wall like this and Layla's doing whatever.

[34:41] And I see these two little girls super excited.

[34:44] And the lady in the smock comes up to them,

[34:47] and she's like, okay, this is eyeliner

[34:50] and this is lipstick, I learned those terms.

[34:54] And you need to start budgeting for this now,

[34:56] because they're probably like this height,

[34:59] this age wise.

[35:00] And they were so excited, and they're like,

[35:01] because now that you're grown up,

[35:03] and you're guys are women,

[35:04] like you have to start budgeting for this every month,

[35:06] because you need to start spending it.

[35:07] And I thought it was such a cute little story

[35:09] and the girls were so excited,

[35:10] but she basically said that,

[35:11] with a new identity comes new priorities,

[35:14] you're gonna shift how you allocate resources

[35:16] based on the person you wanna become.

[35:17] These girls wanna become women.

[35:19] And she said, great, you need to change how you behave.

[35:24] And so for many of you, being number one and winning,

[35:26] simply comes down to doing what the number one person does,

[35:28] or would do, with the number one version of yourself.

[35:32] And then, if you do those things,

[35:34] people will eventually describe you that way

[35:36] when the evidence catches up.

[35:40] So, we talked about, now we've talked about who you have to become,

[35:46] which is just a reminder of just doing what future version

[35:48] of you does for long enough period

[35:50] that you would describe yourself that way.

[35:53] All right, so finally, let's talk about

[35:55] the way you should start.

[35:57] So when you start this stuff,

[35:59] because you might be like, you know it, Alex,

[36:00] this sounds great, a little hand thing with the fingers,

[36:02] cool, but I'm busy, now it's not a good time,

[36:05] maybe in the future.

[36:07] So, let's put it up there.

[36:10] I think there's three things about time that I find interesting.

[36:13] So, you can have a reason not to do something

[36:15] because season-wise economically,

[36:18] or timing in the season of your life isn't good.

[36:20] We can think about our by-hour,

[36:22] you're like literally, I don't have the time in the day

[36:24] to get this stuff done, that would make me number one.

[36:26] Or you can use something that I like to call the one

[36:28] then, fallacy.

[36:29] So let's break it down.

[36:32] So, if you're busy,

[36:35] that's actually the best time to change your behavior.

[36:39] Why?

[36:40] Because you guys want this to last, right?

[36:42] If you're gonna change your behavior,

[36:43] you want your behavior to change the last, correct?

[36:48] Then, if you only wait until you're not busy,

[36:50] then you assume that you will be not busy again in the future,

[36:53] because if it's contingent on you being not busy,

[36:56] then the moment you get busy again, you'll stop.

[37:00] So, start when you're the busiest,

[37:02] so that when you get busy again,

[37:04] you already know how to do it,

[37:06] and that you can stick with it.

[37:07] Does that make sense?

[37:09] Cool, that anyone get one of their reasons crushed?

[37:12] Great.

[37:12] So, if you're waiting until you're less busy

[37:15] to start a new have-er program,

[37:16] it just assumes that you get busy again, you'll stop.

[37:18] If you want enduring change the best time

[37:20] to start as when you're busy,

[37:21] learn how to make it work in the worst condition,

[37:23] and it'll stick in the best.

[37:27] Now is the best time.

[37:30] Let's go hour by hour.

[37:32] So, I used to say the same thing to my wife,

[37:35] of like, I just don't have time to do all these things,

[37:38] and you know what she did?

[37:40] She grabbed my phone.

[37:41] She looked at my time usage, and she was like,

[37:43] huh, here's four hours every day.

[37:46] You spend on not work.

[37:49] I guess I found you some time.

[37:54] Anyone want to look at their phone right now, probably not.

[37:58] The other way to think about this is like,

[37:59] do you think that there's someone on earth

[38:00] who had less make it happen?

[38:03] Yes, of course.

[38:05] If they can, you can too, right?

[38:08] Everyone is the same 24 hours,

[38:09] it's about how you allocate them.

[38:12] And the nice thing is that if you're doing a lot of stuff

[38:16] right now, and you're not getting to where you want to go,

[38:19] you're doing the wrong stuff.

[38:20] And so the first thing when you course correct

[38:22] is actually elimination, not addition,

[38:24] because most of the stuff you're doing right now

[38:25] is not working.

[38:26] So then change what you do,

[38:28] and you'll have way more time.

[38:32] Smart, busy, bro.

[38:34] Smart, busy, bro.

[38:36] Can't be else rate.

[38:37] You got a pick too.

[38:38] You can be smart and busy, but you won't be broke.

[38:41] You can be busy and broke, but you're not smart.

[38:43] You can be smart and broke, but you're not busy.

[38:48] Super real talk.

[38:49] If you're working all the time,

[38:50] and you're not making progress, you're doing the wrong stuff.

[38:52] People who achieve goals faster don't actually move faster.

[38:55] They achieve more with every step.

[38:57] This is the basis of leverage.

[38:58] They get more for what they put in.

[39:00] If you're not moving as fast as you want,

[39:02] you're doing the wrong stuff, okay?

[39:03] So consider the alternative,

[39:05] because some of you are still holding onto this,

[39:07] and you're like,

[39:08] they're like, really don't have time.

[39:10] It's like, okay, you're right.

[39:11] And you'll never achieve the success you want,

[39:13] and it's not your fault.

[39:15] Have you all better?

[39:16] Yeah.

[39:17] Right.

[39:19] Didn't think so.

[39:20] So let's assume that you've got the time

[39:21] and you're spending it the wrong way.

[39:25] Is that number two?

[39:26] Let's go to the one then, Valcy.

[39:27] Always a phone one.

[39:29] So this will catch me stuck for years.

[39:31] Basically, you think,

[39:33] when I have more time, I'll do it.

[39:35] It's like saying, I'll save money when I have more money.

[39:40] Or like, I'll get healthy before I go to the hospital.

[39:45] Or I'll get us, I'll go to the gym once I have a six pack.

[39:49] You invert the sequence.

[39:50] You're getting the order wrong.

[39:53] Right?

[39:53] You do the stuff now to get the thing later.

[39:56] You do, and then you get, you don't get in order to do.

[40:02] So that's number three.

[40:04] So when do you start?

[40:06] Answer.

[40:07] The moment you want to be the future version of yourself.

[40:10] AKA, win.

[40:12] So when do you want to become the future you?

[40:14] Or when do you become the future you?

[40:16] When you do what they do?

[40:18] Because if identity is based in action,

[40:20] then the moment you start doing the things that future you does,

[40:22] you are that person.

[40:24] It just takes time for the proof to show up.

[40:27] But you are that person already.

[40:29] And that is enough for you.

[40:31] So we talked about what?

[40:34] How when who and when you should start?

[40:36] She's like, now what?

[40:38] We'll shit, I don't know.

[40:40] So the name of the presentation was how to win.

[40:44] Remember the whole intelligence and learning thing?

[40:46] The longer it takes you to start doing the things you know what to do,

[40:51] and how to do the less intelligent you are.

[40:53] And whenever you get stuck, break things down,

[40:58] that you need to do into continually smaller chunks

[41:01] until you understand how to do them.

[41:03] So whenever you get stuck, just think, oh, there are terms or words

[41:06] here that I don't understand.

[41:07] I just need to break it down more.

[41:09] Don't you go get involved if you're like someone says,

[41:11] you need to advertise more.

[41:12] You got to be like, okay, what does that mean?

[41:16] Then you break it down.

[41:17] Okay, it just means post this many.

[41:18] Okay, I get that.

[41:19] Okay, means you have to do 100 DMs.

[41:21] Okay, I got that.

[41:22] So the reminder is you guys know how to win better

[41:25] than I could ever tell you.

[41:27] So take the inverted list from earlier,

[41:29] write out the things that would guarantee that you lose,

[41:31] flip them to what you would do to win,

[41:33] and then break down those terms into the action steps

[41:35] of what it takes to be that trait or have that skill.

[41:39] Tracer just skills.

[41:42] And then practice it until it becomes second nature.

[41:46] And then chunk up.

[41:47] So in the beginning, you just have to talk about doing 100 DMs.

[41:50] Once you know how to do that,

[41:51] you know how to cold call as an outreach and door knocking

[41:53] and ads and all the stuff that you can just say,

[41:56] advertise, you can chunk it up because you have more skills.

[42:01] And then you measure your success by whether you completed

[42:03] the actions that would make it unreasonable

[42:05] that you will not fail and then you succeed by default.

[42:09] So what would I have to do to make it unreasonable

[42:11] that I don't become number one?

[42:13] List those, do those and you will get there.

[42:18] But you measure yourself on whether you did the thing.

[42:20] That's it, yes or no, very simple.

[42:23] And so all the greatest games in life that I found,

[42:25] marriage, health, business, you never actually win.

[42:28] You don't win at marriage.

[42:29] The point is to stay married.

[42:31] You don't win at health.

[42:32] The point is to stay healthy.

[42:33] You don't win at business.

[42:35] The point is to stay in business.

[42:39] And so it shifts the game from winning to outlassing.

[42:41] And that means winning comes down to making it a decision

[42:43] that you can 100% control.

[42:47] Which I think is cool.

[42:49] And so I'll tell you a little story.

[42:53] Back in the day, I pledged to fraternity.

[42:55] And two weeks in, my whole pledge class

[43:00] revolted.

[43:00] We were like, this sucks.

[43:01] This is when we sign up for this is not fun

[43:03] and parties and girls.

[43:04] I was like, yeah, that's it.

[43:06] But it wasn't what our expectations were.

[43:09] So they sat us down.

[43:09] They gave us pep talk and we got over it.

[43:11] And then when I was on the other side,

[43:13] I actually found out that every single pledge class

[43:15] every single year would revolt between day 10 and day 16.

[43:20] Every year.

[43:22] And so I ended up becoming president of the fraternity

[43:24] and it was my turn to give that talk.

[43:26] And so I go into this freshman dorm room.

[43:28] There's 20 of these guys.

[43:29] They're outnumbering me.

[43:30] Right there like, yeah, we don't like you anymore.

[43:32] I go.

[43:33] And so I said, I get it guys.

[43:34] I said, who here thought that this would be easy?

[43:39] No one raised her.

[43:40] Who here thought it would be hard.

[43:42] They raised their hands.

[43:44] I was like, this, right now,

[43:46] I was like, this is what hard feels like.

[43:49] You just didn't know what hard felt like.

[43:51] This is what it feels like.

[43:53] Makes sense?

[43:55] It just reset reality.

[43:57] This is what hard feels like.

[43:59] You said you expected to be hard.

[44:00] This is hard.

[44:02] They all came back.

[44:04] And so right now, you may be at that point in your career.

[44:07] And the hard can be different for different people.

[44:08] It might be stuck at a certain level of income.

[44:10] It might be just getting started.

[44:12] It might be being number two and wanting to be number one.

[44:14] Everyone's hard is different.

[44:16] But this is what it feels like.

[44:17] There's a level of uncertainty of not knowing whether your actions

[44:19] are going to yield the results that you want,

[44:21] but doing them anyways.

[44:23] Not knowing if you're going to get credit from the market

[44:26] or on your check at the end of the month.

[44:29] And whether this is really the thing that you want to do

[44:31] for the rest of your life, everyone thinks these questions.

[44:34] But the people who win just continue to do the actions

[44:38] regardless, which is why I say focus on the activities,

[44:40] not on the inside your ears.

[44:43] You can feel terrible and still win.

[44:48] So that's what hard feels like.

[44:49] So this is one of my favorite Chinese Proverbs.

[44:51] Everything must be hard before it can be easy.

[44:54] What makes things hard is in complexity.

[44:55] It's consistency.

[44:56] As boring as it gets, sometimes you just have to keep doing it

[44:59] before you get anything back.

[45:00] Hard times are opportunities to give yourself proof

[45:02] that even this couldn't stop you.

[45:06] You're going to lose sleep.

[45:07] You'll doubt whether it'll work.

[45:08] You'll stress to make ends meet.

[45:10] You won't finish your to-do list.

[45:11] You'll wonder if you made the right call.

[45:13] And you'll have no way to know for years.

[45:15] But this is what hard feels like.

[45:17] And this is what you signed up for.

[45:19] And that's what makes it worth it.

[45:20] And that is okay.

[45:23] So in closing, say a little Mr. Miyagi.

[45:27] Everyone here knows what you do to win.

[45:30] Do all those things that you wrote down,

[45:32] make them positive.

[45:34] Cool.

[45:35] Figure out those ways to lose and do the opposite.

[45:39] You know how to do it.

[45:41] Remember, you take those things, chunk them down.

[45:44] Break down so small that anyone could do it, even a child.

[45:48] You know why you should be doing it.

[45:50] You have these opportunities that keep presenting themselves.

[45:52] You keep looking at shiny objects.

[45:55] But we get more for what we put in when we stick with things.

[45:59] While this made during the hard times,

[46:01] the few people that stand and get the most of it.

[46:04] You create motivation by changing your environment

[46:06] and who you compare yourself to.

[46:08] So you know why you should be doing it

[46:09] because you get outside for turns for sticking to things.

[46:12] And you already know how to become the person you can win.

[46:17] How do we do that?

[46:20] By doing, do who means do?

[46:24] It's the easiest thing.

[46:25] Who do I want to become?

[46:26] What does that person do?

[46:27] I'll do that.

[46:29] And you know when you should start, which is if it's not,

[46:35] you're really busy right now in the season,

[46:37] it's the best time to start.

[46:38] If you don't have time, you're spending it all the wrong stuff.

[46:40] And if you think you need to get in order to do,

[46:43] you have it backwards.

[46:46] So when do you start?

[46:48] The moment you want to be the future version of you.

[46:52] So here's my final reminder.

[46:55] If you take one thing from this presentation,

[46:58] if you do not change, you did not learn.

[47:02] And everyone here has things that they've written down

[47:04] from many of the talks of things that you want to do

[47:07] or want to think about or whatever.

[47:08] I would encourage you to make that a list of things

[47:11] that you will do.

[47:12] And then when you go back to the same condition,

[47:14] your same home, your same house, your same market,

[47:16] your same whatever, you change your behavior.

[47:18] And then that will show that you learned.

[47:20] And you soak one step to becoming the person

[47:22] that you ultimately want to be.

[47:23] Thank you.

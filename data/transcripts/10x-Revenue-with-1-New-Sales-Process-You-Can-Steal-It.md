## Full Transcript
[00:00] I crossed $100 million in network by age 32.

[00:02] I sold my first big company for $46.2 million.

[00:05] And the reason we were able to do that is because we know how to grow companies.

[00:08] And so now I buy companies at a lower price, I grow them, and then we sell them.

[00:14] And so I want to talk to you about one of the companies we just bought.

[00:17] We bought them a year and a half a go, I think, or a year ago.

[00:21] They had 14 locations.

[00:22] So it was a chain, a brick and mortar.

[00:25] And since then we've gone from 14 to 32 locations.

[00:28] And the reason we're able to do that is because we focused on the sales process.

[00:32] And the process that I want to walk you through is something that I call the diagnostic

[00:35] sale.

[00:36] We're able to 10X the recurring revenue of the business across all the locations.

[00:40] So before we get into the nitty-gritty of the story, let me just walk you through the steps

[00:42] in the diagnostic process.

[00:44] First is we like to have some sort of pre-cell questionnaire, which the purpose of that is

[00:47] to get more information that arms the sales person's, they know who they're talking

[00:50] to, what their pains are.

[00:51] But from the sales perspective for them, they also increase their awareness of the problem.

[00:57] And as we get their information in their credit card, which is key in our explained

[00:59] line later.

[01:00] Third is we want to understand what the current situation is.

[01:03] Where are you at today?

[01:04] Then we have your desired state.

[01:05] So what would you like to be at?

[01:06] And then what's the obstacle?

[01:08] Why aren't you there?

[01:09] And then finally, once we have these big three, we present the desired state and are vehicle

[01:14] to overcome the obstacle and we tie our price to the way that we're going to get them there.

[01:19] And then finally, give them an incentive to prepay.

[01:21] So here's the five steps that we've followed to actually get this done.

[01:24] The number one is that we secret shopped the business.

[01:27] So we actually looked into it.

[01:29] We went there by the way, you should secret shop your own business, highly recommend doing it.

[01:32] You'll be horrified by what you hear yourselves.

[01:34] Guy said, you're like, I thought we had a script.

[01:36] What are you even doing?

[01:37] Number two is from there.

[01:38] This is basically information gathering.

[01:40] We forgot what the constraint is.

[01:41] Okay, where do we think there's big opportunities in the business?

[01:44] Now, you should think about yourself as your own business consultant.

[01:47] If you could buy your business today and look at your business, we'll be the no-duff thing

[01:51] that you do.

[01:52] For this particular business, we thought that they had an offer constraint, which really

[01:55] came down to packaging.

[01:57] We had offer slash packaging.

[01:59] Because fundamentally, we're not going to change the core of the business.

[02:02] We're not going to all of a sudden start selling soap when you sell HVAC.

[02:07] That's not going to happen, right?

[02:08] So the core of the business can remain unchanged.

[02:11] It's how we're going to package the services we deliver or that the services we sell to

[02:16] a customer.

[02:17] How are we going to get them to perceive what we're selling?

[02:19] We gathered the data.

[02:20] What we're going to figure out the constraint was that they should get way more rebukings,

[02:22] which I thought was an offer and packaging issue, which is we need to sell the solution

[02:25] sell the goal.

[02:26] So number four is, okay, if we assume that we're going to make this new transition to this

[02:30] new offer, new packaging, we have to anticipate.

[02:33] We call it killing zombies, which is one way of putting it.

[02:37] Inticipate the obstacles or objections that people are going to throw at you ahead of

[02:42] time.

[02:43] Write this in neon marker above your sales team, which is it's way harder to get someone

[02:47] by after you presented the price.

[02:49] Because now they're like he's trying to sell me.

[02:52] So we have to counter that before we become salespeople in their mind, we are a trusted

[02:56] expert, ideally if we're positioned well and you should be that way if you know what you're

[03:00] talking about.

[03:01] And I like to use the frame of childlike curiosity.

[03:03] I always tilt my head.

[03:05] I probably even did it subconsciously just now.

[03:07] You tilt your head when you ask the question because it's non-threatening.

[03:10] You're like, huh, that's weird.

[03:12] What change between then and now?

[03:13] Just so I understand.

[03:14] Then they can tell you, rather than be like, you said that your husband said that you're

[03:17] like, he supports you, you can't say that now you have to buy.

[03:21] Doesn't work that way.

[03:22] If you win the argument in a sale, you lose the sale.

[03:24] The only way that you win the sale is being willing to lose being right.

[03:28] And so the fifth step in this is the ongoing step is that you implement the diagnostic sales

[03:32] process.

[03:33] So it's implementation.

[03:34] So now that I just outlined the five steps, let me deep dive into the implementation

[03:38] of the actual business and how we did this.

[03:40] With this particular business, when we bought them, I spent four hours with our director

[03:44] sales and we outlined the new sales process we wanted to implement.

[03:48] And as soon as we implemented that sales process, we four acts, LTV, progress, remaining.

[03:54] How much people paid us and went from 200 to 800.

[03:58] So really big job and we, the crazy thing about this is that we didn't change what we delivered.

[04:04] We only changed how we presented it.

[04:06] And so this is the key of how we create value, how we scale companies, how we grow

[04:10] companies.

[04:11] And many companies keep these things as secrets, as their special sauce.

[04:16] And I just fundamentally believe that the more we put out, the more we get back and said

[04:20] that's why I operate this way.

[04:21] All right.

[04:22] So I will hold nothing back and this is something that I call the diagnostic sales process.

[04:25] Now to be very clear, the diagnostic sales process is one of two different sales or maybe

[04:30] three different sales processes, big picture that you can have in a business.

[04:34] One is a transactional set all the way on this extreme.

[04:40] So on one side, you've got transactional sales.

[04:44] And on this side, you've got enterprise sales, which is like relational sales.

[04:49] Like you think you're selling some big Fortune 500 company, you have to get stakeholders

[04:53] involved, get budget approval, there's all that stuff.

[04:56] And on transactional side, you've got like high velocity sales, we're talking 20, 30

[05:00] minute sales, a guy who stands over the car wash sales car wash.

[05:03] Somebody sells gym membership transactional.

[05:05] And then you've kind of got like this middle where you might sell something that's a

[05:08] little bit higher ticket, but it's a little bit more custom.

[05:10] All right.

[05:11] Now what we did was I took their sale from here, a purely transactional sale and moved

[05:17] it towards custom.

[05:18] All right.

[05:19] Now, in a transactional sale, you typically fit the customer to the product.

[05:23] And so let's say that I sell pets.

[05:26] All right.

[05:27] So I sell pets.

[05:28] If somebody comes in, I'm going to basically spend all my effort listening to what

[05:32] they say they want and then telling them how this pen fits their needs.

[05:37] Before I have to basically say your needs are wrong, let me educate you more, and this

[05:41] actually solves all your problems.

[05:43] And so those are pretty much the only two approaches you can take in a transactional

[05:46] sale.

[05:47] Now the advantages of having this type of sale is that it's really fast.

[05:50] They tend to be lower taken in general.

[05:53] And from an operational perspective in the business, you don't need to personalize anything.

[05:57] And so you get the sales team and the sales process to basically orient everyone like

[06:02] a funnel down to one solution.

[06:03] And then you just make a ton of these solutions and you get lots of efficiencies because

[06:07] you only have to produce one thing.

[06:09] This, the custom sale is a harder sale.

[06:12] So our easier sale to do, but harder on the operational side.

[06:16] And so the magic happens when you can actually bridge the product component of transactional,

[06:23] which you say, okay, we only sell these types of widgets.

[06:26] This is the only thing we deliver.

[06:28] But I can do it in a way that feels custom, feels personalized.

[06:33] All right, so I'm going to give you two examples.

[06:35] And I'll explain this one in a second.

[06:36] This chart that I have here, which if you could take your recurring revenue from that to that,

[06:40] just by changing how you sell.

[06:41] If you'd want to do that, hang tight.

[06:43] We're going to break that up the process.

[06:44] So if I had, because I did this in the gym world too, which is part of why our gyms make

[06:51] more money.

[06:52] So a traditional sale looks something like this.

[06:55] Someone comes in.

[06:57] So this is traditional.

[06:59] And you say, we have a membership that's, you know, whatever, $99 per month.

[07:02] All right, that's your membership.

[07:04] And you say, our membership has this, this, this, this, this, this, this, and this.

[07:08] And you want that, right?

[07:10] Because it's going to help you accomplish all your dreams.

[07:12] Okay, sometimes you get people, sometimes you don't.

[07:16] The what I do, we do something called a diagnostic.

[07:21] And so the first thing is that when the person walks in the door, we get them to fill

[07:27] out a pre-sale questionnaire.

[07:29] And so that's like an application in a digital process.

[07:31] But an in-person process it follows the same logic, which, by the way, Internet businesses

[07:36] follow local businesses.

[07:37] Local businesses can also model Internet businesses.

[07:39] When you find out something works in one place, which I think has been one of the big

[07:41] advantages of I've had in business, is that I try and put it in a completely different place

[07:44] and it often works too if you understand the concept.

[07:47] And so we fill out a pre-sale questionnaire.

[07:48] Now the pre-sale questionnaire simply walks them through all the reasons they walked in

[07:52] a day.

[07:53] And it asks them the same question in multiple different ways.

[07:55] So it's like, hey, like, what brought you in today?

[07:58] What's the problem you're dealing with?

[07:59] How long you've been dealing with it?

[08:01] If you had to quantify how much this has cost you financially, what would it be?

[08:06] If it continued for five years, how much worse would the situation be?

[08:10] And so the whole point is we're trying to agitate team.

[08:11] We're trying to bring attention to this problem and elevate its importance.

[08:15] So that's what the pre-sale questionnaire does.

[08:17] Now, the second thing is we get info.

[08:20] This is very key.

[08:21] So when someone comes in after that, we say, hey, I want to set up your account profile.

[08:25] And so when you do that, you collect their information.

[08:28] And this is the key part.

[08:29] You get their credit card.

[08:30] Now you're like, wait a second.

[08:32] I'm getting credit card, but I haven't sold anything exactly.

[08:35] And you do that so that when you do sell something later, you don't have to ask for it.

[08:39] Now, you get the pre-sale.

[08:41] They're like, wow, I really do need this thing.

[08:42] You say, hey, let me complete your customer profile to standard procedure.

[08:45] No big deal.

[08:46] All right.

[08:46] Then you get their info.

[08:47] Now, if they're like, well, I don't want to give you my credit card.

[08:49] You're just like, it's just how the system works, it's how we complete profiles.

[08:53] And then they'll give it to you.

[08:54] All right.

[08:55] So from there, this is where the special, the special magic

[09:00] that's unique to each individual business happens.

[09:03] So in the weight loss business, I want to understand where they're goal at.

[09:06] So we say, what's current?

[09:11] And then four, what's desired?

[09:15] Where are you now?

[09:17] Where would you like to be?

[09:18] And then this one, you ask them.

[09:21] So what's the obstacle?

[09:24] What's in between these two things is the obstacle, right?

[09:28] Current, I've got an obstacle getting the way I might

[09:30] desired.

[09:30] That's all we're asking in the process.

[09:32] Now, in weight loss and in most businesses, the thing the person thinks is in the way

[09:38] is often not the real thing in the way.

[09:40] And that's because they've never had this conversation before.

[09:42] They clearly haven't solved the solution, and that's why they're coming to you.

[09:45] And so you want to just get their words more so so that you can explain it back to them

[09:50] using the language they gave you.

[09:52] All right.

[09:52] And so in the weight loss world, for example, instead of selling a membership,

[09:57] I would say, OK, well, it sounds like you need these three things.

[10:00] Finanistration Accountability.

[10:01] Finanistwise, you need to work out X days a week.

[10:03] Intritionwise, you need to eat this food at this time, and we can help you

[10:07] meal prep the stuff.

[10:08] So you've got when you've got your restaurants, you can still stick on it.

[10:10] And you need accountability, because if I give you the best

[10:14] finis plan in the best nutrition plan, but you don't show up,

[10:16] doesn't matter.

[10:17] Accountability is what makes the whole thing work.

[10:18] Great.

[10:19] Finanistration Accountability, easy three step framework, fantastic.

[10:22] Now, this is where it becomes diagnostic.

[10:25] Now, most customers, and this is why this is where the magic happens,

[10:30] is that even if you still deliver the same thing.

[10:33] So fundamentally, when I switch the sales process, the gyms remain the same.

[10:36] They still have workouts.

[10:37] They still have nutritionals.

[10:38] They still accountability.

[10:39] Nothing changed.

[10:40] But how we present it changes.

[10:42] And so rather than saying, hey, I'm going to sell a four-week thing or a six-week thing,

[10:46] I say, hey, you're currently 200 pounds.

[10:50] OK?

[10:52] Now, what's your high school weight?

[10:53] She says, I want to get to 140.

[10:55] She says, OK, cool.

[10:56] You want to get to 140.

[10:57] This is your desired.

[10:58] OK?

[10:59] So you have a 60 pound difference.

[11:00] Now, what we found is that we don't want people to lose more than

[11:04] pound and half to two pounds a week.

[11:06] So let's just be conservative and call it one and a half.

[11:09] So that I take out my calculator, and I say, what's one and a half times 60?

[11:13] Which would be, other way, round, maybe 65 by one and a half, which is 45.

[11:18] So 45 weeks is how long it's going to take us to take you from 200 to 140.

[11:27] So you lose a pound and a half a week.

[11:28] It's going to take 45 weeks.

[11:30] And so, six, present, price in relation to goal.

[11:41] So you say, awesome.

[11:42] So we currently charge 99 bucks a week.

[11:44] We can get you there in 45 weeks, which means it's $4500.

[11:49] And that means, and for us, I added a guarantee on the back, which

[11:53] said, hey, if you show up to the workouts for the next 45 weeks,

[11:55] and you log your food, and you don't lose the way,

[11:57] I'll keep working with you for free until you do.

[11:59] So that means, as the translation, this is a key part of the script.

[12:02] So that means when you pay this $4500, it means that you can count that

[12:05] weight for good.

[12:07] You can put it out of your mind.

[12:08] Pay me this money.

[12:09] We're going to get there.

[12:10] One way or another, as long as you follow the steps, you're going to follow

[12:12] the steps, right?

[12:12] Great.

[12:14] And so here, you're trying to sell 99 bucks a month, or whatever.

[12:19] This would be 99 bucks a week, if I was doing a equivalent pricing.

[12:22] Right?

[12:23] So this would be like a somewhere private program.

[12:25] But by positioning it this way, I'm not selling a membership anymore.

[12:29] I'm selling exactly what they want in putting a price tag on it.

[12:32] And saying, you want to get to 140.

[12:33] It's going to take this long.

[12:35] And I'll guarantee that you'll get there, provided you follow these steps.

[12:40] And then they say, wow, that's awesome.

[12:42] They say, well, if you want, I can save you a little bit of money.

[12:48] You want to save a little bit of money.

[12:49] And they're like, yeah, I want to save a little bit of money.

[12:51] Well, if you prepay, you can save 10% today.

[12:55] So I can save you 450 bucks.

[12:57] You know what I mean?

[12:58] You know that?

[12:59] That's what most people do.

[13:00] Great.

[13:01] You want to use the car JF and file?

[13:03] Done.

[13:06] So that's the process.

[13:07] Now, I took this process and applied it to a completely different

[13:12] service business that we own.

[13:14] That's a chain that this is a little bit more medical.

[13:17] But the concept still applied, which is, and this is the key part is you have to figure

[13:21] out for whatever it is that you sell what the current is versus what the desire it is.

[13:27] So if I were a painter, and I was painting houses, sounds crazy.

[13:33] So hey, so you currently have this thing.

[13:37] You want a completely painted house.

[13:40] And so now for them, this is more us do it for you rather than self service.

[13:45] I'm going to have to, you're not painting your house and them helping you.

[13:50] So they're actually going to paint the house.

[13:52] So then we just try and think, how can we sell to goal and break it into a price that

[13:57] we tie to that?

[13:59] And so it'd be like, okay, so we're going to need four coats of paint and it's going

[14:02] to take this period of time.

[14:04] And then at that point, your whole house is going to be weatherproof.

[14:07] And so that means that when you pay this price, that's what you're going to get by

[14:10] this state.

[14:11] And if we don't get it done by that date, I'm going to give you this.

[14:14] And that way we can relieve their risk that it's not going to happen and we tie the purchase

[14:18] to the outcome.

[14:20] So this particular business, when I bought it, I bought into it.

[14:25] It was a business that they had really good lead gen and they have a good product, but

[14:31] they didn't have good packaging.

[14:33] And I saw the opportunity because I knew that if I installed my sales process into their

[14:38] business, I could make it make a lot more money.

[14:41] And so if you have the opportunity to like four ex-a-business without opening new locations,

[14:46] you do that.

[14:47] And so that's more or less what we did.

[14:48] So I actually wrote down the new sales process, it took me four hours.

[14:51] So I wrote down the new sales process and then I presented to the management team.

[14:55] And they were like, wow, this is the most valuable thing we've ever had happened to our

[14:58] business.

[14:59] And I said, great.

[15:00] So let me know when you do it across all the locations and let's keep buying and opening

[15:03] new ones.

[15:04] And so 18 months later, we have 32 occasions and the recurring revenue.

[15:07] And that time period has gone up and the average revenue per customer went from $200

[15:14] to $800 from this one process.

[15:20] And that was because before this, they were selling one off transactions.

[15:23] They were saying, hey, we'll do this service for you to think of it like Botox.

[15:26] So we're going to do filler.

[15:27] We're going to do something this one time.

[15:31] And so rather than just say, sure, give us a call when you want it again, which is pretty

[15:35] much what the process was before this.

[15:37] I say, hey, you want to look a certain way.

[15:40] You're not here because you want filler.

[15:41] You're here because you want to look a certain way.

[15:43] So if I show this chart to you a face is and filler densities, where do you see yourself

[15:50] on here currently?

[15:51] Now you let them self identify.

[15:52] You can't be like, look, make sure you're ugly.

[15:54] You can't say that.

[15:55] So you guys say, where are you on this chart?

[15:57] And then they say this.

[15:58] Now in the weight loss sale, I got them to step on the scale.

[16:00] The scale code you've found.

[16:01] Not me.

[16:02] It's just pointed third part.

[16:03] You know what I mean?

[16:04] So you get them to pick how ugly they are.

[16:07] All right.

[16:08] And then you say, how pretty do you want to be?

[16:09] Now everyone's going to say, I want to be super pretty.

[16:11] But here's the beautiful thing.

[16:13] When they pick how pretty they want to be, they're the one who set the goal.

[16:16] And that means that the price came from them.

[16:18] And you know where I picked this up was yogurt stores.

[16:21] So one of the things that I thought was genius about like yogurt land and things like that

[16:25] was if you go to a store and then they fill up your stuff behind the counter.

[16:29] And then they say, hey, it's eight bucks.

[16:31] You're like, man, what the hell?

[16:32] This place is so expensive.

[16:33] And if they give you the cup and you fill it up and you put it on the scale, you're

[16:37] like, man, I'm a fat ass.

[16:39] Same pricing.

[16:41] But because I had control over what I picked, I'm the one who's responsible for the

[16:45] decision.

[16:46] And so by saying, where are you on this chart?

[16:48] And again, this is where the magic happens.

[16:50] I said, current desired.

[16:51] That's where the thinking behind how I'm going to structure a sale is where the experience

[16:57] that's where the expertise, that's where it comes in.

[16:59] This is the process.

[17:00] And hopefully you guys can take this for your business and think like, okay.

[17:03] What's current?

[17:04] What do they really want?

[17:05] They're not buying lip filler, they're not buying a painted house.

[17:09] They're buying an image in their mind of what they want that house to signify or what

[17:12] it means to them.

[17:13] And this lady's not buying filler.

[17:15] She's trying to buy a certain look.

[17:16] She wants people to think about her a certain way.

[17:18] When people want what she walks in the room, she wants guys to turn their heads

[17:21] to them because she's probably getting a little older.

[17:23] They're not turning their heads as much and she still misses that.

[17:25] And she pay anything to get that.

[17:27] And so say, you're ugly now, how pretty do you want to be?

[17:29] We say, cool.

[17:30] So for us to get you from here to here, it's going to take us 45 weeks.

[17:34] It's going to take us Botox filler and plastic surgery.

[17:39] Whatever, we're going to have to hit you with a pretty shovel and bring it back

[17:41] to life.

[17:42] We have to do this.

[17:43] And it's going to take this many weeks for us to reverse this level of aging or at least

[17:46] take these cross feet out or whatever it is.

[17:49] And so we tie where you're at to where you want to go.

[17:51] And then our solution is only the vehicle that delivers this outcome.

[17:55] And so that is the moment that you present the price because they picked where they

[18:00] were, where they want to go.

[18:01] And then you as the expert explain the path to getting there.

[18:04] So they picked the before and after and you just use your expertise.

[18:07] This is what we found best to get people to hear who start where you're at.

[18:10] And so we found out that this opportunity existed within this particular business because

[18:15] I had my sales director, Secret Shop them.

[18:17] So mind you, this is brick and mortar, chain.

[18:19] We have a lot of locations.

[18:20] So we can sneak our way in.

[18:21] It's harder if you have four sales guys who do all the sales.

[18:24] They'll just tell the owner.

[18:25] So we wanted a secret shop before we actually completed the investment.

[18:29] And so when he went in, he was, I asked him.

[18:31] I saw I went through this checklist.

[18:32] I was like, OK, so did they give you some sort of pre-style question?

[18:35] And he was like, no, it's like, OK, great.

[18:38] Did they ask you for your credit card or did they ask you for information?

[18:41] Anything before you got the service?

[18:42] And he was like, no, I was like, fantastic.

[18:46] What else did they do?

[18:47] They have you set, you know, pick where you're at and where what your goal is.

[18:51] He said, yeah, they did have me pick where I was at.

[18:54] But not where I wanted to go.

[18:56] So they just had him pick, OK, how ugly are you?

[18:58] And he was like, OK, now, again, not completely flawed.

[19:00] I want to be really clear here.

[19:01] Like, this is a look at 14 locations.

[19:03] They're not idiots.

[19:04] They had the pain, the agitated the pain.

[19:06] They said, listen, this is how ugly you are on this scale that we invented.

[19:09] And you're here.

[19:10] You're a seven ugly.

[19:11] Great.

[19:12] So he checked this.

[19:13] But he didn't get to say where he wanted to be.

[19:16] So then from there, he just went right into the service.

[19:19] And then when he came out, he just gave them the card to pay for the service.

[19:24] And that was it.

[19:25] And he's walked out the door.

[19:27] And I was like, wait, so they didn't actually ask you to buy a package or get into

[19:32] some membership or anything.

[19:33] And he was like, well, they tried to upsell me this one product at one point.

[19:36] But this was the price point.

[19:38] And the price point was like 20 bucks or something.

[19:40] And I knew what the average customer's worth, which was like 200 at the time.

[19:43] I was like, that's, by the way, if you're going to do upsells, you want the price points

[19:48] usually be five times more than the current price.

[19:51] Because if you get 20% of people, so customers are fractal.

[19:55] So we're going to go into a little side-plice here.

[19:56] But it'll be worth it for you since we're talking about sales.

[20:01] So you've heard of 80-20.

[20:02] So if you've got 100 people, the top 20% and you've got the 80 underneath.

[20:10] These are the people.

[20:11] 80-20 have five times the spending power of these people.

[20:14] And so because of that, if you get 20% of people to buy something that's five times

[20:18] as expensive, so let's say my current thing is $1,000.

[20:22] So I'm going to have an upsell.

[20:24] I want my upsell to be $5,000.

[20:27] Because of 20% ticket, then it's 20% times 5,000, which means I add $1,000 to my average

[20:33] ticket.

[20:34] So I go from $2,000 or so or $1,000 per customer to $2,000 per customer.

[20:42] And so when I heard that their upsell was 10%, it'd be like, my upsell is 100 bucks.

[20:49] Okay, fine.

[20:50] Maybe 20% take that.

[20:51] So I go from $1,000 to $1,000 to 20, who cares?

[20:56] Like why bother?

[20:58] And fundamentally, again, smart business owners, and they were upselling products, which means

[21:03] there's no real delivery in a brick and mortar service business.

[21:05] So they could just hand the product, make the money.

[21:07] And I think they were using it more for commissions for their staff to increase the average

[21:11] pay, which a different objective entirely and totally fine.

[21:15] But I was only looking at this from how do I take customers who were worth $200 and make

[21:19] them my goal was to get a more than $1,000.

[21:21] And I'm going to keep getting there until we get $2,000.

[21:24] But I think that we can get it to $1,000.

[21:26] And so we secret shopped them number one, which, by the way, if you have a team of people

[21:34] who are currently selling your stuff, secret shopped them and then be horrified by what

[21:39] you listen to on the phone or what you see in person, because you have this beautiful

[21:43] idea of what you think your sales process is and it's a nightmare.

[21:47] It's an absolute nightmare.

[21:48] If they remember half of it, you'll be stoked.

[21:50] And so if you run an environment, especially in a lower wage environment.

[21:54] So if you're brick and mortar, you have a chain of locations and you have to take low-scal

[21:57] labor and teach them a sales process.

[22:00] You've like the expertise in sales comes in down to how easy and simple you can make the

[22:06] process.

[22:07] And so that comes down to like, can I automate parts of the point of sale so that they

[22:12] can't move forward without doing this checkbox.

[22:15] And by doing this checkbox, they have to ask the question.

[22:17] So it forces scripted here.

[22:19] Now training sales, not into this video, but you want to basically repeat the process

[22:23] over and over and over and over and over until they're sick of it.

[22:26] Until they say like, yes mom, would you like to have, do you have your credit, you

[22:29] want to use the credit card on file?

[22:30] Like, until they're saying it, like they can breathe it, they can think they can say without

[22:34] thinking about it.

[22:35] That's when you maybe just started to have a team that's well trained.

[22:40] Now that we finish these seven pieces of the dog nostic, I want to add one more bonus

[22:43] because you're like, wait a second.

[22:44] So where's the recurring revenue?

[22:47] Great observation and Drew.

[22:48] Okay.

[22:49] So the number eight is transition of recurring.

[22:53] All right.

[22:54] I remember this.

[22:55] I'll give you two separate stories that will drive this home.

[22:57] So a friend of mine has a recurring membership that he sells.

[23:02] And he sells it at, I think you saw in a 300 bucks a month and he couldn't get people

[23:05] to take past three months.

[23:06] And so he tried all these different gimmicks and things and he just couldn't crack three

[23:10] months of LTV.

[23:11] Now that could have been a pricing issue, whatever.

[23:14] So this is what he did.

[23:16] He stopped selling it at $300 a month, a month, a month and started selling as a $10,000

[23:20] program with 36 month of interest refinancing.

[23:24] And so when people bought, they were buying a $10,000 price point, but they got an amazing

[23:28] payment plan.

[23:30] And so he didn't change anything about what he sold.

[23:32] But that took his average customer from three months to eight months.

[23:37] So we're talking about a $900 or three times three hundred to eight times three hundred.

[23:42] Not kind of changing a business, life changing.

[23:45] In terms of how much money you can make.

[23:46] The second one was I had a different friend who had a continuity program.

[23:50] He was an agency.

[23:51] And what he did was he realized he had turned in his business.

[23:54] And so he said, you know, people are way less likely to turn out of a payment plan, same

[23:58] as the other one.

[23:59] Then they are out of a monthly recurring revenue stream.

[24:01] And so what you call it to the customer can affect the likelihood that they pay.

[24:07] But as far as the business is concerned, you just want payments that are regular.

[24:11] And all you do to take a program and take it from a payment plan to recurring in terms

[24:17] of how it actually looks in fields is you just put an automatic recurring at the end

[24:21] of the program.

[24:22] And so when someone buys this big thing and you make a payment plan and then it recurs

[24:26] into the exact same price of the payment plan, you just move the pieces around, but the

[24:30] likely they stick his way higher.

[24:32] And so that's exactly what we did as the last step in the diagnostic sales process.

[24:36] And I wanted to highlight this point for you because I've done it in every business.

[24:39] And so we give someone the option to prepay.

[24:42] You can give if you want a little bit more aggressive, you can 20% off if they prepay today.

[24:46] If you want to have one step done below that, which is what I like to do, you can 10% off

[24:50] if they do half down and then make the rest of this payments.

[24:54] And if they still can't do that, then I take the whole thing and I spread it over, let's

[24:58] say, our 45 weeks.

[25:00] And so I'd say, okay, it's 9 out of 9 bucks a week, 9 out of week, and there you go.

[25:03] Now they go from 99 a week to 80 bucks a week if they prepay the whole thing.

[25:09] And they go from 99 bucks a week to 90 a week if they prepay half.

[25:14] And here's the key part.

[25:16] Is that when we present the price, you present it at the highest rate.

[25:21] So you present it at the payment plan.

[25:22] Let me walk you through this to things important.

[25:24] Well, I'm going to put it here and set off the flip screen screen screen.

[25:27] All right.

[25:28] So, you have your full boat.

[25:30] I'll say, full interest price.

[25:34] So for us, in our example, it's 4500 bucks.

[25:36] 45 weeks times 99 roughly.

[25:39] All right.

[25:40] So this is our full boat price.

[25:41] We have our prepayment discount in full, which is minus 20%.

[25:47] All right.

[25:48] So for us, it's going to be minus what is that?

[25:50] 900?

[25:51] Yeah, 900 from there.

[25:52] So that's 5600.

[25:53] So, the other way.

[25:54] 30, 600.

[25:55] 3600.

[25:56] If they do half down, you say, I'll let you save 450 bucks or 10%.

[26:05] So 4050.

[26:06] All right.

[26:07] All right.

[26:08] So this is 10%.

[26:10] That's minus 10%.

[26:11] That's minus 20%.

[26:12] Now, the reason this is so important is think about the alternative.

[26:15] Think about, and this is what most people do.

[26:17] So listen to me, Andrew.

[26:18] Most people do this.

[26:20] They present the price is $3600.

[26:23] And then they say, oh, well, we have payment plans that we have interest on.

[26:27] And so we do, we do have 10% interest if you could put half down.

[26:30] And we have 20% interest if you put nothing down.

[26:34] And you just go on to a straight payment plan.

[26:37] Which one would you rather buy?

[26:39] If on one hand, you have a $4500 price thing, which anchors you high.

[26:43] And you say, or you can get a benefit for prepaying today, rather than you think about

[26:47] $3600, you're considering it.

[26:48] And then they say, oh, it's even more, even though you're just considering this tag,

[26:52] guess what?

[26:53] You have to pay way more now because you can't afford it.

[26:56] You have to pay more.

[26:58] Banks do it all the time.

[26:59] And guess what?

[27:00] Everyone hates banks.

[27:01] So if banks want to fix their process, Mr. Bank, maybe this will work.

[27:03] Who knows?

[27:04] This is that this is how you present the price because you get the benefit of a price anchor.

[27:08] And you get to be the good guy for getting them to pay upfront, rather than the bad guy

[27:13] for them not being able to.

[27:15] So we're going to go through step eight in the more transition process for the sale.

[27:22] And so I want to just walk you through step downs.

[27:24] And so this is super important to understand from a sales perspective.

[27:27] So we'll call this sales step downs.

[27:31] This is, by the way, a preview for my next book coming out $100 or anyways.

[27:36] So sales step downs is one of the things that we have.

[27:39] So obviously the first thing we're going to present is a pre-payment, which is paying

[27:42] full today, pre-payment.

[27:44] By the way, you've probably noticed from any of my content, I don't say paid in fools.

[27:48] And that's because that's a salesman term, not a customer benefit.

[27:53] If you pre-pay, you get a benefit.

[27:55] Whereas paid in fools, like I got all the cash to front, good for me.

[27:58] And so I have trained myself because I used to say paid in fools,

[28:01] pifks, pifks, whatever's pifts.

[28:03] Like all of that stuff I used to do as a salesman, sales leader.

[28:06] And then I also heard my team saying that to customers.

[28:09] But hey, if you want to pay in full today, it's just kind of gross.

[28:13] And so I prefer to say, hey, we have a pre-payment discount.

[28:16] And so training that just little pros at for you.

[28:18] So number one is pre-pay.

[28:20] Number two is we do discount with partial.

[28:27] So this is the half-down.

[28:30] Oops.

[28:31] Half-down.

[28:34] Here you can also do in-house.

[28:35] Well, this is whatever.

[28:36] This is credit card or third-party.

[28:40] So if you have like most businesses that sell legitimate services have third-party

[28:45] financing solutions that already exist.

[28:47] And so I promise you, there is a banker somewhere who started a business to service

[28:52] this emerging market of whatever it is that you do, who says, obituary can help finance transactions.

[28:57] Now the prices they charge for that financing will differ based on how risky your business

[29:02] is.

[29:03] And so there is financing for casinos.

[29:06] If you want to get a loan to go gamble more, there is financing for that, but they

[29:11] will charge you a lot of money.

[29:12] And so that being the extreme on the other hand, if you want to find it to house, there's

[29:15] obviously huge mortgage industry.

[29:17] And so from every step in between, there are partners who will step in as third-party

[29:21] and take on that risk for you for a price.

[29:23] So I prefer, can I get the prepayment because it's easiest and fastest?

[29:27] If not, usually a third-party that I set up so that my customers can get financing.

[29:32] If we don't move past either of these two things, then I try to go with a partial, with

[29:36] some level of discount, not as much as here, but a little bit.

[29:39] And if they still say no, then I go for continuity, which is, why do we just make a payment

[29:48] plan on the thing?

[29:49] And in this particular business, because what they were doing before was simply rebuking

[29:52] people for another section of service, we just had this be the automatic, like everyone

[29:58] gets rebuked.

[29:59] And that became an internal saying, like, I like having mantras within sales teams, which

[30:04] is like, everyone buys something, like everyone buys something.

[30:08] There's no reason so much is not buying something.

[30:10] And so sure we're going to reprieve, maybe a partial, okay, final do a payment plan that's

[30:15] whatever, call it, you know, 250 times 4, great, that's our $1,000, that's our $1,000

[30:20] plan that we're getting people to buy and pay 250 today, and then three more times.

[30:25] And you can do it every other month if it's a more intermittent service, whatever,

[30:28] just match the payments to when they get delivery.

[30:32] And then fine if they're like, well, I can't do any of those things.

[30:34] It's like, cool, let's just, let's just book the next time we want to come in.

[30:37] That's it.

[30:38] And so this is the final of the process in terms of the steps, that we might offer someone.

[30:43] We just walk through this whole process and you're like, wow, maybe that's a lot of

[30:46] work, I have to use my brain power, but welcome to business.

[30:48] Let me tell you why it's worth it.

[30:51] So these are the actual stats and I put the numbers without the names to keep it nice,

[30:54] open, look for you.

[30:55] So number one is that they had 9% of revenue that was recurring within this product line.

[31:01] So they had 9% that was occurring after we implemented this process, 60%.

[31:09] They took this 9% to 60% of this product line within the company.

[31:12] So awesome.

[31:14] Number two, they had basically no membership at all because they just weren't, it wasn't

[31:20] even an option, not really.

[31:22] And we were to push that to 30, that's a 30.

[31:26] 30% into member ships.

[31:29] This included payment plans, this is just member ships.

[31:33] And then we went from getting one additional extra visit on average per person meaning

[31:37] two to getting four to six visits per customer by introducing this sales process.

[31:46] And from a money perspective, we went from $20,000 when we bought the business, so

[31:51] might you.

[31:52] This business made a lot more money than this single product line or the service line.

[31:56] But this is where I wanted to invest my time because I thought there was a huge opportunity

[32:00] here because I saw from the secret shopper, from the constraints.

[32:03] I thought this was a big area of attack.

[32:05] So there were only 20,000 months, which didn't business the size is not a lot.

[32:08] And then however many of you have to be dots this later, over 250,000 per month, in added.

[32:18] And it continues to grow.

[32:19] And this compounds.

[32:20] And that's the beauty of this type of sales process and repackaging of what someone

[32:24] already sells.

[32:26] And so we went from 9 to 60, 0 to 30% of memberships from one visit to four to six visits

[32:30] and from 20 to 250,000, so we more than 10X, the recurring revenue of this business

[32:35] by following a diagnostic process rather than just selling some traditional one off thing.

[32:39] I have two books on Amazon $100 off for a 100 dollar lease.

[32:42] You can go check them out if you have our completely poor.

[32:47] You take this out.

[32:48] It's all free and joy.

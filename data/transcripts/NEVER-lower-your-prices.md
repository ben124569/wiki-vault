[00:00] Boop!

[00:01] One decision.

[00:02] Five million dollars a year.

[00:04] I lost as a result of this.

[00:07] I want to say one of the scariest decisions I've ever made in my entire life, which was

[00:10] when I had my gyms, I was selling a boot camp at the time.

[00:15] This is before I knew a lot about pricing, and I was charging $99 a month.

[00:19] And I got really fed up at one point and I was like, I don't think I'm helping people.

[00:23] I want to have some of my private, because this is where people were really going to

[00:25] transform their bodies, and I want to sell with conviction.

[00:28] So, just keynote, side note, pro tip, life hack.

[00:32] If you can sell something that you truly believe in, you'll make a lot more money.

[00:34] And so I had gotten to the point where I didn't really believe in boot camp as a vehicle

[00:39] for personal transformation in terms of body-wise.

[00:41] And so I was so convicted about our summer private program, because clients were getting

[00:44] way better results there, that I wanted to switch all my clients over that.

[00:47] Now, I couldn't do that in $99 a month.

[00:49] And so I sent a mass letter out to my customers that said, we were going to go from $99 a

[00:55] month to $299 per month.

[00:59] So I was going to triple my prices.

[01:02] Add more value, but I was going to triple my prices.

[01:04] And at the end of this video, I'll tell you what happened when I sent that email out.

[01:07] Now, what I want to do is tell you a secondary story of a similar situation that happened

[01:11] later on in my business career.

[01:14] And it was, we were selling our program at $42,000 per year, at the time.

[01:22] And that was being billed at 800 bucks a week, roughly.

[01:25] And I wanted to decrease our turn.

[01:30] And so I was trying to figure out a way to decrease our turn to get extent increase our

[01:33] lifetime value per customer.

[01:35] And I kept all my team and all that stuff that we have to lower our price.

[01:39] We have to lower our price.

[01:40] And I hate lowering prices.

[01:42] I don't like lowering prices.

[01:43] It just generally doesn't mean you make more money.

[01:46] After a long time, I said, you know what?

[01:48] Fine.

[01:49] We're going to add more.

[01:50] And we're going to go to $600 per week.

[01:52] All right.

[01:53] That's what we're going to do.

[01:54] Which if you're doing the math, it's like 31.

[01:56] Okay.

[01:57] That's what I decided to do.

[01:58] Let me tell you what happened in each of these scenarios.

[02:01] As soon as I made this change right here, all right.

[02:05] So what I did was I bid this big announcement.

[02:06] I said, we're going to roll out this new additional services program.

[02:10] And I did this huge presentation, this huge pitch.

[02:13] I stacked it, stacked it, stacked it, stacked it.

[02:14] And then I was like, and you're going to get all this stuff.

[02:18] And you're all going to get a discount.

[02:19] And that's what I said.

[02:20] And everyone was like, yay, I actually did have one person complaining to me.

[02:23] They said, why are you doing this now?

[02:25] You should have been discounting us before, which just goes to show you that no one will ever be happy with it.

[02:29] You're doing it.

[02:30] I was literally saying that they can pay less and I got somebody else out with me.

[02:31] And so anyways, I decreased the price.

[02:34] And though this is what ended up happening.

[02:37] My turn remained completely unchanged.

[02:40] And I lost $5 million per year in profit.

[02:47] Boop.

[02:48] One decision.

[02:49] $5 million a year.

[02:51] I lost as a result of this.

[02:53] And so I can tell you, firsthand, most times when you lower your prices, you make a lot less money.

[02:59] And so what happened to me is that my overhead stayed the same.

[03:02] It actually went up a little bit.

[03:03] So I added about 100K a month and overhead to my business so that I could add for this

[03:07] new service.

[03:08] All right.

[03:09] And then I decreased my price by 25%.

[03:13] So imagine cutting top line by 25%, which is literally what I did.

[03:17] And by making this little beautiful combination.

[03:20] So I increased my cost by $1 million and I decreased my top line by $400,000 per month

[03:27] at the time for that business.

[03:28] It sucked because here's the beautiful thing.

[03:30] I thought, hey, if I decreased this price, if I can cut our turn by half, right, which

[03:35] is what I thought I was going to be able to do, if I could cut my turn in half, let's say

[03:39] from 10% to 5%, I would still 2xLTV.

[03:43] So I'd rather decrease by 25%, but then 2xLTV.

[03:47] I'll take that trade every time.

[03:49] Aha!

[03:50] But that's not what happened.

[03:52] Turn stayed the same.

[03:54] And I just lost 25% of the top line, which if we were running a 50% margin business, right,

[03:59] I just lost half my profit, which we weren't.

[04:01] We actually running a 70% margin business at the time.

[04:04] And so I actually cut my income by a third, which sucked for that business.

[04:08] It was not fun.

[04:09] I highly recommend not doing it.

[04:10] And so that was the first thing that happened.

[04:13] So let me tell you the story that I started with, this puppy, all right, where I had

[04:18] my clients, and I told them all, hey, this is what we're going to do.

[04:22] I'm going to give you two weeks for free, so I did have to front this labor, two weeks

[04:26] free of this new service.

[04:28] It's much better.

[04:30] You're going to get way more personalized attention.

[04:32] You're going to be lifting weights.

[04:33] You're going to learn form, all the stuff stuff.

[04:35] And I said after those two weeks, you were going to automatically all be enrolled at 299 per

[04:40] month.

[04:41] Let me know if this is going to materially affect your life and you won't be able to buy

[04:44] groceries as a result of this decision.

[04:46] So here's what happened.

[04:47] One third of my customers left.

[04:51] They said, Alex, you suck.

[04:52] I can't believe you're raising prices on us.

[04:54] Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, two thirds of them stayed at three times the price.

[04:59] What happened?

[05:01] I two-ext the revenue of my business.

[05:04] And I serviced only two thirds of my customers, which means my cost of fulfillment went

[05:10] down and my revenue went up.

[05:12] Excellent combination.

[05:14] And so by doing that one thing, I was able to more than two-ex the profit of my business.

[05:20] And so I tell both of these cautionary tales as I was petrified to make both of these

[05:25] decisions.

[05:27] One of them dramatically increased the profit of my business.

[05:30] The other one dramatically decreased the profit of my business.

[05:33] In most cases, providing more value and charging a higher price in order to provide the

[05:38] higher value, will make you more money because you will service fewer people at higher

[05:42] prices.

[05:43] The first of trying to service more people at lower prices by also providing more things,

[05:50] most times will make you less money, especially in a service-based business.

[05:54] And so I tell this cautionary tale because it makes me sick to think about it.

[05:58] But hopefully it makes you sick to think about it.

[06:02] And if you're contemplating what should I do with my prices because I would like to increase

[06:07] my LTV, the LTV can be increased in six ways.

[06:11] And number one, you increase your price.

[06:14] Number two, you decrease your costs.

[06:17] And then number three, four, five, six are resells.

[06:22] Get people to buy more times, upsells.

[06:26] Get them to buy more of the stuff they are currently buying.

[06:29] Cross-cells get them to buy different things down sales.

[06:34] Get people who are not going to buy to buy something.

[06:36] All right.

[06:37] So this is your buying burgers once a week.

[06:40] And I want you to buy burgers twice a week.

[06:42] This is, you go from a small burger to a big burger.

[06:45] This is, would you like fries with your burger?

[06:48] This is, would you like a junior burger instead of your current burger so that you buy

[06:55] more or buy something instead of buying nothing.

[06:58] So these are the six ways that you increase LTV.

[07:02] You'll notice what I was trying to do was get more people to do this.

[07:08] I cut this and I lost.

[07:11] And so I tell the story to hopefully get more people to not make the terrible mistake

[07:15] that I did.

[07:16] And I have learned that painstakingly.

[07:18] And most times, I would say 99 times out of 100, when you lower the price, you make

[07:25] less money.

[07:28] Sometimes you make more, but the vast majority of the time you make less.

[07:31] So, and I'll tell you one final thing to illustrate this concept that I think everyone

[07:34] should understand.

[07:35] So let's say you've got a hundred dollar thing here.

[07:38] And let's say your profit is 40 bucks.

[07:41] If you decrease your price to 80 bucks, on this product, you would have to sell two times

[07:46] as many people at this lower price because you have half the profit.

[07:50] Let's say this is cost.

[07:52] Most times, if you make this kind of change, you're not going to two extra sales.

[07:57] But you will make half the money.

[08:00] So make sure that when you're making these changes, and here's the flip side.

[08:03] If you were to take this and go to $150, right?

[08:07] Now you're making, let's say we're now making $90.

[08:12] So we more than two extra profit, you probably won't sell half as many customers.

[08:18] You might just sell three quarters as many customers and make two times the money, which means

[08:23] more than what you're making now.

[08:25] Small tweaks, big changes, lots of impact.

[08:28] Think through these decisions.

[08:30] My name is Alex Shmozi, I'm an acquisition.com.

[08:32] We're going to perform a company of $85 million.

[08:35] In revenue, yearly, my goal is that for everybody in this channel, there's a lot of people

[08:38] who are broken.

[08:39] I don't want you to be one of them.

[00:00] You're having a tough time right now.

[00:01] I think that if we get this right,

[00:02] the location that you have will continue to grow even better.

[00:04] This is Oni.

[00:05] She runs a chain of eyelash lawns doing $2.3 million per year,

[00:09] but she's dealing with challenges with her business partners

[00:12] and she spread way too thin.

[00:14] And if she doesn't fix this fast,

[00:15] this business will just stall,

[00:16] they'll start falling apart.

[00:18] Hi, I'm Oni.

[00:20] Hi, I own Amy Lash and Beauty.

[00:21] We are in the business of empowering women

[00:23] with eyelash extension service.

[00:25] With a revenue of $2.3 million,

[00:27] $644,000 in a 20% net margin.

[00:31] We have seven locations

[00:33] been in business for over 10 years

[00:35] and helped over 20,000 clients.

[00:37] Amazing.

[00:37] What's the problem that you're dealing with right now?

[00:39] Help three problems.

[00:40] For us as lead generations,

[00:41] can we always need more clients?

[00:43] Second is making the service better.

[00:45] Manager training is inconsistent

[00:47] because the managers are spending most of the time

[00:49] doing lashes.

[00:50] New employees aren't getting trans quickly.

[00:52] Third is partner problems.

[00:54] Some partner have dropped responsibility

[00:56] since the initial equity agreement.

[00:58] And I don't take a salary for doing most of the work

[01:02] on marketing and scaling.

[01:04] What happens if you don't get these sold?

[01:05] The company is not going to grow.

[01:08] I'm doing unpaid work, so I feel unfair.

[01:11] I don't know how to have heart conversations

[01:13] with the partners as they're also my friends.

[01:15] All right, tell me more about the partnership situation.

[01:17] How three partners?

[01:19] Mm-hmm.

[01:20] Right now, they are just not allowing

[01:24] with my new goals and mission to grow the company.

[01:29] They kind of have their own thing.

[01:30] One partner has her full time career.

[01:33] Yeah, and a new baby.

[01:35] And new baby.

[01:36] They don't manage the lash artists.

[01:39] They don't train them.

[01:39] So they're the customer service and the fulfillment are not as good.

[01:44] Yeah, that's probably why.

[01:46] There is locations that don't have as many customers.

[01:49] Word of mouth.

[01:50] Yeah.

[01:50] We kind of have to fix these, you know, call it seven locations first.

[01:55] And I think if we nail the model, you'll sleep better at it.

[01:58] Definitely.

[01:59] Right.

[02:00] Okay, and so that 600-ish thousand that you have in profit

[02:03] is that before you split it between all the owners?

[02:06] Ah, yes.

[02:07] Okay.

[02:08] Got it.

[02:09] Yeah, you're having a tough time right now.

[02:12] It's a lot of people to manage.

[02:15] I feel like a little bit stuck because I'm having a disagreement

[02:18] on how to go to the business.

[02:19] I have a big division where I want to take the company, but my partners

[02:24] that will share the same reason.

[02:25] Who do you help?

[02:26] So I help 99% woman, mostly in their 20s to 50s, women who just value time saving

[02:32] or want to look good without needing a lot of makeup.

[02:35] Is there an income level that the associate with or does work in any market?

[02:39] The people who come back to continue the service would need a high income.

[02:44] But for someone who just want to find a event, it could be anyone.

[02:48] How do you help them?

[02:49] For a new client, how last time you go through consultations, make recommendations and apply

[02:55] the first set of lashes.

[02:56] If a client decided to want to continue with the service, they come back every two or four

[03:01] weeks for three fills.

[03:02] I want to double click there for a second.

[03:05] If they decide they want to come back, how does that work?

[03:09] They just come back in.

[03:11] Basically when they want to come back.

[03:13] Yes.

[03:14] No, that's not true.

[03:15] So this is a massive, untapped opportunity that so many businesses miss out on.

[03:19] And so there's two versions of this that you can do.

[03:21] Number one is something we call Bantham, which I'll talk about all the time.

[03:24] Which I got from Shorad Savatoz, which is book a meeting from a meeting.

[03:26] Bantham, that's what I stands for.

[03:27] So if you ever have the opportunity where someone comes in and they're going to have to come

[03:31] again, book it then, just get it done rather than trying to rely on them coming back

[03:34] by chance or remembering you or just even just creating the administrative burden of later

[03:38] having to schedule it when they're not writing front of you.

[03:41] The other way is just creating some sort of membership.

[03:43] Now those are a little bit harder to sell because people don't like having recurring

[03:46] billing.

[03:47] That's why Bantham is one of the easiest ways you can implement just about any business.

[03:49] But the recurring membership component, if we can structure the membership well with a really

[03:52] compelling offer, it might be something that's going to drive more and more people into

[03:55] it, which will stabilize the business.

[03:57] Okay, so how do you make money?

[03:58] Depending on the style of lashes, between 170 to 300, we do have an interpromotion

[04:04] for 99.

[04:05] When they come back between two to four weeks is 70 to 270, the longer they go in between

[04:10] fills the more cost.

[04:12] So let's say that someone comes in for $200 worth of lashes.

[04:16] What is it cost you in labor and what is it cost you in lashes?

[04:19] We pay out last $50 per cent.

[04:21] Really?

[04:22] Wow.

[04:23] Do they cover the cost of the lashes?

[04:25] No, we pay the cost of everything.

[04:28] Wow.

[04:29] Wow.

[04:30] Generous.

[04:31] So they get 50% of top line and then you deal with the cost of goods, marketing, rent, cleaning,

[04:40] everything else.

[04:41] Yep.

[04:42] That's impressive that you're running 28% margins with that.

[04:44] That means you're running everything else on 22%.

[04:47] Really?

[04:48] Our supply is cheap, that's why.

[04:50] Yeah, nobody may still 22% that's really impressive for literally giving 50% of

[04:54] top line away.

[04:55] Okay, is how do you get customers?

[04:56] 50% of clients come from Google.

[05:00] It's unclear what up this is organic SEO or pay ads.

[05:03] Although I do spend $1,000 a month on Google ads.

[05:07] Perlocation.

[05:08] No.

[05:09] To come back.

[05:10] Yes.

[05:11] So you're spending $200 a month for location.

[05:18] So on a spending $1,000 a month between six locations.

[05:21] So that's like $180 whatever the math is.

[05:25] Per month that she's spending.

[05:28] That's not a lot.

[05:29] Think about this.

[05:30] She's spending $12,000 on a $2.3 million business.

[05:33] So if she spent 1% of her revenue be 23,000.

[05:37] So she's spending a half per percent on marketing, which to me is either like this marketing

[05:41] isn't working or she's not spending nearly enough.

[05:43] And I think she's actually in the camp of not spending nearly enough.

[05:45] If she tells me anecdotally that half the people coming in say they're harder for from

[05:49] Google, I'm going to bet it's doing more than nothing.

[05:52] I'm of the camp of like man, she's probably on a gold mine right now.

[05:55] I'm probably cost to get a customer is almost nothing.

[05:57] And she's just spent way more to get more people in the dark.

[06:00] How many customers do you sell a month?

[06:02] On an average month, how total appointment is 1700s.

[06:05] Total guest cows 1100.

[06:07] 30% new clients 70 recolon clients 50% of clients stay longer than three months.

[06:13] Do you have the same prices during the weekend during like search times?

[06:16] Yes, some pricing for weekdays and weekends.

[06:20] When is it busiest?

[06:21] Usually Friday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday.

[06:23] Is there a time of day or is it just those days all the way for them?

[06:26] Just those days.

[06:27] So the oldest law in business is supply and demand.

[06:29] And the cross point is where you have price.

[06:31] And if there is more demand and less supply, like for certain times, certain days, then

[06:36] price typically can and should go up.

[06:39] And so she's running a business right now where she has some supply constraints that are

[06:43] temporal, meaning either time of day or day of week where she has constraints only on those

[06:48] days.

[06:49] And so on those days, it would be hoove us or be hoove on a to bump the prices up to

[06:53] reflect that shift in the supply demand of the business.

[06:57] Now if you're like, oh, but wouldn't it piss off our customers?

[06:59] Of course, everything is about how you frame things.

[07:01] Now wouldn't it be nicer if we said these are the prices on Thursday, Friday, Saturday.

[07:05] And the rest of the week, you get a discount.

[07:07] Right.

[07:08] And then I'll also drive more people to come the other days, which will then smooth out

[07:12] her demand curve and ultimately keep her staff better utilized during the week.

[07:17] And then by doing that, increase her availability on weekends, which would then drive more

[07:21] people to those times that she can fill back up, but again at a higher price.

[07:26] Genius.

[07:28] Brilliant.

[07:29] Well, let me ask you a big question.

[07:33] Did you say that you have more of a limitation on doing the work or getting customers

[07:39] getting new customers?

[07:40] Interesting.

[07:41] So you could take a hint a lot more volume.

[07:43] So it's more demand issue.

[07:45] Alright.

[07:46] Beyond that, why the rush?

[07:49] Is there's no rush?

[07:51] It's just that I don't see an improvement.

[07:54] Can I tell you why I ask?

[07:56] Yes.

[07:57] You have two or three different partners?

[07:59] And have?

[08:00] Why'd you take the partners a little?

[08:02] I did not have the manpower to manage, didn't have the money to hire like a manager.

[08:09] Then I'll ask the question why the rush of opening before you had the money and before

[08:14] you had the manpower.

[08:15] I just thought that we would make more money with another little fish.

[08:21] I agree with you.

[08:22] You probably already noticed that the next location is significantly harder than the first one.

[08:26] And the profit I'll bet you a big part of the profit is probably from your first.

[08:30] The ones that you have the most direction control over.

[08:32] So I thought when I opened more locations, I would make more money.

[08:37] But then I realized the manager are training the new employee as well.

[08:41] The fulfillment of the service is not as good.

[08:44] Some location are in due as well.

[08:47] So I've a lot of empathy for on me because I made the same mistake.

[08:51] And so I had six locations almost to the same thing I had multiple partners.

[08:54] I did this.

[08:55] I did this.

[08:56] The reality is that if I had just continued to cash flow, you know, the first location

[09:00] that I had rather than getting really aggressive with my expansion, I would have expanded

[09:05] better more profitably.

[09:07] And I probably would have had a stronger brand going into new markets.

[09:10] And so sometimes we have to go against our desire to do things fast, make it them easy,

[09:14] just make quick big bets on new people that are unvetted or untested.

[09:18] Whereas if she had been able to maintain control and maybe have three locations by the same

[09:22] for time period and she owns them all outright, she would be consistently

[09:26] stomping out these new locations because here's the really fun fact.

[09:31] The fastest way to five locations isn't the fastest way to 50 locations.

[09:36] You might go slower for your first one, two, three, four.

[09:40] But by doing it that way, you set up the infrastructure, the foundation to be able to then

[09:44] aggressively go from four to ten and then from ten to fifty.

[09:49] But you can't do that if you have all these hot podge deals on the side because let's

[09:53] think about this all the way at the natural extreme.

[09:55] Do we think the future version of the business is her with a hundred different partners?

[09:59] Probably not.

[10:01] And if that's not the future version of the business, why start doing that today?

[10:04] And the answer to that question is one word, rush.

[10:07] This is the perlocation numbers.

[10:10] You own number one and number four outright.

[10:13] Number one makes the most profit I'm guessing.

[10:16] Does that one run 28 or is it higher margins there?

[10:18] It's still route the same margin.

[10:20] Okay, so it's like 20, so we're okay.

[10:22] Cool.

[10:23] It makes like 250,000 years, something like that.

[10:26] Yeah.

[10:27] Okay.

[10:28] And then all of them kind of maintain the same margins or any of them not profitable or

[10:32] they all profitable.

[10:33] Very similar margin.

[10:34] Really?

[10:35] Yes.

[10:36] That's interesting.

[10:37] That's not common.

[10:38] That's a good thing.

[10:39] No.

[10:40] That's a that's a kudos to you.

[10:41] Talks me about the membership process.

[10:43] So we just started a membership is still working on it, not rolling out yet.

[10:47] So you've never really tried to have some sort of upsell offer.

[10:51] You do have an upsell when a client come in from a $99 set.

[10:55] I usually upsell them to 170, which is like a better set of lashes.

[10:59] Okay.

[11:00] What percentage do you upsell?

[11:02] I can upsell 90% of the time.

[11:04] What about the team?

[11:06] Probably do less up 50.

[11:08] They don't even ask.

[11:09] They don't even ask.

[11:10] I mean, that gets their good.

[11:11] You know, they have 50 is not bad.

[11:12] That's your style, Tara.

[11:13] Also, in terms of clothes rates, you have like 99% closer for people to walk in the door.

[11:18] I probably wouldn't.

[11:19] I don't even know if I would try.

[11:20] I mean, it's worth tracking to see if it falls off.

[11:22] But what I'd be more interested in seeing is the clothes rate on upsells.

[11:26] Because the $99 thing is not where you're going to, not where you make your money.

[11:29] So she's got a really big opportunity here where she's saying that, you know, they close

[11:34] 100% but it's basically pre-closed people who already checked out on a page.

[11:38] And so when someone walks in already having spent the money or knowing that they're going

[11:41] to spend the money, they already know the price they have to card down, those are like,

[11:45] in my opinion, just absolutely assumed clothes.

[11:47] It's like you're not going to mess those up.

[11:48] The real opportunity, though, is that these are essentially lead magnets.

[11:51] They're front-end promotional offers that are not designed to make money.

[11:55] The offer this designed to make money, the profit maximization component of it, is the upsells.

[11:59] If she's not getting a huge percentage of people to take the upsells, those are all the

[12:03] missed opportunities because think about like this.

[12:05] Let's say she breaks even functionally in terms of cost after payroll and taxes and materials

[12:10] and rent and labor and all that stuff on these promotional offers.

[12:14] Because if she only did promotional offers, she wouldn't have any profit in the business.

[12:17] So the real business is the upsell.

[12:20] And that's what we have to be focusing all of our attention on so that we can maximize that

[12:25] step one to step two, take great.

[12:27] What's the incentive for the girls to stay?

[12:29] The last artist?

[12:30] Because I'm assuming that you could lose that pretty easily.

[12:33] I'd offer training and to, you know, advanced techniques, but mostly other people aren't

[12:39] delivering it.

[12:40] Money?

[12:41] Yeah.

[12:42] So are do you lose them to other competitors?

[12:44] Or do you lose them more to them just going out on their own?

[12:47] That's one huge problem that I have is I don't know how to prevent them from taking

[12:52] our clients either.

[12:56] I have ideas.

[12:57] Ready to dive in?

[12:58] Yeah.

[12:59] Okay.

[13:00] Let's do it.

[13:01] So here's how we're going to do.

[13:02] Number one, we're going to talk about pricing.

[13:04] I think you have a little bit of an opportunity there that I'll walk through in terms of

[13:06] search pricing.

[13:07] Number two, membership.

[13:10] They're trying to put together.

[13:11] I have a lot of ideas on what we can do to make that better.

[13:14] The summary is going to be the upsell process.

[13:17] Next one is going to be career path for your team so that you can try and keep more of

[13:22] them.

[13:23] Ads.

[13:24] Plus attribution.

[13:25] How do we know we're getting what we're spending for?

[13:28] This is going to be a big one.

[13:30] Partnership.

[13:31] Man, it's hard to for me to even talk about the other five without going into this because

[13:38] I think that this is, like, this is the one that feels the heaviest to me right now.

[13:41] This is fundamentally, if we don't nail a partnership, then none of the executions

[13:45] can happen.

[13:46] That's what happened after I went back from the event.

[13:49] Like, hey, this is all the things we I want to do, but they're not really on board.

[13:53] Yeah.

[13:54] Okay.

[13:55] Check this out real quick.

[13:56] So this is the $100 million scaling roadmap.

[13:58] Lailin, I spent 200-ish hours going over all the companies that we've owned invested in

[14:02] scaled and tried to break down where were the points that we got stuck and then what

[14:06] do to break through?

[14:08] We broke it in these 10 stages and Annie is at stage six optimized.

[14:12] So let's look at some of the problems that she's dealing with.

[14:15] She has to run more ads than she currently is.

[14:17] So to graduate here, she's got to implement the ad assembly process to increase volume.

[14:20] If you're like, what's that?

[14:21] I have a whole video on it if you're at stage six.

[14:23] She has to install a product improvement process for both products.

[14:26] She's the second product here is the membership product, right?

[14:29] And so we need to put a process in place so that we can continue to improve it so we can

[14:31] decrease turning, get more people to take that up.

[14:34] Which also goes hand in hand with installing sales training systems and individual coaching

[14:38] and a team cadence to make sure that they're maximizing that upsell at step two when they

[14:41] come in for that promo offer.

[14:43] We need to get more people to take that upsell both in terms of just the immediate upsell

[14:46] but also the membership upsell.

[14:47] And the only way we're going to do that is through training.

[14:49] And I think Annie says this, she's like, you know, the team's not as trained as well as

[14:52] they should be.

[14:53] And if we're thinking about like, what layers this?

[14:54] She's got two layers of management.

[14:55] She has full team of managers.

[14:56] Every one of these locations says a manager.

[14:58] So these are the problems that she's dealing with right now.

[15:01] And for her long term, right?

[15:02] She almost shortcut the idea of getting good managers by just partnering.

[15:07] What was she really needed here?

[15:08] Like, what was the constraint?

[15:10] Was that the number and type of role she needed exceeded her current network.

[15:14] Right?

[15:15] And the thing is, is that she just used her current network to just pull people in.

[15:18] And that has become an issue.

[15:20] And so these are all problems that happen all the time at stage six.

[15:25] And so if you're like, man, I would love to know what stage of a assignment so that I can

[15:28] know what the constraints are and what I need to graduate.

[15:31] And so this is 100% free.

[15:33] You got acquisition.com for slash road map.

[15:35] You type in your business information and it'll figure out what stage you're at and give

[15:38] you the potential solutions that might help you get through that stage with your business.

[15:42] And if you'd like my team to actually work with you in person to make sure that this

[15:47] is stage rat and these are the things that can help debottle neck your growth, then on the

[15:51] thank you page, you can schedule call their team and we love to potentially see out here

[15:54] in Vegas.

[15:55] Well, then I don't normally do this, but let's talk about the partnership first.

[15:58] Let's resolve that.

[16:00] And then we could talk about all the downstream stuff.

[16:02] You have three sets of partners.

[16:03] If two that work full time and then one that you've done multiple partnerships with,

[16:07] which one do you want to tackle first?

[16:08] Okay.

[16:09] Yes.

[16:10] The reason I wanted to talk about her partnership structure is because all of these things

[16:14] that I'm going to go over are wonderful ideas and they're great things that she could

[16:18] do to potentially grow the business.

[16:20] But if she's using up 80% of her mental bandwidth on these partnerships, then she's

[16:25] never going to be able to execute any of this.

[16:27] I want to maximize the likelihood she succeeds and part of that is you can train the

[16:30] biggest time Dr. and she has, which is these partnerships that she hasn't visited yet,

[16:34] which is why one of my favorite quotes is everything you want in life is on the other

[16:37] side of a few hard conversations.

[16:38] My heart goes out to her with the partnership situation and I know that first hand having

[16:42] nine filled partnerships.

[16:44] All the big jumps in my career happened after I had tough partnership conversations.

[16:48] If she doesn't deal with this thing, it's just going to get bigger and nastier.

[16:51] And so you might as well deal with it now.

[16:54] And so this is me also talking to Oni and her potential partners.

[16:57] These trying resolve whatever concerns you have and set up clear expectations.

[17:01] Don't leave it in the gray.

[17:03] Don't leave something there.

[17:04] Because you don't want to confront the issue.

[17:06] Like whatever you say to your husband or you say to the people behind one another's back,

[17:10] just say to each other, get it out there.

[17:13] Be clear about what you want.

[17:14] And then ultimately, I think it's going to be better for all parties.

[17:17] I think that your initial inclination is right, which is that you have optional one is

[17:22] that there is a role that doesn't exist within the business, which is to do this level

[17:27] of work and so I'll tell you a story.

[17:28] So when I had my first partnership ever, I or second partnership ever, I had two people

[17:33] come into the business and so they were all one third partners.

[17:36] But I was the one who ran the gym, but I didn't get paid anymore than the other two

[17:39] partners you never set up.

[17:40] Not really, didn't step from the gym comparatively to the amount of hours I did.

[17:44] The big issue that I had was that I never asked for basically what I should have probably been

[17:48] paid, which would have been what a manager would have been paid.

[17:51] And so the actual business has artificially high profit margins because there's a role

[17:55] that I'm doing as owner, but I'm also doing the role of somebody who would be working

[17:59] the business because long term in order for it to really scale, you can't work in it.

[18:03] So you're basically running as manager probably from multiple locations right now.

[18:08] You're basically doing as an unpaid manager, which is not uncommon in the very beginning,

[18:11] but over time, as cash flow is there, you really want to have that role.

[18:14] So that later you can say, I'm going to hire someone, we're going to pay in the same

[18:17] amount that we paid me to take this role.

[18:20] And so it should be a rate that somebody else would be able to do the same work for.

[18:24] It's super important for honey or anybody who has a model that they intend to scale to pay

[18:30] what would be market rate for the role that they're fulfilling within the business.

[18:34] And the reason that's important is because if you want to open up more locations,

[18:37] you're going to have to leave that location, which means you're going to have to backfill

[18:41] your work skill set there.

[18:42] There's a couple of components to this.

[18:44] One is if you're doing like four different things at 25%, then that means there's something

[18:48] wrong with the model.

[18:48] We need to better organize the team and the role so that all of that work gets covered.

[18:52] And if somebody else is going to come in and do those, you know, four 25% roles, fine,

[18:56] but we need to make sure that that's factored into our return on capital in terms of how much

[19:00] it costs to open up an location versus how much we're going to make from it.

[19:03] And so let's say that we've got a location that's making 300,000 dollars in profit and it costs

[19:06] $50,000 or open.

[19:07] We'd be like, oh my god, let's open a ton of these.

[19:09] But we then find out that it costs us, you know, $200,000.

[19:13] For example, to pay somebody who's good enough to be able to execute the business model there.

[19:16] All of a sudden now we're making only 100,000 dollars in profit,

[19:19] per location, $50,000 invested.

[19:21] Now mind you, that might still be a good return, but we still have to factor all of those pieces in.

[19:25] Is this the real return or is this artificially inflated because people are acting as owners

[19:31] and just getting a profit share of it?

[19:33] And it's not really built into the overall economics of the model.

[19:36] And this is why we say nail it, then scale it.

[19:37] That's option one.

[19:39] The other option is if you decide that you don't think the partnerships win a workout long term,

[19:43] that I do think it makes sense for you to split the partnership.

[19:45] Now there's two paths there.

[19:47] So path one is that she buys you, the other paths is you buy her, right?

[19:51] Now I think the fairest way to approach it is to do something called a shotgun offer,

[19:55] which is like, I will buy you out for this, but I will also accept that for you to buy new you out.

[20:00] And so you can make it basically make the price and the term so it's like pay me over two years,

[20:03] pay me over three years to want to pay up front.

[20:05] But when that happens, you're going to be running this business and I'm going to be running my locations.

[20:10] I think that if we get this right, I think the location that you have will continue to grow even better.

[20:15] It's just a problem is what have they say no?

[20:19] Do the buying out part.

[20:21] Well, the thing is is that you have leverage, which is if you're the working partner,

[20:26] you can say well then I'm not going to work anymore.

[20:29] So there's leverage.

[20:30] And to be fair they have the equal opposite leverage, but if they already are not working,

[20:35] then there's less leverage.

[20:36] Being the person who works and brings it in, always gives you leverage.

[20:38] Oh, shit.

[20:39] The idea here though is that I think the fairest offer is I will buy you out of this,

[20:44] but I'll also accept that.

[20:45] But either way, I don't think this is going to work long term because we have different goals.

[20:48] And also because you have multiple locations together,

[20:51] you might be able to do just a straight equity swap.

[20:54] Which is like your 50, 50 here and 50, 50 here.

[20:57] Let me just take this one.

[20:58] You take that one and we just go our separate ways.

[21:00] And that's super smooth because then you really,

[21:02] it's an in-kind transaction.

[21:03] There's no taxes and you basically just swap equity for equity.

[21:06] I've actually done a deal like that.

[21:08] That might be the cleanest thing for you to do because it's a clean break.

[21:10] And now all of her focuses like I just have to make this one profitable.

[21:13] And then you just hit the other full one.

[21:16] And if you want to be really generous about it,

[21:17] you can settle it, you pick which one.

[21:18] Okay.

[21:19] If you want to be really generous with it.

[21:20] Yeah.

[21:21] How do you think you'll take that?

[21:23] I think it's a pretty reasonable offer.

[21:25] Yeah.

[21:25] Yeah. Well, like if you three different paths,

[21:27] I think the salary thing is going to be hard given what you said.

[21:29] It sounds like a clean break as the way to go.

[21:31] So either buy me out or let's just trade.

[21:34] So we have Path A.

[21:36] You do an increased profit share.

[21:39] Path B.

[21:40] Which is shotgun offer.

[21:42] Path C is we just consolidate.

[21:44] I take the other half of this one.

[21:45] You take the other half of that one.

[21:46] Which one do you think you'll offer?

[21:48] I've had the first one first.

[21:50] Really?

[21:50] They say no.

[21:51] Because I still want to have the relationships.

[21:54] I still want to run this business together if they onboard.

[21:57] How many years have you done this with them?

[22:00] Five.

[22:01] But it has been working.

[22:03] So before we just kind of...

[22:05] Be with friends.

[22:06] We would just let it be.

[22:08] Yeah.

[22:09] There's not a lot of growing the business.

[22:11] Right.

[22:12] It's just more like hiring and...

[22:14] You have different goals.

[22:14] Yes.

[22:15] Now it's like I want to make each customer be happy with the service.

[22:20] I want to improve our portfolio.

[22:23] You have higher goals than what you want to do.

[22:24] Which is nothing wrong with that.

[22:25] Just families, there's another career, whatever.

[22:29] Can I give you my designs?

[22:31] I think she did the equity swap.

[22:33] Thing is is that I think you'll be able to keep the relationship longer term.

[22:37] Basically, because if you have an ugly end of the partnership, which, you know,

[22:40] the profit here percentage, then there's like, well, now I feel like I'm getting pity

[22:42] in the less and you're really just doing what you're already doing.

[22:45] You're just being greedy.

[22:46] You know, there's the shotgun offer which then, you know, one of you is writing a

[22:49] tech to the other person for the next two years.

[22:50] And that kind of stings every month.

[22:52] Yeah.

[22:52] The equity swap is a very clean, clean way to end it.

[22:55] And it's just unique to the situation that you have because you both

[22:58] on multiple locations together.

[23:00] And so I think consolidating that is very clean.

[23:03] And then at that point, you can be 100% friends.

[23:06] And you can share all the secrets that are working, you know, with one another.

[23:09] But she can choose to do whatever she wants.

[23:11] With her location.

[23:12] Right. And that way, you can still talk business.

[23:14] You can still talk all the things normally do except the stakes are less.

[23:16] And if she doesn't want to do similar stuff at all.

[23:18] Yeah.

[23:19] That's my advice.

[23:21] Because I think that you want to run fashion someone else does.

[23:23] And that's very hard to keep long term.

[23:25] Yeah.

[23:27] That's what I would do for partnership.

[23:29] How does it work if let's say the, um, she picked the one that's the second

[23:36] location.

[23:36] Mm-hmm.

[23:38] It wouldn't be the same at the equity after the last revenue ones.

[23:42] Yeah.

[23:42] It depends how bad you want to get up.

[23:45] I'm sorry.

[23:45] I gave, yeah, I gave my, my best location to a partner so that I could split.

[23:50] You said earlier that you've about the same level of margin between the two locations.

[23:54] You've got two and three.

[23:55] It's like if you got three and you got two, that would be a, unquote, unfurdeal for you.

[24:00] Okay.

[24:01] It would be.

[24:02] But then you're not going to be restraining anymore.

[24:04] And you can go do all the things and you'll be in 550 or 600 or 700 in the next 12 months.

[24:08] Because you want to do more things.

[24:09] Yeah.

[24:09] So then fun.

[24:10] Okay.

[24:11] This is a small business.

[24:12] You can, you can very quickly change the numbers.

[24:14] That'll be the easy part.

[24:15] Okay.

[24:15] This is the hard part.

[24:16] Yeah.

[24:17] The rest of this is straightforward.

[24:18] Yep.

[24:19] So right with that's over.

[24:20] Yes.

[24:20] Okay.

[24:21] Let's talk pricing.

[24:22] I think that you should probably consider a plus 20% price raise on weekends.

[24:27] And that's because that's when demand's the highest.

[24:30] Right?

[24:30] If somebody wants off the hours, then they get off our prices.

[24:33] If they want peak hours, then they get peak prices.

[24:35] And so that'll smooth out the demand within the facility so that you can actually just get more

[24:38] utilization out of it.

[24:40] And over time what'll happen is that you'll smooth out the weekdays, but then you'll

[24:44] have to be the more people in the weekends.

[24:45] You'll just end up making more.

[24:46] And I think that'll have a big difference on your profitability.

[24:49] And so this is where I would experiment with having a weekend search price.

[24:52] Now, you are having people just come back whenever.

[24:55] At the end of every single appointment, we need to have a band fan, which is Book

[24:59] Meeting from a meeting.

[25:01] So when they finish with the lashes, they walk them to the front.

[25:04] And they say, cool, your lashes are going to be done in two weeks or three weeks.

[25:08] Let's just get that on the calendar now because I'm getting booked up pretty quick.

[25:11] Is there any reason you can't do that?

[25:13] We do have clients who look at their primary away.

[25:16] But not all of them.

[25:17] Not all.

[25:17] Right.

[25:18] But if we had all of them do, we would make more.

[25:20] For sure.

[25:20] Because even at basic level, if they're coming back every four weeks or every five weeks,

[25:25] and we just get them always to come back every three weeks,

[25:27] you double the amount of times they come back in the year.

[25:30] Yeah.

[25:31] That's a lot.

[25:32] So do you think your team can do that?

[25:34] Do we do we get them like in the center of two book, great book?

[25:37] You can.

[25:38] Or you can make it the job.

[25:39] So we do ask them and we don't ask the client.

[25:43] Every time?

[25:44] Yes, every time.

[25:45] Okay.

[25:46] Just some of them, they like all,

[25:48] all book later, busy.

[25:50] Yeah.

[25:50] We would do basic sales training around this because it is fundamentally a sale.

[25:54] And so if someone's like, hey, I'm not sure.

[25:56] It's like, well, totally.

[25:57] If you want, I'm here and you're here.

[25:58] Let's just pull up our calendars and that way we can just get it sorted right now.

[26:01] So you have to wear that later.

[26:02] So it's just like a couple of lines that you can overcome with somebody that,

[26:05] I mean, if you just train them like two things to save, someone says,

[26:09] I can't do it right now and maybe like, I don't have my card on me.

[26:12] You're like, don't worry, we have the card on file and if you want here, let me just pull it up.

[26:15] Does next Saturday work?

[26:17] Does this Saturday after that work?

[26:19] Now you might find that you have a better time booking the next deployment before you do the last just.

[26:25] Okay.

[26:26] Because I'm sure when they're at their last just suddenly like,

[26:28] want to get out the door, right?

[26:29] Yeah.

[26:30] But if you book it while they're doing it or before, it's like they're just sitting there.

[26:34] Yeah.

[26:34] So you've got how long does it take to your last just?

[26:36] Like an hour.

[26:37] Right.

[26:38] So if they're like, I don't have time to figure this out now.

[26:40] It's like, we have 60 minutes to just get one thing done, which is like,

[26:43] let's just book the next time you're at.

[26:45] Okay.

[26:46] Do you feel like that's more reasonable?

[26:47] Yeah, we can try before they get the last just done.

[26:50] Yeah. That's a good idea.

[26:51] I prefer to sell before because once someone has gotten the value,

[26:55] they want to leave.

[26:56] Mm-hmm.

[26:56] And so I want to do it before they've, you know, gotten the value.

[26:59] They're like, oh, man, I want to get the stud and just like, right?

[27:01] When this, these are going to run out of three weeks.

[27:03] Let's get the next one on the calendar.

[27:05] Okay.

[27:05] So bandfam will just say before before.

[27:08] Before sashed during.

[27:11] Getting a customer to come back and buy again is absolutely a sales conversation.

[27:16] Though it walks and talks like an administrative conversation, a scheduling conversation.

[27:21] But a lot of sales conversations look walk and talk like that,

[27:24] but they're not.

[27:25] And so we need to treat this conversation and outcome of getting them booked back in

[27:30] with the proper respect to deserves for the business.

[27:33] Because if all of a sudden we got 80 or 90% to rebook,

[27:36] it would dramatically change the outcome of the business.

[27:40] If that's the case, then we should put a lot of attention to this.

[27:43] And the nice thing is, this doesn't even seem that hard.

[27:45] Which are my favorite types of implementations.

[27:47] Not that hard, hugely impactful.

[27:49] Now, I do want to talk about the career path.

[27:51] Does everyone come in and start at 50%.

[27:54] No, so they start at 40.

[27:57] Not a 90% on the XT.

[27:58] The way that I like organizing something like this is,

[28:03] I'll draw it out for you.

[28:04] Let's say somebody could make eventually 55%.

[28:08] Okay.

[28:08] So say like 55%.

[28:10] And then we've got 50%.

[28:12] And then we've got 45%.

[28:15] And then we've got 40%.

[28:17] 35%.

[28:19] And then third.

[28:21] All right.

[28:21] Let's just say that that's hypothetically our

[28:23] little path here.

[28:24] All right.

[28:25] So they might start here and they're going to be junior,

[28:28] lash, you know, technician, whatever.

[28:32] Now we can, intermediarily, give them a bump.

[28:35] And I like to have this basically every three months.

[28:47] So this gives you almost a two year time horizon of improvements

[28:51] where you say, cool.

[28:52] I'm going to get you go from junior to lash tech.

[28:58] And then you get the raise and then you go senior lash tech.

[29:04] Attack.

[29:06] And then you get the raise and then you get what's another word for technician.

[29:11] Lash artist.

[29:12] Perfect.

[29:12] So it's like technician is the first three.

[29:14] So you go junior, normal senior.

[29:16] And then you go same thing junior artist.

[29:19] And then you go artist.

[29:23] And then you go senior artist.

[29:26] So that gives you six title changes and six different compensation changes.

[29:31] And you just do it every three months.

[29:33] And then when they hit there, there's three month or six month or nine month,

[29:37] what you can do is that with the increase of pay,

[29:40] you also unlock training.

[29:43] As you unlock these new things, we're going to give you another skill,

[29:47] which you can charge you to more money for.

[29:48] So it's just unlocks the earning,

[29:49] because not only do they get higher income.

[29:51] So basically when you give them the title,

[29:53] they're still at their old pay,

[29:54] but you give them another skill they can charge more for.

[29:56] Yeah.

[29:57] It's on my sense.

[29:58] Yeah.

[29:58] And so that way they're making more money at every level.

[30:01] One is they just literally get better economics.

[30:02] The others that they learn another skill that

[30:05] had different titles.

[30:06] Yeah, they're taking exactly.

[30:07] Okay.

[30:07] Do you feel like you break into like six pieces?

[30:09] The training?

[30:11] Yes.

[30:11] Mm-hmm.

[30:12] Cool.

[30:12] And then that gives you a career path that they can work into.

[30:15] So what we're talking about here is

[30:17] deconstrating a supply-based constraint,

[30:20] which is how she's going to get more good technicians

[30:22] in each of her locations.

[30:23] And this is a super common constraint.

[30:25] And so if you're a business owner and you're being limited

[30:27] to buy demand or buy your ability to deliver on the demand,

[30:30] okay, supply, we run workshops here at a headquarters here in Vegas.

[30:34] And if you like my team to just directly take a look at your business,

[30:38] then you could just schedule a call with my team.

[30:40] And as long as we understand the business,

[30:42] and we think we could help you out, we'll invite you out.

[30:44] So that's judging, you can click the link below this video.

[30:46] Otherwise, enjoy.

[30:48] What happened after two years?

[30:50] Good question.

[30:50] I like the idea that you had where you have the one girl who's 33%.

[30:54] I think you just gave too much.

[30:56] And I think that you gave ownership rather than a profit here.

[30:59] And so the way that I explain this is,

[31:02] and you can draw this for them, we're going to have them watch this.

[31:04] Right?

[31:05] Is that there's four things that you get with ownership?

[31:07] You've got risk?

[31:08] Which I don't know if they want that?

[31:10] There's control, which right now you're not giving up.

[31:13] You've got profit, and then you've got a sale.

[31:17] Like if you sold the whole business.

[31:19] Those are the four components of equity.

[31:21] Now, they don't probably want this.

[31:23] They're not going to get that.

[31:25] And so what you can do is just give them the profit from the facility,

[31:29] but not ownership precise.

[31:30] So it's like I'm just going to give you this profit share

[31:32] in the form of a bonus.

[31:33] And you can bonus them at every month.

[31:36] And so if we want to say, what's the, what's the end goal?

[31:39] What do you think will be enough for them to be like this is cool?

[31:42] Like this is it a hundred thousand year?

[31:43] Like what's the amount of money that they'd be like?

[31:45] That's a lot.

[31:47] I think so.

[31:47] Okay.

[31:48] So what we do is I've always back into what my on target earnings.

[31:52] It's called OT, but I want my on target earnings to be.

[31:54] So if there're going to be a true owner,

[31:57] then they're not, are they going to be doing lashes or no?

[31:59] Yes.

[32:00] Okay.

[32:01] I'll tell you where I'm going with this.

[32:02] Is that I want to create a path where they can get 20% of the profit of the facility.

[32:07] And so what you can do is say, cool, you're going to have the opportunity.

[32:10] Once you pass 24 months, once you pass two years,

[32:13] when I have my next locations that I'm opening up,

[32:16] I'll be able to place you in one of those new locations.

[32:18] And you can have one of your,

[32:21] offer all the money, you'll work.

[32:24] And you're going to get 10% your one and 20% your two.

[32:28] So that's four years.

[32:30] But you have to do this extra work.

[32:32] This is associated with that.

[32:34] Now the cool thing here is that it's not equity per se.

[32:37] So that if they're not doing a good job, you can see you know what?

[32:40] Maybe you should just be a full-time tech.

[32:41] This much money has to go to getting somebody to run this thing.

[32:44] And it's either going to be you or it's going to be somebody else.

[32:47] So I'd rather give it to you because I trust you and I know you.

[32:49] But this gives you a very long term career path for that.

[32:53] Okay.

[32:54] So it's like put your two years in.

[32:55] You're going to continue to make more.

[32:56] You'll be fully trained up so that eventually you can train other people,

[33:00] which then you can open the new locations.

[33:01] And hopefully by two years of every location,

[33:03] over enough cash flow, open another one.

[33:04] Okay.

[33:06] For this.

[33:07] I started them at 40 though.

[33:09] Okay.

[33:10] Should I start?

[33:10] I can't start a less.

[33:12] 40%.

[33:13] Percent.

[33:13] Yes.

[33:14] We can't start.

[33:14] I stretched the new ones.

[33:17] Okay.

[33:17] The new ones you can start lower.

[33:20] And when you're saying stretching out the time, you mean like.

[33:22] Instead of three months, can I do a B6 months?

[33:24] You could.

[33:25] I like having more frequent.

[33:26] More frequent bombs.

[33:27] I'd rather I'd rather you go 40, 42 and a half, 45, 47 and a half, 50 if you need to break up the

[33:33] thing.

[33:33] Cremence.

[33:33] Okay.

[33:34] That it's I like she liked the cadence a lot.

[33:36] I like the most.

[33:36] Because it's always it's it's right there.

[33:38] Six months sometimes it's too far away.

[33:40] Okay.

[33:40] Yes.

[33:41] So yeah, if you have to with the existing ones, you can go 40 to 15.

[33:44] Just break it into that's four chunks plus the four title changes that's eight chunks.

[33:48] Okay.

[33:49] That work okay.

[33:50] And you could do it every four months and that still gets to your two.

[33:52] Yes.

[33:53] Yes.

[33:54] Do you like this?

[33:55] Yes.

[33:56] Okay.

[33:57] And to be clear, you're saying I'm not going to give you a facility when you go to your.

[33:59] I'm going to see you qualify.

[34:00] Yeah.

[34:01] But you're going to compete against all the other girls right two years.

[34:03] She got to be the best one because I'm going to give you the best person.

[34:05] Yep.

[34:06] That way there's some competitive ones.

[34:07] Cool.

[34:08] Yeah.

[34:09] Okay.

[34:10] Great.

[34:11] Let's talk about the membership.

[34:14] What ideas you currently have for the membership that you want to sell in the

[34:17] back at?

[34:18] Right now we have a monthly membership.

[34:21] A six months and 12 months.

[34:24] Okay.

[34:25] Are they paying up front?

[34:26] Yes.

[34:27] Say pay up front for the whole six months.

[34:29] Yes.

[34:30] What?

[34:31] Not that.

[34:32] Not that.

[34:33] It's great.

[34:34] So for the monthly one, they're not.

[34:35] What do they pay for six?

[34:36] And what do they pay for 12?

[34:37] They pay for the whole six months.

[34:38] Okay.

[34:39] What do they pay for?

[34:40] Okay.

[34:41] So they pay for the whole six months.

[34:43] Okay.

[34:44] What's the discount?

[34:45] What do they pay for?

[34:46] What do they pay for?

[34:47] What do they pay for?

[34:48] What do they pay for?

[34:49] What do they pay for?

[34:50] What do they pay for?

[34:51] What do they pay for?

[34:52] What do they pay for?

[34:53] What do they pay for?

[34:54] What do they pay for?

[34:55] What do they pay for?

[34:56] What do they pay for?

[34:57] What do they pay for?

[34:58] What do they pay for?

[34:59] What do they pay for?

[35:00] What do they pay for?

[35:01] What do they pay for?

[35:02] What do they pay for?

[35:03] What do they pay for?

[35:04] What do they pay for?

[35:05] What do they pay for?

[35:06] Because your costs are so low.

[35:07] If we can make the value, whatever it is, more than 10% off, which you can do for less than

[35:13] 10% of the cost.

[35:14] Because I'll get you a bet that the actual cost of stuff is nothing, almost for the

[35:20] lashes.

[35:21] I'm guessing.

[35:22] Right.

[35:23] So what kind of free thing could you add in that would be valuable for them?

[35:28] Well, I already add then the free facials.

[35:31] Okay.

[35:32] Those.

[35:33] Okay.

[35:34] So they have facials.

[35:35] For the monthly one, the price don't change, but I do have a lot of benefits.

[35:39] So you give them facials for free when they come in.

[35:42] Okay.

[35:43] What else do you give them?

[35:44] Just discount products.

[35:45] Okay.

[35:46] Okay.

[35:47] Product discounts.

[35:48] Okay.

[35:49] We also increase our referral from $10 to 50 if they are a member.

[35:52] Okay.

[35:53] Okay.

[35:54] I like all that.

[35:55] And then just anniversary gifts and birthday gifts.

[36:00] Really good.

[36:02] Do you look at ourselves as good?

[36:04] Yeah.

[36:05] No, it's good.

[36:08] Anniversary.

[36:09] What value but don't you.

[36:11] It's easy to price.

[36:12] Yeah.

[36:13] No, I love it.

[36:14] So I want to understand what makes this membership that you want to roll out compelling.

[36:16] Because sometimes people just roll out memberships that are just discount based

[36:18] memberships and like not my favorite way to roll out a membership.

[36:22] I want to add some significant benefits.

[36:24] So it's like you want to take away bad stuff, which would be money and add good

[36:26] stuff, which would be value.

[36:27] I want to make it a dare I say dare I say and offer so good people would feel stupid

[36:33] saying no.

[36:36] And so what I'm going over here is what are the bonuses.

[36:38] And so if you're like, I love to know how to structure bonuses.

[36:41] The good news is I have an entire chapter on how to structure bonuses inside my office book

[36:45] on page 117.

[36:47] So how do you splinter stack what you have, pull out the different components, order

[36:51] them in such a way that they're the most compelling as possible to each avatar.

[36:57] And I will say this.

[36:58] I think people kind of sit on this continuum of like they have no bonuses or they offer

[37:02] like 100 bonuses.

[37:03] I think the magic is actually in the middle is you want to have each bonus in and of

[37:08] itself be worth the same value as the overall price.

[37:12] And so that someone could just say I would do it only for this.

[37:15] I would do it only for the free facials right now.

[37:17] Would they do it only for the bump and referral bonus probably not?

[37:20] Would they do it only for the discount?

[37:22] Maybe.

[37:23] But to me up to this point, the most compelling means you brought up was that they would

[37:27] get facials every time they come in, which I think is not a bad thing.

[37:31] Let's see if there's something else that we can put up.

[37:33] So one other thing that you could consider doing and I think this makes it kind of fun,

[37:36] it's up to you, is you could have a little sweet steak or every month they're entered

[37:41] into kind of a giveaway where they get something cool.

[37:44] And in that way when you select the winner, you can then advertise it kind of all over

[37:49] the place.

[37:50] And also if the person who if they were referred by somebody, the person referred them

[37:55] once too.

[37:56] So that'll give them a really strong incentive to refer as many people's possible because

[37:59] those get as many chances as possible when.

[38:02] And so I think you should be like, I'm thinking like something like $200 or $500 of, it has

[38:07] to be enough that they should be excited about it.

[38:09] So just like one last thing that like maybe, but like I think if you was like $500

[38:13] with whatever the full sweet deal is, you give it to one person a month, I think that's very

[38:18] exciting from marketing perspective, it's not a huge cost to the business.

[38:20] Yeah.

[38:21] Is that work?

[38:22] Yes.

[38:23] Okay.

[38:24] So how are we going to sell it?

[38:25] So someone comes online, they put their card down, they show up in person for the $99 promo,

[38:29] right?

[38:30] While they're there, we're going to try and book their next appointment before they even

[38:32] start or during the during the appointment, we're going to get them booked for the next

[38:35] one.

[38:36] Okay.

[38:37] Where are we going to do the upsell?

[38:38] For the service or the membership.

[38:40] Membership.

[38:41] Now I'm starting with the clients who are already coming.

[38:43] Okay.

[38:44] So they're recurring.

[38:45] Yes.

[38:46] Okay.

[38:47] And I say, why don't you try the memberships?

[38:49] You're paying the same amount, you're paying now every two weeks.

[38:52] It should be all the stuff.

[38:53] Yeah.

[38:54] But then now you get all this stuff.

[38:55] And then you also get a free space.

[38:57] Yeah.

[38:58] Just I up today.

[38:59] Yeah.

[39:00] I only ask like a handful of clients.

[39:02] Okay.

[39:03] And how many people say yes?

[39:05] Um, two out of.

[39:06] I love like five.

[39:08] Okay.

[39:09] It's not bad.

[39:10] The one thing that I would do is the officials right now, if they say yes.

[39:13] Mm-hmm.

[39:14] Okay.

[39:15] That's good.

[39:16] A media bonus is strong.

[39:17] I mean, we've just not bad.

[39:18] I would like to be like 70 though.

[39:20] I want to have more reps you just need.

[39:23] Yeah.

[39:24] I think just offer more.

[39:25] Yeah.

[39:26] Because basically, I think you have to get into the conversation.

[39:28] Kind of learn the flow of it.

[39:29] But I would imagine if you say, hey, um, do, did you want to get like some of these free

[39:34] things?

[39:35] And they'll probably say yes.

[39:36] And it's like, cool.

[39:37] It doesn't cost you any more.

[39:38] Mm-hmm.

[39:39] And then be like, oh, great.

[39:40] How do I do that?

[39:41] It's like, just not if the membership and the way that I'd start it is say, you've been here.

[39:48] Especially if you're upselling existing customers.

[39:50] You know, six times in last, you know, whatever, six spots.

[39:55] Yeah.

[39:56] Just look up the CRM.

[39:57] How many times have you been here?

[39:58] So like, hey, Charlie, you've been here, you know, six times in the last six months.

[40:02] Um, I realized that you haven't been getting any of this free stuff.

[40:05] Did you know that you were supposed to get that?

[40:07] And I'm like, I didn't know.

[40:08] It's like, yeah, all you have to do is just sign up as one of the members.

[40:11] You pay nothing more than you're currently paying.

[40:13] But you just get all of these things that you should already be getting because you've already.

[40:16] Because like, if we can frame it on the fact that they should have already been getting it,

[40:19] it's kind of like a default close rather than trying to get them to opt into something.

[40:23] I want the positioning to be like, you've already been paying for it and opted in for it.

[40:28] Now we just need to formalize it.

[40:30] I remember reading a study in a book called, I think it's like 50 scientific ways to get to yes.

[40:37] And one of the things they talked about in the book was that one country was able to get like 80% of people to opt in to be a organ donor.

[40:44] Whereas other countries average like 10% and the one thing that that country did is they had people opt out of being an organ donor rather than opt into it.

[40:52] And so to me that almost permanently changed how I sell upselling,

[40:57] which is how do I make the thing that I want someone to do appear like the default option as they have to opt out of it.

[41:04] And so the way that I'm trying to frame this upsell for honey is that, hey, you've already opted into this membership.

[41:10] You just haven't been getting the bonuses.

[41:12] So let's just like formalize you getting what you already should have been getting rather than do you want to do this new thing.

[41:18] So upsells in a true new sales scenario, you might be at 30-ish percent, 20 to 40 whatever.

[41:24] And that's the numbers that she's getting, which is fairly typical.

[41:27] But if we construct it so that it feels like a default close or an assumed close based on past behavior,

[41:33] we might overnight be at those 80-90% close rates, which is why I wanted to be.

[41:37] And we can get it to be like, oh, you should already have this.

[41:40] And the less pressure it is, the more likely they're like, yeah, okay, sign me up.

[41:44] How are you actually facilitating the transaction?

[41:47] We have the card on file, right?

[41:49] Yes.

[41:50] So do you say, hey, we can just use the card you have on file.

[41:53] Do you say that?

[41:55] No, because I haven't asked that many.

[41:58] Okay, well, I would have that as my actual final CCA.

[42:02] Is that way you can say, hey, if yes, I'll give you the very right face right now.

[42:06] And we'll get you booked for the next time you're out here.

[42:08] You'll also get a facial then too, and you get some of these other things.

[42:11] And we come to the front, card on file work, great.

[42:13] And then that way when they check out, boom, it's done.

[42:16] They're all I'm recurring, and they just sign the thing, and then they're in.

[42:19] Yeah.

[42:20] Seamless.

[42:21] One of them, they don't be booked.

[42:23] They don't be booked to be fair.

[42:24] The free book is an easier sale than the membership.

[42:27] We have to first be able to close the free booking.

[42:30] If someone's not going to come back again, they're definitely not mind of membership.

[42:33] Yeah.

[42:34] So we got up like, we put in the door, like get the small win,

[42:38] and then offer free stuff, and then go for the membership.

[42:41] Okay.

[42:42] Okay.

[42:43] Does that make sense though?

[42:44] Yes.

[42:45] Okay.

[42:46] Get it.

[42:47] So that's how I would pitch it for the existing people.

[42:49] Do I bother to sell those six and twelve months at all, or I'll leave people asked?

[42:54] So that's a different sale.

[42:56] So it's like, so the way it actually would work is that after to say yes to the

[43:00] the membership, you then say, would you want to save some money?

[43:03] Okay.

[43:04] And then you say cool, if you want to save some money, you can prepare it today.

[43:07] Would you prefer 12 or 6?

[43:09] Like you're getting into a sales business like this is how it works.

[43:11] The reason pre-payment for membership is so valuable is one, people who prepay

[43:15] turn at a significantly lower percentage.

[43:17] Number two, it pulls cash for for the business which allows you to grow more rapidly.

[43:21] If you want to pay people more aggressively and fundamentally cash today is always worth

[43:25] more than cash in the future.

[43:26] And I would say third and maybe more and more importantly, if they're pre paying for the

[43:30] year, it's unlikely they're going to go somewhere else.

[43:32] So you basically lock in the customer for all of the future business, rather than maybe

[43:36] they're only going to come four more times this year, and they're going to mix

[43:39] and match between you and two other places.

[43:41] I'm going to draw this up to the thing that's worthwhile.

[43:43] So first we ban family appointment, we have to get the next booking.

[43:47] Then we have our free offer.

[43:48] That's kind of the beat, right?

[43:50] We have our free offer.

[43:51] They say, yes, I want the free eyebrow, so we say cool.

[43:54] So we already know when you're coming back, so you might as well just sign up for the

[43:56] membership.

[43:57] Yes, so now we have our membership, yes, if they say, if we're already in on the

[44:00] membership just from one tip.

[44:01] This happens separately from when they check out.

[44:04] So this is at the station.

[44:06] When they go up to check out, then we say,

[44:09] I want to save someone.

[44:11] Save whatever $150.

[44:14] Now they're going to be looking at their bill, and it's almost a whole bill.

[44:18] So they're like, yeah, I want to save $150.

[44:21] It's like awesome.

[44:23] Pre-pay.

[44:24] The next 12.

[44:27] And if they're like, oh, I don't want to do that.

[44:29] Oh, if you want, we can just pre-pay the six.

[44:31] I want to do six.

[44:33] That way you can save them one.

[44:35] Yeah.

[44:36] But to make it really sexy is you say, oh, do you want to date it free?

[44:39] Because they're out to check out.

[44:40] They're right there.

[44:41] The cards don't fly out.

[44:42] They're about to leave.

[44:43] Like you want to date it free.

[44:44] Oh, cool.

[44:45] Just sign up for the next 12.

[44:46] Okay.

[44:47] We already have the next timing here.

[44:48] So you're good to go.

[44:49] Just check the box.

[44:50] Now that to be clear is going to be off what you're going to save for the next year.

[44:54] But we'll apply the first discount today.

[44:56] Feel like I wrote that.

[44:57] Is that too complicated?

[44:58] No, I have to get.

[44:59] Okay, but it's just.

[45:00] Bamboo.

[45:01] It's still wording.

[45:02] Yeah, yeah.

[45:03] This is training.

[45:04] I need the recording.

[45:05] Yeah.

[45:06] So I can learn it and then train other people.

[45:08] Yes.

[45:09] The training other people is hard part.

[45:10] Well, I'm just kind of the training right now.

[45:11] So if you're in a service business, you're in the recruiting hiring and training business

[45:15] for the most part.

[45:16] Because selling lashes to me is not super hard.

[45:19] Like beauty in general, it's not be difficult to sell because people just like go in

[45:23] and they look better.

[45:24] So it's a very easy sale compared to like a workout for a year and wake up early

[45:28] and stop eating the foods you love.

[45:30] Much harder sale.

[45:31] So the thing that will scale this brand is her ability to scale training to new people who come

[45:36] in the door.

[45:37] And the arbitrage of the business is being able to get someone in who has low scale, train

[45:41] them up on your system and then be able to charge a higher rate for what that skill commands

[45:45] in the marketplace.

[45:46] And so basically the arbitrage of I can train someone in a week and take them and pay

[45:50] them what I got them to say yes to on the way in.

[45:53] And then with the added training that I'm paying for, I can now make this spread

[45:58] on what the market now values this new skill out.

[46:01] And fundamentally that arbitrage is what exists in service businesses and how service businesses

[46:06] make money.

[46:07] So she's got to be able to teach other people how to do this.

[46:09] The way that you have to train this is that you have to basically have them come in

[46:13] 30 minutes early or whatever the gaps are during the day.

[46:16] And honestly like this is going to sound crazy.

[46:19] Every day for 30 minutes they roll play with each other.

[46:21] So if you have four girls there, it's two and two and one person's in the chair

[46:25] and they do the first part.

[46:26] Hey, so what's home new to come in and then you have to, well, I'm not sure.

[46:29] And then it's like, well, let's pull up your calendar.

[46:31] Like I'll tell you what days I have open.

[46:33] Yeah.

[46:34] If you want to do it with me.

[46:35] And they should be in service because they want to be the only.

[46:37] I think they only have to train the front desk.

[46:40] One guy one local.

[46:41] That's fine.

[46:42] Then it's even easier.

[46:43] So you just have to roll play with them.

[46:44] Don't just say here say these words, it's not going to work.

[46:46] It's just repetition over and over and over again.

[46:49] As soon as MS upset, say cool, say like this try again.

[46:52] Say like this try again.

[46:53] You did great.

[46:54] Do it five more times.

[46:55] Right.

[46:56] And we'll try for the top again.

[46:57] It's just a ton of repetition.

[46:58] Yeah.

[46:59] And then when somebody comes in,

[47:01] the probably say it the right way.

[47:03] Okay.

[47:04] Alright.

[47:05] So last piece is really just the adds and attribution.

[47:07] So this is actually very integrated into the brick and mortar.

[47:09] Okay.

[47:10] So when someone walks in, so this is during, right?

[47:14] This is after.

[47:18] Which is these ones.

[47:20] That's after.

[47:21] And then I know this is looks weird, but this is before.

[47:24] So when someone walks in the door, what we want is we want to immediately get their ID.

[47:29] So hey, do you have your ID on you?

[47:31] As soon as they walk in, that confirms the appointment.

[47:34] Then you say great.

[47:36] Do you have the card that you want to put down today for to pay for the thing?

[47:40] So they already have that card if I wanted book.

[47:43] Good.

[47:44] So we're just confirming it.

[47:45] Yeah.

[47:46] Now the next piece is great sign in.

[47:49] And on the sign in, we want to have the drop down of where they came from.

[47:54] That way we can have our attribution for the marketing.

[47:57] And the referral code if someone's getting, some sort of referral benefit.

[48:01] The longer you stay in business, the more you are compensated by the quality of your decisions,

[48:05] not how hard or how long you work.

[48:07] As you increase leverage in your career, you want to make better and better decisions.

[48:11] And one of the easiest ways to make better decisions is have good clean data.

[48:15] And so you can always just do post-it notes and duct tape in the beginning.

[48:19] And that's how a lot of people start.

[48:20] There's nothing wrong with that.

[48:21] At some point, you have to make bigger and bigger bets on where you're going to invest,

[48:25] where you're going to grow, how you're going to expand.

[48:28] And in order to make these irreversible bets, we need to collect the data so we don't

[48:32] bet the farm on something that's a loser.

[48:34] So that way when every single person walks in, it's like,

[48:36] great.

[48:37] You have an idea in you.

[48:38] Awesome.

[48:39] Cool.

[48:40] Is this the card you want to use for today?

[48:41] Just confirming because sometimes we want to change the card out.

[48:43] And you're like, awesome.

[48:44] Can you sign in right here?

[48:45] Where do you hear about us?

[48:46] Great.

[48:47] Did anyone send you?

[48:48] Cool.

[48:49] Let me know who.

[48:50] If not, then there you go.

[48:51] So then you got your referral tract.

[48:52] You got your ad attribution tract.

[48:54] You got the right cards on file and you have a confirmation.

[48:57] That is the reason I ask for ID first is because it's less intimidating.

[49:00] This is just like it's a checklist.

[49:02] And they just follow it for every single person who walks in the door.

[49:04] Yeah.

[49:05] Like the fact that you have this waiting area is the biggest advantage for most service

[49:09] businesses that are under utilized.

[49:11] It's because you can check off all things.

[49:12] You can get your reviews.

[49:13] You can get your next deployment done.

[49:15] You can get the card on the file.

[49:16] You can find out where they came from.

[49:17] You can all of this stuff done before they walk in to get their service.

[49:19] Yeah.

[49:20] That's the big stuff.

[49:21] But I think we have to do the partnership thing.

[49:25] I think that's the big deal.

[49:26] That's wonderful.

[49:27] What's holding me back?

[49:28] No, it is.

[49:29] Okay.

[49:30] So let's recap all this for you.

[49:32] Let's go easiest and fastest.

[49:34] So I use Ice as my little water cursor.

[49:37] Impact confidence ease.

[49:38] So how likely is it this is going to work?

[49:40] How easy is it?

[49:41] And how big of an impact is it going to make?

[49:43] So something that's really easy really fast and high impact you do this first.

[49:46] And some things are high impact like the partnerships.

[49:48] But it's going to be not easy.

[49:51] Okay.

[49:52] So ice is a really common investor framework.

[49:56] And it also maps pretty closely to the value equation, which is like what are the four elements of value?

[50:01] You have the dream outcome, which ice is the eye of impact.

[50:05] You have the perceived like a vitchie admit, which is the confident score.

[50:08] How likely is this to occur?

[50:09] And ice just says ease.

[50:10] But I split that into how fast and how much effort is there.

[50:14] So there's four variables in mind.

[50:15] If you want to use ice, you can use three, whatever.

[50:17] But the point is that we have to make these appraisals based on what

[50:20] expect to return to we have for the resources we plan to allocate into the business.

[50:24] What better are we going to make?

[50:26] And so zooming all the way out,

[50:28] I define strategy as prioritization and resources.

[50:30] There's a lot of things we could do to any business.

[50:33] But the idea is that we want to allocate our resources to the fewest things that are going to

[50:36] get us the highest probability of high returns.

[50:38] And so this is how we reorder these things that we went over so that she can get the most out of it.

[50:45] Number one is I do think we can pricing is just like easy profit that will make a huge difference for the business.

[50:53] All you have to do is just have two sets of you know,

[50:56] pamphlets or whatever that you have on the counter.

[50:58] And when it goes Thursday, then you have Thursday through Friday,

[51:00] and you have Thursday through Saturday.

[51:01] What are the regular clients get a noise?

[51:05] Up so that.

[51:07] Well, if you want to, I can grant further you in.

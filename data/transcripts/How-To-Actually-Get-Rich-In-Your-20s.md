[00:00] This is brutally honest advice for men to win in their 20s.

[00:03] I made my first million at 26, across 100 million in that worth at each 31,

[00:06] and this is my roadmap for things that I learned along the way.

[00:09] I'd like to normalize a six-day week, 12-hour per day,

[00:14] work week for men between 16 and 28,

[00:18] and despite all the self-worth boo-do that social media and society will tell you,

[00:23] you were valued based on your utility, and when you're young, you have none.

[00:28] But you have a lot of energy, and so trade that energy for experience points and become useful.

[00:34] The first rule of entrepreneurship, according to Alex, is use what you've got.

[00:38] And the reason I like that is because many people always don't start things because they don't have

[00:44] the capital, they don't have the connections, they don't have the whatever insert,

[00:48] insecurity, or projection of blame and power they want to put on.

[00:51] But the first rule is you use what you have, and so it's about resourcefulness,

[00:57] not resources. And so if you have energy, you use the resource you have, you use what you've got

[01:02] to trade, to develop experience, to develop proof that you can get good at a skill,

[01:07] and you only get good at a skill by not being good at a skill and repeating it,

[01:11] and then failing at each time and then making incremental improvements, which take many, many

[01:14] repetitions until you actually get good. And this may be a little controversial, but I'm not here

[01:19] to be nice to you. I'm trying to be kind, which might mean that it hurts a little bit.

[01:24] So let's make this practical. If you have less than $100,000 in savings and you would like to have

[01:30] $100,000 more in savings, these are the things that I would recommend doing. And that means that

[01:34] you have to check out your ego. Your ego is gone for this. All right, you don't care what other people

[01:38] think because they're not going to be there in 10 years. All right, because you have a whole new

[01:41] group of friends that are way fucking better and cooler. So one, stop eating out, discount, groceries,

[01:45] only. That's if you're super poor. If here's my caveat, if you know how to make money, you already

[01:51] have a base level of skills, then eating Chipotle and whatever, whatever you can, door dash it into

[01:57] that you can keep working. The moment I realized it could make $500 every 30 minutes by selling,

[02:02] I was like, oh, I'm never buying. I'm never cooking food or grocery shopping ever again. Anything that was

[02:07] less than $500 an hour was, was now immediately outsourced, right? But this advice is for people who

[02:14] are super broke. Okay, so if you don't have the skill set yet, add all and you're struggling to just

[02:20] get things going, then you need to be completely on the defensive so that you can have enough money

[02:25] so that you can start taking bets. Because the only way that you're going to get ahead is that you

[02:29] have to make bets. You got to make bets on education. You got to make bets on opportunities. You got

[02:33] to make bets on inventory. You got to make bets on software. You want to start a Shopify score. You

[02:37] want to start a school community. You want to start something. It's still going to cost some money.

[02:41] Right? You might have to buy a camera. You have to buy some software that helps you edit videos.

[02:44] Like, there's some expenses. All right, and so having a big stock pile allows you to be patient.

[02:50] The more money you have, the longer you out, you can think because you don't have to worry about tomorrow.

[02:55] You know that next month and the month after and the month after taking care of because even if you

[02:58] made no money, you've got enough. That's how you can start thinking long-term. People are like,

[03:02] think long-term thing long-term, but like, unless if you have payroll and you've got or you've got

[03:06] rent or you've got, you've got groceries to pay. You can't think long-term because you're in survival mode.

[03:10] And so I'm trying to get survival to be as low-shumanly possible for you so that you could get into

[03:16] thrive mode, but it's all relative. If you make 40 grand a month, the spend 40 grand a month,

[03:20] you're going to be in the same survival mode. But if you make 40 grand a month and spend four,

[03:23] you're going to have every month, you make 10 months worth of income. And so in two months,

[03:28] you've got, you've got 20 months saved up. You're good. And then you can get super aggressive

[03:32] that other 36 and start really betting to double down. All right, so here's the very broke

[03:39] five six things that you can do to immediately spend way less. One, stop eating out,

[03:44] discount groceries only. Two, stop buying new clothes, go to goodwill only. Three,

[03:49] only attend free friend events. All right, so think about what I just said. Think about all the

[03:53] events that friends will tell you to come to weddings, bachelor parties, birthdays, just nights out

[04:00] because it's the 30, 30, whatever. Only attend free friend events. And if they don't support your

[04:06] goals, they're not your friends. Think about that. If I said, hey, I've got this goal and I said,

[04:12] hey, there's this human being and he wants to get you to not have the goal. Would you try to

[04:14] come as a friend or an enemy? Think about it. Some of the people in your life that you call friends

[04:21] are actually your enemies. You just don't know it. Now, for take the rest of the time that you have

[04:28] to apply to jobs that make more than your current job, be pick up side hustle work,

[04:33] see learn skills that you can trade for a higher hourly rate than you currently do.

[04:38] When I say trade, I mean, you make more power than when you're current skills pay you. All right,

[04:44] and then five, find the hardest worker in the room when you enter that new job or that new place

[04:50] and then double their level of input. So if they're not going to 100 doors, you're not going to

[04:54] 200. They make a hundred dollars. You make 200 dollars, right? When I had Jacob, my young neighbor,

[04:59] I gave him this exact advice and he was expected to one his team, do a hundred dollars a day. He

[05:05] did between 300 and 400. And so guess what? He got better faster. And then once you follow all of

[05:10] those steps, this is what you need to do next. Wait 36 months. And this is what I mean by patient with

[05:16] your outputs, impatient with your inputs. And the crazy thing is that you can change your life

[05:23] in one decision. I can get drunk, drive and car, and change my life forever. Right? I can happen

[05:28] like that. But it could happen just like that the other way. It's just that the outcomes delayed.

[05:33] That's the only difference. You can change your life two day in this moment by making these decisions.

[05:38] And your life path will have veered. You will have change direction, your tree of life will move.

[05:44] It's just that it takes time for that new direction to bear fruit. Whereas you can poison the fruit

[05:49] in a second. You can kill a tree real fast. You just can't grow in real fast. But it doesn't mean that

[05:53] if a seed's planted in your watering it is not growing. It just takes a second to get above the surface.

[05:58] I think you can solve a lot of mill problems by getting in shape and making money. You'll still have

[06:03] problems. They'll just be smaller and you'll have more resources to handle them. So let's talk about

[06:08] the making money part first. Fundamentally, in order to make money you have to provide value to

[06:14] someone, either an employer or customers. But either way you have utility which you exchange for money.

[06:20] And so by making that a goal then it means that you're going to increase your own usefulness.

[06:26] And so somebody who is more useful, all of a sudden develops other ancillary skills around

[06:31] that utility that they can use in other parts of their lives. If you're good at sales,

[06:35] guess what you can do when you're talking to girls. You can use the same conversational skill set.

[06:40] If you're trying to negotiate a purchase for a car or a house or whatever. Those skills

[06:46] generalize, they transfer across domains. And so a lot of people think it's like, well, when would I

[06:51] ever be a salesperson or when would I ever be outbound? Like it doesn't matter. It's not about

[06:56] that thing. The thing is it's like real life skills actually do generalize. Like this isn't

[07:01] elementary school or middle school when you're learning calculus or algebra or whatever. And

[07:06] thinking like, what am I going to use this in real life? One, it is real life right now. Two,

[07:11] these skills do get used across domains of all of my friends who are sent to milleners and

[07:17] to a person. They started in what I would consider a high volume sales environment. So that's

[07:25] either doorknocking, cold calling, or some sort of in-person business where they had many, many,

[07:32] many conversations with strangers on a daily basis. And I think there's, and I'm talking not like

[07:37] a month or six months. I'm talking like three, five years or no new their name. They were just

[07:44] some faceless representative that stood there at the door saw people sold memberships, sold insurance,

[07:52] sold solar, sold whatever. And the thing is is like skill development happens through volume and

[07:58] feedback loops. So it's the number of repetitions you have times the amount of improvement between

[08:04] repetitions. Brute forcing the amount of volume definitely will help if you can give yourself feedback.

[08:08] I've seen people say, hey, I've actually made a hundred pieces of content now. This is like one

[08:12] percent of people because most people do nothing. But of the one percent of people who say, okay,

[08:17] I posted every day for a year. The thing is is they didn't do the most important part,

[08:21] which is you don't just like make a video on post it and just everyday like, I make a video

[08:25] posted, make a video posted. You have to look at what you did and what you could do better.

[08:29] Fundamentally, that is the cornerstone of feedback. And so you look at the top 10 videos you made

[08:34] over the last month and you say, okay, how do I do more of that and how do I do less of the bottom 10

[08:39] and you just pick one thing that you did well there and you try and do it in every video going forward.

[08:43] And that develops a checklist of things to do so that you develop a skill. And so speaking from

[08:48] my own experience, the first sales conversation I had first off I had zero sales training. No one

[08:53] was like, hey, this is the script, this is how you go over. They're like, hey, here's a new lady,

[08:59] go sign her up. And so I was like, okay, and I didn't even know this was a sale. I didn't know the

[09:05] term sales. I just, he said, go sign her up and I said, okay, and so I walked over and I,

[09:11] and she was like, hey, you know, I want to know more about the gym and I said, what do you want to know?

[09:17] And she was like, well, I mean, like, how much is it? And I was like, oh, it's,

[09:22] whatever, 150 bucks a month that she was like, okay, and I was like, you want to sign up?

[09:26] And she said, I left my credit card at home and I was like, okay, and she was like, I'll be back

[09:32] with the credit card and I was like, cool. And so I walked out and it was like two minutes,

[09:37] right? And I walked out and the owner Sam was there with a few of other other gym owners.

[09:42] She had about a few gym owners and so it was like three or four gym owners there. And he was like,

[09:46] damn, he was like, that was fast. And I was like, yeah, he's like, you closer and I was like, yeah,

[09:51] and he was like, with the credit card and I was like, oh, no, she's, she's going to go get it and

[09:56] she'll be back. And they just looked at each other and then looked back at me and then just started

[10:02] laughing at me. Uncontrollably, like, couldn't breathe at how dumb what I had just said was.

[10:07] And the thing is, is I had no experience. And I, and I tell that story because

[10:12] so many people assume that like I walked out of the womb closing deals. You know what I mean? Like,

[10:16] a nurse, what are you doing later? You know what I mean? Like, right? But it was like that, right?

[10:22] Like, I didn't know. I didn't even know the term. And so, you know, over time, I just started

[10:28] developing like, okay, well, what do you do? And I watched other people,

[10:31] I was like, okay, they start with asking them why someone's there. I asked them what about

[10:34] their goals, asking them things that they've done the past they didn't work. I said, okay, that

[10:38] that seems to work, okay. And then when they asked them to buy, then if they don't want to say,

[10:42] yes, they asked them more questions rather than just saying, okay. So I started developing

[10:46] at least an understanding of the framework of how sales occurred. But I still wasn't good,

[10:50] right? And so then I went through like that rocky cutscene period where this is where I'm very

[10:55] grateful for this is that Facebook ads is when I started running them in 2013 were super cheap.

[11:00] And so it actually gave me so many repetitions because not only was I taking 15 to 20

[11:07] consults a day in person, I was also working leads. And so I'm talking to strangers over the phone

[11:12] to set the appointments. And so all I got was just names on a list. And I would call them set the

[11:16] appointment like, who is this again? You know, all of that. And then, and by the way, if you are

[11:22] local, you just say the name pause with a question mark at the beginning. Like John,

[11:27] and then they'll be like, yeah, they're like, this is Alex. That pause. And they really like,

[11:31] they're like, they're like, who the fuck is Alex? I'd be like, from Facebook, you signed up for

[11:36] a bubble bubble bubble, our thing. Yeah, I'm just calling to make sure that you're not a crazy

[11:41] person from being in it and neither am I. I was like, we're actually on the corner of X and Y.

[11:45] I was like, right next to the 7-11. They're like, yeah, I'm like, okay, cool, why just want to

[11:49] see what time we want to come. Come by. I was like, we have the sweetest facility in the world,

[11:52] not really, but it's at least pretty decent for this area. But we have five out of five coolness.

[11:57] And they were just laughing. They were like, I can make it at six. And I'm like, six works.

[12:01] I was like, do you want to picture a mirror just at the address? And like, just the address. I'm like,

[12:05] all right, it sounds good. I'll text you and I'll see you later today. Right. So that kind of like,

[12:09] notice the like half giggles between each word. Like, it's showing that you're positive

[12:14] tone person high energy. Someone's like, man, this guy seems cool or this guy seems cool. Right.

[12:20] And so they're more likely to show up. They're more likely. Now, if I maintain that tone,

[12:24] if they give me an objection, I can pivot really easily. If I'm like neutral or like,

[12:29] hi, I saw that you signed up on the internet for our thing. Would you like to come in?

[12:33] They're like, well, tell me more about it. They're like, well, it's just, if you have no,

[12:36] you have no room for messing up. And so I always tried to have more rapport and bring a lot of energy.

[12:43] And the thing is, like, if you've seen any of my content, I'm not naturally like a high energy person.

[12:48] I will continue to work, which is different than being like up here. And so I developed a lot of things

[12:54] to try and keep myself energized. And so I had a small trampoline that I would bounce on

[13:00] before and between every sales appointment. Then it sounds ridiculous, but if you, I'm telling,

[13:06] it's like a hundred bucks. If you buy one of those little trampolines and you bounce either

[13:10] between sales calls or between people, like I'd have people coming in as I was still bouncing.

[13:15] And I'd be like, I know this is ridiculous. I was like, but try and be in a bad mood on a trampoline.

[13:19] You can't do it. You can't do it. You can't do it. I've challenged you too. You can be in a bad

[13:24] mood. If you tried jumping around, like you feel like such a child, it's ridiculous. But what

[13:27] would happen is like, I would really, I would also go a little bit exercise, my blood would keep

[13:30] moving, but it's also just like, mentally, um, literally bouncing. Give me a lot of energy for these

[13:37] appointments. And so I say this because I developed all of these things over time. And so if you're

[13:43] starting out, you're not going to be good. That's why you're new. You have no experience. But there's

[13:49] a difference between, there's a story that um, should I camera or what it is. But there's a foreign

[13:54] kid who had never seen a banana before. And so the adult gave the kid a banana and so the banana,

[14:03] so the kid took the banana and then bit right into it with the skin and everything. And

[14:08] another child was like, you're a session idiot. And then the adult yelled at that child and said,

[14:13] no, he just doesn't know any better. And there's a very big difference between being dumb and being

[14:19] inexperienced. Right now, you just don't have wraps. And so you're going to make a lot of mistakes,

[14:23] like biting into the banana, like at for just walking, letting someone walk away assuming it's a

[14:28] close and they say that they're just going to come back and call you with their credit card.

[14:31] Right by the way, that never happens. Um, very, really. But instead, uh, you want to just peel

[14:38] that banana, you want to bite into the banana, bite into the orange, all of those mistakes as quickly

[14:43] as possible and not judge yourself, formaking the mistake and see the mistake as part of the process

[14:48] of being like, that didn't work, that didn't work. And if I develop enough of these doesn't works,

[14:54] then you just kind of walk the, the mind field and you get to where you're trying to go and

[14:58] people are like, why are you so good at this? And you're like, oh, no, no, I actually just know all the

[15:01] things not to say in a sale. And then they end up buying. I just avoid all that. And then they buy.

[15:07] And to be clear, I think I have a similar piece of advice but for very different reasons of telling

[15:12] young men in general or men to work harder. And it's not because I think it's some sort of, you know,

[15:18] beating your chest, I'm on alpha, whatever thing. It's just that for me, the point of my life is to

[15:25] become the best version of me. And in order to do that, I need to learn because there's a huge

[15:28] discrepancy between where I am and where I want to go. And the discrepancy is going to get filled with

[15:33] skills, which means that I need to do repetitions to acquire failures that I can learn from to get

[15:41] better from. And if I can do more of that in a shorter period of time, I will learn more skills

[15:47] and by definition, I will shrink the distance between myself and my ideal self. And so that is

[15:54] pretty much the only thought process I have around this. And I also believe that you need to be

[16:01] patient with outputs and impatient with inputs. So only unpack that. Patience in general is

[16:09] figuring out what to do in the meantime. So when someone says, hey, be patient with what they just

[16:12] mean is, figure out something else to do in the meantime. And so if I'm telling you to be patient with

[16:16] outputs, it means that you basically just have to figure out something else to do in the meantime,

[16:21] while you wait for outputs to occur. Because you can't output, you can't, money doesn't appear,

[16:25] you have to do something and then money happens. But the doing something part is the thing that

[16:30] you can control. The money happening is the part that you don't control that comes afterwards.

[16:34] It's an outcome. And so when I say patient without puts, that's the first part. The second part

[16:41] is impatient with inputs. And so if being patient is figuring out to do in the meantime,

[16:46] impatient is doing the thing in the meantime. And so it's the opposite of that. It's the thing you

[16:52] do in the meantime. And so if you want to be impatient with the input, the input is the thing.

[16:56] That's the action you do. And so by delineating that, if you hear yourself thinking, man, why

[17:02] has in this happened yet, you're talking about outputs. And that means great. If I think that thought,

[17:07] I need to do more of this input. And so use your input, your action, your doingness, the thing you

[17:15] use your hands for as your coping mechanism for your impatience without puts. I want to say that one

[17:24] more time. Whenever you have that feeling that thing should be happening faster,

[17:28] use action as your coping mechanism. I used to write this down a lot and say it, which was action

[17:36] alleviates anxiety. And so when I would have this anxiety about the future of like, why haven't I made

[17:42] it yet? Why are these other people doing better than me? Like, is this not going to work? What if

[17:47] I'm on the wrong path? Action alleviates anxiety? The only thing I can control with that I was,

[17:52] is that I would work, is that I would get better. And the key point there was that it wasn't just

[17:55] working for WorkSake. It was working with the intention to improve. And so you want to do repetitions

[18:01] because by doing things more times you get better at them, typically just by accident. But if you were

[18:07] deliberate about the point of doing this, when I started working at a gym going from a white

[18:12] collar job, it wasn't because I want to become a trainer for the rest of my life, it was because

[18:16] I wanted to learn the skills. And then I knew that once I learned those skills by own to gym,

[18:22] then I would know how to do the training part as well and that would be good for me. And so

[18:26] then when I was a gym owner and when I started and started working at a gym, I wanted to own

[18:30] a big chain of gyms. That was my whole goal to start with. I wasn't getting into this for one.

[18:34] Like I never had the goal of only owning just one gym. And so even when I started that gym,

[18:39] the whole point and I worked all the time, because I thought of all the things that I didn't know

[18:42] how to do yet. And so it wasn't about great, I've made it. I owned a gym. It was like I'm so

[18:47] deprived of where I want to be. I have to fill this gap as fast as I possibly can. And so that's why

[18:53] I spent so much time on this and got me back from as many human beings as I possibly could who

[18:59] were ahead of me. So I want to say this clearly. Once I started my gym, one, I paid for a mastermind

[19:06] for gym owners before owning a gym. And I did that because I figured, well, why would I start a

[19:11] gym until I learn all the stuff that you guys did wrong? I was like, I'll just learn from all

[19:14] y'all's mistakes. It sounds like a great deal for me. And I almost felt unfair. I was like, yeah,

[19:20] okay, he said don't start at one of those locations. He said have good storefront. He said make sure

[19:23] that you have good parkingos. Ooh, he's a good, you know, good things. He was like, don't go too big.

[19:28] I was like, okay, that's good. And they're like, make sure you're rents under this per foot. I was like,

[19:31] all right, make sure I got that. Right. And so I took all these notes and that I would have just

[19:34] made huge mistakes on the upfront. Now, once I did start my gym, what a lot of people don't know

[19:39] is that every weekend, I would either be on phone calls or I'd be driving out to other gym owners.

[19:45] And I would, and thankfully, because I was so young when I started my business, they were just like,

[19:49] they felt bad for me. And so they would just sit there and I'd be like, hey, why do you do that?

[19:54] Hey, why do you do that? Hey, why do you do that? And it was like, you know, they'd be like,

[19:58] God, just such a pain in the ass. But I just wanted to learn, right? But I was always like willing to

[20:02] help them with anything they had. You know what I mean? I was like, let me show you the stuff that's

[20:05] working well for me. And I would always just share it. And the thing is, is I would go there and they

[20:09] would say they did something and I'd be like, oh, that's weird. That's different than the other

[20:12] guy. And I like that way better. It didn't mean I'd take everything as, as fact, but I got a lot of

[20:17] ideas from that. And then I would use them. And if they didn't work, I would just toss them out. And if they

[20:21] did, I kept it. And that's how I quickly iterated the gym model to become much better than a lot of

[20:26] people's models, despite me being younger. Because I was able to leverage everyone else's experience

[20:32] as fast as I could and gym it into my own. And so I think like the people who move faster than

[20:37] life learn faster. And the only way you learn is by changing your behavior with the same conditions,

[20:43] which means that if a person walks in, I say, this is my six point script. A person who's identical

[20:49] walks in right afterwards, if I've learned something, that script changes. I mean same condition,

[20:54] new behavior. And so if you keep doing the exact same thing every single day, then you may not be

[21:00] learning. And it's a key point. It's good to work hard. But it's good to work hard and smart,

[21:05] which means that the work you do gets better because you tweak things. And so if you're not

[21:09] documenting the process that you have and I'm not saying you're making content about it,

[21:13] but literally looking back at game footage, looking at the calls you did, looking at the content

[21:17] you did. I do this two day. People ask me like, what are the masterminds you're into? What are the

[21:21] courses you learn from? I have now broken apart the learning process that I have that works best

[21:27] for me because I see the biggest gains in improvement haven't come from advice for me for the most

[21:32] part. They came from looking at data, which was, let me look at the last two thousand ads I made.

[21:37] Let me look at the top 50. Let me look at what these ones have in common. Let me look at what they

[21:42] don't look like compared to the bottom 50. Okay, these ones have these characters, six these don't.

[21:46] I'll do more of this unless of that. And then I do another hundred ads and I look at the top 10 again.

[21:50] I say what do these ones have that these one so on? And I do that for sales calls. I do that for content.

[21:54] I do that for meetings. I do that for businesses in general when you start zooming out.

[22:00] And so that process of do a lot of volume. Then look at the outcomes that were good.

[22:06] Look at the activities that led to those outcomes that are positive. Do more of those activities.

[22:12] Look at the bottom percentages. Look at the things that led to not having that happen and do

[22:16] less of those. And if you're younger than this is specific for everyone who's listening to this video.

[22:21] If you're probably sub 30, sub 28, maybe, right? If you're in your 20s or less,

[22:27] you can probably get away with this, which is that people ahead of you are

[22:31] more willing, believe it or not, to feel like they have status. So you can give them status by saying,

[22:38] be a mentor. And the thing is a lot of young guys have a lot of ego, because you're trying to prove

[22:42] yourself trying to be a man, whatever. The thing is is that if you humble yourself,

[22:47] it's not like there's some fucking massive scoreboard where it's like who humbled themselves to whom

[22:52] across the whole U.S. It doesn't, it's not that exists. It's just just when they're one dynamic.

[22:56] Right? And so if you go and say, hey, I don't know anything. I'm happy to learn.

[23:01] If you do that, then a lot of people are like, oh, well, he humbled himself. Well, yeah,

[23:04] I'm happy to teach you. And the thing is, it's still give you advice. It's worth thousands of

[23:07] dollars, years of your life. For free, if you just say, you're better than I am at this. But the thing

[23:13] is is that the end of the day, none of the matters, but scoreboard would be the thing that matters in

[23:19] business, right? And so the only thing that precedes the scoreboard is your learning. I've spent

[23:25] ego points. I've spent dollars. I've spent time. I've spent social capital. I spent every resource

[23:33] that I had to get more learning faster because fundamentally the only thing, and I think this is

[23:39] probably one of the biggest gifts my father gave me, is believing that I am the asset. I am investing

[23:45] it. And the cool thing is, is that you are the permanent hold, right? You can't sell you. Like,

[23:51] you're, you until you die. And so this is the one asset you've got because you compound skills compound.

[23:58] And you get really good sales and really get a finance guess what? You can raise a billion dollars.

[24:01] Because you know how the finance world works and you know how the sales world works. Right?

[24:05] If you know how to code and market, then guess what? You can build software and sell it to

[24:10] gazillions of people because you have the product and the acquisition. Like, skills stack disproportionately.

[24:15] If you only know one, you might not be able to make a tenth as much as if you know two.

[24:20] Now, obviously, there's a big bucket of terms that have many, many, many skills underneath of them.

[24:23] But fundamentally, when you think about it that way, you become a weapon. So let's talk to the second

[24:27] part. I said, you can solve a lot of male problems by getting in shape and making money. And so,

[24:32] let's talk about the getting in shape side. So you can avoid tons of problems in life by doing one thing,

[24:40] going to bed on time. And so instead of setting alarms to wake up, settle alarms to go to sleep on time.

[24:46] It's hard to wake up late when you go to bed at night. Right? And so the thing is, is that that one

[24:51] simple behavior actually can eliminate a lot of the things that derail men, especially young men.

[24:57] And so Charlie Munger talks about this a lot, which is like, all I'd want to do is find out where I'm

[25:01] going to die and never go there. The whole point is he thought so much more about avoiding

[25:07] stupidity than trying to be intelligent. It's kind of like, the stupidities are very easy to identify,

[25:11] the intelligence is hard. But if you avoid all stupidity, you just become intelligent by default.

[25:17] And so if you define intelligence the way I do, which is rate of learning, so how quickly you pick things up,

[25:22] that is intelligence. If you can avoid all of these things that make you look like an idiot,

[25:29] then you become more intelligent. So let's talk about this from the getting in shape perspective.

[25:34] Show me a situation where you have two groups of men, one group of men that is really out of shape and

[25:40] fat. And another group of men that's really in shape that are going to outperform one another.

[25:46] And this is generalize. You have to take random sampling of the population,

[25:49] bunch of in shape guys a bunch of overweight guys, who is going to do better at any task over and over again.

[25:54] If we pick 10 tasks that are completely different, the in shape guys are going to do better than the

[25:58] out of shape guys. Period, they're going to have more energy. They're going to be more focused. If it's

[26:02] anything in a related like in a relationship, like those guys are going to close higher percentages.

[26:06] If you're better looking, you will close more. If you're better looking, you get paid more.

[26:11] If you're better looking, you get more promoted. If you're better looking, you do better in content.

[26:17] Period, fight me. And so the thing is is like if you have this one thing that affects every way

[26:23] that people see you and the only thing you have to do is control what you put into your mouth.

[26:28] Then don't you think it's worth developing that most basic skill of discipline at this point in

[26:34] life? Because the thing is is that you want to get in shape young. Because if you're not in shape,

[26:39] guess who's fault that is? So get in shape now. Thing is is it cost time not money. And

[26:47] right now you've got time and not money. And time only becomes more expensive as you age. So buy it

[26:55] now while time cost you the least and you have the fewest responsibilities. It'll help you no matter

[27:01] what life path you choose. The thing that no one recognizes is that drinking cost you two days.

[27:06] The day you drink and the day you recover. And sometimes the weeks afterwards for the stupid thing you did

[27:10] while you were drunk that everyone else saw. It reminds me of this quote from Mohamed Ali and I asked my team

[27:16] to pull it up because I think it's so good also because you use the greatest fall time and just to cool

[27:19] dude. What's the central part of your training? Is it running? Is it sparring? It's a

[27:25] important. It's a dodge in the night clubs and the parties and the girls. You want them true? And

[27:33] being in the bed by yourself not in a pocket night. If you can get by that as you'll make it.

[27:42] That's the truth. I think the truth. You tell all that running and hitting the bag and jotting and

[27:47] biting when you want to throw a dodge in the ladies is the main thing. Especially when you're pretty

[27:52] like me. And I'll speak to myself personally when I had my intense periods of work I would take off

[28:00] for a long, long time. So the longest time I took off was two years while I was scaling gym

[28:05] lunch from you know the twenty months we went from zero to four and a half million a month.

[28:09] Four point four to be technical. I didn't drink that whole period. And once things settled out

[28:13] as I got out I'm willing to drink again. And right now Aquister's not coming to scaling like crazy.

[28:19] And so Lail and I both said let's just stop drinking for the foreseeable. Then same thing now. So

[28:24] that was when I was in my 20s this is now in my 30s and I'll probably continue this until

[28:29] I feel like I'm at a place where things feel chill again and then like maybe I'll all partake

[28:33] again. But the thing is is like if you are hungry, argue me the opposite which is me drinking more

[28:39] will make it more likely for me to hit my goals. I think you'd have a tough time making that argument.

[28:43] And so right now everything's compounding is amplified. Right? The stuff you do now

[28:47] amplifies throughout your career and your life. And so I would want to stack as many advantages

[28:54] I can to my favorite which is like I'm going to go to sleep on time. I'm going to not drink.

[29:00] Right? I'm going to get in shape. Right? I'm going to do as many repetitions I can. I'm going

[29:04] to humble myself with people who are more experienced than I am. Even if I think I'm smart

[29:08] isn't there. They still know more and there's a big difference in this what I think is really

[29:13] tough for younger guys. Is that your brain at 25 to 25 is 25 to 30 is like peak processing power.

[29:22] But I'm way fucking smarter now than I was that because I've still learned more.

[29:28] And that's the thing is is that you may be smarter than someone in sheer processing power,

[29:32] but they still might know more than you. And so you can't live their life and especially if

[29:37] somebody is further ahead than they still means that they have knowledge that you don't. And so

[29:44] list and humbling yourself to somebody even if you think you are smarter will teach you more

[29:50] because again, argue the opposite. I will learn nothing from no one. How does that help you?

[29:56] It helps you for your ego feel good, but at some point you're ego's going to have to rectify

[30:01] it's good feeling with reality which is that your broke a shit and no one cares. And so I would

[30:06] rather humble myself rather than have the world humble me. This is a Bible quote that I just really

[30:11] like a lot of math you 23, 12. He said those who are humble will be exalted and whoever he

[30:15] exalts himself will be humbled. That actually told that to one of our our team the other day

[30:20] because I thought like as you go is getting a little bit bigger than it probably should have been.

[30:23] And I said listen man, I was like if you want to get humbled keep doing what you're doing.

[30:27] I was like but if you want people to talk you up, I was like humble yourself let your work work

[30:32] for you and then everyone else will exalt you. And so I think most men want to be respected.

[30:38] They don't have respect and so they compensate by exulting themselves because it makes them feel

[30:42] better in the short term, but you look like an idiot in a long term. And think about it like this like

[30:46] for some reason I don't know why we're wired this way but we say nice things about ourselves and

[30:50] we feel good but everyone else feels bad. Right? If everyone else says nice things about you it doesn't

[30:56] make them feel bad to say but it makes you feel good. Think about those people in your life who

[30:59] always like talk themselves up. It's like what do you see? You're like this guy's so insecure.

[31:04] It's obvious. And you look that way. You don't feel that way but you look that way and some of the

[31:09] things that you develop as you get older is the separation between how you look and how I feel.

[31:13] Which is like oh even though this feels good I look dumb doing this. Your feelings can lie to you

[31:19] in terms of how well this behavior is serving you with your goals in the long term. And what we're

[31:25] talking about your friends exulting you and your friends saying you're cool how much do their opinions

[31:30] of you really matter? Because now this is going to take a completely different direction than you expected.

[31:34] Which is you being humble is a description that other people would give to you. But it relies on

[31:40] you caring a lot about the thing which is a double edged sword and the younger you are actually

[31:44] at all points it hurts you. It's kind of like the stock market. One person, two person, one day or two

[31:50] days in the stock market it's just about sentiment. But how big the stock goes over a decade is about

[31:56] how good the intrinsic stock is. And so if a few people say you're an asshole no big deal.

[32:02] If everyone says you're an asshole probably a problem. Right? And so it's understanding the new

[32:06] wants between that. But your friend group has a disproportionate sway over your behavior.

[32:11] And so your reference group is one of the number one correlations with how big your life gets or rather

[32:19] the goals you achieve. Now they've done this studies in terms of finance because these

[32:22] you quantify. But your reference here is the five of who you compare yourself to. Now necessarily

[32:27] spend the most time with but compare yourself to are the ones that determine your future. And so

[32:35] sometimes you have to like your goals more than you like your friends. And every person who wants

[32:41] to do something in their life or has done something with their lives is going through the exact

[32:46] same chapter that you're going through right now. And it's the lonely chapter. It's the chapter

[32:51] where you don't fit in with your old friends. But you don't have the achievements yet to fit in with

[32:55] a new group of friends. And you're doing all the stuff, right? The fruit tutorials you're watching

[32:59] these videos and you're reading everything you can get your hands on. And you're trying to set up

[33:03] whatever your podcast is, your content thing, right? And you're going through it and you're

[33:07] thinking yourself like, is this even worth it? Because you're not seeing any signs of success. But the

[33:11] sign of success is the hate that you get along the way. It is the leading indicator. And what you can't

[33:16] do is bend the knee to their hate and try and fit back in and conform because it's comfortable

[33:22] in its warm. It's like the scene in the matrix when Trinity opens the door the very beginning in the

[33:27] first matrix. When Neo's about to take the red pill and he wants to get out of the car and

[33:32] Trinity says, you've been known that road Neo. You know that road and you know exactly where it

[33:37] ends. And I know that's not where you want to be. And then he closes the door and he gets back in

[33:43] and he goes, they go to go take the red pill. So right now, this moment that you're going through

[33:48] is Trinity opening the door and saying, you could go back, you could go party, you could go the night

[33:53] clubs. You could say that this was just a hobby. You could downplay what you're doing. Like,

[33:57] I'm just trying it out. Oh, yeah, I'm not, I'm not really that into it. It's just like just

[34:00] something I found, right? But then as you're saying, you feel like a fake because you're lying to

[34:06] yourself, you're lying to them about what you, what your real intentions are. And in that moment,

[34:11] when you're trying to think about having that conversation, you'll remember exactly why you left,

[34:15] why it is that road and you know exactly where it ends and that's not where you want to be.

[34:19] And the thing is, is that your goals will stick with you longer than these relationships. Your goals

[34:27] will serve you more than these relationships. And this is what, this is the stuff that no one will tell

[34:31] you. I can tell you personally, I don't talk to, I talk to one friend that I have from middle school

[34:37] and high school, right? I talk to one person, two people from college. And it's not like we talk

[34:45] all the time. I talk to him every six months or so. And so I say this because although these relationships

[34:51] feel like they're incredibly important in your life right now, they will disappear. The majority

[34:56] of these friendships are based on convenience. You're only friends with them because they lived in

[34:59] your dorm. They lived in your neighborhood. They went into the English class with you. But as soon

[35:03] as your conditions change, you change where you're at. All many of them will fade away because you'll

[35:09] develop new skills. You'll develop new contexts. You'll meet new people who are upskilled from them.

[35:15] And then you'll compare them to these people. And you'll be like, man, these are better friends.

[35:19] These are people who are more aligned with my goals. They're trying to grow. When I want to work

[35:22] all day Saturday, they're like, cool, I'll work with you. Rather than be like, dude, we're

[35:26] going on a pontoon boat. Like, where are you going to be? And you have to accept that as the price.

[35:32] And the thing is, it's like, it's only if you want that. Like, if you want to live a life

[35:38] that is the same as everyone else's, then you can do what everyone else does. The only issue is when you

[35:44] want to do what everyone else does, but get what none of them have. If you want to be exceptional

[35:49] by definition, you will be the exception. You will not be normal. You will be unlike the others.

[35:56] And so it makes sense that you would be in the out group. And it hurts as a human being because you

[36:01] want to be in the in group. It's part of our DNA. Shame is a real thing. And we don't want to feel

[36:06] that because in the in the in the in the natural world, if you're outside of the group, you have a much

[36:11] lower likelihood of living and procreating. So it's strong in our DNA to be in group. But the thing is

[36:19] you're actually not in group or out of group. You're transitioning. You're between groups.

[36:24] And so in that lonely chapter, that's where you can do a disproportion amount of work because you

[36:29] have no distraction. So you listen to the podcast. You read the tweets. You watch the videos. You

[36:33] consume the content because you know deep down I can do more than this. And you begin to see the

[36:38] person that you could be and realize how far you need to go to get there. But despite how far away

[36:44] it seems, your goals, the best version of you, you look back down the dead end road and you know

[36:49] that's not where you want to be. And so you keep going and realize that there's no turning back.

[36:53] Once you see the promise land, once you see what you could become, you can't go back. And if you're

[36:58] not sure who your real friends are. One, ask is it more likely or less likely that I hit my goals

[37:05] with this person in my life? Just think about it. Like if this person is in my life is a more like

[37:08] than my goals than remove them. Because it's better, deaf friends who force you to grow than

[37:13] ones who accept you as you are. Because the biggest risk to your future isn't your future competition

[37:18] or your rivals. It's the distraction that you insist on keeping in your life rather than doing the

[37:24] things you know you should be doing but aren't. Think about it like this. Imagine a competitor

[37:29] that you never want to go against. Focus, persistent, always learning, always improving,

[37:34] relentless. Says no to everything but that which makes them stronger. You know what he looks like?

[37:39] You know how he acts? You know who he associates with? Great. That's future you. I'll become him.

[37:47] You have to kill your current self for your new self to have room to grow. And so it's this constant

[37:52] appraisal of your skills and activities and saying which of these makes me stronger, which of these

[37:59] makes it more likely for me to hit my goal. And I just want to give you that frame because that like

[38:03] that single frame of is this person being in my life, make it more likely or less likely to hit my

[38:08] goal. Is this activity or this behavior that I do, make it more or less likely to hit my goal?

[38:12] And I consistently just ask that question over and over and over again. And that is because for me,

[38:18] I do love my goals more than I love my friend because my goals will be with me long after they are.

[38:23] And so if you think about your relationship with your goals and you put it on the same pedestal

[38:28] or higher, then your relationship with your friends, you're going to lose one of the relationships.

[38:34] And the question is which one is the one that's going to serve you more in the long term?

[38:37] That's a decision for you, but for me I can tell you personally, achieving my goals has served me

[38:42] more than anyone person has. And because achieving your goals is a generalized thing,

[38:47] it can open all doors to new relationships. And so you do have to burn sometimes what you have

[38:52] in order to have what you want. If you want to impress poor people outspend them,

[38:58] if you want to impress rich people outwork them. And I can tell you this being in the position

[39:03] that I'm at because I have tons of young men who work for me. And I mean they hear all the

[39:08] content that I make and they know that. And so if you lease a Ferrari for $5,000 a month or

[39:13] whatever, I know you're not rich. And every rich person isn't impressed by that because we know

[39:20] what it costs. You only impress poor people. And if you do it really early in your career,

[39:24] every rich person is like, man, you should be reinvesting that to get way fucking bigger.

[39:28] Now, if you're like an efficient auto and you want to have lots of cars and that's like,

[39:30] again, that's different. It depends on the reason you're doing it. It's like you shouldn't be cooking

[39:34] your own food unless you love cooking. But if you don't love cooking, then you should

[39:38] answer us that should as fast as possible so that you can get your time back. It's understanding

[39:41] the context of this, which of course this will be taking out of context. But hopefully you

[39:45] watching your listening this can at least get it. Laylen Eye both collectively started buying

[39:50] nicer things. So living in nicer places, having nicer cars, I bought my home, which was a nice house

[39:56] in Austin. I think it cost me 1.7 million. I bought it in cash and I bought it off one month

[40:01] paycheck. And so I want to put that in context to like, was it a ball in house? Totally. It was sick.

[40:07] I was super happy to be there. But where I lived before that cost me $2,200 bucks a month. And so you're

[40:12] like, wait, 1.7 right. We spend money, but by percentage, the amount of money we spend is in

[40:18] consequential. If you want to buy the toys and you want to buy that stuff, I'd say, sure, understand

[40:23] one. Whatever you spend, you're taking away from the future. Now there is always a point you have to

[40:27] balance between consumption and investment. If you never spend anything, you live, you live your

[40:31] entire life and you end up with a big palm money and you didn't enjoy any moment of that. I don't think

[40:35] that's the way to do it. But I do think there's a ratio there. And I think that ratio depends on

[40:39] you as an individual. I tend to always overindex on investment because I just, I want to become a

[40:43] really like great version of me. And I think that's going to cost money and it's in a cost time.

[40:49] And I like to be ready for those opportunities because the opportunities get bigger and have

[40:52] more zeros next to them. And there's no masterminds you get to at a certain level. You just

[40:56] do a deal with someone and if for me to pony up for the deal, I'd be like, hey, you got to

[40:59] write a check for 10 million. I'm like, oh, I got to have that ready for just like on the sidelines

[41:03] waiting for opportunities. Right. And so the idea is being on the defensive so that you can be on

[41:11] the offensive. It's living far below your lifestyles so that you can more heavily invest in the

[41:15] growth of the business. And so your lifestyle is your competitors' opportunity. There's you and

[41:21] other version of you. There's Bizarreau you. Right. And Bizarreau wants to live this great lifestyle

[41:25] and has the Ferrari and the nicer place and whatever. But when an opportunity comes along, Bizarreau

[41:30] doesn't have any savings because he's trying to show face, right? But the thing is, every

[41:35] he's trying to show face for hates in many ways because it looks like he's bragging. But also,

[41:39] they know how much he makes relatively and they're like, oh, he's got to be spending his whole

[41:43] check paycheck. He looks irresponsible. There's zero advantage to being accurately judged. If you are

[41:49] strong, you want to appear weak. You want to have more money than people expect you to have.

[41:54] And so for me, when we did buy the Bentley, which I bought because I got, I'll be honest,

[42:00] I got pressured into it. They're like, dude, come on, you make all this money like buy something

[42:04] nice for yourself. And I was like, I guess people buy nice cars. So I bought a car, bought a Bentley.

[42:08] And I returned at six months later and I lost 20 grand on it. And I was like, this is just a complete

[42:13] waste of everything. Like I just don't care at all about this. Because you only need three things to win.

[42:18] You can write this down. The balls to start, the brains to learn and the heart to never quit.

[42:23] And the good news is you already have all three. You're just not using it. Because fundamentally,

[42:28] if you found somebody and they started and they continued to get better and they never stopped,

[42:32] they would win. Just think about it from fundamental basics. Like I said, okay, think of a person

[42:36] who only did one thing and all they did at a care their entire life to is doing that one thing

[42:40] and getting better and better at that thing. And they did it for 50 years. Do you think that

[42:44] person would not be incredibly successful? Of course they would be. That why aren't you doing it?

[42:49] The problem is it's never been easier to start a business. It's also never been easier to do nothing.

[42:55] And this is what I mean by, your distractions are the things that are getting in your way,

[42:59] preventing you from doing the things you already know you should be doing to hard.

[43:03] Right now, if I were to say, hey, go get in shape. What do you need to do? What you want to say is,

[43:06] I'm going to go do some research to find the best program and find the best diet. But if I just said,

[43:10] no, no, no, no, you can't look. Make a guess. What would you say? Probably like, well, I need

[43:13] probably like go to the gym, probably do some weights, probably do some cardio, move a little bit.

[43:17] Or do you want to stay at the same weight? Do you want to stay at the same cardio pace?

[43:20] Or do you want to move those up over time? You probably say I want to move those up over time.

[43:23] Like, okay. And then food wise, like, do you want to probably eat more protein and eat less

[43:27] shit? Probably like, yeah, like, well, why don't we just start there? Most of the things you need to do,

[43:32] you already know what to do and you delay doing them by under the guise of having a better plan.

[43:37] But the reality is that your plan is always going to change as soon as you get new information.

[43:40] And so the point is to start period and learn. And it's giving yourself permission to have

[43:46] the humility to start a role that you know is not going to be your endgame because you just see it as

[43:52] one tile on the painting that's going to become the version of you that you want. So I got to start

[43:56] at this corner. I'm going to paint this corner up because I know that this cornerstone of experience

[44:01] in dordador or cold calling or media buying. Whatever is going to be something that I can build my

[44:10] home. There are maybe trillions of dollars, but at least hundreds of billions of dollars that are being

[44:15] made and dedicated every day to getting you to do nothing. It's not a fair fight. I want to be clear.

[44:20] It's not a fair fight and they're winning. And so I love this from any facilities. It personal

[44:25] excellence is the ultimate rebellion. And so I think like you want to be a fucking rebel, be excellent,

[44:32] and do it for you. Like you want to stick it to the man now, just be great. Fundamentally,

[44:37] the point of entertainment is to get someone to pay attention to it. That's all entertainment does.

[44:41] It's pay attention to me. And so that means that you're not paying attention to the thing that matters

[44:48] more to you in the long term. And so every dollar, every minute of attention you pay to entertainment

[44:53] whether that's poor and alcohol going at the clubs. All of social media in general,

[44:59] motivation porn, if you will. All of that is you not doing what you need to do to get to where you want to

[45:06] go. You just have to be able to do things without seeing an immediate reward. Like if there's one

[45:09] meta skill that that overshadows all of this, it's your ability to delay gratification. It's to delay

[45:17] a moment of reward. That's it. Like that's all you have to do. And in the beginning you just have to be

[45:21] able to do it long enough that you get one reward. And that reward is typically outsized and it's strength.

[45:25] And then that will reinforce you sticking with it because the people who do work really, really hard

[45:29] is not like they're made of different flesh and blood than you. It just means that they had a

[45:31] short period at some point where they said, I'm going to shut everything off off and I'm going to

[45:34] go all in on this. And then when they do get that first feedback loop, like Holy Shit, I made my

[45:38] first sale Holy Shit, I got my first lead from from Anne. Holy Shit, I got my first, you know,

[45:43] a hundred followers, whatever, just matter. Like you have some feedback loop for whatever is that you're

[45:47] trying to go after that then encourages you to do more. And they're like, oh, this could work.

[45:51] And then as soon as that turns on, you can get obsessed with it. If I had just signed a contract right now

[45:56] to be the guarantee that you'd be a millionaire in 10 years, but you couldn't make any real money

[46:01] between now and then, would you sign it? Every person I've asked says yes. And so maybe if you

[46:06] are listening to this and you're not here, I said, okay, from 30 a million here, yeah, sounds like a

[46:10] great deal. By the way, that's like 0.00 or whatever 1% like no one is. But if that's you, a lot of

[46:15] stuff takes much longer. And the problem is that when you're 20, you've only been an adult for like

[46:19] three seconds. And so the thing is that three seconds feels a very long time. But I have this belief that

[46:25] older people are more patient, not because they're actually more patient. It's just because

[46:31] you're perception of time speeds up. I can be more patient than a five year old because for me,

[46:37] one year is not 20% of my life. So my perception of time shrinks. I might have the same

[46:42] patients as a five year old. It's just that more time passes. And so if you are younger, then you

[46:48] have to just understand that. Your perception of time will speed up. And so you will be able to

[46:54] exhibit patients. You'll keep being able to do something else in the meantime because the

[46:57] meantime will pass faster. And so you have to over index on it when you're starting. I mean,

[47:03] I've got guys in my team and we're like, hey, what's my next career move? And they're like 30 days

[47:06] into their job. And I'm like, give it a second. Like you still suck. Like you went from suck to

[47:15] proficient. Like you're not great yet. Calm down. The real world's very different from school,

[47:18] which you've already, if you're watching myself, you already kind of have an idea about that.

[47:21] But I want to give you the more of the behavioral definition around it. Is that with school,

[47:24] you have very clear directions and a clear outcome with a clear timeline and you get a great

[47:28] immediately. So that's the kind of like the roar or feedback loop. And sometimes it's pop quiz

[47:32] same day next day you get the feedback loop. Or even you get you finish the quiz you go outside and they're

[47:36] like, hey, would you answer for six, you know, like, fuck, I got it wrong or whatever. But the thing is that

[47:40] they're wrote some ploughly opposite of that. And so the thing is that beginners are paralyzed to

[47:44] make a decision because they assume the real world works like school and only has one right answer.

[47:49] But reality is that there are many right answers with only one wrong answer, which is doing nothing.

[47:56] And that's the answer that most people pick. So I was talking to Neil Patel who's a friend of mine.

[47:59] And he just made this, this big tweet about this, but he now had a conversation about it earlier.

[48:03] He has two friends, one who's a public CEO, founder of company took a public. He's got another friend

[48:09] who found a company took a public, took a back private and then now only does private deals.

[48:13] The guy who does public and made all his money public is like, you got to go public. And the other guy

[48:18] took his company public and it was a big mess and then took a private again is actually richer than the guy who

[48:23] made his company public. Both those guys are billionaires and both gave advice and they had

[48:27] differing advice. And so I don't see it as one is right or wrong. It's that there are many right paths,

[48:33] but only one thing will prevent you from achieving all of it, which is the only thing I'm trying to

[48:38] comprehend this video is getting you to not do the one wrong path, which is fear, fear of not making

[48:44] it work, fear of other people's disproveal who don't matter anyways that you aren't cool anymore

[48:52] or because you don't shop to social events or because you don't blunt money on stuff that doesn't

[48:56] matter anymore or you're not wearing the brands that they think are cool is all of that worth

[49:01] you for the rest of your life having the crushing feeling of mediocrity knowing you could do more.

[49:07] And I say and I can describe this because I've lived it. That's why I say it. I'm not saying that

[49:12] that that stuff's not going to happen. It absolutely will happen. It might even be worse than you imagine.

[49:17] But you will not die and if you use the frame does me losing all of these relationships and

[49:23] having more time increase the likelihood that it gets my goal or decrease the likelihood that it gets my goal.

[49:30] All of a sudden when you use the goal frame of the best version of you all of a sudden it starts to

[49:36] it starts to make things a lot clearer. It's like no me going to this bachelor at party does not increase

[49:41] the likelihood that hit my goals. And I'm not saying that you have to make that sacrifice every time.

[49:47] But the thing is that you're making a sacrifice either way. You're either sacrificing your goals

[49:51] or sacrificing that relationship. And so some of you guys are like oh Alex that sounds unbalanced.

[49:57] I'm going to get a couple comments from the fucking online therapist of like I think emotional

[50:02] well being in mental hone is just super important. Well first off the pendulum swinging back

[50:06] and one gives us your share about the soft stuff anymore. Thank fucking God. But at some point

[50:11] everyone who wants to achieve great things realizes that balance is a myth. And once they realize that

[50:17] they become someone who achieves great things. At some point every person who wants to achieve

[50:23] great things realizes that balance is a myth. And once they realize that they become someone who

[50:30] achieves great things. And so there's this whole misnomer, this whole idea. Think about what

[50:36] mediocrity is. It's about being in the middle. It's the medium. It's being right in the middle.

[50:40] Right balance. But anybody who is imbalanced is another way of saying more focused on the one thing.

[50:49] We'll be better at that thing than you. And the question is just whether or not that thing that they

[50:53] choose to be better at will give them more leverage over all that other stuff later. And so if you

[50:59] worked very hard and you create something that's very valuable for society, I promise you you

[51:04] will be able to find a hotter wife. I promise you you will have the money that you want. I promise

[51:08] you can buy the time that you want to have. You will have all of that at your disposal. But if you

[51:14] choose the balance life there's nothing wrong with that. I just see that there is balance over

[51:18] a lifetime rather than balance every moment of life. And so you might have seasons like I took

[51:25] basically year off during the last year of gym lunch. I just didn't really do a lot. So I had

[51:30] more time than anybody. And money. Right? But I had seasons before that right? And so I think if

[51:37] you expand your time horizon for what balance really means, so this is a softer way of explaining it,

[51:42] then I think that that will make you sleep well at night. But real talk, I work all the time

[51:48] because I like to do it. And I think that once you get a fast feedback loop with the work that you

[51:52] like that also propels your goals, then you're not going to do anything else. And that's it's not

[51:56] like I or some of the people that it's not like the people that you look up to have some sort of

[52:02] hurtually and work ethic or dissonant that you don't. They like things that happen to also bring

[52:06] them status. And that means that they went through a small period where they started doing that thing

[52:11] when they worked it out and it didn't bring them status, but they wrote a make it through that

[52:15] bridge until eventually did start working and did bring them status and then they just kept going.

[52:19] So you just need enough gusto to start and just get through that period to just get through

[52:25] your friends saying you suck for a little bit. And everything you start will not be fun because you'll

[52:29] suck, but getting good is fun, getting better is fun. And so I get excited a lot of times when I see

[52:35] how bad I am at something that's new because I have enough generalized reinforcement for learning

[52:40] how to get better at things that you learn the skill of getting better. Like that's a meta skill,

[52:45] you learn how to learn. And so just see it as an opportunity to learn how to do anything better.

[52:48] So if you have a first thing then that's the first thing that you get better at. And then you'll

[52:52] learn the skill of getting better and you can apply it all over the place. Some of you guys are listening

[52:55] to this and you're like okay, you know this is great. I'm feeling awesome. The thing is is that

[53:00] people maybe it's you are waiting for this perfect moment, but it doesn't come, right? It happens

[53:07] the moment you decide that you're fed up with waiting and decide to take action. And it only

[53:11] becomes the perfect moment when you look back on it because today it just looks like now. I had a

[53:16] conversation with a young man yesterday who said, listen, I have demons and I was like, bro,

[53:25] you don't have fucking demons. I was like shut up and he was like, I was like, I was so

[53:32] visceral with my reaction because I used to say that kind of stuff because I thought it made me hard.

[53:36] I thought it made me complex. I thought it made me mysterious. But it's you don't have demons.

[53:41] You're not self-savutized. You don't have mom or dad issues. What you have is a lack of skills

[53:47] in how to behave in a certain condition. So when you say you have demons, what it really means

[53:53] if I say, okay, what do you mean by that? Define that. How do what does define having demons?

[53:59] What I don't most people say that they don't mean they actually think they have spiritual demons

[54:03] inside of them. I'm going to have you going to touch that. What they really mean is that under these

[54:07] conditions, I behave away that is not ideal. And so what that means is you have a skill deficiency.

[54:13] No shit. You're inexperienced. Of course you have a skill deficiency. You don't have demons.

[54:17] You don't know how to be consistent. You're not, you don't have, I just can't stay with any

[54:22] prefer a long time. No, it either means you have really high standard which is fine and you'd

[54:25] have them at that person yet. Or you just don't know how to behave consistently. It's like when

[54:31] I have a sales guy who's like, hey, you know, I'm 30 days into this role and I'm getting,

[54:35] I'm getting kind of board taking sales calls. I'm like, oh, your ability to not be able to continue

[54:41] after something gets boring and learn to love the incremental improvements the 100 or

[54:47] thousand repetitions is the skill discrepancy that you need to overcome. The best sales people,

[54:55] bad sales people trying have a couple good days. Good sales people get on hot streets.

[55:01] Great sales people never get cold. And so that takes discipline to understand how to consistently

[55:07] get yourself hot, how to consistently treat every sale the same way you do when you're on fire.

[55:14] Because there is no being on fire. It means you simply behave differently. It's not like you have magic.

[55:20] You pause differently. You take longer spaces. You ask the question. You're tonality shifts.

[55:25] And those are skills because you can learn them. And so this whole thing of like, this is the

[55:31] young man. I'm traumatized. First off, you don't even have a fucking definition of trauma.

[55:35] All right. Trauma is a permanent change in behavior from an a versus stimulus, meaning something

[55:40] bad happens and forever it changes how you act. Now let's, if we understand that as the definition of

[55:47] trauma is trauma bad. Well, if I touch a stove and then I never touch a stove again when it's hot,

[55:54] is that trauma bad? It permanently changes my behavior from a versus stimulus. Is that trauma bad?

[55:59] Well, it prevented me from getting how burning the house down from, you know,

[56:02] permanently damaging my hand in the future. No, I would say it was good. And so this whole

[56:06] appraisal of your past being tough or you don't understand, bro. No, and no one cares either.

[56:13] They don't understand nor do they care. And so all anyone is going to care about is how you act,

[56:18] how you behave, what you do based on a series of conditions. And so you just need to expose yourself

[56:24] to the conditions so that you can get the repetitions so that you can learn how to overcome it.

[56:28] The thing that determines whether it's good or bad is whether it creates a behavior that's conducive

[56:32] to your goals. And so that means that fundamentally you can have a stimulus like touching the

[56:36] stove that creates a behavior that is conducive to the goal. And that way, trauma was good.

[56:42] So, by the way, parents, when you punish a child, the hope is that you traumatized them,

[56:47] is that you permanently change their behavior from a versus stimulus. It's just that people don't

[56:51] define words and they just shot them all over. But if I say, say, it's stored in your body,

[56:54] it's energy. It's like, no one even knows the fuck that means. Show me on someone's body where it's

[56:58] stored. Do me an x-ray. Show me where there's no. Come on. Like, you're saying you're storing

[57:04] your emotional trauma from your father and your liver. Like, I can just say words and make things up

[57:11] and get people not if I say them with conviction. It doesn't make it's true. And so you may have

[57:15] been fooled because sometimes it's more convenient to say you can cast your power onto this thing

[57:21] that happened that was outside of your control as the reason why you can't be successful. Because

[57:25] it's easier to say that than to say that I chose not to do anything about it anyways. And again,

[57:32] listen, you can do whatever you want. You can just keep wallowing in that. You can keep saying that

[57:36] that's the reason. And wherever you point is where your power is. But the only time that you have

[57:40] more powers, if you say it's on you, period. Because all of those things may have happened and they

[57:45] may have all been terrible. And what are you going to do about it? Because the only part like no one cares

[57:53] like the world is a care. You care, which is fine. But like no one else does. And the sooner you

[57:58] realize that the sooner you start doing something about it. And so also think about this, you

[58:04] will upset if trauma can create good things, then it also means that good things can create bad

[58:12] behaviors. And so if you win the lottery and then you have all these behaviors to happen afterwards,

[58:17] that are negative, then was it good for you? Like we talk about these rich and privileged kids

[58:22] because it creates behaviors that actually make it less likely that they achieve things later.

[58:27] And so just think about what occurred and what behaviors you take is a result and separate

[58:33] good or bad from it and just think, does it make it more likely that I hit my goals?

[58:36] It makes life a lot easier and then it stops you from speaking in voodoo and speaking and appealing

[58:44] to mysticism and magic. Like there's this force around a demons. It's like dude, no. Like you

[58:51] had a girl who cheated on you. Okay. Now what is that change about your behavior? I have trust

[58:56] issues. No, it just means that under these conditions you are slower to give someone access to your

[59:05] bank account or slower to move in with someone. Come on, who cares? And is that a bad thing? And so

[59:11] I'll walk you through a three set framework that has been unbelievably valuable to me and this is from

[59:16] Dr. Cassie. Logic, Evidence, Utility. Logic is, what does that mean? So you have demons. Okay,

[59:25] what does that mean? Define it in terms of behavior. What does that mean? Okay, got it. Now,

[59:30] how do you know that? Evidence. So you say I have demons. We unpack that and it means that

[59:37] for you, you self-savetage, which again, define that. Okay. It means that I show up late to meetings,

[59:45] after I get into a job after two months of being on time. Okay. So after two months of being on time,

[59:51] you start being late to stuff. That we translated from I have demons to myself sabotage to

[59:58] that is the behavior that occurs. Got it. Now, I would say how do you know that? Now, a lot of times

[60:03] we were like, well, it's happened. But when you actually look at it, it happened three times over,

[60:08] and you know, in my last job. Okay. Is it really a problem as you define it or what happened in those three

[60:15] occurrences? Okay. Got it. So now, you know, now most times we were like, I don't have any

[60:20] did. And you're like, okay, so then this is basically made up. And when I say made up, I'm not saying

[60:24] that's like you are a liar. I'm just saying that humans work in narratives. And a lot of times we

[60:28] add narratives, stories, to things that don't actually mean anything. But it's convenient. And it's fun.

[60:34] And we like talking about it. But it doesn't mean it's true. And so then you look, move to the third one,

[60:38] which is, and so what? Utility. Who cares? Why does this matter? And so then you say, okay, well,

[60:45] this matters because it decreases likely that I will be able to obtain future employment. Fine.

[60:50] Then when we do about it. And so you can walk through things that you have struggled with in the past,

[60:56] with simply saying, let me define this in terms of behavior. What evidence do I have that this

[61:01] is actually true in that of that I've defined it based on these things? And who cares?

[61:06] I have demons in the kitchen. All right, just as a completely ridiculous example. Okay. Well, in my past,

[61:11] I've had bad things happen, bro. Like what? Like what occurred? I touched a stove and it burned to me.

[61:19] Okay. Great. Now we have some evidence wise. How many times did it happen? One time. Okay.

[61:26] And it never happened to get into the future. Okay. What did that result it? I don't go into kitchen anymore.

[61:30] Okay. Now this is good or bad when you say who cares? It's in relation to what? My goals

[61:37] does you not go into the kitchen prevent you from achieving the goals? Well, if you want to be a chef,

[61:42] yes. If you want to be an entrepreneur, no. If you want to be a kitchen entrepreneur, probably.

[61:47] Right. And so the question is just who cares? Why does it matter? And so so much of our time and effort

[61:53] goes into explaining things to people that don't matter at all, that you could literally just move on from

[62:00] and just literally forget about. You could get over that quote trauma by changing the behavior that

[62:05] it changed adversively. So in this context or in this condition, I behave this way and it's not

[62:10] conducive to my goals. Great. That's good that you've identified it. Cool. So what do we need to do

[62:14] so that when you're in the condition? How can we increase the likelihood that you do act the way that you

[62:18] want to? And then you start stacking the deck to start shifting the pendulum in your favor.

[62:23] And you start attacking each of these little problems from skills that you have, whether it's behavior

[62:27] with people or it's skills at work or with a relationship and you just do it one by one by one. And if you

[62:32] do it over a very long period of time, you get better. I promise you, I'm saying this is somebody who

[62:36] I struggle with my demons. You don't understand, bro. Like I have stuff like okay.

[62:42] What does it help you? And it also doesn't make you a Carter. It just makes you less capable.

[62:52] Losers talk about what happened to them. Winners talk about what they made happen to spite it.

[62:58] Heartship is a reality for losers. To winters, hardship is just your origin story.

[63:05] And like I promised you, if you can use this frame, like I was texting Laila the other day,

[63:08] like the bigger the much the more epic the hero. It's the story that you're going to someday tell.

[63:12] When you're 85, you're not going to want more boring stories. Right? The idea is that if you're going

[63:18] through hardship now, that's the story that you're going to tell. And if you believe yourself to be

[63:21] the hero that you want to someday become, then the harder it is, you're like, bring it. This is my story.

[63:26] This is the Spider-Man getting bitten. This is him getting beat up by the bullies. This is the origin story.

[63:31] No one cares about a hero who never had it hard. I bought a lottery ticket years and years and years

[63:37] when I was in college. Because it was like a billion or something like that back back then.

[63:41] That was what a billion dollars meant something. But I was in college and my girlfriend at the time,

[63:49] I was talking to her and the drawing was then we bought him for fun. We bought one.

[63:53] I was expecting to win. It was just a basic I was buying her for the conversation.

[63:57] And I thought about it as like the drawing on clootion, I realized I had this big pain and anxiety.

[64:01] Because I was like, what if I win? And I had this moment of terror because I realized that if I won,

[64:07] that I would never be able to achieve anything that anyone thought was my own.

[64:12] And that thought terrified me. And thankfully, I didn't win the billion dollars.

[64:19] And I got to make the life that I have. And so I think that I think epictetus says this,

[64:23] but it's something to the degree of what a shame it would be for someone to never encounter hardship

[64:29] because they would never be able to see who they are. And so I think that if you have gone through

[64:34] hardship or you are going through hardship, this is the opportunity to prove to yourself, not anyone else,

[64:41] that you are who you say you are and you are made of what you say you are made of. And you can choose

[64:47] to allow that hardship to make you harder, to make you more resilient, to make you more persistent,

[64:54] to make you more relentless, to make you more driven towards whatever you want to do,

[64:58] or whoever you want to be, or you can allow it to be an ankle weight, you can allow it to be your trauma,

[65:06] that is your demon that you're fighting every day. But the thing is, is like everyone has demons.

[65:12] Everyone has hardship. And I want to tell you this frame that hopefully changed someone's perspective,

[65:18] which is that your hard stuff may have been harder than other people's hard stuff.

[65:23] But if I take a human being who has never encountered anything and then I poke them with a needle,

[65:28] that will be a 10 out of 10 hardship for them. And so I believe personally that

[65:34] humans experience pain the same way. It's why when a man feels disrespected, it hurts just as much

[65:41] as someone else going through another crazy hardship. And you know what? Even if that guy's

[65:47] white, a 10 out of 10 pain still feels like a 10 out of 10 pain. Now could that pain be less on the

[65:53] absolute scale of worse scenario? Yeah, it could be. But also who cares?

[66:01] And so my point here is that every single human being on earth has gone through their version of 10 out of

[66:05] 10 pain, which normalizes pain across the spectrum, which then leaves you with the only natural

[66:10] thing you have left, which is what do I do now? And if you wanted to design the perfect version of you,

[66:15] the savage competitor, the gladiator at the end of the life that has the scars and the

[66:19] scrubby beard, but has been through shit, has done things and has realized their potential.

[66:25] What would you do to maximize the likely that you become that savage hero? Would you give them the

[66:32] padded lifestyle? Would you give them the immediate win? Would you give them the easy life?

[66:37] Probably not. You would probably put you through what you're going through right now to become

[66:43] that person. And so why would you resent the chapter you're in because it's a requirement for

[66:49] becoming who you say you want to be? Let's say you've gotten over your little demon thing. And when I

[66:54] say God know over you just stop giving it power by saying it now is the reason that you can't be

[66:58] successful. Awesome. So what do you do now? Right? So you've got to start figuring things out.

[67:03] And that figured out muscles probably the most powerful muscle you can build. It's just saying,

[67:06] oh, I don't know how to do this. I will figure it out. Why? Because I figured out things in the past

[67:09] and I can do it again. And if that person could do it and they're no smarter than I am, they have two

[67:12] pens in a brain. I can do it too. So the next time that you say you can't figure something out,

[67:17] just set a timer for 20 hours and actually try for 20 hours before you quit. What you'll often

[67:22] realize is it's not hard. You just haven't even tried. If you can shrink the time between saying

[67:27] you want to learn something and beginning to try the thing and extend the time before you say,

[67:31] hey, this is hard, then you will be able to accomplish way more than you think. You can learn

[67:36] most things in 20 hours. The problem is that most people delay the first 20 hours by years. And if you

[67:41] really measured yourself by the amount of action you take, not your desire, not your deservingness,

[67:46] or even your effort, you might actually be embarrassed because what you're looking at is reality.

[67:51] It's about what you do, not what you say you're going to do, how much you want the outcome

[67:55] from what you're doing, how much you think you deserve the thing that's going to happen after you do it,

[67:59] or how hard you try because one no one cares. Two, reality doesn't care either because the

[68:04] only thing that matters that you can control is input. And you would be absolutely astonished

[68:09] at what you can accomplish when you give yourself no choice. Every third time I do a Q&A,

[68:13] I get asked the question, what keeps you going when things were tough, like what did you think about?

[68:19] And I could come up with something that was really compelling. The honest truth is, I just never

[68:25] considered quitting. It was just not, it was just not on my choice of options at the table.

[68:30] Because for me, the idea of going back to Baltimore as a failure was so much worse than anything

[68:36] else that I could encounter, that it just, it just wasn't even a consideration. And so the only

[68:42] natural option I had was to persist was to endure, was to continue. And so I think if you use that

[68:48] frame as there have been people who have gone through significantly worse than what I'm going through

[68:52] right now. And for those of you who claim the demon card of like I've been through shit, then prove it.

[68:57] Was it worse than this? Great. Then you can prove that it was so hard by being hard now.

[69:02] Across timeframes in history, across countries, across cultures, across age groups, across race,

[69:10] gender, everyone respects the man who works. Because as men, we are always judged by what we can do.

[69:18] And if you are doing things, then people know that you are contributing. That is how you prove

[69:22] utility. Work ethic is the currency of respect. If you want to earn respect, you earn it through work.

[69:29] And sometimes it's working on yourself. That sometimes it's working on a skill, working on a

[69:32] product, but it is all through work, through effort. I'll tell you something that shifted my life,

[69:36] which is that entrepreneurship is not a game of best men wins. It's a game of last men standing.

[69:41] And there's a lot of games that are like this. And fundamentally, that's an infinite game frame

[69:46] versus a finite game frame. And I will read you the quote that Layla had framed and put in my office.

[69:52] Ask the girl, shoot the shot, launch the business, run the ad, quit the job, take the risk.

[69:58] Because when you're 85 years old and on your deathbed, you're not going to wish you a few

[70:01] or crazy stories.

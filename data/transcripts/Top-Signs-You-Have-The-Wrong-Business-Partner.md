[00:00] What's going on everyone? I have been known as the partnership killer

[00:04] And so what I want to share to you with you today is something that comes up on I mean

[00:09] Every week on coaching calls with you know younger entrepreneurs younger business owners not even younger just other business owners

[00:16] Who aren't doing as much and who want more and the question is usually one of two things first is you know

[00:22] What should our roles be within our partnership and then two?

[00:25] What do you think of partnerships in general and so what I want to do is share with you a

[00:30] Hard Hard lessons that I have and so first right off the bet

[00:35] I think I counted I have nine failed partnerships and so I just want to say right right before you even get going

[00:42] I could be the problem with the partnerships

[00:44] Right if if you have that many failed partnerships then it's probably you you were the common theme

[00:49] So I will say that first and foremost upfront

[00:53] That being said I think the reason that many of those partnerships should all have been you know almost concurrently

[00:58] I just did partnership with a partnership with a partnership because I heard it's like you got a fun good partners

[01:02] But what I didn't understand was how it actually needed to be structured and how it worked and so

[01:07] There's there's a few pieces of that the first is if you're just starting out

[01:12] I think that for the most part it's better to not have partners and that is because

[01:17] Usually it's like you and a buddy and you're like hey we like hanging out

[01:20] We should go into business together when really you're doing that for the emotional need to be satisfied

[01:25] Somebody to talk to and share the experience with but not because it's a good business decision and

[01:29] The only reason for you to have a partner is because they either have money or skills that you do not have

[01:34] That is it

[01:35] So the only reason money or skills that's it and so if you both are

[01:40] Entrepreneurial people on you're both you know love selling love marketing

[01:43] You're very promotion oriented which many entrepreneurs are right if that's you

[01:47] Then if they're that way too then one of you's not required and you have to really face that

[01:52] So if you both like the same stuff you both should be

[02:01] Almost always fails like literally it almost always fails and so that's the first one

[02:05] The second thing is that those jump into bed at the other partnerships

[02:09] Don't have step number two which is you don't have a contract you don't have terms

[02:12] You don't have an agreement and the reason is because you're so afraid of like messing up the vibe

[02:16] We don't operate that way you will when it gets fucked up at the end

[02:19] But I'm telling you right now I now even when I have somebody who approaches me and says hey

[02:24] Like what you take a percentage of my company can you coach me through this ball of ball

[02:27] I say let's go through the lawyers first all right because the thing is is

[02:31] You get to see how this person acts under stress because it is stressful because

[02:37] inherently you're going to disagree on things and so this is the perfect expert like perfect time for you to

[02:42] Go kind of get a simulation of that. It's like what what happens if you don't want to work

[02:46] And I want to work what happens if you leave what happens if I don't want to do this anymore

[02:50] What like you have to go through all this scenarios and get a good lawyer and you should really have to that represent you

[02:56] If you don't have the money for that then get somebody to just counsel you on you know

[03:00] You can Google a standard partnership agreement

[03:02] They're templates for free online and you can pay one lawyer for one hour of of time to at least say these are the things you should look for now

[03:10] You know decide amongst yourselves and so you can represent yourself in your partnership

[03:14] You know agreement, but you have to have the agreement and you have to spell it out

[03:17] In clear terms

[03:18] Because if you don't have that it's like it's the bedrock of good communication and expectations right like otherwise

[03:24] Usually like most relationships

[03:26] bit

[03:27] Partnerships end because of unmet and unspoken

[03:31] Expectations like why thought you're going to do this is like why didn't no but no one even says that because it can't communicate

[03:35] So first is you probably shouldn't just jump together with somebody because they

[03:40] They're just like you

[03:41] If you are going to do that then you should make sure that you have contracts in place and then finally

[03:46] What I want to do is kind of explain you what the three main rules

[03:50] Rolls that exist in a business are okay three the three pillars all right

[03:55] I want to see if I've tried five here. All right here we go. Here's my tripod. All right, so there's three pillars

[04:01] To every business, right the first is acquisition

[04:06] Which is the rainmaker or somebody who's going to bring in business. So that's marketing and sales

[04:10] All right acquisition the money get her all right the second of these is the product

[04:16] Which is what you are actually selling?

[04:18] It's the fulfillment. It's the service. It's the widget. It's the whatever somebody who knows how to deliver it all right and then third

[04:26] You have the operations which is everything else that has to happen in the company paying payroll paying taxes making sure legal and contracts and

[04:35] IT and

[04:36] You know finance and all like the you know your accounting all of that stuff

[04:41] HR has to happen right and so these are the three legs of every business now

[04:46] They're not necessarily equally weighted and that's an it's an important point right like a lot of times

[04:51] There are good operators that you can get for significantly less and many times not even equity

[04:56] Because there are more of them right now rainmaking being able to bring in business is a very highly valued skill in the marketplace

[05:03] The flip side having the thing the product that you're going to sell is also very valuable now

[05:08] This is why skill stacking is so important if you can have multiple of these skills

[05:13] Then you have two or all three of the legs right now your these are the roles that have to exist

[05:19] It doesn't mean you have to be partners with these people

[05:22] But you have to have all three of these things for your business to stand up and so for example

[05:27] Within the company I'll walk through my roles within each of the companies that I own and so

[05:33] The first is Jim lunch, right so in Jim launch I am both the acquisition and the product right

[05:40] That was my founding role within the company lay-up my wife

[05:45] runs ran all the operations so everything else so like I said IT billing legal

[05:51] Finance HR all of that stuff that had to happen. She took care of right super important

[05:56] But because of that we had all three legs of the stool and we were able to build a business

[06:01] If you're missing one of the legs, it's not gonna work

[06:04] Right and with this is where this is really dangerous is like a lot of the marketing people that are in this world are really good promoters

[06:10] They can get people in they can sell them but then they have no fulfillment

[06:13] They have no thing right and then they have no one who's organized and so everything like you send emails in

[06:18] You try and get help and they don't respond

[06:20] It's because they just don't have the other piece. I don't think it's because they're bad intention

[06:23] I think just don't have the skill and so you have to have all three and so if you're gonna bring someone in

[06:28] You need them to have one of those things right now

[06:32] You can start a business and own all of it and just make sure that you fill the roles of those people

[06:35] But as you're thinking through it

[06:37] Those are the roles so if you're going to bring partners in in the beginning you're gonna be clear about what it is that they're bringing to the table now

[06:43] If they're if they're one of those three

[06:46] Right then that's a clearly defined role and then at that point

[06:49] That's what you can lay out in your agreement and then you can argue about or you know

[06:53] Negotiate whatever equity if you're doing this in the beginning

[06:56] But if you've already started at that point then you can look at the three legs of the stool and see where

[07:02] Where am I lacking right and so for most of you guys who are listening most people follow me are on the

[07:08] or like the promotion side so they like the acquisition side

[07:12] Then what you need to do is find a strong operator

[07:14] All right and depending on what you're selling if you know the thing that you're selling then you can basically be product and acquisition and

[07:20] Have a strong second to help you fulfill on those things and basically don't go to jail right and you know get by your taxes and all the other stuff

[07:27] And so when I'm thinking about partnerships and when I have you know younger guys were coming in many many times

[07:34] After having discussions with me and then talking to them

[07:37] Each other they realize that they have the exact same role. They like the same things and one of them is not necessary

[07:41] And so they oftentimes split and that's not a bad thing

[07:45] Right it's better to recognize an error early than a recognized an error late

[07:48] All right, and so you may be in one of these partnerships where you're like we got to both do the same thing kind of just overlap on everything

[07:53] It's like yeah, that's just two people working the same thing and so it's not like you don't want to just be like

[07:58] Oh, there here's all this work all the half you do have that's not a good partnership

[08:02] You have to figure out what are the things weird I am good at what are the things you are good at and then we draw all line on the board and everything on that side you own

[08:08] And everything on this side I own and I'm responsible for because everyone's responsible for everything

[08:12] No one's responsible for anything right and then nothing's gonna get done and then you can never know who to blame and someday

[08:17] You're like well he takes out the trash or awesome. I take out the trash

[08:19] We just kind of we're just like kind of get it done type of stupid

[08:23] There's no there's no big business that works out. All right, and so if even if you are small

[08:27] You need to start thinking big to become big right so you got to do the actions before you get the results

[08:31] You have to have the beliefs before you get the outcomes of a bigger business to become a bigger business

[08:36] And the reason most businesses stay small is because they think small and they ask small

[08:39] So they stay that way because the outcome of what they're doing is the result of the actions

[08:43] They're making which are small right and so right now if you're in a partnership

[08:47] If you don't have a partnership or you think about starting a business

[08:50] I would definitely try and just acquire the skills myself get going and then the first hire

[08:55] I'm gonna have is gonna be a strong operational second all right

[08:57] It's the first thing I'm gonna do if you are in a partnership

[09:00] You need to put all the activities that you do on a board

[09:03] I do this when I do consulting stuff

[09:05] But all the activities that happen in the business on a board if you don't know what it is you do a time study

[09:09] Which means you write down every 15 minutes what you do in a week

[09:11] Right because you probably don't know because you've scattered all over the place

[09:13] So if you write it all down and you both bring it to each other and you put it on a whiteboard or put it on a board

[09:18] Then what you can do is say okay, these are all the things these are all the activities that happen in our business

[09:23] Let's divide these out and say who owns these all right?

[09:26] And that's the very beginning of an organization because you were becoming organized you were

[09:31] Creating roles and responsibilities you were creating specialization of skills

[09:34] Which is what moved humanity forward specializations a good thing right and so the very beginning you get all of it on there

[09:39] And you can divide it out and you can divide it based on the skills of the person if you both have the same skills

[09:43] Then either you need to decide okay, well, I'm gonna become a specialist in this and you're gonna become a specialist in this

[09:48] Or we shouldn't be doing this business together and you should do a business

[09:51] It's just like minor or something else and you should become and you should be that role for that company

[09:56] And you should find a second just like I will all right and oftentimes if you can even at least think that way

[10:00] Then you don't lose you don't look what ate the most valuable thing in the whole world

[10:04] Which is your equity all right because if you're think actually does grow if your business actually does grow

[10:09] Then the biggest delusion of how much money you're going to make is that first decision when you started when you just decided

[10:15] Just right off the bat to give half of everything away all right, and I've made this mistake nine times and

[10:23] It took me and you know, I haven't had it a partner in

[10:26] Four years and I've made all of the money in my life post partners and so

[10:33] There's also other factors you want to look at too like what kind of you know

[10:36] Kind of working schedule you have how much vacation time doing had are you gonna work leekings?

[10:40] Do you work late at night? Do you work in the mornings? Do you expect each other to be responsive like there's all these little things that

[10:45] You need to make sure you dial in because if you don't it's just going to cost trouble later

[10:49] And it may be hard conversations for you now, but believe me it'll be much harder later when the

[10:54] Expectations are not being met and now you have money involved all right

[10:57] So anyways these are the things that think through when I'm looking at partners and partnerships and why oftentimes

[11:01] I do break up many partners because they don't start them for the same for the right reasons

[11:05] And so I hope you found this valuable if you have partner talk to them about it show them this video and

[11:11] Keeping amazing and lots of love. Oh total bonus

[11:15] I have noticed that works really well so many times it's married couples

[11:19] Mary couple starting business together

[11:21] They already have usually

[11:23] Different season skills and different dynamics and so that usually works well

[11:26] Usually one of them is the more go-getter hunter killer, right?

[11:30] You know the acquisition side and the other person usually they'll more organized more stable

[11:34] You know more even headed like does all the ops in the back of the back-end stuff, right?

[11:38] And so even just thinking about front-end and back-end

[11:40] Is a good way to start and that's why I love having married couples in general

[11:44] Because they almost always are successful if they can just eliminate those skills and they usually already have

[11:48] Even even without speaking they already unknowingly have made a lot of these specializations

[11:52] This is why a lot of times they're more successful. They also have the interpersonal emotional

[11:58] Sounding board to balance things off of and also to release some of the stress that inevitably comes when you're when you're running a business

[12:03] So anyways, hope you enjoyed the video hope you found this valuable

[12:06] You know share it with your partner or potential partners and see you next vid bye

[00:00] Hello everyone and welcome to another episode of the game.

[00:03] What I want to talk to you about today was a conversation that I had with Nick Bayer,

[00:07] Lee, we went to dinner last night.

[00:09] He has a mastermind of men called Billion Dollar, Billion Dollar Brotherhood.

[00:16] And we were having conversation about motivation.

[00:18] And I figured out chair with you because I think it was of a lot of value.

[00:22] And so I was sharing that recently.

[00:24] I had delineated between the feelings of envy and jealousy.

[00:31] And how important it has been for me to be able to first name those emotions,

[00:36] so that I could then analyze how I was feeling about them and the actions that I would

[00:39] subsequently take as a result of them.

[00:42] And so I want to at least first cover those and then I'll tell you about our conversation.

[00:46] And so envy is having the desire for something that someone else has that you do

[00:54] not have.

[00:55] So you are lacking and someone else has something that you want and do not have.

[00:58] That is envy.

[01:00] jealousy is when you have a threat that someone is going to take something that you have

[01:07] that they do not have.

[01:08] All right.

[01:09] And so for example, I'll give you an example of each.

[01:11] So envy, I may be envious of a friend of mine.

[01:13] So I was actually talking to a good friend of mine who runs a big way last company.

[01:17] And right now he's doing better than I am.

[01:19] And now I am envious of his success.

[01:22] I am.

[01:23] I'm envious.

[01:24] I got off the phone.

[01:25] I was like, I am envious of you.

[01:26] On the flip side, if someone comes to talk to Laila, right, it is the fact that they pose

[01:33] the threat of taking attention or her attention that I think should continuously belong

[01:38] to me that I would feel jealous over.

[01:40] I haven't had, I haven't felt jealousy in a long time.

[01:43] But that is an example.

[01:44] It could also be like with your kids if you have some, you know, some other adult in

[01:49] their life starts taking their attention or has more influence over them.

[01:52] You are jealous of the influence that that person is now threatening your influence over

[01:56] your child.

[01:57] So two examples, there are nuance, but I think it's important.

[02:00] And when I was talking to Nick Barrely about this, I was talking about how I think envy

[02:06] gets a bad rap.

[02:07] And I'm not going to go into the spiritual religious side of this or even the happiness

[02:10] side of this because I think envy absolutely does not make you happy.

[02:14] But I do think that envy will make you successful.

[02:17] And so this is where I want to dive into this.

[02:21] envy is adaptive, right?

[02:23] As human beings, this is actually from our old brain, right?

[02:26] This is animals have this too.

[02:27] They are invious of one another.

[02:29] And it's because if in a group, one person or one being, one animal, whatever brings

[02:35] more to the table, you are now invious of that person and what it does is it elevates the

[02:39] rest of the group to go and achieve the same, which is good for the collective.

[02:44] Not happier for each of the individuals, but as a pro survival tool, right?

[02:49] And so for me understanding this and at least being able to name the emotion rather than

[02:54] saying, I don't like this guy or I am angry at this person or having this negative feeling

[02:58] that you cannot put words to.

[03:00] Instead being able to say, I am envious has been very relieving from him because now I

[03:04] can actually tell those people, hey, I'm envious of you.

[03:08] And for some reason, I think it just creates another level of candor because it's the

[03:11] certain level of vulnerability and saying, you have something that I wish I had.

[03:15] And then you will notice that the conversation is not defensive on that person's part.

[03:20] Most of the time, they are like, well, let me help you.

[03:22] And it's only when we guys are intentions or trying to, or trying to fain pretend to be a

[03:28] different way than we are, where people also can sense that you are being disingenuous,

[03:33] like great job man, right?

[03:35] When realized deep down and they can tell from your subtle tonality changes and the way

[03:38] you look that you are actually not happy for them.

[03:42] And so I think if you can only say it, then it actually gives you power.

[03:45] Now, in terms of judging your motivations, because obviously, I think that envy is a bad

[03:50] motivation.

[03:52] It is my belief that I would rather deal with people who do good things for bad reasons

[03:56] than bad reasons for good things.

[03:59] I said the same thing twice.

[04:01] But they do the right thing for the wrong reasons rather than the wrong things for the

[04:06] right reason.

[04:07] I'd rather someone who does the right outcome.

[04:10] And he gave me an example that was really powerful.

[04:13] He said a friend of his was a top Navy seal.

[04:17] And one of the best Navy seals, he trained Navy seals just a total badass, right?

[04:22] And before that, he was an EMT.

[04:24] And he talked about his experiences being an EMT, is that most people think EMTs have to

[04:28] be really caring.

[04:29] You want them to have to save these people's lives every day.

[04:33] And he said the Navy seal was saying, I was not compassionate at all.

[04:38] I didn't really care that much about the person who was on the table in front of me.

[04:42] But what I did care about was my stats.

[04:44] I cared about the status of being the best.

[04:47] I wanted to have the fastest to the hospital.

[04:49] I want to have the highest survivor, highest success rates of the people that were under

[04:53] my care because I cared about myself being the best.

[04:57] And so the question is, if you were the person who was on the table having heart attack,

[05:02] would you rather have the compassionate EMT?

[05:05] Would you rather have the self-interested EMT?

[05:08] Who is doing it for status?

[05:11] Well, if it were me, I'd rather have the guy who wanted to pride himself

[05:13] among the best in the world and didn't care about me at all because I knew his result

[05:17] was going to be more pro-me than the other persons.

[05:20] And so I think that as humans as entrepreneurs, we judge ourselves a lot on our motivations

[05:25] and our intentions.

[05:27] But I think that if we can take a step back and aim the emotion so that it's not this

[05:31] amorphous thing that we can understand.

[05:34] But then the next step and say, is this a pro-adaptive emotion?

[05:39] Is this something that's going to help me?

[05:41] Or is this an emotion that's going to drive me to do something that is negative?

[05:45] And I think at least even in naming that we can increase the time between emotion and action.

[05:50] And the further that time gap is in general, the better the quality of the decisions

[05:55] we may because the more rational we are, we're never completely rational because we're

[06:00] a motion driven beings and we have limbic systems that override things.

[06:03] But the more we can decrease the triggers of the emotional triggers that that causes

[06:07] us to make bad decisions, ultimately the better the decision we make.

[06:11] And so I say all this to say, big picture.

[06:15] First, naming the emotions is important.

[06:17] Second, it creates space so we can make better decisions.

[06:21] Third, we can analyze the decisions and say, is this something that is going to help me

[06:25] in my life or is this something that's going to hurt me?

[06:28] And then as a result of this, we don't have to judge ourselves as strongly on why we are

[06:35] doing things and rather what is being done because candidly I am a very envious individual

[06:43] and maybe this is me just rationalizing my own negative emotions.

[06:49] Who knows?

[06:50] But at least for me saying it that way and framing the thought process in that way

[06:55] has helped me feel better about myself and just not really just less bad if that's

[07:01] probably a better way of saying it.

[07:03] Not constantly berating myself for having desires that I think are wrong.

[07:09] And so Dan Sullivan said this and I'll end with this is that when people want something,

[07:16] if you want to make more money, if you want to have a bigger house, you want to have

[07:19] a bigger car, you want to build a podcast studio, whatever.

[07:23] He said wanting is reason enough because so many times we ask, why do we want that?

[07:29] We're probably not going to change the desire.

[07:31] And so letting ourselves desire things and giving ourselves permission to desire things

[07:37] and myself specifically has been incredibly freeing and what it's done is giving me a

[07:42] tremendous amount of my intention back that used to be allocated to analyzing why I'm

[07:48] feeling this way or why this is right or why this is wrong and instead accepting the fact

[07:54] that I want something and that wanting it is okay as long as it is not something that

[07:59] is hurting other people and that is not something that is hurting me.

[08:03] And so anyways, I hope that makes sense.

[08:05] I hope that provides you some value or hopefully maybe some clarity around putting words

[08:08] to your own emotions, the decisions that results from them and whether they are positive

[08:12] or negative and eliminating the judgment from that equation provided it's something that

[08:16] helps.

[08:17] So anyways, keeping awesome, keep me amazing and have an awesome great magic money

[08:22] day.

[08:23] Get your Zoom.

[08:24] Bye.

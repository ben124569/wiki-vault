[00:00] You guys want to hear something absolutely insane. I made more in a year than the CEOs of McDonald's

[00:05] Ford Motorola Yahoo and IKEA combined as a kid in my 20s believe me known was more surprised than me

[00:15] And so I'm going to show you how to make money so fast it feels illegal. The first way to make money so fast it feels

[00:22] illegal is to understand value creation. I want to tell you a story. I sent my father a picture of our

[00:29] largest annual event that we held in our company which licensed the gym owners. We had a room of 700

[00:34] plus people and he said, oh that's awesome that so many people how much did they pay to be there and I said

[00:41] 42,000 dollars a year and he said, oh my god, he said, do they know that they're paying that much?

[00:46] I was like, yeah, they're aware. It's not like a magically siphoning money from their accounts and

[00:52] there was like, okay, now rather than respond and be like really mean about it. I was like, well,

[00:58] let's walk through this. I said, if you were able to pay a dollar and get five dollars back,

[01:05] would you do it? And he's like, well, it would depend. I said it would depend on what. He said, well,

[01:09] what's the what's the likelihood that the five to one actually happens? I said, that's just the average.

[01:15] So some people are below average and people are above average. He's like, okay, that feels like a fair

[01:18] bet. Well, what would I need to do? I was like great question. You'd have to dedicate probably

[01:24] 10 plus hours a week to fully kind of implementing a new model within your business. He was like,

[01:30] okay, how long would it take between when I started when I got those types of results?

[01:34] And I said, about a year is like, okay, well, then yeah, I think I would do it. And so that thought

[01:42] process was kind of the first big unlock to making so much money that it should feel illegal,

[01:48] which is that you can't sell out of your wallet. You have to sell off of the value that

[01:54] you're creating for someone else. We were able to charge significantly more and profit significantly

[01:58] more than everybody else in my space. And so everyone else in my space was charging literally

[02:04] a tenth of what I was able to charge or I prefer to say, command from the marketplace. And the

[02:11] reason that was able to happen was because I used something called the value equation. All right,

[02:14] so the value equation has four components. And I'm not going to go super deep on it, but I'll just

[02:18] walk you through it real quick. So you've got the dream outcome, which is what's the big thing

[02:23] that people want. So in this instance, it'd be they want to make more money in their gym,

[02:27] they might want to lose weight, they might want to have a fixed their relationship, they might want

[02:30] to look cool in front of their friends, whatever. The next is the perceived likely to achievement

[02:35] or the equal opposite that is risk. How likely is it that when I buy this thing, I get what I want,

[02:40] which when he asked the question, well, how likely is it this is what he's teasing out?

[02:45] The next question is time. How long is it going to take between when I start and when I get?

[02:52] And the longer that is, the less viable the thing is. And then you have effort in sacrifice,

[02:58] which is how hard am I going to have to try? What am I going to have to start doing that I don't

[03:02] want to do? Or stop doing that. I do what I do. To be clear, the reason that I made this value

[03:07] equation is because for so long many people and you probably heard them in concert, like provide

[03:11] value, you create value. But I was like, what does this even mean? How does one create value?

[03:16] And so I set out to try and figure out what makes me want to buy stuff. And so in a hypothetical

[03:20] example, you'd want something that would be immediate. It would be no effort. It would be guaranteed

[03:25] and it would be exactly what they want the way they want it. That would be the most valuable version

[03:30] of whatever you could sell. And then you would say, let's say that our averages, 100,000 dollars

[03:35] of value. All right, now in a B2B setting, it might literally be that because it's a monetary

[03:39] outcome. And if it's a B2C setting, son of consumers, then we have to abstract the value of what

[03:44] fitting back into your high school dreams is worth to you or looking good on prom night or just feeling

[03:49] good every single day, whatever. But we have this ROI. And then we have some sort of discount

[03:56] that we're going to apply to it, which accommodates risk. Right. One is it's in the future. I would

[04:02] pay less for something that is guaranteed and immediate. Then not guaranteed and at a delay. So let's

[04:08] say I sell tables, right? This is a retail product. And you would immediately think, oh, this is probably

[04:13] highly commoditized. Well, I'm not so sure. Think about it. On the lowest end, you can buy a

[04:18] fold out plastic table from lows or home depot for probably 50 or 100 bucks. I haven't checked

[04:25] plastic table pricing recently. On the flip side, you can buy a $20,000 hand carved wood table,

[04:32] both of them allow you to put stuff on top of it and eat. Right. And so the idea is how can we position

[04:39] our thing separately from other people? Now, if the dream outcome for that table is not,

[04:44] okay, I actually need to have something that I could put stuff on top of, the dream outcome might be

[04:48] when people walk into my home, they feel immediately impressed. So now we're actually relating this

[04:52] to status. So this is a business because B2B is actually pretty easy. It's just this is how much money

[04:56] it is. And then the rest of your time is trying to make it easier for them less risky and faster.

[05:02] Business can see where sometimes you need to spend a little bit more time on translating

[05:05] what this status increase might mean for them and how meaningful that is. Or the reverse how

[05:10] terrible and painful it's been to lack this status. Right. And so if we have this big expensive

[05:15] nice table, then we say, okay, here's the status. Now the risk of this not happening, this is where

[05:20] we might show trends of this being a hot thing that many people understand the value of. So the risk

[05:24] of them not getting the status is lowered. The time is like, hey, I can have this at your house

[05:29] by the end of today. That would be someone like, wow, this could happen right in time for this

[05:33] dinner party, I have my boss, this is coming in my house. And then effort and sacrifice is don't worry,

[05:37] we have a white glove service that will make sure that we can fit it into your doorways even

[05:40] those this massive thing and we will assemble it there for you. You just need to say yes right now

[05:45] and it will be there by the end of the night and you can have dinner on it when you have your guests

[05:49] tomorrow. Right. Now we've tied them buying to all of the value components to getting them to then

[05:54] be willing to spend $20,000 because it's not about the wood, it's not about the table. It's about

[06:00] how much status is worth them within this context and they get to keep it forever. Right. And so this is

[06:05] how we have to unpack what we're selling so that many of you are selling tables and pricing like

[06:11] it's a plastic table but you're then trying to have to do the work but then you can make the

[06:14] margins work at the white glove because people say, oh, I will only want to pay $100. I would

[06:18] deliver it and they're like, oh, I have to assemble this too. And all of a sudden they're they're

[06:22] combating you when if you just had charged more in position differently, you could then give them

[06:27] all these other things that they want anyway. And the reason it's so important is that prices

[06:30] the single largest level on profit. So let's say we've got a before, which is that you sell your

[06:36] tables. All right. And you've got an after. This obviously works for services or whatever else

[06:40] you sell. All right. And so let's say you charge $100 for your table and you're cost for that table

[06:46] is I'll be extremely here. We'll say it's $50. Okay. Now let's say that you have other costs like

[06:53] marketing and sales and other stuff like that that amounts to $30. All right. So that means that

[06:58] your net profits are going to be 20 bucks when you sell a table. Gross profit is 50 net profits

[07:03] 20. Okay. Now let's say that we reposition our table as this amazingly valuable thing that is

[07:10] now a thousand dollar table. Okay. Now our cost on this the table itself might be 50. But let's say we

[07:16] include some of those perks. Let's say we've got the hand delivery and things like that. Okay.

[07:20] Well, let's say that the delivery is going to be another $200 for one of your guys to go out there

[07:25] and use the truck gas whatever. So now we've got $250 here. Okay. Got it. And then the other costs

[07:31] maybe maybe your cost of sales goes up a little bit to sell this. You got to get more leads. Okay.

[07:36] So we'll call it 130. All right. So now what are we actually making in net profit for this table?

[07:41] So we've got 3, 3, 80. Okay. I wish I had done an easier math. But I think it's 620 here. All right.

[07:47] So 620 dollars in profit. And so this is how you can get unreasonably wealthy in a very short period

[07:54] of time by simply repositioning what you sell based on the value, provide someone else rather than the

[07:59] cost that it costs you. And so to put this in context, this is a 31x increase in profit. And so I'll

[08:08] tell you this quick story. There was a guy that was in the same exact spaces me that paid me for

[08:12] consulting day years ago. And when I looked at his numbers, what was fascinating was that he was

[08:16] actually selling the same amount of people from month as I was. And so he was spending the same

[08:20] amount of marketing. He was had the same number of sales guys and he was closing roughly the same

[08:24] amount as we were. And so what was interesting about this, and this was a massive lesson that I learned,

[08:29] is that CAC or the cost of getting a new customer in an industry, as long as you're proficient at

[08:34] marketing, more or less is actually not that different. There'd be surprise. I look at his

[08:38] million companies every year. And between industries like a local plumber and another local plumber,

[08:43] it's not going to be that different. And so the big difference though, is that we were able to make

[08:49] some more in the neighborhood of about eight times more money per customer than this guy was.

[08:54] But here's the crazy part. We were making some when they were at a 50 times more profit. And it's

[08:59] because of this. So we had eight times more money, but then it resulted in, so remember this is just

[09:04] this is a 10x, right? So this is a 10x increase in price, but it resulted in a 31x increase in profit.

[09:10] And so this is why price is such a strong lever on how much you make. Now where it gets competitive,

[09:15] is if somebody else can do something just like you and do it for less. But there was a, I think

[09:21] of McKinsey survey where they looked at a number of companies and 85% of them competed on price,

[09:28] and only 13% of them won on price. So it's literally the worst possible strategy you can have,

[09:34] because there's only one person who wins lowest price. Dan Kennedy said this famously,

[09:38] there's no reward you get for being the second cheapest competitor. You just lose a lot of money,

[09:44] right? And so there is however, a benefit to being the most expensive person. And that's going to be

[09:50] a direct correlation to the amount of value that you can provide any individual person. And so again,

[09:56] it's about thinking, how much is this worth? And then can I deliver it to them? And can I eliminate

[10:02] the risk, make it faster, and make it easier for them so that I can get less discount on the

[10:07] value that I think it can provide that person. Now the two-al-one version of this is selling out of

[10:12] their future wallet, not today's wallet. And then the ways that we pull apart that value. So let's

[10:19] say it's a hundred thousand dollars of value. There's going to be a discount that's going to be

[10:23] applied to that hundred thousand dollars based on how likely it is, which is the risk. It's going

[10:27] to be based on how long it's going to take, which is the time. It's going to be how easy it is,

[10:32] how much work they're going to have to put in. And then fundamentally the dream outcome,

[10:36] which if they want to make money, that wins clear. Now if you have a beat of see business,

[10:40] business consumer business, then you have to translate what, looking amazing on prom night,

[10:45] means to someone fight edge like, or how much pain they've been in for not having the specific

[10:50] solution in their life. And so if I buy stuff and it gets to me faster, I'm willing to pay more for it.

[10:55] If someone, I buy stuff and they guarantee you to make it risk-free or they show me tons of proof,

[10:59] I'm more likely to pay for it and pay more for it. If someone says, oh, you don't have to do anything

[11:04] versus you have a ton of work associated with it, I'm more willing to pay for it. And then the

[11:08] dream outcome is just making sure that I actually want this thing versus something else. And so this

[11:12] actually operationalizes what we can do as business owners, how do we make it faster, how do we make it

[11:15] easier, how do we make it risk-free and deliver it the way they want it. So that was the first of the

[11:20] three, I'm going to believe that I had to break in order to make crazy money in my 20s. The second

[11:25] way to make money so fast, it feels illegal is to sell in a fast cash conversion cycle. If you don't

[11:31] know that is, I'll explain it right now. This is what allowed me to have a thousand dollars in my bank

[11:36] in December of 2016. I'd have thousand bucks in my bank account after losing everything for this

[11:43] second time. Actually, that was the first time I lost everything. And then I lost everything again,

[11:47] I think three months later. So just figuratively imagine I didn't have a lot of money.

[11:51] Now, 10 months later, I was able to put in ten million dollars in sales and bake, I think,

[11:57] something probably close to six million in profit. All right, now, here's the crazy part.

[12:01] Is that how can you get this to equate to ten million dollars in such a short period of time?

[12:09] Well, the first thing is we got a hundred to one return on our advertising. And so every dollar

[12:15] that I put in, so I put a thousand dollars in ads, it made a hundred thousand dollars. And then I put

[12:19] that hundred thousand dollars in the ads and I made ten million. And that is fundamentally what happened.

[12:25] And so the constraint of the business no longer was acquisition, but the reason that was not

[12:30] the constraint, meaning it wasn't the thing that blocked me from growing was that we had

[12:34] figured out something that I call client finance acquisition, which is just a fancy way of saying,

[12:38] using your customers money as a loan to get more customers. So let me explain. So if someone

[12:44] walks into your business right today, and let's say it cost you a hundred dollars in marketing

[12:48] to get them to buy something for me. All right, just keep it really simple. So cost me a hundred

[12:52] dollars to get this guy. Now, let's say that my thing costs a hundred dollars. Okay, now you think,

[12:58] oh, I broke even. But that thing, just like the table, is not going to be a hundred percent margin,

[13:02] not likely. And so if it's like the table, then I only make plus fifty on this, but I'm minus a hundred,

[13:08] because I had to pay this hundred to get them in the door. So I'm actually negative 50 right now

[13:13] for my first transaction. Now should I do this transaction? Unless I have something else to sell,

[13:19] not really, because it means I'm spending a hundred to make 50 bad deal. Now, if this person's

[13:23] going to spend three or four more times other than that time every month, then yeah, it's a good idea.

[13:27] But it's still going to take me time, and I'm still going to lose money up front. Now for me to do

[13:31] this whole thing, I got to do it a different way. And so this kind of enters the new way of doing things,

[13:36] which is I would acquire the customer for a hundred dollars, same guy, right? Now I'm smaller for

[13:41] whatever reason. And this time I say, okay, how can I get this guy to not only pay for himself?

[13:49] That's point one. That's breaking even getting customers. But point two is I need to get him to be

[13:54] able to buy me my next customer. And so if I know my cash trust was also going to be a hundred

[13:58] dollars, then it means I want him to pay himself back. So I need a hundred. All right, then I need my next

[14:03] customer. So I need another hundred. And then I need to make sure I get my my cost of my table back,

[14:08] which is 50. All right. So I need to make $250 on this transaction for me to then be able to

[14:17] use this dollars to then go get my next customer. And then I repeat this process

[14:25] over and over and over again. And then that results in this mess of amount of money. Because if you had a machine

[14:33] that for every dollar you put into it, you got a hundred dollars back out. What would your marketing

[14:38] budget be? It would be everything you had. And so here's the crazy part. Is that this, these types of

[14:43] returns pretty much only exist in businesses? Like this type of arbitrage, which is why if you look

[14:49] at the wealthiest people in the world, they own assets, they own businesses that generate cash flow,

[14:55] because the most significant arbitrage that exists is what it costs to get somebody to buy something

[15:01] from you. And if you have a well designed business, how much you can make from that person. And so

[15:06] think about this as every business is a little mini investing machine. And so you pay extra

[15:11] to get customers, you get $y back. And then instead of waiting a year for 10% improvements on the

[15:16] S&P 500, you can wait one day and get a hundred dollars back. And so why would you invest in

[15:22] anything else? Well, the richest people in the world don't. They're highly concentrated in the

[15:26] businesses and industries that they understand well. And so this concept of finance acquisition was

[15:32] the big unlock that I had. And I have in four times of my life have I gone through what I would

[15:37] consider a wealth work, right? A material change in my net worth and a very short period of time.

[15:42] And most of the money that I've made has been in short periods of time and then followed by kind of

[15:47] like level sets for a while, then I figured out something else and they're going to huge step up

[15:51] in income. So if you're like, man, we've been stuck for a while, you're usually just this far away

[15:56] from figure out what that constraint is. Now, it could have been capital. So for me, I didn't have

[16:00] any money. And so this solved my capital constraint. Now, what it did not solve, it didn't solve my

[16:04] people constraint. It didn't solve my hiring, it didn't solve, it didn't solve, it you know,

[16:09] key man worth. I didn't solve any of those problems. But in giving enough cash to be able to

[16:13] solve those problems in the future. So let me put this in perspective for you. My weight loss business

[16:18] which was my actual gyms, which are called unite-fitness, all right, unite-fitness,

[16:24] I was able to open up a new location every six months off of the cash flow. No money out of pocket

[16:29] using this exact same process. And so I would put $5,000 down, I would sign a lease, I would begin

[16:36] spending money on advertising like a hundred dollars a day. And for every hundred dollars that I would

[16:40] spend, I would get somewhere in the neighborhood of $2500 to $3,000 back immediately. And so in the first

[16:46] week, I would then order the equipment. In the next week, I would order the floor. In the next week,

[16:50] I would set up the lobbying and get the painting done. And by the fourth week, I'd made around

[16:54] $100,000, which is roughly what it cost to open the business and give me six weeks of payroll.

[17:00] So that by the end of the promotion that I was selling, which was a six week challenge at the time,

[17:04] I would have something in the neighborhood of $20 or $30,000 of recurring revenue at that gym.

[17:08] But it cost me almost no money out of pocket because I let my customers pay for my gym for me.

[17:13] I would say I will spend $5 lead, who's one out of five leads, on a $500 thing. And so I would pay

[17:19] $25 to get a customer and make $500 back. And then I would take the rest of that to go get another $25,

[17:25] spend another $25 to get another customer to get another $500. And then that's how I was able to

[17:28] finance the growth of the gyms. And that's how I had 23 years old and then 24 and then 25,

[17:33] those who were with six locations. And again, the constraint was no longer cash. It was trainers,

[17:38] it was managers, it was salespeople, that's what limited my growth. This was the first time I

[17:42] discovered this concept. And then I was like, oh man, I should do this again. And so then I started

[17:47] gymlaunch one point, no, which is where I flew out from location to location. And I would make

[17:53] a $100,000 at the gym. But then I didn't have to pay for the build out. And I didn't have to manage

[17:57] the gym afterwards. So I could just take a $100,000, it was just me with a little fold out table,

[18:01] probably $100 from lows. And then it's a stack of contracts. And I have videos of me going through

[18:07] just random places and selling all day every day for 21 day straight. And then eventually I taught

[18:12] that system to other people. But the average amount that I'd spend in advertising in those markets

[18:16] was somewhere they ever like $1 to $5,000. And I would make upwards of $100,000 in that first month.

[18:23] And so this is what allowed me to go from again, zero to doing 32 plus launches in like 18ish months.

[18:30] Now, the third time that this wealth alchemy occurred for me was when gymlaunch transitioned to licensing.

[18:35] Now, in the licensing business, this is when things got even wilder because I had fewer operational

[18:40] constraints to scale. And so here I had to keep scaling more and more sales guys because I had to

[18:45] fly them out, which is actually a tough value proposition for them. They apparently had wife and

[18:48] kids that wanted to see them. Go figure. And so when I switched the licensing, which was just showing

[18:52] people how I was filling these gyms, that's where we went from the zero to $10 million in sales in

[18:58] 10 months. All right, that's what's that's almost crazy. I might pin it. Then the second, the second

[19:04] full year of business we did. We did around 16 million in EBITDA. All right, that means profit.

[19:10] All right, and we did 26 million top line in revenue. And again, this is coming from somebody who had

[19:17] then lost it off because I have made some bad bets in my life. And you're like, okay, well, it must

[19:21] have only been a fluke that side. Well, the next business I started with prestige labs, which is our

[19:25] supplement company went from zero to 1.7 million per month. This was at the launch. This was month one.

[19:32] All right, and then I had Allen, which Allen went from zero to 1.7 million per month, weirdly that

[19:38] it was the same number in six months. So these types of numbers only can occur when you remove

[19:44] capital or money as a way of scaling as a thing that blocks you. If you had unlimited money,

[19:49] which if you set up the way that you car customers correctly, you can't. If you think this video

[19:54] helped you make more money or it helped someone else make more money, it would be in the world to me,

[19:58] if you shared it as a DM or send it to them as a text that they could watch it and get the benefits

[20:03] to and associate those benefits with you. So what you really want that math to work out to is that

[20:09] you want two times cack plus cugs to equal 30 day cash collected, all right, which is basically gross

[20:24] profit. So you're like, okay, that sounds like a really complex equation. I'll say it in plain English.

[20:31] You want to make two times as much as a cost you to get a customer and deliver it on that customer

[20:36] within 30 days based on the amount of cash that you generate from them in access of the cogs,

[20:42] right. And so if we have, let's say $100 member to get the customer and then $50 of cogs,

[20:48] right, then we want to make sure that we can have $300, actually, to the math program before this is

[20:52] why equations are useful, right? We want to make sure we make $300 on that first customer. So that

[20:58] in the first 30 days and you're like, why is he thinking about 30 days? The reason I'm so obsessive

[21:03] about 30 days is because that is the amount of time that anybody can get interest rate free cash.

[21:08] And so everybody has access to a credit card and it doesn't matter what your limit is, even if it's

[21:12] a $500 limit that you start out with, which is typically what those start most people want,

[21:16] a $500 limit, guess what you can do, you paid off tomorrow. And so if you can get it within that

[21:20] period of time, you'll only be limited by that card. Now if you can do it in seven days, then you can

[21:23] repeat the cycles four times in a month. If you can do it every day, then you repeat it 30 times

[21:28] in a month. Right? And so very quickly, based on your speed of collecting the cash back,

[21:32] which is called the cash conversion cycle, you can accelerate your growth. I honestly think the

[21:38] reason that most businesses don't do this is because they believe a narrative that because

[21:41] other people in the industry don't do it, they can't. And I think that that belief keeps many

[21:47] business owners poor. The amount of businesses that we've gone into and been like, okay, well,

[21:53] let's just get people to prepay three months at a time. They're like, no, it's industry standard

[21:57] to do services and then collect and net net 60. And I'm like, yeah, well, that's their standard.

[22:02] We don't have to do that. Well, why don't we just give them incentive to pay? And they're like,

[22:06] wow, well, what if what? I'm like, what if what? What if they say no? Well, they say they're saying

[22:10] no today, sometimes too. Well, as well, like, collect more when we do it. And then we say, hey,

[22:14] we happen to build quarterly. And with that convenience, we also give you a 5% discount, which

[22:19] we've of course we've baked in the price anyways. Right? Or we add some sort of onboarding process

[22:23] that normally people might charge separately for or that we add in so that we can collect more

[22:27] cash upfront. And I'm willing to give a significant amount of things up front so that I don't have

[22:33] my cost of getting customers as anything that gets in the way of me growing a business. I never

[22:38] want my ability to get customers or money to get them to be the thing that limits my growth. And I

[22:42] think that's the reason that all these businesses that I just explained went from zero to million

[22:46] plus per month within a year. And I'm saying within a year as a soft tip, most of them within six months.

[22:52] If you want to make more money, ask to get paid sooner. So think about this. So if you if you are

[22:58] a minimum wage employee, right, then you do work and then you get paid afterwards at a delay.

[23:04] Right? Now, if you're a contractor, sometimes you can do work and get paid, but usually you get paid

[23:11] and then you do work. If you're a surgeon, you get paid and then months pass and then you do the surgery.

[23:17] If you're an insurance company, you get paid and then you may not have to ever work at all.

[23:22] And if you're the church, you get paid off of someone's income. They're top-line a royalty

[23:28] that goes straight to the church. Now, royalties happen the same way leans do. So if you, if someone

[23:33] owes you money, you can take a lean off the top, you skim off the top. And so basically,

[23:38] your position in what's called the capital stack is predicated on your leverage in the situation.

[23:43] And so if it's up to you, you might as well choose to get paid sooner. Now, you might be looking

[23:49] at this and thinking, yeah, but how do I get all of that cash up front? How do I get people to

[23:54] actually spend more money with me faster? Well, it comes down to one, you can either raise the price

[24:00] of your thing, or two, you get people to buy more stuff immediately. And so one of the big

[24:05] misconception business owners have is that they're afraid of making offers. And so I want to be very

[24:09] clear. You don't want to try and force someone to do something. People don't like to be sold,

[24:13] but they do love buying. Right? I mean, think about which money it was I make. People love buying.

[24:17] And so what we want to do is make offers when it's convenient for them to take them. And so

[24:22] offer only doesn't work if it's something that they don't want or you presented at the wrong time.

[24:26] Or, you know, advanced version three, it's not being delivered in the way they want it to be

[24:30] delivered. All right. And I'll tell you a quick story about that. So when I was in the in the

[24:34] way loss business, we discovered that there were some customers that would come in and they didn't

[24:38] want to buy gym services. And I was like, okay, well, that's lame. But I then figured out, hey,

[24:43] why don't I invite them to nutrition seminar? And so we invite them to nutrition seminar, even though

[24:48] they said, no, to our services, they don't know what crazy they come in for gym members. We tried

[24:51] to all of them. They say, no, I say, hey, can I just help you with your food and they say, sure,

[24:54] then they go to the nutrition seminar. And they buy more than the people who bought gym services on

[24:59] average. It sounds like, oh, we just needed to make them a different offer to solve the same problem.

[25:06] So they wanted to lose weight still. They just didn't feel like sweating. They wanted to take

[25:10] supplements and eat differently. Fun. So learning to make multiple offers to a customer is not

[25:16] only beneficial for them because you help them solve the problem in more ways. It's also beneficial

[25:20] for you because you get more cash upfront. And so thinking through, how do I get someone to buy because

[25:25] there's something that people enter called a hyperbying cycle. So if someone makes any kind of

[25:30] new decision, especially if it's like, okay, I'm now somebody's going to start taking care of their

[25:33] loan. And I just bought this new car. Hey, I'm going to run a marathon. There's these little

[25:37] cycles that people enter. There's these buying windows. And what a traditional business owner would say,

[25:43] let's say somebody runs a marathon. They they they sign up for the marathon and then they go to the

[25:47] running store. When they go to the running store, they have to buy some shoes. Now the store owner says,

[25:51] oh, I don't want to offer them, you know, fancy socks or an iPod wristband or new tank tops. I don't

[25:57] want to I don't want to seem like I'm being pushy. But what are they going to do? They're still going to

[26:00] go buy that stuff because they have to get the whole thing. And so there's this natural problem

[26:05] solution cycle that continues over and over and over again, within every customer's purchases provided,

[26:12] the first problem is solved with the first purchase. And then that then opens up the next problem.

[26:18] So once you have your shoes, what else do you need? You're going to need socks. Once you have socks,

[26:22] what else do you need? You're going to need shorts. Once you have shorts, what else do you need?

[26:25] You need tank top. The desert, you know, rub on your on your under arms. You're also going to need an

[26:29] iPod carrier. All of these different things. You're also going to want the number thing. You're

[26:33] might want a coach. You might want an app. You might want a hydration thing. Like there's there's

[26:36] supplements. There's all these different things that stem from this. And everyone's afraid to ask.

[26:41] So just mix the offer available. And if they choose not, no worries. If you're like if you go buy

[26:46] something and then thank you page says, hey, would you want this too? If you're offended by that,

[26:51] well, the business doesn't really care. Yeah, so put it that way. Because other people won't be

[26:55] a bit of bite and will be happy that you made it available and more convenient for them.

[26:58] So I'll tell you you're providing more value and you're getting rewarded for it. Yeah. And

[27:02] at each one of these upsels that you might want to include, you still think through each of the

[27:06] value equation components. So you still think, what's the dream outcome they ultimately want? How

[27:10] do I make it risk-free for them? How do I do it faster? How do I make it easy? So number one,

[27:14] we're charging as much as we possibly can because we're doing it based on value, not based on cost.

[27:19] The second thing we're doing is we're structuring our economics of the business, how we upsell

[27:23] how we downsell. So we can generate more cash in the first 30 days so that we can get enough

[27:26] to pay for this customer and the next customer and delivering for both of them in that same time

[27:30] period so that cash and getting customers is not limited to the business. And the third way to make

[27:35] money so fast it feels illegal is to understand wealth, alchemy and ignore taxes or kind of just

[27:42] play the game the right way. So let me walk you through an example. So let's say that you give away

[27:46] free trials of your thing. Okay? Cool. Make sense? We give away free trials. And let's say a free trial

[27:52] of your thing cost $100 to get someone to start. Fine. Now let's also for simple math, say the

[27:58] trial is $100 per month. Our will keep this really simple. All right, that's the price. That's our

[28:03] free trial after the good version. Okay. Now let's say that we get one out of three people who start

[28:11] a free trial to become a customer. Okay? That means that it's going to cost us $300, right? This

[28:19] times three to get a customer. Okay. Now let's say that we know one out of three customers

[28:25] becomes a permanent customer. Meaning once they get on our subscription they never leave.

[28:32] Which would mean that our permanent cash is somewhere close to $900. Okay. Now if our price here

[28:38] is $100 a month then that means that the annual revenue, annual current revenue is $1,200 per year.

[28:48] Okay. So we pay $900 to make $1,200 per year. Well if you had a stock that you could buy for $900

[28:54] and then it and then it sent you back $1,200 within 12 months you probably would like that's a great

[28:59] investment. Now if it kept doing that you'd be like it's unbelievable investment. But let me show

[29:03] you how much more wild this can really get. Now let's say that we have this, let's just say this is a

[29:08] software company. All right. So if it's a software company let's say that it trades at 10 times top line

[29:13] which is fairly typical for like a B2B SaaS business as long as you have good retention metrics

[29:17] which is why this is so important permanent cash, permanent customer. So if we know that then it means

[29:23] that we're actually making $12,000 in enterprise value which just means how valuable the business is

[29:29] that can create this kind of money. Now here's where it gets even history here is that this is tax

[29:38] free and so you get paid this money but you also get this it's not either or it's ant and so when I

[29:46] figured this out I was like oh this is how people just make stupid money really fast and so let's

[29:56] let's work this out. Okay I want to make $120 million. Let's say that was my goal. Okay so $120 million

[30:05] I would have to how many 12,000 customers in terms of enterprise value what I need. Well let's go look

[30:12] all right so I need 10,000 customers of this of this $900 times 10,000 to get my $120 million enterprise value

[30:28] here. So let me ask you a question. Does 10,000 times 900 so you're telling me if I pay $9 million

[30:40] I can make this year an increase of 120 million in asset value tax free and ant

[30:51] make $12 million in revenue that I add for the 9 million and so walk through this in sequence with me.

[31:01] Yes, spend 9 million you get back 12 million dollars in annual revenue and that 12 million

[31:06] dollars of ant and revenue is worth 120 million that you paid zero taxes on it. That is the fucking

[31:13] game. This is the wealth alchemy. This is how it works. This is how these software companies that

[31:20] I put at $3 billion how in four years it goes from nothing, right, to a multi billion dollar thing.

[31:28] If you look at how much it cost them to get customers you're like like when I understood this I was like

[31:33] oh it's literally just a massive arbitrage between the permanent cost of a corner customers relative

[31:39] to the annual value relative to the enterprise value multiple and then those three things put together

[31:45] is what creates this massive discrepancy between what you put in and what you get out which because of

[31:51] my fancy fancy t-shirt here I will show you is the definition of leverage and so the reason that there are

[31:58] two symbols that are woven into the acquisition.com logo to supply and demand and a full crop for

[32:03] leverage is that you get more for what you put in and so if you have two businesses right so let's

[32:09] let's let's pay this out. Let's say we had a different business that we did the same thing but let's say

[32:14] that we actually these types of businesses whatever business it was treated on bottom line and so if the

[32:20] business was doing 12 million let's say that it's doing $3 million in profit whatever this new

[32:25] other businesses okay it's doing $3 million profit and let's say that we get a 7x multiple

[32:32] on this on this EBITDA which is fancy worth a profit which means that we have $21 million.

[32:39] Now if I pay $9 million for 21 million would I be down for that probably I mean it's still a

[32:45] two point something x is not bad but this is why picking a good opportunity vehicle because in

[32:51] both of these situations you still spent the $900 per customer you still make the $1200 per year

[32:56] but the big difference was how much is that $1200 per year worth yeah and so let's dive into this

[33:02] permanent customer concept for a second this concept took me so long to grasp as an entrepreneur

[33:08] what every business owner needs to focus on is how do I not lose customers and the reason for that is

[33:14] that let's compare to businesses all right so let's say you've got business A and business B okay

[33:24] so business A acquires 100 customers year one and loses 100 customers and the next year they double

[33:31] their acquisition they double their marketing and sales they acquire 200 customers and then year 3 they

[33:37] lose all 200 and then they they add another 50% acquisition they do 300 customers in year 3 okay

[33:43] so it's a 300 customer business now company B sells 100 first year now second year they do a

[33:50] hunt they keep their first hunter but they don't increase their marketing itself so now they have

[33:53] 100 or less you're plus 100 of this year and then the third year they have 100 from two years ago

[33:58] 100 from one year ago and then 100 this year both of these businesses A and B have 300 customers

[34:05] but which company would you rather own this one absolutely no question so why is that you want time

[34:12] to be on your side not your enemy because time is going to pass no matter what and you want a

[34:16] business where no matter what happens it just keeps growing so you can sell the same amount of customers

[34:22] you could even not sell customers and still make money and so this is a far less risky business

[34:28] and as a result of that if you recall the value equation from earlier and investor is value in a

[34:33] business fundamentally on the same things which is how likely is this to occur how much effort and

[34:38] sacrifices is going to take what is the time delay between now and when this becomes this ultimate thing

[34:43] right and so the same process is still done obviously it is slightly more complex scale but when we're

[34:49] thinking about permanent customers this company is turning customers into permanent customers company A

[34:55] is just a turn factory they sell something once and people don't like it and they leave which means

[34:59] the only way to grow this business is market in sell more but that is only a one way road at some point

[35:04] you sell through all the customers within a given base and so it would be who of us to spend more

[35:09] time just figuring out how to not lose people so that 10 years from now what like as we keep going

[35:15] because this this map would continue this guy is going to slow down right it being able to double

[35:19] marketing and sales every single year is tough but just keeping the customers you had for 10 years

[35:24] significantly easier but people don't focus on it because it's not a sexy but this is where the

[35:29] real leverage occurs and this is where that wealth alchemy that I was referencing earlier this is

[35:33] how you get stupid rid and so let me give you a real word example so Starbucks do you want to know

[35:39] what their LTV per customer is $14,000 that's how much they make per customer and that is why

[35:47] Starbucks makes so much money so you think about these like high ticket businesses and stuff that's all

[35:51] around B2B whatever they're making $14,000 per customer from like every and so what is it cost to get

[35:59] somebody to buy a cup of coffee I promise you significantly less than $14,000 and this relates back to

[36:04] my very first point that I was telling you where I had another company that was in the same space

[36:08] as me the cost to get a customer first Starbucks to get somebody to buy coffee is probably similar to

[36:12] a Dug and Dough and Dough

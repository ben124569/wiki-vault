[00:00] You have this big vision for your life that you want,

[00:02] and on this side, your family gets kidnapped,

[00:05] and if you don't do something, they will call them all.

[00:07] Which of those motivates you more right now in this video?

[00:10] When I was 15, 16, 17, I was a pretty angry kid.

[00:14] I thought that I had all these issues.

[00:16] I would tell people I have anger issues.

[00:18] I'm not a nice person.

[00:19] I would tell people those things

[00:21] because I believe those things to be true,

[00:23] and I saw them as problems.

[00:25] And then I went to college, and in college,

[00:27] it's all propaganda of people who are teaching,

[00:31] who've never actually done work in a real economy ever.

[00:34] They're all tenure, they don't live in reality.

[00:37] They tell everyone they should pursue their purpose,

[00:39] and their passion, and the things that he love,

[00:41] and I ate it up.

[00:43] It's a readily spoken post-ideal psychology.

[00:44] I watched all these TED talks,

[00:46] and the problem was I didn't make any progress,

[00:48] and I felt like there was something even more wrong with me,

[00:51] because I didn't feel any of that stuff.

[00:53] I wish I could go back and tell myself, dude,

[00:58] all the stuff they're saying is just not true.

[01:01] Like you don't need any of that.

[01:02] You can embrace the fact that you are angry,

[01:05] you can embrace the fact that you feel like you are in pain,

[01:08] and you can use that to make the life that you want.

[01:11] You don't have to use the lovey,

[01:13] dovy, purpose, passion to build the life that you want to build.

[01:16] What it does is it tells people

[01:18] that having a negative emotional experiences a bad thing,

[01:21] but half of your life is below average by definition,

[01:23] and so if you are not using the half of your life

[01:26] as energy or motivation to create the life you want,

[01:29] then you're at a huge disadvantage.

[01:31] They interviewed the top Olympic medalists,

[01:33] and they found that they don't actually love winning.

[01:36] They hate losing.

[01:37] When they win, they experience relief, not euphoria.

[01:40] If you look at Steve Jobs,

[01:42] he wasn't some happy go lucky dude who was like,

[01:45] man, I just want to make the world a better place.

[01:47] He was a tough dude to work for,

[01:49] but he created something beautiful from that pain.

[01:52] MJ, you look at Kobe.

[01:53] They had imaginary situations

[01:56] that they created in their minds

[01:57] to create more suffering in their own life,

[02:00] to motivate them and use this fuel.

[02:02] Imagine you have this big vision for your life

[02:04] that you want, and on this side,

[02:06] your family gets kidnapped,

[02:08] and if you don't do something, they will call them all.

[02:10] Which of those motivates you more right now in this video?

[02:13] Probably the one with your family getting kidnapped.

[02:16] It's not trying to harness a lovey, w feeling.

[02:19] It's harnessing pain.

[02:22] I felt like I had experienced more pain than I had good.

[02:25] I saw it as a disadvantage.

[02:27] I saw it as something that I had to overcome.

[02:29] I didn't have this big purpose.

[02:31] I didn't have this thing that I loved.

[02:32] I didn't have this thing I was passionate about.

[02:34] And if I could have just skipped all of that

[02:36] and started the moment, I accepted

[02:39] that it was okay to be angry.

[02:42] What wasn't okay was not doing anything about it.

[02:44] While I procrastinated by trying to find purpose,

[02:48] jumping from thing to thing to thing, trying to find

[02:50] the thing that really lit my fire.

[02:52] And just accepted that it was totally okay

[02:55] to work my face off in disgust

[02:58] from my current circumstance and who I was

[03:01] that I would have gotten to where I wanted to go much faster.

[03:04] So many people are believing a lie.

[03:06] They have to be happy.

[03:07] They have to have purpose, passion for what they're doing

[03:10] in order to get out of their situation.

[03:11] They think that they are poor

[03:13] because they don't have passion.

[03:14] That is false.

[03:16] You were poor because you're not doing the activities

[03:19] that make you rich.

[03:20] And you can fuel those activities

[03:22] with whatever way you damn well please.

[03:25] And so if you are somebody who is more motivated

[03:27] by the dark side, then lean into the dark side.

[03:29] Unlike the saying, the road to hell

[03:31] is paved with good intentions.

[03:32] The equal opposite of that is the road to heaven

[03:34] is paved with bad intentions.

[03:36] You can do good shit with bad motivation.

[03:39] And when I say bad, I mean negative experiences, pain, anger,

[03:41] et cetera.

[03:42] I still have tons of motivation from that side.

[03:44] You can use that negative fuel,

[03:46] pit it on speed dial.

[03:47] Every time you're confronted with that thing

[03:49] that you don't want to do, you push through it

[03:51] and what happens to you do that enough times,

[03:53] you start to get good at the thing.

[03:54] You start seeing the result of work that has compounded

[03:57] and start to see a purpose or start to see a bigger vision.

[04:01] The big vision for Alex's life until maybe four years ago

[04:04] was don't be broke.

[04:05] What was your mission with Jim on?

[04:06] My mission was to stop being poor.

[04:08] There are elements of shit that I do that I absolutely love.

[04:10] But there is tons of shit that I do every day

[04:12] that I fucking hate.

[04:13] I just don't hate it more than I hate the alternative.

[04:16] And the richest people in the world,

[04:18] they all say it's not about the money

[04:20] because if it's about the money,

[04:21] you stop the money, you have enough.

[04:23] The people with a wealthiest in the world

[04:25] have the three things in common.

[04:26] They have the big goal.

[04:27] They have massive fears about never being enough

[04:31] and then they have impulse control to stay on goal.

[04:33] And oftentimes that impulse control comes from

[04:35] right as you approach the guardrail,

[04:37] looking over the edge.

[04:38] And imagine you're going to be like

[04:39] to have your friends tell you that you were failure.

[04:40] Have them laugh behind your back or talk down about you

[04:43] or have your parents when they're introducing you

[04:46] as their fun-loving kid.

[04:47] You know, he's still figuring himself out.

[04:49] That is what would crush me.

[04:52] The boring shit that you have to do is not fun.

[04:55] Jeff Basu talks about overhead in business.

[04:57] There's tons of things that you have to do

[04:58] and be willing to do that you do not enjoy.

[05:00] The question is whether you do not enjoy them more

[05:02] than you do not enjoy the pain that you were going away from.

[05:05] As long as the pain of moving forward is less

[05:08] than the pain of going back

[05:10] and the pain that you imagine

[05:11] from not taking the action that you know should be taking,

[05:13] then you can use that energy

[05:15] as the single fuel that you can stay on path

[05:17] for an extended period of time.

[05:19] I'm writing my book right now.

[05:20] I'm on the 11th fucking draft.

[05:23] Like there is no feeling that makes me more sick

[05:26] than the idea that I could have done more.

[05:28] The pain of the idea of that book not doing well

[05:31] or that book leading to people being like,

[05:33] I don't think he tried his hard.

[05:35] That is the thing that hurts so much more

[05:37] than going from the top yet again

[05:40] to make another video, to make another article,

[05:42] to make another short, to make another fucking chapter

[05:45] revision yet again so that when I do launch it,

[05:47] I think to myself, I literally exhausted every option on this.

[05:51] One of the things that I live by

[05:52] is that I will not do my best, I will do what is required.

[05:56] And the difference between what your best is

[05:57] and what is required is the difference between

[05:59] what you think your real best is

[06:01] and what your actual best is.

[06:02] And what your actual best is is the thing

[06:04] that you would do to prevent everyone you know from dying.

[06:07] What people care about is the outcome,

[06:09] what you put out in the world.

[06:10] Now, why you do it, what fuels you,

[06:13] that's your business.

[06:14] And so if you are in one of these situations

[06:16] and you can't find that purpose,

[06:18] you can't find that passion cool,

[06:20] but it doesn't give you permission to not be successful.

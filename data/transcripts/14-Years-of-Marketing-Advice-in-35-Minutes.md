[00:00] I've been in business for 14 years. We spend tens of millions of dollars per year in paid advertising.

[00:05] And in this video, I'm going to share something I've never shared before,

[00:08] which is that I have 12 internal hacks that we use whenever we write any piece of

[00:13] advertising or copy that goes out to sell stuff. And I'm going to give you all of them.

[00:17] So let's start with the more headlines come first for a reason. And the reason I have it as the

[00:22] first one is that it is the first and most important. So to quote David Oglevi, once you've written

[00:27] your headline, you spent 80 cents of your advertising dollar. And so that means that the vast majority

[00:32] of people will only see the headlines in whatever it is that you make. It almost feels unfair

[00:38] that a headline is just a phrase or one word or one question. But it is also the thing that is

[00:44] ultimately, to get the most people to or have the biggest lever on whether your advertising is

[00:50] too well. So think about it like this because it's the law of small numbers, which is if you go from

[00:54] let's say a 1% click through rate to a 3% click through rate. You triple the amount of people who are

[01:01] also being to see everything else that you have. And so there's very little things that happen in the

[01:05] rest of the entire phone that have the ability to triple. Sometimes you get 20% lift, 50% lift,

[01:10] that be a monster split test. But a banger or killer headline can absolutely outperform the control

[01:17] by 23, sometimes 5x. Right? That is why at some point, and it feels unfair because it's so short,

[01:23] but the thing is is the best advertisers, the more they've been doing it, the more they have

[01:27] sess on the hook, they have sess on the headline because they know that's where the money's at.

[01:33] Right? Like if you have a winning hook for your ad campaigns, you keep using it to death and you

[01:38] try and beat it. And so here's the, here's some of the things that I write down, which is curiosity

[01:43] is king, different is ideal, and sexy works. And never run an ad without a headline because the

[01:48] thing is is all ads have headlines. There's just bad ones and good ones. Because if you don't

[01:53] write a headline, you do have a headline. It's just not very good. And so fundamentally, the headlines

[01:57] serve to give us a different wrapping paper for the same offers. And you want this headline to be

[02:02] so powerful, and I like this visual. It grabs the reader by the throat. Right? And so bonus

[02:08] points is how can I know that somebody's going to work ahead of time? One of the best ways to test

[02:12] headlines and hooks is to look at your organic content or other people's organic content or other

[02:17] people's ads. Look at the first three seconds, visually and verbally. What are they saying

[02:22] and what's happening in the background? And those are the first places that I'm going to look

[02:26] in order to model what headlines apply to me. Now, the really sexy hack around this is can I take

[02:33] can I steal like an artist from a different industry? Can I look at ads that are working well in the

[02:38] travel space and use them in business? Can I look at ads in the weight loss space and use them

[02:43] in business or whatever space you're in? And so some thoughts I have are curiosity quotes,

[02:49] questions, are there kind of emotional outcomes or experiences that I'm describing?

[02:52] One of my favorite headlines of all time is how to get without boo, even if you biggest and

[02:56] security. Right? I'll say that again. How to yay? Good thing without boo, bad thing, even if you

[03:02] biggest fear. How to speak confidently in front of strangers without ever practicing even if you're

[03:07] definitely afraid of speaking a public. FYI, they're an entire book written on each of these 12

[03:12] pieces that I'm going to talk about. I'm trying to give you the 80, 20 because at the end of the

[03:15] day when you're writing ads, you're not going to read 12 books before you write the ad. You have

[03:18] a little mental checklist that you go over and that's the checklist I'm giving you. Yeah. And so

[03:22] each of these bullets are kind of like the best like best converting nuggets that I have on each of

[03:26] these kind of mini topics. And so this is like my little cheat sheet. So whenever I get stuck right

[03:31] in a new idea or for a new image or a video or copy, this is what I used to kind of remind myself.

[03:36] Number two, say what only you can say. So if you've done something remarkable or different,

[03:43] you want to say it. Proof will always outdo promise. So the reason to very beginning this video,

[03:49] I said we spent tens of millions of dollars when it's last year between our portfolio companies.

[03:52] So this isn't like we don't have an agency. That's actually us spending money in our actual companies.

[03:58] So it's not like me taking credit for all the clients that I have. It's not that. It's like

[04:02] these are companies that I own that we spent money on to generate revenue. Right. So we risk real

[04:07] money behind these things. Now, if you're the only triple black belt in your local area, say so.

[04:13] If you're the only person who's helped moms over 35 who are vegan power lifters say so. If you're

[04:18] the only person who like the thing is that what you want to do is you want to be one of a kind.

[04:24] But the beauty is that you get to control what the pond that you're one of a kind is. And so

[04:30] friendly reminder here is that competitors can copy your offer, but they cannot copy your proof.

[04:37] That has to be earned. And so one of the big reasons, the big defenses that I believe exists for

[04:41] people who have done stuff, which is why you should do stuff, is that it doesn't matter how many

[04:46] AI avatars come out. The AI avatar can never have done something in the real world. They can lie.

[04:52] They can never have done something. And so no one can take your story or your experience is away from you.

[04:57] And this is one of the things that excites me about the future of AI. Is that story is still going to be

[05:02] paramount. Why should I listen to you is still going to be a question the top of everyone's mind?

[05:07] And in a world where trust is going to get diminished very rapidly, where we're not going to know

[05:10] what's real and what isn't verification of facts is going to be even more important. So say what

[05:16] only you can say. Number three, always call out who you're looking for. And bonus points who you're

[05:23] not looking for, which is actually even more powerful than the original call out. So because it's

[05:28] one thing to say, hey, I'm looking for business owners. But if you say, hey, if you're below $250,000

[05:34] a year, you're below $500,000 a year, you're below $5,000 a year, hey, this is in for you. Go consumer

[05:38] free content. It communicates very strongly where you position yourself in the marketplace. And so if you

[05:44] only want to help people who want to lose a lot of weight, not a little bit of weight, like there's a

[05:48] big advantage. You know, it's funny. I've actually never seen anyone in weight loss to this. But just say,

[05:52] like, hey, only for people who try to look lose over 30 pounds. Here's the grace bar. There's

[05:56] enough people who are trying to lose over 30 pounds, that you can say, no to the people who have

[06:00] less than 30 pounds to lose. Here's the other great thing about people who have over 30 pounds to

[06:04] lose is that you might only need a couple hundred customers in order to make your business work.

[06:07] And there's like a billion people, many billions, but maybe only a billion is a bit your language.

[06:12] Doesn't matter. Point is, is that most people are afraid of saying no to customers, but when you

[06:16] say no to customers, you polarize the customers who are the right customer to move even more towards

[06:21] you. We, you don't want to be is vanilla. If you say I'm everything to all people, I accept all

[06:26] customers, then it means no one feels pulled to your marketing because they're never going to think,

[06:30] oh, this is for me. That is the result that we want to have happen from our advertising that someone's

[06:36] self-selects, they race their hand, they're like, wow, feel like this person's talking to me. And so

[06:39] when you advertise, you never advertise to the masses. You advertise to one person. And so you want to be

[06:45] very clear when you're writing your copy, who is that one person? I want to identify the reader,

[06:50] I want to identify the viewer or the listener. And you want them to think, how does you know my

[06:54] secrets? We could only be that specific if you're talking about one person. And so as you go through

[06:59] this, you can go through different levels of awareness, which is like at the top level, someone can

[07:03] be completely unaware. So you have to hook them with curiosity. At a level underneath of that,

[07:07] you have to have someone who might be problem aware. Hey, do you get up at night to pee more than

[07:10] two times? Hey, have you read someone cancel a contract before it comes due? Right? These are

[07:14] problem aware. Then you have solution aware, which is like, have you ever tried to collect using

[07:17] some of these softwares? And it hasn't worked away with supposed to? Have you ever tried

[07:21] a supplement and hasn't gotten the results that you want? That's solution aware. Right? Underneath of

[07:25] that, you've product aware. Okay. Have you ever tried this type of creatine versus this type? Have you

[07:30] ever tried an ad agency before that's done meta ads? Right. These are very, very more aware

[07:35] customers. And finally, the most aware customers are people who already know about you and about your

[07:39] product. And then you have to make offers to those people. But it all all the way through the stack,

[07:44] we want to talk to people as though we know who they are because you probably do. And the crazy

[07:49] thing is that customers, this is the crazy barbar customers. We all, you want to lean into the fact that

[07:53] everyone is selfish. Everyone thinks they're the center of their own universe. And when you can say

[07:57] something that actually affects many, many people, but you can say it as though they think that they're

[08:02] alone in the universe, when you are specific, that is what creates compelling copy, specificity.

[08:08] And so if I say, hey, are you overweight? That's, that's right marketing. You don't want to use

[08:13] terms, like marketing ease, like marketing speak, marketing lingo, right? You've read ad copy before

[08:21] them and like, oh, this is ad copy. The way that you get out of that is by taking words that

[08:25] people use and breaking them down into chunks. And so by saying, hey, instead of saying, are you

[08:31] overweight? Do you have trouble getting upstairs or going on a walk for a long period of time

[08:36] without a rash forming between your legs and sweating in places you didn't know you could?

[08:41] When you say that, that's much more specific. And so what we want to think about is, what are the

[08:45] moments that some was going to experience thatness? What are the moments that some was going to experience?

[08:50] Brokenness? What are the moments that some was going to experience frustration in their marriage

[08:53] or their friendship or loneliness? Like, we talk about the moments because the moments is what they

[08:58] remember, no one remembers the vague words. And that's not what gets into e-mote or have an

[09:02] emotion and then ultimately lowers the actions for the actual so they take the next step.

[09:06] And so for example, I just had a cash guy's episode with a gentleman who does bar consulting,

[09:11] so he helps bars become more profitable, like restaurant bars. And so when I looked at the copy,

[09:17] it looked generic. It looked like he was just using marketing lingo rather than saying, hey,

[09:21] when you look behind the bars, it's like a bomb went off, right? Does it look like this is a

[09:24] homeless shelter behind your bar? Right? The thing is, is that you probably get a laugh, but the

[09:28] person's probably like, yeah, my bar looks like that's a mess. Right? And the thing is, is that that's

[09:32] a moment when they walk in or they look behind the counter and they're like, what happened? That's

[09:36] the moment we want to pinpoint because they probably had that happen the last seven days. And if that

[09:40] pain is fresh, the likely that they then take the next action is high. So the next one is number four,

[09:47] always have a reason why. And this is big. So I like to use the the Fritsurney party planer

[09:54] perspective, which is that it doesn't actually matter what reason you use, but more so that you

[09:58] have a reason to begin with. And so this the first thing I want to start adding this in was,

[10:04] I think I read one of key all the easy things ages ago, we talked about how when people were

[10:09] cutting other people in line, if they had a good reason, people were more likely to let them

[10:13] cut in, which is basically a persuasion win. They say, hey, can I get in line in front of you?

[10:17] And just like, hey, I've got this paper I've got to turn in. I need to copy it quickly.

[10:20] It's what people said, yes, but later they tested it where they just said, hey, I have to get in

[10:24] line because my cat is back home. It has nothing to do with getting in line or needing urgency

[10:29] around the copy. They just basically said because insert random reason, but having a reason in general

[10:34] for most people makes it better than no reason at all. And so the word because is one of

[10:40] the most influential words in the English language use it because it works. And so if you are going

[10:45] to use a reason, great. Now you get bonus points for a reason, if you can tie back to urgency

[10:50] or scarcity in some way, which I'll talk about those two in more depth later. And so when you're

[10:55] giving your reasons why, what I encourage you to focus on is giving them the reason why to do the next step.

[11:01] And just that, right, every line of copy sells reading the next line of copy. And then those lines

[11:06] of copy sell the click. And then the click sells the and then the the blending page that

[11:11] after comes from the click, the headline of that page sells the opted from the optin itself,

[11:15] showing up to the next thing. It's that we just want to be very clear about our messaging one

[11:19] step at a time because someone can't take nine steps. We want to sell one step and be very

[11:23] clear about what we want to be doing next. Right. It confused mind does not buy and it confused

[11:28] mind certainly does not click. And so when I say thinking about this as a fraternity party planter

[11:33] is what reasons as a fraternity party planter need in order to plan a party. Not many at all. The

[11:38] bar for having a reason to party is quite low. Timmy got his wisdom teeth out. Kegger, you know,

[11:44] John Brugov with this girlfriend, Kegger, it's Tuesday. Let's drink. Right. And so the idea is that

[11:51] you don't actually have to have a reason that's good in your mind. You just need to have a reason

[11:56] in general. It could be your birthday. It could have been your birthday last month. It could be your

[11:59] wife birthday. It could be your jobs birthday. Right. It could be the anniversary of the business.

[12:02] There's four dates that you could run for a whole month. Right. It's my dad, my dog's birth month

[12:06] this month. And for that reason, we're running this offer. Right. It does not matter. Now, how do we

[12:12] make it even more compelling? And this one's nasty. This may be if I had a favorite, which is hard to

[12:17] say because it's like picking between your kids, which of course, everybody has a favorite job.

[12:22] Kidding, come down. Anyways, is damaging admissions. All right. There is probably, I mean, in my

[12:29] experience, nothing more powerful than imaging missions. Now, what's very interesting about this is

[12:34] they've done a research on basically the persuasiveness of somebody who admits their bias up front.

[12:40] So if you say, hey, I make money from these videos in the following ways. People even know they

[12:47] know that you admit you have a bias. They are now more likely to believe you because you said you

[12:53] have a bias because you've actually been truthful. And so you want to own your flaws and

[12:58] damaging admissions in my opinion are so powerful because they're actually just rooted in truth.

[13:03] So you want to always own your flaws. Of course you have them. Of course your product is in perfect.

[13:08] Say so. And what you'll sacrifice in promise, you'll gain in trust and trust,

[13:14] Trump's promise. Think about the promises that you have to give to referral. Very little. Why?

[13:19] Because you're borrowing the trust of the introduction of the person. So when you get a referral,

[13:23] you're like, yeah, you out my friend Sandy. So I'll buy. You don't need to promise much at all

[13:28] because they trust you. And so I would rather always sacrifice promise to gain trust. And so

[13:33] there's a, you know, the famous Eminem story of he figured out what he was wrapping that if he

[13:37] owned all of this flaws. And he said, I'm short. And I'm white. And I'm Bob of all of all right. He says

[13:42] all these things about them. The other person is nothing left to say. He pulls all the wind out of

[13:47] their sales. He pulls all the punches because he punches himself with that. And then they have nothing

[13:51] left. And so basically we would address all of the concerns they have up front in our damaging

[13:57] admissions. And so what happens is the, the, the linguistic power of this is that you have statement,

[14:03] but other statement. And the statement that comes after the word, but is the part that is the

[14:09] thing you want them to believe. And so you say something that is true and believable and damaging to

[14:15] you so that they can believe that thing that comes after but. So let me show you how this works.

[14:20] So if I said, hey, these markers smell like shit, but they write four times longer than other

[14:29] markers and they don't dry out. Here you're like, wow, I now believe that more than if I just

[14:34] said, these markers last four times longer than other markers before they dry out. If I said they smell

[14:38] terrible and are, but they do that, it's more persuasive. Now watch this. Let's flip it. These markers

[14:46] write four times longer than others, but they smell like crap. What am I emphasizing? I'm actually

[14:50] emphasizing the fact that they smell bad, not the fact that they write longer. And so we use the first

[14:55] part to gain trust for the second half of the statement. Viagra only works for four to six hours,

[15:02] but you're going to have the time of your life. And so it might raise your blood pressure,

[15:07] but you're going to have an amazing night. Our websites are ugly as hell, but they convert.

[15:13] Right? Our systems are incredibly boring, but they work. Right? If I said our systems work,

[15:18] but they're incredibly boring, I'm going to emphasize on the boring part, not on the fact that

[15:22] they work. And so by how you organize your language around words like butt, which are amplifiers,

[15:27] it allows you to say damaging emissions in a way that's compelling. And so right now what I would

[15:32] like you to do is write down all of the flaws, all the things that people complain about, the things

[15:36] that you know you could do better and claim them. Because the thing is that the prospect is already

[15:41] thinking them, but if you can claim them, instead of them thinking them, you acknowledge them,

[15:45] gain trust, and then when you make your statements, they will believe you more. So if you want to

[15:49] stand out in a crowded marketplace, tell the truth, it makes you more authentic. And if you can

[15:55] do it humor, you get even more bonus points. So it's like listen, our gym has honestly pretty terrible

[16:01] parking. Our AC is kind of on and off. I don't have the best equipment, but our sessions are more

[16:07] fun than everyone else is because it's all we've got. If I said that, you now believe me. Right?

[16:13] The thing is, if you saw an ad that said that, you'd be like, I kind of believe this guy. He's

[16:16] probably not so bad. Right? He's telling the truth. And I'll bet you his classes probably are fun.

[16:21] Now if I just said we have the most fun sessions, you wouldn't believe me because anyone can say that.

[16:26] But what people won't say is the truth. So number six, show, don't tell. Now this one is one of

[16:34] those ones that you will probably nod your head on and be like, yes, of course, show, don't tell.

[16:38] But the thing is is, when I say show, don't tell, I'm actually talking more about breaking down

[16:43] the reasoning. So kind of like I was alluding to earlier, which is instead of saying, get more sales,

[16:48] describe what the experience of getting more sales means or what that moment would look like.

[16:54] Like selling so many that you're running out of order for it because customers are reading their

[16:57] credit cards you over the phone too fast. That is the experience of getting more sales. Right?

[17:03] So you want to note the descriptions of what's happening and the emotions they might experience.

[17:07] The overwhelm of having too many phones ring and not enough sales people. That's the

[17:12] experience of getting advertising that works. Don't just say get more leads, describe the experience

[17:19] of getting more leads means. That's what they want to experience. They want to see their gym

[17:25] full. They want to know what it's like to have a line around the corner. They want to know what

[17:28] it's like where they actually have to reorganize their gym so that they can actually make room

[17:33] for more people at the session. Those are the good problems that we want to describe, which also

[17:37] yes, there are problems. But if we describe the future problems they would prefer to have

[17:42] than their current problems, those are arguably some of the most compelling things you can

[17:45] include in copy. Because if you can describe the problems they haven't thought about yet,

[17:49] then it's likely that you've experienced them or how other people experience them,

[17:52] which then increase likely that they believe it will happen for them. And so the big thing here

[17:56] in terms of show to tell, obviously from a creative perspective, you want the videos to demonstrate

[18:00] it, you want your creative images to demonstrate it, but you're actual copy itself. You want to use

[18:05] more descriptive language that is specific to the experience they're going to have the moments.

[18:11] And I'm going to repeat this theme because it's big. What is the moment that someone's

[18:15] going to experience that they got more sales? What is that moment feel like? What does it look like?

[18:20] When what moment will they realize that this is actually occurred? Show me that sales has occurred.

[18:26] Describe to me that scenario, that is how you write exceptional copy. And what's cool about this

[18:31] is if you want to write unique copy, the way you describe that moment will always be unique to you,

[18:35] compared to other people. And so you can always have fresh copy that sounds different and

[18:40] interesting because you're not just going to use the same words everyone uses. Number seven,

[18:44] tie benefits to status whenever possible. So a lot of people talk about benefits not features,

[18:52] which is true. But I like to take this a step further mentally, which is a cookbook so fast and easy

[18:58] that all your friends will wonder how you found the time to be fit and cook for your family. Right?

[19:04] That would be okay. That's one level, right, of benefit. But the idea is what is the, like,

[19:09] in that benefit will we tie in is we tie in their friends. Their friends are going to give them

[19:13] status because of this thing, which is just a cookbook. Right? So rather than say hey, you're going to

[19:18] cook meals fast and easy, sure that might be an element of it, right? But so fast that their friends

[19:24] are going to wonder how they're doing it is another level of this. And so whenever we can tie status,

[19:30] and this is why in the in the leads book I talk about this on page 140, I talk with the what who went

[19:35] to framework. This is where this becomes incredibly important. And so what we want to do when we're

[19:40] thinking about status and the reason that this framework works so well is that we're thinking about the who,

[19:45] right? Obviously it's them, but who is giving them the status because they're status within different

[19:49] realms is it their family who's giving them status is that their friends is that their college

[19:53] or co-workers is that their rivals is that their competitors who are they who are they vanquishate.

[19:58] And so humans are competitive species. We do desire status because it increases likely that we're able

[20:03] to procreate and create more kids and acquire resources, right? And so we want to tie all of our

[20:08] benefits to what it's going to do with the ultimately want which is going to be status. Now what's

[20:13] interesting is that the status that people get is going to be unique to that person within their

[20:17] subgroup. So if I'm going to try to describe status to a mother, it's going to be probably from

[20:23] kids that excel and other parents wonder how they're parenting, not from getting a Lamborghini,

[20:30] right? Now if I'm trying to talk to a hustle bros 20 years old, then probably talking about

[20:34] a Lamborghini might convert. Now might not convert the type of hustle bros that I would be looking for,

[20:38] but nonetheless it would convert some person who's interested in that. Right? I'm all about

[20:42] most of your mobiles in having cash cars that you can buy for seven grand and then not for about

[20:46] car payment. So you can actually reach in your bank account rather than in other people's eyes.

[20:49] But boy, being if we're writing copy, we have to meet them where they're at. And so the the

[20:54] wording that we think about this and also just to give you more color on this is that we think

[20:58] past present future. So how am I going to create status for them with their spouse,

[21:02] them with their wife today and in the future and in the past? So now I have multiple different people

[21:09] who are giving and awarding status to this person, through the copywriting and different time

[21:12] periods. So it gives you endless variations and angles to approach the benefits. All right? And so you

[21:17] want to think the lines so that you can or so that your friends mouths will drop with envy.

[21:22] Right? That's what we're trying to describe here. Number eight is that we want to use urgency and

[21:26] scarcity. All right. Now to be clear, urgency and scarcity, people lock them together but they're

[21:31] actually different things. All right? So scarcity is a function of quantity. Urgency is a function of time.

[21:38] All right? So that means that I've given an unlimited amount of widgets that I'm trying to sell.

[21:42] But I'm only running my promotion until midnight. It's a it's a function of time that's urgency.

[21:47] If I live 100 widgets or I'm only choosing to sell 100 spots, which scarcity you can choose to have,

[21:53] then at that point once a hundred spots, maybe that takes a year to sell or maybe it takes five

[21:57] seconds to sell, that line in the sand no matter how many people want to buy it after that point,

[22:01] cannot buy it. Now you can't have both, but fundamentally all we're trying to do is show the other

[22:06] people want it and that they have to act quickly. What we're trying to do is decrease the actions

[22:10] that are from thresholds so they take action. And the key to making urgency and scarcity work is

[22:16] making legitimate. There's actually, I don't even know if there's really much more to it,

[22:21] than actually having it be legitimate. There's really not another secret. There's different

[22:25] types of urgency and scarcity, which I talked about in the offers books. So I have a whole chapter

[22:30] in the offers books. So page 104 for scarcity and then the next chapter right afterwards. I have

[22:35] four urgency, which is page 112. And so I talked about four different types of urgency and different

[22:40] things that you can do to include scarcity in, you were offerings with their products or services,

[22:45] but no matter what, you just needed to be real. That's all I can tell you. And the part that

[22:50] people struggle with is to like, but what if someone wants to buy after midnight? What if someone

[22:54] wants to buy when I already said I have 100 spots? It means you say no. And you say no so you can

[22:58] maintain the reputation so that the next time you have scarcity, scarcity, the first buyer is going to

[23:02] be. But when he was able to buy the last time. So you're digging your well before your thirsty. I would

[23:06] always prefer to undersell my demand so I always have more later. Otherwise you're always going to be

[23:10] looking for the next kill, the next sale. And you're going to be putting the scarcity urge

[23:14] to do it, but everyone knows it doesn't matter because you're not going to sell out. And that's where

[23:17] you start losing power. Now, number nine is implied authority. All right. Now this isn't, this is a nasty

[23:23] one in a cool way. So this actually goes back to number one. So if you're the only double-seeker

[23:29] black belt in the area, say it, right? If you've transformed over a thousand people to black belts,

[23:35] say so. If you have a pro-athlete client and they allow you to say it, say it, all of these things

[23:41] imply authority and people listen to and trust authority figures more. And so that's how we've helped

[23:48] five thousand gyms or six thousand gyms over the last seven years. And so part of authority is also

[23:52] just longevity. If you say we've been in business for 40 years, the likely that you are a legitimate

[23:57] business is pretty high. Right? That's actually a pretty rare feat. So you've been in business for a while.

[24:02] That's a big thing. Now maybe you and your co-founders in aggregate have done over 20 years of advertising.

[24:07] Maybe it's four of you guys have all done five years, but it sounds better to say in aggregate

[24:10] we've done over 20 years of advertising. Right? Now again, the key here is if you have something as a hook

[24:17] like as seen on Oprah's best boot camps or best boot camp in Vegas or best car-practor in Vegas or

[24:22] best whatever is this is why these tiny little awards matter so much because you can actually even

[24:26] start a sales conversation with, did you find us on the Vegas best boot camp list? Now you might

[24:33] know that no one even knows that this list exists. And that's okay because that list just gives you

[24:39] a plight authority when you actually have the conversation with the prospect. And so at the end of the day

[24:43] this is where proof does beat promise. All right? And so we're now getting to the believability of the claim.

[24:51] Right? So this is why it's further down on here because someone has to want the thing that you're

[24:54] offering first. Once they offer it then other their warning bells are going to go off like why should I

[24:59] believe this person? And that's where you want to have the proof that this they can believe you.

[25:03] And this is why documenting and substantiating the things that you have done and the people that you have

[25:08] helped ultimately makes you more likely to be persuasive. Right? If you have a thousand people who

[25:14] have, you know, the thousand testimonials versus somebody or imagine you're going to read you see

[25:17] you're looking between two restaurants on yelp. Right? One has a five star with three reviews. That's three.

[25:23] There you go. Three reviews, right? Or you've got three thousand reviews. Why not? Let's just stick with it.

[25:28] All right? But you've got a 4.6. Which one are you going for? For sure. No question you're going to

[25:33] one of the one that has 4,000 reviews. Now it's 4,000 with a 4.6 rating rather than a 5. But that

[25:39] doesn't make sense. This one has 5. This is a 4.6. The proof demonstrates the implied authority that

[25:43] obviously these people better run. They know what they're doing. They service a lot of customers. It's

[25:46] social proof. All right? Now number 10, always have a PS statement. All right? Now why do we have a PS

[25:53] statement? So it's a power sentence, which is why I like to think about it. All right? Is that power

[25:58] sentence? The two most red parts of advertising. Number one, the headline. Number two, the PS statement.

[26:05] And so if you have the two most red lines in all of your advertising, you better be sure you're thinking

[26:10] about we're writing. And at the very least, have a PS statement. Right? And so always have them

[26:15] and make sure that they're strong. And so I have a number of different strategies that I use for

[26:19] PS statements. And I'll tell you probably my top three. All right? So number one in emails, I prefer to

[26:25] have some sort of sign-off that gets people jazzed. I'm very excited to have. I want to reward them

[26:29] for having read my email. So this is where I put jokes in, this is where I put fun stuff that's light.

[26:34] So that every once in a while when I do want to put a call to action, I make this PS a call to action

[26:38] that's strong because I know everyone's going to read it and click it because I've trained them to click

[26:42] that link. All right. Now in an advertising setting, that PS statement's either going to be a

[26:49] disclaimer of who this is not for, which often works really, really well. Hey, by the way, if you're

[26:53] just getting started, this isn't for you. This is only for people doing our 20s e-click here.

[26:56] That's very strong as PS statement. Another PS statement that works very well is just recapping

[27:01] everything in one sentence. We've helped a thousand people. We were good at making block belts. If you're

[27:05] serious about black belts, click here. Boom. Right? And so it's like, hey, if you did, if you just

[27:10] read to the bottom and skip to the bottom, like, I do, this is the main, this is the main nuggets. Right?

[27:13] Your main points of persuasion all in one place. Now, you can also piggyback on this with a

[27:19] PPS statement and have two PS statements because guess what? The only thing that's read less than,

[27:25] I'm sorry, the only thing that's read more than the normal copy, but less than the headline in the

[27:28] PS is the PPS. That's the third most read statement in copy. So I would also include something

[27:33] there too if you need it. Now, number 11, this one's going to be this one. This it's like, it's amazing

[27:40] how effective this is and also how simple it is and the only thing simpler is to not do it. So you

[27:46] have to have clear CTA. So calls to action. If you do not tell someone exactly what to do next,

[27:52] you decrease the likelihood that they do it. So you want it to be stupid simple. Not you know what to do,

[28:00] you have to, they don't know. Right? And so if you want X, click the button and on the next page,

[28:07] value your information, then select a convenient time for you to come in so that you won't miss.

[28:11] Right? We want to be very clear about what they have to do and what's going to happen next.

[28:15] Right? They're not going to guess, but here's a really, really cool sub point about this.

[28:19] If you tell someone to take an option or take a step and then you tell them what's going to happen next

[28:24] and then what you said is going to happen happens. You increase your say due correspondence,

[28:29] meaning you gain influence over them because what you said after they followed your instruction

[28:34] came true. It's the reason Martha Stewart was such a powerful influencer compared to other people.

[28:39] She literally gave people recipes to follow and she said, if you want to bake a cake,

[28:44] here is the 18th sister baking in cake and when you follow these 18 steps, you get a cake and then

[28:48] when you get a cake and the cake the cake tastes good and then you tied to status because other people say

[28:53] this cake is amazing and your family loves you for baking this cake. Guess what happens? She gains

[28:57] influence over you because the next time she gives you instructions, you are more likely to follow them.

[29:02] And so we can embed this within the process of persuasion. So we want to basically make promises,

[29:06] keep promises, make promises, keep promises, make promises, keep promises, over and over and over again

[29:11] where they actually take action and that's the key part is they have to take action on something you

[29:15] said and what you have to say will happen happens. That's what makes it. It's not just saying,

[29:20] oh, open loop, oh, just make promises. They have to take action and then your promise gets to

[29:25] fill based on their action. So outline step one, two, three and outline what's going to happen next

[29:30] because when it does, they'll believe you the next time you tell them to do something. And like

[29:34] I believe in this so much the reason I called my whole company acquisition.com was to that

[29:39] the name of my company was the call to action. So if someone's like, hey, how do I find out more about

[29:44] acquisition.com? I had someone show up in my building and say, hey, how do I apply to acquisition.com?

[29:50] And I was like,

[30:02] number 12. And this is a, this is so good. This is so good. I mean, all of these are good. These are

[30:08] why I use these. Like I've really tried to 80 20 this for you guys. Third grade reading level.

[30:15] Most copied doesn't convert because people have to pause to understand it. And the moment they pause,

[30:19] they stop because it takes more horsepower than the willing to dedicate to it. So we have to

[30:23] assume that the prospect is inter rush doesn't care about what we have has below a third grade

[30:29] reading level and is distracted. And that's the person we have to grab by the throat and bring

[30:34] into our world. This is the $100 million scaling roadmap. And what we did was we broke down the

[30:38] 10 stages of scaling. And so if you're advertising, whether that be an emails for outreach or

[30:44] writing phone scripts or video sales letters or web pages or making content, all of these things are

[30:50] messaging that include copy to get people to do stuff. And so what we did was we broke down all

[30:55] the different stages of scaling into these 10 steps where you get stuck and how to break through

[31:00] and it's all absolutely free. And so if your business owner not sure where you're at,

[31:04] enter your business information to acquisition.com towards slash roadmap. And then on the thank you

[31:08] page, if you'd like us to help you with your marketing, if you'd like us to help you scale,

[31:12] then I'd love to have you come out to one of our workshops who run a monthly here at our headquarters

[31:16] in Vegas so the thank you page you can book call. But otherwise this is actually free.

[31:20] You don't need to attend a call or anything like that to get this. It's my gift to you.

[31:22] So you go acquisition.com for slash roadmap and join the rest of it.

[31:25] Synthesis that are two complex or used to big of words, you're not writing a college paper, right?

[31:31] You're writing an ad that has milliseconds to catch someone's attention. So make the process as

[31:36] frictionless as possible. So if you want to make easy copy, you want to make a light copy.

[31:41] The way that you do that is you look at everything that makes copy hard to understand,

[31:45] you're writing hard to understand and remove it. So great copy the words fade into the background.

[31:51] No one's actually thinking about the words. They're just understanding what it says.

[31:55] And then ultimately being more likely to be persuaded by it. So if I have something that's

[31:59] written at ninth grade read level, but or third grade reading level, so many people cannot

[32:04] rated a ninth grade reading level. Many people can read, but they can't read at that level.

[32:09] And so if we want you automatically disqualified two thirds of the people read the copy,

[32:14] keep it at ninth grade. But if you want everyone who can read, to read, they keep it at third grade.

[32:20] Look at the most popular books in America. They are purposely written because the authors

[32:24] know what they're doing at a level that most people can understand. So fancy equals friction,

[32:29] simple equals sales. I put every ad that I write through free reading level tool and I continue to

[32:36] edit the copy as if it is third grade reading level. Now I'll give you a couple of quick tips on this.

[32:41] All right. So number one is you want short sentences, small words, big promises.

[32:46] Right. Big proof. You want few ad verbs and better verbs, meaning instead of you quickly ran,

[32:52] say he sprinted. And so we won't word, precision. We would have his few words as possible to

[32:57] communicate the point, but we want to keep the words themselves as simple as possible. After like

[33:01] wait a second, sprinting versus running fast, sprinting is a more advanced word. And this is why

[33:06] writing copies difficult. We have to think is there another word that people also understand

[33:11] that I don't have to use two words that I can use one. Now, at the highest levels, I will never

[33:16] prioritize precision over simplicity. So simplicity, trumps, precision, meaning fewer words.

[33:22] Consistent itself is like another great word. All right.

[33:25] Which is using fewer words to say the same thing as many words. But you probably understood it better.

[33:32] That's what's crazy. Is this stuff actually works? All right. And so these are 12. But you know,

[33:37] I do like over delivering. So I'm going to give you one more bonus lucky number 13. All right.

[33:41] So when says 13 that might be that might be unlucky. So we'll put bonus here. I don't believe

[33:45] in superstition, but let's just roll with it. Is whenever possible, you're shimmer. Right?

[33:51] Because if you look at the old spice at the highest converting out of all time,

[33:55] to my knowledge, in terms of it took something was a mark not a market leader and make it that

[34:00] made it the market share, you know, dominator is it was funny. Right. And the thing is that if you

[34:06] can entertain and educate at the same time, you win. Right. Because entertainment makes something

[34:11] significantly broader. Education is what's going to change so it's behavior. And so we want to

[34:15] answer about entertain and educate entertainment to go broad. Education to go deep. The education

[34:20] changes the behavior mean is that they take the click. That means that they do what you want them to do.

[34:24] This is why now if I depict one thing to cut out, it would be humor. All right. Because you can make

[34:29] it add that can run with the other 12. But if you want the extra sauce, right, take us to that thing.

[34:35] You've always wanted to go to, right? If you want that extra sizzle, then you can add humor in.

[34:39] The difficulty is how do you make something funny for everyone? And this is where testing is so important.

[34:44] Right. If you look at how comedians, I'm a big study of comedy because I really enjoy it.

[34:47] How comedians make their whole specials is that they will go to many, many clubs,

[34:53] test new material. And they might find when they do a 60 minutes set that there's only eight

[34:56] minutes that people really like. They then front load the first day minutes, they're next set.

[35:00] And then they have 52 minutes of other stuff. And they find two more minutes that people like.

[35:04] And they put it there at the front for the next one. Now they've got 10 minutes. And that's how they

[35:07] build their sets into the whole 60 minutes as hilarious because they've tested it in North Carolina

[35:13] in New York and Mexico and internationally. And so they've got something that just converts.

[35:18] And by converts it means it gets people to do what they want them to do, which in the context of comedy is

[35:22] laughing. Right. And so if we can make something that's both funny and educational, ultimately we would.

[35:26] And if you like this, then I have 13 years of business insights that I've learned. And I think you'll

[35:31] absolutely love that video.

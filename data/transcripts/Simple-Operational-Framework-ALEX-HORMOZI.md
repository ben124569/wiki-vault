[00:00] I think the easiest way to structure operations is first

[00:04] list out the things the desired outcomes that need to happen.

[00:07] I don't get a lot of questions about operations.

[00:09] They just become obvious that they are a problem within a lot of the people that we

[00:14] help serve.

[00:15] And so it's interesting because now that we work on the Alan side with

[00:19] resellers, it's very clear who's good at operations and who is not.

[00:23] And that is typically based on the size of the business, the people who are better at

[00:26] operating are the ones who make more money.

[00:29] And this is kind of one of the unspoken secrets of the entrepreneurial world,

[00:33] especially within the internet space that we live in now.

[00:36] It appears to be all about marketing, and sales, and lead gen, and acquisition.

[00:41] And although those are very important things and you have to start there, it becomes very

[00:46] clear that typically the entrepreneur has that promotion type of character traits.

[00:53] And doesn't dedicate the time to study the operational components of the business

[00:59] which typically are the reasons that someone is or is not successful.

[01:02] And so I wanted to give you at least my simple, mental framework for how I think about

[01:08] operations in general and scaling operations.

[01:12] And so for the vast majority of people listening here, you're probably under eight figures,

[01:18] summer, under seven.

[01:19] But most people are listening to this are probably business owners in the multiple

[01:23] 100,000 year to several million year.

[01:27] So this is who I'm talking to within that context.

[01:32] I think the easiest way to structure operations is first

[01:36] list out the things the desired outcomes that need to happen.

[01:41] And I think of business very much as a pipeline, which is from click to close to resell.

[01:47] And resell within different businesses can be retaining them so that they pay again.

[01:51] Or it could be a variation of a sense in it.

[01:53] But when I say click, it means how do I get someone to click?

[01:56] And that's just within the internet environment.

[01:57] Click to opt in to schedule to show to buy, to then ultimately want to buy it again.

[02:04] And so if you have like with our gyms, a four step sales process or three step sales process

[02:11] that's happening, there are clear activities that need to happen.

[02:16] And so in the beginning, you will have your front end sales.

[02:19] And so you need to list that as one of the activities.

[02:23] Because the objective would be to sell them.

[02:25] The activity is to take the call.

[02:27] Next you'd have the nutritional orientation to be the next time you'd meet with them.

[02:32] So then you need to allocate how many of those you're going to need based on your current inflow.

[02:37] It's the nice thing is that there's a ratio of for every 10 customers.

[02:42] We need to do four of these two of these and one of these.

[02:45] Right? And so what you can do is once you realize what the outcomes are,

[02:49] you can list out all of the activities that are required.

[02:52] So for a typical client, we might know that it takes about two minutes per client per day.

[02:57] And if we know that a coach has three hours,

[03:01] like we want to say when our cap a coach at 100,

[03:03] then we know that that coach is going to be able to do that within X amount of time.

[03:08] Right? And so then we book that time on that person's day.

[03:11] And so what happens is what you should do when you're creating your company

[03:16] is when you're creating each of the roles that are going to support you,

[03:19] you need to look at a calendar and look at what the times of day that this person is going to be

[03:23] working and what they're going to be doing with each hour of their day.

[03:26] And so you simply take the activities and the allocated time that they need to work

[03:33] and place those on their calendar. And that's honestly all there is to it.

[03:39] All right? So I'm going to give you an example of hopefully flesh the saddle a little bit.

[03:42] But within an online fitness business, which many of you guys are operating right now,

[03:48] there's really four if if demand gen is being taken care of.

[03:53] Right? So if lead gen is being taken care of, lead nurtures being taken care of.

[03:56] And I'm saying that because it'll make the example simpler, but also because that's what we do in our company.

[04:01] Four gyms is if those two things are taken care of, then there's really not a lot that needs to happen.

[04:07] Right? So first you need to have first sales calls to get new customers talking to prospects.

[04:13] Then you need an onboarding. Right? That onboarding is to be typically a nutrition orientation

[04:16] and also walking through the app and the tech and the things that need to happen.

[04:21] And that's it. Right? The third thing that will need to occur will be some sort of

[04:26] ascension conversation, which is going to sell them into continuity. All right? So that's number three.

[04:31] Now every customer is going to have one of these things. Right? And so if you're selling,

[04:35] here it is, you're selling 10 people a week, then you need to, if you're going to

[04:40] if you're going to maintain that flow, then if you know that your front and sales 30 minutes,

[04:44] your nutritional point of 30 minutes and then your ascension is 30 minutes,

[04:47] then for every client that you're bringing in, you have an hour and a half per week that's

[04:52] going to be allocated. Right? Now you can divide that up between different people, but the

[04:56] keys to scaling is that eventually it becomes too much for one person to do all of those activities.

[05:01] And then you start blocking entire pieces of that type of activity to the next person. Right?

[05:06] And so I'm going to continue with the example. After that, the only other activity that's going to

[05:12] be there would be either recruiting coaches, right? And obviously the fulfillment. And so let's say that

[05:19] the average customer is going to take five minutes today. I said too early, but let's just say it's five

[05:22] minutes. Right? And somebody has whatever it is, five minutes is a lot. Let's say say to for

[05:30] math sick. So 200 minutes, if you had a hundred clients per day, is what's going to be allocated. So that's

[05:36] what are these? Three hours and 20 minutes. So you look at someone's get, now that's obviously

[05:43] in a perfect scenario. But I look at one of my coaches schedules and say, okay, we're going to do 90

[05:48] minutes in the morning. And we're going to do 90 minutes in the afternoon. And we're going to block

[05:51] those times out. So just like that, we have eight hours a day, now I have five hours left. What else do I

[05:56] want this person to do? Well, I probably want them to take the onboarding conversations with

[06:01] the new customers who are coming in. Right? This is a coach. And I know that if we generate

[06:06] 10 new customers a week on average, then that's going to take five hours per week. Which means I can

[06:13] block one or two hours a day for that and be totally fine. Right? So I might block, now this is where

[06:19] availability becomes interesting because if you just do it at noon every day, the new customers might

[06:23] not be able to make that time. Right? And so I might have slots on Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays

[06:29] at one time and then Tuesdays and Thursdays at another time. And that way it gives them some

[06:33] different times to select from, right? But again, we have our daily activities. Now that need

[06:39] know for that coach is going to be the fulfillment that's ongoing. We might also have them do the

[06:43] nutrition orientation, which would be an hour or two hours per day, right? So if we have an hour,

[06:49] we'll say an hour per day. So now we've got four of their eight hours that have been taken. Now we've got

[06:54] four more hours that can be used by this person. So now we have options. Do we want this person to

[07:01] create content? Do we want this person to do outreach? Do we want this person to

[07:08] gosh? I mean, whatever, I mean, do we want to expand this person's capacity? Right? So there's

[07:12] or we would know that this person's currently at 50% utilization. Now if you flip that and then think,

[07:18] well, maybe this person can take some of the exit meetings, right? So this is maybe this person can

[07:23] take some of the content. Now this is strategic questions, not operational questions. But I'm saying,

[07:26] this is how you structure it operationally. It's like, okay, if we're selling 10 people a week,

[07:30] then we need to have 10 half-way conversations where we're going to send them into continuity. And then

[07:36] we'll also maybe have transformation meeting, which is the end where we take the pictures and all that kind of

[07:40] stuff. And so if we know each of those meetings takes another 30 minutes each per customer,

[07:45] if we know that we get 10 new customers per week, then we know that's going to be another hour.

[07:49] It's a 10 hours per week. Total. So that's another two hours per day, assuming that they're working

[07:54] five hours a week. And so now we're at six hours per day of work. All right? Now that's if someone's

[07:59] being perfectly efficient. I would still expect people to be perfectly efficient because I think you don't,

[08:04] you get what you tolerate. And so that would be six hours a day for a coach. Now at that point,

[08:09] this coach is handling basically everything post the initial sale. Right? They're managing the ongoing

[08:16] fulfillment. They're managing the onboarding activities for these new customers and they're managing

[08:20] the back end meetings with them to convert them into continuity. Right? And so all of these things put

[08:27] together would create a role within the business. And so my ask or my recommendation for you is

[08:35] if you haven't done this activity, it provides you immense clarity in understanding what are the

[08:40] different activities that need to occur in the business to make more money. And then once you have

[08:44] the list of the activities, then you know how long each of the activities could shake. And then the only

[08:49] variable that will dictate how many of them you have is what you're in flow is. Right? And so if you

[08:55] know what your in flow is and you know what's your base of customer ridges and the n-n-n-your

[08:59] attrition, you can very accurately back into what an ideal day looks like for each of the roles within your

[09:06] business. Also, the bigger you get, the more you will find inefficiencies where you're starting

[09:12] these partial roles, they're getting full time pay for halftime work. Right? And so this allows you to

[09:16] be more efficient because you can say, hey, I know you're only at 40% utilization. Why are you telling

[09:20] me that you're too busy right now? Why are you telling me that I need to hire another coach? What

[09:24] else are you doing that is not within these parameters? Now if someone then says, well I'm doing this

[09:29] this and this and it's like, oh, now either they'll be founded at things like things that are

[09:33] useful and you know value producing or they won't be. Many times they're not, but that's not because

[09:39] the person who's who you're employee is doing this out of you know nefarious intentions they're

[09:43] not trying to be malicious they're not trying to hurt your business. It's simply because a lot of

[09:47] people just don't even know it's valuable right? And so they're trying to work they're trying to

[09:51] provide value but a lot of times they just don't get how like they just a lot of times they join

[09:56] into the bigger picture or why you're not having someone do something right? But if the thing that they're

[10:01] doing is is a core activity like I got to check in on these people I got to add them to this

[10:06] it takes this long to get the documents back or you know sometimes you've these past

[10:09] past-work issues then you can see is this something that we can fix operation with an additional

[10:13] process or is it something that we can you know it's either throw out and then get this person

[10:19] to refocus and then increase how much work they're doing by adding more clients to their roster etc.

[10:25] And so all this to say this is how I thought about operations is just in terms of activities

[10:30] and units of time and then expected inflow and so based on those three variables of

[10:36] this is how many people are coming in these are the activities needed to happen and this is how long

[10:40] they should take then it allows you to account for all the things that need to happen in the business

[10:44] and we'll ultimately allow to have a more efficiently run shot. Now I guarantee you that because of

[10:48] the headline that I had operations for them is we one of the least listen to podcasts out there but it is

[10:54] the reason that the people who make the most money make the most money and I just cannot tell you like

[10:59] the amount of people who have access who have tried to copy our stuff at Jamalanch and and

[11:03] are one tenth one twenty-thousands of what we are and guys just like it's it's the boring work

[11:12] it's the it's the it's the it's the rolling your sleeves up it's the repetitive work it's the

[11:16] meetings and training your team on improving how good they are doing the things that is

[11:20] ultimately the thing that's going to propel a company and those things are based on culture and tolerance

[11:25] of the leader and so I just want to leave you with that so if you feel like you're constantly overwhelmed

[11:30] and you don't feel like you have transparency and what your people are doing and what are they doing

[11:33] all day this is the activity that you can do that will give you immense clarity and transparency

[11:39] and what their actions are so you can also be structured the business to make those money and also

[11:42] find inefficiencies or additional tasks that you're not accounting for that they are doing

[11:46] which are either revenue generating or requirements or they're totally worthless activities

[11:51] that they're simply doing because they just don't know any better and so highly recommend doing it

[11:55] and if you don't know where to start the easiest thing to do is have your employees take a time study

[12:02] all right so time studies very simple you have an excel sheet you have every 15 minutes of the day

[12:06] and then you just have them right now what they did for each of those 15 minutes now they're going

[12:10] to think that's going to take a lot of time you are never more efficient than when you do a time

[12:13] study I promise every time I do one I tell myself I'm going to do it again like forever and then I don't

[12:18] but you will literally be more efficient in your work than you ever will because you know that you're

[12:22] being held accountable to it all right so it's like whenever Lailin I need to go and take a closer

[12:28] good apartment the first thing we do like these numbers aren't adding up this feels weird this

[12:32] feels heavier this feels light whatever it is we go we ask them to time stay for a week and then

[12:37] we look at their activities you can also very quickly see where there's bullshit right where people are

[12:41] like ah responding to emails and like why do you have three hours of emails is there something I don't

[12:47] how long does it take to a recording how many emails are you getting every day and so that's how you

[12:50] can start peeling the layers back and seeing if someone's being dishonest which happens right and

[12:54] then they're getting it because they want to keep their job and I get that but that being said it's

[12:57] not useful for the business and so that is how if you want to get a baseline of like okay well now

[13:02] I know what all the activities are you can deem whether they're valuable and you can deem whether you

[13:07] want them to keep doing it or whether they're expanding the time sorry expanding their activities to

[13:11] meet the amount of time that they're supposed to be working all right so um that is my my quick

[13:15] uh that's that's kind of my mental framework for how I look at operations um and how to

[13:21] structure them for different roles within the company is first look at the the outcomes that you want

[13:25] the activities you need to generate uh that that outcome how long this activity stay per customer per

[13:30] unit and then you can extrapolate out based on the volume based on the inflow what each role needs to

[13:35] do and then at what points you will have breaking points where somebody will become overwhelmed

[13:39] and you need to create a new role all right so um anyways I hope that was valuable for you

[13:43] of the main sense otherwise have a happy Thursday uh happy corona uh happy quarantine and I hope

[13:48] you are adapting uh because you have no choice but to do so otherwise all right lots of love

[13:53] good you guys soon

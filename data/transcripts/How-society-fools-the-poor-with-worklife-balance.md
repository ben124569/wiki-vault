[00:00] My wife and I have built six multi-a figure companies in the last five years, or current

[00:04] profilitis, about $85 million a year. We run acquisition.com and I was interviewed recently for

[00:09] a segment on a two hour long podcast and the segment that I want to show you is a really cool

[00:13] clip that we just talk about. What it was like to literally build these companies together,

[00:16] being married and the balance between work, life and marriage. All right, so like I said,

[00:20] enjoy and I'll see you guys in the other side. I mean a lot of people used to get on me about like

[00:24] email work life balance, like blah blah blah blah and it's just like I just like you have one life

[00:29] and they are your terms and no one else is terms and we optimize typically for the things that

[00:34] we enjoy doing and like if you have more stimulus from working than you do from not working then like

[00:40] work and then if you feel like at some point you have traded off something that you don't want to

[00:44] trade off for then you can adjust. So I've always felt I enjoy working. Like what was it my mom?

[00:49] So we have like a wedding to go to on the day after my birthday. So we're talking about, you know,

[00:55] we have to fly up on my birthday. I'm just like, oh we could do this and you're birthday this

[00:58] and I'm like, no, I just want to work. You're like, no, but it's your birthday. You shouldn't have

[01:02] to work. And I was like, I want to work. It's not only one of the eyes, I just want to work. Even

[01:05] Santa Monica, my birthday. I was like the only thing I wanted you today is work. That was it.

[01:10] Just wanted to work. I mean, everybody wants to, they're like, man, do something you love and

[01:16] you'll never work another day in your life. But like it's just because everyone has this really

[01:19] poor definition of work. But like if you have accomplished that, which obviously you have, you're just

[01:24] living and like what you do in life. So I'll rewind something really quickly, which is like 2021,

[01:29] I did nothing. I owned all the companies, pounded out a lot of cash flow and I did nothing. And

[01:36] it was a very miserable year for me because I tried to spend the money that I was making and I

[01:42] couldn't. Like it was just not even really a possibility. And so like I got into a place of like,

[01:47] why am I even doing this? Like what's the point? Like I'll never be able to spend this money that I

[01:51] have like why have I been doing all the stuff? And in starting acquisition.com or at least making

[01:56] that the sole focus now again and being able to build all the infrastructure, you know, higher the

[01:59] teams and all the stuff that we're doing on that side of the business. Like I have so much joy getting

[02:03] back into the game because I feel like I've been kind of like in a super high-level position

[02:07] for like an extended period of time that I exited the business because I thought that that was

[02:11] what the next natural step was supposed to be. It was just like you go from CEO to owning it as

[02:14] shareholder or board directors, whatever. And that is very much what happened. But I realized that for me

[02:20] at least it's like I work to create options not to not work. And so a lot of people like they

[02:25] work really hard to not have to work later. It's like no, it's like I work to have the option to work.

[02:29] And so I can choose to work and that choice is the freedom that I have. And so like if I'm choosing

[02:33] with the optionality that I have to work then that is exactly what I want to do. Just being on the

[02:38] other side of it of like going to the like there's literally no way I can spend this money for

[02:42] the rest of my life mount top. Like the only thing that I wanted to do is the thing that got me

[02:45] or which is like I love working. And so it's the thing that I find meaningful. And I think that maybe

[02:50] you shift direction in terms of like maybe some of the stuff that you create like maybe there's

[02:54] some things that you create that are for YouTube versus like four gram. And I just think that it just

[02:59] slowly optimizes to only doing things for a gram. Which a lot of times still ends up being that

[03:04] but like you get their backwards. It's like if you made it purely for you then you might be able

[03:08] to make a video after that. It's like I worked 300 miles and I didn't fill anything and this is what I

[03:12] learned. Like that would probably be a really valuable video because you probably would have some

[03:15] interesting insights. Like I didn't fill them either of the great card owned videos and then just

[03:18] made videos about the calls of like my takeaways and they were still really great videos.

[03:23] Interesting. Okay so my only thought to that is like you are in a very unique position because

[03:31] you run this business with your wife and stuff like that. And I think that marriage plays a big

[03:38] part in my life. And I think marriage is a compromise. And so my wife doesn't like it when I work as

[03:45] much and her I guess her her like love language is what quality time or whatever. And I think

[03:51] gram is girlfriend Macy is similar. And I think that there's a compromise there where yes.

[03:58] Gram if all he wants to do is work that's great and he can work in work and work. But I think that

[04:02] marriage a successful marriage is truly a compromise. And if it turns out that you know like like

[04:10] you really good I've like so many thoughts right now. Yeah it's stimulating conversation.

[04:14] And I think and I think everybody's in a unique position because you know definitely like there's

[04:20] you you could say well you know I'm growing away now so that you know I I don't have to work

[04:25] in the future and we get to have time together or you can kind of balance and live in the

[04:28] now and live in the future. But I think everybody's kind of in a unique position but I think that

[04:34] that part of your life is is always going to be a compromise to some sort of extent.

[04:38] So I think it's a belief that you choose to define it the way. Yeah I'm okay.

[04:41] I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm

[04:42] compromising as a belief statement like that's not a statement effect that is a belief.

[04:45] And so like I don't believe that marriage is going to go for us. Tell us your experience with that

[04:48] because I have uh because I'm sure we all have different experiences. Yeah.

[04:51] Mine in the beginning was that I did find that there was a compromise because Macy came from

[04:56] the mindset like you know five or six p.m. comes around you're done with work. Yeah.

[05:00] And you're free. And my mind works 24.7. I tried that and I woke up really early. I'd wake up at like

[05:07] five a.m. so I could be done by five p.m. in the night. And that worked for actually quite a while

[05:12] because I actually found it was so productive in those morning hours that I could be done by five

[05:16] and be like, wow. This is great. But overall long trip trying to figure out like a balance.

[05:20] I found myself I wasn't myself like I was really I felt anxious. I was just like a tight I was

[05:27] washed like about what part like. No because because it couldn't work during the hours that I

[05:31] wanted to work like sometimes you just have this days where it's just like no no I'm so focused and

[05:36] I got it like you have that concentration you just have to continue. And so having it freedom for me

[05:41] if I don't have that I just wasn't myself and I was miserable. Yeah. What I'm going to say and I

[05:46] I have very strong views and they are not common. But I also think that I don't want to live a

[05:53] common life and so that I cannot have common views. So just like as a as a big disclaimer to that.

[05:58] Like I've only seen two dynamics that work in relationships over like an extended period of time.

[06:02] One is kind of the the like we're in it together and the other is like the you know cheerleader in

[06:07] quarterback cheering you on. But the thing is is like I can tell I can speak a lot to the you know we're in the game together.

[06:12] For me I know personally like I had two very long relationships that were cheerleader dynamics. And to me

[06:19] I could not imagine living life that way having now lived what I live now. Because like there's a certain amount of

[06:26] shared respect that you never get with somebody who does not know what it's like to be in the battlefield. We're in the arena.

[06:30] And if I'm like I need to work for the next three days and like write five book chapters like there's not a discussion.

[06:36] It's like course do you think there's no like there's no like I can't believe you're like uh and to the flip side in the cheerleader dynamic

[06:43] A cheerleader who's really rooting for the team doesn't ask the quarterback to come out when the games in the line.

[06:48] And so I think that a lot of people are running in what they consider to be cheerleader dynamics, but they are inverted dynamics.

[06:54] They're actually sabotaging the game. I think that it's like in that dynamic it's harder in my opinion to do the cheerleader quarterback

[07:00] Because you have to have a very aligned mission and goals of like the relationship. It's easier to do that in the dynamic that you're working together

[07:06] Because it's so clearly stated with the mission and the goals of like this is where I want to go

[07:10] And this is how I want to get there and like doing a come with me and then you're very much operating on this shared sense of reality

[07:15] And it also becomes difficult for entrepreneurs in my opinion now like I mean I'm sure you've seen plenty of people get divorced as they get older and whatnot

[07:21] Is that like if you're like all right, this will be interesting

[07:24] So typically when people become attracted so as to parole if you're a herd of her

[07:27] She's really interesting like relationship person. She's like one of the top TED talks on it

[07:31] There's a thing is called maintaining mating activities or book

[07:35] But in the beginning you have kind of this mystery because you don't know each other and that's what creates like the excitement right and as you get to know each other over time

[07:41] You swing like from

[07:43] Mystery to familiarity right you get a little bit more security

[07:45] Get to know each other better and it feels like more and more amazing

[07:48] And so what you do is you just keep trying to do that right?

[07:50] But what's happening is that you over-correct and then you become siblings and then it's like ah

[07:54] Well, that's not good and so there it's not a problem to be solved but a

[07:57] A dichotomy to be managed right in terms of like how much space do you create versus how much familiarity?

[08:02] What happens when people like entrepreneurs specifically like have their business and they

[08:07] Have the wife they spend more time the beginning and all of a sudden they don't spend as much time together

[08:10] And then they grow apart because they're also

[08:13] Exposed to different stimuli right and so you adapt to this stimuli that you have in the new grow part on the flip side

[08:18] If you're in my scenario where we're like doing the same thing together the downside of this one these couples make

[08:23] Farx times more money than any of the other versions that I just said but

[08:27] The you can become two familiar and then you just become siblings so for us we actually create more space

[08:32] So it's like we try to work on separate sides of the house

[08:34] We don't attend the same meetings so like at the end of the day we can sit down and dinner

[08:37] But like how is your day and she can tell me something rather than me saying like oh, I was there. I know right?

[08:41] Yeah, and so the happiest couples are actually couples that have all of both have careers that are not necessarily together

[08:47] So on average these couples are the ones that because they have a shared goal in terms of this is what we want to do

[08:52] They have shared values in terms of how they want to get there and they respect one another and they respect each other's goals

[08:56] And then they walk kind of in parallel

[08:58] So you've got the like I'm working the entrepreneur and you've got the state home life

[09:02] There's many times everyone seen that one go wrong. There's the like we're both working together in it

[09:06] Where you so these people have to

[09:08] Correct for trying to create more familiarity these ones have to create more space

[09:12] So you have these space to be missed and then these ones tend to be in the middle already and so they just kind of like have to keep walking

[09:17] And so for me it was actually just interesting seeing the different dynamics and like how we had to correct in the beginning

[09:23] Like we were wait we spent all day every day together and the business was small

[09:26] So it's like she was there and I was here and we worked out together and we together

[09:30] We did that for like two years and I was like you know maybe I'll sit on different meetings than you

[09:34] Yeah, but like seeing the level of like commitment and loyalty that you get from that and I don't

[09:39] So I went a little bit of a tangent there, but I have strong beliefs around around that and I think that you don't have to compromise anything if you don't want to

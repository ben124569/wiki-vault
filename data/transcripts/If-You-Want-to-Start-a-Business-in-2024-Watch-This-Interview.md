[00:00] 100 billion dollar company.

[00:02] This is a pretty exciting time for entrepreneurship.

[00:04] If you're at that point in your stage,

[00:05] like this gets important.

[00:06] The cost of failure of starting a business today

[00:09] is by far the lowest it's ever been.

[00:11] Business advice to Harley 10 years ago,

[00:13] you've got one thing you can call it.

[00:16] Welcome, everybody.

[00:17] To the game, I've got a special episode for you guys today.

[00:21] As you know, I do not have many guests on my podcast.

[00:24] I don't want to share any spotlight.

[00:26] Somebody's going to be on the got to be really, really special.

[00:29] And have tricks for T's to give.

[00:32] And I think the person that have with me today

[00:35] or that will be joining us today,

[00:37] definitely meets that in the space.

[00:38] And so Harley is a got amongst men,

[00:43] a legend in the making.

[00:45] And runs a small company.

[00:47] You may not have heard of it.

[00:48] Shopify, which right now is a public treaty company.

[00:52] It's worth right now.

[00:54] I think it was 80 billion.

[00:55] If I'm not mistaken, probably correct me there.

[00:58] I think it's about $100 billion, but I was $20 billion.

[01:01] You just, you just rounded down by $20 billion.

[01:04] So, someone like me, like, you know, this is,

[01:06] I don't come from this world.

[01:08] This is, you know, I'm a tourist here.

[01:10] That's a lot of money.

[01:12] So, a hundred billion dollar company.

[01:15] So, that's, so 10, 10 figures is a billion, 11, 12.

[01:20] A 12 figure company.

[01:21] There you go.

[01:22] And just the only thing that rivals the business success

[01:27] that he has is that the humility that he brings to it.

[01:30] He was willing to hop on a call with me before this.

[01:33] And we hit it off.

[01:35] And I was like, I just, I know my audience would love to talk to you.

[01:39] And just kind of hear your perspective of entrepreneurship.

[01:41] And you have such an interesting story that I think will relate to so many people

[01:44] in my audience from the people who are just trying to figure out what they want to do

[01:49] to make money all the way to, you know, right now the 20% of my audience is,

[01:53] you know, winning entrepreneurs with, you know,

[01:56] large companies and so forth.

[01:58] So we just have the game from an entrepreneurship perspective kind of the beginning middle

[02:01] end.

[02:02] And yeah.

[02:03] So thank you so much for taking time to join us today.

[02:05] It's great honor to be here, Alex.

[02:06] Thank you so much.

[02:07] I mean, big fan of the pod.

[02:08] And I think what you're doing is making business entrepreneurship.

[02:11] I mean, very similar to the mission of the job that you're making it more accessible.

[02:15] And I think that is the coolest thing in the world,

[02:17] this idea that business was out of touch for most people,

[02:20] both financially from a capital perspective or because of knowledge and

[02:24] insight and experience, I think those days are long over.

[02:27] And I think we're going through an entrepreneurial renaissance right now.

[02:30] And I think how people like you and your community is leading the way on

[02:34] in that front.

[02:35] Why I appreciate it.

[02:37] And I mean, everything that we do is just for everybody on the pod is,

[02:40] and it will hardly not agree on this.

[02:42] It's to just try and break down as many barriers between where people are and where they

[02:47] want to be, right?

[02:48] A lot of people have this vision for their lives.

[02:49] They want and there are things to get in their way.

[02:51] Some of them are between your ears.

[02:53] Some of them are between your hands and keyboard.

[02:55] And so Shopify is taking a lot of that between hands and keyboard out of the way that

[02:58] it decreased the friction of actually getting a product launch,

[03:01] get it online, actually get customers and you can do it from anywhere in the world.

[03:04] Which is again, something that 30 years ago just wasn't really a thing.

[03:07] And now everyone can have access to this stuff.

[03:10] So I'm going to go, I'm going to kind of break this pod into three kind of sections loosely.

[03:16] So first kind of chunk, I want to talk about looking back.

[03:19] I want to relate to a lot of people who are listening or watching right now.

[03:22] Kind of like zero to hero.

[03:24] Like what, what got you to hear and all the things that that come with that.

[03:28] Second chunk will go over.

[03:30] What's hero to super hero?

[03:32] Right?

[03:33] Like what is what's the fourth?

[03:34] What's forward?

[03:35] Look like what's the future?

[03:36] Like what do you see?

[03:37] And I'll dive into some more specific details around that stuff.

[03:40] And then at the very end, we'll go kind of like final nuggets and wrapping it up of like

[03:44] forward and backwards.

[03:45] What are kind of like the principles and truths that you would try and pass on to people?

[03:48] Who are listening?

[03:49] Go on.

[03:50] Let's do it.

[03:51] That's our roadmap.

[03:52] So I know a little bit about this story, but my audience does it.

[03:56] So you have this really unique thing of being employee one and customer one.

[04:01] Can you walk us through like just the beginning of shop of like even the decision to jump into Shopify?

[04:08] What, what the risk server associated with that?

[04:10] What was like prior to that?

[04:11] And then like what were the the factors that got you into that?

[04:16] So I was born in Montreal, boarding Canada.

[04:18] I moved to South Florida with my parents and my sisters when I was very young.

[04:22] I was always entrepreneurial.

[04:24] My parents did not have a lot of money.

[04:26] But my father to his credit.

[04:29] My dad's an immigrant.

[04:30] He came to Canada from Hungary in the revolution.

[04:33] My grandparents, a Holocaust survivors.

[04:35] And we were poor immigrants.

[04:37] And although my dad never had much money to give me.

[04:41] Because I always had these little silly business ideas when I was a kid.

[04:47] What my dad did for me, which was very valuable was even like when I was a 10 years old.

[04:51] Every silly business idea that I had, he would validate it by actually making me these business cards that would say the name of the business and my name on it.

[04:59] And I'm now a dad.

[05:01] I have two daughters, Bailey and Zoe who are five and seven.

[05:04] And now that I think about parenting and stuff.

[05:07] I think a lot more about that story and those stories of my father making those business cards because at the time it didn't seem that profound.

[05:15] And in hindsight now as father myself, I realize these small things that we do for our kids had this massive impact.

[05:21] And so even though these business were all very silly, trading like trading cards and lemonade stands.

[05:27] And eventually a DJ business when I was 13 years old.

[05:30] I was always an entrepreneurial kid.

[05:33] And partially is because I thought entrepreneurship was this fun activity.

[05:36] Like I wasn't really into sports playing them or watching them.

[05:39] I wasn't really into video games.

[05:41] I was kind of into this idea of like, you know, selling something.

[05:44] And that was always fun for me.

[05:45] Move to self-lora.

[05:47] Went finish high school there and moved back to Canada when I was 17 2001 to go to McGill University.

[05:53] McGill is in Montreal where I live now.

[05:55] I went to McGill because it was cheap.

[05:57] My parents didn't have much money.

[05:59] But because I was born in Canada, I kind of got this like in-state tuition thing.

[06:03] Unfortunately, very quickly.

[06:05] And once I moved to Montreal to sort of McGill, my dad got some trouble and our family lost everything.

[06:12] And once again, I sort of, you know, pulled out this tool that I'd been tinkering with throughout my life called entrepreneurship.

[06:19] To to make some money.

[06:20] I started a t-shirt business when I was at McGill.

[06:22] Meat teachers for a bunch of universities across Canada.

[06:25] Like the promotional t-shirts you got the first day of school.

[06:27] Frought, Frought, Frought, orientation stuff.

[06:30] And I loved it.

[06:31] It was great.

[06:32] I wasn't necessarily passionate about t-shirts, but I love this sort of idea of being able to support myself and help my family.

[06:40] I was really,

[06:42] You know, I'm really quick because I think it's going to be a good job.

[06:44] I'm really quick.

[06:45] Jump in anyway.

[06:46] The point that I really just made, I just went on to online, which is that the first business he had.

[06:50] One, I don't think that you thought this was going to be the business I will have for the rest of my life.

[06:55] This is my dream.

[06:56] This is my vision.

[06:57] You were trying to make money.

[06:58] Right.

[06:59] Tell us.

[07:00] And I think a lot of people who are aspiring are trying to find this like perfect puzzle piece that's going to fit all of these things.

[07:07] It's going to be my passion.

[07:08] It's going to be fulfilling.

[07:09] It can be the next Amazon.

[07:10] When a lot of times, I think it's a big fallacy because the first business just gives you a little bit of light to show you the next step to take is because you learn a bunch of stuff from that first business.

[07:19] That's right.

[07:20] And so I just want to just take the pause for the audience that everyone's like, I got to find the perfect thing when.

[07:24] Promotion for a freshman in sophomores.

[07:26] It's glamorous.

[07:27] Right.

[07:28] It's not glamorous.

[07:30] And in fact, the only unfair advantage that I had was that I was selling t-shirts to a customer who was who I also was part of that demographic meeting.

[07:40] I was selling t-shirts to the student council, treasurer or procurement office.

[07:44] So they can give them a students and I myself was a student.

[07:47] And so the pitch that I made was that one, I very low overhead because it's just me.

[07:51] I was I was the CEO and the janitor.

[07:53] I was I was printed t-shirts myself.

[07:55] So one, I'm going to be cheaper to.

[07:57] I'm going to care a lot because I really need this to work in three.

[08:00] I'm going to make t-shirts for people like me.

[08:02] And so I kind of know what your students want because I myself and one of your students.

[08:06] Just to go step back because I'm thinking so super interesting.

[08:09] So I sort of skipped over this, but when I was 13 years old, the business that really got.

[08:14] Start like started me in entrepreneurship.

[08:16] A real business was against 13.

[08:18] So you know, I wouldn't put too much, you know,

[08:22] Credence on the fact there was a real business, but it was a real thing was I wanted to be a DJ.

[08:26] I was Jewish.

[08:27] I went to a lot of bar mitzvahs when I was 13 years old.

[08:29] And I thought the DJs were the coolest people in the world.

[08:32] They were so different magicians in my mind.

[08:35] They would take a group of people that were sitting down, eating some rubber chicken dinner in some hotel ballroom.

[08:41] And like three minutes later, using their voice and using lighting and music,

[08:45] they would be a conglying.

[08:46] I just thought they were just, they were like magicians.

[08:48] I'd called around a bunch of DJ companies to ask them if they would hire me.

[08:52] And of course they said no because I was 13 had no experience and didn't know how to DJ.

[08:57] But because I had this sort of, you know, like silly confidence that these business cards had provided for me,

[09:03] I had this idea to start my own DJ company and hire myself.

[09:06] So that was sort of when this idea of entrepreneurship as a tool to solve problems was sort of cemented in my,

[09:14] in my very, you know, immature young brain.

[09:17] And then when I needed to make money again at 17, I was an undergrad on college.

[09:21] I once again, I didn't even think about, you know, I should go get a job somewhere.

[09:25] Immediately, my thought was, alright, I got to start another business to make some money here.

[09:29] So it began to form this, what is now effectively my, I think a Shopify mission.

[09:34] It's also my personal mission, which is an entrepreneurship is this incredibly powerful tool because it's democratic.

[09:41] And it allows anyone and anybody around to start something with very little.

[09:45] And it doesn't matter who you are, what your last name is and who your parents are, my parents work with nobody's.

[09:49] It matters how much value you add.

[09:52] And so I ran this teacher business, author of college, and developed a really good set of mentors along the way.

[09:58] People that I sort of met and some people were lawyers and others were these random entrepreneurs.

[10:03] And, you know, dove Charney from American Apparel.

[10:05] Now he sort of, I guess, disgraced, but at the time he was a very big deal, starting American Apparel.

[10:10] He was another Jewish entrepreneur from Montreal and I met these people along the way.

[10:14] And one of those, one of those mentors convinced me, just when I finished college to go to law school, not to become a lawyer, but rather to become a better entrepreneur.

[10:25] Almost like finishing school for entrepreneurship.

[10:27] And I was incredibly impressionable.

[10:30] I was 21 when I was finishing college.

[10:32] I got ahead a little bit of money from the teacher, but not much.

[10:35] And he said, look, I'm going to teach law next year at the University of Ottawa, which is the capital of Canada.

[10:39] Why don't you come to Ottawa?

[10:41] Go to this go to law school here.

[10:42] I'll be in town.

[10:43] I can sort of help you now to get the city.

[10:45] And you'll go to law school, not with the mandate to get call to the bar or ever litigate or practice law.

[10:51] But rather, as a way to accumulate more skills, and we very valuable as you think, but scaling a business longer term.

[10:58] And so I was 2005 moved to Ottawa.

[11:00] No friends, no family there.

[11:02] And by this point, entrepreneurship was a part of my identity.

[11:07] And so like I always did when I moved to a new place, I asked where the entrepreneurs hung out.

[11:12] And very, very fortunately, very luckily, I was directed to a coffee shop.

[11:16] And I was told that there's a group of entrepreneurs that hung out of this coffee shop every Friday evening.

[11:22] And they called themselves the young entrepreneurs club, the YEC.

[11:26] And I started showing up there every Friday and meeting these young entrepreneurs.

[11:31] And one of those entrepreneurs was this brilliant programmer named Toby,

[11:36] who had just moved to Canada a couple of years earlier from Germany.

[11:40] And he moved to Canada because you met a girl and he wanted to go to close the girl.

[11:44] I mean, he was all people moved for that reason, right?

[11:46] Very good reason.

[11:47] But love is always a good reason to move somewhere.

[11:49] And Toby had moved to Canada from Germany.

[11:51] He didn't have papers to work.

[11:53] And so he was told that even as a new immigrant, he could start a business.

[11:56] And being in Canada where it's very cold, a lot of snow, he loved snowboarding.

[12:00] He decided he wanted to build a snowboard shop on the internet.

[12:04] In 2005, there were two ways to sell a product on the internet.

[12:08] The first way was to sell a through a marketplace.

[12:12] The time like eBay was really the most prominent one.

[12:15] Amazon, I don't think at the time alive for third party sellers.

[12:18] It was still a first party marketplace.

[12:20] So eBay, and you had a bunch of these sort of very nichey marketplaces.

[12:23] But eBay being the big one.

[12:25] So you could sell on a marketplace or you would pay a company like IBM,

[12:29] they had WebSphere or or Colour, AT or SAP.

[12:34] All these big enterprise companies had some sort of e-commerce functionality for very large enterprises,

[12:39] for like Walmart.

[12:40] And that would be like a couple million bucks.

[12:43] And Toby did not like the idea of renting customers from a marketplace.

[12:47] And he did not like the idea what he didn't have a million dollars to spend on enterprise software.

[12:52] So that was impossible.

[12:53] So we wrote this piece of software using Ruby on Rails,

[12:56] where he was a sort of core developer of Ruby on Rails in the early days with DHH,

[13:00] a bunch of really interesting people.

[13:01] And he wrote this piece of software to sell his snowboards.

[13:04] And that's run time where I met him.

[13:06] He was just selling these snowboards.

[13:08] And it was a really neat little business.

[13:10] He was making real money.

[13:11] And around that and again, I was I'm in law school now.

[13:14] And so I'd ask him if I can use the software to sell my own products,

[13:19] which in my case would be T-shirts.

[13:21] And by that point, he'd already sort of figured out that the snowboard business was a good idea.

[13:25] But the software that he'd written to sell these snowboards was a great idea.

[13:29] And shortly thereafter I ended up building a store on Shopify.

[13:33] This is 2006 at the time.

[13:35] And I became one of the first people to use what would become at the time it was called

[13:39] Jated Pixel.

[13:40] It was actually called Shopify originally.

[13:42] And I would be one of the first people to use the software.

[13:45] And I built this, I ran this T-shirt business.

[13:48] Direct to consumer, license T-shirt business,

[13:51] all throughout law school.

[13:54] And that was sort of my first entry into Shopify meeting Toby.

[13:57] And then when I finished a grad school, I called Toby.

[14:01] And said, look, like, I love entrepreneurship.

[14:04] It's everything.

[14:05] I think it's the greatest thing for me.

[14:07] It's my passion, my hobby.

[14:08] I want to increase the surface area for more people.

[14:12] And honestly, what I experienced building a beautiful, scalable store sitting in my tax law class on Shopify.

[14:20] I think more people should experience that.

[14:23] And I joined him about a year later in 2009 or so.

[14:27] And I was like the first non-engineered a joint in the company.

[14:31] And it was amazing.

[14:33] It was one of the greatest, I mean, I just,

[14:35] it was, I have really fun memories of those very, very, really days.

[14:38] But that's a long answer to a question of how I got the Shopify.

[14:41] No, this is perfect.

[14:42] Because this is a great pause point.

[14:43] Because I was writing down some notes just for the audience.

[14:46] And then I want to definitely, we're going to go from like, okay.

[14:49] You're now in Shopify and whatever,

[14:52] it draws into relations.

[14:53] Because of course, I'm sure going from that to a hundred billion was probably just straight line, very smooth sailing,

[14:58] you have any issues.

[14:59] And I'm sure everyone will be glad to hear that very short story.

[15:02] But we'll get to that one.

[15:03] But just remember who's listening.

[15:05] No, number one, the first business that Harley started was just for money.

[15:10] And it wasn't just some magical thing that was going to be perfect.

[15:12] He did what he had to do.

[15:13] And he learned how to skills that really valuable on the way.

[15:16] And the second thing is that, and I want to emphasize this is,

[15:19] be what a lot of times you're like, man, I don't know what to sell or what business should I start.

[15:23] And I think the easiest one to use is just solve your own problem.

[15:26] Scratch your own inch.

[15:27] But like, almost every business I've had,

[15:29] well, every, every really good business I've had has come from that,

[15:32] which is like, like, I mean, even the, the furthest one we have now,

[15:35] because I'm not comfortable with the family office.

[15:37] And I wish I had had this available to me when I was scaling up our companies,

[15:40] like somebody who'd already been there sold most times in like had a best interest, et cetera.

[15:44] But scratching your own inch.

[15:46] Also, I want to highlight some people kind of get segments in one thing or the other,

[15:49] like, you did a physical product business, but earlier you've done a DJ thing,

[15:52] even though it was not, yeah, you made money.

[15:55] So you made a profit and so like in my mind, like self employed, whatever,

[15:58] like it was a service business.

[15:59] So you had a service business and you also had a physical product with super flexible

[16:02] in terms of how you were willing to make money.

[16:04] I was agnostic to what I was selling.

[16:06] I mean, to your point, you know, I think what the easiest way is to figure out what to sell.

[16:11] You know, you said scratch your own inch.

[16:13] Another way to do it is simply just to like tell a bunch of people that you're thinking of starting a business

[16:17] and just leave it out in the ether.

[16:19] The reason that I started selling T-shirts universities was as I told people that my dad

[16:24] wasn't around anymore.

[16:25] Mom had no money.

[16:26] I needed to make some money and he's sort of business.

[16:28] The more people I spoke to about that, a lot of the ideas that I got were dumb,

[16:32] but more and more people started telling me, hey, what about this?

[16:35] Hey, what about that?

[16:36] Most of the things that they mentioned were not great ideas.

[16:39] But then someone randomly, his name is Jamie once told me,

[16:42] remember this like they perfectly clear it.

[16:44] He said, hey, just so you know, Miguel spends $25,000 a semester on T-shirts,

[16:51] on printed promotional T-shirts.

[16:54] It turned out he was wrong.

[16:56] These universities spent a quarter million dollars.

[16:58] I was looking to see what I did.

[17:00] But because I was putting it out there, this thing that I was looking to sort of business,

[17:04] a bunch of people sort of became almost like my idea general.

[17:08] My idea generation machine.

[17:10] And so this whole idea that like, I know there's a lot out there about like,

[17:13] don't tell people your goals and and and keep things to yourself.

[17:17] I call bullshit.

[17:18] I think do things and tell people is super important.

[17:20] Even at the early stages of starting these things.

[17:24] Well, I mean, my second book, 100 million old leads advertising is the process of making them.

[17:28] And so if no one knows about your stuff, no one can buy it.

[17:31] They must first know about it in order to buy it.

[17:33] And so if you just think about it from the first principles perspective,

[17:36] you know, I don't know if you don't know if you don't know.

[17:38] So it's right.

[17:39] So it's right.

[17:40] So two things that I also want to highlight.

[17:42] So you talked about two different types of people that you surrounded yourself with.

[17:45] One was mentors.

[17:46] So just for everyone in my honest, we're talking people ahead, right?

[17:49] And the other thing was the community of peers right here, the coffee shop,

[17:52] where you met Toby, who ultimately, you know, got got you into the same again by chance.

[17:56] But both of those things increase your luck surface area.

[17:58] The amount of different potential opportunities for exposing opportunity.

[18:01] Bro.

[18:02] Yeah.

[18:03] So I just want to highlight that because a lot of people feel like entrepreneurship is lonely and it can be.

[18:08] But two degree it is a choice right. And if you can't physically move environments,

[18:12] you can do it online now. And that was an available back then.

[18:15] But now we've got on like communities, you got school, we've got, you know,

[18:18] all these things where people can connect.

[18:20] And when I say school, SKOL dot com school, people can actually connect and meet one another.

[18:25] All right. Now the last one is resource one instance is kind of ties well into kind of the next the next chapter of this journey,

[18:32] which is that like you did all this stuff like you.

[18:38] Toby wrote code so that he could so you could sell his snowboards, right?

[18:44] Like there's just there's this whole like everything, of course, our whole mission is to make things easier.

[18:49] Make things more accessible to people. But on some level, like it's the fact that it becomes difficult is what makes the goal worthwhile.

[18:56] Right? And if everyone could do it, then everyone would do it.

[19:00] And then it would no longer be worthy, right? Everyone can tie their shoes. Everyone can get dressed. And so no one's like congratulations.

[19:05] There's this whole, I think Chris rocks get where he's like, what do you want to cookie?

[19:09] He's like, man, I never been prison. He's like, you need supposed to go to jail, right?

[19:13] And he goes to Saltvegan. So right now, like the fact that it's difficult is just another barrier that somebody might have to be able to have to go over.

[19:18] And so it gives you yourself a little stripe that you can show yourself about who you really are.

[19:24] All right. Also remember, remember this, you kind of think about like, if you kind of go back to you,

[19:28] I don't know, go back to 200 years. And you think about starting a business.

[19:31] The one thing that decides capital gets started and knowledge and understanding and technology to help you do it.

[19:37] Forget all that stuff for a second.

[19:39] One of the big risks of starting a business historically was that the cost of failure could affect your life in a very adverse way.

[19:47] Meaning when my grandfather came to North America from Eastern Europe, he started an egg business. He had a little egg stall at a local farmers market,

[19:56] which actually still stands today. My uncle currently runs it.

[19:59] But he had to take a loan out on his home in order to afford the fee and the cost of actually renting this particular stall.

[20:08] If this did not work, the result of that would be no food on the table, no roof over their head.

[20:15] And that is effectively how businesses were built so that people with more capital were able to take more risks.

[20:21] People that are more capital able to invest more. People that are more capital were able to have, you know,

[20:26] be able to mitigate the cost of failure.

[20:29] Well, one thing that has changed dramatically, and I would say today, like literally right now Alex, you know,

[20:34] I'm talking about this, the cost of failure of starting a business today is by far the lowest it's ever been.

[20:40] Whether you use a product like Shopify or use whatever you decide to do, the cost of failure is effectively $39.

[20:48] If it works, you scale it.

[20:50] Literally like three feet from me, I have a gift from Ben Francis, who's the founder of Jim Shark.

[20:56] And it's a Christmas gift to give you a holiday gift to give me.

[20:58] If the original screen print from the original Jim Shark, the first t-shirt he made, it was, it was Ben's been a big part of my life.

[21:06] And I've been, I think, a big part of his life. And so his gift was the original screen that could the first t-shirt for Jim Shark.

[21:14] When Ben started, it was 2012 out of his dorm room.

[21:17] If it would have gone, if it would have failed, what had gone back to class?

[21:21] I mean, he was literally also delivering pizzas. I think for pizza ahead of the time, if I get that right, or some pizza company.

[21:27] But if it worked, he would go on to build a multi-billion dollar company called Jim Shark.

[21:33] So think about that, the upside, and that was 2012, that was like, you know, 12 years ago.

[21:38] The upside today of starting a business is effectively infinite growth. If you do it well in your smart and running great value.

[21:44] The downside is a couple less cups of coffee or a couple less Starbucks for that week.

[21:50] That is remarkable.

[21:52] And I think that, I mean, if there's anything that a couple of figures, one underlying point here, it's the, it's risk adjusted return.

[22:00] Right, is that everyone here now can get endless shots on goal.

[22:02] Right now, because of how accessible entrepreneurship is, you basically just keep taking lottery tickets.

[22:07] And if you lose, then you just buy another scratch off, right, and you try it again.

[22:12] And so you still have the upside, except the thing is, is it's not rigged for you to lose.

[22:15] Like, there actually is a lot of people who want you to win, and there's an entire economy around you.

[22:20] Well, not just that right now, what that's created is nearly a quarter, 25% of US consumers in 2024 are considering starting a business.

[22:28] That's the highest I believe it's ever been.

[22:31] Number two is, since 2021, there's been 15.5 million new business applications in the US in 85% increase from 2004 to 2021.

[22:42] The White House put out a bunch of stats on this recently.

[22:44] I mean, that is the reason that is happening is not just because technology is getting better, and not just because of great podcasts like, and content like you're putting out there.

[22:52] It's because people are realizing entrepreneurship may be the vehicle for them to actually find their life's work,

[22:58] make their life better, create independence, like do the thing that they love most.

[23:03] This is a pretty exciting time for entrepreneurship, and I think the cost of failure thing is a big part of it.

[23:09] So now you're employee number one, not non developer employee number one.

[23:14] You've used the product, you fell in love with it, and this is now aligned with your calling.

[23:19] So walk me through kind of the, give us stages of growth, and if you can give kind of like internal external.

[23:25] So this is what's happening externally, maybe revenue levels, customer level, things like that, and then mirrored.

[23:31] What does that look like internally? So I'm shifting a little bit towards my business owners right now.

[23:35] All right, so now we're talking like, okay, we've got the business where we're generating revenue, or is it cash flow positive, did they even investor like how how what's yeah just give me the scoop.

[23:45] So we were bootstrapped.

[23:47] We had a very, very small angel investor in early on, which is him as John is his, is now a multi billionaire I believe.

[23:57] And so is his wife separately, because she also puts a money in, but it was a very small amount of money.

[24:02] We were bootstrapped, we were profitable, and when I joined, we didn't have a CFO, we didn't have a CMO, I mean, part of what I viewed my role as, and anyone who's listening.

[24:14] Who is joining a very early stage company as a non engineer at the person not running, you know, writing code or building product.

[24:24] The role that I wanted to, that I felt I should play, and then I think I did play was the Swiss Army knife.

[24:29] Let me figure out everything and anything that is going to be valuable to the people that are writing code, and whether that's commercialization or sales or support, or, I mean, literally figuring out like where we're going to like work at.

[24:42] Like like figure, the notion the least for it or figuring out, you know, what are we who repaying for it? I think we're paying rack space at that the time like negotiating a rack space contract.

[24:52] I think at the time we only had one payment integration, which was the PayPal negotiating the PayPal revenue share.

[24:57] It was very early days. This sort of Swiss Army and I've type bottle, I think was really, really important because, I mean, the, the, you can be the greatest sales person or marketer in the world.

[25:08] If you have a great product matched with a great ability to sell and commercialize, that's where this thing gets really interesting.

[25:14] And I deeply believe that Shopify even back, you know, in 2010 had this incredible product.

[25:20] It leaps and bounds better than all the competition. The competition at the time was like Yahoo stores are a couple other like that, but very, very few competitors.

[25:29] And so this idea of being a Swiss Army knife was important. And that's what I did.

[25:33] And I, you know, if there was an opportunity for me to tell the story publicly to a local newspaper and in Ottawa, Canada, I would take that opportunity.

[25:40] If there was an opportunity for me to help someone get a job done internally, I would take that opportunity.

[25:45] But that Swiss Army knife was, that, that sort of model of that was very, very helpful.

[25:50] And as part of that, I think I earned the trust of, of, of, Tobian particular, but also, you know, the, the other engineers because I was just there to add value.

[26:01] That's it. In fact, I, I'd actually been called to the bar and so I think my, like, I was, I was also the company's lawyer. And again, I, I'd been out of law school for all of 10 months, I think, at that point.

[26:12] But whatever I could do, I was going to do that. And it was only a couple years later. We raised our series A, but a year later.

[26:19] And I think it was a $7 million investment from Bestomer who led it on a $25 million, I think, post.

[26:27] And then, and that's really when we began to realize that, okay, there is a real there there. This company could be something remarkable, large, scalable.

[26:35] And we can really make a dent on. At the time, it was really, but we were focused on SMBs and e-commerce only very different than today, where we do business ball sizes and retail everywhere.

[26:46] But it was SMBs and, and it was, it was e-commerce only. And it was only until, you know, after a series B and C that we began really figuring out, like, okay,

[26:55] what, what are each other superpowers? And, and this idea of rather than all of us become these sort of well-rounded objects, these sort of riverstones,

[27:03] what if we were all, we're very precise on the thing that we think we could be the best in the world at?

[27:08] And spend our time with the level that you start doing that. So if we're walking through this, because right now,

[27:12] probably, probably like around series B or series C, we began, we hired a CFO, we hired a CMO, we hired a CMO,

[27:18] we hired a CMO. And it was around that time where we felt we were well-capitalized. I think our series B was about 100 million dollar valuation.

[27:27] This is like 2013 or so. And around that time.

[27:31] So like, don't, I know I am used.

[27:34] Okay. Yeah, and not sure. A lot less than $100 million.

[27:37] You mean, the employees were around there, just I'm just trying to give you a...

[27:40] Probably, probably 50 to 100 at that point.

[27:43] Yeah, okay, got it. So like little small mid-sized. Got it. Yeah, okay. Cool.

[27:47] And a lot of what we were trying to do then is like find, you know, find at least a lot of how I spend my time

[27:52] is finding new channels. This idea that, okay, we can only sell so many people on Shopify, but there's this massive ecosystem of lead agencies and freelancers and developers who are in Oklahoma and are in, you know, places like South America and they're in Singapore and they're in Vancouver and they're in, you know,

[28:11] new Mexico and what if we actually created something whereby if someone walked into their agency to their business and said, I need an online store, what could we do to actually make it so that they would say by default, great. We'll build it on Shopify.

[28:25] That sort of only referral site. On the product site, another thing that was really, that we created around that time was

[28:32] the shop by App Store, which I believe today is one of the largest ecosystems of third-party developers on the planet.

[28:38] I mean, if you were building an app for commerce today, the best most effective go-to-market strategy is to put it in the shop by App Store because you have millions of customers for applications.

[28:48] That, that now seems, you know, polished and, and a really healthy kind of flywheel of an ecosystem.

[28:54] But originally the reason that the app store was really set up was all these different merchants were coming to us and they all had a very unique and a very particular business.

[29:03] And so we really focused on let's make Shopify's core offering would most people need most of the time.

[29:09] Check out payments inventory, marketing analytics. Let's make that like world class.

[29:15] But everything that is very specific to a particular merchant's business, let's invite third parties from all over the world to build apps on top of it.

[29:22] Which meant that no matter what the particular needs your business might be, you would find 100% product market fit using Shopify because this app ecosystem

[29:31] and we didn't have to build everything ourselves, which would have been impossible.

[29:35] And so some of these things now in hindsight seem like, wow, shop is ecosystem is really cool and the app store is is humming.

[29:41] But originally it was done because we couldn't build every feature ourselves nor should we.

[29:46] So what were some of the like absolute key decisions or like business principles that you learned kind of scaling through this?

[29:54] Focus was really important not being everything to everyone. I mean today, you know, last week was was the National Retail Federation's Big Show literally like the most important conference in enterprise retail.

[30:06] And I still on the board now of NRAF with like the likes of the CEO of, you know, Brian from Target and John from Walmart and like, you know, these amazing people like that run effectively all of retail all over the world.

[30:20] And so now we're really obviously, you know, getting some of the biggest retailers you Shopify, but there was absolutely no way we were even considering that in those days because fundamentally we wanted to win our particular market, which was SMBs in English speaking countries that want to sell on the internet.

[30:38] And so one thing that was really valuable was like focus, don't sort of, and a lot of our competitors by the way ended up going out of business because they kind of ran up market way too soon and they left the entire base of SMBs available.

[30:51] They didn't like the idea that SMBs, you know, some churn and not every business succeeds and we thought, well, what if we just slightly increase the chance of success and mitigate at the risk.

[31:02] If every single person thinking about starting a business like in a shower in the morning, then did so with Shopify even though not all will succeed as long as the ones that do stay with us indefinitely, they will offset the cost of ones that leave.

[31:17] And so one was really making sure we were very, very focused. The second thing that was really important to us, I think, was that the product was super simple.

[31:25] And, you know, now companies like, I don't know, Mars or or metal or staples or you know, glossier, aloeoga view or all these amazing brands all you Shopify skims like, and what's neat even today, but Shopify is that the complexity of the product almost reveals itself over time.

[31:45] And then simply being in a date with every single feature and functionality shop of, I can be used by someone just setting up a store for mom's kitchen table.

[31:52] It also can be used by Trina who runs Figs, which is a public-it-rated company. They make uniform scrubs, uniform scrubs, and the fact that the same code base can make those things was something that was always important to keep it really, really simple.

[32:09] And I credit to Toby and his sort of vision around product because that's really what he, he drilled in all of us was that the product has been incredibly simple. So first is focus, second is simplicity. And the third one was, we really tried to run a really tight business, meaning we knew what our sort of cactel TV ratio is, so cost of customer acquisition on one side versus lifetime value. And as long I don't know if you're, I want to make sure I define all the acronyms.

[32:34] Yeah, well, I can't explain the things. Okay, okay. So we knew what our cactel TV ratio was and once we got it above one effectively, it meant that, okay, now it's time to go raise money because the more dollars you put on the left side, the more dollar 80s or whatever the ratio was we got on on the right side.

[32:51] And so by being meticulous and thoughtful about that, I think it was really helpful. Maybe the last thing I'll say, which seems a little bit soft, but it's important to say, we were really, really patient, meaning we want, like even today, we want to build a lot of things.

[33:03] We're not building 100 year business. We're now about 20 years into it. We got 80 years left to go, but even then we were, you know, 5, 8, 10 years in, we still thought about this, like really long term business focused, which meant that we were not willing to pull forward future profits at a discount, like pretty much most of our competitors, I think we're doing at that point.

[33:26] So what were some of the key growth, kind of levers that you were able to pull throughout this process that, like really accelerated, like if you had to name the three biggest things in the first 10 years of Shopify that, like, man, if we hadn't done this, we wouldn't have been able to get to the next level.

[33:41] I mean, I think the app store, the ecosystem was really important, both on making sure the product had a 100% product market fit.

[33:47] And also in the referral. So I think that was really important because it meant that we had, we had effectively distributed sales force that wasn't on our payroll.

[33:56] And just something small and that that really matters. I remember at the time, the Apple iOS store had an 80, 20 revsure split. So if you build something on on Apple, excuse me, how to 70, 30 revsure split.

[34:11] And you know what's going on with the app, you know what's going on with the app. You know what's going on with the app.

[34:21] You know what's going on with the app. You know what's going on with the app.

[34:26] And the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the app, the

[34:56] and we had an article in New York Times about it.

[34:58] But it started in a very simple way.

[35:01] We had met Tim Ferriss, I think in 2009 or so.

[35:05] And he became an advisor, and Tim is now a very good friend

[35:08] to both of mine, me and Toby, and that was pod.

[35:11] He's a great guy.

[35:11] But Tim looked at Shopify and said, great product.

[35:16] You guys are missing something.

[35:17] Most people, even though your product is great,

[35:20] easy to use, and you're making entrepreneurship more accessible,

[35:22] most people have a risk of version to some of entrepreneurship.

[35:25] For one of two reasons, either too expensive or they don't know how to use it.

[35:29] And he had this idea that we should create a competition whereby someone would

[35:33] start a brand new business on Shopify, like Jan won, and six months later,

[35:38] the store with the highest sales would win.

[35:42] I think we said $10,000, and then Tim said, it's got to be 100,000.

[35:46] We did not have $100,000 to give out that way, but what I was

[35:49] that, by the time the competition ended, we would actually have

[35:52] a type of money.

[35:54] And we launched the first build of business competition in 2010.

[35:58] And it got us, I think the article in New York Times, I have to go check,

[36:01] but I'm sure your listeners will keep me honest here.

[36:03] But I think it's like a startup starts their own startup competition,

[36:07] like launch their own startup.

[36:08] It was kind of a silly thing that we ourselves were starting

[36:11] in competition.

[36:12] The winner of that year was a company called DoDocase,

[36:13] the made these beautiful leather iPad cases.

[36:17] The iPad was coming out.

[36:19] And so that was one of those ways where, if you sort of read the

[36:22] Jeffrey Moore, I think it's different more cross in the

[36:25] Cazem book where he talks about technology adoption cycles go from

[36:28] a really adopter's domain stream.

[36:30] It felt like the build of business competition helped us

[36:33] cross the Cazem from really adopters to the mainstream.

[36:37] And over, I think we did the build of business competition for like

[36:39] five years after that.

[36:41] And ultimately, the stores were getting, like Jim Shark,

[36:44] one, one year, and like some mixedware, one, one year.

[36:49] Like these big companies ended up winning.

[36:51] But so we couldn't give out a hundred thousand anymore.

[36:53] So we had to come up with these new ideas.

[36:54] Like how do we incentivize the creation of businesses?

[36:57] And we did things like the winner would spend a week with Richard

[36:59] Branson on Necker Island and the winner would go and spend

[37:02] like go have lunch with Seth Goden.

[37:04] And so we created this really cool stuff.

[37:06] But I would say that probably the second sort of vector in terms of growth.

[37:09] We found a way for us to cross the Cazem.

[37:11] I just want a pause right there.

[37:13] I'm a huge fan of the build of business competition.

[37:16] Oh, you know about it.

[37:17] Oh, cool.

[37:18] Yeah, super super well equated with it.

[37:20] Oh, that's so.

[37:21] And now that was.

[37:21] Yeah, that was, I mean, that was something that was really,

[37:25] really important.

[37:26] Maybe the third thing that I think was probably really valuable

[37:29] was we began to look at what are the other things.

[37:32] Like what is the relationship that our product has

[37:34] and the lives of people that use it?

[37:36] And the relationship started to look like,

[37:40] when someone said they were going to work in the morning,

[37:43] what they meant was they were opening

[37:44] in their shop, I admin on their laptop,

[37:46] they're on their desktop.

[37:48] So if we were becoming the center of like their day to day work

[37:51] where they added products and fulfilled orders

[37:54] and added new skews and and ran marketing campaigns,

[37:57] what else can we do to be valuable to be helpful there?

[37:59] One thing that most people don't realize today,

[38:02] which is the case, I'll bring it back in a second,

[38:04] is that if you were to pretend today

[38:06] that Shopify was a single retailer,

[38:08] like if you were to aggregate all our stores,

[38:10] just in the US alone, we would be the second largest online

[38:13] retailer in America after Amazon.

[38:15] Okay, why is it important?

[38:17] Because if you were the second largest online retail in America

[38:21] and you go to negotiate rates with payment gateways

[38:24] and shipping companies and banks

[38:26] and all these different types of andcillary services,

[38:29] the economy of scale that you have is so massive.

[38:32] Well, even in the early days,

[38:34] back going back, I don't know, it's says 2013, 2014 or so.

[38:37] As we were thinking about adding new features,

[38:39] new functionality, we call merchandise solutions.

[38:41] We began to think of it in that way,

[38:42] whereby could we go and negotiate the best rates

[38:46] from the payment gateways as if we were the second largest retailer.

[38:49] We were in the second, we were the 20th at that point

[38:52] or the 30th at that point.

[38:53] But we were able to get economies of scale

[38:55] because of the aggregated size of our merchandise.

[38:58] And instead of keeping those economies of scale for ourselves,

[39:01] we gave them directly to the merchants.

[39:03] We took a little bit of margin

[39:04] because we wanted to make money.

[39:05] But we gave, so using Shopify to buy a domain,

[39:08] using Shopify to figure out who's going to process

[39:12] your credit card payments in your merchant gateway,

[39:15] it became much better to do it through us than do it on your own.

[39:19] And over time, that has turned into things like Shopify payments

[39:22] and Shopify capital and Shopify shipping.

[39:24] All these big parts are business today.

[39:26] We're built on this philosophy that we have an unfair advantage

[39:30] because these economies of scale.

[39:31] And if we give it to merchants,

[39:33] it means that Shopify plays an even larger role in their lives.

[39:37] So the three big growth strategies,

[39:39] the first one is you had referral partners.

[39:41] So you made it easy for other people to basically work

[39:43] on the platform and promote your platform

[39:45] because if you're a web agency and people want to store,

[39:49] then if you make it easy for them,

[39:50] and maybe they get some sort of financial incentive to be seen.

[39:52] And they got a revshare for it.

[39:53] Yeah, we get in the revshare, I think at the time, in perpetuity.

[39:55] Like 20% of whatever we took, they got.

[39:57] Which is awesome.

[39:58] Which is for an agency, as you probably know,

[40:01] like recurring cash, all this is king.

[40:03] Yeah, and it's interesting about it, it's on a business.

[40:06] Right.

[40:07] So basically, as long as the customer continues to sell stuff,

[40:13] you get a revshare basically for on the business,

[40:16] which is a great long term.

[40:17] I mean, it's an incentivizing offer.

[40:19] So also these agencies are not going to build

[40:21] their own e-commerce stack.

[40:23] So they need it someone, modest one, you Shopify.

[40:25] And I bring this up because a lot of the business owners

[40:27] that I have, they're like, how do I grow?

[40:29] And so that's why I wanted to really zero in on some of these growth strategies.

[40:32] So one is you had referral partners, you brought it.

[40:34] You were generous with them to the app developers

[40:36] and to the web stores, they got 20% of your cut, awesome.

[40:40] The second one was you had a really sexy competition.

[40:45] And so I've talked about this in terms of making offers

[40:47] to an audience as like how can we make it?

[40:49] So good people feel stupid saying that.

[40:51] And so for, I would say that obviously it worked.

[40:54] I mean, I've heard about it.

[40:55] We've modeled it at school.com.

[40:56] I just made the large investment I've been into a platform.

[40:59] So amazing.

[41:00] We saw that as we had the school games.

[41:02] And so we really looked at a lot of the stuff

[41:03] that you guys did there, try to make it fun.

[41:05] And but the key point is that you made it fun.

[41:09] You made it competitive.

[41:11] You got customers to compete against one another,

[41:13] but they're all winning.

[41:16] And this was one point I still wanted to ask.

[41:19] So is it was the New York Times, the only promotion

[41:22] that you did for that?

[41:23] Or was there other things that you did?

[41:25] Or like was it all word of Met?

[41:26] Like how do you have that?

[41:27] At this point, like when we started this,

[41:29] like Tim was just sort of coming out

[41:31] before our work week, I think was in its second edition.

[41:33] But he had this massive audience.

[41:35] And part of the cool part of the beauty and the value

[41:40] of working with Tim was not just to give us

[41:41] a great idea.

[41:41] But like great Tim, now you got to help us tell the world

[41:44] about it also.

[41:44] So if we would have gone to Tim with this idea,

[41:48] I don't know if he would have said yes.

[41:49] But the fact that it was like Tim's

[41:51] that we got Tim to generate an idea for us,

[41:53] it was his idea.

[41:54] He felt personally invested.

[41:55] And in fact, I've heard him say this on his own show,

[41:59] where he'll say like, you know,

[42:00] he's one of the co-founders of the build

[42:01] the business competition.

[42:02] I love that.

[42:03] Because we created a real vested interest in him

[42:08] to actually make this a success.

[42:10] And it wasn't just New York Times.

[42:11] I mean, there was a lot of articles written about it.

[42:13] But it also gave us a narrative, a thing

[42:16] that we were able to go around and talk about.

[42:17] It was difficult for me to go around and talk about,

[42:20] I'm a, you know, I'm sure I'll buy a cheap storyteller.

[42:22] It's, it was difficult for me to go around and talk about

[42:25] like software, Ruby on Rails or the simplicity of e-commerce.

[42:29] But it wasn't as difficult for me to go around and say,

[42:31] hey, we created this thing.

[42:32] We think everyone has, you know, Nike convinced the world

[42:36] that if you have a body, you're an athlete,

[42:39] like my, my blood.

[42:40] So, so brilliant.

[42:41] We were trying to go around convinced the world.

[42:42] If you have ambition, you could be an entrepreneur.

[42:45] And so I had now this new, beautiful asset,

[42:48] piece of ammunition that I was able to go around

[42:50] to media and to the,

[42:52] to anyone that would listen to me to blogs,

[42:53] to celebrities and say,

[42:54] there's a thing here.

[42:56] We'd love you to talk about it.

[42:57] And I go, that's kind of cool.

[42:58] That was really helpful.

[43:00] And so for the business owners at home,

[43:03] one big one obviously was Tim God and Ball.

[43:05] And so if you're like, how do I promote my business?

[43:07] Finding a brand champion or finding somebody who,

[43:10] I mean, if you've seen, I think is it air?

[43:14] That movie that's, it tells a story of Jordan's,

[43:17] like, yeah.

[43:18] So like, sometimes you need to find,

[43:20] like, if you were, like, if you have an audience

[43:22] awesome, then you already know what you're doing.

[43:23] But if you don't have an audience,

[43:24] you're more of a product person, and you're like,

[43:26] shoot, how do I get this to the world?

[43:27] Sometimes finding your Michael Jordan,

[43:29] and in this instance, Tim was probably the Michael Jordan

[43:32] for that era, for that entrepreneurship.

[43:34] It's a lot of entrepreneurship at that time.

[43:37] And so being willing to,

[43:38] and I'm sure that Tim had a good deal with Shopify

[43:41] for, I'm sure that there was a deal with Tim

[43:43] that worked out.

[43:44] Otherwise, for sure.

[43:45] That he's profited a lot from.

[43:47] And so sometimes you just gotta be really generous,

[43:49] like the Michael Jordan deals, first of its kind,

[43:51] it was kind of crazy, the founder,

[43:54] the film was like, I don't know,

[43:55] this is like, should I really go all in on this person?

[43:58] Sometimes you gotta make that.

[43:59] And obviously this bet paid off,

[44:00] Michael Jordan bet paid off.

[44:02] And so you come up with something really sexy,

[44:05] and then you find somebody who's the perfect fit for it,

[44:07] and then you put it together.

[44:08] And so just as like,

[44:09] and there's always a perfect fit, right?

[44:11] There's always someone out there,

[44:12] there's someone who, if you have a product,

[44:15] physical product or a space of soft,

[44:16] digital product,

[44:17] there is someone out there that has purchased from you,

[44:19] even if you're a small business,

[44:21] who probably has some sort of leverage,

[44:24] meaning they have an audience,

[44:25] they have a community, they have a big news letter,

[44:26] they have a big following,

[44:28] they know a bunch of people,

[44:29] if they have bought your product organically,

[44:32] and they have a connection to organically,

[44:34] you asking them,

[44:35] point blank, hey, I had this crazy idea,

[44:37] you seemed to like my, my, my T,

[44:40] and I would love to feature you in a promotion,

[44:43] would you be interested?

[44:44] That is very different than cold calling them

[44:46] and saying, hi, I'm parley from this T company,

[44:50] from Firebellity,

[44:51] and I love you to be a spokesperson,

[44:53] like I think the days by the,

[44:54] especially go back,

[44:55] like to come to present day for a second.

[44:57] The days of Brad Pitt,

[44:59] hooking, coal gator, or toothpaste,

[45:02] are over, nobody wants these artificial connections,

[45:05] or sponsorships.

[45:06] When you look at what Jimmy,

[45:08] Mr. Bees, is done with these tables,

[45:09] or Emma Chamberlain with coffee,

[45:11] or you see what Kim Kardashian is doing with,

[45:13] with skims,

[45:15] because these are all in Shopify,

[45:16] I have a very deep understanding these businesses.

[45:18] These are authentic real products

[45:22] that were built, curated, organized by these credible celebrities,

[45:26] who care so deeply about the product.

[45:29] So the days of artificial sponsorship,

[45:31] paid a play thing, I think are over.

[45:33] And I think what we did with build a business

[45:36] was almost showcase that,

[45:38] hey, Tim's, for some reason,

[45:40] interested in our business,

[45:41] hey Tim, how do you think we can go our business?

[45:43] Oh, that's a good idea.

[45:44] We'll do the competition,

[45:46] but by the way, we need your help for this competition.

[45:48] And it's really meta,

[45:50] I don't know, I just really want to hit on this,

[45:52] because this is what a lot of businesses need to run.

[45:55] They've got a product, they're like,

[45:56] how do I let people know about it?

[45:57] And obviously you can run ads or if you already have an audience,

[46:01] then you already know that stuff.

[46:02] But if you're like, well, shoot, how do I do it scrapping?

[46:05] And so making an incentive that gives people

[46:08] a big reason to say yes, finding a brand champion

[46:11] that already has distribution can be the unlock,

[46:15] because all of that acquisition is really just

[46:16] based on the negotiation you have with that one person.

[46:19] And if they can bring a lot,

[46:20] like, every, you have the opportunity

[46:22] to make a true win win,

[46:23] then obviously Shopify won and Tim won,

[46:25] and the main one, all of the people who built stores

[46:28] were the real winners here.

[46:30] And I'll bet you some of the winners on the stores

[46:32] also did the exact same strategy

[46:34] that course Shopify was also doing.

[46:35] And so you've got a T company,

[46:37] and they find Mrs. T on, I don't know,

[46:40] I don't know, I don't know,

[46:40] on Instagram, who just loves tries T's all day.

[46:43] It's like if she really did like the product,

[46:45] then she would be a spokesperson.

[46:47] And so just finding that out.

[46:47] Okay, cool.

[46:48] And then the third one, you said,

[46:50] and I want to see her run on this,

[46:51] was the con, so you said growth strategies,

[46:53] and you talked more about the economy of scale.

[46:55] Was that just that?

[46:56] Because that seems a little bit more product-oast.

[46:57] And I'm, I'm game for that.

[46:58] I just want to make sure that I, I, yeah.

[47:00] I think on that one, I mean, it's product focus,

[47:02] but it's also just simply like business focus.

[47:04] My, my ability to go and negotiate

[47:07] with a large payment gateway every year

[47:09] got easier and easier.

[47:10] Why?

[47:11] Because I was coming to them as a much larger merchant.

[47:14] Now, if you just take a very simple,

[47:16] you know, a very simple example.

[47:18] 10 individual merchants go to negotiate

[47:20] with the payment gateway on their own.

[47:21] They're already getting some rates.

[47:22] But if I do it in aggregate with all 10,

[47:25] my rate should be much, much better.

[47:27] And I can literally give those 10 merchants

[47:29] the exact same rates, you know, less maybe,

[47:32] you know, a couple of basis points

[47:33] that I want to keep it myself from profitability perspective.

[47:36] That kept getting bigger.

[47:38] It doesn't mean by the one we can talk about,

[47:39] you know, shop like, you know,

[47:40] like our, our whole shipping thing,

[47:42] because we dive vested,

[47:43] shopped by shipping, what's called SFN,

[47:45] shopper fulfillment network a couple of months ago.

[47:47] Oh, but you ever go at this point here.

[47:49] Because there are sometimes we have gone into areas

[47:51] that we're not main quest.

[47:53] We sort of call them side quests that maybe we shouldn't

[47:55] have done on our own.

[47:56] In fact, in the case of shipping,

[47:58] we found another company called Flexport,

[48:00] whose main quest is an end to end logistics platform,

[48:04] which is what we were trying to build ourselves

[48:05] and rather than build it ourselves,

[48:07] we're like, you just do it.

[48:08] And that, and what we can talk a bit about the value

[48:10] of what some companies are very, very good at partnership.

[48:13] I think shoppings one of those companies.

[48:15] If you look at what we've done with a firm

[48:16] for buying out pay later or globally around crossboard

[48:19] payments, we've pride ourselves in the company

[48:22] that is a really good company to partner with,

[48:25] which is very unique in tech,

[48:26] which is sort of all kind of frenemy, ask.

[48:29] Yeah.

[48:30] And I'm going to bring this to the brick and mortar

[48:33] car for actor.

[48:34] So just down to home base, those relationships

[48:39] don't need to be these massive billion dollar deals.

[48:41] Obviously they work at scale.

[48:42] But I think about my, I think, okay,

[48:45] so if I'm a cryo-practor, what are all the things that,

[48:48] anybody who's my customer also gets?

[48:50] They might go to the gym.

[48:51] They might like smoothies.

[48:53] They might like yoga, right?

[48:55] They might have other things that are ancillary.

[48:57] And I think, okay, well, what if I go to each of those businesses

[49:01] and say, hey, with every smoothie,

[49:03] just put a coupon you can slap it on there

[49:05] for a free adjustment.

[49:06] So they're going to get a free adjustment

[49:08] and a smooth, like you're going to enhance the value

[49:09] proposition that you have to hear customers

[49:11] at no cost to you.

[49:12] But then I get free leads.

[49:14] And so they get a win.

[49:16] And then I get free customers, or at least I free shot

[49:19] at a customer.

[49:20] And so these partnerships, and this has been a huge court

[49:23] at every business that I've built is,

[49:25] I think I've built almost the same amount of revenue

[49:28] from partnerships and affiliate relationships

[49:30] as I have just from actually direct sales

[49:32] and generally the Marseille.

[49:33] Because you were known as,

[49:35] I mean, you know, you and I know each other

[49:36] from our own communities, like,

[49:38] you were known as being a good partner,

[49:40] meaning you leave enough on the table

[49:42] so your partners can make money from it.

[49:44] You know, doctors actually just really, really well

[49:46] on their own referral side, meaning if you go to see a doctor

[49:49] and that doctor can help you great,

[49:51] they'll work on you.

[49:52] If they can't, they'll recommend someone else.

[49:55] If you, what I've noticed is that a lot of them

[49:57] like, it's almost like a closed loop circuit

[50:00] where Dr. A, if they can help you,

[50:03] always recommend Dr. B, who always recommend Dr. C.

[50:06] And Dr. C, always recommend Dr. A,

[50:08] and it's sort of this,

[50:09] I think if you're a chiropractor, for example,

[50:11] you, if you sort of venn diagram out, meaning you look

[50:14] at your customer base and you ask them,

[50:16] where do you go, where do you work at?

[50:17] What clothing do you like to wear?

[50:19] What, where do you go to get your smoothies, for example?

[50:21] You probably have your own version of that,

[50:24] but also the people hanging out in the smoothie bar

[50:26] are also asking the smoothie person,

[50:28] hey, do you only good chiropractors?

[50:29] And the yoga instructor is also saying,

[50:31] hey, I think you need a chiropractor as well.

[50:32] And so creating your own version of an affiliate program,

[50:35] even if it's not called an affiliate program,

[50:37] it's sort of your own creation of it,

[50:40] actually is incredibly effective.

[50:41] And if you over deliver,

[50:43] meaning every time the chiropractor recommends

[50:46] the yoga instructor, the yoga instructor's client

[50:50] comes back and says, man, that yoga instructor

[50:52] you recommended is amazing.

[50:54] You should send more clients to that yoga instructor.

[50:56] And so there is an opportunity to sort of over deliver

[50:59] to create even more leverage in this sort of closed

[51:01] ecosystem of reciprocity.

[51:04] And I'm going to give everyone three quick tips on this.

[51:06] Number one, if you're going to create one of these relationships,

[51:07] give them customers first.

[51:09] If you give them customers first, they're way more like

[51:11] send them five people and then make the call.

[51:13] Be like, hey, by the way, I thought maybe it makes sense

[51:15] if we did some, now they're going to want more of what you

[51:17] jave, just gave them.

[51:18] And they're going to be happy to talk.

[51:20] Second one is in terms of generosity.

[51:21] Like if you know what your cost to acquire customers,

[51:23] you should be willing to give at least that for a full

[51:26] two-way referral partner because either pay Zuck, right?

[51:29] Or you just pay another small business owner.

[51:32] And I can almost promise you that a referral from a partner

[51:34] is going to be worth more in LTV.

[51:36] So you still get a better LTV to cat ratio

[51:38] by going to a stronger channel with a referral partner.

[51:41] And one little thing that Laila's really good at this

[51:44] and she has just drilled it into me over time,

[51:46] which has been helpful for partnerships.

[51:47] She says, never count the other guys money.

[51:50] And so just because you're making someone else

[51:53] a ton of money, it has nothing,

[51:55] like if you take out how much that person makes

[51:58] and you just look at your side of the table,

[51:59] make the deal make sense for you.

[52:00] If they make a killing, awesome,

[52:03] they're going to be an amazing partner.

[52:05] And so I just want to underline that

[52:06] for because some of the mistakes I made early on

[52:08] as I wanted, I saw how much I would make,

[52:09] but I've lost deals because I got too greedy

[52:12] trying to say, well, he's going to make even more than me.

[52:14] And I would encourage you not to think that way

[52:15] because if everyone grows.

[52:17] It's such an amazing reminder.

[52:18] So I don't watch sports, I don't really play sports.

[52:20] So my Sunday project, this is a little weird and nerdy.

[52:23] But I have this project, it's called Big Shot.

[52:26] It's an archive that I'm creating

[52:27] of the greatest stories of the greatest Jewish entrepreneurs

[52:31] of the last half century.

[52:32] And so I'm meeting these people,

[52:33] most of them are in their 80s and 90s.

[52:35] And I sit down with them and I record it.

[52:37] I put on YouTube, it's not a big podcast.

[52:38] It's mostly a personal project, but it's fascinating.

[52:41] And I've sat down with people like Izzy Sharp,

[52:43] who's the founder of the Four Seasons Hotel,

[52:45] or a guy named Larry Silverstein,

[52:47] who's the owner of the World Trade Center.

[52:49] These were poor kids.

[52:50] I mean, these people grew up with nothing, zero.

[52:53] Or friend Wiesler, who's the queen of Broadway.

[52:55] These are very poor people that grew up

[52:57] and eventually they've created,

[52:59] they're billionaires and they've created empires.

[53:02] When you ask them at 90 years old,

[53:04] and I think Izzy Sharp from the Four Seasons Hotel

[53:07] is 95 years old.

[53:08] When you ask these people, tell me one or two things

[53:11] that I don't know, I turn 40s here, so Izzy,

[53:14] tell me something I don't know that I should at my age.

[53:17] Almost to the, I've done about 12 of these interviews so far

[53:20] with these like older icons and legends on Titans.

[53:24] Almost all of them to a T.C. make your partners really, really rich.

[53:30] Now, the reason I bring this up now is because

[53:33] these are people in their 90s who,

[53:35] they got nothing, you know, they're not trying to have swagger.

[53:38] They're not trying to like flex their so,

[53:41] and the reason I love hearing them is because they're so transparent.

[53:44] But to a T, every single one of them

[53:46] from these Titans of Industry in real estate

[53:48] to the Queen of Broadway has always made their partners

[53:53] incredibly rich.

[53:54] And that is not something that is intuitive,

[53:56] but it's something that I think is legitimate.

[54:00] I love this entire line of thinking because, I mean,

[54:08] it goes down to just more of abundance mindset.

[54:10] Most of the people that I know there were wealthiest

[54:12] in the world just don't see businesses zero some game.

[54:14] Right?

[54:15] It's just like everyone actually can win

[54:16] whereas in a lot of games, is it,

[54:18] it isn't structured that way,

[54:20] whereas even just the build of business competition

[54:22] you mentioned earlier, like, sure there was one winner.

[54:25] But do you think that number two to number 100

[54:28] on the list was like, oh man, I'm so bummed

[54:30] that I only got to a hundred.

[54:31] That's the craziest part.

[54:32] Number two, number 100, have built million-dollar brands also.

[54:37] And that's this idea of like,

[54:38] positive something, I think is so important.

[54:40] I know there's like, I'm an optimist

[54:42] and I know you were also Alex,

[54:43] but one thing that I think people misses,

[54:46] often when you go to raise money for those of you

[54:47] that are looking to raise money,

[54:48] one criticism you often get from investors

[54:51] is this concept of Tam, total address market.

[54:54] How big is your market?

[54:55] And effectively, what they're trying to say is that,

[54:57] if you look at your market, it's a pipe.

[55:00] And your Tam is effectively the pipe

[55:02] and your market share is the slice of the pipe.

[55:05] I think that's very flawed thinking.

[55:07] And I think if we would have done that a Shopify,

[55:09] we would not be a hundred billion dollar company.

[55:11] Our version was not, let's take a piece of the pie.

[55:13] Rather, let's grow the pie itself.

[55:15] And so we'll get to the IPO in a second,

[55:17] but we took our company public in 2015,

[55:20] made 2015 on the New York Stock Exchange.

[55:22] It was a billion dollar company at that point,

[55:24] so, but you know, one percent of the market cap that is today.

[55:29] At the time, every, before you go public,

[55:32] you win this road show.

[55:33] We did 93 meetings all over the US,

[55:35] and you're meeting these investors,

[55:37] and you're meeting these funds,

[55:38] and they want them to invest in these big funds

[55:39] that have trillions of dollars on their management.

[55:42] And this idea of Tam would come up over and over again.

[55:45] And I needed to have an answer for what the Tam was.

[55:49] And I remembered off by heart.

[55:50] It was, there are 46 million retail SMBs

[55:53] on the planet.

[55:54] I think at the time we had 100 or 300,000 of them.

[55:58] So big, big growth opportunity.

[56:00] Ironically, if you sort of, you know,

[56:02] we're now nine years past the IPO.

[56:04] If you look at Shopify today,

[56:06] a lot of our customers are not just SMBs.

[56:09] We have very large companies.

[56:10] We're also well beyond e-commerce.

[56:12] We have tons of merchants uses

[56:13] for point-to-sell physical retail.

[56:15] We have a capital business, a payments business.

[56:18] There was no way for them to actually,

[56:20] for me to give an answer,

[56:22] around Tam in terms of like foreshadowing

[56:25] what we would become.

[56:26] And so I love this idea that you're talking

[56:28] on which is like positive,

[56:29] some thinking and optimism,

[56:30] where share the wealth of other people around you,

[56:33] because rather than sort of thinking of the pie,

[56:35] a sort of this finite space,

[56:37] think about the pie is infinite,

[56:39] and encourage more people to participate.

[56:41] That's how you build these like

[56:43] generational, 100-year,

[56:45] multi-billion dollar companies.

[56:47] I talk to a fund manager,

[56:49] the day, and he was a public fund,

[56:52] and he was saying,

[56:53] you know, one of the things that I really like

[56:54] is that I've got 10,000 people praying

[56:57] that I win every night.

[56:59] Is that great?

[57:00] Yeah, and I think it's the exemplarist

[57:01] that's something to the degree of like,

[57:02] you can have whatever you want in life,

[57:03] as long as you have other people get what they want first.

[57:06] And I just really, really believe that,

[57:10] because I've actually feel like I've actually put

[57:12] some numbers to this,

[57:13] but I think that from an entrepreneurship perspective,

[57:16] it's about one-tenth.

[57:17] And what I mean by that is like,

[57:18] you get to keep about one-tenth of the wealth

[57:21] that you generate for other people.

[57:23] And so I've just seen that from like,

[57:25] the number of entrepreneurs that I look at,

[57:26] like how much the market cap,

[57:28] like, not market caps, the total revenue

[57:30] that's run through their platforms

[57:32] versus how much their equity stake is

[57:34] and what it's valued at.

[57:35] Like the amount of times that I've seen

[57:36] that equation done were like, it's 10x.

[57:39] Like you have to make 10 times the amount of money

[57:40] for other people, as you'll be able to bake,

[57:43] it's just been really cool.

[57:44] And I think framing it that way is like,

[57:46] how do I make everyone else

[57:47] and ton of money?

[57:47] Like, everyone loves doing business

[57:50] for someone who makes them money.

[57:51] And then they will want you to be doing business them.

[57:54] So, 22, our 23 numbers are not,

[57:58] yeah, Q4 earnings are coming at soon.

[57:59] So, can't talk with it, but I'll tell you last year.

[58:01] In 2022, Shopify's revenue was about $5.6 billion.

[58:07] Under $6 billion.

[58:08] Our merchants, the people who shopify,

[58:11] made almost $200 billion in GMBN revenue and sales.

[58:15] That is amazing.

[58:17] I'm very proud of that.

[58:19] I love the fact that our merchants made 200

[58:22] and we made $5.6 billion.

[58:23] Like that is the reciprocity that I think is important.

[58:27] I also love the fact that our ecosystem partners

[58:30] made more than $6 billion last year.

[58:33] That matters because it means for 2023,

[58:35] they're gonna come back and work with us again.

[58:38] And so, I wanna, this is a really good line of thinking

[58:41] for I think a lot of people in the audience.

[58:42] So, one is we've got this big team of reciprocity

[58:44] and what are some of the other,

[58:47] because I'm skipping one ahead,

[58:48] but I think I think it's worth it.

[58:50] So, what are some of the, you put this question,

[58:52] which is, what are some of the things I don't know

[58:53] which should, which is actually a question

[58:55] that I asked people to.

[58:56] So, I like that you asked that question.

[58:58] What are some of the other things

[59:00] that came up from those conversations

[59:01] or just things that you would share

[59:03] as some of the big breakthroughs

[59:05] and like really ones that you were like,

[59:06] I really thought this and I was dead wrong.

[59:08] And I see this now and it changed everything.

[59:11] All right, let me go a little personal for a second

[59:14] because I think these conversations

[59:16] don't really add as much value

[59:18] unless you can sort of take off the facade.

[59:20] Yeah.

[59:20] I have, I turned 42 months ago, my wife turned 40 a month ago.

[59:24] So, we've been doing a lot of like reflection on our life

[59:27] and, you know, we're grateful and we love what we do.

[59:30] We're doing our lives working all that.

[59:32] But one of the things that I really believe

[59:33] on a personal level is more true to me now

[59:36] than ever is this idea that vulnerability

[59:38] is actually this incredible superpower.

[59:41] And my life has gotten dramatically better

[59:45] when I became a lot more vulnerable.

[59:47] And I'll give you a quick example.

[59:49] I was the Chief Operating Officer of Shopify

[59:52] between pretty much 2015 or so in 2020.

[59:56] So post IPO until sort of the pandemic.

[59:59] And I love being shot by COO.

[60:02] It was a big role I had thousands of thousands of reports

[60:05] and most like pretty much all the non-engineering

[60:09] organizations rolled up to me.

[60:10] And I thought that was cool.

[60:11] I thought that was really fun.

[60:13] And I felt good about that.

[60:16] But I wasn't happy.

[60:18] I didn't feel necessarily that I was the best COO in the world.

[60:22] But there was no way in hell.

[60:23] I was never gonna raise man and say,

[60:24] this is not the right role for me.

[60:26] This is not what's gonna keep me a Shopify for a long time.

[60:28] And it was only until I had a really good chat with Toby.

[60:31] And I was like, look, I was like,

[60:34] there is someone who's better at this role than I am.

[60:36] I'm certain of it.

[60:37] And turns out it's CAS who's our currency,

[60:39] who's our currency, who's our currency.

[60:39] He was initially, he was running product for payments

[60:42] for us, our money product, but he's now.

[60:44] He loves being the COO and running operations.

[60:48] The way that I love storytelling.

[60:50] And I never would have had this new sort of,

[60:53] this next gear of my career to Shopify.

[60:56] How do I not had a little bit of like,

[60:59] just got an over my own shit, my own crap to say,

[61:01] this is really not for me.

[61:03] And I think this idea of vulnerability,

[61:05] showing weakness is being this weird,

[61:07] for a Vato insecurity thing.

[61:10] I think the more you show vulnerability,

[61:12] the more you ask for help, the better things become.

[61:15] And I recognize that it's easier for someone

[61:17] like me to show vulnerability of my stage

[61:19] than it would have been for me to show 10 years ago.

[61:22] But actually, as I get older,

[61:24] I believe that lesson last,

[61:25] that I actually believe at any stage,

[61:26] being really honest with yourself

[61:28] and being honest with the people around you,

[61:30] about what you wanted you,

[61:31] what you love doing, what you're really good at.

[61:32] Like this idea of, I've mentioned the term,

[61:35] life's work a couple times.

[61:36] There's a great Japanese term, which is Iki-gai,

[61:38] which is a feature of look, what do you love,

[61:40] what does a world need, what can you get paid for?

[61:43] That idea of finding your thing at a stage in life,

[61:48] where you're not 95, like as you sharpen four seasons,

[61:50] but you're 40, like I am, or you're 50, or 60, or 30,

[61:55] I think is a great gift.

[61:56] And I think you're able to find your thing a lot easier

[61:59] when you simply are a lot more vulnerable about that.

[62:03] And more than ever, I really look at that today

[62:06] as a real strength.

[62:08] That's the first.

[62:09] The second thing I would say is,

[62:11] even shopplay is, you know,

[62:12] we have, I don't know, eight or nine thousand people at the company.

[62:16] Shopify is very much a founder-led company,

[62:20] but also the people that work at Shopify

[62:22] have this incredible founders mentality.

[62:25] They act like an owner with every expense that we spend,

[62:29] the speed and agility they use.

[62:31] They reject like best practices, quote unquote.

[62:35] They reject processes that don't make sense,

[62:39] don't make it faster.

[62:40] And not just that we encourage that.

[62:42] If you look at the most, like some of the biggest areas

[62:44] of Shopify, the ran by founders of companies

[62:47] that we've acquired, and they've stated Shopify

[62:50] long passed the burnout dates,

[62:52] because we've created the sort of crafters

[62:55] and founders paradise at this company.

[62:57] In many ways, it is like this incredible,

[63:01] collective of founders and entrepreneurs.

[63:05] And I think that you can do that at any stage of company,

[63:08] but if you're not careful, it goes away really quickly.

[63:13] And there are very few companies on our sides today

[63:16] that feels like a founder-led entrepreneur,

[63:19] everyone calls themselves the largest startup.

[63:21] It's almost no.

[63:22] It's a common thing to say,

[63:24] but it's bullshit, most of them are not like that.

[63:26] And I think one thing that you can do

[63:28] as the founder of your companies

[63:29] and still the founders, this founders mindset

[63:31] or founder mentality, and you can keep it there

[63:34] if you work at it, and I think the results

[63:36] are almost always unequivocally better.

[63:38] What do you do tactically in order to keep that?

[63:41] So a couple of things are very simple.

[63:43] In most companies of our size,

[63:44] the way to get a promotion is to go into management.

[63:48] There's one track.

[63:49] It always leads to a manager type role.

[63:56] We don't do that.

[63:57] There are other tracks that shopify.

[63:58] There is a manager track.

[63:59] There's also an individual contributor track.

[64:01] We call the crafter track.

[64:02] There are these other tracks that allow you

[64:05] to stay at our company for a long time.

[64:07] And if your craft is engineering or it's product

[64:11] or it's sales or it's storytelling

[64:13] and it's sort of ran building,

[64:15] we are absolutely, in fact, not even okay with it.

[64:18] We are going to be super happy

[64:20] if your mandate for your career is to get really, really good

[64:24] at being the world's best marketer,

[64:26] the world's best sales rep or the world's best, whatever.

[64:30] So one is we've created these different tracks

[64:33] that shopify and we've created,

[64:35] which is sort of the way I like to hear it.

[64:37] It's like, Chopped is really a crafter paradise.

[64:39] That's one.

[64:40] The second thing that is really important is,

[64:42] we also encourage real disagreements.

[64:46] We invite people to actively disagree

[64:49] when something just doesn't feel right.

[64:52] Now, if we've made the decision,

[64:53] we've beat it up, disagreeing,

[64:56] to admit sometimes has to happen also.

[64:58] But instilling a place where you encourage open debate

[65:01] is really, I think super important.

[65:03] I think most companies talk about transparency

[65:06] and they talk, but it's total bullshit.

[65:09] Maybe the thing to encourage that,

[65:11] I always get into the weeds,

[65:12] but like, yeah, that the trust makes it a ton of sense.

[65:15] Like, that was like for me, you know,

[65:18] with our companies, I will,

[65:21] that'll probably my number one takeaway

[65:23] from just my tactical takeaways,

[65:25] like interesting having individual contributor tracks,

[65:27] because one of the big issues though,

[65:28] like when you have a star media buyer in the company,

[65:31] that guy usually doesn't want to then manage media buyers.

[65:34] Like he's used like that person.

[65:36] And why do you want that person to,

[65:37] like you want that star media buyer to be a media buyer?

[65:40] And what if that star media buyer is a seven

[65:42] and actually wants to become a nine or a 10 at some point?

[65:45] Now, all of a sudden, you have like the world's greatest media buyer.

[65:48] So one thing is, I think you do have to have a conversation

[65:50] with people, no matter what size of your company

[65:52] is like, what tracker you want, or you in a manage,

[65:55] there are some people who are just so great

[65:57] in management, you want them to manage teams.

[65:59] They're really good at that stuff.

[66:00] But I think having a conversation is a what tracker you want,

[66:03] really, really matters.

[66:04] The second thing I think that's also,

[66:06] that's also really important is,

[66:10] I know every company wants likes to talk about things like,

[66:13] you know, transparency and open communication.

[66:16] We write a letter to our board every quarter.

[66:19] We share that letter with the board, the whole company.

[66:22] And it's not redacted.

[66:23] It's exactly the letter that,

[66:24] even at our size, that we share with the board,

[66:26] we share with the entire company.

[66:28] Now, not every letter is going to be this holy shit mind

[66:31] blowing, you know, piece of content.

[66:34] They're always really interesting.

[66:35] But sometimes, you know, it's more like making sure

[66:37] the trends are on time and stuff like that.

[66:40] But what it does do over time is it really brings

[66:43] everyone into the same page of like, hey,

[66:45] the thing we're telling the board, we're also telling you

[66:47] that there isn't these like two different versions

[66:49] of the narrative of the company.

[66:52] And I think that's something that is, it's,

[66:55] it seems simple, but it's really, really impactful,

[66:58] especially if you do it really consistently.

[67:01] I'll give, I'll give the listeners a tactic

[67:03] that we have done for this, which is,

[67:05] we actually run open book financials in all of our companies.

[67:08] And so when we do quarterlies, it's like,

[67:11] here's where we made money.

[67:12] Here's where this like we spend money

[67:14] and it didn't work out well.

[67:15] And so that's helped for everyone feeling like they're

[67:20] on the same page that we're not hiding anything.

[67:22] And if things are going really well, they can see it.

[67:23] And if something doesn't go as well,

[67:24] like some of the decisions that happened downline

[67:27] were like, well, that was suffering.

[67:28] And I guess this does make sense

[67:30] that we decided to divest in this kind of endeavor

[67:33] that we were doing.

[67:33] And I know I love Susie, but I get it.

[67:36] You know, even if people are like stoked about it,

[67:38] they get it.

[67:39] So I was just, I love, this is great.

[67:44] And so acting like an order, you operationalize that

[67:47] by creating individual,

[67:49] contributor tracks and by having

[67:51] many contracts really so people can be honest

[67:52] about what they're really good at.

[67:54] And the one tip that I'll give to people

[67:55] who actually aren't owners,

[67:56] are just like entrepreneurs,

[67:57] as I'm employees and businesses,

[68:00] is no one can fault you once you own your flaws.

[68:04] Like if you're like, hey, I really suck at project management.

[68:08] And if you say that,

[68:09] a front, then people are like,

[68:11] they don't talk behind your back about it.

[68:13] They'll just talk to your face about it

[68:14] because it's not a secret.

[68:15] You're like, I know I suck at project management.

[68:17] And so the more it's like,

[68:18] like, hominem's whole thing is like,

[68:20] if he claimed every single deficiency in flaw that he had,

[68:23] no one could say anything back to him in rap battles.

[68:25] And even though, you know,

[68:26] hopefully corporate America is a little bit nice

[68:27] to the rap battle, maybe it isn't.

[68:29] Yeah, I mean, it may not always be,

[68:31] but I think you're right about that.

[68:32] I think also the thing that what happens is,

[68:34] when you say to someone, look,

[68:36] I don't want to be a riverstone.

[68:37] I don't want to be well-rounded.

[68:38] I want to be really, really pointy at this thing.

[68:42] And that means that this other things around me,

[68:43] I'm going to hire, or I'm going to find teams

[68:46] who are really good at those other things.

[68:47] Now you're beginning to actually put yourself

[68:49] in a position where if you're not like,

[68:52] the world's greatest, I don't know, writer, for example.

[68:54] But you're really good at coming up with like,

[68:57] you know, great slogans.

[68:58] You're not the world's great ad,

[68:59] you know, you're not great at writing ad copy,

[69:01] but you're a great media buyer.

[69:03] Now if you say, look, I'm not good at ad copy,

[69:05] but I'm so good at finding opportunities

[69:08] for a great exposure.

[69:10] If you say you're not good at that,

[69:11] that means it invites someone who may be really good at copy

[69:15] to come and be your buddy, your best friend at work.

[69:20] That stuff really, really matters.

[69:22] And I think that stuff is really good.

[69:24] The only other thing I will say is this,

[69:26] I know a lot of coming up with a mission and North Star,

[69:28] one thing that we are very clear on,

[69:29] even from day one, to now is,

[69:33] we are a merchant obsessed.

[69:35] And what does that mean?

[69:35] When given any decision, where about we have to pick

[69:39] one of two things, we always ask ourselves,

[69:42] what is better for merchants.

[69:43] Now, by the way, that is different

[69:45] than let's say Amazon, for example,

[69:46] who is very famously consumer obsessed.

[69:49] They don't, that's what they care about.

[69:51] They're very clear about that.

[69:52] When you work at Amazon,

[69:53] if there's like 100,000 people who work there,

[69:54] they are consumer obsessed.

[69:56] By creating this very simple heuristic

[69:59] of which allows you to say,

[70:00] given to opportunities, both seem pretty good,

[70:04] how do you actually evaluate it?

[70:06] Well, what's the one that's best for the merchant?

[70:07] That means that thousands of people

[70:09] work at Shopify in a daily basis

[70:11] are making independent decisions

[70:13] that all roll up to that centralized mission,

[70:15] which is we are merchant obsessed.

[70:17] We care first and foremost about the millions

[70:19] of business owners that you Shopify.

[70:21] And again, it sounds obvious,

[70:24] but most companies totally mess this up.

[70:26] And where the vision and mission stuff

[70:28] gets really important to struggle with this thing is,

[70:30] like once you get to about 100 employees,

[70:32] that's where you're usually two to three levels away

[70:35] like if you're the founder,

[70:36] you're two to three levels away from people

[70:38] who are getting hired.

[70:38] You're starting to hire people, you don't even know their names.

[70:40] Like this is where this really becomes important

[70:42] because decentralized decision making

[70:44] is the only way you can continue to scale.

[70:45] And you need people to make decisions

[70:47] that would be in alignment with you.

[70:49] Like you can't be in every brand to make every decision.

[70:50] And so that's where mission and values

[70:54] create decision making frameworks

[70:55] that people can use as litmus tests of,

[70:58] okay, what would Toby do right now?

[71:00] Well, I know that Toby says merchants are North Star

[71:03] and merchants would not like this

[71:05] that we don't do it, right?

[71:06] Even though we bake a little bit more,

[71:08] they don't like it and that's what correct.

[71:09] So I just want to highlight that

[71:10] because a lot of the people, I mean,

[71:12] obviously we take businesses on smaller than Shopify.

[71:15] That we invested.

[71:17] But like we'll go through this exercise with leadership

[71:19] because usually when they're at,

[71:20] you know, between $10 to $30 million a year,

[71:22] this is when this gets really important

[71:24] to get to 100 million a year in revenue and so forth.

[71:27] And so like if you're at that point in your stage,

[71:29] like this shit gets important.

[71:31] I also think something,

[71:32] you're sort of skating or flirting with a little bit

[71:34] which has to be said is I think that there is a strange thing

[71:37] that as you grow.

[71:38] So you mentioned a hundred people,

[71:39] there's actually a real thing.

[71:40] It's called Dunbar's Number.

[71:42] It's 150 people, right?

[71:44] And Dunbar's Number basically goes back to like the days

[71:46] of like when we're all living in tribes.

[71:47] That basically a tribe's size should never go beyond 150.

[71:51] There's some sort of science around humans

[71:53] can only really remember 150 people

[71:54] at any one particular time.

[71:56] I went through the 150 mark a long time ago,

[71:58] a Shopify, it does change.

[72:00] And there's no question about it.

[72:01] But the one thing that often happens

[72:03] when you cross that 100 mark or 150 person mark

[72:06] is you begin to do this whole

[72:08] like macro management.

[72:11] You sort of get out of the weeds.

[72:13] And actually I think this whole narrative

[72:15] that micro management is bad is total horseshit.

[72:18] I actually think that the best leaders I know

[72:20] with the running like trillion dollar companies,

[72:23] I know some of those,

[72:24] or a hundred billion dollar companies,

[72:26] or a million dollar companies,

[72:27] the best leaders I know are in the weeds

[72:30] on the things that matter most.

[72:32] And even, you know,

[72:33] I'm preparing for my earnings call

[72:34] which is in two weeks.

[72:35] I mean the weeds on this,

[72:37] we have an IR team who could prepare all this.

[72:39] No, I want to actually go through every single word

[72:42] in the script, in the press release,

[72:43] in the narrative, I want to go word for word on my own

[72:47] before anyone even takes a look at it

[72:49] because it matters so much.

[72:51] And if that's my crack,

[72:52] that's what I'm supposed to be responsible for,

[72:54] then I'm going to be in the weeds on that.

[72:55] I think there's this corporate America bashing

[72:58] of micro management.

[72:59] And I think some micro management

[73:03] is actually really positive and needed.

[73:05] We agree.

[73:06] And we have a little saying for this internally,

[73:08] which is winning the weeds.

[73:09] Yeah.

[73:10] Like that's what we're going to go toe to toe.

[73:12] It's somebody's like, you're going to win in the weeds.

[73:13] Like that's how you do it.

[73:14] And I feel the same way.

[73:16] If some, you know, some,

[73:17] some president of some other company of our size

[73:21] is not in the weeds on earnings,

[73:23] on press, on partnerships,

[73:25] I'm going to run circles around them

[73:27] because I am in the weeds.

[73:28] Because you have the, the visceral knowledge

[73:30] of like the stuff that really makes it.

[73:31] And one of the things that also helps with this is that,

[73:33] if you are in the weeds when something goes wrong,

[73:35] you know why it went wrong.

[73:36] And you can make a pivot where if you're two levels removed,

[73:39] you don't know why it didn't work.

[73:40] And then you're decision making of what to do next,

[73:42] then relies on secondhand.

[73:43] And it gets really, really messy after that.

[73:45] You make really dumb moves.

[73:47] Okay. So we have reciprocity is one of the big driving things.

[73:51] We have vulnerability.

[73:52] And then the downstream impacts

[73:53] of how you kind of implement that with in Shopify,

[73:55] with the individual tracks.

[73:57] And encouraging open disagreement among people

[74:00] and giving everyone kind of a north star.

[74:02] So everyone's aligned with how we're,

[74:04] are like what frameworks are we going to disagree around?

[74:06] Like it's not whether we're doing customer or doing merchant.

[74:10] The disagreement is going to be which of these best serves

[74:12] the merchant if we're going to disagree.

[74:14] Correct.

[74:15] So I want to zoom out.

[74:17] And so I said we're going to look back

[74:19] and I think we took a little bit of a final negative stuff

[74:21] and moved it forward which I loved anyways.

[74:23] So if we're looking forward, right?

[74:25] You sit in this really unique perch

[74:27] that I mean maybe 10 people on earth sit on that.

[74:30] You sit on top of this mountain of data

[74:32] and you kind of see around the corner.

[74:35] And so what's coming, right?

[74:39] What are you thinking about for Shopify?

[74:42] And just kind of the marketplace overall

[74:43] for retail entrepreneurs or even entrepreneurs in general?

[74:46] Like we talked about a little bit about this idea,

[74:48] the cost of failure is trending towards zero.

[74:50] It's never going to be zero because ultimately

[74:52] it's sort of asymptotes because ultimately

[74:54] like you have an opportunity cost

[74:56] like you could be doing something else.

[74:58] So it's never going to be zero,

[74:59] but it's getting close to it.

[75:00] I think a couple things around the entrepreneurship thing.

[75:02] One is I think entrepreneurship now more than ever before

[75:06] is default global.

[75:07] I think this idea that we've imported

[75:11] physical geographies and borders of countries

[75:15] in from the physical world into the digital world

[75:18] is really silly.

[75:20] I don't think, I mean,

[75:21] you see a lot of great brands behind me

[75:23] that I'm very close with.

[75:24] I put up from Kith to Supreme to Mom spaghetti

[75:29] which is M&M's company to Firebelly,

[75:31] which is my little T side hustle master and dynamic headphones.

[75:35] These are some of the companies that I love

[75:36] that I'm connected to.

[75:37] NEM of them have geographic limitations.

[75:40] That's just not how they operate.

[75:42] I get it.

[75:43] It's more complicated sometimes to sell,

[75:44] although frankly, we have a product called Shopify markets

[75:46] and markets pro which makes everything really easy there.

[75:50] But I don't want to, this is a Shopify business.

[75:52] I think one, like your total adjustable market

[75:55] when you're getting started is anyone on the planet

[75:58] who wants to buy your particular product.

[76:00] First, second of all is, I think the idea,

[76:03] if you listen to any of the earnings calls

[76:05] from these big retailers,

[76:08] one of the terms you often hear

[76:10] is this concept of channel conflict,

[76:12] which is a very simple thing.

[76:14] It's online is doing well, but it's hurting offline.

[76:17] Instagram commerce is doing well,

[76:19] but it's hurting my online store.

[76:21] I, when I think about the brands

[76:23] and I admire the most across millions of stores

[76:26] on Shopify, none of them, none of them use the term

[76:29] channel conflict.

[76:30] Why?

[76:31] Because they are channel-agnostic.

[76:32] What they care about is serving their customer

[76:35] in the way that the customer loves to be served

[76:38] or wants to be served, which is very different than,

[76:41] pretty much, the history of retail,

[76:44] where if you wanted to buy bread,

[76:45] you went to the baker in the town square,

[76:48] you wanted to buy shoes,

[76:48] went to the cobbler down the streets in the 80s.

[76:52] I'm an 80s kid.

[76:54] When I went to go buy a video game,

[76:55] I'd have to line up at the store at this hour,

[76:57] doors open, weight in line,

[76:59] use this credit card, not that credit card, use this one.

[77:02] That whole thing was the concept of the retailer

[77:06] dictating the process of purchase to the consumer is over.

[77:11] And the reason that you're seeing things like shop pay,

[77:14] for example, becomes so popular

[77:16] is because seamless, simple, easy, convenient checkout

[77:21] is what every consumer wants.

[77:22] And so modern retailers today, one,

[77:24] are geographically agnostic, two, are channeled gnaw,

[77:28] stick they sell across every channel.

[77:29] And the reason why you see us do things like,

[77:32] there's a Spotify channel for Shopify.

[77:35] So if you're an artist, most merchants on top,

[77:37] they're not artists, but if you're an artist,

[77:39] and you have your M&M, for example,

[77:41] and you have a great popular artist profile

[77:44] and fan base on Spotify, now you can sell your merch

[77:47] directly from your artist profile paid on Spotify.

[77:50] We'll be important to most people, but if we want to qualify

[77:55] and to requalify to be the retail operating system

[77:57] for these millions of stores,

[77:58] our responsibility is every surface area

[78:02] on the planet, digital, physical, anywhere between

[78:05] that transaction could happen, we have to make that easy.

[78:09] So that's probably the second thing I think that's happening

[78:10] with retail.

[78:11] And then the third thing that I think is kind of like

[78:13] an interesting thing is that I think business

[78:18] is becoming at all sizes personal.

[78:20] And you do this very well, Alex, maybe better than anyone,

[78:22] but you know, your own personal brand

[78:25] and your business brand, they're not separate anymore.

[78:29] A couple a little while ago, I saw a very high-end brand

[78:34] their online store was down.

[78:36] Okay, it was Versace.

[78:37] Versace went down, think eight months ago when I tweeted,

[78:40] I said Versace, let me help you out.

[78:43] And in an up leading to some of the Versace brands

[78:45] coming out of Shopify.

[78:47] At that point, was I, the present of Shopify,

[78:49] was I Harley, the entrepreneur, was I Harley, the human,

[78:52] like, I think this idea that work life balance

[78:56] or work life harmony, the separate,

[78:58] I think it's over, I think people,

[79:00] I think we as entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs

[79:03] in 2024, we have to sort of incorporate all these things

[79:06] into our backpack, our businesses, our personal life,

[79:09] like, you talk about, you talk about your wife, Leyla, right?

[79:11] All the time, but being part of,

[79:13] like you sort of mix in between total addressable market

[79:17] and talk about your wife.

[79:18] I do the same thing like Lindsay My Life,

[79:19] is a huge part of my life.

[79:21] And when I go home, I talk about work

[79:23] and I also talk about our kids and I,

[79:24] I think there's sort of this wonderful,

[79:26] harmonious situation now where we don't,

[79:30] we're not separating these things,

[79:31] we're not waiting to retire to live our life.

[79:34] I think more and more you're able to kind of like,

[79:37] have a personal brand, but it's all to your business as brand.

[79:39] And you're all some extension of the company,

[79:41] but you're also your own person.

[79:42] And I actually think that's a wonderful new thing

[79:45] that a new phenomenon that is very different

[79:48] than our parents and grandparents and great grandparents had.

[79:50] Yeah, and they don't really get it as such.

[79:53] Right.

[79:54] I mean, Mr. Beast is he a YouTuber or is he a,

[79:57] or is he a confectionary genius with his truck?

[79:59] Who cares?

[80:01] Right.

[80:01] He's this amazing guy.

[80:02] He's a great entrepreneur, anybody's content

[80:04] and he makes chocolate and he makes burgers

[80:06] and he makes cool videos and he's a cool dude.

[80:08] Like who cares how you sort of categorize these people.

[80:12] And that's the reason why actually,

[80:13] I think back to what we said at the beginning,

[80:15] authenticity is going to rule here.

[80:17] And if you are, if you are full of shit,

[80:19] people are going to figure that out very quickly

[80:21] and they're not going to buy it.

[80:21] They're not going to want to participate in your journey.

[80:24] But if you're not full of shit and you've liked people

[80:26] along into your journey and you talk about your kids

[80:29] and your spouse and your business,

[80:30] people cheer for you.

[80:32] And it goes back to what I think you said earlier

[80:35] is that quote about, you know,

[80:38] you want as many people cheering for you as possible

[80:40] in your journey.

[80:41] For other exact quote, but if something like that.

[80:43] And because I like defining terms a lot,

[80:46] it's like one of my hobbies,

[80:48] but defining it from a behavioral perspective.

[80:50] So a lot of people are like, well, what is being authentic

[80:52] or like a want to be authentic?

[80:53] Like how do you do that?

[80:55] The best definition that I have that's working is behaving

[80:59] is if you could not be punished.

[81:01] And so oftentimes, like we censor ourselves

[81:03] for fear of punishment, we like the many things

[81:06] that we don't say or don't do because we're afraid.

[81:08] Someone's going to say something

[81:09] or someone's going to do something reaction.

[81:11] And so basically, if you're in an empty room,

[81:13] you have almost no potential for punishment.

[81:16] And so it's how you act as if you could not be punished

[81:20] is how you are authentically.

[81:22] And so we talk about the concept of like you are the niche.

[81:25] So it's like what is Logan?

[81:26] How do you like he likes, he likes aliens.

[81:28] He likes, you know, weird government stuff.

[81:31] He likes fighting, he likes comedy,

[81:33] he likes biohacking, he likes taking crazy drugs.

[81:36] Like he likes all sorts of stuff.

[81:37] And so if you're just saying, hey, I want to start

[81:38] this podcast where I talk about aliens,

[81:41] fighting, comedy, like people will be like you're crazy.

[81:44] But it's Joe Rogan.

[81:45] And so it also creates a one-of-one category

[81:48] that only you can really occupy.

[81:50] And so I genuinely do believe this,

[81:53] that everyone is kind of unique

[81:56] in terms of their distinct interest

[81:57] and kind of like if they were a chart,

[81:59] like how the point of their rock is in one direction,

[82:02] versus a hundred other ones.

[82:04] And so I do think there is a thumbprint there

[82:05] that is unique to the individual.

[82:07] Where people do become rounded stones

[82:08] because they pull back on their pointy bits

[82:11] and so then they do look more uniform.

[82:12] And so people look uniform but aren't in reality.

[82:15] And so looking at these three big things

[82:17] in terms of what's coming around the corner

[82:18] and commerce and kind of like where the best brands are indexing.

[82:22] Number one is that they see everyone

[82:23] as a potential customer around the world, not just

[82:26] their local air, just even people who speak their language.

[82:29] Second was that they don't really care

[82:31] where the customer comes from.

[82:32] Like if more people know about your stuff

[82:34] and you put in more places, more people will buy it.

[82:36] And as long as you treat them well,

[82:37] you'll make more sales and you'll more reprieve customers.

[82:40] And then third one is creating,

[82:43] basically allowing yourself to be you publicly

[82:47] and being more okay with the association

[82:49] that's going to happen inevitably

[82:50] with you starting a company

[82:51] because if you really believe in the product,

[82:53] it's going to be in mesh in your identity.

[82:54] It's going to be part of who you are.

[82:56] And rather than caging these things out or boxing them,

[82:58] just leaning into the fact that like you're you

[83:01] and you own this thing.

[83:03] And I think that what we were saying earlier

[83:04] with kind of temparis and these brand champions,

[83:06] like those other people can contribute their thumb rinse

[83:10] to your product as well.

[83:11] Well, if you're authentic,

[83:12] then other people that are kind of like you,

[83:14] like, you know, I like to be exothermic.

[83:18] Like I like to take, I'm very high energy,

[83:19] I always have been.

[83:21] I like to add energy to other people

[83:23] and other situations and rooms and conversations.

[83:26] And so I'm just going to like,

[83:28] I want to be exothermic.

[83:29] And so everything that I do,

[83:30] I want to like, I want to be the exothermic person.

[83:32] What that means is people see me being exothermic.

[83:34] I mean, you and I sort of connected,

[83:36] like you and I are kind of social media friends.

[83:37] Like I was being exothermic and you were being exothermic

[83:39] or like, hey, let's be exothermic together.

[83:42] That's how you and I, that's why we are talking right now

[83:45] because I try to be authentically me on the internet

[83:47] and you try to be authentically you and the internet.

[83:49] And so we connect and like you know,

[83:51] like yeah, kind of like each other.

[83:52] But you get tons of people coming at you asking to do stuff

[83:56] together and immediately you're like,

[83:57] ah, something is off here.

[83:59] And I, I feel the same way sometimes when people come to me

[84:02] and they say like, I want to connect,

[84:03] I want to do a deal with you.

[84:05] When you are exothermic and if you are,

[84:07] or when you are authentic,

[84:09] you actually invite other people that are similarly authentic

[84:12] in your way into your lives.

[84:13] And you create these amazing communities and friendships

[84:16] and relationships and it's, it's really fun.

[84:18] But you know, I mean, it's a great sort of place to wrap up,

[84:21] I think, which is like, there is a deep optimism

[84:23] I think around the entrepreneurial community.

[84:26] And for those of you that are listening

[84:27] whether you're an entrepreneur or aspiring entrepreneur,

[84:29] one of the best parts of entrepreneurship

[84:31] is that all of us, not actually not all,

[84:33] most of us didn't sort of start with like some sort of like

[84:37] we didn't start on third base.

[84:39] Most of us started at the beginning

[84:41] and we've been building ourselves.

[84:42] And so when we see other people building on their own,

[84:45] whether they're carer practice or they're tech entrepreneurs

[84:47] or they're lawyers or accountants or they're someone

[84:50] who's creating, you know, I love my ember mug.

[84:52] I love the guys that ember that make these great

[84:53] coffee mugs at state hot.

[84:54] Whatever they are, I'm rooting for them.

[84:57] And they're rooting for me.

[84:58] And that actually, that's sort of

[85:00] wonderful like ecosystem reciprocite go back to that.

[85:03] That makes entrepreneurship a little bit less lonely

[85:06] and also the greatest tool for humans

[85:10] to find their own version of six,

[85:12] whatever your business excises make a lot of money,

[85:14] put food in your table, be creative.

[85:16] Whatever that version is, entrepreneurship is this

[85:18] amazing vehicle and today it's more accessible

[85:20] than it's ever been.

[85:22] And it's tough not to be optimistic about that.

[85:26] Last question.

[85:28] Business advice to Harley 10 years ago,

[85:29] you've got one thing you can tell.

[85:33] I think a lot of people don't know where to start.

[85:37] We kind of talked with this a little bit earlier

[85:38] and we talked with T-shirts,

[85:39] but just find a problem that you feel yourself

[85:41] and just solve it.

[85:44] It's hard to imagine how to scale

[85:46] and how big it could become.

[85:46] Don't even worry about that.

[85:48] But like if there's a hobby, like, you know,

[85:51] one of my best friends is really,

[85:53] his name is David Segel.

[85:54] He's founder of David's T.

[85:55] This big T empire, he sold a company 2016.

[85:58] And he was trying to figure out what to do.

[86:00] And all along the way, David was like,

[86:02] coming over to my house and you're hanging out at a lot

[86:04] and he's obsessed with T.

[86:06] I was like, dude, like, you have a thing.

[86:08] It's T, why aren't you building another T company?

[86:10] And so that's where firebelly came from.

[86:13] And I love this idea that, like, you know,

[86:15] the thing that you're searching for

[86:16] is probably right in front of you.

[86:18] And I know some people say that, you know,

[86:20] you shouldn't commercialize your hobbies,

[86:21] but I'm actually, I'm not really sure I believe that.

[86:24] Like if you have this amazing hobby,

[86:26] this amazing interest, this amazing pain point,

[86:28] you feel a lot.

[86:29] That's exactly what you should be working on.

[86:31] That's the first thing.

[86:32] The second thing I think is like, you know,

[86:35] this is my 15th year of Shopify.

[86:37] I'm 40 years old, so more than a third of my life

[86:39] has been spent at this credible company.

[86:41] And if, if people, if Toby and the board will have me

[86:44] I'll say there as long as I possibly can.

[86:46] But finding someone who, like,

[86:49] from a partnership perspective,

[86:50] someone you work with closely,

[86:53] I think a lot of people start companies

[86:55] and businesses with people that are just like them.

[86:56] People that they would have been friends with in high school.

[86:59] I guess fun, and I get it.

[87:01] And, you know, firebelly, for example,

[87:02] Dave and I are both kind of similar

[87:04] with our little tea thing.

[87:06] But actually, I think some of the most impressive things

[87:09] I've ever seen built were built by people

[87:11] that probably would not have been friends in high school.

[87:14] Again, going back to this idea of like a pointy objects.

[87:16] They're pointy in their own way,

[87:18] but their points are not the same.

[87:19] And by combining their points,

[87:21] they kind of create this like Avengers thing,

[87:23] which all in their own, they'd be doing cool stuff,

[87:25] but like, you know, doing it all together,

[87:28] means they can build $100 billion company.

[87:31] So those would be some of the things I would say.

[87:33] Maybe the only other thing is like,

[87:34] you know, one, just going back to like life and work altogether,

[87:39] one of the most important decisions all of us can make

[87:42] is finding an incredible, incredible partner,

[87:44] spouse, wife, husband, boyfriend, girlfriend, whatever.

[87:48] I think people underestimate how important that is.

[87:51] And I think I often refer to Lindsey,

[87:54] and I've reported to Berthet, I said,

[87:56] Lindsey is my superpower.

[87:58] That I have this incredible part.

[88:00] And I think we all, not all,

[88:03] but I know a lot of people had taken for granted

[88:06] how important that particular decision is.

[88:09] I think finding a wonderful life partner for you,

[88:12] whoever you are is just probably the most important

[88:16] decision you're ever gonna make.

[88:17] And I think we all, some people think about it very thoughtfully.

[88:20] Others sort of do it half-hazardly,

[88:21] and I think that's a mistake.

[88:23] Pointes seven, one correlation with your subjective wellbeing.

[88:26] Hell yeah.

[88:27] So is that true?

[88:28] Are you making that out?

[88:29] That's points at the point.

[88:30] Wow.

[88:31] The correlation was a subjective wellbeing.

[88:32] The strength of the relationship with your significant other.

[88:34] With that, I feel like it's a great,

[88:35] so I'll be point.

[88:36] Thank you so much for giving your time,

[88:38] like just, just as a,

[88:40] this is so fun.

[88:41] I hope it's valuable to your community and your listeners.

[88:43] I'm a huge fan.

[88:44] I'm part of your community,

[88:45] and I tried to bring as much insight

[88:48] and thoughtfulness as I possibly could.

[88:50] It's an honor how it's for me to be talking to you

[88:52] for about a blast 90 minutes.

[88:55] It's beyond mutual, and I'll just be happy

[88:57] for your imagination.

[88:58] Thank you so much.

[88:59] Brigid you.

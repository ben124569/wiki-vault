[00:00] So I was at a mastermind with seven other entrepreneurs and the total room

[00:05] cumulatively was doing over $500 million a year in revenue.

[00:10] And so this was kind of a cool meet-up of very high-level entrepreneurs.

[00:15] And everybody kind of went up there and shared the things that they were doing well.

[00:19] And between things were eating and having a time.

[00:25] And what was interesting to me is that in the entrepreneurial world,

[00:29] so many entrepreneurs have all these weird sticks about their food and their exercise

[00:35] and their hydration and their orange glasses they wear and their fingertips,

[00:40] shoes and their biohacking and just all this weirdness.

[00:43] But I actually came from this world and all that stuff is complete,

[00:47] make believe bullshit.

[00:49] And so it's really good for selling people stuff,

[00:52] but it's complete, it's complete farce.

[00:55] So anyways, the whole time these guys are sitting there and they're like,

[00:59] oh no, I only eat keto.

[01:00] So I only do intermittent fasting, right?

[01:03] And I'm sitting there listening to them.

[01:06] I'm like eating twizzlers and cookies and ice cream.

[01:08] And they're like, what are you doing?

[01:12] And by the second day they see that I literally continue to eat this way,

[01:15] like an asshole.

[01:17] And they're like, what are you doing, man?

[01:20] Like how does this work?

[01:21] And so between all the stuff that we talked about business wise,

[01:25] while it was lunchtime, I was like, all right,

[01:28] this is kind of how I've been eating for 17 years and I was in better shape than all the guys there.

[01:34] And believe it or not, a bunch of those guys ended up telling me months later that they had all

[01:40] gotten in shape, but it's still the presentation that I gave them,

[01:43] which is a different way of eating.

[01:45] And so I've been doing this for almost 20 years.

[01:50] I've been in shape that entire time.

[01:51] I had not had a six-pack since I was 13 or 14.

[01:56] And I eat ice cream every day, yep every day.

[02:01] And I drink alcohol and I eat cookies and I do all the things

[02:06] that people want to do.

[02:08] All right, and so what I'm going to take you through is a very special little thing that I put together,

[02:12] which is actually an adaptation of what I presented to these guys

[02:16] at this little meetup.

[02:17] All right, so buckle up and I think that you will enjoy this.

[02:22] The first thing that everybody has to understand is what body type you are and what body type you'd

[02:26] like to become, right? And so I kind of put this on a little matrix of high-fat low-fat, low-muscle high-muscle.

[02:33] So you could be high-fat low-muscle and you would have very feminine figure, right?

[02:39] You could have low-muscle low-fat and be skinned bones.

[02:43] You could be high-fat high-muscle and just be big.

[02:46] You could be low-fat and high-muscle, which is what a bodybuilder is.

[02:50] And you know there's various pieces along this curve, right?

[02:53] Once you figure out where you are, let's say you're skinning, right?

[02:56] And you want to get a big, right? Then you would have a line that you could pretty much draw directionally

[03:02] to the place that you want to go.

[03:04] So if you're going up that way, that means you need to increase your number of calories

[03:09] and you need to increase your volume.

[03:11] Those are the two things that you need to do.

[03:13] Because if you're going in this direction, then these are the two directional arrows,

[03:17] this guy and this guy, that you would need to adhere to, right?

[03:20] So you basically plot the same high- increased calories, decreased

[03:27] volume, increased volume along the same plot line that you had high-fat low-fat high-muscle low-muscle.

[03:33] Don't get too cut up in this. I just like to add visuals because that's how I think.

[03:37] If you know where you are and you know where you want to go, then you can know what you need to

[03:41] do to get there. You increase your calories and increase your volume and there you go.

[03:44] Here's the thing that got them all tripped up.

[03:46] And then I said, hey guys, do you guys want to know why all your diets are the same?

[03:50] And they were like, uh, what? I was like, yeah, crazy. I know.

[03:54] And so right now, I'm not including alcohol, there's three main macro nutrients, right?

[03:58] You got protein carbs and fat.

[03:59] If you're eating a normal balanced meal, that's what something like this would look like, right?

[04:04] You have kind of an even distribution of protein carbs and fat in your meal.

[04:08] Now, what happens is whenever you do a diet, right? So let's say you do keto.

[04:13] All right? Well, if you're doing keto, all you're doing is you're going to be removing this orange thing

[04:18] and having just, you basically eliminate your carbs. And so you eat one-third fewer calories.

[04:24] Makes sense. If you have a low-fat diet, you're eliminating your vet, which is this yellow guy,

[04:31] right? And again, you're eating one-third fewer calories. If you did a portion controlled diet,

[04:36] you would eat equal amounts of the same three things, but just less of them overall. And so you would,

[04:41] you guessed it, eat fewer calories. And if you did an intermittent fasting, you would go from eating

[04:46] three meals a day, eating two meals a day. And guess what? You would be eating fewer calories.

[04:52] So I'm at the camera being crazy. Anyway, so this is the thing that's happening right now, right?

[04:57] Is that you're eliminating calories? That is what is going on and every diet that you possibly do.

[05:02] All right? And so all these guys get all like, oh no, I do really well with low carb. I do really

[05:06] well with high fat, you know, low, whatever. It doesn't matter. Like it's all horseshit. It's just calories.

[05:11] It's all the matters. Okay? And so this was driving me nuts, which is why I started making this little

[05:17] put together for you guys. But this is why every other diet's the same, right? And here's the,

[05:23] here's the fun one for you. If you've struggled and you had a diet that didn't work for you,

[05:27] here's why. Let's say you did keto. If you did keto the wrong the right way, it would look like this.

[05:33] Right? You would cut out your carbs, right? And then that calorie amount is eliminated from your diet,

[05:39] and then over time you lose weight. Right? Now, this is what a lot of people who said,

[05:43] oh, keto didn't work for me. It's like because you started drinking butter, right? You started eating

[05:48] rib eyes for breakfast every day. Well, no shit. There's a lot more calories that you took in. So

[05:52] the amount that you cut out did not compensate for the amount of excess,

[05:56] protein, and fat that you added into your diet, the ended up actually netting you more calories than

[06:02] you would need. Right? And that's why it didn't work for you. That is why these diets don't work.

[06:06] So what I will tell you now is what actually has to happen in order for to work in reality.

[06:12] Okay? So these are the only three things that 99% of people need to know in order to figure out

[06:17] what they want to, how they want to eat, how they want to look. You just got to know one,

[06:21] how many calories you need to eat, two, how many grams of protein you need to eat,

[06:26] and three, how much volume you need to do. I'm not going to talk about number three today. I'm

[06:29] just going to talk about one and two because that's what 99% you need to even think about anyways. Here's

[06:32] the simplest way to figure out number one. Now there's a million, there's a million, a little

[06:36] four milliliters that you can use here. The basic one is your body weight, times your goal. Very simple.

[06:41] So if you're a 200 pound guy, right, and you wanted to maintain, then you'll probably be eating

[06:45] between 2600 and 3000 calories. So 200, do-do, times 15 would be cool, 3000 calories. Right?

[06:53] That's if you wanted to maintain on the high side. Right? Now let's say you wanted to lose weight.

[06:57] And let's see, you wanted to go a little bit more extreme. Then it would be 200 times 10,

[07:01] which would be 2000 calories. Very simple. Right? There's a million different ways to try and

[07:05] calculate this and none of the matter because controlling what you ingest is easy,

[07:10] understanding how much you expel in calories is very hard, and so it doesn't matter anyways.

[07:15] Thing is, step one is you determine how many calories are supposed to eat, based on your goal.

[07:19] And the thing is, if you started this and you're like, man, I wanted to lose weight. And you

[07:24] don't lose weight at a rate that you would find fast enough, you can always just decrease. It's not that

[07:28] hard, right? Very straightforward. So you multiply your body weight by the number here. So you can see here,

[07:36] it's from 7 all the way to 21. If you wanted to have extreme weight gain, it would be your body weight

[07:40] times a high up number over here. If you wanted to have extreme weight loss, it would be a low number

[07:46] over here. And that's it. Right? If you have everything in between. So I said, if you wanted to have

[07:52] pretty fast weight loss, then you'd be your body weight time 10. Right? Very simple. Now that we've

[07:56] done that, we go to step two. You got to figure out how much protein you. And this is the part that

[08:00] everyone gets kind of trippy on. Right? Because showing you the whole point of this is some putt this

[08:04] together for you. And then you can have all the ice cream and all the cookies and all the

[08:07] alcohol you ever dreamed of and still have a six pack. All right? Forever. For good. Because it's my

[08:11] belief that if you're going to do this, right? If you're going to play the game, you have to do it in a

[08:16] way that you'd be able to do it forever. Right? If I can't do something for the rest of my life,

[08:19] then I don't see a point in doing it. Who cares about being in shape for eight weeks? Right? When

[08:23] I want to be in shape for the rest of my life. Right? No one's going to remember you for being

[08:27] in shape that time period. They're going to be like, oh yeah, you always struggle with this way.

[08:30] And you was always trying new crazy things. Wouldn't it be nice to just solve it for good? Proaching.

[08:35] Which is the second number here. Your body weight times one in grams is about what you need to have

[08:40] for protein per day. Very simple. All right? So if we're 200 pounds, then you need 200 grams of protein.

[08:46] Now here's where it's kind of cool. You're like, well, and here's the biggest life hack

[08:50] impossible to give you. 100 grams of protein is equivalent to one pound of lean meat. All right? So

[08:57] if you need to have 200 grams, that would be two pounds of lean meat. And so for me, the world's

[09:04] simplest, you know, diet of all time. And by diet, it's just like this is just how I live.

[09:09] He said, I eat two pounds of meat a day. All right? And they're like, that's crazy. It's not really.

[09:12] You get used to it, right? And you just stop eating the crap that you probably right now. So two pounds

[09:17] of meat can be two pounds of shrimp. It can be two pounds of tolapping. It can be two pounds of

[09:22] and doesn't have to be the same thing. You could have a quarter pound of four different things.

[09:26] You know, excuse me, a half pound of four different things. You could have a tenderloin, you know,

[09:31] a skirt stick, you know, flank steak. Like those are very lean steaks. Actually, not super safe. Sorry,

[09:35] flank steak's lean. You could have top round. You could have a top surline. Like those are all very

[09:39] lean steaks. All of these are just very lean proteins. Chicken breasts, right? There's a million

[09:44] of these. But the point is is that a lean meat is a lean meat. And they're all about the same in terms of

[09:50] grams. If you needed to have 200 grams of protein, then you would have two pounds of lean meat.

[09:56] And that's what you would eat for the day. All right? Wait. Don't worry. What about the cookies and

[10:00] nice here? I'm going to get there. Now we have to figure out if we know how many calories we're

[10:03] getting per day. And we know how much protein we're eating, that we should figure out what's left of.

[10:08] So here's how you put it all together. One is we calculated our calories for our goal. So if we

[10:14] said we wanted to lose weight and we were 200 pounds and we did 11 sure because that we want to do

[10:18] moderate weight loss, we would eat 2,200 calories a day. Awesome. Second step. Here, we calculate

[10:25] protein for our body weight. So if we were 200, 200 pounds, we'd have 200 grams of protein.

[10:30] Great. Which is going to be 2 pounds of lean meat. Simple. Step 3. We're going to calculate

[10:35] our calories from our protein. All right? So roughly roughly. If you want to be all sciencey,

[10:43] four, four calories per gram is how many actual calories are in a gram of protein. But when you

[10:48] eat a source of protein like a chicken breast, there's also some fat in it, right? Even when

[10:54] it's super lean, there's still some fat. And so what we do, what I do, my back of napkin secret

[11:00] super method, is you just multiply it by five. The reason I do that is to say that I can count for a

[11:06] little bit of the fat that's going to be carried along with it. So if I'm going to have my 200 grams of

[11:10] protein times five, it means I'm going to eat about 1,000 calories, they're going to come for my

[11:13] protein sources. Great. So now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my step four, my 2200 calories,

[11:21] subtract my 1000 calories of protein, and I've got 1200 calories of whatever the hell I want.

[11:27] Every day, here's the secret to having the body you want for the rest of your life eating cookies

[11:32] every day and making every entrepreneur that you go to the masterminds with, feel like a moron,

[11:37] because you have six pack, you're eating ice cream and cookies and twizzlers and all the things

[11:40] that you want in this world while they are telling you about why they're bio-packing, right? And why

[11:44] they're burning so much fat right now, except they look the same every year. Here's the key.

[11:47] You eat the 1200 calories of whatever the hell you want, and you can do it every day. You can change

[11:51] what you want to eat in those 1200 calories every day if you feel like it. But the key point is that the

[11:56] cornerstone of the diet is that you get enough protein in. So you get your protein in first and then

[12:01] you fill up to the lid and whatever else you want. Now you may find out that a white potato is more

[12:07] filling than nerds ropes. I would know this from firsthand, but if you don't have a compulsive need to eat,

[12:13] right, which I don't, then you can control yourself and eat whatever the heck you want. I tend to

[12:18] not be that hungry as a person in general. And so I like to have more appetizing foods and I'd rather eat

[12:23] less of them, right? Some people love to have huge volumes of food, in which case you'll probably

[12:27] eat more whole foods, right? You'll probably have more potatoes and rice and all that kind of stuff.

[12:31] Right? The point is, is that once you just know those two numbers, how many calories you eat,

[12:36] how many grams of protein you need to have, you can eat for the rest of your life,

[12:40] never go on or off a diet ever again. And here's the cool part. You can split up those meals

[12:45] whatever way you want. All right? You can eat them. You can be like, I can have five meals a day.

[12:50] You can have three meals a day. You could have one meal a day. It doesn't matter. All right?

[12:54] Crazy. I know. It's like it's almost like they've been trying to sell you your whole lives. I know.

[12:59] All right? But the reason this is so cool is that you can't fall off, right? There's no like diet.

[13:04] Like you can eat whatever hell you want. Like it doesn't matter. You want to have ice cream every day.

[13:08] You guys remember that. And so if you're like, oh, like you can't, you won't feel like you're cheating

[13:12] on a cheat day because you have ice cream every day. Right? The best way to get people to

[13:17] become obsessed with food is to get them to restrict themselves from doing stuff because then they

[13:21] splurge and do a ton of it. But if you get ice cream every day, it stops being special.

[13:25] If you cook you's every day, it stops being special. Right? And so this is how I've eaten for almost

[13:30] 20 years. This has been the secret behind it. And I get very tired of seeing the entrepreneurial

[13:37] world get fooled with shenanigans of stuff that does not matter. That is why I wanted to share this

[13:43] with you. It's also like the number one question I get, which is like, hey, what do you eat every day?

[13:47] This is what I've eaten every day for almost 20 years. And all I do is I adjust the, you know,

[13:53] the goal up and down if I want to, you know, if I wanted to gain weight, I would eat the same two

[13:57] pounds of protein. I would just have more extra calories. If I wanted to have, it's basically

[14:02] have this base of protein that just protects your muscle. Right? And then everything else is just

[14:07] variable of just how many calories extra you want to eat. And you can eat them whatever you want.

[14:11] I want to make sure that I got all my little notes here that I remembered. But the big point here is

[14:15] that all this stuff works because you can't fall off. Right? You can't cheat because nothing is forbidden.

[14:21] Right? And no one is immune to a calorie deficit. Right? If you eat nothing long enough, you will lose weight.

[14:28] Everyone, like, like some people lose weight faster or slower, but everybody loses weight in deficit.

[14:32] That's it. That's the, that's the food portion of what Alex eats every day. And if you're an entrepreneur

[14:38] and you're like, man, I wish I could, you know, you're, you're obsessed with all this biohacking and

[14:42] all the supplements to try and to try and lose, lose fat faster, but you look the exact same

[14:48] years later. Then it's possible that maybe this stuff that you're doing doesn't work and it doesn't matter.

[14:54] And instead, you should take a page out of this. And, um, what's kind of funny is that I know

[15:00] just as much, if not more about fitness stuff than I do about business stuff, but I just have

[15:04] to talk about it in a very long time. And I don't want this channel to be a fitness channel. I just get

[15:08] really, really tired of the shenanigans and the top fullery that I see in the entrepreneurial space

[15:13] around this and people speak in these absolutes and they're completely false. And so anyways,

[15:19] I know that most of the nation you guys are intelligent and hopefully shredded and jacked in the future.

[15:25] And I want you to be able to hashtag never skip dessert while also having a sex pack.

[15:29] And that is why I made this video for you. So, uh, keep being awesome. Lots of love. If you enjoyed this

[15:33] hit sub, if you didn't, love you either way. Could you guys in the next video. Bye!

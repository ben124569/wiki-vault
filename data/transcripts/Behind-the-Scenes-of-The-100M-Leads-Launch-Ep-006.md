[00:00] There's a lot of things you can go wrong in launching something like this.

[00:02] You have half a million people.

[00:04] So you can look in a skyscraper look all the way around Baltimore and be like,

[00:06] more than everyone I can see with my eyes is registered for this event.

[00:15] Three, let me stay.

[00:16] I've been prepping for the presentation for two weeks.

[00:19] All day every day, I will not be the person who did not prepare.

[00:22] And I will do that workout in respect for everyone else's attention.

[00:24] Offerers was a meta example, meaning the book and the course and everything it was

[00:29] was purposely intended to be an offer so good.

[00:31] People would feel stupid saying, no, the book itself was an example of the concept of the book.

[00:35] So 100 of our leads is different in that I want the example for the book not to be around the offer,

[00:41] but around how we promote the book, about how we got leads, which is why this event

[00:45] we so important to use all the different advertising methods to promote the book.

[00:48] Like, I could have just made a post to my audience about the book and sold plenty of copies

[00:52] and not needed to do warm outreach or do affiliates or do hate ads.

[00:56] What's the point of this meeting?

[00:57] Well, problem are we solving?

[00:58] The most expensive cost in almost all companies is meetings.

[01:01] That was supposed to be our long meeting and we got off in 28 minutes.

[01:04] What problem were we solving?

[01:05] The second is who's required to solve it?

[01:07] If we know what the decision is, then it's like, I'm not needed to see it.

[01:10] It'll be on Shopify.

[01:11] Reason we didn't on Shopify was because there's a bunch of issues with Amazon for launching,

[01:14] but the main one was that they wouldn't accept the amount of books that we thought we were selling.

[01:18] Amazon limits any new book.

[01:20] Usually to 5,000 or 10,000 hardbacks and we had a pretty strong suspicion that we were going to sell a lot more than that.

[01:25] So for that reason, we basically fronted all the money, did all the prints because we were self-published.

[01:30] So we're housing and we're shipping it where we're housing it.

[01:32] I don't like anyone owning my stuff.

[01:34] So whenever you publish about it, you actually sell the rights to your content.

[01:37] Kind of like musicians where they sell their music to a label, same concept.

[01:41] For me to give you guys like a free chapter, so the fact that offers was a dollar ninety-nine cents.

[01:45] Those are all things that an overpubbisher wouldn't want me to do because that's where they would make their money.

[01:49] I want every person there to watch this presentation to be like, I ain't fucking work harder.

[01:53] Like if that's like the deepest takeaway from this whole thing, then like I can die pretty happy.

[01:57] I mean most people spend their entire lives not being able to like in 4,500,000 people.

[02:00] And so like it's not lost on me.

[02:04] Straight to the cookie, huh?

[02:08] My work, my fucking, yeah, good morning.

[02:11] Thank you for sharing it.

[02:12] Trevor is probably the close thing to your brother to me.

[02:15] Honestly, we co-wrote the books.

[02:17] I get a disproportionate amount of credit.

[02:18] But Trevor has definitely been the one that has helped me beat up everything like, yeah.

[02:23] He's been in a really involved in my life for a long time now and I hope we can grow old and crotch it together.

[02:27] Welcome everyone to my book launch event.

[02:30] I'm so pumped to have you guys here.

[02:32] I promise I have spent a very long time time to compress days and weeks and kind of like a stand up routine.

[02:38] A stand up routine that 60 minutes has taken nine months to perfect like each 30 seconds bit that shrunk together, created an hour.

[02:45] And so it's kind of the same way with this presentation.

[02:47] It's that like it's gazillions of hours compressed into that.

[02:51] And that's why hopefully the value per second will just be like incredibly high.

[02:54] My first presentation, it was just like a few words and then I would talk at the slide over time.

[02:59] And then I started adding more like bullets and text aside.

[03:02] And then I watched this presentation actually changed my life to 15 minute TED Talk.

[03:05] It was called like death by PowerPoint.

[03:06] It actually like forever changed how I made presentations, which is like one idea per slide.

[03:11] But then I got from the marketing and sales world to pair the idea with a visual.

[03:17] Yeah, I just wanted to work.

[03:18] That's all I want from my birthday is that all the tech works.

[03:20] It's that I just want the links to work, I want the page to work, I want the processing to work.

[03:28] There's a huge amount of like Aussies and New Zealanders who are staying up as like entrepreneurs parties.

[03:35] So cool.

[03:35] Yeah, I know.

[03:36] So I've got a bunch of guys who have like you know 1,000, 2,000 person communities that are helping each other up for the event.

[03:44] See what we got going on.

[03:46] Pre-set up for tomorrow.

[03:48] Check this out.

[03:50] This is the 360.

[03:53] Wow.

[03:54] When I dropped the offer, people probably lose their minds.

[03:58] I have stacked it for like 17 minutes.

[04:01] I just want to show the reaction.

[04:03] So the stack is a direct sales tactic that has been proven so many times across so many industries.

[04:09] That it is effective.

[04:10] The goal for this presentation was to be remembered.

[04:13] And so if I wanted someone to have an emotional experience going through this, then I have to subvert the audience in a way.

[04:20] I think that the stack accomplished that.

[04:23] Trace the making of movie.

[04:24] Yeah, basically it's axler.

[04:26] All right.

[04:28] Oh, rocker on.

[04:35] What are the things that can go wrong right now?

[04:37] Like let me go wrong.

[04:38] What we can't control.

[04:39] Okay.

[04:40] Yeah, just like zoom in general.

[04:41] Tomorrow is the big day.

[04:45] Yeah, it's a more specific day.

[04:47] So there's one birthday.

[04:48] Honestly, I'm just excited for you guys to turn to it.

[04:51] It's not even the event.

[04:52] I'm excited for the post that happened one day, two day, three days, four days later after people have consumed.

[04:57] You know, read the book, cover the cover and read it a second time.

[05:00] I started going through the chorus and listen to the audio book.

[05:02] That's how I'm more excited about it.

[05:03] But tomorrow is the first step to that.

[05:05] And I'll see you then.

[05:07] How many check in we have?

[05:11] People over 100,000 in the check in and the current in the feed.

[05:15] Oh, I'm ready.

[05:17] Jim, right you up.

[05:19] Two, nine years of Bulgaria, Philly, Saxon, San Francisco.

[05:23] Super cool.

[05:24] They're coming in.

[05:25] International baby.

[05:26] Yeah, I'm leveled over here.

[05:27] Around the world.

[05:28] So some of those people got to wait and ask if they don't just melt.

[05:31] Melt is just puddles.

[05:32] Make sure to text that on the topic of my life right now.

[05:36] We're going to have to do it.

[05:37] We want to zero.

[05:38] So the no strip said you want to zero for the last half of any months.

[05:41] Our team is used one of one content as kind of our concept, which is.

[05:45] You only want to say things that only you can say and show things only you can show.

[05:48] Then as the team started to find out all the things that we're going to be releasing and giving away and doing what no one else would do.

[05:54] The team said in the chat like, do this isn't even one or one.

[05:57] This is one of zero.

[05:58] What are you doing that no one?

[05:59] And I think that raises the bar a lot more.

[06:02] I'm scared by that bar.

[06:03] But I like that bar as an ideal to strive towards.

[06:07] More 10 minutes.

[06:09] You ready?

[06:11] Going to be around.

[06:12] Twist and turn.

[06:13] On this roller coaster.

[06:15] Layla so worried.

[06:16] She's like wait, you changed something?

[06:18] Let's not go yet.

[06:19] Now I'm excited to see the reactions.

[06:21] Because there's going to be 15 minutes of suspense where they're like, is he going to sell something right now?

[06:26] The good news is I have done this before.

[06:29] A lot of times.

[06:31] I know how much work I put into it.

[06:33] When you're in front of the crowd, the only person's confidence who matters is yours.

[06:37] There are men of talent and men of preparation for it to be the latter.

[06:40] So little to I know that as soon as I stepped on stage,

[06:43] like three massive tech issues break behind the scenes,

[06:46] based on the sheer volume of clicks that we're going at the same time for the same thing.

[06:52] Let's get some late.

[06:54] Everything ready?

[06:57] I think a lot of you have any issues with the low price.

[07:00] It's really good.

[07:02] What is the link somewhere?

[07:03] We had 562,000 link clicks in a matter of like 60 seconds.

[07:08] Whenever you have something like that, it's going to put stress on systems that is very hard to test for.

[07:12] You can run simulators which we had and we still had more people than the infrastructure could handle.

[07:17] I would send them to YouTube.

[07:23] So here's a 140,000 people are so we're not able to get in.

[07:26] The team pivoted on the fly and provided the YouTube link.

[07:29] We had another 40 or 50,000 people who made it over on that side.

[07:32] People can talk under mice.

[07:34] Yeah, that's what I've been telling you.

[07:36] The second thing was that there were some zoom rooms that the master zoom thing wasn't set up the right way

[07:40] so that they could like unmute themselves rather than like webinar presenter format.

[07:43] Now we ended up quickly fixing that.

[07:46] Well, YouTube says it's a lot of people.

[07:48] The YouTube live stream ended up being three minutes delayed and those were very three important minutes during the entire launch event.

[07:55] And so we were able to save 40,000ish people on YouTube.

[07:58] But during that first five or so minutes, there was a lot of hustle and bustle of trying to figure out what we were going to do to house literally a city of people.

[08:05] So you're going to get lead magma mastery.

[08:06] You're going to get the first five flying firmer.

[08:07] You're going to get the most immediate concept method to build a bridge you want.

[08:09] You're going to get the cold outreach playbook.

[08:11] You're going to get the paydats playbook.

[08:12] You're going to have the referral playbook.

[08:14] And you're going to get the affiliate playbook.

[08:16] And the zero to $100 million scaling road map from someone who's actually been there.

[08:20] Total value 12, 76.

[08:21] I could see the comments the whole time.

[08:23] And I say this with absolute confidence.

[08:25] I will bet that you cannot see that I can see the comments in how I was presenting.

[08:29] How much is double your lead flow worth?

[08:30] An extra 10,000 year?

[08:32] An extra 50,000 year?

[08:34] An extra 100,000 year?

[08:35] An extra $100,000 year?

[08:36] An extra $1 million a year?

[08:37] I knew that everyone would turn on me for a brief moment.

[08:41] All I could think is like this is going exactly how I want it.

[08:45] I'm not going to ask for 12,000 76.

[08:47] Even though it would be totally reasonable and a bargain.

[08:50] I'm not going to ask for $4,999.

[08:52] I'm not even going to ask for $2,999.

[08:55] I'm going to give you access to everything we talked about today for a single payment of.

[09:03] Taking the extra four seconds, five seconds.

[09:07] When the world is watching, I wanted to sit in it and just hold and just kind of enjoy the moment.

[09:13] Single payment of.

[09:15] I know what they don't know.

[09:17] And I believe that that's how some of the best sales presentations are supposed to be.

[09:21] I went from villain to hero in 10 seconds.

[09:26] It's free.

[09:32] Love you guys.

[09:38] We're already almost halfway on it.

[09:40] Good.

[09:41] Oh, thank you.

[09:42] Thanks, Wade.

[09:43] Thanks.

[09:44] You did better.

[09:46] Thanks.

[09:47] Thanks.

[09:48] Thanks.

[09:49] Thank you.

[09:50] There were some dark days in the middle of the stack there.

[09:53] You got to touch the bottom of the pool.

[09:54] That's what makes it memorable.

[09:55] Despite all the heat that I was getting, I knew the rubber band was going to snap back.

[10:00] The moment they saw the truth, they just had to wait.

[10:03] Roll across your eye.

[10:04] You don't look good.

[10:05] You don't even know how to do that.

[10:07] You have no idea.

[10:08] It's like I was so not sure.

[10:09] I was like, I think I am going to throw up.

[10:11] I think that more people trust us now to continue to keep our promises in a world that breaks

[10:17] them and more people believe us when we say we are a long-term focused because we didn't take

[10:23] the $50 million payday.

[10:25] There was one comment.

[10:26] It was actually my favorite comment on all the ones that I saw.

[10:28] You could have made bank but you chose to make history.

[10:31] And I thought that was like, that was the fucking point.

[10:35] That was the point.

[10:36] Good job.

[10:37] That was just only two years of our lives.

[10:41] Just about 100,000 books sold the first day.

[10:43] So, offers is sold just under 500,000 copies.

[10:46] Over two years to sell 100,000 in a day was pretty cool to sell 20% of my offers.

[10:51] It's all big shoes to fill.

[10:53] But I actually think that leads with some more copies that offers us.

[10:55] And I think that's because more people perceive they have the problem of not having

[10:58] leads than not having it off.

[11:00] The aftermath.

[11:01] We're not even done the first week as I'm reporting this.

[11:03] But my name was trending on all of Twitter.

[11:06] The leads audiobook is seven on all of Amazon.

[11:09] We went from 50 to 26 on all podcasts.

[11:13] We're number one in entrepreneurship.

[11:15] We're number two in business.

[11:16] Like, I'm actually like emotional about it.

[11:19] Something that has never been done before.

[11:21] I actually truly believe that what he just did with this launch is going to just have

[11:28] shockwave.

[11:29] Do you agree with people that are saying that you changed the industry?

[11:33] If we're defining change the industry as many people are actively in terms of how they do business

[11:38] afterwards, then I would say yes.

[11:40] Not everyone, but certainly some people will.

[11:42] The people who have longer time horizons who want to build bigger, more lasting businesses

[11:46] for sure.

[11:47] A brand is based on the associations that people make.

[11:50] I knew that having a massive historic event and having the thing still be more valuable

[11:55] in everyone else's and free was something that I wanted to associate myself with.

[12:00] But if you measure on a one-year time horizon, then it will never make sense.

[12:04] This is cool.

[12:05] This is very cool.

[12:06] This is very cool.

[12:07] This is very, very, very, very beautiful.

[12:09] I should want to say, thank you guys so much for coming out.

[12:12] It means the world to me.

[12:13] It's one of the very small things that Trevor and I spent two years writing this book.

[12:17] I just want to say thank you.

[12:18] It means the last one.

[12:19] I'm done.

[12:20] Thank you.

[12:21] You know the day I will die and on a long-up time horizon, I will be forgotten.

[12:26] And the only thing that I can say that helped that might be eternal is skills and education

[12:32] that I can pass on to other people.

[12:34] Trevor used to tell me when I was going through kind of like harder times with the edits because it was very tough to edit this book and write this book.

[12:39] He said, there's a 17 year old who's going to sleep with this book under his pillow to get out of his situation, you owe it to him.

[12:44] And that's what was kind of like the continuously reinforcing mental frame that I had to pull me through it.

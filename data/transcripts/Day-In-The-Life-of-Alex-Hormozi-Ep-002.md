[00:00] Most of the nation, this is a day in the life for Lailin Eye.

[00:05] We flew out to do two keynotes in Orlando, Florida.

[00:08] I think you'll dig the presentation on branding.

[00:10] I've never talked about it, pumpkin.

[00:13] The first time we took a private jet was out of necessity.

[00:17] We were in Puerto Rico and it was right as Hurricane Maria was hitting.

[00:20] We see the news about it and I check flights and the flights are all like multiple connections.

[00:24] Do we drink a couple of coffee and then like more news is like this looks like it might

[00:27] be really serious and I checked the flights again.

[00:29] Oh, God.

[00:30] Alright, well we're going to be here, you know, it's fine.

[00:32] And then we go to the grocery store to like pick up some water, whatever.

[00:35] And two people are getting a fist fight over water in the eye.

[00:37] People are fucking sprinting around the store.

[00:40] She's like we have to get off this island.

[00:42] I was like, do you want to be here when they did?

[00:44] Get back to our house and this old guy has this massive yacht.

[00:46] He's our neighbor.

[00:47] I was like, oh, what are you going to do with that?

[00:48] He's like, oh, it'll just get destroyed.

[00:49] And I was like, what?

[00:50] Well, he's like, you should be fine.

[00:51] He's just go to the third story, the first two floors in flood.

[00:54] And Lailin at this point is like we're getting off this fucking island.

[00:57] She was like, charter a plate.

[00:59] And I was like, my, this is like the beginning of our wealth.

[01:02] And I was like, I Google, she's calling, playing.

[01:04] I put her on speaker phone.

[01:05] He didn't get off water.

[01:05] He go.

[01:06] He was like, it'll be 70 grand.

[01:07] And like we both looked each other.

[01:09] And I was like, so excited.

[01:10] She was like, yeah, we're decided.

[01:11] We both had come to completely separate conclusions from that number.

[01:15] I was like, so we're staying.

[01:16] She's like, so we're going.

[01:17] Right.

[01:18] And then she looked, she's like, what is my life worth to you?

[01:19] I was like, we fucking kidding me 35 grand to save my life.

[01:23] I was like, what was it 35?

[01:24] It was 70.

[01:25] What's that for mine?

[01:26] 35 crores.

[01:28] Is that call like three other charters?

[01:29] And I'm like, I got a guy who says you can do it for 50.

[01:32] He used like, I'll do it for 40.

[01:33] I call it another guy.

[01:34] It's like, fine.

[01:34] Right.

[01:35] This is the last day you can go off the island.

[01:37] And so like literally when he's like, I got a call

[01:39] to get a price.

[01:39] I was like, oh my god, three out four hours.

[01:41] I got a guy who's like, I'll do it for 28.

[01:43] And I was like, cool.

[01:44] He's like, but you have to leave in two hours.

[01:46] What's straight to the airport?

[01:47] And they were like, oh, actually it's coming

[01:48] to fashion.

[01:49] We thought like, these will be the last planes out.

[01:50] We got in the plane.

[01:51] And it was the first time my life where money actually

[01:54] did something like useful for me.

[01:55] I was getting to my car at the gym the other day.

[02:12] I get in the car and I have the window down.

[02:14] And this guy's like, hey, and I was like,

[02:15] I actually announced my presence.

[02:18] Like, whenever I walked through him, like, I'm here.

[02:21] If she doesn't hear me, she's just pre-show.

[02:23] When you sat in the chair, the fucking dark with a psycho.

[02:25] And then you got mad at me when I cried.

[02:28] He scared me so bad I started crying.

[02:31] I woke up and he wasn't in bed, right?

[02:33] Then I go to bathroom.

[02:34] I come back out.

[02:35] I just assumed he's left.

[02:37] I just hear, hey.

[02:39] Hey.

[02:40] The cream and like cuddle.

[02:42] And then I just start crying.

[02:44] And then he's like, what the fuck?

[02:46] I was trying not to wait you.

[02:48] I just, I'm awake.

[02:53] I made podcasts for four years.

[02:58] What's going on everybody?

[02:59] I am coming here to pick one that I'm excited to go up.

[03:03] And like, real talk?

[03:04] There were just as good as the ones I have now.

[03:05] Years.

[03:06] Not like-

[03:06] Oh, I did it for 90 days.

[03:08] Four years.

[03:09] Two to three podcasts a week, every week.

[03:11] And then on the fifth year, it hit.

[03:14] The real real is that it was just packaged as gym specific.

[03:17] I'd say like, my biggest learning of even the last two years of my career has been

[03:22] packaging.

[03:23] Everything I was taught early, my career's niche down.

[03:25] And so I did that and I maximized a niche.

[03:28] But like at some point, you maximize a niche and you have to go further.

[03:33] I always am like slow to make those big moves because I want to make sure I'm not doing

[03:38] it out of being ADD.

[03:39] That was a super tough call.

[03:41] It's September 19th, September 20th.

[03:42] Rebranded it as the game.

[03:43] I just remember there was one day I was like, I don't feel like talking about gym stuff anymore.

[03:46] I can talk about business.

[03:47] But like a lot of it for me has always been I'm so afraid to talk about something that

[03:51] like I want to make sure I'm legit if I'm going to talk about it when I had the gyms.

[03:55] Hey guys, I'm Alex and I'm the owner of United Fitness.

[03:58] I had six.

[03:59] I did six and then I had 30 plus turn rounds before I ever made a single piece of content

[04:02] about like how you could run a gym better.

[04:03] So I was like, okay, well I've been to 30 plus markets.

[04:05] I had six of my own.

[04:06] I was like, I feel confident in saying like, these things work better than these ones.

[04:09] I wanted to over-credentialize myself for whatever content I was going to make so that I felt

[04:14] like I could take whatever heat someone was going to throw out.

[04:16] Maybe because I'd be like, well, here's why I think that.

[04:18] Here's my evidence and I think that approach has been good.

[04:22] It just takes longer.

[04:23] I think the jerseys are dope.

[04:24] Can I try that on?

[04:25] I could rock a little double double.

[04:29] If you look at McConaughey when he went from Ramcom, Ramcom, Ramcom, Ramcom, he basically

[04:32] like disappeared from the scene and then came back and like did Dallas, Bires club, well

[04:36] for Wall Street and these other movies where he took a serious roles on, etc.

[04:39] I was making all gyms stuff.

[04:41] I wanted to push myself away from all gyms stuff.

[04:43] Kail became more public facing.

[04:45] I kind of subcumped to the background.

[04:46] The only thing I produced at that point was the podcast which I'd rebranded is the game.

[04:49] But I still wasn't doing anything else that was public and I was like a year or two.

[04:53] And then I started making content publicly.

[04:55] So I feel like sometimes you have to give a little bit of distance, kind of reset and then

[04:59] you go out with whatever the new kind of direction you want to go with.

[05:03] It's me exactly what I did at the Q&A for the VIP day.

[05:06] I'm going to get up there.

[05:07] I'm going to write all of the topics I want to talk about and I'm just going to like

[05:10] hit them in whatever or feels good.

[05:13] I feel good about it.

[05:15] Or it'll blow.

[05:19] I envision a day where we have like the shareholder meetings where all the companies come

[05:24] out and we have that big convention.

[05:25] All the portfolio companies.

[05:28] The whole theme of the presentation is actually on strategy which is like I'll be like

[05:32] what's the fuck with that game.

[05:33] I like it and I'll break it down.

[05:34] I'm like it just means doing the thing you get the most big put-buck.

[05:39] You guys are killing the vibe.

[05:40] I heard the vibes like yeah, I just got to bring the energy.

[05:43] I'm going to briefly hit on brand.

[05:44] It's like if you build a personal brand then you'll make more money from that than your

[05:48] gym but then what are we talking for?

[05:50] You know what I mean?

[05:51] It's the principal stuff.

[05:52] Yeah.

[05:53] We're having a look at our online stage.

[06:00] Rather than do slides which is normally what I do, I actually want to draw the stuff

[06:05] live with you and I think it's more engaging that way.

[06:08] If you've ever seen like a math problem on a board and it's just like all done versus

[06:12] like someone walking through the math, it's different.

[06:14] That's at least the theory and if it sucks you can tell me at the end.

[06:17] Brand isn't actually a thing.

[06:20] It's an association we make between things that we know and things that people don't know

[06:24] which is usually our company.

[06:26] If you think about a brand like a bouquet of flowers, a bouquet of flowers isn't actually a

[06:31] thing.

[06:32] It's many things put together and then we put it in our heads as an idea as one but it doesn't

[06:36] it's not actually anything because if you spill it on the floor it's not a bouquet anymore.

[06:39] Think of a brand as a bouquet of flowers but it's your bouquet of flowers and what you're

[06:44] putting inside of that bouquet are the individual intangible ideas that you want to

[06:49] associate together with the thing that people don't know about which is usually

[06:52] your company.

[06:53] If I were to say some things about my brand you probably know that I have the best

[06:58] calves ever.

[06:59] That would be something that's associated with my brand.

[07:02] Desire.

[07:03] That's something that's associated with my brand.

[07:05] Now those are like fun little due dads but hopefully some of the things that you really

[07:09] associate with my brand are giving first writing value being patient doing the boring

[07:15] work and the reason brand and reputation is so hard to maintain is because so many people

[07:20] want to rub their shit on yours.

[07:22] So let's say here's my bouquet then I've got this sad flower so this is a sad face flower.

[07:28] If I handed my wife this bouquet all of the roses are perfect and there's this one this

[07:34] just wilted and dead.

[07:35] The bouquet, the brand, the perception of it, massively shifts even with one fucked up

[07:40] flower.

[07:42] And so that's why creating a brand is much more about cultivating deliberately the associations

[07:47] you want to make with the thing you have that people don't know with the things that

[07:50] your ideal audience likes that you want them to like too.

[08:03] Oh thank you.

[08:04] Huh?

[08:05] Yeah?

[08:06] Different.

[08:07] I like it.

[08:08] I like it.

[08:09] It's great because you're just yourself.

[08:11] Cool.

[08:12] This used to be the first song in my playlist for working out.

[08:15] Get my calves going.

[08:16] I can choreograph way more like symphony of feelings and visuals and charts and grass when

[08:21] I do the presentation.

[08:22] I mean from a prep time though, way less.

[08:24] My presentations are typically five slides per minute because I actually think about it as like

[08:29] a movement of doing a voiceover on a film.

[08:30] There's this amazing video.

[08:32] I think it's called Death by Powerpoint.

[08:33] So it's basically just like one idea, one image that's it.

[08:37] Next idea, next image that's it.

[08:38] You do that.

[08:39] That's only like 30 to 40 seconds.

[08:40] You're like that's why it's only slides.

[08:42] I mean you saw 840 slides for the training thing that we're going to do.

[08:46] That's how you build great training.

[08:47] I always enjoy meeting greets with most of the nation because I get to hear like the real

[08:51] problems that you guys are going through.

[08:52] I can go a little bit deeper than I normally can on like comments or like a short piece, which makes

[08:57] one of my favorites to interact just in general.

[08:59] One would be your number one advice on how to get the attractive talent because some people say

[09:03] you want to make the talent yourself.

[09:05] Some people say you want to try to force the whole of the places.

[09:08] I think you do both.

[09:09] I think it's an end.

[09:10] Do you want to have all the training you can because that gets you cheaper talent that you then

[09:13] level up but it costs as time.

[09:14] The more money you get, the more you buy talent rather than building it.

[09:17] And sometimes you spend all this time training somebody that you realize that they're

[09:21] helping on that.

[09:22] If you were to internalize it's like I'm not good at picking the right people.

[09:25] I'm not good at training them.

[09:26] Like as those are controllables that they have that person.

[09:28] If you internalize it.

[09:29] So for a gym for example, what happens when you're in a gym like that or try to

[09:32] like put your clients.

[09:33] I think both.

[09:34] There's all those ways.

[09:35] You can reach out, you can do content, you can run ads.

[09:38] Just like you get customers, you get employed.

[09:41] Same as you.

[09:42] You talk about your school with your dad and your dad.

[09:44] You gave me that.

[09:45] Yeah, confidence to meet them.

[09:47] Wow.

[09:48] You've been so well-known.

[09:49] Right?

[09:50] I know you talked about you with a consulting job with the government and it's

[09:52] seemingly fancy but you just weren't happy.

[09:54] Yeah.

[09:55] But we'll give you the courage to be okay to support your dad.

[09:57] I just didn't feel like being alive anymore.

[10:00] For me, that was my thing.

[10:01] It doesn't have to be that for you.

[10:02] For me, it was like, well, I don't feel like being alive.

[10:05] Like the actual phrase I could for me to do myself is I have to die to hand in order to live for me.

[10:09] I needed a new life.

[10:10] If that man was going to accept the new life, would he?

[10:12] Didn't it be a thing?

[10:13] I just had to be cool with him.

[10:15] And I think that's a lot of that's like the journey for a lot of guys like becoming a man is like

[10:19] when you chart value your own opinion of you more than your father or your cousin or

[10:23] whatever.

[10:24] It's like you basically elevate your own opinion itself and other people's and then you become

[10:28] more independent.

[10:29] Like that's how you become independent.

[10:30] Who's my hardest thing?

[10:31] I think I got a job.

[10:32] But we got one pick one.

[10:34] Alright.

[10:35] Alright guys, I got a head.

[10:36] No, you're good.

[10:37] You're good.

[10:38] You're good.

[10:39] I got a gut.

[10:40] Alright.

[10:41] I actually really liked these.

[10:45] Mine's got like fighting bodybuilding.

[10:48] It's fighting a bodybuilding.

[10:49] Comedy's harder to click on because the other two are so much more visual.

[10:52] If there's just a dude with him like I'm like I don't know if it's just going to be

[10:55] funny but I do know this guy's jack.

[10:56] It would be interesting if images make a comeback.

[10:59] Because I will say this when I look at someone's their profile.

[11:02] I actually go only for the images because I don't feel like watching videos.

[11:06] It just feels more chill.

[11:08] So my next book is coming out and I'm stoked.

[11:12] So here's a sneak peek.

[11:13] It'll be interesting because I think part of what I want to talk about maybe even at the

[11:17] f**k just I don't know if I want to do it with the f**k.

[11:19] Maybe it'll be like they're probably because the f**k is going to be like raw.

[11:21] Maybe post f**k.

[11:23] I'll be like how to get the most out of this book.

[11:25] When I look at my audience 76% of people want to start a business.

[11:27] So like you should read it from the beginning to the end because you won't have context on any of this.

[11:32] If you have a business, leave magnets referrals because everyone else customers

[11:35] the core for way that you advertise and then the way to make that way better,

[11:39] which is the core for and so on.

[11:40] And then from there you know, read the other ones.

[11:42] Hey sweetie.

[11:43] Hey, baby.

[11:44] Hey, baby.

[11:45] Hey, supermodel.

[11:52] Way was doing her thing.

[11:54] That's my one.

[11:55] I see that.

[11:56] Yeah.

[11:57] The starman can make the whole thing.

[11:59] She's been a brand in the app for ages.

[12:01] She is.

[12:02] I'm the pretty face.

[12:03] You guys can.

[12:04] Here you go.

[12:05] Okay.

[12:06] What I want to do today is talk about how to get other people to do stuff.

[12:11] Like make you money.

[12:13] These are the principles.

[12:14] Like I said that we have used to build gym launch,

[12:16] prestige labs and now acquisition.com.

[12:19] You're booked helping make like 300 bands.

[12:24] So I really appreciate that.

[12:26] Again, really good.

[12:28] You're really good.

[12:29] That's it.

[12:30] We're at acquisition.com.

[12:32] Crack.

[12:34] So it's great.

[12:35] No, that's super super.

[12:36] Thank you so much, man.

[12:37] All the corner of our garage is really.

[12:38] Best rules for our shit battery.

[12:39] Do you want to be a bird?

[12:40] Ha ha.

[12:44] So it's just you and me on stage.

[12:46] That's what we just do like we always do.

[12:48] Hold on.

[15:47] Would you like to talk about the meaning of your life?

[15:50] No.

[15:51] Okay.

[15:52] I don't know.

[15:53] A lot of people there were just imagination and we're not.

[15:56] It's a lot of single questions about yours.

[15:58] I was surprised.

[16:00] Last day here at JimCon, I've got one more talk and we're going to go and ask some of the attendees for more questions about their businesses.

[16:07] I had this class in music.

[16:09] I teach you get everybody a project.

[16:10] Basically just like really heavily researched one song.

[16:12] And that was the whole class.

[16:13] It was like one personal research the song.

[16:15] They'd play the song for three minutes or whatever it was.

[16:17] And then 27 minutes would be them giving like a full report.

[16:20] And now that I say it out loud, he just figured out how to not teach anything.

[16:24] Really?

[16:25] Like I got the highest grade in the class.

[16:27] Did his thing on hurt.

[16:28] As soon as you play that song, I'm like, yes, fuck off.

[16:30] I'm like, I honestly think that was one of the best things ever happened on nine inch notes.

[16:34] The fact that Johnny Cash covered someone else's song.

[16:37] You should have seen a video.

[16:38] I'll play it for you.

[16:39] It's safe.

[16:43] Oh.

[16:44] Oh.

[16:45] Oh.

[16:46] Oh.

[16:47] Oh.

[16:48] Oh.

[16:49] Oh.

[16:50] So good.

[16:51] Dude, he died seven months after this video.

[16:53] These are some sandals, water sandals.

[16:56] I think, or hiking sandals.

[16:57] I wear these because I can wear these in the most environments.

[17:00] I can wear these to the gym, which I actually really like.

[17:02] I can walk in them.

[17:03] I can wear these in water.

[17:04] I can wear these on the beach.

[17:05] They're closed to us.

[17:06] I can wear the most restaurants.

[17:07] And I don't have to wear socks.

[17:08] What else do you need?

[17:09] Even in times I go to the pool.

[17:11] And come out and go to a restaurant after going to the gym.

[17:14] And it's pretty exciting.

[17:15] I want to stay in front of the park.

[17:16] Dude, this is a fucking Darwin outfit.

[17:17] Literally yesterday, we did the talk.

[17:19] Then I went to the pool.

[17:20] Then I walked.

[17:21] Then I went to a fancy restaurant.

[17:22] Brian, like 20 minutes.

[17:23] You have an user stretchy.

[17:24] You're a last thing.

[17:25] It's the best.

[17:26] Everyone else's shorts are inferior to one.

[17:28] Oh.

[17:29] You even know about that.

[17:30] Like you're just not a stop.

[17:31] We get wet.

[17:32] You're fucked.

[17:33] We go to a nice restaurant.

[17:34] I'm here for a break.

[17:35] I'm here for a break.

[17:36] All right.

[17:37] I'm up.

[17:38] The third time I've been in the dress.

[17:40] Alex, are you ready?

[17:41] I'm ready.

[17:42] Thank you.

[17:43] We're going to do a cool deep dive together on a topic that I called nearer to my heart, which is closing.

[17:51] The difference between help and manipulation is intention.

[17:55] Either way, you're going to change someone's behavior or your intention is to change someone's behavior.

[17:59] If the prospect knew everything that you knew, they should make the decision to buy.

[18:02] If you're being really honest with yourself, if the prospect knew everything that you knew,

[18:05] and then they would choose not to buy, then you were deceiving them.

[18:08] Which is no bueno.

[18:09] But this presentation will be the best presentation on sales you've ever heard.

[18:11] The worst presentation on sales you've ever heard or somewhere in between that is a promise.

[18:15] Charlie Munger, a big hero of mine, he said we have a high, more responsibility be rational.

[18:20] Sometimes you've got logical buyers, sometimes you've got emotional buyers.

[18:22] There are different types of people who buy in different styles, just like they're different selling styles, different buying styles.

[18:26] People want to believe you.

[18:27] They want to buy.

[18:28] You just have to help their logical brains justify this decision.

[18:31] Like, most people are like, hey, I can make you a lot more money.

[18:33] They want to believe you.

[18:34] You just have to help them justify it.

[18:35] I can help you get into your high school jeans.

[18:37] I can make you look the way you did 20 years ago.

[18:40] They want to believe you.

[18:41] Make the decision to help yourself.

[18:43] And put me like crazy.

[18:44] Take ownership.

[18:45] Realize that there are no silver bullets.

[18:47] But some things can move you closer to your goals.

[18:49] And when those rare acceleration opportunities come in life,

[18:52] take them.

[18:53] Because either win or you learn and both of those get you closer to wherever it is you want to go.

[18:56] Thank you.

[18:58] Overall, it's awesome to have a fun gym con.

[19:02] It's great to see the gym owners in our community there.

[19:04] If you're a good one, comment below.

[19:06] If you want to see more vlogs, stuff like this.

[19:09] Bye.

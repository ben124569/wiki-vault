[00:00] $2.4 million in additional profit in five days.

[00:05] That's what one email campaign that we did in one of our

[00:07] portfolio companies generated.

[00:09] And if you don't know how I am, my name is Oximozi,

[00:10] I'm an actress, not com, it's a portfolio company.

[00:12] It's just over $250 million a year.

[00:14] And I make these videos so that hopefully you can

[00:16] grow your business and make lots of money.

[00:18] And then maybe someday I can invest in your business

[00:19] and help a grow-to.

[00:20] I want to walk you through step-by-step exactly

[00:23] what we did in this email campaign so that you can use

[00:25] the same thing in your business to get ideally,

[00:28] even better results.

[00:29] So let me walk you the context of this business.

[00:31] Number one is it's a business that relies predominantly

[00:33] on paid-outs.

[00:34] It's a consumer-based business.

[00:35] So lots of media to generate lots of volume

[00:38] of transactions and leads.

[00:39] So we had a very large email list.

[00:42] And for the most part, we weren't doing much with that email

[00:45] list besides following up for the initial transaction.

[00:47] And then after that they were dead to us,

[00:49] which I definitely don't recommend doing.

[00:51] But at the time, going into this,

[00:52] it wasn't a constraint of the business.

[00:54] And then if you came on, because all of a sudden

[00:56] some of our ads weren't performing as well.

[00:57] And all of a sudden, we thought, oh my gosh,

[00:59] we might not had our quarterly revenue goals.

[01:01] What else can we figure out?

[01:02] Enter the email campaign.

[01:04] Cool.

[01:05] So let's walk through the numbers.

[01:06] So the email list size was 3.3 million emails.

[01:11] Now this was over a few years that we collected these emails.

[01:14] And it was a traditional thing about like an e-commerce set up.

[01:17] So it was an opt-in and then a sale and then upsells.

[01:21] So the next new age of number that we need to know is

[01:22] that this was a $2,000 price point.

[01:26] And we had an upsell on the back end for about $8,000.

[01:31] That is a certain percentage customers would take.

[01:34] Now the next piece that's important for this

[01:36] is that we had buyers and non-bires that were on the list.

[01:40] So this was just a total list of everyone that we had ever had.

[01:44] Now in this business traditionally, to sell just this $2,000

[01:47] item, our cost to a car customer was $1,200.

[01:52] So not a lot of margin there left over.

[01:55] Now you can do this because it's an automated selling machine.

[01:57] So you can just crank on that.

[01:58] It's been with this particular business does.

[02:00] It's a nine-figure company in terms of annual revenue.

[02:02] But we're like, hey, one of the other stats

[02:05] about email that's important is that the cost to a car customer

[02:08] on e-mail once you've already acquired the lead is $0, which,

[02:12] if I can have free customers, that means whatever my growth

[02:15] profit is of selling my main thing, drops straight to my bottom line.

[02:19] And so as a mental construct for this,

[02:21] I like to think about e-mail kind of like a long-term investment account.

[02:25] And so it's like, you run ads every single day

[02:27] or you do outbound or whatever it is to build your list up.

[02:31] And that's kind of like your paycheck, right?

[02:32] Like you put work in and you get paid back, right?

[02:35] And it's just just like a direct relationship.

[02:38] Whereas the e-mail is kind of like your 401k.

[02:40] It's kind of like your investment account that you put.

[02:42] You put money into it in an overtime,

[02:43] it starts to compound and compound and compound.

[02:45] And if you have an e-mail strategy,

[02:47] and I'm going to give you kind of an overarching e-mail strategy

[02:49] that we like to employ in businesses.

[02:51] This business just is crushed, doing, we've been doing.

[02:53] So it hasn't been the main focus.

[02:55] But if you have a business like it is one of the easiest ways

[02:57] to just immediately plug in and print money.

[02:59] And the nice thing is is that even if it's late to the game,

[03:02] I mean this business does a lot of money,

[03:05] you can still employ it and then immediately see the results.

[03:08] There's two things about e-mail and having follow-up

[03:12] beyond a initial follow-up that makes a business more valuable.

[03:15] Number one is that all sales that will come from e-mail

[03:18] are going to drop straight to the bottom line in terms of profit.

[03:20] And so most businesses, 95% of businesses are traded

[03:24] on a multiple of bottom line.

[03:26] And so since these sales drop straight to the bottom line,

[03:28] it will be a big enhancer on the enterprise value.

[03:31] The second point is that if you have consistent e-mail sales

[03:34] that come in, that number isn't going to really cheat.

[03:37] Like tomorrow you don't go from 3.3 million to one and a half million

[03:41] e-mails on your list unless you clean the list or whatever.

[03:43] But fundamentally the list size is going to change overnight.

[03:46] Your ads might change overnight.

[03:47] But your e-mail list won't.

[03:49] So what that does is it actually can smooth out volatility

[03:52] that occurs in a business which would make it more attractive

[03:55] to an investor.

[03:56] Long-term, you'd like to have some sort of regular e-mail cadence

[04:00] because things like deliverability and domain reputation

[04:04] and things like that come into play.

[04:05] I'm not going to get into that stuff for this video.

[04:08] I'm just going to talk about big picture e-mail strategy

[04:10] that you can employ in your business now to make money.

[04:12] Great.

[04:12] Now that we have the numbers in the context, let's talk about the campaign.

[04:15] So what we did for the list is that we promoted a challenge.

[04:19] And it was a seven-day challenge.

[04:21] And the reason that I think this is interesting and important

[04:25] is that number one, this came from the marketing director.

[04:28] And I think the reason that I want to highlight this

[04:30] is that this is why you need to have smart people.

[04:32] This didn't come from me.

[04:33] This didn't come from the founder.

[04:34] The marketing director was like, hey, I think we should do a challenge.

[04:37] Now we weren't actually super on board for this because like,

[04:39] hey, this might be a distraction.

[04:40] But it turned out to be really, really good.

[04:42] And added over $100 million enterprise value to the business.

[04:45] Remember, this business is already a multi-hundred-billion dollar enterprise value business.

[04:48] And so adding 10 or 20% to the enterprise value can be a very big difference.

[04:52] The second thing is that this challenge actually came from the product.

[04:55] And so we pulled out something that was already something that we knew work

[04:59] that we were doing for customers.

[05:00] We pulled it out and we made it into a lead magnet.

[05:02] And so fundamentally, a lead magnet is a very, is a complete solution

[05:05] to a very narrow problem.

[05:07] And ideally, once you solve that problem, you create the next problem

[05:09] when you solve with your offer.

[05:10] And so fundamentally, that is what a good lead magnet does.

[05:13] And this is why challenges, I think, are very strongly

[05:16] magnets for a lot of businesses because they also satisfy all the elements of a value

[05:21] equation, which I talk about in my first book, $100 million offer,

[05:24] which is sold almost a million copies so far.

[05:27] Now, the value equation works like this.

[05:28] You've got the outcome, which is the thing that people want.

[05:31] And so as long as you have a clearly defined outcome that they want,

[05:35] then that becomes more valuable.

[05:36] Now, you multiply that by low risk or the perceived likelihood of achievement.

[05:40] How likely is it that when I buy this thing, I'm going to get this thing.

[05:44] If you have an outcome you want, and it's guaranteed to get it,

[05:47] this is going to be really valuable.

[05:48] But there's two other elements.

[05:50] The thing is, how long is it going to take?

[05:52] So if it takes a really long time, then I'll be like,

[05:55] OK, sure, I have this outcome, which is I get really rich.

[05:58] And the guarantee is that it'll definitely happen.

[06:00] But I got to wait 20 years of investing my money to become really rich.

[06:04] Well, it's not as attractive anymore.

[06:06] Right?

[06:06] Then you do ease, which is how hard is it so effort and sacrifice

[06:11] that are associated with this outcome?

[06:14] And so these are the four elements of value.

[06:15] And so a challenge is a really clear outcome that everybody wants.

[06:19] It has high likelihood of actually happening.

[06:22] It happens really fast because we attach a time to it.

[06:24] And because we're going to say, hey, we're only going to do this one thing.

[06:27] And we're going to be all the steps.

[06:28] The perception of the prospect is that it's easy, which makes these very strong lead magnets.

[06:33] If you want to go through the experience of what going through one of these challenges looks like,

[06:36] and you are somebody who wants to start a business already, having a business either way,

[06:39] you can go join the school challenge for free.

[06:41] It's 14 days.

[06:43] We walk you through everything that we have.

[06:44] I take calls in that community to help people get their first business online started.

[06:49] We have everything downstep by step.

[06:51] Once a month, I drop a full day mastermind training of all the people who are starting

[06:53] communities and making them.

[06:55] We've got it down like we're pretty good at helping people get to that first dollar.

[06:59] And so you can start for free.

[07:00] Go to school.com for it's slash games.

[07:02] And I'll see you.

[07:03] So for this particular business, it's a business that helps people achieve.

[07:06] And how come that actually takes a little bit of time?

[07:08] And so what we did was say, OK, is there a smaller mini version of this big outcome

[07:13] that we can just kind of give them a taste?

[07:14] So if I was in weight loss, I probably have them to do some sort of like seven day cleanse

[07:18] or something like that.

[07:19] Again, I'm not going to get into what's good, what's bad here.

[07:22] I'm just saying that I would have some person that gets, you know, they lose seven pounds

[07:26] in seven days.

[07:27] A lot of that's going to be water, but they're excited about it.

[07:29] They're like great.

[07:30] Now let's talk about your long-term goals, right?

[07:33] Because now they have an element of belief.

[07:34] They've taken action.

[07:35] They've gotten some reward for their behavior.

[07:37] They've interacted with us.

[07:38] All of these things align with them, making a purchase.

[07:40] What challenges do is they approximate brand?

[07:44] And so this is how actually works.

[07:46] The reason the direct response internet marketing world does a lot of these things is because

[07:50] none of them have brands.

[07:51] And so like for me, for example, if someone's already consumed a gazillion videos of mine or

[07:55] podcast mine, then if I say, hey, do you want to check this thing out?

[07:58] A lot of people are like, yeah, you've already given me a gazillion other things and so

[08:01] sure.

[08:02] But if you're brand new, then what you do is you basically have approximated relationship

[08:07] where you would have already had a lot of interactions.

[08:09] You basically try and cram a six month relationship into seven dates.

[08:13] It's kind of like one of those dating shows where they say, well, you get married in 30 days

[08:17] and they like try and cram a whole relationship into that period.

[08:20] It actually kind of is the same thing when you come from a marketing perspective.

[08:23] You're just rapidly warming up.

[08:25] You're like microwaving the prospect rather than slow cooking it, which is kind of

[08:28] the normal branding way.

[08:29] Right.

[08:30] For example, in the school games, that's our version of a challenge.

[08:33] I would just call it the school games, a cooler rapper.

[08:34] We have leader boards and prizes, something like that.

[08:37] And so we walk people through how to start a business online.

[08:40] And so we get one out of three people just under to get their first dollar within the first

[08:45] month, which is pretty cool.

[08:46] We've put a lot of time into getting that kind of outcome and then once someone makes

[08:49] a dollar, then they're like, shoot, I can see how I could make more dollars.

[08:53] And so that's the idea is like, you want to approximate, you want to do it really fast,

[08:56] you mean, it's easiest possible to make his guaranteed, is possible, and an outcome that

[08:59] they care about.

[09:00] So now that you know what the setup is, let's go back and add a couple of numbers to this

[09:03] campaign and then I'll walk you through it.

[09:06] So we sent the emails only to a small sub-segment of the list.

[09:10] So we had 464,000 people that we sent it to.

[09:14] And that was because we wanted to test it out.

[09:16] We didn't want to blow our load on the whole list.

[09:22] So we just said it's like 15% of the list.

[09:25] And the reason we did that is because like, hey, if this was a thing bond, we didn't want

[09:28] to like piss off the entire list.

[09:29] And so we sent it to 15% of the list, a lot of them were non buyers.

[09:33] And so we went from there what we saw as we had 10,000 people who registered for this

[09:39] thing, which good or bad, whatever, for us in an absolute number, 10,000 people shows a pretty

[09:45] decent amount of interest.

[09:46] So in order to get this 10,000, we had an 18% open rate, meaning just about one out of

[09:53] five people, open to the actual email.

[09:56] Okay, great.

[09:57] Now from there, we had about 5% of those people actually click to join the thing.

[10:04] And then the rest was the opt-in percentage on the page to register.

[10:07] That got us to 10,000.

[10:08] So it went from 464 to 83,000 that opened it from the 83,000, 10,000 of them actually

[10:15] registered.

[10:16] So a pretty good percentage actually who did click wanted to do it.

[10:20] And as you get into a cadence of this, which I'll explain at the end in terms of how

[10:23] to implement this on going as an email strategy to make more money,

[10:26] is that as soon as you really nail what that lead magnitude is or whatever it is that you're

[10:32] going to get your leads to engage again, or re-engage, these funnel metrics will always

[10:36] improve.

[10:37] You're going to split test.

[10:38] The subject headlines are going to split test the opening on the email address, split

[10:40] test the CTAs, and the links that you're going to use, the landing pages that you send

[10:44] them to, the offer that you attract them with, the headline of the naming of the challenge,

[10:49] which by the way is a great way to verify this up if you do it once a quarter, which I'll

[10:52] talk about later.

[10:53] Like you can do the same play, but you just put a different wrapper on it.

[10:57] So for example, in the gym, it's like came from this world.

[10:59] It's like I might have a six week challenge.

[11:03] I might have a 42 day fix.

[11:05] I might have a 42 day transformation.

[11:07] I might have a six week booty blast.

[11:09] I might have a six week slim for Santa.

[11:12] I might have a lean by Halloween.

[11:14] Like I've done a lot of these.

[11:15] Accountability, you know, challenge, like I've done a lot.

[11:19] And you know what?

[11:20] Slim for summer.

[11:21] All of these things work.

[11:22] But fundamentally, what are we going to do?

[11:23] We're going to eat.

[11:24] You're going to eat last, you're going to move more.

[11:26] And so even though the deliverable of the challenge or the lead magnet might more or less

[11:29] be the same, you can just wrap it seasonally or you can wrap it based on a specific pain

[11:34] point that happens at that time of year.

[11:36] So let me walk you through the results math, right?

[11:43] So to a clean page.

[11:44] So we attend thousand people who registered.

[11:47] I actually don't have the data on how many people attended live and watched throughout the

[11:51] whole seven days.

[11:52] I can get this, but I just I know that the high level.

[11:55] And so from 10,000, we had 800 people who actually bought.

[12:00] All right.

[12:01] So we had about 8% of people who made the purchase, which is pretty good.

[12:04] Not unhappy about that at all.

[12:06] Do I think we can improve it?

[12:07] Yes.

[12:08] But fundamentally, this was too a list of plenty of people who had in bought.

[12:10] They knew who we were.

[12:11] So I'd say it was a little bit warmer than true cold.

[12:14] But a lot of them had never bought anything from us before.

[12:16] And so that resulted.

[12:17] Remember this is a $2,000 price point in 1.6 million dollars in new sales.

[12:22] That we did just from the Cmail campaign.

[12:24] You're like, wait a second, I thought you said you did 2 million or more than 2 million.

[12:27] Let me explain what happened from there.

[12:29] So from there, we had 20% of people ascended into the AK product, which allowed us to make

[12:34] an extra 800 K from the ascensions.

[12:38] And so that gave us $2.4 million in total from this seven day email campaign.

[12:44] Now, I want to break something very cool off for you, which is that you see 2.4 million.

[12:50] Now that was derived from a list that was $464,000 emails.

[12:55] And so that means we were making roughly $6 per email in this campaign.

[13:01] And so if you know that you do this, call it 4 times a year, which I would recommend you

[13:07] do when we get into the takeaway section, meaning one time per quarter, you do a clean-up,

[13:11] we say great.

[13:12] We're going to say all the leads that we had, and we're going to run them through a conversion

[13:15] mechanism.

[13:16] In this way, it's not like, oh, shoot, I have to do this all the time.

[13:18] It's like, all right, I'm going to do this big thing.

[13:20] We do it once a quarter, and we clean up our Q1.

[13:22] We clean up our Q2.

[13:23] We clean up our Q3 by running all of our leads through this high converting funnel that

[13:28] we've structured purposely for non-bier, so we have different hooks, different front ends,

[13:31] that has different messaging that might not have been the primary message that converts

[13:35] the most people, which is our first, you know, whack at it.

[13:37] But this is our second and third whack at it.

[13:40] And by varying the titles that you use in each of the quarterly things that you do.

[13:45] So Q1, by the different name, the Q2, you'll still be able to attract people without

[13:49] necessarily fatiguing or tiring the list.

[13:51] And in between those times, you can then simply provide value to the list, and so you've

[13:55] deposited some goodwill that earns you the right to be able to ask for the sale.

[13:59] So let me walk you through the takeaways that we had from this that you can use for your

[14:03] own business to make more money.

[14:05] So there's four main takeaways that I would recommend you take from this that I take from

[14:09] this.

[14:10] Number one is smart people.

[14:12] All right, so you have to be able to trust your people to make recommendations.

[14:17] Neither the CEO nor I, so I like to say this.

[14:20] Like I also have not always in favor of ideas that make lots of money because I mess up too.

[14:25] But we were like, you know what, they're a little closer to it.

[14:27] We will trust that they're super excited about it.

[14:29] Because the flip side is if you bash every idea that your team comes to you with, then

[14:32] they're not, they're going to stop thinking about ideas.

[14:34] And then all of a sudden you're like, why does my team ever think of anything?

[14:37] It's like, well, because you turn them down every time.

[14:39] And so there's kind of like, what hills do I want to die on?

[14:42] And what times do I want to say, hey, give it a shot?

[14:44] I don't think like, is this going to do damage to the brand?

[14:46] No, I don't think so.

[14:47] We're currently not doing anything there.

[14:49] And if you're really passionate about it, sure, let's do it.

[14:51] So one, having smart people too, which is trusting them.

[14:55] All right, so I say this is still his first kind of people related for this.

[14:58] Is that you still got to trust those people and make a bet with them?

[15:01] And part of the reason I say trust them, obviously you want to trust them because they're

[15:04] competent, they're intelligent and they're well intentioned.

[15:06] But the other thing is that they sometimes just have data that you don't have because

[15:10] fundamentally in a business, there's data that's happening all over the place.

[15:13] And you are only going to get snippets as CEO, especially the bigger the company is.

[15:16] This is the business at almost 10 million a month.

[15:18] It's a very large business.

[15:19] There's lots of things going on.

[15:20] And so that person is going to be much closer to the data.

[15:23] A much closer pulse than sometimes the founder of CEO might have.

[15:27] And so sometimes they have data that you're not working with.

[15:30] And that's why extending a bridge of trust is important.

[15:33] So the second takeaway is offers to money.

[15:40] So the amount of offers that you make to any prospect is directly correlated with the

[15:45] amount of money that you'll make with the single caveat that every time you make an offer

[15:48] you lose goodwill.

[15:49] And so what you want to do is make sure that you're depositing sufficient goodwill that

[15:52] you can earn the ask.

[15:55] And so make as many as you can while also providing those which value as you can, which means

[16:01] that if you want to make a lot of offers, you just got to provide that much more value.

[16:04] Now with this particular instance, we were going to a list that we had emailed but not a lot.

[16:09] So we hadn't really emailed any offers to in a very long time.

[16:12] And so even though we weren't putting a ton of value, our give to ask ratio was still

[16:17] okay because we hadn't asked at all.

[16:20] And so I talk about the give to ask ratio in the content section of this book.

[16:24] And the reason that I actually consider email a form of content is that it's one to many

[16:28] distribution to people who know you.

[16:30] Now it's just free, which also is just like when you post on social media.

[16:35] The only difference is that you control 100% of who gets this whereas on social media,

[16:39] algorithms, things like that, distribute your content.

[16:42] But fundamentally, you're distributing one message to many people and it's free.

[16:45] And so that is what makes emails so profitable, just like organic.

[16:49] And I want to add a little caveat here, which is that it's okay to ask for the sale again.

[16:56] And so all these people are the majority of these buyers hadn't bought this thing.

[17:00] And so when we asked again, some people were afraid of making the second ask, but people

[17:04] get busy.

[17:05] You know, they leave a shopping cart up and then they, you know, they're other kid screams

[17:08] than they forget about it.

[17:09] Like it happens.

[17:11] And so you can't get too bent out of shape on the fact that like you're going to offend

[17:16] people by asking them.

[17:17] It's okay to ask as long as you've earned the right and you've given until you've deposited

[17:21] enough goodwill that there's enough demand there's surge there that you can let loose the

[17:25] valve of money and it can come on and then you can close it again.

[17:29] So the third takeaway is that you can sell the same thing in a different way.

[17:33] And so I can sell a product on a webinar.

[17:38] I could sell it on a phone.

[17:39] I could sell it via a live workshop in person.

[17:42] I could sell it via email.

[17:44] And so you can have less off of fatigue by selling the same offer in a different medium.

[17:50] And so you can get more hacks or more at bets because people will judge their goodwill

[17:56] with you based on the medium that you're communicating in.

[17:59] And so this is something that I have found.

[18:01] And also, by the way, is a great way to very products up.

[18:04] And so for example, if you're an educator, I'll just use this because it's simple.

[18:08] If I have content on the internet, that's free.

[18:11] If I make a course, you could charge for or you could make it free.

[18:14] If I deliver that same course in a book format, it's not going to be able to sell for the

[18:18] same amount that a course could.

[18:19] If I deliver that same format in a live-in person experience, that's going to be probably

[18:24] charged significantly more than it would in a digital format.

[18:27] By today, live format, but virtual, it would be a different price point than the live-in

[18:31] person.

[18:32] And so for each of these mediums, even if the same information is being taught, you price

[18:37] it differently.

[18:38] Same reason that when you go in person in college, they charge you a arm and a leg

[18:41] for it.

[18:42] But digital college, almost ubiquitously, is way, way, way lower price, even though it's

[18:47] the same information.

[18:48] It's simply being delivered through a different medium.

[18:51] And so you can sell in different mediums and deliver in different mediums and for my

[18:55] experience, people will apprise or judge the decision based on that medium exclusively.

[19:01] So the fourth takeaway is I'll just call the quarterly cleanup.

[19:05] So this is probably the most tactical recommendation that I can give you that I alluded

[19:09] to a little bit earlier, which is I would recommend that you do this once every quarter.

[19:14] You do this conversion mechanism, whether you do some sort of challenge or some sort of

[19:17] defined outcome or some sort of lead-meagged that you used to re-engage your list and put

[19:22] them through some sort of conversion event with a deadline with a big promise that you

[19:26] know you can deliver on.

[19:27] And so if you do this once a quarter and you weren't doing this, you could almost immediately

[19:31] add, like you saw the numbers there.

[19:33] We had $6 per email from that 450,000 sub-segment.

[19:38] Now to prove that this worked, what we did was we just did it again, by the way, one of my

[19:43] favorite bit of strategies.

[19:44] Do something that works, do it again, do more of it, and ideally do it better.

[19:48] So we ran the exact same play again to a different sub-segment of the list and boom,

[19:52] we hit 2.2 million.

[19:53] We didn't have a way to quarter, we just did it the next month.

[19:56] And so I say this because this stuff works and once you know it works, you can keep duplicating

[20:01] it over and over again.

[20:02] And guess what we're going to do next quarter now that we know that we tested it on two

[20:05] sub-segments.

[20:06] We're going to do it to the whole list and we're going to use the learnings that we

[20:09] had from the first two tests.

[20:10] And so if you are going to run this as the quarterly cleanup, I would recommend using 10%

[20:15] of your list or a smaller percentage because believe me, as soon as you learn the things that

[20:18] you messed up on the first try, you're going to be really grateful that you didn't

[20:21] run it to the entire list.

[20:22] So do one, two or three test runs before you blow the whole list up with this new promo

[20:30] that you've already tested the messaging, the subject head, the CTAs, the landing page,

[20:34] those little tests that you can run in the meantime that can sometimes double or triple

[20:38] the throughput of the campaign.

[20:40] And so with every one of these campaigns, I would recommend always testing some elements

[20:44] of it so you can always make it a little bit better.

[20:46] And so one, you're doing this every quarter, two, you can test it with a small portion

[20:51] of the list.

[20:52] Three is that in order to make it seem an appear different to the non-buyer who doesn't

[20:57] buy on the first hack or the second hack, we change the naming of it or the wrapper of

[21:01] it.

[21:02] So change the landing page, change the subject head of the email, change the name of the challenge

[21:05] of the lead magnet, even if the core components are the same.

[21:08] Finally, your businesses are going to change, right?

[21:11] But the way that you position it or the reason why that you have the promotion can.

[21:15] And I recommend doing something that seasonal or doing something that's a life event for

[21:18] you.

[21:19] I talk about this in the last chapter of the offers book, which this is especially important

[21:23] for local businesses because you have much smaller audiences.

[21:25] And so fatigue happens much faster with a tiny audience.

[21:28] And so you actually have to have a lot more variety.

[21:30] And I know this because that was the world I came from.

[21:32] And so that's why I have all these, these isms in the back of my mind of how I had to

[21:35] wrap and re-rap the same thing, which is fun.

[21:37] I'm like, fitness and nutrition.

[21:38] But like how many ways can I slice it?

[21:41] Turns out a lot.

[21:42] I will say that once you have one annual calendar, you can pretty much stick with it.

[21:46] So you don't need to come up with another thing next year.

[21:48] Once you have your four big promos that you're going to run throughout the year that you

[21:51] know are tested, those just become autopilot and they just be have cash printers.

[21:55] And if this time of case study deep breakdowns on business interesting to you,

[21:59] I have another one where I doubled one of our portfolio companies in 60 days.

[22:01] Check that one out.

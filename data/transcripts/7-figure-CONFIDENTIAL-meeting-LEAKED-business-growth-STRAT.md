[00:00] If you are thinking of what to do next in your business and your stock and you've been

[00:04] plateauing at the same space, I was asked to speak to a group of seven figure entrepreneurs.

[00:09] One of the questions that I was asked was how to get on-site in the situation.

[00:12] It's a multi-location owner who's trying to scale and license or franchise their business.

[00:17] And the answer to the gave him is probably not what you would expect.

[00:21] And maybe the reason that you are stock or not advancing at the speed with which you would like.

[00:26] All right, and so if you don't know how I'm my name is Oxmozi, I would actquisition.com.

[00:29] It's a portfolio of companies that is about $85 million a year.

[00:32] And so if you are new to Mozi Nation, welcome and enjoy the video.

[00:35] I'll see you in the other side.

[00:37] Joy, what are the different anxious strategies recommend?

[00:39] I think I covered it with Ano.

[00:41] I think that for most people if you were trying to exit the gym,

[00:43] I would be looking at customer or employee.

[00:46] And then right now, and this is purpose because right now,

[00:49] SBA loans are just a joke to get in like zero interest.

[00:52] So I think that those would be, and you can put a percentage of seller financing in there to get

[00:57] a number that you feel comfortable with.

[00:58] And it also doesn't put too much cash drag on the business.

[01:01] There could be pretty attractive for both sides.

[01:04] Yeah, so kind of to clarify on the question, I guess that I was wondering,

[01:09] so we've looked at licensing or franchising or we want to just grow as a company.

[01:16] And then just eventually sell it or what.

[01:19] And so we haven't come with the clear strategy.

[01:22] We thought we wanted to do like a franchise route until I started to investigate and realize

[01:26] that it was going to be a huge headache.

[01:30] But I guess kind of what are your thoughts on, you know, in the gym industry,

[01:34] if you, what are the different avenues you can take to exit the company and

[01:40] I mean, either keep it or sell it.

[01:42] I mean, locations you have right now.

[01:43] Yeah.

[01:45] Three working on a fourth.

[01:46] Are they all different markets like different states?

[01:48] Are they constantly on market on central California?

[01:51] So we're not, we haven't even entered into like a metropolitan area.

[01:56] I don't know if you guys are familiar with Fresno, California.

[01:59] That's probably the first city, go to a quilt that we go into.

[02:04] We're technically considered like towns.

[02:06] Okay, facilities that we're in.

[02:07] Do you want to stay in the fitness industry?

[02:12] Yeah, I mean, I've been doing it for 14 years now and I can't really.

[02:15] Your question, that was not, it's not loaded.

[02:17] That's they like kind of top level question.

[02:20] So if you want to stay in the fitness industry, how do I best package the skills that I have right now

[02:25] for making money?

[02:26] I have a very important question.

[02:28] How much money do the locations make?

[02:32] This year, each location will we profit it with a little over 100,000?

[02:38] Perk?

[02:39] No, that was total between the three.

[02:41] But this year we spent quite a bit of money, better bunch of stuff we're going through

[02:46] without getting to into it to.

[02:49] So we have probably roughly $50,000 of expenses that we had that we won't next year.

[02:56] The first thing I'm thinking is if you've proven out the multiple locations and they're like,

[03:00] as profitable as they can be before you scale further, that's what I would be thinking just

[03:05] from where I sit, just knowing them out of people that I know who have multiple locations,

[03:10] grow to like, say double digit multiple, and then they go licensing or franchise,

[03:14] the most important piece, and this is where everyone fails, is they're just not profitable.

[03:19] Do they're not the unenconomic suck, you know what I mean?

[03:23] Like, I'm going to do the, I'm going to do the Dave Dunham for a punch.

[03:27] Even if you do the ad back for the 50K that's the one time expense, if you're doing 50,000 net

[03:32] professility, no one's interested in that.

[03:34] It might be like the nasty medicine, but it'll actually solve the pain, right?

[03:38] I solved the problem. So if you've got three locations, the fact that you said we're thinking

[03:41] about a fourth, I'm like, why on God's greener, are you thinking about a fourth location when we're

[03:45] profiting 30,000 dollars per year for a location? Like that, we're like, this shouldn't even be

[03:48] discussion. And the fact that we went from one to three with what I would consider poor profit metrics,

[03:55] I wouldn't have advised that either, but we're in that boat and that's fine, right? We're,

[03:58] the here we are. I would bet you dollars to donuts that if you got rid of two of them and then

[04:02] folks your attention on one, you would make more money than you have from the three. Just straight up.

[04:07] And I think you need to fix them off. Like for the mob, because like, do you know how many,

[04:12] like, and I'm going to be mean with this and it's not directed to you, but it's more directed

[04:15] to the industry. Do you know how many mom and pop bullshit licensing and franchises? There are

[04:20] of three to five location owners. They fucking zillion of them. And you know how many franchises

[04:26] never get above 30 locations because once they open, they do the unit economics that we're talking

[04:31] about right now, most of them. And that's why most of them don't grow or grow anywhere.

[04:37] The guy who started it feels good because he tells his family and friends that he's a franchise,

[04:41] and then everyone's like, oh, wow, but they're broke and they don't know anything. And so why would

[04:46] you care about impressing them? And so if the goal is to make the most money, it feels like you're in a rush.

[04:54] To the feels like to me hearing what you just said. And so I would lean towards, and like I said,

[05:00] this is going to be like the sour medicine. If you really want to do this, you got to do it right,

[05:06] and you got to fix the model. And the locations that you have have to be corporate, they got to be

[05:11] the best fucking gems out there for somebody even considering buying into this, either from a licensing

[05:16] perspective or from a franchising perspective. Like these guys should be running on 30 percent

[05:21] plus margins with, and if you're doing, you know, is it a large group of longer? Right now we're

[05:27] just doing larger. So we have even introduced the small group in yet. We're working on, you know,

[05:34] our 90 day and all that stuff from the front end. Yeah, make sure that you're in a smaller market,

[05:39] which believe it or not means you should be running on higher margins, not lower margins.

[05:44] Because in the small markets you're costs are low, and there's also this competition. The disadvantage

[05:48] of small markets is that leads are great in the beginning and then they suck. That's kind of the

[05:54] trade off. And so, and if anything, your word of mouth and your retention has to be more important

[06:00] in a small, in a small town than anything. If you like, for example, if you said, we've got the

[06:05] small town modeled down. It's like, I wouldn't even go to Fresno. I'd be looking at what other small towns

[06:09] are there because we have that modeled down. You go to Fresno, you're competing it's everyone.

[06:13] You know what I mean? And the guys that you're competing against, they're pulling out 250,

[06:16] 400 a year because their locations are rocking. So I think that I think it's a big look in words

[06:22] of like, have I wanted to open more locations so that I could say it on more locations?

[06:26] And is my goal status or is my goal money? It's important that you don't have an answer now.

[06:30] But like it's an important question. If the goal is money, then I would look a hard look at the

[06:34] other two locations and think about, is there one of these that I can combine into one? I can take the

[06:38] EFT, throw them to the other one. People lose half of it, but I get all of it on the same fixed overhead.

[06:43] Make more money at that second location. And then look at that, you know, when my lease ends at the

[06:47] other one. So I can focus my attention on making this gym as wildly profitable as humanly

[06:51] possible. And then until this gym is growing without me with a team that's incentivized,

[06:57] now I have an asset on the balance sheet. If you have an asset on your person that worth balance sheet,

[07:01] that can then be leveraged in a number of different ways. You can sell the thing, you can sell the

[07:04] license the thing, you can do the franchise because now you have an actual unit itself that generates profit

[07:11] in a with a high return on capital, which is what someone's going to look at. From a franchise

[07:15] perspective, a licensing perspective, or from if you crush it, you could own them all.

[07:21] The guy who lives above me in Vegas, I think I've told you guys, he owns Panda Express.

[07:27] He owns a mom, isn't franchise shit. He did he did 3.8 billion last year.

[07:32] 26% margins got 26%. He took 935 million home in income. That was this income. When we asked,

[07:40] what was the secret to success? He said, do the same thing for 45 years. You get a really

[07:45] fucking good at making our extra game. I'm being real with you. If it took you 5 years,

[07:51] but then you had the best damn gym model out there, and then 5 years after that,

[07:56] you had 30 locations with that being out because life's long mid. It feels like rush. That's when

[08:03] I feel right now. It feels like there's a rush. I think it's just that we have a lot of people who

[08:09] were members in the past and moved to Fresno and we think it'd be an easy entry to the market.

[08:15] We feel like that's the easiest way to make a 30-year-old. You're going to put your attention there

[08:22] and then you'll go flat. Then all of a sudden you have four locations to make no profit.

[08:28] When you had one facility, just one way back, how much were you making in profit?

[08:37] You make less money now and you got more locations. We had time we were able to

[08:44] there were three owners and all three of us worked there and we had the small group and we had

[08:48] the personal training and in a way we had created the system that you guys have now, but unintentionally

[08:54] and we just didn't even realize it. Now that we see it, we're like oh shit, that's why we made so much

[08:59] money. We're getting back to a route to try and figure out how to implement it on a larger scale now.

[09:07] So that way, once we do make it really profitable again, then we have everything ready to roll for the next

[09:13] I would say one just final piece on this is just make it super profitable because of

[09:18] pride you have and doing a good job. Not so that you can do x-y and z because then it makes x-y and

[09:25] z the goal rather than the work. If you make your intention to build the best fucking gym out there,

[09:31] not so that you can, but just because it is what you take pride in, you'll have what you want,

[09:37] but it takes a big shift. I could just, you know, if you'd ask me the franchise question originally,

[09:41] like I could just say like yeah man, like it's fine. You got three out of fourth location and then

[09:46] you know, talk to this guy and he'll sit down with franchise and but he wouldn't be successful.

[09:49] Now with respect to the you have right now not with the you and the economics. And I know this is

[09:53] probably not, you know, I just found on a group call, but I'm just being real with you. Like if you really

[09:57] want to do this and you really want to do this, fix the gym. Hardcore. My feelings don't

[10:03] get hurt man. I appreciate it. I said it with love. It's absolutely desired for you in fucking

[10:09] crush it. Action steps. Take a hard look at the other two locations. I'd consider consolidating

[10:14] one if you can. Look at one of the other leases are up and then go back to making $40,000 a month

[10:19] and then slowly slowly it might take a year. It might take two years for you to get to that

[10:26] to keep $40,000 a month without you being at all. Once you do that, then you can have the discussion

[10:34] of whatever else you wanted to. And if that sounds like man that's going to take time,

[10:37] first point I said, you're in a rush. Appreciate mutual. Thanks for, thanks for speaking

[10:42] up.

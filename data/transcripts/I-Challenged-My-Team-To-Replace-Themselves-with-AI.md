[00:00] I told my entire team to replace themselves with AI in a week.

[00:03] Here's the nine AI tools they came back with across sales, marketing, HR training, recruiting

[00:08] and operations.

[00:09] Let's start with sales.

[00:10] Our deal team walks to 100 prospective businesses every single month.

[00:13] Now they've implemented two AI tools to replace themselves.

[00:16] First, to increase shop rates for meetings, we now send personalized videos of me using

[00:21] entirely AI.

[00:22] Hey Jordan, pay Josh, pay Kevin, pay Michael, Nathan Ryan, you passed our initial screen

[00:27] congratulations, his off.

[00:29] So this saved them all the time in Miss calls and all the time I would have to spend

[00:32] manually saying, hey, Johnny, hey, Dave, I never said any names.

[00:36] Now to do that, they asked me to record one video.

[00:39] Just one, the AI would cut in and replace my mouth and move it in the right way to say

[00:44] a name that I never spoke.

[00:46] Now on top of that, the deal team does a lot of emailing.

[00:47] So they wanted to have a more effective way to write email files, which normally can take

[00:50] 10 to 20 minutes, a pop, two hours plus per day.

[00:53] And so they use Composed.AI.

[00:55] So here's an example of what that looks like right after call in action.

[00:59] Now if you think about the breakdown of how much they were placed, two hours per day on

[01:02] a 40 hour work week needs 25% more output for the same cost.

[01:05] That's when for me, it's when for them because value is created.

[01:08] Next, my content team came to me and how they were going to replace themselves.

[01:12] They used three different tools to get 250 pieces of content out per week.

[01:16] First off, they wanted to give everybody in most of the nation more ways to consume

[01:19] my stuff.

[01:20] So they added audio versions of any email or any tweet that I post that I never actually

[01:25] read.

[01:26] These are actually just me tweeting all day.

[01:28] I don't write my tweets for me.

[01:29] You could actually use the same voice over tool, which was resemble AI to send voice

[01:34] memos to prospects, create entirely custom text and then send it as a voice member that

[01:39] you can record in real time.

[01:40] It's freakishly like me and it was only with about 10 minutes of training.

[01:44] 90% of them come while I drink coffee in the morning and between sets when I work out.

[01:48] And to give you a quick look into the future, podcast at AI actually scraped all of Joe

[01:53] Rogan's podcast to get his voice down.

[01:56] And this is a clip from the intro of one of their podcast entirely generated by AI.

[02:01] Another episode of the bro joke and experience.

[02:04] On this episode, I welcome my friend who's difficult to describe.

[02:07] How's it going?

[02:08] Good to see you buddy.

[02:09] It's been a long time since I've been on the show.

[02:11] So in the future, audio books may just be recorded entirely through AI because the

[02:15] authors voice can be duplicated and they don't have to spend three days recording the book.

[02:19] Or every blog post will have an audio version that everyone can listen to.

[02:23] And the best part is for me is that the team doesn't have to kind of disrupt my day.

[02:26] Hey, can you record this thing for it only take 30 seconds.

[02:28] That 30 second disruption might take 30 minutes from me to get back on track.

[02:32] The second tool that they used to replace themselves is something called Runway.AI.

[02:35] This is for image editing and some other stuff too, but we're using it mostly for images right

[02:39] now.

[02:40] So what used to take 30 minutes to edit out an object or replace my shirt or change the color

[02:44] of my hat, we can now do in seconds.

[02:46] On the flip side, you can also edit out an entire figure, put whatever background

[02:49] they want behind it.

[02:50] On top of that, if you've ever needed to remove background sound, you've ever

[02:53] ever wanted to say, where was this massive fan in the background?

[02:56] In a few clicks, you can remove all of the background sound of an audio for any kind

[03:01] of video and they can do it in seconds.

[03:03] The third tool they used was to script.

[03:05] Alright, this is pretty slick for a couple reasons.

[03:07] Number one is for editing, it can get straight to the point of his video where I say specific

[03:11] thing.

[03:12] So if you've ever been like man, I know there's this point in this video that recorded

[03:14] that's 38 minutes long.

[03:15] Rather than mindlessly clicking play and trying to speed it up and trying to pay attention

[03:19] while also trying not to do his off.

[03:20] Instead of all that, it transcribes the entire video and you can just pick the part where

[03:24] you say the thing and it goes straight to it.

[03:25] So rather than trying to find it through video watching, you can find it straight in the

[03:29] text.

[03:30] If they don't have to spend two hours today looking for different clips, sifting through

[03:33] it like pause, rewind, pause, rewind, then they can spend the rest of that time thinking

[03:37] about how they want to package the video.

[03:39] What's sound or what music they want to use to evoke an emotion?

[03:42] And that is going to take a video for up 100,000 views to a million views.

[03:45] Eventually, I was going to be able to do that too.

[03:47] Let's switch gears to training.

[03:48] One of the most expensive things for any new companies that they have to onboard new

[03:51] people.

[03:52] After you've already gone through the process of interviewing tons of candidates and taking

[03:54] them through first round, second round, third round interviews, now you've given them

[03:56] the job they're in.

[03:57] They're still useless because they don't know how your company works.

[04:00] They don't know your values.

[04:01] They don't know the cadence.

[04:02] They don't know the communication structure.

[04:03] They don't know meeting all these things.

[04:04] They've to repeat over and over and over again.

[04:05] And it's time to make my director people came to me and say, hey, we can actually create all

[04:10] the onboarding videos using AI.

[04:12] Thanks for applying with acquisition.com.

[04:14] My name is Jessica.

[04:15] I am an AI generated member of the acquisition.com team.

[04:19] What's cool about this is you can have a living document that you update as things

[04:22] change.

[04:23] So instead of going to a studio, setting everything up and then reshooting an entirely new

[04:25] video, you just change the text and boom.

[04:28] Make sure to click that like button.

[04:30] The video changes instantly.

[04:31] If it's not perfect, I wouldn't worry about it because it will be soon.

[04:34] If you speed up AI videos, I've noticed that it sounds a lot more human.

[04:36] Make sure to click that like button.

[04:37] All trainings can be just done straight through text and then the avatar can deliver them.

[04:41] This is hundreds of hours of human labor that is just getting eliminated.

[04:46] So there are two things that increase productivity per worker.

[04:49] One is education and the other one is technology.

[04:52] When you have AI based education, you're actually using both.

[04:55] The person who was doing the training is now using technology to save the time.

[04:59] The person who's receiving the training is now becoming educated and as a result becoming

[05:03] more productive.

[05:04] Now let's shift gears over to recruiting.

[05:05] Our recruiters recruit top talent for our portfolio companies.

[05:08] Check out how our recruiters are using tabis to create more personalized outreach.

[05:12] I was talking with Alex Ramozi and they said you should toileticottacquisition.com.

[05:16] If you only go through using job boards to get your talent, then you're only getting

[05:20] people who are dissatisfied and want to leave.

[05:22] But the highest producing people are always employed.

[05:25] And so if you want to have personalized outreach to get the best talent, consider using

[05:28] stuff like this.

[05:29] Then they hop on a candidate interview.

[05:30] After every candidate interview, you take notes on the candidate.

[05:33] And that serves two purposes.

[05:34] One is if the person isn't a good fit, you send them notes about why they're not a good

[05:37] fit and you wish them the best.

[05:38] On the flip side, if they are a good fit, you want to take those notes and pass them

[05:42] onto the next person's day of more context.

[05:43] On our AI, solve that by taking notes on these interviews and timestamps.

[05:47] This saves our recruiters 10 to 15 minutes per call per day.

[05:51] If you can now get more productive interviews, then it means you can get more productive

[05:54] people into your business and then the savings on that are probably incalculable.

[05:58] Now let's shift to my operations team.

[06:00] So our admin for internal meetings began using AI to attend meetings and take notes on

[06:05] her behalf.

[06:06] Instead of having to sit on a meeting after meeting after meeting to take notes, they

[06:09] could report back to the executives.

[06:10] Fireflies AI will take meetings and they can just look at the meeting notes in probably

[06:14] at 10th of the time compared to sitting in any of those meetings.

[06:17] And then they can consolidate them.

[06:18] They use chatGPT for that and they can send it to it.

[06:21] You can now have visibility into your entire organization in a way that you couldn't ever

[06:25] before.

[06:26] Now let's talk about the most expensive resource in every company.

[06:28] Time.

[06:29] And the number and time waste of time, those awkward like 30, 15 minutes, 45 minute

[06:33] white space between meetings.

[06:34] And it's not enough time to do any deep work.

[06:36] So you just basically sit there and waste your time waiting for the next thing to start.

[06:40] That doesn't have to happen anymore.

[06:41] So what our ops team did was get the entire team under Reclaim AI.

[06:44] To resheuffle calendars in real time to maximize output of an entire company by wait for

[06:50] it 40%.

[06:52] Rather than have thousands of emails every single day, simply trying to coordinate times,

[06:56] it can do that by seeing everyone's transparently and then making it so that there are

[07:00] as few blank spaces as possible on everyone's calendars.

[07:03] And the biggest project that we're using robots and AI for it, Aquisers.com is building

[07:08] our new Polkohedcours.

[07:10] We figure if we use robots, we can have them work around the clock, not need to take time

[07:14] off, not have sexual harassment in some places, and we have no fear of them getting injured.

[07:17] Okay, that one was a joke, but in the not too far future it won't be.

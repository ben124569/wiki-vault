[00:00] You're not making as much money as you want to make because you're not getting as many leads as you need to have to sell stuff too.

[00:05] And you're probably not getting as many leads as you need because you're not giving away enough free stuff.

[00:10] This is a sneak preview of my $100,000 leads book,

[00:14] just a snippet from just one chapter and at the end I'm going to give you a 7.7 checklist that you can use to immediately

[00:19] deploy this in your business so you can get more leads and also make more money for life.

[00:23] The reason people buy is based on a prediction of future value.

[00:26] So they buy because they predict that they will get value from you later.

[00:30] What is the easiest way to get someone to predict they're going to get value from you after you buy?

[00:34] By giving them value before they buy.

[00:36] There's two ways that you can fundamentally get leads.

[00:38] You can one, just make your offer to somebody to say, hey, I will wash your car for $100.

[00:43] Now you can put lots of Asyl Dazzle around it.

[00:45] That is a offer. Products or services that you exchange money for and the terms under which you do that exchange.

[00:50] And so this is directly from my first book, I really don't offer his or her and it's fun y'all.

[00:56] Sorry. A core offer versus a league man.

[00:58] What's the difference? Right? Because fundamentally you'll have something that's valuable in both of these instances.

[01:02] The core offer is the thing you sell that makes you the most money.

[01:05] You're like, which one is it? The one that makes you the most money? That's your core offer.

[01:09] If all of a sudden you start making one money on your lead magnet, guess what? That's actually your core offer.

[01:12] Lead magnet is the thing before the thing. Lead magnet is not a partial solution.

[01:17] Alright, what a lot of people try and do is like, hey, I'm going to give you the first six minutes of this 12 minute video and you get the rest.

[01:23] I think that's that's not the right way to do it. I think you lose trust and that's literally opposite of the objective of lead magnet.

[01:27] A lead magnet is a complete solution to a narrow lead or find problem.

[01:32] If you're going to do anything for a customer, there are many micro steps that happen create a bigger solution.

[01:38] Let's say a pain house. There's a lot of micro steps that have to happen in order for a house to get painted.

[01:42] First, you've got a size up the house. Then you have to give an estimate of whatever. Then you have to do the design component.

[01:48] You have to do the 3D visualization. The bigger the thing is the more steps there are. The idea is, okay, can I pick one of these very painful steps for my prospect

[01:55] and solve it for them at a massive discount? To attract more people to want to do it with me.

[02:00] I do such a good job at this massive discount that I increase the trust they have with me and now they have one foot in the door.

[02:05] We're not giving away partially done work. We're giving complete work to a narrowly defined problem.

[02:12] That once completed opens up the next problem. For example, you do massage.

[02:18] You're like, I can't get enough massage clients. Well, it's usually because you're not giving enough free stuff away.

[02:23] Because fundamentally, if you give something away for free, you almost always have demand for it.

[02:27] And if it's good, you'll have exponential demand for it. If I give away a $10 massage to get people to come in

[02:34] and then later everyone buys packages of massage just for a minute or buys a massage subscription for me.

[02:39] The massage subscription or the massage packages are my core offer.

[02:43] And the lead magnet would be the trial offer of the $10 or discounted massage.

[02:48] The reason people do those discounted massage is they give those trials.

[02:52] They give those mini offers, the lead magnets on the front end is because they make more money.

[02:57] Because if I go to a hundred people and say, hey, let me give you massage for a hundred bucks.

[03:01] A lot of people might say, no, maybe one person would say us. Now if I then said to the same owner people,

[03:06] I want to give you a massage for $10. I might get 20 people to say us.

[03:10] And then of those 20 get a third of them to buy the hundred thing after they tried my massage.

[03:16] And so you've got one person getting massage for a hundred dollars versus six people getting massage,

[03:21] 30% of the 20 after giving them that first trial. And so my cost to acquire them is the cost of

[03:26] delivering the lead magnet. So if it costs me $10 in cost to give the massage that I break even on my lead magnet.

[03:32] If it actually costs me 20, I might lose 10 bucks. But in my willing to lose 10 bucks on 20 people.

[03:38] So I pay $200 to get six customers that convert and are worth $2,000.

[03:44] Probably. Even if you're lead man, it costs you money to deliver. It should still lower your total

[03:49] cost to get a new customer. That's the secret. That's the sauce of lead magnets and why they also

[03:54] make businesses more money. And why big business owners think long term about I'm willing to give more

[03:58] upfront because I know I'll make more in the end. You might be wondering why I just got a football.

[04:01] It's because I'll be hosting the Super Bowl of Entrepreneurship on Saturday, August 19th,

[04:07] where I'll be releasing my new book $100,000 lead the second book in the series after its big brother,

[04:12] $100,000 offers. Just 15,000, 5 stars on Amazon sold at $400,000 copies off word of mouth

[04:16] below. And the only reason I'm making an ad is because I talk about ads in the book and I want to

[04:20] prove that I don't have to do it. If that sounds it all interesting and you want to be there,

[04:22] which you would, why would you not want to go to the Super Bowl. Click the link. I'll see there.

[04:26] A lot of people get really afraid of giving away free stuff because they're like, if I give away

[04:28] all this value, then what I do? It's like give more value. And if you don't know how to give

[04:33] two types of value, then get good enough to be able to give value on the front end before someone buys.

[04:38] So they give value on the back end. One of the beautiful things about business in life is that

[04:41] when you solve problems, you create more problems. If you're broke, being broke sucks.

[04:46] When you have money, tax is also suck. Now you may prefer those problems, but they are

[04:50] problems nonetheless. What we want to do is always know what the journey of the customer is going

[04:54] to be ahead of them. And we should because we're the ones who've done this 100 times. And so we

[04:58] should know what next problem is going to come up. And if we put our thinking caps on, we say,

[05:01] hey, well, if there's six steps to this problem, why don't I solve the first two? And then they're

[05:05] going to encounter problem three. And then I make that my paid thing. Now, I completely solve

[05:10] problem one and problem two, but it naturally leads us off to problem three, which I can then charge for.

[05:15] So for example, if you're trying to lose weight, there's a lot of steps that have to occur.

[05:19] And the way that I like to think about this is before during after for everything that has to happen

[05:23] for a customer. So a customer wants to lose weight. Then they're going to probably have to eat better,

[05:27] work out better. And the problem needs some sort of help along the way in terms of accountability

[05:30] to keep them on. Right? Eat better. But what does that mean? Well, they're going to have to buy

[05:34] their groceries differently, prepare the food, eat the food. The food's going to have to taste good.

[05:39] They're going to have to get the right macros. They're like, oh, wow, there's like a lot of little things

[05:43] here. Can I say, hey, how can I make grocery shopping easier? Here's a list. Here's a preloaded

[05:48] Instacart, grocery list for women who are at this weight, women who are at this weight, women who are

[05:52] at this weight, men who are at this weight with this goal, right? And you're like, wait, that's a lot of

[05:56] stuff there. So it's like, yeah, but it's one time work that you can set up for a hundred different

[06:00] types of people. And then they have their grocery list for you. Now that's just problem one.

[06:04] What if after that, what's the next problem they're going to have? Well, they're going to bring it back.

[06:07] Then, really, what do I do with all this shit? How to clean and prep all of the food that you just bought

[06:11] in under 60 minutes? And I'm going to solve it for them. Then what am I going to do? Well, how to store

[06:15] it and portion it in a way that you can bring it with you. So you don't get that weird jelly

[06:18] in the bottom of your chicken breast, Tupperware, which is nasty as hell. So they pump in there by the way.

[06:23] It's increased the weight. If you solve them very well, people are like, oh, shit, but I also need this and

[06:27] you're like, aha. Well, I want me to tell you about that since you got a such a good experience with

[06:31] this one. And because I had value, I will have a prediction of future value because you provided me

[06:36] value before I go. Now, one thing that a lot of people are afraid of giving away is stuff that

[06:40] actually cost them money. But I can assure you that if it actually costs you money, it usually will be

[06:45] valued at a significantly higher percentage to the marketplace. So sure, you can have a free PDF.

[06:50] Sure, you can have a digital video series, whatever it is. But normally, unless it's exceptional,

[06:55] people aren't going to value that because that's what a lot of people do. Sometimes giving away

[06:58] actual free work that you will incur cost on a lot more people will take you up on. And if you do the

[07:03] math, you will ultimately make more money. And this, what I'm talking about is the difference between

[07:06] small business owners and big business owners. They can incur calculated cost upfront for a much bigger

[07:10] back end. Your free stuff should be better than their paid stuff. Everyone makes that cool, but they

[07:14] don't actually do that. What your competition actually builds as their core offer and you do such

[07:18] a good job of it, that you can give it away for free, then you become unstoppable. And if you're like,

[07:22] wow, that takes work. Uh, also, so does becoming a multi-millionaire. So, did you think it would be easy?

[07:28] Let's round this out with seven quick steps that I think through when I'm actually trying to

[07:32] create lead magnets for any business that we have. Step number one, figure out the problem you

[07:35] want to solve and who you want to solve it for. If you know who you're trying to solve it for,

[07:39] you will name it differently. You will approach the problem differently. You'll market a

[07:42] different link. You'll package differently. And ultimately, you'll deliver it differently. If you're

[07:45] very clear on who and what number two is figure out how you want to solve it. So, inside the book

[07:50] I talk about three different ways that you can solve an actual problem for a lead magnet. So one

[07:55] is be like, if I give a free assessment of any kind, I'm revealing a problem to somebody. A different

[07:58] way would be giving a trial of something. They are usually more problem aware. They know their

[08:02] back hurts. And so I just need to solve it for them. But, unless they keep paying me, it'll come back.

[08:07] And there's other versions that you can combine them much I talk about more in the book. You figure

[08:10] out how you want to solve it. The third step is figuring out how you want to deliver it. There's lots of

[08:14] different delivery mechanisms. Do I want to do it with information? Do I want to do it with a service?

[08:18] Do I want to do the physical product that I'm sending them? The demonstrates it? All of these are

[08:22] different ways to deliver on that one promise. And the question is, which of these are going to be

[08:25] perceived as the highest value from the prospect? And, increase the likelihood that they ultimately

[08:30] buy from you the most. That would mean that you get the most amount of people interested and the

[08:33] most amount of people taking the next step. Then it's like, okay, well, how am I going to package this

[08:36] thing? The first thing that someone's going to see in order to make the decision to consume your lead

[08:42] magnet is how you package it. So for example, this book, I had the title that I tested. I had the

[08:47] sub headline that I tested and I tested the image that I was going to put on the cover itself. Well,

[08:51] the first test I ran was $100 advertising versus $100 dollar promotions and advertising $169

[08:57] percent of 31. I was like, huh, so then I ran advertising against $100 leads. Leads one, 58 to 42.

[09:04] And I was like, huh, then the next round, I said, okay, $100 leads or $100 marketing and leads one again.

[09:10] And so I was like, all right, Leads is going to be the headline of the book. A couple of different

[09:13] images that I ran and then I ran different versions of the image. That was the one that ultimately won.

[09:17] And so there's a story of a book that went out on dating and it taped and they went back and they

[09:23] changed the cover of the book and the headline. Nothing else inside the book and then it went on

[09:27] to sell over 10 million copies just by renaming the book. As you can put all this time into

[09:32] living an amazing solution. And so if there's ever a most important step, it's this one, which is

[09:36] how you name it and how you package it. So step five is making it fast and easy to consume. People

[09:41] learn in different ways. Have an audio version, have a written version, hardback version they

[09:45] can hold their hands, have the digital reader version, have the video version. On my last book,

[09:49] 100 million offers, which now is, I think, 350,000 copies sold. So I have a decent data set.

[09:53] It's almost a perfect quarter, quarter, quarter, quarter split in terms of where people consume it.

[09:59] It's so much effort to write the book and so little effort to just double and triple and quadriple

[10:04] how many more people could sue me. Simply by making it available in more ways to more people in

[10:09] more places. Six is you have to make it fucking good. The reason I say that is because so many people

[10:13] give away sucky fluff in their lead magnets and their free shit and I use shit as the emphasis

[10:18] there because they're afraid or unable to give away more value. If you're afraid of giving away

[10:23] more value, consider the alternative. You give away sucky fluff. 99% of the marketplace only

[10:27] consumes your sucky fluff and it makes a decision of how much value you're going to give to them

[10:30] in the future and they're going to say, oh, he gave me sucky fluff. Why would I ever work with him?

[10:34] And then, here's the shitty part. They then, other people are like, hey, do you know Jason so

[10:38] and so? And you're like, oh yeah, I could tip one of his things. It was shit. And so what happens is not only

[10:42] to this person not by, they actually get other people to not buy your stuff who otherwise would have.

[10:47] You can reinforce your reputation in the marketplace by continuing to overdeliver to people who

[10:51] will never give you money and that's okay because they know the people will. If a lead magnet is not good enough

[10:57] that people then tell other people about it in my opinion you have failed. Put $100

[11:01] into something if you've never put more than 10, put $100 in and see what actually happens to the

[11:06] quality of the work you put out. And your audience will appreciate that because people can tell

[11:11] if all it is. It's step seven is that you want to make it easy for them to take the next step.

[11:15] All right, this is so important and people forget about it. So we do all this work and we forget

[11:19] to make it easy for them to tell us that they want to buy more when you're making call to actions.

[11:24] Don't be clever. Be clear. Just say go to Amazon search my name and you'll find the book.

[11:31] Go to my website, agquisition.com, watch the videos. Be very clear about what you want the people to do.

[11:37] And if you want, give them multiple ways to do it. It's the same concept as making multiple ways

[11:41] of consumption but making multiple ways for people to take action. Just like the book consumption,

[11:45] you can double and triple your response rates on CTAs by making it available in the way that is convenient

[11:51] to them. It's their preference. Some people like phones. Some people like typing in the URLs.

[11:55] Some people like scanning. It just depends on the person and you want to make yourself available to all.

[11:59] And believe it or not, we can read about 20% of one chapter of this book. I'm going to have a big

[12:03] launch party for my book and if the book's already out either way it'll still be the same URL which is

[12:08] acquisition.com for slash leads. Go there and either be a training or there'll be a registration

[12:12] for the biggest event ever. It's going to be awesome. I will do everything my power to over the

[12:16] like crazy for everyone to attend. So, can be there or be square.

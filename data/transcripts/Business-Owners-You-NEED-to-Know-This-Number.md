[00:00] I want to talk to you about a formula,

[00:01] better stated, a ratio that you need to absolutely know.

[00:04] Like the back of your hand, if you want to grow a big ass business.

[00:08] And if you understand this number, you'll be able to make better decisions.

[00:12] You'll be able to predict how far you can see your advertising,

[00:15] how profitable you're going to be, how many customers you can get,

[00:17] and number of other factors that are all derived from this one number in the business.

[00:21] I cracked $100 million net worth at age 31.

[00:24] All of the huge growth in money came from times

[00:29] when this number was maximized.

[00:31] The most business is kind of putter along at a mediocre version of this number.

[00:35] But when you really knock it out of the park,

[00:37] you can absolutely have a license to print money for as long as you possibly can.

[00:42] And at the very end, I'm going to tell you the two levers you can crank

[00:45] to move this number into the stratosphere.

[00:48] So what is the number?

[00:49] Well, the number is actually a ratio between two different numbers.

[00:51] And these numbers have multiple metrics that create those numbers.

[00:54] So it's an incredibly densely packed number,

[00:56] and it describes so many things that happen within the business.

[00:59] And it will tell you how much opportunity you have,

[01:02] which is why it's so exciting for me.

[01:03] The first number of this ratio is LTV, so lifetime value.

[01:06] Now, in common speak, people say lifetime value,

[01:09] but what they really mean is lifetime growth profit.

[01:11] And so let me explain the difference.

[01:12] Most people say lifetime value, and they think,

[01:15] okay, well, so many pays me $1,000 a month for five months.

[01:17] That means their lifetime value is $5,000.

[01:19] No, that's not the lifetime value.

[01:21] You have to take out the cost of delivering on whatever service or good you have,

[01:25] and then you have the lifetime growth profit,

[01:27] because that is the profit that you'll be able to reinvest in growing the business

[01:30] or that you'll be able to take out as a business owner.

[01:32] On the other hand, you have hard costs,

[01:34] which is the cac to get that customer to pay you the money.

[01:37] And so if you think about relationship between these two metrics,

[01:40] it's really how much it costs you to make more money.

[01:44] And so you spend money to acquire a customer or time,

[01:47] which still costs money, to make more money.

[01:49] And this is the fundamental economic unit of the business that propels the business

[01:53] and predicts how big it can get.

[01:56] If I see a small business at 101 LTV to Cac ratio,

[01:59] and they have a reliable way of getting customers,

[02:01] then I know that this thing's getting scaled to the absolute moon,

[02:03] because I can be at so inefficient.

[02:05] I can be 110th as efficient on my advertising

[02:07] and still have 10 to one returns.

[02:09] And so people can obsessed in the stock market about 5%

[02:11] 10% per year returns, whereas the reason that businesses can create

[02:16] disproportionate wealth in very accelerated time periods

[02:19] is because you can put $1 in and get $100 back tomorrow.

[02:23] There's nothing else that does this.

[02:24] And that's why mastering the LTV to Cac ratio

[02:27] has been something that I've obsessed with my entire life as a business owner,

[02:30] as an entrepreneur, and now as an investor.

[02:32] So let me tell you what it looks like when it's done wrong.

[02:33] So I had a Facebook ad agency come up for me and say,

[02:35] hey, we're crushing it.

[02:37] We're getting five to one return on our ads,

[02:39] meaning cost us $1 to make five.

[02:42] And so it cost us $2,000 to get a customer

[02:44] and they're worth $10,000 to us.

[02:46] And they're like, but we're losing money every month.

[02:48] Rather than jump immediately into pay roll and try to figure out

[02:50] the cost for, I said, well, break down your LTV metrics for me.

[02:53] And again, I'll use LTV because that's what common speak is

[02:57] in business work.

[02:57] I say lifetime gross profit because I think it's more specific.

[03:00] So break down your LTV GP for me.

[03:02] And he said, OK, so it's $2,000 a month for our service

[03:05] and the average person stays five months.

[03:06] And I was like, OK, in other words, they 20% turn.

[03:09] So you take the price divided by turn, which is 20%.

[03:12] equals $10,000.

[03:13] So there's two different ways of explaining it.

[03:14] Five months on average is $2,000 times five.

[03:17] But it's 10 or $2,000 divided by 20% turn is also 10.

[03:21] You have to know this stuff.

[03:22] I know people don't like money math, but by swarming out.

[03:24] If you can't do this division, you will literally never make money.

[03:27] OK, back to it.

[03:29] From the $2,000 a month, I was like, so what do they pay an ad spend?

[03:32] I was like, oh, no, we wrapped it into that.

[03:34] I was like, OK, here we go.

[03:36] What are you spending per month for them in ad spend?

[03:38] They're like, well, we budget $1,000 a month.

[03:40] I was like, OK, so $2,000 becomes $1,000 leftover.

[03:43] I was like, OK, do you have a super efficient delivery model?

[03:46] And they're like, yeah, every account gets a representative.

[03:50] I was like, OK, how many accounts can a representative handle?

[03:53] They're like, well, we used to do 10, but they can't really handle that.

[03:56] So we have them do five accounts.

[03:58] I was like, OK, well, what do you pay those reps?

[04:00] And they're like, well, $5,000 a month each.

[04:02] And I was like, OK, $5,000 a month each divided by five accounts means $1,000 per account.

[04:08] So $1,000 to ad spend $1,000 went to management.

[04:12] $0 left over.

[04:14] And I was like, so what you guys have figured out is a way to take $2,000 and turn it into

[04:17] zero.

[04:20] And they looked at me like I had killed their mother.

[04:24] But the point is, this is an extreme example.

[04:27] But a lot of businesses have this situation where they have a cost of goods.

[04:30] They have some cost of service that's added on top.

[04:33] And they take it as though it's revenue.

[04:35] When it's really, you have to look at the gross profit.

[04:37] What's left over after you deliver the goods?

[04:40] Now, to be clear, there are fixed costs in a business, meaning you've got rent.

[04:43] You've got some people that have nothing to do with delivery.

[04:46] You don't factor this in the gross profits.

[04:47] If you sell an additional unit, that additional unit, that additional gross profit goes

[04:51] to you that you can either reinvest in the business or just pocket as a business owner,

[04:55] which you doesn't like that.

[04:57] And so fundamentally, this is LTV.

[04:58] This is how much money you make from the customer for real, not your wink, wink, stripe,

[05:03] screenshot.

[05:04] And if you're a business owner and you like learning this language of business and

[05:07] want to understand more deeply than many other metrics that exist in the business

[05:10] to that you can pull on the leverage that accelerate the value you have.

[05:13] We just started a workshop division at acquisition.com for companies that we don't own.

[05:17] If you want to see if you qualify, you can fly out to Vegas.

[05:20] We spend a whole day with the company and our teams there and we show you all the things

[05:23] that we would do if we bought your business tomorrow to grow it.

[05:27] So if that sounds interesting, you can go to acquisition.com, hit the scale button, and if you

[05:30] qualify, our team will reach out.

[05:31] The cac is actually very simple to understand.

[05:34] It's just how much it costs you to get the customer.

[05:36] And all you have to do here is just look historically.

[05:38] You say, okay, over the last 30 days, this has been this much on my marketing payroll.

[05:42] I spend this much on my media, the advertising dollar, so I spent, and I spent this

[05:45] much on my sales team in commissions.

[05:47] You add all that up and then you divide that by how many customers you got.

[05:51] So if you spent $10,000 in ads and you spent $10,000 in payroll between sales and marketing,

[05:56] your cost is $20,000.

[05:58] And if you had 20 customers, then it'd be $1,000 a month.

[06:01] That would be your cac.

[06:02] And so then you'd look at that cac, which now is very clear.

[06:04] A lot of people can understand their cac quickly where they get messed up as their LTV.

[06:07] But once you have these two metrics, you can understand the fundamental economic unit

[06:11] of the business, which is when I put $1 in here, I get this much juice on the back end

[06:15] back to me.

[06:16] So let me talk about what it looks like when it's done right.

[06:18] And this is where you start printing money.

[06:20] So I'm going to give you an extreme example that some of you guys may or may not have

[06:22] heard of.

[06:23] So there's this little company called Starbox that has little coffee business.

[06:26] You might have heard of them.

[06:27] They got 38,000 locations.

[06:29] You want to know how they were able to grow to that scale without franchising to grow.

[06:34] Now they do have a tiny little bit of franchising, but the vast vast majority of the stores

[06:38] are corporate owned.

[06:40] And so something that has cost that much capital opening up.

[06:42] We got all these new stores.

[06:43] You got these buildouts.

[06:44] You got marketing budgets for these local locations.

[06:47] How are they able to do that and do it privately?

[06:50] They made a lot of money every time they put a dollar into their economic machine.

[06:54] So let me tell you how much money they make.

[06:57] Every customer that comes into Starbucks, the lifetime value, how much money they make from

[07:02] a customer is $14,000 and $99.

[07:05] And that is gotten $5 Machiados at a time.

[07:09] And that means that they keep customers for years and years and years and years.

[07:16] It turns out that when you boil hot water and you sell for six bucks, you make a lot

[07:19] of money.

[07:20] And one of the crazy things about a business like Starbucks is that the cost your car customer

[07:23] for a local food business is typically very small.

[07:26] Now I don't know their hack and I probably could look into their public data and try

[07:29] and figure out how many customers they have.

[07:30] But I'll tell you that I had a personal experience marketing for a cookie company.

[07:33] Years ago, I ran ads locally for them to have a free cookie with a beverage.

[07:40] The average leak cost was under a dollar and we got one out of 10 leads in the door.

[07:44] And so I'll cost us 10 bucks to get somebody in the door.

[07:46] If you have a $14,000 lifetime value and it costs you $10 to get somebody to walk in

[07:51] the door, you make a lot of money.

[07:53] And so that wasn't a five to one, a 10 to one, even a hundred to one return.

[07:58] That was a $1400 to one return.

[08:02] And that is how you build something that is absolutely massive.

[08:05] So once you get into business, whether you're at a million or three million or 10 million,

[08:08] whatever it is a year that you're at, you start to run into this wall because more cost

[08:11] later you get customers because you're reaching out to colder and colder audiences, you're

[08:14] going to new channels to find them and it just simply costs you more.

[08:17] And so the only way to continue to scale, obviously you can make your ads better, you can

[08:21] make your offers better.

[08:23] But the other way to scale is to be able to afford to simply acquire customers for more

[08:27] expensive.

[08:28] So let's say that Starbucks, cost your car customer went from $10 to $50.

[08:31] Well, boohoo, still really, really good.

[08:34] The point is, is that if you have a massive LCV to cat ratio, your cat can double or triple

[08:40] and you're still printing money.

[08:42] And so that allows you to enter new marketing channels, new media channels, colder audiences

[08:47] and outspend your competition.

[08:49] And so this is in some ways an ethical, competitive mode.

[08:53] There's two ways to have them inoply.

[08:55] One way is that you have a way to undercut everybody in the marketplace so they can't

[09:01] survive and then eventually put everyone out of business because you have enough capital

[09:04] to do so.

[09:05] Another way of having them inoply that is legal is that you can literally just outspend

[09:09] people to get customers.

[09:11] And so most advertising marketplaces are based on an auction.

[09:15] So the auction for attention and the highest bidder is the one who wins the eyeball.

[09:18] They win the click.

[09:19] And so if you in the purchase of the eyeball or of the click, you can outspend 100% of

[09:24] your competition, then you can ethically take all of their money and all of their customers.

[09:29] The reason this is so important as a business owner is that if you don't know these metrics,

[09:33] you might be able to get to a million, two million, maybe three million dollars a year,

[09:36] but you're not going to be able to scale beyond that because you're not going to have

[09:38] a consistent way to spend money on the front end and then know how much you're recruiting

[09:41] in at what time.

[09:43] And so I had a business owner who actually was a business coach, ironically, who was doing

[09:47] three million bucks a year and I said, well, what's your else to be to cat creation?

[09:50] He was like, I don't know.

[09:51] And I was like, how are you doing this?

[09:53] And I say this with love.

[09:55] I just said, know your data so that you can scale your company.

[09:58] I just kept repeating.

[09:59] He just kept asking me questions.

[10:00] I was like, you have to know your data so that you can scale your company.

[10:03] That's it.

[10:04] And these two data points are so simple to get.

[10:08] And yet so few businesses do it.

[10:10] And this is not a testament to the fact that you can see, see, despite it.

[10:14] It's a testament to the fact that that's why so few businesses make money.

[10:16] I mean, shoot, only one out of every 250 businesses gets the $10 million

[10:20] year.

[10:21] And getting the $10 million year, you just have to follow fundamental business and know

[10:25] that I make $10 for you one dollar put in.

[10:27] I want to run this machine as many times as I can.

[10:29] Silly break down a couple of these concepts for you.

[10:31] So you've got the LTGP and you've got CAC.

[10:34] CAC's the easy one.

[10:36] Just whatever your cost is on a monthly basis divided by number of customers.

[10:39] You can look at this on a monthly basis.

[10:41] You can look at a weekly basis.

[10:43] And if you really want an accurate metric, look it over a year.

[10:45] You say, how much did I spend over this entire year in payroll from marketing?

[10:48] Total and ad spend, total and whatever?

[10:50] You need to divide it by number of customers.

[10:51] It's back of napkin.

[10:52] But honestly, that takes out a lot of the volatility of campaigns, good sales guys, or bad sales

[10:57] days, whatever.

[10:58] And then gives you a number that's realistic.

[11:00] This is actually how much it cost me to get a customer.

[11:02] Now in the lifetime gross profit side, there's a few more numbers.

[11:05] So you have your price.

[11:06] Most people know what that is.

[11:08] And then you have to subtract out your cost of goods sold.

[11:10] All right.

[11:11] Now on a physical product business, if I'm selling books, let's say it costs me $10 to print

[11:14] in chip a book.

[11:15] If I sell the book for $20, then my gross profit is $10.

[11:18] Most people in the physical product space tend to get this pretty quickly.

[11:21] What's interesting is that the service base guys don't get it at all.

[11:25] And so for some reason, they think, OK, well, I have five guys on payroll that do all

[11:30] of my delivery.

[11:31] All of the customers, I get, is just all profit.

[11:33] It's like, no, you have to take out the fact that you've got five guys on payroll, and

[11:36] you've got 20 customers.

[11:38] And you take that payroll and you divide it by 20.

[11:39] And that's what your cost of delivery is.

[11:41] Which means that the cost of delivery may change as you get more customers.

[11:44] But you can model out what it looks like at scale.

[11:47] So if you know that every five, you need to hire another guy, then you're either going

[11:50] to, each guy is going to max out of this.

[11:51] And you know that that's going to be your fixed amount of cost to deliver your service.

[11:56] And so the service guys tend to get this more mixed up than the physical product ones.

[11:59] Now, once we know what our gross profit is, which is the price minus that cost, then it says,

[12:03] how many times do I get this?

[12:05] And so that's a function of either the number of purchases they make or the number of

[12:09] months they stay.

[12:10] The number of months they stay, you can take the inverse of that, which is what percentage

[12:13] of people leave and you can divide that and you can get that as a hypothetical metric.

[12:17] And so I'll give you an example.

[12:18] A lot of business owners were younger or starting out or like, okay, well, I've only been

[12:21] in business for six months.

[12:23] And so I don't know what my LTV is because people are still coming in and we're still growing.

[12:27] You can actually still get a hypothetical on this, which is you just simply say, I had 10 customers

[12:31] last month of the 10 that I started the month with 30 days later, how many of those 10 are

[12:37] still with me?

[12:38] If nine are with you, then you have 10% turn.

[12:40] And so you divide your price by 10% and that gives you your LTV, which is the same as

[12:44] multiplying by 10, which means the average duration they stay is 10 months.

[12:48] And that's why they call it lifetime gross profit.

[12:50] And so once you understand this, this gives you an enormous amount of power to do a number

[12:55] of things.

[12:56] So number one is I had a business the other day that came to me and was saying, hey,

[12:59] I have two front ends for my business.

[13:02] I was a hair salon girl.

[13:04] And so she was able to teach other hair stylist how to make extensions.

[13:08] I think she was charging $2,000 or something like that to teach them how to do extensions.

[13:11] And then she also had like a business coaching thing where she helped them grow their

[13:14] business.

[13:15] And she said, I just, you know, I'm running ads for both of them.

[13:17] I don't know how I should structure my business.

[13:19] And I was like, okay, well, what's the LTV to catch?

[13:21] She had done her homework.

[13:22] And so she said, well, this one, we make 34 to one, meaning her cost to get somebody who

[13:27] wanted to learn how to get hair extensions or how to put hair extensions in.

[13:31] It cost her like 30 or 40 bucks, whatever the math is there on a $2,000 sale.

[13:36] And so she had a $2,000 sale and so she was getting 30 to one on that.

[13:39] And so it cost her 67 bucks to get a customer who's going to pay her $2,000 for a digital

[13:44] product.

[13:45] So the rest of that's gross margin.

[13:47] Wow, what a great LTV to catch, right?

[13:49] On the flip side, she had her business coaching thing which she had something close to

[13:52] like $7 to one.

[13:54] And so that thing was $15,000 in a cost or whatever it was, $2,000 to get the sale.

[14:00] And so she's like, well, I like these customers a lot, but there's fewer of them.

[14:05] And they cost more to acquire.

[14:06] And she said, so what should I do?

[14:08] Because these obviously stack up fast.

[14:09] You know, you get 10 salesmen, 100 to 100 in a month, it's not bad, right?

[14:12] And she's like, I got to sell so many more of these.

[14:14] And so I asked her these questions.

[14:15] I said, well, are there more of these people that just want the hair thing than these people?

[14:19] And she said, yes, I said, is there a percentage of these people that also buy this thing?

[14:23] And she said, yes, it's great.

[14:25] And so what we need to do is you stop advertising this and then you make this the front

[14:30] end for this and this becomes the back end.

[14:33] And so then all of your focus after you acquire the customer is to ascend these people into

[14:37] this thing, which means your cost to a hard customer for here becomes zero.

[14:41] And then we can tack on 20% of this price to the total LTV here.

[14:48] And so this is how you start stacking LTV.

[14:50] The point is, let's say she got 20% of people to do the $15,000 thing.

[14:55] So that means that that $2,000 becomes a $5,000 LTV.

[14:59] So let me break that down.

[15:00] So $2,000 guaranteed, because every person who buys gets that.

[15:03] Now we multiply 20% the number of them that buys the $15,000 thing, which is 20%

[15:09] times 15,000, $3,000 and you add that to the front end.

[15:12] So it means one out of five pays an extra 15.

[15:14] Great.

[15:15] So that means on average you make $5,000.

[15:17] So that took her LTV to cack from 31 to 75 to 1.

[15:21] That means that she can market even more aggressively and she can market it the biggest

[15:25] time.

[15:26] Many of you have one or two or three different products or offers on the front end.

[15:29] And you're trying to figure out what's the thing I should advertise?

[15:31] Look at the LTV to cack and then start with the thing that has the best LTV to cack ratio

[15:37] and then stack behind it everything else.

[15:39] And then that further increases your ratio of how much you can spend to get the customer

[15:45] to make more money.

[15:46] So many business owners ask me questions that they can solve with math.

[15:49] Like this isn't opinion thing.

[15:50] This isn't like, well, I talked to three mentors and one guy gave me this advice and

[15:53] that like this is a math problem, which is why you have to learn it.

[15:57] And so if you have a stronger LTV to cack, the exception here is if the tamis

[16:01] tiny, you're total address of one market, the number of heads that you can sell.

[16:05] But most of you were listening this aren't even close to saturating your market.

[16:08] You're like, I've sold 100 customers in my market as 1 million people.

[16:12] Okay, you don't need to worry about saturation yet.

[16:14] And so fundamentally, if you've got something that has an ocean of customers and you have

[16:18] a crazy amount of what you put in versus what you get out, you do as much of that as you

[16:22] possibly can.

[16:23] And then you stack the other things behind it to further increase your leverage.

[16:27] The last consideration that I'll bring up, which is already factored into LTV, is the

[16:32] operational efficiency.

[16:33] So let me explain.

[16:34] I had a business that we were looking at acquiring.

[16:36] It was a chain of glass repair.

[16:38] And they specifically focused on glass work for residential.

[16:42] And so they had a number of different customers that they worked with.

[16:44] They had high end, you know, million dollar plus homes.

[16:46] They would have those big glass, you know, things and weird bathrooms and whatever people

[16:51] do with glass.

[16:52] One of the partners from that business peeled off and started a chain only doing one thing

[16:56] in the entire product stack.

[16:57] And so what he did was he did his homework.

[17:00] He figured out that shower doors were a product that was very easy to sell.

[17:05] People, many people wanted it.

[17:06] There was a huge market for people who just wanted to replace their sharders and the delivery.

[17:10] So the cost of goods sold to deliver the door was actually very low.

[17:13] And so one guy could do five, ten doors a day, whereas doing the custom glass work might

[17:17] take months.

[17:18] So even though the ticket was higher, they could productize that service to such a higher

[17:21] degree.

[17:22] And the LTV to KAC was actually higher even though the average ticket was lower.

[17:27] And so because of that though, he could turn this into a machine that he could repeat again

[17:31] and again and again.

[17:32] And I had the same conversation with somebody who was in the pool design business.

[17:35] He said, well, I designed commercial pools, I designed resort pools, I designed residential

[17:39] pools, and I designed modular pools.

[17:41] And I said, okay, how hard is it to do all these?

[17:44] And he's like, well, they're all kind of hard.

[17:45] But these ones, the modular pools are the ones that I could do easy.

[17:49] Because it's only like six or seven variables and you just kind of plug them together.

[17:51] And I was like, okay, how is the margin on that?

[17:54] And he said, well, the margin is good there.

[17:55] And I also have a much faster cycle because you can, from the time they say yes to the

[17:58] time it's in their backyard, it's really fast.

[18:00] And I was like, okay, are there more people going by modular pools than resort pools?

[18:03] And he was like, yeah, okay, now we're starting to talk about something that looks interesting.

[18:06] And so he was like, what do I do?

[18:08] And I was like, well, this is a math problem.

[18:10] You have something that has a higher LTV to KAC.

[18:12] You have a higher TAM.

[18:14] And it's something, and this is just side benefit.

[18:16] It's faster.

[18:17] So you have a way faster loop.

[18:18] And you can productize this to much higher degree, whereas all of this stuff is

[18:21] custom and one-off stuff, which makes it very, very difficult to scale.

[18:25] Many of you have a big resort thing and a modular pool.

[18:29] Many of you guys have custom glasswork in the house or a shower door.

[18:32] You want to find the shower door in your business that everyone immediately understands.

[18:36] They can come in that's really cheap.

[18:38] Many people want it.

[18:39] You can deliver that value quickly.

[18:40] Now, some of you are like, well, I'm not passionate about shower doors.

[18:43] The question is what game you want to play?

[18:45] Listen, there's tons of people that are out there that say like follow your passion, whatever.

[18:48] In my opinion, so this might be contrary.

[18:50] This is at the highest levels, all the same.

[18:52] So if you succeed at your passion to a high enough degree, your business, and what your

[18:57] day-to-day will look like, almost entirely be the same.

[18:59] You're going to be having a team of people who reports you.

[19:02] You're going to have a head of sales, you're going to have a marketing, you're going to

[19:04] have a legal, you're going to have IT, you're going to have finance, you're going to have

[19:07] some ops, maybe some tech, whatever.

[19:10] All those people are just going to roll into you.

[19:11] And so whether you're selling books or you're selling pools or you're selling shower doors,

[19:15] you're selling marketing agency services, if you succeed, taking to his natural end, you're

[19:19] going to end up in the same boat.

[19:20] So I'd recommend starting with the one that has the highest chance likely to get there.

[19:24] Because otherwise, what you don't want to have happen is have your passion turn into work.

[19:28] So what many of you guys don't know is that the first year of Jim Lunge, my LTVDCAC ratio

[19:32] was 101.

[19:34] I spent $100,000 and made $10 million back.

[19:37] And yes, it was that insane for me too.

[19:39] A lot of the wealth that I've been made has made in these punctuated periods of time when

[19:42] my LTVDCAC racers were absolutely absurd.

[19:45] And so when you have one of those things, and if you do crack this code, I highly recommend

[19:49] Jim is much as you possibly can do that.

[19:53] That machine, you think it's going to be illegal because you're making so much money.

[19:57] And that's okay.

[19:59] It's normal.

[19:59] Just keep pushing as hard as you can.

[20:01] Let's talk about how to improve it.

[20:03] So I've talked briefly about the LTV stuff, which for the most part is going to be decreasing

[20:06] turn, increasing price.

[20:07] So those are the things that are going to increase LTV.

[20:09] And having additional crossels and upsells.

[20:11] I'll just give you the highlight reel of how to improve that.

[20:14] You can increase the price.

[20:15] You can decrease the cost of delivery.

[20:18] You can get people to buy more times.

[20:21] You can cross sell them additional things.

[20:23] So that's like if you buy a burger, you buy fries.

[20:25] You can upsell them a better version of the thing.

[20:28] So instead of this burger, you get a surluna or waggy burger.

[20:31] You can sell a higher quantity of that.

[20:33] One burger to two burgers.

[20:34] You can downsell them, turning a no sale into a sale.

[20:38] So they would have been a zero.

[20:40] Instead of you get a junior wiper, you get a smaller burger.

[20:43] Or you go from a surluna burger to a mystery meat burger.

[20:47] And so that's the downsell.

[20:48] That gives you more, better, smaller, worse.

[20:53] Cross sell different, more number of options that you sell.

[20:57] Increase the price.

[20:58] Decrease the cost of goods.

[20:59] And you can do that with any product you have.

[21:01] If I sell iPhone cases, I can increase the price of this case.

[21:06] I can become more efficient with the manufacturing to decrease the cost of my delivery

[21:10] to make this case.

[21:12] I can cross sell a wallet that tax onto this.

[21:16] I can increase the legacy by another case in six months by trying to say,

[21:20] hey, do you want to have different color cases?

[21:21] So you can do them by mood.

[21:23] I can increase the number of cases saying, hey, do you want a spare case?

[21:26] I can increase the quality of the case and say,

[21:28] this is a metal case versus a plastic case.

[21:32] I can make this a cheaper case.

[21:34] And what I could do in terms of the quality of the material,

[21:37] or I could sell fewer units if I had that case.

[21:39] Every product that exists on the marketplace,

[21:42] you can find a better version, a more version, a cheaper version,

[21:45] a fewer version, a cross sold version.

[21:47] You decrease the cost of goods.

[21:49] You get them to buy more of them or you increase the price.

[21:51] Those are the ways that you increase healthy weight.

[21:53] And so if you want to improve your ratio,

[21:54] that's your homework for this video.

[21:56] And you can show this video to your team.

[21:57] And you have to check off those boxes.

[21:58] Okay, if we did have our book, how do we make this book?

[22:03] Make us more money.

[22:04] Well, I can raise the price of the book.

[22:06] I can try and buy volume of printing so that I can drive down the cost.

[22:09] I can spread out the books between three different warehouses

[22:12] so that I can have cheaper shipping prices

[22:14] because it's closer to my customers.

[22:16] Those would be the first two price and then cost of goods.

[22:19] I can cross sell in an additional book.

[22:22] I can try to get somebody by more of this book.

[22:24] Can't really get somebody by less of this book.

[22:26] I could have a book lit or a summary version of the book

[22:28] that I could choose to sell.

[22:30] That would give me a worse or inferior version of the book.

[22:33] In terms of decreasing quality, if I sold a number of units,

[22:35] instead of selling a three pack, I'd downsell a one pack.

[22:38] And so each of these, you can look at any product

[22:41] through these lenses and think is through each of those,

[22:43] which of these is the easiest for us to immediately implement

[22:46] within our business that doesn't create operational drag.

[22:48] Me writing a second book probably a lot of work.

[22:51] Me asking people to buy a second book, much less work.

[22:53] Now, let's talk about decreasing the other second.

[22:55] Because this is a ratio, right?

[22:57] And so you could not change anything about your LTV

[22:59] and still massively improve the ratio

[23:00] by decreasing the cac.

[23:01] You're cost too hard, customer.

[23:02] And so what do you do here?

[23:03] So cac is a funnel, right?

[23:06] And so in order to decrease cac, it's about efficiency.

[23:10] And so advertising always works.

[23:12] You always reach people when you input something into the system.

[23:15] If you make a post, you reach people.

[23:17] If you were to spend a billion dollars,

[23:18] you could reach everyone on earth, right?

[23:20] The idea is simply how efficient are you with that dollar?

[23:24] And so with cac, everything is a percentage off of 100%.

[23:29] So you start with an average, I suppose,

[23:30] reaches 100% of people.

[23:31] And then a small percentage of those people,

[23:34] click or take the first step.

[23:35] From there, you have a percentage people that schedule.

[23:38] Certain percentage people that show.

[23:40] Certain percentage, that buy.

[23:41] Certain percentage, that, then, upsell.

[23:43] Whatever.

[23:43] And so as you go through this funnel to decrease cac,

[23:47] you either have to get cheaper eyeballs,

[23:49] the raw unit that you're taking this price tag off of,

[23:52] or you improve the efficiency after you've paid for the eyeball,

[23:55] to increase the likelihood that a person buys.

[23:58] In CRO, just like, so conversion optimization.

[24:01] Just like LTV, oftentimes, there isn't a silver bullet.

[24:04] I'd say the only thing that's the closest thing to silver bullet

[24:06] in the cac world is nailing your offer.

[24:09] Nailing, what thing you're going to package together

[24:11] that you can put out the marketplace that everybody wants?

[24:13] I'll give you an interesting monitor concept around this

[24:15] is that I build LTV back to front, meaning I want to think

[24:18] about the most expensive thing and work my way back

[24:20] for it so that I can stack as much life time growth

[24:23] profit into my customers I can.

[24:25] I think about cac front to back.

[24:26] The reason for that is that I want to optimize the things

[24:29] in the earlier parts of the funnel

[24:30] because they affect a higher percentage of people.

[24:32] You're often working with smaller percentages

[24:34] at the onset and bigger percentages later.

[24:36] And so I'll walk you through an example.

[24:37] So if your ad gets shown to call it 10,000 people,

[24:41] and you have a 1% click through rate.

[24:42] Well, me having a better ad might get a 3% click through rate.

[24:47] There's almost nothing that's going to take my show rate,

[24:50] well, there is nothing that's going to take my show rate

[24:51] from 60% to 180%.

[24:53] There's nothing that's going to take my close rate

[24:55] from 35% to 105%.

[24:58] Like is not going to happen.

[24:59] I like going front to back because in terms of order of magnitude

[25:04] of how much I can impact or grow the business

[25:07] or rather decrease the costial car customer,

[25:09] I can have a greater impact from the front to the back.

[25:11] I'll make one, one tiny pro tip on this,

[25:14] which is that I in general work front to back for cac.

[25:18] If I have a clear outlier, if I have a 5% short break,

[25:20] but everything else is amazing.

[25:22] And I know the industry average is 60%.

[25:24] Well, then I do see that I have a 12x there

[25:26] that I can go get.

[25:28] It's just not often.

[25:29] And so most of the time, the biggest gains

[25:31] are going to come from improvement in advertising,

[25:33] improving the offer, improving the headline,

[25:35] and the availability of the team.

[25:37] If you have a sales team or if you have an e-commerce

[25:39] business, then it's going to be CRO on the page,

[25:41] the offer you're making on the page,

[25:42] the headline on the page, and the quality of the advertisements

[25:45] and selves.

[25:45] And so whenever I enter any industry and to be fair at this point,

[25:47] I've seen so many businesses

[25:49] because we get so much jailflow at acquisition.com.

[25:51] I've a really good pulse for what it costs to get

[25:54] a small business owner for an SEO day agency.

[25:56] I have a pretty good pulse for what it costs to get somebody

[25:58] to buy a $99 a month software package.

[26:01] I have a pretty good idea of what it costs to sell someone

[26:03] into a franchise.

[26:05] There's very different benchmarks that exist,

[26:08] but the good thing is it's very rare that you have truly

[26:11] novel businesses because more often you're selling

[26:15] to an existing avatar.

[26:16] So even if you have a novel business,

[26:18] you're still selling the same person.

[26:19] So it's going to cost you about the same amount of money

[26:21] to get in front of those people

[26:23] and then convert them into a customer.

[26:24] Now the variable will be what that person's worth to you,

[26:26] which is the LTV.

[26:27] But KAC is much less variable between different players.

[26:30] And so the reason that some businesses

[26:32] stay around forever and others don't

[26:34] is that the KAC between the biggest businesses

[26:36] is oftentimes about the same.

[26:38] The difference is how much LTV they've been able to stack.

[26:41] And that is what creates that long-term competitive

[26:44] advantage for them.

[26:45] And if this was a denser video,

[26:46] this was literally just unpacking one ratio inside of business.

[26:50] And you have to get fluent with this.

[26:52] I'd encourage you to rewatch it,

[26:53] or re-list into this if you're listening to it.

[26:55] You have to be able to breathe this stuff.

[26:57] This has to be your first language.

[26:58] If you want to get in business,

[26:59] this is the language of business.

[27:01] Your ability to conceptualize ideas

[27:03] is directly proportional to your vocabulary

[27:05] within a given domain.

[27:07] I create frameworks that people find simple

[27:11] because I'm fluent in the language.

[27:14] And I can draw pictures about it

[27:16] because I've had to think through it so many different times

[27:18] and so many different types of business

[27:20] that I could draw.

[27:21] What is the difference between selling a book

[27:23] and selling an iPhone and selling SEO services

[27:25] and selling a franchise?

[27:26] Can you apply LTV to KAC to investing?

[27:30] Interesting.

[27:31] What's your cost to buy a company?

[27:34] What do you make on that company?

[27:35] Over the lifetime.

[27:36] Interesting.

[27:38] It's just chunked up at another level

[27:39] where the product and the customer

[27:41] itself is really in the business.

[27:42] So this principle applies at all levels of business.

[27:46] The more you ingrain it into your DNA

[27:48] and your lexicon and the language that you think with,

[27:51] rather than just what you speak with, but what you think with.

[27:53] Understanding that this is the ratio

[27:55] that drives the business means

[27:56] that you're going to ladder up the initiatives

[27:58] and the activities that you do in the business

[28:00] to drive one of these two sides.

[28:02] If what you're doing is not getting you more customer's

[28:04] cheaper or making those customers worth more,

[28:06] then you are probably wasting your time.

[28:08] This LTV KAC ratio is just one of many numbers

[28:11] that we use to analyze and grow a business.

[28:13] And I've a utility that's more in-depth, more advanced stuff

[28:16] if you're a business owner and you want to grow your business

[28:19] faster.

[28:19] Comment below or have one of your teammates

[28:20] comment below which one of the eight ways

[28:22] that I just talked about, you can implement

[28:24] in your business tomorrow.

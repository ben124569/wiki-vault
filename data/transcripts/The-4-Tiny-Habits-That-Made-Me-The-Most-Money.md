[00:00] Mozy Nation, what to do the number of questions that I continue to get on Instagram and on this channel is

[00:06] what are the habits that created some of the success we have? And so in this video, I want to walk you through the

[00:10] four highest ROI habits that have viewed it outside of returns. If you don't know why I'm

[00:14] having to do this channel, my name is Alchromozi. I'm an acquisition.com. We do about $85 million a year

[00:19] to portfolio company. Reason I make this channel is because a lot of people are broken, I don't want

[00:22] to be one of them. Of the videos that I've made, this one is actually from the past, I had a

[00:26] private community that I used to just put videos in for fun over the last five years, over 300 of them.

[00:32] And this video was one of the top 1% videos. And so I wanted to share it with you guys publicly,

[00:36] enjoy. Warning everyone, hope you guys are having a fantastic, amazing tremendous Thursday.

[00:43] I wanted to make a quick video for you. I actually woke up with this on my mind and I thought I

[00:48] would share it. And so I'm calling this my four highest ROI habits. And I know I probably should say

[00:53] three, because three is probably a better number. Before was what I was really thinking about. These are the

[00:57] things that were learned behaviors that I think if I look back on behaviors that have been able

[01:03] that have propelled us forward faster. These are the four things that have done that. The first one

[01:10] is waking up at 4 a.m. And it kind of goes hand in hand with the second to have it's all kind of

[01:15] put these together, which is consistent bed times. And that includes weekends. So basically,

[01:21] consistent time going to bed and consistent time waking up. And I know that sounds minor,

[01:25] but a lot of times for a long period of my life, I would wake up early five days a week and then on weekends,

[01:31] I would sleep in and I go to bed late because I was like, I'm living on the weekends and during the week

[01:36] I'm working. And I did that for a long period of time. The thing is, like, your body doesn't work that way.

[01:40] I think the consistency in the most basic way is literally going to bed at the same time weekend

[01:44] and weekday and waking up at the same time week and weekday. I know this sounds really minor,

[01:51] but especially that 4 a.m. weekend time. Like us as entrepreneurs, like we're, I think we're a little bit

[01:56] more reactive than most blur from an emotional standpoint. Like I think we're also a little bit more scattered by

[02:01] nature. I don't like to speak that over myself. I think that's like our intrinsic programming that we can work away from that.

[02:06] That's why I talked so much about controlling your space, controlling your attention is that like we're so much more

[02:11] prone to reactivity. Which is also why we want to solve problems faster because we're more

[02:16] uncomfortable than anyone else is, which is why we naturally move towards problem solving. Right?

[02:21] And so, waking up at 4 a.m. allows me to get all of my self-work done in the morning and still have

[02:29] 2, 3, 4, 5 sometimes dedicated hours to moving the big dominoes forward, the big projects that are

[02:36] going to make massive impact in the business and are working on the business, not in it. Basically,

[02:41] once I hit 9 a.m. 9 a.m. I would love to tell you that like, oh, I have four hours of CO time in the middle of

[02:51] the day that everyone knows that I can't do reach. The problem is that like, if you have a lawyer call

[02:56] come in because we have some thing or whatever, like I'm going to take the call. If we have a

[03:02] personnel issue or someone's like going nuts, you know what I mean? Like I'm going to take the call.

[03:07] And so, it's sure what sound nice to say like, yeah, I mean we're so disciplined at Jim Lens that Alex

[03:13] never gets, you know, brought in anything and to be fair, the team is awesome and like I really

[03:17] don't get brought into a lot of stuff. But the thing is, it's like my attention so good is pulled

[03:21] during the day once everyone else is kind of up. But from like 4 o'clock to 9 a.m. is like my time

[03:28] and that's where I really move like all of these big projects forward and that's where like,

[03:32] we're like, how you get so much done so fast? It's like, I just think most people don't get

[03:35] very much done during their days at all because they're working in their business not on it. And so we

[03:40] just move, we just are able to do a lot of things on the business which then accelerates the entire

[03:45] growth of the business because these are like, like the the bricks that you lay on the business

[03:49] are the ones that accelerate growth. The things you do in the business is kind of like,

[03:53] what is investment? What is spending cash? You know what I mean? Like an expense of time is how

[03:59] you're running your business and investment of time is what's going to move the entire business

[04:02] forward and so it's like, are you are you putting investment time in? And so for me, 4 a.m. to like,

[04:07] 9 is like that time period. The 2 first success, like I don't know 6 success habits because that's

[04:12] else lame. But like basically the habits that have gotten me that have made me the most funny,

[04:15] waking up at 4 a.m. and that is enabled by going to bed consistently at the same time on

[04:22] weekdays and weekends. It's just like you can't wake up at 9, 2 days a week and then wake up 5

[04:28] hours earlier and expect to be like a productive individual. It's just not going to shock it.

[04:32] So like I would implore you to just like, I mean and they were like, what about like concerts and

[04:38] like things that are like, going out with people? Like there's a reason entrepreneurs live the

[04:44] way they do like really hell of entrepreneurs live a certain way and it is a sacrifice.

[04:50] I mean if you see it that way, it is a choice and so like I choose that life and that's the life that

[04:57] I choose. You don't have to choose that. Just understand that you're going to, but like that's your

[05:00] trade off. Like and for me, going out to dinner at 730 on Friday is not important to me.

[05:08] I'd rather go up like all of my friends who are here in Austin know that like if they're going to go

[05:14] out with Alex and Leila, we're going to dinner at 545 so that we like get there, we're seated and we

[05:19] get sort of like we're eating by 615 and we can leave by 730 and then we can ride down.

[05:26] We're like they know that going into it. It's just like if you don't want to play that then like

[05:30] that's cool and it means that our relationship is invaluable and not for you to eat dinner earlier.

[05:34] And that's fine. You know what I mean? Most people are game to do that and they're like you know

[05:38] it's so nice being able to get back at 8 and like not ruin your routine. I'm like yeah it's awesome.

[05:42] Like that's why we do it. So first you're waking up early and then consistent bed times

[05:47] on the weekends especially. The next one is this is a little bit different. This is something that

[05:53] Leila has told me has been like one of the things that she observed early on in our relationship

[05:57] before she like knew me as her husband but like just a guy that she thought was doing things.

[06:03] I gently in this man he sounds kind of weird saying. I feel like this was her observation

[06:06] that she thought I should bring up in this. It was like genuinely trying to give to other people

[06:12] in your network without expectation. I've always been voted like into like president and leadership

[06:17] physicians and like everywhere and it's like when I was in high school I was president. Newspaper

[06:21] and president of the literary magazine when I went to college I was president of VP of the

[06:27] parliament of the team and president of the fraternios and like it's like you know me like it's

[06:32] you as odd and the thing is it's like most people think about leadership is like I have to be

[06:35] the big boss man. It's not work that way. For those who've ever studied it it's like the people who

[06:40] get voted into power are the people that that like it's funny people always think like the

[06:44] president of the fraternity is the one that's like the biggest major but the person that they want to

[06:48] vote into president is the one who's going to take the punchball away to make sure that like

[06:51] when the party is getting going to make sure that like we don't get arrested like you know

[06:55] things happen with their supposed to and it comes from a place of sort of like absurd. It's literally

[07:02] just giving without expectation and that comes to clients and a lot of times like I would say

[07:08] some of the highest ROI giving that I've done have been to people in my network whether like

[07:14] came in. Do you know anything about this and then I will go the extra mile to connect them with

[07:22] that one person but like four people do some initial screening myself and say hey man like this is

[07:28] what I saw this is what it looks like. Here's two people that I think might be going to help you and

[07:31] then this is my experience with it and they're like holy shit like thank you that's like awesome

[07:37] and then what happens is like you actually form a much better relationship because they're like wow

[07:40] this person like really cared right and then also in the future if I say like hey man do you

[07:46] know anything about this then they return the favor right and so um Laila jokes but she's like you

[07:52] have so many favors that you like have uncalled upon like so many I own use just like I feel like

[07:58] whenever we need something like you like you have three people you can call it immediately jump to

[08:03] help you and the only reason that happens is because I jump to help them with nothing like

[08:08] like expecting nothing back but just because I know that like long term they may have something

[08:14] or no someone who and it's not because of that it's just like and that's why it's like sort of a

[08:18] nature and they're thinking of whatever but I can tell you like if you can help people you will get

[08:23] more back and your reputation will also follow from that so those are probably the three biggest

[08:29] ROI habits the fourth one is what Laila said that I should I should mention uh which is like you should

[08:36] say something about sales I'd joke back with those like I think that's more of a skill set and not

[08:41] not not a habit not a behavior if there were to be a habit that would be associated with that it's

[08:46] jumping into a skill that you are not good at with the expectation that my first 20 hours I expect

[08:51] zero return on and so like if you can look at new skills that you are not good at or do not like

[08:57] we always have this discomfort with acquiring new skills like let's say I don't know how to run

[09:02] Facebook as I don't know how to make a landing page I don't know how to manage a team whatever it is

[09:08] right like you're going to suck for a while I think if you can remove the emotional blockage

[09:14] that stops you from taking action because most of us don't like start that new thing because we're

[09:18] afraid of sucking like just being real like we're emotionally afraid of sucking that and so if you

[09:24] think to yourself I'm going to get zero ROI from my first 20 hours ironically the first 20 hours

[09:30] is where you get like 70% of your gains in any new skill and then like everything after like hour and

[09:36] number 20 is like massive diminishing returns that happens after that right and so like if you just jump

[09:42] into it with zero activation for first one hours you'd be amazed at like how many people here if they

[09:46] actually tried like those are you were on here we're like man I really need to learn how to market

[09:51] if you Google how to run a Facebook ad and you spent 20 hours watching videos and how to do it you

[09:58] will be better than 99% of people who try and market because no one doesn't think like seriously like

[10:06] no one does anything and like most people suck at most things including the things they think they're

[10:12] good at right and those ones they also mainly usually aren't that good at either it's because they're

[10:17] pride because they associate the fact that they're good at it and then they stop learning because they

[10:22] think they are good because of their ego and so that's actually what the fourth and most going to be

[10:27] because I know she said sales so I think that the fourth habit is absolute responsibility for all

[10:33] situations it's absolute ownership of your life if anything happens at any time in my relationship

[10:41] with Leyla with my relationship with an employee with my relationship with the marketplace whatever it is

[10:47] you have to school yourself and literally beat the victim out of yourself like you have to like

[10:52] you've to drag it and beat the crap out of until it has no strength in your life saying like

[10:57] I'm going to blame my circumstances I'm going to blame my past I'm going to blame my upbringing

[11:01] and I'm going to blame my spouse I'm going to blame my employees whatever it is it does not move

[11:05] you forward if you point the finger anywhere but yourself because then it literally gives the power

[11:09] away to to where you're pointing your finger you're saying I want the power to be away from me

[11:16] like I want the power to be away from me and then I'm talking to my clients too like if you

[11:19] ever blame Jim watch and like I will take complete an extreme ownership over all of your situations

[11:24] because that is my job but if you want to grow as an entrepreneur you should take extreme ownership

[11:29] and put nothing on our business and I'm talking to you like person to person right like I will always

[11:34] try and over deliver always but the point is is like if we're talking about like my four highest

[11:37] ROI habits first one is waking up super early so that I can have time to dedicate to big

[11:42] Domino's the second one so that I can have consistency in my life and weekdays and weekends

[11:46] with the same to me so waking up and going about the same time so that I've consistency in the

[11:51] most basic way the third I totally forgot what it was but it was I think it was good and then the

[11:57] fourth is absolutely oh yeah giving first without any any feelings of reciprocity and then the fourth

[12:05] is absolute ownership and I think that of all the habits that that I've had to learn in my life

[12:10] because each one of those was learned like I was not an early riser I did for a very long time

[12:16] like having different weekend schedules and weekdays schedules from like a sleeping standpoint

[12:21] etc to be fair of all of these I think the one that that came most nationally to me was the third

[12:26] one just to get me first and I think that come honestly from a place of insecurities like I

[12:30] wanted to remember like me and so like if I get into a new group and you're not working group like

[12:35] I spend a lot of time typically asking people what they're struggling with and like what skills I

[12:42] have that match up with their deficits and then doing everything I can to over deliver to them

[12:46] and like like treat them as though they paid me to help them and then they're like do this

[12:51] guys amazing and then then I feel like my anxiety goes down inside of my ever group so that might just

[12:57] be a big thing but it has been something that has I've been able to drive a lot of value from

[13:03] a monetary standpoint later on in my life by being able to call on people who I had time favors to

[13:09] pets and then the fourth is literally never giving anyone power over your situation by saying

[13:15] it's anyone's fault by your own and I will leave with I've said this before but one of my favorite

[13:20] quotes is that we are all self made only millionaires and billionaires open and so like

[13:29] everyone's like he's a self made millionaires a self made billionaire it's like that person's a

[13:33] self made homeless person that person's a self made average person like but they don't own that

[13:39] and there's a reason for it no one says it because the type of person who's going to say that

[13:42] their self made is going to have the habits and the outlooks that is going to achieve the things

[13:47] they want and so I will leave you with that as my four highest ROI habits if you have a manager or

[13:56] trainer or a partner or whatever I would highly highly recommend especially the first two

[14:01] they're the easiest things in the world to do get your bio-block like regular like you show up as

[14:07] a leader better you have more energy you have more focus people like you get so much stuff done

[14:11] is like is it not fucking exhausted at the time but I like excuse me like I'm just not tired

[14:16] you know what I mean it's so I can like work and get things done that are productive and effective

[14:20] uses at time because I'm just not exhausted and so like imagine if you like felt good all the time

[14:26] like you can do that it just comes from consistently going to bed at the same time

[14:30] Dr. Kashi I will say a one word like Dr. Kashi jokes that sick is a my PhD buddy who made

[14:37] off prestigious labs and is a nutrition genius PhD by 21 about a community blah blah blah

[14:42] anyways he's like people just people just pay me to tell them to do things that they should

[14:49] already know how to do he's like I tell them to not eat like an asshole and I tell them to act

[14:54] like an adult and go to bed on time they're like man like how do I have more energy if I don't

[15:00] like I'm taking all these things and they're not working he's like why don't you try sleepy

[15:05] and then people sleep and then they get like like oh my god this changed my life it's like yeah

[15:10] I'm like amazing it's like so I tell them to like eat consistently every day the same thing

[15:18] just you consistently I don't even tell them what to eat and then all of a sudden they start getting

[15:21] out because they're just consistent with something right doesn't matter what you're consistent with

[15:25] half time being consistent is in and of itself something that most humans can't do so um I hope

[15:31] this provided value to you I said this on the Instagram posted in I kind of like it

[15:36] major desire to be greater than your obstacles so last level one of them is have an amazing day

[15:41] and you crush your goals try out some of those habits try out some of the 7s I think that they

[15:46] are very high moral I have it's and I think that if you do them you're life-living proof so

[15:50] amazing day get you soon

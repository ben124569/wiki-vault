[00:00] Chick-fil-A makes more money than McDonald's, Starbucks, and Subway.

[00:04] I'm buying, and their first day in business, they made $50.

[00:09] And today they make over five people.

[00:12] I love Chick-fil-A.

[00:15] I love their sandwiches, I love their desserts, I love their milkshakes, I love their waffle fries,

[00:19] I love their sauces, I love their tenders, but what I love even more than that is their business.

[00:24] Because there are lessons that all of this can take in terms of how they do business,

[00:28] not what they talk about socially, but the actual business of running a business and how you

[00:33] go from $50 to $5 billion, and I can promise you it's not by doing what everyone else does.

[00:37] And they did that without raising tons of debt, they did it over 76 years.

[00:42] They did it after the founder died and have continued to grow, and they never had a down year

[00:48] where they went down in sales for 76 straight years.

[00:51] They sell one quarter of the amount of items of any other franchise.

[00:56] Subway has seven and a half percent net margins.

[00:59] Their royalty alone is 15% of top line, meaning their stores are running 20, 30 plus percent

[01:05] margins in brick and mortar food.

[01:07] And they do that being open.

[01:09] Only six days a week having 52 days a week that they are closed, unlike any other franchise.

[01:14] No franchise, you can own more than one location, unlike any other store.

[01:19] They get 60,000 applications a year, and they only award less than 1% of those people

[01:24] a store, and they do with arguably a very controversial social setting that would never

[01:29] work in a publicly traded corporate company that has to massage its PR.

[01:33] So here are the lessons that I take away from Chick-fil-A that I've tried to apply it

[01:37] as many different places in the portfolio companies that we own and even just add acquisition

[01:40] not comment the whole company.

[01:42] Number one is that they sold chicken sandwiches for 76 straight years and I don't think

[01:45] they're going to stop.

[01:46] Having singular focus on the core products and not getting cute and not getting fancy

[01:51] and not having 49 menu items, but just saying, what are the things that the

[01:54] most people want and how do I get better and better and better at doing those things?

[01:59] Because better gives you leverage.

[02:00] It means the same input gets you more output.

[02:02] Rather than having lots of different things they have to put input in, you just put more

[02:05] and more and more because you only have so much huge.

[02:07] If you had two items, you can only split sets them half as much as you can want.

[02:10] For example, if you think about this like an Olympic runner, the difference between first

[02:14] place and fourth place in the Olympics is a tenth of a second.

[02:17] But the difference between first and fourth for a person's life, massively different.

[02:22] We get these outsized returns by making these marginal improvements of being better

[02:26] rather than being new despite our entrepreneurial desire to have not a chicken sandwich.

[02:30] We're like, what about taco?

[02:33] What about burgers?

[02:34] Right?

[02:35] How many times could they have done something like that but they did it because they knew

[02:37] that they wanted to stick to the essential few and they knew that focus is what was

[02:40] going to compound it a long time.

[02:42] Despite being publicly criticized for not taking on debt and not trying to grow faster,

[02:47] we were talking five, six, seven, eight years having somebody beat him, Boston Market,

[02:51] a member of Boston Market when they had their rotisserie chickens and the mac and cheese on

[02:56] stuff.

[02:57] They took on a ton of debt, grew super, super fast and then imploded.

[03:00] Boston Market shut up and then shut down because he wasn't thinking on a five or a 10-year

[03:04] time-resistant.

[03:05] The extra coffee was literally sold chicken sandwiches and the time he was 25 to the

[03:08] day he died.

[03:09] He was a missionary, not a mercenary.

[03:10] He wasn't doing it to brag about his ego.

[03:12] He was doing it because he believed that this way of doing business was what he wanted to represent.

[03:16] I know that the likelihood that my competitors are going to be here in 70 years is almost

[03:20] zero.

[03:21] So if I build in a way that I'm going to be here in 70 years, I will win by default.

[03:27] And I think that's powerful because so many people want to say they're number one.

[03:30] The question is when, you look at the richest man in the world, I want to be the richest

[03:33] man in the world.

[03:34] You got to respond to somebody's answer with.

[03:36] For how long?

[03:39] Because eventually you die.

[03:40] What are we aiming towards?

[03:41] For him, he wanted to build an amazing chicken franchise.

[03:44] His legacy outlasted his life.

[03:46] And for me, that's my dream.

[03:47] My hope is that whatever we build can continue and not only just stay alive but grow beyond

[03:52] us.

[03:53] And that you can only do through a mission, not through a mercenary cause.

[03:56] Because if you're just chasing the money, people get deluded out because there's always a

[03:59] shiny, easy win that distracts from the core items.

[04:03] The fact that they don't let anyone have more than one store.

[04:07] I think there's a lot of wisdom to this.

[04:09] So there are lots of people like, let me open a hundred.

[04:11] They're like, no, because you're not going to be able to focus.

[04:14] We want someone to put their heart in their soul into their location and treat it like

[04:18] his throne.

[04:19] While he was alive, you have to have to have a work to the Chick-fil-I.

[04:21] I think they loosen that up because he wanted to create a way for people to come in,

[04:24] mop and floors, flip and burgers going all the way up and then eventually own their own

[04:27] franchise.

[04:28] He has profit check.

[04:29] Now, mind you, it doesn't share the whole profit.

[04:31] But after he takes his pieces off, they have an ability to make more money.

[04:34] And having that kind of, I'll say, uncapped, earning potential for somebody is very inspiring.

[04:40] But he keeps it constrained to a singular focus.

[04:42] Because they know that somebody can give it their all at one location.

[04:45] They've already tested that.

[04:46] They've learned over the years.

[04:47] And I think there's a lot of wisdom in that that we can take for our businesses.

[04:49] Number four, saying no one Sundays means that you have to say no to things that are obviously

[04:54] going to make you money, but we'll detract from your values.

[04:57] And so there are lots of opportunities in entrepreneurship.

[04:59] And you probably have someone in your docket right now that you're like, I don't know,

[05:02] this is a little left of center, but like, it's such an easy win.

[05:05] Imagine the new CEO comes in to Chick-fil-I tomorrow and says, you know what?

[05:08] I found a way to make us 13% more sales and have most of that dropped bottom line.

[05:12] They're like, what's your amazing idea?

[05:13] And he's like, we're going to be open.

[05:15] Also on Sunday, it would be such an easy play in a match.

[05:18] And now hard it is to say no because in the beginning, he had to say no to an extra 13%

[05:22] on a million dollars to make some other 130,000.

[05:25] But when 13% is 650 million dollars and you still say no, means that you're appealing

[05:32] to a higher power, something above the money.

[05:35] Values matter more than just about anything in my opinion.

[05:38] If they are true to the founder, true to the business and they operate in that way.

[05:42] And I would say that Chick-fil-I is a great example of a type of company that believes

[05:44] in its values, through and through and they practice what they preach, pun intended.

[05:48] Now, I also believe that appealing is something above the money, long long makes you more

[05:53] money.

[05:54] But you have to say no in the short to get the long yes.

[05:57] One of the things that permeates any Chick-fil-I, if you've ever been there, is that

[06:01] they have a culture of service.

[06:02] You're one of the way from an awesome lunch meal.

[06:04] It'll be a pleasure.

[06:05] You add a drive, they wonder after two more things, you know what that is.

[06:08] Just on each of you guys are awesome.

[06:09] One and two.

[06:10] And then all of them.

[06:11] All right, thank you.

[06:12] Thank you.

[06:13] And so what they did was they actually study the hospitality industry and even hire people

[06:16] from Ritz Carlton to help them create an exquisite experience at Chick-fil-I.

[06:22] Esther Kathy noted that what he wanted everybody in his team and his companies are saying

[06:25] my pleasure, it didn't change until he changed how he spoke.

[06:30] He's trained all of us to always respond to thank you by saying my pleasure.

[06:36] So somebody wants a refill, my pleasure.

[06:39] People will learn 10 times more from watching what you do than listening to what you say.

[06:44] And so if you say, hey, we're all about being on time here, but you, the CEO or late,

[06:48] it will never work.

[06:49] We have to pick the very few values that we know that we will never break, that we will

[06:54] always stick with, which is why values have to be true to you, not nice words in the

[06:58] wall, because they have to be things that you would actually live otherwise they're

[07:00] meaningless.

[07:01] If you want to have a business that grows even longer and bigger, you want to have a

[07:07] compounding vehicle built within the business.

[07:10] Chick-fil-I has a company vehicle of capital within their business.

[07:13] Whenever a store creates money, they have the cash and they can pick the next location,

[07:17] they buy the land and they buy everything itself too.

[07:20] So they get the highest return and they get some tax benefits.

[07:23] And so if there's ever areas in the business that we can get some kind of compounding effect

[07:27] where money compounds on itself, that is something that I always try and build in every

[07:31] business that I have.

[07:32] Is how can I get this money that I'm getting today to make me even more tomorrow

[07:36] within the structure of the business, not taking the money out and putting it in his

[07:40] stocks or putting it into just like a random fund or whatever it is.

[07:43] But actually, saying within my business where I have active control, where I get the highest

[07:47] returns based on my skill and my competitive advantages, I get higher returns and that's how

[07:51] these guys build crazy wealth that beats the market.

[07:55] Ruthless prioritization on the essential few items that they need to sell.

[07:59] The fact that they haven't changed their menu in decades should be a testament to the fact

[08:03] that we as entrepreneurs want to change it all the time.

[08:06] There's a Henry Ford story that I think drives his home.

[08:08] He was looking at a marketing campaign and he had been working on it with his executives,

[08:12] et cetera.

[08:13] Three or four months in, he walked past his marketing CMOS office and was like, hey,

[08:16] he's going to stop running that at it.

[08:18] He's like, I'm so tired of it.

[08:19] And the marketing is after looked up to him and he was like, you haven't even ran it yet.

[08:23] And so the thing is is that we have all these things that happen on my mind because we're

[08:26] always iterating like we assume everyone knows everything about our products.

[08:28] We assume everyone's already bored of it because they're talking about chicken sandwiches

[08:31] 24 hours a day.

[08:32] But real is that most people might get chicken for like once a month, right?

[08:35] As a treat.

[08:36] The customers perception when we change something slowly in our mind every six months

[08:40] as a small business to a customer, it just feels like it's constantly changing.

[08:44] There's no consistency.

[08:45] People value consistency.

[08:46] People want to know that when they exchange money, they're going to get the thing that

[08:49] they like the last time.

[08:50] And if you make the same thing the same way over and over again, it also gives you the

[08:54] opportunity to improve it.

[08:55] If you have to improve a hundred things, it's a hell of a lot harder than improving too.

[08:59] Or improving one.

[09:01] And so you've heard me say one product, one avatar, one channel for anybody who's trying

[09:03] to make their first million.

[09:05] Each one of these stores, if you think about them as a single business, like that's how they're

[09:08] thinking.

[09:09] Now, do they have drinks, yes, et cetera, the principle behind it compared to everyone

[09:13] else the marketplace.

[09:14] They have a quarter of the amount of things on their menu compared to McDonald's and

[09:17] they make twice the money.

[09:18] They have such a refined menu because it makes the order process have fewer mistakes

[09:22] in it.

[09:23] It makes the drive-through process happen faster.

[09:25] They're able to have less food go bad because they don't have to have all these

[09:28] extraneous options.

[09:30] They follow predispensable of 80, 20.

[09:31] They know that 20% of their stuff creates 80% of their sales.

[09:35] They have all of these efficiencies in there because they're not trying to be cute.

[09:38] They're trying to be the best at a handful of things.

[09:40] And by doing that, they've been able to sell way more than anyone else does with a way more

[09:44] constrained menu and do it so much more profitably.

[09:48] There's wisdom there.

[09:49] And so I try to think about that as like, okay, even though I could do those things,

[09:53] should I?

[09:54] And most times the answer's no, I should just get better at the thing that's in front of me

[09:57] and confront the problem that I have, which is how can I sell more chicken sandwiches,

[10:01] whatever your chicken sandwich is.

[10:03] And to drive even further on the focus they have, even at a micro level within their

[10:07] core product, the chicken sandwich.

[10:10] If you compare that to McDonald's Big Mac or Burger King's Wapur, McDonald's Big

[10:15] Mac, McDonald's Big Mac has six ingredients.

[10:17] The Wapur has seven not including the bun.

[10:20] Now compare that to Chick-fil-A's sandwich, which just has butter, pickles, and chicken.

[10:25] That's it.

[10:26] They even have half the ingredients on their one-quarter sized menu because even then

[10:31] they get more efficiencies at the ingredient level, they make it faster and easier to

[10:35] prepare so it's more consistent and they're able to do that with greater economies of

[10:38] scale and they can make the process itself leaner and faster and leaner and faster.

[10:42] And then you do that for 76 years and become a vehicle.

[10:45] So one of the things that when they were asked why are you so limited in your selection

[10:49] besides all the reasons I already gave, their response was that every time they add in

[10:52] another item, they just saw their sales of their main thing to client.

[10:55] So they're just splitting some sales off the thing they're core products.

[10:59] And to how many of us have opened a new thing, God people to switch from the old thing

[11:03] to the new thing and now you're doing two different things for the same amount of money.

[11:07] Sound familiar?

[11:08] Happens all the time.

[11:09] And so it takes the discipline to say no and say we're just going to get better.

[11:13] The last piece that makes them exceptional, I think there's their VP of growth who

[11:16] was talking about this.

[11:17] He said 80% of what fast food restaurants do between each other is the same.

[11:21] But I wasn't hired here to do the same thing for the other 80% are doing.

[11:25] I'm hired to do what the 20% are not doing.

[11:29] That much more efficiency has been driven into how can we improve this business because

[11:32] if we change nothing about this business, we sell the same 12 items, you just get better

[11:37] and better and better at the same thing.

[11:39] If you even do practice runs in an indoor arena for the drive through to test in rural

[11:43] world scenarios to see how they can make the drive through more efficient and increase the

[11:46] accuracy, that's the level of detail that the king pins can do because they've been doing

[11:50] it for 70 plus years.

[11:53] The biggest takeaway is I see from the big companies that I try to apply to my businesses.

[11:56] What is a business that I could be in for a hundred years?

[11:59] I believe that if you only try and solve the same problem for a hundred years, you could

[12:02] pretty darn good at solving it.

[12:04] That's where Kathy lived that and then he technically even died that.

[12:08] He took one concept and she can say it which.

[12:11] And thought, how can I just do this one thing that everyone understands better than anyone

[12:16] else?

[12:17] And he built an empire and he built a mission behind it that I think millions of people

[12:21] are happy and frequent every day.

[12:23] He is edge-to-is-way to now being number three and likely will become the second biggest

[12:27] food chain in the entire United States.

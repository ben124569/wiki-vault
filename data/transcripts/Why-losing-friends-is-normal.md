[00:00] A lot of people have heard the term your network is your net worth.

[00:03] To a degree that's true.

[00:05] To the other, degree that's the average of the five people who you spend the most time with.

[00:09] Well, it's not true for Bill Gates and for Jeff Bezos because the people that they spend time with

[00:13] are less than their net worth, which should mean that their net worth would be less than that.

[00:16] And so, you know, there are statements that are thrown around frequently that don't have necessarily a lot of

[00:20] evidence, but you know, are, I would say, spiritually correct.

[00:23] And so, what I want to talk about today and for this you don't know me, my name is Oxermosi.

[00:27] I own acquisition.com.

[00:28] It's a portfolio of companies that says, over $100 a year, make these videos because I just love getting

[00:33] troll comments about being in my mom's basement.

[00:35] This is not, this is actually just a closet because I just like having no windows and I wear the things

[00:40] that I'm comfortable in.

[00:41] That being said, in the last year, I would say that I fell out of touch with the last two

[00:47] friends that I had from high school and or college.

[00:50] And this has been a process that's happened, you know, gradually over time.

[00:53] And I was having a conversation with Dean Graciosi who has become a very, very close friend of mine.

[00:59] And I brought the topic up with him and I thought the discussion would be worth sharing.

[01:03] And so, one of the things that he told me early on in our relationship, which really,

[01:07] really gave me a lot of pause was the cost of his dreams.

[01:11] And so, I asked him early on and it was about 18 months ago before Layla and I decided to build

[01:16] kind of our personal brands, et cetera, about, you know, the cost of fame.

[01:19] And he said, yeah, you know, I've got people who show up in my house and people who

[01:22] leave weird mean comments and he's like, all the time.

[01:25] The thing is is that that is a price of willing to pay to make the impact that I want to make with my

[01:29] life.

[01:30] When he said that, it just, it really struck me because to me it was in a lot of ways, you know,

[01:35] selfish to kind of not spread the message out of fear of what it would cost me.

[01:39] That being said, there's obviously pros that, you know, you know, we've made whatever decision

[01:43] that they outweigh the cons.

[01:44] But it was just an interesting perspective in terms of just, it is a price that he was willing

[01:48] to pay.

[01:49] So I want to lead this discussion towards the friend conversation that had with him and he

[01:53] had said that he recently had lost one of his last friends, the last friend that he had had

[01:57] from kind of his childhood.

[01:59] And I think that there's a lot of people who are like, you know, never forget where you come from

[02:03] and the people who support you, et cetera.

[02:05] And I think that's true.

[02:06] But I think for the master of the already of us, a lot of people don't support us on our way

[02:09] up, at least it felt that way for me.

[02:11] What's interesting is that a lot of people will root for you until you do better than them

[02:15] and they stop rooting for you.

[02:16] And I'm not saying that the people that I'm talking about were like that, but it's just

[02:19] that was like the first wave of friends that I lost.

[02:22] And it was just because they didn't actually want to see me win.

[02:24] And I had a cool, the other day that went pretty viral on Twitter, which was real friends

[02:29] talk shit to your face and praise you behind your back and fake friends to the opposite.

[02:34] And when I say talk shit, I mean like bullshitting.

[02:36] You know what I mean?

[02:37] Like give you, you know, give you to other flack.

[02:38] If I'm giving someone flack, they know that were homies.

[02:41] You know, Dr. Casio, I was, I was thinking about patencing the homozy advertising cycle.

[02:45] And I spent so long developing the cycle, which is going to be in one of the books that

[02:48] comes up, you know, in the future.

[02:50] And his comment was get over yourself.

[02:52] And that's what I, and that's exactly what I want from a friend, right?

[02:55] I want somebody who's going to say that, rather than be like, oh, that's cool.

[02:57] And then be like, I can't believe this guy.

[02:59] And so we have these people that we collect, you know, throughout our lives and sometimes

[03:05] they come in, you know, you've probably heard the saying they're here for a season or

[03:08] reason or a lifetime.

[03:09] And I think, you know, for me, a lot of people have been seasonal.

[03:14] And so I wanted to share that because I know that, I'm sure some of you have had a similar

[03:19] path to me and that I didn't have a tremendous amount of support from my parents.

[03:22] I think they now retroactively think they supported me because it's much easier that way.

[03:26] But I did not, I did not have any support from my parents for the decisions that I took

[03:30] until it was already beyond obvious that I was going to be successful in that took years.

[03:35] And that was very hard for me at the time.

[03:37] I think friends fell in that same category.

[03:39] And so, you know, it's having this discussion with Dean, we, we dove into this a little

[03:43] bit more.

[03:43] But as we, you know, ascend towards our goals and I don't say ascend in a little sense

[03:48] in terms of like socioeconomic status or whatever, but just like we move closer towards

[03:52] we want to, where we want to go and our vision and our mission and our lives become clear.

[03:56] It also becomes clear when you have contrast with people from your past.

[04:00] And I have several rules of thumb that are, I begin to develop around these relationships.

[04:06] One of them is, if I could only talk about the past with someone, they usually aren't

[04:09] good friends of mine.

[04:11] Because I don't really live in the past.

[04:13] I live in the future.

[04:14] I live in where I want to go, what I want to do, the things that I find interesting, where

[04:18] the present of the things that I find interesting today are right now, top of mind.

[04:21] And if I can't talk about those things with somebody, then our friendship kind of bites

[04:24] very nature will decline over time because there is no growth, right?

[04:28] Because it's only in the past.

[04:29] And I have felt a tremendous amount of guilt around the loss of those relationships.

[04:34] But I also felt a guilt of carrying them on.

[04:37] Because then I felt like I needed to water these plants out of necessity rather than out of,

[04:41] some sort of exchange.

[04:42] Now, some people might decry that or speak against the idea of having an exchange.

[04:47] But I don't think that's realistic.

[04:48] I think that people stay in relationships because there is an exchange of value that occurs.

[04:53] Now, I think the difference is the strength or depth of the relationship is how long you

[04:57] are willing to wait for the exchange to occur.

[05:00] So a parent, for example, is willing to wait a very long time for a positive exchange

[05:04] from a child coming back to them.

[05:06] Now, some people can make the argument that children are a gift throughout that entire

[05:09] period of time.

[05:10] And that's awesome.

[05:11] But just to use the time frame as a nice thinking process, if you just met someone,

[05:15] if you don't feel like there's a huge benefit to knowing them within the immediate future,

[05:21] you probably don't really pursue them out.

[05:24] And the longer you have had positive exchanges, the longer you are willing to wait for the next one.

[05:28] It's intermittent reinforcement from a behavior standpoint, right?

[05:32] That we are literally reinforced in this relationship.

[05:35] And the way that addiction works is the same thing, right?

[05:37] Like you immediately get positive hits and then you can start extending how long before you

[05:41] get another positive hit, which is also how abusive relationships work, right?

[05:45] Like abuse positive abuse positive, positive positive positive positive and then like abuse and

[05:49] then positives a little bit later and then a little bit later until the point where there's

[05:51] almost no positive whatsoever.

[05:53] I'm not saying that's how you should run relationships, but more so how we work as humans.

[05:58] The point of me breaking the stone is that I have lost a lot of the friends, or almost

[06:03] all of the friends that I had when I started my journey.

[06:06] And the upside is people will come into your life to fill the vacuum that the other people

[06:12] left.

[06:13] But sometimes it doesn't happen immediately.

[06:14] And I think getting comfortable with having space is a good thing.

[06:18] And a lot of people have the impulse or urge to always have people around them and I think

[06:22] it's to their own detriment.

[06:24] Because I think if you can spend time alone with your thoughts and be okay with just being

[06:27] you without other people, then you are more selective and it's the same way with dating.

[06:32] Some people can't be alone.

[06:33] Some people can't be without a significant other.

[06:36] And so they just end up checking up with the first person they see after they become

[06:39] single again.

[06:40] And it's because they have a fear of being alone more than they hold a, they have an

[06:45] aligned mission with someone that they think that this person is really the best pick.

[06:48] And so a lot of ways are similar to dating with friends in that we can hold out and

[06:54] really just pick the best people.

[06:55] And I think that if we, at least for me, if I have two or three good friends, I'm more

[07:01] than satisfied my cup is very full.

[07:03] But I think what I feel drained is when I feel like I have lots and lots and lots of

[07:06] acquaintances that are transactional in nature, but purely transactional or at least they

[07:11] have a much shorter time horizon for the transactions to occur.

[07:14] And so I sell this to say, if you have lost friends during the process of the climb, I

[07:19] don't think it is something that you should lament or be upset about.

[07:23] I think that it is a sign of growth because a lot of people say, hey, you've changed.

[07:29] And the only natural response that I can have to that is you have it.

[07:33] And I think that that's kind of sums up the entirety of this video, which is if you grow,

[07:39] you change.

[07:40] Some people, most people, don't like change, especially if they themselves have not grown

[07:45] or changed.

[07:46] And or if they have grown in a different direction for me.

[07:49] And it is natural for us to not want to continue relationships with people that have

[07:54] grown or have values that are too far in contrast to our own.

[07:58] And those are those values can change over time.

[08:01] And that's okay.

[08:02] And so I think that for me, it took me a really long time to navigate through this.

[08:07] And it was kind of an emotionally explorative experience to just say, that's okay.

[08:13] And is this price something that I'm willing to pay?

[08:16] And for me, it's a resounding yes.

[08:18] I would be far more sad that I had not realized my potential or what I hope to accomplish

[08:25] in my life and exchange for relationships that I sacrificed in order, sacrifice my dreams

[08:33] in order to maintain.

[08:34] Now, that being said, it almost appears as though I'm sacrificing our relationships in order

[08:38] to have the dream.

[08:39] And that's not what I'm saying.

[08:40] I'm saying that you will sacrifice older relationships and you will create room for

[08:43] new ones.

[08:44] And so I think that there's this, I don't know, old lifestyle or a societal expectation

[08:48] that if someone sheds friends for lack of a better term or loses friends or friends,

[08:53] you know, dissipate into the distance over time, that they are a non-constant person.

[08:58] And I think that the answer to that question is yes, we grow.

[09:02] And unless the friends you have are growing with you and are pushing you to grow, then

[09:05] they are probably not friends who will stay with you for the long call.

[09:08] And so for me, I will leave with this kind of lasting that I think about for the people

[09:13] that I want to be friends with.

[09:15] I want friends who root for me behind my back.

[09:19] And that is rare.

[09:21] Most people do not root for you behind your back.

[09:22] It is sad that there are more strangers on the internet who root for me than people who

[09:26] knew me from back home.

[09:27] And it's because we had a shared context at home and the discrepancy between where you are

[09:32] and where they are, over time, they personalize the fact that they are not with you because

[09:37] they had the same resources at the same beginning.

[09:39] And so you're in a different place as a result of your own decisions.

[09:41] And so as a result, they feel bad.

[09:44] And they don't like that.

[09:44] And you're a reminder of that.

[09:46] What I seek from the friends that I have are one that they genuinely are rooting for

[09:51] me.

[09:52] And that is evidence by them rooting for me behind my back.

[09:54] I also hope that they talk shit to my face because that is what makes life worth

[09:57] living for me.

[09:59] But I hope to admire them.

[10:02] I want to strive to be more like my friends in certain ways.

[10:07] And I hope that they raise the bar for me to be better.

[10:10] And be better in the ways that I want to be better.

[10:13] And so in that way, picking friends who are people who are further ahead of you

[10:18] doesn't have to be financially, it can be, it can be in marriage, it can be physically,

[10:22] it can be whatever.

[10:23] And then the hope is that you are better in some ways than they are.

[10:26] And then they can grow from you in that way.

[10:28] And in that way, you both get better.

[10:30] And then you have an extended exchange that continues

[10:34] directionally towards both of your goals.

[10:36] My definitions and my view on friendship has changed over time.

[10:40] It probably will continue to develop and refine.

[10:42] But I made this because I have a lot of people who message me and are like,

[10:45] hey, I feel really alone right now.

[10:47] I don't feel like a lot of people are supporting me.

[10:49] And I make this fit to say, that's okay.

[10:51] And I think that there are seasons.

[10:53] And at the end of a season, when you have a vacuum,

[10:56] someone does step into fill it.

[10:57] And I can promise you that if you have a higher standard and you wait,

[11:00] and you don't just give up yourself for no reason just because you are afraid to be alone

[11:04] or be without friends, you will end up with better friends who actually root for you.

[11:08] And are not just place fillers or false friends who, you know,

[11:12] smile to your face, but stab you behind your back or actually talk down on you.

[11:15] And so I think if you can have that bar and you can have that tolerance,

[11:18] you can give yourself that space and that permission to say,

[11:20] I lost a friend.

[11:21] And that's okay.

[11:22] And I still love them as a human.

[11:24] Even if I can't give the time that I once did because it doesn't make sense for

[11:28] anymore because we've grown apart.

[11:29] And that's okay.

[11:30] And so I've given myself that permission to say,

[11:32] these are the prices that I'm willing to pay to grow into the person that I want to be.

[11:36] And that's okay.

[11:37] And so, most of the nation, I love you all.

[11:39] The road can be can be arduous, but I think the road itself is the reason we do it

[11:43] because of the person that we hope to become.

[11:45] And the process of becoming, which is the success I've defined it,

[11:50] is the process of becoming and the process of striving is the success.

[11:54] And so anyways, my friends, keeping awesome.

[11:57] I love you all.

[11:57] I'll see you guys in the next video.

[11:58] Bye!

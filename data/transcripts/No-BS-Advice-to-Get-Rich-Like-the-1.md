[00:00] Across $100 million in that worth at age 31 from 35,

[00:03] significantly higher than that now.

[00:04] And I have the privilege of talking to lots of people who are at

[00:08] billion dollar plus. And so in this video, I want to break down.

[00:10] I handful of themes that I've seen repeated that can make you significantly more successful.

[00:14] The rich by time, the poor by stuff,

[00:17] ambitious people by skills and lazy people by distractions.

[00:22] As much as these seem like four different groups,

[00:25] it's really like you have these pairings.

[00:27] Rich people use money to buy time,

[00:30] ambitious people use time to buy skills.

[00:32] And the reason it's ambitious people is because generational wealth

[00:36] isn't transferred through assets.

[00:38] It's not transferred through stuff.

[00:39] It's transferred through education.

[00:41] It's transferred through skills.

[00:43] And so there's the Sanskrit proverb that I love.

[00:45] If you have a good son,

[00:47] you don't need you accumulate wealth.

[00:48] If you have a bad son, there's no point in accumulating wealth.

[00:51] And so the idea that you're going to pass on your wealth

[00:54] to a child who doesn't have the skills makes it a relevant.

[00:58] Because fundamentally, either it is a good son who has skills.

[01:02] And then if the son has skills, then whether you transfer the wealth or not,

[01:06] makes the wealth itself a relevant.

[01:08] And I find that there's so many things that are like this in wealth creation

[01:10] that you don't understand until you're on the other side of it.

[01:13] Because the answers that you're looking for are not in your newsfeed.

[01:16] They are not in the distraction.

[01:18] And so the vast majority of lazy people that I have encountered

[01:21] continue to distract themselves because the difficulty of looking at themselves in the mirror

[01:27] and saying, I am inadequate is too painful.

[01:30] And so instead they would rather watch fluff videos on the internet

[01:34] that make them feel good and tickle their ears rather than confront reality.

[01:39] That they are just not good enough.

[01:41] And so they consume the stuff that's like, I am worthy.

[01:43] I deserve these things.

[01:45] In other words, entitled to them.

[01:47] Which, by the way, if you feel entitled to something,

[01:49] then when you get it, you are never grateful because you thought you deserved it to begin with.

[01:53] We know that gratitude, for example, is something that increases your subjective well-being

[01:57] in life, which is that you enjoy life more when you are good for what you get.

[02:00] Which means that you have to buy very definition, expect nothing,

[02:04] which means you're entitled to nothing, which means that you deserve nothing

[02:08] in reality you are worthy only of the things that you currently have because you have already

[02:12] got them.

[02:13] You have proven that you kid work in minimum wage jobs, so you were worthy of the conversation

[02:17] of minimum wage.

[02:18] And as much as this is painful, I'm sure those will get clipped 100 times to show me some evil

[02:22] rich guy.

[02:23] I'm willing to take that hate for the few people who will hear this message and decide to change

[02:27] the way they act.

[02:28] You can be ambitious and distracted, which keeps you poor.

[02:33] When I started out at my peak, I had nine businesses because I heard seven income streams

[02:38] make you wealthy, but it does it.

[02:40] Seven income streams just spread you seven ways.

[02:43] And I had nine, I was like, well, seven good, I must be better.

[02:45] To give you context, I had a car practical agency, I had a dental agency, I had a gym

[02:49] turnaround business, and then I had at the time six locations, so there's nine where it is.

[02:53] And I had partners in each of these businesses.

[02:56] I was still the one who was required to rein make, meaning I was the one who was required

[03:01] to sell customers into online.

[03:03] If you are required to work inside of the business, then you can only really do one job.

[03:07] And so when people hear that someone has seven income streams, it's because they own assets

[03:12] that generate that kind of income.

[03:13] But in order to gain the cash to then buy the assets, that create the cash.

[03:18] Well, it requires time and focus.

[03:20] Let me make focus real for you.

[03:21] Focus is a very amorphous term.

[03:23] Focus is measured by the amount of things you say no to.

[03:27] And inversely, you could measure it by how few things you say yes to.

[03:31] Meaning the most focused person says only yes to one thing and says no to literally everything

[03:37] else.

[03:38] And so the next thing that separates the rich from the poor is it's a hundred X, not two

[03:42] X.

[03:43] And so this concept is one that I had dinner with a friend of mine who is a public

[03:47] CEO and I asked him what he had done to grow the business.

[03:51] I think from a two hundred million dollar market gap to a one point two billion dollar

[03:54] market gap in less than two years.

[03:56] All right, so that's absurd growth for company.

[03:59] I was like, so what are you doing primarily?

[04:01] He said I'm shaking hands, I'm kissing babies, I'm going to events all the time and

[04:05] I was like, well how many?

[04:06] He's like, well, I'm going to do 66 events this quarter.

[04:09] And I was like in person.

[04:10] He was like, yeah, I was like, they coming to you and he's like, no, we're going to

[04:13] them.

[04:14] I want to make this real.

[04:15] He has a wife.

[04:16] He has kids.

[04:17] And before anyone listens and says, I can't believe it.

[04:19] Well, cool, he makes trades.

[04:21] If anything, I would hope that people watch this and say, I wouldn't make that trade in

[04:25] which case great.

[04:26] Also, don't complain about not having what somebody who has made that trade made.

[04:30] And so one of the big misconceptions, by the way, this is a sales thing too, is that people

[04:34] want your outcome their way.

[04:36] They want to have their cake and eat it too.

[04:38] They want to say, hey, I want to not change the way I'm eating.

[04:40] I want to not change the way I'm living, but I want to have a six pack and I want

[04:43] to be in shape.

[04:44] I want to continue to live this way and I want to get the 10 check or the 10 guy.

[04:47] I want to continue with my work life schedule as I currently have, but I want to have

[04:52] hyper growth.

[04:53] They are trades, they're price tags.

[04:54] When you go to the store, you either want the shoes and you're willing to pay the

[04:57] price or not willing to pay the price.

[04:59] That's it.

[05:00] You can't pick the price for the shoes.

[05:01] You pay to your don't.

[05:02] My telephone back to myself is that I thought I worked a lot when I was younger.

[05:08] And I did spend a lot of time working, but I made so little progress because a lot of

[05:15] that time I wasn't actually creating output.

[05:19] I encourage people to do something called the 12 by 30.

[05:22] It's very simple and it's actually not as unsustainable as people would think.

[05:25] You work 12 hours a day for 30 days straight, no weekends.

[05:28] By the last day, you realize one, you aren't made of glass.

[05:32] Two, how much more you could be working?

[05:35] Three, how much faster you could be achieving your goals?

[05:38] Four, how much you could be getting better every single day?

[05:42] Five, you don't need to work like this forever.

[05:45] But if you need to do it for a season or for a reason sometime in the future, you've

[05:49] got that gear in you.

[05:50] And six, there are people who are working more than you who are beating you.

[05:54] And you get all of those lessons for the low price of getting more done in a month than

[05:58] you probably did last quarter.

[05:59] And so everyone had, and like, of course, you've got one side of people who are like,

[06:02] I work more than this now.

[06:03] And of course, they do.

[06:04] They obviously go.

[06:05] And the thing is, is that people are like, why work like that?

[06:08] But I take a couple days off, right?

[06:09] That's the point is that you have to push through it.

[06:11] Now, can you work 16 by 30?

[06:13] Sure.

[06:13] If you want to, you're welcome to work more than that.

[06:15] Because I've found that working 6 to 6 is kind of like what I do every day.

[06:18] Anyways, I'm on 12 by 100.

[06:19] You know, in terms of how I think about working.

[06:22] There's plenty of days that I work 15, 16 hours a day.

[06:24] Because I get here at 5 or 6.

[06:25] And then sometimes we even event.

[06:26] There's always a dinner, things like that afterwards, and it's a nine.

[06:29] And that's where you have to be on, not just at the office, not just in front of your

[06:32] computer, but people actually demanding things to of you on a regular basis all the time,

[06:35] being on camera.

[06:36] And I'll tell you that there are levels to this.

[06:38] Like working alone for a full day is not as exhausting as being on stage for a full day,

[06:44] being on camera for a full day.

[06:45] Because every second that you are not peak, you're losing.

[06:49] You can take a break while you're working alone.

[06:52] You can't take a break when you're on stage when you're meeting customers, when you're

[06:55] making content.

[06:56] Like, right?

[06:57] Like every minute, minute that is not recorded is basically a minute wasted.

[07:00] There's a whole team here behind this camera, right?

[07:02] That is making this stuff for you.

[07:04] And I'm costing them every second.

[07:05] I'm not showing up.

[07:06] I remember there was a period of season of my life where I think I had like nine straight

[07:11] months of this.

[07:12] And it was not 12.

[07:13] It was 15, 16.

[07:14] Because I had to wake up at 4 to get to the gym where I was after gym.

[07:18] But I wake up at 4.

[07:19] And then I would get the class ready.

[07:21] I'd open the gym doors at 4.

[07:23] 30, which start at the classes at 5.

[07:25] And the last class at night would end.

[07:26] It would be a 7 o'clock class with end to 8.

[07:28] And then at 8, I would then do billing.

[07:30] I'd reach out to all customers, out confirmed lead appointments for the next day.

[07:34] All that sometimes until 10, 11 at night.

[07:36] And then it would wake up again at 4.

[07:37] And so I don't know what the hours are there.

[07:39] But it's more than 12.

[07:40] And I did that for nine months straight.

[07:42] And I used to describe it as the kind of tired, a good night sleep couldn't fix.

[07:45] It was like it was tired.

[07:46] It was deeper than like a one sleep.

[07:49] I needed like weeks to like basically come back to normal.

[07:53] And the thing is that I think it is valuable because you have to learn that you have

[07:57] that gear.

[07:58] I think that that gives you supreme confidence when you're entering any new endeavor

[08:02] because you know that you have acquired the trade of being relentless.

[08:06] You do not relent.

[08:07] You do not let up.

[08:08] You do not stop until you get what you want.

[08:10] And you know that you can push through being tired or being under slapped or being overwhelmed

[08:14] because you realize that you didn't die and that you've done this before.

[08:18] And so the difference between the newbie and the veteran is that the veteran looks on something

[08:21] and looks back on what they have done to get to that point and says, I've seen this

[08:25] before.

[08:26] This is another one of those.

[08:27] Why they don't have the anxiety.

[08:29] That's why they don't have the stress.

[08:30] That's the way they get on stage.

[08:31] They crush it.

[08:32] That's when they the high pressure situation.

[08:33] They still breathe normally.

[08:34] The heartbeat doesn't go up because they have done it before and the only way that you can

[08:37] get to the point where you can say you've done it before is to do it now.

[08:40] And so I define work as volume times leverage.

[08:45] And so it's about how many times you do something and how much you get for each time you do

[08:48] it.

[08:49] In the beginning you need to do a lot more of this.

[08:51] You do way more volume.

[08:53] Because of that volume you gain skill.

[08:55] And then the leverage also increases.

[08:57] And so you get 100x the volume which then over time build skill which then gives you more

[09:02] for what you put in.

[09:03] And then over time that continues to increase your output.

[09:08] The thing is that this concept of 100x not 2x has applied to so many of an areas in my life.

[09:13] Like when I pay a large brand for insight into how I could grow my personal brand when I decided

[09:17] to get into this game.

[09:18] I was like, hey, I'm not growing that fast.

[09:20] And he said, oh, well, pull up your social media profiles.

[09:23] And we pulled them up one by one and he said, look what you're doing and what I'm doing.

[09:26] And he had genuinely been doing 10 times more volume than I was doing.

[09:30] And so he basically said, you're not doing enough volume.

[09:32] I then said, okay, that was clear as day.

[09:34] I need to do more volume.

[09:35] And the thing is, is when we did more volume, we got better at doing it.

[09:38] And so now we continue to do the same volume as I did in the beginning which is 10 times

[09:42] more than when I started, we get even more output.

[09:43] And then I had a different friend who talked to me, billionaire guy, he was thinking about

[09:47] getting into content and he said, hey, I'm really not growing that fast.

[09:49] And I had got to have the exact same conversation with him.

[09:51] The thing is that this guy had done 100x not to x before his life.

[09:54] It was just that he got to realize like me that it has been 100% domain specific.

[09:59] And so when he then, I showed him mine,

[10:01] Instagram and his, I showed him my tech talking his.

[10:03] I showed him my YouTube and his.

[10:05] And I said, dude, I'm making four and a few pieces a week or making seven.

[10:07] And he was like, got it.

[10:08] Like, understood, he immediately got it because he had already learned that lesson in a different

[10:12] domain.

[10:13] I want to own a zoom out for a second.

[10:14] Right now is a period of time where I'm working really hard.

[10:18] I'm working a lot.

[10:19] I'll give you context is what a lot is for me.

[10:21] So this year, the first 100 days of the year I didn't have a day off.

[10:26] And so my time was only spent working.

[10:31] And so it's like, well, what's the difference between when you work, quote, working all the time?

[10:34] And you're younger and working all the time now is that what I get done in a day is significantly

[10:39] greater than what I got done and the quality of that work is also higher.

[10:42] Because the thing is is that you learn how to work.

[10:44] You get better at working the more you do it.

[10:46] And so a lot of people like, man, I feel like I'm not that productive when I work.

[10:49] Like what should I do?

[10:50] It's like work more.

[10:51] Like you work more until you get better at working.

[10:52] I remember when I was a legal intern at a company in France called Arkema, Arkema,

[10:57] Fiona, they say it.

[10:58] And I was a legal intern and I was spending the whole summer there which by the way, they

[11:02] always try and like use interviews.

[11:03] I was like, man, I'm working so hard and I talked to one of these legal partners.

[11:06] And I only had one exchange with this particular legal partners, you know, high up in the

[11:10] firm.

[11:11] And she said, oh, she's like, that's cute.

[11:13] You don't even know what work is.

[11:14] She said, you don't even know how to work.

[11:15] She's like, you spend time here.

[11:16] She's like, but you don't know how to work.

[11:18] I just remember how dismissive what she said was, but I understood, I mean, I understand

[11:24] now, especially what she meant was like, you're spending a lot of time here.

[11:26] But you're not getting anything done.

[11:28] And it takes time.

[11:29] It takes reps to get better at working itself.

[11:31] And so that measure of focus, the equal opposite of distraction is just how long you can

[11:35] stick with it.

[11:36] And I can tell you that me from a very visual perspective, when I work, there are many times

[11:40] like, you know, when you work and you're like, man, I feel like I need a break.

[11:43] The thing is is that that break period for people who aren't as good at working might

[11:47] be like the rest of the day.

[11:48] And the better and better that I've gotten at working is that I can kind of like, with

[11:52] my, like, with my head back in and be like, confront, like, keep going.

[11:56] And I'm like, all right, I'm going to keep going.

[11:59] And then you kind of realize that there's like a five minute, sometimes 15 minute period where,

[12:02] like, your output slows a little bit.

[12:05] But then you catch the next draft and then you're in again.

[12:07] It's being able to whip yourself back in.

[12:09] And that muscle of doing that takes practice and the only opportunity that you get to flex

[12:15] that muscle to practice it is to work yourself to the point of fatigue, to the point

[12:20] or distraction or respite or rest would be beneficial or you feel like it's what you crave

[12:25] right now.

[12:26] And then being able to be like, no, I can power through this.

[12:29] And the thing is is you can, you can power through it.

[12:32] It just takes practice and practices takes repetition.

[12:35] It's being willing to be on comfort for an extended period of time.

[12:37] And it's kind of like, when you're eating in your dieting, there are moments where you

[12:40] get these cravings where you're like, man, I'm starving.

[12:42] I want some big sweet.

[12:43] If you've ever dieted before and this is where repetition's helped, it only lasts like 20 minutes.

[12:47] So if you ever do this by the way, dieting is just set a timer when you're like, man, I really

[12:51] want something.

[12:52] Wait 20.

[12:53] And if you still want it, which you rarely do, because it usually lasts less than 20,

[12:56] sometimes it's just five.

[12:57] It'll just go away.

[12:58] And the same thing happens with focus, but we then just take off for our diet for the

[13:02] day.

[13:03] We order a pizza, right?

[13:04] We order ice cream, right?

[13:05] Or we take off working for the day.

[13:07] Right?

[13:08] And we just say, I'm just going to watch Netflix for the rest of the time.

[13:09] I'm just going to go, hang out with friends, whatever.

[13:12] We're going to go out.

[13:13] But I will say now that I have works for a hundred days straight.

[13:18] And that was in the earlier part of this year.

[13:19] I think this year I've probably taken three or four days off since the year started.

[13:25] And I still probably worked until like two on those days, but I still consider those

[13:29] like more or less days off.

[13:30] You're not going to die.

[13:31] And so I think back retroactively or historically, like, there were people who were

[13:36] forced to work for years on end or they would get killed.

[13:39] Because gruesome is that may seem I see that as hopeful in that they have already demonstrated

[13:45] that it's possible.

[13:46] Like you can work continuously for an extended period of time.

[13:48] Because fundamentally you're just alive, you're moving.

[13:50] Right?

[13:51] And like you think super ancestors, it's like they didn't have computers.

[13:54] They did like they just were around.

[13:55] And so you do keep busy while you're awake.

[13:58] And so you might as well keep busy continuing to nudge things forward.

[14:01] And I can't tell you the amount of times we're now.

[14:03] I'm like my mind checked out.

[14:04] And I was like, my brain checked out a little bit.

[14:07] But I'm just going to keep going.

[14:09] And then three hours, four hours, six hours more past than I'm like, oh, I actually finished

[14:13] everything that I said I was going to do.

[14:16] And it's just so much more work.

[14:18] And it's fewer days off.

[14:20] And it's earlier mornings and longer nights.

[14:22] And it's just being able to do that for an extended period of time.

[14:25] I know the whole idea of like, you know, work on the things you love and never work another

[14:29] day in your life.

[14:30] That's just I just don't think it's true.

[14:31] Like there's so many things that I don't enjoy doing that I have to do.

[14:35] And that's why at least for me, my saying is always I will do what is required.

[14:38] I feel about it as relatively irrelevant because the things that have come from doing

[14:43] what is required have made doing the requirements, something that I know will pay off.

[14:48] And so I kind of like feast on those morsels of past achievements as the fuel to continue

[14:53] doing things that may be uncomfortable or unpleasant in the moment.

[14:56] And most work isn't unpleasant.

[14:58] It's just work.

[14:59] It's like I have to get this done, right?

[15:01] Now you're like, I get to get this done.

[15:03] Sure.

[15:04] But like, I'm just being real for me.

[15:07] It's usually not sunshine and rainbows.

[15:09] Like I work a lot.

[15:10] And I get undimtired.

[15:12] You know, I, I sub 9 hours last night, which was the first time sub 9 hours in a while.

[15:16] And I feel amazing right now.

[15:17] But sometimes you got to work on six.

[15:19] Sometimes you got to work on five.

[15:20] And so think about this hypothetical extreme.

[15:22] Let's say that you played video games.

[15:24] That was all you did.

[15:25] And when I say that's all you did, you didn't go out, you didn't talk to people, you didn't

[15:28] see anyone, you didn't eat, you didn't sleep.

[15:31] But you would be incredibly focused.

[15:32] Now, at that point you said, well, in order for him to play more video games, he needs

[15:36] to sleep.

[15:37] And he needs to be very contentious.

[15:38] Right?

[15:39] You do need to eat or you'll die.

[15:40] And so there are the fewest requirements necessary to maintain consistent focus on the

[15:45] one thing.

[15:46] And those things become requisites for focus rather than distraction.

[15:51] Like there are periods of time where you will need to rest.

[15:53] That rest therefore is productive because it increases your total output in the one thing

[15:58] that gets you the most leverage that gets you closest to your goals in the shortest period

[16:02] of time.

[16:03] And this isn't a video of me saying, you know, work until you die, well, you will work

[16:07] until you die because we all will die and we all probably will work at some point.

[16:11] But it is more video of saying that every single thing that is not a requisite for you

[16:16] continuing to do the one thing that one yes are all distractions.

[16:21] They are all things that take away.

[16:23] And people have a hard time with this because they like to say like you need to have balance.

[16:27] But this is what poor people do not understand.

[16:31] And I am going to do my very best to kind of like pass down a message from the future

[16:35] to my past self about this and this goes for entrepreneurs specifically which is you

[16:39] do not understand how much work it is.

[16:41] Like you think you understand how much work it is.

[16:44] And I've had multiple times my life where I've met someone who was way further ahead

[16:48] to me.

[16:49] And I saw them actually working five to ten times more than me.

[16:52] And I was like, wow.

[16:54] And there's the scene in Invictus which is a movie with Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon.

[16:58] I love this moment.

[16:59] There's an exchange.

[17:00] I'm paraphrasing.

[17:01] But he says something to the extent of I've heard that you've been playing with an injury.

[17:05] And Matt Damon just kind of says, well, no one ever plays it 100%.

[17:08] And I just love that because to me that kind of encompasses the champion mindset which

[17:13] is that it's not about playing when circumstances are perfect.

[17:18] It's that playing creates perfect circumstances.

[17:20] We have to learn to play when the chips are stacked against us.

[17:24] It's like having values.

[17:26] Values are only valuable when they are tested.

[17:29] You can say you're loyal, but if a girl, if you're in a hotel room and a girl is there

[17:34] and your wife isn't there and there's no way that you find out.

[17:36] That is the test of whether you're loyal.

[17:39] It's when there's stakes.

[17:40] Test of whether you have work ethic is whether you can work when you're tired.

[17:42] It's whether you can work when you're distracted.

[17:44] It's whether you can work on things that you don't find pleasant.

[17:47] Because all of the, and I see this, well, you know, some of the young guys, like there was

[17:50] a guy we hired and then in three days he said, I don't think this is for me.

[17:52] And he got hired to a sales roll and he was making outbound calls.

[17:55] I was like, you don't think this is for you.

[17:57] I was like, you don't even know what's for you.

[17:59] You're here for three days.

[18:00] You didn't even get the ability to get good at the basic thing.

[18:02] And so there's a level of intolerance for discomfort in some sort of expectation

[18:09] that it's going to be this amazing thing that you're going to love at all times and

[18:12] it's just not.

[18:13] And so I would, I'm okay being a different voice in the, in the entrepreneur space.

[18:18] That's not like, you know, passion is what is what gets you through the, the hard times.

[18:22] I don't think so.

[18:23] Passion has not been the thing that has gotten me through my, my harder times.

[18:26] It has been desire.

[18:28] It has been wanting to make something into a reality by dragging something from your mind into

[18:35] the world.

[18:35] And sometimes I feel like you're giving birth to this thing, which for every mother,

[18:39] which I obviously haven't given birth is like you give birth, kicking and screaming.

[18:42] It's a painful experience, but then there's life that happens afterwards.

[18:45] And I see work as very much labor.

[18:49] And we even use the same word.

[18:51] It's labor.

[18:51] It's work.

[18:52] It's, it's painful.

[18:54] The pain is that like your halfway through, I would imagine.

[18:57] And you're like, I still have to keep pushing because it's still not alive yet.

[19:00] It's still not out.

[19:01] And so I think learning to push through that.

[19:03] And this is the part that my friend was saying, where he's like, they don't get it.

[19:07] They don't get it.

[19:07] They think that I do one of these speaking events.

[19:10] And they see my Instagram and they think, oh, okay, well, why is my brain not growing like that?

[19:13] He's like, well, I was in five different cities this week.

[19:17] And I just had to do FaceTime with my kids in order for them to see me.

[19:21] And people are that like, I wouldn't make that trade fine.

[19:24] But don't want what he has.

[19:26] And so let me draw this out for you in a nice little visual to show you how I see work.

[19:32] This volume that you need to do.

[19:34] So you have excitement, right?

[19:37] So when you have this new idea, which we have them, and you're like, oh my God, this

[19:42] is amazing, right?

[19:44] This is so good.

[19:45] The thing is, is that once you become neutral and then you become worried and stressed,

[19:51] this is when work begins.

[19:53] And so in the bodybuilding world, they'd be like, okay, once you have achieved failure,

[19:57] that is where you're working reps begin.

[19:59] It's an old school bodybuilding saying, I'm sure the science process will be upset about

[20:02] it.

[20:03] But I think that it very much qualifies for how it relates to work in this role.

[20:07] It's because your motivation fades very quickly.

[20:10] It's that work begins once motivation stops.

[20:13] And I think if you measure it that way, then you will measure how much you work and how

[20:16] hard you work very differently.

[20:17] So reminds me this, Muhammad Ali Quot, where he says, I hated every minute of training,

[20:21] but I would tell myself, suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion.

[20:25] I have this tweet that I said a minute ago that I really like.

[20:29] And so whenever I get to a low point where I think, why do I even bother?

[20:32] I just try and remind myself, this is where most people stop and this is why they don't

[20:35] win.

[20:36] That period, that wall that you hit, like that is the champion wall.

[20:41] That is where you leave everyone else behind because everyone only works until their

[20:44] point of excitement and then they stop.

[20:46] It's like you have to find that next year.

[20:48] So the next point is that they cannot copy your proof.

[20:55] People want to gain reputations.

[20:57] They want to be known for certain things.

[20:59] They want to get status.

[21:00] But people can copy your promises.

[21:03] They can copy your services.

[21:05] They can copy your logo.

[21:06] They can copy your name.

[21:07] But they can't copy what you've done.

[21:09] I have sometimes younger entrepreneurs reach out and they're like, hey, I want to build

[21:13] a big brand and they're like, I want to start making content.

[21:16] That I advise them to only make content if they're truly documenting and don't transition

[21:21] into teacher mode because the thing that will build your brand is the stuff you do.

[21:25] Like we look at the business titans that are out there.

[21:27] You look at Elon, you look at Baysoes, you look at maybe now Sam Alman, you look at

[21:31] Jensen Hweng from NVIDIA.

[21:33] And they now have these quote, big business brands, Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett.

[21:38] They are considered probably the leaders of the business world in terms of thought leadership.

[21:42] But did they get there by building personal brands or did they get there by building personal

[21:48] businesses and then by building personal businesses, which I'm joking here, they just

[21:52] built big ass businesses.

[21:54] By extension, people wanted to know who was the person behind this big business.

[21:59] And then they built their credibility before they built their likeability.

[22:03] Everyone wants to put the car before the horse, everyone wants to put the, they want

[22:06] to eat the pudding before they have the proof.

[22:07] You know, the proof comes before the pudding in the roll world.

[22:09] In a world where anyone can say anything and get instant reach, trust is the thing that

[22:14] is the scarcity.

[22:15] That is the, that is the rare commodity.

[22:18] And so the idea is if you want to build a really big brand, then you want to index super

[22:22] hard on trust.

[22:23] And the way that people contrast to you is that you do what you said you have done.

[22:26] The reason Mr. Beast videos worked is because he used his videos as proof.

[22:31] He didn't say I am super knowledgeable.

[22:33] He said, look, I did something that no one else was willing to do.

[22:35] His first video that would borrow was him counting to a million or something crazy.

[22:39] And so he did something that other people were not willing to do.

[22:41] And so he just happened to have documented that thing.

[22:43] And so if you're like, well, how do I get proof?

[22:45] I'm so young.

[22:46] It's like, well, you just do epic stuff.

[22:49] And then people will be like, wow, he did epic stuff.

[22:51] This is interesting.

[22:53] And so it still requires epic amounts of work in order to do that.

[22:56] The reason that there's such a misconception about overnight success is that it's just that

[23:00] there's a threshold over which you are good enough that you go viral.

[23:04] And so this is called it like here is the viral moment.

[23:09] All right.

[23:09] So this is our viral moment right here.

[23:10] The thing is that we, the person live this whole life.

[23:14] What we in the public see is this moment, what happens since.

[23:18] And so we have the perception of overnight success.

[23:20] And this is why it's so difficult for people to wrap their heads around because they want

[23:23] to model what they see, not what occurred.

[23:26] And so we have to model what they did, not what happened.

[23:29] And so this fundamentally is the inputs.

[23:31] This is what they put in for a long period of time.

[23:33] What we see here is the output.

[23:36] This is what's visible.

[23:37] And so this is where it gets especially difficult for people to learn.

[23:40] Is that most people get rich and then they get weird.

[23:43] And then what happens is people then try and copy what they do here, not what they did

[23:49] to get there.

[23:50] And so they copy the wrong stuff.

[23:51] They model the plateau, not the rise.

[23:53] So you don't get rich by flying on private jets.

[23:55] You get rich.

[23:56] Then you can fly on private jets.

[23:58] And so a big thing that richer people do is that they will act with urgency.

[24:02] And I would say this is just I even richer people.

[24:04] This is entrepreneurs specifically that I'm making this video for.

[24:06] Is that they act with urgency.

[24:08] And so you can tell in some ways how successful someone's going to be, but how quickly

[24:13] they do things.

[24:14] The gap between thoughts and action.

[24:17] And so this is a, I personally work on a lot, which is how quickly between when

[24:19] I make a decision to do something, does it actually occur?

[24:22] And you can improve your potency as a person, how powerful you are by decreasing the gap

[24:28] between thoughts and action.

[24:29] Like if you think about the hypothetical extreme of this, the God figure, if you will,

[24:33] thoughts and reality are one of the same.

[24:35] You think planets and universes and they appear.

[24:37] And so that would be the ultimate demonstration of power in my opinion.

[24:40] And so we can approximate that.

[24:42] We get as close to that as we can by shrinking the time it takes between when we think

[24:47] and when we decide and then when we ultimately do.

[24:49] When you don't have any more information to collect in order to make a decision, then you

[24:53] make the decision.

[24:54] And you make the decision by eliminating alternatives.

[24:57] So like literally the word decide comes from decadera, which is Latin for to cut off.

[25:01] And so the question is what thing are you eliminating by making the decision that you're going

[25:05] to make?

[25:06] And a really easy, tactical thing is, whenever you say I'm going to get this done by the end

[25:09] of the week, ask yourself, can I get it done by the end of the day?

[25:11] And that seems like a very small hack, but that increases your pace of progress by seven

[25:15] eggs.

[25:16] And so if you hear that, you're like, wow, seven eggs.

[25:18] It's like, yeah, and for that reason, there are people who are working 100 times faster

[25:22] than you.

[25:23] And I think that this is a really good cultural thing, which is you can just say end of

[25:27] day, not end of week, and not end of month and of week.

[25:35] So in each of the instances, this is a full Rex increase, this is a seven X increase.

[25:39] And you can even go, end of day goes into end of hour.

[25:43] Now this is one that Laila talks about a lot, and she's a master operator, is that she

[25:48] heard this from a mentor, she said, if it's a five minute task and you have five minutes,

[25:53] do it now.

[25:54] And so the amount of time from like, hey, we should do this thing.

[25:56] And then literally in 60 seconds, it's handled by Laila, like while I'm just walking around

[26:00] and talking, just like, shoot no ideas out there, is baffling.

[26:04] And so her speed of like, that's a great idea.

[26:08] It's already been, you know, delegated out, like she doesn't keep things on her plate.

[26:11] And so there's this big, falseness that I think is propagated by a lot of the social media

[26:17] world, because it feels good and gets lots of shares, because it gives people permission

[26:21] to be lazy.

[26:22] It gives people permission to tell themselves that they're great just the way they are.

[26:26] I wholeheartedly reject that entire notion.

[26:28] The idea that they sell you is that you're young, you've got time.

[26:32] And I think that is false, because all this does is extend how long it takes you to remember

[26:39] that number one tomorrow isn't guaranteed.

[26:42] Like I just looked at my new speed this morning and I, there was a guy that I knew,

[26:45] whose my age and he just died of stomach cancer, really sad, really nice guy, wife

[26:49] and three kids, indifitness, really in shape, just a freak thing that happened.

[26:53] And so the assumption that you've got time assumes that you know you're going to live forever,

[26:58] that you know you're going to live 200 and we know that that's not true.

[27:01] And let me put this in perspective, three out of 10,000 people live 200.

[27:06] And so everyone has this assumption in their mind that they're like, yeah, I'm at 50,

[27:09] so I'm going to make it to 100.

[27:10] Yeah, well, you've got a three and 10,000 shot of doing very unlikely.

[27:15] More realistically, you'll die at the median, which is 74 for men in the US, which means

[27:19] that at 37, you're actually at the halfway point.

[27:23] And so it's just in years.

[27:24] But if you adjust for the increased speed of time, so the same reason that you're kid

[27:28] at five years old thinks that something takes forever when you say it's going to happen next

[27:31] year.

[27:32] And when you're 40, something that happens next year feels like you blink your eyes and it's

[27:35] there.

[27:36] Is that when you're five, one year is 20% of your life.

[27:39] When you're 40, one year is two and a half percent of your life.

[27:42] And so it very much in real way is nine times faster than it is for your five world.

[27:47] And so it's my belief that as we get older, we don't become more patient, time just moves

[27:51] faster.

[27:52] And so if you adjust for that time speed, your midpoint isn't 37.

[27:56] It's closer to 21.

[27:58] And so this is also why in my opinion, when you think back when your life, you have so

[28:01] much meat in the first 20 or so much stuff happens, all these material life events.

[28:05] And it's because in that time period, it was half of your life.

[28:09] And then after that, everything happens real fast.

[28:11] And so you have to realize this one tomorrow is guaranteed.

[28:14] Two, nothing is going to be easy.

[28:16] Just get over it.

[28:17] Every time you think, oh, this could look just get immediately skipped to it.

[28:20] So that's not true.

[28:21] There's something I don't know about that.

[28:23] Just skip to it.

[28:24] The faster you can train that muscle that as soon as you have this phomo just slow down

[28:28] and realize that you don't know enough.

[28:30] Three, it takes time to get good.

[28:32] There's known who's good at anything.

[28:33] That was immediately good at it.

[28:35] And the people who are immediately good at it, I remember telling a professor, I was like,

[28:37] you know, I've just naturally been good at languages.

[28:39] He was like, when you were a kid, did you have multiple languages in your household?

[28:41] And I was like, well, yeah, I buy languages.

[28:44] And he was like, what are you even talking about?

[28:46] Like you literally started with that.

[28:47] So of course, languages are easier for you.

[28:49] And so the thing is, is that the people who have things that come naturally to them,

[28:52] they just only came because they forgot the work that generalized to the new skill.

[28:57] Once you realize that it takes time to repetitions it get good, then you also realize

[29:00] that the sooner you start, the sooner you get and don't stop until you do.

[29:05] So let's assume you act with urgency.

[29:08] You've gotten that done, you've moved, end of week to end of day, you've moved end of

[29:11] this hour, you moved end of month to end of this week and you've massively increased

[29:14] the speed that you execute.

[29:15] So then you start running face forward into the fact that things are going to get really

[29:19] hard really fast.

[29:21] And so I will tell you, this one is that hard is for now, not forever.

[29:25] And so the good thing about bad times is that they end.

[29:29] And the bad thing about good times is that they also end.

[29:31] And so whenever you're going through a good season, it's also a good reminder that this

[29:35] two shall pass.

[29:36] And so what ends up happening is that when you're in the hard time, that can give you

[29:40] that necessary, but it can give you the end of the tunnel that you can look for to.

[29:43] There's only three outcomes.

[29:45] Either quit, it gets easier or you get harder.

[29:48] So think about that because no matter what, it always ends, but you only lose when you quit

[29:53] before you see it through because two out of the three outcomes get easier.

[29:57] Either it relents the outside circumstance gets easier, like the hard thing moves or you

[30:02] become harder and then by extension, it no longer feels hard for you, which I'll make

[30:06] this real for you.

[30:07] Right now, think about the problems that you were stressed about five years ago in

[30:11] your business.

[30:12] Think about the things that you were dealing with, what you were stressed about.

[30:15] Now think about you trying to solve those problems today.

[30:17] It's probably a joke to you now.

[30:18] You'd be like, yeah, obviously.

[30:20] It's not that those things became less hard, you became better.

[30:23] But here's where this gets really interesting for me.

[30:26] It just means that nothing is inherently hard to begin with anyways.

[30:29] We are just always inadequate.

[30:31] For me, I remember when I had five employees and I was like, man, so many people to manage

[30:34] or, you know, I was like, where am I going to, you know, I have to manage cashflow.

[30:37] How do I do that?

[30:38] Or like, how am I going to get new customers?

[30:40] Like, how do I, how do I say, I can't sell really expensive stuff?

[30:42] Like, what if someone gets upset, you know, if I if I charge more, right?

[30:46] What if someone finds out I charged this much as though it's like something wrong?

[30:49] Like all of these things are just just irrelevant to me now, just so silly, though for

[30:55] me at the time they were difficult.

[30:56] And I can only imagine how in consequential the problems that I deal with, growing hopefully

[31:02] $3 billion companies right now within the portfolio, compared to what Elon deals with having

[31:06] six multiple hundred billion companies.

[31:10] And I compare myself to that so I can always feel like I have a long way to go.

[31:15] But let me give you one thing that that'll also give you a little bit of hope about these

[31:18] these hard times is that these hard times are also for best times.

[31:29] But only in reverse.

[31:32] And so let me explain what I mean about that.

[31:33] Think about the times when you were younger and you were love and you were poor and you're

[31:37] like man, there's really good old days.

[31:38] The thing is is that when you were in that moment, it was stressful.

[31:40] You didn't know how to you're going to make ends meet, hard to make rent, where you're

[31:43] going to get food, whatever it is.

[31:44] You have these these hard times, the hard times that you go through today.

[31:48] But these hard times become the good old days.

[31:50] And so we only see the truth when we look back.

[31:53] You have to go through them to get the perspective.

[31:56] And it's something that I try and like remember on a regular basis that like, I'm going

[31:59] through the good old days.

[32:00] And if they're the good old days in the future, they might as well be the good old days

[32:03] today.

[32:04] So let me tell you a little bit about what it feels like throughout this entire process.

[32:10] Because if you were consistently growing, you were consistently in pain.

[32:13] That's why they're called growing pains, not growing joys.

[32:17] And if you have stress from growth, remember the alternative is that you can have stress from

[32:24] stagnation and you can have stress from decline, which fundamentally means that hardness

[32:28] and stress is a fact of life.

[32:31] You will always have stress.

[32:32] You will always have problems.

[32:33] And the largest problem of all, the largest stress or a ball is determining that having

[32:37] problems is a problem.

[32:39] Is that being stressed means there's something wrong with you.

[32:42] But being stressed just means your life, having problems just means that you are actually

[32:46] doing something.

[32:47] I'll tell you this story that I think can drive this home.

[32:49] And I think this is the path to fulfillment over comfort.

[32:56] So imagine you talk the creative universe before birth.

[32:59] And pick the person you get to become.

[33:01] You say I want to be the most courageous.

[33:03] The creative replies and says, well, then I will give you monsters to terrify you so that you

[33:06] can conquer them.

[33:07] And you say, well, I want to be patient.

[33:08] And the creative replies, well, then I will make you work harder and longer so you can

[33:12] learn to wait.

[33:13] So then you say, I want to be wise.

[33:14] And the creative replies, then I will give you failures that will crush your spirits so

[33:17] you can learn the value of judgment.

[33:19] You then say, sounds like a rough life.

[33:21] Can you give me a good life?

[33:22] The creative replies, just like we mentioned the quality of a blacksmith by the strength of

[33:25] his steel.

[33:26] I'll tell you, imagine you by what you are at the end, not the fire and the hammer it took to make you.

[33:31] A good life isn't a life that's easy.

[33:33] A good life is a life that makes you into a good person.

[33:36] And that my son is a hard life.

[33:38] And so I remember when I sold Jim Lange, there was a year that I more or less took off.

[33:42] I had all these kind of existential crises that I was going through because all I'd been doing

[33:46] was just working, working, and then I hadn't like put my head up to like look around and

[33:50] smell the roses per se.

[33:52] The problem that I had was that when I was smelling the roses, I was miserable.

[33:55] I was very sad.

[33:56] And the sadness from me came from the thing that I had that was most reinforcing my life was

[34:00] the work that I was doing.

[34:01] Now it was the thing that I enjoyed the most.

[34:03] And so not having that actually created a huge loss for me.

[34:06] And so then I had to create like, what am I doing?

[34:07] Like why am I here?

[34:08] Right?

[34:09] And so for me that was when I created the hypothesis or at least the thesis I had for my life

[34:12] was that hard work is the goal.

[34:14] Is that nothing left in the tank, which I got from Jesse Getzard, which I love.

[34:18] Emptying the tank every day is the point.

[34:20] Because for me, those are the days that when I look back or the days that I feel the most

[34:23] fulfilled on.

[34:24] At the moment you feel tired, you feel exhausted, you feel like you're bored, you feel like

[34:27] you don't want to do another repetition, you don't want to do another two hours.

[34:30] But another two hours, another repetition.

[34:32] Another edit is what is required, not what you want, but what is required.

[34:36] And if you have a little bit left in the tank, and you can't know if you have a little

[34:39] bit left in the tank until you empty it until you physically can't.

[34:42] And so I think about that steel that we're trying to make and the only difference is that

[34:46] we are both the steel and the boxbook.

[34:48] And so the creator in this would just give you the fire.

[34:50] And either you can stand far enough away from it that it just keeps you warm, or you can

[34:54] go into it and you can hammer out the impurities so that you can just become better and better

[34:58] and stronger.

[34:59] And if you're watching this and you would like to start a business, but you're not sure

[35:03] where to start.

[35:04] I am a co-owner of school and we just started the school games.

[35:07] And right now we're giving a hundred thousand dollars away in cash or a cyber truck to the

[35:12] person who builds the biggest community on school in 30 days.

[35:16] And so schools just a community platform that else people start businesses.

[35:19] And right now one out of two people who start a community, a pay community on school,

[35:24] make their first dollar online.

[35:26] And so you're like, okay, well that's cool.

[35:28] And right now on average, the average pay community owner makes one thousand three hundred

[35:32] sixty dollars per month.

[35:33] So this is not going to be the thing that makes you a billionaire rich.

[35:37] But it can help you get started, which is why I invest in the company.

[35:39] I spent four years looking for something that can make the easiest, kind of store their

[35:42] business for people to get going and especially starting online.

[35:45] The reason that we have this success rate, right?

[35:47] The reason that we have this very high success rate is that we have this very high

[35:49] is that I meet every single week in on board new people.

[35:52] So every Monday, I'm on a call and I'm on board.

[35:55] Right now, I think it's about 300 people per call that are on there.

[35:58] And so I answer questions live with everyone on there.

[36:00] And it's a lot of times the same face.

[36:02] And so while the calls are relatively small, I'd encourage you to come on.

[36:05] On top of that, I have kind of like step by step instructions of exactly what you need

[36:09] to do that the best community owners have done.

[36:12] And so you can just model the behaviors.

[36:13] Just do this stuff.

[36:14] I don't explain psychology and triggers.

[36:16] And then it's just like do this stuff and this is what yields this outcome.

[36:21] And then finally, we'll give you the entire platform that basically makes all the tech

[36:26] really easy.

[36:27] And so right now, we've got people who aren't foreign countries who don't speak English.

[36:31] We've got, I mean, I think there was a guy who wanted to came to his 15 years old.

[36:35] So like, I'm telling you, it's not rocket science.

[36:37] Like we've really taken a lot of effort to make it as simply as you can possibly.

[36:40] You don't need any other software to make this work.

[36:42] And so if that sounds all interesting, the best part about all of this,

[36:46] is that you can start absolutely free.

[36:48] And so we have the course, we have the calls, we have the platform.

[36:51] We also have the community by other people.

[36:52] All right.

[36:53] And so you can start for free at 14 days.

[36:55] You can click the link, which is right here.

[36:57] We've another one.

[36:59] School.com for it's slash games.

[37:01] Start free and hopefully I'll see you on the other side.

[37:05] And so a big part of why this is so hard is that so few people want to go into the fire.

[37:09] Right?

[37:10] And the fire could be entrepreneurship.

[37:11] The fire could be content creation.

[37:12] The fire could be starting a new product.

[37:14] The fire could be doing an outreach in knocking indoors or quitting your job and

[37:18] starting another job in a completely different industry.

[37:20] That's the fire.

[37:21] It's the thing that other people aren't willing to do.

[37:23] And they tell you not to do it because helps them justify the risk that they chose

[37:26] not to take.

[37:27] It helps them feel better about the risks they aren't willing to make.

[37:31] I remember thinking about this at long length when I was younger.

[37:34] And I thought about the word exceptional.

[37:36] Right?

[37:37] So buried in the word itself is the key point, which is that you cannot expect

[37:43] to be accepted if you want to be exceptional.

[37:46] To become exceptional by definition, you have to become the exception, which means you have

[37:51] to be unlike other people.

[37:52] You have to do what they don't agree with.

[37:54] If they agreed with you, if everyone agrees with you, you can be sure that it's the wrong

[37:58] path.

[37:59] When I quit my job, every single person in my life told me is better to do.

[38:03] I graduated three years from Vanderbilt.

[38:04] I had a nice way of calling it.

[38:05] Consulting job.

[38:06] I was set up to go to grad school to one of the Ivy leagues.

[38:09] I had ace my GMATs.

[38:10] I was set up.

[38:11] I'd done the path.

[38:12] And so if we didn't quit, I'm going to be a personal trainer for men and

[38:15] wage it a gym.

[38:16] That was not a happy news for the vast majority of people that I knew.

[38:19] But the thing is, is that I've had those conversations multiple times my life.

[38:23] When I ended up leaving the gyms and started the turnaround business, every person was like,

[38:27] you finally made this thing work.

[38:28] You finally, you know, now we finally agree with you again.

[38:31] And it was right at the point where they accepted me, that I was like, you know what?

[38:34] I think I want to do this other thing.

[38:35] And I'm going to sell all these gyms for basically nothing in 90 days to then start new.

[38:39] And they're like, but you spent so long on this.

[38:41] And they see some cost, Fowsey.

[38:43] And the thing is, don't listen to the people who are closest to you, listen to the people

[38:48] who are closest to your goals.

[38:50] And so a lot of people like to think about how they have these mentors and these heroes.

[38:55] But the most important group is your reference group.

[38:58] And your reference group is who you compare yourself to.

[39:00] But the thing is that people think they compare themselves so they're mentors and

[39:03] they're heroes, but they don't.

[39:04] Who you compare yourself to is who influences your decisions.

[39:09] So the voices you hear, the voices you listen to when you're about to make a big move,

[39:13] those voices are your actual reference group.

[39:17] And if those voices are not close to your goal, you should not listen to them.

[39:21] If anything, sometimes the best advice in the world is do the opposite of whatever it is

[39:25] that they did to get in their life if you don't want what they have.

[39:29] Don't listen to what they said.

[39:30] Even when you're an entrepreneur, so let's fast forward a couple of years.

[39:33] So there was a point where I started the outbound team.

[39:37] So this is in sound super tactical, but I'm going to zoom out for you.

[39:39] So we at Jim launch had we were all paid ads for the most part.

[39:43] We had made content, I had a book, like there were things that were out there, but still 70%

[39:47] plus of my new customers came from paid ads.

[39:50] And I knew that if I wanted to sell the company, I would have to create a second acquisition

[39:54] channel that was very different from the primary ones that I could create more stability.

[39:58] So you don't have one eye just one point of failure within the business.

[40:00] And so I remember reading this book about how to set up outbound.

[40:05] And it said, it will take a year.

[40:06] And I said, I'm really good at marketing, really good at sales.

[40:08] It'll take me 12 weeks.

[40:10] And it took 12 months, like the book said.

[40:13] And so when I walked through that, what was interesting is it took 90 days for us to get our

[40:18] first sale.

[40:19] And the whole time I'm investing in this team, investing in software, I'm investing in training,

[40:23] and consulting to learn how to get all this stuff going.

[40:26] Just to get our first sale.

[40:27] But that's not very good for the amount of time and effort we put into it.

[40:31] And then three months after that, we started getting a couple sales trickling in, still

[40:36] not a lot.

[40:37] And I actually had almost like an intervention for my executive team that were like, hey,

[40:42] we think this is shiny object.

[40:43] There are using my words against it.

[40:44] Like, I think this is the distraction.

[40:46] It's not yielding a result for us.

[40:49] I don't think we should cut our losses and move on.

[40:53] And I kept thinking to myself, this is what hard feels like.

[40:57] We have to just keep inching our way through it, because we have made sales, which

[41:00] we could just, we just need to get more efficient at it.

[41:03] And then we did another six months and then we got to the point where it became 50% of revenue.

[41:06] But here's the thing that you don't see.

[41:08] And so whether you're starting a new acquisition channel like I was, you're starting paid

[41:12] ads, whatever is that if I tell you, in one year, I could double your business.

[41:18] Right?

[41:19] Let's say you have to pay me $100,000, right?

[41:22] And in one year, I will double your business.

[41:24] Many people would probably be like, yeah, signed me up.

[41:26] I'll do it.

[41:27] Maybe I'll take a loan.

[41:28] I know I'm going to double my business in a year.

[41:30] I'll do it.

[41:31] But then what happens is month one, they drop 5K and then they lose 5K.

[41:37] And then month two, they lose 5K again.

[41:40] And then they say, oh, ads aren't for me.

[41:42] Oh, outbound's not for me.

[41:44] But the thing is is that the way it actually feels is that you lose 5K, you lose another

[41:48] 5K, you lose another 5K.

[41:50] And then all of a sudden one month, you make 25K.

[41:53] And then the next month, you make 50K.

[41:55] And you make all of this back and some.

[41:59] But it happens all at once.

[42:00] And so there's a single one, Wall Street, that I like, which is, it happens slower than

[42:03] you expect and then faster than you can imagine.

[42:05] And they talk about that when it comes to market drops and market explosions.

[42:09] It's like, we should be crashing.

[42:11] It hasn't adjusted yet.

[42:12] It happens slower than you expect and then faster than you can imagine.

[42:15] And so you have to be willing to forego that period of time for a long time, understanding

[42:20] that you just want to make progress.

[42:22] And so I think the thing that separates masters from beginners is that masters have more

[42:27] ways to win.

[42:28] So you can measure your expertise in anything.

[42:30] By the ways you can measure, equally the number of times and ways you can win.

[42:34] And so if you're an expert at making videos, then throughout the entire process of a really

[42:40] long project, you have many wins on the way.

[42:43] You know all the little progress markers that occur to create some big outcome.

[42:48] And you approximate those little progress markers for the ultimate goal at the end.

[42:51] When you're a beginner, you only see the output.

[42:54] And all you see is I'm doing stuff and nothing is happening.

[42:57] But you just aren't able to mark progress well.

[43:00] And so if you want to increase your expertise, then you need to increase the number of ways

[43:05] you can measure so that you can increase the number of wins you have in a given time period.

[43:10] And by the way, that is what makes you enjoy your work.

[43:13] And this is how the work itself becomes reinforcing.

[43:15] And so in order to develop that expertise, you have to have education.

[43:20] People think that education is expensive.

[43:22] But the only thing more expensive than education is nothing educated.

[43:27] And so I would say that in my life, I spent more money than I could possibly imagine simply

[43:31] trying to acquire skills and relationships that would make me better.

[43:34] To give you an idea, I think the most expensive thing that I bought for this, this is not

[43:38] including me messing stuff up and just losing tons of money.

[43:42] But actually wrote a check for it was $350,000 a bit later with the guy who was worth

[43:46] $7 billion.

[43:47] And I got exactly what I wanted from that dinner and it was incredibly valuable from it.

[43:53] And he kept saying no, I asked or offered a hundred k and then 200 k and 250 k and 350 k.

[43:58] And when we offered 350 k, you said fine, I'll just have dinner with you and he didn't ask for the money.

[44:03] But I think it was just seeing that I was willing to spend the 350,000 dollars for it.

[44:07] And so I've spent so much money for one hour, two hours, anything to gain context.

[44:13] Because I heard this close and you've heard if you've watched my channel you've heard this before.

[44:17] But pick whatever number your income goal is, right?

[44:20] Let's say it's a million dollars a year.

[44:21] And let's say you're currently making a hundred thousand dollars a year.

[44:25] If you value that million dollar goal, the value of the million dollars per year,

[44:32] what's the price you put on that education?

[44:34] The value of that education is the difference between where you're at and where you want to go.

[44:38] And so that's why if I want to become a decabillionaire, then I should be willing to pay everything

[44:43] that I have in order to gain the skills, the experience, the knowledge in order to get there.

[44:46] And so if there's a way that you can spend 50,000 dollars in order to learn a million dollar per year,

[44:52] skill set, then every year you don't do it, you lose 900, 50,000 dollars that you would have made if you had made that investment.

[44:59] And so the key point here is that we use poor people language when we talk about education.

[45:05] When we should be using investor language, because it should be an investment in an asset.

[45:09] And the asset just happens to be you and you can't sell it.

[45:11] But you can invest in it and you can grow it.

[45:13] If you think about investments, you'll never say an investment is expensive.

[45:17] There's just a cost and a return.

[45:19] But if someone says there's a hundred dollar stock or a thousand dollar stock,

[45:22] it could be expensive relative to the return.

[45:24] But if the return is supposed to be good, the known says that that amount of money itself is expensive.

[45:30] It's just what the cost is for the return.

[45:33] It is the investment.

[45:34] And so if you think about education that same way, it always has to be framed in terms of what you get for it.

[45:38] Now how much it costs.

[45:39] It's not about how much you make now.

[45:41] It's how much you're going to make and how much that's worth to you.

[45:44] And for me, whatever my delta is is what I'm willing to pour into that without hesitation.

[45:50] And so for the first, probably, I mean, shoot I lost everything at year, whatever, six of my

[45:54] entrepreneurial journey.

[45:55] And I put all of the extra money that I had right back into learning more stuff.

[46:00] Then so even though I made profit, my biggest expense was me.

[46:04] But it wasn't on my living in my lifestyle.

[46:06] It was on my education and my network and my surroundings and the skills I wanted to learn.

[46:10] Of course, it's the workshops, seminars, the coaching programs, all the things that I did.

[46:13] I'm a product of that world, despite the fact that I think that world overall has a lot of

[46:16] shape people.

[46:17] I still learned a lot.

[46:18] And you can learn just as much by learning what not to do and say I will never do that or treat

[46:23] someone the way that person treated me.

[46:24] Because the best students never come out negative.

[46:28] So really, like, I think that like I have always been the top performer in every single

[46:35] program, coaching, whatever I have ever done.

[46:38] And so the process that I use is number one, do everything they tell you to to the

[46:44] team the first time, then take what works and toss the rest.

[46:49] You can learn something from everyone, but only take in that which makes you stronger, which is a

[46:54] quote that I have from Harry Potter, the sort of Gryffindor.

[46:56] But I love it because it was enchanted to have this spell that it would only take in things that

[47:00] made it stronger.

[47:01] So it took in the best, which allowed it to kill the whole crux is later on.

[47:05] But I like to see myself as that sword, is that I continue to invest a continue to put

[47:10] things into the steel, but I only take in that which makes me stronger.

[47:12] So a lot of people have these negative experiences with coaches, consultants, vendors, whatever.

[47:17] And I just like to think of myself like in what way will this make me better.

[47:20] And so by instead asking that question rather than enumerating the many things they could have

[47:25] done better or the things they did wrong, simply saying there is something that I can learn from this.

[47:29] And there is something in this experience that will make me stronger.

[47:32] And that frame may have been one of those viable frames that I've had because I like you

[47:36] have spent plenty of money on things that have quote not worked.

[47:39] But I still learned enough from them and oftentimes what not to do that allowed me to then see what

[47:44] to do. But before I ever did that, I had to do the first three steps of that, which was do

[47:49] everything they said to the T the first time. And if for whatever reason it did not work,

[47:55] I would then use my other skills to patch the difference so that I could find a way to make it work.

[48:01] And by the way, if they have a success story, which they usually do, because that's how they

[48:04] sold you, is that you find that person and figure out what they're doing that is lacking in the

[48:10] education that the person who's teaching taught. Fundamentally, if you ever buy something where

[48:14] there is somebody who has been successful, then it means there are activities that yield success.

[48:19] And the discrepancy, I'm going to show this to you visually, because I think it's important.

[48:23] So let's say there's a bridge, right? And you've got, you know, here's money and here's you, okay?

[48:31] So you've got this path that someone shows you how to do. So you paid money and they give you these

[48:37] little bricks here, right? They give you these little bricks that you paid money for. And maybe these bricks

[48:41] you had to pay different vendors, different amounts of money for each one of these bricks.

[48:44] But you still have been made money yet. The thing is is that there's a gap here. And the reason

[48:49] that some people are successful with some people's programs or implementations and other people aren't

[48:54] is because that the people who already bought that brick from somebody else before that,

[48:59] that brick isn't missing. And so if you see the education you have as these bricks on the road,

[49:04] then you wouldn't say that the foundation of a house is in some way a rip off. You would just say

[49:09] it's not a complete house. Now, if they sold you the expectation that you would have a house sure,

[49:14] you could be upset by them, but they still helped you build a foundation. And so it's the same

[49:18] people who get upset saying, oh, I learned arithmetic from Mrs. Glass, but then when I found Mr. Hardwick

[49:24] and he taught me calculus, she only taught me arithmetic. She is a moron. You wouldn't say that.

[49:28] But for some reason people talk about the basics of business the same way when they become

[49:33] more advanced. If someone taught you how to do outbound and do warm out reach, they could say

[49:37] your first customers. And someone else later teaches you how to run ads. Well, you probably learned how

[49:42] to work the leach from the ads that work for you because you learned how to do outbound. You probably

[49:45] learned how to sell because you learned how to sell strangers. And so when you did the ads, it worked

[49:48] for you and then somebody else who did that same exact implementation. It didn't have the bricks that

[49:52] you had and they never got the dollars that came across. And so whenever something doesn't work,

[49:57] if you can, it doesn't make you any better by saying it's their fault. And it fault also only

[50:03] matters in the eyes of the law, which you're not going to see anybody anyway. So who gives this shit?

[50:07] The only thing that matters is whether the outcome happens or not, which is under your control,

[50:11] because it means that you simply have a discrepancy where you are and where you want to go.

[50:15] And so a lot of people would then say, sure Alex is easy for you to say you're a white guy.

[50:20] You're right. Cool. So just don't watch the video moving. But for everybody else, you've got connections.

[50:27] You've got money, you've got looks, you've got intellect or intelligence. These are all great.

[50:34] But you can be all of these. You can be somebody who has all four if you have one thing,

[50:39] which is the desire to improve the insatiable desire to improve. No matter where you start,

[50:46] if you have this, it's hard to beat someone who improves every second of every day without stopping

[50:52] without giving up. And so I have met people who have connections when he looks in intelligence.

[50:56] And they do not people who have an insatiable desire to improve, who do not stop. And so if you think

[51:01] about it like this, if life were a race or at the end you die, so got to finish first. Right?

[51:08] There are people who may start at different parts of that race. But what is not measured is the speed

[51:15] that you can move. And so I don't know if you've seen these clips that have gone viral on the NFL,

[51:18] where they have like one of their wide receiver start like 20 yards behind a fan. And they have to

[51:22] race the length of the football field. And then the wide receiver will usually catch up,

[51:26] like talk to them and then just speed right past them. And so it's far less about where you start

[51:31] because that's where a lot of losers will define themselves. They'll define themselves by what

[51:35] happened to them rather than what they made happen. And somebody else may be here. But it only matters

[51:40] if you think that they're fairness. But I don't believe fairness is something that exists in the

[51:44] universe. And so I don't hold it as an ideal that I proclaim must exist. But there is simply

[51:49] a starting point in a rate of progress. And the starting point you can't control, but the rate of

[51:53] progress you can't. And so control where you can control. If education is a change in behavior,

[51:59] that's what you do. If you become educated you do something different after you learn something.

[52:02] Then intelligence is rate of learning. Which means that you can in a very real way influence

[52:07] it's the rate of learning, the speed of learning. You can influence how quickly you move along this race

[52:13] independent of where you start. And you'll also know that the person here has no influence on

[52:19] what this person does. These two people are independent nodes. The only reason that this person

[52:24] gets upset is that they think it's not fair. And if you just eliminate fairness from your vocabulary

[52:30] and think only in terms of what do I need to do, then it eliminates a lot of the distraction

[52:35] that keeps you poor. So if you call from the very beginning lazy people get distracted. They focus

[52:43] on distraction. And one of the biggest distractions is it's not fair. It's it's not fair. I shouldn't

[52:48] have to. I should get. I should. I should. It should. Things shouldn't. It's all should. And I will

[52:55] tell you that should in my world view should not exist. Because should create expectations of an

[53:03] uncaring universe. It says that you demand something and I promise you that the universe will win.

[53:08] And so all you have to do is watch like baby seals just get immediately eaten by at work as

[53:13] after like a mother is laying there on the ice to be like, wow, life isn't fair. I'm sure that

[53:18] seal could be like, it's not fair that my babies were literally eaten in front of me. Tuff. Right?

[53:24] Tuff. They have mammal brains. We can see that they got some feelings. Right? And so if we go back to the

[53:30] sort of riftendor, does demanding that it should be fair make you stronger? Does saying that that

[53:35] person started further have had a view in any way benefit you? No. Because your actions are entirely

[53:41] independent from them. And so the only thing that that does is actually delay your speed of taking action.

[53:47] It makes you dumber because if we define intelligence by rate of learning, then it means it takes

[53:52] you longer to learn. It makes you stupid. And I think that that's why people say here for a very

[53:57] long time. And many of them never leave. So what are the things that bad entrepreneurs talk about

[54:07] with good entrepreneurs? Is one of the excuses they'll make is that they will make preferred

[54:12] six uses. They will make trade-off excuses. They will say this is not worth the price in which case

[54:19] fine, but don't also want the thing. So for example, privacy is the price of fame.

[54:25] Loneliness is the price of ambition. Pleasure is the price of discipline. Navity is the price of

[54:32] loyalty discretion is the price of trust. And so so many people want the benefits of these traits,

[54:38] but can't afford the cost or the price. They're not willing to be discreet, but they want some

[54:42] to trust them. They can't hold someone's secrets. They want so many people be loyal to them at home,

[54:48] but then they want the thrill of the new relationship. They want the benefits of discipline of

[54:52] consistency, but they can't trade the pleasure in the moment. They want ambition, but they're not

[54:59] willing to pay the price of being lonely, of being the exception. They want fame, but then all of a

[55:04] sudden they are startled when they realize that they have no privacy. And so each of these things are

[55:10] trade-offs. And if you're not willing to make the trade fine, but don't bitch about it. And I think

[55:16] part of it is that we have a hard time understanding to what degree. And so each of these ideals are

[55:23] not binary. It's not discretion. It's how much discretion you have. It's not novelty. It's

[55:28] how much knowledge. It's not pleasure. It's how much pleasure. It's not loneliness. It's how

[55:32] moment. And it's not hard work. It's how hard do you have to work and how long do you have to work.

[55:37] And so most people when I think this is where a lot of the complaints come is that they believe

[55:42] they're doing 10 out of 10 work. They're like, I'm doing this is 10 out of 10 hard for me. Right now.

[55:47] But they're actually only doing one tenth of the amount of work that it takes to get to this goal.

[55:55] And so they might be doing a 10 out of 10 work for a hundred kg, but they're doing a one out of

[56:00] 10 work for a one million dollar bowl. And I think a lot of that work comes down to being able

[56:05] to accurately assess reality and see what your actual discrepancies are and realize how much work you

[56:11] really have to do in order to get good at every one of those discrepancies. Because most outcomes

[56:17] don't occur until you've met all of the conditions like a pipeline. All right. So let's say you've

[56:21] got this pipeline here and you've got these valves. These are the valves. You've got this water that's

[56:26] coming here and let's say once you get all the way through the water comes out the other side.

[56:29] These valves have to open. You have to open this thing. Open each of these valves. And let's see you've

[56:36] checked off three of the four boxes. The water's still going to be stuck here. You're still not

[56:40] going to get the water through. And so the thing is that as much as you work and you're like,

[56:44] but I did that and I did that and that didn't work and that didn't work. It may have worked. It just

[56:50] might not have met every condition to get the outcome. And so if you think about life and

[56:54] outcomes that way, it gets a lot easier because it stops being emotional. You can simply say

[56:58] there's a condition that I haven't met and I have to figure out what that condition is.

[57:01] Rather than proclaiming that the universe isn't fair or that you you started further back and

[57:07] that's why your effort hasn't resulted in it. Maybe and maybe this person only has to meet three of

[57:14] these and you have to meet four. Okay, well then I guess that means that you're going to be better than

[57:19] them. Why is that a bad thing? It means that you're going to develop more skills to achieve the same goal.

[57:25] Great. If the end of this life is that you are the steel, you are the thing that gets created.

[57:31] Then you can't resent the hammer and the fire that makes you because you can't wish for strong

[57:36] character in an easy life because the price of each is the other. So either people aren't

[57:41] succeeding because they don't understand that they have to make a trade that they're not willing to make.

[57:44] Or the trade that they're currently making isn't sufficient. So they either think that they deserve

[57:49] to get the neck issues just for being who they are and think it's not fair and think that the

[57:53] store owners should just give them the neck issues and look all you have to do is look at the news. There's

[57:56] plenty of people who think that way and they go and try and take it. But that makes them a thief.

[58:00] That makes them significantly worse. It actually does more harm to them in my opinion. But there are

[58:04] people who believe that. That's the worst, that's the lowest level. The next little above that is

[58:08] people who say, no, I'm willing to pay for the night use, but I'll pay 30. It's like, yeah, but they're

[58:13] 300. That's the price. It's like, yeah, but I'll pay 30. They understand the extent of the trade off.

[58:19] And then they complain that they're $30 is good enough. It shouldn't be so expensive. It is what it is.

[58:25] And so there's a saying that Laila and I say a lot internally, like it takes what it takes.

[58:28] And so if we want this thing what often has to happen is you have to keep bidding. It's much more

[58:33] more like an auction of a trade off because the real world level three is that you see the

[58:38] night keys and then you bid 30. And then you realize it's not enough. And rather than moan or put your

[58:44] thing down and walk away, you're like 50. They're like, you're like 100. You're like, god. And so that

[58:52] is the pain is being able to consistently reset the expectations and bid again and again. And again,

[58:58] until eventually you make it all the way through and you bid $300, you do get your night keys.

[59:06] And then all of a sudden everyone says, must be nice to be born so naturally good. All you have to do

[59:14] by the way is watch them my very first content pieces and you think my very first for content pieces

[59:18] are the podcast that I made. Various for content pieces that I made, I made for my gyms 13 years ago.

[59:24] And so it's like man, you're so naturally good on camera. Watch those videos. Tell me if you think the

[59:30] same way. I had to take shots before the video is because I was so nervous about something stupid.

[59:33] And the fourth version, I'd say like the highest version of this. So let's I'll break this down.

[59:37] So the zero level of trade offs is should. You just say you should get it for nothing. The next level

[59:44] is too much. So you say it's 30 bucks but it's actually 300 and you say it should. The next level

[59:53] is bidding. So you bid. So you say 30, 50, 100 and you find out that you're in sufficient. You keep

[60:00] going up. The final is source which is where you determine the price. And this is often in my

[60:05] opinion where you create your reality. So it's continuing to hammer away at content, continuing to

[60:11] write drafts of the book before anyone else has seen it because you were the one that holds a

[60:15] standard higher than everyone else is because no longer do you accept the approval of others as

[60:21] your litmus test. The market for sure in the beginning will tell you whether you're good or not.

[60:25] But Steve Jobs, Henry Ford, right? They would have asked for faster horses, not cars. Is that they

[60:32] demand more from themselves than anyone else does. And by setting that standard here, where everyone

[60:38] else is here, by actually meeting the standards of the market, you actually lower your own.

[60:43] And so this is where your standards become source. And this is where you get into rarefied air.

[60:48] And this is what the quote rich guys, if you will, when we talk behind closed doors about what

[60:53] people don't understand, it's about holding the standard. And in my opinion, the person who should

[60:58] make the decision in every organization is the person who is the high standards, not the person who

[61:01] knows the senior, not the person who has the most shares, it's the person who is the highest standards

[61:06] for whatever it is. Our marketing should be at this level. If the owner thinks it's less than that

[61:10] person should be the person who's running marketing. If somebody else thinks the product needs to be

[61:14] this good and someone else thinks to be less, that person should be in charge, whether it's their

[61:17] first day or the thousandth day. The person who has the highest standards is the one who should be

[61:22] making the decision, they should become source. And so when you get to that level, the only person

[61:26] you're making tradeoffs with is yourself. You're the one who's determining is this good enough for me

[61:33] to put my name on rather than is this good enough for them to say it's good. And for example,

[61:39] Jarartokin worked on the Hobbit for a decade and he didn't even submit the draft. One of his

[61:44] friends saw that he'd been working on it for a decade and submitted it, grabbed it from his

[61:48] desk and submitted it for him to a publisher and then it obviously became the Hobbit and everything

[61:52] came after that. And so his standards were so high that he still didn't even think it was ready,

[61:58] but it was still so good that he ended up releasing it. Now many of you think that you are Jarartokin,

[62:02] but most of you were not. It's actually just very bad. And so once you realize how high your

[62:08] standards really have to be in order to be excellent, when you then have this daunting realization,

[62:14] it is that you can only do shoot-of-forth things in your whole life because of how long it really

[62:20] takes to get to there. And so it's like I want to be the best author in the world. That's not a desire

[62:27] mine to be clear. But if I wanted to be the best author in the world that I know that that's going to take

[62:31] at least a decade of actually working hard every single day to get better. And believing that for me

[62:37] because I'm special I should somehow be able to be my first book as an overnight success and

[62:42] and and and that is the thing that changed you to mediocrity. It's believing that it should be a

[62:47] different way rather than accepting realities it is and then changing your actions as a consequence.

[62:51] And so this is also why lazy people distract themselves.

[62:59] Because distraction makes you believe the why that you can try a hundred things and then figure out

[63:06] which one works when the reality any of them can work but none of them will work unless you pick one

[63:11] to work on. And then that is you making it work. The vast majority of things with enough iteration can

[63:17] become success. It's just that people underestimate how many iterations they need to have. It's 19

[63:21] drafts not to. It's 500 minutes of editing to make the video not 50. It's making a thousand phone calls

[63:30] every week for two years not two months. And so most of the times it's just that our level of

[63:38] understanding it's it's here and this is where a lot of people get stuck. A lot of people get stuck here.

[63:44] They say I should be better. This should be easier. I've already paid a little bit. I said I was

[63:49] willing to pay 30. The Nike Store owner won't give me the shoes and then you can you basically

[63:53] are the same as this person you just have a price at that. I should. I should it should be I deserve.

[63:58] I am worth. Takes what it takes to cost what it costs. You got to be willing to make the trade.

[64:03] And if you're not willing to make the trade fine just don't complain. And so if you want to become

[64:06] that exception you want to make those trade off. You're willing to invest in skills and invest your time

[64:11] and do the repetitions and gain leverage to increase your output and are willing to move things

[64:16] from monthly to weekly weekly to daily daily to hourly and continue to pull forward your reality on a

[64:22] faster and faster pace. Then I think you'll love this video about how to get ahead of the 99% of people.

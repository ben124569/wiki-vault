[00:00] the decrease in price never equates to the corresponding increase in sales.

[00:05] I'll give you one hard learned example that I had.

[00:08] My employees two years ago,

[00:11] bidsden moaned about how they thought we were too expensive.

[00:15] Soulcrashing, right?

[00:17] Because they were like,

[00:18] our turn is 15% or at the moment, right?

[00:23] It's terrible.

[00:24] It's, it's, yeah, heartbreaking.

[00:27] And we had been there for like a year.

[00:29] They were like, I think we got a lower on price.

[00:31] So we said we're gonna go from 800 a week to 600 a week.

[00:34] That was gonna be our price drop.

[00:36] We had this big announcement, right?

[00:39] Big announcement.

[00:40] Super excited, not only that,

[00:41] we're gonna give a discount and add coaching services on top.

[00:44] So we're gonna give more for less.

[00:46] Just praise you over deliver.

[00:48] First off, I got complaints from clients

[00:51] because they were upset that they had paid more.

[00:54] Number two, I cut my profit by $400,000 a month

[00:58] and my turn remained this day.

[01:03] So that series of employees lost me $5 million.

[01:10] And you do not have to learn that lesson.

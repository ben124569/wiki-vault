## Full Transcript
[00:00] Alright, this video what I want to talk about is I just finished our strategic meeting and it was so apparent

[00:06] some of the new town that we brought in

[00:08] How much they were really driving growth in some of our companies and

[00:13] I want to talk about this because I think it's a single hardest thing that entrepreneurs face like every single entrepreneur has one problem

[00:19] They think they have multiple problems, but they have one problem and it's a people problem

[00:22] They don't know where to find good people number one number two

[00:26] They don't know how to hire and recruit those people number three

[00:30] They don't know how to manage those people number four. They don't have to grow and cultivate the talent right and so that entire process

[00:36] And by what really growing a business becomes after you get to probably about 10 to 30 million a year is when when ops

[00:43] Really start taking over

[00:45] Especially at 30. It's all about talent and

[00:48] I think I've said this before this is probably the biggest big is been the biggest bottleneck for me crossing 30 to a hundred

[00:53] Is was really understanding that right was understanding that it was all about the talent

[00:58] It's actually not about you and that can be really hard for your ego because you love being needed and that's like an

[01:04] Interpersonal need that we you know have from childhood whatever it is we didn't get hooked enough

[01:08] But like that need is something that is outside of the business the business doesn't require you the business should be able to run on its own

[01:15] And this is something that I shifted over time

[01:17] That being said it doesn't mean that you can't have the strategic vision for the business

[01:21] You know, it based those just stepped down for the first time after you know 30 years or whatever

[01:25] But but you're the actual doing the leading all that stuff over time

[01:29] The company becomes a company of companies right it becomes a conglomerate as you grow and so what I want to talk about

[01:35] Specifically today is how to find and know the difference between an A player and a B player or really an A player and everyone else and

[01:44] I can't really stress how

[01:46] Unbelievably important this is and the thing is is that we talked to entrepreneurs

[01:50] They're always like my teams awesome and you talk to say much winner your later and they're like

[01:53] Like that team was horrible this team's awesome and that's because we're a total optimists, right?

[01:57] That's that's just the reality of it if you can't look at someone on your team and be like

[02:01] I think this person's kind of weak or I think this person could be better

[02:04] Then you really have rose colored glasses on right and that's the hard part and I honestly this isn't this wasn't real for me

[02:11] Until I actually saw

[02:13] teammates of mine growing divisions of our companies without me doing it in ways that I had never thought of

[02:20] Once that happened it became real for me

[02:22] I think there's these these different steps in your entrepreneurial journey

[02:25] I mean the first one was one I remember the first person who did a sale for me. I cried

[02:28] I remember I cried because I heard about on the phone and they're like yeah, I sold two people today and I

[02:34] Had done every single sale for my business for like a year and a half it's just it was just no one could bring it in right

[02:40] And the answers other people can bring it in you're not special

[02:44] But I it wasn't real for me and as soon as this this girl did this I was like oh my god

[02:50] Like I don't have to I don't have to literally make the money

[02:53] Someone else can do this and I can actually start running the business and so is a huge breakthrough

[02:58] And there's obviously levels to this right and I think the level that I just recently had a breakthrough on was

[03:05] watching teammates actually grow the business

[03:08] Without me right and it's it's really special. It's really awesome

[03:11] So you're like that's awesome for you Alex why are you talking to me? Great question

[03:16] A players and be players so what I want to do is tell you quick story because I think it's perfect for illustration

[03:21] So we just recently promoted a brand manager for work companies and

[03:26] She was given the task of like hey, why don't you think about other revenue streams?

[03:31] It would possibly bring into the company and so she said I thought we should start in a parallel line because I'm getting lots of messages

[03:36] On social media about how we should have a parallel and I think that'd be good opportunity

[03:39] And so her her supervisor said I think it's a great idea go for it, right and so

[03:45] What she did was she emailed you know 20 different

[03:49] You know manufacturing companies for for a parallel

[03:53] She got samples from all of them

[03:55] She tried them all on she felt them and she showed up to the strategic meeting and she was like

[04:00] They were crap she was like I'm not sending that to my customers

[04:03] She said those exact words and

[04:05] I can't tell you what it felt like for me as an owner to hear that she said

[04:09] I'm not sending that to my customers and it was because it showed so much ownership and one of our core tenants is bureau and boss

[04:16] Which I'm switching to act like an owner, but that's exactly what she did and

[04:21] To push it even further she didn't just stop there and say all of stuff sucks because that would just be presenting a problem

[04:25] Instead she was like but I did find some

[04:28] Manufacturers that don't do manufacturing and fulfillment because some centers do both which is much more convenient for me as a business

[04:34] But he's like but their stuff is legit. It's awesome

[04:37] Just like so I just need help figuring out how how how how many pieces do you want to order as a baseline?

[04:42] I'll figure out logistics to get to a third-party fulfillment center so that we can do this a parallel

[04:46] And so we ended up coming to the solution for it and she felt great about it

[04:50] We looked at different you know designs and and with with the great quality we were gonna come up a solution

[04:55] But here's here's what I want to bring a break apart for you

[04:59] Imagine a normal person a beep be level employee

[05:03] Nothing wrong with them. There's lots of them, right?

[05:06] But they show up

[05:07] They do their job. They go right they don't take ownership because what what an alternative story of what would have happened

[05:14] Is the directors is hey, won't you look for new revenue opportunities and that person may or may not have done at level one right?

[05:21] Level two they actually do it and they say I think a pair. She says okay go check out a pair

[05:25] Now with that person probably would have done was look at the re-company's from a Google search

[05:31] Maybe or maybe not even sample the product

[05:34] Just look at the pricing and say hey, I found an apparel company

[05:38] We can print our logo on it. We can chip it out that is what it be player would have done and honestly

[05:43] Unless you have an a supervisor the a supervisor probably would have let it go and

[05:48] What and I'll tell you the difference the difference is?

[05:52] With the a scenario you have a high quality product that people buy enjoy and buy again and

[05:58] That massively increases the LTV the customer and on top of that that brain manager cares deeply about the customers and their experience

[06:06] And she's gonna be thinking top of mine. How do I make this easier? How do I make this faster? How can I improve their experience right? Where is the be player?

[06:15] You already lost them like oh, yeah, they don't like the t-shirts. I mean what do they expect right? I mean like they're a 30 dollar t-shirts

[06:22] I mean they're not gonna be you know XYZ and so

[06:28] That difference is the game and

[06:32] Finding people who think like that a player compared to people who think like the be player is

[06:38] the difference between companies that grow and companies that die companies that barely competed make it and companies that thrive

[06:45] And none of what I just described was earthshattering

[06:48] It was just a willingness to do more work and

[06:52] Raising the bar it was having a level of intolerance for anything but excellence

[06:57] And it is my belief that within a company hierarchy

[07:01] Every person the higher the person who runs the division or the department or the company

[07:08] Should always have the lowest amount of tolerance for anything but excellence

[07:12] Which means you should be intolerant of anything that is not amazing right and

[07:16] That trickles down it gets diluted right at every level. It's diluted a little bit more a little bit more a little bit more

[07:22] And if there comes a day where you see two people and you see a supervisor and you see someone underneath of that

[07:27] Supervisor and the person underneath has a has a lower tolerance for

[07:32] Anything but excellence then the supervisor those roles should reverse

[07:37] The person who cares the most should be the one in charge and

[07:40] So if there comes a day where someone cares more about my customers and the experience and the business that we have than I do

[07:46] They should rightfully run the company not me and sometimes entrepreneurs get to that point

[07:50] They have a CEO and they elect them because they're like I think that you're better equipped for this

[07:54] And I think that you care more deeply and that's okay

[07:55] And it happens right you know Phil Knight doesn't run Nike anymore

[07:59] But I mean shoot Jeff basis and you obviously stepped out for other reasons or whatnot

[08:03] But the big picture here is

[08:06] Having a level of intolerance for what an A versus a B looks like starts with us and the thing is is

[08:13] Whoever you hire most people only hire people worse than them and so if you're if you're one level removed or two levels removed

[08:21] Dear God imagine what you're what's what's being hired on the front line

[08:24] Right and so you have to carry this torch you have to raise this bar you have to set the standard

[08:30] So that A

[08:31] Players will be attracted to you and also so that you can have a team of A players and then the entire culture rises right if you've ever been on a winning team on

[08:39] Champion chip team

[08:40] You know the difference between the vibe how people come to practice how they play the expectations of one another

[08:47] Right the speed of response the team or all of that that's culture and that's only

[08:53] Created through having the right players on the field the right people on the bus and kicking off the wrong people and I'll end with this quote

[09:00] From the head of people for

[09:02] Chick-fil-A which is a company I admire a lot

[09:04] She said a lot of companies want to compete against us in the championship but the reality is they lost in the draft and

[09:12] That one really resonated with me because and I mean I'm paraphrasing here. That might not have been your title

[09:17] But that was what she said in general

[09:20] And that really struck me because

[09:23] So many of us are always trying to develop or always trying to develop talent. I'll try to do all these things management styles, et cetera

[09:27] But some people just come with batteries included. There are some people who are just winners, right?

[09:32] And you just need to get out of their way and

[09:35] I think that it's worth the extra five interviews

[09:38] It's worth the extra 20 interviews to find the a player because once that person is in place

[09:44] They will grow

[09:45] Right they will grow whatever they touch and

[09:48] This has been a deep lesson for me, which is what you know people are like it's all about people and it is

[09:52] It's just boring and unsexy for most entrepreneurs because we love the promotion

[09:56] We love the sales we love the marketing we live all that stuff

[09:58] Right we love the product but the people is what runs it and I think that this has been this has been a deep lesson for me

[10:06] And I hope I hope if you look at your team right now

[10:09] You don't think oh they're all amazing right because the reality is they're probably not right and

[10:13] Every single entrepreneur says that I can tell you right now some people that are weak on our team

[10:17] Right

[10:18] But you have to be honest about it and you have to think not just what are they doing?

[10:23] But what would I be doing in their position?

[10:25] What initiative would I be taking that they're not taking?

[10:28] What questions would I be asking that they're not asking?

[10:31] And

[10:32] Ideally you want someone who's asking questions that you haven't thought of and that's when you know you've got an

[10:37] A player so anyways this comes with time

[10:39] It comes with experience it comes with once you've seen an A player you can never unsee them

[10:43] And then you start to use that template to apply to other people

[10:46] All right, and so and then you repeat it over and over again

[10:49] And I think that's why entrepreneurs should take time like you grow you grow in levels

[10:53] You grow in tolerance you grow in interpersonal understanding you grow in awareness of other people and

[10:58] By as you grow in that awareness so too will your selection of talent so too will your recruitment of talent

[11:04] Your management and growth of those people so anyways hope that made sense hope that was valuable for you if you're hiring people only look for a players

[11:11] Put in the extra time to get the a player because it will pay you dividends beyond your wellness dreams

[11:16] And there was a Harvard study that showed that players were five times more than you players and with that how kids you do

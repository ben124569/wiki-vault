[00:00] In this video, I'm gonna talk to you about the 28 ways to stay poor.

[00:04] And the reason I'm framing it that way is because Charlie Munger, my personal hero, had a

[00:08] seminal talk that he gave multiple times on how to live him as real life.

[00:13] And the reason he gives it that way is that he believes in a process called inversion thinking,

[00:17] which is where you solve problems in reverse.

[00:19] So for example, if you want to have a good marriage rather than asking the question,

[00:23] how do I have a good marriage? You asked the question, how would it destroy my marriage?

[00:26] And then you list out all the ways to destroy your marriage and then you do the exact opposite of that.

[00:30] And what's interesting is that our brains are much better at finding problems than they are

[00:33] at finding solutions. And so what we do is we harness this innate ability that we have to find the

[00:38] problems and then after finding every possible problem we can imagine, every threat imaginable,

[00:43] which evolutionary we were designed to look for, then flip that in reverse to find our solutions.

[00:48] All right. And this is a process of thinking that I've applied to business, I've applied it to.

[00:52] Marards applied a lot of different aspects of my life and I would and I would encourage you to do it as well.

[00:55] But in this video, I'll talk about the 28 ways to stay poor. Hey, in the state tune to the end of the video,

[01:00] because at the very end, I'm going to give you the reverse of these to 28 rules of how not to be poor.

[01:05] I'll take all of these things that are worth them for you in one hard hitting

[01:09] blip that you will not want to miss. All right. And if you don't know how I am, my name is Oxfordmozie.

[01:12] I own acquisition.com to portfolio companies that deserve $100 million here.

[01:15] I make these videos because I have a lot of fun doing it and I hope you enjoy them as much as I enjoy

[01:19] making them for you. All right. So the first one, this is one of the best ways to stay poor and as a result

[01:25] by the way, so I know this entire little mini thread here got over 5,000 shares on my Twitter.

[01:32] And so that is why I decided to make this video because it seemed like a lot of you guys like that.

[01:35] Okay. So the first and best way to stay poor is to start tomorrow. So whatever it is that you want to

[01:40] do, whether it's losing weight, saving money, starting that business, whatever it is to start tomorrow.

[01:45] All right. So that's the best thing you can do to stay poor is to start tomorrow. Okay.

[01:49] The next one is to read lots of books and then do nothing. All right. Because it's one of the,

[01:54] you know, lots of people talk about reading books and I see people all the time that I've seen for

[01:57] years in the exact same position posting every, oh yeah, I'm reading 52 books this year. That's my

[02:01] of a commitment. Instead of reading 52 books, maybe just read one book and actually do something about it.

[02:05] Crazy. I know. Number three, take advice from poor people on how to be rich. All right. So think about that

[02:12] for a second. A lot of us surround ourselves or at least I did when I was starting out. Surround ourselves with

[02:16] people who are very poor and we listen to their advice on how to be rich and they have no idea what they are doing.

[02:23] And we also listen to their judgment on why our idea is stupid even though they are poor.

[02:29] So what would they know? So number three, take advice from poor people on how to be rich.

[02:32] Number four, this is a big one. Pick a spouse who will make you feel guilty for working.

[02:37] All right. So you have your dreams. You have these things you want to pursue. But this person is saying

[02:42] you shouldn't do that. You need to be doing X, Y and Z. Blop, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then you feel like

[02:46] you need to compromise your dreams to that person. The problem is that you put your power of your

[02:50] destiny in their hands and you're asking for permission instead of support. Right. Because then in the

[02:54] day if you don't accomplish your dreams and you did it because of them, who do you think you're going to

[02:58] resent? So you owe to yourself and you owe to your marriage to a pick people who are not who are going

[03:03] to support you in your dreams even if they don't necessarily great. Right. But more easily not

[03:08] put your power on somebody else. Right. Number five, fail once, quit forever. All right. So as soon

[03:14] as you do actually start to decide to decide doing something, you fail immediately and say, oh,

[03:18] I guess this isn't for me. I guess success is in for me. I guess businesses in for me. I guess sales isn't

[03:22] for me. I guess whatever the thing is isn't for me because you failed once. But it's because we have a

[03:26] we've an incorrect view of failure because failure is a necessary part and the thing is that you

[03:30] learn from failure. And so it's either you win or you learn. But that is the fifth thing you want to do

[03:34] if you want to stay poor forever. Number six is think that the world is fair. So a lot of us are

[03:40] get, you know, especially me earlier on, like I would complain. I would be like, that's not fair.

[03:44] This is fair. It shouldn't be this way. Blah, blah, blah, blah. And the thing is is that all that

[03:48] complaining that I did did nothing at all whatsoever. Did nothing. And so the thing is is there's no

[03:53] activity that comes from blaming your circumstances, which just so happens to be the seventh one of how

[04:00] to say, what was blame your circumstances and complain. All right. Complaining about things that you

[04:06] cannot control. And the thing is is like, these sound so obvious. But think about these in reverse again.

[04:11] So if the if the contrary of thinking the world is fair, it's assume the world is fair. It's unfair.

[04:16] Excuse me. Assume the world is unfair. And then act accordingly. Instead of blaming your circumstances,

[04:22] you think your circumstances for who you are and what they gave you. You are who you are because

[04:27] that you have gone through. Right? There's a there's a saying your message. And I think it's a very

[04:31] it's a very beautiful saying because how sad would it be to wish to have a life of ease and comfort?

[04:37] Because strong character is built through hard times. And so if we want to have strong character,

[04:42] we basically must have a hard life for periods of time or for seasons. And so we can't

[04:47] lament the thing that creates the outcome. You can't lament the heat and the beating of the hammer

[04:52] to strengthen the steel. Right? They go hand in hand. And so we just have to accept them for what they are.

[04:59] And as for complaining, I think you can just accept and move on. So number nine, I covered through

[05:05] number nine, expect the government to save you. All right? That's a great way to stay poor.

[05:09] Expect the government to save you or give us an expect other people to save you. And then reality is

[05:13] no one's going to save you except for you. And a lot of times, many people have spent their entire

[05:17] lives waiting around for someone to save them and still stay poor. Number 10, value the opinion of

[05:24] others over your own. It's an excellent way to stay poor. You think everyone else's opinions matter

[05:29] more than yours. And I'll give you a secret that it took me, you know, making a lot of money to

[05:33] then realize, which is your successful, the moment you say you are crazy, right? Like you are successful,

[05:39] the moment that you decide you are successful. There are people who are billionaires who don't

[05:43] feel like they're successful. And there are people who have almost no money and absolutely think that

[05:47] they're an amazing success. And the thing is is that they are both right. It's our choice. And I can promise

[05:52] you that if you try and give yourself a number, you will just move the goal post. I promise you that

[05:56] from the depth of my soul, you will move the number and make something else than your goal. And once that,

[06:01] once I am rich, then whatever. But it's a win-than-fallicy. It doesn't, it's not true. So you can accept

[06:07] and you can become successful today because if you look at yourself, compare to people in a much

[06:12] worse off scenario, they would love to have your life. And so you just need to decide for yourself

[06:17] if you are successful. The thing is to success is a process rather than an outcome. And so you can be

[06:21] successful in that you are living your values of pursuit that can make an success if you choose to

[06:26] so number 11, way to stay poor. Avoid discomfort. A lot of us, you know, we have new things,

[06:33] you have to take risks, you have to learn things and it's uncomfortable because you will suck.

[06:36] Right? Of course you will suck. It's normal to suck. But people avoid discomfort because they don't

[06:40] want to go through that. And it's so silly. The discomfort that they're feeling is the judgment

[06:44] they impose upon themselves about not being good at something they'd never done before. How insane is

[06:48] that? Very. And that's why humans aren't also kind of insane. When you think about the things that

[06:53] we do and the things that we think. And so great way to stay poor is to avoid discomfort of all kinds.

[06:57] You also guarantee the number one discomfort which is that you don't accomplish what you want in your

[07:00] life. 12. How to stay poor. Tolerate, mediocrity from yourself and others. All right. So as you

[07:06] start to grow, if you're growing, you know, a small business or even in the workplace, if you tolerate

[07:12] mediocrity from others, you will forget more mediocrity. And people over time will just degrade and get

[07:18] worse and worse over time. Rather than the reverse of that, a thing like I will only tolerate

[07:23] excellence. And anything below that is intolerable. If you think about the best leaders in the best

[07:27] CEOs and the most successful people of all time, they have this innate trait for lack of

[07:31] literature and their ballbusters. They hold a standard that, and here's the catch, that they themselves

[07:37] stay above. Which means you must raise your own standards so that you can model what it looks like

[07:42] for other people around you to hold themselves. The best, like, most people are going to be

[07:46] less people need a model and they can see that. Right. And you're leading by example. And so

[07:51] best thing to do is stay poor, tolerate mediocrity from yourself and others. 13. How to stay poor.

[07:56] Make promises? Break promises. So you make promises to yourself and you make promises to other people.

[08:01] And you both, you destroy your reputation with other people. And that's a terrible thing. And it takes

[08:05] a long time to fix that. But the one that's the hardest one to fix is the reputation you have with

[08:09] yourself. You make promises to yourself and you break promises to yourself. Because the thing is that

[08:12] you were the only one who's holding you accountable. And I think a different version of happiness

[08:17] in my opinion is respect for oneself. And I think your own respect is the hardest to earn because

[08:22] you know how hard you could have pushed. You know if you could have gone for an extra mile.

[08:26] You could have shut up to the gym more times. You could have eaten better. You could have made

[08:30] more pull calls. You could have done more reach out. You could have made more content. You could have

[08:33] actually done a left a nice note for somebody on your team when you, when you were too tired to do so.

[08:39] You could have over-delivered on the product. You could have made a better version of that video.

[08:43] You decided to put it up anyways. Even though you knew it wasn't as good as it could have been.

[08:46] And so you make promises to yourself and then you break promises yourself and you lose respect

[08:50] in the process. It's an excellent way to stay poor. In the 14, wait for perfect conditions.

[08:55] All right. This is a great one. Great way to stay poor is one of my favorites. You got to wait

[09:00] for everything to be perfectly aligned for you to be successful. And here's the secret.

[09:04] There are never going to be perfect conditions. And here's what's even crazier.

[09:07] If you need perfect conditions to be successful, the moment the conditions change,

[09:11] you will stop being successful. So you might as well start when the conditions are

[09:14] their absolute worst because it means that they will only get better from there. And if you can

[09:17] prove success when things get bad, when they get bad again, which is guaranteed,

[09:22] you will still remain successful because you have learned how to do it in this time.

[09:26] In the circumstance. Makes sense? Great reason. Do not wait for perfect conditions.

[09:31] 15. Prioritized looking rich over being rich. This is a classic one of poor folks in general.

[09:37] I get the loving amount of troll comments that I get from the fact that I'm in my

[09:40] mom's basement and wearing a wife feeder and wearing a no-strip must mean that I am poor. Of course.

[09:46] Right? Because you confuse looking rich with being rich. Right? Just silly. You can just go

[09:50] go my name and just put private equity and at Jim launch an American Pacific group and you can

[09:56] see what we sold to our businesses for. So the point is you have to prioritize being rich,

[10:00] which means spending less for a long period of time because you were not valuing the opinion

[10:05] of other people over your own, which because you respect your own approval more than that of other

[10:10] people. You have to be willing to die to the opinion of others rather than dying to the opinion of yourself.

[10:14] And I mean that. It's real shit. Stop trying to look rich. Be willing to look poor.

[10:19] All right? And I know that's contrary to like dress the part and all that stuff. But like the thing is is

[10:22] like you've got to be real to you. Or you'll be real to know one. That's a promise.

[10:27] 16. Avoid working on what matters most. This is a great way to stay poor.

[10:32] Is that you work all day long. You're busy. You're full of activity. You're doing stuff.

[10:37] And nothing important moves for it because the nature of speed is not about activity. The people who

[10:43] were the richest of the world aren't doing the most stuff. They're doing the right stuff. Right?

[10:46] They're making sure better stated, making sure the right stuff gets done in general, whether or not

[10:50] it's them or someone else. And so it's looking at the many things that you can or could do

[10:56] and picking the very few that are the ones that move the needle the most. And typically they're

[11:00] the ones that you do not want to do and you are procrastinating on. You can probably limit it all

[11:04] the stuff that you that give you the mental masturbation of getting stuff done without actually

[11:09] moving the ball forward towards your goals. So it's a great way to stay poor. It's just keep doing

[11:14] stuff that does not matter. 17. Say you're going to do something and then don't do it. This is just

[11:19] like making breaking promises to others and stuff. But this one is actually just like that. So take

[11:26] 18. This is a really good one. Great way to stay poor is do what everyone else is doing. Right?

[11:31] Because if you're doing what everyone else is doing, most people are not in the 1%. If you want to

[11:35] be in the 1% you can't do what 99% of people are doing, which is hard for people, which is why

[11:40] you can't value their opinions because again, talking to poor people about how to get rich is a

[11:44] great way to say poor. Right? They have no idea. And so you can't look for their approval on what you

[11:50] are doing or model what everyone else is doing because everyone else is poor. Why model them?

[11:55] Right? Think about. Number 19. Do you are best? Not what it takes. Because the round is a lot

[12:00] times your best makes suck and what is required is what is required and that may be beyond you.

[12:05] Which means you must become better so that your best is beyond what is required. Because the

[12:10] number of people who say why tried my best. The universe doesn't give a shit. The marketplace doesn't

[12:14] give a shit. Your boss doesn't give a shit. What they care about is what is required. And so what you

[12:18] have to do is figure out what is required and then if you are incapable of doing it, be better.

[12:22] And do it for long enough that it would be unreasonable for you not to be good. And then your best

[12:26] will surpass what is required and you will become better in the process. But if you don't do that

[12:31] it's an excellent way to stay poor. Just keep doing your best and giving yourself pal the back and say,

[12:35] I tried. 20. Talk more. Do less. Post about your goals. Post about your affirmations.

[12:40] Spend all day doing routines and stuff. Of getting prepared to work and actually do very little.

[12:46] All right. It's a great way. This is one of the favourites especially in the internet community.

[12:50] People love talking about how much they're working rather than actually getting shit done. So I would

[12:55] advise you to rather than spend all this time preparing to work and creating superstitions and

[13:00] routines around the things that you think you should do in order to maybe potentially get something done.

[13:05] Start with the doing. Sometimes the doing just needs done. All right. 21. Start something new today.

[13:11] Start something new tomorrow. Repeat. Great way to stay poor. Do stuff. Try something.

[13:16] Try something else. Try something else. Try something else. Always leave half built bridges.

[13:21] Right? You never complete anything new start. Just keep starting new things because it's exciting

[13:26] and it's new and you have what is called uninformed optimism because as soon as you jump into

[13:31] the new thing you realize that it will take work and the things that were awesome about it

[13:35] also have downsides which is the work that is required to be good and as soon as you realize that

[13:40] you go through the change cycle you go uninformed optimism to informed pessimism and then you go

[13:46] through the value of despair and this is where everyone jumps to the next opportunity and they just

[13:50] do this forever and they just never achieve what they want. So it's an excellent way to stay busy

[13:55] and poor. All right. Just keep trying new stuff and never see anything through. Okay? Number 22.

[14:01] Believe what other people think about you more than what you think about you. All right. It's a great

[14:05] way to stay poor. I think it's just it's easily stated there so I'm not going to belabor the point

[14:09] but that's what you need to do to stay poor. Just keep believing whenever everyone else thinks about you

[14:13] and I'll let you think about you. Excellent way to do it. Number 23. Wait to stay poor. Make a mistake.

[14:19] Then wait. Repeat the mistake. Do it again and again and again and you've probably seen people

[14:25] who stay stuck in their life like this like they keep dating the same person. They keep making

[14:28] the same business mistake. They keep getting the same bad partnerships. Whatever. Right? Or they keep

[14:32] trying to do something that stopped working and they keep doing it over and over again because they

[14:36] think that for some reason that's going to work somehow or they just don't have the wherewithal to

[14:40] realize they keep making the same mistake. And so if you keep doing the same stuff you're going to

[14:43] keep getting the same outcomes. Right? Like we kind of know this but the thing is is that people still do it.

[14:48] That's like whatever you're doing right now is gotten you to being poor. So don't do that. Right?

[14:54] And why I say poor poor can be whatever you want it to be. You could be a billionaire and be poor. It might

[14:57] be whatever whatever that amount is. It's not as much as you want it to be. Right? Which of course gets

[15:02] into the deep things if like maybe you should decide not to want it to begin with and then

[15:05] whatever. We won't get into that. Number 24. Be replaceable. All right? This is a great way to stay poor because

[15:11] if I heard this from Navarro, I'll kind of like it a lot which is if you can if you can get a degree to do the job,

[15:17] you're never going to be on a wealthy doing it because everyone can do it. Right? And so you have to be

[15:20] able to learn things that other people can't do. Right? And that they're in makes you irreplaceable

[15:26] or less replaceable. Right? The very least last replaceable. You want to be replaceable by a marketplace

[15:31] of people lined up behind you ready to take your job and do it for less. All right? Because they're

[15:35] also poor. And they are willing to do it for less which is a terrible way to do business. It's also an

[15:39] excellent way to stay poor though. Do whatever one else is doing, do it for less. Unless you have an operational

[15:43] strategy which is like more more than whatever. And that's probably not you right now. So number 25.

[15:48] Way to stay poor. Find something that works. Do your god. Find something that works and then stop

[15:53] doing it. Think about it. How many of you have needed to make money last minute. You had to pay

[15:59] roll yet if he taxes. You had to some bill unexpected, you know, surgery, iPhone, whatever. Right?

[16:05] Some bill comes up and you need to pay for it. And you find a way to make the money because if you're

[16:09] watching this video you're still alive. Right? So you found a way to you found a way to pay for it.

[16:13] What did you do there? When you needed to make money. You're interested in me messed up.

[16:17] You were willing to make money and you had the ability to make money when it was for someone else

[16:21] and not for yourself. Think about that. You had the ability. You knew what to do and you just

[16:28] chose not to do it. You stopped doing it as soon as you paid someone else's bills because you

[16:31] were willing to pay other people's bills in that era. Interesting. Which leads me to one of the

[16:36] most of your tweets I had recently which is most people know what to do to achieve their goals.

[16:40] Most people do know what to do. People are like, I don't know how to lose weight. My get you do.

[16:43] Stop eating shit and move. You know how to do that. You want to make money? Start making calls.

[16:49] Start reaching out to people. Start promoting the thing that you were trying to sell.

[16:52] Not, I mean, not complicated. I got this thing. Do you want to try it? No, cool.

[16:56] Talk to somebody else. Got this thing. You want to try it? No, cool.

[16:58] Awesome. Yeah. It's not a complex. It's not complicated. But people just don't do it.

[17:03] It's because they're not willing to do it. Right? And so, actually thing to do,

[17:07] find something that works. A lot of you do know something that works and then stop doing it.

[17:11] Number 26. We're round enough. We got two more. Higher, dumb people.

[17:16] Excellent way to stay poor and have a bad business. All right. Really, really highly recommend.

[17:20] It's also really good for if you have a job too. If you have the ability to hire people,

[17:23] hire dumb people. It's just, it's just a great way to make your life miserable. There's very few ways

[17:27] that are better than this one. Like, if you just want to be surrounded by dumb people, just hire people.

[17:31] You know, I mean, you'll feel good, but you'll be poor. And so, don't do that.

[17:39] Number 27. Is a huge one that I see all the time for staying poor and it's a really good strategy.

[17:43] It might be one of the top ones on this list. Assume you are always right. How many people

[17:49] you're watching this? No, someone who always just think they're right and they're not successful.

[17:54] They get advice from somebody who might be successful or more successful than them. And they're like,

[17:58] no, that's not going to work for X-Y and Z because they just do them. They know everything.

[18:02] Well, if you know everything, then why aren't you achieving what you want? And I will tell you this.

[18:06] From the people that I have met who have been far ahead of me, they have a voracious desire to learn.

[18:12] And a voracious interest in learning from anyone and every single possible source they can.

[18:16] And those people have the humility to say that everyone knows something that they don't know.

[18:20] And so in that way, they can learn of them, which is I think an ever-sync quote.

[18:24] If you cannot learn, then what's the point? So you give yourself zero advantages. Like, there's no way

[18:30] that you can learn from other people if you think you're always right. And I know this sounds fucking obvious,

[18:34] but a lot of you guys do this. Why? Like, you'd rather be right than be rich. And it's silly.

[18:40] But it's an actual way to stay poor. So that's why it's number 27. And then the last one, and this is the simplest

[18:45] of the economics around it. And I'm just going to drive this baby home is make money, period,

[18:50] spend more than you make. And the beautiful part about this is that it doesn't matter how much you make.

[18:55] If you spend more than it, you can be poor, which is why this is such a great one. It's a great way to stay

[18:59] poor. It's no matter how much you increase your income. Just spend more than you made. Right? Go into debt.

[19:04] And adjust your lifestyle to your new income at all times or rather above your income, so that you can

[19:10] always stay poor no matter how much money you make. It's just an awesome way to stay poor.

[19:14] That's why I highly recommend doing that. All right. Just, and honestly, the more you can do it,

[19:18] the more you can outspend your income, the poor you will be. And so again, highly recommend it.

[19:24] And it sounds silly, but you know, like right now, I think it's like the bottom 50% of America,

[19:28] like doesn't have any savings. And which crazy is it like you can control, like these these things are

[19:34] controllable. Like you can always downgrade your lifestyle. But the thing is you care more about the

[19:37] opinions about there's new you to a drone, right? You can remember more about looking rich than being rich.

[19:41] All these things, and that's why all of these things go together. And so, to wrap this up,

[19:45] the reason that inversion thinking is so powerful is that we can use our brains to find threats

[19:50] more easily than we can find solutions. And so if we think about your business career,

[19:54] or when you think about your marriage, or you think about your body, or you think about whatever it

[19:58] is, your money goals, think about the ways to destroy it. I just gave you 28 different ways that you can

[20:02] be poor. When you reverse them and you make those the rules for living that you have,

[20:07] then what happens is you succeed by accident because you avoid the pitfalls.

[20:11] Because the thing is, is if you don't make many mistakes, you succeed without trying. Because all

[20:16] you're doing, it's just focusing on just not making these stupid mistakes that most people do.

[20:19] Right? If we, if we were to reverse these, and this is what I'm going to hit this with hard,

[20:23] enjoy, we're hitting it right now. Start today, read books, do the stuff that's in the books,

[20:28] take advice from rich people on how to be rich. Pick a spouse who makes you feel awesome about

[20:33] working. Fill once, try again. Think the world is unfair and act accordingly. Never blame your

[20:39] circumstances. Think your circumstance is for making you who you are. Instead of complaining,

[20:44] do something. Expect no one to save you except for yourself. Value your opinion over those of

[20:50] other people. Seek out discomfort. Tolerate nothing but excellence. Make promises, keep promises.

[20:57] Wait for the worst conditions. Wait for imperfect conditions and act anyways on what you want.

[21:03] Right? Avoid working on the stuff that doesn't matter. Work on the things that matter most,

[21:08] ignore the rest. Say you're going to do something and then do it. Do what no one else is doing. Do

[21:14] your best and make it above what it takes to be successful. Talk less, do more. Start something

[21:22] new today and keep at it until you are good. Do it so long that it would be unreasonable for

[21:28] you to be bad. Don't believe what other people think about you more than what you think about yourself.

[21:33] Be irreplaceable. Find something that works and don't stop doing it. Keep doing it until

[21:39] your board out of your mind because you're so good at doing that thing that worked. Higher, smart

[21:44] people. Assume that you are always wrong and be willing to learn and make money and spend less

[21:50] than you make. And that is the 28 rules of poverty flipped on its head and you can make your own

[21:54] conclusions about where that'll take you. I love you, Mosin, Aixine, keep being awesome. I'll see you

[21:57] guys next video. Bye!

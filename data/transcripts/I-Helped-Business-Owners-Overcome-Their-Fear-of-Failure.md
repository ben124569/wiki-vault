[00:00] What are you afraid of?

[00:01] I'm scared that I'll fail at the goal.

[00:03] Then you can judge how successful you were by how much you had heard to the actions that you committed to.

[00:10] So I run the writing company I write for celebrities and CEOs because I took your advice and I started writing for people that have more money.

[00:19] And it's gosh.

[00:20] So I'll phrase people problems, I pay better.

[00:22] Yes. But I also publish my own books.

[00:26] And I traditionally publish with publishers and I have done really well.

[00:30] But in the future, going forward I want to publish my own book, self-pullished my own book.

[00:36] But I have analysis paralysis because there's so many options to execute a strategy.

[00:43] Sometimes I don't know which option to pick to just execute the strategy from my next book.

[00:48] And my first goal is just to sell 1,000 ebook copies. Not enough things even grand.

[00:52] Yeah. Okay. Then when I settle on a strategy, I get scared because I don't know if it's going to work.

[00:59] So two questions real quick. So when you say you have so many different strategies you can pick from.

[01:02] We talk about different topics for the book. Is that what you're saying?

[01:04] I know the book topic but different options to execute a plan.

[01:08] So I can use quick, quick funnels to execute a plan to sell a thousand.

[01:11] You're just selling it. Yeah, just selling the thousand copies.

[01:15] That's my goal. I want to be able to sell a thousand copies for my next self-pullished book.

[01:19] Have you read the book yet? Are you reading the book yet?

[01:21] No. But the book will be. That's an easy part.

[01:24] I'm writing it. So that's an easy part. Okay. Okay. Yeah.

[01:28] You're asking the universe for a guarantee that it will never give you.

[01:31] And you're waiting for a response in order to move forward from a universe that stays silent.

[01:37] And so you're just talking to dead people and waiting for a response.

[01:42] The thing is, the person you should be talking to is the marketplace because they will always respond.

[01:47] Like when you knock, they will open the door and they will tell you to fuck off or they

[01:50] open the door and they'll tell you they'll let you in. But either way they'll open the door.

[01:53] Right. Let's play this out the other way. What do you freight of?

[01:57] Because like you seem very upbeat and you sit like obviously you've written this, you've written stuff before.

[02:01] And so like I'm not worried about your writing so you'll give it what you've said so far.

[02:04] So like what do you freight of? Okay. So let's let's play it out. So let's say you have your book

[02:09] and you pick path one. It doesn't matter what it is. Pick path one. Okay. So what so what happens?

[02:13] So you put on an Amazon. You're like I'm just gonna put on an Amazon and see what happens. All right. That's the easy path.

[02:17] Okay. Then what? Yeah. I'm scared that I won't reach my number. I'm scared that I'll fail at the goal.

[02:25] And then then what happens? But then I still won't know how to do it.

[02:28] Like and I'm also scared because I have self-published a couple books in the past that did reach my goal.

[02:35] And I know that feels like I don't want to feel like that again. Yeah. So let me so let me do this then.

[02:40] Let's reframe this because I have a lot of experience with setting goals. All right. So I feel

[02:43] pretty confident talking about the topic. Make the big goals that you set, things that you can

[02:47] absolutely control. Like you cannot control how many people I have your book. But you can control

[02:53] the amount of actions that you're willing to take that make it unreasonable that you don't sell

[02:56] a thousand copies. And so then you can judge how successful you were by how much you had

[03:01] heared to the actions that you committed to. And so if I were to say you have to sell 10,000 books,

[03:08] not a thousand books, 10,000 books. You have to where you lose your life in 12 months. You just die.

[03:15] That's it. You die. What would you do? The back on your own. Okay. You have the leads book.

[03:21] Right? You, they're all that there's eight different ways to advertise. Right? And so you know that

[03:24] the more people find out about yourself, the more people buy it. And you know there's only four things you can do.

[03:29] Right? You can talk to people on a one. You can make content you run ads. Right? Or you can get

[03:32] other affiliates. You can get referrals once they reach a book. Or you can get agencies. Or you can

[03:36] get employees that I'll be on. So what you got? Yeah. Okay. And so if you know that you have to take

[03:41] those actions, then wouldn't success be. So let's play this out of year. Let's say that you did

[03:49] absolutely everything on the plan. Like your plan of advertising, of letting people know about it

[03:54] four year. And you did everything. And you sold 999 books. Would you consider it a failure?

[04:00] No, that would be a win. Okay. Now if you sold 90 books, I just want to reframe this because the

[04:06] honestly, the thing that you're talking about is something that so many people deal with. And

[04:10] it's because you want to control things. You want to control the outcome and you're saying I'm only

[04:14] willing to pay this price if there's this outcome. But you're seeing the outcome as the outcome

[04:18] rather than the skills that you develop along the way as the outcome. Because I can promise you this.

[04:22] This will not be the last book you write. Right? And so if you get to a hundred sales instead of

[04:28] a thousand, then what's going to happen realistically is that you will figure out the one thing or

[04:33] two things that actually work to sell books. And then I'll say do a hundred times more of that.

[04:39] And you can either choose to do that on this book or you can choose to do it on the next book.

[04:43] But the idea of like I'm setting this out because you could have said a million books. It doesn't

[04:47] really matter. You're just setting it. You're making up a number and saying this, I feel it is

[04:49] reasonable for me. But instead of making the number reasonable, make the actions that would lead to that,

[04:55] the reasonable thing. Like what can you commit to for hours a day of promotion?

[05:00] Yeah. Okay. Then make that the commitment. And I will promise you that if you do that every day,

[05:06] one at the end of the year, you will feel accomplished because you actually did what you said you were

[05:10] going to do. And I will tell you that the marketplace will also always recognize someone who puts

[05:15] for us or every single day into one thing. Just where I need it. Thank you. Just promise me that you'll

[05:20] actually just commit to doing the work. If you do that, you do like I have to get sell 10,000 books.

[05:26] What I actually do to do that? Find somebody who has an audience that is relative to the topics

[05:31] that you're talking about and reach out to that. Now it's okay if I got one person, they sold 20

[05:36] books. Okay. How do I reach out to 1,000 people? You all have my audience. If you do that, you'll probably

[05:42] sell more than 1,000 books. But you just got to do it for hours every day. Thank you. Thank you.

[05:48] Good luck with the book. I know how much work goes into that. So I have two topics that I kind of want

[05:53] to treat with you. You title this advice for hard days. It's been tough lately. About three months

[06:00] ago, my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer. Two months ago, my girlfriend, the girl that I

[06:08] told was going to marry, kind of left. Then two weeks ago, I traveled to London to speak at

[06:14] Europe's biggest business event. And on the first day of my arrival, my granddad passed away.

[06:23] I had to basically speak in front of thousands of people and keep my smile and then travel back and

[06:30] bury him. And so yesterday, I did. I did. I did all of it. And so the question is, well,

[06:37] you know, yesterday, I everything just kind of hit me because now I'm back in the office and I'm

[06:41] making the calls and I'm trying to deal with everything. But the question is, how do I maintain my

[06:46] composure and kind of stay strong? Because it's a tough period. Well, first off, I'm sorry that you're

[06:53] going through that. That being said, honestly, you've got a lot of good stuff going for you. So this is

[06:57] a, I feel like almost a relatively easier one for me to take, given what you just said. Like, you just

[07:02] asked a question, how do I do something I've already done before? Which is, you got in front of a

[07:05] thousands of people and gave a presentation and how to smile and you crushed it. Despite the fact that

[07:11] you had other circumstances, right? And so you asked the question, how do I do something that I already

[07:16] have done? You've already done it. Like, what you're saying is, how do I keep living? And you keep

[07:23] living by keeping living? It's the same thing with breakups, right? It's like, I've heard this quote

[07:29] and I heard it from Layla, I think the first time. Like, the amount of time it takes you get over someone,

[07:34] do you know how long it is? There's a math equation for it. There's a great math equation for it.

[07:39] You'll love it. It's exactly as long as you decide it takes. And what I'm going to say is

[07:44] going to sound really dark right now. So I want you to take this the right way. Take the way, I mean it.

[07:47] All right, which is that you just had, you had three deaths, right? You had death of a life that you thought

[07:52] you're going to have with a girlfriend and then you had the death of two different grandparents,

[07:57] right? You're three deaths. But, well, on the positive sides of my grandmother is still

[08:02] about the liquid. Oh, okay, she's still bad. Wait, we're, we're, we're, we're plus one. All right,

[08:06] so only two deaths now. But sure, we can even play it out. All right, on a long enough time,

[08:10] rising, she will eventually pass away, right? It's going to happen. Yeah. And the thing is,

[08:15] is that you are already standing it. Like you're asking how do I stand it, but you are standing here.

[08:21] Already, like you are evidence to the fact, you are, you, you, you talking to me today is evidence

[08:27] of the success that you're asking for. You're already one dude, you're showing up in your work

[08:32] in every day. You come in here to ask questions. They actually still trying to grow yourself. Like

[08:36] the stuff that you go through become the stories that you will someday tell. And no one likes epic

[08:40] heroes without epic monsters. And so you have to go through the rocky cuts. And you have to have those

[08:45] periods of time where you doubt yourself, what everyone else doubts yourself, where the walls are

[08:49] crumbling around you. Because if you ever read Shudog, feel a nice story about Nike, even if you

[08:53] have it, the entire story is just him getting kicked in the nuts for 30 years. That's the whole story.

[08:59] And then he's like, oh, yeah, then I built Nike, right? And now if he just said, yeah, um, I started

[09:04] this company and everyone loved it. And all my suppliers were on time. And I just scaled straight

[09:10] and as the money came in, I just bought more inventory and then we just went public. No one would care

[09:16] because it's not relatable. And the thing is, is that when you die, the only thing that will remain

[09:20] is the story that people will tell of you. And so wouldn't you want that to be an epic story?

[09:24] Yeah. And so the things that you're going through are required for the person you want to be

[09:29] and for the goals that you have and how you are acting in the present already proves the thing that

[09:34] you're claiming that you want. Tomorrow you're going to wake up and you're going to work.

[09:39] And the next day you're going to wake up and you're going to work and then you're going to text

[09:41] and it's going to say that you're going to get back to work. You're just going to keep doing the

[09:47] stuff. Like there's no magic bullet. You just keep going. Because either you keep going or you die.

[09:55] Yeah. And if you don't die, you succeeded. I would just say stop, just don't judge yourself

[10:02] on how you feel. Judge yourself by what you do despite how you feel. So you can feel shitty.

[10:08] You can wake up and have a terrible day and still show up with a smile in front of the thousand

[10:13] people. And so if you can do it, the thousand people you can do with one. And that first one is the

[10:18] person that looks at you in the mirror in the morning. And now when it comes to business, I just have

[10:22] a real quick question. So I built a Instagram audience over a hundred thousand. I speak about

[10:29] sales and marketing. I've been doing it for the past two years. I've been posting kind of like

[10:34] every day. I know the content game, but the one thing that I'm struggling to balance is,

[10:39] you know how you say give, give, give until they ask. And you know, I love it. But sometimes

[10:45] it takes a while until they ask. Right. And cash flows till needs to come in. And I run a

[10:51] service-based business. And so how do I balance it out without tiring my all these? Because I also,

[10:58] my community is known for, you know, really being in the comments chatting with me and being

[11:03] there for me. So how do I do it? So if you want to have a one step away from like just giving forever.

[11:09] Right? Is that you, you give in public selling private? Which is when people respond to your stories.

[11:15] Right? When people DM you, like those are conversations that they're usually asking or they're like

[11:20] they're basically asking when people ask questions, you can still define a scope and say, hey, like

[11:26] at a certain point I have like, I've given you all this value. You'd use all the free stuff. If you

[11:30] want more than that, it'd be happy to hop on a call and see if I can help you more. Right? So it's not,

[11:34] it's not like everyone buy this thing right now. Right? You're not like getting super aggressive.

[11:39] You still publicly just keep pumping all the goodwill in the value that you are and that'll

[11:43] grow your audience and increase goodwill in all those things. That's what you want. You're going to

[11:47] it's just that you could still have a call to action that's just in the in the in the

[11:51] comment section or put a story up that says, hey, by the way, if you need help with that thing,

[11:56] I'm happy to help. Like those are those are very light touch things. Because I understand you got

[12:00] a pay bills. I understand that. And so you can put those things out without necessarily damaging the

[12:05] goodwill that I think you're that you're obviously building. To hang in there, you'll be fine.

[12:09] You'll get through it and then it'll be a story that you'll send me to tell.

[12:12] Yeah, and thank you for everything that you do not just for me, but for everyone else. Because I think

[12:16] you're marking a new path. And that's that's kind of cool.

[12:20] I appreciate your work. Thank you. What's the one question that you wish you would have asked yourself

[12:26] earlier in your entrepreneurial career when faced with a little bit of uncertainty and direction?

[12:32] 90% of my business is in person online. That's the kind of the direction of whether or not

[12:37] I really want to go towards. More specifically, you know, creating almost like a

[12:43] one-to-five version of kettlebells. Just trying to figure out what the next step is going to be.

[12:48] So me asking myself a question is always going to be different than you asking something for you.

[12:52] Because we're different people. And we have different goals. And so everything usually ladders up

[12:56] to like, what's the goal? What's the why? And so like right now, do you have like a monetary goal?

[13:01] Do you have an impact goal? And believe me, I have no issues if you're like, I just want to make a

[13:04] certain amount of money. Like I get that. Because any of the businesses that you just mentioned,

[13:07] so whether it's the brick and mortar business or you want to start doing training for those people online,

[13:13] or it's doing the WTF version, which is basically no service and just providing workouts and whatnot.

[13:18] All of those are our potential businesses, but pursuing all of them at the same time will virtually

[13:23] guarantee that you don't succeed at any of them. And so the biggest issue when you're starting out

[13:28] is just picking the path and being willing to commit to it with the uncertainty that comes with it.

[13:33] Because like every entrepreneur path has uncertainty. Like, and that's what makes entrepreneurship

[13:37] part. It's literally the not knowing. And the pain of suffering consequences for ignorance.

[13:42] For things that you've learned now that you're like, if I had only known then what I know now,

[13:45] and that's every entrepreneur until the day they die. And it's just wishing that it were different.

[13:49] That causes a lot of the struggle. So which of these things of the three that I just mentioned?

[13:53] Like, which of those is the one that likes you up the most? I mean in-person training, obviously,

[13:58] like we live in a small beach-time community where everybody knows everybody and it's fun.

[14:02] Well, it's family, it's convenient. I will say there's that comfort factor that

[14:06] it almost in one scope is very beneficial because it is so comfortable.

[14:11] But in reality, it's good like comfort is the enemy of achievement and growth. So it's like,

[14:15] I know like the comfortable side is the in-person and it's the community and it's fun and family

[14:20] friends. Whereas the uncomfortable, more challenging, but also very big picture-wise would be the

[14:26] online. It's going full tilt that side. Now, I've breached into the gap of like three-day launchers

[14:32] for the launchers of small ticket, low ticket offers, but in terms of trying to scale and

[14:38] make an impact on the world. The world's really big. That's always really hard. As I remember,

[14:42] I had a, we had an event with Jim owners and somebody stood up. I said, what's your mission? They're like,

[14:46] I want to impact one million lives. So I was like, did you have a brick and mortar location that

[14:49] has like 200 members? Like, let's, like if you really want to do that,

[14:54] then you would actually just, you would approach it very differently or you'd have a time rise

[14:58] and that's the rest of your life. Right? It's like one of the other. If you're like, I want to do that in three

[15:02] years, you wouldn't start with a brick and mortar location. And so the thing is, is that what you said

[15:05] earlier is like, you feel comfortable and it sounds like you want to grow. I just want to make sure

[15:08] that's correct before I like you'd go on. Okay. So there was like an underlying assumption at

[15:13] least that was unspoken and I just want to draw attention to it, which was, you're like, the brick and

[15:18] mortar thing is comfortable. It's family. It's friendly. It's fun. I'm assuming it's profitable. I'm

[15:21] assuming you're making somebody doing that. The thing is, is like, you could, like, just doing more

[15:25] of what you're currently doing and saying like, how do I open a second location or how do I,

[15:29] you know, like, how do I open like five locations over the next five years or whatever it is?

[15:34] That would produce probably just as much of a challenge as going online would. Except you

[15:38] already have two years of learnings on how to run that business where you have none in the online space.

[15:44] You always just want to stack knowledge within a specific vertical so that you just go deeper and

[15:49] deeper on it because that's where the compounding returns happen. Like the richest people that I know

[15:52] have been in the same space for 40 years. They just know everything there is to know about this space. And

[15:56] like that's how they've made their money. You can either open a location that's not necessarily

[16:00] and it's you've beached down and test your metal and see how good you are. It's actually scaling a team,

[16:05] you know hiring somebody else, seeing if somebody else, if you can actually incentivize people,

[16:08] build a culture so that people want to work for you that you can recreate the success. And that'll

[16:13] show you whether the success that you had was because of you or because of your ability as a, as a

[16:18] business man. Right? Because like you can be a charismatic, razzled, as old dancing bear in any brick and

[16:23] mortar business and it will work. It'll work. Surface of the smile always works. Right? And it's just

[16:29] hard to scale because most people don't care as much as owners do. But if you can create the model

[16:33] that has the incentives and the training in place and the, and the procedures that can consistently

[16:38] create that five out of five experience that allow a second location to have the same amount of

[16:42] success as your first location, then you have something that absolutely can scale and create

[16:46] lots of enterprise value over time. So I would say either scale that or basically dial down your

[16:55] in person to as little as you possibly possible of your time and then go on on the online thing.

[16:59] But trying to do both will be very hard because what will happen is you'll start to do some

[17:04] online stuff, you'll start to see this traction, your gym will start going down, but that's your

[17:07] main source of income. Then you'll hop back to the gym, the online will dip and you'll go back and forth.

[17:12] And so that's why I'm so big on just committing to whatever thing is because any of them would work,

[17:16] but you'd have to be all alone. The one pillar that I guess I failed to mention was the freedom and

[17:20] flexibility. This being a seasonal talent where I'm at, it's like being able to essentially

[17:26] create a life where it allows me to own and be at the brick and mortar for, say, four months out of a

[17:31] year and then from there being able to live elsewhere and then from there because at the end of the

[17:35] day I don't have much responsibility here aside from just the gym. I don't have anything else

[17:40] really that's time me to home, but that's where I guess my, my no-it-star has been for a long period

[17:45] time. Let me just give you step one here. I own a ton of brick and mortar locations as is. Like right now

[17:50] I've got 70 stores that I own between different companies that are brick and mortar locations. I'm not an

[17:55] any of them. And so like the idea that you need to go online in order to not be in person is a fallacy.

[18:01] That's not true. Like you can own your gym because like if you were to open a second location,

[18:05] you would be there either. Right? And so the easiest way to test this one-point-out test is like if you

[18:10] can step out and just not go to the gym for a year then maybe you can do the other thing. And

[18:16] if you haven't gone to the gym for a year then maybe you'll do a second gym. And so I think no matter

[18:20] what path you do this is probably a perfect end for this which is you either are going to

[18:25] do the online thing after you figure out how to outsource the gym or delegate it and hire people who

[18:29] are awesome or you decide you're going to do a second location. Either way you're going to have to

[18:34] start with outsourcing the first gym. Let's say I want to start a business. I can have a very

[18:40] grand vision of the business like Apple or Microsoft there. They had this vision of changing the

[18:48] whole world. How do we keep working on this business for years when we're worried that it might

[18:55] get outdated because of a new AI or technology or in other words what do we do when we think

[19:02] our project might not be useful in the long run. I mean what you're talking about is strategy.

[19:08] Like these are strategic decisions that we have to make like you make a big bet on where you think

[19:11] the market is going to be not where it is today. If you're going to go after something that's that big

[19:16] but do you have investors right now? I'm a one-tripped or not if you say that. If you look at the

[19:22] companies that you just referenced right like you look at basis with Amazon you look at you know Zuckerberg

[19:27] you look at Microsoft. Everyone of those guys started well off and well capitalized. Okay.

[19:34] So basis was an investment banker from Wall Street. Bill Gates parents were really well off

[19:39] and he was well off and what not Zuckerberg went to Harvard same deal. If you want to really go

[19:44] after that you would have to try and recreate the conditions. And I think that right now the

[19:48] likely hit the debt happens given your current situation is low and I'm not saying that to disway

[19:52] you I'm saying because I want to be realistic with you which is that you need to get your own

[19:56] head above water because like right now if you're if you don't have the ability to make money on your own

[20:01] right from a watch burner or perspective like you need to get your head above water because the only

[20:05] way that you can stick with something for the required amount of time in order for it to become

[20:10] world-changing like we're not talking even a decade. I mean those companies there you know 20

[20:15] Facebook's 20 something years old right just like context and so the only way to get there

[20:20] is be able to breathe while you're going and so I think that from a 101 perspective starting

[20:25] starting a simple business that you can generate income on that you know you can you can learn

[20:30] the basics of business before trying to take on the biggest competitors in the most well

[20:35] capitalized arena absolutely on your own. I see not to say that that's impossible it's just

[20:39] incredibly improbable given the circumstances that you just laid out. It would be really romantic for me

[20:45] to be like dude go chase your dreams go do that but like I also would rather have you in a year

[20:50] making money on your own so that you can breathe because you might find out that if you actually

[20:53] start making money on your own you might just like that because right now it's just the idea of the

[20:58] status of the dream of that like it's in a more precise idea but the amount of pain and suffering that

[21:02] you have to be able to put up with and not make money for that whole period of time really tough.

[21:06] Wouldn't that cause another issue where because you decide to choose a problem choose to

[21:12] solve a problem that is small like smaller than the grand vision then you won't be able to scale

[21:19] much. That's not necessarily true and also everyone of this company starts small like Facebook

[21:23] wasn't like we want to be the social media platform for the whole world he wanted to map

[21:27] colleges so they start with the niche and then they expand outwards and so you'd want to much more

[21:31] narrowly define your problem before you go attack it because what you're going to try to build something

[21:35] that's going to be everything for everyone and it's going to be nothing for nobody. Strategy is

[21:38] prioritization it's allocating limited resources against unlimited options and so you have unlimited

[21:44] options but you have very limited resources and so in order to be successful you have to narrow the

[21:49] problem that you're trying to solve so you can allocate the small amount of resources you have

[21:52] to adequately solve that problem completely and then from adequately solving that problem completely

[21:58] like Amazon started with books and Facebook started with colleges right you've solved and then you

[22:03] can go adjacent right so right now it just sounds exciting to say this but like it's not reality

[22:07] you have to pick one problem that you're going to get really good at solving and that's it and then

[22:11] you can have an idea then in the future but real real so many things you're going to change between

[22:15] now and then and there's so much luck that that that has to concur because if you think about

[22:20] the zooming all the way out the biggest companies the world have super well capitalized people

[22:24] who are the best in the world made a good call and had luck because if you're number one you have

[22:29] all the things plus luck like if you're number one it up like in the whole world it's all of it

[22:34] plus luck the market moves in a direction that that you never know right and so I would rather

[22:40] you just stick to a problem that you know you can absolutely solve given the resources you have

[22:44] learn the skills make income and then from there you can go solve an adjacent problem or you might

[22:49] decide you know what I like this and I'm gonna keep going with it. Thank you very much that was really

[22:53] awesome. Yeah you're a good luck man. All right so my question is basically I've been on life

[22:57] finished coach last like years now and like you've forgotten from like the first tanky a month

[23:02] three years ago and like 25 came up a couple months ago. I kind of felt like I got low near the

[23:07] mark successfully got even though I do have I'm pretty big on it's now like maybe you went through

[23:13] some of that something like that or maybe you have it to that sense. I was just wondering like

[23:17] maybe how you got or that self-loving bully because I feel like that's kind of holding you back.

[23:21] I want to make sure that I want to clearly understand your question. So you're saying that

[23:25] being lonely is the thing that is holding you back. I thought about my life so I'll change

[23:29] this all obviously here in a little easier for a moment of waiting. It comes in a few days as long

[23:33] different than that. But especially when going in person and being a full-time in person training

[23:39] and going lying top of that just then a lot more lonely kind of a lot of different aspects of

[23:44] losing that kind of touch. Do you just have to join a community man? Like just straight up like you just

[23:51] need to just need to get around people who are doing the same thing as you. And so that might

[23:54] mean physically moving to a different area because right now I'm assuming online like page your

[23:58] bills correct. Yeah right. So if online page your bills that you can literally be anywhere in the world.

[24:04] And so if you where you live right now I'm going to learn how to apply to move to Keloda. It's

[24:08] more like a business town in Canada. I would do that and I would also join a bunch of online

[24:14] communities of people who are like trying to make money in the fitness space because you'll find

[24:18] a ton of other people who are doing the same thing as you that are on the path that are ahead of

[24:22] you that are the same as you that are behind you and you you can get a little bit of some

[24:26] fulfillment from helping out some of the people behind you but you can also get help from the people ahead of you

[24:31] who are you know because you show that you'll execute and you'll do what they say and you'll grow.

[24:36] But this is the nice news is that this problem is super solve. Like you just got to get around

[24:40] people and you got to be willing to be rejected. I mean it's just like fitness sales. It's just like

[24:44] friend sales. That's the same thing. You just go you go you go and a bunch of dates. They're just

[24:48] friend dates you know you're going to hang out go get a lift in. I mean it's fitness so like just go

[24:52] ask a bunch of people to get a lift in and you'll see who's cool and you'll see who isn't worst case

[24:55] near you. You're going to work. Yeah. Have your experience kind of level up and level up and

[24:59] level up. I'm very sorry. As long as you keep growing this is not going to stop. You're going to find

[25:04] new friends and if you keep growing you'll pass them and then you'll find new friends that are above them

[25:08] and you'll pass them and you'll just keep going. And so it just depends on how like what you see

[25:14] the role of friends as in your life. And so you know for me I just want my requirement for friend

[25:20] isn't necessarily that they make the same or more money than me at all. It's do they make me better.

[25:25] Do they make me better? Do they have my best intentions in art? Just they already two incredibly

[25:30] difficult things to pass. But if someone passes both those things then they are a friend.

[25:35] And so I would just use that as a limit test. Like is this person making me better and do they have

[25:40] my best you know incentive at heart? Yeah and that was making friends I guess now because obviously

[25:45] you're a higher level and things are different with the social status and all that is for any

[25:50] first forced product difference. So do you kind of have the same status now or kind of what is

[25:55] what is the kind of thing? Dude it's harder for me than it is for you.

[26:01] No for real it is. But the thing is is that most of the my closest friends

[26:06] don't live here like don't live in the same physical area that I do. Most of the closest friends that I have

[26:10] live all over. And so I see most of my friends once or twice a year and that's it and I work in

[26:17] the meantime. The thing is is that like the higher up you go here like and I'll just tell you something

[26:20] like from my level whatever you want to call that. All the friends I have, everyone completely like

[26:26] there is zero social obligations or anything. Like none. And if I don't respond to a text for three

[26:32] days there is zero drama and it's not even acknowledged. It's just we know that busy people understand

[26:37] that busy people are doing shit. And so if everyone you have everyone who's in your world understands

[26:44] that you're trying to take this hill then if they're truly your friend then they want you to take

[26:48] the hill more than they want you to respond to their text or come out with them for the weekend.

[26:51] Like I just got invited to a seven day thing that with a couple of friends that Layla and I both

[26:57] really really adore. But we're probably not able to do it because you have so much stuff that we

[27:02] were that we're doing at that same time and I really want to go. But I also really want to do this

[27:07] other stuff and I know that I will feel worse about myself if I don't have this other stuff done.

[27:13] And so we're going to say that I can't go and that's going to be it and they're not going to hold it

[27:18] against me. And so until you find friends who are 100% aligned with you achieving your goals

[27:23] who are making you better and watch you to hit your goals then you just keep looking. But the thing

[27:28] is like everybody goes through the peer that you're at. Like I think I think I made a road of tweet

[27:33] about this but like there is this lonely period that always happens when you start growing because

[27:38] it happens is that you're too big for the old friend group but you're not quite big enough

[27:43] for the group that you want to get into. Right? So you kind of have this path in the middle where

[27:46] you just kind of like keep trudging along. But like every single person who's accomplished anything

[27:51] material has been in your exact same shoes and you just keep going and you keep going you keep

[27:56] not working you enter you go into the communities you see the people who are adding value to

[28:00] those communities and you mess just them you find the givers. Because givers recognize givers almost

[28:05] you can see the people who are always giving more above and beyond and you can understand they

[28:09] get the game. And so like in that first meeting if they're like like let me see if I can do this for you

[28:13] let me like take care of this for you let me help you in this way rather than like hey could you

[28:17] help me with this like wrong person but if you just start by giving to a whole bunch of people who are

[28:23] where you want to be you'll get more back even if nine out of ten don't give you anything back.

[28:28] Provide shit loads of value people will mess it to and then be like hey let's hop on a zoom let's

[28:32] zoom lunch whatever and so like you can have a ton of friend dates or whatever that you meet people and see if they

[28:36] have game and if they have game then you keep in touch because you're making them better too.

[28:40] I appreciate everything you've ever felt a content game. After doing full-time entrepreneur

[28:47] for three years and you know raising the family I got four four small children all under the age of five

[28:56] I found myself in a very hard position where I had to go back to a nine to five. I would say entrepreneur

[29:01] is like like you said it's hard and and I know what hard feels like but after discussing it with my wife

[29:07] like I felt like this was like the right decision after getting myself into business dead and

[29:13] other things like that and I didn't ever have a paycheck to live on you know so how do I know when it's like

[29:22] like how do I get back into entrepreneurship like now I'm just running my stuff on the side so

[29:28] for example right when I was laid off three years ago I was doing taxes and I just doing like

[29:34] bookkeeping then I worked my way up starting to offer accounting services and then I leveled up and I

[29:40] started looking going after higher levels like now I started doing CFO services and I went through

[29:47] that value of despair thing and that's probably why I'm not where I'm at right now you know okay

[29:52] just being completely honest and I appreciate you being candid and upfront about it because otherwise this

[29:58] wouldn't be very valuable because you tell me a bunch of fake information I'll give you a response to

[30:02] fake information it wouldn't matter for either of us so thank you for being honest

[30:06] that being said you're not honestly you're in a pretty good spot and I'll tell you why so you have a

[30:11] valuable skill set that will always be in demand because a lot of people don't want to do money stuff

[30:16] so people don't do budgets people don't bookkeeping people don't do CFO work people want to be

[30:19] financials projections forecast no one wants to do any of that stuff and you do and you're good at it

[30:25] so presumably you're good at because you're doing it right I'll just I'll leave it at that I'm

[30:28] gonna assume that for for the sake of our call right so um one I think it was wise that you got a job

[30:34] because you have a wife you have four kids I think that was a smart and organ move okay now that being said

[30:40] there's going to be a conversation that you probably have to have with your wife about what because

[30:44] your nights and weekends either are going to have to go to family or they're going to have to go to the new thing

[30:50] and so I think that you need to have a candid conversation with her and say listen my

[30:56] I'm just I'm putting words in your mouth here so this is if I were in your shoes I'll say as a man

[31:02] my primary drive is to provide and right now I feel like I'm failing you and I want to

[31:10] lead our children by example so that when they are 20 or 30 and they're thinking about making that jump

[31:17] I can speak to it because I wasn't afraid to take the risk again because in gymnastics as soon

[31:24] as you fall off the palm of horse even if you twist or break your ankle you know what they do

[31:27] they try and get you right back on the horse again and they do that because if you don't and you

[31:31] take enough time off you start developing these fears around getting back on you never get on again

[31:35] and so they want you to get back on the horse right now I think you got bucked by the entrepreneur

[31:39] and that's okay it happens it's part of the game right like it's the it's the the scene in

[31:44] Rocky 17 or whatever fucking rocket is where he's like it's not about how hard you can hit it

[31:49] but it's about hard you can get hit and keep going forward right and so you got hit big you know

[31:54] big what everybody gets hit everyone fucking loses all the time I lost everything twice before this time

[32:00] right and so like you've lost everything once you still you still only one right you tell your wife

[32:06] I said that and so let's get into tactics all right so right now that in my opinion the issue that

[32:12] you miss is you didn't know how to advertise you didn't know how to promote and so you have the

[32:16] service you just got to let people know about it and so you were full time as an entrepreneur but you

[32:21] probably weren't spending four hours a day promoting and so when you are right and so that's that's

[32:26] what you need to do so nights and weekends for you is you log out of work go home kiss the dog

[32:31] high five kids and then you spend four hours promoting and promoting is you make content you reach out to

[32:38] people or you run ads and given your financial situation it's going to be making content and reaching out to people

[32:44] that's it literally if that's what you're you start your timer four hours you make content you reach out to

[32:49] people and you do that for four straight hours every day you do that you're going to more business the next

[32:52] six months and you even know to do that that's it that's all you have to do like you were the

[32:56] thing is that you're in a good spot because you have the skill that there's already demand like

[33:00] I don't have to test your idea you're trying to provide bookkeeping services it's a commoditized

[33:04] service like if you do a good job your on time like your responsive you deliver things on the first of

[33:09] the month people will want to do business with the end of stay with you and so you just got to let

[33:13] people know about it faster because I'm guessing that your rate was based on referrals you had one or two

[33:17] customers maybe three and by the time you get one you were for all of your two or three months one would

[33:21] drop and you stayed there until eventually you couldn't right I'm guessing that was the story right

[33:26] so you just need to increase your sales velocity which means you got to let more people know about it and you

[33:29] got to learn how to sell because it was just you right did you have any employees no I had a virtual

[33:34] assistant during tax season but yeah it was mainly just me yeah then you have the easiest

[33:39] business in the world because a hundred percent of the revenue is profit right just you for now

[33:44] and so you can absolutely get yourself to 10 20 accounting clients and you're going to be working

[33:49] like a dog at this month but you'll be making way more than you are now and then you'll have new

[33:53] problems because then your wife's like I don't see you anymore you're like yeah but now we're

[33:56] making three times as a money and I will find a way to use the money to buy back some time and you

[33:59] can do that but I do it like you're you're like you already have the hardship dot you're like six

[34:04] months away seriously like I don't normally say that like you're six months away you got to you got to

[34:08] reach out to let's call it let's call it 10,000 people you reach out to 10,000 people you'll have

[34:14] that you'll have the you'll have the business you want because I'm telling you right now as a business owner

[34:18] dude the amount of crappy accounts and bookkeepers that are out there outnumbered the good ones

[34:24] 100 to one like no one stoked about their bookkeeper so like like it's not hard and like think about it

[34:30] those guys don't like those guys suffer the same issue that you have as they don't have to promote

[34:33] themselves they're not business people they're being counters and so like you you've been you've been

[34:38] in being counter mode and you got to get in you got to get in promoter mode especially as a as a

[34:42] soul watch burner it's all promotion in the beginning so would you suggest just mainly cold out

[34:47] reach or should I try to do content or just go straight cold out you can do both I mean do one

[34:51] post a day one post a day see who interacts with it so who likes it who comments on it you can

[34:55] message all those people and then you can reach out as well but the thing is is with your profession

[35:00] finding someone who has an adjacent audience so you know if someone who's an HR company or recruiting

[35:07] company right like if you can figure out a way to just work with them they already have a whole

[35:10] engine of people coming in and just see if you can just get off the backside and give them a kick back

[35:15] just for intros like that's a super productive way of of leveraging the amount of reach out so

[35:21] you can just reach out to 10,000 business owners and you'll you'll get your nut but you could

[35:24] probably reach out to a thousand b to b businesses and see if you can structure a partnership with them

[35:29] that they can refer you business and you refer it back to them but yes content and outreach you

[35:33] and real talk the content is probably not in the beginning where you're going to get the majority of

[35:37] business I just want to just prepare you for that but the reason that you're going to be making the

[35:40] content in the beginning is that so when you do reach out people will go to your page and they will

[35:44] consume your content and then they will decide to respond based on the quality so think about

[35:50] that stuff has lead nurture more than lead Jen in the beginning over time you'll get better

[35:55] out and it'll start generating business but it might take you a year or two like it takes time to

[35:58] get good at that you've inspired me and that's the reason why it's at the jump in the beginning so I

[36:02] appreciate you well I appreciate you for taking the jump and I will ask you to trust me one more time

[36:06] which is that four hours a day have the conversation with your wife 10,000 reach out

[36:12] and let me know in six months she's watching so she knows all right let's the last

[36:16] she take is 10,000 reach out that's it like on the other side of 10,000 reach out is you

[36:21] making the money that you want to make and having the skill of promotion and sales that's it

[36:25] I just want you know and I hope that Mosaican exists here for this one reason which is that like you

[36:28] were not alone there are other people going through it and so despite that it may feel lonely you

[36:34] were not alone keep being one of zero

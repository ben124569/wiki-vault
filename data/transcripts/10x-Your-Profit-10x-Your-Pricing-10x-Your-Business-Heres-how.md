[00:00] You can get people to pay you 10 times more than they pay somebody else.

[00:04] You can get customers to convert on ads 10 times higher than they normally do,

[00:09] which means it costs you a tenth to get 10 times more.

[00:12] That's a hundred extra-frential.

[00:14] And that is how massive brands print money over time.

[00:18] And so I want to give you the six steps to building a personal brand or business brand

[00:21] that you can follow.

[00:22] And over the last 40 months I went from zero to eight million subscribers across all channels.

[00:26] We built up portfolio from just starting out to doing over $250 million a year.

[00:29] By understanding this thing that took me way too long.

[00:32] So let's get into it.

[00:33] The first two steps are conceptual.

[00:35] The bottom four steps will be tactical.

[00:36] And the nice thing is that I'll give you a framework and a few stories to kind of like work through

[00:39] a see, remember it.

[00:41] And I think this is going to make a lot of you a lot of money.

[00:44] And we'll finally bring to reality what so many people have struggled to do.

[00:49] It's like I get that Nike is this big brand and if they just put the swoosh on t-shirt

[00:53] they can sell for 20 times more.

[00:54] Wow, that's really valuable.

[00:56] Yeah, but how they do that.

[00:57] How did Apple go from just some, you know, just a mediocre company to becoming the Titan that it is?

[01:04] And so if anything, even the Apple example should give you a little bit of hope that

[01:07] even if you are not premium today or you're just kind of figuring it out today

[01:11] you can absolutely become a juggernaut in whatever industry and okay.

[01:17] So there's six steps we're going to go over and I'm going to walk you through each of them right now.

[01:21] All right.

[01:22] So step number one, step number two, three, four,

[01:27] five and six.

[01:29] All right.

[01:30] So the first one is just what is branding overall?

[01:34] All right.

[01:35] So let's talk about that real quick.

[01:36] So branding is this big fancy word but all it means is the association between two things.

[01:42] All right.

[01:43] All we do is we pair.

[01:44] So pairing is the active verb that you do is an entrepreneur or two build a brand

[01:49] to build an association between two things.

[01:52] Now ideally the thing that we pair are things someone the thing that people don't know about

[01:56] with the thing they do know about is that the thing they do know about is good,

[01:59] right?

[01:59] Something that they like.

[02:01] And so step three will get into it.

[02:03] Which is going to be about talking about the right customer.

[02:05] But for now you have to understand what it is that we're going to be doing to begin with.

[02:08] Which is repairing the thing they don't know, our business and or us, our personal brand.

[02:12] With the thing they do know and like, which is the good thing.

[02:15] Now if we do this over and over and over again,

[02:18] eventually you can remove the other thing and the association,

[02:21] the likingness kind of rubs off on you.

[02:23] All right.

[02:24] Now let me show you how powerful this is.

[02:26] If I got up on stage, right, and next to me is all the Republican candidates,

[02:31] that would make that would shift your perspective of me a lot because there'd be a lot of

[02:37] associations strongly held associations either positive or negative with that group of guys or

[02:42] gals.

[02:43] Now on the other hand if I stood at the same guy stood up on stage,

[02:46] same me, same message with all of the Democratic Party, it would give a very different

[02:52] perspective on who I am.

[02:54] Now let's do door number three, I stand up on stage with all porn stars.

[02:59] Very different association.

[03:01] And so the idea is a lot and the thing is is that this association, these parings,

[03:05] are happening every day all the time in your business, but most of the time they're being done

[03:10] haphazardly.

[03:11] And so building a brand is a lot like making a garden inside the in the front of your house.

[03:17] Right.

[03:17] There's a lot of weeds that want to grow there.

[03:19] It's natural for there to be disorder for there to be chaos.

[03:23] And so a chaotic brand is basically a meaningless brand because there's so many things that are

[03:28] not associated that makes sense that it means nothing to nobody.

[03:33] Right.

[03:33] And so what you have to do is you have to prune the tree.

[03:36] You have to pull the weeds from the garden.

[03:37] You have to control what associations, what flowers you want to be, their antiprolyphory.

[03:43] Because imagine a garden of flowers where it's all roses, all red roses.

[03:48] It'd be a very strong association with that one type of flower.

[03:52] And they versus somebody else's.

[03:54] We're like if there's one or two roses, but then there's also some yellow flowers,

[03:57] some daffodils, and some sunflower's.

[03:59] It's really tough to say, well, what's that garden about?

[04:02] I don't know.

[04:03] And so that's what most people's branding looks like.

[04:06] And so number one is understanding what is branding and building a brand of raw.

[04:11] It's just an association that we build that over time once it's strong enough.

[04:15] If I appeared 100 times in a row with porn stars,

[04:18] eventually you would just assume I'm in the porn industry.

[04:21] And I could remove the porn stars and I would still remain.

[04:24] And people would make that association.

[04:26] That would be part of my brand.

[04:27] All right.

[04:28] So that's number one is what is brand.

[04:30] If we're going to build it, we got to know what it is.

[04:32] The second is why should you bother?

[04:34] All right.

[04:35] And this is important.

[04:36] So fundamentally, if we think about what makes money in a business,

[04:40] you've got the fundamental arbitrage businesses,

[04:43] how much it costs you to make money.

[04:45] All right.

[04:46] So what that means is, cack the cost you're a car customer against LTV,

[04:50] lifetime value, which is how much you make over the lifetime of that customer,

[04:54] in terms of gross profit from each customer.

[04:56] All right.

[04:56] And so let's say if I spend a dollar to get a customer,

[04:59] and that customer is going to make me $10 of gross profit,

[05:02] then I have a 10 to 1 LTV to cack ratio.

[05:05] And this is the fundamental economic unit that exists in every single business.

[05:08] Like if you boil every business down to this one fundamental thing,

[05:12] how much does it cost you to make more money?

[05:14] That's fundamentally even what investing in big businesses drives

[05:18] down to the fundamental economic exchange that occurs within the business.

[05:22] How much does it cost you to make money?

[05:23] Now, the reason branding is so important,

[05:26] and while you look at the most valuable companies in the world,

[05:28] or say definitely the most valuable brands in the world,

[05:32] what do they have?

[05:33] They have customers who accost them less to get them.

[05:38] Number one, people are willing to pay more

[05:41] higher lifetime value, and they don't buy from anyone else,

[05:45] which means they buy over and over and over again.

[05:47] And so if brand can allow you to convert a higher percentage of your audience,

[05:52] get those people to buy more times from you,

[05:55] get them to not buy from anyone else,

[05:57] and get them to do that at a higher price than the commoditized price of the marketplace,

[06:02] those are some very powerful things for a business,

[06:06] arguably the most important things that can't happen in business,

[06:09] and having a brand or a strong brand,

[06:12] strong positive associations with their ideal audience,

[06:15] is one of the fastest and most powerful, not fastest,

[06:17] excuse me, the most powerful ways to accomplish that.

[06:20] And so if I told you, you could do that,

[06:22] well, why would you not?

[06:23] If it's the most valuable thing you can do in a business

[06:25] from a dollars-and-sense perspective.

[06:27] Now, the thing is, is that building associations,

[06:30] teaching people what you are and what you're not takes time.

[06:35] But once you do accomplish that teaching,

[06:37] which is fundamentally what branding is,

[06:39] you're teaching someone a pairing,

[06:40] same thing like you teach a kid that don't touch the stove,

[06:43] it's hot.

[06:44] You're trying to associate the thing you don't want them to do

[06:46] with something that they don't want to have happen.

[06:48] Works the same way, we're just doing in reverse, okay?

[06:50] So number one, what is brand?

[06:52] It's the association between two things.

[06:54] We do it over and over again to make sure that it's only

[06:56] that stuff that we want, and then people say,

[06:58] oh, this guy is the business guy, which is for me.

[07:00] Now, why does it matter?

[07:02] We get more customers, they buy more times,

[07:04] higher conversion percentage, lower-capped,

[07:06] at higher prices, and they buy again and again and again.

[07:09] Great, so I understand why I want to do this.

[07:12] Now, let's actually start branding.

[07:14] So this is it to come down to who, okay?

[07:17] So whenever I have this conversation with a business owner,

[07:20] or somebody's a personal brand, and to be clear here,

[07:22] I could say, hey, six steps to build a personal brand.

[07:25] I could also say six steps to build a business brand.

[07:28] Believe it or not, it's the same six steps.

[07:30] It all depends on who you're trying to sell.

[07:33] And so if you're building your own brand,

[07:36] if you're trying to sell a certain avatar,

[07:38] then it's going to depend on that.

[07:39] So I'm going to use a very boring business.

[07:41] So let's say I'm an accountant, okay?

[07:43] I'm a CPA, and I have an accounting firm.

[07:45] All right, now, if I want to brand my accounting firm,

[07:48] I'm going to start with who do I want to attract?

[07:51] Right?

[07:52] Who do I want to attract?

[07:53] And so these are the qualifications that I think through

[07:56] when I'm thinking about my who.

[08:00] Now, I have a whole chapter in this book

[08:02] 100-mineral hour offers that talks about this,

[08:04] but I'm going to give you the crash course.

[08:06] So number one is I want the audience to be growing.

[08:09] Right? Because if I have to pick between an audience

[08:12] that's shrinking and getting smaller,

[08:13] one that's maintaining when that's growing,

[08:15] well, shoot, I'd rather grow after one that's bigger,

[08:17] because even if I stay the same size,

[08:18] I'm still going to grow because the market's growing.

[08:20] Right? So number one, I'd want them to be growing.

[08:23] Number two, this you stand out of you.

[08:25] Again, is I want to make sure they can afford my stuff.

[08:28] Right? I want people who are making money,

[08:30] because if I want to charge a lot of money,

[08:31] they got to have the money so I can charge it.

[08:33] Right? Again, if I could go after poor people,

[08:35] medium people or rich people,

[08:36] well, I'd rather grow after people who are rich and can afford it.

[08:39] So that's the second qualification that I have

[08:41] that I look for from my home.

[08:42] Remember, I'm an accounting firm.

[08:43] I've got this skill set, but I need a zero and a little bit.

[08:46] I don't want to be a generalist.

[08:47] I want to serve a specific marketplace so I can charge a premium.

[08:50] And it makes it more operationally sound for me,

[08:52] because I have to do the same thing over and over again,

[08:53] rather than come up with custom solutions

[08:55] over for every different customer who walks in the door.

[08:57] All right. The third thing that I want is hey,

[09:00] I want people who are very easy to target,

[09:02] because if I can't find my customers,

[09:05] like I've got people who are really easy to find and really hard to find,

[09:08] well, hell, I'd rather have the one that's really easy to find.

[09:11] And so we're thinking about this in terms of basics,

[09:13] but this is real stuff.

[09:15] It's like I want them to be growing, duh.

[09:17] I want them to have the money, duh.

[09:19] I want them to be easy to find.

[09:21] And finally, I want people who are in pain.

[09:26] I want people who actually want what I have to sell.

[09:28] If they are, let's say I'm going after a marketplace

[09:31] and everyone's all wiped up, right?

[09:34] Not necessarily a bad thing,

[09:35] because it means that there is demand there as a side note.

[09:37] But if no one wants the service you have,

[09:42] tough to sell. And so these are the four basic things.

[09:44] Growing, they can afford it. I'm easy to find and they're in pain.

[09:48] Okay, fantastic.

[09:49] So let's walk through this if I'm in a counting firm.

[09:52] So if I'm in a counting firm, I want some of them to be growing.

[09:55] So I think health trends, let's do this together live.

[09:58] I think health trends anti-aging boomers.

[10:01] Like this is a big, a big market.

[10:03] They have a lot of money in terms of easy to find.

[10:08] Okay, so what's a business that's hopping on this trend?

[10:10] So that would be like Medspas, Symmoglu-Tide clinics.

[10:15] Cool. So let's start with that.

[10:16] Let's just say like Medspas and clinics that are dealing with anti-aging for boomers.

[10:20] And obviously they're in pain from getting old,

[10:22] because who isn't in pain from being old and doesn't want to be old.

[10:25] So great. So this checks all the boxes.

[10:27] All right, so we found our who.

[10:28] So that is step number three.

[10:30] That meets all four of our qualifications.

[10:34] Great. So now let's talk about step number four,

[10:36] which is now we have to figure out what they like.

[10:42] Now remember, we're in a counting firm and we're trying to find

[10:45] Medspas and anti-aging clinics to do their accounting for them.

[10:49] Okay, so what you medspas, so we're going to say medspas here,

[10:53] med people, right?

[10:55] What do they like? What do those business owners like?

[10:57] Well, they probably like making more money.

[11:00] Number one, they probably want to get more customers.

[11:02] Number two, they probably want to make more profits.

[11:06] They probably want to build a sellable business.

[11:08] Those are all things that they find.

[11:09] They probably want to have some help recruiting talent

[11:12] so that they don't have to work as much inside the business.

[11:15] They probably have some issue retaining talent because finding high quality

[11:20] like nurses and nurse practitioners ain't cheap and there's a lot of demand for them.

[11:24] Right now, especially in the private market.

[11:25] And so it's like, okay, so these are some of the things that they like

[11:28] and these are some of the problems they're struggling with.

[11:31] And so if I want to build a positive brand with these people,

[11:36] I have to find the things they like and the things they're struggling with.

[11:38] So we just listed that out.

[11:40] Okay, so now what we need to do is instead of five,

[11:43] we associate which you can say code for advertised,

[11:49] advertised, oops, there you go.

[11:51] Advertise ourselves with the solution.

[11:55] We want to pair ourselves with the things that they like.

[11:58] They like solutions to their problems.

[12:00] Everybody wants to be in less pain.

[12:01] And so that means that I'm going to probably start making content

[12:04] and picking off piece by piece here.

[12:06] I'm going to say, hey, here are some things that we see

[12:09] across our firm for the medspares and anti-aging clinics

[12:13] that have helped drive profits.

[12:15] They actually can combine this stuff in their refrigerator

[12:18] and they pack it this way so they can actually fit more in

[12:21] and have more stuff more room for services.

[12:23] Great. Here's the second thing is how people set up their lobbies.

[12:26] This actually makes it more efficient so they can see more patients in less time.

[12:30] So I'm going to start making content in terms of videos,

[12:32] in terms of blogs, in terms of written format, cheat sheets and PDFs.

[12:36] I'm going to start giving this stuff away.

[12:37] I'm going to start associating myself with the things they want

[12:40] and the things they need.

[12:42] So I start doing this if we were like, wow, I start to like this guy

[12:46] because he's making my life better.

[12:47] Now, I keep making these associations.

[12:49] Me, they don't know with things they do know

[12:51] and the problems they are suffering from that they like.

[12:53] I keep making this association over and over and over again.

[12:57] Right?

[12:57] Now, what happens is, is that we have,

[13:03] as we build this brand, we have to think about it from the perspective

[13:07] of the medspares owner.

[13:08] Okay? Now, this is a simplified version of what I talk about in the

[13:13] leads book in the core four in terms of advertising.

[13:15] But I like this as a even easier way to think about it.

[13:19] Is that at the top level, you've got you tell people.

[13:24] And so me, right now, this is me telling you,

[13:26] this is me advertising myself, this is me making my stuff known.

[13:29] That's what we mean.

[13:30] You tell them, that's the first level, it's also the least influential.

[13:34] Right? Like if you don't know who I am, then you're,

[13:37] you might believe me to some degree,

[13:38] maybe the content that I have will speak more to you than who I am.

[13:43] And that's why the quality of your stuff matters so much

[13:45] because every single time there's somebody who's brand new

[13:48] who doesn't know you, they're going to make what 100% of their judgment

[13:51] off of this first exchange.

[13:52] And I always try and keep them on the top my mind that some of you guys

[13:54] here who are new have never heard my stuff before.

[13:56] And it's like, I got to be good, right? I got some good stuff.

[13:59] And if you're struggling to figure out who you want to sell to,

[14:01] I wrote a book, 100 billion dollar offer,

[14:03] that has several chapters dedicated to just helping you solve that problem.

[14:06] And if you're struggling with the association step,

[14:09] which is figuring out how actually advertisers say,

[14:11] how do I let people know about it?

[14:12] That's what my second book, 100 billion dollar leads,

[14:14] helps solve. And if you're absolutely broke,

[14:17] then you can go to my podcast, they're free.

[14:19] Episode 579 is where they start.

[14:21] You can check them out there. If you like watching instead,

[14:23] you can go to my site,accuson.com.

[14:25] And I have video courses on this, they're free.

[14:27] You don't even have to opt in for them.

[14:28] And if you like the physical copy, you can go check them out on Amazon.

[14:31] We've sold over a million copies of these books.

[14:33] They've over 25,000, five stars.

[14:36] So give them a gander. You probably won't be disappointed.

[14:39] Let's get back to it.

[14:40] So think about it like a movie, just to give a simple example.

[14:43] The movie company tells you that they're movies great.

[14:46] So they make a movie trailer.

[14:47] All right, so you watch the movie trailer.

[14:48] Do you immediately go see a movie when you see a great movie trailer?

[14:52] Probably not. Sometimes you're like, well, that looked interesting.

[14:55] That looked good. So what do you do next?

[14:58] Number two is you, your friends.

[15:01] Tell you. You say, hey, that new godzilla trailer.

[15:04] You see that looks pretty cool.

[15:06] And your friends say, dude, I went to go see it.

[15:08] It sucked. And you're like, oh, you see, just like that.

[15:12] That movie doesn't get my business. Right?

[15:15] Now, the last time I saw a movie that really took over

[15:18] from word of mouth was Maverick, which is the top gun movie.

[15:21] I don't know if you guys saw that when it came out.

[15:22] I feel like I got 10 different people who were like, dude,

[15:25] the best movie I've seen in two years.

[15:27] Right? And I was like, wow,

[15:28] it's strong. Now, I saw the trailer.

[15:31] And I was like, this looks cool.

[15:32] But when 10 people told me to go see it, I was like,

[15:34] all right, I'm going to go see it.

[15:35] Right? And so this one far more powerful.

[15:39] What people say, what others say,

[15:41] I should say others. Sorry.

[15:43] Make this easier for it.

[15:44] What other people say?

[15:46] What other people say to them?

[15:47] Matters, way more than what you tell them.

[15:50] Now, the third level here is what they experience themselves.

[15:57] Right? So you make your promises with they experience themselves.

[16:02] So at the top level, you've got a movie trailer.

[16:04] The level underneath of that, the people are like, hey, this is good.

[16:07] This is bad. This is mediocre.

[16:08] The level underneath of that is that I go see the movie.

[16:10] And I make my own decision for myself.

[16:13] Now, the movie is a great microcosm example of what a brand is.

[16:19] In a very short thing. It's only one product, the movie.

[16:21] You go see it, or you don't. And they generate cash.

[16:24] It's actually not really a business.

[16:25] It's fundamentally one chunk of media that has a ton of marketing behind it.

[16:29] And then that's it. And then they try and make another movie.

[16:31] Right? Now, for us as business owners,

[16:35] we're not in the movie business.

[16:37] We're in the, we want them to buy again and again and again business.

[16:40] So what we do is that when we make our promises, what we tell them,

[16:46] we have to deliver on the promise to that when they see our movie,

[16:48] they go to our restaurant, they use my accounting services.

[16:52] People are like, wow, this guy really is good.

[16:54] Right? And so when that occurs, this completes the loop.

[16:59] Because they get this amazing experience.

[17:01] They believe me the next time I make a claim.

[17:03] And they become the people who tell other people,

[17:06] hey, these guys really are good.

[17:08] And this creates what I call the virtuous cycle of branding,

[17:12] is that you make a promise, you keep that promise,

[17:15] and then people tell other people that you kept that promise.

[17:18] And then other people try your thing.

[17:20] And then you keep your promise to them and then around and around it goes.

[17:24] And it just takes time to get this second level where other people talk on your

[17:28] behalf, which matters far more than what you say.

[17:31] Because anybody can get somebody to buy one thing, one time.

[17:35] But it takes a business who can keep their promises as exceptional,

[17:39] who can get them to buy again and again.

[17:41] And again. So, if we're going through the steps in branding,

[17:44] first off, you understand branding is making associations between things they don't know,

[17:48] and things they do know, which is hopefully something they like.

[17:52] So they make that rubbing, that liking this rub is off on you.

[17:55] You do it because it helps you get more customers for less,

[17:57] convert a higher percentage, add higher prices and get them to buy again,

[18:00] and start about your competition.

[18:02] The who is when you start this process, you think,

[18:04] who am I trying to be the ideal, who am I trying to provide liking this to?

[18:10] And so, if I were trying to go to Medspioneers,

[18:12] it might be very different in terms of the type of content that I'd be making,

[18:15] if I'm an accounting firm, then if I was going to homeowners.

[18:18] Right? If I want residential homeowners to be my target market,

[18:22] or just normal W2 employees, I'd be making entirely different content,

[18:27] and are so sing with very different things for that audience.

[18:30] Right now, I'm still in accounting, accounting as a business,

[18:33] but who I'm trying to make the positive association with

[18:36] has a very different feel to it.

[18:38] Right? I could even decide I only want Republicans.

[18:41] It's not a protected class, by the way.

[18:43] You can say you only want Democrats, you only want Republicans,

[18:45] not protected at either side. Political parties is not a protected class.

[18:48] And so, I could say I'm only going to make content that appeals to this demographic,

[18:53] and I know that I'm going to ward off all the people on the other side of the aisle,

[18:56] figuratively.

[18:57] Now, you might also ward off anybody who doesn't want political stuff in their accounting,

[19:00] right? Which is at third bucket.

[19:02] The point is is that you get the who, which in our example, was Med Spas,

[19:05] because it satisfied the four things. They're growing.

[19:07] They're in pain. They have the money to spend, and they're easy to find.

[19:11] Cool. So we have the Med Spas. Now, what do they like?

[19:14] They like getting more customers. They like making more profit.

[19:16] They like making their lives easier. They like saving money.

[19:18] They like making their company sellable. Okay.

[19:20] So I'm going to start making content around all of those topics,

[19:23] and if I succeed at teaching that stuff,

[19:25] then they're going to make that positive association with me, and they're going to like me.

[19:28] I'm keeping a micro promise with my content,

[19:30] which increased the likelihood that they think that I'll keep my macro promise,

[19:34] that I can help them as an accounting firm, drive more profits,

[19:36] make better decisions for the business, and then ultimately when they want to come to

[19:39] transition or sell the business, I might be the one who can, my financials will help them

[19:44] make that transaction and and steward it over to a new owner. Now,

[19:49] the fifth step was a sociator advertised. Now, I just talked about there's three levels there.

[19:53] What you do, which is the core force, so you either make content,

[19:56] you reach out to people, you don't know, reach out to people, you do know,

[19:58] or you run ads, there's the four ways that you can do it, right?

[20:01] So you make the associations through the advertising. So I want to be clear here.

[20:06] Advertising is letting people know. The branding is what you let them know.

[20:10] So people get this big, this whole thing mixed up. They're like advertising,

[20:13] branding what's the difference. Advertising is the process of making known.

[20:17] Branding is what you make known. It's the content of the advertising.

[20:21] It's what associations occur while you are making things known, right? And so you can have

[20:26] exceptional advertising and terrible branding happen at the same time. The Budweiser campaign was

[20:31] exceptional advertising. They let the whole world know they were making association with Del

[20:35] Mulvaney, the the trans person. Now, for their audience, for their who, that was a bad association.

[20:43] And so it was bad branding, but it was good advertising. And we have to make sure that we can

[20:47] break those things apart. And to be clear, for a different who, that pairing with Del Mulvaney

[20:53] might have been really good for a different company that had a different who. And so if you had a

[20:59] business that surf people who were super, super left and very progressive in terms of all that stuff,

[21:05] then that would be a pairing that might drive sales. And it'd be both good advertising and good

[21:10] branding in that subset of audience. But for Budweights or Budweiser's core audience, that was an

[21:17] association they did not like and did not want. And so it drove down sales. It was bad. It was a

[21:22] bad thing. That's what we have to know. What do they like so that we can pair with that as hard as we can.

[21:27] And we advertise the hell out of it. So as many people as you can possibly possible can find out

[21:32] about that pairing. And then finally, this is the last step of branding, which is the most important

[21:38] step. The most important step is keeping your promises. Okay, which it comes down,

[21:45] comes down to product, meaning that the thing that you said, what you said it would do,

[21:50] does it the way you said it would do it by the time you said it would get done.

[21:55] Which very easy to say, very hard to do. But fundamentally, the biggest businesses in the world,

[22:01] like the reason Apple is Apple is because the products are exceptional. Now, they've had,

[22:06] now I'm going to talk about the last 20 years. But no, obviously different times. And they're

[22:11] trying to figure out what their next big Jesus product is going to be now. But fundamentally,

[22:15] they have the brand they have because they have made the association with elegant,

[22:20] simple, easy to use design that makes technology accessible for everyone. That's fundamentally what

[22:27] they've done. Right? That is what they stand for. And in the beginning, it was being not a suit.

[22:32] But the thing is at this point, the vast majority of people associate with not that. And so they

[22:36] actually bet on what would eventually become the majority of people. And so they fulfilled their promise

[22:42] because their products are elegant. They are easy to use. They are sleek. Right? They have all of

[22:47] those elements. And once people do buy from them, what happens? And I'll tell you the story,

[22:52] what it feels like. So the first time I ever had the experience of good brand, good reputation,

[22:57] I had positive associations with an audience. I launched something called LNS, which became like the

[23:03] first beta version of what would become Allen, my software company. So I did this webinar to just my

[23:08] existing audience. And a bunch of people weren't able to make it on because they're Jim owners and

[23:12] they're business owners, they're busy. And but they knew that we were going to be doing the

[23:17] buildouts for automated lead nurture for their gyms in order of the order getting received. And so

[23:25] we had people calling in and saying, hey, I missed the webinar. I have no idea what Alex is selling.

[23:30] But here's my credit card, just bill me. I'm in for whatever it is. And so I think about the

[23:35] power of that is that the only reason someone would behave that way is because they have a strong

[23:40] history of positive reinforcement with the brand is that every other promise that I had made up to

[23:45] this point for those people, I had delivered on more than they had paid. And so if someone just says,

[23:51] listen, I just, here's the card, I know I'm going to get my money's worth just charge me so I can get

[23:55] in line sooner. That's where you would be. And that's where all of these other kind of like you

[24:01] hear these like direct response marketing hacks and tricks and whatever is they become irrelevant

[24:06] because you have the thing that matters most which is a strong positive association that

[24:12] orient someone's behavior towards you with a higher likely to purge a say more frequently exclusive

[24:17] of you at higher prices. And this is why it's so important. The problem is that it's hard because

[24:23] it takes time and you have to be deliberate with it. There's a reason that I haven't taken a

[24:28] black pill or red pill podcast. There's a reason I haven't done that. Believe me, I get fucking asked.

[24:34] Right? I don't want the association. There's tons of people in the porn world that reach out and

[24:39] say, hey, hop on our podcast, we get so many views, we get all this stuff. Sure. And the thing is

[24:44] is that I personally, you guys know my views, I'm nihilistic in general. I don't think anything

[24:48] is inherent meaning. So I don't care what anyone does in terms of how they choose to make

[24:51] their money or how they choose to make their income provided is legal. Right? Now, and it is legal.

[24:56] But I also know that there's a big segment of my audience that does care. And so I don't want

[25:01] to disenfranchise those people. That trade isn't worth it for me. And so I don't want to make

[25:07] that association. Not that I have any issue with it. It's just not a trade I'm willing to make.

[25:12] And so whenever you make, whenever you make an association, you trade a certain percentage of your

[25:19] audience for ideally a greater percentage of the type of people you want. Right? And so the

[25:25] Dylan Mulvaney move to go back to that did strengthen Bud Light for a sub-segment of the audience.

[25:32] They had some people that might have actually started drinking Bud Light because they did that.

[25:36] Now, they might have lost those people because they basically backed off on the position very quickly.

[25:41] But for a moment, they made a bet with the move and they got some segment to like them.

[25:47] There was just more of them that hated it. And so they lost it overall. And so you're going,

[25:51] whenever you make any change, when you make any new association that's different,

[25:55] then what you have done in the past, you are going to lose some people and gain others.

[26:01] The point of good branding is that the ones you gain are more of the who you want and the ones you

[26:06] lose are the people you don't want. And so every day you're basically pruning this tree,

[26:11] you're reading the garden, you're planning the right flowers and taking out the wrong ones.

[26:16] And here's an interesting point. Let's say we have this thing of roses and this is something

[26:22] I think that really drive home for a lot of you. If you've got this row of flowers and that's

[26:27] your whole garden, it's just all red roses, right? And then a white rose pops up in the middle of the

[26:32] red roses. There's nothing inherently wrong with a right rose. There's nothing inherently wrong

[26:40] about me talking about my relationship with Leyla, right? But for my audience, for my who,

[26:46] it's business first. And so like I made this tiny mistake within our, you know, our own business

[26:52] or learning whatever you want to call it. We said there was a period of three, six months where I

[26:55] started experimenting with some wider topics. The thing is is that I lose some audience who isn't

[27:01] married, who are business owners. But why would I not want to appeal to them? I'm business first.

[27:07] And so I got this question and I want to hit on it because I think it's really good.

[27:10] Is that I have said before that you are the niche, right? All the unique things about you

[27:15] create the thumbprint of your personal brand. So how do you contrast that with saying, hey, you want

[27:21] to just do this stuff that you're who or your audience likes? So this is how I explain it.

[27:27] Is that let's think about this as a central pillar. See this marker. This is a central pillar of my

[27:31] brand, which is business. That is the central pillar of what I have. Now, some people are going to

[27:36] business in married. Some people are going to be business in fitness. Some people are going to be

[27:40] business in philosophy. Some people are going to be business and marriage or whatever, whatever other

[27:45] ones I have. You know, dessert. Okay. Fine. The thing is is that business always has to be first because

[27:51] that's the common thread of the whole community. If I make marriage first, then I will lose everyone

[27:57] that's that's not marriage first. And so you can sprinkle in your uniqueness of identity,

[28:06] but around the core value proposition that you have for your who. Mind you, this is if you have the

[28:13] desire to monetize a brand and do it for a specific avatar. And so if you have the accounting firm

[28:21] and you're making content about how to do your books and how to be more profitable and how to set

[28:24] up your lobby and how to generate customers. All that stuff that you might do to help

[28:27] attract more medspot owners to you, you might as a business owner of the accounting firm be married.

[28:33] And that's fine. But you're still going to make the accounting practice and helping medspot owners

[28:39] be the core because every one of them when we talk about what do they like? All of them like that.

[28:45] All of my audience likes business. And so you keep the one thing that you know they all like that.

[28:51] You have the strongest positive affinity with with the most percentage of your audience,

[28:56] the key core thing. And so if you're going to go through this and you want to build your brand,

[29:02] you know what it is, you know why it's important, you figure out who you're going to go after,

[29:06] you're going to make sure it's growing, easy to target, they got the money to spend and they got

[29:09] the problem to solve. You figure out the things they like, you associate yourself with those things

[29:15] through advertising so that's making content, reaching out to people and running ads and appearing

[29:22] next to people and with things that they find positive in general for that audience,

[29:27] you do that as much as you possibly can and that will allow you to get the purchase. Now, once

[29:32] you have the purchase, you either break the cycle of branding or you create a virtuous cycle of branding,

[29:38] which means the branding reinforces itself. And you do that by keeping your promise with the product,

[29:44] not over promising, under promising, over delivering and doing exactly what you said you're

[29:49] the way you said you're going to do it by the time you said you'd get it done. If you do this,

[29:54] over time, a larger and larger audience will be customers of yours and tell other people

[30:00] to become customers of yours. You will be the Godzilla movie, you will be the Maverick movie,

[30:06] where you say you're great, but then tend other people tell people that you're great and then

[30:10] everyone wants to buy and then they do see the movie, they do go to your restaurant, they do use your

[30:14] dry cleaning, they do go to your gym, they do try your agency services, they do sell a house with you,

[30:19] they do work with you and then they become of a larger part of that pool that compounds and says,

[30:25] they are who they say they are.

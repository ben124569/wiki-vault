[00:00] My audience asked me questions for 10 hours and here are the best moments.

[00:04] Let's say my only goal was just to get rich AF.

[00:08] What is rich AF just so we define it?

[00:10] 100 million. Why not?

[00:11] Okay, good number. Cool.

[00:12] You willing to work hard, but you have limited skills and experience.

[00:15] What business would you start?

[00:17] Like right now, 2023.

[00:19] And I have no money, right?

[00:20] I would probably build a boring business in services.

[00:23] And I would probably pick something around the body.

[00:26] You know, I wouldn't just start a design firm,

[00:27] because I think that has a high likelihood of getting disrupted or, you know,

[00:30] in some way by AI.

[00:32] If I were, you know, it's as silly as a sounds like a nail salon or a lawn care service.

[00:37] Things that, I mean, especially body ones,

[00:41] dentists stuff.

[00:42] Like you still have to go in and get your teeth taken care of.

[00:45] And many times people value the human exchange more than something robotics.

[00:52] So for example, in the fitness world, like this is my, like my data point around this,

[00:56] there was a brand called CocoFit.

[00:58] And they struggled a time and then eventually went out of business,

[01:01] because they tried to automate personal training.

[01:03] So they created these all-in-one machines that would, you have a key fob and it would count your reps.

[01:07] And every time you went to the machine, you would say, how to do more and what you did last time.

[01:10] It's really cool concept.

[01:12] The problem was their theory was that the reason that people were getting results is that they didn't

[01:15] know what to do when the realities that they were going to be showing for the gym.

[01:18] People hire personal trainers because they want another human to talk to and to hold the

[01:23] accountable showing up.

[01:24] Same reason, like if you had a robot cutting hair, there might be a percentage of the

[01:27] population that do it, but a lot of women like the going to the harrelon and having that exchange.

[01:31] And so I would probably build a business around services in general,

[01:36] would be my way and then I would continue to scale that.

[01:38] And you could do that at a local chain level and you could make a lot of money do that.

[01:41] Or you could do it at a national level, which would be like professional services.

[01:44] I love the idea behind the cost of that's going to be here forever.

[01:47] You know, let's say I could, theoretically, the great fires of Las Vegas burn everything to the ground.

[01:52] Okay, you lost everything.

[01:53] You had to start again.

[01:55] What would you say is the number one thing that you would have done differently

[01:59] to get to where you are now?

[02:00] And I have no reputation, right?

[02:01] No reputation.

[02:02] Yeah, it burns my reputation on the ground with it.

[02:04] So I actually have lost everything before.

[02:06] And so I know what I did and I probably would have done the same thing.

[02:10] So the the easiest way that I did to like go make a hundred grand in a month when I had nothing

[02:17] was that I would go find a business that was local that I understood and that I could

[02:21] sell something expensive for.

[02:23] I would front the capital to market.

[02:25] I would work the leads and I would sit at the front desk and sell and I would negotiate what they would be

[02:30] willing to do a big bulk of services at scale four.

[02:34] So for example, if I wanted to find a car factor and I'd say, hey, if I sent you a hundred customers

[02:39] this month, what's the lowest rate you would do all hundred customers for this level of service?

[02:45] And then I would just negotiate that down and then I would spend as much as I could and sell it

[02:50] for as much as I can so I could make the spread and then they would service the customers and for them

[02:54] it's a zero risk offer because they don't have to do anything.

[02:56] I front everything else and then for me I don't have to do anything but market and sell and I

[03:00] can take all of that. And so like when I lost everything I immediately was able to make a hundred

[03:04] grand the next month by doing that playbook.

[03:06] In your opinion, what are the three most powerful skills that someone should develop if they want

[03:12] to make a lot of money?

[03:13] I mean the three core skills are you going to learn how to build, you're going to learn how to sell,

[03:16] you got to learn how to lead, just like that. There we go. Like in terms of maybe like hard skills

[03:20] that someone should really focus on learning to develop that like sales, copywriting, leadership,

[03:26] what would you say the most important? Well those are the three big buckets.

[03:30] Right? So it's like one is that like leadership is just the internal bucket of getting people to do

[03:33] which want them to do at scale. Right? And then from a selling perspective I include that in all

[03:38] things that are marketing, letting people know about your stuff, promotion and actually converting

[03:43] people into customers. And then the third piece of building product and services is so that at scale,

[03:49] if the product is good enough then you won't lose customers and if it's exceptional the product

[03:54] itself will get you more customers. And so most businesses take into their natural extreme on a

[03:59] promotional level typically are leaky buckets because the product actually sucks and most businesses

[04:04] suck in general because most products aren't good and most people want to cancel very quickly

[04:08] and don't want to continue to use them which is why very very good companies are very rare.

[04:13] Most of them generally are mediocre or not good. And so I prefer to solve a business from

[04:19] back to front which is like can we find something that people actually like and want to continue to

[04:23] use and continue to pay for? And then the marketing is almost a commoditized skill. Like it's very

[04:29] easy to let other people know about your stuff and do so louder and louder and louder,

[04:33] provided the product is good. And then the internal has to get run with a leader that can attract

[04:38] the talent to continue to do this because quickly the the business will bottleneck based on the

[04:42] founder and their expertise or usually they have a niche that might be product people, they might be

[04:47] tech people, they might be finance people, they might be whatever and then they have to be

[04:52] of the character to attract the talent that will allow them to get to nine figures or whatever

[04:58] it is that they're at the goal is. You mentioned on a recent podcast with Tom Billy that you

[05:03] don't have rules. So I for example you know I quite often end up working up until midnight to

[05:09] am 3m and basically fucking out my sleep schedule because I have too much freedom because I'm

[05:14] self employed. So how do you kind of strike that balance between freedom and discipline,

[05:19] you know if you're driven and you want to accomplish big things? It's it's kind of you do 20.

[05:23] Like if you know that when you stay up late like there are times when I will gas it and go

[05:28] past my red line in terms of work and I know that I'm eating into tomorrow. But if I'm like

[05:33] in a flow and I'm crushing it and the muse shows up and the muse wants to work then I work

[05:38] you don't even mean but if there's some days on the flip side where I wake up and I just feel

[05:41] foggy as shit and I just like for whatever reason I too much maxking last night and you know

[05:46] I just I don't have it that day then I might call it earlier like the idea of me pushing through

[05:52] and punishing when it comes to the type of work I do. If I were doing a more brute force work then

[05:58] I would care less. You didn't mean if it was just like if I was just doing reach outs,

[06:01] I was doing coal calls, I was training personal training sessions, I was cutting hair. I'm just

[06:05] getting I'm just going to brute force my way through it because I don't need to have higher brain

[06:08] function and that's not an insult I'm just saying like you're not like thinking of creative things

[06:12] you didn't mean you're just you're working the work but when it comes to like writing or or

[06:17] making presentations or communication of some sort it's more I try and optimize around how can I

[06:22] maximize over a week how much flow state I can be in so I can just get the most total quality output.

[06:29] So it's not about rules it's more like which of these things has a high-slake who do

[06:33] what's up Chris off in one podcast you said that your most feared decision in life was to

[06:39] quit your job when you were 22 or 23. My question is what advice would you give to your younger

[06:45] self if you could in that exact situation? When you have nothing to lose it also makes it the best

[06:52] time to make high-risk decisions because you have disproportionate upside. Not quitting if you want

[06:59] to do something else like if you have this desire to do something else is like not taking a stranger up

[07:04] on a free lottery ticket on the street if they give you a free lottery ticket and you lose you're

[07:10] back to not having anything if you win then your life changes forever and so I think a lot of people

[07:16] place a disproportionate amount of weight on the opinions of other people who are going to judge them

[07:20] in the short term because quitting your job is short term pain for long term fulfillment if that's

[07:26] what you want to pursue because the short term pain comes for the judgment of others and likely

[07:30] a back step in income but long term you're working on the thing that you want to be working on.

[07:35] Now if you like your job and that probably doesn't apply to those people but like if you're in

[07:39] that situation it's really a long term short term sacrifice which a lot of people are able to make.

[07:44] The second question let's think that my audience don't know anything about Laela except

[07:49] that she's your partner but I think she's she has exceptional knowledge and she's a really good

[07:55] personality. If you could only tell one story about her that makes a complete picture about her what

[08:01] would it be? So Laela quit her job to join me to start Jim launch this is when we were doing

[08:06] turn around so we're flying around the country so she quit her job after knowing me for only a month

[08:11] and then started basically living with me in motel rooms she had built up a book of business

[08:15] so she was actually giving up something that she spent two years building to pursue this thing

[08:19] with me and we were new like we had just started dating. About six months into that I told her that

[08:25] I needed a break and she actually asked me if she was like it sounds like you don't really want

[08:30] me to be here do you want me to leave and I was like yes that would be great. I had just lost all the

[08:34] money from the partner I had this location that I had to either shut shut down and had no cash to do it

[08:41] and I had to service all these contracts that didn't have the money to service and I also had like

[08:45] three other businesses that I was trying to run at the same time at a car factory agency. I had

[08:49] my gyms I had Jim launch the turn around business. I had a dental agency all of those with different

[08:53] partners and I was the one who did marketing sales for all of it and so I was just so spread thin and so

[08:59] she I needed to generate money to basically pay the bills of the gym that I couldn't pit that the

[09:05] money had just gone out the door for right after me saying I don't think we should be together

[09:08] she had to leave like the next day to go to Hawaii to launch a gym for this guy that she's no

[09:14] underdating that she quit everything to leave tough situation that nine out of nine out of a

[09:19] hundred girls would have just said no they would have been like I'm just going to go back home and

[09:22] you know trying to get all my clients back but she didn't do that so she flew out to Hawaii

[09:26] I didn't have enough money to give her like a nice place and so I had her split an Airbnb with five

[09:32] guys five dudes in the Leyla not ideal and so she worked out of the Airbnb and well realistic she

[09:38] worked out of the gym most of the time and did the biggest launch that we'd ever done and so like when

[09:42] my world was crumbling around me and I really needed her to come through she's to tall and she

[09:47] did it in a time that I probably didn't deserve that level of loyalty because I hadn't shown her any

[09:52] and so she did that and then I made enough money from her launching that gym that I could pay off all

[09:58] the bills of the gym that was going under that I just lost all the money on to basically come out

[10:03] breaking even so that we could actually go back all in on gym launching get rid of the other companies

[10:09] oh man I think I haven't heard this story before what what's been through through your mind I

[10:15] I can't really believe this and understand it well when she did that I wanted to be with her she had

[10:22] extended me loyalty that I had not given her that there was probably a few defining moments in our

[10:26] relationship that was the first big one thank you very much for sharing this the next one is

[10:31] kind of basic question but I'm really curious about that so what was your biggest takeaway of

[10:36] writing hundred million offers and those are hundred million leads the offers just a

[10:40] teagig question that influences all aspects of the business and is also a mental exercise that

[10:45] people can feel like they're making progress on their offer a lot faster leads is a lot more about

[10:50] activity and implementation and so people can get ideas from like the lead magnet chapter but then you

[10:55] have to start reaching out to people posting content or running ads to start getting leads in the door

[11:00] right and so there's a little bit bigger of a hurdle with leads than there is offers but it's also

[11:05] the main driver of business is letting people know about your stuff and so I think that many people

[11:10] will mentally masturbate to the idea of making these amazing offers but I think form people make money

[11:16] by actually letting people know about their stuff which is leads what went through when through

[11:20] your mind when when you re-virted for the 18th or 19th time so unless I can work once and have

[11:26] something provide value on an ongoing basis which is a high leverage activity then it makes no sense

[11:32] I think most people shouldn't write books because the amount of work it takes to make a great

[11:36] book that actually lasts the tough to time is extremely difficult and think I read a blog post where

[11:41] they said how to write a blogbuster blog post and there was a chart where they said if you put

[11:47] in like 100 hours to write only one blog post there maybe will be a million views but if you put like

[11:54] 50 hours there maybe will be just 10,000 views it's exactly that there's diminishing

[12:00] marginal return but an increase in exponential increase in absolute returns you know the gold

[12:05] gold medal sprinter in the Olympics versus the silver medalist like from a business context the

[12:11] person who's at the gold medalist might have worked 10 times more right to get this much more out

[12:18] but what's the difference in absolute of gold versus silver everything just being this much better

[12:22] people are like well I don't want to work 50 more hours to be this much better but being this

[12:26] much better might make you the best at that whatever the blog post is or that business or that

[12:31] solution and the amount of winter takes all the economy has shifted towards people want the lowest

[12:37] risk solution and so if you have the best solution then it is the lowest risk thing to buy and so

[12:43] to be number one versus number two 80% of the economics sometimes 90% of the economics go to number one

[12:49] and so it makes absolute sense to work 10 times harder even though you might only be this much better

[12:55] from a marginal perspective on the chart of rankings that might make you 10 times higher some context

[13:01] we have like a book summary application where we give also exercises and deep student plan on the book

[13:07] what's your average stake on on books and I mean book summaries is it good did you use them before

[13:14] I don't read many book summaries most of the because you rely on the person who's doing the summarizing

[13:19] to find what they think is the most viable thing for you right because a lot of times what I find

[13:23] if I read a book the the nuggets that I find are not the main concepts it's actually the details if you

[13:27] don't know anything about a topic then the summaries are great to give you a lot of sort of framework to

[13:31] understand the rest of the information that you're going to consume but once you have a basic understanding

[13:35] it's in the edges which is where you can expand your knowledge right and so there's there's not a lot of

[13:39] shortcuts to getting really good at something now a bit of selfish question but I'm really curious about

[13:44] you're thinking yeah okay so you remember you had a video where you scaled a no-street business

[13:50] to 50 million in six minutes could you do this with the books on the right app basically do a

[13:54] breakdown of a book some such an application yeah it's a it's a subscription based application yeah

[13:59] got it what's the price point uh 10 dollar okay what's else which turn I think 15 to 20

[14:04] quarter from monthly or yearly monthly monthly got it um so you have to fix that first at the end of the

[14:11] day everything's going to be cactl to be so like if there was one single metric that I'm going to

[14:15] look at a business it's cactl to be ratio so I'm sure cost me to get somebody and how much I make

[14:19] from them over the lifetime until that metric is better than the competition so like Blinkist

[14:25] right I think that's a one that's like that I would have to look at their LTV and what are the

[14:29] things that they're doing that like why am I why are going to people going to come to me versus

[14:33] that right so either I have to be more niche in my selection of books so that I'll have a wider

[14:38] selection for a narrower audience like competing at Amazon's very tough but if you if you if you

[14:43] you niche down into a specific topic then you can actually have a wider selection because Blink

[14:47] is just going to take the the best sellers right for every every category because that's going to be

[14:51] the the most people and their VC back and their funded making a quark customers that are lost

[14:55] for a long period of time a quark market share and unless that's the game you're trying to play

[14:58] then you have to play different which is I want to I want to be really specific about the out of

[15:02] a tar that I want to go after and so that's where you do a little bit of research ahead of time and say okay

[15:07] is there an underserved market that might actually a have a big reading preference so like sales

[15:11] people is one of the most common professions on planet earth from a personality perspective how many

[15:15] sales guys read all the time I don't know I would have to I would have to look into that and so

[15:18] you might be like okay well sales guys aren't the guy but maybe HR specialist read a ton okay

[15:23] well if they read a ton and there's like Blink is might have one book on HR but I could put 100

[15:27] different things that are related to that or one degree separated and then I can create the illusion

[15:32] of a wider selection of topics but around a narrower narrower avatar or concept right I would start

[15:38] there and then over time you can expand if you if you want to and just reach you know you go

[15:42] adjacent you go to finance or you go to whatever like this is me just spitballing again like I did the

[15:47] no strip thing from the the economics perspective you have to get LTV to the point where like your

[15:52] insurance should be under 3% in order to make this really work once it's under 3% monthly yeah

[15:59] monthly I mean ideally you want to maintain 80% annually at least if you want this thing to be a

[16:03] big thing all of my attention would be only focused on that like until you fix that there's no

[16:08] opponent in a corner customer's because there's going to fall out the back like there's literally no

[16:11] point because then you're also getting lots of people in that will then say that that things sucks

[16:16] you know I mean I'm not saying it sucks but I'm just saying like they're they're a friend of

[16:19] theirs is going to say hey I sign up for this thing they're going to be like oh I tried I didn't like it

[16:22] and then they're like oh okay maybe I won't I won't stick on it I want to be so quiet about what I'm

[16:26] building until all my metrics are right and then I want to blow the doors off but most people want

[16:30] to keep hitting these income goals rather than looking at the metrics of the business that are actually

[16:35] going to drive the long term books like anyone can market their way to a 100,000 or a million

[16:40] a month even with an app like this if you blow enough money enough people find out about you can do it but

[16:44] then you can only maintain it as long as you're spending that much money the moment you you're

[16:48] your spend drops you're income drops and that's not a business that I want to be a part of our

[16:52] USB is that we are doing we are we are in Hungary and we are doing it in Hungarian and there is no other

[16:58] application in Hungarian okay that's great if we scale to maybe Poland we would do it in Polish and not in English

[17:05] and that's a USB I like that and I mean then at that point I would just look at

[17:09] I tried model as closely as I possibly can the number one player in the US from a UX perspective

[17:16] from the selection of titles all that kind of stuff and then I would and I would see if my metrics

[17:20] change if I do that if not then it's like there's some assumption that I'm basing this business

[17:23] off of that's not right in the denny mirror on the podcast I think you told about skills

[17:27] whereas just math skills could you expand these maybe a meta skills a skill that helps you acquire

[17:33] learning how to read is a meta skill like learning how to learn is a meta skill

[17:38] with the broadest brush stroke the all the way chunked up learning to learn well quickly and retain

[17:43] information and be able to implement it is is a skill you give a hundred people a course right that's

[17:49] free the difference is the people who are going to be successful and not successful are the ones who

[17:52] already have sufficient meta skills to be able to then use the information and implement it like

[17:57] at one polar extremely you've got somebody who's completely incompetent right who like you have to

[18:01] teach them how to turn on a computer and on the other extreme I can say go build me a company

[18:05] and the person can do it so this person can translate a directive into each of the sub buckets

[18:10] and knows how to do that and so it's really like your success percentage basically is predetermined

[18:16] by how low you break down the skill requirements for someone to be successful so like the reason

[18:21] that I write the books at the grade level that I do isn't so that people who are experts don't

[18:27] get value from it it's so that it makes it even easier for experts and it makes it attainable for

[18:32] people who don't know so I can get 70% of people who read the book to get leads versus 10% of people

[18:39] to get leads if I just cut out some of the steps and made assumptions about their skill level the last

[18:44] 10 or 20% the people who are experts are still going to benefit from I'm just also going to include

[18:48] turn on your computer here's how you do that and from the software perspective with what you're doing

[18:53] that's also how you get a way larger percentage of your clients to activate typically we make

[18:57] assumptions because we assume that every customer is just like us and so they have the same

[19:01] meta skills as us and they have the same interpretation or perception of the world and the UX and so

[19:05] that assumption isn't true like all you have to do is and I'm sure you've done this like you look at

[19:09] people scrolling on your app and you see the heat maps and you're like why are they clicking that

[19:12] button because they have different skills and experiences that they bring into the table and so

[19:16] then we just continue to accommodate it break it down to the level that you could show it to a

[19:20] three year old and they would immediately know how to use it like the fact that babies learn how to

[19:24] use iPods is an indication of how simple they have made it to humans to use and that's why they

[19:31] have such massive option how will you teach someone how to learn we already know how to learn

[19:36] it's just that most people don't know how to teach everybody learn stuff all the time right if I

[19:40] if you touch a stove and it's hot and it burns you you learn not to do it again like learning is

[19:47] natural like we all learn but people who want to teach a specific behavior don't know how to do it

[19:52] and so it really just comes down to three things which is what do I reward what do I punish and what

[19:56] do I extinguish right so reward is you give a carrot right after someone does something punishes you

[20:01] you know you zap them you smack them after they do something or extinguish as you do nothing

[20:05] right so if your wife walks in and she got her her nails painted neon orange and you don't like it

[20:10] you might not want a puncher because that's probably going to have negative ramifications in the

[20:14] but you might extinguish it so you might not say anything about the nails or you might say something

[20:18] different she's like do you like my nails I might save something back like I'm happy that you got what you want

[20:23] what we're doing is what behavior are we training and so if you think about learning or teaching

[20:27] as training I think it's a much more useful word to think through because at the end of the day

[20:32] you have only taught someone if there be behavior changes in the same context as in if I want you to

[20:39] see these words when the phone rings and if I say cool we're going to put you through this training

[20:42] and then the phone rings and then you don't say the words you have not learned and I have not taught

[20:47] you and so it's how many times can I simulate this experience this stimulus the context so that I can

[20:55] have them do the behavior I want within the context that's going to trigger it and then reward them

[21:01] immediately and that's how you have a feedback loop that trains people to do something so that is

[21:05] by this tricks in the application and the gamification and those stuff how would you restructure

[21:10] the education system if you could yeah sorry for this question no you're good you're good I would

[21:16] focus almost exclusively on meta skills teaching people how to learn step one and then teaching

[21:20] people the things that are the next level underneath which is learning how to write learning how to read

[21:25] learning how to speak learning how to do math like those are the those are the building blocks of

[21:29] everything else that follows and in the school of the school of Alex or the school of Formosi everyone passes

[21:36] only when you learn there are only 100% and you continue to do it until you learn like the arbitrary

[21:42] division of grades along age is ridiculous to me and I think if there were a lot more clarity around

[21:47] the goal which is like until you can read 10 pages out loud without making a mistake you do not move on

[21:54] if you can do that in the day fantastic if it takes you a year okay I don't judge you on that

[21:59] it's just how long will it take you to learn the skill to a good buddy of mine Dr. Kashi taught

[22:04] an autistic kid how to read he couldn't stay still reading for more than one word at a time and then

[22:09] he would like half fits or whatever and so he came to train the child on how to read with a bag of

[22:15] skittles and so when the kid would read a word he would give them a skittle when he would read more

[22:20] words in a row than he ever had like a record he would give them two skittles so he rewarded the

[22:26] behavior and then he had big bonus rewards when he would unlock a new level and so he kept doing that

[22:31] and within one afternoon he had a reading a full page what is the behavior that I want to reward

[22:35] how can I reward more of it now none of it was punishing he didn't smack him when he messed up

[22:40] when he read less he still gave him one reward for the activity and then when he read more

[22:44] he would give an extra reward as the kid becomes less full on skittles and he's like you know sugar

[22:48] he like doesn't want any skills anymore the skittles become a proxy for approval and they work just the same

[22:53] how do you know that went to went to punish went to reward went to extinguish we try very hard

[23:00] to almost exclusively reward because punishment changes behavior faster reward changes behavior

[23:08] longer it just takes longer to work right like if if someone you know calls me Alex and I don't

[23:13] like that and I slap them and I say never call me that again I might change their behavior really

[23:17] quickly if I leave the room and someone else says walks in they might say I was talking to Alex

[23:23] because I'm not there to punish them and so punishment only works as long as the source of punishment is there

[23:29] and the person doesn't get accustomed to the punishment because punishment itself becomes

[23:33] de-sensitized over time and so to effectively punish someone if you want to consistently punish

[23:38] then you have to increase the intensity and variety of punishment over time because otherwise

[23:41] people get de-sensitized to it if you're always mean in yell at all of your employees eventually they

[23:45] stop caring so you have to increase the level of your threats right you then have to say I'm going

[23:50] to fire you I'm going to kill you right you have to make these threats increase because you've

[23:53] created you increase the intensity and the variety of how you claim to punish them reward you can

[23:59] reward long enough that you can then extend the gaps between reward to eventually you don't need

[24:04] a reward anymore and people will continue to do the activity because they have always done it so he's the

[24:08] exact example we did the cashian de-gui yeah I would imagine if he was doing this over and

[24:14] ever going to he'd prove the point none of he's not like a full-time reading teacher the concept

[24:18] is that he would read and then maybe the next time he comes in he gives him a skittle every other time he

[24:23] reads and the next time I'm going to every third time and the next time I've been only when he

[24:29] hits a new record if I can get the kid to read long enough that he actually starts to like the story

[24:33] then the story starts to reward in and of itself and then I can move away and then the kid reads

[24:38] without me and so fundamentally that's what you try to do when he train any activities that most

[24:42] people who are experts at anything get rewarded from the activity itself because once you develop a

[24:47] level of mastery in the skill you enjoy it because you're good at it so we hope I hope we will meet again

[24:53] and they just speak longer thank you very much dude I appreciate you crystal thank you so much thank you

[24:57] for inviting your community and hopefully your community got value from the event and hopefully

[25:00] they use the books and and grow the economy and hungry and and all get you know way way better

[25:05] at whatever it is they're done you are incredibly committed to education and self improvement

[25:12] how do you select what you will pursue for education there's so many possible topics

[25:18] so what process do you go through to select what you're going to be educating yourself on and

[25:25] how do you also select potentially someone to educate you on that topic we do everything

[25:29] off of the theory constraints at happens is not common which is basically that a system will

[25:32] grow until it's constrained until it's limits so it's kind of like the idea of the the weakest

[25:36] link right so it's it's finding what the weakest link in the chain is with the constraint of the

[25:41] so that we can deconstrain it and then grow to the next natural constraint it's a very simplistic

[25:45] look but it's extremely effective because it just cuts down all the noise into like if I had to pick

[25:49] one thing that is the big limitation of this business what would it be and so then we just get

[25:52] laser laser focused on solving that one problem solve that problem and then we move on to the next

[25:57] constraint and if we solve that problem and the business doesn't grow then we pick the wrong constraint

[26:01] and so sometimes the constraint is your ability to judge what the constraint is which is why

[26:04] you know wisdom is one of the hardest things to earn which comes from experience right is that you're

[26:08] able to you know recognize patterns and so for me right now to answer the other part of the

[26:13] question which I'm focused on learning about brand stuff right now so brand is my big topic

[26:18] that I've been diving really deep on brand and media and I'll probably write a book on brand just

[26:23] from the findings that I have because I don't think there's many good books on brand because you can

[26:26] I could read you 20 different different definitions of brand and branding and they all sound like

[26:30] cockamani and so coming up with an operationalized version of what that means so that it can actually be

[26:35] useful and I've tried to learn the stuff so that I can use it and then whatever I learn I just

[26:40] you know pass it forward because branding for me despite being now quote known for this or like

[26:46] an organic content guy I'm only been in this two years like this is brand new to me like I you know

[26:50] I've way more experience on the paid outside that's what I did last decade and I you know people

[26:54] got to see a tiny taste of that when I was launching the book but that's that's the big thing is

[26:58] finding out what the constraint of the business is and if you need to chunk all the way up it's

[27:01] if you want to grow business you have to sell more clients or make them worth more or decrease risk

[27:07] those are the those are the things that are going to grow the value of a company and so

[27:12] simply asking the question like why do we not have 10 times more customers or why we not making 10 times more

[27:16] money and then figuring out what the answer that question is oftentimes is the constraint just because

[27:21] you're saying hey I'm current educating myself on branding and that's fresh for you what would you say is

[27:27] like a major takeaway in terms of education for the topic of branding that you're just like

[27:32] I wish I would have maybe known this right start of the try to learn about this two years ago

[27:37] this is like a Pandora's box if I start talking about it it might be like 10 minutes so I

[27:41] I can I can riff on it but like Buckling the audience so if we look at the origins of what a brand is

[27:48] right where do brands come from brand comes when you brand cattle right that was the original use of a brand

[27:54] and so why would you brand cattle because you want to change the behavior of people who look at the

[27:59] cattle so if you have a cattle that doesn't have a brand and the cattle that does the people who are

[28:02] looking at it what behave differently if the cow doesn't have a brand I might take the cow for myself

[28:06] or I might kill it or I might eat it I might do whatever but if the cow has a brand on it and I know the

[28:11] guy I might return the cow to him right so it changes what I do all right that's important point

[28:16] so the point of a brand is to change or elicit a desired behavior in the widest percentage of

[28:21] your target audience right now how do you do that you do that by making associations between

[28:26] something they don't know your brand in the beginning with something that they do know that is positive

[28:31] and rewarding if that's what you want right and so the index is a 4x4 box of what brand

[28:37] really is you have the the direction so you've got a waveform in towards and then you've got strength

[28:42] so very high and very low so you know if you have a really weak thing that's a waveform it's like

[28:49] I kind of don't like this thing you know slow wifi you know like bad brand on the flip side you

[28:55] might have a political party which depending on the audience might be super strong and away from

[29:01] or towards now Taylor Swift for example would be some of that I would say is a very strong brand

[29:05] and towards there's not a lot of people who really hate Taylor Swift and a lot of people who really

[29:10] love Taylor Swift right so it's positive and it's strong right somebody like Ray Romano if you heard that

[29:15] you know they're like Tim Allen from the old sitcom days might be someone who is positive but

[29:19] weak a lot of people know who he is am I going to show up to his event probably not the idea is that

[29:25] in order to build a brand we simply pair things that people know things that they don't know the

[29:31] things they don't know is our logo our tagline our company with things that they do know and think

[29:36] are positive if you were to think about the brand is a bouquet of flowers it's like having many

[29:42] flowers in a bouquet and so if I were to break the bouquet and spread all the flowers there is no

[29:46] bouquet but simply by gathering them together by making associations I create something new and that

[29:52] bundle of associations is the brand now if I were to break one of the flowers I make it rotten it would

[29:58] affect the appearance of the entire brand and so that's why if you make a single mistake a

[30:02] Dylan Mulvaney move for Bud Light you can affect the entire brand if I get a DUI or somebody you

[30:09] know gets you know accused of doing some sort of terrible heinous act right it affects the entire brand

[30:14] our Kelly Bad Brand now right despite all of the positive the one broken rose or the one rotten

[30:20] flower affects the entire bouquet we have to be very deliberate about what associations we want to make

[30:25] with our own brand so that we can continue to positively associate ourselves and the point of the brand

[30:31] is that we get a desired action or behavior from a specific audience the idea of growing the brand

[30:37] a lot of times is that you sacrifice some audience for other audiences so like when I was

[30:41] starting making content I did it in my closet right and there was some hardcore people in the O.G.

[30:46] Mozi media days that are like I appreciate you that were like man I missed the closet videos right

[30:53] now I might have lost some of those people when we started making a little bit more polished videos

[30:57] it's some people not all right I traded I traded losing some audience to gain more when you are

[31:02] making a brand move you're basically always making a bet that you will gain more of your desired

[31:07] audience then you lose by making a change and so you can approximate or slowly move a brand over time

[31:15] by making more associations in one direction and fewer associations in the other and so that's

[31:19] you can move a brand over time but light made a wrong bet they thought and maybe this is just a

[31:25] corporate group thing right that if they made an association deal with a lady that they were going

[31:29] to get more people to buy their beer that I mean fundamentally the the only reason you do it is

[31:33] a company right you believe that long to bring it more people to buy your beer the problem was that

[31:38] wasn't true now the interesting thing is that there probably are people who are a big fan of that

[31:43] move it's just that there were more people who weren't they were far away right there were more

[31:47] people who were not a fan of that move and so that became an away from association and so that is what

[31:52] I am trying to encapsulate and put together into how to brand because now that I feel like I

[31:59] understand it a little bit I see it as in my opinion you know it's kind of like Neil in the matrix

[32:05] when you're talking to more fiasc and he says so you tell me that I can dodge bullets more fiasc

[32:10] well when you're ready you won't have to and so we learn all these tactics about sales and

[32:16] marketing and shop rates and CRO hacks and all this shit but if you have a brand if you see

[32:21] the matrix everyone shows up to your calls no one has price objections everyone is excited and

[32:27] refers their friends it just takes longer to make associations because fundamentally all branding is

[32:33] is teaching you are teaching someone to do something you want them to behave a certain way

[32:39] and you have this red red card and when you see red it means stop it's all we're doing so green

[32:44] lights have strong associate strong brands they're positive everyone loves green lights right like

[32:50] it's a simple thing just known owns it but green lights are a great positive association it's a

[32:54] great brand right and so that's that's the idea of what I'm what I'm kind of diving more into and I see

[32:59] it as the ultimate cheat code for business it just takes long time to do and most people are patient

[33:04] you're telling me I can dodge business problems I'm telling you that once you have a brand

[33:09] they become a relevant you talk about deleting problems as your favorite way of solving them yes

[33:17] how do you decide what's the lead of all versus what's not because I can imagine the

[33:23] the person who really loves that strategy doing nothing and just deleting all problems so how do you

[33:28] prioritize the problem worth solving versus a problem that is believable? Well it's just percentage

[33:33] likely ahead of impact chunking all the way up to like will this cost me number of sales like sales

[33:39] velocity will this decrease lifetime value of customers and will this increase or decrease the likelihood

[33:45] whatever I'm doing right now continue to occur so we're trying to value a company right we look at

[33:49] what's the sales velocity how many customers they sell what's the lifetime value of every customer

[33:52] because then you can extrapolate what their run rates are going to be at at scale at max unless we change

[33:56] something and then you divide that by risk which is how likely is it that there's going to be an

[34:00] outside event that's going to change this thing from continuing to occur this box of making money

[34:06] how likely is that they will it will continue to grow or at least stay the same and so if I have a

[34:10] problem I have to be able to track it back to one of those three things and if it doesn't really

[34:14] track one of those three things or there's another problem that has a much higher likelihood impact

[34:18] in terms of it's higher likely and it has a greater effect size than I'm going to prioritize that

[34:23] it's just that oftentimes if someone's like man I really think we should change the colors on the

[34:27] site I would just say like what's the likelihood like I had been notorious for having ugly

[34:31] as shit sites my entire career and you can make brandy make associations and I think there's there's

[34:35] an argument there but what's the likelihood that it's going to affect how many companies do you

[34:40] deal with us it hasn't up to this point and so is it a constraint of the business no is it something

[34:46] that I could improve absolutely there's also a hundred other things I could improve I could also

[34:49] send more emails which I don't do like there's lots of things I could do but what are the few

[34:54] things or the one thing that matters most which then ladders back up to what is the constraint of

[34:57] the business if I look at the highest price competitor in my market and I one off them and then

[35:04] they want to me potentially like is there ever a point in which we just say like we're price

[35:09] premium enough or do we always have to go for the top like how do you make the determination of

[35:13] premium there's basically four positions in the market you have luxury although at the top

[35:18] which is significantly a veblin good which basically which means when I increase the price

[35:23] demand goes up and that's because there's an association with the price that makes it more

[35:28] valuable so the fact that everyone knows how expensive it is affects the value that I get that I get

[35:32] from it the fact that everyone knows the Rolex is a hundred grand the one that I'm wearing whatever

[35:37] then I actually it makes the Rolex more valuable so it becomes a virtuous cycle which is why

[35:41] LVMH is one of the most valuable companies in the world then you have premium which is basically

[35:45] the above average so it's there you have to pair utility with the premium in luxury the

[35:52] print the the extra price tag is the value whereas with premium like BMW is premium they're not luxury

[36:01] they're a little bit better at a lot of stuff and see you pay premium because it is a little bit

[36:04] they use better materials it breaks less whatever right and so then you have your you know your mid

[36:09] tier your your run of the mill your commoditized space which sucks and then you have your low cost

[36:13] leaders which they make their entire business on how can I drive efficiencies in operations at

[36:19] all levels of the business so that I can be the lowest price person the marketplace right and still

[36:24] make a profit to to route to your question of like when is enough enough the key indicator for me

[36:31] and most of this like that quote higher ticket world you're not luxury goods the fact that it's

[36:35] expensive is not the reason that people want to buy it right it's so it's actually technically a premium

[36:40] I'm more sure remember the price to value discrepancy than anything else and a lot of people get

[36:45] in a trouble because they raise the price so much that it is it just an excess of the value they

[36:51] and so then they actually create a negative experience like if Chipotle were $50 people would probably

[36:56] not like Chipotle even though the product is really good but at $50 I don't know and so the

[37:02] reason to probably so viral you know I mean it's like the price to value discrepancy is so good

[37:06] that they tell their friends right and so that's where this kind of marriage of how can I just short

[37:11] circuit people's brains from value perspective which is what I what what I try to do with the books and

[37:16] the courses so that it becomes viral in its own and then my cost to a car customers is zero

[37:21] and so then everything after that is just gravy are the four variables when you're using this as you've

[37:26] got the price the value at the top which is what they get right the price is what they pay you've got

[37:34] your cost of goods to deliver and then you have your profit leftover and so it's playing with those

[37:40] four variables so that you can maximize the the amount of absolute profit that the company makes

[37:47] pricing high has become shorthand and where I think people get a lot of benefit from the

[37:52] offers book is that when you price higher you automatically weed out shitty customers and I think

[37:57] many times that is the real reason that a lot of people's businesses grow from that price now obviously

[38:03] there's more profit there's you have excess things that you can you can deliver on but a lot of

[38:08] people don't actually take that excess money to create a better experience they do a gotcha

[38:12] and then they never get anything from that customer again and so that's the wrong way to use it

[38:17] but if I had to think like okay what are the reasons that you know company might be successful

[38:20] with a discharge premium is that they actually reinvest the the premium price into a superior product

[38:27] and they are very clear about the avatar that they go after and what the quantitative requirements

[38:33] are that are black and white that they know from looking at their best customers their top 20

[38:37] top 5% of customers and then saying we're only going to cater to these customers in the future

[38:41] because the likely that we can give them a great outcome is higher and then that can create you know

[38:46] you can merit or earn the premium that you have because you have data that supports that if you

[38:51] are this type of person we can get you this type of result what does the ideal experience with an

[38:56] accounting firm look like to you and I ask because one of the things that stuck with me is you said you've

[39:02] never done your own books like you've always considered that something that was delegatable important

[39:06] and delegated you've also referenced bringing I believe accountants in house kind of going back and

[39:11] forth between outsource and in house so what does that ideal relationship look like to you now and

[39:16] maybe what did that ideal relationship look like when you were going through your first you know

[39:21] seven figure and eight figure company a lot of professional services should look at wifi for inspiration

[39:28] you're like what does that even mean you don't you don't want to like clap when the wifi is working

[39:32] you just notice when it doesn't and so you just want it to be in the background you just want it to

[39:37] work right and so a lot of companies are like that like there's a lot of services that people think they need to like

[39:42] over you know communicates stuff on like I just want the financials to be accurate and I want them to be

[39:46] timely that's it and I want things broken down in a way that allows me to make business decisions and

[39:53] that's where like I think the the the top tier of accountants transform into fractional CFO and

[39:59] CFO kind of materials where they actually help you use this data to make informed decisions about the

[40:03] business is there a way that I can translate what we do into how it would affect a business owner's life so I'll

[40:09] tell you a little story because I think this might be really relevant this will be really relevant for you guys

[40:14] so one of our portfolio companies has had a ton of growth three years they went from one location to I think we're at

[40:19] 38 locations now right all stuff funded off cash flow all right so really really tremendous growth

[40:25] in three years and it's compounding so it's growing faster and faster and when we were at about 30 locations

[40:32] we were stuck at 30 locations for like two quarters and so I got on the phone with the CEO and

[40:38] he was like dude I just I just feel like I don't know how many locations I can open based on cash flow

[40:45] and because they had net receivable is where a little bit extended things like that right I like

[40:49] shook the screen for sake as it was so cool I was like I need you to freeze frame this feeling you have right now

[40:54] it's like okay I was like think about this feeling you have I was like what you are feeling

[40:58] is finance as the constraint of your business you do not have a finance function that is operationalized enough

[41:04] like you do not like you are undeveloped in the finance function you have a bookkeeper who's not that good

[41:08] as soon as you like I could see it just clicked I was like that is the constraint of the business until we get the

[41:12] finance function in you're going to just be operating blind and then once you know we have this much cash flow

[41:18] we can open two locations a month or three locations a month and you can be more aggressive with everything

[41:22] else because you're confident that you're not bankrupting the company accidentally on your own

[41:27] if I were an accounting firm I would try and pinpoint the problems and relate them to how it's going

[41:32] to affect growth in the business like how is the constraint so that you can talk in the language

[41:38] that a business owner is going to understand like they just how many I'll bet you like I can see everyone's hands

[41:43] how many people in your audience all the business owners go to the right go to the bottom

[41:48] and say so we made more money this month great and so I think adding that level of strategy

[41:55] of like by the way I think this is a little fat compared to other companies that we're looking at

[42:00] this is a little bit under compared to other companies we're looking at and this might be an

[42:03] area of opportunity little things like that that actually add value to the business if I were

[42:09] somebody who is in charge of it. I'd like to get this answer in less than 60 seconds because I have

[42:13] I know we got to go and I want to be respectful of your time this has been incredibly informative

[42:17] how much of a skill should you develop or how much should you educate yourself before hiring

[42:23] for it so for example like do I need to be a sales manager before hiring for sales management

[42:30] what you what you hit at is one of the hardest parts of business you need to make an informed

[42:35] decision without context which is why being an entrepreneur you end to becoming a jack-a-ball trade

[42:40] so that you can have enough context to make at least an informed decision and so I'm going to steal

[42:45] a playbook out of oops for long shoulder there we go out of Laylist book here and I'll give you my

[42:49] tactic around this which is you want to interview for people who are sales managers and you don't

[42:54] want to hire anyone for a little bit which sounds tough but what you want to do is you basically

[42:58] want to interview for information now if you meet a gold star that's amazing but you want to talk

[43:04] to people and if you know more about it than they do and they should be teaching you and once you

[43:09] talk to 10 20 people they're basically like expert interviews for what it should look like and so

[43:15] then you get a very good idea of what the role should look like after listening to people and you'll

[43:20] get an understanding of the level of nuance and I'll give you this one little tidbit that is

[43:25] super powerful when it comes to judging skill the quality and quantity of data that someone

[43:30] chooses to collect around their particular department is almost directly proportional to their

[43:36] skill and so for example I have lots of marketers where like I'm going to meet my products amazing

[43:41] and I say cool tell me your metrics are I was like what's time to value right what are the

[43:45] key activation points like what's turned right like just some of these metrics and they're like

[43:50] we'll do our refund rates really well right but I'm like okay I was like well what about the marketing

[43:54] side they're like well cpm's are this this is our click-through rate this is our you know this is

[43:58] our conversion on the page this is our percentage the schedule is our percentage the show this is

[44:01] percentage open rate this is percentage click like they go through all this stuff and I'm like right

[44:05] so I can see very clearly that you're a better marketer than you are product and so simply

[44:11] getting an idea of the quality and quantity of the data that someone collects around their

[44:16] department will get like when we hired our director of people it was the first time that I had

[44:20] someone actually tell me metrics I'd never heard of and I was like she's the lady she's the girl

[44:25] my community loves you and that's all we are here and I literally got like 150 questions I had to

[44:31] narrow it down to five or six it was so hard you mentioned something in the uh 100 million

[44:36] of that to hit your first 100k you don't need a lot you just need an offer to sell and that's

[44:41] exactly what we did but right now we're hitting a bottleneck and our biggest bottleneck is operations

[44:47] and you know how exactly you got how to have gym lunch operation because we have a very similar

[44:53] business model for and also this providers for what service providers mostly agencies and digital

[44:58] consultants with the generation and sales where we do it as with a 101 consulting and in a group

[45:03] coaching format so coaching models in general tend to be very difficult to scale because the

[45:08] reason people come to use for expertise in order to get other people to provide that expertise then

[45:14] you have to create lots of experts who then eventually walk off and start the business on every

[45:18] half of taking customers with them I would say like there's a couple different approaches so the first

[45:22] is that there's a law firm and the McKinsey kind of consulting model there's a attract to become a

[45:27] partner in the business and then that's kind of the whole business structure so there's a

[45:31] way to share in the profits they do make lots of money but the owners of those end up having to

[45:35] loot themselves out not that there's anything wrong with that you can make lots of money doing

[45:38] but that is that is a version of the model the other way is to productize the basically get

[45:44] narrower on the solution that you're providing and productize it to the greatest degree possible

[45:48] so that anyone could do it even if they have no knowledge of it in terms of like the implementation

[45:52] of the thing that is more the direction that we went with Jim lunch because we had a very specific

[45:58] we don't even we didn't even work with all gyms just to show how narrow we were with it we worked

[46:02] with only micro gyms we have now expanded to health clubs as well the five or six years that I was

[46:07] doing before we sold we were only micro gyms and so just to show like how incredibly narrow that was

[46:13] someone had to have at least 30 members assigned least one employee and be running this type of model

[46:18] for them to be a customer and then if they fit all those things we could generate a lot of revenue

[46:22] using our playbooks I could have somebody who had no gym industry no expertise whatsoever and

[46:26] still say send this email say these words here's 10 recordings of people doing this exact same thing

[46:31] this is the expected value and so that's like from the delivery perspective now operating the business

[46:36] overall comes from talent and being able to find people who are just a smarter smarter than you

[46:41] and people say that but what can you actually meet somebody who's smarter than you and then they

[46:47] admire and aspect of what you've done so that they start to work for you that's where you really

[46:50] start to have the magic happen what are some of the things that agency wanted to should avoid

[46:56] doing if they're able to scale any of its students okay so what things should an agency owner avoid

[47:01] when they're trying to scale yeah yeah I mean the same things that any business owner would want to

[47:05] avoid when they're scaling agencies tend to fall into the you know they tend to fall into the bucket

[47:09] of trying to be everything to everyone so maintaining the discipline to be very focused about the

[47:13] problem that you're solving and who you're solving it for and I think that solves 90% of the

[47:18] problems from a strategic perspective for any small business owner including an agency the

[47:22] second piece is that if you're in a service based business the quality of your talent is going to

[47:26] be directly proportional to your growth because you're you're basically selling people fractionalized

[47:31] people that's what service businesses are right you're selling some level of training that you're

[47:36] able to give and having more efficiency than an individual business owner would have like the

[47:42] classic you know small business owner lead gen agency that charges $2,000 a month the idea is that

[47:48] if they were to hire somebody full-time to run these ads it would cost them $5,000 a month but you have

[47:52] collaborators designers and media buyers and pages designers who all work a fraction of their time

[47:58] for this one business and they can get it more efficiently and you can still do it at good margins

[48:02] right like that's fundamentally what service businesses are and so the quality of that talent

[48:06] and the culture that you have at the business to attract and keep that talent are the kind of the

[48:12] key or the crucial pieces of the success of the model you mentioned something in the book where

[48:17] you mentioned the agency model you hire an agency to learn the stuff and you internalize it and then

[48:23] when you have stock learning you're a place an agency but you mean we think agency models agency businesses

[48:29] how do we become irreplaceable in your perspective how should one go there should we start with

[48:34] one business then upsell the next and upsell the next and upsell the next offer.

[48:37] Creating the ears of law for isn't necessarily about having a zillion products it's more about

[48:42] explaining and communicating the many small things that you have to do anyways and so rather than

[48:46] saying like I'm going to generate leads for you that's like one outcome but there's many things

[48:50] that have to happen along the way you have to create landing pages you have to write copy you have to

[48:54] you have to have follow-up sequences you have to work the lead you have to have scheduling you have to

[48:57] you know you have to split test you have to make new creative like there's lots of things that

[49:00] have to happen in order to just get the single result and it's just making sure that we're delineating

[49:04] those things because an unbeknownst or an ignorant business owner I said ignorant in the technical

[49:08] sense like you just don't know um would have no idea what you're doing you're like yeah just go

[49:12] get me leads it's like well it's much easier said than done and if I was doing it from an

[49:15] outbound perspective I'd be like well I have to warm up the mains I have to you know spend up

[49:18] different accounts I have to split test different email openers I have to split like you have to

[49:21] explain all the steps and they're like wow there's a lot more work that goes into this now I can

[49:25] I can appropriately value this price tag that you describe to one of the services that's piece one

[49:30] in order to be irreplaceable oftentimes you'd have to go after significantly bigger customers

[49:35] if you're an agency for Fortune 1000 for Fortune 500 companies who be so costly for them to spin up

[49:41] at scale the level of town that's required to do like programmatic media buys across a hundred

[49:46] from platforms in different countries and then the likely that they want to leave or do this on their own

[49:50] is significantly lower the idea that any service provider is going to become truly irreplaceable

[49:57] like any business can do anything on their own and I would prefer to put myself out of business

[50:01] and do it in a way that aligns my customers with me then have a model that I know is basically

[50:06] has a timer for obsolescence not everybody works it's Fortune 500 companies right?

[50:11] Most of them see who many people they might work with you know a smaller medium businesses they

[50:16] help them let's say you become a marketing agency for guy or practice and you work you become so good at that

[50:21] in general people won't leave you because they're just good at that particular so that's right

[50:24] and the thing is the small business owners are really tough because they're the problem like

[50:28] they're super erratic they're super volatile they're cash flows lumpy they don't know where

[50:32] their next paychecks you can come from and to know fault of your own they can cancel because they

[50:36] just can't make payroll that month look at the biggest agencies that exist Ogle V you have Vayner

[50:41] you know is up there now who do they service massive companies why because the quality the customers are

[50:45] higher and so they know that when they sign a contract they actually stick with the contract we

[50:48] on other if you have a small business owner signs a 12 month agreement for agency services he's

[50:52] good for three months the biggest model that I've seen for small business owners for marketing perspective

[50:58] was an agency that was running $300 a month what $300 a month price point because they had figured out

[51:03] and like there's a key here is that like those business owners are so price sensitive it's not

[51:07] whether you can sell them it's whether you can keep them on their worst month the price isn't

[51:11] based on the value that you can deliver on the best month but how much you can keep on the worst month

[51:15] because that's where the term comes in the best model that I saw was doing SEO for small business

[51:21] and they had completely automated every aspect of it it was basically just a playbook and

[51:26] I think it generated reviews and maybe a couple phone calls a month but at a $300 a month price point

[51:32] if they got one or two phone calls a month it was worth it so the bar to get over to to

[51:36] a scribe value and especially on something that I call like a new sense business where it's like I know

[51:41] I should be maintaining my reputation I know I should be doing some of this stuff okay for two

[51:45] $300 a month I don't feel guilty about not doing it because this is being handled be it in a

[51:49] consulting model right what happens is some clients actually do the work they get results and some

[51:54] clients they need a lot of follow ups and they need a lot of accountability from you how do you

[51:58] maintain that like I know I'm getting very particularly into this but yeah I'm good with it great

[52:03] you talk to basically one of the core problems of all B2B businesses which is that you end up

[52:08] taking over the person's entire business until eventually they're like yeah if you could just send me

[52:12] a check every month and you do you run the business that would be awesome that's why being very

[52:15] disciplined about problem definition from the services that you provide number one and here's the

[52:19] one that everyone messes up who you pick it's not like even if you work with chiropractors right as that

[52:23] as that example you don't necessarily even want to work with all chiropractors you look at the customers

[52:27] that you have right now that are the best customers like the top 20% or the top 10% you say okay

[52:32] what characteristics do these people have that other people don't have in my client list and that's

[52:37] both from the software the hard perspective or the quantitative differences they have a certain

[52:41] size business that over a certain amount of month they have a number of locations they have a certain

[52:44] amount of employees number of customers like you just get all that data on them and then also

[52:49] what was the experience that they went through when working with me and was it different

[52:53] then some of my other customers because one of the things that happens oftentimes is that the first

[52:56] few customers you get become really sticky and then you start scaling and then you have this front

[53:01] revolving door but you still have your core business of these people that you had in the beginning right

[53:05] so why is that because these people got more help from you and actually got delivered more value

[53:10] and then you basically tried to scale without scaling the value that you delivered to the original

[53:14] right and so if you're at whatever 15,000 month and you've got five customers and they're all like

[53:18] having a great experience and you keep signing people on the keep leaving it's like okay well instead

[53:21] of me trying to sell five this month why don't I just sell one to do a great job and then not lose them

[53:27] and like that's the key to compounding and a service business once you pay down the

[53:30] in based pay down the inefficiencies of them not knowing what to do yet and being very specific

[53:35] about who you serve and who you don't like we did in work with personal trainers cycling studios

[53:40] and like yoga studios 100% could use our model we didn't work with them because the founders

[53:45] tended to be psychologically different there adherence was super low because they just come from a

[53:49] totally different world view then the guys who are more fitness, weight loss, transformation focused

[53:54] even though at the end of the day it's just a membership with a background where people work out

[53:58] but mindset wise they'd a very hard time kind of adopting a different model even though monetarily

[54:04] it totally made sense which means you need to have discipline to say no.

[54:08] Dude this is so hard to say no to this new upcoming business because you know they can help them

[54:13] but they just don't fit your criteria.

[54:15] 100% there are 13 companies I get 1800 a day who reach out.

[54:20] Well right so you have to say no it feels weird to like say no because a lot of them I get

[54:26] who are so easy to get to know most people stay poor they can't say no and what happens is

[54:30] you go for the short term money and you sacrifice the long term money because then you just get

[54:33] in this operational rat race and then you scale up your costs to meet the fact that you took on

[54:37] all these customers that you shouldn't have taken on a begin with and then you have to pay them

[54:40] every single month so then you have to keep on taking on customers that you shouldn't have taken

[54:42] on a begin with and you get in this vicious cycle that you can't get out until you downsize you take

[54:46] two steps back five steps back, fixture ego and then say I'm only working with these customers because

[54:51] I think I know that these are the ones that I have the highest likely to success with.

[54:54] Everyone else I have mediocre success and I can say it's their fault I can say it's my fault

[54:58] it doesn't really matter all that I know is that the likelihood that they achieve what I think

[55:02] they should achieve is low. Period so I'm not going to sell. I'm going to have a fair that the

[55:05] Ambo goes smaller like of course you can build a niche an inch inch wide and a mile deep.

[55:11] There's 30 million small businesses you don't need to service them. There's there's

[55:16] 50,000 gems that fit the model that we have. If you want to build a $10 billion company then

[55:20] yeah you're going to have to go after a bigger problem but if you want to build a nine figure company

[55:24] you can do that in almost any industry. So you mentioned that when you started out you started

[55:28] with the first five customer framework that was awesome and then you just grew with the reference.

[55:33] So this question came from a fitness consultant herself and she said that with the competition that

[55:38] the fitness market is how do you stand out? Honestly it's just being authentic.

[55:43] 90% of the fitness market just looks at what other influence we're doing and say I'll just

[55:46] I'll copy that and I'll do stuff like that but then you just do a worse version of what somebody's

[55:51] already doing. Zooming all the way out fitness like there's no secret. Work out more, stop eating

[55:56] shitty, you'll look better over a longer time horizon. Like that's what it is right. There's going to be a

[56:00] subset of an audience that is like you genuinely and they want to get their they could get fitness

[56:05] information from Alex but if I'm a you know a 45 year old Indian mother I'm probably not going to

[56:10] be her source for fitness information even if I say the identical stuff as another 45 year old

[56:14] Indian mother. Now if that 45 year old any mother looks at my fitness content and tries to make

[56:18] content like mine it's going to seem weird. You can stick out by actually being yourself. I know

[56:23] it sounds right but the real like this is real. There's so many unique aspects of someone's life

[56:29] and the things they're interested in compared to other people that if you just lean into those

[56:34] differences those unique aspects of things that you're actually into that are weird. Rogans into aliens

[56:39] and mushrooms and comedy and fighting who would have told him like you should be Joe Rogan and you're

[56:45] going to have people who like some aspects and then the super fans will be people who overlap on two

[56:52] or three of the interests that you have. If you picked my brand to be like dessert working out

[56:56] philosophy business marketing sales they're different. There are people who follow me because they

[57:01] only like the business money stuff. They're people follow me because they only like the philosophy

[57:04] stuff. They're people follow me because they just think that desserts and cab stuff is funny. Like it

[57:08] just depends on what someone's going to come in for but if you're just you then you can stick with

[57:12] it for the long term and that's what's going to build over time and make you quote stand out because

[57:17] there is only one version of you that's lived your life. So just live it publicly. Thanks a lot man.

[57:21] I think we had the end of our tenure. Thank you very much for being here and keep writing great books.

[57:27] I hope I hope you make so much money from the book and just in crush it because at the end of

[57:31] the day there's more problems than anyone person can solve it. I hope you build businesses to solve them.

[57:35] So explain to me how the franchise works. Yeah so we have a lot of clients with one of

[57:41] work with us and we have a lot of closures with one of work with us and y'all and I which is

[57:44] can't manage everything ourselves. Just too many people. We had two options. Option number one is

[57:50] place managers to replace us. And then give like two to three accounts, client accounts to each manager

[57:57] so they can manage them all. We can scale that way. The problem with that was that managers only

[58:02] get paid so much and they only care so much about the business itself. But when it comes to partners

[58:08] they get 50% cut. They get exactly what we are getting 50-50. The franchise thing is interesting.

[58:14] Because I feel like you would be able to achieve that simply with a profit share rather than

[58:18] getting investment in equity and all. Because if you have speed as the goal then you could basically

[58:22] do the make shift in terms because like they're assuming many of them aren't planning on selling.

[58:26] Right? And so the only reason the equity would be valuable is if they're going to sell it sometime

[58:30] in the future and buying what more locations isn't really a thing either. I would imagine that

[58:35] just like you'd be a lot faster just contract, you know basically put legal language around

[58:39] getting a profit share in the structure that you have. Like many companies have scaled sales

[58:44] or you know I mean like insurance brokerages or just massive sales orgs like real estate agents or

[58:48] massive sales orgs. And so they don't necessarily have equity, you know what I mean equity deals because

[58:53] those can just get litigious and there's lawyers and just take I'm sure you guys have already seen this.

[58:56] Like it just takes more time and I feel like there might be like you could probably remove a couple

[59:00] of components to get the same behavior which is ultimately what you're trying to do is get people who

[59:04] actually go in there. So that's just that's me just shooting right off the cuff of just looking at it.

[59:08] So that's kind of why we kind of came up with the franchise models to put like a nice barrier there.

[59:12] So it's for people who like have the experience in the space of running an agency or like

[59:17] scaling and managing how to get sales teams. But now you're getting like the infrastructure that we've

[59:21] kind of built over the past four years. I mean you can still do all that without the franchise agreement.

[59:25] But what problem are you solving? Why are you not bigger? It's a management problem.

[59:29] Just in general. We're bringing on more partners and doing it faster and doing it more in a more

[59:34] organized way. So what you said it does make sense because that will remove some friction and it

[59:40] would allow us to bring more people without risking the equity in any way.

[59:46] I mean based on the model you have you guys can own 100% of the franchise or. But even if

[59:51] it was just like the main co you can still have stream because you have the software. So

[59:56] tracking becomes the issue but since you already have that infrastructure bill the ability to just

[59:59] make sure that they get overrides. Now if you want to put a $10,000 buy in or something just because

[60:04] you feel like that increases commitment levels. I mean that's fine. But if you look at like a

[60:09] Chick-fil-A for example. If you're in the living room on their model. Yeah. Right. And so that each

[60:14] location probably costs I actually don't know the build.com. But I would imagine it costs at least a

[60:18] million probably one and a half to build a location for Chick-fil-A. And the operators put $10,000 in.

[60:23] And so it's more of a symbolic gesture than it is like the contributing capital to whatever

[60:27] the thing is. But they actually don't own equity in the business. So they get a 50-50 profit share

[60:32] after a royalty that goes to hold just looking at what they've been able to build. It seems that

[60:38] that structure works with the equity in terms of eliciting the behavior that you guys are going for.

[60:43] But for everything that you said even right at the beginning you were like well we needed something

[60:47] that was more scalable because obviously we had lots of people. There's many people who have scaled

[60:51] businesses with lots of people. And so it sounds like it's actually a talent deficit. Like you need

[60:55] to hire somebody or bring someone who's a high-level operator who has scaled a sales driven org.

[61:01] What's revenue right now? Remin you for the phone sales organization? Sure. Well everyone is

[61:06] $10,000 a day. Is that Jim V? So gross sales volume? And then you're getting $25% on that.

[61:13] Yeah. So you'd be looking at somebody who's scaled a sales org from $10,000 to $100,000. And who's

[61:19] really off-tubby. So you want somebody who looks like who's very, very leadership driven, not a

[61:25] systems person. That's not the right person. You're looking for somebody who's who you admire.

[61:29] Take this way. I mean you need an adult. That's that affection of age. Just saying you need someone

[61:33] who has experienced doing this. Because if I were looking at like if I were going to go buy in

[61:38] right to phone sales, the first thing I would do is hire an operator. Because right now all the

[61:42] things that you've described have been people issues. So if I'm operating on the fear of constraint

[61:46] which is what we do, I'd say okay well then people issue seem to be the main problem for this business.

[61:50] So I'm going to hire somebody who has experience in this particular domain in a sales org who has

[61:55] gone from x to z. A million dollar question, where do you find such people? Well you guys are sales

[62:00] guys, right? So it's outbound. Appounds the easiest thing to do. You could also run ads but the

[62:05] best people already have jobs. I mean you guys know this from your business, right? And so it would

[62:11] be outreach. outreach is the easiest thing to do. Go to LinkedIn and LinkedIn has so many tools

[62:18] now like search for people who meet these, you know, these three or four job titles.

[62:23] Probably like a senior vice president or a VP of sales, sales director might be a little too low.

[62:29] But probably a VP of sales or VP of sales ops, something like that. Like you'll have to

[62:34] play with the title. It is kind of like an ad in advertising. Like you have to play to figure out

[62:38] when you get the right avatars on the phone. But as soon as you get to click then you're like okay

[62:43] these are the types of people I want. And then you talk to as many as you can. And the limit

[62:46] test that I have for high level talent is that I should be learning from them on the phone call.

[62:50] So if I feel like I have to teach them stuff, they're not the right person. Like if they're teaching

[62:54] me things which is also great because then you can keep taking notes and after 20 or 30 phone calls

[62:58] you're like okay, I have a very good idea of what excellent looks like and I can make a more

[63:03] educated decision on the type of person that I want. But that person who's very operational should

[63:09] be a people driven leader, especially in this type of work. For the second part of this call,

[63:14] we would like to just bring one of our partners too and just ask them to say a little question in

[63:18] general and learn from you. You know with our models, do you believe that we should utilize

[63:23] group selling methods like webinars, seminars, events that way we can compress the time from

[63:28] we make money or just focus on one to one sales. I think it depends on the product is being said.

[63:34] Usually products above 30,000 dollars and that's why we're focusing on like one to one model right

[63:40] one. I think you can do so the way that I like building sales or just having repeated sales materials

[63:44] and then individualize. So like repeated sales materials are going to be like the VSL, the webinar

[63:48] things like that. But you're not closing on those webinars. You're just qualifying and setting.

[63:52] And so I want sales guys to be doing as little information spewing as humanly possible

[63:57] and really being able to start the call with so you're ready to buy. And then yes or no and then

[64:02] work your way so you have 60 minutes to close rather than okay great. Now like discovery, like let me

[64:07] talk to you about how we might be able to help you because if you because then sales guys get really

[64:11] tired of saying the exact same pitch then they sound like robots and they get zoned out because they're

[64:15] saying something and they're not listening. And so the talk ratio is get way off and so I prefer

[64:20] having as much of the standardized information sharing being done before the call so that the

[64:27] closers time can be maximized to closing rather than just like teaching. But I wouldn't be trying to

[64:31] pitch 30 k stuff directly to a payment page. I'd probably be pitching that to you know qualifier

[64:36] circles. Yeah that's how we were we were doing it right now but we've seen some other people

[64:41] they have like live webinars you know and they have the sales guys in the life

[64:44] you know it's an even though they're selling super high ticket offers they try to like do that

[64:49] communication session for the call like just through the chat and then once they show level of

[64:56] inches then they get them on the call. Well they're using the webinar as the set correct. At the

[65:00] day there's a certain amount of information that someone needs to have or some amount of like exposure

[65:04] that they have to have to a brand or a product for them to you know make a buying decision. And so

[65:08] that can be a long set and then a short close it can be a set webinar close it can be a long webinar

[65:14] then it close like there's just a certain amount of selling you know the runway for the plane

[65:18] has to be a certain length doesn't really matter where you slice it it just has like this is

[65:21] amount that the majority of people need to have before making a purchasing decision. Now some people

[65:26] might need less and that's okay because they probably got it beforehand from other things that they've

[65:29] consumed. So if you want to say okay how do I sell why want to increase the likelihood that

[65:33] some that the the highest percentage of people buy then I want to create an experience that

[65:38] the highest percentage people get all of the information that they need prior to the closing

[65:42] conversation. And so if you do a webinar as a big set thing I mean to me that's the same I mean

[65:47] that's all the same like if you run ads to webinar ads to VSL then they go to a scheduler

[65:51] or you know if you have a live call team where you have a number that becomes the CTA

[65:54] then the call team's answering calls in real time. Operationally I wouldn't I wouldn't upend my entire

[65:59] business because of just a slightly different way of doing it because I think it's more happy to

[66:02] glad as long as you're throughput is good and you're you know like you're making money and you're

[66:06] growing right now I would I don't know if that would be the constraint of the business. So like I

[66:10] think this stuff that we're talking about earlier like that seems more of the constraint then

[66:13] kind of the the individual tactics you know in an example you give. What's your method for

[66:18] building trust and credibility on a sales call in that the fastest way possible like what method

[66:24] will approach do you often take for that? Well I mean brand matters more than anything but I

[66:30] right off the bat and the you know the vast majority of like the the hard closing tactics and

[66:36] hard sales tactics have to exist in lieu of not having a brand. Right it's like we have to make

[66:41] up all this hard stuff it's kind of like in the matrix and he's like when you're good enough

[66:46] you won't have to dodge bullets or like you're saying I can dodge bullets it's like well

[66:49] when you're ready you won't have to so like the brand is when you're ready you won't have to but

[66:54] if you don't have that which is the big thing that you should have but if you don't have that then it's

[66:58] the same things that you would normally do you're going to try and find common ground be relatable

[67:03] like a lot of it just comes down to how well do you understand the avatar right so I think a lot

[67:06] of sales teams under under prepare by under understanding the avatar the prospect and over educated on

[67:13] the product like if I understand what a 45 year old woman's suffering from I can basically do the

[67:18] same sales call and at the end of the call say I can pitch therapy I could pitch I could pitch weight loss

[67:23] I could pitch a gym membership I could pitch you know I could be cleaning services it doesn't

[67:27] really matter because if I understand the avatar really well I'll be able to speak to her pains and

[67:31] what you said is true like brand is extremely powerful and with the clients that we take on

[67:35] for agency you recommend that we go for people very strong brands and take that approach I

[67:40] that's that's the way to be the focus but I like always go for the brand and from there

[67:43] yeah strong brand strong product for sure fair question though yeah related ability common ground

[67:47] what's been the number one reason you see the show operates increase or decrease

[67:52] it's it's a hundred golden babies no silver bullets so when we when we go to a company we have

[67:57] a so we call it lead nurture checklist and so it's just like 17 things that we do and each one of

[68:01] them adds like 2 to 5% and so that's how we can get something from like 30 to 40% sure it's

[68:06] 85% sure it's it's just doing a lot of little things so I would not look for like the one trick

[68:12] it's just like okay how quickly are responding how how much information we provide them beforehand

[68:16] are we providing a personalized video like can we give them a gift card for showing up that they

[68:20] can share a coffee with us like just how many different things can we add in to increase the

[68:24] likely that they show can we can we create an open loop between the set and the clothes that they're

[68:28] going to get information that they are they had got their interest they're interest peaked

[68:32] is there a way that we can say that we're going to show them that we're going to do a

[68:34] certain amount of work on the behalf and we're going to give them the deliverable on the next call

[68:37] right so they have a huge incentive they have huge curiosity so that they would want to show

[68:41] up like this is particularly true in insurance products so like we have an insurance company

[68:45] and so like we create personalized insurance plans it's like okay well how do we get more

[68:48] people to shop but we don't want to send them the insurance plan that we're going to make them

[68:51] before the call we just say we'll explain it to you on the call yeah we implement a lot of those

[68:55] tactics is well probably there's some stuff that you're doing now we currently don't have

[68:58] at the moment as well I don't know if it makes sense to share on this call but you said

[69:01] those kind of like 17 things is a fall city maybe like sent it to us no so oh no

[69:09] all right honestly it really depends on what the business is if we're looking at an insurance

[69:12] business versus a weight loss business like it's more applying a principle across but that being said

[69:17] the big one that's that's probably missing like it's usually the big obvious thing which is

[69:21] we can always do the hundreds of little tactics but you're trying to dodge bullets

[69:26] rather than like winning before you start which is like why why do so few people trust you like

[69:32] that's the big that's the big like I see the matrix and then everything else becomes irrelevant

[69:37] so for acquisition.com our show rate on calls is nearly a hundred percent so if we call some if we

[69:42] say hey we'd like to find out more about your business today is Tuesday our next opening is Thursday

[69:47] of next week so nine days from now show rates still a hundred percent because of brand we actually

[69:53] don't need to do any of those tactics now we have those tactics so that we can help the

[69:56] the companies that don't have those level of brands but like you want to stack the deck you

[70:01] want to answer the question why does no intrus me and solve that otherwise you're always going to

[70:04] do with these issues like do the fundamentals for sure but the big the big things that don't matter

[70:09] most is who you're choosing is your customers so vista you guys heard of vista private equity

[70:13] so they're the biggest they're the biggest software private equity they've got a gazillion dollars

[70:17] whatever the way that they look at a business is that they do a customer analysis and so they look

[70:22] for the 80 20 right they look for the 20 percent customers that are worth more than everyone else

[70:26] and they then do a customer analysis say what do these 20 percent have that the other 80 percent

[70:30] dough and then they exclusively look for customers that are that 20 percent and then they say

[70:35] no to everyone else and so within what happens is if the sales velocity remains unchanged they

[70:39] five X the business so sometimes you'll make more money just by saying no so you can have the

[70:43] capacities to say yes to the few guys that matter more and if you're not getting more of those people

[70:47] then solving that problem rather than saying like how do I keep getting how do I how do I

[70:51] polish a turd instead of going from that perspective just saying like maybe I just should

[70:55] not try to polish turds because it's still a turd right and like how do I get the people who are

[70:59] much better companies to be attracted to my business and if you have a customer list that people

[71:03] aspire to be like then you'll get more and more people like that's where that's like kind of the

[71:08] branding side for you guys which is how can I associate with better quality brands so that other

[71:14] better quality brands realize that what we do is legit you can try and optimize to shit out of

[71:19] something but like usually it's the big obvious stuff and we don't look at the big obvious stuff

[71:22] because they're actually harder problems to solve and they take longer but it's where the most

[71:26] values unlock. What's the ideal frequency and the topics of coaching calls that would increase the

[71:31] overall performance of setters and closers. So I would say it's less about the topics that the

[71:36] calls and more about what you're training repeatedly and what you're rewarding. So sales is one of

[71:40] those really interesting businesses or like you know departments that you can see very clearly like

[71:45] you guys have probably seen different sales teams and they have very different cultures and so it would

[71:48] be like what are the cultures that create the highest performance. In our experience you know you can

[71:52] go on either extreme you can have a very punishment driven culture which is very individualistic

[71:56] or you can have a very team driven culture which is typically reward based. What you want to

[72:00] reward is adherence to the script not closing like that's a huge shift for most sales teams. If you

[72:06] reward it here so the script then what happens is you get everyone to follow the script. Now if they

[72:09] aren't closing then you need to change the script but it's much easier to change the script once you've

[72:13] taught adherence than it is to have a bunch of loan wuffs who do anything they can to close the deal

[72:18] which then impacts your brand. So like a really simple you know tactic we did at one of our chains

[72:23] was we just said cool we'll give them five bucks if they follow the script whether they close the

[72:26] now mind you the the tickets are smaller right it's just a higher higher volume. We'll give them five

[72:30] bucks if they follow the script and if they close or they don't close they get paid either way.

[72:34] You know what's interesting? The thing they're most curious about when they send their managers is

[72:38] do I get the five bucks for adherence even though they make three times more on the close. So we still

[72:42] give them benefits for closing but they want to know whether they got the approval of the

[72:46] manager because the five dollars actually matters less than the approval from the manager saying you

[72:50] did a good job the five dollars is more of a token. And if you can imagine because you

[72:55] everybody here is sold before. If you got on a call and you knew that you could get paid no

[72:58] matter what just for following the process it takes some of the pressure off. Like think about like

[73:02] you hop in the car like I'm just gonna make sure that I get my bone no matter what on on the adherence

[73:05] but guess what happens when everybody hears the script you fucking close more. Because sales is one of

[73:11] the biggest issues where you have false positives where someone goes rogue and then closes and

[73:16] basically gets reinforced for doing the wrong thing. And then they start doing the thing that they

[73:21] did that one time that worked and then it doesn't work over and over again so they change the

[73:24] behavior they learn the wrong thing. And so then you have to course correct right that's why sales

[73:30] like it's all about adherence and then then we can be really strategic about really making sure

[73:35] the script is beautiful and crisp and concise and we just and we just drill the team wanted here.

[73:40] The big topic I want to address is how to sell imaging tape. You don't sell emerging tech.

[73:44] You it's selling the plane flavors the vacation. If I could tell you that your financials would be

[73:50] absolutely accurate and updated in real time would you want that. How much would you be willing to pay

[73:54] compared to what you currently pay a lot more? Great what if I said I could do it for less than what you're

[73:58] currently paying? Are you interested? Great this is what I need. The fact that I'm using AI is a

[74:02] relevant. You just sell the outcome and then you're not really doing anything. Yeah it's interesting.

[74:05] AI is great for YouTube clickbait but for for sales it's irrelevant.

[74:09] But you that was like one of the main tools we wanted to get it done. But all she want to do for the next

[74:12] 16. You must be getting a ton of businesses did you some relevant AI businesses that are

[74:17] coming across your tips just right now at acquisition.com what are the things that's making

[74:21] of sort of jumping out at you and what are the sort of commonalities between things that make you

[74:24] really go. Oh well that that seems to have some kind of staying down. The best one draw a AI business

[74:29] is that I look at it or an or an auction. And so they're either they're not real AI which is 99%

[74:35] of them. They're basically just built on Chatcha Beauty which is fine. There's nothing wrong with that

[74:38] but I'm just like let's not claim that we're creating AI. On the other hand it's people who

[74:42] have no business acumen and so they're like it's totally different like the normal laws of

[74:47] business ton apply it's like they have always applied and they will always apply because they're

[74:51] just how business works. Right. There's the vast majority people that I see in that. I do think that

[74:56] AI implementation for mainstream is an enormous opportunity. So AIifying if you will and I don't think

[75:04] I think your first conclusions right which is being the custom guy is tough. You know what I mean?

[75:09] It's just it's all things to all people which is nothing to know on. If I'm talking to the audience now

[75:13] if you guys want to get into this world what you want to do is look at an industry or an avatar

[75:18] that you understand well. And so one of the things that like why commentator and some of these

[75:23] great like you know legendary investors look at is how much time a founder has suffered and

[75:28] lives the real problem. I can talk about breeding because I've had two no surgeries. I've been falling

[75:32] asleep on my hands since I was in eighth grade so that I could breathe. So like I've lived with the

[75:36] problem for a long time and I've tried many different types of solutions. So I have tons of industry

[75:41] knowledge if I were to start a company like that. If you have a job right now or have had any type of

[75:45] job you've worked in a business. That's a great baseline of background knowledge that's difficult to just

[75:52] jump like even if you were a server at a restaurant for two years you still will probably know more

[75:56] about restaurants then 99% of people who aren't in the restaurant industry like I don't know anything

[76:00] about how restaurants work because I've just never really worked at one. You could probably be

[76:03] aware of because you now also have this understanding of what AI can do to think okay there's a

[76:08] hundred problems in a restaurant. Is there one very specific problem that I can solve well and is

[76:12] very similar between restaurants because as soon as you get the point eight a point be you can create the

[76:16] clear value prop and you can message around that. Getting extremely specific which is I think what you

[76:21] were saying that you give the advice to is super smart and it makes the problem set really narrow

[76:27] to solve so you can become an expert that's an inch wide and a mildly exact exact same thing.

[76:32] The reason that most people don't do that when they're starting out is because you don't have

[76:35] enough demand. You have so few leads that come to you that you're like like I mean shit I need to

[76:40] pay rent this month and I only got four leads this month and all four are completely different but

[76:45] I need the money and so I get it. Read a play that cash into getting really concentrated on your marketing

[76:50] which is what offers and leads is all about so that you can find that specific avatar that you can

[76:56] over and over again repeat which is also I referals are so strong because if you do a good job

[77:00] they will send you other people just like them. The question is is yes I can pick a niche to do this

[77:04] AI automation I can build AI solutions and sort of targeted one but what is the opportunity that I

[77:09] should talk with in the niche and that comes down to either as you said industry experience that you

[77:13] already have or sort of be what we've said is finding some sort of partner within the industry so

[77:18] we say you can either try to pay them for the time as a consultant or you can just message enough

[77:22] people and say hey look I'm looking to bring these kind of solutions to the industry what

[77:26] do you be willing and working on this with me I need a little bit of your specific knowledge

[77:29] but it's like change I'll create this thing and you can refer it you can basically have first

[77:33] dibs on sharing it to your network and you can make some money that way so yeah I definitely

[77:36] wouldn't do it as a consulting relationship. The the thing that you're going to be selling is the

[77:40] product and so having a consultant who's the one who's in charge of the primary value that you're

[77:46] driving is not a good idea and so you'd want somebody who's a long-term incentivized to continually

[77:51] improve the product continue to innovate the products see the things that are coming around the corner

[77:55] to keep it up to date make it better make it any stronger et cetera it really just comes down to

[77:59] how to have a normal business partnerships so all the normal rules of business apply and this

[78:03] person has some specific knowledge you don't have and you should ideally have specific knowledge they

[78:06] don't have they should be asking the question like why do I partner with the people in your community

[78:10] if I'm an AI developer right if you're trying to figure out which of the problems to solve in an

[78:14] industry it's just value created times ease of implementation that's the equation which if you

[78:19] chuck it up it's number of potential customers times growth profit per customer if I have six different

[78:24] problems I could potentially solve which one has way more people who have it which one's easier to do

[78:28] which one unlocks the most value one thing that we're starting to see as as us ourselves actually

[78:32] trying to build one of these these AI automation agencies now I had development companies well is that

[78:36] by building a development team that is capable what is is your take and your experience with how important

[78:42] that development resources I mean it's sure the event you must know working with developers can be a

[78:46] complete plane but having them in house and having a really good team to rely on as you shoot for

[78:50] those big opportunities can be key what my most experience being like this and how important do you

[78:55] think that development resources when you're going for those big a place very okay I mean we would

[79:02] think in the same thing since it's the product like if you're in a service business the quality of the

[79:07] people that you use to provide the service is the product and so those people usually want to be

[79:13] compensated well because if they are really good then the places that they're coming from will

[79:18] want to pay more to keep them and so you have to give them a great place to work and a financial

[79:24] incentive or some upside that they get exposed to that they wouldn't otherwise like you want them

[79:28] to feel like owners and the best way to do that is for them to actually be owners if you're trying

[79:32] to get on the cutting edge of technology then actually having the people who are good at that

[79:37] is the business all of this is a great reason to have a really killing option to take on

[79:41] you out but the development side of things I tend to find at least an out experience is being a

[79:45] hot of thing for us to create our business. I don't know it. It's easier for you to do the marketing

[79:50] stuff because you're good at it so you know if someone's full of shit on the interview you just don't

[79:53] know if anyone's full of shit on the interview because you have no context. The most important

[79:56] hire which is why I say this is you need a technical co-founder he needs somebody who has a real

[80:00] stake in making sure that the people who are coming in are actually good not that you're checking

[80:04] a box and saying hey I have 14 people on my development team anybody in the in the true high tech

[80:08] world knows that one amazing developer is more available than 100 beat developers. This is the

[80:13] hardest part of business is hiring people who are really good at something without knowing the

[80:18] in-depth knowledge and that's where like leveraging somebody who might not want to work for you

[80:22] that you do think is brilliant to at least interview or double check on how good they are

[80:28] is really valuable that's where like building a network becomes important and getting even some

[80:32] tests like of aptitude for them to take so that you can at least get some sort of baseline

[80:38] but it's all going to be about how skilled that person is because ideally if they were as good as you

[80:42] are at marketing then you guys would probably have a really successful business. We've been

[80:46] fortunate enough to find that find that magical sort of technical co-founder so we're starting

[80:51] to get them really well compensated both getting an equity as well so we are off to the race and

[80:55] that's completely changed up as I can't even stress for anyone over you in here that that key

[81:00] hire is just a complete game. I'm sure you've had it Alex and your business as we've just found

[81:03] that right person and just completely changes things. All right appreciate you guys. Thank you and

[81:07] appreciate the community. Thank you guys for showing out hopefully the book serves you guys well.

[81:10] Do you feel like in general do you think that the you think you brought as much value as you promised?

[81:16] I hope so. I try to answer the questions to the best of my body and provide knowledge.

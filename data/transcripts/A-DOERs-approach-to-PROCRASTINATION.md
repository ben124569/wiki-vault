[00:00] Mosheenation, a lot of people ask how do you guys get so much stuff done, how does

[00:04] how do the companies move forward with such speed?

[00:07] And for this you don't know, my name is Alex.

[00:08] Mosheenway on acquisition.com, our portfolio does about $85 million a year.

[00:12] I give you all this stuff because I just want you to not be broke and a lot of people are.

[00:16] And so I don't want you to be wrong about that.

[00:18] And so this video is a video that was, I released in a group of very long time ago and

[00:21] it's one of the top ranked videos in that group of 300 plus videos.

[00:24] And it was how we tactically execute on speed.

[00:27] So speed is king is one of the core tenants of our companies, actually turning that concept

[00:31] of speed into something that everyone can execute on is one of the key things that moves

[00:34] you forward towards your goals faster.

[00:36] All right.

[00:37] And it's not what a lot of people think.

[00:38] It's not about being impatient.

[00:39] It's not a lot.

[00:40] Not about trying to get 100 things done.

[00:41] But it's about knowing how to get the things done that matter.

[00:44] A and then B, how do we get these short tasks done in a way that actually moves teams

[00:48] forward rather than individuals?

[00:49] All right.

[00:50] So I think you'll enjoy the video.

[00:51] It was ranked one of the top ones and I'll see you on the other side.

[00:54] Mosheenation.

[00:55] Love you.

[00:56] Good morning.

[00:57] It's one of you guys.

[00:57] I've been a fantastic Friday.

[01:00] Today, I wanted to talk about something that has been, has been on my doctor for a while.

[01:05] But today, I felt like the right day.

[01:06] So calling this fuck end of week.

[01:09] What I mean by that is one of the things that I've seen across the board when we're talking

[01:13] to entrepreneurs and the gym owner community that we have is that the one trade I see over

[01:19] and over again that is clear to the people who are winners, right?

[01:24] The top one percent.

[01:25] I'm not talking top 10%, the top one percent is the speed with which they execute after

[01:32] making a decision.

[01:33] One of the definitions that like we talked about with community is that the difference

[01:36] to power as I understand it is the gap between thoughts becoming reality.

[01:41] And so if you thought about an omnipotent being, right?

[01:44] So if someone has unlimited power as they think that thing would be, right?

[01:49] And so if you were to believe in a creator of some sort, then you might think as that creator

[01:54] thought the universe became, right?

[01:57] And so if you think that is like the ultimate scale of power, then the closure we can get

[02:01] to that, the more powerful we become, the more potent we are as entrepreneurs.

[02:06] And so I see this so many times that it's not even, it's not even, oh, like this is

[02:12] associated with success, like this is what creates success.

[02:16] Because the gap between where you decide something is a good idea and when it actually occurs

[02:23] is the loop with which you can improve your business.

[02:26] And so it's a lot like, I can't remember what the saying was, but it's not like how old the

[02:31] cars but how many miles are on it.

[02:32] But what I mean by that is like, we're young, right?

[02:35] But there's been a lot of iterations that have happened from, you know, when the business

[02:40] first started when I started my first gym until now.

[02:42] And I think the key to that is the speed of the Udalu.

[02:45] And that's the second military term like Observe, Orient, Decide Act.

[02:49] And it's just the loop with which that you can basically see what's going on,

[02:53] make a decision act on it and then do that whole loop again, right?

[02:56] Because the faster you can pivot and iterate the more responsive Udalu's an entrepreneur,

[03:01] the faster you can take advantage of opportunities, the faster you can find out what failures are

[03:05] and then move on.

[03:05] I want to talk about this within the context of running a team and employees and then also within

[03:10] yourself. And so for running your team, right, one of the things that, you know, once you're

[03:16] moving out of you doing things all the time, there's how do I get other people to do things?

[03:20] And so that's why I called this like, fucking weak, right?

[03:22] Is that I, one of the things, one of my biggest pet peeves is like, yeah, I can get to that

[03:26] by end of week. I'm like, why don't you just get it to me in an hour because that's how long it takes.

[03:30] And then all of a sudden it's like, oh, it's like, well, I have a meeting right then.

[03:34] It's like, is it more important than this? No, okay. Well, then do it.

[03:37] Like, if you think about how you can run an organization like that, if you can get things

[03:41] done end of day, right, rather than end of week, you were literally speeding up the organization's

[03:46] seven acts. Think about that. And so when you're thinking about deadlines, if you're thinking about

[03:51] expectations, you as the owner can set the X, you set the cadence. If people say, hey, can we do this?

[03:57] And then you're like, cool, let's start right now. You set the tone for how the organization's going

[04:02] to move, how quickly it's going to orient, how quickly thoughts become reality, and ultimately

[04:07] how powerful the organization will become because of the speed, right? And speed isn't doing things

[04:12] fast. It's basically just not being distracted by other shit that doesn't matter. It's being

[04:16] able to prioritize. And most people, a lot of the times aren't doing something that's high priority,

[04:21] right? A lot of times they're just doing nothing. If you can speed up that loop and force and

[04:27] and put apply pressure to your team to not do things by end of week or even end of day,

[04:33] it's like, it's 10 a.m. Can you get this done by noon? Okay. And then you can have that loop happen

[04:39] three times within a day rather than it taking three weeks, right? Because you've set that cadence

[04:44] from the beginning and then things get done faster. So I've been reading some really interesting

[04:48] books lately, and I refer them out to a handful of my friends that I have that are all doing

[04:54] five to 15 billion, kind of in that range. And what was amazing to me is that every single one of them

[05:02] read the book immediately, send me back their notes and what they were going to do with it. And

[05:06] like, and basically, we're actually feedback on the angle that they were going to take with it. What's

[05:10] fascinating to me is that if you look at, if you look at lower-level entrepreneurs, they

[05:15] end up not seeing an inedited way. I'm just saying in terms of just subjective revenue,

[05:18] like just having to cheat as much. The delay between being able to gain information and act

[05:23] is so much longer, and that's why they how, where they want to be. It's kind of the same to

[05:27] greet people who are like, pay for our program and haven't gone through the boy yet. I'm like,

[05:30] what do you do? What priority? What education you have is not relevant to your business.

[05:36] Like you're reading a motivational blog right now when you have to translate that motivation into

[05:42] a thought that you're then going to quote test, and then you have to see how that test works,

[05:46] and then maybe it improves something rather than just following the playbook that has already

[05:50] been tested and has already, like the tree has been shook. And so if you look at like Joey for example,

[05:57] who by all definitions his gym is the number one gym within gym all right. He had already finished

[06:03] everything in legacy by week eight his first eight weeks. He'd already implemented every single

[06:08] system in legacy. And so it's not like he has more hours in the day, right? It's not like his

[06:14] business is different. It's just that his level of efficacy in execution is so high because he

[06:19] did allow himself to get distracted by things. And the moment he has something he needs to execute,

[06:24] it's creates this itch inside of him that he cannot, he can't move forward without executing this

[06:30] so that the relief comes. And if you can start to foster that type of behavior in yourself in

[06:36] those attitudes about execution, you will grow faster and you will become more powerful as an entrepreneur.

[06:42] Right? If you think about your competition, who would you fear? Right? The competitor who sees

[06:47] what you're doing can immediately execute implement and improve on it at a faster look than you can

[06:53] even understand what's going on. Right? And that's where speed of first and market and things like that

[06:58] don't matter as much because if an extra of a competitor can execute an out-oodle loop, right?

[07:03] Can can speed that loop up faster? They can iterate and prove on it fast and you can and then you

[07:07] have no chance to catch up. And so if you're looking at your business, look at it from a context of

[07:12] speed of how long does it take us to improve things, how long from understanding that our

[07:16] churn is high, to executing the five horsemen, how long did that take? We knew what the problem

[07:21] was, how long did it take for us to do? And if you can, if you can, if you can get real with yourself

[07:25] about how many actual hours it will take to do something and then you look at your week and you think,

[07:30] okay, what am I doing today that is more important than this and where can I put these two hours?

[07:36] And start with the moment that you make the decision and then all of a sudden you'll be getting things done

[07:40] that day, that afternoon rather than end of week, end of month. We purposely delayed these things

[07:46] because we just procrastinate for no reason when the problem will not go away. And so

[07:52] that is why within Jim Lach Speed is king is one of the core tenants of the business because

[07:57] you have to, and the tone has to start with you is the entrepreneur, like you have to apply that

[08:02] pressure, you have to say fuck end of week. Like what are you doing today that's more important

[08:07] than this? What are you doing in the next two hours that's more important to this? Tell me,

[08:10] right? And a lot of times I'll be the answer like, well, I guess I can do it now. It's like,

[08:13] yeah, then let's do it now. Let's get it done. Right? And that small change can 7x,

[08:20] right? If you even go in from end of week to end of day, can 7x how quickly your business grows

[08:26] because the solutions that you need to implement to solve the problems and breakthrough the bottlenecks

[08:30] happen today, not in a week, not in a month. And then the reaction to the next thing that breaks,

[08:36] the next bottleneck in the business happens not in a week, not in a month, but in a day. And then that's

[08:41] how quickly you can pivot from where you are to where you want to go because it's not one big thing.

[08:46] It's a million small turns that will get you there. Anyways, I hope, I hope anyone, you know,

[08:50] somebody found the value in this. If you have an employer or you're managing your team and you want

[08:55] to implement new things, start with today, right? Start with end of day, not end of week, start with

[09:01] end of the next two hours and then work backwards from there and then apply pressure and push back

[09:07] on excuses for why something else, why something can't be done. Ask for why, why do you think this

[09:14] thing that you're going to do is more important than this? And I want a real answer, right? And if they

[09:19] can't give you a real answer, then it means that I need to help you prioritize. And that's fine.

[09:24] But this is now going to be your priority because this is what drives revenue. This is what drives

[09:27] retention. This is what's going to drive the business. Look at your schedule, identify the bottlenecks you

[09:33] and then start doing them now, not in tomorrow, not in a week, not in a month because there's no point.

[09:39] It's just the speed with which you can close the gap between your thoughts and your decisions and

[09:44] the reality that you create in front of you will dictate how powerful you are as an entrepreneur

[09:48] and even as a human being. So anyway, 10 amazing day. Have a fantastic Friday for my gymlers. I will

[09:52] see you guys on the call later today. Otherwise, keep being awesome. Tag like comment all that jazz.

[09:58] Lots of love. All right.

[00:00] In this video, I'm going to be talking to you about how to fix the character traits and deficiencies that you have in your life.

[00:07] So with the struggling with anxiety or happiness and depression or being a bad husband or being money focused or whatever the thing is that you claim to have a problem with.

[00:21] I'm going to give you really the only mental framework that has ever worked for me.

[00:25] If you're new to the channel, my name's Alchromozy. I'm an acquisition.com to probably have come to this about $85 million a year.

[00:31] I make these videos because, can't really enjoy sharing some of the things that have helped us,

[00:35] kind of get through things as we've grown our companies and there are a lot of people who are broken. I don't want to be one of them.

[00:40] And so I'm going to probably piss a lot of people off in this video so I'm going to give you heads up.

[00:43] Second thing is I will be cussing in this video so if you have kids around,

[00:46] I would say, you know, muted or listen to it another time. So I was talking to you in a much more than the other day and they were saying that they were having panic attacks.

[00:53] Right. And they were struggling with this issue. What I want to do is walk you through the process that I was explaining to them.

[01:00] Now at this point, the reason the panic attacks started for this entrepreneur ironically is that they were talking to a therapist.

[01:09] And the therapist was like, let's look at your past and dug up, you know, crap about their past.

[01:14] And then they started looking at this thing and then they started getting anxiety kind of remembering all these kind of past experiences and whatnot.

[01:21] Here's the thing, most therapists and I say this with zero degree, most therapists are humans and most humans suck at most things, especially things they think they're good at.

[01:31] And so most of them are just normal people who did okay in school and now just like talking to people and don't have any fucking clue what they're doing.

[01:38] All right. So here's the idea. Here's the hot take. What most of them will do is they will try and pull something up and say something to the extent of what do you make that mean?

[01:48] What does that mean to you? The thought process behind this is, hey, you have this thing. It's triggering a feeling because you think that having anxiety makes you a bad person or makes you a bad entrepreneur or whatever thing that you say it has meaning.

[02:02] Right. What do we make this mean? All right. That's the question. What are you making this mean? All right. So if you have problems and this is especially important with cyclical behavior, reinforcing behavior.

[02:12] This is also one of the reasons that I actually do not stand for the whole A.A. concept of standing up and front of people every morning and say, hi, everybody, I am an addict. I fucking hated.

[02:22] It's literally like owning this deficiency and incorporating it and weaving it to your construct and your identity and you reinforce it every fucking morning. It's insanity to me.

[02:32] The way to stopping addicted to something is to stop thinking about it.

[02:36] Like, what does it look like to not be addicted? It looks like you just continuing to live your life not even thinking about it.

[02:42] What does it look like to not have anxiety? It's not you doing your anti-exider routine in the morning and say, I suffer from anxiety or I struggle with anxiety.

[02:50] It's not saying that and saying, I have to do these things. I must assure that I need to in order to not have anxiety because then you're thinking about anxiety.

[02:58] You're giving anxiety power. And so what I'm going to walk you through is the way to hold the space and own the power that you have in your own mind outside of the thing that you were projecting the power on to.

[03:11] The process that these therapists that are fucking retards will do is they will lead you through this thing where they try to transform meaning.

[03:18] They say instead of saying, it means you're a bad person, what if we just said, this is, you know, it's a good thing or it's not a bad thing.

[03:27] Right? So we try to transform meaning. And I think that's like level one elementary grade school of cognitive behavioral therapy, right? I think that's great school.

[03:36] The thing is, and this is the problem because I've gone through the cycle, which is why I'm speaking about this so passionately.

[03:41] And I'll tell you a quick story before I dive in. So there was a period of time in my life where I was very unhappy.

[03:47] All right. And so I have assessed about happiness, right? I read all the positive psychology journals. I read the books. I read the happiness equate.

[03:54] You know, I mean, like I went through all of these things and yet after spending all of this time trying to assess about happiness, I was no less.

[04:02] No more happy. And so then I thought to myself, well, in one instance, I can spend lots of time in effort and be unhappy or I can spend zero time in effort and be unhappy.

[04:10] Well, this one cost me less. I might as well start pursuing this. And this is what happened.

[04:16] I adopted this mentality and I was shared with you called fuck happiness, all right? Bear with me. And so what ended up happening

[04:23] is that I thought these thoughts and whatever the idea of is this making me happy and all of these normal

[04:29] trigger thoughts and be like, I'm not happy. This isn't good. I feel sad. I'm about what I would literally have this

[04:34] trunk card that I would just pop in my head and be like fuck happiness and I keep moving. The difference

[04:39] between fuck happiness and let's think about how we should be grateful for things is that when you say fuck happiness or

[04:48] fuck the thing that you are struggling with, fucking anxiety, fuck whatever is that it no longer has power because we're not trying to transform

[04:57] the meaning of the behavior we're eliminating the meaning behind it altogether. We're transforming it

[05:05] into nothing. And so, carry me out for a second. And I don't know why this is getting all space-seeing weird.

[05:10] I've tried to fix this thing a hundred times. The reason this is so important, all right? Is that when you enter these vicious

[05:15] reinforcing cycles? So let's say it's like, oh god, I'm afraid I'm gonna have a panic attack tonight. I don't want to have a panic attack.

[05:21] You start thinking about how do you panic attack and then of course you have a panic attack. Because the fear of the thing is what

[05:27] reinforces the cycle and you can do this with anything, right? It could be it could be a guy with the right

[05:32] tall dysfunction like I hope it doesn't happen, I hope it doesn't happen and then it happens, right?

[05:36] Because you're worried about it happening, not because the happening itself is the thing, right? And I'm trying to use

[05:41] examples that purposefully people derive shame from. Because the thing is is that the shame of the

[05:47] occurrence is the thing that gives it power. And so if you remove the shame and by the way, the way the

[05:52] way to remove shame is to shed light on it. So nothing can give you shame if you admit it openly.

[05:58] Think about it. If everyone knows the thing and you accept the thing or deemed the thing

[06:06] meaningless, then it no longer has power for over you. So let me let me give you an example.

[06:12] So this is such a wonder that I was talking about earlier. They were telling me that they are having

[06:16] you know they're having anxiety tax and they were just preventing the folks sleeping etc. Right?

[06:19] And I was like, so they're like, well, you know, I'm really working on it. And I was like, why?

[06:24] And they were like, look, didn't you cross-eyed? And I was like, how long you've been working this?

[06:27] You know, like, you know, eight months. And I was like, are you less anxious than you were before?

[06:32] They're like, well, I think a little bit. And I was like, you think you would be a little bit less anxious if you just

[06:36] eject shit and waited eight months from when you weren't for when you were bad until now.

[06:39] They were like, well, maybe. I was like, time does you a lot of wounds. I was like, so you said,

[06:43] spent all this time to get this little outcome. And you could have just let time happen and probably had

[06:48] to say Malcolm, right? Right? Right? I was like, well, let's take it one step further.

[06:54] Why didn't you tell me how many bowel movements you had yesterday?

[06:57] I mean, I didn't think it was relevant. Exactly. So why are you showing me the

[07:00] method of pedic attacks? Because you think it's meaningful. You drive meaning. Your brain is telling

[07:05] you that this is something that is a problem. So the thing is is that the demon of the thing

[07:11] a problem is the problem. And trying to change it or transform the meaning into something else

[07:18] is in my opinion, just as bad, because the way that you created the mess that you are in in a

[07:26] vicious cycle of reinforcement is that you found a thing and then you said, I will give this meaning.

[07:31] And then you spent the rest of your time trying to transform the meaning. When if you want to

[07:35] solve the problem, the experience of having the problem solved is to not think about the problem at all.

[07:41] What it is is actually reversing the process that created meaning to begin with, which is

[07:45] removing meaning altogether. I'm saying this because I've had so many things that I've struggled

[07:50] within my life that I would consistently obsess about over and over and

[07:54] oh, I don't want to have that happening. Oh, I don't want to have that happening again. And then it

[07:57] would happen. And so in my opinion, the only way to overcome these issues is to you can slap the

[08:06] fuck happiness concept on it, but it's to destroy the meaning of the thing itself and let it shrink

[08:12] into a relevance. Most of my opinion, most of the psychological problems that we deal with,

[08:19] are better dealt with, not by trying to directly combat them, but by not giving them the power of

[08:26] our attention. And there's a big difference here. I'm not saying the thought of anxiety comes up. You say,

[08:30] I don't want to think about it because then it's fear. Fear gives it power. Shame gives it power.

[08:36] It's not that. It's looking at it and saying, why are you bringing this up? This is a relevant.

[08:41] This is a non-issue. And so for the same reason that you can have noise in the background and you don't

[08:46] think about it is that it's just noise. And so what we do is we shrink the thing for being a

[08:52] signal that our brain deems meaningful to noise that is in the background that we no longer

[08:58] ascribe meaning to altogether. And that is how it eventually shrinks into a relevance. And then we

[09:04] only choose to allocate our attention towards the thing that we find meaningful. And so what happened in

[09:09] my little fuck happiness story is that I said this is no longer a productive conversation. I'd be like,

[09:15] I'm unhappy, like fuck happiness, whatever. I'm going to keep moving. And a funny thing happened.

[09:20] A few years later I looked up and I realized that I was significantly more happy than I was before,

[09:25] or as I prefer to say, I was significantly less unhappy, which also gives less power to the

[09:31] thing altogether. A different point that I want to bring up because I think it's equally important

[09:35] around this topic. A lot of the fear and the shame comes from perceived judgment that we have from an

[09:40] anonymous outside society. Right? We had a voice or a series of voices that we believe exist

[09:47] that only exist in our mind that are judging us based on this behavior that we are suffering from.

[09:53] One of the reasons that I like to own the deficiencies publicly is not because of you guys. It's

[10:00] for me. I own, like for example, when we were running and growing our first big business, which

[10:08] was the licensing business, I was always up front. I said, I'm here to make money. And the reason

[10:12] I said that was so that I would have no shame in making money. Because then if people in the future

[10:19] were going to say something like Alex is only going to make money, I would then look at them and say,

[10:23] you know, so here, hear me out, listen to this dialogue. Let's say I was attacked because the attacks

[10:30] that I'm saying I'm going to portray as those outside, but it's inside of our minds that we attack

[10:34] ourselves. Right? So let's say, somebody comes up to me, a woman, and says, you're a terrible husband.

[10:41] Most people say that there are two forms of defense against this. Number one is saying, no,

[10:45] no, no, no, I'm not a bad, bad, bad husband. Right? And then giving all the reasons why I'm

[10:49] a good husband. The other way to defending is that, would be to say, well, you know, being a husband

[10:53] is not necessarily such a bad thing. Right? And so one is to dispute the other is to alter. Right?

[10:59] We're altering the meaning behind the thing. The first is we're combating and we're saying that

[11:03] we're not the thing, but still allowing the thing to have meaning, allowing a bad husband to be a

[11:09] negative connotation that we describe meaning too. I think this is meaningful and I, it's negative,

[11:14] but meaningful. And so I will say, I'm not that thing, or version two is this thing is meaningful,

[11:20] but I, I understand it in interpretively, right? Those are the two ways. The second way is how

[11:25] most therapy works. And I also think that it's bullshit. And so here's door number three.

[11:31] Is that you look at the thing in the face and you say, and I think you're a bad husband. And

[11:36] you're a, and and watch them shrivel. They will be paralyzed because everything that they have exists to have a

[11:49] counterforce. But if there is no counterforce for it to react to the thought process stops. And so if you struggle with

[11:56] these vicious, recurring, consistent, dialogues and arguments in your head about what's good and why

[12:04] you change and why you need to be different. Why this shouldn't be this way? Just look at it in the eyes

[12:10] and set end. And I'm going to give you a really controversial example of what I think should have

[12:15] happened in a public scenario. Tiger Woods, he was out in, you know what I mean, or outstead or whatever

[12:21] it is, you know what I mean? He was publicly shamed for the cheating thing, right? And mind,

[12:26] this is not making done cheating. This is mean to illustrate a position of power. And this is a public

[12:32] demonstration of power. But you can take it in terms of how you can internally project that power

[12:39] onto the idea that you want to vaguish. All right? And we don't vaguish it by transforming it,

[12:44] we vaguish it by eliminating the meaning altogether and letting it shrink into a relevance. So what

[12:49] tiger, in my opinion, should have done in that situation when they said, you banged all these burrows

[12:53] and you were lying, you blah, blah, blah, blah. He should have said, yes, I'm a white, and a cheater.

[12:59] But I'm the best fucking golfer there is. Next question, what do they say? When you accept it,

[13:07] there is no conversation. And so, try this in the next argument and you have with someone,

[13:12] A, but more importantly with yourself is that someone says, I think you're x, y, and z, and you're

[13:17] said you're right. Just give the power, just just say, sure, you're right. Now what? And so,

[13:24] your point, when your brain tells you something that you don't like or that you don't want to look at,

[13:32] instead of trying to make it into something else, liking it to an irrelevant observation.

[13:40] Brain, why didn't you bring up that I've grown here? Because it doesn't matter.

[13:44] Brain, why didn't you bring up honey, boundless, I guess you're right. This is a man.

[13:48] Brain, why didn't you say, tell me how many stairs I want to guess you're right? Because it doesn't

[13:54] matter. You don't find it meaningful. And so why am I now doing this thing to be meaningful?

[14:00] It's irrelevant to me. It, it, it helps the conversation and it stops the cycle.

[14:08] I say this and I know that I got passionate about this, but I say this is someone who's

[14:12] struggled with this for a very long time. And so, the only psychotherapy that I was able to do was

[14:18] on myself and it was not through talking out all of these things and I know that a lot of people

[14:23] are going to be intrigued. A lot of people are going to say, hey, I'm there visiting, change my life.

[14:26] Good for you. That's awesome. Keep doing it. I don't care. What I'm doing is I'm trying to talk to

[14:31] the people who have not had that or have done that and it did not work for them. And so I'm sharing

[14:36] the single most powerful mental model that has worked for me, which is purposefully staring at the

[14:43] problem and saying, so what your move and watch a show and then moving on the fuck with your life.

[14:55] So anyways, I love you all. Most ination. Appreciate you. Thank you for giving me the attention that you did

[15:00] today. I make these videos because I hope that some of the lessons that have served me

[15:07] conception of other people at least. And if you're in a darker place or you're struggling with

[15:10] something like anxiety or struggling with shame around some sort of activity that you have done,

[15:15] I can tell you the only way to struggle to deal with shame is to shed light on it.

[15:20] Shade shame only exists in darkness. And the only way something has power is when we fight it

[15:28] because we're deemed it meaningful or worth combating. And so I think the only way to truly fight it

[15:35] is to not fight it at all and say it is not fight worth having. And then it will evaporate.

[15:41] And so anyways, my friends, keeping awesome, lots of love. I'll see you guys in the next video. Bye!

## Full Transcript
[00:00] So I was sitting in my quarterly leadership meeting where everyone had flown into Vegas for

[00:05] two days to talk about the next quarter in our goals for the company.

[00:08] And I stood there and I was listening to what they were saying and I wanted to light my head on fire.

[00:13] What transpired next was a problem solving process that I want to share with you because

[00:18] it's unlocked $10 million to $12 million in annual revenue for us that we had not been able

[00:24] to unlock for two quarters because of one simple misdiagnosed problem.

[00:30] And so the purpose of this video is to hopefully get you to one avoid making that mistake,

[00:34] but to be able to use this framework so that you can solve the right problems in your business.

[00:38] So if you guys don't know my name is Alchimozi, I would like to ask you not to come.

[00:42] It's a portfolio company that is going to be about $85 million a year.

[00:44] And the reason I make these videos is because a lot of people are broken.

[00:46] I don't want to be one of them.

[00:48] So inside of our quarterly meeting for two quarters in a row my sales manager set

[00:54] the goal that they wanted to add six more outbound rooms.

[00:58] Two quarters in a row.

[00:59] Quarter came, quarter left, quarter came, quarter left.

[01:02] This is the third time that I've been hearing them make this goal.

[01:06] And everyone was nodding their heads and writing down and it seemed like everything was

[01:09] honky dory.

[01:10] And I stopped and I was like, guys we've had this goal for two quarters.

[01:15] Why do we expect it to be any different this time?

[01:18] To set the same goal and nothing's going to happen.

[01:20] And for context the reason I said 10 to 12 million is because every upbound

[01:23] rep generates about $2 million a year in revenue for my business.

[01:26] And so for me to have six more reps is about $12 million.

[01:29] So I'm not just pulling that over and that's where it comes from.

[01:31] That's the story.

[01:32] I asked him, I was like why weren't you able to do this?

[01:35] So well, we lost a couple reps this last quarter, even though we hired some new ones.

[01:40] And we pretty much have the same amount as we had four.

[01:42] And I was like, and is that what happened the quarter before that too?

[01:45] He was like, well yeah, I was like, then how are you going to solve this problem?

[01:48] It's like, um, I don't know.

[01:51] And then it hit me.

[01:52] I've been driving this guy and putting my pressure on this guy when he was not the

[01:57] constraint of the system.

[01:58] Let me explain in every system you have potential and you have constraints.

[02:03] Most entrepreneurs spend all their time trying to add potential to their business thinking

[02:08] that they're solving the constraint.

[02:10] But we will always grow any system will grow up to its constraint and no further.

[02:15] And so right now your business has a constraint.

[02:18] You have to identify it.

[02:19] And what makes macro speed happen is not is not the friend'siness and the frenetic energy.

[02:25] It's knowing which problems to solve and what order.

[02:27] And the example I'm going to give you is showing you exactly why that didn't happen

[02:31] for one of my companies for this specific channel we were marketing on, which is out

[02:34] out.

[02:35] Had we identified this problem two quarters ago, we would have added 10 million to our top line

[02:40] for this year which we won't have.

[02:42] So instead we're going to get one quarters worth of that.

[02:44] So maybe add two million or two and a half million to top on when we

[02:47] should have added 10 or 12 because of this one problem.

[02:50] And from the outside people were going to say, oh well it's because of X, Y, and Z.

[02:54] But they didn't diagnose the problem.

[02:55] Do you know what it was?

[02:57] I'll tell you.

[02:57] So I then turned to my HR director and I said, how many people are you sending the sales manager

[03:03] per week?

[03:04] She was like, well I sent him about one qualf I can't edit a week.

[03:09] And I was like, okay how many interviews does it take you to send one qualf I can't.

[03:13] She says it takes five.

[03:15] I was like okay manager.

[03:17] How many of these final interviews does it take for you to get one person hired?

[03:20] And he was like four.

[03:21] And I was like so it takes us 20 people that we got to get through to get one new

[03:25] op-up.

[03:26] He was like yeah, it's like okay.

[03:28] Now given the churn that we had in the last quarter and two quarters because just FYI for everybody

[03:33] frontline position in general tend to turn more than manager and leadership positions.

[03:37] Just his name in the game.

[03:38] And I was like okay so what is our churn in that position?

[03:41] He was like it's about 20% a quarter.

[03:42] I was like okay understood.

[03:45] Now simple math here.

[03:46] If we have 10 people who are working out on that's not the number but let's just say it's 10.

[03:50] And we lose 20% that it means we're losing two people a quarter.

[03:53] If right now the process that you have gets us one new op-on-rep per month and we're losing two

[03:59] a quarter that means we would net one new person per quarter.

[04:02] That is going to be very short of our goal of six.

[04:04] So what do we need to do?

[04:06] We'd to fix the actual hiring process in order to meet the goal.

[04:10] And so what we did was we actually asked the HR director.

[04:13] I said why are we doing these one on one?

[04:14] She's like well I'd thought we had to do that.

[04:16] Miscommunication.

[04:17] Right?

[04:17] It's all about this.

[04:18] It's a miscommunication.

[04:19] So we don't need that for this position.

[04:21] What she now did, the solution to this problem was that she's setting up.

[04:24] She's still running the ads.

[04:25] She's still organizing the interviews.

[04:27] But she set them all up for the sales manager to do group interviews.

[04:31] And now he can do five group interviews for one hour per week.

[04:36] And now he can pick one or two of those people and get them onboarded quickly.

[04:40] And he can start hiring.

[04:41] He will be able to hit his goal in that way.

[04:45] And so the reason I tell the story is because I just missed out on a bunch of revenue that I

[04:49] should have been able to make because we were solving the wrong problem.

[04:53] All of the focus was on the sales manager and who he was bringing in and how he was training them

[04:59] rather than because that wasn't the constraint of the system rather than what is the acquisition

[05:04] process for talent.

[05:05] And so I'll give you a framework that I wrote down somewhere that I'll probably share in another

[05:10] video. But it's something called the Quad Marketing Calendar.

[05:12] Most people have no marketing calendar.

[05:15] Smart people have one or two marketing calendars.

[05:18] So the first marketing calendar and you can draw this, you know what?

[05:21] I'll do it for you right now.

[05:23] All right. So the Quad Marketing Calendar looks like this.

[05:25] Here you've got internal and you've got external.

[05:28] So here you have employees and you've got prospects.

[05:33] Internally, which is this way, you should be marketing to your employees

[05:38] so that you tell them about the vision and about the mission about why you do what you do.

[05:43] This has to happen all the time so that people continue to want to work for you.

[05:47] Internally to your prospects, which are now customers over here, you need to continue to market them

[05:52] to get them to buy again and again, right? We need to keep them to keep on.

[05:58] Over here, in external, for prospects, you need to get people to become customers.

[06:05] So we're marketing externally. Most people understand this one.

[06:07] This is the one that most people do.

[06:09] Most people don't do this one. Most people definitely don't do this one.

[06:11] And I'll tell you the one that people miss the most. This one.

[06:16] It's that they don't have an acquisition process for getting new talent.

[06:20] So just like you, run ads, generate leads, nurture leads, set appointments, sell,

[06:28] fulfill. You should be able to run ads for new employees.

[06:34] You should be generating leads. You should be working those leads. You should be setting

[06:39] interviews, which are sales. You make job offers, just like you make normal offers.

[06:45] And then the onboarding experience that you have for our customer is the onboarding experience

[06:49] that you have in parallel with an employee. And then just like you continue to ascend and

[06:56] resell your customers, you ascend and continue to manage your employees.

[07:04] These are parallel processes that happen in every business and most people don't know about it.

[07:08] And you heard about it here first. At the world's best YouTube channel in the world,

[07:13] the handsomeist and most sickly now, Roona Ritten YouTuber out there.

[07:19] And this is called the Quadbarding Calendar. And it was because we were missing this framework.

[07:23] My HR director did not understand this framework that we lost out on 10 to 12 million

[07:27] dollars revenue and I don't want you to do that. And so the reason I made this video is so that

[07:31] you can recognize which of these four in the Quadmarking Calendar you are not using,

[07:37] so that you can shore up that part of your business and ultimately scale it and make all of your

[07:42] wildest dreams come true. All right, my name is Alex Mowzi. Like I said, I'm an acquisition.com.

[07:46] Hope you enjoyed this video and I'll see you guys the next one. Keep being awesome. Bye!

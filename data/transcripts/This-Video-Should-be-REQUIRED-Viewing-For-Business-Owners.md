[00:00] This should be required viewing for business owners.

[00:02] I'm going to explain a growth concept

[00:03] that every business needs and four tactics to get it.

[00:06] Come on, follow me.

[00:08] Every business begins with effort and money

[00:12] from the founder or investors that begin the business.

[00:15] From there, you begin to get customers, right?

[00:18] So you advertise, you sell, and people come in the door

[00:22] and they buy your stuff.

[00:23] Now, once customers come in, they get some sort of result.

[00:28] Now, after they get the result,

[00:30] you then have some sort of reviews or word of mouth

[00:37] that those results will generate.

[00:39] And then that can then in turn get you more customers.

[00:44] And so this initial effort and money goes into the system,

[00:46] that gets you customers, those customers get results.

[00:49] Those results drive reviews and word of mouth,

[00:52] which then get you more customers.

[00:53] The problem is most businesses don't have a good process

[00:58] here or here.

[00:59] And so all they have to do, their wheels look like this.

[01:02] After the money, customers, resolve, more effort and money,

[01:06] customers resolve, and they end up dumping a lot of effort

[01:09] out this way.

[01:10] And so this creates a linear system where all you do

[01:13] is you have to put more in and you get more out.

[01:14] This growth concept is to create a self-reinforcing system

[01:18] where every action or component builds momentum

[01:21] and drives the next creating sustainable growth over time

[01:24] without the continuous input of more effort and more money

[01:28] on the side of the founders and our investors.

[01:32] So, taxing number one, after you've delivered service

[01:35] for whatever it is, whether you're a plumber and you go to a house

[01:38] or you're a waitress and you just served a customer,

[01:40] after you've delivered the value that you deliver

[01:41] with your core product or service,

[01:43] you then offer a free gift.

[01:45] Now, that gift is gonna be relative to the amount

[01:47] of money that someone spent.

[01:48] If someone spends 20 bucks,

[01:50] maybe you just give them a bunch of mints.

[01:52] If someone spent maybe $100, maybe you give them a $5 dessert.

[01:57] If someone spends $1,000, maybe you give them a $50 gift

[02:01] like this lovely money blanket,

[02:03] which is definitely not $50.

[02:05] But the point is that you wanna give them a surprise gift.

[02:08] Number one, now once we give that gift,

[02:11] we wanna pair it because we're gonna,

[02:12] we basically, if we've done a good job,

[02:15] we will have banked a little bit of reciprocity.

[02:17] And so then at that point, and this is the key part,

[02:19] the person who gives the gift is not the person

[02:21] necessarily asked for the review.

[02:23] So then either the manager of the restaurant,

[02:26] the shift manager, somebody who is representing that person,

[02:30] then says, hey, by the way, if you leave a review,

[02:35] we give this person $50.

[02:37] So instead of incentivizing the customer,

[02:39] we're actually just saying this person who did you good

[02:41] and gave you this gift, we're gonna pay them

[02:44] if you leave a review.

[02:45] And so this allows the customer to say,

[02:47] you know what, I kinda wanna pay back that server.

[02:49] I wanna pay back that plumber.

[02:50] I wanna pay back that person who helped me out

[02:52] and gave me the surprise gift by leaving a review.

[02:56] And the further away the person who makes the ask is

[02:58] from the business owner, the more compelling I believe it is.

[03:02] Provided is legal within your area,

[03:04] obviously laws apply for advertising.

[03:06] Let's tell you a story.

[03:07] When Leyla and I were out in a different area

[03:10] traveling for some speaking thing,

[03:12] she had to go get her hair done or something.

[03:15] And so she quickly was looking on yelp to try and find

[03:19] a good hair person.

[03:21] And when she was there, she looked at the reviews

[03:25] unsurprisingly.

[03:26] And so there was one that had a five star

[03:28] but had like 20 reviews.

[03:30] And another had like a 4.6 stars

[03:32] but had a thousand reviews.

[03:33] Which one do you think she went to?

[03:35] The 4.6 stars with a thousand reviews.

[03:38] And so the question is that how much was each of those

[03:40] incremental reviews worth if the person who has the most

[03:43] reviews ends up getting 90% of the search volume?

[03:46] Well, a hell of a lot.

[03:48] And so should we be willing to pay for reviews not directly

[03:52] but indirectly in the answer is yes.

[03:54] This completely works with physical products.

[03:57] Obviously you could just include inside of the box

[03:59] some sort of QR code or link saying,

[04:02] hey, leave a review and give the gift an exchange

[04:06] or you can give it up front.

[04:07] I wish they would do some research on this.

[04:09] I've tried both and to be honest with you, they both work.

[04:12] So step one is surprise gift.

[04:19] Step two is third party.

[04:25] Ask.

[04:26] The amount that you're willing to pay for the gift

[04:29] and a bonus that you pay your team

[04:30] should be proportional with a reviews worth to you.

[04:33] And so if I have a new business

[04:35] and I have almost no reviews,

[04:37] each additional reviews worth significantly more

[04:39] than once I have 10,000 reviews.

[04:41] But I should still have that review system in place

[04:43] to grease the groove and basically continue the growth

[04:46] loop along its path.

[04:47] So if you happen to live under a rock

[04:49] and not believe that reviews are a very valuable thing

[04:52] in business, the highest percentage of sales

[04:55] across any market come from word of mouth.

[04:58] It's from people telling other people about stuff

[05:00] and people seeing other people use products

[05:04] and being like, hey, what is that?

[05:05] Or who do you use for?

[05:07] When you bought a house, you probably didn't respond to it.

[05:10] You probably did ask your friends

[05:11] for what realtor they used in that area.

[05:14] You're asked your neighbors.

[05:15] And the higher the stakes of the purchase,

[05:18] the more referrals are important.

[05:20] The lower the ticket, the less it can be dependent.

[05:24] But the conversion on the first sale

[05:26] will still be dependent on the proof that you demonstrate.

[05:28] And so I'd like to incorporate proof in all aspects

[05:31] of my business.

[05:32] And here's an image of a lobby where we put proof

[05:35] floor to ceiling of people's five star reviews.

[05:38] Because the advanced tactic here

[05:39] is that once you do start getting these reviews coming in,

[05:42] what do you think you should do?

[05:44] Display them everywhere you possibly can.

[05:46] And if you have an in-person business,

[05:48] you have a double effect compared to everybody else.

[05:51] Because you can just literally have someone walk into your lobby

[05:54] of all five star reviews.

[05:56] And it just anchors what type of business you are,

[05:59] which is that you over-deliver to customers

[06:00] and you do a good job.

[06:02] And so if I were a waitress, I might say,

[06:04] hey, by the way,

[06:06] here's some hints if it's really cheap

[06:08] at the type of food that I serve.

[06:09] But more realistically, I'd probably be willing to pay

[06:12] whatever the cost of a slice of chocolate cake is

[06:14] or whatever the dessert is and say, hey,

[06:16] it's on me, you guys were awesome.

[06:18] Thank you so much.

[06:19] And then when my manager comes through

[06:21] and says, by the way, Jessica,

[06:25] where I'd say, by the way, our staff gets a $10 bonus

[06:28] if anyone leaves a five star review

[06:29] if you mentioned their name.

[06:31] It would mean a lot to us and it obviously

[06:32] mean a lot to Jessica.

[06:33] So, you know, thanks so much.

[06:35] And so if Jessica does it and then asks for the review,

[06:37] it would still probably work if they like Jessica,

[06:40] but it's so much cleaner to have the manager come afterwards

[06:42] and then say, hey, if you leave a review,

[06:44] Jessica gets 10 bucks.

[06:45] My team asks me like, well, how,

[06:47] like, that's gonna take time for the manager

[06:49] and I was like, okay, well, think about the hypothetical

[06:51] extreme here.

[06:52] So, let's say that your restaurant turns 10 tables an hour.

[06:55] Okay, then for a manager to go and deliver that line,

[06:59] we'll take maybe five minutes to hit all those 10 tables.

[07:02] And that's like, if that,

[07:03] if you've ever had a manager come over,

[07:04] it's usually like 20 seconds.

[07:06] It's not a very long time.

[07:07] But imagine the effect of that,

[07:09] which is that that restaurant every day gets

[07:11] 10 five star reviews.

[07:12] Because that means that 10% let's say they turn,

[07:14] you know, they're open for 10 hours.

[07:16] They turn 10 tables an hour.

[07:17] It's 100 tables that they turn.

[07:18] It's like, okay, one out of those 10 leaves the review.

[07:21] 10 five star reviews a day.

[07:23] At the end of the year, you've got almost 4,000 reviews.

[07:25] Like, worth it.

[07:27] And if the team knows that they're gonna be measured on reviews

[07:30] and you can obviously track what percentage of them

[07:32] get five star reviews,

[07:34] you have another really high quality metric

[07:36] for customer satisfaction is what percentage of tables

[07:39] that this person served actually did the review,

[07:41] what percentage of homes that this particular home

[07:44] service this guy does leaves a five star review.

[07:46] So it just gives you a second metric

[07:48] to look at customer satisfaction in the realest way possible

[07:50] that generates revenue.

[07:52] And if you do all of a sudden find one waitress

[07:54] or one guy who's going out in the field

[07:56] and he's getting way more reviews than anyone else,

[07:58] just ask what they're doing differently

[07:59] and then teach everybody else.

[08:00] And then step three is make it easy.

[08:06] And so if I'm the manager,

[08:07] I'm gonna come by with a QR code on my own

[08:10] on a little, a little, a frame thing,

[08:11] one of these little, a little, a bit of you guys

[08:12] and I'll leave it on the table right next to the check.

[08:15] Like, I wanna make it easy for them to take the next step.

[08:17] That also means that over time,

[08:19] if I boost the hell out of my yelp

[08:20] then I'm like, okay, now I'm gonna boost my Google review.

[08:22] So I can shift my QR code.

[08:23] Now I'm gonna boost my Facebook and Meta reviews.

[08:26] Right like, each one of these,

[08:27] I can shift over time and it might just be,

[08:29] you know it and then eventually,

[08:30] since I hate just follow this on Instagram,

[08:32] or it could be, hey, give us your phone number

[08:35] and we'll give you this thing, right?

[08:36] And then they're on our text list.

[08:38] And if you like that first tactic,

[08:40] I talk about it at length inside of my customer

[08:42] for a chapter, inside of the leads book.

[08:44] And so inside of here, I'll give you the referral growth

[08:47] equations, so you know exactly how much you can spend

[08:50] on referrals and how to make them viral.

[08:53] And the tactics that actually create

[08:56] the ways to get customers to do this more often

[08:59] and bring in higher quality people.

[09:01] And so the seven tactics are inside this book,

[09:03] you can download it, they're absolutely free.

[09:05] This book is free if you want a digital format on audio

[09:08] and the links in the description.

[09:10] So the second tactic to reinforce that review flywheel

[09:13] that then grows the business

[09:14] and gets more customers is merch.

[09:17] Now hold on, what do you mean by that?

[09:19] So I realized that my first gym,

[09:21] I was there all the time and you know,

[09:23] we got a decent amount of five-star reviews.

[09:26] And when I opened my second location,

[09:27] it was like starting from scratch again.

[09:29] I had no reviews, no one knew me in the area.

[09:31] And I was like, man, I got a jumpstart this thing.

[09:33] And so I had all these t-shirts that I had put,

[09:36] and I probably had overstocked the amount of t-shirts

[09:38] that I was gonna sell in the lobby.

[09:39] But I noticed that the shirts didn't sell that much.

[09:41] I mean like they hung up and I'd move a couple every week,

[09:44] but it wasn't a huge amount of volume.

[09:45] It sounds like man, these shirts would be so much more

[09:48] valuable to me if two things happen.

[09:50] One is if people actually wore them.

[09:52] Two is if they turned into something more valuable

[09:54] than just wearing them, which is, well,

[09:57] what if I could accomplish both at the same time,

[09:59] by just giving them away, in exchange for three reviews?

[10:03] And so I made this post inside of the group

[10:05] that I had for all my gym members.

[10:07] And I said, hey, I'm opening up my next location.

[10:09] If you guys have loved the service,

[10:10] go get a workout at the new location.

[10:12] And if you do, I'll give you free t-shirt.

[10:15] And so the t-shirts cost me five bucks.

[10:17] But then what they had to do to get the t-shirt

[10:19] was they had to leave a review on yelp,

[10:21] on Google, and on Facebook, and check in.

[10:23] And so I had them do four things in exchange for the shirt.

[10:26] But guess what happened?

[10:28] Over night, I had like 155 star reviews for my new location.

[10:31] And I had all these people that were rocking my merch.

[10:34] So when they're out, grocery shopping,

[10:35] when they see their friends, they're like,

[10:36] oh, what's that?

[10:37] And then I get some word of mouth from that.

[10:39] And so it was a two bird, one stone, one organic word of mouth,

[10:42] other digital word of mouth that is able to do,

[10:45] by simply saying, hey, if you want some merch here,

[10:49] you want one of these jackets that has this nice logo on it,

[10:52] just leave a review.

[10:54] Most people, especially if you have a recurring revenue base,

[10:56] you're more than happy to leave a review for you.

[10:58] So obviously brick and mortar,

[11:00] you can just give merch straight up, right?

[11:02] So like if you had a gym,

[11:03] or anything that people are in a recurring membership with,

[11:06] you could do that.

[11:07] Now, what if you're a, you know, like the plumbing business?

[11:10] Well, the first tactic would probably work better for you.

[11:13] So if your B to B, merch might not be as meaningful

[11:16] to your customers as if you're B to C.

[11:20] Because if they are frequenting your business on regular basis,

[11:22] they probably have some brand affinity,

[11:24] they're okay wearing it,

[11:25] and they would do stuff in exchange to get that kind of merch.

[11:29] Now, the other two taxes you want to share with you

[11:31] will help you if you are in one of those B to B situations.

[11:34] And so here's how the tactic works.

[11:38] Here's my world's best t-shirt.

[11:40] There we go.

[11:41] You pay five bucks for the t-shirt,

[11:43] and then that t-shirt then gets you a yellow per view.

[11:47] It gets you a Google review.

[11:50] It gets you a meta review,

[11:53] which is wherever you're running your ads from.

[11:55] So this stuff is so important because what we're thinking about here is

[11:57] how do people actually find your business?

[12:00] Well, they're gonna search on y'all,

[12:01] depending on the industry you're in.

[12:03] You're gonna be running Google PPC ads,

[12:06] or they're gonna be searching on Google,

[12:07] and they're gonna find a Thresio.

[12:09] You're running ads on meta.

[12:10] And so we're covering each of the platforms,

[12:12] the surface area that someone is coming in.

[12:14] So even though we're asking for three,

[12:16] for every new customer,

[12:17] they're only gonna see maybe one of these things.

[12:19] And then finally, we get the actual word of mouth

[12:21] from actually wearing the thing in public.

[12:24] And this is just organic.

[12:25] And so in each of these situations,

[12:26] we're actually covering a new type of advertising,

[12:29] only with one $5 gift.

[12:31] If you're less comfortable with giving out the,

[12:34] like if you're like my brand's not that strong right now,

[12:36] then you can have just an inspirational quote or saying on the shirt.

[12:39] So when I did my shirts,

[12:40] I think I had a beast mode engaged shirt.

[12:43] My customers were wearing that rather than my logo,

[12:47] but my logo was on the back or the side.

[12:49] So you can put it on the sleeve or you can put it on the back,

[12:51] if you wanna have some cool fact to that goes with it.

[12:53] So what's the third tactic?

[12:55] Home, you give them a big pile of money.

[12:57] No, not exactly.

[12:58] But instead, we actually just offer a discount.

[13:01] And so the amount that you can offer the discounts

[13:03] to be proportional whatever your gross profit is

[13:05] in the average ticket.

[13:06] And so I was talking to a restaurant owner

[13:07] not that long ago.

[13:08] He needed to get new reviews for new locations.

[13:10] And so the strategy we came up with was really simple.

[13:12] I said, well, would you give somebody a dollar off their meal

[13:15] and use a very budget diner in terms of the type of establishment

[13:18] he was running very high volume.

[13:20] And I said, would you give a dollar off?

[13:21] So there's about 5% of the average ticket

[13:23] of somebody who's walking in the door.

[13:24] And he said, yeah, I would pay a dollar.

[13:26] I was like, right, because that means you pay $5,000

[13:28] for $5,000 review.

[13:29] So like, that's a good deal.

[13:31] And so what we decided to do is that when people came

[13:34] with the check, they would put the pay for fat,

[13:37] if you wanna save a dollar on each person,

[13:39] each person can leave a review,

[13:42] and we put the little QR code on top.

[13:44] And then the waitress, when she delivered the check,

[13:46] also basically drew attention to it and said,

[13:48] hey, if you do that, I'll go bring your check back

[13:50] with the discount included.

[13:52] And so you think about this as a meta concept,

[13:54] the first two example I gave you were things

[13:56] where you add something good.

[13:57] You add some sort of incentive.

[13:59] The first one is you add something,

[14:00] but not an exchange for anything,

[14:02] based on reciprocity, and then the goodwill goes

[14:04] to the person who did the service.

[14:06] The second one is where you give a direct exchange

[14:08] with the cost, like do this for me,

[14:09] and I'll do this for you.

[14:10] Very quick pro-crow, very straightforward.

[14:12] This one with the discount is about removing bad stuff.

[14:16] And so bad stuff being the price of whatever they had to pay.

[14:20] And so the most effective way to do this in my opinion

[14:22] is as the check or as the invoice is being delivered.

[14:25] And this is where people mess this up.

[14:27] Is that they will say, hey, if you leave for a review,

[14:29] we'll give you 20% off your next one.

[14:31] You will be able to give significantly less off

[14:33] if you just say it's available right now.

[14:36] And so latency is one of the strongest multipliers

[14:39] of a persuasive tool.

[14:41] Risk and delay actually worked very similarly

[14:45] in people's minds.

[14:46] So the further out it is,

[14:48] the less powerful the thing that you give.

[14:50] They say, hey, I'll give you $100 in a year

[14:52] if you leave a review.

[14:53] Most people would rather have $2 off today.

[14:55] So number one is at point of sale.

[14:59] So it's when you present the price.

[15:01] So once you present the price,

[15:02] and you get acceptance on the price,

[15:04] then you offer the discount.

[15:06] Discount presented.

[15:08] You then get them to say, yes, they want to do it.

[15:10] If they do it, so this is now you verify

[15:13] that they actually did the review.

[15:14] So you have them show you that they did the review.

[15:17] Then you recalculate,

[15:22] view of raw price, and then you hand them the final check.

[15:25] And then both parties are better off.

[15:27] So number four, keys.

[15:30] Well, the fourth tactic is a bonus tactic for you,

[15:33] but it's any kind of unlockable.

[15:35] Now this works particularly well

[15:37] with any kind of B2B service business,

[15:39] anything that's national or digital rather than in person.

[15:42] So the first three that I gave are very,

[15:44] IRL driven.

[15:46] So the discounts you can use whenever,

[15:48] but like giving a real in person gift,

[15:50] or giving merch sometimes can be a little bit harder

[15:53] online versus in person.

[15:55] So if you have online, what you can do is you can unlock

[15:58] either media, which is, hey, we're gonna give you

[16:02] some sort of training that's associated with this,

[16:05] or VIP trial.

[16:10] So what does that mean?

[16:10] And this is why this is extra nasty in a good way.

[16:14] Which is, if you have multiple levels of service,

[16:16] you're cost to deliver that service

[16:17] is typically not overwhelmingly high, right?

[16:20] When people do these add-ons.

[16:21] So like if you're an SEO agency, for example,

[16:23] maybe you'll rank another domain or you'll start,

[16:26] you'll spin up extra backlinks or whatever,

[16:28] whatever your core service is.

[16:30] And you say, hey, by the way, if you do this,

[16:33] I will unlock a trial of a higher level of service

[16:36] for a 30 day period, something like that.

[16:39] The benefit of this is that not only do you get the review,

[16:42] you also give the customer a trial,

[16:44] a taste of the higher end version of the service

[16:47] that you deliver.

[16:49] And so this becomes extra powerful

[16:50] because it starts with goodwill.

[16:53] And you may just end up converting these customers

[16:55] into more valuable customers over time.

[16:58] So you get, you literally get paid to get reviews.

[17:01] Now if you have a media thing that you wanna unlock,

[17:03] call it a training, call it an event, call it something like that.

[17:05] You can do that as well in the IRL version of this.

[17:09] You can have call it an annual event

[17:11] that people are invited to and they're ticket to get in

[17:13] is that they left a review.

[17:14] And you can do this both virtually or in real life.

[17:16] And so anything that you can give away

[17:18] that is remote would obviously work.

[17:20] And I also like having trials of services

[17:23] or pieces of a higher level to encourage people to one taste it

[17:28] and then maybe just maybe give us money for it later.

[17:31] And so here's the deal.

[17:32] If you don't do this, what's going to happen

[17:35] is that you're going to have a linear business,

[17:37] you have to keep flowing effort and money in

[17:40] and then money comes out.

[17:40] And you have to keep doing this over and over again.

[17:42] And when you stop doing this, you stop getting this.

[17:45] But when you set up a system like this

[17:48] where you have a loop where customers get results,

[17:50] results turn into reviews

[17:51] and then those reviews get you more customers,

[17:53] the business over time becomes self-sustaining.

[17:56] And so every business has to have this in place

[17:59] if they hope to separate themselves from the investors

[18:01] or founders who breathe life in it to begin with.

[18:04] You want the engine to run without you.

[18:07] You are a lighter fluid, not the log,

[18:09] because if you're the log, you'll eventually get burned out.

[18:12] As you get tons and tons of reviews in your business,

[18:14] you get more customers from it.

[18:15] Everyone's in awe, you're going to get a negative review.

[18:17] And this video shows you how to handle it.

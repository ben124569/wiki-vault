[00:00] What's going on everyone in this video I'm going to show you the number one mistake that I made and that I see a lot of entrepreneurs making in terms of how to make more money from their business

[00:09] So the number one metric that I track for our businesses is this one and you may not even ever this one

[00:16] But I think it is the most important and Warren Buffett agrees with me. All right. It's net

[00:22] free

[00:23] cash flow, all right. Say it and then imprint it into your minds

[00:27] All right and obviously this depends on what type of business you're running

[00:32] But what net free cash flow is is the amount of money that an owner of a business can take out of the business after

[00:39] The business reinvests in staying ahead of the competition and maintaining its competitive advantage, right?

[00:45] And so the problem with the vast majority of businesses and or business owners is that what they do is at some level

[00:52] I mean the first problem is that many of them don't make any profit, right?

[00:55] So that's probably like problem number one and when you say I'm reinvesting the business and the reality is that you're not making a profit

[01:01] You need to be real with yourself. That's probably what's happening

[01:04] category two is a type of businesses that are making a profit

[01:08] But then they take that profit and they reinvest it back into the business now

[01:13] I'm not saying that this is necessarily a bad idea

[01:15] I'm saying that for me in my entrepreneurial experience

[01:20] I like to take money out of businesses. I like to make money while I'm growing businesses and this comes hard learned

[01:27] because in my first

[01:29] Five years when I started my businesses at the time I was starting gyms and

[01:35] No online fitness coaching business to whenever I would make money for my gym

[01:39] I would open up another location which sucked, right?

[01:44] I mean it sounds great and but I was asset rich and cash poor, all right?

[01:49] And that may improve a problem that you were suffering from too

[01:52] I had equipment, I had leases, I had flooring, I had signage, I had lobbies, I had front desks, I had glass walls

[01:57] I had all of the things except for money in my bank account

[02:00] and when it ended up happening is I actually

[02:04] After after three four five whatever years it was

[02:08] When I sold those companies

[02:11] I ended up getting out of them relatively quickly and I took all the money I got from those sales

[02:16] Which I would consider like short sales they were kind of garage sales. I pretty much assaulted them as assets rather than as businesses

[02:21] Because I wanted to do this new thing which was gym lunch

[02:24] But what ended up happening those I took all that money and I went into a new venture

[02:27] So gym lunch happened after this, but there was a little period of time there where I

[02:31] Did something new with a partner that I thought I was gonna be partnered with and I'll just say in short terms it didn't work out

[02:38] And so what ended up happening is I didn't get a ton of money for the gyms that I sold and then all that money

[02:44] Disappeared and at that moment I promised myself

[02:48] I'm never making the mistake mismastic again because when I had a happening is that after all those years and all that you know all that time

[02:53] And the money that I had made all of it was gone

[02:56] I was like I've made millions at that point dollars in revenue right and I had nothing you don't I mean and so I see this a lot

[03:06] And the thing is is that a lot of us entrepreneurs have this dream that someday we're gonna sell

[03:10] The reality is the chips are stacked against you all right 99% of businesses don't get sold ever

[03:16] Right and so this idea that we're gonna have this mythical exit someday right from most businesses isn't true and

[03:23] Of the of the businesses that it is true many of those exits aren't as sexy as they may sound like right

[03:28] Like I technically exited those businesses, but it wasn't like you know

[03:32] I wasn't set for life

[03:34] I mean I think it was like multiple it was like 200 grand 300 it wasn't a lot of money

[03:39] That I made from those I think I sold all in all

[03:43] Covering partnerships and all that stuff. I think I all in got

[03:47] 200 grand I think for selling six locations like it was just not a lot right and

[03:54] If you've been doing this for years then that exit if you've been like I've been doing this for at that time

[03:58] I think for four or five years like that's like 40 grand a year

[04:01] Right if I had been just ripping cash out of the business and stacking it the whole time

[04:06] I would have had a lot more money than that at that point right and so this is a mistake

[04:10] That I see a lot of entrepreneurs make is that they're not focused on this

[04:14] net free cash flow right they're not thinking how can I take money out of this business every single year?

[04:20] How can this business pump out profits while I still continue to grow it and some of that also comes from the

[04:25] Exhibition of how quickly I want to grow

[04:27] So a lot of times we want to grow really fast for no reason only the arbitrary reasons that we set for ourselves

[04:32] And the expectations of others that we project right but there's really no reason to do it

[04:36] But we end up just growing irresponsibly and then in so doing do it wastefully and

[04:43] Expose ourselves to higher risk in more mistakes and in the process also lose the one thing that we get along the way

[04:49] If you do it the right way which is net free cash flow as in like getting paid to grow your business

[04:53] I try I remember I sat down with some of my employees

[04:56] Probably eight years ago. It was actually at the gyms and I think they had said that they wanted to get a raise or something like a camera

[05:01] We're worse and I was like do you understand the difference between like imagine working for an entire month

[05:07] Right working our house off every hour of the day right and then at the end of the month not only did I not pay you

[05:13] I just cleaned out your savings for working that hard

[05:17] They're like yeah, that would suck and I'm like that happens to me all the time

[05:23] Right and so that's the thing is we take on so much risk and you start to get used to the risk because you've just been doing it for such a long time

[05:29] But you have to reward yourself for the risk that you were taking all right now

[05:34] The reason that I like net free cash flow is that it focuses the entire company on not just making a profit

[05:40] But making a profit and access of what is required to continue to run and grow the business all right

[05:46] And so

[05:47] This is the number one step

[05:49] That I look at this is what I have my funny steam report on for all of our entities because this is the real real

[05:56] This is owner earnings this is what Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger calculate with the companies that they want to buy because they're like

[06:02] We hate companies where we buy them and then we take all the profit and have to reinvest all that money back into the same business

[06:08] Right they're like that sucks

[06:10] They're that's why they said they don't like manufacturing and they don't like a lot of types of companies where you have to have all these capital expenses

[06:15] Meaning money expenses that you buy big stuff that you know depreciate over time

[06:19] They're like that sucks right and so

[06:23] Net free cash flow is the stat that I track and if you were interested at all

[06:28] I was reading a book recently called the little book that beats the market really good book

[06:32] You can read in one sitting

[06:34] Really fascinating actually and he posits that there are only two metrics that are really important for tracking

[06:41] For really getting above average returns, right the first is the PE ratio

[06:45] Which is the price to earnings ratio and if you think about Warren Buffett talks about in terms of buying businesses

[06:50] He says you want to buy good businesses for cheap prices, right?

[06:52] So the figuring out whether it's a cheap price is gonna be the price to earnings ratio how much how much?

[06:57] Neffery cash flow how much how much earnings is this company creating not that there's the same thing

[07:01] But I'm just saying generally right how much how much what's the earnings of this company?

[07:06] And what's the price for those earnings?

[07:07] All right, so this is number one

[07:09] So ideally you want a really low price for really higher earnings now the second thing is

[07:15] Return on capital

[07:17] And so what that means is now imagine a company that had I'll give you two scenarios. Let's say we've got a company that

[07:24] You know, let's say they make a million dollars in profit and when they reinvest a million dollars in profit into their company

[07:30] Let's say it's opening locations just for whatever reason, right?

[07:32] So when they open a new location and front across a million dollar show of location and then that location gets them

[07:38] 100,000 dollars a year in additional earnings, all right?

[07:41] That's a 10% return on capital, right?

[07:44] That's what that means now let's take an alternative scenario. Let's say that another company

[07:49] For a million dollars can open 10 locations

[07:52] And each of those locations can do a hundred thousand dollars a year, right?

[07:55] That would be a 100% return on capital and so the beauty of these two metrics is

[08:02] The PE the price to earning ratio tells you this is a is the price of the business

[08:07] We're buying this is a cheaper business, right?

[08:10] The return on capital tells us the quality of the business that we're buying which is how good is this business?

[08:15] A great business is a business that can take a small amount of money and make it generate lots of cash from it

[08:19] Right, and so by combining these two things

[08:22] Finding the companies that have the lowest PE ratio with the highest return on capital

[08:26] You can consistently beat the market. That's kind of the premise of the book, which is really interesting

[08:30] They use this algorithm that did these two things and they beat the the S&P 500 which is basically

[08:35] I don't know same possible. It's it's very difficult to do for most people and they beat it for I think like 25 years

[08:41] Which is nuts

[08:42] By a big percentage which was crazy the thing is is that the companies that are usually in this bucket are usually companies that are going through issues

[08:48] And so you're basically buying mispriced bets, right?

[08:51] And half the companies that you buy that that meet these two qualifications end up taking

[08:55] But the other half that might have had some bad press because of something are disproportionately

[09:00] discounted in pricing

[09:02] And as a result in the future they they outperform the price that you're paying for them right and so to to bring the wagon back around here

[09:11] As business owners

[09:13] Net free cash flow is my home base. This is what I care about

[09:16] This is the money that I get to deposit at the end of every month because tomorrow may never come

[09:21] We may get outlawed our business may be outlawed there may be there may be some horrendous thing that happens that blows your business up

[09:29] You may have to move locations and stop everything that you're doing and you just don't know and so what we are all exposed to that

[09:35] We discount on a regular basis is something called operational risk. We are all exposed, right?

[09:40] And so if you're doing this for one year two year five years solely with the hope that some day

[09:47] You're going to sell

[09:48] Well, I just want to break the news to you that you have a 99 to one chance of not actually succeeding doing that

[09:54] And see you might as well take some money out of out of the business every month

[09:58] So you know you make money along the way and I can promise you having done it both ways

[10:02] Taking money out of the business every month is way more fun. It's also way less stressful

[10:07] All right because this is gonna be the stuff that allows you to know every month how we're really doing when you always leave it in the business account

[10:14] You'll always leave it in there. You just don't have a feeling for it

[10:16] But you should be able to deposit money in your account this month and be like this was better than last month

[10:21] Or this was worse than last month and you got to feel that not just the numbers

[10:24] But literally what you put into your account all right and so I'll give you one easy tactic

[10:30] That I was working with one of the one of the companies that I have an equity interest in

[10:35] Let's let's imagine you've got a big bucket of money. All right. This is your bank account for your business

[10:41] Every month you know after a certain amount of months what your projected fixed costs are going to be?

[10:46] All right now what I asked this entrepreneur to do

[10:50] Because he wasn't taking profit of the business so I was like hey, we're gonna fix this right now is you need to come up with a line

[10:55] And you say this is our line. This is our non-negotiable everything over this

[11:01] We take out every month all right so everything over a hundred grand everything over 500 grand

[11:05] We're going to take out of the business every single one where they clear this bitch, right all the way down to the bottom and

[11:11] By doing this you hold yourself accountable to this level

[11:14] All right and so to wrap this puppy up if you're not taking profit of the business

[11:19] I'd highly recommend doing it number one number two if you're not measuring net free cash flow

[11:24] You absolutely should because you're losing out of one of the most important metrics

[11:27] This is what Charlie Martin looks at this is what Warren Buffett looks at this is what I look at not that I'm in the same category as those guys

[11:32] But once I switch to this in terms of my finance and reporting it really clarified it for everything

[11:37] Just not just for me, but also for my team all right and when you're looking at businesses in general

[11:42] If you're thinking about reinvesting in the business make sure that the dollars that you're choosing to reinvest

[11:47] You're getting the best return of capital you possibly can all right

[11:51] So if you're reinvesting the business and you think you're gonna get 10% back

[11:55] We might as well just put it in the S&P and get that right and not even have to deal with all the mess and that's okay

[12:00] If you make a million bucks, you really make 500,000 year and you just put it in the S&P every single year

[12:05] You're gonna be really really wealthy

[12:07] Right and that's okay and so sometimes your wealth doesn't necessarily have to be generated

[12:12] It's all entirely from your business or from a sale that you someday hope to achieve that may not actually happen

[12:18] Okay, that's all I got for you. So that's my my moment for the die net free cash flow

[12:24] Track it stack it and make sure that you empty your bank account every single month and stack the right account

[12:30] Which is your personal bank account lots of love. Get you soon. Bye

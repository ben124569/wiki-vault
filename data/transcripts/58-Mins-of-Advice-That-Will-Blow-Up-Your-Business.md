[00:00] And audience and business owners ask me questions for four hours here the best moments.

[00:04] I want to company that basically scoops up dogs.

[00:07] Right.

[00:08] I love these other businesses.

[00:10] No one can.

[00:11] We're doing about 2 million a year and I want to get to 10 million a year as fast as possible.

[00:15] I'm so happy.

[00:16] I'm so happy.

[00:17] I'm so happy.

[00:18] And our business, it's somewhat seasonal as far as the acquisition goes.

[00:25] We basically double every first quarter of the year when I was a little smelton off and everything.

[00:29] But through the rest of the year, I want to start looking at acquiring other dog companies.

[00:34] Basically.

[00:35] So my question is when you're going to acquire other companies, how do you integrate it with your

[00:43] company to basically not work your money off by and to maximize the enterprise value for an investor?

[00:50] So I'd say that that is going to be a huge earn how you structure the deal.

[00:56] Are you keeping the operators on afterwards or not?

[00:59] Probably depend on the business and the deal.

[01:03] I would have some sort of big incentive for them to have bonus.

[01:07] Basically post integration.

[01:08] And so I'm way they're going to be highly incentivized to you know, you could have.

[01:13] Okay, we're in this together if this doesn't work then you're not going to get paid.

[01:18] And I think that's the fear.

[01:20] I think it's pretty fair.

[01:21] Especially a small because I'm assuming that.

[01:25] These are more and there.

[01:27] We're saying poop-oop-latter.

[01:29] The profit.

[01:30] Yes.

[01:31] So making the deal structure.

[01:37] I would try and separate the business out into what what the components are.

[01:40] Right?

[01:41] So it's like you have the routes that they do for you know, poop-oop-oop that I absolutely have for.

[01:44] Right?

[01:45] So you have you got the customer list then you've got the people who do the poop scooping.

[01:51] And then you probably have some sort of administrative stuff.

[01:53] I don't know if they have sales or marketing.

[01:55] I'm guessing you're pretty good at sales and marketing.

[01:57] So you don't need their sales and marketing trying to buy the book at business.

[02:00] Yeah, so it's just I think it's you'll probably just end up having an SOP for each of the core components.

[02:06] And there's a really good book for you.

[02:09] No, no, no, it's not easy to read this.

[02:11] It's called how to make a few billion dollars.

[02:14] The guy just did three roll-ups over his whole career and each roll-up he'd still have like 10 billion.

[02:20] And so it's really just understanding that all the business-of-components and you basically

[02:25] just have a massive checklist that you do when you integrate a business.

[02:30] Like that's literally it's just the world's longest checklist and every single integration

[02:34] you do you get a little bit better and you add things to the checklist until eventually

[02:37] you've covered every single thing and you can go faster and faster.

[02:40] If you studied waste management?

[02:41] Yeah, I mean, because literally you should.

[02:45] Yeah.

[02:46] I mean, literally how they grow.

[02:48] So finding routes, I mean, I would study everything about that business but it's really

[02:53] just breaking down the components and having SOPs that are associated with them.

[02:56] You need a rebrand the businesses you buy under the same brand and make it more attractive

[03:00] to you investors because I'm not really mad as much.

[03:03] I would probably rebrand it.

[03:05] If you really want to do the big play, you'll get a premium for it.

[03:08] Thank you.

[03:09] Yeah, you bet.

[03:10] Hi.

[03:11] Hello.

[03:12] So my question is regarding emails.

[03:15] Email marketing.

[03:16] The thing is that we currently have a quite good lead magnet, which is free and which

[03:22] is good.

[03:24] But the problem is that as soon as they opt in and start to get emails from us, it's only

[03:29] that can about an open rate from 20 to 25% something.

[03:34] How can they push that up?

[03:38] So two things.

[03:39] What is how good the lead magnet is?

[03:41] So I know you two people want it but the question is how good is it once they get it?

[03:45] What am I going to do?

[03:46] What is the value of the delivery?

[03:47] They can be more valuable.

[03:48] So you grow an audience by delivering more to them than it costs them to consume it.

[03:53] They make a good trade on their time compared to other trades on their time from other

[03:56] people they can be consuming information from.

[03:58] I mean, fundamentally, they're talking about micro.

[04:00] So if you think about the lead magnet is a microcosm without and that's that.

[04:04] The other obvious one is just the easiest to use a sub-jacat.

[04:09] Are you a sub-jacat?

[04:10] It's not a regular basis for the email flow.

[04:12] I'm not exactly sure because I'm not in charge but you're in marketing.

[04:15] How bad you are not.

[04:17] So yeah, I mean, it's just, so like a lot of the stuff just for everyone is like,

[04:24] I get asked sometimes a lot of questions that can be solved with a test and not like I can

[04:29] tell you the answer.

[04:30] So when we want to figure out pricing we test pricing.

[04:33] You guys saw a fuck up yesterday from it, right?

[04:35] So like we test pricing.

[04:39] That's how we do things.

[04:40] Like we just try it out and we see it.

[04:42] And so we do the same thing.

[04:43] We just like see if this headline works better and then we see like we run tests

[04:48] constantly.

[04:49] And now I would say that's probably one of the things that is worked really well for us.

[04:53] And what I would warn you against is like because you're on the like if there's a pendulum of testing, right?

[04:58] There's like we test everything all the time and there's like we haven't tested things, what's a test.

[05:02] Like there's kind of a sweet spot because whenever you do test,

[05:06] there's a cost of testing which is guaranteed.

[05:09] We have a cost of change.

[05:10] Like you have messups that happen, right?

[05:13] And so those are guaranteed but the upside of the test isn't guaranteed.

[05:17] And so you want to make sure that the tests that you're doing are worked with.

[05:22] And so the cost of the test,

[05:24] I'm going to split, you know, split tests on a subject.

[05:26] I guess probably not that much.

[05:27] If you want to test a change in your offer, it costs more.

[05:31] You got to reach from the team, you got to reach from the film it.

[05:33] There's more things that have to happen.

[05:34] So there's kind of like low cost tests and high cost tests.

[05:38] And not all high cost tests are going to have high up.

[05:42] And sometimes low cost tests have massive output.

[05:44] And so you want to kind of order these from like okay, what is the lowest likely to test that could have the most output?

[05:49] And you just literally order them.

[05:51] You're like, all right, well, let's grab one off of here.

[05:52] We do them in that order.

[05:54] Okay, sounds.

[05:55] So we literally have a big list.

[05:57] It's like Alex, he is.

[06:00] Where do I find them?

[06:01] No, for myself, right?

[06:02] And so we, so I, because so this is to your ADD question that you had earlier.

[06:06] Like I highly recommend doing this.

[06:09] It took me a long time to learn for like for Lailinite to figure out this dynamic.

[06:13] We said, I had about one new idea for our business per day.

[06:17] And Lail was like, we can do like one a quarter.

[06:19] And oh, I said, well, what do I do with all these extras?

[06:22] And so I would just bottle them up and just go nuts, right?

[06:24] So instead, I did two things.

[06:26] One is that I started making content to get ideas out,

[06:29] get my creative juices out.

[06:31] So it's kind of an outlet.

[06:32] So you guys are like the product of creative outlets for me.

[06:35] And the other thing is having my big list of ideas.

[06:38] And it's literally called Alex's big list of ideas.

[06:40] And I just have this mass, because you're losing it.

[06:43] So you write it down.

[06:44] And then actually, what's the good of an idea?

[06:47] But I was about to change the whole company.

[06:48] And now I, I think, think it's fine.

[06:52] And so by having that list, it kind of gives you a little bit of space

[06:57] between them, because you're always emotionally invested

[06:58] in what it's your idea.

[06:59] It's fresh.

[07:00] And so giving it some time to settle,

[07:04] it allows me to look at these and be like,

[07:05] no, even with a month of sleep, this is a good idea.

[07:09] We should test this one.

[07:10] And it's worth the cost.

[07:12] And so that's how I get some of that creative juice out.

[07:14] And I make sure that the test we have with the high-ceter.

[07:16] So in regards to email marketing,

[07:18] you just think of a nice fancy title.

[07:21] And then you just write it down, hands deep some days.

[07:24] So obviously, the first thing I would do

[07:27] is just Google, like split test headlines first.

[07:30] OK.

[07:31] Yeah.

[07:31] And then you'd have probably, you could probably find like 500,

[07:34] and be like, OK, which of these applied in my name?

[07:36] All right, perfect.

[07:37] Thank you.

[07:37] You got box.

[07:39] Yes, sir.

[07:39] Amen.

[07:40] Yes, hello.

[07:41] I have a SaaS company.

[07:42] It's a newcomers, a moment platform that

[07:45] specialized in dropshaving fulfillment.

[07:46] Or we have super, super high-churn.

[07:49] Other than 3%.

[07:50] Because a month, yeah.

[07:52] Because 99% of our traffic is a new business.

[07:55] They're trying to start and you accomplish as this.

[07:58] You've done surveying, market research.

[08:00] I'm going to make your day to keep going.

[08:02] OK.

[08:03] Their issue is they need to find

[08:05] which products they want to sell and drive

[08:06] probable traffic.

[08:07] I just can't forget how to operationalize that.

[08:09] Yeah.

[08:09] So you have something called structural turn,

[08:12] which is something to not lose sleepover.

[08:14] OK.

[08:14] Thank you.

[08:15] Like Shopify has more turn than you do.

[08:17] So it's just the nature of getting into the BSMB space.

[08:21] So BSMB's various models, it's a SMB, mid-market,

[08:24] and you go up-der-prize.

[08:26] But you're in the BSMB space, which is almost the same as

[08:28] the SMB's.

[08:29] It's just the game.

[08:30] Yeah.

[08:30] But the good news is there's a gazillion of them.

[08:32] And so that's the trade.

[08:34] It's an infinite market almost.

[08:35] Yeah.

[08:35] And so if you think about a Shopify business model,

[08:37] it's like, I mean, it's in your space.

[08:40] Is that they have a very small fee for people to start,

[08:43] and then they get their upside from payments

[08:45] for the people who self-select as the highest and best users.

[08:50] And so they make money on people who make no money.

[08:52] And then once those people make a lot of money,

[08:53] they make more money with them.

[08:54] And so it's kind of like a dual-sided monetization structure.

[08:57] And so that might be something that I would explore.

[09:00] Yeah, we're looking into payments.

[09:02] But I'm trying to feel like I thought that was the constraint

[09:04] of my business, but churn.

[09:06] Yeah.

[09:09] I mean, 3% a month for BSMB's not bad.

[09:12] 33%.

[09:12] Oh, 33.

[09:14] Yeah.

[09:14] Yeah, that's worse than 3.

[09:16] Yeah.

[09:17] Super high.

[09:18] It's 11 times worse than 3.

[09:20] I was like, dude, you're doing fine.

[09:22] I was like, I'm making your dad.

[09:24] You're not a loved one.

[09:25] You're doing great.

[09:26] Yeah, I got him.

[09:28] Yeah, so I'll bet you can get that probably closer down to 10.

[09:31] Yeah.

[09:32] I would look at what shop I think they're like at 10.

[09:33] But it's high.

[09:35] Yeah.

[09:36] And so everything, so my recommendation, because obviously we have schools

[09:40] in the BSMB world, is you want to think about

[09:44] and product through elimination rather than addition.

[09:47] So how can I eliminate things from the product that people

[09:49] are using?

[09:50] Like the number one reason people can't so it's

[09:52] overwhelming.

[09:53] They get distracted.

[09:54] Overwhelmed.

[09:55] There's too many things they don't want to do.

[09:56] And so it's really trying to pull this goes for service too.

[09:59] Trying to pull as many things out.

[10:01] And like you can introduce things later that they don't necessarily need yet.

[10:05] So it's really just thinking, what is the one thing I need them to do right now?

[10:09] And then until they do that, I'm not going to show them something else.

[10:12] And then once they have done that, I will show them the next thing to do.

[10:14] It's just trying to keep as little friction as simply possible.

[10:18] And that like the 100 Golden Babies.

[10:19] It's no, there's no silver bullet.

[10:21] It's just looking at right now.

[10:22] Like you probably have it, you guys hopefully on the team.

[10:25] They can run like a regression analysis on the cohorts.

[10:29] And so if you do no track activation, what's our?

[10:31] Yeah, we know the Golden Babies.

[10:33] Okay.

[10:34] Well then just, I mean, literally all resources go towards that thing.

[10:37] Like if that is the constraint of the business, then I don't care about getting

[10:41] new members.

[10:42] I mean, like I care about that in so far as we need to test the cohorts out to make

[10:44] sure that it's working.

[10:46] But I'm not doing any growth initiatives.

[10:47] I'm not doing any new features.

[10:50] The thing that we're focused on is how do we get more people to that activation

[10:53] point?

[10:54] And I don't care about anything else.

[10:55] That's it.

[10:56] And so if the activation point is right, then turn will go down.

[11:00] If the activation point that you have is wrong, then you have to find what it really

[11:03] is.

[11:04] Yeah.

[11:05] Good I Alex, how you doing?

[11:06] Hello.

[11:07] My name is Josh.

[11:08] I'm a business in Australia.

[11:09] And we help universities.

[11:10] Australia.

[11:11] Australia.

[11:12] And we help universities or universities in Australia.

[11:15] Keep the students and keep them happy so that I don't drop out.

[11:18] So you'll call each video.

[11:19] You'll be applicable to us.

[11:20] I think the Australian government was listening to you because they introduced a policy

[11:24] this year.

[11:25] I know.

[11:26] I came to get a lot of new business.

[11:27] I know.

[11:28] They introduced a policy where Australian UNEs to receive funding have to dramatically

[11:32] increase the amount of low socioeconomic students, the one that benefits most from

[11:36] the UNI, which is cool.

[11:38] And then they released a policy that said, for essentially $60 million of student funding

[11:43] has to go to club societies for attorneys to support their students.

[11:47] So eight years ago, I started a bit.

[11:49] Business on the premise that UNI should really invest in supporting students because it keeps

[11:53] their customers there and that's what the UNI's angry with the students.

[11:56] So I have a woman in a $60 million red dress.

[11:59] OK.

[12:00] And my question is, normally I'm selling to a student engagement professional.

[12:05] Is that first professional job?

[12:06] Now I'm selling to their bosses boss.

[12:09] So I have a value equation, basically, for student retention that we've created this instrument,

[12:15] which shows them why students drop out, where the drop out rates are, benchmarks are, exactly

[12:19] what to do.

[12:20] And then our training solutions are the answer to that.

[12:24] But I've spent eight years selling training solutions, not data and analysis.

[12:29] I'm not used to selling to the CEO.

[12:30] I'm used to selling to their bosses.

[12:31] They just want to say, please.

[12:32] Say again.

[12:33] They just want to do that.

[12:34] They just want to do that.

[12:35] The higher up you go, just for everybody.

[12:36] Enterprise sales, the more the person makes, the more they don't care about the narrative.

[12:41] Yeah.

[12:42] That's just been my experience.

[12:43] Now, of course, story sell and there's things like, you want to have a metonarrative,

[12:46] if you want to feel like.

[12:48] Until you show them the math behind it, which is like, what is your return?

[12:51] Yes.

[12:52] And that's what they want.

[12:53] So my problem was, my turn.

[12:55] I'd lose maybe 20% per year.

[12:56] The ones who'd hire me for training, the students would go, it's best training

[12:59] and they've been to it's amazing.

[13:00] But they wouldn't be able to tell their boss or their bosses boss to the data to prove

[13:03] that it was good for retention.

[13:04] Well, you have to track it.

[13:05] You have to track it.

[13:07] But they would never give me that data.

[13:08] So I couldn't ultimately prove it.

[13:09] To make it contingent, like you have to do it.

[13:11] You have to do it.

[13:12] You have to do it.

[13:13] In order to work with us, like, we've a proprietary technology.

[13:16] It feeds off of data.

[13:18] And in order for us to make your product or solution better, we have to get this data.

[13:21] So we can implement it in real time.

[13:22] And so right now, we're going to start with vanilla version.

[13:24] Yeah.

[13:24] But in two years, this is going to be the super tailored version to your university.

[13:28] So we know that all universities benefit from these five things.

[13:31] But there's usually five to 10 other things that we will learn from this data.

[13:34] So you have to do it.

[13:35] So if you're the three things that we'll do to make it easier for you to actually get

[13:38] this data back to us, so we can help you make more money.

[13:40] Yeah.

[13:41] You guys can one quick follow up on that?

[13:43] The tool that we do that now is a $30,000 product per year on subscription that

[13:48] universities have started to buy before that, our LTV of training was $34,000.

[13:54] So the tool that justifies the $34,000 training is worth $30,000.

[13:59] Sure.

[14:00] So that's what I'm wondering, do I focus more on selling that and then sell it?

[14:04] I'm just saying it comes with these two.

[14:06] It comes with the training.

[14:07] Sure.

[14:08] And pivot towards that?

[14:09] Yeah.

[14:10] I mean, fundamentally, like, those are components.

[14:12] I don't even see them as that important.

[14:14] The only thing that matters to them is the likelihood that they get their customers to

[14:19] stay and pay longer and renew after year after year.

[14:23] And so how we get there matters just really little.

[14:26] And you know this from the sales side.

[14:27] I think you're just into weeds right now because you're, you know, you're out to burn.

[14:31] How do I know in your hair?

[14:32] But like, if you're a customer, I don't care if we're going to be doing keto or cutting

[14:36] my calories.

[14:37] I just want to be able to fit into my high school joints.

[14:39] Yeah.

[14:40] So just tell me how I'm going to be.

[14:42] That's a cool math.

[14:43] Appreciate you.

[14:43] Hey, but I'm a brick and mortar franchise owner.

[14:46] So my own five indoor golf simulator locations across the country.

[14:51] Well, I've got FDDs in place to scale up to 12.

[14:55] Are you franchise or a franchisee?

[14:56] French, I see.

[14:57] Okay, got it.

[14:58] So one of the constraints that I experienced every year is predominantly a seasonal business.

[15:06] So when they started in the Midwest and when it's cold and people can't get out to the golf

[15:10] courses, they come indoors and play.

[15:13] But the constraint is, and the summertime, my utilization just drops right off the table.

[15:19] And I'm trying to push forward based on some information I got from customers about what

[15:25] they really like about the place.

[15:26] It's like, you know, time to play a game as much shorter indoors.

[15:30] The weather's always consistent.

[15:32] A lot of things like that.

[15:33] And I'm trying to push my branding in that direction so I can address some of that low

[15:38] utilization in the off season.

[15:40] Do you have any ideas that you could offer on that?

[15:42] Yeah, I mean, obviously I'm here in Vegas and I would be like, what to do 18 and under 30 minutes

[15:47] and it'd be our condition with a drink and a like, I mean, you could sell me.

[15:52] Like, yeah, I just like air conditioning in general.

[15:55] But, but yeah, I mean, I think that's the, because I was thinking, it's like, all right,

[15:59] cause a lot like long care guys have the same issue, right?

[16:01] It's like when it's the winter for them is the opposite issues.

[16:04] Like, so then they have to get into snow plowing.

[16:06] They call it the onseason and offseason, or by the way, you're in a seasonal business.

[16:09] They don't call it the offseason, because everyone's going to treat it like the offseason.

[16:12] I should just lose money all the time.

[16:14] But I think that, I think that that perspective makes sense.

[16:19] Like, the benefits of indoor now, I would bet that the places where it's hottest in the summer

[16:24] might benefit the most from that.

[16:27] It's like, get out of the summer heat.

[16:29] And like, cause you have a time component and you have a comfort component, which actually

[16:33] think are pretty strong.

[16:34] And so I would just be leading with those.

[16:36] Mix everyone faster and everyone sings to be easier.

[16:39] And so you do both.

[16:40] So just focus my branding and sales in that direction.

[16:44] Yeah.

[16:44] Thank you, sure.

[16:45] Yeah.

[16:45] And I was, instead of brand new, just say it's the messaging.

[16:47] Yeah, just from a donation.

[16:49] Yeah.

[16:50] I'm milly.

[16:51] I run a math tutoring company with my partner Christian.

[16:54] Oh, what, what training company?

[16:55] Math tutoring.

[16:56] Math to, yes.

[16:57] Right, exactly.

[16:58] So right now, we're really, really small.

[17:02] Our office good, our sales process is good.

[17:04] We know that we just need to do more of it, which is fine.

[17:06] And we're hiring people to help us with the sales and the fulfillment.

[17:10] What I want to know is, do you feel a brand where all of your employees seem to have

[17:15] that same?

[17:16] Let's get shot done, attitude as you do.

[17:19] How do you instill that within your team so that they know, like, let's get this done?

[17:25] You get rid of people who don't have that.

[17:28] Okay.

[17:29] And then don't leave people who are left or people who are that.

[17:32] And then when you bring someone else who's new and they're like, oh, maybe have it.

[17:34] You're like, I think you're right.

[17:35] We let them go.

[17:36] Yeah.

[17:37] It's the hard thing.

[17:39] It's like that girl that's back home that you know that isn't that good.

[17:43] You need to let her go.

[17:44] And then you have to do more interviews.

[17:46] And then pick somebody and probably be wrong and do it again until eventually build the

[17:50] culture based on those values.

[17:53] And you just want to get the buses again.

[17:54] Because fundamentally, if you're scaling service, you're scaling culture and training.

[17:58] If you're scaling service business.

[18:00] So it's going to be those values and how good you are at giving someone base skills.

[18:05] And so if you think about really in any kind of role, how vague you can be with your

[18:12] directives is directly proportional to how skilled someone isn't giving them.

[18:15] And so if you have people that you're like, I literally have to tell her to turn on the

[18:19] computer, this person has such low base skills.

[18:22] I think that you can teach anyone anything.

[18:24] I do fundamentally believe that.

[18:25] The question is just as a business center as it worth it.

[18:28] So it's like, I do think I could change you from being inconsistent.

[18:31] It's too consistent.

[18:32] It's just how long will that take me and are there other people who I can get better

[18:35] returns on my time with.

[18:37] And so fundamentally, you just think about it like that.

[18:38] It's how much training will I have to introduce to this person.

[18:41] Now, if you have a service business that's as small as your brick and mortar, don't mind.

[18:45] Well, regardless, your business is going to be also like the training bonus if you have

[18:50] culture.

[18:51] The culture is what you choose to tolerate internally.

[18:54] But the training is how good you're going to teach math.

[18:56] You're to think about how good you are teaching people to teach math and teaching

[18:59] people to do every other skill that's associated with teaching math.

[19:02] Because I'll bet you there's plenty of people who are decent at math who suck at teaching

[19:05] math and there's even worse at talking to people.

[19:09] So sometimes you might have to do a little bit of daily cardio, which is like, okay,

[19:11] so when someone walks in and you breathe in with a smile, here's how you create people.

[19:15] I'm dead-sipers.

[19:16] Like, there's a recent Chick-fil-A if you're here in the States, is what it is.

[19:20] It's like they teach people how to people.

[19:21] You can.

[19:22] Yeah, also.

[19:23] Thank you.

[19:24] But that's going to be the different year.

[19:26] That's what's going to take you to the next level.

[19:28] So I want to medical spa with my wife.

[19:31] And so love meds boss.

[19:33] We offer a ton of services and aging services.

[19:37] The most popular ones are the least profitable ones.

[19:42] So trying to determine strategy should we market the ones that are most popular, try

[19:47] to get people in more and then look to upsell.

[19:51] Because the higher margin ones, you're talking like a 10 to 15x difference in revenue.

[19:57] So I'm just trying to determine, do we market more general, come on in, give you a year

[20:03] plan or just market the baseline one, come in and then just try to upsell it.

[20:08] This is a great question.

[20:09] It probably affects a lot of people here.

[20:12] It is a math question.

[20:14] So you can solve this and actually know what the right answer is.

[20:16] And so I'll just give you an example.

[20:18] So let's say Botox people come in for.

[20:22] For example.

[20:23] All right.

[20:24] So how much Botox costs?

[20:25] What's the gross profit of Botox?

[20:26] So if we factor in all of our fixed costs, 58,000, which would be good.

[20:30] Okay.

[20:31] So you make 58 bucks per Botox.

[20:33] So what does the cost get somebody in the door?

[20:36] Right now, our package is two.

[20:38] Okay.

[20:39] Two.

[20:40] Two.

[20:41] Great.

[20:42] Now, what percentage of these people can you sell into ice, you know, the cool sculpting,

[20:47] or whatever else?

[20:48] 40% of the, well, and what's the average ticket of the thing they buy?

[20:55] Are gross profit of the thing they buy afterwards?

[20:58] Okay.

[20:59] So whatever this is, that's a 40520.

[21:03] So 520 plus 58.

[21:06] So this time's us, right?

[21:08] Is 578.

[21:10] Okay.

[21:11] So this is path 1.

[21:14] Now, if you market straight for this thing, what's cat?

[21:20] Just overall, I don't know, individual, but it's satisfying to go to all of these two.

[21:30] Okay.

[21:31] So if you basically said to answer the question, you just promote this up, see what cat is.

[21:37] And so here, if you've got 202 to 578, you're like, just, you know,

[21:42] you're like, just under 3 to 1, right?

[21:44] And so you're feeling right now, I'm guessing.

[21:46] You're like, I just need this to be bigger, right?

[21:49] And so, I think this upsell efficiency is pretty good, give me honest with you.

[21:54] Now, this, you might be able to work on, because I would bet that this can get expanded like five or six thousand.

[22:00] And then that would probably make all the difference in the world.

[22:02] And so in terms of medspas that I, that we like, because we did, I really like medspas stuff.

[22:08] And so it's like, alright, let's just buy a chain and then you can get stuff for free to save me.

[22:11] But anyway, so, but I think, I think this actually probably where the deficiency is actually don't know if it's like 200 bucks is fine.

[22:23] Especially like, that's what it costs to get to me for a gym membership and like, you know, right?

[22:27] Like, and that's a way lower LTV than this.

[22:30] So this actually feels like this actually feels like a problem, is that, and the conversions, okay,

[22:35] I think you might just need to see if you can sell bigger bundles.

[22:38] And you might want to consider GF financing.

[22:41] Yes.

[22:42] So if they're part third party or in house.

[22:44] Okay, then you might, I think you just need it.

[22:47] I think you probably need it, because so you probably have a sales process, you.

[22:51] In terms of how you're offering the main thing.

[22:53] And so I would consider, wait till the next book comes out, you're going to love it.

[22:57] Doing something called as a menu close.

[22:59] And so, you sell the vacation and like, okay, if you were to look like a goddess, these are all the things you need.

[23:05] And then everything they cross off, they just look uglier and older.

[23:08] And so they're like, it's like, okay, just look a little bit ugly or a little older.

[23:11] We can cross that off the no worries.

[23:13] Right?

[23:14] Okay. And so, and so you can start there though.

[23:17] It's just like, okay, because I'd rather start an ideal and then just try and figure out a way to make it work with their budget,

[23:22] then try and just get a sale.

[23:24] That makes sense.

[23:25] So I'm going to bet that this is the problem.

[23:28] If you want, you could try and market this directly.

[23:31] And then you'd have, I guess, 100% of people that would go into this.

[23:34] Because if you go to a choir customers, let's say, let's say you choir these people for $300,

[23:40] then you would make more sense to market that as the front end.

[23:43] My guess though is that you just need to choose this guy.

[23:46] Because this is fine.

[23:48] Yeah, you bet.

[23:50] I mean, I've heard of some men's boss named 200 bucks a lead.

[23:52] So, so you think you're delivering a cube as an example and that was a big calculation.

[23:57] When you're thinking about modifying components of your awkward that are maybe fairly fulfilling and tested,

[24:03] or you have media, you need to import or key members.

[24:07] How are you massaging that?

[24:09] Or how are you thinking about this problem?

[24:12] Knowing that, okay, I can't have the unit of right key members.

[24:15] I want to increase the TV, my customers, my customers really like this thing.

[24:19] So, big like, what are lots of more children watching?

[24:23] Yeah, so whenever you get into key men, risk in general and spare everybody,

[24:27] you, it's what makes things rare is combinations.

[24:31] So, it makes them commoditizes breaking into chunks.

[24:35] And so, if someone's an exceptional painter, it's because they can combine collar and movement and whatever,

[24:42] you know, like, I don't know painting, but I'm sure there's other components of painting.

[24:46] And so, within the support component, there's probably three or four things that this person does very well,

[24:51] and so you just chunk it down.

[24:53] I was kind of like the example I gave you yesterday is like, how do you replace Alex in this business for delivery?

[24:57] Like, I always came in.

[24:58] I was in an expectancy to be better at being Alex than me.

[25:02] So, I was like, but I can find somebody who's really good at phone sales.

[25:05] It's really good at phone sales, and they're just as good as I am.

[25:07] Now, they're not going to be also as good at retention and strategy and ads,

[25:11] but they can be just as good at that.

[25:13] And then I find somebody else who's really good at ads.

[25:15] He's just as good as me at ads. He's just not a good at all the other stuff.

[25:18] And so, fundamentally, when you scale on a company, that is how you replace came at risk.

[25:21] It's chopping the unit, cords, horn, off and saying, okay, I can find a rhinoceros.

[25:24] And then you're like, okay, now I just need a horse.

[25:26] And I need some fireflies to get the glitter.

[25:29] And there we go.

[25:30] It took three people to replace my unicorn with things that are more readily available.

[25:34] And so, you just chunk down what the skills that there's one person has into component parts.

[25:39] And then you can teach those component parts much more easily.

[25:42] So, it takes them mysticism out of it.

[25:44] Does that make sense?

[25:45] Yeah, I was thinking in terms of the, so let's say you have like zoom community or management.

[25:50] Sure.

[25:51] Sure.

[25:52] Okay, it's the parts out in the unicorn.

[25:54] But we need to eventually scale the load of purposes.

[25:57] Well, they can talk about neol, it's maybe moving people on his mind.

[26:00] We are using those between more or less things instead of one or two of the interaction.

[26:05] There's something wrong on this side.

[26:07] So, more of the, so, is it changing the offer from 101 to somewhere private?

[26:11] This is not my private already, but there's times to be a time intensive.

[26:14] We're running a like reviewing specific case sentence events.

[26:18] So, either, so here's, okay, so I'm going to, I will tell you story to answer hopefully answer your question.

[26:27] So, I had, so my first ever gym model, I tweaked a couple times and then I got it right.

[26:34] And I had this setup where people would do six weeks, weight loss and kind of like more high intensity training.

[26:40] There's a point to this.

[26:41] And six weeks of like weights to tone.

[26:44] So it was like burn and tone.

[26:47] I, this is commercialized for mass market for those of you who are in the fitness space, just breathe.

[26:52] All right.

[26:53] And so, what end of happening is that my sessions got so full that I was like shoot, I should change how I'm doing delivery

[27:00] because I can't fit anymore people in my gym, which was the wrong solution.

[27:04] I had found something that everyone actually fucking liked.

[27:07] And so, what I should have done was just more of that.

[27:10] And so, you're in a situation where like how do I scale delivery more?

[27:13] I don't think your delivery is unscalable.

[27:15] You just need more people to do that thing that people like.

[27:17] And so, either do you have margin to support it?

[27:21] I could probably swing that in terms of just re-locating some of our expenses.

[27:28] Well, if the answer is not really, then it's a, your mispriced.

[27:33] Not necessarily need to change what you're, like so basically.

[27:35] So basically, you're working in a charge mortage in the retail TV and continue to serve yourself.

[27:39] Yeah.

[27:41] Yes, I will say it's harder to find something that everyone really likes than it is to just change the price.

[27:48] So, if you have something that everyone really loves, then you can probably can support a price change.

[27:54] And so, I want to make sure you're solving the right problem.

[27:58] Like sure, you can go from somewhere private to group, but that might lose all of the value.

[28:03] And if you charge the same thing, now you have your price-developed ascrapancies out of whack.

[28:07] So what I did, this was the mistake, is I took my sessions and I shortened them, so I could fit more sessions in.

[28:13] And by doing that, I destroyed the thing that worked.

[28:16] So don't do that.

[28:19] Product market fit is much harder to find than pricing.

[28:22] Next one.

[28:24] That hopefully applied to somebody else here.

[28:26] So, do you go over a lot of your successes?

[28:29] And failures?

[28:31] And failures, go ahead.

[28:34] Yeah, and so my question is more about your protecting your mental health and your ability to get extreme emotions,

[28:41] because I've gone through what my success in acquisition in the last few years.

[28:45] No.

[28:46] I just never been moments to walk.

[28:47] In the community, I'm here.

[28:49] Okay.

[28:50] I just hate getting resources and connections.

[28:52] I'm just wondering how do you handle when you have those major losses, when you've lost everything,

[28:58] or when you've had that failure, these two in the case, and also in the future, if you're a few of them acquisition

[29:04] has a possibility.

[29:05] Sure.

[29:06] And how do you protect yourself?

[29:07] So I will not spend a long time on this, because it gets into a very heavy chunked up version of reality,

[29:15] which is just like I believe that when I die within six months, no one will give a shit.

[29:22] And so the fact that no one will care, six months after I am dead, for the most significant life event that I have, which is that I have no longer alive,

[29:30] it makes a lot of the other stuff not matter that much.

[29:33] And so I also know that when I was poor and I had nothing, I was about as happy as I am now.

[29:39] And so if I was just as happy that as I am now, then I could go all the way back there and basically be in the same thing.

[29:46] And I think in some ways when I really play it out, I get just as excited about the idea of having the comeback story.

[29:51] Now I'm going to try to not do that.

[29:53] But if I did it, I would get into the state that I think that I would be like, this is going to be my thing.

[29:58] And so like a lot of times the fears we have are catastrophized.

[30:03] And so I want to have this, like of the many list of books, I have this big document of like Alex's list of books that he will summon you, right?

[30:11] But one of them is played out.

[30:13] And so a thing that I say a lot on quarterlys and strategic, it's like, let's play it out.

[30:19] Like what happens next? What happens next? What happens next? And so like what actually happens next is not that bad.

[30:24] It's just the idea of it that seems very bad.

[30:27] I mean, Layla has this quote that's the fear is a mile wide and inch deep.

[30:30] It's like you take a step on to it and you're like, oh, this is not a big of a deal.

[30:33] Like the worst cases I would move back with my print.

[30:35] Why actually, you know, I kind of like my parents and you know,

[30:37] at home cook meals not so bad.

[30:39] You know, I'm only going to see them for 10 more years before they're just older shit anyways.

[30:43] So, you know, it could be a blessing in the skies.

[30:46] And like there's a lot of research that's been done on like people who become paralyzed.

[30:50] And within like three to six months, they returned to the exact same baseline of subject to well being as they were when they had all their limbs.

[30:58] And so as much as that's a terrible thing that could occur,

[31:01] losing money is probably a lot less bad than losing limbs.

[31:05] And if they happened to them and they're just about as happy now as they were six months earlier,

[31:10] I just genuinely like Layla and I are sitting on opposite poles like I struggle to care.

[31:15] She cares so much.

[31:17] And that's how we end in you in business.

[31:19] Is that she'll get stressed and I'll be like, we can die, no one will care.

[31:23] And like when you zoom out, you're like, oh, there's the world.

[31:27] And like I'm a monkey, you own a little thing.

[31:29] Again, this is a world view thing.

[31:30] Some people don't agree with this and I had a vet people get really upset about it.

[31:33] So that's how I deal with it.

[31:35] And so for me, I just don't have really big stakes because I just don't think anyone cares.

[31:39] That's all.

[31:41] Like the idea that everyone is watching, it just isn't.

[31:43] I run them to be.

[31:45] Okay.

[31:47] Our USP is single-bees-it-full-mouth without.

[31:51] Okay, so like, veneers and all that.

[31:53] Yeah, got it. Okay.

[31:55] Cool.

[31:56] But it's a single transaction and I'm not sure if that's my empty-beat server.

[31:59] Okay.

[32:00] Why would I run the new transaction?

[32:01] Okay.

[32:02] I understood what I have to do to see yesterday in the ring field of this morning.

[32:06] Yeah.

[32:07] I have to understand from you, you cannot bite me on.

[32:10] Do I have to do a big-sum option of there?

[32:12] No.

[32:13] No.

[32:14] So think about it this way.

[32:15] So one of the first jobs I had was at a fur coat dealer.

[32:19] And so you were selling fur coats.

[32:21] So once you're now in mind, you can sell more than one coat.

[32:23] You can't sell more than one mouth.

[32:24] But you probably can't every 10 years, but let's not get into that.

[32:27] So what he realized, because he was fourth generation.

[32:31] So they had to figure out the business model over more than 100 years.

[32:35] Was that he invented summer storage.

[32:38] And so the idea was, okay, how do we get these people who bought these $5,000 jackets to come back?

[32:43] Because a big $5,000 coat for the average consumer that was buying.

[32:47] It's actually an aspirational purchase.

[32:48] So a lot of people think luxury is only for rich people, but 90% of buyers are actually poor people who want to look rich.

[32:53] Fun fact.

[32:56] And so what they found out was, well, if we get people to come back regularly for other stuff,

[33:01] they're more likely to buy more frequently.

[33:03] And so what you need is insurance.

[33:06] So when someone buys something very expensive, what you do is you charge 5% to 10% of the total purchase price for insurance.

[33:13] Now I say insurance with quotes here, but like, it's hey, you spent 20 grand on your mouth.

[33:17] I spent a thousand bucks here to keep it.

[33:19] Right?

[33:20] Yeah, to keep it look nice, because I can double how long these teeth are going to last if you go into our maintenance program.

[33:27] And then you have this long term care, literally probably we call it long term care.

[33:32] Four year mouth.

[33:33] And then that way you can extend the ROI on the investment that you made.

[33:36] We think it's better if I go into after the single sale between after.

[33:43] So sell the 20, then they have the mirror in front of them.

[33:46] And they're like, oh my god, and you're like, right, you don't want this to go away, because this could go away.

[33:50] And only for 5% of the thing you just like 1,000 bucks a year, we'll keep it looking nice.

[33:55] And they just spent 20, they're not going to give it shit.

[33:57] It's like whatever.

[33:59] You better do that, man.

[34:00] We are in the position where we have a couple of offers on a table two eggs.

[34:05] Cool.

[34:06] Couple of allies.

[34:07] It's life changing money, but we believe that we stuck around for two and three more years.

[34:13] It could be like extra late changing money.

[34:16] Sure.

[34:17] So how would you look at this decision and decide when is the right time to exit?

[34:21] One of the hardest decisions in business.

[34:24] It's a very personal question and it comes down.

[34:26] And the nice thing is that you have all of the information to make the decision.

[34:31] So on one hand, you have your personal goals, which is like, this is the amount of money that I said I would be willing to part ways with this as why I started whatever.

[34:40] On the other hand, you also understand how reliable your business is.

[34:44] If you feel like the business has a good leadership to me in place, you have plenty of room to expand in the market.

[34:50] The infrastructure is secure.

[34:52] The revenue that you keep.

[34:53] You have high revenue.

[34:55] What's your revenue retention annually?

[34:57] So our revenue is about six point one this year and our EBITDA is around 2.3.

[35:06] What's revenue retention?

[35:07] What percentage of that revenue came from the year before?

[35:09] It's all first one time sales.

[35:11] Don't have read or occurring, or recurring, which is one of the things that we had in the make-up.

[35:18] Yeah, so you're in like the devil's gambit right now.

[35:22] And so like you're getting an offer, which is great, on something that could also be gone tomorrow with an ad account shut down or whatever.

[35:32] I don't know how you get customer experience, but I'm just assuming.

[35:34] Is it ads?

[35:35] Yeah.

[35:36] Okay.

[35:37] And so like this is a purely risk.

[35:41] This is a risk assessment.

[35:44] If you were like for sure we're going to be able to grow, then don't stop.

[35:49] If you're like, I don't know if we're going to grow from here, then stop.

[35:53] And so like only you can know that.

[35:57] And let's say the second question one B, and this is a really big one that I think is underrated, is what are you going to do after?

[36:04] And so I have friends who have exited, and there's basically like two camps.

[36:09] There's exit and don't have a plan and exit and no exact what you're going to do.

[36:13] And these guys, huge massive crisis of meaning.

[36:17] These guys, they just get right back to work.

[36:21] And having looked at both of those, like the day after I sold Jim launch, started acquisition and like literally the next day.

[36:27] And I'm very happy that I did that.

[36:32] I think having a lot of time and a lot of money and nothing to do, bad combo for entrepreneurs.

[36:38] Personal opinion.

[36:40] So if you are going to sell, have a very clear idea what you're going to do next.

[36:45] Then, no, that's, I mean this is real.

[36:49] This is like a real life decision.

[36:51] And so I don't know what the life changing money that they're offering is.

[36:55] If someone's offering 10 times bottom line for something that has one time transactions and it's all cash, like terms of the deal matter.

[37:01] It's all cash you can walk away.

[37:04] Then yeah, maybe not a bad deal.

[37:06] If it's, you know, seller finance, you can sell it back for, you know, a year or two years.

[37:11] And they're buying, you know, 51% that you're expected to work for the next half of many years.

[37:16] Then you basically have a job either way.

[37:18] In which case, you're like, like, okay, this is the frame you can think of.

[37:23] How will my daily behavior change?

[37:26] If what you do every day doesn't change, then why sell it?

[37:31] Which is why for me, the terms of my sale were like, I will stop working the day I get this check.

[37:36] And if you can't do that, then I will not sign a deal.

[37:39] Yeah, ours is like we're out of, once we sign.

[37:44] Okay.

[37:45] Whether it's options, sure.

[37:47] It's like, it's already the money I've run a little bit of sell if I ain't seen more than they're now.

[37:52] Yeah.

[37:53] Well, yeah.

[37:54] So I mean, this is a purely personal decision.

[37:57] I won't take too much more time on it, but like, it's a risk decision.

[38:00] Which risk is purely personal.

[38:03] It's like, do you want to put it on Bitcoin? You could.

[38:05] It's just purely personal.

[38:07] Can't you just tell us the selling?

[38:09] Yeah.

[38:16] You know, sometimes it's like you flip the coin and then you, what it's in the air, you decide what you want to do.

[38:21] I think it's a tab way to make decisions, but it works for some people.

[38:25] But no, I, I deliberated about this. Actually, on my YouTube channel, I have a 46 minute video that has like seven views on it.

[38:32] Because it's the entire decision making process around why I sold.

[38:36] And it's like two years ago, maybe three years ago.

[38:39] It's a really long video like,

[38:41] You watch that and that's how we got that on our first time.

[38:46] Well, good. I'm glad it's served you.

[38:48] But now you got a much better offer.

[38:50] So it just comes down to how risky is it that, because the thing is,

[38:54] businesses, and this is when you can write down, businesses will always go up in value until the day they don't and then they're worth nothing.

[39:01] So, business that grows will always be worth more, even a business that maintains is worth more the track record they've been consistent.

[39:08] But the day the business goes down, no one touches it.

[39:12] So that's the, that's the knife set.

[39:15] Longer you keep it more valuable, it is.

[39:18] I think it's a very good way to do that.

[39:21] But I think it's a very good way to do that.

[39:24] But I think it's a very good way to do that.

[39:27] But I think it's a very good way to do that.

[39:30] But I think it's a very good way to do that.

[39:33] But I think it's a very good way to do that.

[39:36] But I think it's a very good way to do that.

[39:39] But I think it's a very good way to do that.

[39:41] But I think it's a very good way to do that.

[39:44] We are, I guess another dessert, we are a cash flow and exchange dish.

[39:48] Contrained.

[39:49] Yeah.

[39:50] So, I'm what point, I guess, do you put it all together?

[39:55] What do you think is the better route to go if you have to do one or the other?

[39:59] Is it the one that the attorney train to serve any both or six month endeavors?

[40:04] If I was guessing.

[40:06] Recruitment train, top talent for Bill and in-house marketing.

[40:11] Was it a good one?

[40:16] So, I would, because you have a small team.

[40:21] You have six people, right?

[40:23] So, I think that the best from what I see, the law firms that make the most money are exceptional promoters, especially in the transactional space which you're in.

[40:35] And so, I would hire an exceptional agency that has a proven track record and I would study everything they do.

[40:41] Have you read the agency's chapter in the lead's book?

[40:44] Read that chapter.

[40:45] So, it literally does like this is how I learned marketing.

[40:48] So, I go to agencies and I say, hey, and I like agencies most times more than the coaching world because agencies have to produce results or they get fired.

[40:58] And so, I go to agencies ideally once they have, I get from referrals.

[41:03] And then I tell them, I want to steal everything that you have.

[41:07] But I will do it over a longer period of time because it will take me time to learn.

[41:10] And I will compensate you for the difference.

[41:12] So, your normal people probably turn out at, you know, month through or four.

[41:15] It'll probably take me longer than that.

[41:16] So, you'll pay more.

[41:17] I'll pay more there.

[41:18] And then after I do kind of absorb what you're doing, I'll pay you consulting period after that to make sure I can troubleshoot.

[41:25] So, you'll make more LTV than a normal customer.

[41:28] But I'll do that in exchange that I want you to show me what you're doing.

[41:32] So, this is how I've learned every platform.

[41:34] I just pay someone more.

[41:36] Okay, because the agency I have right now is there's no transparency.

[41:40] Right.

[41:41] And that's why, at the onset read the chapter, I literally have a script in there of what you say to the person.

[41:46] And if they say no, then you go to another agency and you read the script again.

[41:50] That's what I do.

[41:52] If I were in your position and I had six employees, I would rather learn it because in order for you to succeed at the level I think you want to succeed at.

[42:01] You've got to know this stuff.

[42:02] Thank you.

[42:03] So, first I just want to say thank you because you made a shit for my money.

[42:06] I just said that we made a lot of money.

[42:08] You're welcome.

[42:09] That could have caused so my last business for the early childhood education, the sheer difference of the startup.

[42:16] All right.

[42:17] I built it from a concept to fully fund it, 30 million dollars.

[42:20] Awesome.

[42:21] And it's failed from just 233 staff people in two months.

[42:25] Awesome.

[42:26] So, and I left it because I made a community decision to eat a bit of another nonprofit, but I was not going to own it.

[42:35] Okay.

[42:36] So I built it for them.

[42:37] We're now I help career women in product.

[42:39] I made them a lot of money.

[42:40] It made them.

[42:41] Okay.

[42:42] So they, so happy.

[42:44] So now I help career women in productized themselves so that they can be kind of so

[42:49] of yours or they start out.

[42:51] Cool.

[42:52] So my question here is around who I talked to this voice.

[42:56] Because for me, I had nine months to take various parts of stakeholders forward together.

[43:02] In concept 18 to village and now I'm in the industry.

[43:07] Yep.

[43:08] Yeah.

[43:09] Doing the flight for the first older age.

[43:10] So my help is how to see exactly to share earlier the temperature that entrepreneurs are comfortable with.

[43:16] Has it hard to get a telearray, especially because of me.

[43:20] Do you feel like you're going too fast or too slow?

[43:22] I think I've gone too slow.

[43:23] And my brain.

[43:25] You know what's weird is that I have.

[43:27] I've yet to meet an entrepreneur who says that they're going too slow.

[43:31] You're the only one.

[43:32] Every other entrepreneur is like I'm going way too fast.

[43:35] Things are tapping so fast around me.

[43:37] I'm joking.

[43:39] No entrepreneur says that.

[43:40] Everyone's like this should have been done seven years ago.

[43:43] Like why is this taking so long?

[43:45] Like I can do this in five seconds.

[43:46] Why is it taking five years?

[43:49] So I think first off it's normal.

[43:51] But let's chunk down a level.

[43:53] What specifically do you feel like is not happening fast enough?

[43:57] So think about it from inputs and outputs.

[44:00] Outputs I don't care about.

[44:01] Outputs outputs occur revenue occurs profit occurs as a result of inputs.

[44:07] And so what inputs are not happening fast enough?

[44:10] So to me it's the equation of cash flow and flows of my money down.

[44:14] So what people have been like, oh I'm this the other person.

[44:17] Sure.

[44:18] Yeah.

[44:19] Yeah.

[44:20] Which I'm required to close my money down.

[44:22] I would prefer to hire someone to like build up sales.

[44:25] But you don't have cash flow yet.

[44:27] Yeah.

[44:28] So when you start.

[44:29] So this okay.

[44:30] So was it was the other thing funded that you did?

[44:32] Yes.

[44:33] Okay.

[44:34] So this is really cool for everybody.

[44:35] It's a great meta concept.

[44:37] So every single business on planet earth

[44:40] encouraged debt from the day it starts.

[44:42] It's just that the nature of the debt is different.

[44:44] So if your bootstrap, you start with leadership debt, management debt,

[44:48] technical debt, you incur all these different types of debt.

[44:51] If you're venture backed, for example, you incur financial debt.

[44:56] But you can spend the money to get the CRM day one.

[44:58] You can spend the money to get the executive team day one.

[45:01] And so you incur less financial debt, less technical debt, less of all these things.

[45:04] But then you got to pay back the financial debt.

[45:06] Or you just slice down the pie and so you have a much more slice.

[45:10] And so whenever you trade, like you have, there's trade off

[45:15] between the types of debt that you choose to incur.

[45:18] And so bootstrap businesses in general take longer to grow because you have the issue that you have right now,

[45:24] just that you have to keep stockpiling.

[45:26] And you usually have to work double time because you have to do today's job and tomorrow's job.

[45:30] In order to generate basically you do two or three jobs to generate the cash flow from the savings of not paying someone else to do that job.

[45:36] To be able to afford to pay the person to do the job.

[45:39] But then levels you up to the next job that you can take over that pays even better.

[45:43] And so that's fundamentally the cycle of a bootstrap entrepreneur.

[45:47] And so I don't think that you are going too slow.

[45:50] It feels slow because you were used to jet packs there were artificial.

[45:54] No, I'm just being real.

[45:55] Like if you're like, I've got 10 million bucks.

[45:57] Let's go.

[45:58] It's a very different starting block, right?

[46:00] Like businesses that I can grow now.

[46:02] I can just fund them to start.

[46:04] And that's where you get real leverage because you get the best of both.

[46:07] Because then you have the capital.

[46:08] You can start like your venture backed, but you're the venture backed company.

[46:11] And so you can start with all the leadership in place.

[46:14] Get all the consultants in so that you can get the text, you know, text, act and all that stuff.

[46:19] And you can pay for the enterprise savings for a year ahead of time.

[46:21] You can do all that stuff and not dilute down.

[46:24] But then the company owes me money, but I own the company.

[46:26] So whatever.

[46:27] Right?

[46:28] And I know I'm going to get a good return on capital.

[46:29] And so fundamentally, it's that help everybody in terms of thinking about this from a speed perspective.

[46:34] Like venture backed companies go faster because they cheat from like the nature of business.

[46:40] Is like they start with a ton of money and they can spend it from money they didn't make.

[46:45] Boost draft, you have to make every dollar that you spend.

[46:47] But I think that long term boost job businesses are the most fundamentally sound.

[46:53] I don't even get too much into that because I'll just stop there.

[46:58] All the TLDR is you're going slow because you're comparing it to a venture backed company.

[47:03] I was in that public credit partnership that agreed on him.

[47:07] So we also didn't have the pressure out.

[47:10] But we had social outpipes.

[47:12] Yeah, you didn't even have like revenue or profit goals.

[47:15] You had even hit.

[47:16] So you had like outside money.

[47:17] You didn't.

[47:18] You weren't accountable for any financial metrics.

[47:20] And you could just hire people like yeah that's like literally the opposite of a bootstrap business.

[47:25] And so like it's unsurprising that it feels different.

[47:29] I'll just let you break this and text you a question.

[47:33] Sure.

[47:34] So my next prior will be someone if you come to space and then seal it.

[47:38] How much a cash reserves team think I should have before I break all on.

[47:43] Someone who's been a main person's business.

[47:46] So this will be good for everybody.

[47:50] The rate at which you hire is actually a risk question.

[47:53] Kind of like we were talking about earlier.

[47:55] And so this is where I made a tweet the other day was like your lifestyles, your competitors opportunity.

[48:00] Which is the amount that you require to live on in distributions is what you can't reinvest in the business.

[48:06] But there's no perfect answer for that.

[48:07] If you have a family with kids like we were talking about earlier,

[48:10] then I don't see that as bad.

[48:13] It's just that if somebody else you're competing against doesn't have a family in kids and reinvest all that money,

[48:18] then they're going to beat you.

[48:20] But you might not care because you might not be in a business where there's a network effect that like it's a race to the top.

[48:24] Very few businesses are that way.

[48:26] Like you're trying to build a Facebook then yeah, you probably want to reinvest everything.

[48:29] If you're trying to build a dry cleaning store, probably doesn't matter.

[48:31] And so within the context of your business, I doubt that there are a network effects that are going to like kick in at any time,

[48:36] reason when if you did you need venture back and to get there in time anyway.

[48:39] So let's just not get into that.

[48:41] And so the time that you choose to hire that person is basically based on the risk that you are comfortable with dealing.

[48:49] Know it like if you know that the business is going to continue to grow, then you're just dragging the growth forward.

[48:55] But you're sacrificing your paycheck so you can pay somebody else so they can drag that growth forward.

[49:00] And so it's a like the entrepreneurs dilemma is consumption versus investment.

[49:05] As when do I start getting pay days and it really just depends on you.

[49:10] All right, so we're kind of doing that process and we're trying to trust the process based off when you allow your kind of video to start making sure.

[49:18] I feel like I'm I'm going to see no free lactateales or she's sucked.

[49:23] Yeah, but I have faith.

[49:28] So what can we do that just do it in most of this?

[49:33] Most of my, most of our business based off of just organic.

[49:38] Cool.

[49:39] That we're getting a person.

[49:40] Just trying to figure out like a formula or how to determine a budget.

[49:45] What do you sell?

[49:46] What do you sell?

[49:48] Okay, got it helpful.

[49:50] Um, yeah, I mean, you most guys who succeeded that are either doing outbound.

[49:57] One, they have referral partners.

[50:00] So they have other businesses that are tangential to windows and roofing that go into customer sums.

[50:06] This is other home services businesses and they set up good kickbacks for those sales reps and those people out those businesses.

[50:12] Or it's usually PPC driven or or social driven.

[50:15] So there's a kind of like the foremost common besides worth amount, right?

[50:19] That people use to grow those businesses because we have home services that come through all the time.

[50:23] So I'm very familiar with the model.

[50:26] So the issue that you're having just some can restate the problems that you've tried through agencies and they have not produced results.

[50:32] So when you say they haven't produced results, did they not produce leads or the leads sucked?

[50:37] Yeah, different.

[50:41] Okay, now, so of the ones that produce leads, what was the problem with the leads?

[50:48] Not relevant, or people who said that the standard is about the forms or they don't know why we contact because that's on their own home.

[50:57] Uh-huh, okay.

[50:59] Yeah.

[51:01] So, um, the the crappy part with the agency gambit, especially if you don't know what you're doing, is that like you end up getting burned.

[51:09] But it's one of those things we're like, you're not going to quit, right?

[51:12] And so it's kind of like agencies didn't work for us.

[51:15] It's like, well, there's obviously agencies that are in home services that do great.

[51:18] And so, um, like path one is you just keep finding, you keep going until you find an agency.

[51:24] And when you talk to them, you're like, hey, if I don't see results in 30 days amount,

[51:28] but if I do, I'll keep paying you for a very long time.

[51:31] And also ask them for their best practices because if an agency does not give you best practices, they suck.

[51:37] So just give you that as a warning.

[51:39] So the best agencies will be like, okay, this is the phone all the leads are coming in on.

[51:43] This is the offer they're seeing.

[51:45] The people who see the most success call leads within five minutes.

[51:48] This is the script they use.

[51:49] This is how they maximize shops, blah, blah, blah.

[51:51] So they're going to give you their kind of like best system.

[51:54] And some of them will also just work the leads for you because business owners in general suck at working leads.

[51:59] And so, like, if you're not getting an agency that's even talking that lingo,

[52:03] then I would say that that would be a, that'd be a red flag.

[52:06] So just use that as like at least filter number one.

[52:09] But in terms of like how I would probably approach that business,

[52:13] it would be going to 10-gencials.

[52:15] So it's like carpet cleaning and landscaping and other home services where people are in those on a regular basis.

[52:23] And they see the, you know, they see the roof and the windows on a regular basis.

[52:28] I'll give you a thousand bucks or whatever, whatever your referral fee could be.

[52:31] And so what's your cost to your car customer right now?

[52:35] That's another constraint that's around the reason.

[52:38] Okay. Well, how much do you make from a customer on average?

[52:42] Okay, cool.

[52:44] So you could pay a grant for a customer and be happy with it.

[52:47] Is that margin? 8,000 or revenue?

[52:50] Okay, great.

[52:52] Yeah. So then, yeah.

[52:53] I mean, if you give landscape or is a thousand bucks a referral,

[52:56] they will beg borrow and steal to get you referrals.

[53:00] And so obviously that's a very different strategy for acquisition.

[53:03] If I were in your shoes, fast as easiest path is look for an agency that follows those check marks.

[53:09] And I don't know how your buying process went,

[53:12] but I would recommend also reading the agency chapter in case you read it.

[53:16] But it, like, talked to 10 of them before you buy.

[53:21] Like, actually talked to 10.

[53:23] Sounds great.

[53:24] I think there's been a problem.

[53:25] It's just dating to people.

[53:27] Yeah. Like, date more than one.

[53:30] That's like, I got a crazy chick in a fat chick and like, ah, you know.

[53:34] You know, so like, whatever.

[53:36] So like, just, you know, like open the pool of who you can pick from, right?

[53:41] So that's, that's kind of where I would, where I would go with that.

[53:44] Something sounds.

[53:45] So just open the selection up and then I will promise you this.

[53:48] By the time this is when you know you can pick,

[53:50] so it'll give you the limit test is when you stop learning things on the call.

[53:54] So you talk to the first guy and you're like, okay,

[53:57] that's a lot of new information.

[53:59] That will be back to you.

[54:00] Talk to the second guy.

[54:01] He mentions more new stuff.

[54:02] For me, it takes me about 15 calls with experts to really wrap my head around a space.

[54:07] And so that's like kind of like my limit test.

[54:09] So once I start like being able to say like, but what about this?

[54:12] And what about this consideration?

[54:13] And they're like, oh, he's a more knowledgeable consumer.

[54:15] And like, I can start talking there in Lingo.

[54:17] That's how I know I can make an informed message.

[54:19] So you've been making un-informed decisions.

[54:20] And because of that, they're getting better results,

[54:22] which is not surprising.

[54:23] I make a, I'm at no insult to the women in the room,

[54:28] which is just a hypothetical.

[54:30] In a bit of like, my name is feel like I've watched your content.

[54:32] I've tried to implement on the things, but I think it's hard to put it into a big

[54:38] mistake because it's a little bit different.

[54:39] I do a business loan.

[54:41] It's very cash-heavy on the run.

[54:43] And right now, I realize that constraint is getting new clients.

[54:48] And finding a method that works.

[54:50] So I can kind of scale that.

[54:52] Okay, how do you get clients now?

[54:54] So it's all referrals from previous clients.

[54:57] Great.

[54:58] So you done a good job with the average loan?

[55:00] Average loan?

[55:01] Average loan?

[55:02] Average loan?

[55:03] Right now, probably around $7,000.

[55:06] Okay, so this is like credit card stuff?

[55:07] Sorry.

[55:08] Is like credit card stuff or is this like loan loans?

[55:10] Loanless.

[55:11] Interesting.

[55:12] Loat ticket.

[55:13] Okay, no, there's definitely higher ones.

[55:14] Yeah.

[55:15] But usually to start off, we like to start small ones.

[55:17] Okay, got it.

[55:18] Yeah.

[55:19] And so you need more customers.

[55:22] We need more customers.

[55:23] Okay.

[55:24] So we're doing a way to figure out how to scale that.

[55:27] We've caught those.

[55:28] And the good thing about it is we've kind of built up some money to think where we can't

[55:34] ourselves to maybe do advertising or that person who would be able to send to people

[55:39] that reach for that.

[55:40] So for that business, I would probably especially the ticket price you're at, I would probably go

[55:45] ads or referral partners.

[55:48] So those would be that those would be the two channels that I would see is like the

[55:52] most likely to succeed with that.

[55:57] Yeah, sneeze of the event.

[56:03] I just want to sneeze like that and just like see what people do.

[56:07] Anyways.

[56:09] So ads or I would do the referral partners.

[56:13] And so referral partners would be like, okay, well, who else is dealing with these particular

[56:17] types of customers?

[56:18] So it might be the credit repair companies and saying like, I'm sure they have almost all

[56:21] those guys are for out business.

[56:23] And so making your referral mechanism more valuable than other people's.

[56:29] That would be a big one because if you can, the way that you can win there is if you can

[56:33] verify a higher percentage of their customers than other people do, then you'll be able to pay them more.

[56:38] Because a lot of people waste leads.

[56:40] And there's plenty companies that just like send the leads on even ask for anything back.

[56:43] And so you can be more aggressive on the acquisition to them.

[56:45] You're like, hey, I can extend your LTV.

[56:47] If you just like once you finish like repairing credit, I can get them a bigger loan.

[56:50] And I can pay you.

[56:52] And so getting a handful of those referral partners could be massive for the business.

[56:56] That's like you rely on some other people, but it could scale pretty quickly and it's cheap.

[57:00] Or at least it's low risk.

[57:02] How do you go about that?

[57:04] That's where you do outreach.

[57:06] So you do outreach to get affiliates and then the affiliates send you business.

[57:11] Then you can be more targeted.

[57:13] Does that make sense?

[57:15] Because if you do outreach, then it's like, what's the cost to acquire customer?

[57:18] The metrics there might be pretty tight for you.

[57:20] If you're doing 7,000 loans, I don't know what you make on a 7,000 loan.

[57:23] So we're trying to get into higher debt.

[57:25] What are you making alone with 7,000 dollars?

[57:28] Generally, 1,500 to 1,000 dollars.

[57:32] Okay.

[57:33] Just if that's what the call price is.

[57:35] Yeah, understood.

[57:36] So with like 1,500 to 1,000 dollars of gross profit, it's tight.

[57:40] It's very tight for outbound.

[57:41] And so like you'd want more margin if you could.

[57:44] And so that's why you're like, okay, well, I'll go to an affiliate.

[57:47] And maybe it cost me 10 grand to acquire an affiliate.

[57:50] But then affiliate is going to send me 20 customers a month.

[57:53] And so it cost me 10 to make 40,000 a month.

[57:56] And then the metrics make amazing sense.

[57:59] I'm sorry, just last thing.

[58:00] And if we're, so I know a few clients work.

[58:02] I have the committee to get to like the higher mybrom alone.

[58:05] Maybe 50 times a month.

[58:06] It's not like that.

[58:08] And so we have like maybe 3 or 4 of those.

[58:11] How would I get to leave you reach those like they're 1, so I can.

[58:16] And that's the worry about.

[58:19] Adds in referral partners.

[58:21] And if you have referral partners, you tell them who you're looking for.

[58:24] We specialize in people with 50,000 dollar ands are higher.

[58:28] If that's, I mean like you just tell what you want.

[58:30] And then you can pay him even better slices.

[58:32] So then it'd be interesting.

[00:00] The fastest way to become the person that you want is to surround yourself with people who give you no choice but to become them.

[00:06] And so, I think Layla and I are very proud to announce that we're bringing in for the first time ever in our career, a partner, into our business at acquisition.com.

[00:16] Which is the man the mythalescent, the Michael Jordan of the real estate industry, Shoron Sravata.

[00:23] Oh, so excited to be here. Is this so fun?

[00:25] I'm so excited. I can't believe it's finally here.

[00:27] Over a year. Over a year that we've been talking about it now.

[00:30] You remember we're doing the whiteboard session in Alex's office and we're like talking about the whole plan. We plan the whole thing out.

[00:35] And it's like the countdown began out at a little time around his phone.

[00:38] Yeah, I did. And every effort for days and weeks, I would just be like 78 days left.

[00:43] 54 days left. I do a good finally announced this.

[00:46] I think that it would be helpful for everyone to know kind of like the thought process behind the decision and kind of our relationship and how it's evolved to

[00:54] even deciding to do this because getting into a partnership, you know, you've heard our content before.

[00:59] It's like getting married. It's a huge, it's a huge decision.

[01:02] We were all equally terrified.

[01:04] Yeah. No. And just like not wanting to f-can-eat things up.

[01:07] Yeah. And we've been so what a lot of people might not know is that we've been friends for six or seven years now and like very good friends.

[01:13] So to give you some context and we'll walk through some of the timelines because I think it'll be relevant.

[01:19] But like when we were selling the company, I was talking to Shron every morning like, hey, what do you think about this and where we think of this still term and even before that, you know, I had I got introduced to him from a mutual friend of ours.

[01:31] And we had a zoom call like, I don't like four or five o'clock at night.

[01:36] And I don't really take calls in the afternoon. I was like, this is so weird. And I was like, I don't know, but this guy seems awesome from what this guy said because he don't assault a company for $3.4 billion.

[01:45] I want to talk to somebody who's like, it's for fur a scam. Yeah.

[01:48] Like I was like, oh, who are you talking to that did that? Yeah.

[01:52] And so news we hopped on and then we ended up talking for like three and a half hours, which never happens. And so I think that's pretty much how it kicked off.

[01:59] And we very quickly became very good friends.

[02:03] Why remember what happened was like Alex went on the zoom call, right? And then I made dinner all the stuff.

[02:08] He comes back at like eight thirty and then I was like, how was the call? And then he was like, you need to meet this guy. Like you'd really like him.

[02:14] And I was like, you're supposed to time when you drew some of you like listen to something smells wrong about this guy.

[02:19] Right. And then I remember like I was so hesitant, but I was like, okay, he would not like be like, you need to meet him if he didn't think so.

[02:25] He's like, no, I think like you would get along really well with him. And I was like, okay, he's only said that about like two or three people ever.

[02:30] I've been right every time.

[02:32] Correct.

[02:33] Do you remember the first call though? All we did was

[02:37] Alex was on the call. Yeah. And we just drew processes out on a white on an iPad. Yeah, I do remember his I remember I'm being like blown away. I was like, how do you know all this stuff.

[02:48] And then I was like, can I pay you money? I don't know what to do. And you were like, we're just friends. And I was like, I understand, but this is where I just need you to help me with it.

[02:55] And he were like, no one I was like, yes, please help.

[02:58] And so I would say, Sean was the original kind of first trusted confidant for our money. So like we had, you know, good amount of money prior to the sale. And then obviously after the sale there was even more.

[03:09] And so the game of making money versus the game of making your money make money are too completely different games. There is crossover where one makes you better the other and the other makes you better at the first.

[03:20] But they're still a ton or for me there was a huge amount of ignorance that of I mean even around tax law of like, oh, wait, hold on, these I'm getting this to Shabu's, but I'm getting tax on this to us, but I paid tax on the money first.

[03:35] And then like, wait, you can have other things. I can appreciate them. There's blends for cash flow and and all of the stuff and then there's like, oh, there's there's buckets that you can put your investments into so that you can optimize towards different outcomes and all of this stuff was stuff that we didn't know.

[03:47] And we ended up creating our money rules list. I think three, four years ago you guys might have seen a video of mine where it's like these are the money rules, these are money algorithms. A lot of those stem from from shrunk.

[03:57] It's so cool because like you're you're really great at marketing and brand. You're really great at investing and you're really great at operating and it's like every time I've seen one area, it's just like the depth of knowledge and e-tariot to it's like it's not like your shallow and all it's like you deep knowledge and each of those areas.

[04:11] I think that's when we really started talking a lot more because it was like, okay, we're talking about all the things we're doing the same and that was really fun for me.

[04:19] I remember when when the time between after the sale after I saw we had sold tell us and I was doing investing private equity stuff.

[04:26] I would just talk to both of you saying man, I don't know what my next thing is and the crazy part is I think a lot of people don't know this, but you were the first people that I talked to about the real opportunity.

[04:35] And I said, hey, I have this, this is super interesting small public company 200 million in revenue and you're like, you get to go work.

[04:44] Do that.

[04:47] It's the following funny to sit back and think about it all because I think as you I was like thinking through before we sat down here, I was like, how did this conversation even start around us all working together because I we I had obviously talked about Alex for years before we don't talk about it because I was and it was more of like a

[05:04] I was like, I was like, oh, guys, there's some way we could be sharon on the board or like Raymond is like, like, how do we involve him somewhere in a it was just like something I didn't know how to do and it's like normal time of telling him I would ask sharon about this, but I can't ask about it because it's him.

[05:17] And then I'm trying to think about you guys remember how we started having the conversation about I know exactly what happened really.

[05:23] But really, so we were a dinner and then I said, man, I think I've hit all the big goals we went from 200 million valuation to a billion all valuation and I said, I'm down.

[05:33] I think I'm just going to retire Alex just laugh he's like, you would be so bored being retired again.

[05:38] You've already done this.

[05:39] Yeah, you should just come work with us and we could do it for a long time.

[05:44] Yeah.

[05:45] And I was like, you don't want that.

[05:46] I was like, no, I do want that you should totally do that.

[05:49] And so I'll give you a little bit a little bit of a little bit of backstory.

[05:52] We'll Quentin Tarantino this will put the pieces together, but Sean came here as an immigrant as the only child.

[05:57] His parents sold their belongings to get him a one way ticket so that he could be here.

[06:01] And then immediately you met a mentor who took interest in you with your very thick Indian accent, which you can't hear anymore because you worked on getting rid of it.

[06:09] And then what did you get exception to a program?

[06:12] What was the, like, what was the gap there that got you into like the that that software company?

[06:17] So how it all happened was for my senior paper in college.

[06:21] I wrote this, I wrote the senior paper in computer science and I pitched it at a programming contest at Berkeley.

[06:27] And one of the judges said to me, after I've just saying, hey kid, you're not going to win.

[06:33] I was like, thanks a lot, but that's a good idea.

[06:35] I just funded a couple of the guys.

[06:37] I think what you are sharing would be perfect for them.

[06:40] And that was my first foray into, you know, having a startup.

[06:44] And so I actually lived in my, in my own space, and I had no money, and we were building a startup,

[06:48] downtown Hill Road, raising cash.

[06:50] And this is during the boom.

[06:52] So we raised 20 plus $1 million and then sold a business overall.

[06:56] So it was all by chance when I was, my senior paper pitching at a programming contest.

[07:01] So you got the exit money from that deal and learned a bunch of stuff about deal making in that process, which we'll get to another time.

[07:08] And then you took off for like five years to play professional tennis.

[07:12] And so plays professional, he's like, oh great.

[07:14] I'm done. I don't need money, and where I'm going to play tennis for five years.

[07:17] Can you imagine Alex explaining this story to me after he had, you had told, I was like,

[07:21] why is he going to play tennis player?

[07:23] And he was in the end and he's a billionaire.

[07:25] It's awesome.

[07:27] It's so, so after that, though, you're like, you know, I need to, I need to get back to work.

[07:32] So then you went to get your MBA.

[07:34] Yep.

[07:35] Yeah, so he went to Vanderbilt. So he's a fellow fellow Commodore.

[07:38] So those you don't know. I also went to Vanderbilt.

[07:40] And the unique college.

[07:41] Yep. Community college.

[07:42] Western.

[07:43] That's what they, that's what the kids call it.

[07:46] Anyways, so goes to go to Vanderbilt for the MBA.

[07:49] And then goes from Vanderbilt into Goldman Sachs on the credit side, right?

[07:54] Yeah.

[07:55] And then calling all these business owners to, you know, talk about financial products and investing things like that.

[08:00] Did you, is that how you found tell us?

[08:02] Yeah. So one of my clients was also an investor.

[08:06] He said, had invested in this in this real estate company and he said, hey, I invested in the real estate company.

[08:11] Can you come take a look at it? And that's how the tell us process started.

[08:15] Tell us, how many years?

[08:17] Five.

[08:18] So in five years, Ron went in, bought a huge chunk of the company.

[08:22] Went from 300 million in gross volume to 3.4 billion in five years.

[08:27] And then they sold that company and then they got integrated into Douglas Elm.

[08:31] Douglas Elm.

[08:32] Yeah. And so after that sale, he then was like, okay, I'm going to do another five or six year

[08:38] stint of the, of the, the sharon, what do I do with my life?

[08:42] Investment.

[08:44] Okay.

[08:45] I have so much money. What do I do?

[08:48] Do you remember the first time when we hung out with you doing that stint too? Like, you were like,

[08:52] You guys want to go to breakfast at like nine.

[08:54] Yeah, we were so stressed breakfast.

[08:57] And I love my day.

[08:59] So I know I'm going don't think you don't know is that we're like,

[09:02] Tronty, only person we do breakfast with.

[09:04] Oh, literally I say, no idea.

[09:07] But I had no idea.

[09:08] Oh, there you go.

[09:09] I still have no idea until I, I know.

[09:11] I have to price you.

[09:12] It's like, we eat from like nine to like 11, 15.

[09:16] And it's like, well, there's my entire more.

[09:18] Sorry.

[09:20] We also drank like 14 cups of decafs.

[09:23] Yeah.

[09:24] So I'm going to let it actually start hitting you like calf when you drink that much.

[09:27] But we,

[09:28] Anyway, see you, you did that.

[09:30] And that's, I mean, I see that jokingly, but it's real a cap.

[09:32] But it got started.

[09:33] And then that was really the family office component of it.

[09:35] Read it private equity and venture side investments.

[09:38] And then a bunch of real estate stuff as well.

[09:40] Obviously, that's the, the background that you come from.

[09:42] You know, huge mix of doing that.

[09:44] And then that's that kind of got us to the, to the real situation,

[09:47] where real was doing, you know,

[09:49] 200 million or has a, had a 200 million or a market cap.

[09:52] And it was at 36 months.

[09:54] Yeah, not even.

[09:55] Yeah. So less than three years.

[09:57] One to 1.2 billion.

[09:58] So six acts and less than three years when Sharon came in.

[10:01] And so that is, that is the,

[10:04] The Michael Jordan of the real estate industry,

[10:06] not only doing a billion dollar company once, but twice.

[10:09] So he's 100% on his real estate companies getting to a billion.

[10:14] And so we're just, honestly,

[10:15] I was just like, I'm beyond thrilled to have Sharon in here because

[10:20] it's, it was such, it was so natural because all of the major business decisions and strategic direction stuff that I would end up calling Sharon about anyways.

[10:28] Like, I feel like you, I was shadow, I was getting you as a shadow,

[10:32] de facto partner.

[10:33] And so the integration has been almost like,

[10:37] we just get to hang out more than we do before.

[10:40] Yeah, it's really interesting because I also think during that time where you started and you were doing all the investments yourself.

[10:46] And you're kind of took your structure and mirror it for us.

[10:49] And that's when we learned about private equity, when we learned about investing,

[10:53] we then we found seven real estate partners.

[10:56] And the only one that ever end up working out was from you.

[10:59] Well, I'll say the ones that worked out well.

[11:01] Yeah, worked out well.

[11:02] Yeah, yeah, okay, sorry, anybody else.

[11:05] But the only impressive returns and deals were from you.

[11:09] And like now it's like I can't imagine the fact that we didn't work together before,

[11:12] not the same time, but like a route.

[11:14] Just, you know, you have very similar time frame.

[11:16] And then that's why I think we started talking more and more about we shifted from investing to business.

[11:21] And then as acquisition.com, start taking off.

[11:24] And then you had like, I don't know what the next step is.

[11:27] Then it was like, it just felt like it made so much sense.

[11:30] And I think we were all so worried.

[11:32] Like, is it like, how's it going to be?

[11:34] And it's funny.

[11:35] Because I remember the first, you first day.

[11:37] Like when we sat down in a meeting together, it was like, I was so nervous.

[11:40] I don't know why.

[11:41] It wasn't even mind meeting.

[11:42] It was shadowing.

[11:43] And then it was like after 45 minutes.

[11:45] And then we're like, by the end of the date, felt like,

[11:47] if I like, this has always been how it has been.

[11:50] Does that make sense?

[11:51] Yeah.

[11:52] And like now it's like I can't imagine the fact that we didn't work together before,

[11:54] for all those years.

[11:55] It's crazy.

[11:56] Well, we kind of did.

[11:57] I was just now on the official Slack channel.

[11:59] Yeah.

[12:00] But that's fair.

[12:01] No, we were like, you've told me about this.

[12:02] I'm like, I know.

[12:03] But I think my favorite kind of part of the story is I got to see.

[12:09] Jim launch and sale.

[12:11] I got to see the early idea of acquisition.com.

[12:15] I got to see acquisition.com version one.

[12:19] The building and the growth of headquarters, acquisition.com version two.

[12:23] And then all the stuff we're planning for the future.

[12:26] And so it feels like I've had a chance to see and be a part of it.

[12:29] And from the outside looking in, but the inside looking in is even cooler,

[12:35] which is, which is the best part.

[12:37] Yeah.

[12:38] It's just super fun.

[12:40] I think everybody watching too, you know, as we're talking about this, I think a good lesson to take away is like,

[12:44] I think one thing that was really apparent to me early on at least is like, why did Alex say, like, oh, you'd like this guy, right?

[12:50] He said that because most of the people that he would, you know, we talked to him.

[12:54] I'm sure you have the same thing.

[12:55] It's like, they just want money.

[12:57] It's like they're in business.

[12:58] I think it's like, there's people who are in business to make money.

[13:00] And then people who are love business and love making cool and then make money by consequence.

[13:06] And when I met you, it was clear that you were the type of person that you like building, you like being excellent and building great business.

[13:14] And money comes as a consequence of that, right?

[13:17] Money comes as a consequence of the fact that you actually really love people.

[13:20] And that you're really great person and that you have values that you value your family.

[13:23] And like, there's just so few people who have that where I think for me, especially like,

[13:28] it's so important to me that anybody that we work with doesn't just have this one area, like they know how to make money,

[13:33] but they also can build a great business. They're great to their team. They're great to their clients. They've great reputation.

[13:37] They've a great family life. They take care of themselves personally. And it's like, when I met you, it was so clear that you had all those.

[13:43] You weren't just like one area and sacrificing all the rest because, you know,

[13:47] I think there's a difference between like building great business and making money. We all know that.

[13:50] And so I think that's why also just like very early on and throughout the process of being us being friends.

[13:54] I think the reason is so easy to be friends is we have shared values.

[13:57] Well, I'll tell you this one thing,

[13:59] and I learned this from both of you, which is you can't just be good at one thing.

[14:04] And to win in life, I'm sorry, you have to win at everything.

[14:08] And sometimes you have seasons of life where one takes precedence, like, I would still say, have this season of no or you say,

[14:14] I'm working on my help. That's great. But you have to win at everything. There is no other choice.

[14:19] And I bet people are thinking, well, how did this, you know, how did they negotiate, how to do the financials of the deal?

[14:25] And I want to tell people, you know, though, it's worth selling.

[14:28] The depth of the relationship allowed for the deal terms to be really easy and for everyone watching Alex and Laila said, hey, just write us an email with what you're thinking.

[14:39] So I wrote an email and then they hit reply all added counsel and say, please draft this. That's all it was.

[14:46] That was the whole negotiation, which would have been months and years for most people arguing of her terms, et cetera.

[14:52] We had none of that. It was a, I've been through a lot of these in my life. And I will tell you it was the most gracious, the kindest and nothing we affirmed wanting to do this personally for me when all that y'all did was have reply all and say, just paper this.

[15:07] There's literally the same. It was an impinded me of like, even just like in any great partnership, right? It's like, you just everything's been done ahead of time.

[15:16] So then it makes the hard stuff easy because you already worked on hard stuff.

[15:19] Yeah, and that's I think a good lesson for everybody, which is if you're getting to the point where stuff's breaking down on a final deal term means something else was majorly wrong before. And so if you can get all of that in alignment, the deal points are very simple.

[15:37] I want to, I want to hit on something because I think it's important. So I said it very casually at the beginning, but Lail and I have never had part of that we've basically brought into our kind of like the holding company.

[15:52] I've spent the last, you know, five, five years from a constant perspective, and less 13 plus from a reputation perspective and building reputation and so bringing someone in at that level was a serious, you know, decision.

[16:05] And if you're thinking like, okay, well, why would, why would they do something like that? Like, couldn't you just try and find somebody could just hire or something like that?

[16:14] There come certain levels of skill and experience that are unhirable.

[16:22] You know, I mean, like, there's the deal that you know, I've been I did with John Ivy, right, where like he's he's now just basically a co-founder status of open now because he brings such a depth of experience and a network and a skill set and and and that to replicate that it would be both impractical and likely, I don't want to say impossible, but the effort to replicate it would track from the whole overall.

[16:48] And so, like, you'd have to have like two companies to replicate what's wrong can do.

[16:53] And so the vision for what we're trying to go if anything is that this is just expanded what were brought the future closer of what we have always wanted to do with acquisition dot com and try to pay down ignorance death as fast as possible with somebody who has, I mean, I mean more experience than anyone on on on the deal side on the real estate side.

[17:17] Private equity side like he is so much there, but then obviously from a scale perspective in the trenches, but in two billion dollar companies all within five year periods.

[17:26] I mean, I'm I'm very upfront about the things that I will always reinvest in our ability to do more.

[17:32] This was a serious call and I mean, you think about for me it's like you're an associate someone really heavily with your brand.

[17:37] It's a it's a huge bet, you know, there's risk, but Toronto felt very much worth the risk because I think what we're going to do together is going to be really big.

[17:45] And that's funny as you're saying that you know one thing I realized through the whole process is not one time did I have a doubt.

[17:51] Yeah, like not one doubt like I like never.

[17:54] I never felt bad about it. I never had any like hesitation. I just worried that I was going to put up some help and I still to this day. I think we both have that like I'm hinted on that like what am I going to do to fit up.

[18:05] I haven't done that word every other situation.

[18:07] It's just us.

[18:09] It's just us.

[18:10] I sleep on.

[18:12] There's Lord.

[18:13] I know I just take it all for both of us every deal we've done every event like I always am the one doubting and hesitating and I like literally never like it always felt good like it felt really good for me the whole time.

[18:24] I think part of it too for like people that are listening is like that's the logic side of it.

[18:28] I think there's another side which is like none of us have to do this.

[18:31] Yeah.

[18:32] And and because of that, I look at it is like what's the biggest risk to any of us not even our dreams.

[18:38] I think that's the biggest risk to any of us.

[18:40] I think that's the biggest risk to any of us.

[18:43] I think that's the biggest risk to any of us.

[18:46] I think that's the biggest risk to any of us.

[18:48] I think that's the biggest risk to any of us.

[18:51] I think that's the biggest risk to any of us.

[18:53] I think that's the biggest risk to any of us.

[18:55] I think that's the biggest risk to any of us.

[18:57] I think that's the biggest risk to any of us.

[18:59] I think that's the biggest risk to any of us.

[19:01] I think that's the biggest risk to any of us.

[19:03] I think that's the biggest risk to any of us.

[20:57] You have two new barrels and we have one new barrel.

[20:59] Alex talked about it when he first shared with me.

[21:03] He goes, hey, most founders are single barrels.

[21:05] They've got to get to a point.

[21:07] Maybe you can articulate this better.

[21:09] I get to a point and now I've got to go raise money or create something

[21:13] to artificially create a second opportunity for myself to get the barrel bigger.

[21:19] What a lot of people don't realize is the first time I met both of you.

[21:23] The first time I talked to Alex, I go,

[21:25] man, he can just make something out of nothing.

[21:29] He can make things up.

[21:31] It's amazing.

[21:33] Alex's ability to make things up.

[21:35] Just make things up that can drive-brand, create businesses, etc.

[21:39] I was like, that's who's going to make it happen.

[21:43] When then when I chat with Alex,

[21:45] I was like, okay, well, you got to make things up and make things happen.

[21:49] I think there's a, that's why it's worked really well for both of you.

[21:53] Right?

[21:54] And so Alex can make anything up and Laila can make anything happen.

[21:57] And that's a really powerful combination.

[21:59] And so my question for you, Alex,

[22:01] is if someone is thinking about that in their business,

[22:04] is there, is that the diagnostic,

[22:06] or would you think about a different diagnostic?

[22:10] So I think there's like, there's,

[22:13] everything comes down to return on time.

[22:15] I think if we boil everything down for the entrepreneurs,

[22:18] like you only have so much time and if you get returns on your time,

[22:20] we try and get other people who have high leverage time,

[22:23] which is like, not only can I get somebody who can do something,

[22:26] but they're also bringing in 10 years that I don't have to learn to get that skill

[22:31] to then do this other thing with the rate limiter,

[22:34] which is the whole concept of barrels.

[22:36] It's like you can only ship things so quickly.

[22:37] And there's only so many opportunities that you can pursue.

[22:40] Like, and I'm a big advocate of focus,

[22:42] you know, aggressive advocate of focus.

[22:44] But you really never overexpand, you just under talent.

[22:48] And I think the vast, and that under talent is just this not enough barrels, right?

[22:51] You have 20 great ideas.

[22:53] You've got one life and there's one you.

[22:54] Now if you had 20 barrels, you could do all 20.

[22:56] You've got Elon.

[22:57] He's got six big crazy opportunities.

[22:59] His highest leverage is ability to attract barrels,

[23:02] probably more than anything else.

[23:04] But with, I want to circle back to what you said with me and Layla.

[23:07] So I got to somewhere in the neighborhood between $2 and $2 a year.

[23:10] I can't remember the exact financials.

[23:12] But between $2 a million dollars a year when Layla and I met.

[23:14] That was about where I had kind of like,

[23:16] a cap doesn't entrepreneur.

[23:18] And that was for, I chased too many rabbits.

[23:21] I was too spread then.

[23:22] And I had six different businesses.

[23:23] I had all these different things going on.

[23:25] And then when Layla came to my life,

[23:26] she got me to focus on one opportunity.

[23:28] And then she was able to basically make all these things happen.

[23:31] And also at the same time, push back and be like,

[23:33] great idea next year.

[23:35] And that, from an order of magnitude perspective,

[23:38] that one from, I mean, you think about where we were there.

[23:41] $2 or $3 million a year as a solo entrepreneur.

[23:43] And then I was able to be able to be able

[24:13] to be able to be able to be

[24:43] able to be able to be able to

[25:13] be able to be able to be able

[25:43] to be able to be able to be

[26:13] is insanely powerful for an organization.

[26:15] Do I say I got it?

[26:16] You say I got it very often and I really appreciate that.

[26:20] I looks never got it.

[26:22] We sometimes have to text you out of the table.

[26:25] This is your time to say I got it right back.

[26:27] No, no, but but and I should think you made a video about this.

[26:31] You said, you know, how do you get scale?

[26:32] You get scale when you ensure that the the leverage that is transferred gets transferred without a change in the performance in some way, right?

[26:41] Which is insane.

[26:42] And so from that favorite three words, it's somewhat can ever tell me as I got it because I know that and if they actually got it, it's super super powerful.

[26:50] And when you have someone like that in your organization, I would support them get out of their way, reduce fiction, get them support, make sure whatever they want to stay in care of.

[27:00] Not that you need a partner per se, but anybody that is that can that has that level of competence and that has that level of care.

[27:07] I would highly take care of them.

[27:09] And if you're in an organization right now, and you feel like you want that recognition, say, hey partner manager, boss, whatever, I got it and then deliver on the I got it that is the fastest way to kind of building that trust with your team.

[27:23] And then it's really good.

[27:24] You say I got it all the time.

[27:25] And it's just like if had someone says it to me, I'm just like I will ask no more questions like.

[27:30] That's the only thing that's why you got it.

[27:32] If the focus there's qualifiers there, yeah, as long as I know they got it, well, because I also think that the other thing it does for the person saying I got it, which.

[27:40] What a lot of people don't realize is when you say I got it, there's an insane belief system and a responsibility that you put on yourself because the reason I say I got it is I can't let Layla down.

[27:50] And so I will work super hard because I put those three words in front of Layla and the next time I say it, if I did not get it, then she's going to be like, what the heck, you know.

[27:59] So there is a they has to be a hundred percent say do ratio and I got it.

[28:04] You can't you cannot screw anytime.

[28:07] And if you do you're like, I'm so sorry, this is what happened. Let me fix it, right?

[28:11] So the number of I got it that can happen in an organization will move the business so much faster.

[28:18] It's really good analogy.

[28:19] Now I'm thinking about it.

[28:21] I'm like who says I got it the most?

[28:22] I can think of the top two people that say it to me the most.

[28:24] I'm like, oh, I always appreciate it so much.

[28:26] Like, oh yeah.

[28:27] I'll throw this in like I think bringing a partner on I think, you know, this has been awesome.

[28:36] You know, for us, but trying to explain like right way to fill wrong way to feel.

[28:41] I think just from pattern recognition perspective might be helpful.

[28:43] One we've been working for, you know, not working, but like we've been talking about this.

[28:47] So we've laid a lot of, you know, a groundwork for this so that we can hit the ground running.

[28:50] But Sean has given me and especially Layla attention back.

[28:55] And so it's like, and I don't like using soft language, but I'll use it here and then I'll explain it.

[28:59] But like it makes like, Sean is making everything feel lighter.

[29:03] And so I see that is okay, I only have so much time and so much bed with which even less than the time that I have in terms of like mental

[29:10] acuity and all of a sudden having two thirds of the things that I was formally working on.

[29:17] Now just gone and being done at the same level or arguably higher because Sean is more

[29:22] experienced with these things. So we're paying down ignorance does we're kind of learning the edge

[29:26] cases of what is the nine figure to 10 figure marketing playbook look like? What is the,

[29:32] the nine figure 10 figure, your sales playbook look like? What is the nine figure 10 figure

[29:35] product playbook look like? We're trying to pay down this ignorant set as fast as we can across all these functions.

[29:40] But it's like, well, Sean already did this on the public level, you know, in a public company

[29:45] and before that in in tell us at a multi-billion dollar level, it's like, well, some of these legal

[29:49] infrastructure pieces, it's like, okay, well, we can and we'll learn it or we can just not have to pay the

[29:54] scar that I know or the interest that is going to come do later because we just pay that debt down now.

[30:00] And I think that that habit of trying being willing to sacrifice some today to not get

[30:09] destroyed tomorrow has served us really well. But from a feeling perspective, which I don't really

[30:13] tap into very much, it just thinks feel lighter. And I think that if if someone comes into your organization

[30:18] and also we're at any level, but if someone comes into the organization and it feels heavier,

[30:22] it's not that person is not helping you. They're not putting attention back on your plate so that you can then

[30:27] eat up the problems that you're neatly qualified to solve at the higher level than you're currently

[30:31] solving on it.

[30:32] Mm hmm.

[30:34] No, I think that's really valid. I also think even even in that case, like when you're bringing someone to

[30:40] make it feel lighter, would ever that maybe. I think like for me, it's definitely very mental.

[30:45] It's also from a work standpoint, but like the mental like knowing that even just like talking

[30:49] things through with you, it's just like I just value that so much and I'm so great before.

[30:53] Just to talk through things that I didn't have anybody in the organization to talk to about before.

[30:57] You know what I mean? It's like of course, but we don't even work on the same things in the company.

[31:01] So it's different, which has just been like a sigh of relief of like,

[31:05] me being like, this is right and you're like, that's amazing. Right? And you're like, that's amazing.

[31:09] I'm like, okay, like it's nice validation. And then also like be able to run things by you and learn things

[31:15] that I didn't know. You know, when we told the team that you were coming on, like the the way that I brought it

[31:20] up to everyone was like, guess who hasn't taken a company $2 billion before me? I thought it was like,

[31:26] so I would like to bring on somebody who has like, and I think a big learning for me was that,

[31:34] you know, I was, and of course, I didn't talk to you about it because you're very busy at the time.

[31:37] But like, I was so nervous to tell everybody like, so nervous. So like I talked to one of my coaches.

[31:43] I talked like two of my coaches that I'm like, how do I do this in a way that positions it really well?

[31:47] And they're like, well, what's the truth about this? And I was like, all these,

[31:49] all everything that we just said here, right? And then I will just tell the truth.

[31:53] And it was so funny because I told the whole team and that was exactly the frame I used,

[31:58] which was just like, I haven't done this before. Sean has. We've been friends for this long.

[32:03] We've been talking to him behind the scenes for this long. Like these all think,

[32:06] and not one person hadn't had a verse response. And it still has not.

[32:11] Like it has gone insanely well. So what I will say is that if you are bringing in somebody to help,

[32:18] you don't want to like, skip out on how you bring them in, how you talk about it with your team,

[32:23] even like onboarding. Like it was fast and crazy, but like I built out everything and then you were like,

[32:28] honey, don't you? You're like, I will do some of that, but you know, it's like,

[32:33] you just never know, right? It's like you don't know. We should talk about Shasharan onboarding,

[32:37] because I think that would be super helpful for people who are bringing in high level executive

[32:42] directors, partners. Do you want to head on that? I mean, we can. It wasn't even as planned,

[32:47] because I ended up having to do that. You know, but I love what you did. I mean, so, you know,

[32:52] the first thing is Sharan did, which a lot of, so this is, I think this is Kudos to Sharan,

[32:55] because he is zero ego, which is why he is as successful as he is. But a lot of, you know, partners

[33:00] execs, even directors depending like leaders, I'll just say, my come into a company and just be like,

[33:05] all right, what's my 30, 60, 90? And there's nothing wrong with that. That's fine. But

[33:09] Sharan just was like, okay, I'm going to meet every single person who works at acquisition.com

[33:13] from like the bottom of the workshop all the way up and he was like, this gets me so much rapid

[33:18] context and I'll have a poor and and he basically onboarded himself within 10 days and talk to,

[33:25] you know, 100 plus people in that period of time and was like, he came back and was like, I understand

[33:31] what's going on. Which is better than like you trying to write a 16 page document that

[33:35] trying from, because the thing is, is it's always going to be one person's perspective, whereas if you

[33:39] get 100 different perspectives, you actually get such a such a three-dimensional view of the company

[33:45] rather than 2D kind of paper version. I'll also say that from a speed of growth perspective,

[33:50] if we think about the speed of a business can be derived from the speed of their ability to make

[33:56] decisions, right? Well, it's like then what what speeds up a decision making ability? So one part is data,

[34:03] well, actually data is going to be the biggest one, but when you don't have in the absence of data,

[34:07] you have patterns, right? You have basically past data that you can extrapolate in the future. And so

[34:12] to your point, Leila, it's like we might say, hey, based on reasoning, you know, there's some logic

[34:17] and that we'll be know about the world, we believe this is a good, a good, a good direction or a

[34:21] good decision. And having someone who has that pattern that's already recognized, be like,

[34:26] yep, already did that, that's the right call, or yes, and add this piece because this will come up later,

[34:33] it is compressed, what would be maybe multiple hour to hour long discussions that then being

[34:38] finally like, all right, let's just do it. But that whole process might take two, two weeks or

[34:43] four weeks to make that call, which then can now be done in 30 minutes. But then tomorrow,

[34:48] we have another 30 minute decision. And the day after we have another 30 minute decision, but each one of

[34:52] those would have been two to four weeks, two to four weeks, two to four weeks, and like that's where

[34:56] you can see why a company can grow at 10 times the rate, 100 times the rate of others because

[35:01] minutes versus months is a massive difference when we look at time scales for growth. And I think that's

[35:06] one of the other massive unlocks that data. I mean, I'm excited that you've already already given

[35:11] us, but you know, even more in the future. You mean just how we make decisions? Yeah.

[35:16] Yeah, I think part of that, too, is like, we're so we're usually like this. And I feel like you

[35:21] have the unique, like you've done a lot of things like by having both the sets of skills. So like

[35:27] you can flex on either side. And so like you bring a really like grounding middle ground and

[35:32] I don't think I ever disagree with you. No, well, thank you, but the, I think the interesting part

[35:38] about the onboarding, which people need to know is the thoughtful, like, Lala wrote me a, like,

[35:45] 16 to 20 page onboarding plan, which was amazing because that allowed me to sing. All right,

[35:51] let me read through that and the interesting part about that was not the planet itself was

[35:56] sing Lala's thought process on how the world works. And I thought, and I think that most people

[36:02] will just say, okay, cool, hey, let's do a press release and bring this person onboard and hey,

[36:06] for the first few months, just meet people, I'm like, no, you would 90 days of like ramping up.

[36:12] That's crazy. You have the, you need to make, you need to make impact today. And so Alex

[36:18] hit the nail in the head where if there, if the organization is somewhat larger, especially if

[36:22] there's a hybrid component to it, you can't wait for rapport. You need rapport and patterns

[36:28] very quickly. And so if you, if you, if you're talking to people and five of them say,

[36:35] this is what they level about the company that reinforces what that is. And it three of them say,

[36:40] this is the same issue that reinforces what that is. And you learn it very quickly and you learn

[36:44] from natural patterns. And that also allows for rapport. So if, if you're newer in a company,

[36:49] I would suggest focusing on rapport and patterns that will be very, very helpful. And the second

[36:55] is to be super impactful. You have to find the most granular thing that happens in the business. So

[37:01] for us, it was me going through every single line item in our panel. Yeah, right. And so I know

[37:08] you know everything because where the money goes is where the business invests. And once you know

[37:12] that, you know where everything is, is that. So if you're in a marketing organization, you should

[37:16] know every single metric, every single channel, and that allows you to kind of figure out that

[37:20] is the pattern in a lot of ways. So you people think about learning top down, you want to learn

[37:25] bottom up because that allows you to know what the culture of decision making happens. That's what's

[37:29] manifested in the bottom up numbers. And if you do bottom up, you can get perspective very quickly.

[37:34] If you do top down, it takes a lot of time. I think that's what I was most impressed with.

[37:38] This is I totally saw the the bottom approach there. You're just like already being able to

[37:42] recall so many of the details. I was like, wow, like just so fast. I don't even have anything

[37:50] insightful to say. It was just like really, it was really impressive. Well, I think the pattern for me

[37:53] is that, you know, if we bring leaders in in general, I mean, I think we've tended to, we talk about

[37:59] this publicly anyways, but it's just further reinforcing of the framework that like,

[38:02] a players don't usually need a long time to immediately start providing value. And when we hear

[38:08] someone who might say, like, I'm going to need a quarter just to like get my bearings. It's like,

[38:13] probably not the guy or the guy, right? Like every single player that I could name off the top

[38:17] of the head of this business. Like immediately, I mean, within the first five date, you know,

[38:22] first work week was like, I got it. I could already understand this chunk. I'm going to start eating

[38:27] this and I'm going to understand these. But they hit the ground running. And every time that I've

[38:32] probably been like, you know what, we'll give them it's like it's never really worked out long

[38:35] time. Or she's been an also ran. It's been like a, they're all right. Like they somewhat solve the

[38:39] problem and they're not a screaming hot paint right now. I'll do with it later. But every player

[38:44] hits the ground running. And, you know, this is obviously no exception. I would love you both to your

[38:49] perspectives on this. And I, because it's hopefully this is helpful for folks watching as they're

[38:52] bringing people on or you're coming onto an organization is you want to deliver artifacts as soon as

[38:58] possible. And it's not just, oh, I had impact. You want to deliver something real tangible,

[39:02] artifact, something as soon as possible. And when you start producing people around you're like,

[39:08] wait a minute, he showed up. He tried. He showed up. He wrote a memo. He showed up. He made a video.

[39:12] He showed up. He said, well, process. He showed up. He talked to a vendor. Right. And so it's, the email

[39:16] is not the artifact. The artifact is the artifact. And the more artifacts such you can ship early

[39:22] on, the more confidence you get and the more feedback you get. And you start to realize, if you're

[39:27] coming in new to an organization, the more artifacts you can ship the better. And when you say artifacts

[39:31] to mean like organizational wins, correct. Okay. Just so we read it this memo. Here's a video. Here's

[39:37] our word thinking about this. Like something I always think about it as, what do you have to show for it?

[39:42] Yeah. Where have you done this week? Which is a great dos question, but you have to ask yourself,

[39:47] what do you have to show for it? And if you have nothing to show for, and it's okay you made a

[39:51] decision, but early on, you have to have to have something to show for that decision. Otherwise,

[39:54] you don't get cultural buy-in on that. No. I think that's one piece that people just kind of

[39:58] want, which is like, I swear as people, I'm like, listen, I can know what you're doing, but if the

[40:03] team doesn't see wins from you, they're not going to like assimilate you into the organization.

[40:09] Right. They're not going to know why should I listen to this person because you're like, oh, well,

[40:12] no, askly, I'm doing all this for eight weeks behind the scenes. They're like, okay, whatever.

[40:17] And don't be behind the scenes. Don't be behind the scenes. And it's too big as piece of advice I

[40:21] give to everyone that asks me because we have so many new people. They're like, what can I do? And I'm like,

[40:25] one, don't tell people what to do when you're new. Like, don't go around telling people that

[40:30] something they do is wrong. Like, that doesn't make you smart. It doesn't make you cool. It doesn't,

[40:34] that's not why you're here. Like, just watch. Just watch. I was like, the second thing is offered

[40:39] to help everybody. I'm like, just offer, just like, hey, is anything I can do to help you? Is

[40:44] everything I do to support you? Like, if you do those two things, it's like, and one thing I've

[40:49] noticed with you is you're like, how can I support? How can I help? So I think do for you. Like,

[40:52] constantly asking those things. And it's like, even if someone doesn't need something, it's like, they

[40:56] feel like, well, they ask that they can do something for me and they're brand new. You know what I mean?

[41:00] And you always get in rapport from kind of the servant frame. Right? It's like, it's not telling

[41:05] them what to do. It's asking them what you can do. Just a small pivot. And by doing that, though,

[41:12] then it's like, now I've got one reward cycle of this person. And one, especially if you come in

[41:17] from the position of above, right? If they know you have the authority, you flipping in me like,

[41:21] hey, how can I help you? Like, I think that's the authority hijack, right? Yeah, the thing that you

[41:26] could do that ultimately will gain you real influence rather than title-based authority in the business.

[41:33] The one thing I will offer is the thing that made me feel the most welcome and secure

[41:40] was Lilith's document. Because it showed me that she cared enough to spend all that time

[41:48] preparing for me. And I don't think most, I'm just going to say most onboarding managers do that,

[41:54] where imagine the anxiety of a new person coming on board anywhere in the organization. They want

[42:01] to show up. They want to be successful. They want to do a good job. You know, but it is the first

[42:06] two to four weeks. Actually, the manager's responsibility, not the person's responsibility. And

[42:12] us putting in a little bit of effort upfront showing them that you have to think, hey, this is,

[42:16] this is a plan. Here's the onboarding plan shows that you care so much about the person coming

[42:21] on board. As opposed to, oh, yeah, we'll just introduce you around and watch, you don't want to do that.

[42:25] And so I publicly want to thank you. I know how much effort went into that, but that allowed me to

[42:33] see your thinking and also feel your care, which we have a bunch of new leaders coming on board

[42:40] that are going to work with us directly. And that you set the bar for me to think about them coming

[42:47] on that way and almost to guarantee their success. And so I want to take, I want to, my effort

[42:55] needs to guarantee their success. Because at the end of the day, we just want guaranteed success.

[43:00] And so I want to, I want to do the effort and you showed me how to do that. That's super cool.

[43:04] I appreciate that. It's funny you say that because that is when I remember when I walked into a new

[43:11] job and they had a whole document packet and like basket for me. And the way I felt was like,

[43:20] I'd never had a job do that. And they had like two days where they spent so much time with me.

[43:24] It was all structure. And it, I wanted to give more to them because of what I got there. And that

[43:29] was when it clicked for me. It's like, okay, when I build an organization, like the first impression

[43:33] of just like how much effort they're willing to put in, I didn't need half of it. Right. And I didn't

[43:37] end up using half that, but like that they were willing to. It made such a difference. It's just like feeling

[43:42] welcome because you're in your nervous and stuff. And so I'm glad it was helpful. I know the

[43:46] document was definitely overblown. And I did it out of completing anxiety of not wanting to. Oh, I was,

[43:51] it was awesome. Yeah. I was like, if this fails, it's my fault for sure. But that is the responsibility

[43:57] that the leadership takes. Right. That is, that is the responsibility because you spend all this time

[44:02] hiring, going to the process, making the person feel special, come on board. And then you're like,

[44:08] welcome. Okay. Good. Yeah. Or even the, you know, I think what a lot of people don't talk about. I

[44:13] prepared so much for issues with bringing, like telling people that you were coming in. Of like people

[44:18] being like, well, Lala, I want to work with you on this or I'm going to like this or like,

[44:22] who's this person? Like, what's going on? Like, how are we going to make decisions? Like, I was

[44:26] completely prepared for all of that. Because that's what so many people told me. Like,

[44:30] happens. And I was like, even though we have such a great culture and organization, like, I'm just

[44:32] need to prepare for it. And I think a lot of people, that's, that's actually where I spent,

[44:37] even probably just as much time, which was having the conversations with people 101,

[44:42] talking people, what does it mean? What does it not mean? What's changing? What's not changing?

[44:45] For individuals and then for the company. And I think that alone is where a lot of people fails

[44:51] is that they don't do the work when they're bringing in a new leader or a new partner to position them

[44:56] well to step into the organization and be welcome. Because a lot of times they do a couple things,

[45:00] which is like, one, they say it's going to be better with this person. I don't say any expectations,

[45:05] because I'm like, it's going to be different. Good job. Thank you for not doing that.

[45:07] I saw the worst was like, three years ago, when a leader would like replace themselves there,

[45:14] because we so much better with this project. You can't say that because it's going to at first feel

[45:18] so different. They're not going to, they're going to think, well, you said it was me better. It's

[45:21] day two, why is not better. It's like, well, they're new. What do you expect? It's like, well, you said.

[45:25] And so that's the first one was like, just don't say any of those expectations. Just say,

[45:28] it's going to be different. It's going to be a change. Here's what the change is going to look like.

[45:32] And I think the second piece, too, it is explaining how it, like the highly impacted individuals,

[45:38] how is it, what's going to happen and what's not going to happen? Like, what changes and what doesn't

[45:43] change. And I think that those are also really important to explain to people because a lot of people

[45:47] bring in someone like you and they're like, am I getting fired? Is this still happening? Like,

[45:51] what's changed? Like, there's all sorts of things that can go through a brain. So I always just try to

[45:55] come up with like, what are the things that what are the obstacles I anticipate ahead of time

[46:01] that I can just overcome before they even bring them to me. And I think that and itself

[46:06] paired with what you just said, like, if you do those two things, like you address, you do the

[46:10] communication plan for how you're going to communicate to the organization. And then there's a plan

[46:14] for when you bring the person in. I think that is how you set someone up for success. So when they walk in,

[46:19] people are excited for them to be there, not scared or not annoyed or frustrated or worried.

[46:26] Yeah. Yeah. I'm just excited for a CQ 3.0. A CQ point. That was your idea.

[46:33] Well, you coined it. That's your progression, right? It is the natural progression. I think that's that's

[46:38] really, I think that's a lot of stuff that people are going to start seeing us moving towards.

[46:44] When we elude to the big moves, we make that it comes with acquisition on com 3.0.

[46:49] But we're just preparing what do you call it? What do you say? Writing the ships? What's that

[46:54] turn? Digging the wall? I don't know. Digging the wall? Yeah. I see like as a progression of,

[47:02] like I would say, acqua's, you know, 1.0 was us helping ourselves directly. I would say 2.0 was

[47:10] us helping ourselves directly and helping everyone else indirectly. So it's like if you document all

[47:15] these things, we show what we're doing, that's going to help a lot of business centers indirectly. We're

[47:18] not the one actually like setting up, you know, like taking calls for them. We're like, hey, here's how we do

[47:22] it. And here's how we do our mark. Here's how we do our sales. Here's how we do these things in the business

[47:26] so we can help you grow and hopefully you know, hit your goals. And I'll say, you know, acquisition

[47:30] 3.0 is how can we help ourselves directly and help you directly. And so I see that as kind of the

[47:35] the vectors, which is kind of the natural progression. But in order to do that, you know, from the first

[47:40] time we met until now, the size of the quote indirect audience went from, you know, a few thousand

[47:47] to now, you know, tens of millions that have, you know, directly been in our, when I were versus

[47:52] the people were even in our interested demographic. And so in order to do it and do it right and

[47:58] maintain our reputation, which is, you know, we've worked, you know, a social long time to do,

[48:03] we want to make sure, you know, I'll try not to be crude, but that it's awesome and it's

[48:07] done right. And that if we can do that, then I think that we can, you know, get close to the kind of

[48:15] impacted, I think all three of us want to have because you said this earlier, but like,

[48:19] it's hard for people to comprehend. It's like, Trump really doesn't need to do anything. And we

[48:24] really don't need to work it all. We can just like live off the dividends from the buildings and

[48:29] the businesses that we own and like just work out of there. I'm so excited. How many years ago,

[48:34] and you were post-tiles, we were post-tiles, like, should we just do family offices, like just

[48:37] chill and that's what that was the original last, that's the original idea. And I know that was the

[48:41] real. It's weird. And then I was like, I got to give you a so, like, looking back, you're so, so small.

[48:45] Yeah. There's also very, I mean, nothing wrong with serving yourself. I mean, I want to be clear.

[48:49] Like, if you want to do that, for anybody who's listening, but by all means do it. But I think that

[48:53] to have, like, when I see the best entrepreneurs of all time, it's like, they're able to kind of

[48:59] like flip their selfish interest inside out so that it just kind of pulls the world. And I think

[49:05] that that's, I think it's something that all of us have wanted to do. And it just takes more than

[49:10] one or two people to do it and do it right.

[49:13] I just think, like, at the end of the day, you know, when I think about what we're building here

[49:18] and like how it started and such, I think it's because, you know, at the end of Jim Lont, for example,

[49:24] it we never, we didn't, you know, we got partners and then we were out, right? We never brought

[49:30] partners into the business to keep growing the business in a way that didn't feel completely

[49:37] exhausting. Because at some point, it's not, this isn't about the work that you do in the business.

[49:41] It's about the decisions, the judgment, the leadership, the experience. And that's, you know,

[49:47] it's not like when we're like, oh, Shoran's going to come and do so much work. Like it's like,

[49:50] I know you are because it's who you are. But it's like the judgment you bring, the decision making,

[49:54] the expertise, like you're thinking, you're brain, right? And I think at some point,

[50:00] especially like when we sold Jim Lont, like I was definitely at a point where like it had just

[50:03] run off the two of us. And I do think that I was at a point where I was like, I was okay for a minute,

[50:08] like in that brief moment of like thinking smaller because I was like, oh my, I was so tired.

[50:12] Like I was like, I was just like, I'm tired. Like I've been up since 4 a.m. going to bed at 8 p.m.

[50:16] and I'm a freaking gram on. Like it would be nice to just have something a little more a little less

[50:20] demanding of me, right? And it's funny because I look back and I'm like, it was just a skill deficiency,

[50:26] which is like, I didn't have the skill of doing a couple things. There's like building a team that

[50:29] allowed for me not to feel that way every day. And building a team where I actually, the like being

[50:34] tired of the end day was worth it because I had so much fun working with them as well as then,

[50:39] okay, maybe you shouldn't be the one making decisions all day. Like if I'm making 35 decisions a day,

[50:44] is that really a good thing to be doing at that point? And I knew it was it. Well, I think that

[50:47] goes to Alex's point of being having the undertown to it, right? And the crazy part is how many times

[50:56] have we all experienced this where we, this is me to be a part of, but you hired one person

[51:02] and that person did so good. Like man, everything is so much better because Michael's here. Like

[51:08] you, that happened, right? And when that happens, imagine that over and over and over and over again.

[51:15] And that's when you get to do so many powerful things. It's permanent. I got it's

[51:20] which then you have an organization. If I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it,

[51:23] I got it, I got it, and then all of a sudden you create the space to then say, well, I still got some

[51:27] stuff. Like I can still go get stuff. But then all those, I got it, let's you go get. And I think that's

[51:33] what allows you to build the future because so many entrepreneurs have this, their dream is really

[51:37] just to dream and never meet reality because they never have the opportunity to pursue it. Because

[51:41] they're still stuck, undertounted in the business because they're constantly feeling like they

[51:46] have to play whack-a-mole because they don't fully complete the cycle. Like they get a three-quarter

[51:51] solution. But you still kind of like leave parts of yourself behind because you know that

[51:55] someone has it fully got it. I think it's probably my what I feel most proud of the steam is just like,

[52:00] we just have such great individuals. You know, it's like everyone's so strong. And I think

[52:06] I used to be able to count on one hand how many strong people I had in the organization. And now it's

[52:11] like I would have to count on one hand how many weren't and I wouldn't have any to put on my hand right

[52:16] now. You know what I mean? Which is like I remember dreaming of that. And so I think at that point,

[52:21] then you're just like when we talk about the barrels, you know, I think to a degree it's like when you

[52:27] have the skills to build something amazing and excellent, you just realize at some point you just

[52:32] you just need to hook with other barrels so that you guys can help. You know, it's what I talk about a lot

[52:38] which is like you want a vision so big for something that you build that everyone's vision

[52:42] can sit inside of it. And I think right now we see the vision for acquisition.com 3.0 specifically

[52:48] and we all see how our visions for ourselves, our dreams fit inside of that vision. And that's

[52:53] that's when the magic happens. And I think it's you know, I'll say this with a jumping on the piggy

[52:57] back on on the talent piece which is that I think that whether you like it or not like I mean

[53:04] I talked to business owners that every day and they're like I want to help million people who's

[53:07] waiting and I'm like well you have one brick and mortar store that has a hundred customers. Like

[53:11] the gap between their I think it's not even a realistic dream. It's something that they say

[53:17] that other people say that's amazing and so that's why they keep saying it more so than they

[53:20] actually want to do it because if they actually want to do it they would be haped differently.

[53:23] And so they have like their thing they say and then what they actually believe is possible.

[53:27] And I think that when you bring when you get these other barrels in and you get more high quality

[53:33] talent you're scope your realm of believability expands. And so it's great to say hey we want to

[53:39] do this thing but like you know on some level like what is reasonable or what is feasible

[53:44] with our existing capacity. And so we still on some level still extrapolate forward or project

[53:49] forward based on what we already have. And so when you bring those other people in all of a sudden like

[53:53] your ability to see further like oh I would never have considered that but now that we have John

[53:58] where we have so and so like oh they can they we could actually connect these dots in a way that I never

[54:04] would have originally imagined because I would have thought I can't do that and I don't know anyone

[54:08] else who can't but then we meet that person you're like oh my god all these other huge chunky things

[54:13] now enter the realm of possibility and then it creates all these new connections that then

[54:17] expands the realistic vision rather than the someday that'll never happen. It's totally fair.

[54:24] Yeah the the one the one quote that Alex actually probably was say it better than me is

[54:32] this really hit me hard and I was I'm born a very driven person and in my 20s

[54:41] I I really believe that it was about the destination. In my 30s I realized it was about the journey

[54:46] and then finally in my older 40s I finally realized that just about the company and it is the

[54:53] people that you that you're with the people that you build with the people that you grow with the

[54:56] people that you can see more and farther with it's doing it with the great people is what makes

[55:03] you have the ability to outwork everyone else because if you think about the destination

[55:10] all the time you're like man I got that's what the grind is I feel like I'm grinding and I feel

[55:15] tired and resentful that's what happens because you don't have the company or then you go through

[55:19] this period of growth and everything is painful you're like at some point you're like I don't need

[55:24] to do this anymore right and then but when you have great company you're like well wait a minute

[55:29] if I don't know how to do this I can ask for help can someone else do I got it and then you realize

[55:34] that the the growing and the joyfulness become so much more multiply the reason someone asked

[55:40] me the see I said the reason why I finally believe that it's about the company is because of this

[55:44] one thing it allows me to work harder because there is no working smarter it's like you realize

[55:49] you have the company so you can work harder and that's what's super super powerful I feel that's so hard

[55:55] well the vision also expands because the timeline you think on it also expands because if you're

[56:00] miserable then you want the misery to end on some level and so you're like well I can only really

[56:05] think this far out because I don't want to do this for longer than this amount of period of time so

[56:10] then it creates this rush and this pressure to get it all done as fast as possible which is very like

[56:15] pushing energy like you're like I have to just keep driving even though I don't want to on the flip side

[56:19] if you're like I'm enjoying the company on this process it's like well in 20 years we can build

[56:25] whatever we want and so then it creates a lot more fun and you can dream bigger if you have

[56:31] enough I got it and with those I got it to enjoy those people then it's like well what do we want to do

[56:37] like let's like let's let's have let's have fun hey that's why I've like had zero feeling of rush

[56:43] without position calm it's just like if there's one thing it's like do what you love with people you love

[56:49] and it's like find people that like you would want to be around even if they didn't work in your company

[56:53] just big one like that has just been such a huge frame shift you know what I mean

[56:59] I do want to ask you something though I bet you people are wondering especially people who follow you

[57:04] how's your content going to change so so far the content has always been a very niche

[57:11] category king type content and the crazy part is we've had a chance to build you know a 1.5

[57:17] million-tam audience and build a billion-dollar business from it and Alex you talk about this right

[57:22] you go niche you can actually create a lot of revenue from it but I remember being at

[57:27] brunch with both of you and with my son Neil and the idea of making content about what you're

[57:35] working on that is the thing that I'm truly excited about I read this quote which was like

[57:40] to write the book you have to first live the book and which is that oh no I don't think this is

[57:46] one no I don't think that's mine no I don't think that's like the days of just like the days of

[57:49] Jim Rowan when you don't know you just you just kind of give Alex the credit for it but

[57:54] if you have to write the book you have to live the book and and what I'm really excited about is

[57:59] starting to just look at my calendar and just talk about what we are talking about like what do you

[58:04] and I are planning on launching is talking about what we are doing day to day and I think that is

[58:09] the thing that people are missing they don't see that they see the a lot of the how-to stuff which is cool

[58:15] but they don't see the what did you do to help your business grow so I'm looking forward to

[58:21] living the book and writing the book simultaneously heck yeah I'm excited too and I think also

[58:26] just like for everyone that follows you like you know it has been like niche content but like

[58:32] if you just take the word real estate out of any piece of your content like so many people come to

[58:36] our events and they're like saying they're oh I follow sure on like you can real estate like well

[58:39] no but he's got good no my your smart because that's what happened with Alex is like it really

[58:44] is a gym lunch I had I had a lawyer stop me and he's like yeah listen your podcast there's like

[58:49] the gym secret podcast and they were like yeah all applies and I was like well yeah but I say gym

[58:54] and membership rather than contract and services and they're like yeah you just swap the words like

[58:59] duh and I was like oh well that's great but I mean I'll just one of the things that also

[59:07] made fun unique for this situation is that he also had he understood content he understood personal brand

[59:13] which is how do you take like when you talk about unit accordance it's like okay you find somebody who's

[59:19] you know the micro-drawn at real estate which is a massive you know market but then also has the

[59:25] upside of running the businesses that capitalize on this opportunity which is pure private equity

[59:31] you know like how do we you know increase enterprise value within the business and the opposite

[59:35] self of the people of hiring the recruiting marketing sales all of those components but then there's

[59:39] also the like oh yeah and one of those companies was also a public company and so then there's the

[59:43] public securities public market which also he happened to have this experience of Goldman Sachs

[59:47] for years before that so he has kind of like the bottom-up approach of like what it's like on the floor

[59:53] of the of kind of like the businesses that do with the markets and then also being the target

[59:58] of of those those products and services that are sold so it's like this 360 view from a business

[60:03] perspective but then in terms of okay that's all amazing but maybe if Sharon were 80 he wouldn't

[60:08] be able to come into this you know our current context and understand the the dynamic nature of how

[60:14] businesses continually you know changing and evolving especially with where attention is going and how

[60:19] how to just how acquisition works in general right now and so you know real was built largely

[60:24] or at least in recent you know on the back of a lot of Sharon speaking engagements and his

[60:29] personal brand that brought in a lot of people to the company right and so being able to marry

[60:35] all of these ideas and then appropriately value each of them so that we could mix those things into

[60:40] the most valuable thing for an entire audience or you know consumer base is just like how do you

[60:48] recreate that it's like oh I just need another person who had you know who's an immigrant who

[60:52] isn't afraid to work came here you know was dumpster diving in the beginning and then also was

[60:59] able to go to one of the you know best schools in the US and then go to the best banker what

[61:05] is considered the best you know investment bank in the world and then also do the the private growth

[61:11] two times two a billion dollar level and do it publicly it's just like and also have the

[61:16] the personal brand and also be someone that we like really get along with and share the values it's like

[61:21] yeah let's just wait for the next Sharon before we before we try to work somebody into to do what we

[61:27] and so it's like you don't find another Sharon and if you do get the opportunity to find another

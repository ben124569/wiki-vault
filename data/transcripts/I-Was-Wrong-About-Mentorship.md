[00:00] I've had a lot of mentors in my career.

[00:02] Many of them were paid a few of them were free.

[00:04] The point of a good teacher is that the student does pass the teacher.

[00:08] I see this thing that happens all the time.

[00:09] When you are a kid and you learn arithmetic,

[00:11] first you learn your numbers and then you learn how to add,

[00:13] be level up and you learn how to multiply.

[00:15] And then you level up from there and you learn algebra.

[00:17] When you get to algebra, you don't think,

[00:19] man, my arithmetic teacher is a f*** idiot.

[00:21] I can't believe they didn't teach me this stuff.

[00:22] It's like, dude, you weren't ready.

[00:23] And you had to have the arithmetic in order to get to the multiplication.

[00:26] It's not that that teacher was an idiot.

[00:28] It's that that was the sequence.

[00:30] And so when you have a first teacher that teaches you the basics

[00:32] and then you have a more advanced teacher later,

[00:34] it doesn't mean you should shit on your first teacher.

[00:35] It's like that person got you ready to receive the next thing.

[00:39] Early you're on my career, I definitely did the other way.

[00:42] This guy didn't know anything, this guy is the guy.

[00:44] Rather than seeing it, like you would see any other thing that you'd have in school.

[00:47] I've had the opportunity and the gift of being able to mentor what everyone is saying.

[00:51] You know, provide advice, council, share my experiences.

[00:53] A lot of people hold me in a regard.

[00:55] And most people who are winners are competitive.

[00:58] It's just like who you are, right?

[00:59] You want to win, you want to beat everybody.

[01:00] Because that's part of the competitive drive.

[01:02] But I think there's like a there's a comma there that needs to get put in.

[01:05] Which is that you have to accept two things.

[01:08] One is that you are going to die and no one is going to remember.

[01:11] Like real real.

[01:12] 10,000 years from now no one's going to remember at all.

[01:15] Number two is that when you're at the end of your life,

[01:18] the people who are going to be your buyer,

[01:19] but I don't know the people who you've been pushed with the people that you helped.

[01:21] I know that I have passed a lot of the mentors that I've had in my career.

[01:25] In terms of financials, et cetera, early raw news to think that made me better than them.

[01:29] As I've had a couple more years and some more scars,

[01:32] I've realized something different, which is that I was only able to get better than them.

[01:36] Because they gave me the head start.

[01:38] Step on my shoulder, you can reach that next branch.

[01:40] I think I experienced a lot of joy knowing that other people don't have to suffer as much.

[01:45] Yeah, we're walking around outside yesterday and someone's like, dude,

[01:47] I did everything you have and we're doing four million dollars a year now.

[01:49] Like, he was like emotional, just knowing that it's happening.

[01:52] It makes stomaching the hard times easier.

[01:54] It feels like it's not just me trying to do this for myself.

[01:57] It's me trying to do this for a lot of people.

[01:58] If I'm failing over and over again at this thing, I know that once I figured out,

[02:01] I'll be able to help 100 people cheat code their way through it.

[02:03] And not spend five months figuring something out or two years figuring something out.

[02:06] Like, I was stuck at mid 30 million for three years.

[02:09] To everyone watching, they're like, boo, who?

[02:10] That's not the point.

[02:11] Is that there's another guy who's going to get to that point and he's going to move right past it.

[02:15] Like, in a blink of an eye because they'll have had the right advice that I didn't have.

[02:18] And I think that if the mentees and the mentors both see it that way,

[02:22] then the mentees will stop shitting on the mentors that help them.

[02:25] And the mentors will stop trying to hold back secrets that have propelled them further

[02:30] because the point is not that you're going to beat everyone.

[02:33] You're going to get really old and then you're going to die.

[02:36] As you're getting older, they're going to be people who are younger, who had a head start.

[02:39] And as long as the next guy honors the fact that that guy died on the battlefield

[02:43] to give him these lessons and come back.

[02:45] And they have to recognize that they're going to die on the battlefield too for the next generation to pass them.

[02:49] They have it easier than us.

[02:50] That's the point of progress.

[02:53] And so rather than lamenting that the next generation has it easier, I thought that what we all say,

[02:58] I want to make the world a better place.

[03:00] Well, that's what making the world a better place looks like.

[03:02] We say that this is our mission with our business.

[03:04] We want to make the world a better place.

[03:05] We want to make an impact.

[03:06] And then when it actually happens, we resent the kids for the fact that they didn't have it as hard as us.

[03:10] That was the point.

[03:11] My point is not to beat the progeny.

[03:13] A point is to forge as far as I can.

[03:16] Look back and be like, hey, watch after that whole watch after that rock.

[03:19] Keep going.

[03:20] Move through the path that we tread three times faster than we did because we already cleared all the trees.

[03:24] They get to the next non clearing and they have to start hacking away and hacking away and hacking away to force the next path.

[03:30] And then they become the mentors turn around and the next generation move six times as fast to cover my distance and their distance.

[03:37] If you look as if in the greatest success stories, a lot of them talk about their mentors.

[03:40] Warren Buffett had his mentor early on.

[03:42] The quick story on that was that he said, I'll work for you for free.

[03:44] And Paul Graham told him you're overpriced.

[03:46] He was the one who's going to be giving far more to this relationship.

[03:48] Even if Warren gave him his time, he's still was going to be on the losing side.

[03:51] But he still did it anyways because he recognized that Warren had a gift.

[03:54] Warren passed him in his career.

[03:56] You'll notice that Warren isn't like man.

[03:57] I'm so much better than Paul Graham.

[03:59] I passed that dude in my like 40s.

[04:01] He doesn't talk like that.

[04:02] We really do stand on the shoulders of the giants.

[04:04] When I think about like the gratitude that I have for the Gary Vs who 12 years older than I am,

[04:08] he's forged so much of this path that like, I didn't have to think about how am I going to create this whole thing.

[04:13] It's like he already had a blueprint and I can just start laying that out immediately execute.

[04:16] There are guys who we have in our portfolio right now who are in their 20s who are making twice when I was making it 30.

[04:22] But if they came to me below and then now they're above, that was the point.

[04:27] Gary V didn't have Gary V to mentor him on his career.

[04:31] I do right now.

[04:32] We all do.

[04:33] Many of us will pass Gary and I don't think Gary month.

[04:35] There's a 20 year old and might be you who's watching this and you've got me.

[04:38] That's the point.

[04:39] I'm still going to be hustling trying to beat you.

[04:40] Don't give me wrong.

[04:41] When I see guys who are in their 60s, I'm like man by the time I'm 60.

[04:43] I'm going to be 10 times as wealthy as that.

[04:45] 10 times the real estate.

[04:47] 10 times.

[04:48] Yeah.

[04:49] But if they had themselves as mentors, they would too.

[04:51] If you were mentees and the students that you have and the people that you help and the people that you teach don't move above you,

[04:56] it means that you're a bad teacher, not a good one.

[04:59] The new definition of success of a teacher that the students surpass the teacher and then get to the point where they're both looking together with his experience and his raw talent.

[05:07] Looking at the new landscape saying, alright, what do you think we should do?

[05:10] If this video changed your mind about some of the shit talking that you've done to a teacher or a mentor who was earlier on in your career,

[05:14] shoot that guy tax and be like, hey, like, first back, I appreciate you.

[05:17] I can't tell you one how much it means to the mentor when they get that taxed.

[05:20] And I also think too it'll help you spit out the poison that you had.

[05:23] That wasn't real.

[05:24] It was only made up of your head.

[05:25] I think if you can do those things, this video would have been a success.

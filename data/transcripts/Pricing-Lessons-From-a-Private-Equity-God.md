[00:00] What is going on everyone who be having a wacky Wednesday?

[00:02] I'm fired up today.

[00:04] I'm going to probably make a bunch of content because I've had like 10 straight days of events

[00:08] and I have all these questions that people are asking you to remind and little anecdotes

[00:10] that I shared that people found value in.

[00:12] So hopefully you don't mind me just sharing those things with you now.

[00:15] So the first two days were actually events that we attended in Spoke at, which is at

[00:20] Sassic Academy, Denmark, tells a vent.

[00:22] And I was fortunate enough to be at the speakers table, which was value in it of itself.

[00:27] And one of the people who was at the speaker's table with me was a man named Marcus Rivera.

[00:32] He was vistas former head of pricing, packaging, and products.

[00:36] So pretty much when they would acquire a company, he would be the guy that would go in and

[00:42] retool the entire kind of fulfillment, structure who they were serving, how they would break down

[00:47] the levels of membership, et cetera.

[00:49] And so for those of you who don't know what vistas is, vistas, I think the world's largest

[00:54] private equity firm for software.

[00:55] If you put their whole portfolio together, it's over 50 billion a year.

[01:01] There would be ranks third, I think, in the world behind Facebook and Amazon.

[01:05] So like for like software company.

[01:07] So they're really, really, really, really smart.

[01:10] And I was fortunate enough to sit next to this guy for two days, which was awesome for me.

[01:16] And one thing became really clear when we were having dinner.

[01:19] And so they have something called vSops, which is vistas.

[01:23] SOP. So they're kind of the standard operating procedures.

[01:27] And these things are so closely guarded.

[01:29] You need like retino scans and like there's like you only get access to certain numbers of them.

[01:34] If you're at certain levels and then you your access gets removed.

[01:38] It's like super top secret stuff.

[01:39] And this is literally how they create value, how they purchase companies,

[01:43] put their system on top, and then increase the value of that company.

[01:46] And so for them, their whole mantra is tripling their money in three years.

[01:50] So it's three and three.

[01:51] And so one of the things that he shared with me now, obviously he couldn't share like the intricacies.

[01:56] But the concept was really, really powerful for me.

[01:59] And I'll tell you how we applied it at gym lunch.

[02:02] And so one of the things that most companies don't do is they don't score their leads.

[02:09] They don't score their prospects.

[02:10] They don't score their customers based on the value of that customer.

[02:15] And so scoring them can be based on a number of characteristics, behaviors, etc.

[02:21] That that person shows to put them in a certain bucket.

[02:25] Right? And what Vista does with a count on is the fact that when they go into a company,

[02:31] when they're assessing a company in the diligence process,

[02:33] that they're going to learn more about that company, that the founder and the people in that company even know about it.

[02:38] And so if they do, as they parse out the data,

[02:40] and they start trying to find the veins or the buckets of the most valuable customers.

[02:44] Once they find those buckets that vein of customers that's more valuable,

[02:48] what they then do is they basically expand and focus on that vein of high LTV customers.

[02:54] Like it sounds simple.

[02:55] And one of the things that Mark was actually hit on a lot was like,

[02:58] he's like, we stick to simple, simple systems, simple processes.

[03:01] And so when we, when I've like said things like,

[03:04] the people who are the most advanced never don't do the fundamentals,

[03:07] I feel like I've seen this at like so many levels and seeing this from probably,

[03:11] you know, the biggest and probably biggest, you know,

[03:13] software turnaround, increasing value company out there is pretty cool.

[03:17] And so let me tell you what we did to kind of go through this process.

[03:22] And so Mark was explaining that they don't even just do it for customers.

[03:25] They do it for prospects, opportunities, and customers.

[03:30] So three different segments they're going to look and score at each part of the pipeline.

[03:36] All right, using the analytics that they have and the teams that they did.

[03:38] Now you're like, okay, cool, that's awesome.

[03:40] Alex, how does this make more money at my gym?

[03:43] And so let me tell you how we're applying it right now.

[03:45] And so what we did is we took the last 90 days.

[03:48] I think it was July, July, August, September, or maybe it was September.

[03:54] I think yeah, I think it was July, August, September.

[03:56] So it took a 90 day block of time.

[03:59] And we looked at all of our exits, all of our escalations.

[04:03] What the, what the people who kind of kind of suck the most are people who didn't get the most results

[04:07] ever we want to put it.

[04:08] But people were the hardest to serve and who got the least results using our program.

[04:13] And then we looked at the, the, the controversy, the, the reverse of that.

[04:17] What were the characteristics of the people who made the most money, who got the highest returns,

[04:21] who were the easiest to work with, right?

[04:24] And so what we found here is some unsurprising facts.

[04:28] If you are not a gym owner, right?

[04:30] You don't do as well as people who are gym owners, crazy, crazy facts, right?

[04:35] And we also learn that if you're not full time in your gym and you have a job outside and you're

[04:40] trying to do a gym as a side hustle or something, you don't do as well as people who are fully

[04:45] committed to their gym.

[04:46] If you don't have a sign of lease or a building of your own, you don't do as well as someone who

[04:50] has a building of their own, right?

[04:52] And if you don't have any employees, it's harder for you to do this mostly because there's a huge

[04:58] time constraint, right?

[04:59] Like it takes effort to implement new systems because not only do you have to keep your existing

[05:03] business going, you have to start working on top of that in order to dig yourself out of the hole,

[05:07] right?

[05:08] And so when we found those characteristics, what we started doing is we started filtering and

[05:13] qualifying our front end.

[05:14] And so we started doing this for the month of October, all right?

[05:17] So we took the 90 days, we took the findings and then we implemented it for the month of

[05:21] October, right?

[05:22] Now we're in November and what's crazy is this from the previous four weeks.

[05:28] So in September the last four weeks compared to after we started doing this qualification,

[05:34] there's two crazy numbers I'm going to share with you.

[05:37] One is once we qualify prospects that they had to have at least 25 clients, they had to

[05:42] have a sign of lease, they had to be a full-time gym owner, right?

[05:45] And ideally this was optional, but ideally have one employee or more who worked with them so that they

[05:50] could share the load and so that they could actually focus more on selling and, you know,

[05:54] work leads, et cetera, when we looked at the after-effective that, our sales decreased from

[06:02] over 100 a month in terms of gyms to about 40 to 50, right?

[06:06] Now here's where it gets interesting, all right?

[06:08] So that cut our inflow in half by qualifying our customers, right?

[06:12] By by really making sure that the people were coming in were the best fit who could serve the best,

[06:17] right?

[06:18] Here's what's cool on our side now that we've done this in the first four weeks.

[06:21] In the four week period, since then the people who started after those qualifications,

[06:28] we've had zero escalations from those people. Prior to that, we had 22 escalations as in people who

[06:39] were having issues, you know, whatever, you know, I mean just red flags, right?

[06:44] The the prior four weeks. So from 22 to zero, now think how crazy this is in terms of scaling a business

[06:52] and operational complexity as you go up, right? So we had this huge vein of people who were taking

[06:59] the vast majority of my teams time and were actually worth less, right? They made less, they were worth

[07:06] less to us. And so when you're thinking about scaling and maintaining operational efficiency and profit,

[07:13] if you're looking at the customers that that are the highest lifetime value, the best customers,

[07:18] right? And here is what's crazy. The people, so after that October date, we switched back to

[07:24] the defined in program, which is what we did for, you know, three years. So we did a brief

[07:28] stint where we, where we basically signed people up for a year up front because we wanted to give

[07:32] them everything. It was a trial. We did a 90 day sprint and it turned out that that didn't work

[07:37] near as well as having to find it. And it's kind of the same way we were at the gym, just like having

[07:40] to find in program tends to be a little more, it's a little bit easier for people to rub.

[07:44] Her head's around, a little more defined in terms of the skills that they need to acquire, etc.

[07:48] But what's interesting is that the people who came back in were actually paying more than the people

[07:54] who were paying more than the people who we were letting them before. So this new vein of

[08:01] question, whose higher qualified is paying more is making more, requires less work.

[08:08] Now that sounds like a recipe for a higher profit business, right? It also sounds like a recipe

[08:12] for better happier customers. And so also what happens is if you think about it for a reputation

[08:17] standpoint, you're, if you lower the bar too much, then what happens is you bring in people who are

[08:22] not qualified, right? They take up more of your team's time, they cost you tons of effort. And

[08:29] they're not making as much, which means that then they say like your thing is not as good, right?

[08:34] When in reality, it might just not be as good for them, right? Which makes sense.

[08:38] And I mean, like it makes intuitive sense. And so I just like sharing these, these mistakes

[08:42] slash learns with you so that maybe I can look back on this 10 years from now, I'm be like, hey,

[08:46] I remember when we started doing that. But now what our focus is is cool. We know who the best

[08:52] customers for us are. And it's like, dear God, why did this take us three years to do this?

[08:56] You know, like, you know, learn from my stupidity. And hopefully you can start doing this with your own

[09:02] and now we're just going to focus double down on that main of customers and try and expand that.

[09:08] But really focusing on them in multiple platforms, right? And so I say this to say, if Vista has

[09:15] repeatedly been able to go from, I mean, they're not a super old firm. You know, from basically

[09:20] nothing, although we had a 50 billion in a very short period of time, it's because they know how to

[09:25] extract and amplify value. And the biggest thing is not to, I mean, they do sure they tweak the

[09:31] pricing, they find the right buckets, et cetera. But they do that by analyzing the customers better

[09:36] than the business that they're purchasing, even knows their own customers. And so I'll challenge you.

[09:42] Now this may sound like super, it'll help you. But it's not. All you have to do is look over the last

[09:46] three months, okay? Look at the people who left your business, all right? And this is where you get the

[09:50] best data from all the people who leave, right? So look at the data from people who left your business,

[09:56] trying to get, like, to think about as, as many characteristics as you possibly can,

[09:59] which they're age, what's their, you know, what's their job, what are their goals, what are their

[10:04] goals, what are they signed up for, how much money down did they start with? What did they sign up for

[10:09] in terms of their continuity, et cetera? And if you can, if you could piece those things together,

[10:14] then you're going to get a really good idea of who the good customers are and who the

[10:20] bad customers are. And it's okay to have a stern line because we're doing this now.

[10:26] Now the thing is, is like, in the short term, you can be like, oh my gosh, my inflocat in half.

[10:30] But so did all my operational overhead and the issues that, like, all that work that the team had to

[10:36] put together to try and service these people who were not necessarily the best fit. Right? And so

[10:43] I share that with you and I'll give you one more tidbit that I learned from him. And so we learned

[10:48] this from the, from the whole event, which we took as a huge takeaway for us that you can totally

[10:52] apply to your gym, is that customers in a recurring base business are really any business,

[10:58] decide whether they're going to stay at two points in the beginning of your life cycle.

[11:03] All right, between the sale and when they start getting the thing, right, the service, the

[11:09] whatever. And once they start using the product, the implementation are onboarding period.

[11:16] So in that period, so if you're doing an orientation with your clients, right, they buy something.

[11:22] All right, the time between the purchase and when they start getting the thing which be orientation,

[11:27] and the actual orientation itself is typically when people are already making the decision of

[11:33] when they want, whether they're going to stay with you in the long haul. All right,

[11:37] which means if right now, you just think your, your orientation is an aftermath. It's like,

[11:43] oh yeah, now we have to fulfill that thing we sold, you're screwed, right? You're getting

[11:48] by just on the fact that like you're, you have enough volume in the door, but you're losing massive

[11:52] amounts of money by not making that a completely choreographed experience that you're really

[11:57] focusing on over delivering a value. And the way to do that is to demonstrate the skills that

[12:04] they're going to need to be able to use to use your services, right? And so whether that like

[12:10] the not just, not just saying, hey, yeah, you should download this app, yeah, you'll figure it out,

[12:14] but actually doing it with them, holding their hand, and then having them duplicate the process

[12:20] so that you can see that you've transferred the skill to them so that they now know and they

[12:25] are self sufficient in being able to consume your services, right? And so if your onboarding is rushed,

[12:32] right, your orientation is rushed, then expand the time period because it's going to massively

[12:37] multiply the lifetime value that customer at the likelihood that they're going to stay with you.

[12:42] So this is one of those few times where you don't want to be lazy and not, and not deliberate

[12:47] in intentional in how you're onboarding the customer after you complete the sale. So the communication

[12:53] that you have within immediately after the sale, which is like sending them a personalized video,

[12:57] you know, giving them swag, maybe a letter, whatever it is, definitely texting them between the

[13:02] time that they make the sale or you make the sale and when they start the onboarding.

[13:06] And the second piece I'm already going back to the beginning is the sale itself. And so what we're

[13:11] learning internally for us to gym lunch and this may seem obvious, but maybe I'm sharing it with you

[13:15] because we're learning it too is that expectations are everything, right? Expectations are everything,

[13:22] and if you set proper expectations for what is going to happen next, and then you fulfill that

[13:26] beautifully, you're trust with the prospect goes up. Now here's where you can get tricky, right?

[13:32] And this is what we call selling hot. It's where you set expectations so high, it's impossible for you

[13:39] to ever fulfill or for you to hit that with the majority of customers, right? And so

[13:45] this is where selling towards behavior and selling towards sustainability and long-term change,

[13:51] comes really into place so that you can shift and break the beliefs of your prospect

[13:56] to shifting their time frame to what is really going to be beneficial for them rather than

[14:02] simply trying to sell them to say yes, right? And so an example of this is, you know, for us,

[14:08] if someone has only consumes testimony and we've changed this in our marketing, we've changed this

[14:14] in our testimonials, we've changed it in the post that we tag people in, is that we're really no

[14:19] longer focused on saying like, hey, look at these 10 people who made 100 grand in their first,

[14:25] you know, six weeks with us, right? We have those, right? We totally do, but the thing is is like,

[14:30] but what are the averages, right? And so now we just share with the average Jim does, all right?

[14:35] And it's significantly less, you know, appealing. I think the average Jim right now is like they

[14:39] do 16,000 in their first six weeks with us, right? Now that's a lot, but it's not 100 grand in

[14:46] your first month. And showing what the average Jims are getting in terms of lead costs and lead flow

[14:51] gives people at least an average understanding. And we can explain to the person that means that

[14:55] half the people who's on up get less than this, right? This is the average. And so that way,

[15:02] if you, if and when you do go above that mark, then their expectations are reasonable and you can't

[15:09] over-deliver, right? And in an ideal world, you would probably try and sell on the bottom 25% of

[15:16] results so that the expectations are so low that everyone is excited about the fact that they're

[15:22] over-achieving from that, from that baseline that you have set for them. And so what I've like,

[15:28] I'm continuing to learn in this, I like, I want to write like a whole presentation of expectations,

[15:32] but expectation management is everything, right? It's amazing what happens if you set

[15:39] really high expectations. And like this is where this is where someone makes $20,000 in their first

[15:44] month and is disappointed with Jim launch. And we've had this happen plenty of times, right? They're

[15:50] like, well, this sucks. I thought I was going to do better, right? When in reality, that's fucking

[15:55] amazing, right? In terms of the big scheme. Now, maybe this resonates with you because you've had

[16:02] someone who loses five pounds in their first 14 days with you and they're disappointed. Now,

[16:08] why would they be disappointed? Only one reason, because the expectations that were set for them in

[16:13] the sale and in the orientation were too high for the average person and then most people are

[16:19] disappointed with what would otherwise be considered an amazing great start. And so if you can reset

[16:25] the expectations that are being put on the customer in the sale, right? And you sell around the fact,

[16:32] not around yourself through the fact and you break the belief around what the

[16:35] expectation should be in a short and long term vision so that you can shift their expectations

[16:39] towards long term change and a process and behavior change so that they get ultimately achieved

[16:44] what they want, which is being fit forever, not fit for the next six weeks or six months, right?

[16:49] And so all that to say, the big takeaways that we have at Jim launch is that we are now heavily

[16:55] qualifying people on the front end so that we have longer lifetime value, we have superior

[16:59] client outcomes, we have less operational complexity because these people have the right characteristics

[17:04] of people who are successful, both externally in terms of like what they have their Jim,

[17:09] but internally in terms of how they work and how like what level of effort they're willing to put

[17:14] into be successful, right? We found out that launch printers are not a very good demographic for us and

[17:20] so it's like cool, we're not going to service them, right? Or not going to service them in this way,

[17:25] maybe we'll create an infot product that's less for them so that they can go through it at their

[17:30] own leisure, their own timeframe rather than the intense time frame that we put onto people

[17:36] when they start Jim launch because it's really like ready fire go, you know, you have 72 hours

[17:41] and leads are starting to come in, right? And that's how we do things to Jim launch because that's how

[17:45] I am, right? But we have now used this on the qualification side and then also how our sales

[17:51] people are tagging and setting expectations and then being extremely deliberate and we're still

[17:56] working on this and making the onboarding and implementation even more choreographed and we have a

[18:01] pretty darn choreographed orientation process but even better, even more reinforced, even simpler,

[18:07] so that the handoff is seamless so that everyone knows exactly what is going to happen before

[18:12] it happens and then they know exactly what is going to happen next in their experience with us and

[18:17] so you can use this all these lessons that we're learning right now in your business so that you can

[18:23] increase the quality of the customer set the expectations properly and then over deliver on the

[18:28] expectations that you've set so that they can make the decision in the first two or three meetings with you

[18:32] that they're going to stick with you for the long long. So I hope this is valuable for you, like it,

[00:00] I'll make this a short one for you.

[00:02] I just got off a call with a convenient I have a best of interest in.

[00:07] And so we were talking about how to set up the management metrics in place for the business

[00:13] as we're trying to scale it.

[00:14] And so one of the things that picked up from Andy Grove in what is about high output management,

[00:20] I think, is paired metrics.

[00:24] And it was just a great epiphany for me.

[00:27] And so I'm going to share it with you.

[00:29] So the way that any Grove who's the founder of Intel, very smart, dude, manages each of the

[00:34] roles within the company is that he tries to put paired metrics in place.

[00:37] So it's not just number of sales or just closing percentage or just insert one thing here.

[00:45] Most times, and this is just myself included, I would usually just be like, this is the one

[00:49] key metric that I want to look at, right?

[00:50] This is the one thing that matters for this position.

[00:53] But you think a little bit more about it, it tends to be two that are in parallel.

[00:59] And so what it does is helping you manage the balance or the dichotomy between the

[01:03] performance and the role.

[01:04] And typically, it'll be between speed or output in terms of total volume and quality.

[01:10] All right.

[01:11] And so the way that you balance this within any position would be, for example, if you're

[01:15] talking to a salesperson, it would be total number of sales against refunds backouts.

[01:21] All right.

[01:22] If you're looking at a customer service position, it might be speed of ticket resolution

[01:27] or total number of ticket handels and customer satisfaction or NPS or so like a promoter

[01:34] score, right?

[01:35] So that would be a balance between two different metrics that you're looking at.

[01:40] And then that way, because at the end of the day, you never really want it because a lot

[01:44] of times in business, it's not about either extreme.

[01:46] It's about managing a dichotomy of being, am I being micro managing or am I delegating too much,

[01:51] right?

[01:52] Like, is either them wrong?

[01:53] No, you want to follow kind of right in that middle path.

[01:56] And in different times, you might lean towards one area or the other area more.

[02:01] But when you're looking at each component of the business, you can look at balance metrics.

[02:06] And so I'll break down more examples to think of my views before you.

[02:10] So if you're looking at a marketing position, it's going to be total number of applications

[02:14] against qualified applications, right?

[02:17] So it's like, okay, this is the total volume I got, but how many work qualified, right?

[02:22] Next would be sales guy, which I just went over, like total sales volume or closing percentage

[02:26] against backouts, right?

[02:28] The service position, total number of responses and or tickets handled or customer

[02:35] complaints resolved or speed of resolution against the quality score, right?

[02:41] On the back end, let's say, I'm trying to think of other positions that you can have for

[02:45] this.

[02:46] I mean, like, right now, I'm obviously simply keeping my eye.

[02:51] But if you think about every piece of your business right now, all of the people that report

[02:55] to you, there's typically a metric that you're trying to push, but something you're trying

[02:59] to also conversely not have happened.

[03:02] And so if you can define both of those things for the person, then you can push as hard

[03:07] as you can on the top side, right?

[03:11] The speed or the volume metric and balance it.

[03:13] So another example is if you're in a physical products business, it would be inventory against

[03:18] shortages, right?

[03:19] And I'm going to have tons and tons of inventory because that's not good.

[03:21] You have lots of cash that's sitting there.

[03:23] It's not good for the business.

[03:24] It's dangerous for the business.

[03:26] But if you just say, hey, I want you to just keep my inventory as low as possible, right?

[03:31] Then you're going to start having shortages, right?

[03:33] And so you want to balance inventory against shortages.

[03:35] And then that's the metric that you're reporting on for that position, right?

[03:39] So for me, that would be my finest department who's managing that component of our business

[03:42] in the supplement side, right?

[03:46] Taxes versus audits, right?

[03:49] Or any kind of issue that you have the IRS.

[03:51] And so with each of these things that have the positive thing what you're going for against

[03:55] the negative thing you're trying to avoid.

[03:58] And so I want to call this the sweet spot which clearly I didn't, and I'll name it later.

[04:03] But that's the management economy in management using parallel metrics.

[04:07] It will get you so much closer to the sweet spot about some performance for each of these

[04:11] roles.

[04:12] Also going through the mental exercise for yourself will help you to find those things

[04:16] for each of the roles in your business.

[04:19] And ultimately, the only thing that's going to allow you to scale the business if you're

[04:23] in the service space, which many of the people who are listening is R, is initially it's

[04:27] going to be your ability to train people and onboard people, right?

[04:30] So it's from your culture and your training, your training gets them up and going, culture

[04:33] keeps them going, right?

[04:35] And then the keeping them going is making sure that you're monitoring the right things

[04:39] for them so that you can get the outcome that you really want, right?

[04:43] And so I just had this call with the founder of that business that I'm now invested in.

[04:48] And we were talking about how we're setting that business up to scale so that each of the

[04:52] roles that we have get balanced out.

[04:55] And so for there we have image editors so we can see the total number of images they're

[04:59] edited, the photography based business, against the number of callbacks or corrections that

[05:05] need to happen.

[05:06] And so you can see this in virtually every position that exists within your business.

[05:10] But if you simply look at that, name them and explain it to the person, then they'll understand

[05:14] everything that you want and then you'll ultimately make more money and then they will

[05:18] feel like they have more clarity.

[05:19] And if they don't understand how to do those things, then you train, right?

[05:23] And that's the entire, that's the whole game.

[05:25] If you train them, you give them the two metrics, you walk the middle and then that is how

[05:30] you maintain high level performance over an organization.

[05:33] So shout out to Andy Grove for being smarter than me.

[05:37] Hopefully that was useful for you.

[05:38] For me that was a huge takeaway when I was going through this book.

[05:42] And so use it, make money, have higher profits, have a happier team, have a happy Wednesday,

[05:47] lots of love, it's just you.

[00:00] If I were 85 years old and I got to go through a time machine and be back in my body as I am now to experience my life.

[00:08] From my 85-year-old self, it's dramatically shifted how I see everything.

[00:11] So let me walk you through it.

[00:13] I've struggled to feel grateful for most of my life. It's not that I don't have things to be

[00:16] grateful for. I've tons of things to be grateful for. But I don't feel gratitude.

[00:20] And so I've tried a lot of different practices to try and feel gratitude. You know the journals

[00:25] and the daily meditations and things like that. But they've never really stuck. That's not to say

[00:29] that they don't work for some people. But I want to share with you in this video is one of the most

[00:33] powerful perspective changes that I've ever experienced. And if you don't know why I am my name's

[00:37] Alex Shmozi, I'm the managing partner at Acquisist.com, which is a portfolio of companies that

[00:41] does over $100 million a year. I make these videos because I hope that you make all the money

[00:44] in the world and you experience all the joy that you possibly can in the process. I have spoken in the

[00:48] past about the frame of the veteran, which I won't recap here. But it's really just having different

[00:52] frames or perspectives through which to see circumstances so that you can improve your experience.

[00:57] Recently I've been trying to toy with one that would create gratitude. There's a clip that

[01:02] went pretty viral, not that long ago. It's also my number one tweet of all time, which is when I was

[01:06] 20, I wanted to be a millionaire. Now that I'm a millionaire, I want to be 20. When I'm 85 years old and

[01:12] in my mind, I imagine I will be a multi-billionaire at that point, I know that I would give up

[01:17] everything that I have with material wealth just to be poor in 20 again. I called this the

[01:22] frame of the grandfather or the grandfather frame and it works like this. If you've ever looked at

[01:28] pictures from your past and you look at where you grew up or you look at your old room or you look at

[01:33] a picture of you with old friends doing something. We tend to feel these feelings of nostalgia.

[01:38] And I tried to quantify what is nostalgia. So to me, nostalgia is gratitude in the present

[01:44] will pass circumstances. For whatever reason, we're able to kind of look past all of the kind of

[01:49] menuship, how we were feeling, our moods, and we're able to kind of like see big picture of the

[01:54] things that we are grateful for. Take a pause here, I'm sure all of us have tons of childhood

[01:58] shit and things that we wish were different in Bob, Bob, but there are still elements of our past,

[02:02] our childhood, our adolescence, our teenage years, our college years, whatever it is, right?

[02:06] Where you feel grateful. Some of you guys are superstars and are always great for

[02:10] friving and I'm, you know, I'm jelly. I don't roll that way. It's not like a wake up and I'm like

[02:15] man, I just want to count my luck and stars. Like I just don't, that's just not how I function.

[02:18] And I've been trying this on and I hope you do too because it's been, it's been really like

[02:22] improving my life. I tried to do this or wake up thinking to myself, if I were 85 years old

[02:28] and I got to go through a time machine and be back in my body as I am now to experience my life

[02:34] from my 85 year old self seeing it again. If I wake up and I feel my body and I'm like,

[02:40] ah, this is so nice. I don't have all the joint pain. My wrist don't have arthritis. And then I wake

[02:47] up and I'm like, I remember when we used to live here. Even when I looked at Layla this morning,

[02:51] I said, get in myself man. Like this is my wife right at the beginning of our marriage. You know,

[02:55] only six years in. The wake up and we walk over to, you know, to have our coffee in the morning

[02:59] which we always do. And I'm like, isn't this so nice? I remember when you step coffee here

[03:03] together. This is great and I look out the window. Look how young Vegas looks. It doesn't have

[03:07] all these buildings and these flying cars like it does now. It's, it's so underdeveloped compared

[03:11] to what it is today. And I feel gratitude for an external just environment which I would never really

[03:17] think though. But I know that my 85 year old self will totally appreciate those things. And as I'm

[03:20] going through the day, applying that frame also to business where I can see the, you know, the CEO's

[03:24] of our companies and the people that work within our holding company at aquisers.com, they're stressed

[03:28] about things and in my mind I'm thinking, ah, isn't this cool that we get to do this together?

[03:33] And that fun is the neat look how cute that is. It is the most powerful frame that I've encountered.

[03:38] I think the reason it's so powerful is one that operates almost entirely from a frame of gratitude

[03:43] that for me I can feel. For whatever reason gratitude journals, the meditation sticks like that, like,

[03:47] I don't feel that. But thinking about my 85 year old self being able to re-experience life

[03:53] through my 32 year old body, it's really shifted how I see things. And also decreases the amount of

[03:58] anxiety and stress I have over outcomes because I'm like, this isn't going to matter in the long

[04:02] run. I also think it helps from a business that term loosely but like a business wisdom perspective.

[04:07] Because when you think about the decisions, you think about it with an older context of your life.

[04:11] And you're not like, oh yeah, I'm going to make that short term dollars because you're like,

[04:14] I'm 85. I don't have anything to prove. You don't even mean. If you think about like the really

[04:18] stressful things that you've had happen in your past, I feel nostalgia for the sleeping one of

[04:23] the floor that I did at my gyms, for how tired I used to be at the end of the day of taking 20

[04:28] plus concerts for months and months and months on end. And rather than feeling stressed about it

[04:32] or resening the fact that I have to do it, like I get to do this. I get to make videos talking to a

[04:37] camera. Look at my 32 year old self-go, trying to make his content, trying to help other entrepreneurs.

[04:42] Like, I'm in a cool, if I had to characterize seasons of my life, I would say I was very angry

[04:46] as a teenager and young adult. And then I went from angry to being aware of the deficit between

[04:53] where I was and what I considered to be happiness. From there, I kind of switched to what I

[04:57] have affectionately called the fuck happiness mantra, which I lived for very long period of time,

[05:01] which was I stopped trying to optimize for happiness at all and just really stop thinking about it all

[05:05] together. Which I think moved me closer to something that I would consider to be joy. You can be joyful

[05:10] independent of circumstance because joy is from within happiness tends to come from external,

[05:14] right? It comes from circumstance. And I think when we look at the grandparents, or at least the

[05:18] people that are older that I aspire to be, they just have an internal joy. They have gratitude

[05:23] for being able to live it one last time. Because they end up the day like, it is our last time.

[05:29] I'm being real here. Like, I've had a guy that I graduated with died a few months ago.

[05:35] And he was a really successful guy, really smart kid, did really well. I mean, this is really

[05:42] dark, but he got randomly murdered. And, you know, he had grandparents for his life. And I think

[05:48] to myself, I'm like, you know, tomorrow really isn't guaranteed. Thank you for your attention. I know

[05:52] you have a lot of places that you can put it. And I'm grateful that you chose to share the moment with me.

[05:56] So, those are the nations. Appreciate you guys. Bye!

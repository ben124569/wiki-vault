[00:00] I wanted to make another little video for you because it was on my mind and I thought it was

[00:04] I was talking something else about the story and I figured I might as well show you guys.

[00:09] So, some of you guys might know we were just at the Sun of Hanging Live event, we were some of the speakers

[00:15] who talked about high-tech sales.

[00:17] And we won one of the awards which is like it's called the Axel Ward which is, it means

[00:23] you did over 10 million in sales.

[00:26] Which is pretty cool.

[00:27] I mean we were excited about it but I mean it's awesome.

[00:31] But the thing that happened afterwards is where I kind of want to bring the last

[00:35] out of home.

[00:36] So, I had a couple of people after we spoke and we were kind of showcased as kind of a

[00:41] success or a type thing.

[00:42] They were like, hey, could you consult for my business?

[00:45] I'd like to do something like this in my space and car park, or in dentists, or blah, blah, blah,

[00:49] right.

[00:50] And people offered to pay us 50,000 for a single day.

[00:55] We had two people come up and offer that for us to kind of coach them on their business,

[01:00] help them scale up and start doing it.

[01:02] I take it whatever.

[01:04] And my wife, before I even had a chance to answer the question, step forward and said, no,

[01:11] we don't do that.

[01:12] And I wanted to kind of highlight why it was important and why that kind of attitude has

[01:20] helped us grow so fast.

[01:21] And so, what happens is you continue to scale and continue to make more money.

[01:26] Continue to have stuff that works is that the better you are, better the opportunities that

[01:30] you have to say no to are.

[01:32] And so, what happens is especially as entrepreneurs a lot of times we see things that

[01:35] were like, man, this would be so cool.

[01:37] I have like six businesses and like, no, I'm really making money.

[01:39] But like, I don't know what's one I'm going to do, but I'm going to invest in all of them

[01:42] and like, I'm going to see what's going to take off.

[01:44] But like, that's fundamentally flawed because you as an entrepreneur can make any business

[01:48] take off and any single business can be as big as you want it to be.

[01:51] And so all you're doing when you're deluding your attention is you're deluding your attention

[01:54] and then ultimately you're ensuring that none of them will work.

[01:58] And so, we turned down these 250,000 dollar a day consulting clients because the attention

[02:04] that that would take is going to take more from our business than it will give us.

[02:09] And making decisions in that way has been probably the number one thing that has grown

[02:13] as to where we are now.

[02:14] I can't tell you the amount of guys who I think are going to be.

[02:17] Then we are.

[02:18] And it's because they can't focus.

[02:21] Like they cannot focus.

[02:22] They can't stick to one thing.

[02:23] They do launch after launch.

[02:24] They switch product, they switch industries, they switch customer avatars, they're like,

[02:27] well, I'll think about doing this and I'll start doing this.

[02:29] And they just can't stick with it.

[02:33] And if you look at our business, right?

[02:34] And if you look at our gym model and then if you look at our current gym launch business,

[02:38] it's all about doing the same thing over and over and over again.

[02:41] And it's so boring.

[02:42] It's so boring.

[02:43] Right?

[02:44] All you do is you get really good at doing one thing and then that's it.

[02:47] And as much as you want to do the next thing, all you do is you go back to that first thing

[02:50] and you do it better and you do it better.

[02:52] Right?

[02:53] And that's all you do as you continue to scale.

[02:55] If you look at the difference between a $30 million business and a $100 million business,

[02:57] so right now we're on this for a $30 million run rate is where we're at now.

[03:01] If you look at that versus a $100 million business, they're virtually the same.

[03:07] The only thing that changes is that a $100 million business does more of the same thing.

[03:12] They just do more instead of having tens of five sales a day, they do 15 sales a day.

[03:16] That's it.

[03:17] It's the only difference.

[03:18] They're not doing new verticals.

[03:19] They're not constantly trying to sell different things.

[03:23] They usually focus on the same customer avatar and they sell the same problem with

[03:27] a really good solving, they sell it better.

[03:29] And that's it.

[03:30] And so by us turning down these $250,000 a day, consulting deals, I can guarantee you

[03:35] that having that is what has been some of the reason for our successes that we've been able

[03:40] to focus on doing one thing for you to not look at if you're a gym owner, not look

[03:45] at online training, not look at meal prep services, not look at all the many things that

[03:51] you can do that will distract you.

[03:54] Doing this JV, you're doing this 50-50 thing with my buddy who's got this little thing

[03:58] going on the side, they're always things.

[04:02] But I can guarantee you that they always have strings attached and the strings are attached

[04:05] to your attention.

[04:08] And that's the most valuable asset you have.

[04:09] And I have time with your attention.

[04:11] And so even if we did do this $50,000 consulting day, even if we did do this $50,000

[04:15] consulting day, what would end up happening is that person after that day, the difference

[04:22] was still trying to take attention.

[04:24] And ultimately what that will do, it will allow us to fulfill on the promise that we made

[04:28] to our initial gym owners who came to us.

[04:31] And so if I take that same amount of attention, and then I put it towards the existing model

[04:35] we have, and brick by brick continue to stack, don't make more and more and more focusing

[04:40] on those fundamentals than you want anything else.

[04:43] So sometimes you got to do more of the do less and add them towards it.

[04:47] Sometimes you got to go slow to go fast.

[04:49] And I really believe in that in the high-end line.

[04:50] He was a COO of a $10 billion company, the B, $10 billion.

[04:55] And I'm not an extended period of time where I was working really, really closely with him.

[04:59] And I learned a lot of things from him.

[05:00] And that was one of them.

[05:02] Because I sometimes get to go slow to go fast.

[05:04] And sometimes you just got to get good at one thing.

[05:07] And all you have to do is focus on doing that thing more and more to spite.

[05:09] Being an entrepreneur and wanting to do lots of things.

[05:11] But once you make the most money or the once you're released, and by at least I'm not saying

[05:16] you don't work.

[05:17] I'm saying you do the least amount of things.

[05:18] And you just do a few things extremely well.

[05:20] So double down on that.

[05:21] Don't get distracted with Shiny objects.

[05:23] The better you are, the better the opportunities you have to say no to.

[05:26] So keep that in the back of your mind.

[05:28] Say no to the meal prep service.

[05:29] Say no to the online training thing.

[05:31] Say no to the training from afar.

[05:32] Say no to the little corporate deal that you might be able to set up.

[05:38] Because they will distract you from the main thing because those are not the end goal.

[05:42] And if you have the gym, you're going to get an amazing results.

[05:44] Get them, send more people to you.

[05:46] Do that over and over and over and over again.

[05:48] And then one day you will look up and you'll be really, really, really, really, really

[05:50] that's the point.

[05:51] All right.

[05:52] So awesome.

[05:53] A lot of us are just used to struggle and we basically self-scivatize by just putting

[05:57] us more self-scivatize on a self-scivatize rather than just focusing.

[05:59] Some of you guys right now have multiple things on your plate and you can't focus on it.

[06:04] But imagine if you only had one thing to focus on, maybe it was one location, you have

[06:08] three, you know, you should have done it, you should have only had one.

[06:11] How easy would it be to make money with one location?

[06:13] Super easy because you have all your attention on it.

[06:15] Right?

[06:16] But some of you are making attention with three, right?

[06:18] Maybe not making money with three.

[06:19] Same thing if you're multiple businesses, you can't make it, right?

[06:22] A lot of times because your attention is so split.

[06:24] So if folks in the one thing that makes you money, you do that over and over and over

[06:28] and over and over again until you're sick of it and then you're more of it.

[06:31] And I promise you'll make money.

[06:33] All right.

[06:34] So we'll give you an amazing day.

[06:35] Now get your guys on leave lips.

[00:00] The easiest business to start to make a million dollars a year is also the hardest business

[00:03] to get to a hundred million dollars a year.

[00:05] And I say this is someone who's both a product of the education space, which is, by the way,

[00:10] wink, wink, the business model I'm going to talk about.

[00:13] But I've also done a hundred million plus in sales in that business and sold my last one

[00:18] for 46.2 million.

[00:19] And so I have a very good understanding of being both a customer in that industry and a supplier

[00:23] of that industry.

[00:24] And so I want to make this video for two types of people.

[00:26] First, is somebody who's like, hey, I want to start a business.

[00:29] And the second is for people who have a business and they're considering switching into

[00:32] an education or coaching business.

[00:34] And this business and this video is going to talk about the pros and cons and both sides.

[00:39] And the two biggest considerations that you have to make.

[00:41] One is what's the goal they are actually solving for?

[00:44] Believe it or not, the reason that this thing is really fast is also the same reason why

[00:48] it's not going to make you a billionaire.

[00:50] On the second problem, or the second thing that you have to consider is what problems are

[00:53] going to come up for each of these businesses and which ones you're better at solving.

[00:57] The problems that are in this business are the opportunity in this business and the problems

[01:00] in this business are the opportunity in this one.

[01:02] And that's why this thing can be mega mega big.

[01:05] Takes a little longer.

[01:07] This one can get moderately big, really fast, but really hard to scale from there.

[01:11] So let's dive in.

[01:12] Coaching information, education, digital course, membership, businesses are among the easiest

[01:18] businesses to get to a hundred thousand dollars a year, a hundred thousand dollars a month,

[01:21] two hundred thousand dollars a month.

[01:22] But this is what the business looks like in terms of the difference between that

[01:27] and a traditional business.

[01:29] A digital course business looks like this in terms of the speed.

[01:34] A traditional business looks like this.

[01:37] And so the key thing to make this decision really only comes down to two factors and

[01:43] they're both incredibly important, but they're very simple to understand.

[01:47] So the first one is what is your goal?

[01:50] If you want to sell a business and build an asset that you can exit for twenty five,

[01:55] fifty hundred, two hundred and fifty million dollars a billion dollars someday, then this

[01:59] business, the coaching digital, et cetera, businesses are not a good business for that.

[02:05] And all we have to do is look around and say, okay, of the people who don't have a brand

[02:09] you started from scratch and had information businesses, how many of them were able to get

[02:13] to ten million dollars per year?

[02:15] How many to thirty million dollars per year?

[02:18] How many to a hundred million dollars per year?

[02:19] The amount of guys that a hundred million I can count on one hand on an O.M.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L

[05:19] L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L

[05:49] One was a guy who had a paint business who was doing 4 million bucks a year. Another was a salon owner doing

[05:55] about 3 or 4 million bucks a year. She had six locations doing lash extensions and other stuff like that.

[06:01] The third business was a business opportunity, a micro business, where he would set up home gardens

[06:07] in people's backyards. That was his thing. People would pay him to do that. He could teach other

[06:12] people how to set up gardens and other people's backyards, etc.

[06:17] But almost all of these guys were right here.

[06:23] They had enough skill that they could teach a beginner, but not enough skill to be a master.

[06:31] So they could jump from here and based on the time in the business they'd be like here.

[06:37] Like if you look at this amount of time, do you hear?

[06:39] They would jump all the way to here and they would come.

[06:41] They'd jump higher up on that graph.

[06:45] As time continues to go on this way, this graph, as time goes on, goes off the chart.

[06:51] And this one is very difficult to get there, especially if you have a exit.

[06:59] Meaning somebody buys your business because you built an asset that doesn't rely on you.

[07:03] When you have 60 locations and you're not the one in the ads and you're not the one delivering

[07:08] the lash extensions, that's a very sellable business. And when I can also promise you that

[07:13] to get from one to five, going from 55 to 60 locations, you're going to make more money at 55 to 60

[07:20] and it's going to cost you almost no time. But most people quit right when they reach a boss

[07:26] that they don't know how to beat. And what's interesting about this is that the cap on this business

[07:31] and the cap for most people in local and local and change or traditional service businesses

[07:36] is about the same. It's because they don't know how to get the next level of leadership in.

[07:40] And so they're able to get the first team in, maybe one manager, but they can't get the next

[07:45] level of leadership in. That's what takes you from five locations to 25 to 30 locations.

[07:48] That's going from one city where you've got three to five to five cities.

[07:54] Three to five. If you're thinking locations, but you can think about this as an accounting firm.

[07:58] It doesn't really matter. But fundamentally, you have another layer of leadership, which is why

[08:02] people get stuck. And so if you are in this business, then you just need to realize that you're

[08:09] about to get the best returns that come at the end and not get the shiny object. Now,

[08:17] if you are in this boat and you deceive yourself and you say, you know what, I love making an

[08:24] impact. I love helping people with their businesses more than I like paint paint owner, help,

[08:30] I like helping paint owners make more money with their paint business than I do like helping homeowners

[08:36] paint their houses. Fine. But guess what? That will one wear off. When I was in the gym business

[08:43] in the beginning, I was like, I love fitness. But guess what? It very quickly became, not about fitness.

[08:47] It became about business. And so once I got my hundredth and five hundredth and thousandth

[08:52] weight loss testimonial before and after, I stopped carrying. It's just like, I got numb to it.

[08:56] Because I had so many testimonials just like, yeah, you know, you eat less and you did resist

[09:01] training and you got stronger and you bought muscle and like, yeah, like your body changes. That's

[09:05] kind of the point. And the thing is, is that right now, this is novel. It's new. Now you're like,

[09:10] oh, wow, you know, this guy was able to move houses and go to a new zip code and his kid went to a

[09:14] new school and he's got time for his family. And as crazy as what about to say, well, sound,

[09:18] you will get used to it too. It'll be the same as the other thing. Because you're going to say,

[09:24] well, I mean, dude, it's not, you'll start downplaying. You're like, listen, I mean, you ran some

[09:28] ads that you are that we already knew worked and you ran an offer that was better and you set up

[09:32] a sales process, which you didn't have and you had a script, which you also didn't have. And when you

[09:36] run that thing, you're going to make more money. And so it starts, the the razzle dazzle around,

[09:41] it starts to go away. It's just exciting because it's new. And so my first big piece for either

[09:46] these people is do not straddle their line. You've got one ass. That's an ass. Okay, you can't ride two horses.

[09:54] Pick. And it's the fundamental skill for entrepreneurs being able to make a decision. And if you

[10:01] can't make a decision, you can't commit an acquisition is not common. We define commitment by eliminating

[10:05] alternatives. When you get married, you eliminate all other women or all other men that you're

[10:09] going to be dating. That's how you commit. You say, I will eliminate all alternatives. And so if you

[10:13] want to commit to either of these things that means you need to eliminate the alternatives. Focus

[10:19] is the measure of the amount of things that you say no to. So somebody says no to more things,

[10:23] it's more focused than somebody says yes to more stuff. Period. So if we're looking at these two

[10:30] opportunities, this, if you want to be in this range, then great. Then this is a good opportunity.

[10:35] But understand that this will cap and it will get very difficult to scale, which goes to problem number two.

[10:42] So I'll write the goal here real quick. If you want to have a $10 million plus exit,

[10:54] then sticking with the traditional business is the better model. Now, real talk.

[11:01] Over five years, you might make that an income over here and not be able to exit the business,

[11:08] but you'll have made that an income. And so there are lifestyle benefits. So here you'll make

[11:12] more income faster and you'll sustain a higher, you'll be able to sustain a higher lifestyle,

[11:16] the whole ride. And so that's also a little bit of a trade-off. So here you usually have to reinvest

[11:20] more of that cash into opening new locations, into hiring better people, whatever, less so than you

[11:24] do in a digital products or education business. So that's a pro work on depending on what it's yet.

[11:30] Now, the second element of this is what problem are you more comfortable solving? So if you're in this

[11:37] you're going to have huge key man risk, which is you have to figure out how to transfer

[11:41] everything that makes you special to other people without making them so special that they leave

[11:46] your business and take your customers. Very, very hard. On top of that, you're going to be in the

[11:52] talent and training business. And if you really, really want to scale, then you have to build a brand.

[12:03] Because acquisition will only become more and more expensive as you get to colder and colder audiences,

[12:08] which means you need to build positive re-associations with you over time,

[12:11] which means the product needs to consistently be very, very good. So you get good reviews, good word

[12:15] about, and that continues to compound in time rather than compound against you, which is what happens

[12:19] for most people because they make mediocre products because they only are a little bit better than most

[12:22] people, not way better than most people. So the problem that you have in this business,

[12:29] on the other side, of sticking with the thing that you're in, if you're in a, let's say you're

[12:32] the painting business, you're the accounting business, you're the whatever business. The problem that you

[12:36] have to deal with is that it's slower. In the beginning, this is fast in the beginning, slower

[12:43] near the end, this is slower than the beginning, faster near the end. So number one, it's slower.

[12:48] Number two, it typically has more capital involved. You have to reinvest more of the money to

[12:54] continue to grow, especially if you have brick and mortar locations. You literally have to

[12:57] spend money to open an location to expand capacity. Here, there is no capital expense to

[13:04] to sell more people into your membership. Sell more people into your course, not really. You just

[13:08] have more people you have to hire, but that's it. So in this business, it takes longer and it costs more

[13:13] money. But because it takes longer and it costs more money, there are fewer people who do it

[13:18] successfully. And as a result, they create something that we can put here in big letters, which is

[13:25] you create an asset. You create something that someone else could own. And so what I will say here is that

[13:32] if you stick with it from here to here and you get good enough that you really understand all the

[13:38] special sauce about the business, you might not ever want to tell anybody about it because you

[13:43] want to own the whole thing. And I'll say like Adac was in the calm the last chain we recently purchased,

[13:49] it was a franchise and it had more franchise locations open than it had corporate and I bought

[13:59] all of the franchisees out. And so we took all 30 plus locations in house and made the mall corporate.

[14:05] And we did that because I looked at the economics and I was like wait a second, why would we want to

[14:09] make 8% when the amount of work that it takes to open a franchise location is 50% of the work that

[14:15] it takes to open a location we own the whole thing on anyways. And with franchisees and customers,

[14:20] by the way, you can't fire it with because they paid you. If you have employees and you have a bad

[14:27] manager, then swap them out. And so we have more control and we can know that they're going to

[14:32] actually correctly. The amount of franchise or buddies I have, I can't even count. And they all say the same

[14:37] thing. Man, these franchisees are idiots. They all think they're smarter than me. They all want to do it

[14:40] their own way. And their own way is the wrong way. And so they end up making less money. And they

[14:47] don't do it right. And so then all of a sudden your reputation takes because they're not following

[14:50] your process and it's a whole cycle. And so there's a reason Pandexpress is a significantly more

[14:56] viable company is that Mr. Panda owns a mall. He owns all the net income from every single location

[15:04] and he owns the dirt and he owns the property itself, all 2600. They don't want to four billion

[15:10] in sales with 27% net margins. Upsard, 20% net margins. It's almost a billion a year in income.

[15:18] income cash flow. Woo. But he didn't start coaching other Chinese restaurant owners when he had

[15:26] five locations. He just stuck with it. And so it goes back to what goals you have. If you want to

[15:32] build an asset that eventually will acquire less of you, less work and give you ultimate freedom,

[15:38] this business model will do it. If you were looking to make a hundred five hundred a million bucks,

[15:44] two million bucks a year and are willing to continue to work and basically always have to keep

[15:49] working in order to do that, then this is a good business model. Reinterating this, if you're here,

[15:55] right, which is at this early part here, then this model is the faster and easier way to make a

[16:02] million to million dollars a year. It is. If you want this and you're further along in this curve,

[16:09] then for most of you, it makes sense to just stick with what you're doing because you're about

[16:13] to unlock the huge amount of value that's going to get created. And so I want to give you an

[16:17] even handed approach to thinking about this and understanding that you also may be, let's say you're

[16:23] at this point and your goals might actually change. And so when I was starting out, if someone's like,

[16:29] hey, you can make a million bucks here. I'd be like screw acid value. I don't care about exit.

[16:33] I was like, I just want to make money in which case, great vehicle. But what happens in the reason

[16:38] that you can look at Alex Becker, who I think got up to twenty five or thirty million dollars a year

[16:42] in his information business, switched to high roast and then built a multi hundred million dollar

[16:46] enterprise with software. Sam Evans had consulting.com, they were doing thirty plus million dollars a

[16:52] year and then from all the skills he learned transfer it to school.com and then made it significantly

[16:58] more valuable enterprise. Right. Now mind you, school makes less cash flow than consulting.com

[17:05] because this business requires more capital and is slower at the onset, schools in your five or six

[17:11] right now, right? But it's scaling like this now because it's easier to add five thousand customers

[17:17] in a month in this business and almost impossible to do it here, especially if you have services

[17:23] attached to it. And so they're opposing constant both sides and you have to realize that your

[17:27] goal will change and if you do get to this point where you're right at this point where you're like,

[17:31] well, shoot, because sometimes people go the other way. They say, hey, I've been doing this for five

[17:37] years. I want to start a software company. Look at all the people who are successful with software

[17:42] companies who made the switch. Let me tell you the one comment trait because I know all of them.

[17:46] They stop this and they start to do in that. And so in either direction,

[17:55] if you're going to do it, do it and don't do the other one. So I want to talk to avatar number three,

[18:02] hidden bonus. Is somebody who's been successful here for five years or someone who's been

[18:06] moderately successful here for five years? The other side looks really tempting because if you're

[18:11] over here, you've got enough cash saved up. You've been making a million bucks, two million bucks a

[18:15] year for a while and you're like, man, now I want to have that 10, 20, 50, 100 million dollar

[18:20] plus exit, right? I get it. I was there. On the other hand, if you're here, you're like, man, I've been

[18:26] put in five plus years in this thing. I want to start making some money. I want to start making some

[18:30] cash flow. And so this starts looking attractive. And I'll give you the quote from my CFO. They're

[18:34] shit in every business. And so the key here is, let me walk you through the transition on either side.

[18:40] If you're going from traditional business over to digital education business, what you don't

[18:47] want to do is keep the traditional business. And so there's the fallacy of like, well, one,

[18:54] some of you want to keep it because you're afraid of actually making the jump and this is actually

[18:57] what makes you money. In which case, just keep doing what you're doing. But if you really are going

[19:02] to make the jump, then there's this idea that you want to have keep a test kitchen. And I actually

[19:06] think it's not true. So let me explain. So the concept of a test kitchen is works when you're making

[19:14] food because you want to standardize the process and you roll out the food making process across

[19:18] the location. It's much easier to roll it out. You have franchise control. We have corporate control,

[19:22] whatever. Now, if you're in an education business, you teaching your employees on site, how to do

[19:28] a new process or do a new play is not how you're going to teach all of the people in your community,

[19:34] all the people who are your customers that buy your stuff from you from an education perspective.

[19:38] What are you actually going to do? You're going to probably record some videos and add some sort of

[19:43] zoom call, you know, add on to help give support. Maybe some community support as well. But that's

[19:48] about it. And so if you want to test whether or not a new play is going to work in this education

[19:55] model, then test it like you would actually roll it out, which is if you have 100 customers,

[20:00] take 10 customers that represent different segments of the market, both geographically, like what

[20:05] market are they in and what skill level they're at. And so when we ran things at gym launch,

[20:11] I wouldn't say let me take the top 10 gyms and test something out because that's going to give

[20:14] me bad data. I'm going to have the top 10 winners. They're going to make everything work. But if I take

[20:18] the bottom 10 on everything, nothing's going to work. But if something does work for them,

[20:21] it's going to definitely work for everyone. And so what I did was I took two people from each of the

[20:25] 20% bands. So two people from the top 20% two from the next 20, next 20 in the middle,

[20:31] next 20 in the bottom middle, and then next 20 at the very bottom. So I had 10 people in different

[20:35] markets at different skill levels. And so when I rolled it out, I got to have a representative

[20:39] sample of both markets and performance to see whether this play actually worked. And I see that

[20:44] as a far superior model to actually creating better products and better education that also doesn't

[20:50] require you to keep an appendage of a business that you have to stay attached to. Because

[20:54] whether you like it or not, if there's a problem in this business and you know a client sleeps with

[21:00] the employee, writer and employee stealing, guess what's taking your shower time? I don't care if this

[21:05] is 10% of your income is going to take 50% or 100% of your mental bandwidth until the problem goes away.

[21:11] Your brain is going to deal with what's urgent, not necessarily what's important. And so this is why

[21:15] I focus is so important. So if you're going to switch from here to here, cut it, sell it, don't have

[21:21] any appendages and go all in on this. If you are going to go from the education business over to

[21:26] a more traditional business like software or service business that you want to attach to it,

[21:30] then guess what? You cut this business, you say I'm done with that and I'm going to build this for real.

[21:36] Just don't straddle the line. I've yet to see anyone succeed big doing this and the vast majority

[21:43] people do exactly that, which is why I'm making the video. So you have your three scenarios.

[21:49] You're starting out, you just want to make income, then yes, digital products, education

[21:52] businesses is probably the fastest and easiest way to make a lot of money pretty quickly.

[21:56] If you want to build an asset that's going to be valuable and sellable without you and you're

[22:01] comfortable with a slower pace of growth and putting more capital in, this is something that's going to

[22:05] give you a $10, $50, $100,000 plus exit. If you're going to make the transition, then pick. If you are

[22:11] in this bucket and you're like, that is cool. I don't necessarily want that right now. That's not

[22:15] the stage of the journey of Matt. We have a free thing that you can do at school.com for slash games

[22:22] where I will lead you through starting a business right now, 50.54.1% of people who start the

[22:29] school games of the paid community make their first dollar online. Very, very proud of that. If you

[22:33] are at this business and you're trying to get to hear you want to have a massive exit,

[22:36] then acquisition.com, everyone's why we run workshops that are headquarters. We help businesses that

[22:42] are smaller than our portfolio size. Take the next step so that hopefully someday,

[22:46] maybe we're the ones who buy it from you and help you scale it from 30 locations to 300. That being

[22:50] said, this is the path. I want to make it clear for you, give you the pros and the content either side,

[22:54] and hopefully get you to commit one way or the other.

## Full Transcript
[00:00] This is a video I'm making for a Vante, the young man who was working two jobs with a one year old who's struggling and to do sick and tired of being poor and didn't know how to get out.

[00:09] I didn't have time to answer you when I was walking, but I wanted to take this minute to give you a longer answer.

[00:14] I'll reach you the tweet and maybe we'll put it up on the screen.

[00:16] Two of the vante, the young man who stopped me at the grocery store working two jobs with one year old who asked advice on how to get ahead.

[00:21] I gave you a short answer because I was in a rush and it ate at me.

[00:24] So if you follow me near and maybe you'll read this, what you're going through is tough.

[00:27] Being so young and already having to support a child is not easy.

[00:29] But you'll have the opportunity to become an amazing inspiration in a way I never could.

[00:33] Your success story will become your sermon.

[00:34] That being said, onto the advice.

[00:36] You're going to need to assume that luck isn't real or that it applies to everyone else but you.

[00:40] Because the only way you're going to get out of your surroundings is by having something of value that other people want.

[00:44] And right now the only thing you have is your time with low skills to trade, which is a hard game to play.

[00:48] You have to trade a lot of it only to get a little.

[00:50] So your main objective is to have the time to learn a skill while providing for your family.

[00:54] That means in the short term your family may have to suffer.

[00:57] Scratch that your family will suffer.

[00:58] But better now when they're too young to remember it than when they're too old to forget.

[01:02] Again, not forever, but for now.

[01:03] So these are the things you're going to have to do.

[01:05] And this isn't double stuff.

[01:06] This is wake the fuck up because if you don't you're going to blink and be 30 and then the same spot.

[01:10] But worse.

[01:11] Number one, cut all costs.

[01:13] And I mean all costs.

[01:14] You don't need out anymore for anything.

[01:15] And if you're hungry, you deal with it.

[01:17] If it's not from a discount grocery store, you don't buy a clothing hot.

[01:21] What you've got is everything you need for the next two years.

[01:23] Period.

[01:24] No exceptions.

[01:25] Reuse, trade or go to goodwill.

[01:27] You go to work.

[01:28] You go home and home is ideally with your family.

[01:30] And when I say family, you're folks.

[01:32] And if you don't have folks who have got room or a couch or a basement that you can say at, the worst

[01:36] case is with another family, also trying to make it and save.

[01:39] So it's six of you eight of you 10 of you and one spot.

[01:41] All splitting it.

[01:42] All of you contributing.

[01:43] And it's going to be as cheap as you possibly can.

[01:45] Number two, increase your income.

[01:47] You're working two jobs.

[01:48] Your free time, don't you just spend applying to other jobs closer to what you want to do.

[01:52] Because that you didn't like either of the things that you was doing at that time.

[01:54] So any at home phone sales job has starter rolls that require zero experience to play 40,000

[01:59] year or more.

[02:00] Do that and work your other job in between.

[02:02] If you can't drive Uber, if you don't have a car, save up until you do.

[02:06] Number three, the easiest thing to sell is someone else's stuff.

[02:09] So start there.

[02:10] Then learn how to buy stuff for cheap and then flip it.

[02:12] The bigger the thing, the more you made.

[02:14] You go from flipping cards to furniture to home.

[02:17] And the limit never stops from there on.

[02:19] So I can hear the stress in your voice when you're talking to me about your situation.

[02:22] It sounded like you didn't know what to do.

[02:24] Sattness comes from a lack of options.

[02:26] It's a feeling of hopelessness.

[02:27] But whenever you feel that or what you think, this is ignorance, not sadness.

[02:31] It means I don't know enough.

[02:32] And that I can control.

[02:34] You ask me to come work for free.

[02:35] But I have no need for low skilled labor.

[02:37] But I do have a need for high skilled beasts.

[02:39] It's why I make the books and the courses and the content everywhere for free.

[02:42] So use those.

[02:43] Then get yourself a high paying job.

[02:45] And every day apply for higher paying ones.

[02:47] I recommend sales to start.

[02:48] Then once you get in there for the love of God, work until your fingers bleed because you have no other option.

[02:53] You have no luck.

[02:54] Nothing is going to work out for you.

[02:56] You're not going to catch a break.

[02:57] You're going to have to make it happen.

[02:58] You're going to have to force it.

[03:00] You've got to become undeniable.

[03:02] And the best news is is that you can do that in less than a year.

[03:04] So that's my advice.

[03:05] Number one, cut all your costs.

[03:07] Everything.

[03:08] Number two, work more to make more and apply to better jobs and then learn to sell.

[03:12] Three, start selling more expensive stuff and then eventually sell your own.

[03:16] The game is just trading up over and over and over again.

[03:19] You're just a few trades away from a very different financial situation.

[03:22] So if I want to add on top of that, you're in a tough spot.

[03:25] And I think some of the words I probably just said to you,

[03:27] Why did it?

[03:28] Hopefully hit home somewhere.

[03:30] But one of the hard things that you've got going on right now is that when I saw you,

[03:33] you were wearing relatively nice clothes.

[03:35] And I was going to like bash you on it when I saw you.

[03:37] But I want to take the opportunity to say, like, you know better.

[03:40] You don't have to mean like, you know that like if you're struggling with money,

[03:42] that's the last thing that you should spend money on.

[03:45] Right. And I think one of the difficulty, especially when you're younger,

[03:48] is you've got your friends, your family, and especially if they're all poor,

[03:51] then they have terrible views around money.

[03:53] They might not approve of all the stuff you're learning on the internet and try to try these new things out.

[03:57] And the real real is like, you're going to fail a lot.

[03:59] And they're going to see say, see, told yourself, and the tough part is,

[04:02] is they're going to be right most of the time.

[04:04] Except it's one of those things where it's 99% right, but 100% wrong.

[04:08] Is that anybody who bets against you for this thing being the thing is usually going to be right.

[04:12] It's just like a parent who says, you're going to break up with this person.

[04:14] You're going to break up with this person. You're going to break up with this person.

[04:16] But they're right with every single person you ever date except for the person you marry.

[04:19] And then they're 100% wrong.

[04:20] And if you have the perspective of listing that, it can be incredibly disheartening.

[04:24] And so number one is, I want you to go on a different information diet.

[04:28] So you need to be able to ignore all the stuff that they're giving you because like the best way to stay poor

[04:32] is to listen to poor people about how to get rich.

[04:34] You're already taking great says by like, watching content doing stuff.

[04:37] Just keep doing more than that.

[04:39] And I'm sure your girl, you know, you have your baby left.

[04:41] That's your world.

[04:42] Like anybody who doesn't, he's not trying to build a Vonte 2.0 with you doesn't deserve your time.

[04:47] Because like right now you have a wallet of money and you've got to wall it a minutes.

[04:51] And like every single person you're choosing to pay minutes to or pay dollars to has to earn their keep.

[04:56] And earning their keep in this season of your life is them helping you get to where you want to go.

[05:00] Now, I don't know what you're making any new job.

[05:02] I'm just going to assume the extreme scenario of you're making a minimum wage of both jobs and you're working in 80 hours doing that.

[05:07] I get it. And I respect the hustle, which is why I'm making this video.

[05:09] You need to get more for your time. And right now the extra time on top of that 80 is you sleeping and probably spending time with your kid.

[05:15] And what I'm going to say, people in your surroundings will say like that guy's extreme or that guy he's he's not balanced.

[05:20] And the answer is yes, I am extremely and I am unbalanced for the season that you're in.

[05:24] I think you should be too because the thing is just like if you don't take action on this five years is going to go by nothing's going to change because you're not going to get ahead.

[05:30] Like you need to get your head firmly above water because you probably barely feel like you can keep your head above surface.

[05:35] Right? That's why that stress is coming from. And you don't know what to do.

[05:38] So to get the water lower, you've got to lower your time budget and your money budget.

[05:42] And I want to go really extreme with you. And I'm not telling you to do anything I didn't do.

[05:46] All right? I owned my car in cash, which I think was a five or six thousand more car.

[05:49] And I slept in a room with another dude in a house that had six other people in it and we all split it.

[05:55] So I was in an interrible neighborhood. I just paid $400 a month in a nice neighborhood because I didn't have my own place.

[06:00] And so I had to split my kitchen and I had to do it the fact that three of them had dogs.

[06:04] And we should in piss everywhere all the time. It sucks. But you know what I sucked more?

[06:08] Not being able to have the money to buy it, the courses and the seminars and the workshops that I was able to attend with the extra that I saved.

[06:15] So I could learn my next skills. And so right now, food and shelter is the only thing you spend money on.

[06:20] And you're going to drop everything else. And you're going to drop those expenses to the greatest degree possible.

[06:24] And either your girl is working and if she's working, then you can have childcare.

[06:28] If she's not working to take care of the kid, then you need to say, listen to me like, I got to do this for us right now.

[06:33] And so like you're putting your sacrifice in which is your sacrificing your career. So you can be with the kid.

[06:37] I need to sacrifice the kid right now. So I could have the career. So that together as a family we're balanced rather than the individual.

[06:43] So there's two levels of balance I want you to think about. One is the macro, which is like you can be balanced over your lifespan.

[06:49] When you're retired, you'll have more time. You can go to Europe. You can do whatever the other stuff goes, right?

[06:53] And also you can be balanced in a family unit. Your wife might spend more time with the kid than she does in her career.

[06:58] But you're going to spend more time in your career than you do with the kid for now.

[07:01] Cut out the people who are taking your time easy way to see this is like if the people in your life don't have bigger dreams for you than you do, ignore all of their advice.

[07:09] They should ignore them entirely. And I know that that's simple to say and hard to do.

[07:12] But you're in a hard situation and I think the question is whether you can be harder than your circumstances right now.

[07:17] And you have to be to get out of this.

[07:19] Lock is already done. You are shithead. Let's assume he's never going to give you the right hand. You're never going to get lucky.

[07:24] But you still need to win. So now it's like how do I do that?

[07:26] If you have a car, you can have more flexible hours if you drive through there.

[07:29] That's something that I recommend for a lot of people. If you don't have a car, you need to save up as fast as you can to get one.

[07:34] By winning cash, negotiate, trying to get yourself 5 to 10 thousand dollar car in cash.

[07:38] You don't have payments. You just have the insurance, which because it's a cheap part will be less.

[07:41] The remainder of your time and you've got to tell your lady this is like I'm going to be spending four hours a day every day watching these videos.

[07:47] And this isn't me doing scrolling on YouTube. I need you to pick one skill that you want to have and only consume stuff about that.

[07:54] This is my one thing I'll let you buy. It's a timer. You can buy for five bucks. Not your phone.

[07:58] And you set the timer and you set it for those four hours a day. Every time you look away, you stop the timer.

[08:02] You do four hours of real work of studying the skill. After you've done enough of that work and you're like what's enough?

[08:07] Any hours? Like you're like oh, how could you do that too?

[08:09] Yeah, I know. So I'm telling you, you can get out of this fast.

[08:12] You can switch those four hours of you learning the basics of that skill.

[08:15] Just spending the rest of your time being the most amazing applicant to new jobs that exist in the world.

[08:21] I didn't say go apply to jobs. I said be the best candidate that has ever applied.

[08:25] And you're like I don't have experience and you can address that. Like what I don't have an experience.

[08:29] I will make up for an hustle and you prove that by messaging multiple people and every company with a snippet.

[08:35] Personalize to each of them. You know what other people do? Like they take a half step.

[08:39] They copy and paste the same thing to all four people. And you know what the four people do?

[08:42] Yeah, yeah, he copy and paste it the same message to me. Don't do that.

[08:45] Be personal. Look at the HR recruiter. Look at the head of Tyler.

[08:49] Look at director of whatever and message each of them on LinkedIn. If you don't have a LinkedIn, go get one.

[08:53] It's free. And when you submit your resume, put a personalized cover letter on it after reading from the website.

[08:58] What that business is about? When you read the job description, good job description say what they want the person do.

[09:03] And say like I will be able to help do this thing because of these things, right?

[09:06] And especially a lower level of your resume is not going to matter as much. Don't let anybody around you say that or fool you into that.

[09:11] Well, will matter especially for low level roles as hustle. So every employer wants to see somebody's going to go out of their way to go above and beyond.

[09:18] And so you demonstrate that you're going to go above and beyond. And guess what's going to happen?

[09:21] You're going to do this for five different places. You're going to write a custom thing.

[09:24] It's going to take you four hours to do the research, write the custom thing.

[09:27] Message 20 people because it's going to be four people at all five places.

[09:30] You know what's going to happen? Nothing. Because you're not lucky.

[09:33] So what are you going to have to do? Got to be undeniable. Do you think if you applied to a thousand places like that over the next six months, you wouldn't get to up?

[09:39] I think you would. You think it's like after you got off your shift, you drove over and you said, hey, I just want to let you know.

[09:43] I just want to let you know. I'm not going to create a new one.

[09:45] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

[09:47] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

[09:51] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

[09:55] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

[09:59] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

[10:03] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

[10:07] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

[10:11] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

[10:15] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

[10:19] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

[10:23] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

[10:27] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

[10:31] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

[10:35] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

[10:39] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

[10:43] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

[10:47] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

[10:51] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

[10:55] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

[10:59] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

[11:05] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

[11:09] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

[11:13] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

[11:17] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

[11:21] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

[11:25] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

[11:29] I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.

[11:33] I'm going to do this video about how to interview correctly. You do that stuff. You'll put yourself ahead of other people.

[11:37] Volume. Okay. Cool. Now you're like, okay, but I'm not getting interviews. Volume the gates up.

[11:41] Break the timer. Start doing the reps one a day, two a day, three a day, four a day, five a day, six a day, ten a day, every single day.

[11:47] You're like, wait, that's 40 messages that are personalized and ten cover letters.

[11:50] Yep. That'll probably take about four hours. And then what do you do tomorrow? Set the timer.

[11:53] You do it again. Next day, set the timer. You do it again. What do you do the next day?

[11:57] Set the timer and you do it a fucking end. You keep doing it. And on the ones that you really, really like,

[12:01] you drive over there after you get off your shift. You stop by and just say, hey, I'm a vante.

[12:05] I'm really excited about the opportunity. I think I can help. I applied. If you got a couple messages from me,

[12:09] I promise I'm not a weirdo. I just did it because I wanted to stay out from rest of the parks. I know you guys

[12:13] I'm sure for an opportunity is good as this. You probably got a lot of people who are interested. I just promise you that I just want to

[12:17] shot. You say that they will give you the interview. And if they don't, someone will.

[12:23] And once you do get that job and you work part of the everyone else, we turn the dial.

[12:28] And you don't do it for a week. You don't work part of the everyone else for a week. You don't work part of them for a month.

[12:32] You don't work part of them for six months. You work part of the top guy for a year for two years.

[12:36] You're like, well, shit to. I'm already like two or three years from now. Yeah. I said it was a season.

[12:40] But on the other side of this season is everything else that you want. And so, if I say to volunteer in 36 months,

[12:46] are you willing to give me 36 months to get yourself out of the healing that you have right now?

[12:50] Are you like a second time to be informed? Sicken not being able to buy the stuff from my girl that I want. I'm sickening

[12:54] for my kid. I want to be able to get to good zip code. I want to be able to have good school. I want to be able to have these things.

[12:58] There's a price tag on that. They question just whether or not you're willing to pay it. If you're willing to pay it,

[13:02] Frank the dial and volume will not get locked. But you can't rely a lot. You can rely on volume.

[13:08] Is that, I promise you, independent of race, color, socioeconomic background.

[13:12] Really, wait. Some races, socioeconomic backgrounds are hustling up here. It gives them an advantage.

[13:16] Sure. But if you do it a million times as a given advantage, you only need one yes.

[13:20] If there's like a lesson I can like have you let etch into your brain, is that there's a significant amount of money

[13:24] and opportunity that sits on the other side of being willing to be rejected by a stranger.

[13:28] If you get rejected a thousand times, you are no worse off than you are right now.

[13:32] In fact, you're better. Why? Because you have a thousand times experience. And so you either learn

[13:36] or you win, which means in both cases by doing, you win by default. I'll give you a little analogy.

[13:42] So let's say you and your buddy are thinking about asking a girl to prom. It'll make sense in a second.

[13:46] And your buddy's like, ah man, I want to ask Nicole, and you're like, all right man, why don't you go ask her?

[13:50] It's like, ah, what she says no. He's like, well then you're in the exact same position you are now, which is you have no prom day.

[13:56] You will also have no prom day. But you'll have experience of asking one girl. What happens when you talk to the next girl?

[14:00] You'll probably be a little nervous. And you'll probably realize that you will survive. You will live if you hear her no.

[14:04] And if you ask a hundred girls, do you think one of them will say yes to your prom day? Probably.

[14:08] And in that situation, what do you know? Better off than you were before you asked.

[14:12] The moral of the story there is that you lose nothing from no. You only stand something to gain from yeses.

[14:18] And one yes can change your entire life. And so if you're willing to be rejected and see the rejections as you learning, meaning you win.

[14:24] And see the yeses as you also winning, then you can't lose. And everybody else around you who's poor is going to convince you otherwise.

[14:31] They're going to be like, why are you still doing this? And stop bothering those people. Then you're never going to get the job.

[14:35] And you need to re-adjust your expectations. Segregol's lower. Hey, that's stuff's not for us, right? They're going to tell you those things.

[14:41] The thing is, is that you have something that I do not have and that many people want to have. Is that you have a hard fucking beginning.

[14:47] You have a harder and bigger monster to slag. But the bigger the monster, the more epic to cure up. And so these are the stories that you're going to someday tell.

[14:53] And these are going to be the sermons that you're going to be able to give to other avantees in the future.

[14:57] If you can't even muster the willingness to fail for yourself, you're willing to fail for your kid for the story that you're going to tell that.

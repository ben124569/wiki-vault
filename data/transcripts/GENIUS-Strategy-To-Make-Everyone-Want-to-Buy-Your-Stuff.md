[00:00] I talk to a room full of business owners for eight hours about how to make more money.

[00:03] Here's one of the best moments about how to improve your offer.

[00:06] So there's something called in the software called willingness to pay,

[00:08] which is like what's the thing that gets people to want to buy?

[00:11] And so they plotted everything across this chart in terms of the features.

[00:14] Like where are the things in the offer that had the highest willingness to pay

[00:19] that people value the most.

[00:20] So you want to be in this box over here.

[00:22] And the four things that they found were exclusive.

[00:27] One was access.

[00:30] Just so we have buckets to think about this through exclusive content.

[00:39] Excuse of events.

[00:41] And the way they ran this research study, they had newsletter.

[00:45] Which to me is content, but I'm assuming that this is basically this is probably video that was written.

[00:51] And so there's the four biggest things that have willingness to pay.

[00:54] And so they also looked at like exclusive merch discounts that were associated with the community.

[00:58] They looked at priority support, like they had a number of different things that they looked at.

[01:02] But the thing that had the four that had the highest willingness to pay were these four things.

[01:07] So these are the things that people value the most within the context of recurring community.

[01:11] If I were to build a community, these were the things that I would include.

[01:14] Some of you may not want to do this, but when I started Jim launch,

[01:18] one of the things that we were able to get a huge boost in conversions was my sales guys were able to say like,

[01:25] you can talk to Alex every day.

[01:28] And so I hopped on a daily call every single day.

[01:31] And so they knew that.

[01:33] And so I would hop on Zoom for 60 minutes.

[01:35] Same format every time I was like, hey, here's how you ask a question.

[01:38] Put these questions in the chat.

[01:39] This is the format. If you don't follow the format, I'm not going into the question.

[01:42] The rather than here everyone's life story, I could just be like,

[01:46] what's your revenue? How many of my members a month?

[01:48] What's the main constraint that you're dealing with?

[01:50] And like, what have you tried so far?

[01:51] And so by getting that, at least in that context, I was able to just really quickly hammer,

[01:56] I'd be able to answer 100 plus questions in an hour.

[01:58] And even if I couldn't get two someone's question,

[02:01] the likelihood that their question was one of those questions was fairly high.

[02:04] And so what I had to have it is like, a lot of people ended up just like eating lunch with Alex,

[02:08] because I did in the middle of the day, because at the time for Jim owners, the middle of the day is the time when they have the most time.

[02:12] Like the peaks are morning and afternoon.

[02:15] And so I would agree that if you increase call frequency,

[02:19] you will have more people and it makes it very sexy from a selling.

[02:22] It's like you can talk to me every day.

[02:23] So if we're looking at this from a buckets perspective,

[02:26] this is one of those things that we can add to improve any offer you have.

[02:31] And it'll be more and more powerful.

[02:32] The higher the frequency, and obviously the lower the head count.

[02:36] But if we're looking at very high volume communities, then it'll just be free

[02:38] frequencies and the same thing that we can really control for.

[02:40] Okay, so these are a lot of different ideas that we can do for go ahead.

[02:43] Do you have a team that is trained and really fit and they offer calls instead of you?

[02:47] How do you get people to want to get on a call with your team?

[02:50] Because we have that and when it's me, everybody's coming, when you're a team.

[02:55] You mean like group calls with the team?

[02:57] Group calls with the team, but it's quite like, could they have been in there for all the right year,

[03:02] right in the interactive, the members on a daily basis?

[03:05] If you can answer the questions better than they can, then it means that they need to be better.

[03:08] Like if someone comes to me and says, hey, Alex, how do you run GDN display network?

[03:13] I don't know.

[03:14] Ask me, I don't click anything.

[03:16] I barely, I don't even have my logins for my bank account.

[03:18] I have no idea.

[03:20] Like you're saying like you're still very good at that.

[03:23] Not to say you should be bad at it, but it's more like, how do I get them to be more in the day to day

[03:30] so that they can answer it?

[03:31] Because customers are bloodhounds for value.

[03:33] And so like if they're going to you, it's because you're providing more value than your team is.

[03:36] Like that's the big, the big principle, you know?

[03:39] So I don't think there's like a quick hit tactic.

[03:42] It's like the only way they will go is either if you just remove yourself entirely and they're the only people that can have access to.

[03:47] Or because I mean, I did this.

[03:49] I had my daily call.

[03:51] And eventually I went from five days a week to four days a week to three days a week to two days a week to one day a week.

[03:55] And I would replace them with other people.

[03:57] Now, at a certain point, the call attendance, it, I mean, it went probably in half, but then it stayed there.

[04:06] And especially because the frequency they could interact with me was much lower.

[04:10] Like it took 12 months for me to completely remove myself.

[04:13] So it's not like, all right, so I'm not doing daily calls anymore.

[04:17] Coffee is with, humette, you know?

[04:19] Like, it's like, it won't work.

[04:22] Yeah, it's very slow and then heavy on edification and then also coaching them on how to, I mean, like, on presentation skills.

[04:30] It's like literally teaching them how to present.

[04:32] And if you ever had like sales teams with phone sales and things like that, okay, well, it's a lot like training scripting.

[04:39] And so it's like, well, this person asks this question and you said this, let's play it.

[04:43] And you do games like this is off, but like play it, pause.

[04:47] Now, say it this way.

[04:48] Okay, great, say it again.

[04:50] Great, change your tone like this.

[04:51] Say it again.

[04:52] Okay, next time someone asks this question, what do you say?

[04:55] Like, that kind of drilling, but that's what it takes to get yourself out of it.

[05:01] And most people aren't willing to do that, which is why most things aren't so old.

[05:03] So these are access from a content perspective that anyone have any like, uh, and like features,

[05:09] products that were like kind of zesty or had some, you know, zing to it that that you found people like,

[05:15] this is the reason I bought.

[05:16] Can it?

[05:17] What's the most popular product you've ever bought?

[05:20] Uh, the bonuses, uh, so like, those fast, I actually want to like, they can, uh,

[05:25] they can get fast and do something power.

[05:27] Like, let the actors that they can get something done, the quicker they want to get in.

[05:32] So like, I'm a craft.

[05:33] Fast results.

[05:34] So you have classes all over.

[05:35] Yeah.

[05:35] So, um, I'm in Craig, right?

[05:38] So like, help a people cleaning their credit.

[05:40] I don't do it for other people, but I give them my hacks to be able to get it done fast.

[05:44] And once a time someone, process, it takes more than some time.

[05:48] But some of the things that I've learned to be a guest at the moment, like, day, but two days,

[05:52] so that results.

[05:53] We can go back to it.

[05:54] It is what makes you go back right.

[05:56] Hey, that soon as I say that.

[05:57] Then you say the exact number of days.

[05:59] Uh, ESO, I, well, I want to my things is to get something where I'm,

[06:03] we're doing 24, 70 to hours.

[06:05] And once I say that, I don't even care about the rest of the stuff.

[06:08] I say, well, I don't get that.

[06:09] You don't.

[06:10] And that's the one I'm on.

[06:11] So, for my bonus perspective, because I literally just finished the third book on this,

[06:16] um, something that I've given a lot of thought to is that people don't buy because of the aggregate

[06:20] value.

[06:21] They buy because one thing is worth it to them.

[06:23] And so, rather than trying to make this list that adds up to this thing, it's more about how

[06:28] do I have as many very legitimate value things that on their own are worth an access of the price.

[06:34] And so, trying to think about my bonuses for anything that way.

[06:38] So, how do I make this just every single bonus has to earn its weight,

[06:42] that it has to be worth more than the price.

[06:44] And that'll force you to also get a little bit more consolidated on the bonuses,

[06:47] um, and really just focus on the sexiest stuff.

[06:49] And usually for different avatars.

[06:51] If you have like different psychographics of people who are coming into your business,

[06:54] like I'm sure there's some people who have like really bad credit from a long time.

[06:57] And some people just had like, they had a medical bail or something and something happened.

[07:01] Right?

[07:02] And so, having specific bonuses that are going to speak that in and of themselves for that one avatar is worth it.

[07:08] I want to have like the punchiest, most distilled, every one of these if you read it,

[07:13] you'd want to buy for this alone.

[07:15] It's like taking mental rent.

[07:16] It's like every one of them has to pay rent to be there.

[07:20] Because they only need one reason to buy.

[07:22] I think just asking yourself, what is, what is something that if I

[07:25] removed everything else, if I just offered this one thing, people would still buy.

[07:30] And then using that as the limit test for every one of the bonuses that you add.

[07:34] And then I think it will force you to think of better things that you can do

[07:37] to make your overall offer more valuable.

[07:39] And I would also think about that through the different lenses of the avatars.

[07:43] The guy who has a medical emergency, the guy who has 10 years, the person who got in a bad divorce.

[07:49] Like each of that, for that person, this one thing alone is worth it.

[07:51] You can repeat, tell me what you're doing to me.

[07:55] I'll do you just like,

[07:57] I'll tell you what you're doing.

[07:58] But he sees something interesting.

[07:59] No, it's not about them.

[08:01] Yeah.

[08:01] So I've been running two in real life events every month recently.

[08:05] And interestingly, Chose actually went up.

[08:09] She was so surprised, but it makes out because like,

[08:11] I do it in real life event.

[08:13] I've been the boy's off to like a big park.

[08:14] We dressing in the mud and then we all dress up and go to like this business,

[08:18] did you let anyone come?

[08:19] Anyone who's inside yet, we were thinking about now

[08:21] making a lock in it behind a 12 month month.

[08:23] Yeah, I mean, that would have been my first thing.

[08:27] It's like just move it.

[08:28] So then it's like this big thing.

[08:30] Because then it goes from, I'm missing out on this thing to I can't wait to get this thing.

[08:35] And I think that that alone would probably solve it as a second little tip

[08:40] of it for anybody else who does events.

[08:41] Whenever you do events, you want to also announce the next one.

[08:45] Upsells happen at the point of greatest need, not the point of greatest satisfaction.

[08:50] It's a big misnomer.

[08:51] Sometimes they have at the same time, oftentimes they don't.

[08:54] So like if I give you a steak dinner and the need to steak dinner and then I say,

[08:57] hey, do you want to steak?

[08:58] You're like, no, because the timing's wrong.

[09:01] And so we want to, we want to often the steak when they're starving, not when they've just eaten.

[09:05] And so, like after an event, they've just had like this massive feast.

[09:09] And so like, I'm good for a while.

[09:10] Like, I got my value.

[09:12] And so it's like, oh, let me open loop the fact that there's going to be another thing that's

[09:16] coming and it's even better than this thing.

[09:18] If you like, think you like this, wait until dessert, right?

[09:21] And you just keep pushing it out.

[09:23] We learn this because my turn spike that one of these massive events is like 2 million bucks

[09:27] on the event to just make it this like wild, crazy thing.

[09:29] Everyone's like, this was awesome.

[09:30] Thank you so much.

[09:31] Like, you know what?

[09:32] But sure, and going into the event went down.

[09:37] It says, okay, how do I get that to stay?

[09:39] It's like, oh, you just always have one that they know that they can come to.

[09:44] And then I think put it past that 12 month and you'll be golden.

[09:47] All right, so events, I'm going to put two bullets here.

[09:50] Number one is have next plant.

[10:00] And then lock after six to 12.

[10:07] Oops, months.

[10:10] Make it something people earn.

[10:12] From a value perspective of something else to add as a bonus, like conferences events,

[10:16] things like that tend to have real price tags associated with them.

[10:20] And if you're charging $7, you're like, well, normally I would charge $99 for this

[10:24] two-day virtual event or something.

[10:26] You get that, and again, you can put it later on so that they lean into staying for it.

[10:33] As an aside and probably, and obviously point, but I might as well make it,

[10:37] you can also sell stuff at those events.

[10:39] It's there out there.

[10:41] Like, why don't you know, because you don't want to be spamming too much.

[10:44] So if you have to speak, you don't let them sell it all.

[10:47] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[11:17] no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[11:47] no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

[12:17] no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

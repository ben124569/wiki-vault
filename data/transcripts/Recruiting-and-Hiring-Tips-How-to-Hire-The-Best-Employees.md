[00:00] What's going on everyone?

[00:01] I wanted to, I'll probably make a couple of podcasts

[00:04] about my day yesterday, but it was our quarterly meetup

[00:08] for our leadership.

[00:09] And there was kind of, you know,

[00:11] there's a few kind of, I don't know what I'm saying,

[00:12] teaching moments, but moments where I was kind of able

[00:14] to transfer some of my, you know, more updated beliefs

[00:17] about how companies should run that they were like,

[00:20] man, I wish we'd record this,

[00:21] like, they would have been such a good podcast.

[00:23] And so I want to try and do my best

[00:25] and kind of cover some of those points with you here,

[00:28] so you can almost be like a fly on the wall

[00:30] in some of those meetings.

[00:31] And so the first one was about the role of HR.

[00:35] Now, before all of the entrepreneurs who are listening to this,

[00:38] you know, have their eyes glaze over,

[00:41] this is probably the first to podcast I've ever made

[00:43] about HR and human resources.

[00:46] But I think it's incredibly important

[00:49] and it's not just about if you have any HR department.

[00:53] So for many of you, you might only have a handful of employees

[00:56] or you're a manager at a company,

[00:58] so if entrepreneurs, if you have a manager or a series

[01:01] of managers or leaders in the company,

[01:02] I think for them to understand what the role of human resources

[01:07] and investing in employees looks like,

[01:10] I think it'd be valuable.

[01:11] So I'm gonna start with a story of HR gone wrong

[01:16] and then kind of go from there

[01:17] and kind of dissect it as like a little mini case study

[01:21] or to the best of my ability.

[01:22] And so to expound upon the many lessons and failures

[01:26] that I have had in running the business,

[01:32] a few a year or two ago, we had an HR director.

[01:38] And they, I'll just tell you what happened.

[01:42] So she had taken upon herself

[01:45] because she didn't have enough work.

[01:47] I know this, but she doesn't know this.

[01:49] It was because she didn't have enough work.

[01:50] She had overhired, she had six people in her department.

[01:54] Six people in HR can you imagine?

[01:57] Six, we had 100% like six people,

[02:00] like it's so many people.

[02:02] So she had a lot of people

[02:03] and no one had any work to do.

[02:05] And so she took it upon herself to do a salary analysis

[02:09] which is basically a study of how much

[02:11] everyone in the company, quote, should be getting paid

[02:16] based on the role, their experience,

[02:19] with the markets playing and where they live.

[02:22] And this took like 90 days for her to do this

[02:25] for every single person in the company.

[02:26] And so she used up a lot of company resources,

[02:29] three, four, five employees, et cetera,

[02:31] for this period of time to do the study.

[02:36] And the results of the study was that she had determined

[02:39] that, I don't know, 20% or 25% of the company

[02:43] was being overpaid and then 20% or 25% of the company

[02:46] was being underpaid and then about 50% of the company

[02:48] was being paid appropriately.

[02:50] And so the conclusion that she came to was, well,

[02:53] I'm gonna email everyone and just say,

[02:55] if they were being overpaid, they were gonna stay there

[02:59] because you're not gonna give people pay cuts.

[03:02] If they're adequately paid, they'll stay where they're at.

[03:05] And if someone's being underpaid,

[03:07] well, email them and say, hey, you just gotta write,

[03:09] congratulations, right?

[03:12] And so this may have been the single stupidest thing

[03:16] that I've ever seen someone do in my entire life.

[03:20] But that was the decision that was made.

[03:22] And so this was reported to me at a,

[03:26] what do you call it, at our quarterly.

[03:29] And this was actually her accomplishment for the quarter.

[03:32] And I just remember just being so,

[03:36] so bewildered, befuddled, dumbfounded

[03:42] by the fact that this person, the human being,

[03:44] had thought that this was a good use

[03:47] of company resources.

[03:49] And so I'm gonna break down the many reasons

[03:51] why this is not a good idea,

[03:52] or this was a terrible thing.

[03:54] And then kind of out when I believe

[03:57] the ideal role of a Charizard in a company.

[04:00] So the reason this was terrible was that,

[04:06] so she literally used company resources,

[04:08] probably $100,000 of payroll resources

[04:10] to create this solution that then just paid out

[04:14] more money from the company,

[04:17] which is just my wallet, it's just my bank account, right?

[04:20] And just paid out more money for no reason.

[04:23] And did it in a way that anybody who got paid more

[04:26] had no explanation for why they were getting paid more

[04:29] and provided no value.

[04:30] So she literally wasted money doing it,

[04:32] wasted money for that point going forward in the company

[04:34] because after someone gets it,

[04:35] and I could just be like, oh, by the way,

[04:36] she was wrong, sorry about that.

[04:37] And then we're just gonna keep you back where you were.

[04:41] And so I think the whole thing probably cost me

[04:43] like $600,000 in profit, right?

[04:45] Like I mean, more than she was going to get paid for years,

[04:50] right?

[04:51] And it just seemed like just a small thing,

[04:52] like, oh, it's just the company, right?

[04:54] And so this is where, if you're a manager

[04:56] in a bigger company or you direct,

[04:58] if you report directly to the CEO of the owner,

[05:01] you have to understand this, right?

[05:03] And so yesterday at our quarterly,

[05:06] our current HR director,

[05:09] that direct director's not worth it anymore,

[05:12] was bringing up her,

[05:13] she was kind of giving her position on what she believed

[05:19] her value to the company was.

[05:20] And I ended up kind of giving a talk about this in general.

[05:24] And so this is, for my current HR director,

[05:26] this is not about our conversation or anything like that,

[05:29] but this is just in general for everyone.

[05:32] So I wrote some notes down

[05:34] because I think it was really important.

[05:36] And so one of the things that I hear a lot is,

[05:39] my role is to make employees happy, all right?

[05:42] So I'm gonna just piece by piece.

[05:44] Your job is not to make employees happy.

[05:47] As an owner, your job is not to make employees happy,

[05:50] as a manager, your job is not to make employees happy,

[05:52] as any charter actor, your job is not to make employees happy.

[05:55] Employees job is to make employees happy.

[05:58] Human beings are responsible for making themselves happy.

[06:01] There are people in Auschwitz,

[06:02] who wrote books about how they were happy,

[06:03] and there are people in America living in the top 1%

[06:07] of earners of the whole world who are miserable and depressed.

[06:12] All right, your job is not to make people happy.

[06:15] People choose to be happy based on their own beliefs

[06:18] about their circumstances and what their thoughts are

[06:21] independent from the actual things that are happening to them.

[06:25] So first off, it is not your responsibility.

[06:27] It is your responsibility to try and find people

[06:29] who are in a positive inclination

[06:31] who are gonna fit in with the culture

[06:33] so that we can keep an atmosphere that does retain

[06:36] the tract talent, which is the next thing I'm gonna get to.

[06:39] But your job is not to make people happy.

[06:42] All right, number two, one of the things I heard

[06:47] is that employees are my customer.

[06:49] If you're a manager or your nature writer,

[06:52] or like, well, really, everyone who works here is my customer.

[06:56] Incorrect, that is not who your customer is.

[06:58] Your customer is the company.

[07:00] All right, and now I'm gonna be clear about this.

[07:02] The company has three stakeholders.

[07:03] You've got shareholders, the people who own the company.

[07:06] You've got customers, the people who pay the company,

[07:10] and then you've got employees, the people who run the company.

[07:12] All three stakeholders have to be considered.

[07:15] Now, the reason this is an important delineation

[07:18] is that if you have it, HR director who is like,

[07:21] employees first, then you have the type of stupid, stupid

[07:27] decision that I just discussed in the very beginning,

[07:29] which is literally just paying out profit,

[07:33] for no value, all right?

[07:35] And this is an important point that I need to cover,

[07:38] which kind of leads naturally to the next thing.

[07:39] Is that in order for a company to grow,

[07:43] it has to have profit in order for it to weather storms

[07:50] that it does not see that are going to come in the future

[07:53] and needs to have profit to be able to reinvest

[07:55] in new product lines, in legal defense,

[07:58] in whatever could possibly happen.

[08:01] And when you just choose to buy things for no value,

[08:05] which is essentially what it is when you just overpay,

[08:08] then you put your company in a bad position.

[08:10] So let me explain.

[08:11] So an investor looks at any kind of asset.

[08:14] And at company, the assets of the company are the humans,

[08:18] right?

[08:19] Or the human capital, it's the actual value that you get

[08:21] from people, especially if you're in a service business, right?

[08:24] And so you have the value is what you get

[08:28] and price is what you pay, right?

[08:31] And the goal, I want to be very transparent about this,

[08:33] of the company is to pay as little as possible

[08:37] for as the highest amount of value.

[08:39] And that may make people uncomfortable.

[08:41] But the point of all businesses is to give to get as much

[08:47] pride.

[08:48] They want to have as big of a discrepancy as possible.

[08:49] So if I'm an investor and I'm buying stocks,

[08:52] I want to buy the most valuable company that I can

[08:54] for the least amount of money, right?

[08:56] It's a price to value discrepancy, right?

[08:58] And the bigger that discrepancy, the better it is.

[08:59] Now, if it's the reverse, you're paying more for less value,

[09:02] that is a bad deal.

[09:03] It doesn't matter what you're paying, it's a bad deal, right?

[09:07] And so the reason that that first HR director

[09:09] made such a terrible decision was because she literally

[09:11] just chose to take it, literally take our good deals

[09:14] and just say, hey, we're going to make bad deals now.

[09:16] And all of our bad deals are going to keep as bad deals, right?

[09:19] It just, it just, it just, it made no sense whatsoever.

[09:24] And so that's, that is what we're like,

[09:29] that is the goal here, right?

[09:31] And finally, when I was talking to Ari Turner

[09:37] director about this, she pushed back on this.

[09:39] She was, no, sorry, not her.

[09:41] But like you might have any Turner director,

[09:43] you might have a major way to push back on this idea.

[09:44] And so I just want, and the two different,

[09:46] two different scenarios came up that we were walking for.

[09:50] And one of them is, well, you as the entrepreneur,

[09:54] you always value the marketing and sales more

[09:58] than the rest of the company.

[10:00] And I could see that there was some being

[10:03] it odds with that, right?

[10:04] I don't know if I agree with that.

[10:07] And I want to be 100% clear.

[10:08] I do value marketing sales in product more than operations.

[10:15] Here's why.

[10:18] Not that long ago, there was a period of time where I had mentors

[10:21] who were like, you need to put operations first, right?

[10:23] This is part of scaling.

[10:24] You have to delegate blah, blah, blah.

[10:26] And so there was a period of time where

[10:27] I put operations on a pedestal and it was like, no, guys,

[10:29] we need to just do what operations wants us to do.

[10:32] And to be clear for definition, operations is everything

[10:34] that is non-core to the value of the company.

[10:37] That is IT, that is HR, that is finance, that's legal.

[10:43] All of those comprise operations.

[10:47] And to be clear about what that means is,

[10:49] it's everything that must happen to keep the company running,

[10:53] but it's not a core value driver

[10:55] for top-line revenue or for customers.

[10:58] And so marketing brings revenue in product delivers value

[11:03] that is being exchanged for money.

[11:04] That's fundamentally what a company does.

[11:06] It's got stuff and it sells it, right?

[11:08] And as long as you're delivering the stuff or your,

[11:11] or you're selling the stuff that is being delivered,

[11:15] those are core value to the company.

[11:17] Everything else absolutely must happen.

[11:19] But in general, they're not the main value drivers.

[11:23] Now, that being said, there are ways

[11:25] that those other components can provide value indirectly.

[11:29] And that's what I'm going to cover in this,

[11:30] because I think being in HR director

[11:32] or being a manager in a company and being in one of those roles,

[11:34] if you're clear on that, you will be more valuable to your owner.

[11:37] And if you're interviewing for a position

[11:39] and you talk the way that I'm telling you right now,

[11:41] to talk to an owner, you will probably get the job

[11:44] and probably stay there because they will know

[11:46] that you'll understand what you're talking about.

[11:48] So the example, she said, well,

[11:52] I feel like you care more about sales and marketing

[11:55] and I said, yes, I do, and here's why.

[11:58] And by the way, when I did that operational thing

[12:00] and put operations first, the company started going down,

[12:04] and we started making less money,

[12:05] and it was painful and horrible,

[12:06] and I had to basically jump back in and be like,

[12:09] I'm so sorry about that.

[12:10] That was not a good idea.

[12:11] We are keeping the value we provide

[12:13] and marketing and sales primary.

[12:15] And operations is secondary to that.

[12:18] It is a supporting role.

[12:19] So if sales says, hey, we need contracts to be changed

[12:24] because this is the new offer or whatever,

[12:26] then operations has to say, all right,

[12:28] we're gonna go figure that out, right?

[12:29] And that is the point.

[12:31] The point is that operation should support

[12:32] and always enable sales marketing and product.

[12:36] So she said, well, I feel like you value,

[12:42] like a star salesman more than you value

[12:46] like a front line customer service person.

[12:49] And so there was a decision that this is come up.

[12:55] It was a million times over the years.

[12:56] It's like, I think you value these positions more.

[12:59] And I always have to unacquivocally say, I do.

[13:03] Yes, because people,

[13:04] and I feel like this is, I don't understand an employee thinger.

[13:07] It's just like, they feel like it's like a bad word.

[13:10] For me to be like, no, no, no, no,

[13:11] I do care about more about marketing sales products.

[13:14] Period.

[13:15] Period.

[13:17] Because they are the major drivers of value in the company.

[13:20] All right.

[13:21] And so, for example, if you had a chat home's word

[13:24] about this in his book,

[13:26] if you have a superstar salesperson,

[13:28] this is what I was talking about to the whole company.

[13:30] I was like, if you have a superstar salesperson,

[13:32] and that person is being paid

[13:36] quote above market, right, above market value,

[13:39] there's two ways of seeing market value.

[13:41] There's market value, which is like,

[13:42] what is the rest of the market paying for this, right?

[13:45] And then what am I getting in return

[13:48] for this specific person?

[13:49] So for like, if you have an all-star salesperson,

[13:52] like you may have gone through 20 salespeople to find

[13:54] and all-star salesperson for your specific company,

[13:57] your specific product, right?

[13:58] Because there are some salespeople who excel

[14:02] in, let's say, B to C transactional sales, all right?

[14:04] And there's some who excel in, you know,

[14:07] a longer style B to B consultative sales.

[14:09] And there are some salespeople who excel

[14:11] in account management in kind of upselling

[14:13] and kind of like the farming and continuing to grow

[14:16] in account, right?

[14:17] Those are all sales, they're just different.

[14:19] And so I could find a salesperson, right?

[14:22] But that person might not perfectly fit my company

[14:24] and I might not yield the same outcome.

[14:27] And so if I have, for example,

[14:28] somebody who's selling really well

[14:30] and sells more than three times, you know,

[14:34] it would take me two or three normal,

[14:37] quote, normal salespeople to replace their production.

[14:39] And this is common in the most companies.

[14:41] Most people have multiple salespeople.

[14:43] There's one person, you know, one or two people

[14:45] always like lead the pack disproportionately, right?

[14:49] And that person, right?

[14:53] And in many conversations, this is one of them.

[14:56] It's like, well, if that person came up to you,

[14:59] for example, and said, well, I want a 20% pay raise

[15:01] or a 10% pay raise, she was like,

[15:03] I disagree with that.

[15:04] And I was like, I think that's stupid

[15:05] that you disagree with that.

[15:06] I was like, make the economic argument.

[15:07] If we lose that person and then we lose half of our sales,

[15:10] how can you tell me that was not worth 10% more

[15:13] on their base salary?

[15:16] So I had not about like that.

[15:17] I was like, right, you need to think like an owner, right?

[15:19] You got to think like an owner.

[15:20] What am I losing here, right?

[15:22] Into the same degree, the core layer to that

[15:25] is like, well, I feel like you don't value customer

[15:27] service as much.

[15:28] What if we get an amazing customer service role?

[15:29] This is kind of like the counter example, right?

[15:31] Well, I feel like you're willing to, you know,

[15:33] pay these people more than you are willing to pay these people.

[15:35] And it's like, yes, I am because they provide more value.

[15:38] And I was like, okay, I hear where you're coming from.

[15:41] What if this person doesn't an amazing job in customer service?

[15:43] And I was like, I get it.

[15:45] So let's say this person disappears tomorrow.

[15:48] How much less are we gonna make?

[15:50] So probably not a lot.

[15:52] I was like, right.

[15:53] And so if you wanted to, you know, come to me with a,

[15:56] you know, customer service person and say,

[15:58] this person, you know, saves,

[16:00] X% of people per month and that results in this much money

[16:05] and the aggregate of adding a dollar per hour example

[16:08] to this person's role

[16:10] still doesn't compare to what everyone else on the team is saving

[16:13] which would be like what I would consider market, right?

[16:15] Like if I just brought some in whose average

[16:17] and this person's way above average,

[16:19] let's say this person saves, you know,

[16:21] 25% of the whole team saves is from this one person.

[16:25] Then I'd be like, okay, well, there's a number value to that

[16:27] and, you know, we can incrementally add a certain amount

[16:31] that would mean it was worth keeping, right?

[16:35] And I was like, but in this example we're talking about,

[16:38] if this person stopped and just was going,

[16:41] I was like, how much do you think that the company would make less?

[16:45] Choose like it probably wouldn't change the revenue

[16:46] and I was like, right.

[16:48] And for that reason, that is how market value is established.

[16:52] And so for everyone, it's like, this is the real world.

[16:55] All right, like I don't know what the Harvard business review,

[16:59] you know, says about making happy employees

[17:01] and like all this, you know, whatever, who do.

[17:05] But in the real world, you don't get a trophy.

[17:08] All right, not everyone's first, not everyone makes

[17:10] the most amount of money.

[17:11] You get paid based on the value that you provide

[17:14] and a good owner understands that, right?

[17:17] And so when we're having these discussions,

[17:22] I think that it was good for our whole company

[17:25] to understand and see like, that's the point here.

[17:29] Like the point is to make a profit.

[17:30] The point is to pay as little as possible

[17:34] for as much value as possible, right?

[17:36] And assess the value of the individual

[17:39] based on what they contribute to the bottom line, right?

[17:42] And so, you know, to wrap this up, if you were, you know,

[17:44] for HR in general, human resources,

[17:48] it's like, well, then how do I provide value?

[17:51] You provide value by one, protecting the company

[17:55] in all ways, all right?

[17:57] And the way that you do that is first

[18:00] when people come to you and say, hey, I wanna hire so and so,

[18:02] your first answer should probably be no.

[18:05] Give me a reason why your team is so overworked

[18:09] that they can't just work more, right?

[18:11] Show me your hour-to-hour utilization that you have.

[18:14] Like, and I'll tell you right now

[18:16] and I've said it in the past, a lot of people don't work that hard.

[18:19] All right, and a lot of people will say

[18:21] that they are overworked because they literally do not

[18:23] understand what work is.

[18:27] All the time, I know this for a fact,

[18:29] there's some of you listening to this right now

[18:30] who spend your entire day not working, trying to work.

[18:34] So I'm an all day getting fuck all done

[18:37] because you're in your head

[18:38] and you literally have an inability to focus.

[18:41] That is not a company's fault.

[18:44] That is your lack of ability

[18:46] in being disciplined and learning the skills

[18:48] of learning how to work.

[18:50] Like, you have to get, you just have to,

[18:53] you have to get things done, you know?

[18:55] And so many people don't get much done in their whole day

[18:58] and then say, hey, I need help

[18:59] but it's really like, they aren't actually overworked.

[19:02] They actually just don't know how to work.

[19:04] All right.

[19:05] And mind you, this is not, this is a lesson that I learned

[19:07] because I was younger once

[19:09] and I was started working at a law firm as an intern.

[19:12] And I remember a senior partner jokingly said to me

[19:15] she was like, you don't even know what work is yet.

[19:20] She's like, you haven't even learned how to work.

[19:22] And I was like offended, but then I saw how

[19:25] hard these people worked and lawyers worked there.

[19:27] In hard, hard law firms, they worked their asses off.

[19:30] And I was like, huh, it's probably right.

[19:34] And I started observing the habits of the people

[19:36] work more and how much more they got done.

[19:39] So anyways, point is that people will come and try

[19:42] and hire for help when there really isn't,

[19:44] it's not necessary.

[19:45] And so that does not protect the company.

[19:46] It also doesn't protect the employees

[19:48] because of the companies that risk everyone's at risk.

[19:50] So you have to put the company first.

[19:53] And so that's thinking like an owner.

[19:55] So that's number one.

[19:57] Number two is that you have our active in recruiting

[20:01] the best talent, right?

[20:03] Because everyone knows that the value of the company

[20:05] is going to be based on the value of the people.

[20:06] Who not the what?

[20:08] A good who will figure out the what?

[20:10] And so really good HR is really good recruitment.

[20:14] It's talent, right?

[20:15] It's finding the talent, developing the talent,

[20:18] retaining the talent.

[20:19] Now, obviously not all of that's going to fall under HR,

[20:21] right?

[20:21] Recruiting absolutely.

[20:23] Developing is going to be more underneath

[20:25] of the departments.

[20:26] And retaining is going to be a function of really

[20:28] the department heads and then the compensation packages, right?

[20:30] But the thing is that I want to be clear here.

[20:37] If you, and this is, I'm going to wrap this back

[20:40] in the original story.

[20:42] When the HR director, the former HR director,

[20:45] did this big salary in LSS and she said,

[20:47] hey, this is our big success, which is paying people more.

[20:50] And we got nothing back in value as a company, right?

[20:54] I was like, why did we do this?

[21:01] And that's the hard question that obviously she wasn't able

[21:04] to answer.

[21:04] I was like, why did you, did it because she had nothing to do, right?

[21:08] But that's actually why she did it.

[21:09] But I was like, what, what problem were we solving here?

[21:13] What was the objective of this?

[21:17] And the answer there was not, right?

[21:19] Because the only reason that you would want

[21:24] to move compensation is for one of two things, either

[21:27] you cannot attract talent or you cannot retain talent.

[21:32] So what I mean by that is like, the only reason

[21:35] to really increase someone's pay if they are already

[21:38] working for you is because you value them enough

[21:42] that replacing them with someone else who has

[21:44] a company still set would not the marginal difference

[21:46] to not be, like if the marginal difference is huge, right?

[21:50] Then you'd be incentivized to retain them, right?

[21:52] And you as a company in this type of that it was

[21:54] an example have a problem retaining employees.

[21:58] We at Jim launch, do not have that problem.

[22:00] We have incredibly low attrition.

[22:03] We fire people like crazy, but people don't quit.

[22:07] And that's because we have a really high performance

[22:10] culture.

[22:10] People don't last.

[22:11] You know what I mean?

[22:13] Like sorry, low performance don't last.

[22:16] I heard this from Greg Cardham, but I really liked it.

[22:17] It's like Jim wants his dangerous place to work.

[22:19] Like if you come in and you get on the train,

[22:22] like you will learn more from me and us

[22:24] and running a company and learning how to grow things

[22:26] than ever before, but you got to perform.

[22:29] Like this is a winner's environment.

[22:31] And if you are a winner, you will love it here.

[22:33] And if you are not a winner, you will not.

[22:34] I mean, you won't be here very long, right?

[22:36] Because the thing is, when you have ever played

[22:38] on a high performance sports team in your whole life,

[22:40] at some point, or any kind of team that's high performing,

[22:42] that was a winning team.

[22:44] Usually there's a culture that if someone is new and comes in,

[22:48] that either assimilate or objected.

[22:50] And the stronger that core team is is like,

[22:53] this is how we do it, right?

[22:55] We wake up at five.

[22:56] We go over our scripts, we roll play.

[22:58] We do game day preview from the day before on sales calls.

[23:01] Bob and Bob, it's et cetera.

[23:03] And someone knew it was like, oh man,

[23:04] that's you guys are waking up early.

[23:06] I'm not really about that life.

[23:07] Like the team will be like, dude,

[23:09] get this guy out of here.

[23:10] Like he's gonna take the team down.

[23:12] And so having that culture allows you to spit people

[23:18] out quickly, but it also allows you to retain.

[23:19] Now, this is my point earlier,

[23:22] which was why did this HR manager, director,

[23:26] make this call, right?

[23:28] And obviously he was cause she wasn't thinking, right?

[23:31] But there was no problem that she was trying to solve,

[23:34] which is I was like, this is a hard time for her,

[23:37] I can imagine, cause it was in front of the entire company.

[23:39] I was like, do we have a problem attracting talent?

[23:45] I was like, no, I was like, okay.

[23:47] So the pay that we are currently offering

[23:49] is we're having no issue finding talented people

[23:52] to work for these positions at these price points.

[23:56] It's like, no, it's like, okay.

[23:58] Do we have a major problem in attrition?

[24:00] Are we losing employees left and right to competitors

[24:04] who are paying more offering more

[24:06] or that we got headhunters picking off our people?

[24:09] It's like, no, it's like, then why did you just choose

[24:13] to spend $600 a year, more of bottom line?

[24:17] Profit.

[24:20] Why?

[24:23] In the answer she had none, right?

[24:25] And so it's making sure that we understand

[24:28] the why we're doing things, right?

[24:31] The point of the company is to buy value

[24:34] at the lowest possible price.

[24:36] That is the point, I don't care what anyone else says.

[24:38] That is the point, right?

[24:39] You're gonna try and pay for the value

[24:41] as little as you can because that discrepancy

[24:44] is where the profit is, right?

[24:46] There's a speed and real, that's where the profit is.

[24:47] You need to have it as a discrepancy

[24:48] in order to have a profit so that the company

[24:50] can continue to run, right?

[24:53] That's what it is.

[24:54] And so, anyhow, I share the story at the beginning

[24:58] because that is one of Zillion failures,

[25:03] you know, in lessons that I've learned along the way

[25:05] in this game.

[25:06] And if you have a star employee,

[25:09] I think a lot of times it is worth

[25:11] paying them more to keep them.

[25:12] Because you get, like, everyone knows that you have a star

[25:15] employee, they're usually worth, like,

[25:18] three or four employees, five employees in output, right?

[25:21] I'm probably worth a lot of employees in output

[25:24] in terms of top line revenue of this business.

[25:26] So I get disproportionately paid.

[25:28] Is it fair?

[25:29] I think, yes, it is fair.

[25:32] I think you should always be compensated

[25:34] based on the value they provide.

[25:35] I think that's the ultimate fairness.

[25:37] I don't think it's like, oh, he's a human,

[25:39] I'm a human, we should get paid the same thing.

[25:40] That doesn't make sense to me.

[25:41] All right, so I wanna make sure I hit all my points.

[25:43] Making employees happy is not your problem.

[25:46] It is their problem.

[25:47] It is their responsibility.

[25:48] Now you can equip them with tools and skills

[25:50] about mindset and whatnot.

[25:51] But like, ultimately, the accountability

[25:53] of who needs to make who happy,

[25:55] you need to make yourself happy.

[25:56] A job is not supposed to make you happy,

[25:57] because there are people who are endlessly happy

[25:59] in quote, terrible jobs and there are people

[26:01] who have amazing jobs and killed themselves.

[26:03] So it has nothing to do with you.

[26:05] Number one.

[26:05] Number two, your employees are not your customers, right?

[26:09] Your company is always your customer.

[26:11] Number one, because the company balances the priorities

[26:13] of everyone, the shareholders, the customers,

[26:16] and the employees.

[26:19] I'm a quote, middleman, between the employees

[26:21] and ownership, that is not true.

[26:23] You protect the company, right?

[26:26] These are false beliefs, these are not true, right?

[26:30] Undervaluing, people who are not top-lined value

[26:36] providing, right?

[26:36] They're not delivering on the value

[26:38] that we're selling or selling the value, right?

[26:40] That's, there's a fundamentally what a company does.

[26:42] Self-value, and then we deliver on the promise.

[26:45] That's it, right?

[26:45] And if you're not in one of those core things,

[26:49] unless you can make an argument

[26:50] for how you were directly providing value,

[26:55] then you will probably get paid less.

[26:57] And that's okay, and that's okay, right?

[27:03] Fundamentally thinking about all employees

[27:05] as units of value and ascribing a price to them, right?

[27:09] Which is what you pay them.

[27:10] And trying to always understand that you're always

[27:13] going to try and pay as little as you can

[27:14] for the most amount of value, right?

[27:16] That is, and that's okay.

[27:18] That's okay, that's the point, right?

[27:21] The only reason that you would pay more

[27:23] is if you have trouble attracting or retaining people,

[27:26] if you're not having any issues

[27:27] or attracting or retaining people,

[27:28] then you're paying fine, right?

[27:30] Like you don't need to change the cost.

[27:36] And so finally, that is what I will lead you with,

[27:39] or leave you with in this role of HR,

[27:43] and my many, many lessons along the way.

[27:46] I hope you enjoyed this and click subscribe,

[27:49] and all of that could stuff, but I have some passion with this

[27:53] because I've made these mistakes so many times

[27:56] and I've seen these mistakes made on my behalf.

[27:58] And so if you were a manager, if you're an HR director,

[28:02] take this the heart, you work for the company.

[28:06] The company is your only customer,

[28:09] and your responsibilities to protect the company,

[28:12] just like everyone else's responsibilities

[28:14] to protect the company.

[28:15] And if you can think like that, you will think like an owner,

[28:18] and you will move up in your company.

[28:21] If you live in a La La Land of,

[28:24] I'm supposed to just buy bean bags and have,

[28:27] and keep employees happy,

[28:30] one, you're gonna waste money,

[28:32] two, you're not gonna know what actually provides value

[28:34] in a business.

[28:35] And three, if you're in a different company,

[28:37] what may happen if you don't have like a candid owner,

[28:40] or whatever who wants to like talk real with you,

[28:43] they'll just kind of like put you in a corner, right?

[28:45] And then just be like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

[28:47] go do that little initiative,

[28:49] but they won't actually see you as valuable

[28:52] because it means because you don't get the game,

[28:54] like you don't get it, you have to understand it.

[28:57] And then people like you'll get into the encircle,

[29:02] I'm trying to say this the right way.

[29:06] You've probably had people in your life

[29:11] where you've got your friends, right?

[29:15] And you're like, she gets it, or he gets it, right?

[29:18] You talk to your friends, like, no, she gets it, right?

[29:19] She gets how we see the world, right?

[29:23] The thing is that most business owners

[29:25] see the world the same way.

[29:27] And that's why they are the owners of the business,

[29:29] and that's why they started the business,

[29:31] and that is probably what businesses grow.

[29:33] And so it is in your best interest to align

[29:36] with the company overall, because a good owner

[29:38] will put the company first, not themselves,

[29:41] because ultimately, the company feeds them.

[29:44] The company is the goose, the company is the beast,

[29:48] that feeds everyone, it is the thing that plows the field,

[29:50] it is the meal that everyone is fed off of.

[29:54] And so we have to keep the meal healthy,

[29:56] and that is by having discrepancies,

[29:57] and making the hard conversations,

[29:59] and making the hard calls, and being real with you,

[30:01] which is what I'm hopefully trying to do right now,

[30:02] which is, that is the point, all right?

[30:06] So, anywho, I hope that was valuable for you,

[30:08] I hope that made sense, hopefully you don't have to,

[30:10] to pay them any lessons and failures that I have,

[30:13] and if you have a major manager or manager

[30:16] who, you know, hires and argues for compensation,

[30:19] things like that, send this to him, if you think it's valuable.

[30:22] So, anyways, lots of love, get you soon, and bye.

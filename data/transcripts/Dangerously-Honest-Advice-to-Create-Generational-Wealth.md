[00:00] If you're watching this video, you probably want to create generational wealth.

[00:03] And guess what?

[00:04] It's not like rich kids are born with higher IQs.

[00:07] We already know that, but they do have advantages.

[00:09] So what are those advantages?

[00:10] The Leafs and Skills.

[00:12] And I'm going to do my absolute best to share as many of these in this video as you

[00:16] really possible.

[00:16] Number one, don't despise wealth.

[00:18] If you understand that ethical wealth creation is possible.

[00:21] If you secretly despise wealth, it will allude you.

[00:24] You can't hate rich people and then at the same time want to become one.

[00:27] I mean, I guess you could, but it'd be kind of weird.

[00:28] And so some poor parents unintentionally teach their kids that money is scarce and that

[00:33] rich people are greedy or bad.

[00:35] Now the flip side is that wealthy parents teach that money is everywhere.

[00:38] And that creating value deserves some sort of worth or exchange.

[00:42] And that's the fundamentalism capitalism.

[00:44] It's voluntary exchange.

[00:46] Keyword is voluntary.

[00:48] Two people choose to interact, choose to make a trade.

[00:51] And the beautiful thing about capitalism is both people say thank you.

[00:54] It's one of the only things in human nature where people do things.

[00:57] And both people say they give you.

[00:58] You go to the cash register, you buy the shoes, the store owner says thank you and you say thank

[01:01] you.

[01:02] Both people have a net positive some from the exchange.

[01:05] And that's how overall economies grow.

[01:07] If you want to grow your own personal economy, the idea is how can I create as many of these

[01:11] positive some exchanges as possible.

[01:14] And if you do enough of those positive exchanges, like why would you not want lots of people

[01:17] to thank you?

[01:18] Because if a lot of people thank you, that it means that you were doing something good

[01:21] that people exchange money for it.

[01:22] And if you do that a lot of times, you'll have a lot of money.

[01:24] How did this somewhere get distorted?

[01:25] Now a lot of that's media and I'll try to make my own version of media so that I can

[01:30] have a very small voice that says something a little different.

[01:32] But at the end of the day, money is just a tool.

[01:34] It allows you to exchange.

[01:35] It's literally just an intermediary for exchange.

[01:37] And as a result, it will lubricate the number of exchanges that you make.

[01:42] If you're somebody who tends to do bad stuff, when you have more tools to do bad stuff,

[01:47] you do more bad stuff.

[01:48] If you're a good person, I want to even try to define that.

[01:52] But let's just say good person, who has a tool, they will be able to do.

[01:55] More good stuff.

[01:56] You're probably not going to be able to create generational wealth if you hate money.

[02:01] But most people can't even take a shot because they actually believe in one of the biggest

[02:04] slides that's out there is that passive income equals, yes.

[02:09] Let me explain.

[02:10] Passive to you means active to someone else.

[02:13] There's always someone who is active.

[02:15] It's less of a binary of active versus passive and it's a continuum.

[02:19] And so it's like, where do you live on this continuum?

[02:21] Let's say this is all active and this is all passive.

[02:24] It's very rare that you have things that are purely here.

[02:26] Now you can absolutely buy a dividend ETF.

[02:28] And like the only thing that's not passive about that is making all the decision and doing

[02:32] all the research in order to do that and whatever work you did in order to get the money.

[02:36] But beyond that, yes, the difference that you get from that would be passive.

[02:40] The thing is is that most people who see rich people assume that they have all of this

[02:44] passive money that's coming in.

[02:46] All the richest people that I know for sure have passive income, but they've got way more

[02:50] active income.

[02:51] And people are trying to get rich on passive when they're like make active income cool

[02:56] again.

[02:57] I'll tell you a story.

[02:58] We own an advisory practice as part of acquisition.com, right?

[03:01] Which is where it's functionally like management consulting.

[03:03] We go in, we look at a company, we help them grow.

[03:05] That's what we do.

[03:06] It's actually true customer work.

[03:07] It's not like courses and coaching or anything like that.

[03:09] It's like we actually have that.

[03:10] It's unfortunate at the internet space just like automatically assumes that that's what

[03:13] everything is.

[03:14] But like all the guys that I have are X, Harvard, XMBA, XMKNZ, XPCG, XBane, like consultants,

[03:19] that work with big companies.

[03:20] And that's because we can help companies grow.

[03:22] I work with some companies in a very, very, you know, acute format where I'll spend a day with

[03:28] call like tennis founders and we'll go really deep on some of the strategies in their business.

[03:32] And they pay for that.

[03:34] And someone might see that and say, Alex, why would you trade time for money?

[03:38] Well, think about it like this.

[03:40] If I'm going to work, no matter what.

[03:43] So let's just say Monday through Friday, I work 12 hours a day.

[03:46] 60 hours a week.

[03:47] So if I'm going to work Monday through Friday and I have something else that can make

[03:51] me more money for that time, why would I not do it?

[03:54] Because then I can turn around and take that active income and then say, hey, maybe I'm going

[03:58] to take some of that and trade it for some money over here.

[04:00] It's a little bit left.

[04:01] It's a little bit moving that way.

[04:03] In over time, you just increase the amount that you make per hour on the active side.

[04:07] And then you have a percentage that goes on pass it.

[04:10] But the thing is is that as you become more and more skilled, your active will proportionally

[04:14] increase.

[04:15] What I'm going to say is people will spend 100 hours trying to make a hundred dollars

[04:18] a month pass if.

[04:19] When they could have just made $10,000 getting paid for their active time, that's a bad

[04:23] trade.

[04:24] And so what everyone seems to forget is that the people with passive income often had massive

[04:28] income first.

[04:29] It's like going to the gym.

[04:30] You have to put in the active work in the gym for a very long period of time before eventually

[04:34] you can have a passive body, meaning like you can just work out once a week and more

[04:39] less maintain your physique.

[04:40] But it takes a long time to get there.

[04:42] And so everybody trades their time for money.

[04:44] It's just about how much leverage you get, how much you get per hour in.

[04:50] And so max out your active earning hours first.

[04:53] Until you have truly gotten all your passive to the point where it can pass your current

[04:58] lifestyle.

[04:59] But the thing is is the vast majority of people that I've made have made a tremendous amount

[05:01] of money.

[05:02] Usually have a period of time where they do the cocktails on the beach.

[05:05] And then they come back and they say, yeah, that wasn't for me.

[05:07] Too a person.

[05:08] Like I'm talking like I can't even think of one off the top of my head that hasn't

[05:12] said that.

[05:13] With this myth and the thing is is the myth keeps you poor because you make those trades.

[05:17] You spend a thousand hours working so you can make a thousand dollars a month rather

[05:21] than taking the thousand hours and continuing to up level your skills so you can trade those

[05:26] hours for higher dollars.

[05:28] So I'll give you a business example for you.

[05:30] And this is going to be a little bit more advanced, but bear with me.

[05:33] So let's say that you've got the opportunity to have a $10 per month customer.

[05:37] Okay.

[05:38] And that person's going to stay for 60 months.

[05:40] Okay.

[05:41] Now people would see this and say $10 a month.

[05:43] That means it's super low-churn.

[05:45] This much would be very valuable business.

[05:46] Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble.

[05:47] If you could get that same customer to pay a thousand dollars upfront for a lifetime deal,

[05:54] should you do it?

[05:55] Yes.

[05:56] Yes.

[05:57] A thousand dollars is worth more than 600.

[05:58] But the thing is is that people obsess about this and forget about this and they do this

[06:03] in their businesses and they do this with their time.

[06:05] And so once you've focused on active income, you need to understand something that separates

[06:09] wealthy from everyone else who stays stuck.

[06:12] Number three, it's your fault.

[06:16] Something's like, these three words will get you out of poverty.

[06:19] It's my fault.

[06:21] So one of the best ways to stay poor is blame everyone else for your problems.

[06:25] And I want to be clear, it might not be your fault.

[06:28] But it still is your problem.

[06:29] And so maybe I should better say this to less trigger people.

[06:32] But it's your problem.

[06:33] And so no one else is going to solve it for you.

[06:35] Your trauma is real.

[06:36] Your problems are valid.

[06:38] And absolutely no one is coming to save you.

[06:40] And once you accept that, you become dangerous.

[06:43] It actually doesn't matter if it's your fault.

[06:45] But it is your problem.

[06:46] You have to solve it because no one else will.

[06:48] And that allows you to actually do something about it.

[06:50] My dad came to this country the thousand dollars to his name.

[06:53] But he bought me a lot of lessons, including accountability.

[06:56] If my father had been a hedge fund manager, managing $20 billion dollars, I would have a very

[07:00] different life.

[07:01] I knew what Baltimore rich was, right?

[07:04] My dad's a doctor.

[07:05] And I eventually saw what Vanderbilt and New York money was.

[07:08] New York finance money, New York real estate money.

[07:09] I was like, holy cow.

[07:11] And so I was rubbing shoulders with some of the world's wealthiest people when I went

[07:14] there.

[07:15] And it like completely shifted my worldview of like honestly just what is possible.

[07:19] Beliefs, declarative knowledge, knowing about something.

[07:22] I didn't know this was possible.

[07:23] I didn't know about this stuff.

[07:25] Investment baking, I had never heard of it.

[07:27] M&A, merges and acquisitions, private equity.

[07:29] I didn't heard of any of this stuff.

[07:31] Literally the highest income vehicle I had heard of at the time was just become a doctor.

[07:35] And doctors make good money.

[07:36] I like my goal was a hundred thousand dollars a year.

[07:39] So I say this to you guys, like I don't think like I somehow like spring into existence

[07:44] with billion dollar aspirations.

[07:46] Like I just wanted to make a hundred grand.

[07:48] That was the goal for a while.

[07:50] And the thing is is that average parents will blame the economy, the government or the

[07:54] system.

[07:55] We have these disadvantages.

[07:56] It's harder for people like us.

[07:59] They'll save those things.

[08:00] And more importantly, their kids will believe them.

[08:03] And then as a result, change their behavior to make it antithetical or unlikely to them

[08:07] actually getting out.

[08:08] And so their parents hurt their kids to protect their ego.

[08:11] And I'm saying both ego's, they protect their child's ego and they protect their own ego.

[08:15] But if they were able to say, we're not rich because I don't have the skills.

[08:19] And I never learn them.

[08:21] But I want you to.

[08:22] And so how do you operationalize this?

[08:24] Going all the way to the bottom.

[08:26] You use which you've got.

[08:28] So once you figure out that it's your fault, people wait for perfect conditions to start.

[08:35] When in reality, starting is the perfect condition.

[08:38] And that's when you can start actually making decisions that lead to wealth, like understanding

[08:42] principal number four.

[08:44] Solve, rich, peoples, problems.

[08:46] You solve for each people problems because they pay better.

[08:48] And when you solve for each people problems, you get to charge rich people prices.

[08:51] And here's why this matters.

[08:52] If somebody got a hundred dollars in their bank account and you're asking for 50, you're

[08:56] asking for 50% of their net worth.

[08:58] So for them, it's a very important decision.

[09:00] But that same $50 might be less than 1% of a rich person's net worth.

[09:04] So they don't even care.

[09:05] It would just be the equivalent of trying to sell $1 to that person with a hundred dollars

[09:09] in their bank account.

[09:10] They probably would barely even notice it.

[09:12] And so most parents teach kids to get a job serving anyone who will hire them.

[09:17] Well, the parents teach kids to target specifically high value markets with specific

[09:23] problems that higher skills can help solve.

[09:25] Locusing on serving viable markets, not just any market, is what they transfer to their

[09:30] kids.

[09:31] I mean, the easiest way to figure out where the money is at is to look at who's already

[09:35] rich and see what they're doing.

[09:37] Things like, no one gets rich on passive income.

[09:39] They get rich on active income.

[09:41] And then it goes passive and then they talk about it.

[09:44] But here's where most people go wrong, even when they're solving valuable problems.

[09:48] They're obsessed with the wrong side of the wealth equation, which is number five.

[09:53] And this is going to ruffle some feathers.

[09:55] You want to prioritize earning over saving.

[09:57] So one of the biggest mistakes poor people make is they think they can save their way

[10:00] to wealth.

[10:01] The truth is, it's better to focus on how to ten extra income than saving additional

[10:05] 10%.

[10:06] Because the thing is is that at the absolute hypothetical max, all you can do is save 100%.

[10:10] You could live odd enough thing.

[10:11] You could live on the streets and somehow show up to work or whatever it is that you do

[10:13] to make money and save 100% of what you make.

[10:16] But the thing is, if you're making $30,000 a year, it's just like, it takes forever.

[10:21] Even at 100%.

[10:22] This is not an efficiency problem.

[10:24] This is an absolute volume issue.

[10:26] You have an income problem, not a spending issue, as much as people are irresponsible with

[10:31] their spending.

[10:32] And they are.

[10:33] I think they're more irresponsible with how little they try to optimize their earning.

[10:38] I'll give you a couple of very easy examples.

[10:40] You can do the exact same job in a different city and make 30 to 40% more.

[10:46] And work remote.

[10:47] You can just work remote to a different company and make significantly more money.

[10:51] And what's crazy to me is that people don't just like consistently apply to jobs that

[10:55] make more money, even just in the job market.

[10:58] Like why wouldn't you?

[10:59] If you're incredibly poor right now, like some will take a shot on you and you know what,

[11:03] you might just learn something that you can take with you for the rest of your life.

[11:07] And you also get this crazy thing called experience which also stays with you.

[11:10] You gain evidence.

[11:11] This is the simplest example I can give you.

[11:12] What I'd explain was arbitrage.

[11:14] The other version is just an arbitrage of time.

[11:16] So let's say that you, instead of saving, let's say you have the option.

[11:20] Let's see if $500 that.

[11:21] This actually a real question.

[11:22] So many message means that I have $1,000 in my bank account.

[11:26] What should I invest in?

[11:27] And they actually said what's stock should I invest in?

[11:29] That was a DM I got.

[11:30] And it was so interesting because I was like man, I can't believe you would ask me this

[11:33] question because it's so absurd.

[11:35] It misses the point.

[11:36] But like this is why I'm making this video.

[11:38] Right?

[11:39] Is that that $1,000 will literally never become anything.

[11:42] Now you might be like man, if I put $1,000 in Bitcoin in 2013, let me, let me pull you

[11:46] off the ledge for a second.

[11:48] So if you had done that, you would have $120,000.

[11:51] Can't retire on that.

[11:52] I mean, you can live for a couple of years, but you're not going to do much with that.

[11:57] The point is that they're trying to hit these meme coins or trying to figure out, you

[12:00] know, like whatever other BS.

[12:03] But the question automatically was wrong because you was optimizing around the wrong vehicle.

[12:10] You thought he was going to pass it in Kimmy's way or even hit it big.

[12:14] But the issue is that you can't retroactively look at one decision and say what if I'd

[12:19] put all my money in Bitcoin in that year?

[12:22] I would be so rich right now.

[12:23] And you wouldn't be for two reasons.

[12:25] Number one is that if I had gone up and doubled, you would have sold it.

[12:28] Number two, if you actually had done that, then you would have made another 100 other stupid

[12:33] decisions.

[12:34] And you have to factor in those decisions too.

[12:37] And so that decision making calculus would be one of incredibly high risk.

[12:40] So it's very likely that you wouldn't have made money at all because it wouldn't have

[12:43] been a thousand dollars.

[12:44] You would have put $10 in a Bitcoin because the other 990 would have put into other 990

[12:49] 990, 990, and other stupid things.

[12:50] And I'm not saying Bitcoin's stupid.

[12:51] That's not my point.

[12:52] The point is that that would have been a higher risk decision at that time.

[12:54] What do you do with your thousand dollars?

[12:57] You buy skills.

[12:58] Now I say that if you're like, well, how do I buy a skill?

[13:00] Well, one is you can get paid to earn a skill when you get a job and you actually ask

[13:05] them, hey, I would like to learn these things.

[13:07] One, will you pay for it too?

[13:08] Will you let me learn it from somebody else who already works here?

[13:10] And guess what?

[13:11] Most employers say yes.

[13:12] You know, why?

[13:13] Because no one does that because everyone's lazy.

[13:16] Everyone's afraid.

[13:17] Everyone, I can't ask them if they'll pay for me to learn something.

[13:20] Why not?

[13:21] Think about this for me.

[13:23] If you make $60,000 a year and you're like, hey, can I learn this other skill?

[13:27] And I would say, okay, once you learn this other skill, let's say you want to go to a

[13:30] conference for two days that speak, teach a specific thing on TikTok, shop, whatever.

[13:35] Right?

[13:36] Well, what are you going to use that when you get back?

[13:38] Why I think that if I take that, I could probably sell the books on TikTok shop.

[13:41] I'd be like, okay, I can see why that would make us more than $5,000.

[13:43] Great deal, go for it.

[13:44] Now, what do I do?

[13:45] I'm happy to show out the five grand because it'll make me more back and you're happy

[13:49] to learn it because it makes you more valuable overall.

[13:51] Why would you not do that?

[13:53] Alternatively, you say, hey, Neil, you're really good at M&A.

[13:56] You know what, acquisition.com, do you mind if we have lunch?

[13:59] You're going to need either way.

[14:00] I would love to you with you.

[14:01] And if you want, I'm happy to tell you about the stuff that I'm good at on the media

[14:03] side.

[14:04] And maybe Neil says no.

[14:05] Now what?

[14:06] You can ask 20 other people.

[14:07] That's free learning.

[14:08] In terms of skills of like, you know what?

[14:10] My job for sucks, everyone is stupid, my bosses, and ask whatever.

[14:14] Then what do you do with your thousand bucks now?

[14:15] So I just give you free skills.

[14:17] Payed skills.

[14:18] I just love this example.

[14:19] I've used it before.

[14:20] It's so good.

[14:21] Friend of my daughter, making minimum wage.

[14:24] Once a save money, he says, hey, why don't you just triple your minimum wage?

[14:27] She says how.

[14:28] He says, why don't you just go get a flabotum certification?

[14:31] It takes a weekend and it's $500 and then you pass the test.

[14:35] And then after that eight weeks or whatever it is, right?

[14:37] You can then make three times your earning power.

[14:41] That's going to save.

[14:42] That's going to pay more dividends than any S&P, any Bitcoin, any mean, anything.

[14:48] Because the thing is, even if you do hit it big, what do you do when you have $100,000

[14:52] after that?

[14:53] Your stuck.

[14:54] The thing is, is that you become the money faucet when you stack your skills.

[14:57] And so you can start the lowest here, which is like, will anyone I know teach me stuff?

[15:01] Above that, you've got YouTube videos where you can teach yourself.

[15:04] And there's lots of experts who are very good at teaching things on the internet that will

[15:08] help.

[15:09] Above that, you're like, okay, why have a job?

[15:10] Maybe I'll learn from somebody who works here.

[15:12] And I know that these skills are valuable because my boss pays them more than they pay

[15:14] me and I'd love to learn it.

[15:16] On top of that, you ask your boss, hey, can I go somewhere where I will find out a skill

[15:21] that will make you more money?

[15:22] And I guess what?

[15:23] I know that skills valuable because he'll pay more for it.

[15:25] If none of those other things, and if you're like, wow, those are four very legitimate

[15:28] paths to learning.

[15:29] Up, on top of that, then finally, you say, you know what?

[15:32] No one I know in my business, outside of my life, and I can't find it on the internet, or

[15:36] I would need more personalized attention.

[15:38] Then you take that and you get a tutor.

[15:40] That's it.

[15:41] You go to certification, you get a tutor, you get a teacher.

[15:43] You learn.

[15:44] Like, that's how I learned Facebook ads.

[15:45] I just paid someone earlier, I said teach me.

[15:46] And then I made way more back.

[15:48] And the thing is, is that real world skills, like running ads, building landing pages, learning

[15:54] how to write copy, learning how to sell.

[15:56] These are all skills that are super valuable in the marketplace and available for free online.

[16:02] So, I feel like I'm making minimum wage.

[16:04] I'm making $40,000 a year.

[16:05] I don't know how to escape.

[16:06] It's like, do pick one and stick with it.

[16:09] That's it.

[16:10] And then ask people if they need it.

[16:11] And so if you did spend that money to draw blood, right?

[16:15] You weren't way more from a tiny investment.

[16:18] That's why you don't save.

[16:19] It's been more in the earning.

[16:20] And I'll tell you a little secret.

[16:21] I spent 100% of my money every single month until I could not spend the money because I

[16:27] was making too much of it on learning more stuff.

[16:30] Real.

[16:31] So, we're talking 20, 30, 40, 50.

[16:33] I just kept playing it in because I kept getting a better return on that than anything I could

[16:36] put it into.

[16:37] I'll give you this little rule of thumb.

[16:39] The day you stop investing in education for yourself in skills is the day that you decide

[16:44] you're good enough and you don't want to grow anymore.

[16:45] So if you're not investing in anything now, then you've already decided that you don't

[16:49] want to get better than you are.

[16:51] So my favorite way of saying this is that instead of investing in the S&P 500, invest in

[16:56] the S&P 500 because that $1,000 tripals you're income versus turning from $1,000 to

[17:01] $1,100 a year later.

[17:03] What to do?

[17:04] Now, once you start earning these skills, what else do our rich parents say?

[17:08] Reputation over everything.

[17:09] Trust is earned in drops but lost in buckets.

[17:12] Never trade reputation for money.

[17:14] You can only get one of them back.

[17:16] Poor parents focus on this month's bills.

[17:19] Rich parents focus on this decade's wealth building skills.

[17:24] Every deal I've done with someone who says the value relationships and morals above everything

[17:28] else has done at the opposite.

[17:30] So I prefer dealing with people that just say they want to make money and ironically it

[17:34] tends to keep everyone honest.

[17:36] And so your reputation is your most valuable asset and I'm willing to leave money on

[17:40] the table on this deal so there are future deals.

[17:43] And so the moment you prioritize short-term cash over long-term investments you've already

[17:47] lost.

[17:48] So what you're missing is the value of a story.

[17:52] So many things about it.

[17:53] I was studying Rockefeller and he was telling a story to his son about how he made his

[18:00] first really big acquisition.

[18:02] So Rockefeller was the second biggest oil producer in a city in a hockeymer.

[18:06] I think it was Cincinnati.

[18:07] It doesn't matter.

[18:08] He was number two.

[18:09] The number one guy was significantly bigger than him.

[18:10] And so he approached the number one guy and said, hey I want to buy you out.

[18:14] The guy scoffed at him, laughed him off.

[18:16] And then he came back and he said no I'm serious.

[18:18] And he was like all right fine, let's talk.

[18:20] And so the guy said I'm not going to sell unless you're going to give me an absurd amount

[18:23] of money.

[18:24] And so then Rockefeller lined up the financing and gave the guy and I'm certain about

[18:27] him money.

[18:28] In other words, he overpaid for the guy's business.

[18:30] And so after the deal was done, the other guy who was, you know, once the bigger guy was

[18:35] like man, you overpaid for that thing.

[18:36] Like it wasn't even worth close to that.

[18:38] And the crazy part is is that when Rockefeller tells the story he said, he was right,

[18:43] I overpaid for it.

[18:45] So what he failed to consider was that in the next 60 days, Rockefeller could say he was

[18:50] the number one biggest oil producer in Ohio.

[18:54] And as soon as that happened, he did 22 emanadeals in the next 60 days rolling up everyone

[19:00] around him because he became the biggest player.

[19:02] And so that story, the delta between the value of that company was actually worth versus

[19:06] what he was willing to pay.

[19:08] That value was what John Rockefeller valued the story at.

[19:11] He might have even valued it higher than that.

[19:13] And his return on that delta created the next 22 deals he was able to do.

[19:19] And I think we can all agree that it seemed to work out pretty well for him.

[19:22] And so people underestimate the value arbitrage that exists in a story.

[19:27] And stories also go both ways.

[19:29] And so if there's a story that's equal opposite of that, where you're like, hey, if I do

[19:32] this, I'll give you an example.

[19:34] I personally have zero issues ethically with, you know, girls who do only fans or whatever

[19:39] else.

[19:40] And I'll take the second to say like, I believe that people have their own

[19:43] choice and as long as they're not hurting other people, they should be permitted to do it.

[19:47] Is it, is it the career path that I would necessarily choose?

[19:50] No, I wouldn't.

[19:51] I would try that would try to find something else, right?

[19:53] But do I have any issues with that?

[19:54] No, I don't.

[19:55] Now, of course, some people who listen to my stuff will be like, oh, that's terrible.

[19:58] And then amazing.

[19:59] I love that you have your own values.

[20:01] That's great.

[20:02] You don't need to attack mine.

[20:03] Point is, I've had multiple deals that have come to me that I've been not even necessarily

[20:07] in that space adjacent to it, right?

[20:09] And honestly, met the people, amazing people, sometimes great business people.

[20:14] And I was just like, I can't do the deal.

[20:16] I'm really sorry.

[20:17] And they're like, but I thought that you are very like, hey, you know, you're just like

[20:22] very, you know, everything is what it is, we all die, whatever.

[20:25] And I was like, I am.

[20:26] I was like, the thing is, is that me even having to give the disclaimer's I did is because

[20:29] not everyone that I do business with is.

[20:32] And so that reputation would follow me.

[20:35] And so it's just, I'm not willing to make the trade.

[20:38] The reputation goes both ways.

[20:39] And the thing is, is most reputational stuff is very irreversible.

[20:42] It's a one-way door.

[20:43] And so I would rather maximize as many one-way doors that are permanent and good than permanent

[20:47] in bed.

[20:48] So, that leads to Rockefeller bought this story.

[20:53] He bought this element of reputations he ever leverage.

[20:55] What else do rich people buy?

[20:57] They buy time.

[20:58] And time is a very amorphous thing, right?

[21:00] Because it really means like, I buy exescapacity so that I can re-allocate that capacity

[21:04] to something that is going to get me a higher return than this inanimate object.

[21:08] And so I'll tell you a little a micro story of this.

[21:11] How do you make this tactical?

[21:12] So when I was single and in my early 20s, I hit a japonly over 500 times in one year.

[21:17] I didn't know that.

[21:18] I found out from my account and it was like, why do I have 500 trades in that

[21:20] I can set japonly?

[21:21] I was like, well, you really got to cut down on the spills.

[21:23] I was like, why?

[21:24] He's like, you're spending so much money there.

[21:25] I was like, why don't buy groceries?

[21:26] I was like, I don't prep food.

[21:27] I don't do any of that.

[21:28] And that amount of time that saves me.

[21:30] I was like, I can do sales all day.

[21:33] And one sale is 500 bucks.

[21:35] And that takes 30 minutes.

[21:36] And so I'm happy to just do that.

[21:39] Everybody trades time for money.

[21:42] Everyone does.

[21:43] Whether they like it or not.

[21:44] Because I'll prove it because we live in time.

[21:47] And we get money over that same period of time.

[21:50] So all money you earn is related to some time that you spend getting it,

[21:54] deciding it, doing a deal, whatever.

[21:56] There was some time.

[21:57] Now, it might not have been denoted in a time of you get this per hour.

[22:01] But you could say it took 100 hours to make the deal.

[22:04] And then it made the deal and it made $10 million.

[22:05] It's like, OK, well, you took $10 million to buy $100 and that's how much you made.

[22:08] $100,000 an hour.

[22:09] Great.

[22:09] And so if there's something else that's worth more than $100,000 an hour, you should do that instead.

[22:14] And so getting out of this mythology and just looking at it and getting out is black

[22:18] and white thinking, and just thinking, OK, what are the facts?

[22:21] What are the observables?

[22:22] And so let me give you the single best trade that you only get to make once in your life.

[22:27] It costs $1500 a month.

[22:28] I'm going to break it down for you.

[22:30] Like, if you replay any part of this video, this will be it.

[22:33] The best ROI you'll ever get for $1500 a month is that you use that $1500 to eliminate

[22:39] all time consuming human tasks and gain back all the productive hours.

[22:44] So let me tell you what it adds up to.

[22:46] So let's say that food costs you 50 hours per month, which is a lot.

[22:52] Food costs a lot of time to get that food completely taken care of for you is about 800 bucks.

[22:57] OK, what else we got?

[22:59] We've got cleaning the house.

[23:01] We've got cleaning clothes.

[23:03] Now, both of these, you've got cleaning the houses.

[23:06] Some are probably around 25-ish hours per month.

[23:09] You've got cleaning folding clothes, which is about 16.

[23:11] And if you're like, where are these numbers coming from?

[23:12] This is from Z research on Z internet.

[23:15] You can look it up on your own.

[23:16] It doesn't really matter though.

[23:17] You're going to get the point in a second.

[23:18] So that you can replace about $500 a month.

[23:21] You're going to place this for probably about $200 a month.

[23:24] And so what is all this add up to?

[23:26] Well, if you add all the stuff together, you're going to save 96 hours per month.

[23:33] For a cost of $1,500.

[23:36] So rough math here, if you know how to make more than $15 per hour, this trade makes sense.

[23:44] Now, I'm going to do you one better.

[23:45] Even if you don't make $15 an hour, if you take the 96 hours every month to try and learn how to make more than $15 an hour,

[23:53] you can learn that in the month.

[23:54] And here's the good news in the bad news.

[23:57] The good news is that this 100% works.

[23:59] The crazy part is that I talk to entrepreneurs who are making a million dollars a year and they don't even do this sometimes.

[24:03] Because they feel guilty about it.

[24:05] But they just, again, they believe they bind to the mythology.

[24:08] Right?

[24:08] And if you can't explain your beliefs, then they're not your beliefs.

[24:10] They're someone else's.

[24:11] Right?

[24:12] And so you just heard this thing.

[24:13] And someone got poo pooed in front of you when you were a kid for feeling fancy by having a maid.

[24:18] And you're saying, oh, I'm never going to have a maid when I grow up.

[24:21] But it's dumb.

[24:22] It's a bad trade.

[24:22] It's like you think about your business in one way.

[24:25] You're costs and expenses in your income.

[24:26] And then when you think about your personal life, you're like, oh, I'll mow my own loan.

[24:29] It's like, why?

[24:30] Why?

[24:31] And so you can only, and that's all due to their student's.

[24:34] Who do you think?

[24:35] The bad news is that you can only make this trade once.

[24:37] Because you can't, like if I could keep spending $1500 and getting $96 back, my god, that would be amazing.

[24:43] Right?

[24:44] But it doesn't work that way.

[24:45] You can only do that trade once.

[24:46] Right?

[24:47] That's because there's plenty of businesses that are set up.

[24:48] There's plenty of other people who have fewer skills where we're willing to do it for us.

[24:49] So if something doesn't buy you time, strongly considered not buying it.

[24:53] Stop buying so much stuff.

[24:55] Because at the end of the day, do you want to look rich or do you want to be rich?

[24:58] Here's a little plus one, a 201 advanced wealth for you.

[25:02] Rich people aren't impressed by stuff by your landlord, your Rolex, right?

[25:06] They're impressed by how rich you'll be in 20 years.

[25:08] Like if I see a younger guy who's flashing a watch, I just think, how silly.

[25:13] Like you could have taken that and then like you could have taken that in 20 years from

[25:16] now that would have been something significant to be bigger, maybe a building or a business.

[25:20] I remember the very first event that I ran for Jim Watch.

[25:24] And this is when I was a cash millator at this point.

[25:27] I pulled up and it was in Laelis car.

[25:29] So it was a Prius that we shared a car.

[25:31] A Prius with a cracked windshield and a dent in the side door.

[25:35] I pull up and all these Jim owners are there because I'm I'm supposed to have to make

[25:40] more money, right?

[25:41] And I remember and you think they like, oh no, they're going to think or they're going

[25:44] to say something.

[25:45] Oh no, they said something.

[25:46] So I remember this this particular Jim owner was walking and there's a group of them.

[25:49] And they see me, some of them keep going, what of them stops and then just be lines over

[25:53] to where I am, taking my stuff out of my car.

[25:56] And she says, I thought you were supposed to be rich.

[25:59] That's what she said.

[26:00] I thought you were supposed to be rich.

[26:01] I remember it, you know, Kudos to younger me at the time.

[26:05] I said, I said, don't judge my car.

[26:07] I said judge my bank account.

[26:10] And that worked.

[26:11] Just, she was like, oh, okay, good way to think about it.

[26:13] Then we walked in and was all good.

[26:15] But I remember that story because people do judge a book by it's cover, but she was not

[26:18] very rich.

[26:19] And so she was judging me in that way.

[26:21] And so don't get poor people rich, right?

[26:24] Because poor people rich will keep you poor.

[26:26] So look at the ducks and the base, it says, right?

[26:28] They dressed like regular people.

[26:29] Now to be fair, they try to brag in other ways with their $300 million, but, you know, relative

[26:34] to $200 billion, it's literally less than, I mean, it's less than 1% of their income.

[26:39] I'm just absurd, right?

[26:40] I remember for me, I spent 16 months trying to figure out my Darwin outfit, right?

[26:44] Five pieces that work for the Jim, restaurant, work, or the pool, right?

[26:48] And sometimes I have to negotiate my winter restaurants that Laila wants to eat at because

[26:52] of the dress code.

[26:53] And for me, I can travel for weeks with a small backpack, get my entire wardrobe,

[26:57] and my bedside table.

[26:58] And so for me, that's more valuable.

[27:00] Now, I want to be clear, there are some people who like, you know, nice suits and stuff.

[27:03] And there's nothing wrong with that.

[27:04] And maybe in some season of my life, I'll do that.

[27:06] But I think the key is that you do it for you and not for anyone else.

[27:08] You want to buy time, not stuff, so it continues to compound.

[27:11] So what's going to help you compound, Vester?

[27:12] Eight.

[27:13] So what makes you compound all this even faster?

[27:16] Avoid bad environments.

[27:20] Now, what's a bad environment?

[27:21] I would say a bad environment is any environment that decreases the likelihood of

[27:24] chief reboles.

[27:25] So this research has been cited all over the place, which is one of the longest-longest

[27:28] digital studies on success is that there's a high correlation between your success and

[27:33] your reference group, aka the five people that you compare yourself to.

[27:37] And so when you get, when you cut bad friends, it's not that you're being anti-social,

[27:41] is that you're raising your standards.

[27:43] If you want to change your actions, the easiest thing to do is change your environment.

[27:47] Average parents teach kids to get along with everyone.

[27:50] Walthy parents teach kids to ruthlessly create their circle.

[27:53] I'll be real.

[27:54] There are some parents, and this doesn't mean poop-oing parents, but that basically

[27:58] live their kids take out if anyone.

[27:59] I can tell you, that was not, that did not fly in my household.

[28:04] Anybody who is going to hang out with me when I was a kid, I'm not saying, obviously now,

[28:08] but I didn't know that my parents were helping me in that way when I was younger,

[28:11] is that they made sure that the people that I was friends with were cool.

[28:14] I mean, like, going somewhere, like not scrubs, right?

[28:17] If you're ambitious and young, and you have friends who are less ambitious than you,

[28:21] don't be friends with them.

[28:22] And then find people who are more ambitious than you,

[28:25] and don't let them be more ambitious than you.

[28:27] Because if your friends don't have goals, your goal should be to get new friends.

[28:32] My fastest, one strike policy is if I feel like you're anything but stoked when I win,

[28:37] I don't need you.

[28:38] Like, I already have enough people who are getting against me.

[28:40] It shouldn't, it's very least my friendship would for me.

[28:43] And so friends root for you to win and make you better.

[28:45] Enemies tell you to put your goals on hold and secretly hope for you to lose.

[28:49] Think about how wild this is.

[28:51] Let's say that the people who in your life, like, do they increase or decrease the likely due

[28:55] achiever goals.

[28:56] Now, don't think about intention, don't think about the reasoning, just ask yourself,

[29:02] this is a little bit of a deftivism, and this is how I see the world which also makes it.

[29:05] It's far more powerful for predicting what's going to happen.

[29:08] Does this person increase or decrease the likely to him, my goal?

[29:11] If these answers decrease, when you have two or three or four of those, you've got three or four

[29:15] people that are decreasing likely due to go, that adds up.

[29:17] Now, on the flip side, if you had multiple people that increase likely due to your goals,

[29:21] what do you think happens?

[29:23] You rise up.

[29:23] And so if someone calls themselves a friend but acts like an enemy, treat them like one.

[29:27] The most dangerous enemies are the ones who call themselves your friends.

[29:30] And if you define enemies as people who decrease likely due to your goals,

[29:33] a lot of the people you think are your friends, your enemies, and on the other side,

[29:37] there may be people who actually are your enemies who might be your friends.

[29:40] If you're competitive with someone, in all they do is drive you to do better because they're

[29:45] your friend of me, they serve real value.

[29:48] Maybe you are better friends with them.

[29:49] Kind of interesting.

[29:51] So when someone tells me they have a lot of friends, all I think is they just have low standards.

[29:57] So the question is, why does having a reference group full of ambitious and successful people help you?

[30:01] Right?

[30:02] I'll give you Alex's theory.

[30:03] So motivation is the equal opposite of deprivation.

[30:06] So let's say this is the goal and this is you.

[30:09] Okay.

[30:10] The greater the gap is between these things, the greater the motivation.

[30:14] So if I just ate lunch, I am not that motivated to eat because I'm not deprived of food.

[30:20] If I don't eat for three days, I'll be incredibly motivated to eat because I am deprived of food.

[30:25] If you haven't slept in two days, you're very deprived of sleep and therefore very motivated to sleep.

[30:31] Right?

[30:31] Now how does that work with successful behaviors?

[30:35] Well, if you let's say money because it's a simple one, right?

[30:38] Let's say you want to make more money.

[30:39] If you are the wealthiest person of the people you compare yourself to, your motivation to make more money will be significantly lower.

[30:47] Now to be clear, I'm not saying that's a bad thing.

[30:49] I'm just saying it will be, if the people you compare yourself to, even if you're around poor people, make a lot more money than you.

[30:54] Then your deprivation will be significantly higher.

[30:56] And you would think though, wait, shouldn't the logic be that all poor people should be more motivated to make money?

[31:02] No, it's about who they compare themselves to.

[31:04] And if you are the richest of your poor friends, you might feel like a baller.

[31:08] And again, nothing wrong with that.

[31:10] But I only talk about increasing likeliots.

[31:12] So I'll give you a real-world example of this.

[31:14] So who do you think makes more money?

[31:17] And I'll tie it in.

[31:17] Merid guys or single guys.

[31:20] So ironically, people are like, I don't want that expense.

[31:23] I don't have a wife, a kid's, well, married guys make more money on average.

[31:27] Kind of interesting.

[31:28] And married men with kids make more than just married guys.

[31:31] The thing is, why would that be a thing?

[31:33] They make more money because they need more money.

[31:35] They have more deprivation for money when they have four kids than they have no kids.

[31:39] And when you have a wife and four kids, you got to make more money.

[31:41] That drive is what drives them to make more.

[31:43] Now again, if they then also, that's an element.

[31:46] If they also compare themselves to people who made significantly more, they might make even more than that.

[31:51] And so it's not like, oh wait, are these contradictory things like, no, they're additive.

[31:54] Right?

[31:55] And so the problem is that most poor people know a lot of other poor people.

[31:59] And so they're not that poor relative to the people they know.

[32:02] So the deprivation to the reference group is basically no, it's zero.

[32:07] And so they're, and so too is their motivation.

[32:09] And so most people are so busy looking for outside investments.

[32:12] They completely miss the most obvious opportunity

[32:14] staring them in the face, which is understanding what actually makes the money.

[32:19] So number nine.

[32:19] So middle class families teach their kids that their home and car are assets.

[32:25] Rich families will teach their kids that assets are only things that put money back into your

[32:29] pocket. Now, the only money rules that mattered to me are number one.

[32:32] I think this A.

[32:33] Spend less than you earn.

[32:34] I say this is duh and yet so people will do it.

[32:37] B, buy stuff that goes like this in value.

[32:41] If you spend less than you earn, you'll have some leftover.

[32:43] With the leftover, you buy stuff that will be worth more tomorrow.

[32:46] But that stuff that'll be worth more tomorrow might be a skill.

[32:50] And the thing is because the skill, like if you thought of a skill as an extra $1,000 a month,

[32:54] then wouldn't like what investments can you pay $500 for one time

[32:59] that make you an extra $1,000 a month for the rest of your life?

[33:02] That would be an insane investment.

[33:04] And that's what skills are.

[33:06] And here's the Stephen Crazier.

[33:07] They're not taxable.

[33:08] You also can't lose them in a divorce.

[33:10] No government can take it from you.

[33:12] And it might be because my family fled from your ronder in the revolution.

[33:15] And so we lost everything.

[33:16] The only thing we had was education.

[33:18] But that's why I'm so hard on this stuff.

[33:20] And then eventually when this stuff makes you more,

[33:23] then you need to live, you're good.

[33:26] Happy face.

[33:27] Everything else is just bonus.

[33:28] And so it sounds obvious.

[33:29] But like the thing is, is that simple things can be simple to understand

[33:33] but difficult to execute.

[33:35] Because that's where the heart is with this stuff.

[33:36] It's not in the understanding.

[33:38] It's in the doing.

[33:38] Actually, wrote this.

[33:39] People fill an up because there's some magical list nobody has.

[33:43] They feel because it's an obvious list nobody does.

[33:45] Number 10 is rich parents have a higher minimum standard.

[33:49] So what does that mean?

[33:50] So there's a couple of ways to think about this.

[33:52] So number one is that rich parents will talk in different orders of magnitude

[33:56] and different increments.

[33:57] And there's the classic example of like Warren Buffett.

[34:00] What asked you to do a mic check was like 1 million, 2 million, 3 million.

[34:05] And it's just like, and I know it's just joke at the time but I just,

[34:08] I thought about that because like when I was a younger kid,

[34:11] I used to count my money in how many Chipotle burritos I could buy.

[34:14] And then as I got older, it turned into a larger increment which for me was

[34:18] actually the number of customers I had to sell in order to make something.

[34:21] And then over time, basically it's just number of units of something that I've had to sell

[34:26] in order to get whatever I want.

[34:28] It's just the unit of thing.

[34:29] It's just a state stagnant and the cost of those things have gone up.

[34:32] Rich parents simply won't allow their kids to go below or accept opportunities that are

[34:38] minimum below the minimum.

[34:39] So I'll give you a different example.

[34:40] So there's a guy that I know who grew up rich.

[34:43] All right, super rich, New York rich.

[34:45] He has somehow been able to make call it 400, 500,000 dollars a year.

[34:52] For the vast majority of his adult life, with basically no skills.

[34:58] Like he does nothing.

[34:59] Like I'm very confident like he actually does nothing.

[35:01] And what's interesting though is that like he's had to go from thing to thing

[35:06] because eventually people will figure that out.

[35:08] But he will stand there in a negotiation and they're like, hey, you know, we'll pay you

[35:13] 385,000.

[35:15] He's like, I'm not working here for less than 450.

[35:17] And the crazy thing is is because he just gently like delusional it.

[35:21] Just like he would rather be broke than be someone who makes less than that.

[35:25] And so like I think that is kind of the declarative knowledge.

[35:28] Those standards that are passed down.

[35:31] Like that is probably some of the biggest gift.

[35:33] It's like of course you're not going to do that.

[35:34] It's not worth your time.

[35:36] And so they simply wait for better opportunities.

[35:40] That's really it.

[35:42] Like they just won't say yes to something that's not as good and they'll just wait.

[35:45] And so like think about it.

[35:46] Think about it in a guys and girls scenario.

[35:48] Like there are tons of poor guys who have like hot girls.

[35:52] And there's tons of ugly dudes who have hot girls who aren't rich.

[35:54] All right, there are.

[35:55] They exist.

[35:55] Believe they exist.

[35:56] What separates them from the other guy who's equally bad looking, who does it,

[36:02] have the hot girl.

[36:03] The other guy just went on more dates or waited longer.

[36:05] Just kiss more toes.

[36:06] What do everyone say?

[36:07] Right?

[36:08] Eventually there's going to be some crazy, uh, hot enough girl that's just like,

[36:11] you know what, he's my kind ugly.

[36:14] And it works.

[36:15] And that's the thing that I think a lot of poor parents don't transfer their kids.

[36:20] It's like there's a significantly higher amount of volume.

[36:22] And because they know it's possible and rich kids aren't smarter than poor kids.

[36:27] You might be more educated, but not smarter.

[36:29] And so if them, why not you?

[36:31] And so another big difference between these.

[36:33] So this is number 11.

[36:34] I forgot to write down number 10.

[36:35] But let's say number 10, men, standards.

[36:38] Actually, I'm going to add one more thing to that.

[36:39] So one more on on men, no standards is that the measuring stick they use to measure is bigger.

[36:47] Right?

[36:47] They're measuring increments like listen to the examples that people are talking about.

[36:53] That they claim are a lot around you.

[36:55] So if the people, if you meet somebody and they're like,

[36:57] it was like $1,000, right?

[36:59] Like that thousand dollars might, that's like them demonstrating that this is an

[37:03] increment that is meaningful to me.

[37:05] You want to hang around somebody who's like you always want to hang out with the person

[37:07] who has the largest increment that they measure things with.

[37:10] The largest measuring stick.

[37:12] And I'll give you a finance example from hedge funds in New York.

[37:15] They have a slaying term for a million dollars, which is a stick.

[37:19] And so it's like two sticks, four sticks,

[37:21] because it's such a common increment of money.

[37:24] Hard to fathom when you didn't grow up around that.

[37:26] So number 11, there's four types of money, or rather four sources that you can pull,

[37:32] they can use for leverage.

[37:33] All right?

[37:35] And this is super important.

[37:36] You get poor a lot of times based on the type of money you use.

[37:40] So on the kind of like, a little a over here is you can use debt, right?

[37:46] You can use consumer debt, you can use credit card, loan chart, whatever.

[37:49] To buy stuff.

[37:50] You don't want to do that because not only does it cost you today, cost you more to more.

[37:53] The next is that you can use your savings.

[37:56] So there's your little nest egg, right?

[37:57] That's another place that you can find as whatever purchases you want out of.

[38:00] The third little bucket that we have is you can learn it out of your cash flow.

[38:03] So you make a check, you get paid on Friday, you take some of that check before goes into savings,

[38:08] and you spend it.

[38:09] Okay?

[38:09] Simple enough.

[38:10] And then the last is what I like to call new opportunities.

[38:14] And the easiest way to explain this is I had a construction kitchen remodler who came out here.

[38:19] They were probably doing like five-ish million years, something like that.

[38:22] And she wanted us to look at the business and have my team kind of like do a full analysis and be like,

[38:28] right, this we need to change the margins, we need to change sales, whatever.

[38:30] Right?

[38:31] And so it's not cheap.

[38:32] And she took on a project for an extra 150 grand that was like a personal design project that she

[38:40] doesn't normally take on so that she could buy it and pay for it.

[38:44] And I remember thinking to myself like she's going to make it, like she'll be fine,

[38:49] because she already thinks about money the right way.

[38:51] And this is a comment-treat I've seen among wealthy people.

[38:55] And if you're not wealthy yet and you can adopt this mentality,

[39:00] then it increases the likelihood that you will make more later.

[39:03] Which, by the way, I just mentioned that lady who came out, if you are a business owner

[39:08] and you're making, you've got a legitimate business, you've got employees, revenue, profits, etc.

[39:14] And you'd like to see how we grow companies.

[39:18] Every month at Acquisitor.com in person at my headquarters, we hold basically two-day workshops

[39:24] where my team, my actual, you know, director-marketing, director sales, director media,

[39:29] all of my team basically works with businesses to just help them grow.

[39:34] And it's a cool way for us to mean your companies, that kind of builds our pipeline on the investment side,

[39:38] but it also just provides value to you guys.

[39:41] And so it's kind of a cool win when the reviews are exceptional.

[39:44] So the link is ACQ, ACQiletteers.com, Ford Slash, Vegas.

[39:49] You can go there and you grab a time with my team, they'll just ask you a couple questions

[39:52] make sure the business makes sense that we can off the app.

[39:54] And if so, then one by chat here to Vegas and have a, have a party, not really.

[39:58] It'll just be almost all entirely business.

[40:00] And I would encourage you not to party, at least still afterwards.

[40:03] But beyond that, let's get back to it.

[40:05] So in reverse here, if you pay out of this, you're taking from the president.

[40:09] Here you're taking from your past self.

[40:11] Here you're taking from your future self.

[40:12] Here is the only place where you can take all of your existing flows.

[40:16] They can continue to get allocated to your investment goals, your saving schools, whatever it is.

[40:20] But then this money allows you to take advantage of a new opportunity.

[40:24] So you're like, okay, I want to do this thing.

[40:27] It wasn't in my plan.

[40:28] And so therefore, I'm going to do something that also wasn't in my plan to get it.

[40:31] That's the magic.

[40:32] And I love this because this is how sound unbiased here.

[40:36] That's how I think about money.

[40:37] There's a great story of a palm al-cartney who was like, he, he was with, was a yoko,

[40:43] oh no, or whatever.

[40:44] And he wanted a swimming pool and she was like, no, where she,

[40:48] whatever reason he couldn't get it.

[40:50] And so he said, fine, he said, I'll just go write a song.

[40:54] And so she said, you're going to write yourself a swimming pool.

[40:56] And he said, yeah.

[40:57] And so write yourself your own swimming pool.

[41:00] Is he needed to go write a song?

[41:01] He knew if he wrote the song, he'd make the money for the swimming pool, he could have it.

[41:04] So of course, he could afford it.

[41:06] He was a beetle.

[41:06] He was crushing it.

[41:07] But it's the concept.

[41:08] And the thing is, that's the thing is, it's like, even when you have the money,

[41:12] it's like, why've already allocated all this money?

[41:14] And this is something that did it didn't expect.

[41:16] So it's totally okay to also do work you didn't expect to get it.

[41:20] All right, number 12.

[41:21] And this one, you're not going to, you're, this one will probably surprise it with you.

[41:25] So this is, this is SaaS.

[41:27] Spending is a skill.

[41:28] The only people we say you can't buy happiness haven't given enough away.

[41:31] And the reason is, is that spending money using money is a skill.

[41:36] And so it makes sense that as you increase your income, and I think the numbers have been updated,

[41:41] you should be $70,000.

[41:42] Now it's closer to like, you know, $400 or $500 is the cap on happiness.

[41:48] But that's usually because at $400,000, that is what most people can fathom with their

[41:54] existing understanding of the world for ways to use money.

[41:58] And I think it's an spending money using money.

[42:01] And so you want to use money because it's a tool like a pro.

[42:05] And people don't even think about it like that.

[42:06] Of course, you can, like, of course there's investments.

[42:09] But how can you spend effectively, right?

[42:11] This is where you're constantly buying time not stuff.

[42:19] And the thing is, there are levels to buy.

[42:21] This is called my 101.

[42:23] This is my, this is my, you get up to, you know, a couple hundred thousand dollars a year.

[42:28] This, this level is spending.

[42:30] But most people stop there.

[42:31] You can keep going on this game, right?

[42:34] You can get a house manager, you can have executive assistants, you can have multiple

[42:37] excessive assistants, you can have drivers, you can have security that also help

[42:42] and do things for you.

[42:43] You can retire your parents.

[42:45] You can control your calendar even more aggressively.

[42:47] Like, that you can fly private.

[42:50] There are plenty of other things that you can spend money on to

[42:54] a milliorate little vocabord for you, improve your life.

[42:57] And so I remember I'll say this story.

[43:00] So, Layla and I when we were, you know, coming up, I think at this point,

[43:04] we were probably making a doesn't matter.

[43:06] We're making a lot of what I'm just leaving there.

[43:08] And we met with a friend of ours who's significantly older.

[43:11] And, you know, she's like, why do you always look like crap?

[43:14] And she was being a little bit mean, but she was saying that to Layla because she was like,

[43:18] you're always just dressing Jim Clips right now both of us came for fitness to like,

[43:21] that's all we own was fitness Clips right?

[43:23] And she said, why don't you find nice stuff?

[43:24] And Layla was like, I just, you know, I just feel weird,

[43:27] she's not having that much money on Clips.

[43:28] She's like, you have so much money.

[43:30] What are you talking about?

[43:31] And so she said, I'm going to take you shopping.

[43:33] She said, she said, she said, you suck at being rich.

[43:36] That was actually what she said.

[43:37] And so she took Layla shopping and so I remember Layla told me the story.

[43:41] She walked into the store and she's like, okay, she's like meet me at the,

[43:45] at like, neemin Marcus or Chanel or something, whatever.

[43:48] And so she gets into Chanel and then she was like, come to the back and they're like,

[43:52] she was like, okay, so she goes to the back and they had an entire room all along.

[43:56] The whole sides of all the room, they had already pre-picked all the clothes to be only

[44:01] Layla's size and they had like, shit, pain.

[44:03] And she was sitting there.

[44:04] Her friend was like, all right, you're not leaving here without spending at least $30,000.

[44:09] And so Layla spent in like Layla's like stomach dropped.

[44:12] She's like, oh my God.

[44:13] And so she spent 30, like $6,000 on clothing.

[44:16] Of course, my stomach dropped because I was like, what happened?

[44:18] But, but anyways, she spent the money and the point was,

[44:23] is that this friend of ours had been rich for a very long time.

[44:27] And she was like, you said you wanted these things.

[44:29] So she's like, so get them, you know?

[44:31] She's like, and again, you might be like, wait a second, I thought this is,

[44:34] this is an aesthetic one of that.

[44:35] Layla likes that stuff.

[44:37] She would, where's it?

[44:40] She likes the stuff.

[44:41] I obviously don't.

[44:42] And I think that that's like, if you take anything from this,

[44:45] it's doing you, right?

[44:47] I think you acquire this money to do what.

[44:50] You're going to die with it and then leave it to somebody else who's going to blow it.

[44:52] So who cares, right?

[44:53] I talk about this from the perspective of how do I optimize to get this album?

[44:56] Once you get the album, you can do it every one.

[44:58] But if you only optimize your own money, you optimize around accumulation of a tool.

[45:04] So you might as well also have the skill to use it.

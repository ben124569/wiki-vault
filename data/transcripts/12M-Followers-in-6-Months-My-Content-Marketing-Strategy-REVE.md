[00:00] Six years ago, I told clients of Jim Lodge

[00:03] that they should stop making content

[00:05] because they were wasting their time.

[00:07] I was partially right and partially wrong.

[00:09] And in this video, I want you break down

[00:12] the shift that I've had in terms of content marketing

[00:14] and its role within a business.

[00:15] The five phases in building a content marketing machine

[00:18] and how to focus on one of two primary objectives

[00:22] with content marketing.

[00:23] And so if you don't know my name is Alchromozi

[00:24] I don't know acquisition.com

[00:25] or full of companies right now

[00:26] it's over $150 million a year.

[00:28] Make these videos because I hope that you used this stuff.

[00:30] You make a bunch of money

[00:30] and then you come and join acquisition.com

[00:32] so we can invest your business.

[00:33] That's why I do it.

[00:34] Let's rock and roll with the phases of content.

[00:35] I'm gonna walk through the five phases

[00:36] and then I'm gonna talk about which of the objectives

[00:38] you're solving for each of these

[00:39] and then finally like an outscale version.

[00:41] All right, phase one is you make something

[00:44] and you post it.

[00:46] That's it.

[00:47] You just gotta post something sometime somewhere.

[00:49] And believe it or not,

[00:49] a lot of you guys haven't even done phase one

[00:51] which is why I have to outwider.

[00:53] Number two is that you post something consistently.

[00:56] You create a cadence or a calendar around when you post.

[00:59] You find a platform that you like,

[01:00] ideally one that you're probably already using

[01:02] and you just post again after you post it once.

[01:05] And you say, you know what?

[01:06] This was seven days apart.

[01:07] If I do this every seven days,

[01:09] I will now be consistent.

[01:10] For me, I just know that there's one day a week

[01:12] that I do all my marketing stuff,

[01:13] what I do on that day changes

[01:15] but it's always marketing related.

[01:16] That's what's worked for me, maybe it'll work for you.

[01:19] The third phase, you post, you post reliably

[01:21] and you do it on all platforms.

[01:23] That's a massive increase in the amount of volume

[01:25] that you are posting.

[01:26] This is when it transitions in terms of objectives

[01:29] and I'll get to the objectives in a second.

[01:30] Phase four is that you go from posting

[01:32] just even once on every platform on a regular cadence

[01:35] to maximizing how much every platform can take.

[01:37] The short from platforms can take sometimes

[01:39] five, 10 posts a day like Twitter or TikTok,

[01:42] Facebook Reels at this moment rules change all the time.

[01:45] If you have a news feed style or you have an audience

[01:47] that is pushing stuff to, they tend to fatigue faster

[01:49] and they don't want to get overwhelmed with one person.

[01:51] That's usually where you get capped out at one or two times a day.

[01:54] And so what you have to do is look at all the platforms,

[01:56] figure out what the maximum amount is that you can

[01:58] polish on a platform and then all you do is you crank

[02:00] the volume on all of them at the same time.

[02:02] That's phase four.

[02:03] Most people never even get to phase four.

[02:05] And then phase five, you go from creating for all of those

[02:08] to capturing and creating.

[02:09] For example, if I wanted to have a show where everybody called in

[02:12] and I could repurpose all that stuff across content,

[02:14] that would be me deliberately creating content

[02:16] in a way across all those channels.

[02:18] But not only creating but also capturing

[02:20] so that I could further enhance my reach

[02:22] in the amount of volume that I created.

[02:24] And the big rule with volume that I have is that there's no

[02:26] such thing as too long, only too boring.

[02:28] The second rule that I have is quality over quantity,

[02:31] but quality quantity wins over quality.

[02:33] In order to know what its quality,

[02:35] it usually takes reps to get good.

[02:36] And so you will probably do a lot in the beginning

[02:38] and it will probably suck, comma, and that's okay

[02:41] because it is a requisite for getting good.

[02:43] You start by sucking and then you get better

[02:45] and then eventually you suck so little, you're actually good.

[02:48] The difference between phase one and two

[02:50] and phase three, four, five is the objective.

[02:52] If you're doing phase three, four, five,

[02:54] the objective is to generate new customers from content.

[02:57] And it's different than phase one and phase two,

[02:59] where the only reason you can do that

[03:01] is just to have lead nurture.

[03:02] Just to give you guys some sales stuff,

[03:04] just to give you guys some fodder and just test some hooks.

[03:06] Those are the five phases.

[03:07] If you're a small business owner, that cost time

[03:09] and that cost money.

[03:10] So what do you do?

[03:11] Because I actually have had this conversation

[03:13] with probably half of our portfolio companies

[03:15] in the last three months.

[03:15] What is the role of organic marketing play

[03:17] in the business from a concept of acquiring customers?

[03:20] That's what we do this stuff, right?

[03:21] We do this to Quark customers.

[03:22] If you have other ways of getting customers,

[03:24] which for most of you would be

[03:25] manual app bound affiliates or paid ads,

[03:28] besides referrals.

[03:29] And if those are the primary channels,

[03:31] you do not want to take your eye off the ball on that.

[03:33] That's what's paying the bills.

[03:33] That being said, the purpose

[03:35] are the objective of having the organic content

[03:38] is lead nurture, not lead generation.

[03:40] So what happens is someone comes in through an affiliate.

[03:42] Someone comes in through a paid ad.

[03:43] Someone comes in through manual app on

[03:45] because you had an SDR call them

[03:46] or they got a cold email.

[03:47] What do they do?

[03:48] They look at your social profile,

[03:49] they look at your website and they say,

[03:50] is this personal legit?

[03:51] The only litmus test you have to pass there

[03:53] is that you've posted something recently that's not shit.

[03:56] That's really it.

[03:57] They'll probably consume two, three, four pieces of content

[03:59] and say, this guy at this gal knows what they're talking about.

[04:01] This is recent enough that I know they're still in business.

[04:04] This is a legitimate business.

[04:05] That's all we're trying to accomplish here.

[04:07] And if you do start to have content

[04:08] that starts performing better than others,

[04:10] that gives you two things.

[04:11] One is it gives the sales guys content

[04:13] that they can proactively feed to the prospects.

[04:15] And so what you should build is a master

[04:18] excelsi of your best content of all time

[04:20] because there is some content that you've made

[04:21] knowingly or unknownly that convinces more people

[04:23] to buy from you.

[04:24] On that content sheet, you'll have one of the FAQs,

[04:26] one of the types of questions that people ask on sales calls,

[04:29] which gives you great fodder for the types of content

[04:30] that you're making the future.

[04:31] And again, you do it for one for the sales team

[04:33] and two for marketing.

[04:34] You do it for the sales team

[04:35] because as soon as they have that question,

[04:37] they can send that as a reply

[04:38] between call one and call two to close your prospect.

[04:41] Or if they have the question that they found out

[04:42] before the call, they can send it to them beforehand

[04:44] increase the likelihood they close.

[04:46] So that's the first tangential benefit

[04:47] besides nurture that making this content helps you with.

[04:50] The second one is that it gives you an idea

[04:52] of what you can start leading with on your paid side.

[04:54] They're just proportionally saving it,

[04:55] disproportionately sharing it.

[04:57] When you run paid ads, you can look at your organic content

[04:59] like dude, I don't know what it is,

[05:00] people went nuts for this.

[05:01] If for some reason this headline or this hook worked well,

[05:04] you weave it into everyone of your cold emails

[05:06] and you can split test and say, wow, this beat our control.

[05:09] And so think of the content you're making

[05:11] as just low risk, ways of testing,

[05:14] hooks and headlines to get people to buy from you.

[05:16] Phase one and phase two.

[05:17] If you're in one of those camps,

[05:18] you don't need to do anything else.

[05:19] That's it.

[05:20] That's all you gotta do.

[05:21] If you wanna know what it looks like to actually use

[05:23] content marketing as a way to generate leads.

[05:25] Phase three, which is your posting once a week

[05:28] or on some cadence on all platforms.

[05:29] The purpose of phase three is learning

[05:31] what packaging looks like on each of the platforms.

[05:33] If you've ever seen that meme that had like Tinder,

[05:36] LinkedIn, Facebook and Instagram,

[05:38] platforms are all a little bit different.

[05:40] Same person just packaged a little differently.

[05:42] This tweak here, then getting put into a TikTok,

[05:45] then also getting put into a YouTube short

[05:47] and then also getting put into a real.

[05:49] It's the same concept, the same subject matter,

[05:51] but we package it a little bit differently.

[05:53] Phase four is you then say great.

[05:54] I feel actually finally get each of these platforms

[05:56] and this fucking takes time.

[05:58] It takes probably six months

[05:59] and this is if you have means to pay for this stuff

[06:01] and I'll get into the cost in a second.

[06:02] Maxing out the platforms, which is phase four.

[06:04] Number five is actively creating.

[06:06] So, can't really, right now I'm barely scratching phase five.

[06:09] We're actually just dialing on phase four,

[06:11] which is maximizing across all platforms.

[06:13] We're not really there yet,

[06:14] we're maxed out and probably half the platforms.

[06:16] I'm gonna finish this one right?

[06:17] With three, four, five, you're actually making good enough

[06:19] content that the platforms are serving it to new audiences

[06:22] because they are able to grow the amount of time

[06:25] people spend on the platform

[06:26] because your stuff is good.

[06:27] The pay you and impressions for providing value

[06:30] to their audience or followers more likes, all that stuff.

[06:32] You still have to have a way to convert those people

[06:35] into customers.

[06:36] And so the way to do that is just having called it actions.

[06:39] For example, if you're a business doing $3 million

[06:41] or more in your internet business,

[06:42] go to acquisition.com, it can fill out the stuff

[06:44] for minority investment.

[06:45] That's what we do.

[06:46] Put that into your content and then the rest of your time

[06:48] you're just providing value.

[06:49] You don't need to get fancy with it.

[06:51] Do you don't wanna be one of those guys

[06:52] who just pitching all the time?

[06:53] A lot of people oversell the small amount of demand they have

[06:56] so they can never grow the audience.

[06:57] The more you give, the more you grow,

[06:59] the more you take them where you shrink.

[07:00] And when you do it that way, you never go hungry

[07:02] because you always have more people

[07:03] not gonna on your door than you have seating in your house.

[07:06] From a cost perspective, there's time cost,

[07:08] there's long-term cost and there's money cost.

[07:10] If you start doing content as your way

[07:12] of getting customers, expect it to take a long time,

[07:14] I start making content for acquisition.com

[07:16] about 18 months before we really started seeing

[07:18] any kind of deal flow or growth across the platforms.

[07:21] If you think about this as a long-term play,

[07:23] I still believe that fame is the most efficient business model.

[07:26] All right, it's one of the best ways

[07:27] to arbitrage making money, but it takes time

[07:30] and no one's willing to wait,

[07:31] which then gives you competitive advantage

[07:33] because patience is one of the ultimate advantages

[07:35] is that you're just willing to do things

[07:36] for an unreasonably long period of time

[07:37] without thinking you smarter than you really are.

[07:39] A quote from Neil Strauss.

[07:40] Even at phase three, it's gonna be pretty much

[07:42] beyond your capacity to actually

[07:44] create capture, edit, and distribute across all platforms.

[07:47] You're not gonna be able to do it on your own.

[07:48] And so you need some degree of leverage.

[07:50] That leverage is gonna come in the form of labor.

[07:52] You're gonna have to pay people to help you out.

[07:53] In the beginning, the more costly way of doing it,

[07:56] but faster is to have vendors.

[07:58] So to have people who are specialists on each of these platforms

[08:01] because what they're gonna do is get you up to speed

[08:02] five times faster.

[08:03] They're gonna already know all the mistakes

[08:05] that people normally make.

[08:06] Now, one thing they have to look out for for vendors

[08:08] and this is especially important.

[08:09] You know, for me is that most vendors are data driven.

[08:12] And what I mean by that is they get obsessed with clicks

[08:15] and views and impressions and subscribers.

[08:16] That's good to a degree.

[08:19] It's okay to be satisfied with a smaller audience

[08:21] that's just the type of person

[08:23] that you're actually looking to attract.

[08:24] It's hard to make the shift,

[08:26] and it's really hard to ram it down there,

[08:27] it's because most clients that pay them

[08:29] only care about those things

[08:30] because they don't know what else to measure.

[08:32] Just because it's easy to quantify,

[08:33] doesn't mean it's important.

[08:34] The values that you have, the messages that you wanna get out there,

[08:37] who you're trying to reach will be more important

[08:39] than the quantitative metrics.

[08:41] Are those good lip mis tests

[08:42] in terms of if nothing you ever have hits?

[08:44] Yeah, you should probably pay attention to that.

[08:46] But if only once specific type of thing hits

[08:47] and it's not core to who you are,

[08:49] you gotta be able to resist that temptation

[08:51] because otherwise you're gonna build this audience.

[08:52] Doing stuff you don't wanna do,

[08:53] attract people you don't wanna be with.

[08:54] For us to put out the stuff that we put out right now

[08:56] across all platforms for LaLaAndi,

[08:59] cost about 70,000 a month.

[09:01] That's to put out roughly 160 pieces of content

[09:04] and we feel like, oh my God, I'm like, I know, it's a lot.

[09:07] That's because we're trying to promote.

[09:08] We're using this instead of using paid ads.

[09:11] So if I were to just pay for the impressions,

[09:13] it would cost me about $2 million a month

[09:14] to get the impressions that right now,

[09:16] cost me about 70,000 a month.

[09:17] I have a lot of cost savings doing it organically.

[09:20] The level on that though is how good you are.

[09:23] And that's tough.

[09:24] And it probably sounds weird for me to even say this.

[09:26] So take it the way that you probably are hopefully

[09:29] know that I mean it.

[09:29] Most people talk about stuff that they don't have

[09:32] the right to talk about,

[09:33] just because you call yourself an expert

[09:34] doesn't make it true.

[09:35] And so the question is, how narrowly can I define the problem

[09:38] that I solve so that in that tiny world,

[09:40] in that pond, I am king.

[09:41] Do you might not be the best business person in the world?

[09:43] I'm not.

[09:44] But the question is of all the sources of information

[09:46] that are both entertaining and educational

[09:48] is the stuff that you put out there.

[09:49] Good enough that people are like,

[09:51] I will pay attention to this person

[09:53] because if you've ever struggled to give away your services

[09:56] for free, it's because the biggest cost isn't your price.

[09:59] To people aren't willing to pay for it with their attention,

[10:01] then it has other costs, which is it's not worth their attention.

[10:04] Why should this person listen to me

[10:05] and why is this worth their time?

[10:07] If you can answer those questions in the content

[10:09] you're making an tangible way

[10:10] that their life is gonna get better as a result,

[10:12] they'll come back and tell their friends.

[10:14] I'm not Andy Vrcell, I'm not Gary Vee,

[10:15] I'm not at my let.

[10:16] I'm not all closing in on a billion dollars

[10:17] plus I'm not crank hard on.

[10:19] We'll don't try and compete with them.

[10:20] But if you're like, hey, I'm the fastest toilet fixer

[10:23] in this side of Tuscaloosa,

[10:24] you might only be competing in three guys.

[10:26] If you have evidence, you are beyond reproach.

[10:28] If someone looks at you and says,

[10:29] like, hey man, you're content scrap,

[10:31] you can be like, this is how you fix toilets.

[10:33] I'll try and be more entertained in next time,

[10:34] but this is how you fix them.

[10:35] And you have evidence that you fix 500 toilets this way.

[10:38] First you're fixing toilets.

[10:39] And then you're talking about how you can expand

[10:40] a plumbing business.

[10:41] And then you're talking about how you can expand on local business.

[10:43] And then you're talking about marketing on whatever

[10:44] specific method you use to grow your thing.

[10:46] And then you're talking about expanding an enterprise.

[10:48] And then loan behold, you're a business expert,

[10:51] but it takes time.

[10:52] If you're a small business owner, you can do the first two phases,

[10:54] just post about stuff, make sure it's valuable,

[10:56] just to make sure that you are a legitimate looking business

[10:58] that looks like its doors say open on it.

[11:00] That's all we're trying to accomplish

[11:01] and help the sales guys out.

[11:02] If you want to make content marketing,

[11:04] you're actually a regeneration machine,

[11:05] then you need to invest it

[11:06] the same way you invest in it for paid marketing.

[11:08] You're going to probably have to have vendors.

[11:10] You're probably over time that you learn from your vendors.

[11:12] You're going to bring employees in house

[11:13] and you're going to teach it to them.

[11:14] And then you start scaling the volume up internally.

[11:16] And then phase five, you go max out mode, right?

[11:18] You start cranking out on everything

[11:19] and then you start creating stuff specifically.

[11:21] But when you're doing that at that phase,

[11:23] you probably don't need to worry about this for you.

[00:00] How is it that two entrepreneurs can start a business at the exact same time and two years later?

[00:05] One of them is 20 times as big as the other one.

[00:08] And how can an entrepreneur achieve success make some big risk, lose it all,

[00:14] and then start over again and then achieve back to the same love success in a fraction of the time

[00:19] compared to somebody who's starting from scratch? That's the question that I want to answer

[00:22] today in this video. And if you don't know how I am on Instagram, I own acquisition.com.

[00:27] It's a portfolio of companies that's about 85 million dollars a year.

[00:30] And the reason I make these videos is because I was once broke and there are a lot of people who

[00:33] broke and I do not want you to be one of them. When you are scaling a company,

[00:38] one of the difficult pieces of this because I've tried to think back like, why is it that

[00:42] every single time we start another company required interest? Everything goes so much faster.

[00:46] Even when the strategy itself is not that complex. And so think about this structurally.

[00:51] Most business strategies are not complicated. Find something that's something that's

[00:56] not finds something people want. Tarrage a lot of money for it and deliver that thing really well.

[01:00] So much so that they tell other people about your product. It's not overwhelmingly complex to

[01:05] consider. The execution is difficult, but the concept is not. And so a lot of people think they're

[01:10] going to win on strategy when they're starting a business. When you could have two people who have

[01:14] longcare companies and one person has a longcare company where the billion dollars and one person

[01:17] can barely break $5,000 a month, it's not because the strategy is significantly different. It's just

[01:22] the execution. How is it that an entrepreneur or two entrepreneurs can start at the exact same time

[01:27] and one can get 10, 20, 30 times faster? Or when you start over again, you can always skip

[01:33] these steps to get to your level of incompetence. My theory around this comes down to pattern recognition.

[01:40] And let me explain. It's not just pattern recognition from the perspective that you have strategies

[01:45] or something that you're recognizing, but actually patterns in people. And so I'm going to give

[01:50] this a quick story to drive this this point home. I have struggled for the last decade to find

[01:56] an assistant. And so it's one of the things I'm actually a little embarrassed about, but I've gone

[02:01] over seven on assistance. So much so to the point that I was just, I almost kind of gave up just even

[02:07] trying to find an assistant. And until recently, every time I had an assistant, it just always

[02:12] write off the bat. It just never felt like right and I always was like, yeah, maybe it'll get better.

[02:17] It'll get better at it. And they just never really did. And the problem was that I didn't know

[02:21] what it looks like when it's right. And so in the videos that I talk about, I use the work,

[02:26] the term ideal scene. I don't know what the ideal scene of this dynamic looks like. When we are

[02:32] scaling companies, right? And I'll tell you what I found out there in a second, but like when we're

[02:37] scaling companies, what we have to do is pay down ignorance tax of knowing what ideal scene looks like,

[02:43] which is where speed comes from having people who have outside eyes look in, who already do

[02:49] know what ideal scene looks like, so you can skip steps faster. And so I'll give you an example

[02:53] with this looks like in the real life. Like for me, in the role of executive assistant, thank God

[02:57] that like for me, it wasn't a necessary thing to continue to grow the businesses. Now that I have one,

[03:02] I don't ever really want to live life without one. But the entire time, I kept bringing people in.

[03:08] I didn't know what to look for. We do hiring, you know, we do hiring process. We do an onboarding

[03:13] training process. They never really got up to speed or we never really got in sync. And then

[03:17] I'd slowly kind of fall away. There would be distance and then it became kind of awkward and then I would

[03:21] end having to cut the relationship. And so in this instance, we immediately synced up. I really like the

[03:26] person. I trust the person and they are so proactive in all aspects of my life that I just sit down

[03:32] and start working and then she places things in front of me. I'm like, hey, I got 13 minutes. She's like,

[03:36] cool, do this. And I'm like, I've got, you know, 18 minutes here. She's like, cool, do this and do this.

[03:40] And every time I'm done, I'm like, hey, what else should I do? She's like, boom. And so we meet

[03:44] based on the priorities that I have. And then she has this big stack and notes how long if you

[03:47] every one of these things takes because I talk to her about how long I think the tasks will take. And then

[03:51] as I have openings, we slot it in. So it's like, I wake up and I'm just crushing work until the end of the

[03:56] day because I know that the amount of time that's been a lot of for each of the tasks is the appropriate amount of

[04:00] time. And so, and if I do finish early, I get another task done. Right. And so we can we can we can crush

[04:04] stuff. But it's not so much that this is the importance of the executive assistant more so that it took so long

[04:09] for me to get one. And now that I do have one, I know that I will not ever not have one for the

[04:14] rest of my life because now I know what ideal scene looks like. I know it to look for within the

[04:19] roles that exist in the company. There are going to be these gaps as you're growing. You know,

[04:25] probably on some level that you might need somebody who's going to be a director of marketing. You

[04:29] might know on some level that you need somebody who's going to be a director of sales. You might

[04:31] know on some of you need a director of HR, director of finance, director of customer success,

[04:36] director of product, you know director of, you know, all these different things, right? Legal

[04:40] maybe. And so these heads of the companies have to commit. And so there's two different ideal scenes

[04:44] that you have to know. Number one is what sequence these people will best fit and you hire because

[04:49] you don't hire them all at once, obviously. As you're scaling. But the second is what does that

[04:53] person look like? Not just like what does the role do, but what does somebody who's very good at this role

[04:59] look like? What we're doing is looking at people who are exceptional at the role and saying, how can

[05:04] I find something just like this? And that is why people can go so much faster because once you

[05:10] have figured out what a sales director look like, who's good or a salesman, who's good or

[05:16] marketing director, who's good, you can find and duplicate that pattern again. Fundamentally,

[05:22] like this is like my belief in terms of speed of scale is that you do not know what the people

[05:26] look like. And it's one of the issues that we do with the most with our portfolio companies. So

[05:31] the portfolio companies that we work with are almost all e-learning and coaching type businesses

[05:37] and service-based businesses. And we work with those companies and they're like, hey, you know,

[05:42] my mom can do some math and so she's going to be our controller. I don't think she's what,

[05:49] that's not ideal scene. That's not what this looks like. Like just being able to do math is not,

[05:53] I mean, it's a requisite. But it's not all of the requisites for becoming a really good controller.

[05:57] And to the same degree, it's like, hey, we've got our top salesman. He's going to become a sales director.

[06:02] I don't know if that's necessarily a good idea. He might just be a really high level individual

[06:05] contributor and not a very good sales leader or sales manager. The big mistakes that happen and they

[06:11] are so costly because of the time in two ways. Wanted to take time to bring these people on board

[06:16] and then it takes time to figure out that they're not good. It takes time to offboard them.

[06:20] And then the whole while you're not growing because that whole cycle took the time if you had the right

[06:26] person, all of the aspects of that department would be growing rather than staying the same

[06:31] you're just moving on and starting as the department was growing, who don't and started

[06:36] filling another role with the right person. And then that department would start to be growing.

[06:40] Instead, you have to spend all this time in order to be on this department that you've mishired for.

[06:44] And then find someone else replace and you couldn't even hire the next person you need.

[06:48] And so when you're thinking about this, and this is the big takeaway for everyone,

[06:51] is that speed comes from picking the right people and knowing what right looks like and don't get me wrong.

[06:57] You're going to make mistakes, we all make mistakes. But I can tell you that it's very easy to

[07:02] know when someone is not a stud. It's hard to know if someone comes in and starts to stud and then

[07:08] goes down. But I can tell you that every single stud that I've had, every single a player have had,

[07:12] I've known they were an a player within the first couple days. And so I've had a player

[07:15] through then stop being a players. But if someone is not an a player up front, I've never had

[07:21] someone become an a player. And so your tolerance or my tolerance for non-excellence continues to

[07:26] decrease in time so that I can not waste the time of trying to figure out whether this person is

[07:32] going to help me grow the business. In terms of the thing that is probably getting in your way,

[07:36] it's your tolerance is too high for people who are not that good. And a misunderstanding of what

[07:40] the roles look like that you need to hire. And so the things that you need to do are to decrease your

[07:45] tolerance and find people who already know what this role looks like when it is excellent.

[07:51] All right, so don't take advice from people who are one step ahead of you, right? Because they might not

[07:55] know I mean how many times have you heard someone say oh I've got this new someone so they're so

[07:58] great. And then four months later they're like oh no I actually got rid of that person. It didn't

[08:03] work out. Don't listen to people who are like two steps you know one step ahead or six months ahead

[08:08] like it's not useful. Find somebody who's built multiple of the types of departments you're looking for,

[08:12] skilled it for a long period of time. And then that person will be able to share what the what the

[08:17] requisites are for the roles that you're looking for. All right. So anyways, most of the nation

[08:22] lots love keep rocking and I'll see you guys in the next video. Keep rushing.

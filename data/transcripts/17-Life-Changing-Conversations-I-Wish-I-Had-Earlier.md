[00:00] These are 17 conversations made me millions of my 20s.

[00:02] Number one, I was going back and forth between quitting my job and starting a jam or starting

[00:07] my entrepreneurial journey.

[00:08] Another early mentor, he sat me down and said, man, I've been listening to you waffle for

[00:12] months now.

[00:13] He said at some point, you're not going to know anymore.

[00:15] He just had to jump.

[00:16] He said it in a way that made me feel like a pansy.

[00:18] I realized I didn't need more information that I already done all of the research.

[00:21] I just needed to decide.

[00:23] The definition of the decision comes from the Latin D. Cadara, which basically means to cut off

[00:26] or kill off.

[00:27] Because which future was I deciding to kill off?

[00:29] Was it the future that I was in currently that I didn't like anymore?

[00:32] Or was it the future that I had the potential to accomplish the dreams that I had?

[00:35] By not deciding I was actively killing off the future that had my dreams and that I

[00:39] needed to choose which one I wanted to kill.

[00:41] Number two, very beginning of my entrepreneurial journey, I didn't know how to sell anything.

[00:43] Man, a mentor just said, do you want to know the secret to sales?

[00:46] I leaned in.

[00:47] I was like, yes, please, I only had my no bad-out.

[00:49] The secret to sales is making it offer so good people feel stupid saying no.

[00:52] And that obviously became the subtitle of my unabillet offer's book.

[00:55] I kept thinking that I had to learn how to like kind of manipulate and going through

[00:58] sales scripts and building rapport and church.

[01:01] Some of those skills are useful to have when it's so much easier to just find things that

[01:04] people really want.

[01:05] Chick-fil-a doesn't need to sell you on chicken sandwiches.

[01:07] They just have amazing chicken sandwiches and people go buy them.

[01:09] And that forever changed how I created new products, created new services.

[01:13] Was I started with how to get the most people to say yes and then worked back?

[01:16] Number three, my next mentor was a $10 billion CLO.

[01:19] He always said, you gotta go slow to go fast.

[01:21] He kept repeating it to me over and over and over again.

[01:23] You only unlock the compounding, which later on grow significantly faster than the

[01:28] erratic activity of smothing, smothing, your new thing here, new thing here, then just doing

[01:32] the same thing for an extended period of time.

[01:34] And so what feels slow in the micro looks fast in the macro.

[01:37] When you look at the trajectory over a long period of time, what looks really fast in the

[01:40] micro is usually really slow in the macro because people can never get that compounding

[01:45] start harnessing because they're always starting back over at ground zero.

[01:47] And ever you change something, the one cost is guaranteed is that change will have to

[01:51] get paid for.

[01:52] And what isn't guaranteed is that it's going to work.

[01:53] You know you have this fixed cost of just how you should see it is that whenever you change

[01:56] something you have to pay a price.

[01:57] Number four, the next lesson I learned was in level of effort.

[01:59] One of my early mentors told me about flyer.

[02:01] I thought I needed to go put a lot of flyers out to get business.

[02:04] Put out 300 flyers.

[02:05] So I called them and I was like, hey, this didn't work.

[02:07] And he's like, what was your test side?

[02:08] We made my test side.

[02:09] And I just put out 300 total.

[02:10] He just laughed.

[02:11] 300.

[02:12] You're not going to know anything with 300.

[02:13] He's like, we test with 5,000, then we do 5,000 a day after that.

[02:15] $1,000 a day.

[02:16] $1,250,000.

[02:17] I might have been doing the right thing all along.

[02:20] But I was just doing far too little of it.

[02:21] And at that point, I decided that whenever someone gave me advice, I wouldn't let the

[02:24] volume of activity that's to be the reason to fail.

[02:26] But I just hadn't done enough of them.

[02:27] We're ahead and done them long enough.

[02:28] I see so many smaller younger entrepreneurs who do something for too short, too little

[02:32] time, not enough volume that they might have been doing the right thing.

[02:35] They just didn't wait long enough or they didn't do enough of it.

[02:37] Number five, I was at actually a mastermind and I saw a guy get up and he seems so disorganized.

[02:42] And he said, yeah, you know, we're making three or four hundred thousand dollars a month.

[02:46] It's like we've been stuck here for a few years.

[02:47] Layling, I were actually together at this point.

[02:49] We both looked at each other where we're like, this guy can do it.

[02:52] We can do it.

[02:53] It was one of those moments that beliefs are broken because what you find out is that they

[02:56] are made of the same thing as you.

[02:57] Rather than right off, this guy's such an idiot, despite him being an idiot, he's still

[03:01] more successful than me.

[03:02] Imagine if I used my work ethic and my intelligence and when I shifted my perspective from

[03:07] that way, I was able to start using other people's successes to fuel me rather than to make

[03:11] me feel bad.

[03:12] It switched from wanting to cast stones of people to being inspired by them and thinking if

[03:15] they can do it so can I.

[03:16] Within six months of seeing that conversation happen, we were already doing a mile and

[03:19] number six at a different event.

[03:21] I went up and I spoke and I told my whole plans of how I wanted to build this national

[03:25] gym chain.

[03:26] The America's next gym, the guy who ran the mastermind said, you know what Alex, I don't

[03:29] think you should do that at all.

[03:30] I was crushed when he said, I think you have a level 10 skill set in the level two

[03:32] opportunity.

[03:33] One of those simultaneously, incredibly encouraging things and incredibly heartbreaking things.

[03:37] So it was a very like emotional moment for me.

[03:39] He was both encouraging me to say, like, could have been doing more and this person from the

[03:42] outside put a bar up that was significantly higher than what I was shooting for and that

[03:46] stretched my horizon for what I was capable of.

[03:49] And I think getting around people who can do that for you is one of the most viable things

[03:52] you could possibly have in your life.

[03:54] What he didn't say was a level two opportunity is he was defining it and opportunity

[03:58] that has low leverage.

[03:59] There wasn't a very good compounding vehicle for capital.

[04:01] The fact that I was successful in what most consider a shitty opportunity, he saw as the

[04:05] skill sets that would create a much bigger win later.

[04:07] If you are in a lower level opportunity, I wouldn't say be upset about it.

[04:11] I would say you're learning with extra resistance against you.

[04:14] You're getting stronger now and then when you go onto the moon or gravity's lighter,

[04:18] you just knock it out in the park.

[04:19] Number seven was a private event.

[04:20] It was 10 people.

[04:21] Everyone was doing eight figures a more year and I got invited.

[04:23] The guy came up to me and this guy had done $27 million in a single bag.

[04:26] Holy shit.

[04:27] This guy's made more and a day than I made more and a dollar a lot.

[04:29] He said that pitches in life don't come very often.

[04:32] When it gets easy, is when you need to go hard.

[04:33] Otherwise, there's someone who's 10 times bigger than you who's going to take everything

[04:36] you have and not even think twice about it.

[04:38] That was literally fueled by that one conversation.

[04:40] If you're like, wait, how are you doing 300,000 a month taking them through and I'd like

[04:43] no employees and I was making it all myself.

[04:44] Do you have one of those opportunities that comes up in your life when things start

[04:47] working really well?

[04:48] That's when a lot of people ease off the gas.

[04:50] That's when they go easy.

[04:51] When it gets easy is when you go hard because you don't have that many fat pitches in

[04:55] a lifetime.

[04:56] You might get two or three and you just got to crack this shit out of them when it comes

[04:58] and expect that you're going to sacrifice some short term for some long term later.

[05:02] Number eight.

[05:03] The same event, a different guy came up to me.

[05:04] He said, you're skint.

[05:06] Well, you're like doubling every month with this current thing.

[05:08] Like, why do you want to start a supplement business?

[05:11] What if you just spent three times as much in marketing and didn't start a supplement

[05:14] business?

[05:15] I didn't start the supplement business.

[05:16] I actually delayed it for 18 months.

[05:17] And the next three months, we tripled the ad spend and went from 400 to 780 to 780 to

[05:22] a million from a million to 2 million just the next six months because of that piece of

[05:25] advice.

[05:26] And I think the underlying part of that advice is that when something is going well, oftentimes

[05:30] entrepreneurs think, great, I won.

[05:32] How can I get another win?

[05:34] But the real win is just doing 10 times more of that thing.

[05:36] The hardest part is getting product market fit.

[05:38] It's getting people to want to buy the thing.

[05:40] Once you have that, you don't need to innovate that anymore.

[05:42] All your innovation has to go to how can we do more volume.

[05:44] Number nine.

[05:45] The reason was from a guy who had a big e-commerce brand.

[05:48] So he was doing 30 million here at the time and I was like, oh my god, this guy is God.

[05:52] He gave this huge presentation.

[05:53] It was like two hours long.

[05:54] He said, so pick a percentage, whatever it is, 10% 20% of your marketing spend and put that

[05:59] towards new ideas.

[06:00] Expect to lose it.

[06:01] But when you're losing it, you're gaining the less it and you're gaining the experience.

[06:04] And what happens is he's like, you know, four out of five times for crazy ideas, fellas.

[06:07] He's like, but one out of five, they crush and become the leading edge innovation that pushes

[06:11] us to the next level.

[06:12] Immediately took a number and I wrote down what my new learning budget was going to be.

[06:15] And it gave me permission to spend money without return immediately.

[06:18] You think big picture.

[06:19] He just extended my time horizon for a return.

[06:22] And so rather than saying, I have to make my money back immediately within 30 days

[06:25] of me spending this, I said, if I extend my horizon over my lifetime, if I spend this money,

[06:29] I will learn to be better and I will learn faster than somebody who doesn't.

[06:32] I just gave myself a budget to say, it is acceptable to lose this and then I committed

[06:36] to that.

[06:37] And that was a huge pivot point for how we were able to scale and try new things.

[06:41] And I looked forward to spending on my learning budget every month and it just gave me

[06:44] permission to be creative knowing that it would be okay to fail.

[06:47] Number 10.

[06:48] The next one I got from a pastor between Leila and I.

[06:50] He gave us a single piece of marriage advice that we have taken two day.

[06:54] We have used countless times in our lives, both in our marriage personally and professionally

[06:58] in the business.

[06:59] He said, if you don't agree, don't move forward.

[07:01] It was such a simple piece of advice because we have always made our decisions together.

[07:05] And if we don't agree, we slow down.

[07:06] A lot of times, we impose this false sense of urgency on ourselves when there's almost nothing

[07:11] that is urgent.

[07:12] Unless you're going to die, which is the only real urgency, because then a lot of times

[07:15] taking an extra second to think, okay, is there something we're missing?

[07:17] Is there a frame that we're not saying?

[07:18] If we don't agree, first question we always ask is what information are you using?

[07:22] Oftentimes, one of us will have data that the other person doesn't.

[07:25] Because we have the same values and same mission, we do ultimately come to the same decisions.

[07:28] That has saved me so many mistakes.

[07:30] Number 11, I went to a big half a billion dollar mastermind.

[07:33] It said we were like 10 of us there and the total sales of everyone in the room is about half a billion

[07:37] dollars.

[07:38] But I was still among the smaller ones.

[07:39] I was just wondering if we were doing 30 or 40 million dollars a year at the time.

[07:41] And plenty of guys there were at 100, 200, etc.

[07:44] What do they have?

[07:45] Are they smarter?

[07:46] Are they working hard?

[07:47] Are they sacrificing more?

[07:48] They had a bigger total of just one more.

[07:49] They had a bigger term.

[07:50] They were going after just a much wider audience.

[07:52] So you start small.

[07:53] So the riches are in the niches.

[07:54] But at a certain point, you do need to open up the aperture.

[07:57] So Facebook started with college, right?

[07:59] That was the niche.

[08:00] And then slowly, spend it over time.

[08:01] I had to open up my eyes and say, you know what?

[08:03] Maybe I can go broader in some way.

[08:05] Number 12, this was one of the first billionaires that I ever met.

[08:07] I had been stuck at 30 to 40 million for like three years.

[08:09] So there was a lot of learning that I was trying to do in this period to break through

[08:12] that wall.

[08:13] I was telling him all these things that I was doing to try and go my business.

[08:16] And he just laughed.

[08:17] He said, it's not about you.

[08:18] It's about everybody else.

[08:19] And what do you mean by that?

[08:20] Wasn't like me versus customer or anything like that.

[08:22] He was like, all you've been telling me is what you're going to do.

[08:25] You need to have a stable of stallions.

[08:27] You need to give people a slice of the pie and let them get rich too.

[08:32] And up to that point, I had hoarded everything.

[08:33] I was like, you know what got me from a hundred million dollars top line to 500 million

[08:36] dollars top line doing less and getting really smart people to help me out and giving them

[08:40] a big slice.

[08:41] It's about talent.

[08:42] It's about people.

[08:43] You have to get other people who can make decisions on your behalf and you feel not only

[08:46] that they were as good as your decisions, but even better.

[08:48] Because the beginning you're a jack maltreates master of none, but you need to have mastery

[08:52] in every department of the business in order for it to scale.

[08:54] And you can either see that as I have to learn everything or the faster way, which is

[08:58] I can go buy it through other people who've already given 10 years.

[09:01] If I can get 10 people who've all spent 20 years in their respective departments, I basically

[09:06] have 200 years of experience.

[09:08] And if every person in the organization has learned everything from you, then it's only

[09:11] one brain and one lifetime.

[09:13] That is the limit of the organization.

[09:15] That thing is what got us past the 30 to 40 million.

[09:17] That was a huge breakthrough for me.

[09:19] Number 13, the next conversation I had was really the one that pushed me over the edge.

[09:22] I have a famous friend.

[09:23] I was at his house and we were sitting at the kitchen table and I said, don't you get tired

[09:26] of all these weirdos like messaging you stuff and like sending you threads and like three

[09:30] people a week stopping by your house, like trying to climb your fence, like not fun.

[09:34] He said, if that's the price I have to pay to make the impact I want to have, then I

[09:37] have paid every day of the week.

[09:39] For whatever reason, it's just like stabbing the heart and it made me feel like if I want

[09:43] to spread a message, if I want to help more people, that there is a cost to it, having

[09:46] now been a little bit the other side and having more recognition and whatnot is that

[09:49] fame has pros and cons.

[09:51] There are cons, but I believe that there are more pros than cons.

[09:55] Are there things that are inconvenient now?

[09:56] Absolutely.

[09:57] You get stopped every time you go to dinner, like you get disrupted, it's hard to be like

[10:00] private and public.

[10:01] If you have a bad day, you can't do it because someone says, hi, it's the one time

[10:03] they're going to see you.

[10:04] You get a lot of things that are common.

[10:05] But the pros outweigh the cons.

[10:06] You get amazing people who will come and want to work with you.

[10:08] You get amazing teammates who otherwise would never know you exist.

[10:11] You also have the same mission, have the same values and you create significantly more

[10:15] alignment in real world value in terms of economic value, in which money you make by having

[10:20] people inbound coming towards you.

[10:21] I just want to talk to you about people who make those.

[10:23] I was like, you see them.

[10:24] Do you call it outreach and run ads, like, don't talk to me.

[10:26] But now having been on the other side of it, I can tell you that it was missing.

[10:28] Number 14, big influencer.

[10:29] I said, hey, you're way further ahead of me, like how do I just shortcut this thing?

[10:34] So he said, hey, you start making content every platform.

[10:35] So I did that.

[10:36] And then I came back six months later and I said, hey, look, we went from zero to two and

[10:39] a thousand people in our audience in six months and noted the progress.

[10:42] But I was like, what's your blueprint?

[10:43] What's the model?

[10:44] Give me the flow chart.

[10:45] He said, dude, we don't have a flow chart.

[10:47] Anybody just want to tell you that is just trying to sell you a system.

[10:49] You just need to do so much more volume than you currently are.

[10:51] He said, just pull up your Instagram and pull up my Instagram.

[10:54] So I pulled it up, pulled it up.

[10:55] He posted five times, I'd posted once.

[10:56] He's like, pull up your LinkedIn, pull up my LinkedIn.

[10:58] He posted seven times, I'd posted once.

[11:01] Platform by platform.

[11:02] Pulling one up and he was embarrassing me with the amount of content he was putting

[11:05] on can break the mic.

[11:06] So in the next six months, I put 10 times the content out and we grew 10 times faster.

[11:11] The interesting lesson I learned from this is that there are principles that are ubiquitous.

[11:14] The more work you do, the more you get.

[11:16] So the boring work applies to everything in business whether it's relationships, whether

[11:20] it's cold calling, whether it's making content, the more you do, the more you get.

[11:23] Number 15.

[11:24] The next one was about investing.

[11:25] I was actually a pretty big pansy when it came to investing.

[11:27] And this was the breakthrough I had at all this money and people were like, I've got this

[11:31] real estate deal.

[11:31] I've got this crypto thing.

[11:32] When you have lots of money, deal flow is not a problem.

[11:35] But I didn't have was like set of rules or parameters.

[11:38] And you have to make those otherwise you get too much decision fatigue.

[11:40] You waste too much time doing diligence on deals, reading, having multiple phone calls,

[11:43] having lawyers come in and deciding not to do it.

[11:45] This one conversation I had changed my life.

[11:47] He was telling somebody who had a lot of real estate experience.

[11:49] If you were to put a circle on this table, what percentage of your brain knows real estate?

[11:54] And he was like, I guess 85%.

[11:56] Okay.

[11:57] What percentage of your brain knows stocks and stuff?

[11:58] He was like, oh, 10 or 15%.

[12:00] He's like, that is your new capital allocation parameter.

[12:04] 85% of your net worth should be in real estate, 15% should be in stocks.

[12:07] And it was so simple for me.

[12:09] I know business.

[12:09] And so what do I invest in now?

[12:11] Only business is.

[12:12] Only risky if you don't know what you're doing.

[12:13] I can write a five or a $10 million check and be fine if I know what if it's a business.

[12:17] Because I understand, I know what pitfalls are going to come up like I get it.

[12:20] Sticking with that, just forever made my life simpler because now when deals come to

[12:23] those, I'm like, that's just not in my will.

[12:24] And I can just immediately say that.

[12:25] So the amount of time and effort and lawyer calls and conversations that that saved me has

[12:30] paid so many dividends.

[12:31] And now our investing is significantly better because it's what I know.

[12:33] And I feel comfortable with it and I can move way fast.

[12:35] Number 16.

[12:36] Leverage behind a product.

[12:37] And the vol is said, you only sell because you don't have a market, you only

[12:40] market because you don't have to build a product.

[12:41] An exceptional product is a quadratic relationship with your audience.

[12:46] Good marketing or good sales is a linear relationship.

[12:48] If you make an exceptional product, something that's so unbelievable that people cannot

[12:51] help themselves with tell other people about it.

[12:53] One person buys the product and they tell two to tell four, four, tell eight.

[12:56] How do I do that?

[12:57] You work on it and you keep working on it and you don't make new products until the

[13:01] first one's right.

[13:02] And if you're like, that's why it takes years.

[13:04] That's why good shit takes time when it really offers.

[13:07] That book continues to sell more copies every month with zero advertising dollars.

[13:12] Actually less work in the long run to build a better thing than it is to build a shitty

[13:16] thing and then have to spend the rest of your time marketing and selling.

[13:19] You want to have leverage in every aspect of your business and the product is the strongest

[13:22] one.

[13:23] Number 17.

[13:24] The last one I learned from Uncle Warren, the power of brand.

[13:25] The only one was always this amorphous thing that I thought was complete BS.

[13:27] I can't quantify it, but I think hand quantify brand.

[13:31] And that is what I learned from Uncle Warren.

[13:32] He said, the amount that you can charge above the commoditized version of your product, the

[13:35] Delta there, is the power of brand.

[13:38] If you have a t-shirt that can sell for $20 normally and can sell for $100 with your

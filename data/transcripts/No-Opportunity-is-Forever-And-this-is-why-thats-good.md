[00:00] What's going on everyone? I want to make this short video for you because I had a number of

[00:05] conversations last week that resulted in kind of this consistent point of coaching, which is

[00:12] it's never going to work forever. And so I've seen this happen in so many different situations where

[00:17] people will try and give themselves a reason to not even begin something because they think

[00:22] that there is an end to it. When the reality is, the only things that don't actually have an end

[00:27] to them are things that you do not understand. And so if you see something as a forever option,

[00:34] then it probably means you do not understand it well enough to begin doing it. So there's a

[00:39] little mind for you. And so let me give you a couple examples to bring this home. So when I was

[00:45] in the fitness space that had a lot of people who'd come up to me and be like, hey man,

[00:49] like I want to start working now and I want to get bigger. I was like awesome, you know, this is how you

[00:52] got a train, blah, blah, blah, and they'd be like, well don't want to get too big. I'm like,

[00:59] you don't even look like you work out. So why don't we start with that? And then we can worry

[01:03] about you getting too big, right? So it's not a perfect example for business, but that's an example

[01:08] of somebody trying to discount starting because they think they cease an end that they do not even

[01:13] understand the journey well enough to comprehend. Another example would be, hey, we're running

[01:19] TikTok ad right now and we're crushing it, right? And someone says, well, we don't know how long

[01:25] TikTok's going to be around or Snapchat or insert whatever new opportunity there is. And so we don't

[01:31] want to do it, right? But the reality is all opportunities are by their very nature arbitrage where

[01:40] you're taking advantage of inefficiencies within two systems or two markets. And so over time,

[01:46] all arbitrage disappears, right? And then markets become more efficient. That's how markets work,

[01:50] right? More and more people see the opportunity, the arbitrage decreases until eventually it's

[01:55] efficient, right? And so when you're looking at opportunities and you see something and it might be a

[02:00] big opportunity, but it only is going to be open for two years, three years. Do you do it or not?

[02:05] It's another series of questions I would happen after that. But I would not discount it simply because

[02:10] you know that it is finite because all opportunities are finite. And to take this exaggerate,

[02:16] you know, this example to a max degree of exaggeration, think about the Fortune 500. There's only

[02:21] one company that's been on there for over a hundred years. And that's G, just one company, right?

[02:30] And so every one of those companies you might have thought or during their day,

[02:33] even like this, things are going to be here forever. The reality is it's not. And markets

[02:38] change so rapidly, it's difficult to reshift an entire infrastructure. Some companies can do it

[02:42] many fail. And so if your business is founded upon taking advantage of an arbitrage opportunity,

[02:49] or an efficiency in a marketplace, or something that is fleeting, right, that comes and goes,

[02:55] that's okay. Many businesses were built off of arbitrage opportunities that created cash flow,

[03:01] human resources that could then be deployed in pivoted in another direction when the opportunity closes.

[03:08] And so it's kind of like saying, well, I don't want to invest in this investment,

[03:13] because it's only going to triple my money in three years. Well, what do I do after it

[03:17] triples my money? Well, you take the money and invest it somewhere else, right? It's the same

[03:22] concept except you're just applying it to your business. And so this is just a caveat that was top

[03:28] of mine that I figured out, chair with you because just so many times we try and take 10 steps forward

[03:32] without even realizing that there's this big pile of money and you can just pick it up and move

[03:37] about your life and it doesn't need to be forever. And so it's just a remembering like,

[03:42] if this were an investment, would you triple your money in three years? Probably. So then don't worry

[03:46] about what you're going to do in 20 years, because you're going to be such a different person than

[03:49] anyways, you might not even want to be in the same thing forever. And so I think sometimes we just

[03:54] create this reason because the real reason is that we fear failing when something seems so easy,

[04:00] right? We fear failing because we might not think we're good enough, or we're being lazy,

[04:05] and we don't want to even start or try. And so it's usually the fear thing, but for some people,

[04:10] you shouldn't get off your ass. But anyways, I hope you found this valuable. Maybe this,

[04:15] you're at a decision right now where you're thinking about investing something, or you're thinking

[04:18] about taking advantage of an opportunity, thinking about investing your time into taking an

[04:23] advantage of some sort of inefficiency. And if it's a massive one, even if it's going to be fleeting,

[04:28] as long as the return is high enough, I think many times it can be worth it. So anyways,

[04:35] this is more targeted for newer entrepreneurs. If you're in an existing vehicle, it means you've

[04:40] already found an arbor child property, so don't try and do another one unless it's something that

[04:45] feeds your original model. But anyways, I hope that makes sense, keeping on some have a fantastic

[04:50] day, and I'll catch you next video. Bye!

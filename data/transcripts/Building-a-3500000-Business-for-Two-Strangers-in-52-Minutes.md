[00:00] This is Calvin and Air, a husband-of-wife duo that run a tire restaurant that does $3.5 million a year

[00:05] and has lines out the door. But they're opening up their second location next month and they're not ready.

[00:10] If they mess this up, they could lose their savings and the reputation they spent years building.

[00:15] I'm Alex Mozi, I would acquisition.com, a portfolio of companies that generate hundreds of millions of dollars a year.

[00:20] Earlier, my career, I sold a service business for $46.2 million that helped brick-and-mortar businesses like theirs scale,

[00:26] so I'm excited to help Calvin and Air open their second location. Get one time customers back more frequently,

[00:31] supercharge the reviews and a whole lot more. Hi Alex, how you doing? My name is Calvin and this is my wife, Air. Hi.

[00:38] Welcome. We're the owners of Bayes on the Coltite cuisine in Diamond Var.

[00:41] 2024, our revenue was 3.5 million. Gross profit was $6,000,000. Our net margins was 19% and served over

[00:49] 100,000 guests last year. First impressions, restaurants have the highest failure rate of all businesses.

[00:54] So the fact that they're at 90% margins, I would say that's good. I would love to see

[00:59] we expand it. Some people might hear that and be like, I thought, the average restaurant margins are smaller.

[01:03] Yeah, they sure are. And that also doesn't mean that we need to be constrained by that.

[01:07] So what is the goal? So I go is to open 20 restaurant locations in an x5 to 10 years

[01:13] and want to bring in over $80 million in revenues. All right.

[01:16] We want to get there by providing nice and comfortable space for friends and family to gather over delicious

[01:22] and other mission that we have personally is really is to create environments for staff to show

[01:28] case that talent and also receive competitive pay. How did you start the business? Maybe 15 years

[01:34] ago. And that is when Calvin and I met in a Thai restaurant in Sanamonica. He was a buser and I was a

[01:40] server. So naturally, you know, we talk, right? And then we talk about a big goal wanting to become an

[01:46] entrepreneur and owner restaurant in a few terms. Well, that plan goes so well that I ended up marrying

[01:51] him in 2019, open our first restaurant basically in Coen Diamond by California. Within the first

[01:58] three years, we max out our capacity. We actually list the next unit and we able to meet the demands.

[02:04] But we are starting to max out again. So the kick is our our entire eatery in a social

[02:10] California coming up soon. Okay, so who do you serve? So we serve our local communities, businesses

[02:16] and families in Diamond War. Now people who walk into the door, we see an age range between 25 to

[02:23] maybe 60 and we in a very situated mid to high income neighborhood. Awesome. Well, how do you make money?

[02:30] Let's go through the numbers. So our average food item is $16. Okay. Our most expensive one is $68

[02:35] to crying tiger average ticket size is $60 to $80. 80 on the weekends. Take out is 30%

[02:41] diamonds is 70%. And our most popular dishes would be the Pat Tie, Pat See you and Drunk and Nudeless.

[02:47] And we also do bear in wine, but it's only 1% of ourselves. Dinglinglingling here. So right off

[02:52] the bat, they have beer in wine. And the fact that they have 1% of sales from arguably the highest

[02:56] margin item that they sell, there's probably more we can find out and some big opportunities there.

[03:02] How do you get customers? How do they find out about here? So we have organic page,

[03:06] it's about 50% of our business we think. They're 1,300 reviews, 4.6 stars. Google is 460 reviews.

[03:13] At 4.7 stars Instagram and Facebook. Where do mouth are customers like to spread the

[03:18] where do mouth a lot? Pay to ads, we do help $1,200 a month. We do affiliate food declarations on Instagram.

[03:24] But what of mouth is really through our server talking to our customer? And when we are at the restaurant,

[03:28] we talk to our customer. Right. And you say about half them come for this. I asked like,

[03:32] yeah, my mom was here yesterday. She said, I need to come try and they come try and they say,

[03:37] I'm going to go tell my friend to come try. That's why I think word of mouth. It's a big thing for us as well.

[03:42] I would say almost for food more than almost any other business, word of mouth is just huge.

[03:46] I really believe that the food so is self. Yeah. No, that's great. On a long enough time

[03:51] rising, the product of the business is the only thing that matters. Marketing just pulls up your

[03:57] timeline for it. It gets more people introduced to your product faster. And so marketing can

[04:01] accelerate growth, but it cannot create a good business. And so I think this is one of the big things

[04:05] that a lot of workers don't understand. And this is something that took me years to figure out,

[04:09] which is that being good at marketing sales can absolutely make you money. But it's just

[04:12] accelerates how quickly you decline. If you don't actually have a good product. But if you take

[04:16] it the other natural extreme, which is that even if you're zero marketing and one person needs,

[04:20] but it's so good they tell five people. And then those five people come and it's so good they tell five

[04:25] people. You can quickly get to capacity if the product is good. And that works for services

[04:29] and resources, or for anything. Okay. So how many customers do you help? What's the sales velocity

[04:33] of the business? average day would do 340 guests to the 3 in the weekdays and 4 to 500 on the weekends.

[04:39] Okay. So weekends are significantly bigger. When you said the average order was $80 in the week

[04:44] at $60 during the week. Is that off the same menu? Just people are ordering more.

[04:50] We only have one menu. I would think that maybe the weekday because it's a lot of our business.

[04:54] So when they come in, it's just order one plate of patella. That's $16. But doing the week and

[05:00] it's more like a family. So it's like a bigger ticket. I was holding back. So we actually have a

[05:05] few problem that we want to talk about. The first one for us is to increase the sales during a non-peak

[05:10] hour. Doing a peak hour were good. We actually had light out the door. But doing a non-peak hour,

[05:17] we would still find a way to better fill the house. We also want to improve on the take-out sales

[05:23] and also our courthouse sales. Because we are opening our second restaurant, we really want to get

[05:27] Alex help and also guidance. Because we open our first restaurant and we kind of like just roll with it.

[05:34] And it was just like, oh, it turned out great. Perfect. But now that we're thinking about scaling,

[05:39] we don't want to just roll with it anymore. The steak is higher. We're not open up with a small hole in the

[05:45] wall. We want to make it right after get going. So having Alex on board or guidance us, that's

[05:52] tremendously helpful. And then also the other reason why this is so important to me, especially

[05:57] with our like second ventures. Because I just quit my food, have a job and I am going to be committed

[06:03] and fully focused on this restaurant. So increase our cross sales increase take-out sales,

[06:08] attribution for sure. I think with this business particularly will be more difficult to do attribution

[06:12] than maybe a traditional business. That's okay. I'm not, I'm not asking certain about that.

[06:16] I'll introduce a couple of things that I think might be able to help us out. So looking at the

[06:19] problems that they presented, I think number one, we can increase sales during non-peak hours by

[06:24] actually changing pricing during peak hours. Second, how can we increase alcohol sales? Well, that's

[06:29] going to be through recruiting hiring and training staff. I would say take-out sales and attribution

[06:33] out, put it's kind of like the third priority for me going into this. We're kind of promotional offers.

[06:37] Do you run to kind of attract customers? We like to give free items to sort of giving percentages off.

[06:43] Big fan. So real quick, one of my big beliefs in business in general is not to give discounts.

[06:49] Basically, it's either full price or it's free. I'm a big fan of that, especially for food

[06:53] establishments. Like you don't want to have people who become like discount seekers. Like that's not

[06:56] good. Which I do want to be clear. I separate from, you know, if you have a prepayment discount

[07:01] for services or you have some sort of incentive for someone to buy like on a sales call or within

[07:05] 24 hours, that I see is different. Then like running a promotion that's like 20% off, not a huge

[07:10] fan of that. I'd rather give a free item and then have a clear ascension path to how I'm going

[07:14] to get that person to become a full paying customer. We especially like to do that on the big holidays,

[07:18] mothers day, Valentine's day, Christmas. So mostly seasonal. Nothing that's standing or rotating.

[07:24] Do you have a process in place right now for basically what recommendations your servers recommend?

[07:31] Number one and then number two, what things they can add on to their orders?

[07:35] No, we do not have that yet. Okay. There's going to be really big opportunity there.

[07:38] Okay, and then in terms of encouraging people to come for that second visit, is there anything that

[07:42] you do special for first time customers? I think it would just treat everyone the same.

[07:47] Uh-huh. Yeah. No, that's okay. There's, I have ideas. I have ideas. I have ideas.

[07:51] Yeah, no, we don't. We don't do anything special. No, you're good. You're totally fine. I know you want

[07:56] to increase your weekday volume. Right. What have you done or tried so far? We're thinking about doing

[08:01] a happy hour on the weekday. Okay. And you haven't done that yet. You just, it's an idea that you have.

[08:06] No, I think we're currently what we do is for the weekday and our own trip, for example,

[08:10] like the stuff right. You have to order rights on the side, but for the weekday is actually

[08:16] come as a set. Right. So your order is still fine. Let's say your order hot base, so it already

[08:20] come with the rice. Okay. So it's a search urge of rice on the weekend as other side. On the normal

[08:25] basis. Yes, except for lunch, lunch, we do that together. Okay. So tell me about this new store.

[08:31] Thank you guys for thinking about it today. Okay. Our raises in Los Zuzes. It's actually a

[08:35] little bit bigger this time. We actually have a bigger bar with bar seats. We wanted to put

[08:40] bar seats in this time to make sure that when we guess our waiting outside, sometimes up to an hour

[08:44] that we have something to sell them at the bar. And also, it's, it's a bit bigger so it's about

[08:49] 100 cedar going from a 72 cedar to 100 cedar. Yeah, it's curious about that because you don't want

[08:54] to have big things as nail it and scale it. Right. And so I know that you guys are trying to,

[08:58] I'm from obviously trying to hit 80 million. So if you're going to try and do multiple occasions,

[09:03] we have to make sure that the model is super dolled. Exactly. Yeah. So I feel like on the paper,

[09:09] it's like we're doing good. I mean, I have a plan of I would, but I know until my operation

[09:14] or their all else, if they know we can still tweak and do more. Yeah. And that is why we want to

[09:19] do this between the two concepts as a test drive. And then we'll take the winning model and

[09:24] want to work just go from there. God, well, do you want to improve this location though?

[09:27] The main location for now. Of course, yes. And what's the plan for the grand opening for the next one?

[09:33] Grand opening, we actually will not want to do until six months later. I just want to

[09:37] make sure that we have 100% operating smoothly. You mean your soft open. Yes. So we

[09:43] for sure we'll soft open, but in terms of grand opening, we haven't really put any package together

[09:48] because what thing is going to be three to six months down the line. So one of our internal

[09:52] models is nail it, then scale it. And the reason for that is that a lot of times small business owners

[09:58] will get really aggressive and really excited and want to expand faster before they really

[10:03] solidified their core model. Basically, it's like it might take you less time to get your second location,

[10:08] but it'll take you more time to get your tenth location. And so I want to make sure that this

[10:12] fundamental unit economics are right. How much does it cost to open? How quickly can you get to be

[10:16] profitable? How long does it take for that location to pay for itself entirely? What is our

[10:20] grand opening promotional look like? How do we recruit higher and staff a new place and get the

[10:24] culture to be what it needs to be? And so these are a lot of the questions that happen, especially

[10:27] in a heavy staff business like restaurants where there's a lot of people that work under one

[10:32] of staff, which meant, okay, well I have buckets and buckets of notes. So I have lots of stuff

[10:37] for you guys that I think will be able to help with. I'm going to focus primarily on this location

[10:41] and then I'll talk about the end about what we can do to hopefully set up the second location to

[10:46] succeed. Cool? Cool. And we also bring us back here for you Alex. So wait, there's more. Yeah,

[10:53] before we get into business, we get our feet ourselves right. It's customary. Yeah, I rushed into

[10:58] the business to that. We spend a lot of time thinking about what we're going to so

[11:04] Alex. Because we would have a very short year love the food right? So well he's, you know, like the

[11:09] fitness guy, he's like the trend needs. So we thought, okay, maybe meet. It's a good choice. I like

[11:13] packed with protein. So crying tiger happened to be at the seller and it's something that we

[11:18] really proud of. So that is definitely a no-brainer. The pineapple curry prawn is a little bit

[11:25] of a risk we want to take because it's not on the menu. It's something I try making at home.

[11:32] I love that. And I just want to see like if other people will like it. So he is like anific.

[11:38] Last but not least is the mango stickier. I think that is a tight staple and we just have to show

[11:44] who we are, type person and that's what we want to bring to the table. So I'm going to eat all of this

[11:49] and then we'll start. Thank you. Hmm, that's great. Okay, so what does this? River prawns.

[12:00] River prawns. I don't even know what that is. Really good. Really good. All right, I have to try this.

[12:09] All right, you will be insulted if I just don't finish everything right? Okay.

[12:13] I'm going to try this. I can see why there's doing so well. That was delicious.

[12:19] God, I was unbelievable. This is obviously everything so that was exceptional.

[12:22] Seeing Alex finished that red curry and two bites like oh yeah, we meant we might need to put

[12:26] down in the menu. That's why we do this. Feel my heart. Feel my heart.

[12:31] Oh, the river prawns were fire. Really, really good. I mean, it was obvious why the restaurants

[12:36] done well because the food is good. And this is just like the simplest thing in the entire world.

[12:41] And I use restaurants as a simple analogy because everybody gets it. It's like a lot of people

[12:44] obsess about all the marketing and all the sales hacks. At the end of the day, if you have good food,

[12:50] people will come back and tell their friends. Like that's really what it comes down to. And they

[12:54] focused on the thing that mattered most. I'm happy to help with all these kind of little things

[12:57] that can maybe improve the business model. But they had the thing that matters because if they had

[13:01] bad food, it didn't matter how many taxes I was going to give them, they were just going to

[13:04] get people in the door and they were going to leave and never come back. And so they have to become a

[13:08] little marketing business in order to stay alive because their product was inferior. They don't

[13:12] have that problem and so I'm going to stoke to see what happens. The kind of four categories

[13:16] actually I'm going to split it into five. So if you have pricing, we'll talk about number two is

[13:19] the actual menu itself. So I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions about the menu because I think

[13:22] this is going to dramatically affect average order value. Number three is going to be training.

[13:27] So this is kind of the staff stuff that we're talking about. Number four is going to be all

[13:31] call. So I'm going to split this out specifically and then five will be the next location. Okay.

[13:36] So those are going to be the big overarching topics. So what I want to do is kind of like

[13:42] other ways that we can immediately potentially increase the profit of the location without

[13:46] dramatically changing the operations. And so there's two things that we could do. One thing that you

[13:51] can do and I remember seeing this at a restaurant is that you can just add your processing fee and you

[13:55] just put that on your menu which says plus 3% processing fee for credit cards. Right? And you can do

[14:01] 2.90 to 3.9 whatever you want. And then that way when they get the bill, it'll just say processing

[14:06] fee whatever. And it doesn't usually affect anyone's take rate from what they choose to order and

[14:12] whatnot. But for you guys with a 3% increase would be like a 15% increase in profit from one thing.

[14:18] So we don't need to do that. And just like that's one consideration we can do. The second thing

[14:23] that you can do is I noticed that you were at 0.00 in terms of your pricing. Was there a reason for that

[14:29] versus doing like 16.99? I felt like the 16.99 or 16.95 thing was kind of old school. I was

[14:37] want to make it simple and clean. Well I'll briefly push back just because the where you're at price

[14:43] it was. If you were you know I would say higher end. I think you guys are upper middle. Right? You're not like

[14:49] here. Right? Yeah. I would say yes if you're serving you know $29 to $50 on Trace is the primary

[14:56] then I think having points here 0 could make sense typically with luxury brands they don't have

[15:01] 99. But I think that you're in a spot where I don't think it would detract from your brand to have

[15:05] 16.99. And the reason for this like most people make their judgment off of that character in terms of

[15:10] pricing. Right? And so this though it may seem really small. If your average ticket is $16, this is

[15:18] 6% absolute which for you guys is plus 30% in profit margin for the business. So like if you went

[15:25] from 19% currently because that's a 6% increase in total in average revenue that would take you to 25%

[15:33] margins from that which is a 30% increase in profit. So that 600 and whatever was 670,000 dollars

[15:40] in profit would be an extra 100, 200 inish 220,000 a year from one move. I don't think it's going

[15:49] to affect your sales. That's just me personally because it's like we're not even changing any of the

[15:52] characters. You're already kind of like paying the fee of being at $16. I don't think anyone

[15:57] buy 16 does buy 69. That's just my opinion. Yeah so this is a monster moment. It's like yeah one

[16:02] change that probably has no effect on your sales velocity could have a dramatic effect on your

[16:08] profitability as a business. When we're talking in 20 bucks, 10 bucks like this is a high volume

[16:13] business. Those tiny little dimes and nickels and pennies they add up in a huge way. And like

[16:19] this at the beginning restaurants are notorious for having small margins. If we can have a 30%

[16:24] lift from one tiny change in terms of replying the menu, we should do that. Let's just use simple

[16:29] math. If every person who walked into their restaurant last year only bought two items, that would

[16:35] be $2 per person. They served 100,000 customers last year. That would be $200,000 drop to the bottom line.

[16:42] I've never bought a buy okay if I just add 99 cents. How much would it cancel it into like the

[16:47] percentage of sales increase? It's just like a live boat, but it's just like pop and I want to just

[16:51] like what doing it? The next one is because you have your turning people away on weekends right?

[16:58] Yeah. Have you considered having weekend pricing? Saturdays and Sundays or Fridays and Saturdays,

[17:03] the menu that you hand them is different. So you've got weekend menus and then you've got a weekday

[17:07] menus. And so then the weekend menu can add $2 per dish. It's this search pricing fundamentally

[17:12] it's just like Uber. If it's really busy, they charge more, if it's less busy, they charge less.

[17:16] And so I'd rather you just add it on the days that you have it. And they want to feel like it's being added.

[17:21] You're just you're just giving them the weekend menu. Right? It's just like different places

[17:26] have like a lunch menu and a dinner menu that dinner menu is more expensive than a lunch menu.

[17:29] You know what's offended by that? It's just kind of a standard practice. How does that feel?

[17:34] The worst considering? Okay. But you know, be scary to do all three at the same time.

[17:40] No, no, I don't think this really should. But I wanted to particularly like this when the moment

[17:44] I've thought about it, but I think it just we never actually have that percentage breakdown

[17:48] on how much is going to increase. So what we do see like the whole picture and how we impact

[17:53] profitability. I think this one actually was 30% increase. This one definitely resonate with me the most

[17:59] and term a processing. Yeah. You can go like an order about it. This is why ladies out and

[18:04] so lot about you and how you feel at the service. Right? And so if this feels like to you,

[18:08] you're like, I think we could just, you know, we the little of the cost of this is reprinting the menu.

[18:12] That's it. Right? So check this out. So this is the 100 million dollar

[18:16] scouting roadmap and they are at stage five product size. So they've got probably 20

[18:20] age people who work for them. And if we look at the constraints of the business for them,

[18:24] let's look at the things that I'm I'm talking about them with. Most of the scouting

[18:28] roadmap, I tailor more to service based businesses and the reason for that is because 78% of

[18:33] businesses are services and so I tend to skew in my language about that. But the actual things that

[18:37] are happening are the same. Right? And so a CS playbook, to onward, all of that is going to be around

[18:43] how are we getting customers this consistent experience we talk heavily about training, right?

[18:47] Connecting CS to product, that's getting feedback loops based on the what people are eating

[18:51] and what they want like spinning that makes something new to sell them. I mean, they functionally

[18:55] hot alcohol but they weren't selling it. So now we're pushing that a little bit stronger. And from a

[19:00] finance perspective, like we need to get better their finances, which is why a lot of the

[19:05] improvements that I had were very pricing centric, probably because they didn't have good enough

[19:09] financials to be able to see, oh wow, when we sell this product, we're almost breaking even,

[19:15] but when we sell these ones we make a ton. They didn't have that kind of information, which would have

[19:19] helped them reconfigure their menu to be the most profitable menu possible that also brings customers back.

[19:25] And if you're like, man, that would be useful to know what stage of scaling I'm at. All I

[19:29] have to do is go to act as a.com, force-road map, put in your business information, and we have

[19:33] this little automated thingy that'll tell you what stage you're at, what problems you're facing,

[19:37] and most importantly, how to solve them. And if you want my team to take a look at the business

[19:41] and you know, reaffirm those things, you'd like to come out, so I had to quote us in Vegas,

[19:45] and potentially be on the cash cash out on the Thakey page you can schedule a call and we love to

[19:49] help you out. So the next thing that we'll go over is the actual menu itself. So with the menu,

[19:57] how do you think about laying out what they get when they open up the menu at your establishment?

[20:03] The way I thought of the design of the menu is the way the customers think when they sit down.

[20:07] Sure, okay. Which is what we're a drink, what an appetizer, and then afterwards focus on the big piece.

[20:13] Yep. And then the small complimenting piece to go with it. So I would like drinks, appetizers,

[20:17] specials, like the big entree and then carbs at the end. Okay. So on the menu, do you have highlighted

[20:25] boxes for the key items? I think we have a section for the specials, yes. And then the special

[20:31] section for our dessert, believe. Yes, we have special, special section highlighted. Yeah.

[20:37] We are working on an updated menu right now and what we did is like when we laid it out,

[20:41] let's say, fine, right? We will highlight what we want to sell. Yeah. Yeah. So there's two components

[20:46] to it. So let's say you've got your sides, you've got your your appetizers, you got your carbs,

[20:49] whatever. Within each of those boxes, number one is I would rate, I would rank them from gross profit,

[20:55] top to bottom. So which of these is the most profitable? We'll put that first because that's the first

[20:58] thing people are going to consider. And then the second thing is I would have your highlight box,

[21:02] which is the, and I put it the bottom and he like, if this is your first time visiting,

[21:06] this is the one you can't miss, right? That way, it's like that way people, because no one wants to

[21:09] make the decisions. It's fun. I'm going to let what's good, right? Exactly. So that way, if you have each

[21:14] of the highest gross profit margin, things that also happen to be the things that most people love,

[21:18] and those should be the same ideally. That we want to make sure that it's really clear and it's

[21:23] prominent on the menu per box that they're kind of working through. So any kind of business that

[21:28] has a menu, and the term having a menu comes from restaurants because many people have eaten it restaurants,

[21:33] but you go to a mechanic shop, there's a menu, right? And so in general, I like having a couple

[21:38] things to be true about my menus. One is that I prefer to start at the highest prices, and the

[21:42] reason for that is because it's anchors, and they've done research studies on this in terms of how

[21:46] they lay out like wine menus. If you put the most expensive on the top, it anchors the remaining

[21:50] prices underneath of it. And so number one, I like having higher prices higher. Number two, I like

[21:54] higher gross profit margins because two things could be $16, but one of them might cost the restaurant,

[21:59] $6, one of them might cost them $1. Remember, that 99 cents that we added added 30% to the profit of

[22:05] the business if executed, no sales will also drop. And so us having just getting more people to buy

[22:11] a thing that has two or three more dollars of profit could make an enormous difference to this business.

[22:15] The third piece that I would hit on is what's the stuff that that brings people back? Like what's

[22:19] the stuff that's so good that they're like, God, I have this again. And so balancing those three

[22:23] priorities is how I think through laying out a menu where there's a services business or it's a restaurant.

[22:28] So the next thing that I have for you, this is just menu. We're going to get into training stuff

[22:31] in a second with like, how do we increase alcohol sales and things like that? But what I want to do is

[22:35] increase the likelihood that people are already thinking about it, right? And so there's two things that

[22:40] I want to think about. Number one is, with each of the dishes, you could put underneath of it

[22:46] pairs well with. What drink this would go well with? And if they're reading it, they're going to be

[22:51] thinking, oh, well, they're saying it goes well with this. You will get more than 1% of people to buy

[22:55] alcohol just from just adding to what they're doing. And it just looks at the menus. Yes.

[22:59] Yeah, I love that idea. Yeah, and this is all profit, right? Yeah.

[23:02] pairs with. Do you, that makes sense? Okay. So this may be a wink wink from my next book that's coming out.

[23:08] But there are a number of ways that you can make a customer more valuable. There are eight of them.

[23:12] One of them is a cross cell, which is, do you want fries with that for them? It's going to be

[23:16] do you want an alcohol I've ever talked with that? And so what I want to do is make it as

[23:20] easiest possible for the customer to say yes. And I want to make it as easiest possible for the

[23:25] staff to not forget. And so both of the tactics that I'm going to lay out for them are going to

[23:29] mirror those things. How to make it easier for the customer, remind them to do this thing. And the thing

[23:33] is they're getting 1% of their sales from alcohol, which is super high margin, right? So if we can

[23:38] get that from like 1% to 6%. So just adding 5% to the business in terms of total revenue from

[23:43] this very high gross profit product line, then again, we have another 25% increase in profit. And that's

[23:49] just going from 1 to 6%. If you flip the table from no one's getting an alcoholic beverage to every

[23:54] person buys one, the profit of that table jumps through the roof. And so we only need like 1 out of 10

[23:59] tables to do that. We always thought that the alcohol should be better than it is. And that would be a

[24:04] huge opportunity if we could improve it. And I mean, we see industry standards being like 5% to 15%

[24:10] maybe even 20 right? And we're at less than 1. So that's a really big week plate right there.

[24:16] You have specials in terms of drinks? No. Okay. So I would recommend having one special that's a drink.

[24:22] So just say like hey, we also just freshly made a tie, mint, my type, whatever, you know, whatever

[24:29] cocktail you want. It's made fresh year on staff. It's super refreshing for the summer or whatever

[24:34] make it seasonal for whatever time it is. And that way, some people were coming back.

[24:38] I was like, oh, that sounds good. Like all we want is like that sounds good. And then it's like

[24:42] great. We have the purchase. So I would include that as the first thing. So basically, there's

[24:46] have hey, before we get into drinks, kind of say the drinks special, we make one every week. And we

[24:50] spend a lot of time. We taste tested a bunch in the back and we come up with the best one. And it's

[24:54] freshly made here, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I think people would really like that. So rotating

[24:59] one drink, special. Or yeah. So tell me about the actual table top. Do you have anything on the

[25:05] table at all? Do you have like one of those little a frames or one of those spread open? You know what I'm

[25:10] talking about like where did you just... Yeah, you don't do that. Okay. Okay. Is that too

[25:14] below where you want to be in terms of vibe of the dining? I'm more capable of putting it. Okay.

[25:20] Especially if it's like, you know, a special. Yeah, yeah, like I'm thinking of it. Yeah. So I would

[25:25] probably do that because people like the visual. So I probably... So it's like there's a difference right

[25:29] now, or customers sit down with being our menu. So we have like a menu and like a special menu.

[25:33] So the special menu, how like all the picture and a recommendation, a menu is just, you know,

[25:38] like the list of item with ingredients, but it's not left on the table. So when you're saying like having

[25:44] like a little kind of like a placement or yes, kind of like there in their face, like,

[25:49] because also I'm thinking about the servers, right? Like how can we help them do their job easier?

[25:54] And so if they can just plain and then the visuals right there and they can see it,

[25:58] I think that's pretty compelling. And I think the way that you make that look is what

[26:02] old determine whether it looks cheap or whether it looks nice. I would say I would go lots of

[26:06] neon colors with the tropical background. I like that would probably not be the right. So you know,

[26:10] keep the the look and feel of it upscale, but we still want to have the really nice elegant

[26:14] descriptor underneath of, you know, once a week the entire team tries, you know, five different

[26:18] drinks, we pick the best one. And then that's what we decide as a team to offer for the week.

[26:22] Because if you can get the team bought it on it, they're like, oh my god, I was so good.

[26:25] Yeah, like you guys should try it. At first we were like, yeah, we don't, should we do it?

[26:30] Should we not do it? Don't we don't want to be like kind of like a fast food joint? That's

[26:35] why that's deter us. But then the fact that he said, what was different, you can decide in a way that

[26:40] is nice, presentable and high class, like, yes, we can do it. How come I don't think about that before?

[26:47] We really are doing something very similar. We have like wine or specials menu that we

[26:52] give out with the menus, but the table tint is stays on the table. So no one's ever going to

[26:57] forget this. Always there. Are you talking about like maybe just one item, special one item? Or

[27:02] is it like maybe like a few item on the me personally? Just one. I want to call an adryte. Yeah,

[27:08] exactly. For me, this is me as a consumer now talking. When I see like 10 things, it just is like

[27:12] another menu. Yeah. Right. I want to draw attention to one specific thing, really clear image,

[27:17] you know, the benefit is underneath and then they draw my attention to it and to meet that's

[27:21] really good. Now the back of it, we're going to save for some review stuff. So I'll get to that

[27:25] in a second. On table one item, special. Okay. We get on this so far. All right. Okay.

[27:35] So let's talk about getting people to come back. Right. So we want to have a wave to identify

[27:40] who the new customers are. Like, it has your first time dining with us, right? Is there something

[27:44] that we can do to identify to everybody else that like if someone says yes to that, can we put like

[27:49] just a drink coaster on their table that's a certain color or an apping that's a certain color,

[27:55] whatever. But the reason it's so important is because then the whole staff know is, hey, these are

[27:58] first timers. Right. And so obviously you want to give everyone a great experience. But just knowing

[28:03] it's someone's first time helps. Yeah. Right. And so one is identify first timers and be,

[28:11] I would give them some sort of surprise free thing at the end since it's their first time. So

[28:18] that's if they have a dessert or something like that, whatever that, whatever the two

[28:21] producers do. Yeah. Something that would be, but people remember things something called peak end

[28:26] bias. And so people remember things two key moments of every experience. They remember the peak

[28:30] emotional experience and they remember how things fended. Yeah. And so if we can just really make that

[28:36] ending really nice, I think that would be something like surprise dessert for first timers. And what I

[28:45] would want to do is then give coupon of some sort. And the way that you can do this

[28:49] you want to do it classy is that you have the manager put their art and then write free dessert

[28:56] on the back and then hand it to them. Okay. It's way better than a coupon, right? Because then it

[29:01] feels like it's a personalized gift. Right. And so you say, hey, next time you come in, just bring this

[29:07] and I'll have another dessert for you in the house. And so now it's like we're creating that loop.

[29:11] We want to bring them back in. Does that make sense? Does that feel okay? Yeah. All right.

[29:16] So these are, this is for first time. Okay. For existing customers, I think you can offer the free

[29:21] dessert in exchange for reviews. Now I know you guys do something like that now, correct?

[29:25] We have some time. Yeah, we can't tell it. We've done it before. I'm a huge fan of free drink

[29:30] slash free dessert for review. And the time that I found it to be most effective is really at point

[29:38] of sale. So basically when they get the check, now I have a couple ways of doing it. So I want

[29:43] you to tell me which one feels just kind of like I said the pricing thing earlier. I'm going to give you

[29:46] two or three different ways to do it on this and you tell me the one that feels better for you. Okay.

[29:50] So the first way is, hey, if you guys want, I can take care of one of the drinks. If you're just

[29:55] willing to leave a review, it would mean the world does for a small family of business. And if they do that,

[30:00] then you say, cool, let me take the check back. I'll take it off and I'll come back with it.

[30:04] And so then it's like great, every one of these and it's at the point of sale. So you want to give the

[30:08] discount now. The whole idea of like, your next, if you leave a review, next time you'll get, it's like no one cares.

[30:12] Right? That's the first pay and no one cares. So it's like it has to be immediate. That's the, that's

[30:17] the first version. So free for review is thing one. Okay. That's the first version. The second version of this

[30:25] is when the check gets delivered, the manager comes after when it's sitting there, whatever before it,

[30:32] it gets scooped up and says, hey, by the way, you know, your server's name was Judy. And just,

[30:39] you know, Judy gets a small bonus if she gets over, you know, 10, 10, 5 star reviews in a month.

[30:45] That way, it's like, we're doing it for Judy. Not doing it. So then you don't have to give anything

[30:49] away for free. But then you kind of just have the reciprocity of Judy did a good job. You know,

[30:54] you can give her a $50, you know, thing. So this is the manager ask.

[30:58] Those are probably my two favorite ways of doing it. So either the immediate one in exchange or something,

[31:05] or hey, can you do it because of my, because of the staff that you like? Right.

[31:09] Either one of those feel better to you? The first one. You like the first better? Okay.

[31:13] That's what we kind of do from time to time, but when a consistent. Yeah. So that will get into training,

[31:18] which we'll get into in a second. But because of the business that you're in more than anything else,

[31:22] it's so reviews driven like online reviews. You know, if you secure reviews from, you know,

[31:27] 1,300 reviews to 1,000 reviews, the amount of, you know, people that are coming through the door. And like,

[31:32] all we have to do is you serve 100,000 people this last year at all. Just last year. Yeah. So if we got

[31:36] 10% of people to leave review, it would, I mean, it would change things for the business. It would be

[31:40] good. And so we do we think, and it's, and it's, and it's, is you have multiple people at the table.

[31:43] Yeah. And so where this gets kind of interesting, you're me out, is that you could say,

[31:48] hey, if you each leave review, then I can get all your drinks. And in one tail, we can get five reviews.

[31:54] And so, mind you, you don't have to do this forever. It's just, and this is obviously you

[31:58] think about the next location to do. Would I be willing to give up the cost of a drink in order

[32:03] to get a review for sure, not even, wouldn't even think about it. Right. And so, right. And so that's,

[32:08] that's, that's, you're willing to make the trade and the thing is it's because it's on the check right now.

[32:12] They're like, sure, I like this place. This was great. I'll say five bucks, whatever. I would

[32:16] I would have done it for free, except they wouldn't. But, right, but I like that little incentive

[32:20] helps out. So for brick and mortar services or restaurants, just local mainstream businesses,

[32:26] the vast majority of people make their decisions by searching online before they go. I mean,

[32:30] when you're about to go to restaurant, what do you look at? You just look on y'all, you look on

[32:34] grub hub, whatever, and then you see the reviews. And so, I don't know about you. If I'm like looking

[32:38] at a dessert place, and it's got three and a half stars, I'm not going. I'm not going to go.

[32:42] I'll just go to one that has four and a half stars. Like, why would I risk it? People only go

[32:46] out certain amount of times for a month, and they're not going to blow their one time out on a

[32:50] three and a half star place. They're just not going to do it. And so, we need to boost the hell out of that,

[32:54] so that not only do we have good reviews, but we have a ton of them. And so, let me give you a

[32:58] different example. So, let's say that you've got one place that has 55 star reviews, and it's a 5.0.

[33:04] And there's another restaurant that's 13,000 and it's a 4.7. Where you go? 4.7, 13,000,

[33:10] no question, because you know this is a business. Like, 13,000 reviews are like, holy

[33:13] cal, like this place must, this is probably iconic. This is probably a destination, which if you're

[33:19] a small business owner, what higher praise could you want? So, when I read the review, it's really

[33:25] it's give us just not comfort, but also encouragement. And if I feel a bit, I am sure anyone who

[33:32] come on a yelp page read that review will feel the same way. So, to me, that it's important,

[33:37] is how we communicate with our guests. I was thinking about a way to increase the average order value.

[33:42] Right? And so, in the commerce world, it's like you get free gifts over a certain amount of spend,

[33:45] or you're free shipping. I'm trying to think of a way that we could tastefully do that within this

[33:49] business, which is like, it probably better for takeout than I think in dining, which is like at

[33:54] $50 at $100 and $100, wherever you know, if the vast majority sits at $60, right? $60,

[33:59] whatever it is. It's like, then we want to put the free gift at like 75 or 80. And so, maybe on

[34:04] weekends you make it $100 on the weekdays you make it 80. So, you just push that extra $20. It's like,

[34:08] hey, just see you know, you get an extra full, whatever I just had. For orders over 80 dollars.

[34:16] And I think that will nudge at decent amount of people. Just put it right above where they're

[34:19] currently at. And it's like you get a full-knother order of top. And you guys have good gross margins on

[34:24] the food. Because I just want to just want to bump it up. And you saw with the 99 cent thing,

[34:29] a dollar or two in this business makes all the difference in the world. And so, this is

[34:34] basically an AOV, so average order value, increase with break points above current average

[34:42] threshold. And for this particular one, you foresee a doing as part of a business going forward

[34:49] or is it supposed to be kind of like tied to special event or like certain time of that year?

[34:55] So, the reason I said take out is because if you're on the phone or something like that or if it's

[34:59] on an order page online, it doesn't feel weird to me. Like, because we have to think about the

[35:04] obviously the servers, right? They can only remember so many things. Yeah, it is. Actually, I

[35:08] love so information today. Oh, sure, yeah, because, but, because what we're going to think about this

[35:13] is from the, from the experience of the guest, right? So, they're going to come in, are you new?

[35:16] Yes, great. Cool. So, they know if they're new or not. Yeah. Then they're going to say, you know,

[35:21] kind of say about the drink special, yes, then they walk them through the drink special. And then we

[35:24] get way more people to do it. People are also going to ask questions because it says that

[35:27] pairs well with. You're right. Right? So, a lot of people are asking questions about that and then

[35:30] you're going to get more upsells, which they're going to walk because they're tips are going to go.

[35:34] So, they're going to want to sell the app. Yeah. Right. So, they even incentive to learn that stuff.

[35:37] And then basically, from that point, there's really nothing different except at the very end,

[35:41] they're going to do this. So, there's not a huge amount that we're really, we just have to know,

[35:44] are they for some customer? Mm-hmm. We're going to make sure we do the drink special. Mm-hmm.

[35:49] And then at the end, we're doing those three things. Yep. That's it. So, as much, I know we talked

[35:54] about a lot, but in terms of what they have to do, it's not too much. We just don't do that.

[35:57] Yeah. We were worried about adding more work to our worker, right? But then the way that Alex

[36:02] chose us today is not adding more work is just adding pure profit. So, simple solution.

[36:08] Simple solution. And we were complicating the whole thing and not able to get past our own bath.

[36:13] So, one out of three strategies actually succeed in a business. And that's a McKinsey study that they did.

[36:18] And some businesses have two out of three strategies succeed. And the big difference is culture,

[36:22] which is the reward and punishment that exists within a business, which is fundamentally like how

[36:26] do people behave? How do people do stuff? And so, this is a people-heavy business. And so, I wanted to

[36:32] not just give them a bunch of, you know, here's all the stuff that you can do. But I wanted to translate

[36:36] that into real-world. How are you going to get your staff to do it, right? Because if they don't

[36:41] ask people what beverage they want or ask them if they want to get dessert, very simple lines,

[36:46] but if they don't do it, it's a huge cost to the business. And so, we had to make sure that they

[36:51] would went home with clear items of like, this is how I'm going to train the staff and make sure

[36:55] that they do this every time. Otherwise, this is just a lot of fun entertainment, but nothing's

[36:59] going to happen to the business. You think we could change this coupon card to sign up for a low-to-po

[37:04] Grammy if you're a free-mangesteguration and exposition? Well, but you said you like the physical card.

[37:08] I like the physical card a ton. And if you're like, hey, if you're worried about losing this,

[37:13] just take a picture of it and just show it to me on your phone when you come back. That way that

[37:17] people can bring it, but what if they sure it and people who came got the picture of the back of the

[37:23] card? So they brought new customers in. Oh no. Right, so it's okay. So you can have and take the

[37:30] picture of it and be like, hey, if you feel like you're going to wash your jeans and it's going to

[37:34] get, you know, it's torn to shreds, you can take a picture of it too, and that would have it.

[37:38] It's a little thing. The only reason I hesitate with the loyalty thing is just like,

[37:42] how many people are actually part of the loyalty programs for restaurants?

[37:45] Restaurants, I'm not sure about cafes, it's normal. Yeah, no, so they have like the punch card and they

[37:49] have all that stuff. Because you said you wanted to be more on the upscale side, I have a whole

[37:54] thing on loyalty programs. I didn't get into it because I didn't know, I didn't feel like it was necessarily

[37:59] the best feel. I can talk about it and then you guys can decide. So any of you guys right now you do

[38:04] three, if they on their third one, they get, they get free-sticky rice. Right, when they come back,

[38:09] they do a little bit. On their birthday, they get free-sticky rice. Yeah. Probably every two

[38:12] hundred spend they get a free-tighty, but we can bought that out of people. So I think you'd have

[38:17] to sell me on the benefit of the loyalty program. I probably would even, I just hate that.

[38:23] Like, I think of what I think loyalty program is someone who's just going to spam text me all the

[38:26] time. And so I never liked it. Right, and so for me, the loyalty program would be like,

[38:32] you get three things. Is that on your birthdays? We're going to send you free stuff.

[38:36] We're just going to give you a coupon for coming in. When you're here, you get your first

[38:39] alcoholic drinks free or something like that. You know, because if it's one of the test ones,

[38:42] it's supposed to look like they have a second, right? One for table or per party. And then number three,

[38:48] when we have a wade, which you do on weekends, we prioritize you. Right. Now for me, that third one

[38:53] alone would be enough. So I like that. I mean, I think a lot of people would do it for that,

[38:58] for that benefit alone. So I'll put F, I'll let you guys work the specific details of what you

[39:04] want in there. Because also when they fill it out, you can also get what their lead source was.

[39:08] Like, how'd you hear about us? So big picture. I am split on loyalty programs in general.

[39:13] Main reason the food is the loyalty program. Your foods get, they're going to come back.

[39:16] Right. They're going to tell their friends. And so other businesses, I think loyalty programs

[39:19] can make a much bigger difference. Like if you have a men's box, something like loyalty

[39:22] program is like the business, right? But for them, I was just thinking through, okay, well, if

[39:27] this clearly meant a lot to them, because they brought it up a couple times. And so I wanted to

[39:31] give them something. If I were to do it, this is how I'd approach it. And these are just based on

[39:35] things that I've seen work across industry. So running starts, which is where you have,

[39:40] let's say you have 10 punches. If you give people two or three punches on their first go,

[39:43] they're like, they feel like they got free stuff. But it's really like you just make the amount of

[39:47] punches that you need to do free and you just give them that start ahead of time. They've already

[39:50] proven this from a bunch of studies that running starts are like two or three times more likely to

[39:55] actually finish out their punches. Then people who had the same amount of punches remaining

[40:01] on a shorter punch card. And so it's like, well, if you're going to do it, do that, obviously.

[40:06] But beyond that, I think through the same value drivers that I mentioned in the offers book

[40:11] over and over and over again. So this is page 56 of the offers book, check this out. So whenever I'm

[40:18] trying to improve any product or service, I always think through the same value vectors, which is,

[40:23] what I want to have happen, how do I make it less risky? How do I make it faster? How do I make it

[40:30] those are the value vectors? And so I'm thinking it's a restaurant. How do I make it faster?

[40:34] And as soon as I was thinking through it, I was like, okay, well, you know, trying to say that they're

[40:37] going to get their food first when they walk in the door. That's probably not going to be realistic.

[40:42] Like the cook takes certain amount of time. And some people don't want to be rushed to dinner. It's like

[40:45] in that instance, speeds probably not the right variable, right? But waiting in line and being

[40:50] what I have first access, okay, when we can make that part faster, given the fact that they already

[40:54] have more demand. So I'm like, okay, well, that's a good one. The decreasing the perceived

[40:59] likely the risk factor, that's what all the reviews are for, right? You know, how do we, you know,

[41:03] decrease effort and sacrifice? Well, we're going to make it really easy for them to buy the

[41:07] alcohol because it's going to be right in front of them. And we're going to pair it with the food

[41:10] that we think would pair best with those specific drinks. So they don't have to think, I'm not sure,

[41:14] like, again, the friction. I'm not sure which beverage debt boom, it's already solved, right? I'm just

[41:19] trying to remove friction from a lot of the parts of the process. And if someone's willing to pay more,

[41:23] or get some sort of benefit for giving us their information, then we'll happily pass those things

[41:27] on as a reason to do it. Good on this? Yeah. Don't worry, I think it's a little more safe to say.

[41:33] You'll have. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, so now we're talking about, we're going to talk

[41:39] about team and operations. Okay, so this is the training. What we really need to train them on is

[41:45] kind of the upsell process. Number one, they have the greeting. And so when I think about training

[41:50] people, you want to think about it as almost like skits. Because whenever you teach something

[41:53] you have a condition, give something that happens and they never be here. So when this, then that,

[41:57] right? So it's a rule if this happens, then you do this. And so each of these are basically behavior rules.

[42:02] And so it's like we're only going to teach you four rules. And the first one is that when someone comes

[42:06] in, you ask if it's their first time. If they say yes, you take this thing out of your pocket,

[42:10] you put it on the table. Now everybody has. That's thing one. Let's practice. You sit down

[42:15] on the table and you go back and forth and the next person comes up and you drill it with them.

[42:18] Next person goes up. You drill it with them and you just keep going through, do it for an hour.

[42:22] They'll have 20 reps in an hour of just doing skit one. Tomorrow we'll do skit two. And that training

[42:29] just gets so ingrained. If you do that on a regular basis for them, I'm sure before the shift starts,

[42:32] they have a 30 minute little powwow or 20 minute powwow, you just do this. And so you have the

[42:37] greeting for first time customers. The second is going to be the beverage, which is we're going to be

[42:42] practicing getting the alcohol upsell. So let me tell you about our one beverage of the week. So

[42:48] in the back, we try out every week, we get together and we try out five different cocktails. And the

[42:52] one that we say is our favorite is what we make for the week. And so it's made fresh home here. We

[42:57] did it just a couple hours ago. It's freshly squeezed mint, bubblewaw, and a lot of people love it.

[43:01] Would you like one of those? That's it. That's all we do. And then the next person goes up and you say,

[43:06] do it again. So you want them to get five 10 repetitions per practice session. And so it's

[43:12] that we can hold them accountable. Because if you do this on a regular basis, they'll do it.

[43:15] Then we have the pairings, which is when people are ordering their mains, just reminding them that

[43:21] that that goes really well with. Would you like a lot of people like it with and just doing that

[43:26] little reminder? So it's going to be size, plus alcohol. So with everyone of these dishes, I mean,

[43:32] there's a reason McDonald says, do you want to fry so that? Do you want to supercise your meal?

[43:36] Do you like each one of it? Like it's two, two three questions after every time somebody says they want

[43:41] this thing. So yes, I want the pad tie. Awesome. Do you want to have extra noodles on the side?

[43:45] A lot of people do. No? Okay. It pairs really well with this. Do you want to go ahead and take one of those?

[43:52] And even the way I'm saying it, like, do you want to go ahead and take one of those?

[43:55] I'm telling them to say yes by how I'm asking the question. A lot of people do that. You want to go ahead

[43:59] and do one of those? They're like, okay, you know, I'll do it. And so we just want to practice that.

[44:04] So the the practice piece would be, I order. And then you ask me question one question two.

[44:10] An experienced sales personal know those tiny little nudges and in a rapid sales conversation,

[44:16] which is what a waiter or a ratress has to have. Let's say if a table of five people,

[44:21] you're going to have five sales interactions. And so we're talking like one sentence or one phrase

[44:26] that we're adding on per kind of exchange back and forth. And so we just have to get the team to practice

[44:31] those little nudges, which is like, would you rather have chocolate or vanilla? I like chocolate,

[44:35] right, or most people like chocolate, or that's what a lot of people do here. And this matters more

[44:38] especially with first time customers because they're like, I don't know how it works here. And so

[44:43] then you're like, well, this is how it works is what most people do. This is this is what gets maximizes

[44:47] your experience while you're here at this restaurant. And so what we're doing functionally from a value

[44:51] perspective is we're paying down risk. We're increasing the perceived life of achievement. We're

[44:55] saying, you want to have this amazing experience. I'm going to help you have the best experience by just

[44:58] helping you navigate this man-un ordering process to get the best stuff. And I'm incentivizing

[45:04] that because I want you to have a good experience with you to do it. For every alcoholic beverage,

[45:08] what would you charge for the drinks right now? It's pretty affordable. I think we're at like

[45:11] six or seven else dollars. So they're going to get about a dollar at it. So it's like when you're looking

[45:17] at the table, just think every question you ask you have a dollar to say and you have five people

[45:22] that table and you've got two dollars in each one of them. Just right there. Yeah. And so okay,

[45:26] you get three of them. Great. You just got three dollars from just taking orders. I would translate

[45:31] into what it means for them. Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. From a team perspective, I would put a

[45:36] little little leaderboard in the back for the server that had the got the most alcoholic beverage

[45:42] sales and then you can give them 50 bucks or 100 bucks whatever. Or maybe they just get priority to pick

[45:46] what schedule they want for the next month. Okay. Just little things like that. I think work really,

[45:51] really well. So the last step is review slash comeback offer. So if it's a first time customer,

[45:58] they're going to get the comeback offer. If it's any other customer, it's going to be the review offer.

[46:03] slash loyalty. If you want to, if you want to do your little to offer. And now that's why we set this up

[46:07] so that we can do this. And if they forget, they can look down at the table on a remote window.

[46:13] That's why we do this. Right. We can, this is how we make a little system out of that. Yeah.

[46:16] Yeah. So that makes sense. We do like they can do this. Yes. Yes. I want to do it.

[46:20] So I think if we just do these things that we just outlined, there's a lot of points, but not

[46:24] I think it's doable. It's kind of my point. Right. Like we just kind of went through almost most of the

[46:29] things that they have to handle. The rest of it is menu, you know, moving the menu stuff around,

[46:33] adding the 99 to the price, like very small things. They could be big differences to the business.

[46:37] So the last thing we'll do is I'll cover the next location and then we'll wrap it up as one

[46:42] list and we'll prioritize it. Cool. Cool. Yeah. Okay. I think when you do your pre-opening,

[46:46] what I would do is I would do an influencer night. Okay. And so you make it a VIP event. They can

[46:52] videotape it and they could share it to their stories and that you can give them the promotional offer

[46:57] of the free dessert or the free sticky rice or free drink, whatever that you could trace back to them.

[47:03] And I think that would be a great first launch and then you can also use all of their creative.

[47:08] That's the deal for getting the VIP experience. So it's like you get all these influencers and they

[47:13] make these little videos about your restaurant and then you can basically run an ad after the fact

[47:19] and people recognize them because they're influencers, but they're talking about your restaurant.

[47:23] All right. So check this out. So what I'm talking about is affiliates and partners. All right.

[47:27] And so the big key here is an affiliate is a lead getter. They're an independent business that

[47:31] tells their audience to buy your stuff. And so if we're going to have a full night, right? We don't

[47:36] just want any kind of customer in the door. We want customers that can bring us boat loads of customers.

[47:41] Like their normal business is while customer tells two or three people and then those people come in.

[47:45] But the value of an influencer or somebody who's a local celebrity or local influencer who

[47:50] runs a forum or whatever it is locally or there's just another local business owner that has

[47:54] exposure to many other people who are walking in their shop, their auto shop every single day,

[47:58] then you invite them out and they can then tell a hundred people in your behalf. And so it's

[48:03] simply that it just gives you a lot more leverage and you're willing to make a little bit of a trade.

[48:06] And so you might do it for free or you might do it at cost, might give them half off because it's

[48:10] pre-opening and exchange for them, you know, videotaping, intermaking, and post or something like that.

[48:15] Those types of things are great ways to kind of launch the word of mouth from the people who have

[48:19] the biggest megafaats. So number one thing we're going to do is we're going to do plus 99 on

[48:24] entrants. Number two is we're going to reorder menu in order of profit.

[48:31] Three, we're going to add pairings, alcohol with entrants. Okay, number four,

[48:39] drink special with table top pick. All right. So we're going to do first timers,

[48:45] training, which is amp gain plus a comeback offer. And then for returning customers, we're going to do

[48:55] manager card for VIP treatment. And then seven, you're going to have daily training on five scenarios.

[49:09] Doable? Okay. So let me show you how this actually adds up though. So if we see no change in sales just by adding

[49:17] the 99 cents, we get plus 30% to profit from this. Now reordering the menu could actually have a

[49:24] really dramatic effect because if we just got a higher percentage of people to just buy the things

[49:28] that have the highest margin, that can have a really big effect on the bottom line. Because they're buying

[49:33] the stuff that it costs the least, right? That has the most markup. And so this I would estimate might

[49:38] be somewhere in the neighborhood of like 10 to 20%. If this succeeds, this one I feel really good about.

[49:44] This obviously is going to be huge for you. I mean, this could be somewhere in the neighborhood like

[49:48] 40% plus increases. Like this is really big, both of these together. First time we're training,

[49:54] I think this is going to be more important for the second location because you need to you're already

[49:58] already at relatively full right now. So getting people to come back, I think is going to be really

[50:03] important for the for the second location. But this might also have with some of the weekday.

[50:08] Because if you just get more people to come back, especially if they come during the weekdays,

[50:12] then those of them as we were to the one in set of ice because it's like, well, come back again during

[50:15] two days. Right? So this might be some, I would probably estimate this might give you like it. And again,

[50:20] 10 doesn't sound like a lot, but it's 304,000 year. Yeah. You know what I mean, giving you a

[50:24] revenue. So it's not, it's not nothing. Right? Manager card, this is going to be reviews. You know,

[50:29] I would bet this is probably a 20% left somewhere in that neighborhood. And then this is just going to be

[50:34] overall the execution. But these are the three that I think will really move the needle the most,

[50:41] and you don't have to do a lot to implement them. Yeah. I can do it over the weekend and perfectly

[50:46] done. That's my favorite kind of implementation. Yeah, fast and easy. Yeah, yeah.

[50:51] Slow and hard. Oh, no, this is easy. I can't just kind of get out tonight and bring it out tomorrow.

[50:55] Good. How do you feel about this whole plan? Great. Do you know what? And it's going to make a big difference?

[51:00] Yeah. Great. Great. Okay. Well, you know, we have to do now. We have to hug and then have to finish

[51:05] your food. I know I thought I would do something like this. Super nervous when he's like,

[51:11] are you going to go on the filming? I'm like, no, not doing it. Scared to that. But I'm glad that I

[51:17] actually get out of that. My set has changed to do it because I found our lots of not just a

[51:24] helpful tip, but also I felt like I received support and guidance, which is really important. And

[51:30] I'm so glad that I made decision to be here. Really happy to be here. Made me feel a lot more

[51:35] comfortable with learning how to scale better and trying to do it the right way the first time.

[51:39] So Calvin and Eric seem like amazing people incredibly humble, very hard working. I love the

[51:44] immigrant story obviously. And it seems like they actually have a very good restaurant. And so I'm

[51:48] very excited to see that implement some of these changes and potentially dramatically

[51:52] enhance the profitability of the business to hopefully sit up their expansion strategy so that they

[51:57] can go on and dominate in the entire world can have lots of amazing time food.

[52:01] And speaking of alcohol stuff since that's what this restaurant was all about,

[52:05] we actually have a bar consultant that we had a B2B business in services that we did a full

[52:09] breakdown on. So if you like this, you'll love that.

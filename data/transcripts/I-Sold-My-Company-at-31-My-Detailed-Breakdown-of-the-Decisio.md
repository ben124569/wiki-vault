[00:00] We're all one decision away from massively changing the direction of our lives.

[00:03] We can take one drink and get into our car.

[00:05] We can sleep with someone that we shouldn't have in a store in marriage.

[00:08] Or we can put a job where we can sell a company.

[00:11] And so one of the things that's always been interesting to me is that billionaires,

[00:14] millionaires, 100,000aires, people who have zero dollars, people who are in a massive debt.

[00:20] The only real thing that distinguishes these people is the quality of their decisions.

[00:24] And so what I wanted to do in this video is walk you through a decision process that I went through

[00:29] and selling the majority of stakes of three companies for over $50 million last year.

[00:33] And my name is Oxmozy.

[00:35] And so I make this stuff because I want to document the journey mentally for me

[00:40] because I think I'm going to forget the details of these things as I age and what I was thinking

[00:44] and the different pieces of it.

[00:46] And so I made this little presentation based on notes.

[00:49] I actually took really extensive notes throughout this entire process of what I was thinking through.

[00:53] You know, different variables I was considering because this is not an instant decision.

[00:57] The whole process for me actually took almost 18 months and a lot of deliberation and a lot of

[01:02] back and forth.

[01:03] All right.

[01:04] And so that's what I'm going to kind of focus on in this video.

[01:05] So to sell our notes to sell.

[01:07] So there were seven variables that I looked at.

[01:09] One was kind of the story externally and internally.

[01:11] The second was money and finances.

[01:13] You know, for me personally, third was kind of energy and headspace.

[01:16] The fourth was team resources in terms of like what am I going to lose?

[01:19] I'm going to gain number five is the future and the vision for myself.

[01:22] Number six was what was the best decision for the business?

[01:24] And then number seven, I'll loop around and tell you what I ultimately ended up

[01:27] doing and why.

[01:28] Probably more importantly why.

[01:30] All right.

[01:31] So my name is Dr. Mosey.

[01:32] My wife and I are business investors and we end up in a different company.

[01:34] Here's for your YouTube proof because I know there's a lot of people out there.

[01:36] So you just Google APG Jamalunch and you can see all the top results are public disclosures

[01:41] of them.

[01:42] First thing, making a big investment in the company.

[01:44] That at 46.

[01:45] Those two were at a 46.2 million evaluation.

[01:47] The third sale.

[01:48] I can't disclose the number.

[01:49] The company did 12 million here before.

[01:51] I'll just tell you that.

[01:52] Okay.

[01:53] So quick backstrike.

[01:54] I actually ended up writing out the backstory for this.

[01:57] In more detail.

[01:58] So this will get you 100% up to speed suit.

[01:59] The same context as I had.

[02:01] So I spent the better part of 2.5 years of processing about a single decision.

[02:04] Whether or not to sell my business.

[02:05] And I'm thankful to tell you that 2.5 years later, I made that decision.

[02:09] So what I want to walk you through is how I made it.

[02:11] And hopefully help someone skip the 2.5 years of mental trudging that it took me to get

[02:14] here.

[02:15] So let's start with why did I want to sell?

[02:17] So let me take you back in two moments that I started to sell and then bring you forward

[02:21] to this moment.

[02:22] So later on, I were on a walk in March of 2019 and we just done 4.4 million

[02:26] dollars from revenue that month and taken out $1.7 million on her dividends that month.

[02:30] She stopped and she looked to me and she said, let's shut it down.

[02:32] I don't feel like doing this anymore.

[02:33] We don't need the money.

[02:34] Let's just shut it down and move on.

[02:36] And being the money that I'm going to make my money motivated out of her that I was at

[02:38] the dime, I was like, hey, now let's at least see if we can sell this.

[02:41] All right.

[02:42] Maybe we can get like a small pay date before moving on to our next thing.

[02:44] And so I want to have my network up and ask anyone if they knew anyone who could

[02:47] help me value my business and let me know what somebody might pay for it.

[02:52] And that's when a good front of my Rick Mayev introduced me to investment banking

[02:54] for end of his who specialized in our space which was the fitness space at the time.

[02:58] And so within a day or two it was on the phone with a guy named Michael McCumian.

[03:02] And he was a banker in the fitness space and it transacted a handful of high-profile deals.

[03:06] And after a few introductions I shared our dilemma and asked if there was, you know, he thought

[03:10] that they could be worth anything.

[03:11] And we told me next really changed my life.

[03:13] And so I'm loosely paraphrasing.

[03:15] And he said, dude, you grew from zero to $17 million in profit in two years and you're

[03:20] now on a page to grow 50% again this year.

[03:22] That was like, yeah, I know we're really tired of it though.

[03:24] And Michael was like, if you continue to grow the end of the year, he's like, I can

[03:28] saw this for 100 or 50 million easily.

[03:30] And I was like, really?

[03:32] And he was like, yeah, and if you can disassociate your brand from your face and maybe get

[03:38] another acquisition channel going, probably even more.

[03:42] And so my job just about hit the floor.

[03:43] Right?

[03:44] I was used to small business ownership or when you stop wanting to do business, you bake someone

[03:47] to buy for me and you try to recruit your costs as much as you can get.

[03:49] But this was something entirely different by the 150 million.

[03:52] That's not even rich that generational wealth, right?

[03:54] And as a reminder, I was 28.

[03:55] All right.

[03:56] And so my wife and I probably had maybe 20 million bucks saved up at the time.

[03:59] But this was an order of magnitude change of off for us.

[04:02] And so after you get off the phone with Michael, my head was spinning.

[04:04] And I felt like my world perspective had shifted forever and it had.

[04:08] From that moment onwards, next 2 and a half years, all I thought about was how do I

[04:11] sell this business for $150 million.

[04:13] And interestingly, from that moment onwards, my business plateaued more or less.

[04:16] Right?

[04:17] I mean, we grew but not to the same degree that we were running for.

[04:20] And it could have been because I was already burned out, which is possible.

[04:23] It could have been because of macroeconomic forces because there was a little flu that

[04:27] went around that affected gyms.

[04:28] Or it could have been because I shifted from wanting to build something to wanting to sell.

[04:34] And I have no idea.

[04:35] I can say that I stopped going.

[04:37] I stopped growing after that conversation.

[04:39] And so I can truthfully tell you that 50% or more of my mental bandwidth for the last 2 and

[04:43] 1.5 years was dedicated to the idea of selling.

[04:45] And what's more difficult about that is I can't really talk about it publicly.

[04:48] Right?

[04:49] And so what happened was all my decisions changed from what is going to provide me the most

[04:57] long term goodwill with our customers to what would a potential require to think of the

[05:01] decision and what it makes the company more or less valuable.

[05:04] And I think this ultimately hurt my business.

[05:06] The heart behind the business had shifted from the process to the outcome.

[05:09] And over the next year, I revenue went up, but I thought I'd drop because I thought,

[05:12] and acquiring what I want to see you lower-turn, just true.

[05:15] But I made a terrible mistake and lowered my prices and into time to do so.

[05:17] And I ended up cutting up $5 million in profit in the process.

[05:20] So I went from $17 million in profit on 26 million top line to the next year.

[05:25] I think we did $37 million top line at 13.4 million bottom line, which is obviously not

[05:29] a bad outcome.

[05:30] But it should have gone the other way.

[05:32] It should have gone like $19 million on 37.

[05:34] Like I said, although we were by the 40% top line, my bottom line shop by 25%.

[05:37] And so we also thought we needed to show we really legit and hire a lot more people to

[05:41] sit around and do nothing while the poor team was still hustling to get the work done.

[05:44] Either way, we split up to like 130 by employees.

[05:46] I think at our peak for that, those two entities.

[05:49] And so either way, over the course of 2019, we pulled me out somewhat from the film and

[05:53] in product divisions, so that was somewhat of a win.

[05:55] And then in 2020, we committed to selling the company.

[05:58] Right?

[05:59] So that's kind of like speeding up to 2020.

[06:00] And we knew we could sell the story of the infrastructure cost being something that

[06:02] ate up margin and that we were still growing.

[06:04] And we were on pace to, you know, keep it for a year and show some growth and then

[06:07] sell it concept.

[06:08] So we went to market and February of 2020.

[06:11] And right.

[06:12] And we tested, there's this flu that went around, kind of affected our business a little

[06:15] bit.

[06:16] And we had the option to pull me back, but later on, I were honestly, you know, just like

[06:19] even handed about being the job business, right?

[06:21] We wanted to not have that be the only thing in our lives.

[06:23] The bankers ended up adjusting our expectations and said, you know, I think, and my

[06:27] do this was actually, we weren't, we were no longer working with the guy that was

[06:30] our rough, sterlier he actually was just a council.

[06:33] I, we ended up using a different firm.

[06:36] I think we can definitely help you grow and get 45 for this business, right?

[06:40] And at this point, we were fine with that.

[06:42] We just wanted out.

[06:43] And not really out.

[06:44] Just more like we wanted our focus back.

[06:45] And so over the next three quarters are revenue and profit continued to climb as the

[06:48] flu reached on.

[06:49] And once the second shutdown hit the business really hit rock bottom and Q4.

[06:53] So we had gone from like three to four million dollars a quarter and profit to like 500

[06:58] grand and profit in Q4 of 2020, right?

[07:01] And so the bankers suggested that we stopped the sales process and try, you know, try again

[07:05] once the flu had gone away, right?

[07:07] But later on, a guy, Leil and I were kind of yet again really determined to be out of

[07:10] pain and so we told them to just, you know, keep going with the process.

[07:13] And so they hit up all the property we firms again and lobe hold, we got a few replies

[07:17] and some firms registered and buying our company at rock bottom.

[07:20] What a surprise, right?

[07:21] And those replies after a lot of phone calls and meeting grades and information requests

[07:24] turned out to be two offers for the company.

[07:27] And then, you know, for context, I can't show the actual numbers of the trailing 12 that

[07:32] they came up with this for 2021.

[07:34] But I can tell you that they just consistently straight line went up.

[07:37] So basically Q4, Q1 was kind of like the bottom of it, like December of Q4 of 2020,

[07:42] it was like the absolute bottom.

[07:43] And that's really because there was almost no hope.

[07:45] You know what I mean?

[07:46] Like it had the second round of shutdowns, a lot of gems had shut down.

[07:48] It was just kind of looking bleak, no end to side, et cetera.

[07:51] And so I'll bring you up to speak kind of internally.

[07:53] We realized that we would have to build this business to run and sell because we didn't

[07:57] know if we're going to be able to sell it.

[07:59] And we knew we were working at like want to shut it down or something like that.

[08:02] There's too many families that relied on us, too many employees, too many customers like

[08:05] it just, it didn't make sense.

[08:07] And so beyond that, tactically, we started an outbound call center so that we could have

[08:11] a second channel.

[08:12] So we started to take the steps that we knew we should do and from the feedback that we'd

[08:16] had from the first round, which was like, you need a second channel and needs to be less

[08:20] branded to you, et cetera.

[08:22] This is important to understand.

[08:23] Over the next 12 months, I stopped attending all product meetings, all client facing calls,

[08:28] all client facing events.

[08:29] So I didn't show up in my oven, it's like there's nothing.

[08:31] We built an outbound call team that did 50% of our sales volume and we promoted a team of

[08:36] January's become the face of the consulting brand overall.

[08:38] And so the other remained for me was a weekly one-on with the CEO, a weekly executive

[08:43] call team that was 90 minutes and quarterly meetups internally.

[08:45] So I was no longer public facing it all, it was only internal that I was kind of facing.

[08:50] And so now let's get back to where it was interesting.

[08:52] So we signed an accepted in L.O.I. and at this point, you know, the profits had gone up significantly

[08:57] from from kind of the Q4 bottom.

[09:00] And I have to skip the actual numbers of what was around there.

[09:03] I can just tell you the overarching number, which was which ended up being 46.2.

[09:08] And so here was the decision making process.

[09:10] And that's what I want to get into, which is like, okay, so what did you guys end up doing

[09:13] in Hawaii?

[09:14] Because during this process, the business kind of almost shot out of a gun, 2021, it kind

[09:18] of had a really strong rebound.

[09:20] And that's obviously why there was way more people who were interested.

[09:22] First there was two and then there was two more.

[09:24] I introduced a party since we had a handful of private equity firms that saw the, okay, they saw

[09:28] the bottom.

[09:29] They saw the fast rising back and they're like, wait, we could buy a company.

[09:32] And just did, you know, 15 million in EBITDA, a year ago or two years ago.

[09:37] And they can bank on the fact that it would probably do that again.

[09:39] Let's dive in.

[09:40] All right, so that's the backstory.

[09:42] So these are the considerations, the story slash milestone that I was telling myself, the

[09:45] money, energy head space team resources, future vision, best decisions for the business

[09:48] and ultimately why decided what I decided to do.

[09:50] I wish I could have given you more visuals for this.

[09:53] But I, but I, this, this, this is already taken me a lot of times to transcribe all my

[09:57] notes into one presentation.

[09:58] And so there was, there was two kind of questions.

[10:01] And it was really kind of having this like devil's advocate in my head, conversation that

[10:04] was going back and forth.

[10:05] And I even just put these directional arrows to like what I said first and then what I responded

[10:09] with mentally.

[10:10] I'm sharing these thoughts with you because I want to show that like, I don't think

[10:14] these thoughts ever go away.

[10:15] You know what I mean?

[10:16] Like I said, and this is like, I mean, I was like, I need to, I'll be legit as an entrepreneur.

[10:21] And then a friend of mine was like, dude, you already have seven successful exits.

[10:24] And a handful for multiple billions, right?

[10:26] And I was like, oh, yeah, he's like, you do seven million a month right now.

[10:30] Like you're legit.

[10:31] And I was like, huh, okay.

[10:33] He's like, this is not a reason to sell business.

[10:35] I was like, okay, that's fair.

[10:36] I was like, but big exit is an entrepreneurial right of passage, right?

[10:39] And he's like, so Jeff Bezos, Doc, Elon, they're not legit because they didn't exit their

[10:43] businesses.

[10:44] And I was like, that is also a good point.

[10:46] I was like, well, there's kind of a permanent mile component.

[10:48] Like there's no e-learning companies that really sell for, you know, or personality

[10:52] driven brands that are selling for these types of numbers, not many at least.

[10:56] And so I could prove that, you know, these types of models are sellable.

[10:59] I was like, well, can I just prove that I have a higher net worth and keep it?

[11:02] I was like, that's also not a good idea or not.

[11:04] Good reason to sell it.

[11:05] You know, another story was like, you can't have more than one thing.

[11:07] And so that's why you should sell.

[11:09] But, you know, in terms of keeping in it, it's like, well, you just need to love all

[11:12] your skillset.

[11:13] Like, there are, it is not physically impossible.

[11:14] There are other entrepreneurs who do this.

[11:16] And so you just need to be better.

[11:18] And this is just a great knock growth opportunity.

[11:19] So that's not a good reason to sell.

[11:20] I'm like, all right, fair.

[11:21] I was like, ah, it's a big nice, eff you to everybody who doubted.

[11:25] And you know, it's about to get us over the years.

[11:27] And then it's just like, you're better than that.

[11:28] That's also not a good reason to sell.

[11:30] So I'm sure I can just stuff very game.

[11:31] Like, you can reinforce the lesson of selling my gyms.

[11:34] Instead of the big lesson there, and this is one that I've spoken about a lot is that, you

[11:37] know, sometimes you have to give up what you have in order to give up to get the bigger thing

[11:41] that is unknown.

[11:42] So you have to let go of something that you do know that is good in front of you for

[11:46] something that you don't know that could potentially be great.

[11:49] And it kind of hinges on the idea that what we don't do or the things that we were

[11:53] at rather than the things that we do and then fail at.

[11:55] That was that's kind of the story there.

[11:57] And the keeping argument of that is like, well, that might be the wrong lesson to learn.

[12:00] Like, maybe you needed to exit those things, but it doesn't mean you needed exit everything.

[12:04] It's making sure that we apply the correct lesson to the story.

[12:07] And that might not be the right lesson from that story.

[12:09] I was like, okay, that's fair.

[12:10] And then, you know, finally, doing a sale, early selling the majority portion of the business

[12:15] would unbrand me somewhat from the fitness industry because it's still something that drives

[12:19] me a little nuts.

[12:20] It might also be because of how I look.

[12:21] So that's possible.

[12:22] Just being real.

[12:23] Like, I still see come to like, hey, man, I still find your content guy.

[12:26] I believe in the amount of gym owner.

[12:27] I'm like, I haven't made a gym piece of content in three years.

[12:30] I'm glad.

[12:31] It's just funny.

[12:33] And I consciously made that decision in 2019 when I rebranded my podcast from gym launch

[12:38] secrets.

[12:39] And I hadn't spoken about it much enough in a while, but I consciously rebranded it to

[12:41] the game, which you can check out if you want.

[12:43] And so my keybings story around that is like, people have already moved out from that

[12:46] to like, a handful of comments is not like whatever things back right.

[12:49] You're not just like some gym dude.

[12:50] You already have the majority of your money has made outside of gyms now.

[12:53] I was like, well, yeah, but people don't know that.

[12:55] And so anyways, the usual story is out of time myself at this time.

[12:58] And so next is kind of like, what are the money things that I was telling?

[13:02] I was like, okay, well, selling cash would be nice.

[13:04] But the keeping argument is, well, after you'll have a tax event, so you'll actually

[13:08] be, you'll have to give a portion of that to the government.

[13:11] You know, actually net decreshare network because you already have that value in equity.

[13:15] And because of the amount of money you already have, so my wife and I at this point

[13:18] are probably taking from those two businesses about 45-ish million in dividends.

[13:23] This is not really going to materially change your living, which is true.

[13:26] Other thing to those that from a selling perspective is like, I can take that cash

[13:30] and then I can reinvest it and then all I have to do is just make the delta.

[13:34] So it's like, I can take, you know, whatever cash I would receive there, I can invest it

[13:38] and then I can build something else.

[13:40] And what I'd have to do is make up the net difference between what I do on my own, what

[13:46] my cash grows into, versus what that 66% would be worth in five years.

[13:52] And so that's the net delta difference.

[13:55] And I was like, I feel like that would be still a pretty strong argument for doing the

[13:59] sale.

[14:00] The flip side is, what am I going to buy that's going to make me the same amount of money

[14:02] that I could from this company that's clearly going to triple.

[14:04] And the triple in value and go back to what it was worth, you know, pre-flop, fair argument.

[14:11] On the other side, it's like, well, your super, super concentrated, you know, diversification

[14:14] is not about diversification, it's not a bad idea.

[14:16] And then I quoted more and is a hedge against it, you're interested, you feel like, you're

[14:19] in this space, you feel like, you don't like the, the company said you have, you don't

[14:23] know anything about, well, no, I actually feel like I know more about the stuff that I'm

[14:27] doing.

[14:28] Okay, well, then you don't need to have diversification just go all the things that you know

[14:31] and then they will grow disproportionately, which candidly my life is an example of that.

[14:35] So it's hard to argue against that point.

[14:37] You know, rich people sell, wealthy people never sell, another argument for keeping it.

[14:41] Yeah, I could also take out debt and still continue to do the whole thing kind of refinance

[14:46] the business and still keep 100% ownership.

[14:48] If I did that, but the problem for me from that perspective is I knew that I would never

[14:51] do that because I was already very tired.

[14:52] At that point, you're running an entire other process and scratch with something that I just

[14:55] knew I was not going to be willing to do, at least not on any short time horizon.

[14:58] I was like, okay, well, you can still do debt to fuel like M&A and start doing acquisitions

[15:02] and just use that as the umbrella brand.

[15:04] And I was like, well, a couple of things one, I didn't have the debt relationship to.

[15:08] I didn't know M&A at that level buying majority of 30, 40 million, you know, 10 on the

[15:14] low side, 30, 40 on the high side, high-scount.

[15:17] Things I was like, I don't, I don't, those are mistakes that could potentially like,

[15:21] undo everything I've done and I'm just not willing to, to put a front of mine, to

[15:25] bet the empire for a pot of gold.

[15:27] That was kind of the argument against just using debt to fuel M&A.

[15:32] The final, you know, keeping argument for money was like, after tax, you're almost

[15:35] going to know that the same money is if you just take out debt on the company tax free.

[15:41] And that is true in theory, but it's unknown based on promises from bankers, that's

[15:45] not 100% because a lot of times they make inflate things.

[15:49] Just FYI side note, bankers will inflate things for you because they want you to sign

[15:52] on the dotted line to work with them.

[15:54] Big picture consolidator from this is that like, the money wasn't going to change my life

[15:58] in either direction with our solder I kept it.

[16:00] Which brought me to the X-Winter's energy and have space.

[16:02] On one level, it's like, the story is, you can't have more than one thing, which

[16:05] I'm a very big pro-conner now.

[16:07] The counter to that is, well, we're just people and lots of things.

[16:11] Okay, well, that's also true too.

[16:14] But I think the main difference in the, I'll hit on this later, is that I think you only

[16:18] have one active thing.

[16:19] The split, split attention is one of the most dangerous things in entrepreneurship.

[16:22] And I can tell you that when I did split my attention when I started another company.

[16:26] And then a third company, my revenue pretty much just continued to flatline.

[16:30] So doing more things just does not like you have to focus.

[16:33] And I think that you can have lots of things that are going on, but you only have one

[16:37] active thing.

[16:38] So like, if I own a building, I'm not active in that.

[16:39] I could invest in Apple and I'm not active in that.

[16:42] And so you can own lots of things.

[16:44] It's just to make sure that what you're owning does not owning you.

[16:47] The next point here is that selling is the story, it's not reality.

[16:50] So it's like the idea that I'm just going to walk away, magically, and not care about the

[16:53] company or the employees or the customers.

[16:56] It's just, that's a story and telling myself in my head.

[16:58] There's still a hundred percent going to be things that I'm sleeping and, you know, going

[17:01] to bed and thinking about the team and the company and all that stuff.

[17:03] And so it's like, you're not going to get what you think you're going to get from selling.

[17:06] I was like, yeah, but I could treat it like other portfolio companies because it's kind

[17:10] of redistributing my network, you know, accordingly across more and oppresses.

[17:15] And then I can care about the more evenly whereas here it's disproportionate in terms of

[17:19] like, lopsided from my network.

[17:21] So it's like, okay, that's fair.

[17:23] Another show I'm arguing for keeping is like, you'll grow faster, never selling.

[17:26] Just never sell.

[17:28] And let it compound tax rate.

[17:29] The counter, you know, for that is like, I just have to apiece that delta with the cash

[17:33] can make me from investing plus what I'm going to make on my own versus what that 2-3rd

[17:38] share would grow into.

[17:40] Right.

[17:41] That's what I have to make up.

[17:42] I can make that up then it would make sense.

[17:43] And then this one was actually from my closest friend.

[17:45] He said, what's the objective?

[17:47] What problem are you solving?

[17:48] He said, I feel like you just chose the nuclear option of like, okay, you know, I want

[17:53] to get headspace back instead of there for work.

[17:55] I must sell to third, sell to someone already when I company.

[17:59] He said, why don't you just match the conditions?

[18:01] Right.

[18:02] Like, what do you imagine life to be like when you have soul majority?

[18:07] And then look at what those conditions look like and then match them in your car condition

[18:10] and then you can keep the company and still have the effective sale that happens in your

[18:13] month.

[18:14] And I was like, that is a fair point.

[18:16] But, you know, my counter is that like, I don't think I can do that.

[18:19] I feel like I'm still.

[18:20] I would imagine it's like having kids where even if you're spending zero time, you know,

[18:24] taking care of the kids, even when they go to college, you're still thinking about them.

[18:27] Right.

[18:28] They're still taking up shower time.

[18:29] They're still taking up morning coffee, chat time.

[18:32] Right.

[18:33] And so those are kind of some of the headspace considerations I had.

[18:36] Teamary sources.

[18:37] The big line here is that, you know, when you sell company, you lose the resources.

[18:42] Right?

[18:43] I'm so used to being on top and having a lot of leverage in my decisions.

[18:45] It's way more just deciding at this point.

[18:47] Like, I'm not doing a ton of doing within any of the portfolio companies.

[18:51] So giving up that kind of all those resources, like, hey, if like, hey, I want to go

[18:55] to go recruit somebody, I just go to the recruiter and say, hey, can you recruit this person?

[18:58] Right?

[18:59] And phone, I go build a side or I want to go put a book on Amazon.

[19:02] I just say, hey, can you go put this book on Amazon, and then it just gets done.

[19:06] Right?

[19:07] So I'll lose that.

[19:08] And that might actually be a big asset for what I want to do next to actually allow

[19:10] me to move faster.

[19:11] Right?

[19:12] So that is a strong argument for keeping it.

[19:14] Right?

[19:15] So these are the four thoughts that I had written down during the process was like, okay, well,

[19:18] I could lose the team.

[19:20] And I could coach them to become the type of people that could work at acquisition.

[19:26] Not common.

[19:27] It's like, well, different needs required, different team.

[19:29] That's not a really good shortcut.

[19:30] Like, there's different skills, different backgrounds, different experiences, et cetera.

[19:33] That's not really good to try and retrofit a team that was not designed for this.

[19:38] Right?

[19:39] You know, obviously I love the team.

[19:40] They've been with you since the beginning.

[19:41] This is me arguing to myself.

[19:42] Yeah, but I need to give them room to grow.

[19:44] And if I'm still there, kind of on top of it, they're not going to be able to like,

[19:47] blossom into what I think they can really truly grow into.

[19:50] You could make your employees wealthier.

[19:51] You know, if you kept it, you could, you know, just some sort of esoteric,

[19:54] program there, since an employee stock ownership program.

[19:56] I was like, yeah, but they can also become wealthy through this stock ownership plan

[19:59] that the new owners would put in.

[20:01] So like, okay, that's kind of moved.

[20:03] I'm rich just guys, also that they were growing the teams, that's something I talk to

[20:06] people who were wealthy with a man there, like, they all were graded doing it.

[20:08] The counter to that is, but they're all really wealthy doing their next thing.

[20:12] So, I get, and I can understand the, I can understand both sides of it.

[20:17] Future in vision, in terms of like, what I'm doing my life to be like, this could be

[20:22] the cash out of build, the conglomerate, you know, that funds all of these new acquisitions

[20:26] that I build into my conglomeration.

[20:27] I was like, yeah, but I could use the cash and sell it to the same, okay, fair.

[20:32] The version of me that I want to be, can own multiple companies without running them.

[20:36] Yes, but you still need to give, you know, like, that's not reality for you right

[20:42] now.

[20:43] And then, you know, finally here, you'll still care about the team the same.

[20:46] But you'll just have to give it up the upside.

[20:50] So you're still going to do the same mental work and mental decisions since strategic

[20:53] playing the way you always are, but you'll just give up the upside.

[20:55] And the counter to that is like, yeah, but I'll still have four companies rather than one,

[20:59] and that's going to really distract me from what I want to do ultimately, which is acquisition

[21:03] outcome.

[21:04] And so, that was kind of like the future in vision component.

[21:07] All right.

[21:08] And so, the last thing before I'll tell you why I made the decision that I did is the business

[21:13] component.

[21:14] So, on one side, I was like, okay, do you want to do what is required to get to 200

[21:18] million?

[21:19] I could just do the playbook that the private equity is going to do, because I know what their

[21:22] playbook is and so I could just do that.

[21:24] So that's an argument, right?

[21:26] You know, business is always going to value over time, right?

[21:29] Unless they don't, in which case they become a sellable.

[21:31] So it's like if you keep it and it goes up then, like, you would still own the thing and

[21:34] you're going to be making more money to the future.

[21:35] So the value goes up and you get dividends all the time, which is why business ownership

[21:38] is very lucrative.

[21:39] But in case it doesn't, in which case you don't make any money and the thing that you have

[21:43] has no value, right?

[21:46] You know, they don't have a magic pill, they're not going to do anything you don't know how

[21:48] to do.

[21:49] It's like, yes, but they're going to put all their focus on it and I am not because I'm

[21:52] doing other things that I want to do.

[21:54] You know, imagine what you're going to learn, watching them do M&A if we sell it.

[21:57] Yeah, but you don't need to learn from them to do that.

[22:01] It's a different perspective on it.

[22:05] If you want to do what they do, just buy it from yourself and have your new self buy it

[22:11] from your old self, still go through the transaction mentally.

[22:14] Install the same incentives, run the same playbook, is that I'm just on the whole thing,

[22:18] right?

[22:19] But I don't really thought about that, and I feel like it's fear that's driving the

[22:22] institution fear of losing what I have.

[22:25] And it's like, hey, you need to have the skill of being passive or already have that.

[22:29] It's just not, I just don't feel like I have that about a company that I founded myself.

[22:34] And then you know, I should just use the transition plan that I already designed for

[22:37] intelligence that I presented to them and just execute it yourself.

[22:40] And it's like, yeah, I can do that in theory, but I don't know if it's going to be that

[22:44] clean.

[22:45] And so, you know, the one line summary for this is like, do I think selling or keeping

[22:50] it is the best decision for the business?

[22:51] I think that if I keep the company, I will increase my net worth more.

[22:56] Do I think the company will realize it's potential if I keep it maybe, maybe not.

[23:01] I think that the people who were willing to potentially buy it had a very good skill set

[23:07] in growing companies of this size, their more experienced than emanated me.

[23:11] And so, I think that the business would benefit from that.

[23:14] All right, so what decision did I ultimately make?

[23:17] I'll give you my quick one line summary of kind of selling and keeping after giving you all

[23:21] those different variables.

[23:23] For selling anything that distracts from my Berkshire pathway will be a net loss.

[23:28] So get into a better boat.

[23:30] And this is just the classic example of like everybody told me that I was crazy.

[23:32] You want to always sell my gems to start the licensing company.

[23:36] Jim Oach.

[23:37] This is because like what they saw in front of them was six gyms that were making money.

[23:40] And I was 26 or something.

[23:42] And they were like, why would you give something up that you were to art for?

[23:46] And it's obviously making money.

[23:47] And it's because like in some ways like I have to believe in me more than they do.

[23:51] Because in their minds maybe that's what they think I'm limited to capacity-wise.

[23:56] And I think that I can do more.

[23:57] And so that's the argument for selling.

[23:59] The argument for keeping, which is also very compelling, is become the person who can grow,

[24:03] cash compounding, and conglomerate without ever selling.

[24:05] You know, Warren Buffett never sells whole-earned companies.

[24:08] He also says get into the best boat.

[24:10] So he is too pieces of advice that contradict themselves.

[24:12] And they're both very good and very, very fair.

[24:15] So what's the situation that I ultimately make?

[24:17] So everyone has a plan until they're checking front of them to walk away for 46.2.

[24:21] So it's one thing to say no in theory.

[24:24] It's another thing to say no in your won't-ie-mail away from that, you know, buddy.

[24:27] Right?

[24:28] And so these are kind of the soft decision frameworks that I applied.

[24:31] So the first one is that I had to acknowledge that there was no wrong answer.

[24:35] Right?

[24:36] So I knew that if I did either of those directions ultimately, I was still always going to be very

[24:40] wealthy and none of it was going to make any material difference in my life.

[24:44] And whatever decision I tried to go to, winners win and I would have probably executed

[24:49] either way and probably wouldn't matter.

[24:51] I knew also from a happiness perspective that I'll probably be happy in the direction

[24:54] and, you know, rationalize whatever decision I made either way.

[24:58] That was like first and foremost none of this matters.

[25:01] The second one is like, okay, well, you know, is it- I could still make a better decision

[25:05] versus a worse decision, even though they're both might be quite a right decision.

[25:08] Which is just reminded me of the story of the boy in the horse, you know, father buys a boy

[25:14] of horse, everyone in the town said that's amazing.

[25:16] The wise man says time will tell.

[25:19] Then the kid falls off the horse and breaks his leg and then everyone's like, oh, that's

[25:22] terrible.

[25:23] You bought the kid the horse and then the wise man says time will tell and then army

[25:25] comes around and recruits all the young guys to go to the military and then you know,

[25:29] half them die and then everyone's like, oh my god, that horse was a blessing and then the

[25:33] wise man says time will tell and so also he kind of get where this is going.

[25:36] Right?

[25:37] He said you don't really know whether something was good or bad until the day you die and

[25:39] once you die it won't matter.

[25:40] Food for thought.

[25:42] Noting that the three hardest decisions in my life, putting my job to start my gym, selling

[25:46] the gym to start gym lunch and then potentially selling gym lunch, prostitution, Allen to start

[25:51] acquisition to how I'm going to go all in on that.

[25:54] Each of those are the three hardest decisions in my life and it's because I had to give up

[25:57] something that I knew that gave me status that people give me praise for that most people

[26:03] considered big materials successes for something that was potentially bigger but completely

[26:08] unknown.

[26:09] So the burden the hand versus the two in the bush and the thing is that the hardest decisions

[26:13] I think in life are giving up the one that's in your hand for the two that are in the

[26:16] bush and so it's like you have to take big risks sometimes to take the next kind of

[26:21] like quantum leap.

[26:22] You know, take the next jump in order of magnitude.

[26:26] So these are the three hardest decisions I've ever made in my life and I would say that

[26:29] in order they were most difficult, putting my job, second most difficult selling my

[26:33] gyms, third most difficult selling these companies.

[26:37] I remember my majority interest in those companies.

[26:39] So I give this for context because I think that a lot of people who are listening to this

[26:43] like you're probably in one of these decisions where you have one in your hand and there's

[26:46] two in the bush.

[26:47] Like I think the hardest decision of entrepreneurship or really life in general is when do

[26:51] you give that up?

[26:52] When do you not take the rational move and take the upside down?

[26:56] So for me I just knew that regret would be more guaranteed for empaths not taking rather

[27:00] than failed execution.

[27:03] This is a question that I get from Leila and it was one of the things that we both

[27:07] thought about a lot which is what am I most afraid of?

[27:09] Like which of these decisions makes me most afraid keeping it or selling it?

[27:13] And for me selling it was the thing I was most afraid of because I was like what if I can't

[27:17] recreate what I've done, what if it's a flash in the pan, what if I'm a one-hand one

[27:21] nerve which was selling anyways because we're really of seven in the business we've sold

[27:25] but I'm just telling you, these are the thoughts you have right?

[27:28] And so yeah like what am I most afraid of?

[27:30] That was what I was most afraid of.

[27:31] And so finally our second to last I had my 85-year-old self-test which I have talked a lot

[27:36] about and I'll talk more about which is I run and I'm doing this almost like without

[27:41] knowing now because it's been so great because then probably the most effective decision

[27:44] framework I've had in my life and so I'm just going to keep using it which is like what

[27:48] is 85-year-old me think about this decision?

[27:51] And the honest truth is that 85-year-old me in this decision was useless because it was like

[27:55] it's not going to matter anyways do the thing that it's ice you.

[27:59] And you know it's like what are you and like I'm talking about 85-year-old self-esteem

[28:01] is like what are you afraid of and it's like then I'm not going to be successful if I do

[28:04] the next thing.

[28:05] It's like wow that's not a very good reason not to do it.

[28:08] And so I was like okay I guess that's fair.

[28:11] Did you want to become you know I was like why are they going to be a rational investor

[28:15] wrong?

[28:16] I'm going to be somebody who makes rational decisions.

[28:17] He's like yeah but you know the ups like you're limited on your upside in this and

[28:23] so like if you believe that your life can be bigger than this then you're guaranteed

[28:26] to not get it if you don't take the big jokes.

[28:29] I was like okay that's fair and so that was kind of like the main shifts that I got

[28:34] from my 85-year-old self.

[28:35] This was ultimately the one thing that mattered most and then I'll tell you finally why

[28:39] I decided to do what I did.

[28:40] The next thing that I do will be 10x or 100x's big and if anything takes my 10 from

[28:44] that it will be in it loss.

[28:45] I would hate to look back and think I was holding onto a hard one I had and didn't

[28:48] have enough faith or I could have.

[28:51] If I took the leap and believed before saying and so at every level the fog is bigger

[28:55] but so too is the reward and so like as you you know climb the mountain right if you fall

[29:00] there's further than hit the ground in terms of your perceived failures but like you still

[29:05] have to take jumps to hit the next mountain tops and so I think that was ultimately the

[29:11] biggest reason for why we decided to do what we did.

[29:14] I'll tell you one interesting thing which is that like I felt the loss of the business

[29:18] but I didn't feel the gain of the money.

[29:20] The money really I didn't feel it at all and so that was kind of interesting because

[29:24] I felt like the loss of resources.

[29:26] I did feel some level of relief for about three days and then it was back to normal which

[29:30] was nice and then now that we are back in this in this season of building I can tell you

[29:37] 100% that this was 100% the right decision.

[29:41] Obviously I'm going to rationalize whatever decision I make but after really thinking

[29:46] through all of the different angles this was the right call because I can already see and

[29:52] feel the momentum it's so nice to be back in the trenches again.

[29:55] I love building things.

[29:57] I'm a builder and so it's great to build not only my own business but to build all

[30:03] the portfolio companies.

[30:05] And so I'm learning so much more.

[30:07] I'm being exposed to a lot more things which allows me to make more lessons and the mission

[30:12] of acquisition.com is to document and share the best practices of building world

[30:15] class businesses and so.

[30:16] You're like why does that make these videos?

[30:18] Part of it is because of that.

[30:19] I wish that Elon and I wish that Jeff and I wish that Warren wrote books and made YouTube

[30:26] channels.

[30:27] What they were thinking about at every given part of their journey because I hope that

[30:32] 30, 40, 50 years from now.

[30:34] Like we were like man if you look at Alex and his 30s what he was deciding what he was

[30:37] thinking about.

[30:38] Look at him in his 40s what he was deciding what he was thinking about.

[30:41] I wanted these videos to be kind of like proof of that so that they could hopefully help

[30:45] others retrace the path.

[30:47] But I am very very confident that the decision that we made was the right one.

[30:50] I just can't tell you the amount of creative energy.

[30:52] It was like the moment we actually made the decision it was like my future on the

[30:55] lock to get like a couldn't see past making the decision to sell.

[30:59] It was like I had to make this decision before the rest of the opportunities in my life

[31:04] opened up.

[31:05] I think I made a tweet that was shared a zillion times just like the heaviest thing in the

[31:09] world is an iron and gold but it's an unmade decision.

[31:11] I made that during the time when I was making this decision to sell or not.

[31:17] I think that for a lot of us there's these unmade decisions that weigh us down and like

[31:20] they eat up so much of our mental capacity that we just need to free ourselves up and

[31:24] do it and pull the trigger.

[31:26] Here's the software's information that I love myself to think through the 99 cent book.

[31:31] You want to give 66 cents of that to Amazon.

[31:35] It's got 3,000 fast RRU views.

[31:37] It's the first of 10 books that I'm making and a detailed new process of scaling a business.

[31:41] I have a course that goes with that that's for free.

[31:43] You don't even have to opt in for it.

[31:45] It's not like an email collection.

[31:46] It's just I think that the highest leverage thing that most people can do is improve their

[31:50] offer and it's the first place that I start with all the businesses that we take on that we

[31:53] invest in.

[31:54] So if yours like what we actually do we invest in companies that are doing between 1 and

[31:59] 10 million in profit, typically within the e-learning or service space, chains of brick and

[32:06] mortar service businesses that want to license or want to franchise or people who already

[32:10] have a niche that they have to find out that they do business services too.

[32:13] So it's like, I'm good at bookkeeping.

[32:17] I'm good at helping lawyers improve their practices.

[32:19] Whatever.

[32:20] Stuff like that are the types of niche licensing businesses that we go after because that's our

[32:23] playbook.

[32:24] We work with those businesses to scale and tell you know, 30, 50 million plus that I make

[32:28] these videos for everyone else to hopefully get there so that we can have the opportunity

[32:33] to invest in your business and help you go to the next level.

[32:37] So anyways, this is part one.

[32:39] This is just like the thoughts behind the decision.

[32:41] I will do another video too in terms of what I learned about the negotiation process.

[32:46] I'll explain it what I learned about the sales process, who've all in other videos.

[32:50] This is what I wanted to walk through, what I was thinking about for myself and everyone

[32:54] for why we decided to do that and then ultimately sell the two third-stage.

[33:00] Hope you found a value in this and if you did, watch another video and I'll see you in the next

[33:04] ones.

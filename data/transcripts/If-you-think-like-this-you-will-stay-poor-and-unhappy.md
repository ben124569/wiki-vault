[00:00] My wife and I acquired a $100 million at worth by the time we were age 32 and as a result

[00:04] of that, we had very different views and perspectives on money and happiness.

[00:08] And I was recently interviewed in a two or a long podcast with Graham Suffin.

[00:11] And he asked questions about it and from what I understand a lot of people shared and talked

[00:16] about this particular section of the podcast.

[00:18] And so we chose to cut this out and give it to you in the next 11 minutes.

[00:22] And if you don't know how I am, my name is OximosaEauNecquisition.com.

[00:24] It's a portfolio of companies.

[00:25] So enjoy the video, welcome to my own donation.

[00:27] I'll see you in the other side.

[00:28] Like a lot of people make statements like, they're like, isms like this is this way,

[00:31] like I have this thought and is.

[00:33] And you're like, and I've just accepted that like, I'm always going to have this.

[00:37] Like I would just never speak that over yourself, just write off the bad.

[00:39] Because like you're just saying, I'm never going to get over this thing.

[00:42] Like the statement you said earlier about like, I at the end of the day, I just like,

[00:45] I just want to be happy.

[00:46] Like when you admit that you just want to be happy, then what happens is you create a deficit

[00:50] between your current reality and happiness, which means that it doesn't matter what happens

[00:52] because there will always be happiness that is outside of yourself.

[00:55] So make sense?

[00:56] Kind of.

[00:57] Yeah.

[00:57] I mean, but I would consider myself, no, no, he didn't get that at all.

[01:00] No, I got it.

[01:01] I got it because I'm like, I'm like, I'm a jow.

[01:03] Oh man.

[01:03] But I thought, okay.

[01:04] So here's my interpretation of it.

[01:07] If I'm telling myself that I just want to be happy, then I will never be happy.

[01:11] Correct.

[01:11] You're saying.

[01:12] No, I understand what you're saying.

[01:13] Right.

[01:13] But I'm telling you right now that I am happy now.

[01:18] Good.

[01:19] So, but it, okay, we grab.

[01:22] I, what do you still think I don't understand that?

[01:25] So like, deficits occur when we speak desires.

[01:29] Right.

[01:30] And so I love this statement.

[01:32] A desire is a contract we make with ourselves to be unhappy until we get what we want.

[01:36] And so whenever we stay to desire, like I want this, I want this amount of money, I want

[01:40] whatever.

[01:41] You literally sign a contract that says like I won't be unhappy until that happens.

[01:44] Right.

[01:45] And so like I had this thing earlier on where I was like, I want to have meaning.

[01:48] I want to have great meaning in my life and I was talking to you, I hit it a lot more.

[01:51] Money than me.

[01:52] Because I asked him, I said, how do you create and destroy meaning in your work?

[01:54] That was the question I asked him on a podcast.

[01:56] And he was like, why do you think life needs to be meaningful?

[01:59] And it was the same exact thing as the happiness versus like the meaning thing where it's like,

[02:02] I say life has to be meaningful and therefore everything that I'm doing, like I create this

[02:07] expectation of life whereas if life just is, it just is.

[02:11] And it's the only way that you can actually be there.

[02:14] It's just pure acceptance, right?

[02:17] Which is why like the whole like should's of like we should work, we should have balance,

[02:21] we should act, it's like I believe marriage is a compromise.

[02:24] Like these are just statements of belief that are casting expectations out in the world that are just

[02:28] bound to be untrue at some point and then create dissonance.

[02:32] And so it's like I believe marriage is marriage.

[02:35] And I believe my marriage is my marriage and I believe your marriage is your marriage.

[02:38] And like I believe that I can work 24 hours a day if I want to and that is all period.

[02:43] Not and it's bad or and it's good.

[02:44] And there's no judgment on it.

[02:45] It just is.

[02:46] And so like if I get, you know, if I get, don't believe it, I mean, it's created in my brain when

[02:51] I start working cool like and I will optimize for dopamine.

[02:54] And if I die, I know that in a thousand generations, nothing I do anyways is going to matter.

[02:59] So who cares?

[03:00] Like that's like the opening thing in my book is like there are no rules.

[03:04] Like we live on this like this like should's and half-tos and like, like happiness, everyone

[03:09] talks about it and it's just like everyone is unhappy because they say they want to be happy.

[03:13] Rather than being like, except for like happiness.

[03:16] Like I just am, period.

[03:18] And then like I don't need to judge the am.

[03:21] It just is.

[03:22] How do you, what do you say to that?

[03:23] I don't know.

[03:26] That makes sense.

[03:27] Yeah.

[03:28] So one thing I noticed is if you're like, I just want to be happy.

[03:31] No.

[03:32] Does that mean Alex that you think that at some point that will change for you or something

[03:36] earlier, you have you lived here?

[03:38] No, I think that that will change.

[03:39] I think you guys maybe are taking what I'm saying the wrong way.

[03:42] I mean like like Alex is saying, you know, everybody has different beliefs and there's

[03:47] no one rule fits all to everybody.

[03:50] And so if I say I want to be happy, that doesn't make me wrong.

[03:54] If I want to live my life that way, that's perfectly fine.

[03:58] But the thing that that what Jack is saying is, no, I am like happy like I, but for me,

[04:06] I like to make like a conscious effort to work towards that.

[04:10] And Alex can live his life, like life is life my marriage is my marriage.

[04:16] It works for him and that generate happiness, whether he's like thinking about it.

[04:19] But it doesn't have to generate happiness.

[04:21] That's the right thing.

[04:22] Yes, yes.

[04:23] Like right, like but like because it makes it like not because it's like when people say like,

[04:27] hey, work, you know, set these goals and like the rest will take care of itself.

[04:34] It still makes the rest taking care of itself the reason that you're doing it, which means

[04:37] that it's actually not getting around it when people were like, you got to be processed

[04:39] driven if you're like, if we focus on the process, the goals take care of themselves,

[04:42] it still means that the goals are important.

[04:44] So like you have to, if you want to make the transition from like a processed driven life,

[04:48] which is like I'm doing these things to do them period, then the so that I can be happy

[04:52] so that I can have a good marriage so that I can have a meaningful life has to disappear

[04:55] from the equation.

[04:57] It has to be, I do them period, not because I do them.

[05:01] But then it goes back the other way, like, but why?

[05:03] Because you say so like, because you want to, right?

[05:07] Like if you want to have if you want to describe the meaning to why you're doing

[05:10] something, you do it for whatever reason.

[05:13] Wow, this is deep.

[05:15] So I mean, this has been a lot of my time thinking of because I have nothing else to do.

[05:18] And this is what my last year was was like trying to figure out like why I didn't have,

[05:23] like I felt the exact same way, while I was why I had nothing as to where I have now.

[05:28] I feel the same.

[05:29] Like like people were like, man, it was cool in the money.

[05:31] Am I count?

[05:32] I felt nothing.

[05:33] Like truly, like not even like the two day, like I, it was irrelevant.

[05:38] How did you learn all of this?

[05:39] Did was this through speaking with other people who have been there before you?

[05:43] Thinking, I mean, my closest friend is a philosopher and I use that in terms of like the

[05:48] actual meaning of the word philosopher.

[05:49] So like, feel it to love and then sofosus wisdom or knowledge.

[05:53] So like he's a lover of knowledge, lover of wisdom and like we talk every week.

[05:57] It's like the only standing meaning that I have is we talk for like two hours.

[05:59] So we just talk about life and he's one of these guys who like lives in a cave.

[06:02] And it's like he got his PhD when he was 20, like just a very brilliant guy.

[06:06] And so he and I just talk about things, you know?

[06:08] Should a chair is contact information.

[06:10] For the first time, Gaston the pod.

[06:12] Oh, I mean, he's brilliant.

[06:14] I mean, if you like Dr. Gashy is brilliant, he's the smartest human that I know in terms of like

[06:20] brilliance and their ability to communicate it in a simple way.

[06:24] And so he helped me get over a lot of the things that I, that I used to struggle with and a lot of it was just like

[06:30] the language that we use matters a lot because like how we say things is how we think things.

[06:35] And so like what I was saying earlier, like, and this is not like this is not like a slight.

[06:40] I'm just saying like when I hear like when I hear anyone talk like on my team or or customers or whatever,

[06:46] it's like people talk so many things over themselves.

[06:49] And they're like, I don't know why I'm not successful.

[06:51] And it's like, well, defines success and why are you not?

[06:54] And then what are the, you know, I mean, like I just want to do this to be like,

[06:57] there's so many chains that they put on themselves that it becomes very difficult to live.

[07:02] And so like I spent a long time trying to not do that.

[07:05] And it was just because like I was unhappy and I didn't like being unhappy.

[07:09] And then I stopped judging myself for being unhappy.

[07:12] And then I stopped thinking about it altogether.

[07:14] And so I think that like I'll give you a really really example for this.

[07:17] So one of the things that I'm vehemently opposed and I like you know and give brand

[07:21] flag, you can give it to me.

[07:24] And like this is coming from a family through like had alcoholics and drug addicts and things like that.

[07:29] Like I really don't like the alcoholics and omnis concept of every morning waking up and saying,

[07:35] I am an alcoholic, I, you know, whatever.

[07:37] And then they go into their and their meetings because what it does is it puts it at the forefront of their mind.

[07:41] And they literally label themselves every morning is having this problem.

[07:44] When somebody who's not an alcoholic just doesn't think about it.

[07:47] They don't think I'm an alcoholic.

[07:48] I have to fight not drinking every day.

[07:50] They just don't think about it.

[07:52] And so I think to the same degree that like living a meaningful life is not saying like,

[07:57] I'm living a meaningful life.

[07:58] You just are and you're not casting it.

[08:01] You're just, you just are.

[08:03] But then you think some of that is just that inherent belief that some people just have the

[08:08] raised from that that positive experiences that turns into a spiral.

[08:11] But the people who don't have that who are used to every day being like, I'm worthless.

[08:15] I suck at this.

[08:16] I am bad at this.

[08:17] Don't you think that maybe that like first step in like getting in that direction is positive affirmations of like I could do it.

[08:24] I could, isn't that like that better than zero?

[08:27] Like I feel like we're going to zero to one is like I think it's exiting,

[08:30] I think it's exiting the equation altogether.

[08:32] So it's saying I am worthless instead of saying like I want to be worthy or I am worthy just saying

[08:37] Worthiness doesn't matter.

[08:38] But then wouldn't you get just people not caring at all?

[08:43] Yes.

[08:43] So I'm 100% in pointless.

[08:45] Yeah.

[08:45] Like I believe we don't have anything happens and like you know it is what it is.

[08:48] Right.

[08:48] But and there are different ways to take that.

[08:51] Some people are like life is meaningless and there's no point in any of it which I would agree with them.

[08:55] And then the other people are like there's no point in any of it.

[08:57] And so I'll do what I want.

[08:59] And some people see that as like a very very very self-serving which I might be.

[09:02] But to the same degree like you are released from the chains of the expectations of others.

[09:08] And most people in my opinion that I have witnessed who are unhappy is because they are

[09:13] weighted down by the chains of their parents, of their friends, of their siblings, of the

[09:16] whatever things that people that they believe are casting judgment on them.

[09:19] And they care so much about that person's disprolative.

[09:22] They don't want to do the things that they want to do.

[09:24] And so if I think it's easier to get someone to realize that none of it matters

[09:29] and then build from there, then to try and flip the negatives.

[09:32] It's just to exit the equation all together.

[09:33] Just say none of this matters.

[09:35] Therefore, I will start my YouTube channel and not care if my dad says that YouTube isn't real.

[09:39] Like it's not about being worth it.

[09:41] Like this is one where they're like, I deserve success.

[09:45] Like they don't.

[09:46] No one deserves anything.

[09:47] But you can do the stuff that gets success independent of your deservingness.

[09:50] Let me terrible person and get become successful.

[09:53] So that person doesn't deserve it but they did the things that create success.

[09:55] If we define success to some material, whatever.

[09:58] And so I think if you can exit the equation of labeling yourself and then just doing

[10:04] because what else will you do while you are alive, it creates some levels of freedom that

[10:09] allow for clarity of thought.

[10:11] And also for the ability to take risks that most people can't take.

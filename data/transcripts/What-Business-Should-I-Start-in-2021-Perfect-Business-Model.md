[00:00] What's going on everyone happy Tuesday? I hope you guys are pumped for today's podcast

[00:05] such video. I've been looking forward to this one for a little bit and if I sound a little bit

[00:09] stuffed up it's because I have two massive tubes that are like four inches long

[00:12] and each of my nostrils but that was no reason to not give you guys a

[00:16] sick stuff for business stuff and this is mostly just for me too. So anyways

[00:21] buckle up I hope you enjoyed. So today we're going to talk about is the perfect

[00:24] business and so believe it out this is actually something I talk a lot about not as

[00:28] much publicly but when I like if we were to ever talk in person and talk

[00:31] talk shop about business I love talking about business models I love talking about

[00:35] just monetization structures in general, breading books, specific about

[00:40] state structures so really excited about it but I just recently finished

[00:45] Berkshire Hathaway University which is basically the consolidated 30 years of

[00:52] shareholder that Warren Buffett and Charlie Bugger the you know the

[00:58] co-founders co-chair events etc. of Berkshire Hathaway they do these yearly

[01:03] shareholder events and you guys are both billionaires. The other both and

[01:06] they're high-didees which is crazy. They've been investing for 50 plus years

[01:10] investing for 50 plus years and they built a you know could

[01:13] really dollar empire. I think as of today it's worth half a trillion which is just

[01:18] nuts their return on capital was 2 million percent so when they started it

[01:23] where they acquired Berkshire Hathaway which was a publicly traded company at the

[01:26] time was the textile company they the stock was $19 I believe actually no they

[01:32] offered to buy Warren Buffett out at $11.30 or $50. Anyway it doesn't matter

[01:39] point is is that it was between $11.20 right and at this point that same stock is

[01:46] worth $377,000. All right so that's a that's a 20,000 extra turn so a few so

[01:52] his on put $10,000 it's our worth $200 million all right that's how crazy

[01:57] this is and over you know 30 years of shareholder things there is many times

[02:02] where he gives little nuggets of wisdom of what he's looking at. Oh he's buying a

[02:06] business or what he what he believes to be valuable businesses and I was really

[02:11] it was cool for me because I have always had three-bade things that I look for

[02:17] businesses and it really kids book or the book that was about his shareholder

[02:21] meetings I added two to that list that's our wanted to share those with you today

[02:26] all right and the moniker that I have had for this is I'm gonna share it with you

[02:32] is unique expensive sticky air and I said there's five there's four words here

[02:47] and that's okay because I'm gonna show the last one at a second but unique

[02:51] expensive stickier so I'm looking for like in my mind of what a perfect

[02:55] business is it's unique expensive stickier and I'll explain each one of these

[02:58] so unique is something and I'll tell you what I think and he said it is

[03:03] shareholder meeting that I found really just it was just so short and so

[03:06] like packed that I loved it he said it was a response to what is an ideal

[03:11] business in one of the what are the meetings he said something that cost

[03:14] a petty sells for a buck and it is having for me and it was so succinct it's so

[03:20] great and reading some of the other stuff he's got other other things but

[03:24] that one was three of the five in three sentences right so they cost a

[03:28] petty sells for a dollar and it's having for me and I just like it's it's just so

[03:34] great all right so let's let's break this out so something that cost a

[03:38] petty so that would be like air so be that cost you almost nothing to make

[03:42] all right it's expensive meeting you could sell it for a dollar so cost your

[03:48] petty get sell it for a dollar and it's sticky it's habit for me people

[03:53] come back and keep buying it again and again right which means very

[03:57] log lifetime values all right that's that's what he's looking at

[04:01] initially now the the unique part is something that if you if you listen to

[04:05] some of his other stuff is he likes to have big competitive votes all right so

[04:09] what's something that's you know what's how can I find air for a petty sell it

[04:14] for a dollar that people come back you want to keep breathing and don't

[04:18] would else cancel it so it's unique air right it's not here that anyone

[04:22] could sell it's specific to the to it has a brand-bite in that note could copy

[04:26] it has share of mind he talks about that a lot like guy co and we're gonna

[04:31] hear probably does like you could say 50% or more by switch it to guy co you've

[04:34] heard that because he ten acts to their advertising budget as soon as he bought

[04:38] the whole thing it just had to go on a massive rap page that they could take

[04:42] over my chair and guy co has grown proportionally and so this is form those

[04:46] features right unique expensive sticky air something he could make for a

[04:52] petty sells for a dollar is habit for me that no one else can replicate and

[04:59] for me this is just so cool I'll talk about a couple of the features of this

[05:04] in a second you know I'll talk about it now so one thing that you'll notice

[05:09] and this is for all the new watch butters or you know really bucket any

[05:13] entrepreneur who's interested in this kind of thing notice the gross

[05:17] margins he's talking about right a lot of people quote feel bad for charging

[05:22] for things that don't cost the bunch which is a terrible mindset to have you

[05:25] charged with the market will give you right so if for example you you know you

[05:31] find this these widgets like these peds and you know that then you get them from

[05:35] someplace to try to get cost you a dollar if someone's willing to give you a

[05:39] hundred dollars for it do you feel bad take it you're like well if only they

[05:45] do markets are built on information advantages information inefficiencies

[05:50] meeting one person the seller knows more than the buyer that's that's how these

[05:55] things work a lot right it so I I noticed this because you know you're

[06:01] listening to one of the best investors of all time if not the best investor of

[06:04] all time and he looks for like a hundred to one right cost of penny sells

[06:08] for a dollar a hundred to what it costs one penny one percent cost of goods

[06:12] compared to what it's big sold for so ninety-nine percent gross margins that for

[06:17] me it was actually very very interesting is that he he doesn't go for like an

[06:22] eighty percent or a ninety percent he goes for ninety-nine percent and for

[06:25] perspective the difference between selling something for a dollar that cost

[06:30] you ten cents versus selling something for a dollar that cost you petty is that

[06:35] that you know it's it's just died percent more profitable to sell some you know

[06:39] sell a dollar that cost a penny versus a dollar that cost a dime it's actually

[06:44] ten times more profitable it here's here's why but I'll explain this is that for

[06:48] one unit of cost the penny would get sell ten times the amount for that one

[06:55] cost so the savings sets so if I were to sell ten pennies worth of buy cost it

[07:01] means I have a ten dollars whereas ten pennies worth of the other example of a

[07:05] dime is only one dollar and that's one of the things people to understand

[07:09] about margins right the gross margin of the product that you have like every

[07:14] increment where you go from what you go from ninety to ninety five percent gross

[07:18] margins in a business you doubled the profitability of the business that's

[07:22] what's crazy right and so that's why this is so important right now if you

[07:27] try for example look at look at your prices right out let's say I would

[07:31] get to if you're at ninety and you say I would get to ninety five percent

[07:34] gross margins now let's say cost you right let's say cost you ten dollars

[07:40] right for your for your thing right and you sell for a hundred that's ninety

[07:44] percent gross margins some ninety dollars is is margin for you ten dollars

[07:48] is cost you sell for a hundred all right so if you wouldn't get to ninety five

[07:52] percent gross margins what do you think you do would you add five dollars to be

[07:56] one or five no that's not that to get to ninety five percent gross

[08:00] margins you'd have to sell the same ten dollar thing for two hundred dollars

[08:04] that's what people don't get about margins right and so what I like what I

[08:09] would we would we would turn gyms around what and what I have guys who are at

[08:13] sixty six percent margins that's usually were most people are and that's

[08:15] horrible by the way and I would say we need to get you to eighty they would

[08:19] see sixty sixty eighty only fourteen percent only fourteen percent only fourteen

[08:23] percent you just saw me double the price from a hundred to two hundred and

[08:25] five right and so that's that's how important these margins are and so to

[08:31] hear this men say I want something that I could create for a penny self

[08:35] for a dollar that's have it for me to get people keep by over and over for

[08:38] their still lives and then know what else can buy because it's unique right that

[08:42] was pretty cool and so these are the four kind of components of the business

[08:46] itself but the last thing that Buffett talks about and he talks about this a

[08:50] lot so much all the odd line here do do do do is the person who is

[08:56] running it all right and he has three characteristics that I saw him repeat

[08:59] over and over again for the management or the operators all right and they have

[09:05] such a brilliant model of managing right because Bertrand has like ninety to

[09:08] below he's there's something like that so we can step into the have a gazillion

[09:11] eighty-eight billion profits last year think about eighty billion they

[09:15] second was property a entire world like a twenty-first of company because

[09:18] they're so good at advocating were supposed just basically delegating out

[09:22] uh... responsibility to the business of that they bought now

[09:25] he turns out a lot of deals but what he looks for it operators and this is

[09:29] why I think this is cool is that what he looks for it operators we can look

[09:34] for in ourselves we can create that in ourselves as entrepreneurs right we

[09:37] can think how can I embody these characteristics all right and so the first of

[09:42] these characteristics is he says what's up with risk of verse right because

[09:47] he said many times anything type zero is zero is like you can have thirty

[09:53] years of a great track record and make one bet that goes to zero and lose it all

[09:58] and that is why he's so risk of verse and I had a mentor told me something

[10:02] what that I just loved he said Alex you should only have to get rich once

[10:07] for some reason it's just like that that hit different should only have to get

[10:10] rich once and so

[10:13] and the smarts best of the world feels that way too you should be risk of

[10:16] verse he's like I give I give up bigger opportunities all day long to to cover

[10:22] my downside right and the richest people the world up to this right now if

[10:25] you don't have access to people who are worth a hundred million a

[10:27] billion I do and I'll tell you how they think all right

[10:32] it's all about downside risk mitigation they will give up

[10:36] huge returns to not risk losing money and the funny thing is that poor people

[10:41] think they exact opposite they go for the lottery they have basically what

[10:44] hundred percent guaranteed downside right what did three hundred

[10:48] billion of winning and they do it all the time right and one of the things

[10:52] that uh buffets says is like if you if you uh if you bet poorly small you'll

[10:57] bet poorly big uh which I I love that too right so anyways number one

[11:01] management is risk of verse so we think about ourselves how could I be more

[11:04] that I can't lose right so much more important not lose than it is to

[11:07] win and what's interesting is that if you don't lose log it off you kind of

[11:11] win by default which is kind of interesting which brings me to the second

[11:15] point which is log term thinking so the reason that they like family

[11:22] owed business specifically is that families think about generations they think

[11:27] about passing it down between you know father and son parents and kids right

[11:32] they like those businesses because they don't cut quarters they think about

[11:36] quality they think about long term investment long term preventative strategy they're

[11:40] not thinking about quarterly earnings and you know

[11:43] basically short term gratification which is what most of the stock market companies are

[11:48] forced to do because they have to pay to stockholders right and so if you

[11:55] can't I've talked about this to buy their podcast shifting from CEO to investor but

[11:59] were the most beneficial things that I have done for my mental health and for the

[12:02] success of my business is thinking in a long term type of mindset and I can't tell you

[12:07] that I'll tell you that of the people that I encounter the longer their

[12:10] type of advice that they talk in the wealthier borst successful they are invariably

[12:16] so what I talked to somebody and all they're thinking about is this week and the next

[12:19] two weeks pay roll and what they're going to make this month and last but I already know

[12:22] that they don't make a time right and it's because that's all they think it right and then

[12:28] they can get from there you get to a slightly higher level on twitter so they're thinking

[12:31] in quarters okay this quarter this we're we can't focus anything this quarter is all we

[12:35] got this is what we get it right and that's fine because of the smaller you are the less

[12:38] stable you are more volatile right but over time as you expand those horizons right you'll be

[12:43] able to make better decisions because you'll start thinking well if I did this for five

[12:47] string years would it be reasonable that I would win probably right if I do this consistently for

[12:53] five years do I think that I would it would be unreasonable that I will be able to be

[12:56] far passed by by my goal probably right but most people still think in these tiny chunks of time

[13:01] and can never get ahead and they spend month after month after month after month for third

[13:05] third or third years trying to become millionaires rather than just set a goal of like well

[13:09] let me just see if I can increase by it by income by twenty thousand dollars in the next year

[13:14] right and then next year after that I'll try to increase it by another twenty thousand dollars

[13:17] and they do that by you know and in five years do you have a top one percent income but

[13:23] only ninety nine percent of people don't think that way which is why only one percent do

[13:27] so anyways number one for the baddest ones that they're risk of earth they will take me will take

[13:31] the loss they will not take the opportunity to avoid the loss number two they think a

[13:37] long term horizons right and number three they have unimpeachable character

[13:44] which I just really like that as a word unimpeachable character and if you listen to

[13:54] words talk about about about about losing money he said if you lose money that will be forgiven

[14:01] he said but if you lose me a shred of reputation I will be ruthless and he's he's so so big on this

[14:08] and I think that's you know these these these these kind of three things come together people who have unimpeachable

[14:13] character are not trying to get rich quick right they're trying to build something of value they're

[14:18] trying to build something that's enduring something that's a long term and uh and they're honest

[14:24] and so what happens though is that when you have an impeachable character it's actually an

[14:28] intangible that has compounding returns and I'll explain what I mean that but he he talks about it

[14:33] for his own business he's like the fact that our checks always clear that we we do what we say we're

[14:38] going to do allow us to get access to more deals because more people want to work with us right

[14:44] and we do we close deals faster and so the thing is is that your reputation over time becomes a

[14:49] competitive advantage and that's what what say unique that's a sustainable and compounding competitive

[14:55] advantage because somebody who's stuck with their word for 10 years compared to somebody stuck with their

[14:59] word for 30 years who's word is worth more the 30 year guy so we just stuck with you know who's

[15:04] done everything and but on a peachable character for 30 years compared to guys done it for 60 years

[15:07] who is the stronger word the 60 year guy it's something that if you can develop it literally compounds

[15:13] with time and it's it's it has been it's priceless and I think he's a very good value where of

[15:19] things and so anyways the perfect business model I'll give you a quick recap it's unique expensive

[15:26] sticking year that's bandaged by somebody whose risk of worse long term thinking has unappetable

[15:32] all right so something that you can create for a penny self or a buck that's habit for me

[15:37] that no one else can do and you do it it's such a way that you don't take short term risks you

[15:43] think long term in terms of how you're going to invest in the business in the legacy

[15:48] and building something of value and not not obsessed with short term volatility but for a long

[15:52] term earning it finally that you do it it's such a way that people will think everything that

[15:58] this man has done has been fairly earned and wisely used and so with that I will leave you with

[16:03] the perfect business I hope you enjoyed this so be careful this is one of my favorite thanks to

[16:07] talk about and keep big awesome and if you're in the arena keep getting up my promise you will

[16:13] get better over time bless a love I can she I said bye

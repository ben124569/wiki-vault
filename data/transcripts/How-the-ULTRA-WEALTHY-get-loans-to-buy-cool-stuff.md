[00:00] In this video, I'm going to talk you about the number one strategy for the ultra-walty

[00:02] two avoid taxes and get the lowest interest rate, loans, humanly, possible, or even

[00:07] a marginal or favorable two humans.

[00:09] If you don't know how I am, my name is Oxamoz, and I ownacrisis.com, it's a portfolio of

[00:12] companies that are 100 million dollars a year.

[00:14] I make these videos because I'm insane, I like being in wife feeders in a closet.

[00:17] I'm kidding, I make these because a lot of people are broken, I don't want to be on them.

[00:19] I too was broke for a very long period of time and it sucked.

[00:21] And so I hope that we can at least attenuate that situation so that you can then

[00:24] ask the large questions of what is even worth it to begin with and you can come to those conclusions

[00:28] on your own.

[00:29] How do I get one to two percent loans or as they call them margin?

[00:34] Lones on margin, two by shit, or buy more assets or whatever.

[00:38] So quick overview of what this topic is.

[00:40] You've heard me maybe talk about this in other videos which is like if you have let's say

[00:44] $100,000 in stocks, you have $100,000 in stocks depending on who you work with.

[00:50] If you work with them more established bank and you have a longer relationship with them,

[00:53] let's say you bank or you do wealth management with marriage, you will have a banker

[00:57] and they will tell you how to do this.

[00:59] But I'm guessing that if you ask the question in your curious, you click on this video,

[01:01] you don't have that.

[01:03] So those banks will typically give 50, 60, sometimes 65 percent of the total assets in

[01:08] your portfolio as a asset backed loan, which is a margin based loan.

[01:12] And so that means that if I had $100,000 and I had 65 percent that I could take as a loan,

[01:16] then I could get an additional $65,000 at one to two percent.

[01:19] Which is crazy.

[01:20] Mind you, the interest rates can change over time but for a very long period of time, it's

[01:23] been one to two percent.

[01:24] Which is very, very, very low.

[01:26] And the nice thing about this is that there's no closing costs, there's no fees, there's

[01:28] no startups, there's no nothing.

[01:29] You just pay the interest while you hold the money and all you have to do is pay back and

[01:33] then you're interested for payment stuff.

[01:34] All right.

[01:35] So it's nice as a revolving credit line for stuff that you want to make a quick purchase

[01:37] and then give it back, right?

[01:39] That is how it's YouTube buying on margin.

[01:41] That's where the term comes from.

[01:42] Many of you guys have asked, how do I actually do this?

[01:45] Great question.

[01:46] So what we're going to do is we're going to travel together through the realms of time and

[01:49] we're going to use this new, mystical thing.

[01:51] And I want to teach this process to you because I think that it's very, very valuable.

[01:55] And also, serve you for answering any of the questions that you have in your life.

[01:59] Google.

[02:00] All right.

[02:01] So take loans against stocks.

[02:03] Let's see here.

[02:04] Oh, look, it looks like there's a lot of people who are willing to do this for us.

[02:06] Let's see if Alex did something ahead of time.

[02:08] He sure did.

[02:09] We clicked this guy and let's see what it says.

[02:11] They explained a little bit more how useful.

[02:13] And if I wanted to borrow on margin, that the, the apply for margin, that's all you have

[02:18] to do.

[02:19] And if you're like, well, I don't bank with fidelity.

[02:20] Well, I'll bet you that wherever you bank, they do this.

[02:23] Now let's say Robinhood, margin, margin, oops, margin loves.

[02:28] There we go.

[02:29] Let's look here.

[02:30] What is margin investing?

[02:31] Let's click.

[02:32] They give us an answer.

[02:33] Unlike as a deposits, blah, blah, blah.

[02:34] You can upgrade to Robinhood gold.

[02:36] That's how we have to do it.

[02:37] And that will allow you to then borrow on margin.

[02:40] And so all you have to do is sign up upgrade to Robinhood gold.

[02:43] Let's see what it does.

[02:44] That's the, all right.

[02:45] And so a reason I do this is because sometimes I get questions that have answers that

[02:49] are Googleable.

[02:50] And so please for the love of God.

[02:51] And one of the best ways to stay poor is to have a question and then not Google the answer.

[02:55] Post a comment in something and then say, well, I guess I scratch my answer.

[02:58] I ask the question, no, find the answer, right?

[03:00] And so the reason that this, by margin-based loans, things like that are useful is that they're tax-free.

[03:05] All right.

[03:06] So if you wanted to pay for stuff, and this is what the UltraWalty do.

[03:08] When they go IPO and they've got a billion dollars for the stock and something, they just take loans against those stocks.

[03:12] They don't have to pay income tax.

[03:14] They take loans against the stock.

[03:15] They buy stuff in the amount that the stock goes up your year exceeds what they borrowed.

[03:20] They can borrow more.

[03:21] And then keep doing that until they die and never pay taxes.

[03:23] All right.

[03:24] That's how this works.

[03:25] Now the risks.

[03:26] So the risks of doing this are that let's say for some reason you borrowed at, and I think there's other one.

[03:33] There's like M1 finance.

[03:34] I think is one that I heard of that does up to 35 percent.

[03:38] And the percentage is very based on the size of your portfolio, how long you've been doing business.

[03:41] Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

[03:42] Right.

[03:43] And so it's usually 30 to 60 percent ish.

[03:45] All right.

[03:46] And so let's say that you took out a 60 percent.

[03:48] Let's pop you out right on your $100,000.

[03:50] Let's say that you're portfolio because of a crash in the marketplace drops to $50,000.

[03:54] So you took 60.

[03:56] Right.

[03:57] And now your portfolios were 50.

[03:58] Well, to be an accordance with the risk tolerance that they have, you need to be 60 percent

[04:04] of the new 50,000 value, which means that's 30,000 dollars of material out to borrow.

[04:09] Which means you have to pay back the 30 of the 60 that you borrowed originally.

[04:14] And if you don't have the money, they sell your shit.

[04:17] Hmm.

[04:18] Crazy.

[04:19] I know.

[04:20] It sucks.

[04:21] That being said, that is the risk.

[04:22] And that is why people lose their asses on margin.

[04:24] Now, as a quick transition to this, the reason, and you might ask Alex, do you borrow

[04:28] or margin?

[04:29] I have in the past, I have also repaid it back quickly.

[04:31] I tend to use margin for very short-term type things.

[04:34] So like six months, 12 months, transaction stuff.

[04:37] So like if I do like private lending for hard money loans, things like that, that's a perfect thing for me.

[04:41] So it's like, if I'm making 12 percent or 15 or 20 percent on the money from a hard money loan,

[04:46] I can borrow at one to two, and I know I'm going to get paid back in the money that I'm

[04:49] lending out.

[04:50] I'm securing against another asset.

[04:52] So if they don't pay me back, I could get the asset and then I can sell the asset and pay back.

[04:55] Right?

[04:56] That's how I do it.

[04:57] That being said, I am not a cute, like at this current moment, this current juncture in time,

[05:01] I have zero debt, not even a mortgage.

[05:02] And we'll be like, Alex, you're crazy.

[05:04] Probably.

[05:05] But for me, I sleep really well at night, knowing that I just don't own anyone anything.

[05:09] And for me, the objective of money was freedom.

[05:11] Not more money.

[05:12] Just decide no.

[05:13] I do subscribe to something Dave Ramsey said that really resonates with me.

[05:16] He said, I'm paraphrasing, that debt is a version of risk.

[05:21] And risk, if extended over a long enough time horizon, exposes you to zero, meaning you could

[05:25] lose it all.

[05:26] And since life is long, that means that there is a high possibility between now and the time you

[05:30] die, that you do have one of these situations where you could get exposed to zero.

[05:33] And for me, I would rather not sacrifice what I do have and that I do want and need for

[05:37] more of something that I don't want or necessarily don't need.

[05:40] Because me doubling my money makes no difference in my life, but me losing all my money makes a very

[05:44] big difference.

[05:45] And so for me, why risk something that I don't want to lose for something that I don't need?

[05:48] And so for that reason, I have been not a big leverage proponent in general.

[05:52] I am very, very under-leverage in general.

[05:54] All right. And so I have run my life that way and I focused my life on increasing the value of the

[05:58] assets that I have.

[05:59] I'm just continuing to do that rather than juice everything through debt.

[06:02] And that's just not my game.

[06:03] Personally, I'm still a nine figuring it worth without any of that.

[06:06] And so I think you can do it.

[06:07] And maybe I'm selling, which is very possible.

[06:09] And maybe when I'm 60, I'll think that I was an absolute idiot for thinking that way.

[06:12] It's very possible.

[06:13] Because you know what?

[06:14] We learn things and we grow up.

[06:16] But as current state, Alex in 2022, April, I don't think that.

[06:21] So anyways, keep being awesome, keep crushing imagination.

[06:24] I hope they give you some illumination to like how do you do margin loans.

[06:27] My recommendation to you is a final parting words and disclaimer around this is that if you

[06:31] were going to partake in this risk, okay?

[06:34] Because it is risk, borrow significantly less than the limit.

[06:37] All right.

[06:38] So if you want to use the, you know, borrow on margin, borrow 10% or 20% tops, keep it way

[06:43] underneath so that there's literally no way that a margin code come up.

[06:46] We actually have to sell some of your stuff.

[06:48] Because the thing is is the moment when they get you to sell it is the moment when it's worth

[06:53] the least.

[06:54] All right.

[06:55] So you get double host.

[06:56] All right.

[06:57] So you lose the power of the money that you had.

[06:58] And then you have to sell stuff at a massive loss.

[07:00] All right.

[07:01] So that's when you want to be buying and instead you're selling.

[07:03] And that's what crashes markets.

[07:04] A lot of people borrow that way.

[07:06] And they ride the bull and bear cycles.

[07:07] And we want to be a little smarter and try not to do whatever everyone else is doing

[07:10] so that we can have what no one else has.

[07:12] All right.

[07:13] So most of the nation keeping awesome.

[07:14] I make these videos because I enjoy it.

[07:16] Apparently.

[07:17] And I do this because, you know, maybe some of you guys will crush it and cross through

[07:21] million or 10 million and want to work with us at acquisition.com so we can get you

[07:25] to 50 and beyond.

[07:26] So keeping awesome.

[07:27] Love you all.

[07:28] See you next video.

[07:29] Bye.

[00:00] I've been marketing for 13 years.

[00:01] I built and sold nine companies.

[00:02] I sold my last company for $46.2 million to American Pacific Group.

[00:06] I've also written two books on marketing that have sold over a million copies.

[00:09] Here's 13 years of marketing advice that will make you more money.

[00:12] Peace of advice, number one.

[00:13] Start with low prices or even gas-free.

[00:17] The reason that I say that is because if you start there, then you can go up.

[00:21] It's very difficult to come down.

[00:23] And in the beginning, you want to get flow through the system.

[00:26] And so it's totally fine to start it free

[00:28] and then start bumping up from there.

[00:30] And so I'll give you three quick examples

[00:31] and I'll show you how to do this tactically.

[00:33] So when I started my first ever business, it was an online personal training business.

[00:37] This is 13 plus years ago.

[00:38] And when I started, I didn't know anything

[00:40] and I was so afraid to charge people money to begin with.

[00:43] And so, but I did want them to pay something

[00:45] because I wanted them to be invested

[00:47] because otherwise people don't follow through with their workouts,

[00:49] or their nutrition plans, et cetera.

[00:50] And so I said, hey, just donate to the charity of your choice.

[00:53] Whatever charity you want to, in exchange, I will then train you for 12 weeks.

[00:57] And so people would donate, I think, who's $500,000

[01:01] there choice to a charity of their selection.

[01:03] And by doing that, I actually got my first 13 or so customers just

[01:06] by making posts and DMing people that I knew.

[01:09] And it didn't feel weird because I was like, hey, I'm doing this kind

[01:11] of nonprofit thing.

[01:12] I want to help you out if you want to lose weight.

[01:13] And you can feel good about it and it's right off.

[01:15] And so we were like, oh, this is pretty cool.

[01:17] But the thing is, that was the first time I ever did it.

[01:19] And then from there, I said, huh, would you guys be willing to pay me

[01:23] now after we finish this 12 weeks?

[01:24] And a lot of them were like, sure, I was like, yeah, I'm the charity now.

[01:27] And so after I did a good job, they were willing to do that

[01:29] and refer me customers.

[01:31] The next business that I did this was Jim launch when I actually

[01:34] started flying out to other gyms.

[01:37] So I used to do turnaround.

[01:38] And I did that for two plus years, so I'd

[01:40] fly out to a gym, set up all the pricing, do the marketing

[01:42] and all the stuff.

[01:42] And I did it all for free.

[01:43] And I did it that way because I didn't know how I could sell

[01:48] those Jim owners.

[01:48] And the deal that I made was I only make money if I make sales.

[01:53] And I'll front the cash for the marketing.

[01:55] So they took zero risk on.

[01:56] And I would do everything, including pay from my hotel, my flights, my food,

[02:00] my rental car, everything.

[02:02] And but being able to do that, it allowed me to get way more

[02:05] yes, as quickly test out the system in 30 plus markets that I had,

[02:08] which then eventually led me to license and that system to 5,000

[02:11] plus locations.

[02:12] And that was the company that I sold to APG.

[02:14] The third time that I did this was when I started

[02:17] by software company Allen.

[02:18] And so when I started the company, I was like, I need to get

[02:21] some case studies.

[02:22] They need some testimonials.

[02:23] And I need some stories to show successes.

[02:25] And so I think a lot of people in the beginning

[02:27] think this is only a big inner thing.

[02:28] But even if you're a big business owner,

[02:30] when you start out a new product or new division,

[02:33] starting with free customers just makes a lot of sense.

[02:35] And it's for four reasons.

[02:37] One is that free customers become customers

[02:40] who become paying after the period as long as you do a good job.

[02:42] So it makes money in one way.

[02:44] The second way makes you money is that they'll also

[02:46] refer your customers because you do a great job.

[02:48] They'll just send you other people.

[02:49] And that can be contingent on why you do it for free for them.

[02:51] The third is that they'll leave you testimonials and reviews.

[02:54] So those reviews and those testimonials also,

[02:56] you advertise and you can get more customers from them.

[02:58] And then finally, whenever you do stuff for free,

[03:00] I do it in exchange for feedback.

[03:02] I say, hey, tell me what I could do to make this better.

[03:04] And again, it's not saying like, tell me all the ways I suck.

[03:07] It's just saying, tell me how I can make this better.

[03:09] Tell me how I could make it worth it for you to want to stay

[03:11] and continue to pay.

[03:12] And ideally, the easy test of knowing

[03:15] whether this works is that they actually stay and pay

[03:18] afterwards.

[03:19] And so it's the easiest way to get going on any new product.

[03:24] And I think so many people start trying to sell stuff too soon

[03:27] without enough proof.

[03:29] And in the beginning, you suck.

[03:30] That's why it's a new product, your new division.

[03:32] And so I'd rather not ruin my reputation.

[03:34] Sam, giving away for free, give the reason

[03:36] is the brand new at this thing or I'm trying this new thing out.

[03:38] And that way, I'll get a little bit of grace.

[03:40] And then that way, I can make the thing better in an iterative process.

[03:43] Much faster with way more people

[03:44] because I'm giving away for free or at cost.

[03:47] And then once I get those massive success stories

[03:50] that they feel like they owe me because I've done a great job,

[03:52] then I can market those and go at full price.

[03:55] So here's how you actually do this tactically

[03:57] going from starting a low price to moving all the way to where

[04:00] you want to be, which is high prices with big premiums.

[04:03] And so what I'd say is after you have your first test

[04:06] case study batch, so call it 10 or 20 people,

[04:08] depending on the size of your product or your services.

[04:11] After that, every five, I just go up by 20%.

[04:14] And so let's say, OK, I started at zero.

[04:16] And I have a marketing agency.

[04:17] I might say, OK, the first, the next five

[04:19] I've been to do for 1,000 bucks.

[04:21] And then from there, I might say, OK, the next five,

[04:23] I'm going to do for 1,200 bucks.

[04:25] The next five, I'm going to do for 1,500 bucks.

[04:27] And so you just keep going up by 20% until the conversion rate

[04:31] times the price goes down.

[04:33] So that way, you can just calculate the total amount of money

[04:34] made off of X number of sales calls.

[04:36] And by doing that, you'll be able to see, OK,

[04:38] here's the sweet spot where I sell the most amount of units

[04:41] at the highest potential price.

[04:42] So my company Jim Lange that has sold for $46 million,

[04:45] that company, at its peak before I was selling it,

[04:49] we were taking over a million dollars a month in personal income.

[04:52] But that's what a lot of people think

[04:53] happened the whole time.

[04:54] But it wasn't like that.

[04:55] The actual very first business that I started in fitness

[04:58] I actually gave away my services for free.

[05:00] Actually, did it as a nonprofit for charities

[05:02] so that I could get clients in the door

[05:04] and test out whether my stuff actually

[05:05] worked and that I could deliver services.

[05:07] And when you're having the conversation with those first few

[05:10] people, whether you're doing it for free,

[05:11] or are you going to do it for a big discount,

[05:13] you say, hey, I plan on going to this price point.

[05:15] But I'm willing to do it for free in exchange for X,

[05:18] which is usually a feedback,

[05:19] feedback for me, and a public testimony

[05:21] for comfortable doing it.

[05:23] And by having those two things, then one,

[05:25] you guarantee that you get the feedback,

[05:27] which is thing you need most.

[05:28] But you also can get the testimony that you can leverage.

[05:30] And then finally, you can also tack on a referral if you want to.

[05:34] Again, I'd say the testimony in the referral

[05:36] should be contingent on you doing a good job.

[05:38] And you say, hey, if I do a good job,

[05:39] would you be willing to do these two things?

[05:41] If they say yes, then you're good to go.

[05:43] The fourth one, it was just, do they actually

[05:45] want to buy at full price later,

[05:47] which will be the real test of how good you are?

[05:49] And I think the bottom line here is that when you start out,

[05:51] you're not that good.

[05:52] And even if your ego is kind of convincing you

[05:54] that you are good, which I think is silly,

[05:57] just even imagine two years from now

[05:58] that you're going to be much better than you are now.

[06:00] Well, that guy is probably way more experienced.

[06:02] So give that guy a running start by starting free now

[06:06] and then building momentum into it.

[06:07] And I have this saying that I repeat all the time

[06:09] in my team, which is create flow, monetize flow,

[06:12] then add friction.

[06:14] And so it's like you have to run water through the machine.

[06:16] You have to get flow into the system

[06:17] to see where it's going to break so that you know

[06:20] what real actually looks like,

[06:22] rather than just trying to get rich on Excel.

[06:23] The second is the framework that I use

[06:26] for scaling, advertising, or scaling marketing in any niche.

[06:29] More, better, new.

[06:31] When you're starting out, more is almost always the answer.

[06:34] And so I remember when I was thinking about getting into content,

[06:39] I paid someone who had made a lot more content,

[06:42] I had much bigger brand and I said, hey, what should I be doing?

[06:45] I like what should I do to make my content better?

[06:47] And he's like, dude, he's like, you don't make your content better.

[06:49] He's like, you're just not making anything.

[06:50] And so what he did was he pulled up his profile on LinkedIn

[06:53] and he pulled up my profile on LinkedIn.

[06:54] And he was like, I posted five times a day.

[06:56] You haven't even posted.

[06:58] And then he pulled up Instagram.

[06:59] And he pulled up my Instagram.

[07:00] And he was like, I posted two times a day.

[07:02] You posted once a week.

[07:03] I was like, man, he's like, okay, let's pull up YouTube.

[07:06] And then my YouTube.

[07:07] And he just went platform by platform.

[07:09] And he showed that he was doing three X,

[07:10] five X, 10 X the volume that I was.

[07:12] And he was like, dude, you just got to do more.

[07:15] And that was this like, I felt embarrassed

[07:17] because I just paid all this money to have someone just

[07:19] look at me and just say do more.

[07:20] But hopefully I can save you the money and just tell you,

[07:22] you probably need to do more.

[07:24] And the interesting thing about this is that I later

[07:27] on had like at the point now when we had maybe,

[07:30] this is me a year ago, I had five-ish million subscribers

[07:32] called All Platforms.

[07:33] I had a friend of mine who's a billionaire

[07:35] who wanted to start getting into personal branding.

[07:37] And he said, hey, man, can you check out my Instagram

[07:39] and see what's going on and why we're not growing as fast

[07:42] as I want to?

[07:43] And so I said, well, before I look at it,

[07:45] I was like, how many posts do we

[07:46] are making across all platforms?

[07:47] He's like, oh, got that now.

[07:48] He's like, I'm posting once a day.

[07:50] And I was like, dude, I was like, we post 50 plus times a day.

[07:53] And he was like, got it.

[07:55] He just was like, you don't need to say anymore.

[07:57] I understand.

[07:58] Because he had had enough experience in other realms

[08:00] to know that like, oh, all of the things

[08:03] involving that work in sales, that working,

[08:05] customer success, that working product

[08:07] in terms of iterations, the same concepts

[08:09] applied to advertising and marketing.

[08:11] Like, you just need to do a lot in order

[08:13] to figure out what works so that you can do better later.

[08:17] Now, what's interesting about this

[08:18] is that this also applies on the paid side.

[08:20] So I remember there was a car factor, a car factor,

[08:22] agency that approached me.

[08:23] There were doing about 2 million bucks a year.

[08:25] And he was like, hey, man, I think I've saturated Facebook.

[08:29] And so I can, this is when it was Facebook, not meta.

[08:31] And I was like, what do you mean?

[08:33] He's like, I just think I've saturated the car factor in it.

[08:35] And I was like, this is a 10 billion dollar year industry.

[08:39] And you feel like you're $2 million per your agency

[08:42] has saturated Facebook.

[08:45] Like how many, I was like, do you know

[08:46] of any of the car factor agencies that exist?

[08:48] You just like, yeah, there's loads.

[08:49] It's like, you know, there's hundreds of them.

[08:50] I was like, okay.

[08:51] So explain to me why every sale that is keeping all of them

[08:55] in business is somehow not sales that you should be making.

[08:59] He was like, god, it.

[09:00] I was like, right, you're spending 40 grand a month

[09:02] when in aggregate all the agencies

[09:04] that are selling to car factors are probably spending 4 million a month.

[09:07] And so all of the spend that those businesses

[09:10] are able to make in your market is your opportunity.

[09:13] If you can outcompete them, you can provide better service.

[09:16] You can have longer LTV, I mean,

[09:17] so you can spend more to acquire the customer than they can.

[09:19] And then you can eventually price them out of the marketplace.

[09:21] Because fundamentally paid ads is actually an auction for attention.

[09:24] And so people bid against each other for ad space.

[09:27] And so if you can outbage your competition,

[09:29] you can have an ethical monopoly by literally bidding more

[09:31] than everyone else while still making money.

[09:34] And that's the crazy thing.

[09:34] And that's what fundamentally what you want to build

[09:37] in terms of the mouth-trap your business is,

[09:38] how can I make more money from every customer

[09:40] than anyone else does?

[09:41] So that I can spend more than anyone else can to acquire them.

[09:43] And so I had a portfolio company, who's a good marker,

[09:47] you know, come up to me and he was like,

[09:48] hey man, I think really new scalar ads.

[09:50] And I was like, I had great.

[09:51] And I was like, well, how many pieces of creative are you putting

[09:55] out per week?

[09:56] And he was like, oh, why just record once a month?

[09:58] I was like, okay, fine, then how many ads are you making

[10:00] per session?

[10:02] We do about 15.

[10:02] So we do about 15 new ads per month.

[10:05] And I just kind of looked at him as like, dude,

[10:07] when I was trying to go from your size to five times

[10:10] your size, I was making 35 a week.

[10:13] And like, nowadays we make way more than that

[10:15] in terms of content and in terms of the ads that we do,

[10:18] like, as I make ads for school,

[10:20] and then I inform the ads across our portfolio.

[10:22] And so the big saying that I have that's like,

[10:25] plastered on the wall that actually applies to sales

[10:27] and marketing is volume negates luck.

[10:31] Like if you don't want to rely on luck

[10:33] and rely on one of those 10 ads or five ads

[10:35] that you make to be amazing, you just make more ads.

[10:39] And I can't tell you the amount of times

[10:40] that it just reset the bar.

[10:41] And that's what I'm hoping to do with this video.

[10:43] It's like the amount of volume that the people who are ahead

[10:45] of you are doing is not two extra three x more.

[10:47] It's oftentimes a hundred x more.

[10:50] Right, even the 35 times four, I think 140 pieces,

[10:54] the guy was making 15.

[10:56] It was nine x, the volume of what he was doing.

[11:00] And some of you guys are making five ads a month,

[11:02] or one out a month, and thinking that that's somehow

[11:04] going to be sufficient to get to your goals.

[11:07] And nowadays and I'll explain later in this

[11:09] health, my whole ad creation process,

[11:10] but just the big headline is that in the very beginning,

[11:13] you just need to do a lot more than you think you do.

[11:16] The second is once you've done more,

[11:18] then at what point you start shifting to better.

[11:20] And the way that you can figure that out

[11:22] is when the return on effort for better

[11:25] exceeds one incremental unit of more, meaning.

[11:29] If I've got one sales guy, if I had a second sales guy,

[11:32] then I think I have a high degree of certainty

[11:34] that I can probably double my sales by doing that.

[11:37] But when you have 10 sales guys adding one more sales

[11:39] guys the same level of effort as adding going from one to two,

[11:42] going from 10 to 11, but it's only a 10% increase.

[11:45] And so if I can increase the overall throughput of my entire team

[11:48] by 20% or 25% by tweaking some sharp rate stuff

[11:52] for doing a headlines split test or changing CTAs on my ads,

[11:56] then those are things that would make me more money

[11:59] per unit of effort.

[12:01] And so in the beginning, you usually just need to blow

[12:03] as much volume through there as possible.

[12:04] That's the create flow monetized flow than ad friction.

[12:07] The optimization steps really only matter

[12:10] when you have flow going through.

[12:11] And so you do more first.

[12:13] And then once you're big enough,

[12:14] better becomes a better return on effort.

[12:16] But once you then go through the better steps,

[12:18] then you usually have to go back to,

[12:20] OK, how do we do 10 times more than we are now?

[12:22] How do we go from 10 sales guys to 100 sales guys?

[12:25] And that's the thinking that you have to go through

[12:27] in order to start scaling in terms of orders of magnitude.

[12:30] And when you have so much volume,

[12:32] you're able to iterate so much faster.

[12:34] Like even us recently, we started making more content on YouTube.

[12:38] And we already noticed as a team, we're like,

[12:40] oh, this is awesome.

[12:41] We're learning so much faster again with,

[12:43] like we're literally putting out four or five videos

[12:45] a week instead of one video week.

[12:47] And so we're learning about headlines and thumbnails.

[12:49] And there's less pressure per video

[12:50] because we're like, cool, learn that.

[12:52] Let's move on to the next one.

[12:53] And so it allows you to just iterate

[12:55] so much faster without getting your ego

[12:56] and your emotions tied into it.

[12:58] Here's how I do it.

[12:59] Is I asked the question, what would stop me

[13:02] from 10x in the business right now?

[13:04] And if the answer is nothing, then we tend to the business.

[13:07] Now, most times there is something that would break.

[13:10] Like what would break first?

[13:11] And so as soon as we identify, what is the first thing

[13:13] that would break if we two x, five x, 10x?

[13:16] We then isolate that thing, put all of our focus towards fixing it.

[13:19] And then we do the increase in volume.

[13:22] And that is how we continue to deconstrain

[13:25] until we go to the next bottleneck

[13:26] and then deconstrain that and then grow into the next bottleneck

[13:28] because we have a fundamental belief

[13:30] that all businesses will continue to grow

[13:31] until their point of constraint

[13:32] and then they will grow no further.

[13:33] So you identify the constraint,

[13:35] relieve the constraint and allow it to grow again.

[13:36] Growth occurs as an after effect of the inputs

[13:39] you put into the system.

[13:41] Now, once you've done as much as you can, more,

[13:44] and you've done it as well as you can, better.

[13:46] When you can't do any more, any better,

[13:47] you start and try something new.

[13:49] And the reason that I have new last

[13:52] is because the cost of change of doing something new

[13:55] is guaranteed, but the return on something new is not.

[13:58] And so I like to say that it's a big warning for the fact

[14:01] that the vast majority of entrepreneurs

[14:02] want to spend 80% of their time on doing new stuff

[14:05] when really they should spend 90% of their time

[14:08] doing more and better of what is already working for them.

[14:11] The only time you do new stuff is when nothing is working.

[14:13] So when you're starting as an entrepreneur, everything's new

[14:15] and you keep trying and keep trying until something works.

[14:18] Once it works, you have to unlearn the whole experimentation

[14:21] idea and then you have to go great.

[14:22] I need to do as much as I possibly can and do it as well

[14:25] as I possibly can.

[14:26] And so it's a different mindset that you have to get into,

[14:28] but that's how you start scaling.

[14:29] Now, what point do you start doing something new?

[14:32] Well, if you've already said, okay, I can't do more

[14:35] for a very clear reason if there's a big cost.

[14:37] Like sometimes there's a huge incremental cost

[14:40] past a certain barrier.

[14:41] You're like, okay, I think we really are,

[14:44] let's say you're a local, a local gym, all right?

[14:46] If you're a local gym and you're spending

[14:48] call it $10,000 a month on ads,

[14:50] you're reaching every single person in your radius

[14:53] multiple times a week.

[14:54] And so that's on one platform.

[14:56] And so you're like, okay, in order for me to scale this,

[14:59] it's not really about doing more or even doing that better.

[15:01] It's like I've saturated the crap out of the eyeballs here.

[15:04] Well, that's when doing something new

[15:07] will yield a higher return to get a better return on effort.

[15:09] And so that's where like, okay,

[15:11] maybe I'm gonna start doing an outbound.

[15:12] Or I'll start doing the paid ads,

[15:14] but just on another channel, I'll start running YouTube ads,

[15:16] I'll start running Google search ads,

[15:17] I'll start running, I'll start running display ads,

[15:21] I'll start, I'll start doing direct mail pieces.

[15:24] I'll start radio ads.

[15:25] Like there's a number of things

[15:25] that you could do in terms of other channels,

[15:27] but they would be new.

[15:28] And so this is the thought process

[15:29] that I have when I approach that,

[15:31] which is if you could double the sales of your company

[15:34] and it would take a year, would you do it?

[15:37] But you had to wait a year before they doubled.

[15:39] Most people would say yes.

[15:40] If I said you had to invest, call it half a year's profits

[15:44] in order to get your business to double, would you do it?

[15:46] Yes, that probably would be a really good return

[15:47] on an investment.

[15:49] If you put half year's profits

[15:50] and you double the business,

[15:51] you're getting a 200% return, that's awesome.

[15:53] And so the thing is that people start something new

[15:56] and they spend one month of ads spend,

[15:58] and they say, oh, it didn't work, I lost money.

[16:01] Well, I'm gonna stop, but the reality is that it's gonna take you

[16:04] three months, six months, sometimes 12 months,

[16:06] to get that return to actually pay off

[16:09] and what I mark is progress, not the dollar.

[16:13] So it's like, okay, first are we getting clicks?

[16:15] Okay, we're getting clicks.

[16:16] Okay, are we getting off-tins?

[16:18] Okay, we're getting off-tins.

[16:19] Are the off-tins we're getting the right type of people

[16:20] that we're looking for?

[16:21] Okay, yes.

[16:22] Or if they're not, then we start tweaking the messaging

[16:24] and we start tweaking the funnel

[16:25] until we get the right people.

[16:26] Okay, now we have the right people who are opting in.

[16:28] Great, now can we get them on the phone?

[16:29] Can we get them in person?

[16:30] Can we get them to show up

[16:31] to some sort of conversion event,

[16:32] some sales event that we can then try and sell them something.

[16:34] And so you keep walking, walking the dollar over the bridge

[16:38] until eventually it comes to the other side.

[16:39] But that takes money and that takes time

[16:42] and that takes learning, but it's a return on investment

[16:44] because if you do double your lead flow in a year,

[16:49] one, it doubles the business.

[16:51] Two, it more than doubles the value of the business

[16:53] because now you have two different ways to get customers

[16:56] and so it makes the business more stable

[16:57] because if one of them goes down,

[16:59] then you still have the other one.

[17:00] And so you have a more stable business that's also bigger.

[17:02] Market Vice number three, how to do better.

[17:05] And so this is double clicking into the better concept

[17:07] because this is especially for the bigger business owner.

[17:09] So if you're at a few million dollars a year

[17:11] to 10 million dollars a year,

[17:13] like this is really going to start paying massive dividends.

[17:15] So number one is optimize front to back

[17:18] when it comes to marketing.

[17:20] So that's the 80, 20.

[17:21] So David Ogavis said famously,

[17:23] after you've written your headline,

[17:24] you spent 80 cents of your advertising dollar.

[17:27] So he knew that 80% of people aren't going to do anything

[17:30] past read the headline.

[17:31] And so he'd put 80% of his effort towards those first few words.

[17:35] And the really experienced marketers

[17:37] who are watching this are nodding their heads right now.

[17:39] The first five seconds, the headline, the packaging.

[17:43] In my history of the 13 years that I've been doing this,

[17:45] has only increased.

[17:46] I haven't even gotten to a sweet spot.

[17:47] They just continue to become more and more important

[17:50] in my mind because it's the frame through which everyone

[17:53] contextualizes what they're about to consume.

[17:55] So one, it increases the likelihood they consume it.

[17:57] Two, it introduces the frame that they consume the advertisement

[18:01] or the promotion through.

[18:02] And like we now have such great data.

[18:05] Which is even across on the content side,

[18:07] that like if we have two different thumbnails,

[18:09] you can literally see the average view duration go up

[18:12] by two or three minutes sometimes,

[18:14] simply by changing the thumb that people click

[18:17] before they watch the video.

[18:18] It's wild.

[18:19] And so how people, the frame that people consume the content in

[18:22] has a massive impact on how effective it is.

[18:25] Now, until you quick story to show you just

[18:27] how important this is.

[18:29] So a friend of mine, Dean had this massive advertising campaign.

[18:33] And he had written a new book and he went on Larry King Life.

[18:37] And so he wanted to use the Larry King interview

[18:40] to advertise the book.

[18:43] And so he shot the whole interview.

[18:45] And he basically wanted Larry King to introduce him in a cool way

[18:49] to make him sound cool, of course.

[18:51] Like he would laugh if I'm telling the story now.

[18:54] And so he knew that the ad was killer.

[18:56] And so he ran it.

[18:58] But 250 grand and nothing came back.

[19:01] And he was like, what's going on?

[19:02] Like I know this, I know this ad's a killer.

[19:05] Like what's happening?

[19:06] So we went back through his old history of ads.

[19:09] And he looked at the top of the means ads he'd ever done.

[19:11] And as soon as he started watching me realize that he missed the hook

[19:14] that the hook was wrong.

[19:16] And so he flew Larry King back out.

[19:19] They paid him again.

[19:20] They set up a whole new set.

[19:22] Again, just to re-record the first 30 seconds.

[19:27] And so they re-recorded the first 30 seconds

[19:29] with the hour-long interview.

[19:31] And then re-rand the infirmary show and did a hundred million

[19:34] in sales.

[19:36] And so when I heard that story, I was like, this is why

[19:40] that the first five seconds, the headline, the hook,

[19:42] is so important.

[19:43] And that's what I spend now a disproportionate of my time on.

[19:46] And people are listening to this.

[19:47] And you guys are nodding along.

[19:49] But you're still not getting it,

[19:50] because it's not real for you to look me

[19:51] for ever to figure this out.

[19:52] When we make ads, and I'll get in my ad creation process later,

[19:57] you have, like, I do 10 times the effort on the first five seconds.

[20:02] 10 times, actually 10 times.

[20:04] So if I have an hour, I would spend 55 minutes

[20:08] on the first five seconds, and then five minutes

[20:11] on everything that's after that.

[20:12] Like, that's the proportion of how much time I'm spending

[20:15] on just getting that first part right.

[20:17] I'll give you a content example of this.

[20:19] So I was invited to this content creator thing

[20:23] with all the top guys.

[20:24] Probably 10 guys there.

[20:26] The lowest guy in the room was me.

[20:28] And the next lowest guy was at, like, 10 million plus subscribers

[20:30] on the on YouTube.

[20:31] So they just had me there because for entertainment.

[20:34] And I remember one of the guys had about 15 million subscribers,

[20:38] and he was pissed that this other content creator

[20:41] had basically copied his video.

[20:43] And the copied video had done better than his, like, three times more.

[20:46] He got like 30 million views in his, got like 10 million views.

[20:48] And the main guy there who had several hundred million

[20:52] subscribers across all his channels was like, let's pop it in.

[20:55] Let's roast it.

[20:56] And so they press play on the video.

[20:59] And five seconds in he stops the video is like, dude,

[21:02] you didn't confirm the thumb.

[21:03] He's like the headline and the first five seconds weren't confirmed.

[21:06] And he was like, I don't even see any more.

[21:07] And he just walked out of the room.

[21:09] And so this guy had spent weeks, you know,

[21:11] making this thing obsessing about every detail of it.

[21:14] He had a 20 page plus brief on how he was making this video.

[21:18] And he missed the first five seconds.

[21:19] And that was the guy who had the multiple hundred million subscribers

[21:22] was like, that's it.

[21:23] And he just walked out and got lunch.

[21:25] And so what I saw that I was like, wow, like, it just reinforced how important this was.

[21:30] And recently just at a micro level, one of our portfolio companies is that a figure

[21:33] plus business.

[21:35] We simply changed the headline on the landing page.

[21:40] Like, we did nothing else.

[21:40] We kept same ads.

[21:42] Just changed the headline.

[21:44] We increased booking rate by 62%.

[21:47] Now here's what's crazy is the opt-in rate remained the same.

[21:50] But simply because of the frame of the promise in the headline, 62% more people chose

[21:55] to book calls for that business.

[21:57] And so it just shows you that how you frame what people are then going to consume

[22:01] has a massive impact on how much value and how likely they are to take the next step.

[22:06] So here's how you do it in terms of optimizing 80, 20 fronts of back.

[22:10] So number one is assume that they have no idea who you are, what you do, how it works,

[22:14] they're in a rush, and they have a third grade education.

[22:17] All right, so clear beats clever, deletion beats explanation.

[22:22] And so what you want to do is you want to try and make it as short as you really

[22:24] possible.

[22:25] And then once you have it as short as possible, put into a third grade reading calculator,

[22:29] look at the grade level and keep editing it down until it's third grade.

[22:32] Good thing is, is you're not going to attract downward people.

[22:35] You're going to make accessible to everyone.

[22:37] A smart person needs to use less brain paradox to understand simple language, and it makes

[22:41] it understand the bull to everyone else.

[22:44] And as a reminder, 30% of people can barely read.

[22:47] And so this is relying on them to have the skill.

[22:50] It's like you want to meet them where they're at.

[22:52] And there are some very rich people who can barely read.

[22:54] And so it has nothing to do with intelligence.

[22:56] It says everything to do with how they're educated, which has, which may have no connection

[23:01] with their personning power.

[23:03] Okay, and tactically what I'll do is I probably, I'd make about 50 hooks every time I

[23:08] start recording ads.

[23:09] So I 50 hooks that I've written down that I think are awesome.

[23:12] And then I have three to five meat pieces of an advertisement.

[23:16] And then I do one to three CTAs, meaning called actions at the end.

[23:18] And so that means I way more on the front end in terms of effort compared to the three to

[23:23] five and the one to three that I do on the back.

[23:25] And that's because I know that that's where all of the effort needs to go, because that's

[23:27] where all the returns are.

[23:28] And here's the difference.

[23:29] And this is why I say from you optimize advertising, specifically, from front to back.

[23:34] Because it's very rare that you're going to be able to double or triple a quarts ruple the amount

[23:38] of throughput you get in a funnel by optimizing the back end.

[23:42] If you have a 30, you know, a call in a, a 50% show up rate, okay, if you get it to 75%

[23:47] that's massive, but it's a 50% job and that would be a massive increase in show rate.

[23:51] If you did that, but I can absolutely get CTRs from 1% to 4% by just optimizing the

[23:57] how out of the front end.

[23:58] And that's a 4x increase that's four times the throughput that goes through the entire funnel.

[24:03] And so I put my effort there because you can achieve 100% 200% 300% increase on the

[24:07] front end, or is it's much more difficult on the back end.

[24:10] Now, for sure, you want to optimize this thing, but if I'm going to allocate my effort,

[24:13] I want to get the biggest bang for buck.

[24:15] So when you're making your hooks, I call to call out.

[24:17] It's a reading page 136 for my book.

[24:21] A call out is whatever you do to get the attention of your audience.

[24:24] Call out's curve from hyper-specific to get one person's attention to not at all specific

[24:27] to get everyone's attention.

[24:28] So let me explain.

[24:29] If someone drops a tray of dishes in a party, everyone looks.

[24:33] If a child yells mom, then the mom's look.

[24:36] If someone says your name, only you look.

[24:38] But again, they all get attention.

[24:40] And so I try to make my call out as specific as possible to get the right people, but

[24:44] broad enough to get as many of them as I can.

[24:46] So pay close attention to advertisers use callouts, especially the ones targeting your

[24:49] audience.

[24:50] And so what I'll do is I'll look at all the ads from other competitors who are targeting

[24:54] that same audiences me.

[24:55] And the ad that are running a very long time, I know that that call out is working well.

[24:59] And so I will write down all the callouts that I see, and then I will write out the words

[25:03] that I know my customers go by.

[25:04] And I'll either start with a problem that I think they're struggling from or a question

[25:08] that I think that I know that they'll say yes to or I'll simply stay moms in Nevada.

[25:14] Homeowners in Clark County, very clearly calling out this is for you.

[25:18] And that's exactly what you want the person to say when they read the headline or hear

[25:21] the call out, this is for me.

[25:24] And the more specific you get, oftentimes you'll be surprised.

[25:27] You think that going as broad as you can is going to increase the number of options.

[25:31] But when you get really specific about the type of customer you're really trying to

[25:34] attract, you will often find that they're like, oh, I wouldn't have responded to the broad

[25:38] thing, but this one's just for me.

[25:40] And you get more people in terms of qualified leads in the door by being more specific.

[25:45] Peace be advice number four.

[25:46] LTV to CAC is the only thing that matters.

[25:50] And if I had only one metric that I could find out about a business, if I only had one that

[25:54] I could pick, it would be the LTV to CAC ratio.

[25:57] And let me tell you a quick story that I kind of drive this home.

[25:59] So a friend of mine owns a bow manufacturing business.

[26:03] And they do 23 million bucks a year.

[26:05] So relatively large business established.

[26:07] And he was like, hey, we're trying to get into pay debts.

[26:10] Now they had all these distribution relationships, but they want to open up this new channel.

[26:13] And he says, hey, you're the marketing guy, right?

[26:15] So what would you do here?

[26:17] And so as I was explaining the process that the strategy that I went out line for him, he was

[26:22] like, well, what's the benchmark I should be looking at in terms of leads?

[26:24] And I was like, do the benchmark is irrelevant.

[26:27] Everything just comes back from what's gross profit.

[26:29] So it's like, OK, so what's the average gross profit on a bow?

[26:32] I'm making this up.

[26:32] Say it's $500.

[26:34] OK.

[26:34] So if we get leads for a call at 20 bucks, and we know that we can get one in five leads

[26:39] to buy a bow, then it means that cost us our CAC is $100.

[26:43] And our gross profit from selling each bow is $500.

[26:46] So cost us $100 to make $500 gross profit, $5 to one.

[26:49] Awesome.

[26:50] And so fundamentally, is $20 a good lead cost?

[26:54] Well, yeah, he's getting $5 to one.

[26:56] If it was at $10, then he'd be getting $10 to one.

[26:59] And that's assuming the same ratios.

[27:00] And so it just depends on what percentage of customers you can

[27:02] vert and at what price what you're converting them at.

[27:05] CAC to LTV or CAC to LTGP.

[27:08] So I use LTGP to be more specific.

[27:10] Lifetime values, just the amount of gross profit you make from a customer

[27:13] over the lifetime of them being a customer of your business.

[27:17] CAC is the cost to acquire a customer, which is the all-in cost,

[27:20] including sales, marketing, software, everything to get someone to give you money.

[27:24] And so the CAC to LTV ratio is simply how much money it costs you

[27:27] to make more money.

[27:28] It's the foundational economic unit of any business.

[27:31] And so making sure that you know how much money it costs you

[27:34] to make money, that fundamentally feels like a very important metric

[27:36] in order to scale the business.

[27:38] And over time, as long as you don't have some big capital expenses

[27:41] in terms of scaling your business, that fundamental return

[27:45] that you get will reflect the company growth of the business

[27:47] provided you don't have other constraints to growth.

[27:50] So for example, if I have meals that I sell for $10, and cost me $9

[27:55] to package and ship them and deliver them,

[27:58] then I have $1 of gross profit per meal.

[28:02] And so if someone buys 10 meals for me, I'm not making $100.

[28:05] I'm making $10 in gross profit.

[28:07] And if the average person buys, call it, five weeks of meals,

[28:11] then I would make $50 in lifetime gross profit.

[28:14] And so the only way that I would want to be able to acquire

[28:16] customers is that the cost to a customer in this example,

[28:18] I don't want to have probably at $15 or less.

[28:21] Because you can't do it at even because then there's no money left over

[28:23] to do everything else in the business.

[28:25] And so the rule of thumb is that you would have at least three to one

[28:27] on LTV to cack, but again, LTV's not lifetime revenue.

[28:31] It's lifetime gross profit.

[28:32] And that's what people I think a lot of times messed up

[28:34] is they don't even know what their gross profit is,

[28:36] and then they spend blindly.

[28:37] So I'll tell you if fun one.

[28:38] So if you've seen Starbucks advertise, now a lot of them,

[28:41] they just use their storefronts as they're advertising at this point.

[28:44] But they make about $14,000 in LTV per customer.

[28:50] And so they can spend absurd amounts of money

[28:53] to get customers in the door.

[28:54] Like even if it costs them $500, they're still making 28 to 1

[28:58] on the money they put in.

[28:59] And that is why that company's been able to scale

[29:01] to the moon in terms of the number of locations.

[29:03] And so I will say that all the money that I've made in my life,

[29:07] that has been the crazy money has come from crazy LTV to cack ratios.

[29:11] And so the smallest ratios that I've made crazy money on is 30 to 1.

[29:15] All the way up to 101 to 200 to 1,

[29:17] returned to some of the businesses I have.

[29:19] And so those windows don't stay forever.

[29:23] And when you do have one of those,

[29:25] you just want to dump as much money into that machine

[29:27] as you possibly can because a lot of wealth is made

[29:29] in very short punctuated periods.

[29:31] And then sustained by long periods of maintenance

[29:33] where you're getting five to one, eight to one, 10 to one.

[29:36] Those are fine numbers.

[29:37] But most of the time when you're at 10 to one,

[29:39] as soon as you start scaling it, it might drop to five to one.

[29:42] And so I actually end up seeing the bigger the ratio

[29:44] is at the beginning, the more indication it is

[29:47] that I can scale profitably.

[29:48] Because if I'm, let's say spending $1,000 a day

[29:52] and I can get a hundred to one,

[29:53] the nine of them probably give me

[29:54] to get to $100,000 a day and get five to one.

[29:58] And so that's the idea.

[29:59] It's like, how can I scale this up?

[30:01] And I care about absolute return, not relative return.

[30:04] But the cack to LTV ratio gives me an indication

[30:06] how much room I have to blow this thing out of the water.

[30:08] The easiest way to calculate what your lifetime gross profit is.

[30:12] Just look at all the customers that you sold over the last year.

[30:15] Look at gross profit.

[30:17] And if you don't know gross profit is,

[30:18] it's just the cost of good, basically.

[30:20] The price you charge minus the cost of good sold,

[30:23] which is whether it's services

[30:25] than it's the labor that you used to provide the service.

[30:27] If it's a widget, then it's the cost of the widget

[30:29] and the shipping associated with it.

[30:31] So the cost of good sold minus the revenue

[30:32] and that leftover is the gross profit.

[30:34] And so you say, okay, I had a hundred customers this year.

[30:37] I made this total amount of gross profit this year.

[30:40] You'd buy that amount of gross profit

[30:41] by the total of number of customers.

[30:42] That'll give you a broad brush stroke

[30:45] of what you make per customer.

[30:46] Now, that'll always underestimate it,

[30:48] especially if you have a recurring revenue business,

[30:50] because they're gonna hopefully have some people

[30:51] who buy again and again over time.

[30:53] But I would always rather be on the safer side

[30:55] and underestimate my lifetime gross profit

[30:57] or lifetime value rather than overestimated

[30:59] and potentially lose money.

[31:00] If I want to then take that number and say,

[31:02] okay, well, what am I willing to spend per customer,

[31:04] then at most you want to have a third of that number.

[31:07] But for me specifically,

[31:09] I want to make sure that whatever I collect in the first 30 days,

[31:11] I want to make sure that I collect that back from customers.

[31:15] So if I'm, let's say I sell something for 10 bucks a month,

[31:18] people stay for 10 months

[31:19] and there's a hundred percent gross margins

[31:20] to make this simple.

[31:21] So I make a hundred bucks and gross profit.

[31:24] I want to see if I can find a way to make $10 back

[31:28] or get my cack back in that first 30 days.

[31:31] And so sometimes it means having a one-time upcharge up front

[31:34] so that can offset the cost of acquisition

[31:36] so that the remainder of the customer relationship

[31:38] can be profitable.

[31:39] And if these concepts about scaling like LTV to CAC

[31:41] are interesting to you,

[31:43] we just opened up a new workshop's division

[31:44] at Acquisition.com for companies

[31:46] that were not invested in.

[31:47] If you like us and my team to help you personalize

[31:50] kind of applying this stuff to your business,

[31:52] you can go to Acquisition.com,

[31:53] click the scale button and you can see

[31:54] if your business qualifies.

[31:55] Otherwise, back to the video.

[31:57] Peace of advice number five, my ad creation process.

[32:00] So I've been running ads for 13 years

[32:02] and I'm saying when I say running ads

[32:03] and I've been making ads

[32:04] or directly influencing ads

[32:06] that have been run across my portfolio,

[32:08] or companies that I directly owned

[32:09] or found it for 13 straight years.

[32:11] And so I have this process pretty nailed.

[32:15] And I haven't really ever gotten too far away from it

[32:18] partially because I like it a lot

[32:20] and I've gotten just pretty good at it.

[32:21] And so this is how I do it.

[32:23] So number one is that at all times I'm collecting data,

[32:26] what I mean by that is like,

[32:27] if I see ads on Instagram,

[32:28] I see ads on YouTube,

[32:29] like I have no pre-mic of accounts on any platform

[32:32] because I wanna hear the ads.

[32:34] I wanna hear the hooks.

[32:35] I wanna hear what they're doing to draw attention.

[32:37] And I like using that stuff

[32:38] because I'm also a business owner.

[32:39] So the people who advertised to me

[32:41] are the people that are gonna try and hook my attention.

[32:43] And so I can still use that stuff to get to my avatar.

[32:46] And so if you are your avatar,

[32:47] the ads count double for you.

[32:49] And so I screenshot, I record the stuff

[32:52] that I find interesting and I add it into one folder.

[32:54] Then when I get to my ad creation process

[32:56] which is I do once a week,

[32:57] I then sit down first thing in the morning

[32:59] and I do these the same day I record.

[33:01] So that's just a piece of advice

[33:02] that has worked for me like cramming for the test.

[33:04] I cram for my ad sessions

[33:05] because then everything's top of mind

[33:07] as I go into the day.

[33:08] And so I pull up all my sweat files

[33:11] of all the things that I want like my inspiration from.

[33:13] The second thing that I pull up

[33:14] is all my historical best performing ads.

[33:16] So I look back one year, two years, three years,

[33:18] sometimes at all my best ads.

[33:20] And I drink those back in and I watch the first 10 seconds,

[33:22] watch the first 30 seconds,

[33:23] and see, okay, how's that capturing?

[33:25] What was the angle?

[33:26] What was the hook here?

[33:26] And then I start the actual hook creation process.

[33:29] Now, 40 of my 50 hooks that I'm gonna write out

[33:32] are going to be stuff that is tried and true.

[33:35] I'm not gonna try and reinvent the wheel.

[33:37] We've already spent billions and billions of dollars.

[33:39] I know that these hooks, these entrances work well.

[33:42] Now, 20% the last 10 is where I get to use all my inspiration

[33:45] and other ideas to try and experiment on.

[33:47] But most people flip this.

[33:49] They try and do a little bit of the stuff that works

[33:50] and then they have lots of new ideas.

[33:51] I'm telling you, I've done this a long time.

[33:53] It's way more efficient to just do more of what worked

[33:56] and then leave a little bit of experimentation

[33:58] so that if some of those things stop working over time,

[34:00] you have this fresh batch that you've been trying out

[34:02] that then can become the control that you try and beat.

[34:05] So, signing back to the 80, 20 concept

[34:07] of you put 80% of your effort into the hooks

[34:11] and 80% of your effort goes into stuff

[34:12] that's tried and true and 20% for the things that are new.

[34:15] All right, so I make about 50 hooks,

[34:17] so 80% of that is 40 hooks and 20% of that is 10 hooks.

[34:20] So, 40 out of my 50 hooks,

[34:22] I do four things that I already know have worked in the past.

[34:25] 10 hooks, I say for my new creative ideas.

[34:28] And so that's for the inspiration stuff that I see,

[34:29] or anything that I come to that cramp session

[34:32] that I want to get out.

[34:33] From there, I then have my 3 to 5 angles

[34:35] that I'm going to write, that's going to be educational

[34:37] or some sort of value that I'm going to deliver

[34:40] or some sort of belief that I want to break

[34:41] or some sort of list or steps or stories

[34:43] that I want to tell as the core me to the ad,

[34:45] some sort of proof I want to demonstrate,

[34:46] and then finally, just a quick CTA

[34:48] in terms of called action.

[34:49] But the majority of my effort is all on the 50 or so hooks

[34:52] that I'm going to write, 40 of which being recycled versions

[34:55] of things I already know work and 10 being net new.

[34:58] And this sounds boring and it is boring,

[35:00] but it's also what works and believe me,

[35:03] I have tried to change this process a lot of times

[35:05] like this works.

[35:07] Let's say that you have your omega winner

[35:10] and these happen and this is where you get,

[35:11] this is the power law, like that top 5%

[35:14] makes 95% of your income.

[35:16] Like we run all these ads to figure out

[35:18] which is the one ad that can sing

[35:20] and just crank and print money.

[35:22] And so what I do is I use something

[35:24] that I call the Claudiscope process.

[35:25] I've never heard anyone else tell it,

[35:26] so I'm owning that title.

[35:28] And so the Claudiscope process, this is how you do it.

[35:30] Is that let's say you've got a winning ad.

[35:32] So I had an ad at Jim launch that actually

[35:34] the now president, Kale made when he was a customer

[35:38] of him in front of his gym, with the gym being full

[35:40] and his wife's next to him, and he's like six months ago,

[35:44] I was working in full time job in order to pay rent

[35:46] at this gym and my wife was pregnant

[35:48] and we had an eye to two month old

[35:50] and I had no idea how he was going to make ends meet.

[35:52] And then here we are six months later,

[35:54] the gym is full, it's completely outsourced

[35:56] and I've already got an offer for $250,000 on the gym.

[35:59] If you've ever been worried, like take the jump,

[36:01] just follow the process it works, right?

[36:02] It's very simple ad.

[36:03] But it murdered, it absolutely crushed.

[36:06] And so rather than say, wow, okay, well, that was nice.

[36:09] Let's try and do that.

[36:11] Let's try and get somebody else to say that.

[36:13] We took that, we squeezed the living life out of it.

[36:15] And so here's 10 things that I did to get more out of that ad.

[36:18] So one is I changed the color of the backgrounds

[36:21] if I can do that, right?

[36:22] Or backdrops is the way that we can

[36:24] record that ad with a different background.

[36:25] Or a different background color, like if you have a green screen.

[36:27] Second is there are the different props

[36:29] that we can introduce that ad.

[36:30] All right, so can we show stuff?

[36:31] Can we show visuals or we can show physical props?

[36:34] Three, can we just re-enact it?

[36:35] And say, okay, we can just do it again.

[36:37] Just literally do the same ad.

[36:39] Different t-shirt if you want.

[36:40] Same exact thing, just do it again.

[36:41] And if you're the one making the ads,

[36:42] you just do your best performing ad again.

[36:45] You can, for re-order it.

[36:47] So we took the ad that was order the original winner

[36:49] and we just re-change the order up of the ad

[36:51] and it's still converted.

[36:53] The next things we added visual filters.

[36:54] So think black and white, think cepia,

[36:56] think high contrast, low contrast.

[36:58] These are all different things that made the ad look different

[37:01] than it was, but it's still delivered the same message.

[37:03] The next one is visual effects, right?

[37:04] VFX, like dude ads and whizz bangs and things like that

[37:08] that you can add to again make it look different.

[37:10] The next is changing fonts and captions.

[37:12] So it's like if we had a font style that was one way,

[37:15] we just changed the way the font style looks.

[37:17] Another is that you can change the pacing

[37:18] or the speed of the video itself.

[37:19] You can actually do it at 1.2 or 1.5

[37:21] and you have to go through or slow down at portions.

[37:24] You can add music to it.

[37:26] There's another one, right?

[37:27] You can also use the same hook, which is like

[37:29] we knew the hook from that first ad obviously crushed

[37:31] and then just say, hey, re-record it again,

[37:33] we'll use the same hook and use the different back, right?

[37:35] And so all of those are different ways

[37:36] that will take a winner and then 10x or 100x

[37:39] how much that winner gets us.

[37:40] And I'm telling you, if you take one thing

[37:42] from the video from advertising,

[37:44] squeeze the living how to the winners.

[37:46] So market-vice number six is that there is only four ways

[37:49] they can let other people know about your stuff.

[37:50] And so think about this like a four box.

[37:51] You've got one to one, conversations,

[37:54] and one to many, which is broadcasts, right?

[37:56] There's the two styles that can be

[37:57] either communicate to a group of people

[37:59] or one person individually.

[38:00] And you're either talking to people who know who you are

[38:02] or you're talking to strangers.

[38:03] And so if you cross that, you've got four ways.

[38:05] You've got one to one to people who know you,

[38:07] one to one to strangers, one to many

[38:09] to people who know you, one to many to strangers.

[38:12] And if you look at that in terms of what that is

[38:13] and advertising, it means this is warm outreach,

[38:16] cold outreach, making content, which is one to many

[38:18] to people you know.

[38:19] And then running ads, which is one to many to strangers.

[38:21] And so there's the only four things that you can do

[38:23] to advertise, to let people know about your stuff.

[38:26] And basically, if you're not spending your day

[38:28] doing one of those core four things, you are not advertising.

[38:31] You are not marketing your business.

[38:32] And so sometimes it gets, you have to get it to that simple.

[38:35] When you look at how many hours per day of my spending,

[38:37] letting people know about my stuff, most people spend zero, zero,

[38:41] zero per day, letting people know about their stuff.

[38:43] And then for some reason, they're curious

[38:45] as to why their business is growing.

[38:46] Well, no one knows you exist.

[38:48] I was at a conference as a gymcon recently.

[38:52] And I asked the audience, who here wants to grow their gym

[38:54] faster?

[38:55] Everybody raise their hand.

[38:56] And I said, OK, and these are all small businesses.

[38:58] So these are most of the guys here doing,

[38:59] I would say, $500,000 an year to $3,000 a year.

[39:02] So these aren't massive businesses.

[39:03] These are normal.

[39:04] One location, three location, five location owner operators

[39:07] of service-based training businesses.

[39:10] And I said, OK, who here is spending the first four hours

[39:13] of their day promoting their business, either doing cold outreach,

[39:17] making content, or running ads?

[39:20] Who is spending the first four hours every day on that?

[39:22] Literally, no one in the audience had their hand raised.

[39:27] And I was like, this is why you're small.

[39:29] Like, this is it.

[39:30] Like, it was mind-blowing to me that that was what it was.

[39:32] And so if you're making less than,

[39:34] call it a million, maybe $3 million a year,

[39:37] like all of your effort, the first four hours of your day,

[39:40] which if you have to wake up early, awesome.

[39:42] If you have to stay up late to do it, awesome.

[39:44] I don't care.

[39:44] But you need four hours that you're dedicating,

[39:46] because you've got to do the job of promoting,

[39:48] and then you've got to run your business.

[39:50] But if you're just running your business,

[39:51] you're never going to get ahead.

[39:53] So if you wanted to grow, you've got to force it to grow.

[39:55] You have to force people to find out about your stuff,

[39:57] and you do that throughout advertising.

[39:59] I recommend this so violently, because small businesses need to do more.

[40:04] And in the beginning, they just don't get enough leads.

[40:06] So fundamentally, like, most businesses, if you just had more leads,

[40:09] you would make more money.

[40:10] Now, realistically, and I'll get to some of the specifics on this,

[40:15] is that in order to get more leads,

[40:17] you need to be able to do so profitably,

[40:19] which then comes back down to the business,

[40:20] and building the business back to front.

[40:22] We advertise front to back.

[40:23] We build the business back to front,

[40:25] and I'll get to lots of details on that in a second.

[40:27] But big picture, you just need to get,

[40:30] especially when you're starting out, you're at 500 a million,

[40:33] less than 3 million.

[40:34] And those are big numbers.

[40:35] So I don't mean that to demean it,

[40:36] but I want you to build massive enterprises

[40:38] that make huge impact.

[40:40] You have to get more flow through the system,

[40:43] so that you can learn how to improve the product,

[40:45] so that you can build a better back end.

[40:47] And then you basically, you promote,

[40:50] and you stay at that level of promotion,

[40:51] until you tweak this and nail it, then you go back and scale it.

[40:55] And so one of our sayings internally is nail it, then scale it.

[40:57] So nail the back end, you do enough promotion to get flow in, right?

[41:01] Then you monetize, then you create fiction.

[41:03] That's when you tweak the hell out of it,

[41:05] and then you can go back and say, hey, it turns out

[41:07] we could spend five times more to get customers, then you scale.

[41:10] So I'll give you my quick back of napkin,

[41:12] and I'll give you my skilling framework for this.

[41:14] So when you're at zero to six figures,

[41:17] you sell one product to one avatar on one channel.

[41:20] That's it, no shiny objects, no multiple channels,

[41:23] no trying to scale yourself out of it.

[41:25] You're just selling one product to one avatar on one channel.

[41:28] When you go from six to seven figures,

[41:30] you scale, you sell one product to one avatar on one channel,

[41:33] consistently, because in the beginning you're super volatile,

[41:36] right?

[41:37] You're not, you're making a sell this week,

[41:38] not next week, then this week again,

[41:39] or the next month, whatever, it's super volatile.

[41:41] You get to seven figures, it's more consistent.

[41:42] You get it to be reliable.

[41:45] So when you go from seven figures to eight figures,

[41:47] you go one avatar, one channel, two products.

[41:51] That means you have an upsell, you sell something else,

[41:54] and then you do that consistently.

[41:57] That's what gets you to eight figures.

[41:59] That's what gets you to 10 million bucks a year.

[42:00] And if you wanna go to multiple eight figures,

[42:03] then you start going two channels,

[42:05] one avatar, two products consistently.

[42:08] And so over time, this is how I've seen,

[42:10] I've just seen this pattern.

[42:12] Now, can you find somebody who disobeys this pattern?

[42:15] Sure, AG1 is one product, one avatar,

[42:17] a zillion channels, right?

[42:19] So yes, there are ways to break this rule.

[42:21] But when I look at, by and large,

[42:23] the vast majority of businesses, they follow this structure,

[42:25] and they mess up along the way

[42:27] until they follow the next step.

[42:29] And you'll notice that scaling up to eight figures,

[42:31] and even sometimes a little beyond that,

[42:33] you're still only focused on one avatar.

[42:35] And I'm gonna talk about this in a lot of depth

[42:36] in one of the later advice points,

[42:38] because it's super important,

[42:39] that this may be one of the bigger unlocks

[42:40] you could have in the business.

[42:42] Market advice number seven, state the facts

[42:44] and tell the truth.

[42:45] This is probably one of the most repeated phrases,

[42:46] besides volume negates luck

[42:48] that I have internally to my business.

[42:50] And so I remember when I was at that same

[42:51] little meetup with the super creators,

[42:54] and I was talking to the guy who had the most,

[42:57] subscriber's there and I was like, yeah,

[42:59] we don't really like this whole clickbait title thing.

[43:01] And he looked at me with disgust,

[43:03] and he was like, you absolutely make clickbait titles.

[43:06] He said, you just back it up with truth.

[43:09] And he's like, so it's crazy clickbait,

[43:11] he's like, but it also happens to be true.

[43:13] And I remember when we said that to me,

[43:15] I was like, shit, that's real.

[43:18] And it's funny because that was a concept

[43:20] that I have in terms of paydads,

[43:23] but I hadn't thought about it in terms of content.

[43:25] And so it's so interesting how some of these principles

[43:26] just apply across domains,

[43:28] but sometimes you have to relearn the same lessons,

[43:30] for the hate doing, but I did it anyways.

[43:32] And so the problem is that most businesses

[43:35] don't track results.

[43:37] And it's because if you don't track, you don't care.

[43:39] Now, they don't track partially because it's kind of like ignorance.

[43:42] Like they know they don't deliver good results,

[43:44] and so if they track it, then they'll have facts and truth

[43:46] that they will be proven that they're delivering better results.

[43:48] But the first step is tracking it, because once you start

[43:50] tracking it, you can improve it.

[43:52] And measurement as intervention is actually a scientifically

[43:55] proven method to lose weight, to improve sales,

[43:58] to improve anything you want.

[43:59] You can literally simply tracking it, not trying to do anything else,

[44:03] but simply tracking your weight.

[44:05] Simply tracking your clothes rate,

[44:06] simply tracking your ad performance will improve it,

[44:09] because you're just putting attention on it.

[44:11] And so if you don't track, you don't care.

[44:13] Now, once you do start tracking it,

[44:15] you can start doing things to actually improve it

[44:17] beyond just measurement as intervention.

[44:19] And so when you do that, low and behold,

[44:21] your stats get better.

[44:22] And then you can state the facts and tell the truth,

[44:26] and have that truth be wildly compelling.

[44:29] And so real talk, part of the reason that you're much

[44:32] to this day has still not been beaten or de-throwed

[44:35] as the largest company in that space,

[44:37] is because we still have better stats and better results

[44:40] than anyone else does.

[44:41] The average gym, who goes through 12 months of gym launch,

[44:44] makes over 100 plus thousand a year and added profit

[44:47] by using the systems we have.

[44:49] That's just what it is.

[44:50] And so if someone, if it makes sense for somebody

[44:53] to triple their money, then they make the purchase.

[44:57] It's I like to take a lot of emotion out of the sale.

[45:00] Like if this makes sense for you, if this return makes

[45:01] it through, then do it.

[45:02] If it doesn't make sense, then don't do it.

[45:03] Now the risk they take on is what about the bottom 20%.

[45:06] And so the nice thing is that we track that.

[45:07] So the bottom 20% average $40,000 in additional revenue.

[45:11] So they basically broke even.

[45:12] And so it's like, that's the bottom.

[45:14] And so if that's you, then it's like, yeah, you worked

[45:17] and you basically broke even that kind of sucks.

[45:18] Now I'm not talking about the top 20%

[45:19] because this guy's at 500,000 plus per year.

[45:21] But the thing is, if you track the stats,

[45:24] then you can promote the stats and you can do so truthfully.

[45:26] They go from unsubstantiated claims to substantiated claims.

[45:30] Like one of the things that a most proud of in school,

[45:32] school.com, which is the platform for people

[45:34] who are trying to start their businesses,

[45:35] this video is mostly for people who are the uno business.

[45:37] But if you're trying to start a business,

[45:39] 30.44% of people who finished their first month

[45:41] make their first dollar online.

[45:42] Like I'm super proud of that.

[45:43] And we just rolled out this massive new thing

[45:46] to basically make it even easier, even faster to do it.

[45:48] And right now, if 35% more people actually

[45:51] succeeding there.

[45:52] So I think we're going to be a little bit over 40% now.

[45:54] So I'm super stoked about that.

[45:55] But like unless you measure, like if you don't track,

[45:58] you don't care.

[45:59] Here's the tactical steps.

[46:00] Collect data first.

[46:02] So you implement a data step where you collect data

[46:04] for people day one, day 30, day 60, day 90,

[46:07] at the end of the program,

[46:08] or whatever your implementation is, you track data throughout.

[46:11] Number two is you keep improving things

[46:13] until the data becomes compelling.

[46:15] And number three is how do you actually present that data?

[46:17] So there's four variables that matters

[46:19] in representing the data.

[46:20] Number one is the percentage of people,

[46:22] whether that's the median, the average,

[46:24] or the percentage overall of people,

[46:26] that's number one, who too achieve x-outcome,

[46:28] three in y time or after x-attamps,

[46:31] and four under z conditions.

[46:33] And so it's like we get x percent of gyms.

[46:36] So as whatever's the average, average gyms,

[46:38] so average gym owner makes an extra $100,000

[46:43] per year in profit.

[46:43] So that's the outcome.

[46:45] After the first 12 months in gym loads,

[46:49] or gym legacy, which is the program that we have a gym much.

[46:51] And so those are the conditions.

[46:53] And so it covers all four of those.

[46:54] So when you're making these, you would hit all four

[46:57] of those things when you're explaining the data publicly.

[47:00] And I will say that the fewer conditions you have,

[47:03] the more compelling it is.

[47:05] Because for example, if I said, the average gym,

[47:08] who spends $10,000 a month and has 10 employees,

[47:12] and has two methods of acquisition,

[47:15] and a large group training, and a small group training,

[47:18] achieves, by the time I even get to that,

[47:20] you're like whatever.

[47:22] And so you want to strip away and really,

[47:25] like I would rather have a fewer condition statement

[47:28] that has lower results, me personally,

[47:31] than a higher result one with more conditions.

[47:34] Market advice and break.

[47:35] Say what only you can say, show what only you can show.

[47:38] And so this is one of the other isms

[47:39] that I have internal to my business.

[47:41] And so if you're the only triple black belt in Ohio

[47:44] for Moitai, then say that you're the only triple back belt

[47:49] in Ohio for Moitai.

[47:50] This is talking about the things that you have done

[47:52] rather than telling people what to do.

[47:54] It's how I versus how to.

[47:56] And so my concept for making amazing ads

[47:59] and making amazing content is two steps.

[48:02] Do epic stuff talk about what you did.

[48:05] And so you can't out-out come people

[48:07] or you can out-work them.

[48:09] So it starts with the out-working,

[48:11] and then the out-working creates the out-out coming,

[48:13] and the out-out coming is a much shorter headline,

[48:15] but the out-working them still works.

[48:17] I can start by saying, hey, I wrote these two books.

[48:21] Writing two books would be an out-working thing,

[48:23] like anyone could do it.

[48:24] There's no outcome, but hey, I wrote these two books.

[48:26] But then if the books are good, then I get the outcome,

[48:28] which is that we sold over a million copies.

[48:30] There's still number one and number two

[48:31] in marketing to the state multiple years later.

[48:33] And so the idea is that first you do the work,

[48:36] and then you get the outcome,

[48:36] but most people want to say epic stuff,

[48:38] having done none of it.

[48:40] And so you can get past the judgment of other people

[48:43] because you're not saying, hey, you have to do anything.

[48:45] I'm saying, this is what I did.

[48:46] And so the idea is that everybody wants a return on their time.

[48:50] And I remember hearing this first concept

[48:52] from Iraq, who's a YouTuber.

[48:54] And he said, dude, I made this thing

[48:56] where I went on 100 dates in, basically I did an entire season

[49:00] of the Bachelor, but I did it in 16 minutes.

[49:03] He's like, what a steal.

[49:04] And he said that to me, and I was like, man,

[49:06] such an interesting concept.

[49:08] Like, he just took something that was really long

[49:10] and made it really short and crammed it in there.

[49:11] So value per second was super high.

[49:13] And I'll just give you this one,

[49:14] is that it's not about seconds of value.

[49:17] It's value per second.

[49:19] That's what matters.

[49:20] Like, everybody has access to infinite information.

[49:22] So you're just saying I'm going to give you more stuff

[49:24] is not helpful.

[49:25] What you want to do is curate it and pack it

[49:27] and distill it and crystallize all the value

[49:30] and it's tight-up hack, it's usually possible

[49:31] so that they're value per second skyrockets.

[49:34] And you can do that by saying, hey, I spent 10 hours editing,

[49:38] you know, I spent 20 hours making a summary of this book

[49:41] and you can read the whole thing in 10 minutes.

[49:44] That's why summary still always work, right?

[49:46] Because people want to get a deal on their time.

[49:48] They get the same result for fraction of the time.

[49:50] It's always a good deal.

[49:51] By the way, if you ever want to sell to rich people,

[49:53] just promise the same result in half the time for twice the price.

[49:55] And even if you think about this video overall,

[49:57] it's like, well, I spent 13 years doing all this stuff

[50:00] and I'm trying to compress those lessons

[50:01] into whatever amount of time this video is.

[50:04] Certainly, less than 13 years.

[50:05] And so this is a great deal for the right person,

[50:08] for the right business owner who's actually trying to scale.

[50:10] So how do you actually do this?

[50:12] So if I had a marketing agency showing what only I can show,

[50:16] I wouldn't demonstrate.

[50:17] And so I didn't say, hey, I'm going to get you leads.

[50:19] What I want to do is get on a sales call

[50:20] and I'm going to play what a live lead

[50:22] that I got for one of my companies,

[50:24] one of my clients, sounds like.

[50:25] And I'd be like, hey, listen to this call,

[50:27] it's a minute long.

[50:28] Do you think you could take 50 of these a month?

[50:30] Wow, so much more compelling than saying,

[50:32] I'll just get you 50 leads.

[50:33] They're actually getting a fractionalized version.

[50:36] They're getting a taste of what it looks like to be in the future.

[50:39] They're experiencing the result

[50:40] of Icariously through the other person.

[50:42] And fundamentally, that's what a good testimony does.

[50:44] It's they put themselves in the shoes

[50:45] of the person who got the result.

[50:46] And then they put a discount on that and say,

[50:49] okay, how likely is that for me?

[50:52] And that's what I'm willing to pay.

[50:53] Now if it were guaranteed, then all money-making opportunities

[50:56] would be worth it because, hey, if you spend $1,000

[50:58] to make $100,000 a year by buying this course,

[51:01] then everyone will buy it if they knew for sure it would happen.

[51:03] They'll be an amazing deal.

[51:04] The problem is that people apply a discount to it

[51:06] because of how unlikely it is for them.

[51:08] And so we want to increase that likelihood

[51:09] by showing them rather than telling them.

[51:11] And so agency example, if that was that one.

[51:13] The software example that I have is,

[51:15] this is why demos are so effective.

[51:17] You want to see, this, hey, you have a video clipping software.

[51:21] Great, do you have a video on you?

[51:22] Cool, send it to me, we're on the phone.

[51:24] Great, I'm going to pull this video up.

[51:25] This is what we do to put the captions on

[51:27] and shorten and find those moments.

[51:29] Click Click.

[51:30] Okay, so normally how long does that take you?

[51:32] Well, it takes me this long.

[51:33] We'll watch me do it.

[51:34] Click click, wow, would that make your life easier?

[51:36] Yes, cool.

[51:37] Boom, they go in, right?

[51:37] You're demonstrating an event.

[51:39] And I'll give you final one.

[51:40] When I was at my gym and hunting to meet

[51:42] some of my first location I ever had,

[51:43] I remember this, I had a door to door sales guy

[51:45] who came up.

[51:46] And this guy was a clear sale of pro.

[51:48] He was really good.

[51:50] And he sold me cleaning products.

[51:52] He really did.

[51:53] Like, it was probably the only door to door thing I've ever bought.

[51:55] And it was just because it was such a good sale.

[51:58] And he had it down, it's so tight.

[52:00] I think he was in an out in like 13 minutes.

[52:01] Like it was stupid.

[52:02] And so he just said, hey, I've got this stuff.

[52:05] It'll take care of any stain that you've got on this floor.

[52:07] And I had turf.

[52:08] And so I had gum that had gotten in the turf.

[52:09] It was really black and like gone in there.

[52:11] And so he just took that thing and he poured it on the gum.

[52:14] And he just got in his hands and he's scrubbed it.

[52:15] And it actually came out.

[52:16] And the gum was actually impossible to get out.

[52:18] And I was like, wow, like he, I didn't have to think

[52:20] will this work for me.

[52:21] He just did it in front of me on a stain I actually had.

[52:24] And he was like, cool, looks like you got 20 other stains.

[52:26] If this is worth it, it's 100 bucks for this stuff.

[52:28] So I paid a 100 bucks for some cleaning supplies.

[52:30] But it was totally worth it.

[52:31] And I ended up using that stuff for actually years

[52:33] because I had to, you sold my fucking huge gallons of it.

[52:37] And so again, whenever you can and don't say, oh,

[52:39] this doesn't work for my business.

[52:41] Try and imagine how can I make this work for my business?

[52:44] Show them what they will experience and do it in a way

[52:48] that no one else can do it.

[52:49] And so for example, me, I, the reason I say like do epic stuff

[52:53] and then talk about it is that you continue to live life

[52:55] every day.

[52:56] And so things continue to happen.

[52:58] And so you can use the things that happen that you're doing

[53:00] as the content that you're making.

[53:02] And the content will always be short

[53:03] in the amount of time it took for the thing to happen.

[53:06] And so we have a portfolio companies.

[53:07] And so I share case studies on this channel of like, hey,

[53:09] here's how we added 40 sales guys.

[53:11] Here's how we, you know,

[53:12] increased, you know, we cut, cut refunds by two thirds.

[53:15] Here's how we XYZ.

[53:16] And it's because we're doing stuff.

[53:17] And then we just talk about what we did.

[53:19] And so the key point step one is do stuff and then step two

[53:23] talk about it.

[53:23] Everyone else is stuck in the step where they don't want to,

[53:25] they want to figure out what to talk about.

[53:26] But it's because they haven't done anything.

[53:28] If you do stuff, you have more than enough to talk about.

[53:30] Marketing truth number nine.

[53:31] How and when to expand your market?

[53:33] There's five ways.

[53:34] Now, big picture, the vast majority of people

[53:35] need to do way more with their current market.

[53:37] So just to give you context on this,

[53:39] I had a guy who came out to a workshop

[53:41] and he said, hey, I'm a coach of coach coaches, right?

[53:45] And I was like, all right, fine.

[53:46] And he said, I'm spending, you know,

[53:47] I'm making too many bucks a year.

[53:48] It's a really saturated space.

[53:49] So I think should I go broader to general business.

[53:52] And I was like, dude, how many coaches coaching coaches

[53:55] exist and he was like, resilience.

[53:56] And I was like, dude, I think you just need to get better.

[53:58] Because if you were the best coach of coach of coaches,

[54:00] then you would be able to take all of the market share

[54:02] that all of those guys have and it would come to you, right?

[54:04] When it takes all of you are the best.

[54:06] And so just to give you an example,

[54:08] this is the one I gave him, I said, Jim launch.

[54:10] Everyone has this as a Jim company.

[54:11] But you don't know how niche it really is.

[54:13] So one, we didn't work with personal trainers.

[54:15] Number two, we didn't work, we do now,

[54:17] but we didn't for the first four or five years

[54:19] work with big box facilities.

[54:20] So large facilities where you pay $10 to $70 a month

[54:25] to have access to the pool, the racket ball thing,

[54:28] the cardio area, the weights, basketball, whatever.

[54:31] We didn't work with them at all.

[54:32] I call this facility leasing.

[54:34] We didn't use those.

[54:35] We didn't work with yoga.

[54:36] We didn't work with spin.

[54:37] We didn't work with Pilates.

[54:39] We literally only worked with microgms

[54:42] that did before and afters of weight loss

[54:44] and transformations.

[54:45] They had to do fitness and weights

[54:47] or some combination of those.

[54:48] That was it.

[54:49] That's a niche of a niche, of a niche.

[54:52] And that is a still cranks out $30 plus $1 a year.

[54:55] And so the idea here is that you want,

[54:59] like the market, if you are the best, is still massive.

[55:03] You just need to solve the thing that matters most,

[55:05] which is being the best.

[55:07] If you have solved being the best,

[55:09] there's five ways that you can expand.

[55:11] And so I'll tell you what we did

[55:12] because Jim Lach has expanded.

[55:14] I told you now we do do big bucks,

[55:15] but there's five ways you can expand.

[55:17] One, I think about like a pyramid.

[55:18] So let's say you're in the middle.

[55:19] You can go up market, meaning you go to higher value customers.

[55:23] So for us, that would be health clubs,

[55:25] the big boxes like I was talking about,

[55:27] multi-location owners or franchise wars,

[55:29] those would be going up market,

[55:30] more valuable, but fewer of them, like the pyramid.

[55:32] On the other hand, you can go down market.

[55:34] I could go after personal trainers.

[55:35] I didn't go after them, we don't go after them,

[55:37] but if I wanted to, that would be a move that I could make.

[55:39] I would have to sell a lot more volume at a lower price,

[55:42] and build the infrastructure to support that kind of volume.

[55:44] I could go adjacent, which would be,

[55:46] okay, I've got Jim's, I'll do car fractures,

[55:48] I'll do, or I've got Jim's, and I can do weight loss.

[55:50] Clinics, right, or mid-spos, or something like that.

[55:52] So something that's adjacent, that serves

[55:54] a similar avatar, but a slightly different business model.

[55:56] That would be adjacent.

[55:57] And the fifth way you can do it is that you actually go

[56:00] narrower, so that's the fourth way.

[56:02] So the fourth way is you can go narrower,

[56:03] which you say, okay, instead of all Jim's,

[56:05] or just micro-Jim's that service before an after,

[56:08] as I say, I only do once that you wait,

[56:12] or I only do one that only do cardio, right,

[56:14] or I only do boot camps, or I only do a semi-private,

[56:17] like I'd niche down even more.

[56:18] The alternative is that you go broader,

[56:20] and I say, anyone that's in health and wellness.

[56:23] And so those are the five ways that you can spend.

[56:25] You can go, I'll market, you can go down market,

[56:26] you can go adjacent market, go narrow, you can go broad.

[56:28] Now, despite me saying these five ways of expanding,

[56:30] and everyone gets their juices, they're jolly soft,

[56:32] I think you have a how they're gonna expand.

[56:34] Most time, I'm gonna start with that original story,

[56:36] which is that you can make $10, $20, $50 million a year,

[56:39] just serving one very specific avatar,

[56:41] and the vast majority of businesses.

[56:42] This is including portfolio companies

[56:44] that we purchased, I would say,

[56:46] more than half the portfolio companies we've purchased,

[56:48] we did this exercise, and we made the avatar narrower.

[56:51] We got more specific, not broader.

[56:54] I learned this process from VISTA private equity.

[56:56] So if you don't know there,

[56:57] they're $100 billion plus private equity,

[56:58] one of the most successful private equity of all time,

[57:00] they focus on software companies.

[57:01] And I talked to their head of pricing and packaging,

[57:03] and he gave me this one line, and it changed my life.

[57:05] And he said, you wanna know how we get the crazy returns

[57:08] that we do, and I was like, yeah, obviously,

[57:09] I wouldn't know what you guys do.

[57:10] Now, obviously, they do lots of things,

[57:11] but the one thing that he pulled out, he said,

[57:13] we just know the company that we're buying's customers,

[57:16] but then they do.

[57:17] And so we get, we go into the data rooms,

[57:18] whenever you do an acquisition,

[57:19] there's something called a data room,

[57:20] we put all the data for your business in there,

[57:21] so people can analyze it and make a decision

[57:23] about whether they wanna invest.

[57:24] And so we go into the data room,

[57:26] and we analyze all their customers, and we say, okay,

[57:29] we order them by who pays the most,

[57:31] and who's worth the most.

[57:32] And we say, this is the 20% that does 80% of the revenue.

[57:35] And what they do is they look at what channels

[57:37] those people come in on, what offers,

[57:38] what marketing those customers do.

[57:40] And they basically stop doing the rest of the 80%

[57:43] and they expand that 20% to be 100% of the business.

[57:47] And so by doing that, they can have the same size business,

[57:49] but five X the revenue, and arguably, even more on the profit.

[57:53] And so just parallel, the predoperable, 8020,

[57:56] and they just apply it to the customers.

[57:57] And so right now, this is how you do it for you.

[57:59] As you look at all the customers you have up to this point,

[58:02] you look at the top 20% and you say, okay,

[58:04] what do these people all have in common?

[58:05] And so I like to think about this

[58:06] in terms of psychographics, what do they think?

[58:08] Geographics, what do they live?

[58:10] Demographics, what do they look like?

[58:12] And then I would say like, action,

[58:13] so what have they done, or what do they do to get this result?

[58:15] And so when I look at each of those frames,

[58:17] I try and eliminate as many variables as I can,

[58:20] so I get to two or three variables

[58:21] that clump all the best customers together.

[58:23] And then I make that in my marketing,

[58:25] and I tell my sales team, we only sell these people going forward,

[58:28] because I know that these people were worth five times more,

[58:30] 10 times more, and then guess what's able to happen?

[58:32] We run ads for those people, and then our LTV skyrocket,

[58:36] so we can spend more to our customers,

[58:37] and this is what allows you to scale by going narrower.

[58:40] And so the problem is that most business owners

[58:42] can't say no to fast money,

[58:44] and so they never get the big money.

[58:46] And so I had two companies that came out for a workshop

[58:50] that we had, and one, they're both agencies.

[58:53] It's a very simple example.

[58:53] So one was a general agency.

[58:55] They just did anybody who knocked on the door,

[58:57] they would take their money.

[58:58] The other one just did professional services,

[59:00] so that's legal, financial, insurance,

[59:03] like those types of services.

[59:05] And the generalist guy said,

[59:07] okay, you have this big list of customers.

[59:08] I'm sure that there's a sub-segment of those customers

[59:10] that you do exceptionally well with.

[59:11] They're like, oh my God, we crush it for IT people,

[59:13] and I was like, okay, cool.

[59:15] So what percentage of your customers are there?

[59:16] They're like 8%, I was like,

[59:17] but are they more profitable about percentage?

[59:20] And they're like, oh, by a mile,

[59:21] they're by far the most profitable.

[59:22] I was like, okay, so if you're an entire business,

[59:25] and they were really struggling in terms of infrastructure,

[59:27] they were like super stressed out, you could see it.

[59:29] I was like, if your whole business was just those,

[59:31] do you think you'd like that business?

[59:32] And you was like, oh my God, that would be a breeze.

[59:33] And I was like, well, then we can build that business.

[59:35] And so that means that from here on out,

[59:36] you only sell those people.

[59:38] And over time, the percentage of the pie

[59:40] that those customers can continue to increase

[59:41] until eventually you can cut the customers

[59:43] that are not your main thing.

[59:44] And then in a year or two years,

[59:46] you've completely transformed your business

[59:47] to something that's been productized.

[59:48] You get really efficient, you get even better at it

[59:50] because you only serve those customers,

[59:51] you get better acquiring them, get better servicing them,

[59:53] you get higher margins, and you actually like your life.

[59:55] And so the same thing happened with the second agency,

[59:57] where I said, what are the customers you have?

[59:58] And they're like, actually we're really good at

[60:00] specifically family law attorneys,

[60:01] like divorce attorneys.

[60:02] And they had all these other things.

[60:04] I was like, but divorce attorneys are really good with them.

[60:06] Like yeah, I was like, then just sell divorce attorneys.

[60:08] And because the thing is if you just sell divorce attorneys,

[60:10] it's a multi-billion dollar per industry.

[60:12] Like there's no reason you can't do $100 million a year

[60:14] or $200 million a year, just selling those people

[60:17] and the same with the IT.

[60:19] So the idea is like, people start taking on more avatars

[60:21] because they think that's what's necessary to grow.

[60:23] But, and I've said this before,

[60:25] but better creates bigger, bigger creates blow.

[60:29] And so if the goal is to get bigger,

[60:31] you wanna focus, not on getting bigger,

[60:34] but on getting better, and then getting bigger occurs.

[60:37] Growth occurs as a result.

[60:38] Growth is not a goal.

[60:40] Growth is an outcome of inputs.

[60:42] And so I'm telling you like,

[60:43] it took me a very long time to understand this.

[60:45] So I'm trying to get like every entrepreneur has this ego goal

[60:48] of like I wanna hit this a month,

[60:49] and I don't have that a month, and I don't have that a month.

[60:51] But the thing is just like you don't wanna make the income

[60:52] of the goal, if you do, it gets really hard

[60:55] to get out of that game, because sometimes you take the wrong steps,

[60:57] you artificially inflate revenue,

[60:59] and then you increase costs to sustain that revenue,

[61:01] but it was the wrong strategic move.

[61:02] And then you can't go backwards, you stay in the cycle forever.

[61:05] You don't wanna do that.

[61:06] If you think, okay, how do I make the core thing

[61:08] that I do better?

[61:09] Because fundamentally, if this were twice as good,

[61:11] as it is now, would I be bigger?

[61:12] Yes, because your customers would demand it.

[61:14] You get far more leverage by doing the same thing

[61:17] a hundred times than doing a hundred things one time.

[61:19] And so the vast majority of businesses,

[61:21] especially when they're starting out

[61:22] or doing a hundred things one time,

[61:23] rather than the same thing a hundred times.

[61:25] And you get a hell of a lot better

[61:26] when you do something on the hundred times.

[61:27] And so that means that you drive up your operational efficiency,

[61:30] you drive up your gross profit,

[61:31] you get better at your acquisition,

[61:33] because you're marketing messaging, your sales scripting,

[61:35] the results that you can promise, all those things get better.

[61:38] And now you're competing in a smaller pond,

[61:40] so you can dominate everyone.

[61:41] But when people think small pond,

[61:42] they think that somehow that means

[61:43] that they're not gonna make a lot of money.

[61:44] Like I said, Jim once makes a lot of money.

[61:46] And it's in a very, very, very, very narrow niche.

[61:48] And so you've got to be more specific, most times,

[61:51] and break the limiting beliefs you have

[61:52] around the idea that like, okay,

[61:54] well, I just need to go for,

[61:55] you know, I've saturated carpractors, right?

[61:57] I've saturated this with $2 million a year

[62:00] and revenue, of course not, right?

[62:01] Every single other business that exists

[62:03] that serves your customer,

[62:04] the fact that they're allowed to be alive

[62:06] and breathe shows you how much opportunity you have

[62:08] if you were better than them.

[62:09] Number 10, provide value.

[62:11] Now everybody talks about providing value.

[62:13] What does that even mean?

[62:14] All right, so in this book,

[62:15] I talked about something called the value equation

[62:16] is probably the most cited chapter in this whole book.

[62:18] But I break down what are the elements of value?

[62:20] And so there are four.

[62:21] Number one is the dream outcome,

[62:23] which is what does somebody actually want?

[62:24] So if I were to offer like Daniel,

[62:27] who's behind the camera right now and say,

[62:28] hey, you can get in shape or I can make you million dollars, right?

[62:32] Making money for most men is more valuable

[62:34] than getting a better shape.

[62:35] And so the relative opportunity or the relative outcome

[62:39] will dictate how much money you can charge.

[62:41] That's why in general,

[62:42] B2B offers a higher ticket now.

[62:43] There are also fewer people who buy making money

[62:45] than people who buy consumer products.

[62:47] So you have about one tenth,

[62:48] so nine percent of people are business owners.

[62:50] So you have a much smaller market.

[62:51] That being said, the size of the market really matter,

[62:53] based on the thing I just said, probably not.

[62:55] But again, number one is dream outcome.

[62:57] That's what differentiates.

[62:58] Now, let's see, you have got two products

[63:00] that offer the same solution.

[63:01] So let's say the weight loss example,

[63:03] or the getting shape example.

[63:05] If I am a PDF for that and I've got a liposuction,

[63:08] both of them promise the same thing,

[63:10] which is that you're going to get a better shape,

[63:11] you're going to lose weight.

[63:12] Okay, well then, why is liposuction so much more expensive

[63:14] than a PDF that I could buy on the internet for 20 bucks?

[63:17] They both promise to say Malcolm,

[63:18] well, there's three other variables.

[63:19] So variable number one is to perceive likely to achievement,

[63:22] or the risk associated with the purchase.

[63:23] So risk would be the negative,

[63:24] perceive likely to achieve it as the positive.

[63:26] And so we want to increase the perceived likely

[63:28] as much as possible.

[63:29] So if we had that liposuction,

[63:30] and we've got one surgeon who's his first day out

[63:32] of medical school and we've got another surgeon

[63:33] who's done 10,000 surgeries,

[63:35] which of these guys can price higher.

[63:36] Well, obviously, you'd want to take the 10,000 one,

[63:38] even though it's the same procedure and the same outcome,

[63:40] the perceived likely to you actually getting what you want,

[63:42] the risk associated as lower,

[63:44] and so you're willing to pay more for that guy

[63:45] because you have more experience.

[63:47] The third variable of this is time delay.

[63:50] The equal opposite of that is speed,

[63:51] how quickly between when someone buys

[63:54] and when they get the promise that you outcome.

[63:56] Now, if you do liposuction, it's like,

[63:58] great, you make the purchase,

[63:59] then you go to sleep and you wake up in your thin.

[64:01] Very, very condensed, which is why it has a lot of value.

[64:04] Whereas if you have to do all this eating

[64:06] and this exercising and not drinking

[64:07] and changing your diet and all this waking up early

[64:09] and being sore, all this like there's a lot of delay there.

[64:14] In terms of how much time and effort it's time,

[64:16] specifically is going to take to get the outcome you want.

[64:19] So the faster it is, the more valuable it is.

[64:22] And then finally, you have effort and sacrifice

[64:24] or equal opposite ease.

[64:25] How easy can you make it?

[64:26] And so if you're trying to think about this in simple terms,

[64:29] it's how risk-free can I make it, how easy can I make it,

[64:32] how fast can I make it and is the thing

[64:34] that I'm promising, the outcome that I'm promising,

[64:36] something they actually want.

[64:37] And so if you have all four of those,

[64:38] you have something that people really want.

[64:40] They have no risk of doing it.

[64:41] It comes immediately and it's easy.

[64:43] It's easiest pushing a button.

[64:44] You've got an incredibly valuable thing.

[64:47] And so when people say add value, what you want to think about

[64:49] is what is my customer or what is my avatar

[64:51] want to accomplish or what do they want to avoid?

[64:54] So you've got towards good stuff and away from bad stuff.

[64:58] And say, say, okay, I can help you avoid this bad stuff,

[65:00] risk-free, faster and easier than otherwise.

[65:03] And the dream outcome, the good stuff, same thing again,

[65:06] is how can I help you get that good stuff,

[65:08] faster, easier and risk-free?

[65:10] And so every time you make content,

[65:12] or every time you make a PDF,

[65:13] every time you make a lead magnet, whatever it is,

[65:15] or you make content, the whole goal should be to be useful.

[65:18] The whole goal should be to provide value.

[65:19] And you do that by helping them achieve their goal,

[65:21] which hopefully with this video,

[65:22] I'll be in market better, your business,

[65:24] by making it risk-free, so you don't have to make mistakes

[65:26] I did, get your goal faster and get their easier.

[65:29] So the easiest way to think, okay, got it.

[65:31] Well, how do I find the problems that people are suffering

[65:33] from so that I can make it faster, easier and risk-free for them?

[65:36] Great question.

[65:37] So one is any comments that you get in response to content,

[65:40] that creates more content.

[65:41] This is the endless content wheel.

[65:42] It's like you make content.

[65:43] People have questions about the content,

[65:44] you make content about the questions,

[65:45] they have questions about that question.

[65:46] The good thing is that problems never end

[65:48] in people never stop complaining.

[65:49] And so as long as people stop complaining,

[65:50] people have problems, you're always gonna have problems

[65:52] to solve, which is one of the nice things

[65:53] about being entrepreneur.

[65:54] You're like humanity.

[65:55] If you told us hundreds of years ago

[65:57] that we'd have the internet in our hands,

[65:59] and we'd have air conditioning, and Wi-Fi,

[66:00] and all this stuff, we'd be like, oh my God,

[66:02] all of our problems to solve,

[66:03] but we have more problems now than we did before,

[66:04] because we're more aware of the problems

[66:05] that we didn't know existed before.

[66:07] And so whenever you solve a problem, you create another one.

[66:09] It's the problem solution cycle that never ends.

[66:11] And so one is you can look at that.

[66:12] The other is you can look internal to your business,

[66:13] which is what are the things that people struggle

[66:15] with internal in terms of implementation

[66:17] for whatever the thing that you do is,

[66:18] whether it's a product that you sell or a service

[66:20] that you sell, there's some friction points along the way.

[66:22] And you think, okay, what are the friction points

[66:24] and how can I make it easier?

[66:25] Number 11 is a fairly well-known marketing saying,

[66:27] give away the secrets, sell the implementation.

[66:29] The way that I think about this is make your free stuff

[66:32] better than their paid stuff.

[66:33] And that's an easyism to say.

[66:34] But the real real is like you actually have to think,

[66:37] if I give away something for free,

[66:39] I have to be willing to charge for it.

[66:41] And if you were willing to charge $100 or $1,000

[66:43] or $10,000 for the thing that you give away for free,

[66:46] my God must that be valuable.

[66:48] Yes, and what that does is it increases

[66:49] the likelihood of conversion,

[66:50] increase the likelihood of the person consumes the thing

[66:52] and then buys the next product.

[66:54] Because what a lead magnet is or what content is,

[66:56] it's a complete solution to a very narrow problem.

[66:59] And that's fundamentally how I think about this.

[67:00] A lot of people are very afraid of giving away value,

[67:02] but you shouldn't be.

[67:04] Give away all the secrets, give away all the things

[67:06] that you do.

[67:07] And then if someone wants help with implementation,

[67:08] they can call you up.

[67:10] And this allows you to provide value to the masses,

[67:12] build your brand up.

[67:13] And then they use results in advance as an approximation

[67:17] of the results that they're going to get after they purchase.

[67:19] And so even when you're marketing

[67:21] in terms of making content,

[67:22] I'd like to think of being okay with narrow

[67:25] because deep is where the dollars are.

[67:28] So let me tell you a couple stories about this.

[67:29] So there was a lady who I just recently met,

[67:32] who was doing just under $1,000 a year in profit.

[67:36] From 5,800 followers on Instagram.

[67:40] She had no other platform,

[67:41] she swore 100% from Instagram.

[67:43] And this blew my mind.

[67:44] I mean, I say this stuff,

[67:46] but having that level,

[67:47] like it was such an extreme example of tiny audience,

[67:50] big money, it broke my beliefs even further,

[67:53] then I already had them broken.

[67:55] And when I looked at her page, here's what's crazy.

[67:57] It wasn't like she had crazy deep engagement either.

[67:59] It was like the post you would get would get,

[68:01] you know, one, five, maybe 10 comments on a great post.

[68:05] And she would get, you know, 10 likes,

[68:08] 20 likes, 30 likes if it was a crazy one.

[68:11] But 100% of her content was about how registered

[68:16] dietitians can more accurately build insurance

[68:19] to make more money.

[68:21] It was a niche of a niche.

[68:22] It was literally like registered dietitians

[68:25] who billing insurance and how to bill insurance,

[68:28] more effectively to make more power.

[68:29] That was her offer.

[68:30] And that's all she talks about.

[68:32] Her cheat sheets are on that.

[68:33] She talks about different insurance companies

[68:36] and how to bill each of them, the codes that you go,

[68:38] the plug-in, like all this jargon,

[68:40] I had no idea when I went to the page.

[68:42] But for her avatar, I'll bet you the of the 5,800 people

[68:45] that follow her, 5,700 of them were registered dietitians

[68:50] who were trying to find out what they needed to do

[68:53] to make more money by billing insurance.

[68:54] And so she was selling five to 10 little cheat sheets a day,

[68:58] like 99 bucks, plus two to three,

[69:02] high ticket people per week into her thing,

[69:05] into her association of registered dietitians

[69:08] that followed her process for billing.

[69:10] And so I say this because I've also learned this personally.

[69:13] We used to make some wider content for about six months.

[69:15] We did this experiment.

[69:16] We got the data back.

[69:17] It turned out we got lots of views,

[69:18] but we didn't go lots of business owners.

[69:20] And so we switched back to hardcore business stuff,

[69:21] which I love anyway, so I'm very happy about the experiment.

[69:24] And because of that, all of our stats are up.

[69:26] So we have more opt-ins, more people buying books, more people,

[69:29] you know, go to workshops, whatever it is,

[69:31] more people will apply to the portfolio,

[69:32] so we can invest in their companies.

[69:33] All of those stats were up despite the fact

[69:35] that the general views per video went down.

[69:37] And again, I'm here for the money, not for the fame.

[69:39] And so I encourage you, if you can break your attachment

[69:42] to the eagom metrics, like the likes,

[69:44] and the views, and things like that,

[69:45] and just focus on the bottom line,

[69:47] just get really specific on the avatar that you want to serve,

[69:51] and make content only for them that's useful.

[69:54] So I've got a buddy of mine who runs a multi-ninete figure

[69:56] per year marketing company.

[69:59] And he makes content online.

[70:00] And he has a personal brand.

[70:01] And he was like, oh, dude, my personal brand makes no money.

[70:04] He's like, but, and he goes super in-depth tactical

[70:08] like stuff.

[70:09] He's an SEOG, and so all of this stuff is like,

[70:11] how to make SEO content, blog content, and things like that.

[70:14] And his content gets like so few likes and engagement.

[70:18] And he has like charts and graphs,

[70:20] and all this data support all he does.

[70:22] He's obviously really, really good at this.

[70:23] But the thing is, his lead quality that comes from him,

[70:27] is like they're all Fortune 500, Fortune 100,

[70:29] CEOs, executives that are like, hey,

[70:32] you obviously know this stuff, can we just hire you?

[70:34] And that's exactly what he wants.

[70:36] He wants, he makes it so complex.

[70:38] He gives away everything.

[70:39] And he says it.

[70:40] You could just follow all my stuff and do it.

[70:41] Most people are like, man, this is too much work.

[70:43] And so they can, I just hire you,

[70:45] which is an exceptional way to get customers.

[70:48] So here's how you do it in three easy steps.

[70:51] One, is you just give away your best stuff.

[70:53] Give it all away.

[70:54] If you have a low ticket thing that sells to lots of people,

[70:56] if a high ticket thing, I would encourage you,

[70:58] just give away the low ticket thing too.

[70:59] You're probably not making those money on it anyways.

[71:00] And those customers will probably pay in the butt.

[71:02] So just give it to him.

[71:03] And you can even show, hey, I used to charge for this,

[71:04] I'm giving it to you for free, because I love you.

[71:06] And by doing that, you make an exceptional thing.

[71:08] And you put really heavy effort into follow-up

[71:13] and cost action within the content itself.

[71:16] So within the thing that you're giving away,

[71:17] you have CTAs, and you follow up with your team

[71:19] to try and ascend them in the next thing,

[71:21] if they're qualified.

[71:22] And I'll give you a pro tip on this.

[71:24] When you want to make the CTA, make it about personalization,

[71:28] not about more.

[71:29] So to say, hey, if you want more stuff like this go here,

[71:31] say, hey, if you want me to help apply this stuff

[71:34] to your business or apply this stuff to your body

[71:36] or this stuff to your life, then let me know.

[71:38] It's personalizing it, because that is significantly

[71:40] more valuable than just more stuff.

[71:42] And what's crazy is that a lot of people

[71:44] use the things they give away as an afterthought.

[71:45] It's the last thing they think about.

[71:47] But here's the crazy step.

[71:48] Is that 99% of people who consume your free thing

[71:51] will never buy from you, which means that your reputation

[71:53] is getting made by the 99% of people, not the 1%.

[71:56] And so if you want to improve your reputation

[71:57] in the marketplace, make sure the stuff that you give away

[71:59] for free is awesome.

[72:01] Also make sure the stuff that you sell is awesome.

[72:03] And if both of those things sound like a four-letter word,

[72:04] which is work, welcome to business.

[72:07] And so I talked earlier about going up market

[72:09] or getting narrower on the average, I think

[72:10] want to serve.

[72:11] A lot of people have downsells, and I think over time,

[72:13] I've gotten less and less into having downsells

[72:15] and more alonglines of like, if we have a lower avatar

[72:18] and we're downselling 10% of calls into this thing that's paid,

[72:22] if 10% of people are buying something that's

[72:24] one-tenth of price because it's a downsell,

[72:25] then it's going to change my revenue by 1%.

[72:28] I don't really care.

[72:28] It's not even worth the headache.

[72:29] I'd rather just give that away to hundreds of people

[72:32] for free because of the cost of free,

[72:33] way more people will consume it.

[72:34] And then get a higher percentage people to buy my next thing.

[72:37] And I allow my marketing messaging to attract

[72:40] the higher quality customers.

[72:41] So this will last me to go up market or narrower

[72:43] and give away all the other stuff

[72:44] so I can create my more qualified customers.

[72:46] The amount of businesses that I know that one that we've invested

[72:49] and do that we've helped simply make way more money

[72:52] by just giving away the thing that was their big headache,

[72:54] that was a low ticket thing,

[72:55] just so that they could focus on serving the best customers.

[72:59] Most times you'll make money going up market.

[73:01] Market Vice Number 12, all advertising works,

[73:04] it's just a matter of efficiency.

[73:07] I'm really, I want to drill this down people so it's the amount

[73:09] of time I've said Facebook guys don't work for us.

[73:11] Googleize don't work for us.

[73:12] TikTok guys don't work for us.

[73:13] Direct me out as a work for us.

[73:13] Radio has no work for us.

[73:14] Content as a work for us.

[73:15] How it resists work for us.

[73:16] Fundamentally, if you have a qualified person on the other side

[73:20] and you make an offer to them that solves the key problem for them,

[73:24] if you can get them on the phone, you can make money, period.

[73:27] So if you can refraize the problem is I don't know how to make

[73:30] Facebook guys work for us.

[73:31] I don't know how to make TikTok work for us.

[73:32] I don't know how to make content work for us.

[73:34] I don't know how to make outreach for us.

[73:35] The net becomes a problem that you can solve.

[73:37] Now, this is really important.

[73:39] So I talked earlier about optimizing your advertising

[73:41] from front to back and that's true.

[73:44] But when you optimize a business,

[73:45] you optimize this from back to front.

[73:47] And so the back, the LTV, how much you make per customer enables

[73:52] how much you can spend on the front end.

[73:54] And so you optimize the throughput on the front end,

[73:57] obviously because that's where you can get the highest returns.

[73:59] But the engine that you can spend on that depends on how much you

[74:03] make per customer.

[74:04] And so you can either be really, really, really exceptional at

[74:08] Lauren Kack or really, really good at increasing LTV.

[74:11] And if you do both, you have huge arbitrage and that's where you

[74:14] make stupid money.

[74:15] And so let's go through hypothetical.

[74:17] Let's say that you sold something that was a billion dollar thing.

[74:21] If you had a billion dollars in gross profit that you'd make from

[74:23] one sale, you could reach a lot of people on earth.

[74:26] And just to give you context on this, if I wanted to become

[74:29] a less celebrity, I back calculated what I believe it cost

[74:32] to become an a-less celebrity.

[74:33] It was about $15 million.

[74:35] And the way that I calculated that was I thought, what person went

[74:38] from complete obscure and so no one knew who they were,

[74:40] obscurity to omnipresence or somebody like that,

[74:45] everybody knew.

[74:46] And so the simplest example are people who were no name actors who

[74:50] become the star of a big Marvel hit.

[74:53] And so what I did was I said, OK, how many of these have I seen?

[74:55] What was the movie budget?

[74:57] Now you have to divide that by the other characters in the show

[74:59] or in the movie.

[75:00] And between the big blockbusters where we had to,

[75:03] you think about like the Hunger Games girl, right?

[75:06] I can't remember a name right now.

[75:06] But that girl.

[75:07] Like the marketing budget for those types of films,

[75:10] you say, OK, with $50 million she went from no knowing who she was

[75:14] to being famous.

[75:15] And so for $50 million you can reach so much of America.

[75:18] And so I used this as I have a political

[75:19] because if you had something that you sold for a billion dollars,

[75:21] you could spend that in some like $20 to want.

[75:24] And so the idea is, yes, we optimize our advertising from front

[75:27] to back.

[75:27] We put our effort on the front.

[75:29] But in terms of where our LTV comes from,

[75:32] we work from back to front so that we can spend more on the front end.

[75:36] A big problem in terms of efficiency is that oftentimes,

[75:38] if you do start running ads profitably, for example,

[75:42] you reach some sort of ceiling.

[75:43] You're like, hey, we can't get past $1,000 today.

[75:45] We can't get past $10,000 today.

[75:46] We can't get past $100,000 today.

[75:48] Whatever it is, right?

[75:49] Usually it's because the ads that you have are good enough to reach

[75:52] the next level of awareness.

[75:53] So Eugene Schwartz in breakthrough advertising talked about something

[75:55] called five levels of awareness.

[75:56] And so they go from unaware.

[75:58] Somebody is no idea who you are, what the problem is or anything

[76:00] for just unaware.

[76:01] The next level is problem aware.

[76:03] That's where you see ads that are like having trouble sleeping

[76:04] at night.

[76:05] Do you have back pain when you lean over?

[76:07] Like things like that.

[76:08] They ask open-in questions that make someone aware of the problem.

[76:11] Underneath of that is solutionware.

[76:12] Have you tried this before?

[76:14] Have you tried this before?

[76:15] This is where someone knows the solutions that potentially exist.

[76:18] Then you have product aware, which is them advertising your own product.

[76:21] Like, okay, have you tried my product before?

[76:24] And let me talk you about this.

[76:25] And then finally, you have most aware,

[76:26] which is usually past and existing customers.

[76:28] And so there's a five-low awareness.

[76:30] And so most times, smaller advertisers, beginner advertisers,

[76:33] get returns, marketing too, most aware.

[76:35] If you email your list, you make a post,

[76:37] or you send out an email, right?

[76:39] Those are some of the most aware people.

[76:40] So you can make sales from that for almost no money.

[76:42] One degree above that is like, okay,

[76:44] or other people in the market, that's product

[76:45] or whether they're looking for something

[76:48] to solve a specific problem, right?

[76:50] And they're aware of the options that are out there

[76:52] and you market them.

[76:52] So you have to be a little bit better

[76:54] to market those people than to just your existing customers.

[76:56] Now, if you go one level above that, right?

[76:57] Solutionware is that they know that there are people

[77:00] who are solving this problem.

[77:00] They don't know how they're solving the problem.

[77:02] They know that there is a solution that exists.

[77:04] And so you have to have another order of magnitude improvement

[77:07] of your ads and the hooks to call out those people.

[77:09] And so most times, the problem isn't that your market

[77:13] isn't big enough.

[77:13] It's that your ads aren't good enough.

[77:15] And they're not specific enough to hit this next massive

[77:18] trunch of the audience.

[77:19] And I say this with our largest company

[77:21] in the portfolio, it is about $100 million a year.

[77:24] And we spend millions of dollars a month in advertising.

[77:27] And we go to the most unaware people.

[77:29] We go to people who have no idea that this product

[77:32] or this problem exists.

[77:33] We actually have to make them aware of the problem.

[77:35] And then we make them aware of the opportunity to solve.

[77:37] And then we have to make them aware of the problem.

[77:39] We have to take them through all the stages of awareness

[77:40] in a very short period of time.

[77:42] And that comes from a very well crafted ad.

[77:44] And so I have this saying that I have internal,

[77:46] which is that the size of the plane is directly correlated

[77:49] with the length of the runway, the bigger the plane,

[77:51] the longer the runway.

[77:52] And so if you want to solve a very expensive thing,

[77:54] or you want to solve a very cold person.

[77:56] So the price and the coldness or how aware the person is.

[78:00] So the longest sale possible would be someone who's completely

[78:03] unaware for a very expensive thing.

[78:05] The shortest sale possible would be someone who's very aware

[78:08] for a very cheap thing.

[78:09] And so the amount of runway, the amount of selling,

[78:11] the amount of advertising that you have to do

[78:12] to get to someone through these stages,

[78:13] is directly proportional to those two things.

[78:16] And if you're having trouble scaling,

[78:17] it usually means that this is mismatched.

[78:20] You're sending a warm message to a cold audience,

[78:22] or you're getting people on the phone

[78:23] who aren't prepared to spend a huge amount of money

[78:26] that have been warmed up enough.

[78:27] And so it's making sure that we're hitting each of these boxes

[78:30] for the audience that we're starting to target.

[78:32] And so as you go to a new trunch of,

[78:34] let's say you go from a solution where to problem awareness.

[78:36] It's a bigger area.

[78:38] And so think about these concentric circles,

[78:39] like a pizza.

[78:40] The area of the pizza, you'd like a pizza that's this big.

[78:43] If you could take an inch off, it's almost the same size

[78:45] as a two inch pizza in the middle.

[78:47] Like the diameters or conference, whatever that is,

[78:49] I probably failed geometry.

[78:50] The point is, is that it just gets bigger

[78:53] and explanation bigger as you go out.

[78:55] And so this is a weird visual that I have for this.

[78:58] But if you think about a watermelon slice,

[79:01] and at the tip, there's lots of seeds.

[79:03] And as you go down, there's fewer seeds.

[79:05] But you still have to pay the same amount

[79:06] to reach all these eyeballs to find the few seeds

[79:09] versus in the beginning when you have lots of seeds.

[79:10] So your density of sales per thousand eyeballs

[79:13] goes down as you go to more on a wear people.

[79:16] Because you're gonna go to people

[79:17] who just simply don't care and never will care.

[79:19] But you have to, and this is where the LTV matters so much

[79:21] and the optimization matters so much.

[79:23] But you still, if you can be profitable in a larger trunch

[79:26] that's 10 or 100 times as big,

[79:28] that's when you start really printing money.

[79:30] Right? And so if you have, call it 20 to 1,

[79:33] LTV to cack in the beginning

[79:33] when you have lots of little seeds.

[79:35] Lots of density of potential buyers

[79:36] gets really warm, really problem wear,

[79:37] or really, really solution or product wear,

[79:39] like really high end.

[79:41] As you go down, you might drop to five to one

[79:44] in the middle.

[79:45] You might drop to three to one at scale,

[79:46] but you're at 100 times the spend.

[79:49] And so in that case, you're still making way more absolute

[79:51] return on the investment.

[79:53] Another way to think about this is like a golf course.

[79:55] And so if you could only put, then you're gonna only make

[79:58] six inch pots that's only the top little seeds of the watermelon.

[80:01] But think about how much more area,

[80:03] if you learn how to drive and you learn how to hit a three iron,

[80:08] I'm not very good at golf.

[80:09] You can obviously tell.

[80:09] And then you learn how to hit a wedge.

[80:11] There's so many more shots that you can make

[80:13] if you have these other skills in your arsenal.

[80:15] And so think about each of the levels of awareness

[80:17] as another club that you have to learn how to hit

[80:19] so that you can get more balls in the hole

[80:21] from any part of the course.

[80:22] Marketing advice number 13, we need to be reminded,

[80:24] more than we need to be taught.

[80:26] And I think this is when it's gonna break a lot of your beliefs.

[80:28] So I wanna really emphasize this one

[80:30] because it's important.

[80:32] Once you start making content, once you start running ads

[80:34] and you start putting stuff out publicly,

[80:35] you start advertising.

[80:37] You're gonna get to a point where like,

[80:38] I feel like I've said everything that I was going to say.

[80:40] Now, remember, you continue to live life every day,

[80:43] you continue to do stuff and you can talk about what you did.

[80:45] So that can break that.

[80:46] But my mom said this to me once and I always remember it.

[80:50] She said the news never changes just the names.

[80:53] And I really thought about that.

[80:54] It was like, there's always a rape, there's a war,

[80:55] there's a murder, there's a car accident.

[80:57] Like the actual story doesn't change only the names.

[81:00] And so if you think of it that with content,

[81:02] like there is no new content,

[81:03] like the human condition is not changed for thousands of years.

[81:05] Like the older the problem, the older the solution.

[81:07] And so we're making content and we're putting stuff out there.

[81:12] And when I think about myself, things that I follow,

[81:15] like I follow philosophy pages because I am okay

[81:19] rereading epictetus of stuff, like I read stuff before

[81:22] and I read it in quote form again and when it comes up again,

[81:24] I like to be reminded.

[81:25] I like to keep the stuff top of mind.

[81:27] That's why I follow those pages.

[81:29] And many people follow your pages for that exact same reason.

[81:31] Is that the stuff you talk about,

[81:33] it's stuff that they want to keep top of mind.

[81:34] They want to be reminded of that stuff.

[81:36] And getting taught is much more difficult than being

[81:38] reminded but they're equally valuable.

[81:39] Because it changes their behavior

[81:41] than you still did teach them.

[81:42] Again, you just reminded them.

[81:44] And what's crazy about this is that like the French show right now,

[81:47] if you've ever heard of it, is being watched more now

[81:50] than it was a few years ago.

[81:53] So reruns, like people watch reruns

[81:56] because there's nostalgia or whatever reason

[81:57] that you want to pick to it.

[81:58] But people are willing to rewatch the same thing

[82:00] because they know how it ends, they know they liked it.

[82:03] And so you can make the same thing again.

[82:06] Because also your audience who's new a year later

[82:10] hasn't seen that thing.

[82:11] And so if you make something new to them,

[82:14] even though it's called old or reminder to your existing audience,

[82:16] if you're existing audience, it doesn't mind the reminder.

[82:18] And the new people never saw it to begin with.

[82:20] And if you want to have different ways of creating variety,

[82:23] even around the same topics, I would encourage you,

[82:25] instead of getting into trend hacking

[82:28] and talking about the news, talk about your news.

[82:31] So it's about what are the new things that are happening now.

[82:33] This is the do epic stuff, talk about what you did.

[82:36] And so this is where we tell new stories

[82:39] to explain the same concept.

[82:40] Because for that specific audience,

[82:42] you'll reach a different type of person

[82:44] or different avatar that still might be within your market

[82:46] with a story about a mother and daughter versus a father

[82:49] and a son versus a military vet versus a small business

[82:53] owner.

[82:54] There are different avatars and you can tell the same story,

[82:56] but it happens to a different name, just like the news.

[82:59] And people still watch the news every single day,

[83:00] and then we want it to watch ours.

[83:03] You can tell the same concept, like the value equation.

[83:06] The value equation I explained in my book,

[83:08] I also have a course on my site

[83:09] that I explained the value equation in a different format.

[83:12] So think about it in terms of formats.

[83:13] This is written, I have an audio, I've got videos

[83:16] that are my site that are in a course format.

[83:17] I'm mentioning it here now, I have it on whiteboards

[83:20] that I've explained it, I've applied it to services,

[83:23] I've applied it to education, I've applied it to physical products,

[83:27] I've applied it to software, and so you can take the same idea

[83:30] and think how can I display it in new formats,

[83:32] new mediums, and new contexts.

[83:34] And so when you have that, and then you extrapolate

[83:37] on top the news of your life, even though you feel

[83:40] like it's saying the same thing, the amount that it takes

[83:43] to create something novel is very small.

[83:45] And so I'll tell you the story that I think will wrap this up,

[83:47] but the story of Henry Ford.

[83:49] And so Henry Ford had in his office

[83:51] he does marketing person right next to him.

[83:53] So he walked past the marketing person over and over.

[00:00] So if you need money, that's number one.

[00:02] Easiest thing to do.

[00:03] And so what I wanted to cover today was I'm

[00:05] calling cash flows oxygen, how to get some.

[00:08] But this is actually part of a larger discussion

[00:12] that I'm half targeting towards my coaches and half y'all

[00:15] can just join in on what I would be talking to him about.

[00:19] And so one of the skills that a coach has to have,

[00:23] and if you are coaching yourself,

[00:25] you're the master of your own business, right?

[00:28] And you have to coach you better than anyone else can, right?

[00:30] That's good to have outside counsel.

[00:31] That's what we have coaching this while I get coaching.

[00:33] But you have to be your own coach because you're the one who's

[00:35] going to be making the decisions for your business

[00:36] for the name of the hospital, right?

[00:38] And so oftentimes, when I am on the phone with a business owner,

[00:43] I am listening for the majority of the time of that call.

[00:47] And I'm looking for certain things.

[00:49] And so some of you may have heard of a SWAT analysis, right?

[00:52] Strength weaknesses opportunities and threats.

[00:56] More commonly now in MBA schools,

[00:58] they've actually reversed that.

[00:59] They call it an ought to.

[01:00] And what that means is opportunities, threats are disproportionately

[01:05] weighted as far more important.

[01:07] And then then you have strengths and weaknesses.

[01:12] And so the reason that I'm saying this is that most times,

[01:15] when I'm listening to a client who's saying,

[01:17] I'm struggling, I'm having an issue where I'm at a bottleneck,

[01:19] doesn't necessarily need to be that they're losing money,

[01:21] but just to like, I can't get past this point, what's the issue?

[01:25] I'm going to be looking for cash flow opportunities

[01:28] that are sitting on the ground and massive threats.

[01:31] Those are the two things I'm looking for in the beginning.

[01:33] Once those boxes check off,

[01:35] then we go down to strengths and weaknesses.

[01:37] For example, if someone is bleeding cash,

[01:41] I'm not going to tell them to fix their culture, right?

[01:45] Fixing their culture is something that they absolutely need to do,

[01:48] but it's not going to be the thing that's going to save their business

[01:50] tomorrow, right?

[01:51] They need money.

[01:52] And so it's one of the things that drives me nuts

[01:55] because it's not prioritizing the actions according to how important they are,

[02:00] right?

[02:00] And so an example of this, I mean, I just use the culture example,

[02:03] but let me look at another one.

[02:04] Here's a more relevant one, retention, right?

[02:07] And believe me, I'm like the king of making sure

[02:09] that you're doing a good job to your customers, right?

[02:12] But if your retention is shit, right?

[02:14] It's absolutely shit.

[02:15] That's if you need to make payroll in the next 30 days,

[02:19] implementing retention system is not going to solve your problem.

[02:22] It's going to take 12 weeks for that to pay now.

[02:24] Now, this is what you should do, absolutely.

[02:27] After you have milked out all the big opportunities

[02:31] that's sitting in front of you and ensure that you're not

[02:33] going to kill yourself with stress state.

[02:34] Now, if your retention is like you're turning 30% of the month,

[02:38] that becomes a threat, it's like going to weed this.

[02:40] It's a threat itself to your business.

[02:42] Now, the number one thing that I see, and this is like,

[02:46] when I'm getting on the phone now, and occasionally

[02:49] take calls, which everyone should kind of like just poke and listen,

[02:52] and I try to advertise it because I could,

[02:55] like I actually thought about this like yesterday,

[02:56] the lay-loss, like I wonder if I can take one call with everyone.

[02:59] If I did 30 minutes for every person once a month,

[03:02] then I was like, oh, no, it's still taking me three months.

[03:04] So I can't do it.

[03:04] I tried, and I thought about it, can't work.

[03:06] So all you was giving lessons that I have learned from the

[03:08] people that have spoken with.

[03:10] And so if, for example, you don't have a 101 nutrition

[03:14] and accountability program that you have plugged into your

[03:16] facility on top of your training, that is the biggest

[03:19] opportunity that sits on top of your business right now.

[03:23] Would you like to have an extra $15,000 a month spent $0.00

[03:25] in ad spend to get it in 28 days, and you have literally no

[03:29] risk, and it's only profit that you'd add on top of your

[03:31] business, basically no cost.

[03:33] You don't have that?

[03:34] Cool.

[03:35] Nothing else that you were going to do is going to matter.

[03:38] And so this is called opportunity cost of all of the things

[03:42] that we can do, doing this alternative, what

[03:46] other things are we doing that we're saying, note it, right?

[03:50] Picking out which of the opportunities to focus on is usually

[03:57] the focus of a good coach.

[04:00] And this is where experience of a coach matters, because they

[04:04] have more plays in their arsenal.

[04:06] They have more cards up there, sleeve that they have seen

[04:08] be executed with precision over a short period of time.

[04:12] And so to a new coach, they may only have, OK, we need to run

[04:17] more ads, we need to work our loot harder, we need to sell

[04:19] it.

[04:20] Those are all very true things.

[04:22] Those in my opinion would sit within the strengths and

[04:24] weaknesses area, right?

[04:26] But if you are bleeding cash, and you need to make money

[04:29] fast, right?

[04:30] There are three things that will make you money fast.

[04:33] One is if all three of them, by the way, include selling

[04:37] ship to your existing customers.

[04:39] That is it.

[04:40] You don't have enough time to start a campaign, brain people in

[04:43] market, it's something like that takes time.

[04:45] And if you don't have it, then there's only three to make money

[04:48] and all three are selling to your existing customer base.

[04:51] In a gym, the first and easiest and least amount of anything

[04:55] effort is to three people run a reason why campaign, which is

[05:00] like, hey, I just turned 30.

[05:03] And because of 30, I'm going to take three people with me on a

[05:05] one-year transformation to me awesome.

[05:07] And only, like I said, I'm only taking three people on.

[05:10] It's me $3,000.

[05:12] You know, text me if you want it.

[05:14] Just like that, you make nine grand.

[05:15] All right, you have 100 people that you're going to have to

[05:17] take the offer.

[05:18] So if you need money, that's number one.

[05:21] Easiest thing to do.

[05:22] You don't want to sell all of those, limit it, limit yourself.

[05:25] But those cash pops help.

[05:27] Right?

[05:27] Cash is oxygen.

[05:28] So you can buy yourself time to have more perspective to make

[05:31] better judgments about the business.

[05:34] Next play is you run an internal plate

[05:36] you're existing customers.

[05:37] Right?

[05:38] Now, I guess this will technically be like subset A and subset B,

[05:41] which would be the final two.

[05:43] If you have a normal gym, if you just want to run like a big

[05:48] booty book camp or an abs challenge or whatever, right?

[05:51] Doesn't really matter, right?

[05:52] Bungzing guts.

[05:53] Any of those things, you can market your existing customer base.

[05:56] And you have two things that you can do from there.

[05:58] One is you can actually sell the thing itself, which normally you'll get

[06:01] about 20, 25% take rate of your entire customer base if you sell between

[06:04] 100 to 200 dollars.

[06:06] And so if you have 150 people, 25% would be whatever that is.

[06:12] I don't know, like 35ish, 40ish, whatever somewhere in there.

[06:17] And so you have 35 people who sell up at let's say 150.

[06:21] Okay, well, made five grand.

[06:23] But then you have some more fulfillment.

[06:24] So maybe the painful thing, the three people might be a better

[06:27] play for that.

[06:28] So we'll see which one, if you did the other one recently, then that would

[06:31] probably be the play did.

[06:32] Now, if you wanted to make even more money, right?

[06:35] Then you should make the thing free that you're giving away.

[06:39] And then upsell them into food and supplements, right?

[06:41] Upsell them additional services once they start because you'll get an 85% take rate

[06:45] and you'll close 80, 90% on the upside.

[06:49] So it's more work.

[06:50] But again, in a short period of time, you can sell people, other stuff that's

[06:55] ancillary services.

[06:56] And that's all free money.

[06:57] There's no fulfillment that really has to happen.

[07:01] And so you buy something or in our case, you don't buy something.

[07:04] You just go into prestige labs and you click send and then you never have to

[07:08] touch in Detroit.

[07:09] But point is, you're taking something for $5.

[07:12] You're selling it for 20 and then you just take the end between.

[07:15] And that's it.

[07:16] The extra shopping, you keep the money.

[07:18] Great, right?

[07:19] So that's another easy way of making 10, 15, $20,000 in a month.

[07:25] The third thing, and this is the one that I'm going to drill home for everyone,

[07:29] is that you have the same amount of effort that is going to go into dealing with any kind

[07:34] of internal plug.

[07:35] So beyond the first thing, which is like quick text class limited spaces, make 10 grand

[07:39] small.

[07:40] That's like, make 10 grand a month.

[07:42] But if you want to make, like if you want to start having established recurring revenue,

[07:47] right, add an additional level of service, right?

[07:51] Simply giving people one-on-one nutrition, one-on-one accountability.

[07:54] That's it.

[07:55] A lot of people struggle with getting the gym.

[07:56] A lot of people would love someone to tax them every morning, ask them what their weight

[08:00] is, how they're doing, make sure they shop at the gym.

[08:03] What this also does is your churn goes through the floor.

[08:06] As in, like your retention goes up, people start turning out because they have a regular

[08:09] communication hits.

[08:10] Now, if I had 150 customers, what I did, I would, being the enterprise and the mobile

[08:17] phone that I am, give everyone at my gym 28 days free or 21 days free.

[08:22] Or 14 days free, depending on how much work I have.

[08:25] Right?

[08:26] For me, if I get every one of my gym, all 150 people, an amazing one-on-one experience

[08:32] that they've never had before.

[08:34] And then after this 20-day, you can keep doing this for 49 bucks extra a week.

[08:39] Right?

[08:40] And that's half what I'm going to sell new people into it.

[08:42] So they're getting a great deal, right?

[08:44] What percentage of people do you think would say?

[08:46] You have one-on-one contact with them for a whole month.

[08:49] Let me say.

[08:50] Half?

[08:51] Being a third would stay probably higher than the third.

[08:53] Being half would say?

[08:55] I think it's higher than a half, but let's just say half.

[08:57] Right?

[08:58] Half-stay.

[08:59] Now, you're not going to get 100% take rate because you never get 100% take rate on these types

[09:03] of things.

[09:04] But you get 85%, let's say you get 120 people to take the offer, where you get half to

[09:08] stay.

[09:09] So you got 60.

[09:10] And you got 60 at $200 a month extra that are paying for one-on-one attrition accountability,

[09:15] what's the cost of fulfillment there?

[09:17] Very low.

[09:18] Right?

[09:19] 20% goes to a coach.

[09:20] Cool.

[09:21] See, pay $2400 out of your 12.

[09:23] Right?

[09:24] $26.

[09:25] And now, every single month from this month going forward, you make your 10 grand a month.

[09:31] And that is profit that is in your pocket that you can do tomorrow.

[09:35] Right?

[09:36] So if you need more profit, if you need more cash, there's a million ways to do it.

[09:41] And a lot of times, like, and this is me, somebody who's a long-term player, sometimes

[09:47] if you need it fast, fixing your culture is not going to do it.

[09:50] You need cash today.

[09:51] And so once you can have that and you can plug the hole, you can plug it throughout

[09:55] or whatever it is.

[09:56] Right?

[09:57] Then you can start fixing the processes that got you into this pickle to begin with.

[10:01] But sometimes you need cash tomorrow.

[10:02] And so those are the three easiest ways that you can get cash tomorrow.

[10:06] The last one, one-on-one attrition accountability by the different different.

[10:11] Because of marketing, so don't get scared away.

[10:13] You're attrition accountability kind of part of the game in your gym.

[10:15] And that being said, it's free money.

[10:18] And so if I'm talking to a gym owner, I'm going to try to do it.

[10:21] And check off the boxes of which of these things they have done.

[10:24] And most times when I look at all the opportunities they have in the floor, in front of them,

[10:31] asking them to take it.

[10:33] And so right now, if you're looking at your business, there's probably a million things

[10:37] that you could do and arguably should do.

[10:41] But which one thing, given the same amount of time, is going to make you the most money.

[10:46] Forget about everything else and just do that.

[10:48] And most times, you're going to make the right call.

[10:50] And what a good coach is supposed to do is figure out of all the plays that they know

[10:54] on their arsenal, all the cards that they have to play, which one is best suited to you right

[10:59] now that can have high impact and require low resources.

[11:04] Those are the best.

[11:05] High impact, high resources.

[11:07] Like yes, it's going to take a lot, but it's going to cost a lot.

[11:12] Whereas here, you actually get the benefit of having the profit without the risk.

[11:15] Right?

[11:16] I'm not saying front ads spend.

[11:17] I'm not saying, there's literally nothing that needs to get added to your business

[11:21] besides the one person with 60 clients, one person can handle that.

[11:24] And that can be you if you want to.

[11:25] You can keep the extra $2400.

[11:27] Sure call.

[11:28] But all that to say, if you're looking at your business, it is your job to be able to

[11:35] weigh which of the things that are in front of you because there's a million plays that are

[11:39] out there.

[11:40] That's where people get overwhelmed.

[11:41] I don't know, should I run a 28-day transformation?

[11:43] Should I run an internal play?

[11:44] Should I run a paid-and-fool?

[11:46] Should I run a year change?

[11:47] Should I run a hybrid?

[11:48] Should I run a hybrid?

[11:49] Ooh, I don't want to kind of believe in your tradition.

[11:52] Right?

[11:53] What should I do?

[11:54] Look at which one makes you the most money and takes the least amount of resources.

[11:57] Depends how quickly you need the money.

[11:58] Either money tomorrow, you've got to do paid-and-fool.

[11:59] It's going to be a text blast to make the money.

[12:02] If you can wait two weeks to make the money, you're going to do an internal play.

[12:05] If you can wait a month to make the money, then you should probably do hybrid.

[12:10] Give everyone the free play.

[12:11] Now you just add it 120-000-000 months to your facility.

[12:15] Top line.

[12:16] Bottom line.

[12:17] You're actually sorry.

[12:19] You would add more than that top line.

[12:20] You had 144,000 top line, 120, bottom line.

[12:23] One play.

[12:24] Is it worth it?

[12:25] Are you a play?

[12:26] Well, most people do not that.

[12:29] That's why they struggle.

[12:30] So don't be one of them.

[12:31] Cash flow is oxygen.

[12:33] Make sure that you prioritize the opportunities that are bigger.

[12:37] And once you do that, once you execute those things, then yes, you'll have cash flow

[12:40] to breathe and then you can invest in things that will actually solve your problem.

[12:44] And you can pay someone to start helping retain your customers so that you don't have

[12:47] the term problem.

[12:48] And you can wait 12 weeks to now you have cash flow from the recurring revenue stream

[12:52] that you took a month to build.

[12:54] So I hope that makes sense.

[12:56] Drop a like.

[12:57] Drop a comment.

[12:58] Tax someone if you feel like it.

[12:59] Three weeks to make cash in the next month.

[13:00] Lots of love keeping amazing.

[13:02] Have a wacky wonderful Wednesday.

[13:04] All right.

[13:05] Be cool.

[13:06] Back.

[00:00] $600 million a year in meat.

[00:03] That's how much Mike Salguero, the founder and CEO of

[00:06] butcher box, sends out every single year.

[00:09] And we had him fly out here to Vegas so that we could bring this to you,

[00:12] rigging it down into the tactics of what he did to start and

[00:16] continue to scale and things that any business owner can use today to scale their

[00:20] businesses.

[00:21] Before you had butcher box, you had another business.

[00:24] You want to do a quick like how we got here.

[00:26] Yeah.

[00:26] Some of your lessons you learned from that business, the failure.

[00:29] I love hearing about failures.

[00:31] Yeah.

[00:32] I mean, I could talk about a tremendous amount of failure in between college and my first

[00:35] business.

[00:36] If we want to go there, but my first business was a company called custommade.com.

[00:41] And my best friend, Seth and I bought the company, we had approached a guy to sell

[00:47] this custommade.com for $140,000.

[00:51] We didn't have any money at the time, so we gave him a check for $2,500 for a deposit.

[00:56] And then it had 90 days of due diligence, which is where you're supposed to figure out what

[01:00] happens at the company.

[01:01] And we took all that time to go raise money.

[01:04] And so we raised 500 grand.

[01:05] And the whole thing was, we were both working in real estate.

[01:10] And we called it a shack in Manhattan.

[01:12] So this is 2008 custommade.com.

[01:15] Got a ton of inbound traffic.

[01:17] Yeah.

[01:18] It's a great time typing in custommade.

[01:20] And it was filled with woodworkers who had their projects and stuff on there.

[01:25] And when you talk to these woodworkers, I get all my money from custommade.com.

[01:28] And I pay $35 a year for my subscription.

[01:32] And they had to email the owner to upload their content.

[01:36] So we were like, this is a shack in Manhattan.

[01:39] We're just going to buy it.

[01:40] We're going to like overhaul it, turn it into they can log in and manage their own content

[01:45] and jack up the rent.

[01:47] So people thought that was a good idea and gave us a great narrative for raising money.

[01:52] Yes.

[01:53] And then we were like, oh, yeah.

[01:54] Yeah.

[01:55] Yeah.

[01:56] Yeah.

[01:57] Of course, this was 2008 and in Boston in real estate.

[02:00] And everyone had just lost their money because Bernie made off just ran off of

[02:03] their money.

[02:04] Did something happen to 2008?

[02:05] Yeah.

[02:06] I'm so sorry.

[02:07] Okay.

[02:08] Crazy.

[02:09] Yeah.

[02:10] So Bernie made off ran off of their money.

[02:12] We heard a lot of nose, but we cobbled together around.

[02:15] And then we got going and things were working.

[02:18] We raised another 500,000 dollars.

[02:20] Okay.

[02:21] And then things were working.

[02:22] Yeah.

[02:23] So we had pivoted the website.

[02:24] You could now log in.

[02:25] We made a ton of mistakes.

[02:26] But we built a sales team.

[02:28] We had people calling to get makers to sign up for like an annual subscription or a monthly

[02:32] subscription.

[02:33] We hit about $60,000 in revenue a month.

[02:37] And we were doing prior?

[02:39] $35,000 a year.

[02:40] Oh, geez.

[02:41] Yeah.

[02:42] So you did amazing.

[02:43] Yeah.

[02:44] Yeah.

[02:45] But we were still losing a little bit of money and whatnot.

[02:47] Also a great frame for me was listening to this.

[02:49] The idea that like, I had to mentor say this.

[02:52] He's like, break before you go to take your business to market.

[02:55] He's like switch sides of the table.

[02:57] And then try and say like, you just bought your business today.

[03:00] What are all the things you fix about it?

[03:01] It's like, well, maybe just do those first.

[03:03] And so I think it's just a great like perspective on any business.

[03:06] It's like if I bought everything today, how would I?

[03:09] It's like a different lens at least.

[03:10] Anyways, for me it's been awful.

[03:11] But it's like, please continue.

[03:13] Yeah.

[03:14] So at the time, I think it's been a long time.

[03:16] I think it's been a long time.

[03:17] Yeah.

[03:18] So at the time, it was like 2010, 2011, everybody in tech was raising money.

[03:24] And so we were looking at tech crunch and looking at all this stuff.

[03:27] And at that time, there weren't like all these accelerator programs and all these things that now are exist to help people.

[03:33] And so by co-founder and I looked at each other, we were like, we have a good business.

[03:36] Why don't we raise money?

[03:37] And so we ran around town again raising money.

[03:40] This time, trying to raise from BC.

[03:42] And we got first round capital, which is a very well known BC in New York.

[03:48] And then we got Google Ventures to invest in our company.

[03:52] It was a, we raised 1.9 million at like a 7 million.

[03:57] Okay, pretty money.

[03:58] Sure.

[04:00] That's where things started like falling over.

[04:03] So actually, most people told us, no, we went to raise money.

[04:08] And people are like, woodworker listing site like hell no.

[04:13] And I was in a meeting.

[04:17] And at this VC benchmark.

[04:20] And I said, I was like, we built this function where somebody could post a project and makers could see them coming in and then they could bid on them.

[04:30] And I was like, pull up the job board.

[04:32] And this thing was like live action.

[04:34] We wanted to get exciting.

[04:35] And they're like these jobs rolling in.

[04:37] And we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like,

[05:07] we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we

[05:37] we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we

[06:07] are like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're

[06:37] like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like

[07:07] we're like, yeah, of course, go, come on in.

[07:10] And I mean, literally the guy did this like, week on deep dive,

[07:14] came out and was like, that's the worst website I've ever seen.

[07:17] He's like, I can't believe we invested in this.

[07:21] So our investors, how does it even make money?

[07:24] How is this, like, in these guys, like, yeah, and so we'll end it up happening over the court.

[07:30] So immediately we're like, we have the wrong tech team.

[07:33] And our investors were like, you have the wrong tech team.

[07:35] You have to get rid of them.

[07:36] So we got rid of our tech team.

[07:38] And then it was like, if the wrong product people and you have to get rid of the

[07:41] product people, you're the wrong marketing people.

[07:43] And when ended up happening over the course of about a year is I took all of the

[07:47] people who helped me build this company to help help me like hack through the jungle

[07:51] to get to like the road.

[07:54] And we fired all that.

[07:56] And I was one does.

[07:57] And I was left with a company of new hires, new hires.

[08:02] People that didn't fit the culture.

[08:04] Right.

[08:05] And I hadn't written down the cultural values.

[08:08] And I just have this vivid memory of sitting in my car in the parking lot being like,

[08:13] I can't go in.

[08:15] Like I can't, I don't even want to go to work.

[08:19] And I had a good salary, but by that point with all the delusion, I owned like 8% of the

[08:23] thing.

[08:24] Jack, you go get a CEO job doing something.

[08:26] It was just like this, like, what have I done?

[08:28] Yeah.

[08:29] And I let go of all my friends.

[08:31] It was bad.

[08:32] Yeah.

[08:33] How many years was this?

[08:34] Eight years of work.

[08:35] Yeah.

[08:36] Yeah.

[08:37] 2015.

[08:38] Our sorry.

[08:39] 2008 through 2015.

[08:41] Yeah.

[08:42] So we just we covered eight years in a pretty short short short little window.

[08:45] Yeah.

[08:46] Just for anyone who's listening.

[08:47] I bring this up just because like, I feel like when you, when you hear the stories

[08:51] where you watch the, the literally the 60 second short about someone's career, you know,

[08:56] you know, you, you see the highlights in the low lights, but a lot of it is just kind

[08:59] like the mundane middle of just dealing with the stress of every day.

[09:02] There's always fires and there's a per, a permuting level of baseline stress that doesn't

[09:08] really go.

[09:09] Yeah.

[09:10] Yeah.

[09:11] And so I mean, one big lesson was like, don't listen to investors when I, when I started

[09:15] at the Lichabox, well, which will get into, I didn't want to take investment.

[09:19] There was also like, I lost myself.

[09:21] Yeah.

[09:22] I lost my team and I lost myself.

[09:23] And when I looked at the shambles that happened, it was like, I don't want to,

[09:29] did you shut it down?

[09:30] Yeah.

[09:32] We actually foreclosed on it because we had some venture debt.

[09:35] There was a little bit of debt.

[09:37] Our bank account got below.

[09:38] Yeah.

[09:39] What?

[09:40] And they were like, we're, we're taking it.

[09:42] So we actually did it.

[09:44] What's called a friendly foreclosure.

[09:46] They took it over my co-founder stayed and was still running it.

[09:49] Oh, it's still going.

[09:50] Yeah.

[09:51] Is it doing okay?

[09:52] It's now a jewelry company and it's just, they just do everything.

[09:56] There's no maker.

[09:57] There's no like, no market point.

[09:58] The big problem that we had was you can't, like, these custom, if you're

[10:01] on a custom coffee table or a custom piece of jewelry, there's like 60 back and

[10:06] forth.

[10:07] Yeah, there's about a battery deep down like, yeah.

[10:09] And we had to stand in between that in order to get our feet, like 10%

[10:13] which is a nightmare.

[10:14] It was a bad business.

[10:15] But we, because we sold everyone on market place.

[10:17] Yeah.

[10:18] When we were like, this isn't going to work.

[10:19] People are like, well, that's what I invested on.

[10:21] So yeah, you need to keep going.

[10:23] So doing the other version of, so because I, so I think about this in terms of, like,

[10:26] the path not taken.

[10:28] So if you had, if you had not raised really any of the money besides the amount that you

[10:34] needed to, you had them acquire the business.

[10:36] So at that point, what did you raise the 500,000?

[10:39] When you didn't go through the due diligence, that period, we had to have 500.

[10:43] What was the, what was the, or how much equity did you have away for that?

[10:46] It was a convertible.

[10:47] So convert it into the, the next round, like a save round.

[10:50] Yeah.

[10:51] Oh, great.

[10:52] Okay.

[10:53] So that ended up being like five or six percent, I mean, a little more than that.

[10:54] So like, seven percent of the business.

[10:55] Yeah.

[10:56] Which had been pretty, a pretty good, a pretty good move.

[10:59] First, yeah.

[11:00] Yeah.

[11:00] And if that business at the time, so it was doing 60,000 dollars a month, right?

[11:04] So 720 year, it's in terms of run rate.

[11:06] Yeah.

[11:07] If you had stuck with the original model and just been like, I'm not, I don't have to

[11:11] pursue this.

[11:15] Not as an insult, like, cockamy,

[11:16] any business model, but basically Billy or bust business models, what I mean,

[11:21] to say, it probably could have just been a very profitable.

[11:25] I mean, going from 35,000 year to 60,000 dollars a month and like 12 months is, is great

[11:30] growth.

[11:31] Yeah, it was a profitable at that point.

[11:33] It was almost profitable.

[11:34] Okay.

[11:35] And like you could have a little bit of a profitable.

[11:36] Well, and that's one of the reasons why I want to be here today, and I'm talking

[11:40] to people who like you, who talk to entrepreneurs about a different path, raising a bunch

[11:44] of money, diluting yourself, having people who tell you what to do, and losing your culture

[11:48] in the time, and losing yourself.

[11:50] Every business I've had has been good stroke.

[11:51] Yeah.

[11:53] Yeah.

[11:53] So when I started butcher box, I took the, we, we close the business.

[11:58] So we let go of 50 people, shut the doors, and literally close the gate and put the

[12:03] lock on.

[12:04] And the partners like, I'm still here though, and we're still going to keep, we're going to

[12:07] be spending a lot of money.

[12:08] Yeah, they like spun it out.

[12:09] Are you guys still friends?

[12:10] Yeah, we are.

[12:11] Yeah.

[12:12] There's a little rocky two years, but yeah, we're good friends.

[12:16] I took the weekend off.

[12:17] It was Memorial Day weekend, so it was a long weekend.

[12:21] And then I started a butcher box.

[12:22] Okay, on Tuesday.

[12:24] And I had known in the final year at custom aid, it was very clear to me that we were

[12:29] going to head a wall.

[12:30] And there was like no stopping it.

[12:32] My co-founder had become CEO in that last year because he just loved the distressed.

[12:38] Yeah, he wanted to be the revenue that.

[12:42] So we, we would only talk about GMV because it was platform.

[12:46] So our GMV, I think, got to like three or four million a month.

[12:51] Okay.

[12:51] But you know, then we took a 10% but actually because of, I forget all the reasons

[12:57] it was like 7%.

[12:59] Yeah.

[13:00] So 200,000 a month.

[13:04] We at our height were burning 500,000 a month.

[13:07] That is healthy burn.

[13:09] Yeah, healthy.

[13:10] Yeah.

[13:11] Just like never sanding like it.

[13:14] Yeah.

[13:15] Like there's a round just a road.

[13:17] So from a read Hoffman, I think you was talking to Elon or Pierce Yoher something.

[13:21] And either they were on the roof of the building that they were at for PayPal.

[13:26] And he said, if we were one at a time, lighting $100 bills and pulling them off the building,

[13:33] he said, it wouldn't be as fast as we're actually burning money in this company.

[13:37] And I just saw there was such a visual of like, I could burn $100 bills slower.

[13:42] Yeah.

[13:43] Then we're actually burning the money in this business.

[13:44] But I thought it was hilarious.

[13:45] Yeah.

[13:46] You start adding a bunch of people and then you have managers to manage those people

[13:50] and then you do a bunch of marketing on all of a sudden you're just like losing money.

[13:54] And when you raise, especially when you raise something like an $18 million round, they want

[14:00] you to spend the money as fast as possible.

[14:01] And the thing that they don't talk about with venture is venture capital is get paid

[14:08] when they put money out on the street.

[14:10] They take a management fee.

[14:11] And so they have everyone around the table has the incentive to like put as much money

[14:17] as evenly possible into these deals.

[14:19] And so you really when you go, like people are like, how do I figure out what my valuation

[14:23] is?

[14:24] It's like, no, no, just tell them how much money you can spend over the next $25,000,000

[14:28] and just argue for a bigger number.

[14:31] It's like we can blow through $10 million.

[14:32] They're like, great.

[14:33] Here's the fact.

[14:34] So yeah, it was just counter to how like business works.

[14:39] Yeah, it's not so interesting.

[14:40] So it's interesting because you're actually, it's the collision of two different business

[14:43] models and the one who has the voting rights is the one who wins.

[14:47] But like their business model is deployment of capital and management fees.

[14:50] By and large, obviously there's carries and things like that.

[14:52] But there's that component.

[14:54] And then there's the business model of the actual business.

[14:56] But the person who actually calls the shots is the largest business, the person who makes

[15:01] the most money from the business prevails in terms of who is leverage in the conversation.

[15:06] Yeah, and we had all the rights.

[15:08] So we negotiated really really well.

[15:10] We had all the rights in our documents.

[15:12] My co-founder stuff was just like a phenom at that.

[15:15] So they couldn't overthrow us.

[15:17] They didn't have any management decisions, et cetera.

[15:20] But it doesn't matter.

[15:21] At the end of the day when they're like, you're going to be blackballed if you don't

[15:24] like the pressure.

[15:25] Yeah.

[15:26] Yeah.

[15:27] So at the end, it was like, we're going to sell the company.

[15:29] We're going to bring in a different CEO.

[15:31] We're going to do all these things, none of which worked.

[15:34] I knew the writing was on the wall.

[15:36] So I've been playing around with like, what am I going to do next?

[15:39] And I had a few ideas.

[15:41] I had a billboard company.

[15:43] I was really interested in starting.

[15:44] I had a bond company.

[15:46] I was really interested in starting.

[15:47] And I had this shipping meet in the mail.

[15:50] Just a quick backstory.

[15:53] My wife has an autoimmune disorder.

[15:56] We were following these elimination diets to clean up our diet.

[16:00] We were trying to find grass.

[16:01] I'd be couldn't find it.

[16:02] Oh, OK.

[16:03] And I just got obsessed with like, where do you find grass?

[16:06] I'd be.

[16:07] Why is this the hard thing to phone?

[16:08] Why is this hard to find?

[16:09] Did I end up like meeting a farmer and a parking lot and buying trash bags full of

[16:13] meat and being like, this is weird.

[16:16] And I started selling stakes to my buddies because it was like too much meat.

[16:20] Yeah.

[16:21] And one of my buddies was like, this would be so much easier for us to live to my house.

[16:24] Yeah.

[16:25] I don't know how to like, meet you at your house to pick up the meat.

[16:27] It was like, just ship it to my house.

[16:28] And so I was like, OK, how do you ship meat in the mail?

[16:31] Yeah.

[16:32] I couldn't figure it out.

[16:33] This is all while it was like a still a custom made.

[16:36] And then I met.

[16:37] I was like, the tail end.

[16:38] You're kind of getting a fair.

[16:40] Yeah.

[16:41] Yeah.

[16:42] Things were closing down.

[16:44] And then I reached out to the former head of operations of Omaha stakes.

[16:47] Oh, gosh.

[16:48] At the time was like the big meat oil company.

[16:51] And he's like, yeah, like I my non-competes over.

[16:54] I can help you.

[16:55] That's amazing.

[16:56] And so he made all these introductions.

[16:58] Yeah.

[16:59] Pro tip right here just for everyone listening.

[17:01] Find the person who has built business.

[17:04] Yes.

[17:05] Already.

[17:06] Very clear.

[17:07] It's, you know, from an entrepreneur's perspective, I think the beginning is always about

[17:11] how like all, you know, you're very tactic obsessed.

[17:13] And obviously I talk a lot a lot about tactics, stuff on this channel.

[17:16] But I say beyond a certain point, it just becomes a lot about who?

[17:21] Because the leverage is in not having to live the 15 or 20 years or how long this guy

[17:25] had been in the state business.

[17:27] You're like, you can either like relive his life and then be 20 years older.

[17:30] It's like, or you can just find that guy.

[17:33] And then he doesn't have to live your life either.

[17:35] And then you combine and everybody wins.

[17:37] And so I think in the earlier stages of my career, I thought way more what and how

[17:42] than who.

[17:43] Yeah.

[17:44] Also the way that I structured it.

[17:45] So I had a whiteboard.

[17:46] I had the three ideas.

[17:47] Yeah.

[17:48] And I had like the kill shot, like the thing that if I didn't figure out this week

[17:51] or this month, like you don't have a business.

[17:54] Even though the bomb thing was like a legal thing.

[17:57] For the, for, for butcher box, it was like, how do you ship this?

[18:00] Yeah.

[18:01] And so I actually like every time I went to the bathroom, I'd be like, are, how do you

[18:04] ship me?

[18:05] Like reaching out to people, trying to get somebody to help him?

[18:09] He finally said yes.

[18:11] And so fast forward to close the doors and butcher box.

[18:14] Or sorry, at custom made.

[18:16] And it was pretty clear that like, why don't I just like spend the summer?

[18:20] You have messing around with this idea.

[18:24] So my intention was to build a hobby business.

[18:26] So I was very enamored by like Tim Ferrers for our work week, like, you know, build

[18:31] something that runs in the background.

[18:33] And then you go live your life.

[18:34] You know, passive income.

[18:37] And that was like, I thought if we had a thousand subscribers and we made a $20

[18:44] profit on each subscriber, it's $20,000.

[18:47] You, so if you, if you, customer service, if you outsource that, and if you build tech

[18:52] easy, like you could have like $10,000 month.

[18:58] And so I built, it was like WordPress on top of Stripe, which nowadays, their Shopify, which

[19:03] is incredible.

[19:04] And we're a present top of Stripe, which we basically ran with until last year when we

[19:10] would to Shopify.

[19:11] And then we outsourced everything.

[19:12] Right.

[19:13] It was like, okay, this is going to be hobby business.

[19:16] Yeah.

[19:17] And the first thing I did, so I had an intern start with me on like, day.

[19:21] I wouldn't have taught us something because I think it's such an important thing.

[19:24] So like, I have, I have had such a similar experience.

[19:27] So I think the, what you just walked through from a narrative perspective, which is that,

[19:32] every time I've tried to like build a business, it doesn't work for me.

[19:37] It hasn't.

[19:38] And I've failed a bunch of times on businesses and I was like, I'm building a business.

[19:41] When I was like, how do I make some money that doesn't take a ton of my time?

[19:46] I end up building a really good business.

[19:48] Yeah.

[19:49] And so it's just like an inch again, it's these like these frames of questions.

[19:51] And I think this, at any level, you could ask it from a product line perspective or new

[19:55] division perspective.

[19:56] But it's, it's like, I have, I've had these like romantic ideas of like this big thing

[19:59] that I want to have happen rather than like, you know, I just, I just want to make some

[20:05] money in a really easy way.

[20:06] And then when, what's interesting, though, is that you're basically, I call it solving

[20:10] for a zero off, which is like, how do I solve for like no time and profit?

[20:14] But when you solve that problem, when you have no time and profit, it also scales a lot

[20:20] easier because you already started with the premise of how do I have it, put no time,

[20:24] not be as risky and be profitable.

[20:26] That's all right.

[20:27] So I pick back up.

[20:28] If you build something to be a hobby, it came to remain a hobby.

[20:31] Yeah.

[20:32] And I can all talk about our backbone now, but it's very similar.

[20:36] Everything is third party.

[20:38] We have really tight specs on everything.

[20:40] But we took the perspective that, I started with, I want a hobby.

[20:46] And nowadays I took the perspective, but like, we're not going to learn how to ship boxes

[20:51] better than a company that's been in the business 75 years.

[20:55] Like, why bother trying to do that?

[20:56] Yeah.

[20:58] We started with an intern.

[21:00] And we decided that we're going to do a Kickstarter campaign or a Kickstarter or

[21:04] Indigo go at the time.

[21:05] Yeah.

[21:06] This is 2015.

[21:07] Also different way of raising money, by the way.

[21:09] Yeah, when it's listening.

[21:10] Pre-sales.

[21:10] Yeah.

[21:11] So it's not raising money.

[21:12] You're just selling your product and you're seeing if there's a market and you're

[21:16] getting money up front.

[21:17] Every one of my, so my first gym, I saved all my money to start.

[21:22] As soon as I, and I wanted to start the gym as fast as you knew, possible.

[21:24] Because I thought if I started the gym really quickly, then I could start making money.

[21:29] Every gym after that gym, I had multi-month presales.

[21:32] So that would pay for the, that would finance the entirety of the gym off the people pre-bying

[21:35] memberships and pre-bying weight loss challenges and things.

[21:38] And so like this is definitely like a 101 to 201 entrepreneur.

[21:41] Like, the first one, you're taking the outside capital.

[21:44] You're like, you know, I bet you, I could just get my customers to just pay on different

[21:47] payment terms and just get, and then it's also also a great product-marpurfit test.

[21:52] If no one wants to buy your presale, then thank God you didn't like raise money for it or

[21:56] something like that.

[21:57] Like we actually know people want to buy it and they're willing to pay for it.

[21:58] And wait.

[21:59] Yep.

[22:00] Exactly.

[22:01] That's the great thing about Kickstarter is people are used to waiting a really long time

[22:04] to get their products.

[22:06] And, you know, we basically started, we hadn't launched yet, but we went out and

[22:11] showed our page to people.

[22:13] And the first thing that we learned was people are like, I don't need that much beef.

[22:17] We only have grass-fed beef.

[22:18] Right.

[22:19] Sell people, eight to ten pounds of grass-fed beef for $129.

[22:23] So you're like, I don't need that much beef I would never buy this.

[22:25] Yeah.

[22:26] And we're like, well, what have we put in chicken a pork as well?

[22:28] Yeah.

[22:29] They're like, oh, totally.

[22:30] Can you make it at the same standard?

[22:32] Like, can you find chicken?

[22:33] Yeah.

[22:34] It's like raise better and pork this raise better and really get up.

[22:36] So we started with a box beef chicken or pork and launched our Kickstarter.

[22:43] And I think one of the, you know, one of the things that we've done well as a company

[22:46] is found arbitrage opportunities.

[22:49] And so the first arbitrage opportunity was with Kickstarter.

[22:53] Okay.

[22:53] So back in 2015 Kickstarter had this verified batch.

[22:57] Mm-hmm.

[22:58] Like if it would be like Kickstarter verified.

[23:00] Mm-hmm.

[23:01] And so what we did is we watched these campaigns to see like which campaigns got

[23:06] the verified batch and then tried to reverse engineer like how did they get the verified

[23:10] batch?

[23:11] And it was one part early momentum.

[23:13] Yeah.

[23:14] Sales coming in.

[23:16] I tried to reach out to all the founders and be like, oh, we're

[23:19] doing this thing.

[23:20] Yeah.

[23:21] It did whatever it took.

[23:22] And so we went out to raise 25,000 in sales.

[23:26] Yeah.

[23:27] And we ended up raising, we ended up selling 40,000 in boxes in the first day.

[23:33] Oh, Jews.

[23:34] And now we got the Kickstarter verified batch.

[23:36] And then we ended up doing 210,000 in the pre-sales, which was a 1,100 boxes of meat

[23:43] to going, you know, the first, the beauty of Kickstarter is if you get that verified

[23:48] batch, it's no longer, you're no longer just asking your friends and your audience to shop.

[23:54] It like goes to Apple push it up.

[23:56] And so it was a lot of random people we didn't know.

[24:00] So my whole idea because I wanted a hobby business and I didn't want to raise money.

[24:06] What benefit?

[24:07] Just I want to double click on the offer real quick.

[24:09] Offers part of what we talked about.

[24:10] So what ancillary benefits or bonuses did you give to people beyond just the box of

[24:17] things?

[24:18] Was there anything else that they got for being, you know, the way you put that?

[24:20] Yeah, good one.

[24:21] So we offered the way that you do with Kickstarter is you try to activate the people who

[24:28] have bought to like go be your ambassadors.

[24:30] So we said if we hit a $100,000 in sales, we'll give everyone free bacon in their first

[24:36] box.

[24:37] Okay.

[24:38] And that, like people went crazy.

[24:39] They're like, I want the bacon, you know, and started like promoting it, putting it on

[24:42] their Facebook pages all of that.

[24:44] Okay.

[24:45] That was it, though.

[24:47] Our product.

[24:47] You had a referral bonus.

[24:48] Yeah.

[24:49] Really interesting.

[24:50] Our product was really hard.

[24:52] It's still really hard to find.

[24:54] Yeah.

[24:55] So we're dealing with people who like want to eat healthier, feel guilty about the meat that

[24:58] they're eating and we give them an answer to that.

[25:01] Yeah.

[25:02] And so there was, it was really clear that we had struck a nerve really quickly.

[25:06] Yeah.

[25:07] And so then during the Kickstarter campaign, so we've signed up like 1100 people.

[25:12] And then the Kickstarter campaign, the most interesting thing that happened was there was

[25:16] a, we were like writing on Twitter to anyone who did Kickstarter.

[25:20] Like anyone who talked about grasswood beef to get them to talk about us.

[25:24] And this one nutritionist.

[25:25] So you're like, you're reaching out to them.

[25:27] Yeah.

[25:28] Just like we eat what a lot of this thing.

[25:29] This is warm outreach.

[25:30] Our story, this is cold outreach to affiliates fundamentally, that you do their papers

[25:36] through sponsorships with money or free stuff or both.

[25:40] And then I don't know if you give them affiliate links or it's just like, hey, just

[25:42] talk about everything.

[25:43] At this point, it was just talk about things.

[25:44] Yeah.

[25:45] So like, I'll send you a free box of meat if you just talk about it.

[25:47] Yeah.

[25:48] Yeah.

[25:49] A great way to get started early from a capital perspective.

[25:52] So it's like both of the examples that might talk about first is like, okay, if there's

[25:55] platforms that'll give you free reach, figure out what you have, you know, reverse engineer,

[25:59] what free reach looks like.

[26:00] And they're just getting the customers for free.

[26:02] And I think some people, especially this is weird.

[26:03] But like a lot of small businesses will like obsess about like, they charge 10%.

[26:07] It's like they charge a commission on customers.

[26:09] They get you for free.

[26:10] Right.

[26:11] What do we talk about?

[26:12] Yeah.

[26:13] And then with the affiliates and influencers that you reach out to another way to basically,

[26:20] like if you, if you factor in the cost, it's like literally just the hard cost of the box

[26:23] of meat is your advertising cost and everything above that is basically free-be.

[26:27] Yeah.

[26:28] Right.

[26:29] And so both of these are super low capital ways early on to get those initial sales going.

[26:34] Sorry.

[26:35] Yeah.

[26:36] So this nutritionist in California, this guy Chris Kriss Krasser tweeted, like, this

[26:41] is an interesting, you know, I've told you to eat grass food beef.

[26:44] This is an interesting place to get it.

[26:46] That's all he did.

[26:48] And we saw a flurry of activity from, and by a flurry, I mean there was like seven people

[26:52] who said that.

[26:53] But at the time that was like, like, what just happened?

[26:56] And then we were like, you know, to what you were just talking about, we're like, we need

[26:59] to do more of that.

[27:00] Yeah.

[27:01] We need to go find every influencer who's ever talked about grass food beef and get them

[27:05] to promote.

[27:06] Yeah.

[27:07] Promotos.

[27:08] So if you're paying care for attention, Mike is at the third step in the scaling roadmap.

[27:11] Which is advertised.

[27:13] He's single person.

[27:14] He's the doer.

[27:15] And he's got a bunch of freelancers.

[27:16] Right.

[27:17] The biggest issue he's dealing with is inconsistently flown.

[27:19] He doesn't have enough money for tech.

[27:21] And so that's the problems of this stage.

[27:24] And so if you want to solve them, which obviously did, you just go over the graduate

[27:28] column and do those actions.

[27:30] But the cool thing is that no matter where your business is at, you will be at one of

[27:33] these stages of scaling.

[27:35] And if you would like my team to personalize a roadmap specifically for you so that we can

[27:40] identify what's you're in for some information, which stage you're at and send you the

[27:43] exact solutions or where you are to get to where you want to go.

[27:46] So all you got to just go to Aquiz.com for slash roadmap, plug in information and then

[27:50] we'll send it right out to you.

[27:52] It's one of the most valuable things I can give you.

[27:54] So enjoy.

[27:55] So we finish the Kickstarter.

[27:56] And then we immediately.

[27:57] And that was the CTA.

[27:58] So when you're pushing out to them saying, hey, promote our Kickstarter basically and they

[28:03] could send their traffic to your Kickstarter to, you know, the seven buyers that came in from

[28:07] that.

[28:08] Yeah.

[28:09] And the guy who did that.

[28:10] Yeah.

[28:11] So Kickstarter will tell you where to this come from.

[28:13] Okay.

[28:14] So it came from Twitter.

[28:15] But that was, but you were still in pre-sale mode for this whole thing.

[28:18] Yeah.

[28:19] Yeah.

[28:20] Great.

[28:21] Okay.

[28:22] So I'm going back to an earlier point because we wanted to be capital efficient.

[28:26] The whole idea was we're going to send you the Blitchers selections.

[28:29] Okay.

[28:30] So I didn't want to hold them in to where I was.

[28:33] Because I don't know how many ribbons we're going to sell.

[28:35] And this is really expensive in a inventory.

[28:36] So the idea was, well, sell a bunch of stuff.

[28:39] And then we'll just decide what to put in the box.

[28:41] Yeah.

[28:42] So we sold them on just stuff.

[28:43] And then it was like, okay, we have 1100 boxes.

[28:46] We talked to the place that we were working with.

[28:48] They created, you know, these different, do they have all types of meat the one place they

[28:51] wanted to sell?

[28:52] They did.

[28:53] So that was fortunate.

[28:54] Yeah.

[28:55] We started working with this company in Wisconsin that they had a cutting facility and a

[28:58] pick-pack ship facility.

[28:59] It was like, they did everything.

[29:01] So they just had it and they had no marketing basically.

[29:03] Yeah.

[29:04] Great.

[29:05] Yeah.

[29:06] So we shipped out all these boxes and then called every, because we shipped it out

[29:11] really quickly.

[29:12] It was like a week.

[29:13] But there were throwing them for Kickstarter.

[29:14] Yeah.

[29:15] Wow.

[29:16] I got my box already and then we called them, hey, how are things going to need any recipes?

[29:20] Would you like to become a subscriber and signed up like 40% of the people?

[29:24] Amazing.

[29:25] So right away we had like, you know, you didn't just send an email to 1100 people

[29:28] with none of them easier.

[29:31] Nope.

[29:32] We had a guy, Nicky Graham, who picked up the phone and just like pounded the phone.

[29:35] He was like $10 an hour plus like a $5.00 spip.

[29:39] I just want to just want to hit on this just because like these, it was nice

[29:42] is that you're hitting all these really clear milestones that I feel like are just

[29:44] forgotten, which is like just the elbow grease of what I'll consider like unskillable

[29:49] work or unskillable effort is like a lot of times early on everyone's looking for like,

[29:53] I don't know if that scales.

[29:54] Yeah.

[29:55] And so I mean, you know, we hand wrote, you know, 1,100 cards and we manually

[30:00] reached out to every single person and we had conversation with them and we asked them

[30:03] if they knew anybody else would be interested just like the basics.

[30:06] Everyone's like, oh, I'm sure that would work.

[30:08] It's like right, but it would just be work.

[30:10] Yeah.

[30:10] Yeah.

[30:10] And you did it and obviously it worked.

[30:12] Yeah.

[30:12] Well, and one thing that I think is important is I knew that I couldn't do that.

[30:17] Yeah.

[30:18] Like if you put me in a room with a phone, it's a call 1100 people, no way.

[30:22] Like the business wouldn't have gone anywhere.

[30:24] And so it's good to know what you're good at and what you're not at that, what you're

[30:27] willing to do, what you're not willing to do.

[30:29] And invest in the areas that you're not willing to do.

[30:32] Because if you believe in the business, there's a guy who for $10 an hour is just like,

[30:36] okay, bro, just get yeah, he's thrilled.

[30:39] And he was good at it and like then I didn't have to do it.

[30:42] But I think too often entrepreneurs take the approach of like they need to do everything.

[30:47] Yeah.

[30:48] And like, I mean, the business would not exist if we hadn't made those phone calls.

[30:52] But if it was up to me, I would never make those phone calls.

[30:54] Was there an offer that you gave them for the subscription?

[30:57] The 40% besides like, hey, one sign up.

[31:01] I don't remember.

[31:02] Like get your next box, $10 off your next box or you get a big infreferent or next box.

[31:07] If you, they're must have been.

[31:09] But I don't actually remember.

[31:11] But what did happen was we launched butrobox.com.

[31:17] Yeah.

[31:17] So in the background, we signed up these people.

[31:20] Yeah.

[31:20] And we realized affiliates was the thing.

[31:22] So we started working on that.

[31:24] We launched butrobox.com to the world.

[31:27] And there were many people who were trying to get in on the Kickstarter and they

[31:30] let you put up a link.

[31:31] So they were coming to our website and they were buying.

[31:33] Mm-hmm.

[31:34] So right away, we signed up like five subscribers, 10 subscribers, like on the first day.

[31:37] Yeah.

[31:38] And what happened was we had a little tech issue.

[31:42] So when those new subscribers signed up, they got free bacon in their first box.

[31:48] So because we built the tech to be like bacon's going in every first box.

[31:52] Yeah.

[31:53] And two weeks in, I got a call from the tech guys.

[31:56] Like we have a really bad problem on our hands.

[31:57] I was like, what's going on?

[31:58] And they're like, we've been sending bacon to everybody.

[32:01] And I was like, oh my god, this is dad.

[32:03] And then my marketing guy was like, why don't we just tell people sign up and get free

[32:08] bacon?

[32:09] And it was like, oh, well, we can't shut it off anyways.

[32:11] Yeah.

[32:12] Let's do the things broaches.

[32:13] Yeah, broaches.

[32:14] We can't fix it.

[32:15] So we're just going to, that became the, that became the.

[32:18] Because I know that one.

[32:19] And like I knew that before even like heard of, or met you or heard the story of Harley and

[32:22] whatnot.

[32:24] So again, like grand same offers like and, and you know, the free box of bacon,

[32:29] like I've heard of that.

[32:30] Yeah.

[32:30] And so it started with the get bacon in your box.

[32:33] Yeah.

[32:33] And then two years in, we created this bacon for life.

[32:37] Uh-huh.

[32:38] Offer.

[32:38] Yes.

[32:39] And that really took off.

[32:40] That that was like that was a river.

[32:42] Uh-huh.

[32:42] Yeah.

[32:43] So you just one up to now already really good offer and said not only do you get it in the

[32:47] first box, you'll get it in every box.

[32:49] As long as you stay subscribed, as long as you stay subscribed.

[32:52] Right.

[32:53] Ultimately, the bacon costs $4 and the box, you know, you're making your profit off of

[32:57] roads like your, it's not that big of a deal.

[33:00] Um, and you get a new car cost much less than fort.

[33:03] Like the arbitrage on CAC or, you know, cost CPA depending on what industry you're

[33:07] in.

[33:08] Yeah.

[33:09] A cost your car cost more significantly higher by basically said differently.

[33:12] If you add bacon for life in your cost your car cost more dropped by more than the

[33:15] cost of the bacon.

[33:16] Uh, more importantly, they say longer.

[33:18] Really?

[33:19] Yeah.

[33:20] Oh, because now you have your free bacon.

[33:21] You don't want to get rid of your free bacon.

[33:22] And so they can't come back.

[33:23] Well, they, yeah.

[33:25] Now you can't, if you, if you, if you quit, uh, you lose your for life offers.

[33:30] So, but we have that we built a whole thing around these for life offers.

[33:34] Our, our, our top people have been with us from the beginning.

[33:37] I had like six or seven for life offers.

[33:38] So, I've got every month.

[33:39] They're like, why would I ever go anywhere else to buy my meat?

[33:42] Like, I have all these for life.

[33:43] It talks me more about this because it's really interesting.

[33:46] So how can they stack multiple for life offer?

[33:49] Like if I'm one of the 40%.

[33:50] Right.

[33:51] All my subscription.

[33:53] And I still have the tech malfunction.

[33:54] So I get free bacon every month.

[33:55] Okay.

[33:56] How am I getting these other ones?

[33:57] Well, so pretty soon after.

[33:59] I mean, this is several years in.

[34:01] This was like, you know, we're fast forwarding like five or six years.

[34:04] We started offering like, okay, free bacon for life is kind of getting,

[34:08] we'll reuse less try ground beef for life.

[34:10] Okay.

[34:11] And then people were signing off on ground beef for life.

[34:14] But then our customers, our current customers are like, what the hell?

[34:17] Like, I want ground beef for life.

[34:20] So then we just started selling ground beef for life to our customers.

[34:23] So we're like, okay, for $50, we'll sell you ground beef for life.

[34:29] So we just stacked all of these like offers on top of each other.

[34:35] Very few people.

[34:36] So your customers want down on some of these people.

[34:38] But like, they're just, there's the base that just like,

[34:41] we've gotten smarter at being like, it's for a year.

[34:44] Yeah, for like, yeah.

[34:45] And it's like, we've got a lot smarter and you lose them if you leave.

[34:49] And then like, but yeah, bacon, bacon really built this, but we built this business on bacon.

[34:54] So there's one, one channel, well, I'll just say, yeah, there's the influencer channel,

[35:03] which we'll, we can talk about.

[35:05] The other thing that, so it went Kickstarter, arbitrage, influencer arbitrage,

[35:10] and then Facebook video arbitrage.

[35:11] Okay.

[35:12] So I want to talk about, come guessing pay that.

[35:14] It became the next like, yes.

[35:15] Big sister influencer.

[35:16] Yeah.

[35:17] So you do, so okay, I'm going to retrace this step's report.

[35:20] So we had Kickstarter and then you officially open the site.

[35:24] Kickstarter had a backlink to you so that people would go to the Kickstarter because

[35:27] they'd go to SEO and get ranked as whatever and said then they'd find you.

[35:30] You're starting things sales every day.

[35:31] You have your mess up on bacon, but you're like, you know what, it's great.

[35:34] Let's get everybody bacon.

[35:36] And so the influencer strategy worked well for the Kickstarter so you kind of double

[35:39] down on that and say how do we get every influencer on the planet to talk about?

[35:41] Put your box?

[35:42] Yes.

[35:43] That was said, did you go like Instagram, Twitter?

[35:45] You just went across the different channels for influencers?

[35:47] No.

[35:48] So what we did was we figured out that there's a company thrive market.

[35:52] Okay.

[35:53] There are big like online thrive had done this, had done this thing where they had

[35:59] all these influencers and they gave a lot of them equity.

[36:02] Okay.

[36:03] He and the company to like, right actively promote thrice.

[36:06] They were like kind of the first ones on mock influencer.

[36:08] Okay.

[36:09] And so first we reach out to like everyone who mentioned grasshopper for.

[36:14] And then we realized that there's like a lot more people in health and wellness.

[36:17] And so we like thrive markets URL was like slash partners slash one.

[36:24] Okay.

[36:25] And then slash two slash three.

[36:26] Yeah.

[36:27] And so we just like, kick-cat-naded all of your else and just like took every

[36:31] single person and then found their website and their contact information.

[36:34] Oh, so you didn't go to thrive.

[36:36] You just reverse engineer thrive.

[36:37] We reverse engineered all their influencers.

[36:39] Got to leave list of 400 people.

[36:42] And then I think you'll like this part like because I like that.

[36:45] That's the offer.

[36:46] That's a good one.

[36:47] That's a good way to get the your warmly.

[36:48] Wow.

[36:49] So I got my first leads for gym launch was paid a VA to go to CrossFit's website.

[36:55] Sorry CrossFit.

[36:57] And literally look up every single affiliate that affiliate box that they had.

[37:02] And so because in gym owners usually put their personal stuff on numbers, their personal

[37:05] email is their actual like thing on the crossups.

[37:08] But they wanted to get listings.

[37:09] They're paying $3,000 a year to get the listing of saying, I'm in a official CrossFit.

[37:13] Right.

[37:14] But for me, I got like at the time, this is super early.

[37:16] You know, we had like 1,600 names on this list.

[37:19] But it was enough for Facebook to make a look like audience off of that.

[37:22] And that single look like audiences like what built gym launch.

[37:25] Like I didn't call it.

[37:26] I tried to hit all these other audiences and nothing worked.

[37:28] As soon as I hit the ads that audience, it was like ding ding ding.

[37:31] I was like, oh my god.

[37:32] This works amazing.

[37:33] So amazing.

[37:34] So you reverse engineered your list.

[37:35] Also elbow grease.

[37:38] For both, right, like, look at the side, look at the directors and mainly like

[37:41] pace the stuff over.

[37:42] Yeah.

[37:42] But again, you know, like you used a VA.

[37:45] Yeah.

[37:45] I used a VA as well.

[37:47] I used somebody in the Philippines who for like 20 cents a record.

[37:50] It's just like, oh, here you go.

[37:51] And you sleep and it's like there this day.

[37:53] Exactly.

[37:54] So the way that we reached out to these influencers, I thought was pretty

[37:58] genius.

[37:58] So we have this box right.

[37:59] We're shipping a box of meat.

[38:01] And at the time, there was like blue apron and hello friends.

[38:04] Yeah.

[38:04] All these companies.

[38:05] And they all even, no, bro.

[38:06] I was gone, right?

[38:08] 2015, they were hot.

[38:09] Yeah, I remember that.

[38:11] Blurburden is now was purchased by Mark Lori, who did jet.com.

[38:17] And they're trying to make it.

[38:18] Fix it up.

[38:19] And then hello fresh was a darling a little later than the, yes.

[38:23] And hello fresh is still around.

[38:24] There.

[38:24] Yeah.

[38:25] Yeah.

[38:26] So at the time, blue apron and hello fresh would include a recipe in the box.

[38:32] Okay.

[38:33] And our customers were like, this is really great, but I'd love a recipe.

[38:35] Yeah.

[38:36] What we did is we reached out to these influencers and we're like, hey, we started

[38:40] this company, our grass bed beef.

[38:42] Because we believed in like eating grass fit beef, though.

[38:46] And you've talked, you've talked about grass fit the beef.

[38:49] And but we didn't see a source of where to buy it.

[38:51] So we'd like to be that source.

[38:53] By the way, we're shipping out all these boxes and we don't have any recipes.

[38:58] And what we'd like to do is include your recipe on and the VA with like, you know, find

[39:03] a bowl, yeah.

[39:05] State whatever.

[39:07] And we love to include that in our box.

[39:10] And so these influencers who have made sure we've trade on influencer like, of course,

[39:14] yeah, use my recipe.

[39:15] No problem.

[39:16] Are you going to link to my website and all that stuff?

[39:17] Like yeah.

[39:18] They're like, by the way, what's butcher box?

[39:19] Yeah.

[39:20] And we're like, perfect.

[39:21] Let's talk.

[39:22] So that was like, that was like, we called it the Trojan Horse.

[39:26] Oh, it's amazing.

[39:27] It's like, not only do you get the recipes for food, but you also get, you know, you get

[39:31] in contact with all these, you get them to reply to you.

[39:33] Yeah.

[39:34] As soon as they replied to us, then it was like, let's talk about budget box.

[39:37] So I want to double click on that real quick.

[39:39] So if you're dealing with influencers, you have to think about the currency they care

[39:42] about most.

[39:43] And a lot of influencers care more about fame than they do about money.

[39:46] And so you were able to deal in the currency they preferred.

[39:49] Yep.

[39:50] So just as like for any any businesses, like, is there a way that we can do this, that's, that's

[39:54] really that like actually provides real value to them in the way that they want to get

[39:58] value, which I think is actually like a really brilliant, like, little nugget.

[40:02] Yeah.

[40:03] Okay.

[40:04] So this is 2016.

[40:05] So this is a long time ago.

[40:07] Yeah.

[40:08] At the time, the influencers, especially in the health and wellness space, like, didn't

[40:11] really know their value.

[40:12] Yeah.

[40:13] And so we were able to go to those influencers and say, look, like, we don't have

[40:17] any money.

[40:18] We can have pay you up front.

[40:19] I'm not paying you like $5,000 to send a email.

[40:22] What we can do is we'll pay you $10 or $15 per subscriber for every month that they remain

[40:28] a subscriber.

[40:29] So for life.

[40:30] Yeah.

[40:31] That's great.

[40:32] Yeah.

[40:33] Yeah.

[40:34] For missions for life.

[40:35] And people said, yes, they started, yeah, I'll do that.

[40:39] And so we figured out that, you know, tweets didn't work, Facebook posts didn't work.

[40:44] The thing that worked was a dedicated email blast where it would be like, here's

[40:49] butcher box, I mean, introduced this to you.

[40:52] And then ideally with a last chance, like, a last chance thing.

[40:55] And there was always an offer.

[40:56] $20 off, free bacon, whatever it was.

[41:00] Because we're only paying these influencers $10 or $15 a month, we could do all of this

[41:06] and be box one profitable, meaning we still made money because we started with a $20

[41:11] profit.

[41:12] We still made money on that first box.

[41:14] Or at least it was like we made a penny.

[41:17] Is the, so let's talk about, no, that we're here.

[41:19] Let's talk about the box economics.

[41:21] Yeah.

[41:22] So you're profitable on box one, which if we're juxtaposing this with custom made, right?

[41:29] If I always fund them, like, there are some business, it's, basically, I think there are

[41:33] significantly fewer businesses that actually rely on outside capital to work than people.

[41:38] Like if you want to build rockets, it's probably tough, but like you probably have to do that.

[41:43] But so I see a lot of businesses that like, even that, that hit me up and they're like,

[41:47] hey, you know, I'm raising capital for my insert normal business.

[41:51] And I'm like, have you considered just making money?

[41:52] Right.

[41:53] No, but like, right?

[41:54] It's like the perspective, right?

[41:56] And so box one you're profitable.

[41:58] So walk me through, like, with the standard box, like the most people, you know, with

[42:04] the cost is and all the cost is so you can really obsess about the box.

[42:08] Yeah.

[42:09] Yeah.

[42:10] So the Omaha State Sky, who introduced us to the place in Wisconsin, that we worked with,

[42:14] which massive.

[42:15] The one, no, yeah.

[42:16] Yeah.

[42:17] It's like open the whole business.

[42:18] That's why I was like, I need to start now.

[42:21] The one nugget he left with, he's like, listen, all we care about at Omaha

[42:25] State is dollars per box.

[42:27] Okay.

[42:28] What does that mean?

[42:29] Yeah.

[42:30] He means everyone at the company knows when a box comes off the line, how much money

[42:33] are we making off the box?

[42:36] And so that's how I built the business.

[42:37] I started the business, right?

[42:39] So we were charging $129.

[42:41] We were trying to make a $20 profit.

[42:43] We were only shipping from Wisconsin, which is a nightmare for California.

[42:47] But it was like, so we were losing money on California, but we're like, whatever, it absolutely

[42:51] got worth 20.

[42:53] And it kept our focus.

[42:54] So like, when I talk about $20 a box, I mean, like all in, because we put all the costs

[43:00] associated with it in.

[43:01] Yeah.

[43:02] So you're like fully loaded the box in terms of cost.

[43:04] So it's 20 dollar.

[43:05] I started feeding the profit.

[43:06] Yeah.

[43:07] Rather than gross profit per box.

[43:09] We're using gross profit.

[43:10] Gross profit.

[43:11] Okay, got it.

[43:12] Because we, again, is hobby business.

[43:13] Yeah.

[43:14] Like it wasn't our labor, it wasn't our, so this is pick pack.

[43:19] Yeah.

[43:20] So like putting all the stuff in from our distribution center into a box, the cost of the

[43:23] meat.

[43:24] The cost of the box, the cost of ship the box, the cost of the dry ice that goes in the

[43:29] box, the credit card processing fees, the tape that goes on the box, like all those

[43:34] things.

[43:35] Uh-huh.

[43:37] And because we just became doggedly focused on dollar's rubbox.

[43:41] What I love about this business, even to this day, is that we get to focus on like, you

[43:47] know, the minutia, like negotiating the price of tape.

[43:51] And the super creative, like, how are we going to get our next, you know, 500,000

[43:55] customers.

[43:56] And we get to do both.

[43:57] But we just started with a DNA of like, we're going to negotiate every single line

[44:03] item in this box.

[44:04] So what is the gross margin percentage per box?

[44:07] Currently or that?

[44:08] Yeah.

[44:09] Oh, both.

[44:10] Sure.

[44:11] Like 30%.

[44:12] Is it healthy gross margin?

[44:13] Okay.

[44:14] Yeah.

[44:15] We definitely want to be around or above 30%.

[44:16] Got it.

[44:17] One of the challenges that we have as a business is that, at least currently.

[44:21] So we're looking at price and model change.

[44:23] Currently you pay $169 and you choose six items in the box.

[44:28] And so it's kind of an inflationary disaster because the prices of meat fluctuate all the time.

[44:34] So if you stack it with rib eyes, you're way less than a 30% gross margin.

[44:40] If you stack it with really cheap stuff, you're way more than a 30% gross margin.

[44:45] That's an area where I feel like we're in, like, not an alignment with our customer.

[44:49] So I want to change that over time.

[44:51] Bill.

[44:52] But yeah, currently we're looking at a 30%.

[44:54] So yeah, what are Nimwiches?

[44:56] They're like six.

[44:57] Okay.

[44:58] Got it.

[44:59] Got it.

[45:00] We did like six and a half last year.

[45:02] Now, certainly not a content business.

[45:04] Very good.

[45:05] Yeah.

[45:06] Yeah.

[45:07] We used six and a half what's million.

[45:08] Yeah.

[45:09] I was like, that is okay.

[45:10] That was making sure.

[45:11] Yeah.

[45:12] And the big line item.

[45:13] So these businesses, like I've seen so many of them, 30% gross margin.

[45:19] Yeah.

[45:20] You got 10% to operate the place.

[45:23] Okay.

[45:23] The salaries, technology.

[45:25] So if they're good to opt of your gross margin.

[45:27] Yeah.

[45:28] And then you got 20% left over for marketing.

[45:31] Choose.

[45:32] And even they are in profit.

[45:34] Right.

[45:35] And so these businesses at scale, what they do, what you do is you market

[45:41] market market market for years, build your name and then just try to collapse your

[45:45] marketing and take it all in.

[45:46] And hopefully get enough word of mouth.

[45:49] Yeah.

[45:49] You know, from those customers that it can at least save off turn.

[45:53] Yeah.

[45:53] That's the like the CBG play.

[45:55] Yeah.

[45:55] And that's what a lot of these top companies are doing.

[45:58] The top business.

[45:59] It isn't tough business.

[46:00] Like it's, I mean, it's so, it's interesting because in so many ways, it's like

[46:04] software.

[46:05] Yeah.

[46:06] With the acceptance of like rather than doing what development you're doing with supply chain.

[46:09] That's your big like as I'm sure I know there's more fires.

[46:13] But like if I'd if I'd have simplified into like the big buckets, most of the time, I feel

[46:16] like that's where.

[46:17] Well, won't you tell me that that's, yeah.

[46:19] No, I agree.

[46:20] I mean, so, you know, that was a blu-a-prin-soul thing that raised a whole bunch of

[46:24] money and it was all like, we should be valued at a software multiple.

[46:28] Yeah.

[46:29] Nowadays, box subscription companies are not valued as software multiple because there's

[46:33] like actual physical product being sold.

[46:35] Yeah.

[46:36] And yeah, their stick is as high as like a, I don't know.

[46:40] Well, a consumer consumer tech company like shop on for example, if 60% annual retention

[46:46] for like new, new customers, right?

[46:49] I would imagine that if if that in the consumables business that that would be unbelievably

[46:55] good.

[46:56] Yeah.

[46:57] Yeah.

[46:58] What's your retention on like a year one customer?

[46:59] Gosh.

[47:00] It's not how we look at it.

[47:02] Okay.

[47:03] Interesting.

[47:04] Yeah.

[47:05] It's probably around 60%.

[47:07] Okay.

[47:08] Yeah.

[47:09] And that's like, I mean, those are like best in class numbers.

[47:10] I mean, the original reason that you're doing.

[47:12] Yeah.

[47:13] Is it 600?

[47:14] No.

[47:15] That you guys are doing?

[47:16] Okay.

[47:17] Yeah, the 600 has been out there, but it's really 550.

[47:20] So yeah, we're, you have 550 million profitable since day one.

[47:27] And you and 70%?

[47:28] Yeah.

[47:29] So I gave equity to most employees early on.

[47:33] Like a software company.

[47:34] Yeah.

[47:35] Like a venture back one.

[47:36] It's like, oh, this is what you do.

[47:38] Give out equity.

[47:39] Which, have you got that?

[47:44] In many ways, yeah.

[47:45] Yeah.

[47:46] People who helped me build this business, the people who helped me hack through the jungle

[47:49] Yeah.

[47:50] Are all millionaires.

[47:51] Oh, admit.

[47:52] And, you know, that's cool.

[47:53] That's like a really neat.

[47:55] But also, we have, if you don't want to raise money, yeah, which I don't.

[48:04] And you don't want to go public, right?

[48:05] Which I don't.

[48:06] And you don't want to sell, which I don't.

[48:08] It's like, how do you cash people out?

[48:09] Yeah.

[48:10] Right.

[48:11] That has been, that is a concern to mine all the time.

[48:14] Yeah.

[48:15] And we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like, we're like,

[48:18] we're like, we're like, we're going to allocate this much money to buy shares.

[48:31] And then we, people can say what they're willing to sell at.

[48:34] And then we, we bought them that way.

[48:36] And then we'll just go back to the market and then we'll just go back to the market.

[48:40] And then we'll just go back to the market and then we'll just go back to the market.

[48:44] And then we'll just go back to the market and then we'll just go back to the market.

[48:48] And then we'll just go back to the market and then we'll just go back to the market.

[48:52] And then we'll just go back to the market and then we'll just go back to the market and

[48:56] then we'll just go back to the market and then we'll just go back to the market and

[48:59] then we'll just go back to the market and then we'll just go back to the market and

[49:02] then we'll just go back to the market and then we'll just go back to the market and

[49:07] then we'll just go back to the market and then we'll just go back to the market and

[49:10] then we'll just go back to the market and then we'll just go back to the market and

[49:14] then we'll just start buying and buying.

[49:16] But then inflation took over and so our inflationary disaster, our margin has just got

[49:21] super compressed.

[49:22] So we went from like a 30% gross margin to a 25% gross margin after doing two price increases after two.

[49:29] So it's like there was no money.

[49:30] Yeah.

[49:31] And we never ran out of money but we're all looking around being like,

[49:35] dude, we just like did a share buyback for 20 or 30 million dollars over the past three years.

[49:41] Yeah.

[49:41] I really love that money right now.

[49:42] Yeah.

[49:43] That'd be nice.

[49:44] So here's an idea.

[49:45] Yeah.

[49:46] Yeah.

[49:47] And no Indian diversity.

[49:48] Do you want some shares?

[49:49] All right.

[49:50] Well, did you?

[49:51] So this is a great fall of question.

[49:53] So do you take regular distribution from the company or have you just been like,

[49:57] kind of like, you took once or twice and that's like my family set and now everything's still like.

[50:02] Neeperr.

[50:03] Yeah.

[50:04] Yeah.

[50:05] I take a salary at a bonus and then very early on because we started as an LLC.

[50:12] I owned all of the technology and employed everybody and the company bought that from me.

[50:20] God, I said there's been distribution.

[50:22] So you can control both companies.

[50:24] So you had to pick what that was value.

[50:26] That had to be third party.

[50:27] Oh, was it?

[50:28] Okay.

[50:29] We've got to be fair to this.

[50:30] I'm very good.

[50:31] Not all you write.

[50:32] Yeah.

[50:33] So when you've been doing the buybacks, were you at like 50, 50 and then over time, you've kind of like bought your way back to 70, 30 or 30?

[50:41] Yeah, I think, I think, yeah, I think it was like 60 and now it's, well, originally the the Omaha state sky.

[50:50] Mm-hmm.

[50:51] And there's also brand guy.

[50:53] My biggest mistake when I started the company after failing a custom made was I value the company as stupidly low rate.

[51:02] Okay.

[51:03] And so I had just raised $10 million on a $30 million valuation.

[51:06] Right.

[51:07] I started this and I'm like, it's going to be a hobby.

[51:09] This isn't going to be anything.

[51:10] So the Omaha state sky is like, I can make all these connections.

[51:13] I can do all this stuff and it's 75,000 dollars worth of work.

[51:17] Now I'm like, well, I don't have that.

[51:18] So it could be equidating.

[51:19] It's like, okay, great.

[51:20] How much is the company worth?

[51:21] I was like 750 grand.

[51:23] So he took 10% of the company.

[51:24] So he's, he's a 10% signal.

[51:26] Not anymore.

[51:27] Oh, no.

[51:28] And then there was a brand guy.

[51:29] Yeah.

[51:30] He was the same thing.

[51:31] 10% of the company.

[51:32] And as we got going, it was like, that's like way too much.

[51:36] Yeah.

[51:37] And they're not doing anything.

[51:38] Right.

[51:39] It's like one time more.

[51:40] Right.

[51:41] And so we bought them out.

[51:42] We bought them out when the valuation was 48 million.

[51:45] Well, I'm sure they're worth it.

[51:47] And it was, yeah, they got $200,000 a month for two years.

[51:50] Okay.

[51:51] I'm sure you're still thrilled.

[51:52] Yeah.

[51:53] Right.

[51:54] Tell them more than you made it.

[51:55] Yeah.

[51:56] Way more.

[51:57] One good phone call for him.

[51:58] Yep.

[51:59] Right.

[52:00] A little bit of work.

[52:01] Yeah.

[52:02] It's not for life.

[52:03] Interesting.

[52:04] So, okay.

[52:05] So, man, there's so many directions I want to go.

[52:08] But to put a button on on on the story.

[52:12] And then I want to go back and kind of unpack some numbers and things.

[52:15] Yeah.

[52:16] Yeah.

[52:17] Where do you want to?

[52:18] So, where do you want to?

[52:19] If you're not going to IPO.

[52:22] Yep.

[52:23] And you're not going to sell the company.

[52:24] And the CPG playbook is that at some point you turn off the marketing.

[52:27] When is that?

[52:29] Yeah.

[52:30] Not any time soon.

[52:32] Okay.

[52:33] So, you want to keep growing for a minute.

[52:34] Yeah.

[52:35] So, give a goal.

[52:36] Like a billionaire in sales or work.

[52:38] I mean, a billion.

[52:39] I'm very goal oriented.

[52:41] So, I do have a billion on my weightboard.

[52:44] Yeah.

[52:45] I recognized that before that.

[52:46] I had a million and before that, a 10 million and then a hundred million.

[52:49] So, it's just like, it'll be enough for sure.

[52:51] Yeah.

[52:52] Totally.

[52:53] Then it'll be enough.

[52:54] Yeah.

[52:55] Just lay down my arms and walk away.

[52:57] Then you'll be happy.

[52:58] And just totally grow.

[52:59] Yep.

[53:00] Exactly.

[53:01] Yeah.

[53:02] I would like, I think, running this to a billion revenue would be a lot of fun.

[53:05] Yeah.

[53:06] Yeah.

[53:07] I don't know how fast that's going to be.

[53:08] Yeah.

[53:09] We've definitely learned that it's, it's gotten a lot harder.

[53:12] Like as you grow, you do do the marketing role and really, you know, it's just harder.

[53:16] Yeah.

[53:17] One hundred percent on how many customers do you have right now?

[53:19] Like 430,000.

[53:20] Yeah.

[53:21] So, 1 percent on 430,000.

[53:23] It's like, oh, I've said that's just, you know, 43 hundred customers that we just have.

[53:27] If we lose 1 percent, it's like, okay, that's a decent amount of customers.

[53:30] And you're like, well, if it's 10 percent turn annually.

[53:32] Yeah.

[53:33] But I mean, you said, you're keeping, well, 60 of your one or, no, I mean, our

[53:35] chart is like 3 percent a month.

[53:37] Right.

[53:38] Yeah.

[53:39] So that's 30-ish percent or whatever.

[53:40] What do you mean, you have to sign up 12,000 people a month before you stop training

[53:44] while just a chill.

[53:45] Just a chill.

[53:46] Yeah.

[53:47] Yeah.

[53:48] So it's like, it's, those numbers just get over.

[53:50] That's 400 a day.

[53:51] Yeah.

[53:52] Yeah.

[53:53] Right.

[53:54] 400 a day.

[53:55] That's so while we're talking right now, people are just like, they're leaving.

[53:58] They're leaving.

[53:59] Yeah.

[54:00] They're leaving.

[54:01] Yeah.

[54:02] They're leaving.

[54:03] Yeah.

[54:04] Yeah.

[54:05] You're losing your for life.

[54:06] Yeah.

[54:07] Yeah.

[54:08] But I really do love the lifetime.

[54:10] The lifetime offers.

[54:12] Yeah.

[54:13] I have a book that's coming out that talks about this, this particular offer structure.

[54:16] Yeah.

[54:17] A lot of times.

[54:18] Yeah.

[54:19] Lifetime offer.

[54:20] People getting a box of meat seem really magical.

[54:22] Like, goes like, wait, this is going to show up.

[54:24] It's going to be frozen.

[54:25] Yeah.

[54:26] I don't trust it.

[54:27] So money back guarantee, like no questions asked, we'll just, we'll just refund you.

[54:30] Let me, let me talk to some of the fears of business owners around money back

[54:33] guarantees because I talk about them all too.

[54:35] What percentage of customers do you get who ask for refunds?

[54:39] Oh my god.

[54:40] Oh my god.

[54:41] I don't know.

[54:42] They're like, so small.

[54:43] I don't even know the number.

[54:44] Right.

[54:45] Yeah.

[54:46] And the conversion increases certainly worth having for sure.

[54:48] For sure.

[54:49] Also, like, you know, whatever core values is being customer obsessed.

[54:53] Yeah.

[54:54] Like, we actually want to deliver you an amazing product.

[54:56] Right.

[54:57] And so if we fail at that, you should get your money back.

[55:00] Yeah.

[55:01] And it's like, well, I'm worried about that.

[55:03] We'll fix your product.

[55:04] Right.

[55:05] Make your product better.

[55:06] Yeah.

[55:07] Spend time obsessing over your product.

[55:09] So, and you, you'll do very well with money back.

[55:12] It's like dollar per box and then also like happiness per box.

[55:15] Yeah.

[55:16] Almost like your delight per box.

[55:17] Totally.

[55:18] Yeah.

[55:19] I mean, it's all about your, well, the metric that is commonly used is the net promoter score.

[55:23] Yeah.

[55:24] So it's all about your satisfaction with the, and we're constantly asking.

[55:27] Which you're pissed right now?

[55:28] Yeah.

[55:29] It's like a 63.

[55:30] That's great.

[55:31] Yeah.

[55:32] Yeah.

[55:33] We're pretty happy with that.

[55:34] So there's room for improvement.

[55:35] I mean, we know our issues.

[55:36] We want to, we want a perfect experience every time.

[55:39] Yeah.

[55:40] And when you're shipping multiple species, you know, you had 12 to 15 years.

[55:45] Do you do?

[55:46] Yeah.

[55:47] We do see food.

[55:48] How did that?

[55:49] How did you get, was that just a whole other, had to find another supplier?

[55:51] Yeah.

[55:52] I mean, we don't use any of that.

[55:54] So basically, we got going, we'll go all the way back.

[55:57] We got going.

[55:58] We're shipping out boxes.

[55:59] We're making $20 a box.

[56:00] The influencer thing is working.

[56:02] Yeah.

[56:03] We got to have about 6,000 subscribers.

[56:04] So.

[56:05] And it was clear to me that we had no idea what we were doing.

[56:08] It was like, okay.

[56:09] We've been faking it.

[56:11] That's great.

[56:12] But like, we need somebody who knows how to buy a little doll.

[56:14] We need a doll right there.

[56:16] And so again, I went to LinkedIn.

[56:18] Usually we'll on the toilet.

[56:20] And I reached out to this guy who lived in Boston and ran meat and seafood.

[56:27] One of these big grocery chains.

[56:30] But he had retired.

[56:32] Okay.

[56:33] And so I was like, interesting background.

[56:35] Let's talk.

[56:36] Yeah.

[56:37] Pull the matter retirement.

[56:38] And he came and started purchasing meat and seafood for us.

[56:41] Me and then seafood.

[56:42] Yeah.

[56:43] And I mean, the saving.

[56:44] My whole thing was, okay, we're shipping 60,000 pounds of meat.

[56:48] I've got all I have to believe is that somebody can save me like 25 cents a pound.

[56:53] Yeah.

[56:54] And this is like worth it.

[56:55] So he came in and just he's like, you guys are paying.

[57:00] He's like second day is like, you guys are paying enough in chicken breasts that you could send people three pounds.

[57:06] Is that a one pound?

[57:07] You want me to do that?

[57:08] No, I'm like, yeah, yeah.

[57:09] Yeah, be great.

[57:10] Yeah, 25 cents was the target and he was like, I can give you a bucket of hands.

[57:13] Yeah, I mean, multiples of his salary back.

[57:18] And you know, I think it's really important to that you hire experts in certain areas at the right time.

[57:23] Yeah, certain areas.

[57:24] Well, I want to hit on the the met up part of this, which is like, all right, like the big, the big turning points.

[57:31] Because I like, like, what are those those inflection points in the business?

[57:34] So it's like, all right, you switch from raising money to pre-selling.

[57:37] That's probably, I feel like that's like setting yourself up on the right path.

[57:40] Okay, so that was number one.

[57:41] Number two is you realize this influencer thing has some likes to it.

[57:46] And then you go hardcore on getting influencers.

[57:49] You also reverse engineer somebody else's database, which I highly recommend if you're trying to reach out to people to find the high, like, I call me HTT's, but high value targets.

[57:57] Like, how do we, how do we find the HTT's and then, and then grab them? Okay, so you do that.

[58:01] You have a happy accident with free bacon that ends up being a core component of the offer.

[58:07] And then later, you turn on the lifetime version of that and then you do that across kind of horizontally across the box.

[58:14] You obsess about gross margin per box, whatever your unit economics are of the business.

[58:19] You got super dot on that and just want to make every single penny count because it up, you know, you're on the same side of the table figuratively as the customer.

[58:27] You got experts in at the right times the branding person up front, the almost aches guy, later the meat person guy, that all came in at key points to like unlock, you know, levels of profitability and growth.

[58:39] What are some of the other ones that that might have been skipped over in the last year?

[58:42] That's good. It's like, well, it's down in a good way.

[58:46] I think working like so our backbone today, we still don't own our backbone. So distribution, we don't do, we don't own farms, we don't own our own do you want some?

[58:57] No, okay, I was wondering.

[58:59] Because we believe that it's better to work with partners, it's kind of like the Toyota approach work with partners.

[59:05] Hold them, hold their feet to the fire, hold them to a tight spec.

[59:09] Have them do things they're not doing for anyone else, but trust that they know better than me.

[59:14] Yeah, I don't know anything about for me. I don't know anything about slaughterhouses.

[59:17] That's a bad place for me to spend my time.

[59:20] The only piece of our entire backbone that we control is dry ice. We have two dry ice plants.

[59:26] And that's because if you don't have dry ice, you can't ship a box.

[59:30] Yeah.

[59:31] And so we're like, we should, it's like a great insurance policy.

[59:34] Everything else?

[59:35] Because you lose that revenue goes to zero.

[59:37] Yeah, right. Everything else is like, no, I don't think it's worth us of taking.

[59:42] And so, and I think that's like one common mistake in box subscription companies in overfunded companies and just with entrepreneurs in general is really glitter group.

[59:51] Yeah, you need to like own everything, you need to control all of it.

[59:55] And that has been a huge, it's actually been a huge part of our success.

[60:00] And then let's, so because I'm sure you had partnerships that didn't go well.

[60:05] Yep. And you've obviously been really good at building these relationships.

[60:09] So to the great degree possible, do you have any kind of test for how you judge a partner's ability to fulfill their promises before you've started working with them?

[60:21] Because obviously, you know you're bringing a huge amount of business.

[60:23] There's a significant risk that you take on by having a partner do something bad.

[60:28] Obviously, the food, the shoes, liabilities of a whole, you know, whole state has brought me.

[60:32] It's like, I mean, it's a, it's more of a PR nightmare.

[60:34] It took to pull a year to live down the salmonella issue that you had as a micro example.

[60:39] Yeah.

[60:40] So, I mean, on the, on the meat side, we do robust safety audits.

[60:45] And you like, we're not working with you unless we've got a whole bunch of audits.

[60:51] On the other partner side, we're generally trying to work with the best best people like best in class.

[60:57] So you just look at an industry and say, okay, we want to focus of all the different farms in the US that are grass fed.

[61:03] Who's the biggest and the best?

[61:05] And you just trying to do it with them.

[61:07] Yeah, I mean, you, you try to balance like helping small farmers, right?

[61:12] And working with big farmers because a small farmer might have 50 head and we might need like 100,000 head.

[61:19] Right.

[61:20] So we can't work with 2,000 small farmers.

[61:23] We work with, we generally work with collectives that would then work with the farmers.

[61:28] So we're working with that collective saying, this is what we want.

[61:31] This is our spec. This is how we want to raise and then they go and find the farmers.

[61:35] And again, it's like, we don't want to be on the ground.

[61:38] Yeah.

[61:39] You know, I love meeting with farmers and doing all that, but like, that can't be what we do with the farm.

[61:45] Inspecting folks is probably a good idea.

[61:46] So it's like really important to know what you're good at and what you're not good at.

[61:49] And anything that you're not good at, including picking up the phone 1100 times,

[61:53] Yeah.

[61:54] Like, just don't do it. Try to get someone else to do it because you can't, I don't think you can build a business.

[61:58] Unless you're feeling that flow and you're feeling like really engaged.

[62:02] And that can only be done in the work that you're really good at.

[62:05] You've been really good at picking those people though.

[62:07] So like, what's your, obviously there's the reputation of the company.

[62:10] Yeah, right.

[62:11] But like, also you really get it picking like almost a sky and the branding guy that you picked out.

[62:15] And even Nick, who did this first, you know, 1100 calls like, what do you, what do you,

[62:20] Because it's, it's an uncanny trait.

[62:23] Like, you've been really good at it.

[62:24] Just so I'm just like, listening to the story.

[62:26] I have, you haven't mentioned.

[62:27] I'm sure there were some horror stories.

[62:29] But like, it seems like you've had a huge amount of success.

[62:32] And I feel like if I had a different entrepreneur in the chair,

[62:35] I would have, I could totally hear the total other side of the story.

[62:39] I went to a couple partners early.

[62:41] What I learned is you got to control everything.

[62:43] If you want, you know, like,

[62:44] I've, you didn't mean like, I've heard that side.

[62:46] And so you're obviously better at picking partners than most people.

[62:49] So like, what do you think about trying to isolate like this personal work?

[62:55] Yeah, I mean, so early on when you're talking about your first employees.

[62:59] Sure.

[63:00] I have this analogy.

[63:02] I think I stole it from someone, but like, building a company is like hacking through the jungle with machetes.

[63:08] And so you're just like, there's, you're just dropped in the middle of the jungle.

[63:12] You have a machete, you're like, I don't know where we're going.

[63:15] At that point, you need people who are just going to hack day and night with you.

[63:18] Like you just end as grit.

[63:20] So I'm looking for athletes.

[63:21] I'm looking for people who have failed at something.

[63:23] I'm looking for people with a chip on their shoulder.

[63:25] Yeah.

[63:26] You know, daddy issues all of that.

[63:27] Because I've got all that.

[63:28] So look, you know, I want to, you know,

[63:30] That's all great men do.

[63:31] No.

[63:32] Yeah.

[63:33] I, that's the type of person I want.

[63:36] And then as you grow, you realize that like, okay,

[63:39] We need some experience here and how do we get experience?

[63:42] One thing, it doesn't totally answer your question,

[63:44] But one thing that we did that was like, I think pretty,

[63:47] I thought was pretty smart is I call it the barbell strategy.

[63:51] We hired people like out of retirement.

[63:54] Okay.

[63:55] Because they were so far along in their career.

[63:57] Yeah.

[63:58] We found that the middle, like, so really young and really old, worked incredibly well.

[64:03] I would say personally, I've had a lot of experience with that too.

[64:06] Yeah.

[64:07] And so is like they're super busy.

[64:09] They've got kids.

[64:10] If not all these commitments,

[64:11] They want us to be like the one mark on their career.

[64:13] Yeah, the one career, the careerists,

[64:15] out of them, people who want to do the work.

[64:17] Hunger, hunger.

[64:18] Yeah.

[64:19] It's interesting because the people at the very beginning

[64:20] want to work all the time because they want to learn a lot.

[64:22] Yeah.

[64:23] The people at the end want to work because they have nothing else to do.

[64:26] And they want to, in some ways, like,

[64:28] have their experience be used.

[64:29] Like, yeah, they want to be used legacy.

[64:31] Right.

[64:32] And that both of those are actually concentrating on the work itself.

[64:34] The label is described to the work.

[64:36] Totally.

[64:37] And a lot of times people in the middle are,

[64:39] it's like, you're three years on my resume.

[64:41] And I want to, you know, just leverage this,

[64:43] I need to go from director to VP and then I'm like,

[64:45] Yeah.

[64:46] This and I need this.

[64:47] Yeah.

[64:48] And yeah, we just found that people on the ends were just, like, so grateful.

[64:52] And so like, my title obsession.

[64:54] Yeah.

[64:55] Yeah.

[64:56] My knee guy, I just remember this dinner I was at.

[64:59] And it's like, I have my knee guy and blue apron's knee guy was there.

[65:03] And blue apron's knee guy was like 32 years old and like skinny jeans and a nice best.

[65:07] And my knee guy is like,

[65:09] Brazil's like 65 year old.

[65:11] It's like, who do you think's buying chicken for cheaper?

[65:13] Yeah.

[65:14] Like, like, why God looks like me.

[65:16] Yeah.

[65:17] Yeah.

[65:18] I mean, so that has been.

[65:21] And that is, I don't really, like,

[65:25] I don't really know what's happened here.

[65:28] Like, I like to say, like, the business wanted to be something way bigger than I expected.

[65:32] Which was something I just honored that as like,

[65:35] some of these people just kind of fell into my lap.

[65:38] Yeah.

[65:39] But I definitely, my first company, I knew people were off culture and I hired them anyway.

[65:45] Yeah.

[65:46] And this time around, we wrote down our core values and we're like, okay, this is what we're hiring.

[65:50] Yeah.

[65:51] And one of our core values is relentless improvement.

[65:54] And to your question about partners, any partner you work with, there's going to be problems.

[66:01] Sure.

[66:02] And we're just not afraid to talk about them.

[66:04] Yeah.

[66:05] We do quarterly business reviews.

[66:06] We're like, you know, auditing.

[66:07] We're doing a whole bunch of stuff and telling you what you're doing wrong.

[66:11] So you can fix it.

[66:12] Because most partners don't want to, like, just, they want to fire the relationship.

[66:15] We're not, not talk to you.

[66:16] It's like, no, let's just keep getting better.

[66:17] Yeah.

[66:18] Like, let's just get better.

[66:19] Like, we want to lock arms with you and get you better.

[66:21] And so we're also because we're trying to build a long-term thing.

[66:24] Like, we're just locking arms with partners.

[66:26] You can try to just move forward with them.

[66:28] Talk to you.

[66:29] So given the growth rate that you had, so it was like, was it?

[66:32] It was like, five million was the first, like, or second year, I think of business.

[66:36] Right.

[66:37] Yeah.

[66:38] So we started in September of 2015 and we did like, two hundred and the cast yarder.

[66:41] We did like, 500 grant.

[66:43] Yeah.

[66:44] And then we did five million.

[66:45] Yeah.

[66:46] And then 33 million.

[66:47] And then 105 million, 220.

[66:49] And COVID hit.

[66:50] We went to 450.

[66:51] Yeah.

[66:52] And then you have, well, like, five hundred and then five hundredish the next year.

[66:55] Yeah.

[66:56] And then 2550, 550, 550, 550.

[66:58] Yeah.

[66:59] And then last two years ago.

[67:01] So 2023, we went down for the first year.

[67:04] Okay.

[67:05] Which was pretty heartbreaking for a team that, you know, prize yourselves on growth.

[67:08] So it talks me.

[67:09] So yeah.

[67:10] And the last year we started growing again.

[67:11] Okay.

[67:12] So I've, I've two fobs.

[67:13] So first one is talk to me about rush rushing.

[67:17] Like, what's your, because like you, you grew really fast.

[67:20] Yep.

[67:21] And then you, and then you were essentially flat for, like, basically four years.

[67:24] Yeah.

[67:25] So once or so what's?

[67:28] How does your perspective on where you want to take the company affect how you run the company?

[67:37] With regards to growth's rate.

[67:39] Yeah.

[67:40] And like rush around goals.

[67:41] Yeah.

[67:42] I like talking about rush a lot because I think it's where all this takes happen.

[67:46] And you're really fast without the intention of growing really fast.

[67:49] Yeah.

[67:50] Which I find has happened to me multiple times.

[67:54] Yeah.

[67:55] You know, I think that we, so we grew obviously we grew incredibly quickly.

[68:05] The biggest mistake that we made, the biggest rush that we made was we,

[68:12] the wheels kind of felt like they're falling off the bus at like 450.

[68:19] And we decided to bring in a whole bunch of people to help like fix the wheels.

[68:26] We need bodies.

[68:27] We need bodies and we need managers.

[68:29] Yeah.

[68:30] We need people in the middle.

[68:31] The middle.

[68:32] Right.

[68:33] Yeah.

[68:34] Just so I've context.

[68:35] What was the kind of that?

[68:36] Like, I mean, going into cover, we're 85 people.

[68:39] It's doing 200 going into COVID with the heck out of 80.

[68:44] Yeah.

[68:45] And coming like, end at 21, we were at like,

[68:50] to like, one maybe 160.

[68:55] And then we got to a height of 240.

[68:57] Yeah.

[68:58] We've designed on, you know, where we're going to be like 300 people.

[69:01] Yeah.

[69:02] And now I'm like, you know what, it like 150 sounds really good.

[69:05] Yeah.

[69:06] Yeah.

[69:07] We currently have, we have 25 associate center drives facility.

[69:11] And then like 170 people outside of that.

[69:15] And so the rush was we hired a lot of people.

[69:19] What happens to companies?

[69:21] And apparently I've learned now that this is a classic 500 million dollar traffic.

[69:24] So you can add a book to your thing later.

[69:26] The 500 million dollar traffic is something bad happens.

[69:29] You hire a bunch of people because you don't know enough.

[69:32] And everyone starts saying no.

[69:35] Yeah.

[69:36] And you go from capital E entrepreneurship, like a bunch of pirates, like,

[69:40] very little process.

[69:41] We're just going and growing.

[69:43] Yeah.

[69:44] To like, oh, we need, we need process, like, we need capital P process.

[69:48] And entrepreneurship needs to come way down.

[69:51] Yeah.

[69:52] And that's what happened.

[69:53] Because there are a bunch of kids.

[69:54] You're a bunch of kids, like you, Mike, or like, you know, have all these ideas.

[69:57] And like, we need to quickly.

[69:58] We're blessing you and yeah.

[69:59] Hey, guys.

[70:00] So if you're paying careful attention, let me read what the stage of scaling

[70:04] roadmap Mike was at when he was telling the stories by going from 80 to 180 plus employees.

[70:09] Does it sound like recruiters are holding inconsistent standards and the culture suffered?

[70:14] Would you say that there were so many new and existing employees, performance suffers,

[70:18] compliance issues and complete skyrocket?

[70:20] Would you say that you're still paying retail for everything, right?

[70:23] And he's getting overcharge, cash is unprotected and not getting good returns?

[70:27] Would you say that was pretty indicative of the exactly we was going through?

[70:30] Well, that's because he was at the stage of specialized, right?

[70:33] And so the crazy thing is that businesses behave in patterns.

[70:37] So if you'd like to know what stage of scaling your at, you can go to acquisition.com,

[70:42] forward slash roadmap, it's absolutely free.

[70:44] It's argued to you, but a ton of time and effort in this is probably the biggest gift I can give you.

[70:48] Like I said, it's free.

[70:49] So go there, check it out.

[70:50] It'll tell you the exact what you need to do to get the next level.

[70:53] And that's what happened.

[70:55] And at the meantime, my broke my arm, like my everything, everything kind of fell apart at the same time.

[71:00] And it was, it was a slog.

[71:03] And I'm really, like, last year, we grew like 6%.

[71:07] Yeah, like, we'll take it.

[71:09] Yeah.

[71:10] And, you know, so sometime along the journey, I went from like, this is a hobby into,

[71:18] I'm going to just flip this thing.

[71:20] Like I made build this up and sell it for $1 million.

[71:23] And I went on a couple meetings and I was like,

[71:26] That's not real right.

[71:27] And then I just, it just kind of over time came to me

[71:32] of the meat industry's broken.

[71:35] Yeah.

[71:36] Animals are not being treated well in this country.

[71:38] And that's like hurting the health of like people who are eating it.

[71:42] And it's like, I just wish there was a company that like,

[71:45] wasn't funded, had no one breathing down their neck who could just take the,

[71:49] play the long ball.

[71:50] Yeah.

[71:51] And just like, this might take 25 years.

[71:53] Might take 100 years, but it cares.

[71:54] Like we're in it for the long.

[71:55] Right.

[71:56] And then after a while, it was like after pointing on everyone else who should be doing that,

[71:59] it's like, oh, maybe that's me.

[72:01] Yeah.

[72:02] And so I have no idea if this is what's going to happen.

[72:05] Yeah.

[72:06] The plan is to build a multi-generational long-term hold.

[72:11] If you look at food companies in the US,

[72:14] many of them are family controlled, multi-generational long-term holds.

[72:18] And so that's kind of like, that's how it built since the past few years.

[72:23] Yeah.

[72:24] While reinserting myself.

[72:26] And becoming a power organization again, does it feel better?

[72:30] Yes.

[72:31] Yeah.

[72:32] I mean, we did a lot of work in the middle layer.

[72:35] Mm-hmm.

[72:36] Like a lot of directors, a lot of, yeah.

[72:38] Yeah.

[72:39] And our head or head, we had 230 people.

[72:43] And 85 managers.

[72:46] Managed management.

[72:47] Managed management.

[72:48] I just equated to the 85 managers.

[72:51] So like the average person had like one person underneath him.

[72:54] Yeah.

[72:55] And it just equated to like the restaurant worker where the receipt comes out and they

[73:00] grab it and there's a kid who's the chicken palm on their phone.

[73:04] Yeah.

[73:05] Chicken palm.

[73:06] You know, it's like dude, what do you do all of that?

[73:08] Yeah.

[73:09] And so we've done a lot of work.

[73:10] And like retasking people and just making sure that people are in the right

[73:13] seeds, doing things, doing things.

[73:16] And it feels much better.

[73:18] We're moving much quicker.

[73:19] We're growing.

[73:20] Yeah.

[73:21] So you're losing 12,000 customers a month?

[73:24] Yeah.

[73:25] Yeah.

[73:26] How do you have an idea of what the split is of New customers per month in terms of where the

[73:34] sources of customers come from?

[73:36] And is there an acquisition channel that you have not mentioned so far that has

[73:42] that majorly contributes to that?

[73:44] Yeah.

[73:45] So right now we're heavily on referral.

[73:49] We're heavily on meta.

[73:51] Those are like the two.

[73:53] As an referral.

[73:54] As an referral.

[73:55] What's the split?

[73:56] We're like 30% referral.

[74:01] Okay.

[74:02] And then I don't know what meta is because there's also organic and the level and whatnot.

[74:09] Say 30% meta and the other percent organic.

[74:13] Yeah.

[74:14] I feel like it all the other change.

[74:16] Yeah.

[74:17] Yeah.

[74:18] Yeah.

[74:19] Refereals have been really interesting.

[74:21] We now, if you remember, you can refer a friend for a trial box and then a cost $20.

[74:26] Mm-hmm.

[74:27] And we've just seen that work really well.

[74:30] Does the refer what does the refer or get?

[74:32] Nothing.

[74:33] Okay.

[74:34] Yeah.

[74:35] We try to hold a bunch of different things.

[74:36] You can get $50.

[74:37] You get that.

[74:38] What they like the most is giving their friends a box that's almost free.

[74:42] They just pay for shipping a handling.

[74:43] I also like a free-plush shipping basically.

[74:45] Yeah.

[74:46] So it's like boxes free.

[74:47] It's $20 for shipping a handling.

[74:48] Exactly.

[74:48] That's what they're offering.

[74:49] Yep.

[74:50] And that's worked really well.

[74:52] Like the, you obviously get a lot of people who just take get one box.

[74:55] They're like sweet for me and then the pencil.

[74:57] But you know, executed well.

[75:00] You see a lot of people stay and then they just become great customers.

[75:03] Mm-hmm.

[75:04] And yeah, refer to the customer.

[75:05] Yeah.

[75:06] Yeah.

[75:07] I refer to customers a better customer.

[75:08] And so we've really leaned into that as a program.

[75:10] Because it compounds at scale, which is why it's so great.

[75:13] Yeah.

[75:14] Exactly.

[75:15] Yeah.

[75:16] Yeah.

[75:17] Yeah.

[75:18] Yeah.

[75:19] Yeah.

[75:20] Yeah.

[75:21] Yeah.

[75:22] Yeah.

[75:23] Yeah.

[75:24] Yeah.

[75:25] Yeah.

[75:26] Yeah.

[75:27] Yeah.

[75:28] Yeah.

[75:29] Yeah.

[75:30] Yeah.

[75:31] Yeah.

[75:32] Yeah.

[75:33] Yeah.

[75:34] Yeah.

[75:35] Yeah.

[75:36] Yeah.

[75:37] Yeah.

[75:38] Yeah.

[75:39] Yeah.

[75:40] Yeah.

[75:41] Yeah.

[75:42] Yeah.

[75:43] Yeah.

[75:44] Yeah.

[75:45] Yeah.

[75:46] Yeah.

[75:47] Yeah.

[75:48] Yeah.

[75:49] We bought a company called Truffle Shuffle.

[75:50] Um, these two guys, uh, ones actually in Vegas.

[75:53] We're going to see them tonight for dinner.

[75:55] Um, and they, they raised money on Shark Tank.

[75:58] And during COVID, they decided that they were going to sell Truffle's direct

[76:01] to consumer.

[76:02] These little mushrooms that are hard to get.

[76:04] And then once they started selling Truffle's, they realized that no one knows how to

[76:08] cook them.

[76:09] Um, and so they started doing these instructional videos.

[76:11] They do have like the Zorino and I'm putting my Shuffle.

[76:13] Um, and then they're going to sell them.

[76:14] Yeah.

[76:15] Yeah.

[76:16] Yeah.

[76:17] Yeah.

[76:18] Yeah.

[76:19] Yeah.

[76:20] Yeah.

[76:21] Yeah.

[76:22] Yeah.

[76:23] Yeah.

[76:24] Yeah.

[76:25] Yeah.

[76:26] Yeah.

[76:27] Yeah.

[76:28] Yeah.

[76:29] Yeah.

[76:30] Yeah.

[82:31] Yeah.

[82:32] Yeah.

[82:33] Yeah.

[82:34] Yeah.

[82:35] Yeah.

[82:36] Yeah.

[82:37] Yeah.

[82:38] Yeah.

[82:39] It's more than two cents per year.

[82:40] That was probably worth more than two cents.

[82:42] I'll come back in a couple of years and we'll, you know, all across off the billion.

[82:46] Still won't be enough.

[82:47] Yeah.

[82:48] I mean, that's that's the beauty of owning content is pushing it out more, doing more of doing it.

[82:54] It's serving our member.

[82:55] But I think that gives me a lot to think about, turn it to like, how are we pushing it to non members?

[83:01] Because we've definitely been carefully been like, well, this should be a benefit for our members.

[83:06] Yeah.

[83:07] I would just, I'd be curious because I think that because the, because the math problem is, is solvable of does the increase in conversion and retention on members with this added benefit, which I'm sure you've measured like now that we added in the box has it measureably reduced turn or has it measureably increased conversion rate on the page, whatever.

[83:25] And then, versus the amount of new customers that come in with first second, third touch point via content.

[83:33] Yeah. And it might bet would be that you would, this is my bet.

[83:37] I obviously, I don't know, my bet would be that it'd be more on the, on the top end.

[83:40] And then from the ads ads perspective, is then you run a ton of advertising I'm sure.

[83:45] It's like, I feel like that kind of content taking them because if, if you have it public, then you can let the algorithm tell you which pieces are the fire, fire pieces of content.

[83:54] Of the cooking and then push that out.

[83:58] Yeah. As top of funnel awareness ads, you know, retarget people who are at, you know, do 50% 75% whatever it is.

[84:04] With now your conversion stuff, but they have positive brain sentiment because like now they're like, they're in, they're in the market, you know, and then you just consume this, they're literally, they were awesome enough to be inspired.

[84:16] They were inspired enough to watch. And so now we just want to see if there's far enough to buy.

[84:21] Love it. Just love it.

[84:23] Yeah, there's a, there's a book called How Brands Market. And what they, what they found was they put up all these ads, like billboards and stuff trying to get new customers, but they found that it actually drove more repeat orders.

[84:37] And so that's similar like if we, if we put out content to the, they'll be reminded to eat.

[84:41] Yeah, they're me. That's right.

[84:43] Right. There's that. Yeah, I think that, I think it's brilliant.

[84:47] And I think that, like, I'm really excited to see what to do with that. How long it was the acquisition?

[84:51] We bought it in June of last year. Okay. So it's fairly, yeah.

[84:55] Yeah, it's so pretty. We just launched a spice line with them. We've done a bunch of social content.

[85:01] But yeah, I think, you know, making more of it public would probably be a good thing.

[85:06] Yeah, I think we're interested. And so the, the last piece was the ad strategy for Facebook. So what do you,

[85:12] what's been your thinking process for generating probably the amount of creative I'm assuming. I mean, you've got to, I mean, yeah, you probably have to put out 50 pieces of the day.

[85:20] Yeah, and you probably have gotten a crash course on running ads if you're the sea of this business.

[85:26] Yeah. So we've gone all sorts of different ways.

[85:30] We have had ad agencies work on our stuff. So buyer ads and, you know, update and whatnot. We've done in, in house. We've gone back and forth.

[85:39] We're currently outsourced on our ad buying. Interesting.

[85:42] So I'm just meeting buyers who just the creative they do as well. They do the creative. Yeah, we do, we do sound. We give them guidelines, but they're usually the reason why was we weren't moving fast enough.

[85:52] So it had.

[85:54] Yeah, it had become a game of it's like an armsur. So you got to like be changing your creative all the time.

[86:00] And we, we noticed that there were multiple multiple multiple meetings to like talk about, you know, obsess about all these things.

[86:09] It's like, this isn't going to work. We can't do this. So we, you know, we've made a hard pivot.

[86:15] I imagine at some point, we'll be like, okay, we're paying way too much. We didn't take it like do it in house, but the speed to the church percentage of as well.

[86:23] Yeah, but so when you're spending a lot, that's a lot of money. Yeah. And that's baked in the cake.

[86:29] That's baked in the cake. Yeah. Yeah.

[86:32] Have you have your multiple different agencies over time? Or is we have, I mean, there's certain agencies that work well and a small size and certain ones that work in a bigger size.

[86:42] We haven't been able to grow with like one agency. Okay.

[86:46] That's a good one. Yeah. At different times. Okay. So far we've been. We have one right now. It's not like if for running the earlier. Yeah. Got it. Okay.

[86:56] And is that a buddy who had a really big company and hit four different agencies working at the same time. And he was like, yeah, the world's big.

[87:04] All I need all of them just fully focused and I was like, are you worried about like,

[87:09] and it's, and that was the kind of the response was just like, well, there's 300 million Americans. Yeah.

[87:14] A lot of them are like, I'm not giving them no one's getting any other access besides like pixel traffic.

[87:19] And so they can make their look like, self-adverting. Whatever they think is going to convert. And if there's some overlap, there's probably overlap with 10 other thousand companies that are also advertised. Yeah.

[87:27] And so it's more because I think the deficit like the constraint is more the creative power and mental mental bandwidth and attention and skill.

[87:36] Then.

[87:38] Then really anything else. And I say like what like one team and you probably know this from the from the companies are least you experienced this. So when I have.

[87:47] There's this law, Kimmerford is a ton of Billy talked about it, but he basically the square root of every company does 50% of the value creation.

[87:56] So it's like even 100 employees, 10 people do 50% of the value creation. Yeah. And I like I thought about it. I was like, that sounds about right.

[88:03] And like, where's the the contribution towards revenue and all that kind of stuff. And so when you think about that from from the agency owner perspective, it's like, I'm getting these four really good people from this agency on my stuff.

[88:13] But I also want the four really good people from this company and the four really people from this company.

[88:17] Yeah. So it was just like an interesting thing.

[88:19] So you have you have one agency that runs all of it. They're doing.

[88:22] I can't believe they do it. There's doing really everything. So how like they're going on. We do some stuff internally. Yeah.

[88:28] But they're going to like, so they're like going to forums and capturing stuff. No, we have all that be a role.

[88:33] Okay. So you have done you role. You have got to have got that. So they're not they're not really taking any. They're not going all the way to shooting.

[88:40] We have all that content.

[88:42] And yeah, I mean, I think.

[88:46] Facebook has been a wild place for the past few years. It is like either working really well or not working at all.

[88:53] We've also had more competitors come into our space. Everyone's copying us. Everyone's advertising against us.

[88:59] Which I think is a good thing. But it's like, here's why we're better than but you're about as you know. And it's it's a different world.

[89:05] And you know, I think there's been a lot of conversation about this on Twitter recently around like.

[89:12] Facebook is great for retargoning. Somebody comes to your website. Great.

[89:19] Top of the funnel.

[89:20] Little bit harder. Top of the funnel meeting like you're exposing your brand to new eyeballs.

[89:25] That's where I think, you know, in order to grow from just continue the growth, whatever we have to do. We have to have 12 to 15 to add people a month. Like at least.

[89:37] We just need a lot more top of the funnel awareness. And one of the challenges I've had is driving top of the funnel awareness has been really hard.

[89:47] That's where I was like, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

[89:51] So we've done other things like we've tried to do a lot of like brand top of the funnel stuff that has not worked.

[89:58] I'm hopeful on the media thing, but really we're trying to like get the word out about what we're doing. We're trying to change the industry.

[90:04] But the yeah, Facebook has been I mean, you could see it or numbers where like grow grow.

[90:11] Yeah. And then there was the iOS change towards 21. It's just like, yeah. And then inflation. Yeah. Made for businesses is easy. Yeah.

[90:20] This is super easy super easy.

[90:22] Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think that like focusing on the fundamentals is so important for people like you broke down the business into like these moments and they're on the mental's long away.

[90:35] And you know, yeah, business is hard. It can be really challenging. And if you just focus on the things that matter and know the things that matter, it can be a lot easier.

[90:44] And I think, oh, this is me just saying from outside perspective, I think a big part of the success has also been that like you haven't had a mental option for pulling the report.

[90:54] So how you know, and so when problems come, it's like, well, we're not going anywhere. So you just kind of take it one bite at a time. You know, and I think that when you when it's almost like an image if you like if divorce is an option in your mind, then maybe you don't feel like having the conversation.

[91:12] It's like you, you know what, it's through this right.

[91:15] But if it's just never an option, then you just like, I'm on the end right under that hypothetical guys or premise, then it's like that's the premise that you're part of the problems within the business is like, well, either die or we keep going. So we keep going.

[91:31] I'm still alive. There's a little more evil solve these problems. One of the things. Yeah.

[91:35] It is really interesting with the top of the phone component. I feel like the content is the ultimate is the ultimate, because it's the.

[91:43] You know, you can harness the algorithm finding all this because it'll serve the your meat stuff to the people who really want meat.

[91:50] Yeah, and you don't have to figure out what the perfect look like audiences like they'll do that.

[91:54] Yeah. And then then you have this massive retarding audience where you can spend the amount of money you're spending now, but it's all warm traffic.

[92:02] Because you're getting a billion impressions a month on on all this all this content being pumped out to things so cool. I think it's I think it was just a brilliant.

[92:12] Thank you to.

[92:13] No, I'm pumped to say it. Well, I think I can say on behalf of all the entrepreneurs who listen to the game. Thank you so much for sharing the story of a bunch of bucks, books, books to a billy and beyond.

[92:26] But thanks so much. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. You don't know. Hey guys, I hope you enjoyed this conversation that I had with Mike. I pretty much just led this is what I wanted to know about butcher box and hopefully if you're anything like me, you just want to know the business stuff.

[92:40] And so I make all of this content for business owners and if you like this style of conversation going deep breaking down the business.

[92:46] So I'm going to the lessons the theaters are on the way, but really getting tactical. Let me know in the comments and I'll do more of it.

[92:53] And if you were like, hey, this blows, then tell me as well. And I will cry myself to sleep.

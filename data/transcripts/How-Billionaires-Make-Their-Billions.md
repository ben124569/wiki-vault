[00:00] I didn't understand how to make a billion dollars for a very very long time.

[00:04] And the first misunderstanding is that you don't make a billion dollars to become a billionaire.

[00:08] You own stuff that's worth a billion dollars to become a billionaire.

[00:12] Let me walk you through how I used to think this worked.

[00:14] So phase one high school Alex was like, okay, in order to be a billionaire,

[00:19] I have to make a billion dollars every year.

[00:21] Which is ridiculous.

[00:22] But that's what I thought.

[00:23] The second phase I was like, oh, silly high school Alex,

[00:26] that's not how you make a billion dollars.

[00:27] All you have to do is take home a billion, two billion dollars before tax is over your lifetime.

[00:32] And so then third season, which is where I'm out right now.

[00:35] And you don't make it, you own it.

[00:36] So let's say you own a business that is making 10 million dollars a year top line.

[00:41] All right.

[00:42] Now half of that is your profit.

[00:43] If this company is worth 10 times its earnings.

[00:46] And I'll explain why that the why a company like this might be worth 10 times its earnings.

[00:50] After tax is I take home three.

[00:52] Good for me.

[00:52] Next year, because I'm in Mozination and we focus on the main asset that we have our business.

[00:57] And so now I go from $5 million to your profit to $6 million dollars here in profit.

[01:00] It doesn't sound like a huge win.

[01:01] It's like, hey, I had a million bucks to bottom line.

[01:03] Cool, this is great.

[01:04] Well, if we have a 10x multiple, then something I own went from being worth 50 million

[01:09] to being worth 60 million.

[01:12] Now I own 100% of that thing.

[01:13] And I just got something that appreciated by 10 million dollars that I didn't pay tax on.

[01:17] Wait a second.

[01:18] What I got out of the business only went from three to three and a half million.

[01:21] After tax is right six at 40% and you get to three and a half to take home.

[01:24] I only made an extra $500,000 after taxes this year.

[01:28] No, you made an extra $10 million after taxes because the thing that you own appreciated by

[01:33] 10 million dollars.

[01:34] And that's the thing that I didn't understand for very long time.

[01:37] And so now let's zoom out.

[01:39] You want to be a billionaire.

[01:40] Again, it's not by me side hustling my way to a billion.

[01:43] Like Zuckerberg didn't have Airbnb's use flipping on the side while he's building Facebook.

[01:48] What did you do to become a billionaire?

[01:49] He built Facebook.

[01:50] If you have the opportunity to spend half of your time obsessing about your passive income,

[01:56] rather than saying, huh, I wonder if I could take my five million dollar profit business.

[02:01] Focus all my attention on it and make it into a six million dollar profit business.

[02:04] Then all of a sudden I just added $10 million dollars in my net worth.

[02:07] And so this is how a billion dollars actually is made.

[02:09] You have something that makes between $80 and $100 million in EBITDA or fancy worth for profit

[02:16] that you get a multiple on.

[02:17] And usually companies of that size tend to treat 15 times earnings.

[02:20] Like if you look at the S&P.

[02:22] All right, so you really only need somewhere in the air of like $70 million in EBITDA to be a billionaire.

[02:27] Because you own the company.

[02:28] So it means that you'd have to make a little bit more than $1.3 million.

[02:32] $1.5 million per week in take home.

[02:34] Which I know that that sounds crazy.

[02:35] But like you have to think in increments.

[02:37] Like imagine how much you made five years ago.

[02:38] That's an entrepreneur.

[02:39] How crazy small does that feel to you now?

[02:41] Because you've leveled up.

[02:42] And so as much as whatever number I just said to you, you might sound like a lot.

[02:45] Five years from now, you might be in shooting distance.

[02:47] And so it's really just about understanding like how do I reverse engineer what has to happen.

[02:51] And if you want to be a billionaire, it's like, okay, well, how to make a million dollars,

[02:53] $1.5 million a week in profit.

[02:55] Well, if I'm running a 30% margin business, I got to make $6 million a week.

[02:59] There's 52 weeks, I got to make $300 million top line.

[03:01] Okay, so then you can start actually putting tangible goals to this.

[03:05] I want to become a billionaire.

[03:06] You become a billionaire by owning something worth a billion dollars.

[03:09] And if you really want to be smart about it, you don't shoot for a billion.

[03:12] And here's why.

[03:13] You want to shoot for $10 billion or $50 billion.

[03:15] And I know this is going to sound crazy.

[03:17] But realistically, I would never imagine trying to pursue an opportunity that was capped at $100 million

[03:23] a year.

[03:23] You would have to think about opportunities that won when I limited by your time.

[03:26] Two could serve a very big marketplace, three had very high-grorous margin.

[03:29] And four, you'd think probably on a very, very long time horizon.

[03:32] And then all of a sudden, you're thinking like a billionaire.

[03:34] The goals we have matter matter more because of how we measure them.

[03:38] And the increments in which we used to build them, more than with the actual goal at self-is.

[03:42] And so when someone tells me they've a goal to make six figures, what happens is they're

[03:45] going to think that six figures is the cap.

[03:47] And they're going to break you down in a tiny, 80-bit of units.

[03:49] And they're going to basically say 100% of my effort equals $100,000.

[03:53] And they're going to measure in tiny units.

[03:54] And then they're going to do 100% effort.

[03:56] And they're going to be like, ah, I was at 94 this year.

[03:58] But if you're thinking about making $10 million, then you can, you'll think in like, okay,

[04:03] for me to make $10 million, I got to sell, let's say a $10,000 thing.

[04:06] And I got to sell $1,000.

[04:08] Okay, that means $3,000.000 things today.

[04:10] And if I close one out of three calls, that means I have to dig nine calls a day.

[04:13] Okay, well, how much do I have to spend to get a call for this thing?

[04:16] All of a sudden, you start thinking in a much bigger increment.

[04:19] And you feel like, why don't know what I could sell for $10,000?

[04:21] Well, then you got to figure out something that makes someone else $100,000.

[04:25] And you can sell something that's worth 10.

[04:27] They're reaching out making up money, because you don't know how to provide an effect.

[04:30] The reason that like a lot of the wealth in the world sits with finance here is just because

[04:33] they know how to take someone passively.

[04:35] And they can say, hey, man, just give me a billion dollars.

[04:37] And I'll just make you 10% a year on it.

[04:40] And they know how to make 15% a year.

[04:42] And they make that extra five on a billion.

[04:44] And they take home 50 million a year.

[04:45] And they're like, works for me.

[04:47] If you can approach the problem that way, you'll start thinking more along the lines of the people

[04:52] that I think you're trying to emulate.

[04:54] You don't make it, you own it.

[04:55] You get paid for what you do, you get returns on what you own.

[04:57] That $50 million business that we talked about before,

[05:00] $10,000, $5,000 profit, 10x.

[05:02] I would sell one pay, 10x or something.

[05:03] You're like, I wouldn't pay $50 million dollars for business.

[05:05] It's making five.

[05:06] Let me tell you why you would.

[05:07] So if that fish is went from five to six,

[05:09] and then went 20% again, because I was a 20% growth at 7.2.

[05:13] And then 20% again would be 8.6.

[05:16] And 20% again would be 10.2.

[05:20] You know, and keep going.

[05:20] If you added all those things up, you'd be at 40-ish million in earnings over the next five years.

[05:25] And remember, we bought it for 50.

[05:26] But wait, now we still own the thing.

[05:29] And it's making 12.5 million in profit.

[05:31] Wait, if we just applied 10x and realistically, at this point,

[05:34] it probably closer to 12x.

[05:35] But let's just still apply 10x for this.

[05:37] Now we have 125 million dollar thing that we paid 54

[05:40] that already paid us 40 back.

[05:42] And this is where it gets even juice here.

[05:43] To buy that $50 million thing, I had to write a check for 50.

[05:46] I wrote a check for 15, and I took a loan for 35.

[05:49] Huh.

[05:50] And so then at the end of this whole thing,

[05:52] I put my 15 million down.

[05:54] I pay back my loan for the 35.

[05:57] It's only a $10 million left over that I got to pay back.

[05:59] And now I get 100% of that 125 million.

[06:03] Mine is my original 10, because I covered five of it from the cash flow.

[06:06] Oh, I actually made $129.

[06:09] That's why people do it.

[06:10] The smart money, if you want to sell to institutional investors,

[06:12] they think that way.

[06:13] And so you have to think that way about the assets that you own

[06:15] and the assets that you're building.

[06:16] That is like ultimately how you can make huge leaps in wealth.

[00:00] Let me proper introduce our guests.

[00:02] So this is Alex Hermosie from Jim launch.

[00:06] So listen to you guys.

[00:07] This is the all time biggest internet marker

[00:12] for fitness, the everless.

[00:14] Okay, so I'm gonna share my screen in just a second here.

[00:17] And you guys have heard me say this,

[00:19] one of my all time favorite entrepreneurs

[00:21] is Russell Branson from ClickFunnels.

[00:24] Russell Branson calls Alex Hermosie the best sales guy

[00:27] that he knows.

[00:29] He said it to you one time on a vlog.

[00:33] Okay, so this is a big dude.

[00:35] I just said this is not too long.

[00:37] I ran into a situation being six months ago.

[00:40] I was feeling a little caved in.

[00:42] Somebody said some stuff, a couple of things.

[00:44] That's some stuff.

[00:45] I'm like, yeah, Alex, I'm facing this dude.

[00:47] What you know, like, what's your opinion?

[00:50] And you basically told me what I kind of knew

[00:52] which was like, dude, they don't matter

[00:53] what people say about you matters what you say about you.

[00:55] And there's a truth to what they're saying

[00:57] and that's what it hurts.

[00:58] So if you know what you're doing, what you stand for,

[01:01] none of that shit matters.

[01:02] And dude, I snapped out of it.

[01:03] Okay, so you guys know some of the stuff I've been able to achieve.

[01:07] Oh yeah, this is a guy that I'm like, dude,

[01:08] this is like a big bro.

[01:10] This guy right here is the real deal

[01:12] and he's here today.

[01:14] He had a surgery and he's like,

[01:15] whatever I can do to support community,

[01:17] drop some gems and spire.

[01:19] Like I'm here.

[01:19] I got a presentation.

[01:20] If not, I'm gonna share my story

[01:22] and whatever you need I'm here.

[01:24] So Alex Hermosie from Gymlaunch,

[01:27] these are 25 million dollar plaques.

[01:30] The one being like, let me give you the updated one.

[01:32] Let me give you the updated one.

[01:33] Where I got, I got all four.

[01:35] I got all four.

[01:36] I got all four, but $100 million.

[01:38] $4, $4, $4, $4, $4, $4, $4,

[01:39] they're like, Jack's a DJ.

[01:40] They say the micro Jordan, these are like plaques.

[01:43] This is the Michael Jackson of Internet Martin guys.

[01:46] Big freaking deal.

[01:48] So Alex from Gymlaunch, bro, welcome man.

[01:51] Did I see him?

[01:52] You kind of see him.

[01:52] Either way, Alex Becker, who's the founder of that,

[01:56] could me in recently to something he's like,

[01:58] dude, you're your, you're, you're, you're,

[01:59] you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're,

[01:59] you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're,

[01:59] you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're,

[01:59] you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're,

[02:00] you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're,

[02:02] you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're,

[02:03] you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're,

[02:04] you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're,

[02:05] you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're,

[02:06] you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're,

[02:07] you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're,

[02:09] you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're,

[02:11] you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're,

[02:14] you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're,

[02:16] you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're,

[02:18] you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're,

[02:20] you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're,

[02:22] we've spent just under three million dollars in advertising.

[02:26] And so there's a lot of other pieces to, you know,

[02:29] making more, but just for everyone on this call,

[02:32] we're talking specifically about sales, correct?

[02:36] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

[02:39] not, not, not even nine percent of these guys are,

[02:41] or closers, and they're getting closing,

[02:44] just a couple of people are sort of like a closer agency,

[02:46] when they partner up, but they don't like you,

[02:47] and they're like, hey, let's do like a little JB deal,

[02:49] I slime or deals.

[02:51] Okay, sweet.

[02:52] Well then, why don't I, so what I'm gonna do is,

[02:55] because I do have a presentation, which is just how I think

[02:58] about sales, and I have the third part of the presentation

[03:02] about scaling sales teams, does anyone

[03:03] you're have multiple closers you work for them,

[03:06] or is most people just closing on your own right now?

[03:10] Okay, you guys gotta talk with Alex, you don't bite.

[03:13] I can't see the chat, I can't see the chat.

[03:16] You don't want to see that.

[03:18] We're working towards that, Alex.

[03:20] Okay, so how about this?

[03:22] I'll give you the things that, so Russell,

[03:25] when I first met him was like, dude,

[03:26] how did you learn how to sell so well?

[03:28] And it was because I looked at my CRM

[03:31] and I'd done 4,000 sales, one on one, in fitness.

[03:35] And so that's a lot of reps, you know,

[03:38] I was taking 20 consults a day for like four years.

[03:41] And so that's in person face to face.

[03:43] My team would double a trip with book me every 30 minutes,

[03:46] and I just sold the same thing over and over again,

[03:48] and because I was really good at sales,

[03:50] I ended up not hiring a ton of sales people,

[03:52] and I would actually have my manager set appointments

[03:54] for me all at one location, so I had six gyms.

[03:57] And so I would go there, they'd stack up an entire day.

[04:00] I'd mowed down a whole day, go to a different gym,

[04:03] and they'd been stacking all the appointments,

[04:04] and I'd mowed down.

[04:05] And so usually I'd do 20 to 25 consults a day.

[04:08] And you just get these reps in of reading people,

[04:11] gauging tonality, and seeing where you need to lean in

[04:14] and where you need to lean back.

[04:16] And so over time,

[04:18] then sort of training sales people and sales managers,

[04:20] I had a remote sales team, we'd fly out and do turn around,

[04:24] like in person, so I'd eight guys, we'd fly out to eight facilities

[04:27] every month, and we'd turn these facilities around,

[04:29] because I know Mike, you're in the fitness world before this.

[04:32] And then I brought that sales team in house,

[04:35] and they started doing phone sales for high ticket.

[04:36] So I've had in person, phone, high ticket, low ticket,

[04:40] we've kind of done a lot of those things

[04:42] that train mortgage leads teams, so kind of the whole gambit.

[04:45] And there's definitely some things that I've seen,

[04:48] you know, I brought every sales product on the market,

[04:50] I brought grants up, but ballford stuff.

[04:53] And I think there's a lot of merit,

[04:54] and there's a lot of good stuff out there,

[04:56] but in my experience, simplicity is with scales.

[04:59] And so I'll give you, if you're okay with it,

[05:01] I'll give you the few things that I have implemented consistently

[05:06] within my companies that have generated out-size returns.

[05:08] Is that cool?

[05:10] All right, I'm gonna do it.

[05:12] What I'm gonna do is my role.

[05:14] Let's keep going.

[05:15] All right.

[05:17] Full jam.

[05:18] So as I said, simplicity, right?

[05:20] I'm the world's best graphic designer.

[05:23] As you can see here,

[05:25] some friends who show the real keys of the kingdom.

[05:28] So everybody here, everybody here selling expensive stuff,

[05:31] is that most people on this call?

[05:33] Yes.

[05:34] Every news I take Alex, fan, test it.

[05:37] All right, everyone still see me?

[05:40] And the screen?

[05:41] Yep.

[05:42] All right, rock and roll.

[05:43] All right, so I'm guessing this guy's in your first rodeo.

[05:46] Not your first presentation,

[05:47] the sexy headliner, big promise.

[05:48] And so if you have failed for you guys

[05:51] to grow your thing in the past,

[05:52] the promise you snuck your fault, lots of information,

[05:54] very confusing.

[05:56] And you can sometimes be inundated

[05:59] with lots of different salespeople's information.

[06:01] You've got Mike here who's a gem and knows his shit

[06:03] and you guys were lucky to have him.

[06:05] But hopefully in this presentation,

[06:07] I will put some of those fears to rest of like,

[06:09] what if I never make it?

[06:10] What if I never turn this corner

[06:12] and become the salesperson I want?

[06:13] What if I never hit the 100 grand a year?

[06:15] What if I never hit the 100 grand a month?

[06:16] Or whatever, they don't hit the million a month goal that I have?

[06:19] And then what does that mean about me?

[06:21] Right, if you've ever thought those things,

[06:23] like I can tell you, I did too,

[06:25] right after the instance that I had

[06:27] Mike with that individual,

[06:29] an individual drained my entire bank account

[06:31] and then sent it to their girlfriend,

[06:32] and it's weed in and then followed bank receipts.

[06:34] After that happened, I had $1,200,

[06:36] because I had sold all my gems

[06:37] and put my money into that account.

[06:39] So I started at zero, which I'm very grateful for,

[06:42] because it gave me the experience that I have now.

[06:44] And so what I'm going to show you is that

[06:46] you can have a simple sales process

[06:47] that can yield outsides returns.

[06:49] A lot of people like to make this fancy,

[06:51] because it makes it easier to sell stuff

[06:52] to people about selling.

[06:54] But these are the things that I have seen that up unlocked the growth.

[06:57] For us, because I don't think

[06:58] I'm the best marketer out there.

[07:00] I think we've simply attached a phone to a funnel,

[07:02] and we've been very efficient at it.

[07:04] And so as a result of that,

[07:06] I've always been able to make more per customer

[07:08] than anyone else, because of how efficient

[07:10] we are at the conversion process.

[07:12] All right, and so that's what we're here for.

[07:13] So I want to show you exactly step by step,

[07:15] our process for selling.

[07:17] And so there should be two types of people here.

[07:19] Some of you guys who are under a hundred thousand dollars a month,

[07:21] and I'll show you how to never compete on price again.

[07:23] And if you guys are over a hundred thousand dollars a month,

[07:25] I'll show you exactly what we did to scale a team

[07:27] to get to a million a month and beyond.

[07:29] Is that cool?

[07:30] Because if you're under a hundred, it's just you.

[07:32] If you're over a hundred, you need people.

[07:34] So it's kind of like the actual selling itself

[07:37] and then the scaling of the sales.

[07:39] So that's kind of the goal for the 60 minutes.

[07:40] I'll probably be able to get it done in 40, yes, I'll talk fast.

[07:43] So we can have some time.

[07:45] Everyone can just listen fast.

[07:46] Is that all right?

[07:47] All right, I'm going to go fast.

[07:48] Yeah.

[07:49] Got it.

[07:51] So I'm really fortunate.

[07:52] Yeah, now we're at 105 or 110 or whatever it is.

[07:55] In selling stuff, which has been cool,

[07:57] which has been coolers, we've been able to donate to causes.

[08:00] You guys don't know my story, but I had a Jim Pitcher

[08:03] after school who stayed with me.

[08:05] He didn't have to.

[08:05] He didn't know me from anybody.

[08:07] And he worked out of me for an entire year

[08:08] and taught me how to work out,

[08:10] because I was like, I'm really insecure kid.

[08:12] And as a result of that, I got into fitness.

[08:14] And so I feel like it's all over opportunity,

[08:15] because a lot of you guys are on here,

[08:16] like we're already in the top 1% in the world.

[08:19] You know what I mean?

[08:20] We're bitching about not making 100 grand a month.

[08:23] Like fuck you, you know what I mean?

[08:24] I grill it.

[08:25] And so it's been a great coverage to be able to give back.

[08:28] And we've donated 1.4 million just in the last three years.

[08:31] Actually 1.7, now I've stopped it that.

[08:34] But anyways, just to causes that we care about.

[08:36] And so for us, it's kids being able to have the opportunity

[08:38] that we had.

[08:39] All right.

[08:40] And if you guys are in the fitness industry,

[08:41] Arnold was my hero as a reason I quit my job.

[08:43] And I've been able to grow a friendship with him,

[08:45] which has been awesome.

[08:47] And we've had over a thousand clients,

[08:49] hit 100,000 dollars a year,

[08:50] using the sales framework I'm gonna show you.

[08:52] All right. So like, you can imagine that these people

[08:56] are not maybe as good as you are.

[08:58] You can imagine that somebody in that thousand

[09:00] is probably not as naturally talented.

[09:01] Right. So the process works.

[09:03] Okay. And we've had a lot of people over seven figures now.

[09:06] But it wasn't that way, right?

[09:07] So this is me when I started my first gym.

[09:09] I slept on the floor.

[09:10] I had $5,000 total.

[09:12] My rent was $5,000.

[09:13] And so I had one month,

[09:14] I had to learn how to make money.

[09:16] And I built a funnel,

[09:18] because I learned this from the internet.

[09:20] And I was actually, I sent this picture to my dad

[09:21] because I was so excited.

[09:23] I was so proud of this picture.

[09:25] Cause I sold that many people in the first two weeks.

[09:29] For free.

[09:30] And things started to grow.

[09:32] Right. I was my, one of my gym's.

[09:33] I had nine employees.

[09:34] I felt like a bad ass.

[09:36] You know, my dad finally told me

[09:37] that I, you know, wasn't a schmuck for, you know,

[09:39] being an idiot and getting the fitness.

[09:41] I thought I felt like I was figuring things out.

[09:43] And all of a sudden, Facebook slap happened.

[09:45] This is years ago.

[09:46] There's been many slaps.

[09:47] Facebook just kind of,

[09:48] kind of has it's, it's, it's, it's,

[09:49] it's bitch hand,

[09:49] proverbially swinging back and forth.

[09:51] But, you know, we got slapped and we were not,

[09:53] my, my lead costs won't have five x, right?

[09:55] And so my, my money, my money making rain turned into a desert.

[09:59] And the thing was, my marketing was losing money every day.

[10:01] And I like to think about what's letting my dad down.

[10:03] And more realistically, having my dad be right.

[10:05] I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, all right, cool.

[10:09] And so the question that I asked myself

[10:11] is like, how can I afford to get more leads, right?

[10:13] And so I called him my friends up and he had a,

[10:14] he was a brick and mortar, Jim owner,

[10:16] and he told me that things were going great for him.

[10:18] And I was like, what the hell did?

[10:19] What are you doing?

[10:20] And he was like, dude, we just,

[10:21] we just attached a phone to the phone.

[10:23] And I was like, no shit.

[10:24] He's like, we're selling expensive stuff on the front end now,

[10:26] instead of selling trials.

[10:28] And I was like, well, that's cool.

[10:29] I'll do that.

[10:30] And so we went from losing two and a half,

[10:31] two to one, to making 10 to one return on the front end, right?

[10:34] With that meant for my business,

[10:35] is I went from being able to break even at $10 a lead,

[10:38] to me able to spend up $100 a lead and still make money,

[10:41] which is crazy, right?

[10:42] And so then things started growing, and for me.

[10:44] And then we, you know, open location after location

[10:46] and things grow.

[10:47] And I met this guy and I was, I joined his mastermind,

[10:52] and I was trying to, I told him I wanted

[10:53] to create a nationwide gym chain.

[10:55] And he said, you should teach other people

[10:56] how you do what you do and not grow that chain.

[10:59] And I was like, well, you make more money than me.

[11:01] So, okay, I'll listen.

[11:02] And so then I started making our junior marketing system,

[11:05] Mike, this is by the way at that guy's gym.

[11:07] And at 1951, signups in 19 days,

[11:10] and that was the stack of contracts.

[11:12] Some of you guys may have seen this,

[11:13] it was like the most run ad for like a year and a half.

[11:16] But we did, you know, $100,000 in 19 days and sales,

[11:19] like in the get-out, right?

[11:21] So these are the three frameworks.

[11:22] Sorry, I spent three that because we already covered

[11:24] a little bit of my story earlier,

[11:25] I want to get through it.

[11:27] And these are the three frameworks

[11:28] that I kind of discovered to scale, I take it, all right?

[11:30] And it'll take, if you're partnering somewhat with someone,

[11:34] then it'll help take the losing funnels

[11:35] and turn them into cash machines.

[11:37] And I mean that genuinely.

[11:38] All right, so the three frameworks that I do

[11:40] is what is the closer framework, all right?

[11:42] These are the questions that get prospects to say yes, all right?

[11:45] And so adding this to any kind of,

[11:46] any funnel process is gonna instantly make it more profitable, all right?

[11:50] And I'm gonna walk through the questions that we ask

[11:52] and specifically what only three things

[11:53] that you can say on a sales call, period.

[11:55] It's a no more statement,

[11:56] it's take that all the sales guys that even my guys make

[11:58] and I have to remind them of.

[12:00] All right, the second thing is the conviction framework.

[12:01] So anyone who believes can outperform a season sales

[12:04] throughout by simply learning to control their tone.

[12:06] All right, so some of you guys right now,

[12:07] can I get a hand, I'm gonna unsure my screw up,

[12:09] but can I get hands on the screen of who here is newer

[12:12] to this, newer to high ticket sales?

[12:15] Okay, great, perfect.

[12:17] Then this is for you.

[12:18] I'm gonna show you how you can beat the best sales reps, all right?

[12:21] And this is how I never ever hire season to closers,

[12:24] just FYI, no, no, it's all like,

[12:27] we're gonna try to trade examples, people's I don't.

[12:30] But I'm gonna show you how you can beat season prep,

[12:33] season pros, all right?

[12:35] All right, which if I can find my presentation,

[12:37] there we go.

[12:38] Um, by learning control your tone.

[12:42] In the last one is scaling,

[12:43] so for all you guys who are over $100,000 a month

[12:45] and need a scale of team,

[12:46] I'm gonna show you how to duplicate the skill

[12:48] and other people, all right?

[12:49] Cause it's one level of the skill is learning the sell,

[12:52] another level of the skill is teaching the sell.

[12:55] And it's a more valuable skill.

[12:56] So if you can duplicate your skill in someone else,

[12:59] that is how you can make 10 times 100 times more money

[13:02] because it's no longer, you're no longer constrained by your time.

[13:05] All right?

[13:06] So let's rock and roll, close your framework.

[13:08] So after pouring over like hundreds of scripts,

[13:11] like I mean, at hundreds of scripts,

[13:13] I realized that there was always like these minor differences

[13:16] in wording, but I've had these kind of main milestones

[13:18] along the way, I ended up closing the sale, right?

[13:21] And the nice thing is that this process works for beatasy

[13:24] and beatabies, I don't know what stuff you're selling,

[13:26] but it works for both.

[13:27] And it works for 500, all it takes is as much as 100,000,

[13:30] it takes the process as the same, all right?

[13:32] And the way I teach my sales teams

[13:33] and now thousands of clients is this acronym,

[13:36] and like even when I'm thinking through sales calls,

[13:38] we use it like closer, see, right?

[13:41] L. So the C is clarify why the person is on the phone with you,

[13:45] all right?

[13:46] That's the objective, why are you here?

[13:47] Why'd you take the time to take the call?

[13:49] What's the problem, right?

[13:51] What are we trying to solve here?

[13:53] After that, they were like, God, so what I'm hearing is,

[13:56] you're struggling with this, does that sound about right?

[13:58] I'm going to label you with the problem.

[14:00] After that, we overview your class paints.

[14:03] It's like, okay, so you have this problem,

[14:04] I can't be the first recipe of talks

[14:06] who about this, tell me a little bit about what you've done

[14:07] so far to try and get past this, right?

[14:10] Tell me more about that, how that work out for you, okay?

[14:13] Understand it.

[14:14] After that, it's like, okay, so I'm hearing all these things,

[14:17] this is why you hear, this is what you're trying to get,

[14:19] this is what you've tried and hasn't worked, okay?

[14:21] Well, can I tell you about how I think we might be able

[14:22] to solve your problem?

[14:24] This is where we sell the vacation, right?

[14:26] And then finally, step before finally,

[14:28] we explain away their concerns.

[14:29] So this is where we tell them about the program

[14:31] and they were like, do you want to do it?

[14:33] They say, yes or no, if they say, no,

[14:36] then we explain away their concerns to they say, yes.

[14:38] And then once they say, yes, we reinforce the decision.

[14:41] And this last R here is a point that I added years later

[14:44] because we realize that the sale, the sale just continues

[14:49] throughout the entire customer relationship, right?

[14:51] And so for you guys, if you're dealing with clients

[14:54] who you're selling for, you have to also sell them

[14:56] on continuously selling, right?

[14:58] You might have closed the car or closed the first payment,

[15:01] but they're onboarding experience, they got to close them again.

[15:04] And then after that, when they have their first week

[15:05] check-in call, they got to get closed again

[15:07] because we have to consistently sell them

[15:09] on why they should do anything.

[15:10] Why should they not just watch Netflix?

[15:12] Why should they take action?

[15:13] Why should they have the discomfort of getting,

[15:15] you know, smacked on the film by a stranger?

[15:17] Right? Why should they feel the sting of failure?

[15:20] We have to sell them consistently

[15:22] to help them overcome their pains, right?

[15:24] And so I'll show you each one of these more closely.

[15:26] So clarifying why they're there, right?

[15:28] It's like, what made you come in today?

[15:29] What made you reach out?

[15:30] What's your goal right now?

[15:30] Why is that important to you, right?

[15:32] Okay, helping me understand what are we doing here, right?

[15:36] This is one where someone in the beginning, like, you have to hit this

[15:39] because if someone says like,

[15:40] you guys wanted to find out more information.

[15:42] You're like, cool, but why?

[15:44] Like, what did you want the information to solve?

[15:46] What was the, like, I'm sure you don't just go

[15:47] around collecting information on that, right?

[15:49] Like, there's something you're trying to get out of this.

[15:51] What's the problem?

[15:52] And then they, and then you get what you need.

[15:54] You're like, got it. Okay.

[15:56] So just so I'm hearing you right, it sounds like this is your goal, correct?

[15:59] Then they acknowledge they have a problem.

[16:01] This isn't important because they have to say it.

[16:03] They have to own it. I can't cure cancer until you admit that you have it, right?

[16:07] We got to give it to you before we can cure it.

[16:09] After that, we overview the past, right?

[16:11] So it's like, what if you tried to find all the copies this?

[16:13] How long did you do it for?

[16:15] How long ago? How did that work for you?

[16:17] What else have you tried?

[16:18] We called this the pain cycle, right?

[16:20] We consistently do this over and over again to we've exhausted all options, right?

[16:24] At that point, we have tons of ammo that we can use later in the close to

[16:26] future you're aware of, right?

[16:28] And the big piece here is we explained how it's not their fault because if they had this

[16:32] missing piece or two of the equation, they were halfway there.

[16:35] There were three corners the way there.

[16:36] They were just missing this one piece which we're going to provide for them, right?

[16:39] And the nice thing is, is for most of you, hopefully you're selling it up a holistic solution,

[16:44] right? So for example, I'm going to use a fitness example because Mike's from

[16:47] that background too. If someone came in and said they had workouts in the past,

[16:51] I'm going to be like, I'm not telling you that you need to work out.

[16:53] It's great, but you also need the nutrition and the accountability, right?

[16:56] You need nutrition to make sure they stop eating shit because if you just

[16:58] are working on eating doughnuts, it's not going to work, right?

[17:00] Of course. Now if I make you the best plan in the world, but you know,

[17:02] follow it's not going to work either. That's why you need the accountability,

[17:04] that's what I'm here for. And so from that point, that's going to how you can

[17:07] naturally transition. So it's like, I'm hearing these things,

[17:09] this is what you're missing.

[17:10] Would you only hear how the program works?

[17:12] Because I think when my people will solve that for it, they'll say,

[17:14] yes, all right, so what we've seen is that there's three things that make

[17:17] clients successful, right? And at this point, this is my belief,

[17:20] is that three things has been unequivocal on most pitches,

[17:24] is that I think it's human brain, as you can't take more than three.

[17:26] But typically, it's like three pillars to the stool or three, you know,

[17:31] finitrition accountability. If I was selling leads, I'd want them to be,

[17:34] you know, timely, you know, qualified and, you know, exclusive, right?

[17:41] There would be three elements to make with what makes a good lead, right?

[17:43] There's always three that you can usually find when you're selling a solution.

[17:47] And most times, not most times, every time, if you're on the phone,

[17:52] the prospect, you always have the upper hand because they have admitted at the beginning

[17:55] of this phone call that they have a problem. They have not solved it.

[17:59] And so, and, apparently, they're going to be missing one of the keys.

[18:01] They cannot have them all or they would not be on the phone. So you have, you,

[18:04] you, you are in an unloosable situation, unless you choose to lose it, right?

[18:08] Unless you choose to lose the frame. And so in this instance,

[18:12] it has been my experience that we use stories, short anecdotal stories,

[18:17] to break the belief of the prospect around a topic. What's important here is that we don't get into

[18:23] jargon, right? We don't get into a techno-bable and talking about the program and the modules

[18:30] and the things they're going to do because all of that sounds like work.

[18:35] And that's not what they're there for. They're there for a result, right? And so, instead,

[18:40] I would say something like, with the fitness or socially accountability, like I said earlier.

[18:44] So if I was trying to explain accountability, I'd be like, listen, you don't have accountability.

[18:47] When you were a kid, you ever have your parents telling you to brush your teeth. They were like,

[18:51] yeah, like, you know how you're like, I don't want to. I don't want to. And they would tell you,

[18:54] oh, no, you got to go brush teeth and you can go eat brush your teeth and you'll be socked back to that.

[18:57] Next night, you did the same thing. They'd say brush teeth, you go brush teeth, go back to bed.

[19:01] But you're in a daught now, right? You brush your teeth. They're like, yeah.

[19:04] And that's because you had external accountability that turned into an internal habit, right?

[19:09] And that's what we're going to do for you here, right? So I didn't tell them about

[19:12] fucking the coaching call that they're going to have and the posts that they're going to have and

[19:15] the blah, blah, blah. We told them as the result of that would give them an anecdotal story that

[19:20] made sense to them. That's probably a really key point. I just want to drive home here.

[19:23] So when you have your pitch part, it shouldn't be longer than three minutes, like, tops,

[19:28] because no one really gives a shit. And at the end of the day, the reason they're going to buy

[19:32] is going to be because of how understood they feel. So how much when you went through that overview

[19:39] of the pain, you were able to restate back to them accurately, exactly how they felt and the struggles

[19:46] they are experiencing, which is why you need to shut the fuck up when they're talking, right?

[19:51] And so there's only three things that are ever said in a sales call. Do you guys know what they are?

[19:55] There's only three things that ever come out of your mouth. Questions?

[20:00] Restatements? An anecdotal stories, which is the story that I just referenced. The three stories

[20:05] that we will use to break a belief. That's it. So that's how you solve them the vacations. You have

[20:10] these little sound bites, right? I'll give you another example. So if I was doing, um,

[20:14] I was doing food, right? I'm like, listen, uh, three parts of the program, finished,

[20:19] just accountability. So nutrition wise, you've got to eat stuff that's going to make you

[20:25] lose weight. Can we grill that? Yes. Okay. Cool. But the problem is you don't want to do that.

[20:29] Right? That's what we're here. Right? Right? Okay. So let me ask you a question.

[20:33] When, uh, do you feel like, what's your favorite TV show? They're going to be like, uh,

[20:40] whatever game of Thrones. You're like, okay, game of Thrones. Do you feel like you need to get like

[20:43] motivated to watch Game of Thrones? Like, man, I was trying to watch it tonight, but I just couldn't,

[20:48] you know, I just, I got really busy and I just couldn't sit down on the couch and turn the TV on.

[20:51] I couldn't do it, right? Of course not because you look forward to it because you wanted to do it.

[20:56] And the key that we're going to do here is we're going to get you to look forward to the food

[20:59] to treat it because if you look forward to it, you don't need to be motivated because you do it on your

[21:02] own because you like it. So make sense? Right. So what I didn't talk about the macros and the

[21:10] carb cycling and the intermittent fasting and the calorie counting and the blah, blah, blah, blah, because

[21:15] the end of the day that does not matter what they want is for them to solve the problem and have

[21:20] it be pain free. Right. And that's what we're explaining to them. So that's selling the vacation.

[21:24] And this is a saying that I've used for a long time, which is sellification, not the plane for it. Right.

[21:28] And so this is whatever one else talks about. They're like, sir, for us to get to these results,

[21:32] you're going to have to take your pants off. You're going to have to jump through this loop.

[21:35] You're going to have to go through the TSA, the airport lines pack your suitcases, take your shoes off,

[21:39] do the layovers, connect your flights. Have a person farting next to you. Don't worry. They don't

[21:43] have COVID. You'll have turbines probably on the plane. Then as soon as you're out, you think you're

[21:47] done, you stop the way to baggage them. They probably lost your bag. Right. And in our world,

[21:51] it's your modules, your meal plan, your macros, your workouts, your support team. Your URLs, your domains,

[21:54] your funnels, your targeting, your ads, and the other shit that doesn't matter. Right. But instead,

[21:59] but they want, you sell Maui, final destination. And you always sell the same thing because the

[22:04] difference is only the level of service that how they want to get there. Right. If you have multiple

[22:08] levels of service. So do they want to swim to Maui to where they're trying to go? There's sharks

[22:12] and you can drown. We're get robbed. Right. Like this chick. Crazy. Do they want to take a boat to Maui?

[22:18] They'll take a little longer. There's no shark attacks, but there's still no Wi-Fi and you're kind of

[22:22] in the sun. Do you want to take a normal flight to Maui? Get there a little faster. Still smells

[22:27] bad, has security bad food, but you're going to get there. Or do you want to take a private jets

[22:30] Maui? Right. Direct, not stop shipping the plane suitcases packed when you arrive. Right.

[22:35] And so that's the selling piece. E is explaining way of their concerns. And so these are the

[22:41] questions that sound like. So I'm sure Mike has already taught you a lot of the the

[22:45] obstacle overcome concepts. Right. So fundamentally there's there's three big ones. Right. Price.

[22:51] And rather than teach you like the drilling of the obstacles, I told you there's two things

[22:56] you need to memorize. One of them are the stories. The second are the obstacle overcomes.

[23:00] Right. Because those are the things that you're in the red zone. Like that's not where you start

[23:03] thinking about what you're going to say. Right. So the two things that you need to memorize as a salesperson

[23:08] are the stories about what you sell and the obstacles that you're going to encounter when you're in the

[23:14] red zone. The questions on the front end, you need to know the milestones you need to hit in order to

[23:19] move forward. And this is one of the big mistakes I'm sure Mike talks about a lot, which is,

[23:24] you need to sit in the pain. If someone does not clarify why they need a solution, you do not ask

[23:29] for the sale. If they're, if we just say, hey, you know what, we're brought to you here today.

[23:34] I just want to find out more information. Okay, cool. So, you know, let me tell you about the

[23:38] program. Like, that's not, we didn't get the fuck it. Like, we don't know why they're there. We don't

[23:41] know what their goals are. Like, one of the things that drives me nuts about my team sometimes is I'm like,

[23:45] dude, we're eight minutes in the conversation. I was like, I don't know how many clients they have.

[23:48] I don't know what the revenue is. I don't know what their profit is. I don't know what their biggest

[23:51] pain is. I'm like, what are you doing? I'm like, you just told them they're like, oh,

[23:55] Jim wants to put it on their car company. I'm like, they don't give a shit. But they do.

[24:00] My sales guys, because they get through you guys puffed up. Right. But has nothing to do with the

[24:04] prospect. They do not care. Right. They only care about them. So, right. Yeah. That's the issue.

[24:11] Right. Everyone talks, we're talking much about the product. And so when you're training sales

[24:14] people, you don't train them on the product. You train them on the prospect. The product doesn't matter.

[24:23] I mean, it matters. Obviously, from like, how you're going to make money, because you have to do a

[24:26] good job, because I'm going to get that in the second point. But in terms of when you are selling and

[24:30] training someone, if you guys know someone or no specific niche really well, then you will know their

[24:37] pains. And if you have a new sales person, you hear them say shit and you're like, that's not what

[24:41] he thinks what he's doing. He might know the product perfectly. But he just said that the guy's

[24:45] problem was not the problem. And so then it doesn't matter what the product is, because he doesn't

[24:49] feel like it's for him, even though it's totally for him. But you just miss articulated the problem.

[24:54] That's where the clarity has to happen. If you nail that, the rest of the pitch is easy.

[24:58] All right. And so the key here is relying on past agreements that have already been made. So this

[25:03] person with their partner, with their spouse, with their best, you know, whatever has that person

[25:09] knows that there's a problem. And they also don't approve of that problem. And so why would they be

[25:14] in any way against remedying a problem that they already don't approve of? Right? And then finally,

[25:19] we always tack on. Sometimes it's better as for forgiveness than permission, right? Ha ha ha. It

[25:22] depends on the ticket sale, right? But you can get those in, right? And then obviously last last

[25:28] case here is you just do a delayed close and say, let's get your card down. We could put it down

[25:31] payment. We could pay the rest on Friday. And if between now and then, you know, your partner comes back

[25:35] and says, no, man, I want to be poor. I want to keep struggling. And like, I want to never make money

[25:40] and like continue to do this for the rest of our lives. And I'll absolutely tear up the contract

[25:43] or worry about it, right? Finally, you've got stalls, right? I need to think about it. So these are

[25:52] because people don't people are afraid of making mistakes, right? People are afraid of making mistakes.

[25:58] And because of that, they don't like making decisions because it's easier to let life make the

[26:03] decision for you. And so they like doing it that way because then they feel like it's not their fault,

[26:08] right? And so, I mean, a great obstacle over for this is what you're making concern, which is usually

[26:13] my number one thing I go to and someone's like, I need to think about it. It's like totally what

[26:16] I mean, concern, right? Let's think about it together, right? And so fundamentally, these are the

[26:21] things that they need to know. Do you feel like what we're doing can meet your needs and solve the

[26:25] problem? Yes or no? Yes. Do you want to work with us as a company? Do you like our values? Do you

[26:31] like what we stand for? Do you believe we believe about the world? Yes. Do you have access to funds

[26:36] or no someone who does? Yes? Well, then let's rock and roll because those are the only thing we know

[26:42] to meet the big decision, right? Do you like the product? Do you like us? And do you have the money

[26:46] to do it? That's it. Simple as that, right? And so when we walk through those, if you encounter these

[26:52] situations, obviously there's, you know, if you're going to do it now sooner or later, you might

[26:55] say, like there's plenty of things to say, but I think it's more important on showing the theory

[27:00] behind why someone has this objection, right? They have an objection around price because they don't

[27:05] see the value because you didn't articulate it. They have an objection around decision maker,

[27:08] usually because you fuck something up earlier in the sale, but at this point you're in the

[27:11] red zone so you got to deal with it. So you rely on past agreements. If they come with a stall,

[27:16] then you help them confront a decision and make a logical choice and teach them how to make a decision

[27:20] that in that moment and say, what are you most afraid of? Happening. I'm afraid of you just

[27:26] you're afraid of me taking the money, right? Just taking your money and you getting nothing, right?

[27:29] Again, well, let me tell you how that's not going to happen, right? You can bring the concerns.

[27:33] All right? And then finally they say, yes, and you're like awesome, and this is where if you're selling

[27:37] for someone else, get them to send a personalized video like, hey, Johnny, saw you just signed up with

[27:41] us today. Super pumped to have you. You're going to be meeting with Heather tomorrow, should you

[27:45] get you kicked off? You should in the mail get a special gift so keep a lookout for that and then

[27:51] send a handwritten card. If someone just bought a really expensive thing, people are making their

[27:55] decision about whether they believe in you as a company within the first 48 hours after the sale.

[28:00] They make a decision of whether or not they're going to be with you in the long term.

[28:03] And how they're treated in the first 48 hours after they give you money. So it's critical.

[28:08] And it's usually in that point that people fuck up and just ignore them. Framework two. And

[28:13] you know, Mike, I can stop. I'll just do framework two and then we can do the Q and A because if I don't

[28:17] have time to scale the sales seems like I can hit on the points later. So this is a big one for

[28:21] everyone who is who's newer to sales. All right? If you believe you can outperform this season sales

[28:28] or by learning control your tone, right? And so I reworked all of our scripts into the closer framework

[28:33] and the thing is is immediately some people were crushing it, right? While others were still not

[28:37] selling shit and I was like, what the fuck, right? And so I talked to my friends and they were like

[28:41] do you should read this book by Jordan Buffert. And the biggest thing that I got to the book was just

[28:46] he was very specific about tonality. And that was a big shift for me in just learning to teach how to

[28:53] ask the question, not just asking the question, right? And so in the book he talks about having

[29:00] the same issue that I had with scaling sales is like I give the script to two guys,

[29:03] some guy crushes, some guy doesn't, I'm like, what the fuck, right? And the thing is there's the hidden

[29:07] dialogue that the sales team does not know that they are talking it, right? And so the words are not

[29:13] going to be enough. All right? They're just literally 10%. So the words that you have, it might be

[29:17] the most test description of the world. It's still only 10%. 90% is how you say the words, right?

[29:24] Because how you say what you say is tonality. Like right now I could give everyone here's,

[29:30] you know Jerry Seinfeld stand up script. You could read it. It wouldn't be funny, right? Because

[29:35] it's not just that you had the script, it's how you deliver it, right? And that takes time to develop,

[29:40] right? And that's kind of unconscious mastery. And so there's two ways to do this, all right,

[29:44] that I have found. You can either trick yourself into it or you can train yourself to do it,

[29:49] right? And since we don't have enough time to train on the influence of tonality,

[29:54] here's the trick that I teach, right? Conviction will correct your tone. Conviction made real.

[30:01] So let me tell you this story. So I was, I was brought in to do a day of consulting with

[30:07] this mortgage leads company to train their sales team. And the first half of the day,

[30:11] I reworked the whole script, I put the closure framework made in a question-based sale. And then

[30:16] I came in and they were expecting me to like rain, you know, fire and brimstone of these guys.

[30:20] And so I sat down and I was like, who's the guy I have in this trouble? This is the sky

[30:23] John. So I was like John. And they were selling leads. I was like John. How good are the leads?

[30:29] He was like, well, you know, and I was like, we're good. Thanks. And I was like,

[30:34] let me show you how you would answer it if you actually believe the leads were good. I was like,

[30:38] you'd say like, do these leads are fucking unbelievable. Right now, I'm studying from my real estate

[30:41] exam. So I can get it on these leads. My aunt is real sir and she has more business to do

[30:45] you can handle and I'm sending her traffic. I'm trying to get my brother to do it with me. I'm

[30:49] not sure how long I'm going to work or because these leads are killing it for us. Right?

[30:55] If you believe in the product, you don't need to have all the sales skills. You'll do it the right

[31:01] way because you'll actually want to help the person. So that's why the most important part of the

[31:05] sale is the product because unless you're a malicious person, like most people here, it was

[31:12] ever here have some level of ethics on some level. Like, no, it was just like, take someone's last

[31:16] dollar. Right. So then the only way to sell hard because if you're going to close, you're got a

[31:22] so hard. The only way to sell hard is to believe through and through bossed bones when you look

[31:26] here, self in the mirror tonight. This is what I talked about when Mike said at the very beginning,

[31:29] like what happens with people starting hating on you? The only way that I'm being able to stay

[31:33] where we're at in the gym industry, if Mike knows the amount of hate that I get. Right? The only

[31:37] we went to do that is that I read the testimonials, the thousand of them that I have, of gyms who have

[31:44] gone to six figures, of the hundred gyms we've taken to seven figures. Right? Like I know,

[31:50] be honest out of it out, that our product works. I also know that if you sign up for a gym,

[31:54] not everyone will lose his weight and I'm willing to deal with that. I'm willing to give everyone

[32:00] the opportunity to change their life. So here's the tactic around this.

[32:04] Re-retest testimonials out loud daily in front of your sales team. All right? And if the business

[32:10] at your working for does an F testimonials find another business. All right? I'm serious. You're not

[32:14] going to be able to close unless you're like literally unless you're an ethical you're not going to

[32:17] be able to close. So go find something that is a good product because there's plenty of them out there.

[32:22] All right? Find a good product that you believe in. You just see tons of testimonials and then

[32:26] read those every day in front of the team. All right? Second, well, this is for the business owners,

[32:31] but fix everything you possibly can about the product. All right? And never blame a customer for

[32:36] lack of success. So as much as there are people who have not been successful who've used gym lunch,

[32:42] I still take the fact that they were not successful. I think what could I have done that would have

[32:46] made the next person like them successful and you plug the hole? Right? If you do that over and over and

[32:52] over and over again, you know, truly at the end of the day when you look at yourself in the mirror,

[32:56] when no one else is watching, whether or not you truly put the effort for it that merits the price

[33:01] that you were charging. Right? And only you can know that. And the thing is is like the reason sales

[33:06] people get beat up is because they don't put the work in and then it grates on their soul.

[33:11] And then eventually they burn out. They burn out not because they can't handle no, but because they

[33:14] can't handle how they feel about themselves. Right? And so you have to put the work in to have the

[33:20] conviction because that's what's going to get you through it. If you've ever met someone who's a

[33:24] board again Christian, all right? They're convicted. They do not care how many people tell them to

[33:31] shove it because they are trying to save people's souls. It's real. Like if you let that hit you,

[33:38] it's real. You don't even mean. And if you can be a disciple of whatever the product that you have

[33:44] in evangelists in the truest terms, then all the scripting stuff it won't matter. Why are some

[33:50] the best salespeople clients who had success because they believe in it? That's it. And the most

[33:54] convicted person will always win the fight. Right? They'll always lead the dance because they have

[34:01] conviction in their skepticism, UF conviction in your product. And one of you is going to win out.

[34:06] Right? And it's the question is who's belief is stronger? Because belief isn't binary. It's not

[34:10] do I believe or do I not believe? It's how much do I believe? To what extent do I believe? What I

[34:14] bet a thousand dollars on this product or about ten thousand dollars on this product? What I sell

[34:18] my mother this product? Think about it. If you would sell your mother this product, how convicted are

[34:25] you? Probably very. And you will have no problem closing deals. And notice that I have a lower

[34:31] tone right now so that you listen to the words that I'm saying so that you think that they're important.

[34:36] In terms of the training schedule, 60 minutes a day, five days a week. My guys do world class

[34:41] sales training. They text me in the morning before they wake up. They text me once they're done.

[34:45] They do the first 25 minutes. They read the script out loud. Five minutes. They drill obstacles.

[34:50] I need to think about it. I need to talk to my partner. This is expensive. And then they

[34:54] talk they they drill the second half. Right? As a closure you got to talk you got to listen. You got to

[34:58] train both skills. Right? The talking's the tone and saying the words the right way and the right

[35:02] sequence without having to think about it. The listening is going over according and figure out what

[35:06] went right? What we're at wrong and what we're going to do next time and saying it drilling it as a

[35:11] team marking it and moving to the next one. That's the short answer. I appreciate that and I love

[35:17] the conviction by the way. I can tell that this is a script that I think and you're just going like

[35:21] your full heart out there. I'm on Instagram at Paparmozy. My YouTube is Alex Ramozy by podcast

[35:28] if you just type it, Alex Ramozy. I've got a book. I've got a book called Alex and Pat Paukes at book.com.

[35:38] It has 35 pages of obstacle overcomes in the appendix for each one of those obstacles. If you

[35:43] guys want to go grab that, there's I think there's a sales trading there for like a hundred bucks

[35:47] to if you want to grab it you can grab it. It's very good. I do have it because I know it's so good

[35:52] people buy her shit so it's worth the money. Alex thank you. Thank you.

[36:07] you

[00:00] Rihanna is worth $1.7 billion, but the majority of that money is not from music.

[00:05] It's from this.

[00:07] And it's because of her companies.

[00:09] And so today I'm going to analyze Rihanna's laundry company Savage X-Ventee.

[00:13] And money is our promotion.

[00:14] I invest in companies.

[00:15] I own acquisition.com, which is portfolio that makes unreasonable about some money.

[00:18] So be very, very impressed.

[00:19] And at the very end, I'm going to be wearing all of this.

[00:22] And so there's five things that her companies specifically Savage X-Ventee does different

[00:26] that I think any business owner can model independent of whether or not you're a celebrity.

[00:30] And if you watch nothing else about this video, make sure to stay for the breakdown of her

[00:35] actual membership offer.

[00:36] She's like nine different bonuses that she figured out how to combine to make what would otherwise

[00:42] not be a recurring product into a reoccurring purchase that I thought was really clever

[00:46] that I think every business owner who's sell stuff, even on any kind of subscription, can use.

[00:51] So helping me out today will be my lovely assistant, Savage X-Ventee.

[00:55] And let's pull up Rhiana's website.

[00:57] Okay, so here we are.

[00:58] So Rhiana looks great.

[01:00] This is awesome.

[01:01] And she's obviously selling tons of product through this site.

[01:04] But the real question is how could she go from zero to global distribution overnight when

[01:10] she has no experience in manufacturing, no experience in brick and mortar distribution,

[01:14] and arguably probably not that much experience even in online shopping.

[01:17] And so she did five things that I want to dial in on.

[01:20] So the first thing she did was she partnered for her deficiencies.

[01:23] And so she has three core deficiencies around this business.

[01:26] So the first one is going to be distribution, but I mean physical distribution.

[01:30] She already has the media distribution.

[01:31] She already has the brand.

[01:32] So she has the eyeballs, but how does she get the stuff?

[01:36] How does she get the stuff into people's hands, right?

[01:39] The second is how do we create the stuff?

[01:42] How do we actually do the manufacturing?

[01:44] And then thirdly, the internet sales side is also a completely different game for a making music

[01:50] or social media or even to a degree design.

[01:53] Because I would argue that she probably has a much stronger hand in the design of the products

[01:57] which we'll get to in a minute.

[01:58] The first is that she partnered with someone with an existing distribution base,

[02:02] LVMH.

[02:03] And so if you don't know what LVMH is, LVMH is the holding company of Bernard Arno,

[02:08] who is one of the top, but ever 15 wealthiest people in the world is a sentimentally inner.

[02:12] So if you haven't heard of LVMH, you've certainly heard of their companies.

[02:14] Like Christian Deor, Lou Vuitton, Giovanni, Hennessy, and Tiffany Inco.

[02:19] And they own a ton more beyond that.

[02:21] So the first thing she did was she partnered for her deficiency.

[02:25] Now, what does LVMH bring to the table that she could not otherwise have done on her own?

[02:30] Now to be clear, I'm not saying that Reon doesn't have the ability to do this.

[02:33] It's just that she would have to learn a ton of skills.

[02:35] That's probably not quarter what she's really good at.

[02:37] Right?

[02:38] And so what things did LVMH bring to the table?

[02:41] So first and foremost, they have distribution.

[02:45] So as much as she has the media distribution, that's a you.

[02:49] There you go.

[02:50] Maybe I can spot.

[02:52] She has the media distribution.

[02:53] She can get the eyeball.

[02:54] She can get the attention.

[02:55] She is the brand association.

[02:56] She will talk about.

[02:57] But if people want to buy from her, the vast majority of people still buy lingerie in person.

[03:04] And so even though she has an online store where she can drive people to,

[03:08] they have physical retail experience, finding locations, building them out,

[03:13] and basically helping people build a retail model when she has no retail experience.

[03:19] The second thing that they could help her on is manufacturing.

[03:23] It's one thing to make a product, do some drop shipping, connect with some

[03:29] little manufacturer.

[03:31] The thing that happens is the bigger you get, the more difficult supply chain becomes.

[03:36] And the more you need to have partners who can handle that kind of scale and volume.

[03:40] And here's the hard part.

[03:42] Day one.

[03:43] Right?

[03:43] Like it's more common for you to sometimes you partner with someone and they kind of grow with you

[03:48] with their businesses, your business grows.

[03:50] But she's a super mega, a-list celebrity day one.

[03:53] And so she has access to almost like a global audience day one.

[03:57] And so she needs someone with global manufacturing and global distribution day one.

[04:03] And so just puts a numbers on this.

[04:04] They have 118 factories globally.

[04:06] And over 6000 retail stores.

[04:08] So they have the experience.

[04:10] So zooming back out, if you're a business owner, you're like, okay, well, what?

[04:13] I mean, that's great for re-automatic.

[04:14] What can I do with this?

[04:15] Well, number one is distribution is one of those key things that you can make partnerships for.

[04:20] That makes sense.

[04:22] Right?

[04:23] Like for example, when I invested in school, I brought media distribution.

[04:28] Right?

[04:29] I had a lot of people who wanted to start businesses or had businesses in one of the

[04:32] build communities online.

[04:33] And so that was something that I brought to the table.

[04:35] And so building distribution, either retail physical stores.

[04:39] That is something that that's an asset.

[04:41] It makes something very valuable that you can bring to a partnership.

[04:43] For example, again, when we had Jim Lach, which was the company that I started

[04:47] in sold, we had a distribution base of brick and mortar gyms.

[04:50] And so when I started prestige labs,

[04:51] which was our supplement company, I could sell through that brick and mortar distribution base day one.

[04:56] Which is why that company within the first month that it's $1.7 million in sales in the first month of

[05:02] really being in business.

[05:04] And so I bring that up to say that like there are a few things more

[05:08] valuable than building distribution.

[05:11] And so the third one to tie this off is that they had retail and online sales experience.

[05:19] Right?

[05:20] So they know how to build out the online presence for all the brands that have under LVMH.

[05:24] And they are probably have teams upon teams of specialists who know how to run,

[05:28] direct response ads who know how to run, how branding campaigns that have PR specialists that can go.

[05:32] And get her in the right places at the right times, all of that stuff.

[05:36] And so the big takeaway for me and potentially you,

[05:39] and this is something that took me too long to learn,

[05:41] is that I think in the earlier part of my career, I wanted to learn everything.

[05:44] And I think that's very valuable.

[05:46] But at some point, I believe that businesses are limited by the collective brain power.

[05:51] So these are my little brains, there you go,

[05:53] that are inside of an organization.

[05:55] And so if you're the only brain in the organization because you have taught everything you know

[06:01] to every other person, then it means that a business is limited on one person's lifetime.

[06:06] And I don't care how smart you are.

[06:07] I mean, if you're Elon, then you, you know, congratulations here at an alien and have beat everyone.

[06:12] But for us mere mortals, we usually need to get other people and their lifetime of learning

[06:17] and put it all together so that overall we can create a bigger enterprise.

[06:22] And the best people in the world don't do it for free.

[06:26] And to give you some scale here, her laundry brand alone did have our $100 million in sales.

[06:31] Now it's like, how do we know what numbers?

[06:33] They're not super public about the numbers.

[06:35] And so, but I think big picture, we can just say they make lots of money.

[06:38] What can we learn?

[06:39] So number two is she picked a good market.

[06:42] Now, if you've read the book, $100 million offers, I talk about this before I even get into the offer.

[06:48] Because your market is more important than anything else.

[06:51] To give you an extreme example, if you were selling toilet paper during COVID,

[06:54] you didn't need to have an amazing offer.

[06:56] If you just had toilet paper, you had what?

[06:59] A starving crowd.

[07:01] Right? On the flip side, if you were trying to sell marketing services,

[07:04] and you're the best marketing services in the world,

[07:05] you're trying to sell it to newspapers that are paper newspapers.

[07:08] Those things are going down no matter what.

[07:10] Right? And so the first thing that's going to be the biggest lever on the success of the business

[07:14] is who you actually serve to.

[07:16] Now, the vast majority markets are neither of those extremes.

[07:19] They're not dying every day, 25% compounded,

[07:21] any glee in the wrong direction.

[07:23] Or absolute, supply demand,

[07:25] discrepancy between the entire world trying to buy toilet paper.

[07:28] Right? Most markets, I would just consider our normal markets.

[07:31] Now, what she did that was unique, and so I'll put it in here.

[07:34] I'll pull this up from the book.

[07:36] Is that?

[07:37] There are four components to a market that I like.

[07:39] Is that are they in pain?

[07:41] Do they have the purchasing power? Are they easy to target? And are they growing?

[07:44] And so let's run through the market that Rihanna selected

[07:48] for her avatar through this framework.

[07:51] So first and foremost,

[07:54] were they in pain?

[07:55] The answer is yes, and she actually followed a rule that I really love when it comes to product

[08:00] is that you want to have lived with the pain of what you're solving,

[08:03] typically for a long period of time.

[08:05] Now, Rihanna's a, she comes from mixed at this issue.

[08:08] She has mixed parents. She is a very diverse background.

[08:10] And I think as a result of that, she also is a very diverse audience.

[08:13] And so one of the issues that she found is that lingerie and undergarments,

[08:17] the nude colors were not actually matching the vast majority of skin tones.

[08:23] So they had a hint, they had one nude, but it didn't match basically anyone.

[08:26] And so she had a novel idea, which is number one, is that she offered 40 different shades

[08:31] of nude underwear. And so to quote her,

[08:33] she said there needs to be something for a dark skin girl, there needs to be something for a

[08:36] really pair of girl, and there needs to be something in between, right?

[08:39] And so that became the foundation of savage ex-fenties entire business model.

[08:43] And so this then lattered up to their overall brand approach,

[08:46] which is aligned with Rihanna, which was about inclusivity and body positivity.

[08:51] Part of that is because this was a unique carve out from the traditional industry standards.

[08:58] Not to say that those are right wrong, it's just they were different.

[09:01] Right? And the other piece of this is that her personally,

[09:03] we've seen her kind of weight journey over time. And so there's been like thicker Rihanna,

[09:07] then there's been thinner Rihanna. And so in either of some situations,

[09:10] and obviously there's people who are like, I like thick Rihanna, I like to get around whatever.

[09:14] The point is is that she has gone through this experience,

[09:17] she resonates with the pain and her audience knows that it's authentic when she tries to solve that

[09:22] problem. And so the second thing that you want is purchasing power.

[09:25] Now, she had a very difficult decision to make here, right? LVMH is a luxury brand.

[09:30] So this is a, this is a company that's known for selling bags for 5,000, 10,000,

[09:35] 50,000 dollars. And sometimes they don't even put the price on their sites because it's so expensive.

[09:40] And they ship out one or two products, two physical locations, which just to keep the scarcity so high.

[09:45] Now, meanwhile, let's pull up her site. Let's see if we can make sure that we don't get banned

[09:49] from YouTube for soft core. Look at the prices on you. These are super reasonable prices,

[09:55] $5 for G strings. I mean, actually, I'm not really a purchaser of G strings, but I imagine that's

[10:01] not super expensive. $25, 12 for $2, for $30, you know, $5 accessories, $10, $15, $15, $20, $20,

[10:10] $10, $10, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30

[10:40] $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30

[11:10] $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30

[11:40] $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30

[12:10] $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30

[12:40] $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30

[13:40] $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30

[14:10] $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30

[14:40] $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30

[15:10] $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30, $30

[15:40] Underlying thought process here is, what can I do to make my product faster for people?

[15:46] Easier for people, or more risk free.

[15:49] And so these are the vectors of value creation.

[15:53] And I talk about this in the offers book at length.

[15:55] It's probably one of the core concepts within the book, which I refer to as the value equation,

[16:00] which is the dream outcome for them is that they want to look sexy, they want to feel

[16:03] confident, and maybe even relate, maybe just a fraction of how Rihanna feels.

[16:08] It's like, she's cool, she's amazing, she's savaged, she's ferocious, right?

[16:12] I want to feel like a baddie like her.

[16:15] And then, perceived likely to achievement, well, you know what?

[16:17] This actually fits me.

[16:18] It's actually my skin color.

[16:19] This decreases the risk around feeling dumb feeling stupid when you put something on, and

[16:23] it's way too small or whatever.

[16:26] And then time delay and effort and sacrifice, these are the things like, how do we make

[16:29] it easier, so she made the class easier, and then she made them more comfortable.

[16:33] And then time delay, that's going to be more in the logistics of shipping for this type

[16:37] of product compared to maybe a service or something like that.

[16:39] And I'm going to talk about how she hammered the value equation in her membership model,

[16:43] which she did a number of unique things that I think a lot of people could copy, who

[16:47] are watching this right now.

[16:48] Bad girl Rihree made her launch campaign, and she followed the clear textbook whisper

[16:54] T's shout method.

[16:56] And so she did a whisper campaign, which was where she had this kind of mysterious post,

[17:01] right, where she had savage X venti, which was at that time a mysterious account, that

[17:05] she followed, it was the only thing she followed.

[17:07] And then overnight it got all of this press because it was the only thing she followed, and

[17:11] it got all of these followers, virtually overnight, like 17,000 dollars and 24 hours.

[17:14] With zero content on the page, think about what the whisper phase is, right?

[17:18] So it calls, it's like an ad, the key phase here is curiosity, right?

[17:23] And so this is keep the product itself mysterious and hinted how big of a deal it is,

[17:27] but keep Wisters short and bonus points if you can show it behind the scenes.

[17:30] Now this then transitions into where she's going for T's, right?

[17:35] So this is where she then T's is the upcoming launch, and she starts to feel excitement.

[17:40] So people are starting to guess what is this about.

[17:42] Now I think people had a decent idea of what this launch was going to be when she made

[17:47] the T's, right?

[17:49] And so now people like the anticipation begins to build.

[17:51] And then finally, she transitions to the shout phase, which is basically giving people

[17:55] the call to action, yes, it's live, go by it now, savage X venti, and she made it available

[18:00] to her, you know, hundreds of millions of followers across all platforms.

[18:05] And I want to talk about something else that she did really, really well, that I think

[18:08] a lot of us business owners can model.

[18:09] So one of the things that Rehanna does exceptionally well, she makes organic content, right?

[18:13] And one of the key parts is that she makes her organic content contextual to the platform.

[18:19] So if you look here, one of the steps in making content that happens out of the book,

[18:22] underbilling other leads, right, is that like this is, you know, the old LinkedIn Facebook

[18:26] Instagram Tinder meme is that you can't walk into a party.

[18:30] I think Gary Vee has a great analogy.

[18:31] You can't walk into a party dressed in a text C, you know, when you're going to a club,

[18:35] like it looks weird, it's out of place.

[18:37] Even though that text, there's nothing wrong.

[18:38] You look like James Bond, you look great.

[18:40] It might be out of place there.

[18:41] Now nowadays, maybe you'd be, you know, people would think it looks really cool because

[18:44] I think it would look kind of cool.

[18:45] But you get the idea, right?

[18:47] Now, she has a huge following Instagram, huge following TikTok, huge following in YouTube,

[18:52] and she makes the content platform specific.

[18:58] And so there's very little crossover between her Instagram content or TikTok content,

[19:01] her YouTube content or TikTok content, YouTube and Instagram.

[19:04] And so she makes it platform specific.

[19:05] So she's very clever, marketer because she understands how the platforms work and

[19:10] makes platform native content.

[19:11] And so here's more or less how she breaks down.

[19:13] On Instagram, she does a lot more high-fi stuff.

[19:15] It's a lot more aesthetic.

[19:16] And so she'll do more image-based stuff and show share photos and, you know,

[19:21] models kind of showcasing the laundry rack.

[19:23] Now, the only behind the scenes materials probably can just be her stories.

[19:26] All right.

[19:27] Now, TikTok is short from videos, right?

[19:29] And so there, she's showcasing products a little bit more.

[19:32] And she kind of hops on more trending sounds and challenges.

[19:37] And she's a lot more collaborations with other creators and because of TikTok shop,

[19:40] it's easier for her to have direct purchases right on platform.

[19:43] And then finally with YouTube, she's using more long form strategies.

[19:46] She's a more triunld haul, reviews, promotes her VIP membership, which I'll talk about in a second,

[19:51] which I think is one of the more clever things that she's done here that I think a lot of

[19:54] businesses will copy that you can to.

[19:56] And so if you're curious, all of this is branding.

[19:59] All right.

[20:00] So with the exception of her making, you know, direct ass, letting people know about the products

[20:03] that they can buy, if you just demonstrate the use of the product, if you demonstrate expertise,

[20:09] if you're in a B2B or services business, demonstration and a lot of ways makes the association

[20:14] between you and the positive sentiment that you want.

[20:18] And if you do that over and over again, that is what can take a high information buyer.

[20:22] Somebody who needs a lot of information before making a decision, which is the vast majority

[20:25] of the marketplace, and then convert them into a customer.

[20:27] Now number four, the next thing she did is she doubled down on affiliates really hard.

[20:32] And I'm a huge fan of affiliates, Alan, my software company was built entirely off of

[20:37] affiliates, prestige labs, was built off of a distribution base of affiliates of gym owners.

[20:42] And so I'm a huge advocate for affiliates school is 65% affiliate traffic in terms of the

[20:48] percentage of the people who are on school.

[20:50] It's people from school who refer other people to school.

[20:52] And so I'm a huge, huge advocate of this because fundamentally, affiliates compound.

[20:56] And they become these permanent nodes of distribution for you.

[20:59] And so obviously there's basically two levels of leverage that she was able to achieve with

[21:02] this business.

[21:03] First, she was able to leverage LVMH's retail distribution base.

[21:06] So that's the physical presence.

[21:08] And then layered on top of that, she was able to leverage the aggregated following of many

[21:14] mega stars.

[21:15] And what I think is really unique about her affiliate strategy is that you'll notice the

[21:18] different looking feel of the affiliates on name them in a second.

[21:22] But like they represent different beauty ideals.

[21:24] And so I think they were very deliberate about who they chose.

[21:26] So they have people like the Heads, his, their G.G. and Bella Hadid.

[21:29] They had Emily, a Rattitch, Kowskian, or how to say her name.

[21:32] But very pretty lady.

[21:34] But different look, they had Normani.

[21:36] Right?

[21:37] Again, different look, Lizza, different body type.

[21:39] Right?

[21:40] Vanessa Hudgens, Cindy Crawford, Demi Moore.

[21:41] And so lots of different looking feels off to attract a wider audience.

[21:47] And I think the common theme between all of those is that they're considered beautiful.

[21:51] This is something that's actually taking me a long time to learn.

[21:53] Is that the affiliates that you choose have a huge influence in the reason that I

[21:58] brought this on the same page is a huge influence on your brand.

[22:03] It's a bi-directional relationship.

[22:05] Your brand influences who's attracted to the brand who wants to affiliate it.

[22:08] And then those affiliates then reinforce the brand itself of what are we about?

[22:12] Right?

[22:13] What are the associations people make with our products and services and the things they

[22:16] know like and trust?

[22:17] All right?

[22:18] She followed the affiliate playbook, says chapter inside of $100 million leads to a T.

[22:23] So she found her ideal affiliates.

[22:24] We just covered that.

[22:25] Now, she made them an offer.

[22:27] Now, some of them is sponsorship, some of them to get a sponsorship and a percentage

[22:31] of revenue.

[22:32] I would imagine that for the vast majority of these types of deals, they're probably almost

[22:35] all just cash sponsorships.

[22:36] Like they make a certain amount of posts every year where they're reping it and they're

[22:40] wearing it.

[22:41] And I think at this level, I would hope the vast majority of them, it was on brand

[22:45] for them as personal influencers to make the association with Rihanna and LVMH.

[22:50] Because LVMH has an amazing brand too.

[22:53] Now, obviously, the qualification they were already superstars.

[22:55] We already covered how to pay them, get them to advertise that's what posting

[22:59] cadence, what things we want them to wear.

[23:01] And so we have to think about the value equation also for affiliates.

[23:05] And I think this is one of the most misunderstood part.

[23:07] People think they're like, oh, I'm going to have an affiliate partner.

[23:08] People just automatically promote my stuff.

[23:10] They just basically never happens.

[23:12] Affiliates basically become another tier of customer for you.

[23:14] And you have to make it offer so good that Phil stupid's saying no, just like you

[23:18] would for a customer.

[23:19] And so it's like, how do I make it easier for them?

[23:21] So she said, then Banner's links, promotional materials so that it kind of made it turn

[23:25] key for them.

[23:26] So they didn't have to take a lot of time to think about how they're going to promote it.

[23:30] And she could actually make sure that their promotions were still on brand.

[23:34] And so to reinforce her affiliates positions as premier, right, in terms of aspirational.

[23:41] Savage XFenty has a fashion show that actually won an Emmy that was on Amazon Prime.

[23:45] And she invited some of those make it influencers to come and join her to kind of rep it.

[23:50] And so this is brand creative.

[23:51] It's brand additive to them.

[23:53] So this is like the perfect brand deal is one where both parties benefit from one another.

[24:00] And both brands go stronger and have more positive sentiment across a wider distribution

[24:05] base than they did prior to the deal.

[24:07] Because then there's zero cost to the deal.

[24:09] There's added financial value.

[24:11] But there's also increased goodwill and distribution.

[24:14] Right, like that's those are the good types of deals.

[24:16] And fundamentally, I think that's what she was able to achieve.

[24:19] So I'm going to flash up some stats.

[24:21] So Instagram actually did a breakdown of this campaign of how they were advertising across

[24:26] social media.

[24:28] And rather than read you all these stats, I'm going to give you the bottom line, which

[24:32] is that most direct response marketers, it takes everybody a different amount of time to

[24:36] figure this out.

[24:37] But let's say this is the world of potential buyers that you have.

[24:42] Well about this many of them are ready to buy today.

[24:46] So this is the classic if you've ever heard this step forward.

[24:48] 97% of people are not ready to buy today and 3% are.

[24:53] And so most direct response marketers are off fighting, making better and better offers to

[24:59] this tiny little dot.

[25:01] But the clever marketers who understand the longer game is that this 97% you move along

[25:07] the continuum to hear through brand awareness, through brand education and positive associations.

[25:15] And so there's no mistake that they did a lot of top of awareness, a lot of associations,

[25:20] a lot of narrative, a lot of aesthetic, storytelling, caring associations that they deemed

[25:26] quality to their demographics, so that when they did make an offer to them, they had

[25:31] moved them along this continuum into their now much larger bucket that everyone else has

[25:36] a 3% bucket they're competing for.

[25:37] And maybe they're at a 15% bucket.

[25:39] That's 5 times 3.

[25:40] That looks like a 3.

[25:41] That's 5.

[25:43] There's a fundamentally this is how brands always beat businesses that are purely direct

[25:49] response.

[25:50] You look at the biggest companies in the world.

[25:51] They're not, they're not arbitrage businesses.

[25:54] They're not like, oh, I can buy a click for a penny and I can sell it for two.

[25:57] The thing is is that brand advertising outperforms direct response advertising every time,

[26:04] as long as you know what you're doing, caveat on a long enough time resin.

[26:08] And so in 30 days, direct response will probably be branding.

[26:13] But on a year, branding will smash it.

[26:15] And that's where you get those 20x50x, sometimes 100x returns on advertising dollars.

[26:20] It happens when you grow the pie and then no one else can compete against you because all

[26:25] of this extra that we grew with the brand awareness is only extra for you.

[26:30] And everyone else is still competing for this little dot and you don't even need to advertise

[26:33] that little dot because you've got this massive pie right here that you grew organically

[26:38] with goodwill, with positive sense of it.

[26:40] By the way, the reason I make these videos, this is all branding.

[26:43] All point here is that hopefully you can learn some nugget that you can apply to your

[26:46] business and then as a result, make more money and associate that make you more money with

[26:50] me.

[26:51] And she did this growing of the pie overnight over 20 years, right, of having more platinum

[26:58] heads than almost any any musician today and maintaining a very kind of cool, bad girl

[27:06] Brent, I ranked these in order of what I would deem important.

[27:10] Stayer like, how could distribution from LVMA to partnership be more important?

[27:14] Well, if she didn't have them, she wouldn't have a business.

[27:16] Right?

[27:17] She wouldn't be able to manufacture products.

[27:18] She wouldn't be able to keep up with the demand.

[27:19] She wouldn't have the brick and mortar distribution that she has.

[27:21] She wouldn't even have the, it's really the brand association of premium luxury goods.

[27:24] All of those things are massively beneficial.

[27:26] Right.

[27:27] The second thing is that she picked the right market.

[27:28] If she picked the wrong market to begin with, for example, I think if she had gone luxury,

[27:32] I think that would have been really bad.

[27:34] I think people would have been like, she's being ridiculous.

[27:36] She's so greedy.

[27:37] She's what's which is hilarious that she's so greedy.

[27:40] Really, she just made more money doing it this way.

[27:42] Just because she was being smart, it would have just been a bad move, given her brand.

[27:46] Now, for example, like we do, she huge, you know, very big deals in terms of what we do.

[27:50] So it makes sense for anything that I would eventually sell to be expensive, right?

[27:54] It makes sense.

[27:55] So second, like I said, if you don't have a good market that you're going after,

[27:59] it's going to fall in flight years.

[28:01] If she had done a big luxury move and gone like 5,000, 10,000 or something, I think it would have been a disaster.

[28:07] Right.

[28:08] So she picked the right market and she was clever about the fact that not only did she go after lunch, right?

[28:11] She also entered into athletic stuff, right?

[28:14] Well, this is loungewear.

[28:15] But the idea is that those are growing at disproportionate faster than population growth in GDP growth.

[28:20] She's going into growing markets.

[28:21] If she's going to shrinking, she wouldn't have sold anything being with.

[28:24] Third, then when you have the growing market, you have the distribution, brand allows you to capitalize on it.

[28:29] It allows you to get people to switch from what they're currently buying to your thing because

[28:33] they have brand affinity because of the 20 years of goodwill that she's built up from the music that people associate with going out,

[28:38] from having fun, from just relaxing from in their drives.

[28:41] All of that positive sentiment built up over years then gets monetized flipped when she starts presenting real products.

[28:48] Now, once she has that, then it's like, how do I get leverage on that?

[28:51] Because if she had just done that, she would have made plenty of money.

[28:53] But how do I get more leverage?

[28:54] Fourth, she brings in the affiliates.

[28:56] Now, she gets even more leverage on the distribution in terms of media by also getting more inclusion because of different skin types,

[29:03] color types, beauty aesthetics, beauty ideals so she can capture a wider percentage of the marketplace.

[29:08] And then finally, number five, now we talk about the offer.

[29:11] Right?

[29:12] And so this is in order of importance.

[29:15] All right.

[29:16] So she had what I would consider a grand slam membership offer because she could have had a just generic offer,

[29:21] and I think it probably would have done fine.

[29:23] But she did a couple of unique things that I think are really worth dialing in on.

[29:27] Now, there were some technical components that were prior to do this,

[29:30] and she did get a little bit of dings from regulators,

[29:34] but I will talk about that briefly.

[29:36] So let's look at the core components of her membership.

[29:40] And so there's kind of three core components here.

[29:42] One is, so remember the great slam offer, right?

[29:44] So you want something that's going to be easy.

[29:46] You want it to be fast.

[29:48] You want it to be low risk.

[29:50] All right?

[29:50] And then you want to have the dream outcome.

[29:52] All right?

[29:53] And so each of these elements of value are actually woven into this membership.

[29:56] So it's not just a normal membership where you just, you know, like a box subscription, right?

[30:01] You pay 50 bucks a month and then you get a box of stuff every month.

[30:04] That I think would have not done very well.

[30:07] And probably would have had a tremendous amount of charge.

[30:08] Now, the amount of members they have on this, the sources are kind of varied.

[30:12] My guess is she's probably got over a million people on this thing.

[30:14] Making it easy, easy and fast to join.

[30:17] So they do it right at checkout.

[30:19] That's not necessarily unique.

[30:20] But what I think they did make that unique is that anybody who buys basically buys

[30:27] into not only a discount club.

[30:29] So you save money immediately by joining the club.

[30:31] So thing one.

[30:32] So let's just, let's outline these things.

[30:35] So she gives a discount for being the membership.

[30:38] Is this unique?

[30:39] Not really.

[30:40] There's plenty of discount membership that exist.

[30:42] Now, number two, getting a little bit more unique.

[30:46] She also includes VIP benefits that are media related.

[30:50] So she provides behind the scenes fashion shows, access, exclusive content that she has

[30:57] inside of an app, her VIP extra app.

[31:01] Where she shows the stuff so people feel more connected to the movement that she's trying

[31:05] to build with Savage X-Fenty, really clever.

[31:08] So this is a brilliant kind of combination of the physical products world and the digital

[31:11] community world, which is something that I'm all in on when it comes to school, right?

[31:16] School that one of the big reasons I made the investment is because there's so many businesses

[31:18] that benefit from it.

[31:19] Like, if you're any commerce business, you should have a community for all of your customers

[31:23] to be in because guess what happens there.

[31:25] They buy more often, they refer more friends, they give you feedback on the products so that

[31:28] you have more insight and intel so that you know what your next product should be or how

[31:32] to make two point no versions of it to make them even better.

[31:34] All of that stuff.

[31:35] And the nice thing is you can offer it for free, right?

[31:38] And the crazy thing is, you'd pay for the intel that you get from a community.

[31:41] But here, you're going to just convert more people into it.

[31:44] So it's awesome.

[31:45] All right.

[31:46] Now, here's one of the most clever things she did.

[31:50] I think it was, I think this is the best part of this membership is it's skipable.

[31:56] All right.

[31:57] So what does that mean?

[31:58] So remember, I said, you have to have easy, fast, low risk.

[32:02] Now, the low risk has multiple components to this.

[32:04] So one risk is that I don't get something that I want, right?

[32:07] That's a big risk.

[32:09] And that has two components.

[32:10] One is paying for something that I don't want or that there's just nothing available

[32:13] that I don't want.

[32:15] She handles the first one with having the different colors, the different designs.

[32:18] So that one's kind of handled.

[32:19] But in terms of, okay, what's in my box that I get every month?

[32:22] Well, what they do is they actually personalize the recommendations per person, person,

[32:28] monthly.

[32:29] All right.

[32:30] So these are all personalized based on your shopping behavior.

[32:32] So once you make your first purchase and you join the community, join the membership,

[32:36] they think tailor the recommendations for the box for you every month based on those

[32:41] past purchases.

[32:42] All right.

[32:43] So this makes it more likely lower risk that you're going to get what you actually

[32:46] want.

[32:47] Maybe that you see this box of stuff and you're like, well, I don't want any of this

[32:50] stuff.

[32:51] Well, she made it skipable.

[32:53] And so think about it like this.

[32:54] For the first four days of every month, they say, hey, here's the stuff that you can buy.

[32:57] Here's the stuff that's catered to you.

[32:59] And you can say, you know what?

[33:00] I don't want it this month.

[33:02] And it just skips the billing.

[33:03] And so you actually just get basically the opportunity to get stuff at a cheaper price.

[33:08] And you don't have to even pay to do it.

[33:10] You just stay in it.

[33:11] And so it's almost like being locked into a free in some ways, membership.

[33:15] And then when you choose to buy something, and if you assume you would be buying stuff

[33:18] anyways, which is what this kind of capitalizes on, then the months that you want to buy

[33:22] something, you can't.

[33:23] And with the credit, and so this is here's E, it's based on a credit system.

[33:30] So when you actually buy the subscription doesn't necessarily send you something in the box,

[33:35] they give you a credit that you can then redeem and pick and choose the pieces that you

[33:38] want, which also means that let's say you get a $60 credit, which is the price point

[33:42] that she has.

[33:43] And if you want to buy a $75 thing, you just pay 15 bucks at checkout.

[33:47] And worst case scenario, let's say that you don't want to buy anything that month.

[33:51] Well, next month, you're going to have 60 plus 60, so you have a $120 that you can spend.

[33:56] And so in some ways, it almost acts as layaway for some people to almost be like a savings

[33:59] program where they can save up for a special occasion and then splurge with the discount

[34:04] that's already locked in.

[34:06] And so I think this combination of skippable and personalized plus the credit, I think this

[34:12] is a really, really compelling combination that has led to the success of the membership offer.

[34:17] These are the big ones, but let's talk about other risk things.

[34:20] Well, one, they have a 90-day fit guarantee.

[34:23] So that gives, so again, risk, it decreases risk even further.

[34:26] So you're like, okay, well, I want to pay less and have more time to return stuff.

[34:30] That makes sense.

[34:31] They also get early access.

[34:33] So that's closer to the approximated dream outcome.

[34:36] If we're talking about the four values.

[34:38] So like, okay, now I get to see this stuff earlier.

[34:40] You also get a free annual gift.

[34:41] So that's more bonuses during your birthday month.

[34:44] Right when people are at the height of their emotional peak of like wanting to feel special,

[34:48] they make them feel special and they associate that feeling with the brand.

[34:52] Brilliant move.

[34:53] All right.

[34:54] On top of that, they are free shipping on all $59 plus orders, meaning anybody who

[34:58] redeems their credit gets free shipping on every day by.

[35:01] So this encourages more people to, of course, use the membership.

[35:05] And they get up to 25% off.

[35:06] So it's pretty significant discounts and that's your round.

[35:09] Again, they get 50% discounts on skin, which is a different company overall.

[35:12] That's when you start being able to cross pollinate with different different companies,

[35:15] which is just a brilliant move in her part.

[35:16] So look at all these benefits.

[35:18] This is what you might consider a bonus stack if you will.

[35:21] Just done an official product space.

[35:23] And on top of that, if you, about wait, there's more.

[35:27] Right?

[35:28] She also has a free underwear pick or bra after every fifth billing.

[35:31] Now why do you think they did it after every fifth billing?

[35:35] Because they probably know where their average turn is.

[35:37] So they probably have delayed a bonus, pass the average turn point to give someone

[35:41] immediate reward for staying longer.

[35:45] And so then they summarize this on one place, which makes it a super grand slam offer,

[35:50] which is why I wanted to make this video.

[35:51] Because the amount of people were like, man, I read the offers book and I just don't know

[35:55] how I can apply to any commerce business.

[35:58] This is how you apply to any commerce business.

[36:01] Right?

[36:02] And of course, they make canceling easy.

[36:04] So you can go there, you can call them.

[36:06] And you can cancel obviously online.

[36:09] And so the core membership offer she presents is 59, 95 a month and it's credit based.

[36:15] And so now let's lock into what are the specific extra bonuses that she does to make this

[36:20] a grand slam offer, not just a traditional membership.

[36:23] So if you're wondering, okay, well beyond the first purchase, how are she getting these personalizations?

[36:28] A brilliant lead magnet.

[36:29] So if you don't know what a lead magnet is, I covered in the book, I'm gonna play our leads.

[36:32] And so if you want to get more traffic to convert, give them something very valuable for free.

[36:38] Now the point here is that let's say that you just said, hey, go buy my thing.

[36:42] Versus, hey, try a free thing.

[36:45] And then once they get by from the free thing, then asking the people got the value to then

[36:48] buy the thing, you will get way more people to ultimately buy.

[36:51] And so this is kind of a little visual that I have to explain the difference.

[36:55] Like you might have a hundred people that you talk to you and get one sale versus low trust

[36:58] turning them into a high trust audience and then getting three times the sales.

[37:01] And then just super common.

[37:03] And so there's different types of lead magnets.

[37:06] Now for hers, she's using type number one, which is revealing a problem.

[37:10] And so when you reveal a problem is doing it through personalizations, you can watch

[37:13] as we walk through this.

[37:15] And so she's able to personalize recommendations not only based on what they buy, but

[37:20] she can also change the shopping experience based on what people already say they want or

[37:24] like.

[37:25] And so at the end of this personalization, obviously they have to tie it to a contact.

[37:28] So after you go through this, you have some cost bias, right?

[37:31] Consistency and commitment by it.

[37:32] She's already gone through this and you're like, oh, shoot, I might just want to make

[37:34] an account.

[37:35] And she still gives you a cookie for doing it, which is that she gives you a discount code

[37:38] as soon as you sign up for it.

[37:40] And so you can do this in any business.

[37:41] So for example, for acquisition, not for business owners, we have a scaling roadmap.

[37:46] So it gives you a personalized roadmap of whatever stage of scaling your app between zero

[37:50] and 500 employees.

[37:52] And we broke it in a 10 stages across eight functions.

[37:54] So it's like, would you need to do for sales when you're going from 50 to 99 employees?

[37:58] Would you need to do for marketing?

[37:59] What do you need to do for customer success?

[38:00] What do you need to do for product?

[38:01] What do you need for IT?

[38:02] What do you need for recruiting?

[38:02] What do you need to do to find it?

[38:03] What do you need for HR?

[38:04] Right?

[38:05] For each of these functions?

[38:06] What's the problem and what's the solution at each stage?

[38:09] Right?

[38:10] And it's very different going from five to nine employees versus going from 50 to 100.

[38:15] Right?

[38:16] So you want to be as personalized in your deliveries as possible.

[38:20] And so if you want to check our version at you can go to Aquacin.com, forward slash roadmap.

[38:24] That being said, the point of this type of lead magn, which I'm obviously a fan of, is revealing

[38:28] the problem.

[38:29] Then you then have your delivery mechanism for what that lead magn is going to be.

[38:34] Now for her, she uses information as the thing that she's basically doing.

[38:38] So for her lead magn then turns into physical product, basically informs the physical

[38:42] products that she's going to offer.

[38:44] Right?

[38:45] That's fundamentally the issue.

[38:46] Now I guess you could have a discount, I don't normally consider discounts as a lead magn

[38:50] and I kind of see that as a component of an offer.

[38:52] But yeah, fundamentally that's how it works.

[38:54] And guys, don't be afraid of asking for more.

[38:57] Look at this.

[38:58] Eight of eight.

[38:59] Right?

[38:59] Like, if you need more information to make something more valuable for someone, ask for

[39:04] it.

[39:05] Right?

[39:06] Like, a lot of people have this fear of like, oh, my conversion is going to go down.

[39:07] It's like, yeah, but conversion of whom?

[39:09] Right?

[39:10] Like, of people who really want to buy the thing, like, they probably will finish it.

[39:13] Now, to be clear, there's good friction and bad friction.

[39:15] Like, you don't want to make the, these are experienced clunky.

[39:18] But if fundamentally you need the information so that you can give them more value, then

[39:21] ask for it.

[39:22] Like, we asked for more information about the business so that we can make a personalized

[39:25] roadmap for you, which we have some automation cool stuff in the background.

[39:27] And delivers this stuff that you need at your particular stage in business.

[39:31] And so there's more than like, hey, just your name and phone number, right?

[39:34] It's personalized.

[39:35] So one of the really clever things that credit-based memberships have is that they basically

[39:40] function like gift cards.

[39:41] And I'm a huge fan of gift cards for writing reasons.

[39:43] The biggest one being, it's basically getting a interest free loan from your customers.

[39:48] All right.

[39:49] So whenever someone, you know, signs up for a gift card, they basically front you money and

[39:52] you haven't done anything yet.

[39:53] Right?

[39:54] So from a cash flow cycle, it's a, it's the most accelerated cash flow possible.

[39:57] They pay you and you don't have to do anything.

[39:59] And so the idea is, one, you have faster cash flow, which is good.

[40:05] Second, some percentage of people are not going to necessarily redeem it.

[40:09] And so that becomes your profit, right?

[40:11] Because the way that hers is written, it's not redeemable for cash in any way.

[40:14] All right.

[40:15] Now, I think one of the, the unique components of her membership offer really smart because

[40:21] lingerie in and of itself, right?

[40:24] Not as recurring of a purchase.

[40:27] Like if you were, if I would say, hey, name me a membership type, you probably first

[40:31] thing they came to mind, probably wasn't going to be lingerie.

[40:33] If anything, that's just, when I think lingerie, I think special occasion, right?

[40:37] Which by its very nature is going to be intermittent, not recurring on a regular basis,

[40:41] right?

[40:42] Otherwise it wouldn't be special occasion to just be in every day occasion.

[40:43] Right?

[40:44] And so it's like, how do you get people to consistently buy from you?

[40:47] Well, the discounts are huge part because they figure that over the year they're

[40:50] going to buy.

[40:51] Number one, number two, they can choose to not purchase anything this year.

[40:55] And so they can just choose to execute their credit only on the months they do have special

[41:00] occasions.

[41:01] But at least it keeps it top of mind.

[41:03] And I would imagine that many women, her target audience, like shopping.

[41:08] And it's almost like window shopping, done digitally where they say, hey, here's a bunch

[41:12] of stuff that we think you might like.

[41:13] And some people just enjoy window shopping.

[41:16] I mean, it's, it's a, it's something that women do in a regular basis where people do,

[41:20] uh, on a regular basis in real life and they do the same thing online.

[41:22] People browse and they don't buy anything because they still get some dopamine or whatever

[41:26] it is that reinforces them from looking.

[41:28] Next thing that she's really going all in on with this membership is that it's, she, she,

[41:32] almost makes it hard to not buy the membership.

[41:36] And so you can look here at her purchase page.

[41:38] So first off, the button says member add to back.

[41:41] It doesn't say buy, didn't say guess check out.

[41:42] It says member add to back.

[41:44] And you can see that the breakdown too where she has kind of like a double price drop, right?

[41:48] So you've got guest purchase, which is almost great out, right?

[41:51] You can even see that they, they change the pixel so it's a little bit.

[41:55] It's like good better best, right?

[41:56] And so the worst here is, you know, guest is $12.95.

[42:01] Then member is $9.95, but for you, because your brand new and where I'm obviously not a,

[42:09] a jee string, a painting collector, maybe I am, he ever know of my other, my other life.

[42:16] It's $5.18.

[42:18] So you see this tremendous price drop, so 60% off.

[42:21] And if someone's like, well, shoot, I'd rather do that.

[42:23] And then when you find out, oh, you can just apply that today and never have to pay again,

[42:26] because you can skip functionally every other purchase, that becomes a very attractive offer.

[42:30] But you have to cancel in a month, right?

[42:33] Well, you can cancel in every month, but you probably only be reminded to cancel in a month.

[42:36] But at that point, they'll present you new stuff.

[42:38] And so if you have membership offer, I think making that your primary offer and then basically

[42:42] downselling the premium is one way of doing it.

[42:45] That obviously is work very well for me.

[42:47] And I will mention this just because I think it's an obvious one.

[42:50] Having third party financing is very, you'll just make more money.

[42:54] So if you don't have that integrated, your site, especially if you're doing physical products,

[42:58] you're typically losing somewhere in the neighborhood of 30% of yourselves.

[43:01] And so to summarize my rating and critique for this business, I rate this a baddie business

[43:08] out of 10.

[43:09] And if you want me to break down or critique another business and run through the models

[43:13] that we teach at acquisition.com, put it below and I'll put it in my line up for next

[43:18] businesses.

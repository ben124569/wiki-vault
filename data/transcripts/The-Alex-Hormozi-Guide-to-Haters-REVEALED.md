[00:00] I get a lot of hate.

[00:00] Let's go through some of the fun ones that my team pulled.

[00:03] We'll see him working at Starbucks soon.

[00:05] loser.

[00:06] How much did the fake private jet cost you?

[00:09] loser.

[00:10] If you do anything worth doing,

[00:13] there will be people who oppose you.

[00:15] And they will throw rocks at you and attack.

[00:18] I want to break down how I've dealt with it

[00:20] going from one, seven and a half million dollars

[00:22] for the last two years.

[00:23] So you kid too.

[00:24] So I want to walk through kind of two frameworks

[00:26] that I think through when dealing with hate,

[00:29] negativity, people calling you a liar.

[00:31] First things first, this is the quick and dirty

[00:33] and then I'll get a little bit more nuanced.

[00:35] So when someone attacks you,

[00:38] you have three options as I see it

[00:40] if the claim they are making has an element of truth.

[00:43] At level one, you have ignore.

[00:46] This is what I would consider my all time heavyweight

[00:49] champion of the world personal preference.

[00:51] Ignoring it costs me the least amount of time,

[00:54] the least amount of effort.

[00:55] And this is a very, very important one.

[00:57] They're choosing to advertise me.

[00:59] They're choosing to take all their hard earned attention,

[01:02] their eyes, the goodwill they have, their audience,

[01:04] and say, hey everyone, look at Alex.

[01:06] What a gift.

[01:07] And the crazy thing is is that when people direct

[01:09] their customers towards you, some of them buy.

[01:12] That's what's mind-blowing.

[01:13] I mean, like thank God, like loser 29,

[01:15] like I hope you keep doing this

[01:17] because it just continues to fill my bank account.

[01:18] That big set, ignore costs you the least.

[01:21] There's no effort on your behalf.

[01:22] It's amazing.

[01:23] This is why it's probably one of my all time favorite ways

[01:25] to deal with most things in life.

[01:27] And I'll give you the quote that my dad told me many,

[01:28] many times for my life.

[01:29] He said, God gave you the power to ignore, use it.

[01:31] The second, this one takes effort.

[01:34] Agreed.

[01:35] I think Gary popularized the concept of M&M,

[01:38] winning the rap battle.

[01:39] I am like, I am a fucking punk.

[01:41] I do think I'm gonna try to run my mom.

[01:44] The other guy couldn't talk shit about him.

[01:45] Is he claimed every single negative thing that was about...

[01:48] Hey, tell these people something they don't know about me.

[01:51] Yeah!

[01:54] If someone says, hey, Alex, you're such an

[01:57] ego-tistical douchebag and you don't care about other people.

[02:01] I could agree.

[02:01] Yeah, man.

[02:02] I suck.

[02:04] What do they say now?

[02:05] There's nothing to say.

[02:06] And it just silences it.

[02:08] Because the thing is is that conflict only goes on

[02:11] as long as there's an equal or opposing force.

[02:14] As soon as you step to their side of the table,

[02:16] there's nothing to push against.

[02:17] There's only one person allowed in the angry boat.

[02:19] And so what you can do is you get in the angry boat with them.

[02:23] And you say, I know I suck.

[02:25] And then they have to get out.

[02:26] Because if they agree with you then what?

[02:28] It just eliminates the conflict.

[02:30] There's nothing left to talk about.

[02:32] And then you move on with your life.

[02:33] Now, the third level of this is what I would consider

[02:36] an injured level, a 3 plus 1 or 1 up them.

[02:39] So if someone says, Alex, you're an ego-tist,

[02:42] I could say, dude, you don't know the half of it.

[02:45] I do this and this and this and salt yourself better

[02:49] than they can.

[02:50] And you should know how to do it better than they can.

[02:51] Because you know you better than they do too.

[02:53] So this is the quick and dirty, 95% of the conflict

[02:58] are the attacks that you will get.

[02:59] Usually you can deal with with this through step process.

[03:02] If you haven't seen this,

[03:03] there's an unbelievable scene in Ted Lasso

[03:06] where Nate, his former protege, gets on the camera

[03:10] at live and talks at bunch of shit about him

[03:12] and says that he's an idiot.

[03:13] He doesn't know what he's doing, whatever.

[03:14] Fast forward to the press conference

[03:15] where they're asking Ted Lasso and he handles it

[03:19] perfectly from a PR perspective.

[03:21] And he actually uses number three.

[03:23] He says, oh man, Nate said that about me?

[03:26] Man, he could have said this, he could have said this,

[03:28] he could have made some fun on my accent.

[03:30] That's nice, you're great for it.

[03:31] He's the same way on the pitch.

[03:32] You'll find the tiniest little weakness and a team

[03:35] and just want to attack that.

[03:37] And then the whole crew of newscasters

[03:39] just start laughing because there's nothing else to say.

[03:42] Now if he had then attacked back,

[03:43] then it would've become this whole drama.

[03:44] But after that, it's done.

[03:46] He puts it to rest.

[03:47] And then Nate looks vicious for attacking somebody

[03:50] who has a sense of humor.

[03:51] Now, the second category, if someone lies,

[03:55] they accuse you of lying about something.

[03:57] This is something called an extinction curve.

[03:59] A classic example would be like, I could yell at a rock.

[04:01] And if I keep yelling at a rock,

[04:02] at some point I will stop yelling at the rock.

[04:04] Why?

[04:05] Because the rock doesn't give me any feedback.

[04:06] And so what we want to be in the situation is the rock.

[04:09] When you are ignoring, you are just, you are stone.

[04:12] They can do whatever they want.

[04:14] It doesn't affect you.

[04:15] And I love this position because you are greater than.

[04:19] Hate only comes from below.

[04:22] In my entire life, it has never come from above.

[04:24] And so if someone hates on you, just take that

[04:27] as mental note of the fact that they're below you.

[04:29] And they can seed the fact that they follow you.

[04:32] And so based on the person who's hating on you,

[04:34] they will maybe hate on you one time.

[04:36] And then disappear.

[04:37] Or hate on you two times in the disappear.

[04:38] But if you don't respond, they will eventually disappear.

[04:40] It is just a fact of life.

[04:42] Unless they get reinforcement, they will disappear.

[04:44] And that's why I just choose not to engage.

[04:46] I also don't like wasting one time.

[04:47] Now, let's go into the ugly scenarios of what if what they're saying

[04:51] is basically calling you a liar around something core to your brand

[04:55] or what you've been known for.

[04:57] Here's my little box.

[05:00] So you've got bigger than you, smaller than you.

[05:09] And then they said you lied about something.

[05:12] Or they said something else.

[05:14] So let's start with the easiest one.

[05:15] Someone smaller than you.

[05:16] And they just said, Alex has big ears.

[05:19] I can ignore them.

[05:20] I could agree and be like, hell yeah, I got big ears.

[05:22] You should see what else I'm like.

[05:23] Number three, I can be like not only do I have big ears.

[05:26] I could one up them.

[05:27] They're actually even worse when it rains

[05:29] because then I catches all the water.

[05:31] And then my back gets wet.

[05:31] It's a whole problem.

[05:32] Believe me, my wife will tell you.

[05:33] Now all of a sudden, there's nothing they can say.

[05:35] So if you do the one, two, three process here,

[05:38] you pick whichever one you want at all three of them will serve you.

[05:40] Let's go into slightly harder territory.

[05:43] There's more than you, but they're basically calling you

[05:45] I don't know lie, that could threaten your reputation.

[05:49] They say you falsified claim something along those lines,

[05:51] which typically comes to dishonesty,

[05:53] which is one of the things that the whole world hates.

[05:55] The world forgive just about anything except for a liar.

[05:58] Kind of interesting.

[05:58] Now, in my opinion, I'm just giving you the Alex playbook.

[06:05] I ignore.

[06:07] That's it, I ignore.

[06:08] As painful as it is, and to see them,

[06:11] you know, frothing at the mouth and the common threads

[06:14] they have go back and forth, never once,

[06:16] have I made less money from anyone doing this.

[06:19] Because think about this.

[06:20] The only way that you combat their message

[06:23] is by being louder with yours, not directing your traffic

[06:26] to them.

[06:27] And so you ignore them plus you amplify.

[06:32] Because every moment that I spend addressing them,

[06:36] I stop giving value to my audience.

[06:38] So in a very real way, attacks have taken people down,

[06:42] but because of how they responded,

[06:44] not because of the strength of the attacker.

[06:46] They take someone off their game

[06:48] then they get in this petty pissing match

[06:49] with someone who's lower than them.

[06:51] And it makes them look bad.

[06:52] Even if you win, you lose.

[06:53] It's a pure victory.

[06:55] You lose credibility.

[06:56] People see a different side of you.

[06:57] All of that's bad.

[06:59] And so I prefer to pretend you don't exist

[07:02] and then 10x my message.

[07:04] And tell everyone who's on my team,

[07:06] these fuckers are lying and trying to destroy us.

[07:08] The only way that you beat hate

[07:10] is you don't beat hate you drown it out.

[07:12] And as a second point to this,

[07:13] someone can hate on you who's below you

[07:17] and get you to respond.

[07:19] It means that they control you.

[07:22] They are in control of your actions.

[07:24] How weak does that appear?

[07:26] I wanna be a rock.

[07:27] I want somebody to be aware of the fuck they wanna do

[07:29] and I will continue to be a rock.

[07:31] That's at least how I perceive these types of situations.

[07:34] Use it if useful.

[07:35] But ignore and amplify.

[07:36] Now, we've covered box one and two.

[07:38] So these are the easy one.

[07:39] If someone's bigger than you and they say something else,

[07:43] you want to three of them.

[07:44] Same as before.

[07:45] And what I recommend is really lean into number three.

[07:48] Just eviscerate yourself.

[07:49] So there's a major news outlet like,

[07:51] read Top 5.

[07:52] You know who this news person is.

[07:54] Attacked somebody who's in the porn industry

[07:56] and they were discrediting and saying,

[07:58] man, look at what this generation has come to.

[08:01] And it was just a video of a bunch of girls

[08:03] jumping to pool whatever.

[08:04] And so they respond,

[08:05] because they're when tagged and knew they were.

[08:06] And so they said, you should join us next time.

[08:09] Now, the news act was trying to hate on them,

[08:11] but they just made a joke out of it.

[08:13] What's the coolest way to respond?

[08:14] Just make a joke out of it.

[08:15] And what does he look like?

[08:16] Super petty.

[08:17] What do they look like?

[08:18] Fun and awesome.

[08:19] And what do they do that next day?

[08:20] Record sales.

[08:22] He chose to use his platform to direct attention

[08:25] to theirs for free.

[08:26] Didn't have to pay a feeling commission.

[08:27] What a steal.

[08:28] We should only hope that someone bigger than us

[08:30] hates on us.

[08:31] Rule number one.

[08:32] Never attack back.

[08:33] You cannot win by attack it.

[08:36] You win by deflection or by amplifying about.

[08:39] You never win in direct conflict when it comes to reputation.

[08:42] Now, in the last box, someone bigger than you

[08:45] tries to discredit you.

[08:47] How do you respond?

[08:48] So there's a mega influencer.

[08:50] And I saw this influencer that I followed for many, many years

[08:53] make all these posts about denying this claim

[08:56] that they were getting attacked for.

[08:57] So this was a lie that many people were trying to attack them

[09:00] with.

[09:01] And it was specifically a competitor of theirs

[09:02] that was trying to defame them.

[09:04] Right?

[09:04] Really petty stuff.

[09:05] But tough for that individual,

[09:07] because they built their whole career off of this particular truth.

[09:10] I'm just going to read the exchange to you.

[09:12] I said, can I suggest something?

[09:15] I believe that brand is built on associations.

[09:17] If I stand next to something and say,

[09:19] I am not a pink elephant.

[09:20] People will over enough time associate me

[09:23] and the pink elephant.

[09:24] We're placed pink elephant with whatever you are claiming

[09:27] you are not.

[09:28] Think about that for a second.

[09:29] This is me cutting to you who's listening

[09:31] or watching us right now.

[09:32] If you keep saying, I'm not that way.

[09:34] I'm not that.

[09:34] I'm not that.

[09:35] All that people remember is you and that.

[09:37] It's it.

[09:38] So you keep repeating that and you actually

[09:40] feed into the narrative you're trying to disprove.

[09:42] Although well-intentioned,

[09:43] I don't think these posts help you.

[09:45] For context, I didn't know you were dealing with this.

[09:47] But then you drew my attention to it.

[09:49] So you used your platform to increase awareness

[09:52] of your enemy's message.

[09:54] The only way you could combat hate is to get louder.

[09:56] You shrink them into irrelevant.

[09:58] You don't win on logic.

[09:59] You win by force.

[10:01] Because you'll never convince them.

[10:02] You can make them so small they cease to matter.

[10:05] Take it or leave it, just my opinion.

[10:07] But I've studied brandy plea,

[10:09] including mine from zero, and I get plenty of hate

[10:11] and people who say I faked my business success.

[10:13] Success.

[10:14] And then I make up my numbers, et cetera.

[10:16] I gain nothing by drawing attention to them.

[10:18] No one follows you because of this particular reason

[10:21] that the person was worried about.

[10:23] So they follow you because of the value you provide them.

[10:27] And let's face it.

[10:28] Even if someone did think that you weren't this one particular thing,

[10:32] it doesn't affect them at all.

[10:34] It doesn't change their behavior.

[10:35] Anyways, I'm just saying this.

[10:37] If you didn't reply, nothing would happen.

[10:39] Your following won't stop growing.

[10:41] You won't stop making sales.

[10:43] Only you reply to people bigger than you.

[10:45] I'm just giving you brand strategy.

[10:46] If you want to respond to our respected,

[10:48] I just tell you what I would do, which is nothing.

[10:51] Focus on winning.

[10:52] Be louder.

[10:53] Take the anxious energy and put it into your megaphone

[10:56] about your mission.

[10:58] Another thing I like is they're not worth the skin

[11:00] off the back of your knuckles.

[11:02] The law of large numbers makes it appear

[11:04] as though the world hates you.

[11:05] Humans aren't built to get this much feedback.

[11:08] Imagine 85 years old and saggy.

[11:11] And no longer look at you do now.

[11:13] Will you care about this blip?

[11:16] And I say this to say that if you get 500 hateful comments,

[11:20] that's 0.1% of your audience.

[11:22] The other 99.9% love you.

[11:25] Focus on them.

[11:26] And right now you're moving up.

[11:28] And so that means the bigger the game,

[11:29] the bigger the dragons.

[11:32] Also, all these people,

[11:34] based on the nature of this particular person,

[11:36] the hate was also laced on the fact that they couldn't have done

[11:39] as well as they did without faking it, basically.

[11:42] And so I said, they're just complimenting you.

[11:46] That's all this hate fundamentally is.

[11:48] So take that insult as a compliment instead.

[11:52] It only bothers you because you choose to let it bother you.

[11:55] And so I sent this particular person a story of

[11:58] a lady getting called a skinny bitch by some dude

[12:00] who walked past her.

[12:02] She was like, did you hear that?

[12:03] Called me skinny.

[12:04] And so even though the guy minted as an insult,

[12:07] she took it as a compliment,

[12:08] which means the entire thing was just based on our subjective choice

[12:11] of how we choose to take these things.

[12:12] And so it only bothers you because you let it.

[12:14] Otherwise, they're just sending you traffic.

[12:16] They're choosing to promote you.

[12:17] For free, what a deal.

[12:19] I said, can you ask them to send some to me too?

[12:21] I would just like the extra attention,

[12:23] but let them know that I won't return the favor.

[12:25] Just to be clear, I'm not sending my traffic to them.

[12:27] So I finalized all of this stuff with just saying,

[12:31] if it's true, lean into it, if it's false

[12:33] and the smaller ignorant, if it's false

[12:35] and they're bigger, make them seem petty.

[12:37] And beyond those actions, you only win by getting louder.

[12:39] You don't silence hate, you drown enough.

[12:41] You only lose if you get quieter or you change your message.

[12:46] And so you get quieter by not saying anything at all,

[12:50] which in a way stops delivering value to your audience,

[12:53] or you change the message you have to your audience

[12:55] because you're no longer providing value to them

[12:57] and directing them elsewhere.

[12:58] And either scenario, the only solution is value.

[13:02] Because the only thing anyone will care about is value.

[13:05] And if they came there for the value,

[13:07] they will stay there for the value.

[13:09] And most times, those people will attack the people

[13:11] who are trying to discredit you

[13:13] because they love the value that you give it

[13:15] and they don't want it to stop.

[13:17] But no matter what, no one keeps attacking someone

[13:20] who does not reply.

[13:22] And if you just keep getting bigger and keep getting louder,

[13:24] keep providing more and more value,

[13:26] you weather the storm.

[13:27] It has happened every time of my life,

[13:29] then I've had some crazy people come after me.

[13:32] And you know what?

[13:34] Long enough time rising, extinction curves always rule.

[13:36] If you yell to rock long enough, you walk away.

[13:39] Yes, even these big ones, where it feels the worst,

[13:43] where they're discrediting the biggest thing,

[13:45] one, two, three.

[13:48] Ignore, agree, one up, if you can.

[13:51] So somebody was being discredit,

[13:52] so it was an athlete for being not natural.

[13:54] So being accused of taking steroids.

[13:56] This was a girl.

[13:57] Now all these people are trying to attack her.

[13:58] And I thought that the most elegant response

[14:03] that she could have done, hey guys, you got me.

[14:07] I'm not natural.

[14:10] My boobs are fake.

[14:13] My hair is actually a darker brown.

[14:15] And my eyelashes, peel them off.

[14:19] These are actually fake too.

[14:20] And hold on, let me take this makeup, remove her thing,

[14:23] and smear it off my face.

[14:25] Yep, I wear makeup too.

[14:26] And so you got me, the rumors are true.

[14:30] I'm not natural.

[14:31] I enhance my appearance.

[14:34] And if she had said something like that,

[14:37] that would have killed anything else someone else can say,

[14:42] because she would have made a joke out of their attack.

[14:46] And so if you're noticing an underlying theme

[14:48] with all of this, the one thing that counters hate

[14:52] about everything else is humor.

[14:56] And one of the all time funny things that you can always do

[14:59] is make fun of yourself.

[15:01] And we should always be better at mocking ourselves

[15:04] that anyone else does.

[15:05] Why?

[15:06] Because we have more material.

[15:08] And so just think about all the things that you can think of

[15:10] that are adjacent to the insult that they have

[15:14] so that you can agree with them

[15:16] and attack even more viciously than they are to yourself.

[15:21] And then you will appear as the class act,

[15:24] you will appear as more humble

[15:25] and they will have nothing to say back

[15:28] because no one kicks someone who admits their quote

[15:30] falter rongs.

[15:32] They look like the bad guy.

[15:34] And then the conflict dissipates.

[15:37] Now, I walked you through these examples,

[15:39] but I want to give you a realistic representation

[15:42] of the proportion of times that I use one, two, three.

[15:48] So if this is a pie chart where I use one, two, and three,

[15:52] one being ignore, two being agree,

[15:56] three being agree and one up.

[16:09] For those of you listening at home,

[16:10] I just drew a big circle with the world's

[16:13] tiniest slice sliced out of it.

[16:16] And that tiniest slice is two and three together.

[16:19] 99% of my attention just goes to continuing to amplify my message.

[16:25] People could taxorize the heat because it feels like dying.

[16:29] We have a lot of strong social behavior that is read into us.

[16:34] Like in the first things we do as a kid,

[16:36] we get shamed and we correct our behavior.

[16:38] And so when people say bad things about us,

[16:40] we change it feels bad.

[16:41] The problem with social media is that it amplifies that heat.

[16:44] You get a lot of it.

[16:45] And so we're not really built to take that kind of hate.

[16:47] But we can't comprehend is the law of large numbers that are associated.

[16:51] If you have a million people who follow you,

[16:53] and you get 500 people who hate you every single day,

[16:56] it's 0.5%.

[16:57] You could barely even see it on this graph,

[16:59] but it feels like 500 people,

[17:01] and that feels like so many.

[17:03] But it's just a very small percentage of a very large number.

[17:07] The quote I say where you can only lose if you quit,

[17:11] is true again here.

[17:12] If you have reputation,

[17:14] the only way that you can get canceled

[17:16] is if you choose to accept being canceled,

[17:19] or some external power makes it impossible for you

[17:23] to amplify your message.

[17:25] Meaning, if you get D platform from everything,

[17:27] and no platform allows you to post,

[17:29] and they have AI that searches every video,

[17:31] that anybody else makes a value,

[17:33] and removes it automatically, yeah, you got canceled.

[17:36] But short of that,

[17:39] the only other way you can cancel

[17:40] is if you choose to accept being canceled,

[17:43] and choose to stop making your message.

[17:45] Because on a long time horizon,

[17:47] if you keep putting out the value that you have,

[17:49] you keep announcing the message

[17:50] by percentage of the things that people are consuming,

[17:54] more and more of it,

[17:55] is the positive thing that you're talking about.

[17:57] And so today, it may seem like 50% of the news is bad,

[18:02] but if you take today and then multiply it by six months,

[18:05] and it's one day or two day or five days,

[18:07] out of 180 days, that 50% was about this negative thing.

[18:12] And that all of the extra was you providing value,

[18:14] providing value, then that shrinks the amount of quote,

[18:18] hate or negativity that you receive.

[18:20] And the only way that you can solve it is through activity,

[18:23] is through advertising in the little sense,

[18:24] by making your message known.

[18:27] Hate is a prerequisite for success.

[18:29] Just like Winston Churchill said,

[18:31] do you have enemies?

[18:32] Good, you start off for something sometime in your life.

[18:35] The only people who get no hate

[18:36] are people who are invisible.

[18:37] If you do nothing, that is the only way

[18:39] to guarantee that you have no hate.

[18:41] But if you stand for anything in your life,

[18:42] the way people who stand against you,

[18:43] and it is in their nature to attack, and that's okay.

[18:46] And so I want to walk you through this

[18:48] because if you're dealing with one of these situations

[18:50] with it's employee, whether it's a customer,

[18:51] whether it's a competitor, or just somebody

[18:53] who just is invious of you.

[18:54] The playbook has already been written.

[18:56] It's just hard to execute in the moment,

[18:58] but the more you do it, the better you'll get at it.

[19:01] And the TLDR is, remember that number one,

[19:04] it's still by far the biggest part of this,

[19:06] which is you just keep doing you.

[19:08] Because if people know that they can control your behavior

[19:10] by pushing this button to get this response from you,

[19:13] more people hit that button,

[19:14] you actually let your audience know

[19:16] and you let your competitors know

[19:18] and your enemies know that you have cheat codes,

[19:21] that they can dismantle you.

[19:22] But if they can hit anybody, wherever they want,

[19:24] as hard as they want, and you're gonna keep doing you,

[19:27] you become very hard to beat.

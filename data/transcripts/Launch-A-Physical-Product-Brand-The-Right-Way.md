[00:00] I get asked all the time about these no strips that I wear.

[00:02] I wear no strips so that I don't snore at night.

[00:05] In this video, I'm going to break down how I would launch a no strip business if I were

[00:08] to launch one and how I would get it to be a $40 to $16 million enterprise and how you can

[00:13] use the same thought process to apply to any physical products business or service business

[00:17] that you use to sell stuff to people that you don't know.

[00:22] The no strip costs pennies to manufacture.

[00:24] You can sell them for a hundred times that price.

[00:26] So if it costs you two cents, you can sell it for a buck, you're making huge margins

[00:30] on the actual thing.

[00:31] The second thing is that it's sticky quite literally, but also from recurring standpoint,

[00:35] if you can prove how someone breathes, they're going to buy it again and again and again.

[00:38] I could have audorship built into it, which would be nice and it makes it convenient for

[00:41] people.

[00:42] It's also something that doesn't require willpower to use.

[00:44] You don't have to remember to do it.

[00:45] The problem with supplements is that people have to remember to take them.

[00:48] Most people sleep every day.

[00:49] Most people don't work out every day.

[00:50] So I'd rather associate a product with something that people are doing on a regular basis

[00:53] with out willpower.

[00:54] So the reason beauty products to me are more interesting.

[00:57] They end with this product.

[00:58] It's buying large.

[00:59] I have deep product knowledge.

[01:00] I've used the ones that are like pieces.

[01:01] Not a huge fan walk around within the morning and I take it and I put it in my pocket.

[01:04] I leave it on my kitchen to get out of bed to go get the thing.

[01:06] I like the disposable ones and the things that I probably do to make a different as I focus

[01:10] a lot on the product.

[01:11] I would also probably try and tie in some sort of branding element.

[01:14] I would put like volume or persist or endure across the bridge of the nose.

[01:19] I'd like to have one that was clear that had the word.

[01:21] So the only thing you see is the word, which I think will be really cool.

[01:24] It has to stick all the way through.

[01:25] The different flavors of the nose trips would be the words that people are working on.

[01:30] And so I like having those constant daily subconscious reminders around things.

[01:33] So they actually found in sales rooms that having a single word on the wall affected

[01:37] performance from the team even if it was just huge.

[01:39] So if you just have like one more on the wall, then everyone sees that as a daily reminder

[01:44] that they need to keep it.

[01:45] I would want my face to be the walking billboard for my own.

[01:47] And I would have it spelled backwards so that in the mirror someone could see it and

[01:50] they could see it every day.

[01:51] It would remind people of like a word they're trying to focus on for a season.

[01:54] And so I'll give you a basic estimate of what I think would end up happening money-wise.

[01:58] Let's say that we retail the product for, let's see what some strips go for real quick.

[02:02] So they currently sell for about 30 cents a strip.

[02:04] And I'd probably sell 30, 60, 90 packs.

[02:06] I would want to be a little bit premium.

[02:08] 1999 would probably be a price point that I would look at.

[02:10] In 1994 I would split test the price points there.

[02:13] But it'd probably be in that range.

[02:14] My cost of goods would almost be entirely based on a shipping cost that's associated.

[02:18] Cost to ship the no strips would probably be in the neighborhood of like $4.

[02:23] Maybe like two and a half it depends on like the 3PL that we would use.

[02:25] Even after the cost of all the no strips which is minimal, let's just say we make $16 of gross margin on a $20 product.

[02:32] It's really good for physical products.

[02:33] Five options on my app sale.

[02:35] One, three, six, twelve.

[02:36] All the way down to maybe 15% off if they buy 12 months worth.

[02:39] And then cascading upwards in terms of smaller percentages off.

[02:42] But let's do the math on how much money this would make.

[02:44] Let's say 10,000 people a month would go to a page if I said, hey check this out.

[02:47] Now if I did it consistently, it probably would go to 10,000 people a month.

[02:50] Just clicks.

[02:51] And then we converted 5% of traffic on that page.

[02:53] 500 buyers.

[02:54] Let's just keep it at the monthly rather than getting in the average bundles.

[02:57] 10% turn and that's not very low for physical, but just leave it at that every month.

[03:00] I would sign up 500 and then I'd lose 10%.

[03:03] This business would keep growing with that level of traffic until we reached 5,000 users

[03:08] because it's 500 divided by 10% which is the turn which is the number of maxed out users at a hypothetical

[03:13] max for your unequal Libreon between number of signups and number of cancellations.

[03:16] I would be at 5,000 users a month.

[03:17] Price point was $20,000.

[03:19] $100,000 a month.

[03:20] $80,000 a month.

[03:21] So a million dollars a year in profit from the no strips.

[03:25] And if I was focusing on like a branding perspective, I would probably go after the

[03:28] entrepreneur community first because it's obviously community that I have access to.

[03:32] The brand would actually be more of a personal development brand of like becoming the

[03:35] person you want to be with the daily actions and reminders of who you want to become.

[03:39] Because I'd wanted to be mass market.

[03:41] I would show different walks of life.

[03:42] Looking on different problems, moms and their word is patience.

[03:46] Patients can apply to anyone but like a prisoner who just gets out is the next con.

[03:49] It might be like forgiveness.

[03:50] It could be a much wider brand if you focus on the deficiencies that people want to

[03:54] fill and then I have to think of some kind of sexy word for the brand name.

[03:57] I don't know.

[03:58] I feel like it would be something around like better.

[03:59] Be better know strips.

[04:00] Short and simple that people could understand and share.

[04:02] You wanted to be about the prospect and more specifically about the problem that we're

[04:07] solving and the person that they want to become and the promises that we're fulfilling.

[04:11] If you can help someone, be better about who they are, people pay anything for that

[04:16] feeling.

[04:17] The wedge product is the idea that we are helping people breathe better.

[04:22] The brand and the promise is that we're helping people be better.

[04:25] What I would really want to do is build the capacity to make the words easy to print on

[04:28] there so we could have people put their own custom word in.

[04:31] So you can choose from one of my five words.

[04:33] If you want to put your own word in, it's $30.

[04:35] I get this huge premium but it's worth it for a lot of people to have their own custom

[04:38] word.

[04:39] So that would be like a unique competitive mode.

[04:41] If you develop a manufacturing capacity that can like on demand, create the word that

[04:44] someone wants, you can literally $2x3x sometimes the price of the thing is value is there

[04:49] for people and they would get a text.

[04:50] That would say, hey, what word do you want to work on this month?

[04:52] They text back.

[04:53] It automatically goes into the system and then ships it right out to them.

[04:56] And I would probably ship no strips with two or three variations of influencers that I

[05:01] thought were words that their community is dug.

[05:03] So someone sends me Mozy Nation or someone sends me S&M 500.

[05:07] Someone sends me those terms on a strip.

[05:08] I'm going to be like, do this is dope.

[05:10] And then because I have such high gross margins, I could say, hey, man, I'll give you 40%

[05:14] by the way if you're making your own business.

[05:15] If you ran 40% margin on your own audience, it's a great business anyways.

[05:19] For me, I was able to add a million dollars to business and then you add 100 influencers.

[05:23] Maybe they're not as big or they're not as no strip centric like I am.

[05:26] But maybe if they did, a tenth of the volume that I could do on average.

[05:29] It's 10 times what I'm doing, which is $10 million.

[05:32] There's only 40% margin to me because I had to give them 40 and there's 20 of those

[05:35] costs.

[05:36] I'll get another 20% from the 10x volume that I got from them.

[05:40] Mine's you stuff to run the business, but let's just keep it simple for now.

[05:42] So now we're probably looking into a three or four million dollar EBITDA business.

[05:45] That is recurring not dependent on one single face.

[05:48] Very high gross margins so that they can go into new channels.

[05:51] That has a unique and competitive mode that allows it to have a premium pricing, which

[05:54] I didn't even factor in like if we sold it for 40 rather than 20.

[05:57] That would be a really interesting business model that would have you general prize guys.

[06:01] If you're curious, the final piece is that what would this business be worth?

[06:04] If we're doing 4 million in EBITDA for physical product business like this, this business

[06:07] will probably be worth somewhere in the 40 to $16 million.

[06:10] Most of you might need business breakdown if I were to get into physical products what

[06:13] I would make and how I would make it to be a quick business.

[06:19] It was the most known to fly.

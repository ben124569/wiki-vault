[00:00] What's going on everyone?

[00:01] Happy Thursday.

[00:02] I have a good one for you today.

[00:04] I'm calling this violence is the answer.

[00:06] And what I learned from having four meetings

[00:09] with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

[00:11] So I haven't talked a lot about stuff

[00:13] that we do with charity.

[00:14] And I don't know why I haven't done it.

[00:16] I think it was just because I never,

[00:18] I didn't want it to feel like we were

[00:19] ragged any about anything like that.

[00:20] And I think that's why I haven't discussed it as much.

[00:23] But that being said, I've got a ton of things

[00:26] that have been on my mind and a bunch of lessons

[00:28] that I think that I took from speaking with Arnold,

[00:31] we had a breakfast together that was two hours long.

[00:33] We went to his house less than a month ago,

[00:36] our shoes two weeks ago.

[00:39] And in all of the instances,

[00:41] I feel like, I mean, there's tons of things

[00:43] you can learn from and like that.

[00:44] But the big thing that I was able to take away

[00:47] was I want to call it like the optimism,

[00:52] like a delusion of optimism.

[00:54] And what I mean by that is that once,

[00:57] the higher the level of success that you achieve,

[01:00] the more noise and hate you will receive.

[01:04] And so if you think about like,

[01:06] the amount of security we had to go through

[01:07] to get into Arnold's house and all of those things

[01:09] is just like just befitting of the fact

[01:11] that there are people out there who send him death threats

[01:14] every day for just existing, right?

[01:16] Because they watched a movie and their wife divorced someone

[01:20] for who looked like him.

[01:21] And so that kind of leads to the second thing,

[01:25] the more impact you have, the more impressions you make

[01:29] based on the skill that you have,

[01:31] it's just law of large numbers,

[01:33] it's gonna be a larger percentage of batshit crazy people

[01:35] that you gotta deal with, right?

[01:37] And so if for some reason,

[01:40] the negativity of a trainer or a competitor or a client

[01:44] drags you down, then you don't have the mental fortitude

[01:48] for the success that you wanna achieve.

[01:50] Because the condition of that success is more

[01:52] or not less of the hate of the shit of the noise

[01:55] that you're currently dealing with.

[01:57] It doesn't go away, it gets louder and louder and louder.

[02:00] And so one of the skills or the disciplines

[02:04] that we have to develop is entrepreneurs,

[02:06] especially if we seek this impact.

[02:09] And that's the so many people that I talk to.

[02:11] So many entrepreneurs like I wanna impact,

[02:13] I wanna help 10,000 people, I wanna transform lives.

[02:15] If you wanna help 10,000 people,

[02:17] then you have to be prepared to have 500 people

[02:20] who fucking hate you.

[02:22] Because anyone who does anything worth doing

[02:25] is going to have an equal and opposite reaction, right?

[02:29] That's how it is.

[02:30] If you look at every single great religious leader

[02:32] that's ever happened and it doesn't really matter.

[02:34] Almost all of them died, right?

[02:36] And were murdered for what they did.

[02:38] And most people would argue

[02:39] that they were probably good people.

[02:41] But with every positive thing that you do,

[02:44] there's going to be people reaction that's negative, right?

[02:47] And so it's like I just wanna say the sentence to you

[02:51] because it means so much to me is that

[02:54] hatred is a condition of success.

[02:57] It's a condition.

[02:58] If you have no hatred,

[02:59] if you have no people who hate you

[03:01] who talk against you, speak against you,

[03:03] that it means you're standing forward nothing.

[03:05] Like you're standing forward nothing.

[03:08] Because if there is nothing for anyone

[03:10] who's doing against you,

[03:11] then you stand for nothing.

[03:12] And that means that you're not actually having any impact.

[03:15] And so if you fear that kind of confrontation,

[03:17] if you fear that kind of hate,

[03:19] that kind of whatever,

[03:21] then you need to not be in business

[03:22] or you need to fix that part of yourself

[03:24] because you will sabotage your own success.

[03:27] You will become successful.

[03:29] The noise in the hatred and the nasirs will increase

[03:32] and then you will make yourself less successful

[03:34] so that you don't have to deal with it.

[03:36] That's like real, right?

[03:38] That's what happens.

[03:39] And so just some of the mental things

[03:41] that I've had to go,

[03:44] you know, you have trainers and you've clients.

[03:45] So you know, whatever it is, right?

[03:47] The gyms.

[03:49] One thing that I've seen with Arnold

[03:51] and on the flip side, Trump, right?

[03:53] And they don't like each other.

[03:54] They're like Arnold's outspoken against Trump

[03:56] and all like I said.

[03:57] But one thing that they both share

[04:00] that I really admire is almost a delusional optimism

[04:03] is that they almost don't even address it.

[04:08] They don't even acknowledge the presence of haters.

[04:10] They're just like, if you see Trump get attacked,

[04:14] he just won't even acknowledge it.

[04:16] And listen, I've never voted.

[04:17] I don't care, right?

[04:18] But the point is, like,

[04:21] their level of mental fortitude

[04:24] of being able to just exist on a plane that's above

[04:27] everyone else above all the noise is the condition

[04:29] for them being able to achieve the levels

[04:31] that they've been able to achieve, right?

[04:34] And so one of the things about this

[04:36] that gives me solace is that

[04:40] none of the hatred, none of the trainer leaves

[04:43] to start talking shit about you.

[04:44] None of the clients who leave and talk shit about you.

[04:46] None of that ever affects your business.

[04:48] It only affects you, right?

[04:50] And so I think Layla made a post,

[04:54] I don't know, a week or two ago,

[04:56] about like, she was basically like,

[04:58] if anyone talks shit about you,

[04:59] it's because when they talk about themselves,

[05:01] no one gives a shit, right?

[05:02] That's what they said.

[05:03] That's what her quotes it.

[05:04] And she had like seven different people

[05:06] message her people who were talking shit about us

[05:08] that we had no idea existed.

[05:10] And she was like, God, I'm never gonna make that post again, right?

[05:13] But the thing is is that this is the record,

[05:16] this is a record month for us.

[05:17] This is the best month that sales we've ever had, right?

[05:19] And amid that, this was when she posted this post

[05:23] and there's all this negativity.

[05:24] And so you have to remember that if there is negativity,

[05:27] there's also positive that's come in with it

[05:29] because as ugly as the sounds,

[05:32] there really is no negative publicity.

[05:33] Like you know this from the Frick and Presidential election, right?

[05:37] He won because there was he owned the conversation,

[05:40] good and bad, he owned it all, right?

[05:42] And if everyone is talking about you,

[05:44] guess who they're not talking about,

[05:46] anyone else, right?

[05:47] And so you have to be polar,

[05:49] you have to stand for things because that is

[05:51] going to bring the haters out

[05:52] and you should welcome it.

[05:53] You should be like, thank you for thinking about me.

[05:55] I appreciate that.

[05:56] Thank you.

[05:57] We had a record sales month this month,

[05:59] keep talking about me.

[06:00] I love it.

[06:01] Like a feeding my bank account, keep going dude, keep going.

[06:04] It's awesome, right?

[06:05] And so understanding that the law of large numbers

[06:08] is that the more people you impact, right?

[06:11] The more by percentage you're going to run the wrong way.

[06:14] And so just like accept it

[06:16] and then always put things in context, right?

[06:19] And so when we have our quarterly meeting,

[06:22] whatever, you know, someone from the front line

[06:24] or someone from the management comes up with something

[06:26] is like, I think this is a problem.

[06:28] I always ask, all right, what's the number of incidences?

[06:30] And then how many total incidences do we,

[06:32] and then how many total people who could potentially

[06:34] have an incident are there, right?

[06:39] And so I'll give you an example.

[06:40] We had someone who's a manager who was saying,

[06:44] we had a gym owner who could play it about paper

[06:46] that they're getting paid out from people

[06:48] on the prestigious website.

[06:48] He said, I don't want to sign up

[06:51] because you guys pay for paper, I pay paper.

[06:55] And she was like, it really bothered me.

[06:57] And I was like, well, how many people has this been a problem?

[06:59] She's like, so I think we should consider switching

[07:00] from paper on the site.

[07:01] Well, how many people has this been an issue?

[07:04] She was like, well, one, how many acts of affiliates

[07:07] have you had?

[07:08] So 0.1% of people had a problem with it.

[07:13] Like, don't even let it touch you, you know what I mean?

[07:16] Don't even let it touch your, your thought, your mind

[07:19] because when you have scale, you have 200 clients.

[07:22] If you have five assholes, think about it.

[07:25] It's two and a half percent of your entire client's

[07:27] help base.

[07:28] What percentage of humans do you think are kind of crazy?

[07:31] I would say at least two and a half percent, at least, right?

[07:35] And so if you can, if you can always take apart the problems

[07:39] that arise or that people bring to you

[07:41] and think about it in context of the larger numbers

[07:43] that you're dealing with, I promise you will make

[07:46] the noise of the world go down.

[07:48] And you'll be able to get to that, to send to that higher level

[07:52] and eventually we can get to the spiritual plane of Arnold

[07:55] and Trump and whatever you feel about them, I don't care.

[07:57] It's just, you can appreciate the fact

[07:59] that they can exist on another plane

[08:01] and literally just live in a world of delusionware,

[08:03] like they're untouchable.

[08:05] Because they put themselves in this box.

[08:07] And there is a borderline where it does become delusion

[08:09] because you don't take feedback, but because the heat is so loud,

[08:13] they almost can't allow it, right?

[08:14] Arnold was attacked at the Arnold Expo where he's like,

[08:17] cheering kids on.

[08:18] You don't have to be like, people are crazy.

[08:20] And you just gotta accept that.

[08:21] So let me make sure I hit on my lovely points.

[08:28] Yeah.

[08:29] And so the only thing that you have left to do

[08:32] that actually drives your business

[08:34] is the four numbers that I brought up the other day.

[08:36] Is any of these things going to drive more applications,

[08:39] is it going to drive a higher percentage of clothes,

[08:41] is it going to decrease my turn,

[08:43] is it going to increase my profitability?

[08:45] And the believe it or not, the haters, right,

[08:48] that you have the trainers, the ex clients, the whatever, right?

[08:52] The likelihood that they're going to do really impacts,

[08:55] like that they know the majority of the marketplace

[08:58] is basically zero, right?

[09:00] Like, if you have a client who leaves,

[09:03] you might not talk about any specific client

[09:05] because I'm talking about the Jews.

[09:06] I'm saying, but if you have a client,

[09:07] your Jim believes, right?

[09:08] And they know 10 people.

[09:10] They know 20 people.

[09:11] They start making posts, right?

[09:13] People only remember how they feel when they read that.

[09:16] No one ever remembers what any shit talk

[09:18] or talks about.

[09:19] They only remember the negativity

[09:21] and they associated with the person who's talking shit,

[09:23] which is why one of the biggest issues

[09:25] that I had early on in my life

[09:27] from these telling you is that I used to talk shit.

[09:29] And it was like something that I really hated about myself.

[09:32] And so the rule that I made is that

[09:34] if I am going to say something that is negative,

[09:37] I'm gonna say to the person first,

[09:39] and then about am, so if I do tell someone else,

[09:41] I'm like, hey, by the way,

[09:42] I've already told this person this is what I think about.

[09:44] And so that's kind of given me my, like,

[09:46] I don't say shit unless I've told the person

[09:48] about what I believe, right?

[09:50] And so that's kind of my rule of thumb for shit talking.

[09:54] But I say all that to say,

[09:56] that person who's left your business, that client,

[09:59] or whatever, knows 20 people.

[10:01] Your ads are reaching 50,000 people a day.

[10:04] What actual impact do you think they have?

[10:07] None.

[10:08] And so you've gotta think about it in terms of math, right?

[10:11] Because it will literally just like put you at ease

[10:13] because you realize that the things that matter

[10:15] and the business are the things that matter.

[10:17] This video is not gonna drive sales for me, right?

[10:20] I make these partially for me

[10:21] because I like documenting the journey

[10:23] and I wanna look back.

[10:24] That's actually why I do this, right?

[10:26] But me posting on Instagram doesn't do shit, right?

[10:29] This doesn't do anything, right?

[10:30] These don't really do much.

[10:32] The things that do are the things of doing the boring work

[10:35] of making sure that we refresh our ad content.

[10:37] Make sure we have good offers.

[10:39] Make sure that the leads are getting worked.

[10:41] Make sure that we're following up.

[10:42] Make sure that when we're on the sales calls,

[10:44] we're clarifying whether they're labeling

[10:46] with a more problem work.

[10:47] Going over their past pain

[10:48] and they were selling them the vacation

[10:49] and making sure that we can explain

[10:51] how we can fill the gap, right?

[10:52] The fundamentals and all scale is

[10:55] is doing the fundamentals in larger numbers

[10:58] that is all it is.

[10:59] And there's complexity in that,

[11:00] but the process from a mental standpoint is simple, right?

[11:03] And so that is what's going to grow your business.

[11:05] And so if you get distracted

[11:06] and you have somebody who's bugging you,

[11:08] you have a trainer, you have a client or whatever it is,

[11:11] just go back to your numbers

[11:12] and focus on the things that drive your business

[11:14] because I'm can tell you that

[11:16] any person who's speaking against you

[11:18] is confirming the fact that you weren't being successful.

[11:22] It's a condition, it's a condition of success.

[11:25] If you stand for nothing, no one stands against you.

[11:27] Period, it's what it is.

[11:29] Right?

[11:29] So first, the confirming that you're actually having impact.

[11:31] Second, the bringing top of mind awareness,

[11:34] they're talking about you all the time.

[11:35] Great.

[11:36] And then third, it doesn't matter anyways,

[11:39] all of it doesn't even matter

[11:41] because none of it is impacting the things

[11:43] that grow your business.

[11:44] And so just remember that, when you're spending

[11:47] $100 a day, you're buying 2000 impressions.

[11:50] You're buying 2000 people and you're buying it every day.

[11:53] Right, sorry, to any five, 5000 impressions.

[11:56] So you're buying 5000 eyeballs, right?

[11:58] And this person's organic reaches like 100.

[12:01] It doesn't matter.

[12:03] And so just like put it to rest,

[12:06] just stop worrying about it.

[12:08] Like I can't tell you, like,

[12:09] got some point where people would ask me to say,

[12:12] hey, do you want me to like just

[12:12] do you know this stuff for other people?

[12:14] I was like, no, I'm the end.

[12:15] I've been doing this two and a half years

[12:17] and when I came out, I was talking against things

[12:19] that people didn't like.

[12:20] There was a lot of gurus who were established

[12:21] when I came into this three years ago.

[12:23] I was like, I don't think all of you guys work.

[12:24] Here's why, this is math, right?

[12:26] And they started bashing.

[12:27] And that's like, that's cool, but the math is wrong.

[12:29] Right?

[12:30] I'm gonna be right.

[12:31] What they should have done was copy my shit.

[12:33] That's what they should have done.

[12:34] And they did it.

[12:35] They posture against the pride,

[12:36] which is the wrong move.

[12:37] And so I'm totally going into another direction,

[12:39] but we're just gonna rock with it.

[12:41] So from a strategy standpoint, right?

[12:44] If you're the small player, what you want to do

[12:47] is you want to attack the methodology of the bigger player.

[12:50] That's what you should do, right?

[12:52] But you better be right.

[12:53] And you have to have a unique angle

[12:56] of why yours is better and different, right?

[12:59] Now, if you're the incumbent,

[13:01] there's virtually no reason that the incumbent,

[13:03] the person who's established in the market

[13:05] should ever lose the only reason they lose

[13:08] is because they're human.

[13:09] And because they're human, because they're prideful.

[13:11] And because they don't want to accept

[13:12] that they're wrong or that could be another way, right?

[13:14] Because technically, the winner should do exactly

[13:17] what you see Amazon doing.

[13:19] They let someone come up with something

[13:20] and then boom, they rip off and they copy it, right?

[13:23] And then that guy's gone,

[13:24] because they own the entire distribution network.

[13:27] And so real talk, there hasn't been anything

[13:30] that has come out from anyone that I have seen

[13:32] and I know it's a value of everything, right?

[13:35] That has been useful, right?

[13:36] Not real.

[13:37] And so I see everything.

[13:40] And I will not let someone do to me

[13:43] what I did to the people before me, which was attack,

[13:47] attack, attack the methodology,

[13:49] because you don't want to be the type of person

[13:51] who attacks in this character.

[13:51] It's just, it literally never looks good.

[13:54] It's a losing battle, makes you look like an ass,

[13:57] no one remembers who you're attacking.

[13:58] They just remember the turn asshole, right?

[14:00] So wrong strategy that way.

[14:02] You do want to attack the methodology

[14:03] if you have a superior option.

[14:05] But the problem is if you attack it loud enough

[14:07] and the eye of sorrow comes to you

[14:10] and sees what you're doing with they should do,

[14:12] the strategic move, is to take it, distribute it

[14:15] and then wipe you up.

[14:16] That is how, that's the game, that's the game theory

[14:20] and that's how you win.

[14:21] And so the only way to beat the incumbent

[14:24] is also for the, that's why Amazon trades

[14:26] at like a zillion times its actual earnings

[14:29] because no one knows how they can beat them.

[14:31] How do you beat them?

[14:32] They don't have an ego about it.

[14:33] They don't get shit.

[14:34] They're like cool.

[14:35] You found a new toilet paper brand.

[14:37] Oh, got it.

[14:38] And they just distributed it.

[14:39] Now it's his toilet paper brand, right?

[14:41] He doesn't care.

[14:42] He doesn't even eat ego about it.

[14:43] He's like great.

[14:44] Thanks for doing the already.

[14:45] I appreciate that.

[14:46] And so it's only the people who have the ego

[14:49] about being like, I was the first one like no one cares, right?

[14:52] The only thing people care about is how much money

[14:54] they go, period, and that you are looking

[14:57] always for the next thing.

[14:58] And so that's why, that's what we came out of hybrid, right?

[15:01] Like, that's the next thing.

[15:03] Like, I think down the road, I mean,

[15:05] group change is not going away, but the price points

[15:09] will become increasingly commoditized

[15:10] and the pressure will increase

[15:12] and the middle tier prayers, the lower tier players

[15:15] are gonna go out, right?

[15:16] It's just what it is.

[15:17] And so if I'm helping the most amount of people,

[15:19] I have to create the new or the next opportunity

[15:21] to shift everyone into, which is gonna take the next seven years

[15:25] of gold rush until eventually more and more people copy it

[15:28] and then we'll come up with the next thing

[15:29] because that's business, right?

[15:30] If you want something that's gonna stick around forever,

[15:31] don't be a business, it's not gonna work, right?

[15:34] Same thing with marketing.

[15:35] So anyways, all this to say, the reason I call this violence

[15:38] is the answer is that massive action is the only thing

[15:41] you can do, right?

[15:42] It's the only combat you have.

[15:45] It's like, success is the only revenge.

[15:47] Is that you just keep focusing on doing you

[15:50] and increasing the amount of opportunities,

[15:51] increasing the percentage that you capture

[15:53] and decreasing the turning of business.

[15:55] That is all you do, that is all you focus on

[15:57] and the rest of it does not matter.

[15:59] Ignore it, it doesn't matter.

[16:01] The only way that it starts to actually affect those numbers

[16:04] that it takes up your headspace,

[16:06] it's the only way someone wins, it's the only way.

[16:10] And so if you don't want someone to win, right?

[16:12] And someone talks shit, it's a client, it's a trainer,

[16:15] it's a whatever, a competitor, right?

[16:17] First off, understand that they're not marketing

[16:19] to the people that you're marketing to.

[16:21] They're not, right?

[16:22] And they're a little 80-bitty reach is irrelevant,

[16:24] compared to how much you're spending

[16:25] and that's what we pay Facebook

[16:26] because they give us distribution, right?

[16:28] Just get that and then understand that none of that

[16:31] is any way you can affect your business

[16:33] unless you will allow to affect you.

[16:35] That's all.

[16:36] So that is why violence is the answer.

[16:39] That is probably the single greatest lesson

[16:41] that I learned and witnessed from Arnold

[16:44] and being close proximity with him,

[16:45] obviously we talked about work now,

[16:46] we talked about business stuff, we talked about charity,

[16:48] talked about lots of things, but the principle,

[16:51] the essence that I feel like I got from him

[16:53] was that he exists on his own playing field.

[16:57] He plays his own game and he just lets everyone else react.

[17:01] And that was probably the single biggest takeaway

[17:03] that I saw is that when you get to that level,

[17:05] you have to have this level of mental fortitude

[17:08] that is almost delusion.

[17:10] It borders on the illusion,

[17:11] but the only difference between

[17:13] the praise of people and geniuses

[17:14] is that the geniuses are right,

[17:15] it's the only difference, right?

[17:17] And so if you're like, we're gonna make it,

[17:19] we're gonna make it, we're making it,

[17:20] and you do, all of a sudden everything you did before was same.

[17:23] And so if you have to exist in a place

[17:24] where you're like, don't show me that stuff.

[17:26] If you have your managers or your trainers

[17:29] or like, hey, this gym down the street,

[17:30] like talk shit about us, right?

[17:31] If they say that to you, like, don't show me that shit.

[17:34] The only way that it will actually affect our business

[17:37] is if we talk about it,

[17:38] because it doesn't actually affect our business in any way.

[17:41] You close and say, else tonight?

[17:42] Yeah, I'm our, we market and make it more,

[17:43] adds, yes, right?

[17:45] Are you doing the five, five-first orientation?

[17:47] Yes, great.

[17:49] Then let's just keep fucking wrong, right?

[17:51] That's all that matters.

[17:51] You keep stealing forward.

[17:53] And the thing that pisses everyone else off

[17:55] is being unfuckable, right?

[17:57] You can't be fucked with.

[17:58] You just keep going and keep going.

[17:59] And then the noise gets louder

[18:01] because they wanna reaction

[18:02] and you just keep fucking going, right?

[18:04] And you keep winning because what you do is you focus.

[18:07] As soon as they get loud and focus in,

[18:09] you focus in on the things that drive your business,

[18:11] which is the math, right?

[18:13] It's doing the work.

[18:14] There's nothing else, right?

[18:15] Don't get in some pissing that to just a matter,

[18:18] just to distract you, takes your attention.

[18:20] So anyways, I hope that there's somebody here

[18:24] who that affects, I hope there's somebody here

[18:26] who's dealing with a trainer or dealing with a client

[18:28] or dealing with a competitor, who's talking shit,

[18:30] who's making posts, who's who,

[18:32] like, whenever you see that, just be like,

[18:35] thanks for thinking about me, bro.

[18:36] I appreciate that.

[18:37] Thanks for talking about,

[18:38] thanks for keeping me top of mind, like much love.

[18:41] So you gotta think like that

[18:42] because I see only weight and now get even more under there

[18:44] and now you're in their minds and they're not even yours.

[18:47] Because you just keep doing what you need to do

[18:49] and that's the only way you win.

[18:50] So anyways, lots of love everybody

[18:51] who'll be able to be an amazing Thursday

[18:53] and keeping awesome, I love you all.

[18:57] Tomorrow's gonna be sick.

[18:59] Let's be South's egg.

[19:01] All right.

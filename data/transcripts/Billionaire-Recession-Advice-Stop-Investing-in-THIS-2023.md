[00:00] You really need to hear this out because it really changed my life on a Hoverchanger's

[00:02] yours.

[00:03] I've been a massive shift in the economy in 2022 and my investment thesis has changed.

[00:07] I've taken all my cash out of banks and I put it somewhere else that's both safer and

[00:11] gets me a higher return.

[00:12] The way you put your money has to shift because the economy has changed.

[00:15] And at the very end of this video, I'll tell you my entire investment strategy and what

[00:18] I have shifted towards now.

[00:19] I'm 33 years old and I cost a hundred million dollars in that worth last year.

[00:23] And much to my dismay, there was no parade, I'm still 2000 times poorer than the richest

[00:27] man in the world.

[00:28] No songs, written about me.

[00:29] I have talked to many billionaires to try and figure out what my investment strategy was

[00:34] going to be to get from a hundred million to a billion.

[00:36] Because the economy has changed, things are priced differently.

[00:40] There's inflationary pressures, real estate is hanging on by a thread, crypto is crashed,

[00:44] stocks have crashed.

[00:45] So before we can get into the investing part, you have to understand what to actually

[00:48] do with the cash itself while you wait to make your moves.

[00:51] What do you do with your cash?

[00:52] If you've ever heard Warren Buffett or you heard people in the news say he has $X billion

[00:56] in cash or cash equivalent.

[00:57] It doesn't actually have it sitting in cash.

[00:59] He has it sitting in something else that's better and I'll explain what that is in a second.

[01:03] I'm going to rewind and explain what actually putting cash into big account means and

[01:07] why it's important in today's environment.

[01:09] So when you put cash into a bag, you're actually writing the bag alone to then loan your

[01:15] money and get something back.

[01:17] People don't know this, but you actually are a creditor of the bag.

[01:20] So if a bank goes out of business, they owe you money.

[01:22] Now what happens is the bank will do one of two things.

[01:24] They will either loan money to the government by buying bonds.

[01:27] Now why do they do that?

[01:28] Because the likelihood risk that the government is going to pay them back extremely high.

[01:33] Why?

[01:34] Because they can print the damn money and get the back debt.

[01:36] Or they will loan it out to people and mortgages and things like that.

[01:38] They loan the money out again and they make more than they pay you.

[01:41] And so right now if you look at your account, they'll pay you between point one and one

[01:44] percent annually on your money.

[01:45] Boo, that sucks.

[01:47] They take your money for point one percent a year and then they give it to the government

[01:51] and the government gives them 4 percent a year.

[01:53] So they get 40 times what they pay you.

[01:56] By giving the US government money.

[01:58] Now here's what's most important about debt when you loan people money.

[02:01] There are two factors.

[02:02] One is what are you going to get back?

[02:04] Which is the interest rate and the second is how likely you're going to get it.

[02:07] The interest rate is if you loan someone a money for a house and it's 5 percent or whatever

[02:11] then if you put 100 grand and you get 5,000 back and you get paid that for taking on risk.

[02:14] Now this is what's crazy and I didn't understand this.

[02:17] When I was putting my money in the bank, if the bank goes under, you lose all your money

[02:21] outside of the FDIC and shirt amount.

[02:23] The FDIC right now is completely bankrupt anyways.

[02:25] And on top of that, if it exceeds that amount, you get stock in the bank groups company.

[02:30] What did you do?

[02:31] What if there were a better alternative that was lower risk and had higher returns?

[02:35] I just learned about this and the reason I always ignored it was because it looked boring

[02:39] and ugly.

[02:40] What we decided to do before I tell you the big investment strategy that we've invested

[02:43] like the big money into.

[02:44] We decided to take that money and buy US treasuries and you're like, why would they do

[02:48] that?

[02:49] Because I'm not seeing treasuries as an investment vehicle.

[02:52] I'm seeing it as a bank account.

[02:54] Who is more likely to go under?

[02:56] Bank of America, United States government.

[02:59] Bank of America, more likely.

[03:01] To go in.

[03:02] Who pays me more?

[03:03] Bank of America, US government.

[03:05] US government.

[03:06] On top of that, you can take loans against treasuries for up to 80% of the value.

[03:11] So if you get a hundred thousand dollars in treasuries and you get four thousand dollars

[03:13] a year in interest, I could take a loan for up to $80,000 keep earning my interest

[03:17] and then put it somewhere else.

[03:18] You're like, why don't they talk about this?

[03:20] They're happy to take your money and go make 5% on it and pay you point one.

[03:24] That's the business.

[03:25] Why would they tell people?

[03:26] My entire structure of investments has changed over the last five years.

[03:29] Really, last 10 years.

[03:30] The first chunk of my life was SM-500.

[03:34] I put all my excess cash into learning skills, getting access to people, coaching

[03:38] much of church workshops, etc.

[03:39] A high-sverturn investment I still have ever made today.

[03:41] Number two, once I had more money than I could possibly reinvest in courses and in coaching

[03:45] the one not, I started plugging into the SM-500 because that's what Uncle Warren told me

[03:49] to do.

[03:50] Figgeted to work for him and worked for me.

[03:51] The third phase came post sale.

[03:53] All right, so we sold three companies last year.

[03:55] I talked to a bunch of different brands who were very, very wealthy and one of them is a very

[03:58] good investor.

[03:59] He outlined a strategy form that he called a barbell strategy, which is I have stocks over

[04:03] here, real estate over here, very little in between and then I just have my private equities

[04:07] of the companies that I am.

[04:08] So I've made money here and plowed into these two, right, with basically nothing

[04:10] in between.

[04:11] Here's the thing that you don't know.

[04:12] In the last two years, I've made maybe five investments and those investments represent

[04:17] in total maybe 10% of the cash that I have.

[04:20] I didn't realize what the problem was until I saw a video from Dave Ramsey.

[04:24] And before you cast judgment, you really need to hear this out because it really changed my

[04:27] life on a hope it changes yours.

[04:28] So I was watching a video where Graham's death and was having Dave Ramsey analyze his investment

[04:32] portfolio.

[04:33] And he said, hey, Dave, don't you feel like I'm over indexed on real estate?

[04:37] 80 plus percent of my net worth is in real estate deals.

[04:41] Dave Ramsey gave one of the wisest responses that I've ever heard in investing and it changed

[04:44] my life.

[04:45] He said, well, Graham, if you put a big circle on the table and I'm loosely paraphrasing,

[04:50] and we had to say, what percentage of your knowledge is real estate versus stocks and bonds

[04:54] and other stuff?

[04:55] What would you say it is?

[04:56] He said, oh, well, I don't know, 80, 85 percent of what I know is really about real estate.

[05:01] He looked at him and he was like, well, then that's a perfect distribution for you.

[05:05] Because it reflects your knowledge.

[05:07] If we were going to put a portfolio together of your knowledge base, it would be 80% real

[05:11] estate, 20% stock maybe.

[05:13] So where you invest is what you know.

[05:16] And so then he went on to say, I have talked to many, many billion.

[05:18] There's probably a farmer that I have.

[05:20] He said, I've learned two things from them.

[05:22] They don't do many things and the things they pick are things they understand and they

[05:25] do a lot of them.

[05:26] They find something that they like and that they understand and that they're good at and they

[05:31] do it a lot.

[05:32] And for whatever reason, the combination of understanding that in the circle, this is the

[05:36] slice of the pie that he knew and that the people were the richest in the world just pick

[05:40] one game or two games that are really well and they do a ton of those games is what changed

[05:45] my perspective.

[05:46] My takeaway was not, oh, I should go have 85% of my portfolio if you real estate because

[05:50] 85% of my knowledge on investing is not real estate.

[05:54] And the reason I wasn't able to write checks for two years despite having the theoretical

[05:57] barbell strategy, you know, we had laid out with a friend of mine who's awesome at investing

[06:01] is that that was his investment strategy.

[06:03] It wasn't Alex's investment strategy.

[06:05] But what are the things that I actually know?

[06:07] It turns out not a lot.

[06:08] What I am good at is we're very good at service based businesses.

[06:11] That is where I thrive.

[06:13] If I just write my money into deals there, I could do that with my eyes closed and so

[06:17] I had a deal that came to me recently way bigger than any real estate deal that I've ever

[06:21] even thought about participating in.

[06:22] I just looked at the guy and I was like, I will write you an unlimited check.

[06:26] How much do you want?

[06:27] I understand that business.

[06:28] This is something that I've spent my entire life doing and this is a warm buff equipped.

[06:32] It's only risky if you don't know what you're doing.

[06:34] And so if you don't know what you're doing, the reasoning gives the S&P 500 advice is

[06:37] that you don't know what you're doing.

[06:38] So just put it into 500 companies and you'll be okay.

[06:41] But where you get the outsized returns is playing in a game where you have an unfair

[06:45] advantage where you know more than everybody else does.

[06:47] Now I'm at a point where I feel pretty comfortable writing sizable checks into actual

[06:52] private deals.

[06:53] I'm actually pretty risk adverse.

[06:55] But in this world, I know the risks and so I can name them and I can know where to look

[06:59] for them.

[07:00] And I'm like, oh, this is appropriate.

[07:01] It's risky.

[07:02] You don't know what you're doing.

[07:03] Step one, invest in you, step two, invest access in indexes and then when you feel like

[07:07] you're good enough at your main game, then you have the stockpile and you can deploy

[07:10] it.

[07:11] And then that starts the compounding machine.

[07:13] My investment strategy, after all of this time has gone completely back to my business

[07:17] strategy, which is singular focus, do the things you know, do more, do it better and keep

[07:23] doing that for an extended period of time.

[07:25] And it would be unreasonable that you don't win.

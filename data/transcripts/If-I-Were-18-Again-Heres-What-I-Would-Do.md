[00:00] To go to college or not go to college, that is the question in the game of life.

[00:05] And I'm going to show you the data so that you can make your own decision.

[00:09] And at the very end, I'll give you my honest advice.

[00:13] And so let's talk about playing the game of one of zero.

[00:18] Every time I make a point for college, I'm going to move my college graduate forward one point.

[00:23] And every time I make a point for my non college graduate,

[00:27] I'll move him forward in his career one point.

[00:30] Let's see who wins in the end.

[00:32] This chart shows you how much the cost of going to college has gone up compared to the starting

[00:38] salaries.

[00:39] Now you might be like, wow, okay, there is a big difference here.

[00:42] To put this tuition increasing context, this has doubled in just the last few decades

[00:48] whereas the median starting salary has more or less stayed the same.

[00:52] So you pay twice as much for the same thing.

[00:56] Let me show you what the result of this has been.

[00:58] This is national student loan debt and you're like, oh, it's measured in dollars.

[01:02] That's in trillions.

[01:03] 1.76 trillion is more GDP than every country in the world besides maybe the top 10.

[01:11] So that means that our college-dazed kids, young adults,

[01:16] are taking on more debt than entire nations produce.

[01:20] And so at some point you have to think, are they going to be able to make that up?

[01:24] And if you're a parent or loving relative that a young person who's making this decision is sent to,

[01:29] I want to talk to you specifically.

[01:31] I went to Vanderbilt, which is a very good school right now.

[01:33] I think it's ranked 13, it's tied with Brown as a pseudo-IVoli school.

[01:37] I graduated in three years, man, to come out.

[01:39] I was president of my fraternity.

[01:40] I was vice president of the powerlifting team and I did it in three.

[01:43] Then I went into a white college job, managed to be consulting for two years and then while I was at that

[01:47] job, I studied very hard and got above Harvard Business School's GMAT mid-score.

[01:52] And so that was my plan until I started thinking a little bit more for myself about wait.

[01:56] Does the math really make sense here?

[01:58] Fast forward a decade.

[02:00] I now want to portfolio of companies that does over $20 a year.

[02:03] And I make these videos so that hopefully younger people were just people at different stages in their

[02:07] career can make better picks.

[02:09] And so that's my formal education side.

[02:11] My informal education side is that I quit my white college job, started at minimum wage at a gym,

[02:18] where I paid a guy to let me work for him and fall him around all day.

[02:22] Then I got into the gym business, scaled that to $5,000 locations the US and her company called

[02:26] gym lunch and I sold that to private equity group for $46.2 million.

[02:29] I now own a portfolio company that has over 1,000 employees.

[02:33] And so I know what businesses today are actually looking for.

[02:36] And it's not what I used to think and maybe what you used to think years ago,

[02:40] which is no one even looks at where you went to school or what you majored in or even what your

[02:44] GPA was.

[02:45] All we care about is your experience and the likelihood that you can do the job well.

[02:48] And many of the jobs that are available today, there is no school for it.

[02:51] Because the school degrees and the things that they taught have nothing to do with how much the

[02:55] economy has changed.

[02:56] And I know you care a lot about whoever you're helping make this decision.

[02:59] I want you to know I care just as much.

[03:02] And I don't benefit from either of these decisions that they choose to make.

[03:05] Except for maybe if they do something that adds benefit to the workforce,

[03:09] they might eventually work a lot of my companies.

[03:10] But that's really it.

[03:12] And so I make this as even handily as I can because I benefited from both sides.

[03:15] And here's one of the worst parts about this debt.

[03:17] Number one is that the interest rates are high.

[03:20] And number two is that you literally can't bankrupt out of it.

[03:23] Meaning once you do this, you're stuck paying it for the rest of your life.

[03:27] I think that's one point for not going to college.

[03:30] Now what do you actually get when you pay for college?

[03:33] This is the median lifetime earnings by education level.

[03:37] Meaning if you stop at this level of education,

[03:40] this is how much you can expect to make over the rest of your career.

[03:44] And so if you don't graduate high school, you make less than a million dollars for the rest of your life.

[03:49] That's the median, the middle person in the range.

[03:52] Now if you do finish with a high school diploma, about 30% better, 1.3 million.

[03:56] If you have some college so you go and maybe you drop out, 1.5, a little better.

[04:03] That's just a grade, 2.2 million.

[04:05] All right, now we're more than double our high school diploma.

[04:08] Master's degree, 2.6,

[04:10] doctoral, 3.2, and then professional degree, 3.6 million.

[04:15] Now that's how much you make over the rest of your life.

[04:19] I would say that that's a strong point for education.

[04:22] So let's move our graduated up, 1.

[04:25] We see this really high increase in income, but it's not free.

[04:30] So remember this slide that I showed you earlier.

[04:34] The depth that you take on for student loans, you cannot bankrupt out of,

[04:37] which means that until you die, you have to pay it back.

[04:41] And if you wish you to make that decision when you're 18 years old,

[04:44] you've never made a dollar in your life,

[04:45] nor can you comprehend the scope of what $250,000 of after tax income is.

[04:52] And the interest rates that you're paying when you make a $250,000 loan out,

[04:56] you're not paying back $250,000.

[04:58] You're paying back $400,500 in post tax money over the spend of your career.

[05:05] And so that leads naturally to like,

[05:07] okay, well how is that gonna affect the rest of your life?

[05:10] Well look at how earnings actually increase over time.

[05:14] And so this is important.

[05:15] When you look at your actual life,

[05:17] you're going to be saddled with relatively large payments

[05:21] for a long period of time until you can actually start catching up

[05:24] in your late 30s and early 40s,

[05:26] where earnings begin to spike.

[05:28] When are you starting a family?

[05:30] When are you getting married?

[05:32] When are you buying your first home?

[05:33] If that's what you want to do?

[05:35] All here.

[05:36] And yet, you're still saddled with that depth that you cannot get out of,

[05:41] and you have very high interest on.

[05:43] To me, that's a very strong point.

[05:45] Four, not going.

[05:47] Now the median income that I showed you earlier,

[05:49] that's over your lifetime.

[05:50] But those don't all happen at once.

[05:52] And oftentimes,

[05:53] earning power and income happen later on in your career.

[05:57] And the higher your degree, the longer it takes to actually get there.

[06:00] And you can see some of these bottom runs

[06:02] more or less stay flat that whole time,

[06:04] whereas some of these other ones that you have to pay for,

[06:06] takes longer in order to earn back.

[06:09] So by the time your late 30s, early 40,

[06:11] you might be making more money.

[06:13] But you also have the drag of the debt and the payments

[06:17] and the interest that you have to carry with you

[06:19] in the tune of a few hundred thousand dollars extra.

[06:22] Does this differential after tax,

[06:24] after lifestyle and family and house,

[06:27] does it make up the difference?

[06:29] Now you might think,

[06:30] wow, then I should not go to college.

[06:32] Well, the odds are against you in terms of earning income.

[06:35] Let's dive in.

[06:36] This line represents bachelor's degree, median lifetime earnings.

[06:41] We compare this visually with each of the other levels of education.

[06:45] So you have a 7.3% chance of making more than somebody with a bachelor's degree

[06:51] if you don't graduate high school.

[06:52] The odds aren't in your favor.

[06:54] It's not to say that you watching this,

[06:56] who's investing in yourself trying to get educated.

[06:58] You're not that 7.3% because you very well might be.

[07:01] But statistically, you've got a one in 12 shot of just beating someone

[07:06] who went to college.

[07:07] Now if you do graduate, you double your likelihood of beating that person.

[07:10] You go to one in six.

[07:11] If you get some college, one in four.

[07:15] If you get an associates, one in four ish.

[07:18] Now let's go to masters.

[07:20] You have a six out of 10 shot of making more money than somebody who just has a bachelor's.

[07:25] If you get a doctoral, seven out of 10,

[07:28] and then finally a professional 83% or eight out of 10 shot of actually making more money.

[07:34] When you do have more skills, you do make more money.

[07:37] The question still remains, is it worth it?

[07:40] But in my mind, this is a clear argument for more formal education.

[07:44] One point college.

[07:46] All the while you're thinking through this decision,

[07:48] you need to use Warren Buffett's investment question, which is,

[07:52] the difference between what you pay and what you get.

[07:54] So if someone says, hey, I want to give you this Ferrari.

[07:58] You might think, well, obviously, I want to do that.

[08:00] Well, for what price?

[08:02] Now if they say for $10,000, that's a great deal.

[08:05] If they say for a million dollars, you might be like,

[08:07] that's a terrible deal.

[08:08] And so it's not about necessarily whether getting more education

[08:13] makes more money or not, it's just, is it worth what it costs?

[08:16] If I said, hey, I can get you to make $200,000 a year.

[08:20] You might say, of course, I'm in.

[08:23] But if I said, in order to make that $200,000 a year,

[08:26] you need to pay me $7,000 for the rest of your life.

[08:28] Okay, well, all of a sudden, the amount of making is significantly less than that.

[08:33] And so you can't take how much you make

[08:35] without considering how much it costs.

[08:37] I think an important point to make here is that these are percentages,

[08:40] but it also shows that 27% of people who have a doctoral degree still don't

[08:45] make more than people with a bachelor's degree.

[08:48] All that to say, these aren't guarantees the way that they are

[08:52] purported to be.

[08:53] And a lot of college money goes into advertising that this is the guaranteed

[08:58] way of moving forward in life.

[09:00] But looking at these stats, if you're that one of those five people

[09:03] or one of those three people that's below,

[09:05] you literally got none of the upside and all of the downside.

[09:09] So why is there such a disparity between these earning levels?

[09:14] Well, it also depends what industry you want to get into.

[09:17] So for example, if you want to get into personal services,

[09:20] blue collar, health support, sales and office,

[09:24] the higher education doesn't make nearly as much of a difference.

[09:27] On the flip side, if you want to get into science, technology,

[09:31] you want to get into health professionals, so we're talking doctors,

[09:35] managerial and professional, then it does make a bigger difference.

[09:38] And so part of making this decision is, well, what do I want to do when I grow up?

[09:42] So if you think that you want to go into a very formal career path,

[09:45] you want to be an accountant, you want to be a lawyer, you want to be a doctor.

[09:49] Then it might make a lot more sense for you.

[09:51] But if you want to be a salesperson, you want to be a marketer,

[09:54] you want to do any blue collar job, any kind of home services, things like that,

[09:59] then it probably doesn't make sense for you.

[10:01] And so in my mind, that's one point for both sides.

[10:05] So one of the questions I would be asking me is, okay,

[10:08] well, if one out of eight people who has a high school degree can be somebody who has a college

[10:15] degree over their median earnings, then I'd be like, what makes that one person special?

[10:20] We actually pulled up a great research study that looked at that exact question,

[10:24] which is how many of these people would have been successful,

[10:26] who went to college already on their own without going to college?

[10:30] One of the big skews of colleges that people who go to college in general have more money

[10:35] come from higher socioeconomic families, etc.

[10:38] Well, if those people had just gone out on their own and gone into the professional world,

[10:43] would they have just made the same amount of money?

[10:45] The results might interest you.

[10:46] If you are a white person or an Asian person, you have no value ad from college.

[10:54] If you control for SAT scores, socioeconomic status and other factors that would differentiate people,

[11:00] on the flip side, if you are a Latino or you are black,

[11:04] college does have a significant 30 to 40% increase in median earnings.

[11:09] The results like life are a little bit nuanced.

[11:12] It depends on who you are.

[11:14] Now, I could make an argument, or you might say, hey, Alex is going to win either way.

[11:17] But what some of you guys don't know is, I went to Vanderbilt,

[11:20] and I graduated Magnum Cum Laude.

[11:22] That being said, everything that I do in my life today, I didn't learn in college.

[11:27] Then the question is, was it worth the money?

[11:30] The other question is, if I had started four years earlier,

[11:32] would I be further than I am today?

[11:34] So one of the most interesting statistics I've come across is that there is one metric

[11:37] above all others that predicts your earning income better than anything.

[11:41] You want to know what it is?

[11:42] It's not your race, it's not your gender, not your IQ.

[11:45] Think how crazy that is.

[11:46] It's not even your IQ.

[11:48] It's the zip code you were born in.

[11:50] My theory on the reason why that is in the differential between races is that when you go to college,

[11:56] you can figuratively change your zip code because you change your environment

[12:00] and the people you know and more importantly, the people you compare yourself to.

[12:04] Poor people can feel rich if they compare themselves to other poor people.

[12:08] But as soon as you get into a room where everyone makes 10 times more money than you,

[12:11] all of a sudden you feel like the poor person and what do you do?

[12:14] You change your behavior.

[12:16] College may add value to people who didn't already get that value given to them.

[12:21] Interesting.

[12:22] Which makes a strong argument for being the first person in your family,

[12:26] to go to college because then it actually changes the trajectory of your offspring and your

[12:30] prodigy and your family tree.

[12:32] If you're not the first person, it makes a lot less of a difference.

[12:35] And so the thing that gets a lot of people to win at college is the same thing that gets you to win

[12:42] at business and life.

[12:44] And so the question is, is the college really necessary if you have this characteristics already

[12:50] in order to get in?

[12:51] Like if you've got a high enough SAT score to get into an Ivy League school,

[12:55] like Harvard stand for a Yale, then you probably are smarter enough to do the other things without

[13:00] going to Harvard stand for a Yale and still make money.

[13:03] As a side note personally, I got above Harvard's G-Matscore for business school.

[13:08] I haven't gone to Harvard business school, but I've done pretty good in business.

[13:11] Kind of interesting.

[13:12] If I were to go to Harvard business school and then make money afterwards, was it Harvard or was it

[13:17] me?

[13:18] And I actually faced this decision when I was thinking about going to Harvard and I thought to myself,

[13:23] well, do I want to not make money for two years and incur $250,000 of debt?

[13:29] And when I did the dollars and cents for me going to business school, I thought, man,

[13:34] why don't I take the $250,000 and just start a business and I'll bet that by the end of those two

[13:40] years, I'll have learned more than I did in business school and I'll graduate the game of life

[13:46] two years ahead and making more than the median income of somebody who went to business school.

[13:51] And that ended up being true.

[13:53] And so if you want to get into anything that doesn't have a formal degree required in order to make

[13:57] that money, then it doesn't make sense.

[14:00] And that's one point for the career.

[14:02] So one of the big things that Pro College Advocate's talk about is the network that you meet

[14:08] when you're in college and how much that alumni network can benefit you getting a job,

[14:14] doing a deal, or whatever it may be in the future.

[14:17] And I will put two strong caveats on that claim.

[14:21] Number one is, do I think that for $50,000 a year, I could buy into whatever network I want to be

[14:27] if people making significantly more money than me with skills that I'd like to learn for $50,000

[14:32] every single year for four straight years?

[14:34] To me, that answer is mood or even more in favor of just going the career.

[14:39] And if you want to buy a network, then buy a network.

[14:42] To me, that's an argument for not going to college if we're trying to control for the same money.

[14:49] Now one of the other points that's Pro College that is often made is what about the social

[14:53] experiences you have.

[14:55] The once in a lifetime opportunity to be around all people, only your age,

[14:58] potentially meet the love of your life, party, have lots of fun, get dressed up in

[15:02] tugas, learn how to beer-bong, and all of that stuff.

[15:05] For $50,000 a year, a thousand dollars a week.

[15:09] You could party your absolute face-off and make friends with all of these people in that same period of time.

[15:16] Now, I would say though, it is more difficult to meet that many people your age in a professional

[15:22] career than it is to do it at college.

[15:24] And I would say that if you're looking purely from a fun basis, I'm not going to say real

[15:27] words are going to be college.

[15:29] Now, can you get close with a thousand dollars a week?

[15:31] You go to Vegas, they'll show you how all of a time.

[15:34] But I would still argue that from a social perspective, those four years would be more fun.

[15:40] The question is what you're optimizing for.

[15:42] Now, if you're going to say, I just want to go to a resort for four years.

[15:45] I totally understand, but understand that that's what you're choosing to buy.

[15:49] But if that is what you want, then I would say that the social aspect is a pro for college.

[15:53] Now, one of the things worse discussing is, can you get the upside for free?

[15:56] Now, if you have FAFSA and you qualify for it, I mean, you can get financial aid, or you can get

[16:00] grants, or you get a merit-based scholarship for sports or for scholarship.

[16:04] That makes a real difference, because now you're getting all the upside without having the downside.

[16:08] And if you live within these 24 states, you can actually get a bachelor's degree,

[16:12] whereas the other 26 states in the union don't actually offer that.

[16:17] And if you can go to college for a bargain, then that might be a great deal.

[16:21] And that would be one point for college.

[16:23] I do think that there are some full-priced colleges that even if you had to take loans, it would

[16:27] make sense to go to.

[16:28] If you get into Harvard, or you get into Princeton, or you get into Stanford, or Yale,

[16:33] or one of the Ivy League schools, a top 20 school-needed state that everyone recognizes the name,

[16:38] I would say that for how much that will impact your personal brand, that is worth it.

[16:44] Because one, every single time you walk to a room, people will be like, oh yeah, he went to Harvard,

[16:48] he went to Yale. And that will immediately shift their perception of you and the types of jobs

[16:54] and how quickly you can progress in your career.

[16:57] The second factor is that the people who go from those colleges become the ruling class.

[17:03] They rule the world. They go to the highest paying jobs.

[17:06] The people who graduate from those schools, they're meeting income. I don't know what it is,

[17:10] but many of them are in the tens to 20s to 50s of millions of dollars per year.

[17:16] And so in those instances, if you can get in there, then the arbitrage of what you pay versus what you get

[17:22] is still a great deal. Now let's look at the lifetime earnings a little bit more nuanced.

[17:26] Because this is across all degrees and all schools, but I think we can both agree that all

[17:32] degrees are not created equal. If somebody says, hey, I have a PhD from state U versus I have a PhD

[17:38] from Harvard, you can probably bet that that Harvard PhD is going to be going to top firms,

[17:43] move faster, and ultimately just make more money over the long term. They can also network with

[17:48] other Harvard PhDs who get into those great places where is that might not be as prevalent.

[17:53] And so the 75th percentile at Harvard for a bachelor's degree might be not 3 million, but it might be

[18:00] 6 or 10 or 15 million. And so in that instance, it does make sense. And as much as you're like

[18:07] man, this is a more complex decision. Yeah, many variables exist and many variables must be studied,

[18:14] welcome to the real world. Because the ruling class are so scrutinized for having advantages,

[18:19] there are such generous endowments for those Ivy League schools that most people who don't come

[18:24] from the ruling class can get significant financial aid for going there, making the trade even

[18:30] more worth it. So if we look at the scoreboard between college and not college, we're dead even.

[18:35] And so let me just give you my honest opinion right now. So I'm looking down at my life four years

[18:40] in the future and I see college and I see career me, which one do I choose? So if I started going

[18:46] down the college path, if I come from a wealthier family, then I don't get the benefits of college

[18:52] and I incur the debt. So that might not make sense. On the flip side, if I am less fortunate

[18:59] coming from a less fortunate family, so significantly, then I do get a better benefit from college.

[19:04] And I will likely get some sort of financial aid increasing the differences between what I pay

[19:09] and what I get. And I have a new network, so my zip code improves. That might make a lot of sense for

[19:16] me. If I'm super well off, then I already have the benefits of going to college and I might as well

[19:21] start my career with those benefits already, not incur debt and make four years more income

[19:28] and be four years further in my career path, provided I don't want to do science, technology,

[19:33] doctor, lawyer, account, and stuff. If I'm lower socioeconomic status, then I might not have the

[19:41] same benefit and I might find myself in the bottom part of that circle that represents the statistics.

[19:47] Not to say that you're not the one of eight people who can earn more, it's just less likely.

[19:52] So given those variables, where do we go from here? If I came from a lower educated,

[20:00] lower socioeconomic family and get financially significantly, I would say 50% or more of that tuition,

[20:06] I would say go to college. You pay less for what you get and you get more than anyone else does.

[20:12] On the flip side, and this is counter-intuitive, if you already come from a highly educated family

[20:17] and you have higher socioeconomic status and you're not going to get favorable financial terms,

[20:23] forepaying for school, it makes less sense for you to go. The counter-intuitive thing here is that the

[20:28] rich families, the better off families, are the ones that encourage their kids to go to college

[20:33] the most. I'll even say they encourage them, they expect it, they demand it. It's assumed, it's the default

[20:38] choice. This box is already checked for them at birth. If you get no benefit from college and it costs

[20:45] you money. And four years of otherwise career development, then you shouldn't do it. The big caveat

[20:52] off the top is, if you want to go into one of those careers that requires a degree, it requires a degree.

[20:57] It is what it is. But I will say this, if you don't have a plan for what you want to do with your life,

[21:04] don't expect that $200,000 and four years is somehow going to give you a plan. You just need

[21:10] to confront the fact that right when you graduate, you're still going to be looking at life

[21:14] with all the directions coming from your feet and being like, well, what should I do now?

[21:18] Because I can promise you, even if you fell in love with a class, there's no career path

[21:23] that's the class. And so it doesn't even mean anything to get good to that. And so once you get

[21:28] to the real world, you're like, why loved biology? Well, unless you're going to be a scientist

[21:32] or you're going to be a physician, you're probably going to go into HR. It makes way more sense to

[21:37] actually learn what the departments of a business are and what those roles in tail on a day-to-day

[21:43] basis and think, well, these are the types of things I like. If I like talking to people,

[21:47] I could be a recruiter for a company. If I like talking to people, I could be in sales.

[21:51] As somebody who employs almost a thousand people now between our portfolio companies,

[21:54] we don't care at all what someone's degree is. You know what we do care about? Experience.

[21:59] So if I had a four-year college graduate who comes out with a philosophy degree,

[22:03] and I've got somebody who's been in sales for four years and didn't have a degree in the same age,

[22:08] who do you think I'm picking for the sales job? The guy who's been in sales for four years.

[22:11] If I were decided between going to college and not going to college, this is what I'd be thinking

[22:15] about. Now, if you're not going to college and you've made that decision, let's talk about how to

[22:19] actually maximize that path. Number one is that you are still prioritizing education. You're

[22:25] just not prioritizing formal education. So you should absolutely take money, take time,

[22:29] and spend the majority of your day trying to learn. If you play video games all day and you just

[22:33] watch Netflix and you smoke weed in your parents' basement, you're going to be the seven out of eight

[22:38] lose. But if you are the type person who can work all day and work on themselves and get

[22:45] experience in the real world, then you can learn at your job all day, get paid to learn,

[22:50] take that money, spend it on learning more in the evenings, and four years from now, you will be

[22:56] so much better equipped than anybody who is graduated four years in a formal degree who just knows

[23:01] how to shock and to be really fast. I will tell you how I've learned everything outside of school.

[23:06] I pay people who already have the skill by the hour to learn. Now, if I can't afford them,

[23:11] I will see if I can buy a course or a book or watch their videos or whatever it is. But if they

[23:17] don't have any of that stuff and you're just saying, man, I really want to learn how to do storage

[23:20] units from this guy. Well, then you can ask to pay for one hour a week to learn what to do, and I can

[23:26] promise you entrepreneurs and people who have skills are always happy to help people who take initiative.

[23:32] There's nothing that fills someone's heart more, speaking from personal experience of someone

[23:36] you ask you for advice, and then execute on it. And as long as you do that, you will have more

[23:41] help than you know what to do with. Start one or two steps ahead of where you're at, pay to learn

[23:46] the skills, and then take one or two steps. Whether you're taking this path or you're taking this path,

[23:52] you have to choose to invest in your ability to learn so that you can earn in the future more than you

[23:57] are. Everything that you make in the first four years of your career is not what you're trying

[24:02] to get rich on. It's what you're trying to get smart on, and the fact that you get paid for it

[24:06] is just bonus. So don't get your ego caught up in the fact that you're making $30,000 a year, $40,000 a year,

[24:11] or minimum wage. I started at minimum wage after having a weight collar job for two years, and getting

[24:16] a above-harvest Minsk war. And so you have to take a slice of humble pie to realize that I might have

[24:21] been really good as a management consultant, but I didn't know shit about running a gym. And so

[24:25] not coming in pretending like you know something that you don't. And being willing to accept the

[24:29] fact that someone who might be less educated or less polished than you still knows more. Now,

[24:34] if you get into the Ivy League school, then borrow me. It's like I said, go. But if you don't get

[24:38] into one of those schools, and you're just into the middle of the pack that costs too much and

[24:42] doesn't give you anything extra, then I think that you need to pull up to the table, put the

[24:48] napkin in your collar, and take a slice of humble pie, and realize that you don't know everything,

[24:53] and you have to be willing to suck, and you also have to be willing to be doubted by your family,

[24:57] because they probably won't agree with this decision. Because they're going to think, well, this

[25:00] worked for me, my life is great, and I want the same for you. But remember, they're doing this

[25:04] out of love for you, because they want you to win. But you just have to explain to them,

[25:09] I want me to win too, and I think times have changed. When they came out,

[25:13] hierarchy and tenure mattered a ton, and pedigree, where it's today, because everyone has equal access

[25:20] to information for free on the internet, and you can learn more on YouTube than you can for most

[25:25] colleges, you don't need what once was required. So, big picture, you don't need to stress.

[25:31] You're going to win either way if you're a winner. This will probably just get you their

[25:34] faster with less debt. On the flip side, if you are born in a bad zip code, you have a family

[25:40] that the majority of them has not gone to school or any kind of formal education, and you don't

[25:45] saddle your family or yourself with debt in order to go to school, it almost always makes sense to

[25:50] go to school. Because all you're doing is you're getting a different network of people, you will

[25:55] then change the trajectory of your progeny, your family tree that comes after you, and all you

[26:00] do is you start four years later, and again, you have all the earning potential benefits of

[26:03] going and getting a bachelor's degree, but without all the costs. And you've got a real value

[26:07] of college, where somebody who started with an advantage doesn't. And so in that sense, it absolutely

[26:12] does make sense to do that. I'm going to as many credits as I can, and I'm doing that so I can

[26:18] meet as many people as humanly possible. All right, so that's where you sign for the social clubs,

[26:22] sign for the sororities and fraternities, go to all the things that you can. Your luck surface area

[26:27] will increase with the amount of people that you expose yourself to. And it will also introduce you

[26:32] to a lot of diversity of opinion. And if you're going to college because we want to change your

[26:35] environment and change what you compare yourself to, then the best thing to do is get exposed to a

[26:41] lot of different things. And if you find yourself in a position where you have a hard time not

[26:45] partying as much, not to say that you can't party, have fun. But if you're slacking at school,

[26:51] you're paying to go to school. It is your job to learn. And you need to treat it like that.

[26:57] You're paying, not even getting paid, you're paying a thousand dollars a week to get educated.

[27:04] And you're going to have to make up that thousand dollars later on with interest. And so you

[27:09] better fucking learn something while you're there. And so the idea of the fifth year senior

[27:14] and taking 12 credits a semester, the bare minimum required to be a full-time student,

[27:18] what a joke. Take 18, take 21 credits, and do it in four years. You can grab it,

[27:24] gradually, double degree. I just graduated in three. I cut a year off. Right? If you can go to

[27:28] summer school, you can also save money. And you can still get the same benefits. And so you can

[27:33] graduate in two years or three years if you absolutely hustle your ass off because you are a

[27:37] professional student. Act like one. The TLDR is in either of these paths, you are choosing to learn,

[27:44] not earn. The money goes in different directions, but that is the objective. And in both of these

[27:50] career paths, objective number one is being a professional. And you're either being a professional

[27:56] student or you're being a professional student that just happens to get paid for it. But in

[28:00] either situation, learning comes above everything else. The side benefits are that you'll meet a

[28:06] few more people in your party a little harder. The side benefits here that you're not going to

[28:09] go and debt and you're going to get paid to do it. I want you to know that I am more impartial than

[28:14] probably anyone else in your life. And I say that because I don't know, and I don't know you,

[28:17] and I don't know anyone else in your life. Now they will get status based on their friend group who

[28:21] are older or might not understand stuff like this video. And so they want you to do that because

[28:25] one, it probably comes from a good place. But two, because they're afraid of their downside of

[28:30] what if you become a failure. But by the way, you become a failure if you go to college too. So

[28:34] the one thing that you can do to guarantee this is that you have to decide for yourself. Number one,

[28:38] and number two is that either of these paths is education. And you have to understand that you're not

[28:43] getting into the workforce to go make money. You're getting into the workforce to learn better

[28:46] more relevant skills and just happen to get paid for it. As long as you keep that clear and that you're

[28:50] going to stay disciplined about it because you're not going to be more necessarily disciplined when

[28:54] there's tons of naked girls and parties around you. And some of you're like, I'm sold on college

[28:58] by that alone. I get it. But I promise there's plenty of time for both. Send this to anyone who is

[29:05] debating this decision right now. Thank you for playing the game of 1 of 0. I hope you win.

[00:00] business owners, I think we can all agree that one of the most important things that

[00:02] happens as we grow is that we learn frameworks.

[00:06] And that's why when you look back at what you used to accomplish years ago, it seems

[00:10] like you could fix those problems so easily because you have frameworks with which you've

[00:13] learned to think.

[00:15] And so it took me six years to build my first eight figure company, six and a half to

[00:19] build my first eight and a half figure, sorry, multiple figure company, because that was

[00:23] the same company.

[00:24] The next company that I did that was multiple figures was it took me a year to build and

[00:30] the one after that took me six months.

[00:32] And so we've gotten faster and faster and faster at doing this and I've done over 120

[00:36] million in sales across different industries.

[00:38] And one of the key frameworks that I've developed or helps me think through things, I

[00:43] still want to share with you today.

[00:44] All right, so there's kind of three levels, employees or talent, right?

[00:50] This really applies to you or your team itself because at the beginning it's you, right?

[00:57] And so depending on where you're at, you may be at one of these levels or you may have

[01:02] to recognize it and others.

[01:04] And I'm going to say in three different ways, so I have a nice little nine, nine grid

[01:08] here.

[01:09] The simplest way to think about this is in the beginning, you have to learn what to do,

[01:14] all right?

[01:15] These are the skills, right?

[01:17] And that's because what you are in the beginning is an individual contributor.

[01:20] All right?

[01:21] I mean, you actually have to get things done in order for them to happen, right?

[01:26] And so what you're doing at this point is you're doing, right?

[01:29] All of your time is spent doing the things, right?

[01:32] Learning what to do, et cetera.

[01:35] Now the reason it's really important to be able to recognize where you're at is because

[01:39] then you'll be able to look through this framework and immediately see what you need to

[01:41] do next.

[01:42] To the same degree, you may have gone through this but not have recognized the shifts and

[01:46] you can look at an employee and say, I think they're in this bucket, I think they're in this

[01:49] bucket.

[01:50] I think they have the potential to get to this bucket, et cetera.

[01:52] Many times people will stick at one level because of their own beliefs that they have

[01:57] about themselves, which is why we, you know, layling, I believe that identities very fluid

[02:02] if you want to be successful because you have to be able to change what you think about

[02:05] yourself in order to become the thing that's going to debottle neck the business.

[02:09] Because ultimately, it's costing every single human on earth a billion dollars a year, not

[02:14] knowing how to create a billion dollars a year in revenue.

[02:17] That's how I always think about this.

[02:19] It is costing me so much money.

[02:20] My ignorance is costing me so much money.

[02:22] Hopefully with this video, I'll break down some of the other things that you won't be

[02:26] ignorant to so you can recognize them and other people.

[02:28] Level one is understanding what to do, which means you're an individual contributor and

[02:32] what your time is spent is do it.

[02:35] The second level here is understanding how.

[02:40] You started to do it, the what you figured this out.

[02:43] Then you have to figure out how you're actually doing it.

[02:46] The reason for that is because the next level you become a manager.

[02:51] That's making sure that other people can do that thing and they're consistently executing

[02:55] at a level of that works.

[02:58] Here what you're doing is you're teaching.

[03:01] You're teaching other people to do the thing.

[03:05] At the beginning, you're doing as an individual contributor.

[03:08] You have to focus on what it is.

[03:10] The next level you're doing, you're doing all the doing and you're like, you know what,

[03:13] feel like I understand this better.

[03:15] I feel like I understand the sequence of how this works.

[03:18] Then you can teach other people how to replicate that skill.

[03:22] At the very end, I'll show you how to apply this to departments in a second.

[03:26] Stay tuned for that.

[03:27] This is level one as you're looking at yourself or an employee.

[03:31] Level two is, oh, I think this person could teach other people.

[03:34] They could manage them.

[03:35] As a quick caveat here, not every manager is not necessarily needed to know how to do something

[03:40] better than an individual contributor.

[03:42] It's always going to be niche expertise, et cetera, but they should understand how it works.

[03:47] This is just an important nuance to note there.

[03:51] The third level is what I look at is the who.

[03:57] I know this may sound odd.

[03:58] It's what and then how then who.

[04:00] That is what it evolves to over time.

[04:03] The title here is a leader.

[04:06] These are very different than managers, which is something that I had to realize as

[04:10] I was scaling the business.

[04:12] Usually at this level, this is where you're at your three-ish million dollar a year level.

[04:17] This is what allows you to crack open to the million plus per month and level so 10 million

[04:23] pluses you have to have leaders that are engaged.

[04:27] The thing that you're doing here is you're systematizing.

[04:32] I'll say this in different ways too, because it's worth noting.

[04:36] Building the machine that builds the machine.

[04:42] The reason that's important is because first you're doing it, then you're teaching

[04:47] it and then you need something that can teach it for you.

[04:51] That's kind of how this works.

[04:53] It's not delegating it, it's systematizing.

[04:56] It's trying to be thoughtful about what Word I was going to use there because it's delegating

[05:00] it is it is it handing off, it's systematizing it.

[05:04] There's a lot of different ways you can build a machine that builds the machine.

[05:07] If you think through this in terms of your own frameworks, the reason that I like this

[05:12] is that you can actually grade yourself in terms of where you're at, you can grade yourself

[05:15] in terms of where a team member is at, and you can even grade departments within your

[05:22] business, which depending on what your size is, your departments might just be things that

[05:26] you were doing.

[05:27] If you're a partner, for example, then you wear all the hats, you're fine, answer your

[05:31] charm, your legal, your IT, your marketing, your sales, your product, your fulfillment,

[05:35] your all of those things.

[05:37] As you grow in the beginning, you'll have your first core team of probably five people

[05:40] and each one of those functions, you'll have somebody who helps you with delivery, you'll

[05:44] have somebody who helps you with finance, you're just bookkeeping, maybe somebody helps

[05:48] you with marketing, maybe that's you, somebody helps you with sales, et cetera.

[05:52] What you can do is you can look into the department and say, what level am I involved

[05:56] here?

[05:57] And eventually the goal is that you can move, right, move above, right, me equals, you

[06:03] know, CEO.

[06:04] And so you have a team of leaders who are building the machine that builds the machine

[06:08] for you so that the actual whole thing works without you being there besides providing

[06:15] the vision and strategic insight for making decisions.

[06:18] And so for me, I define this within a business where I'm no longer on the Slack channel.

[06:24] So in our portfolio companies, if I am no longer on the Slack for that company, meaning no

[06:28] one can reach me besides the one person who's in charge for that company, that is what

[06:32] I believe is a truly delegated business as a portfolio where you were actually an owner.

[06:37] Right, I can't say them out of time, it's like, I talk to entrepreneurs.

[06:40] And they're like, oh yeah, I could totally take this new project on, like, my business

[06:43] is totally systematized.

[06:44] And I'm like, dude, like, no, it's not like your phone's blowing up twice since we've

[06:49] been on like, what sense we've been sitting here talking?

[06:52] Like, yeah, I mean, just because you don't have to respond to something in the moment,

[06:56] doesn't mean that you don't have to eventually respond to it or make a decision or

[07:00] et cetera, right?

[07:01] Like, those are things that are still levels of involvement that require your existence

[07:05] and presence.

[07:06] And so for me, it's if I'm not in the Slack channel, I have one meeting a week with

[07:11] the owner of the, sorry, owner of the, with one of our portfolio companies, the manager

[07:16] operator, et cetera, of a portfolio company.

[07:19] And between that time and the next time, the company can continue to grow without my

[07:24] direct involvement, that is what I would say is checking all the boxes for me.

[07:28] And if something's not checking all the boxes, you can check all the boxes at a business

[07:31] level, but you can also just look at this as a department level.

[07:34] And the reason I think it's so important is that it can give you a grade that you can look

[07:38] at to improve.

[07:39] So you might have marketing and you might have sales and then you might have product and

[07:45] then you might have shared services which would be like IT, legal, HR, all that kind

[07:50] of stuff, right?

[07:52] And you can look at yourself and think, okay, do I have in sales, for example, do I have

[07:57] people who can, like, either one doing the sales, okay, well, maybe I'm not doing the

[08:01] sales, well, I'm the one who's teaching people to sell.

[08:03] Okay, well, have I built a machine that teaches people how to sell so that I don't have

[08:06] to do the teaching of selling.

[08:08] So I can actually just bring people in on a consistent basis and get them up to speed.

[08:12] That's where you start looking at hiring one, two, three salespeople a month, right?

[08:16] And you put them through the machine that builds salespeople, right?

[08:19] And so you can look at these levels within each of the departments.

[08:22] So maybe that's where your sales is at, right?

[08:25] You've got a machine that builds the machine.

[08:26] Awesome.

[08:27] But is your marketing there?

[08:29] Do you have a machine that builds the machine there?

[08:31] Or are you still doing?

[08:32] Or are you still teaching people, right?

[08:34] And here's one of the things that, I think, for me, it took a long time to realize this

[08:39] up.

[08:40] It's actually your strengths, oftentimes, which becomes almost always the bottleneck in

[08:45] the business because the things that you don't know, your far more comfortable giving

[08:49] away to people so that they can build these things, right?

[08:52] Because they've better expertise because they know how to do, teach, et cetera.

[08:55] And that's where you as CEOs entrepreneur is, you actually have to walk them through these

[08:59] things.

[09:00] So, you know, you know how to do, whatever it is, the delivery of your product, you toss

[09:06] them and I do that.

[09:07] It's a great, now I need you to teach someone.

[09:09] How to do that so we can build a team of people who are doing that so we can scale, right?

[09:13] And then finally, at a certain point it's like, man, I'm spending all my time teaching.

[09:15] It's like, okay, well, we need to build the machine that does the teaching for you.

[09:19] And so I think if you can think through this framework for each of the departments that

[09:21] you have in your company, you'll figure out where your bottlenecks are and it will

[09:24] at least give you a grade.

[09:25] And so every quarter, you can look at your business on a little sheet like this,

[09:30] and think, okay, do people know what to do?

[09:33] Do we have the base skill?

[09:34] Okay, do we have the sequence, the how to do it, right?

[09:37] Teaching people step by step how to do this process, right?

[09:39] And hold them accountable.

[09:41] And then finally, can I find somebody who can help systematize and build the machine

[09:45] that builds the machine that recreates the skill over and over and over again and other

[09:48] people, right?

[09:49] And so that's kind of the process.

[09:50] And which interesting, if you listen to Reed Hoffman, founder of LinkedIn, he talks

[09:54] about the difficulty for most employees, most people, to jump these levels.

[10:01] It's very difficult for most people, which is why especially like rapid growth companies,

[10:06] they'll often have to change out, I'll say, leadership with quotes here just anyone who's

[10:11] in charge because in the beginning there's probably more managers and over time there

[10:14] need to be leaders and a lot of times the managers, despite their tenure, aren't actually

[10:18] leaders, right?

[10:20] And so when I'm looking at talent within our own business, I'm thinking, okay, who's

[10:23] a good individual contributing?

[10:24] And sometimes sometimes, sometimes, amazing leaders are terrible individual contributors.

[10:27] And sometimes, a lot of, oftentimes, good individual contributors are terrible leaders, right?

[10:32] And so it takes a very unique person, which is why being on first so hard is that you

[10:35] have to really master all of these levels so that you can recognize it and teach it

[10:38] to other people.

[10:39] Because ultimately what we're doing is we have to walk the path that every person who is

[10:43] behind us must walk, which is why entrepreneurship is such a growth oriented occupation,

[10:49] you have to grow yourself in order to attract people who are at a certain level, right?

[10:55] Like imagine, if you were to start working for somebody and you feel like you know way more

[10:59] than them and that they just have no idea what they're doing, right?

[11:03] Then it's unlikely that you're going to be very influenced by that person, that person's

[11:06] not going to inspire you to do anything.

[11:09] On the flip side, if you were to start working for somebody and you aspire to be like

[11:13] them, you like their character traits, you love the way they operate in their personal

[11:16] life and how they do business, et cetera, then that is somebody that you were being

[11:19] led by.

[11:20] Right?

[11:21] And so for us as entrepreneurs, like a lot of times we have to think like how can I improve

[11:23] my character, what are the traits of my that are deficient, so that I can hopefully inspire

[11:29] people that I can bring people in at this higher level and then actually be able to execute.

[11:33] Because I can't tell you the amount of times I can't even, like, I'm always on the

[11:36] printers that I talked to, I said 95% of them are like, oh my team is amazing, I love

[11:39] my team they're awesome.

[11:40] And at the same time, they have all these horror stories about teammates and I can't say like

[11:44] I'm not a time I've talked to them, they said their team was awesome and I talked to

[11:46] them non-months later like, oh no that's you wasn't awesome, this team's awesome, right?

[11:49] And like, dude, you're the perspective of what you make judgments is flawed and I don't

[11:53] believe anything you say because every time you've said this it has been wrong, so why

[11:56] would I believe differently now?

[11:58] And so these are the levels that I think of for myself, my employees, departments and

[12:02] then ultimately the business, this is just a different way of thinking through it, hopefully

[12:06] it's valuable for you.

[12:07] If you have these frameworks, you can look at your own businesses, apply things faster and

[12:11] break through the bottlenecks that you have so you can get to where you want to go.

[12:19] you keep being awesome in a couple of short-year-olds.

[12:22] Bye!

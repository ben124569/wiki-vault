[00:00] When I was a wee lad, a young man, I lived on $1,500 a month and believe it or not,

[00:05] during that period of time while splitting the room, slipping on the floor with another dude,

[00:10] I was taking on about $1,500 a month. And the reason that I lived like that is because,

[00:14] hey, I'm incredibly risk-averse, but be because I wanted to have money to go on the offensive later.

[00:18] If you don't know how I am, I'm an Eves Oximosi, O'Neck, or just not come.

[00:20] It's a portfolio of companies. There's a $2,000, $2,000,

[00:22] make these videos because I want you to make shit loads of money and make a big company so that

[00:26] someday we can partner together and take a $200,000. And beyond, for me,

[00:29] making 20-grat a month was never an amount of money that I wanted to brag about or feel like I had made it.

[00:34] I wanted to shoot really, really big. This was only stuff that was going to be stepping

[00:37] since for me to achieve what I wanted to later. What I want to do in this video is I'm going to

[00:41] break down how's it to live for so cheap. This is for all the same guys, all the same ladies.

[00:44] And if you can live with your parents, even better for me, somebody would have died. It was for the

[00:48] best that I didn't have to live at home. This is what I actually did in order to live at $1,500.

[00:52] Or less. And I did that eating out every day. There's three big cost centers. You got transportation.

[00:57] You got living and you got food. So food wise. Some of you guys have seen mojie meals, meal hacks,

[01:03] the things that I do at these chain restaurants. And I did it that way because I don't like cooking

[01:08] and I wanted to have more time to make money. But made more financial sense for me to not take

[01:12] eight hours on the Sunday to go grocery shopping and prep on my food versus me getting jupole twice a

[01:18] day, which is what I did. At the time then, 15 dollars a day. Today is 20 bucks a day, 30 days in

[01:23] row, $600 a month. You can also go to Panda Express, which has a phenomenal 110 gram of protein,

[01:30] hack, with extra chicken. So you could have 200 grams of protein every day, recommend it.

[01:34] Third best option is Chick-fil-A is one of my favorites. They are on the price of your side. Just go with

[01:39] a 220 packs of chicken nuggets and get in close to 12 bucks. You should load a meat or two sandwiches

[01:44] either way. You'll end up in that 10 to 12 dollar range and you'll be at that $600, $700 a month

[01:50] range. And if you're like, huh, did he really do that? I sure did. That's all I did. I picked

[01:54] between Chick-fil-A, Panda Express, and Chipotle. And that's what I lived on. So much to this point,

[01:59] that Layla didn't know that we were going on dates. But for me, these were the finest

[02:03] establishments that I was frequenting on a regular basis. They knew me by name and they knew

[02:07] that I knew how to work the menu. So first step was mojie meals. And that for me,

[02:10] time to money-wise was worth it. When I would go to the grocery store and I would get all the

[02:14] fixings and all the stuff I spent 150 dollars in a week. And I ended up spending $600 a month

[02:18] as a single guy when I would grocery shopping and did all the prep and all the clean versus me

[02:22] running out next door, grabbing the food, eating it, heading back. And it was a nice month to break

[02:26] for me. I ate cheap. And as craziest as this may seem, it is easier to figure out how to get all of

[02:32] your calories in eating out stuff ahead of time. The absolute cheapest route, which I'll tell you right

[02:37] now, loaves a bread, peanut butter, cheapest thing in the world. And if you really want to make sure

[02:42] that you're covering your basis, get them all to you. You can live on it. If you want to add a third

[02:45] staple in there, you can add lactate milk if you're very sensitive. If you get your protein,

[02:48] you'll get your carbs, you get your fat in. If you want to be extreme on it, you can be extreme.

[02:52] For me, I didn't want to live on peanut butter sandwiches. I did eat them when I was trying

[02:56] to bulk up, but I did those in addition to my normal calorie intake. And to that degree, you might

[03:00] want to do one of those mojie meals and then do peanut butter and milk is the other one,

[03:04] which is a nice cheap in between. Reason this is so important for everybody who's watching this.

[03:07] You got to know how to live cheap so you can save up two buildings of business you want so that you

[03:12] can invest in the skills and the experience that are going to make you money. Number two is transportation.

[03:17] This is where mojie mobiles came in. There's lots of ems when it comes to mobiles, meals,

[03:21] and mansions. From the mobiles standpoint, the most efficient way to own a vehicle is to purchase it

[03:27] in cash, a used vehicle that has ideally between five and ten years old. Any place in America right

[03:34] now today, you can find a used four door vehicle that is between five and ten years old,

[03:39] four ten thousand dollars. You don't want to have car payments. The only thing you really have to

[03:42] manage is car insurance, which is not too expensive and here's the cool part, the cheaper your car,

[03:47] plus the insurance. You are young and you're living on six hundred dollars a month for mojie meals,

[03:52] and you live on a hundred dollars a month after you've made your one-time capital expensive actually

[03:56] getting the car, which I recommend doing and not taking loan for it. All you have is your mansion,

[04:00] your Shatt toe, where you're going to rest your head at night. I lived in Southern California.

[04:04] One of, if not the most expensive markets in the United States, I was in Costa Mesa,

[04:08] was where I lived, and after I slept on the floor of my gym, which is the first place, which

[04:13] technically was zero, but at the same time it was five thousand dollars a month, because it was my

[04:16] actual rent for my business. I then really splurged. I ended up having a member at my gym,

[04:22] say, are you really sleeping here? I said I sure am. Another member was having me sleep at their place

[04:26] for free. I was able to move from the free place to my own blaze, which is really in quotes here.

[04:31] We split a single bedroom in a seven bedroom house. He and I were roommates, not housemates, room mates,

[04:39] and I had one mattress that I got off Craigslist and put on the floor. Fan next to my face,

[04:45] because it's really loud, by the way, so you can not have to hear what someone else is doing,

[04:48] three other bedroom at a couple. There were three dogs in the house. My roommate had a dog,

[04:54] another couple had a dog, and another couple had a dog, and one of the couple's had two dogs,

[04:57] and then they were both big. So there was marking a territory that was shit and piss in the house

[05:02] every day, fucking horrible. My half was 400 bucks a month. If you're in like North Carolina,

[05:07] or you're in Boise, Idaho, you can probably get a room for $400 a month without having to split it.

[05:13] Big picture here. I would recommend you go to the place where she's happening, $400 a month,

[05:17] that you'd spend to be in an area where things are going on and people are doing things with their

[05:20] lives to get out of your area of the world where nothing's happening and your friends are still

[05:25] in the same place and your parents don't encourage you and think this internet shit is weird.

[05:29] Tell you to stop watching videos on YouTube and trying to hit it. Better yourself and just tell

[05:32] you to get a job, whatever it is. If you want to get out of that environment, it is worth the $200

[05:37] $200 dollars month. The easiest thing to do is to connect with people online, join communities,

[05:42] join discord groups, join Facebook groups, whatever it is. Trying to figure out where there are pockets

[05:46] of them because people congregate. You can find pockets of people that have similar goals to you

[05:51] and get around them. Every move for the first few years of my career was only to be around people.

[05:57] As long as you're a person who is going to hustle and people see it, people will open doors

[06:01] really. Move from SoCal to Puerto Rico briefly. From there, we move to Irvine and then Albuquerque,

[06:08] New Mexico because I had people there that I wanted to learn from and I didn't know anyone else

[06:12] besides this one couple. If you just say, hey, do you know any of you else who lives in this area?

[06:15] And this is where like now the world's even more connected than it was a decade ago. So you're a lot

[06:20] in SoCal. So you're a lot in Miami. You see a lot of New York, a lot of Chicago. And a big thing here,

[06:24] if you see Cleveland rich is not the same as SoCal rich. Not the same as New York. It happens is you're

[06:32] standard of excellence raises. In some ways, you feel worse about yourself but to the same degree,

[06:38] it shows you what's possible. My recommendation is to use that as inspiration. It's possible.

[06:43] They're made of the same flesh and bone as I am. Therefore, I can't. And when you get around

[06:47] people like that, they start talking at different time increments and different money increments.

[06:50] If you're hanging out with or talking in terms of weeks, talking in terms of paychecks,

[06:54] talking in terms of $100,000,000 investments, you gotta be talking to people who are talking about

[06:58] $100,000 investments. We're talking about years, talking about decades. You can judge

[07:03] how wealthy people will be by how they talk about how they allocate resources, time and money.

[07:09] And the increments that they measure those. I've moved a lot faster in life through handshakes instead of

[07:14] hacks. Who introduced me and opened way more doors than any whatever did. Getting around the

[07:19] who a lot of times it's hard to measure but when I look at all the big deals that I've done in my

[07:24] life, all been one or two degrees connected from people that I met. One recommendation that I have for you.

[07:29] Don't turn down the first invite. Connect with somebody at a thing that's like, hey, let's grab dinner.

[07:32] If you make that first one happen, the likely that you end up staying friends and connecting is

[07:36] significantly hard. If you turn down the first invite, it shows that you're not as interested. They

[07:39] also turn out your counter invite and it becomes this whole thing. And I'm just saying like,

[07:43] one big move is just make it work on the first invite. When you go to that meeting, do some prep work.

[07:49] Do 30 minutes of research on the person you're going to meet with and try to bring something

[07:54] valuable to the table. Now it might be your skill and you just apply it to them and this is the

[07:58] thing. This is a fucking hack. A life. No one wants a free patio. Like hey, you got a buddy who

[08:04] builds patios. You don't have a patio. You have a couple of people bid for it. Everybody's like,

[08:08] hey, I'll build it for you, right? He says he'll do it for free. And you say, sure, cool, I'll save

[08:12] some money. The other guy said they can do it in four weeks. He starts taking four weeks and then,

[08:17] you know, a third of the way, don't you say, oh, I'm working on some other jobs. It'll be around

[08:19] to work on it later this weekend. And now it's eight weeks and it's still, you know, halfway

[08:23] done. And it's 12 weeks. Now you start to fucking hate the guy. The thing is is that if you want to do

[08:27] somebody a favor, if you really want them to take it as a favor, blow them away, make them feel

[08:34] awkward for the amount of work that you did. And if you've never had this experience, I can promise

[08:38] you, I've been on the receiving end and it is uncomfortable. Fuck, I owe this guy something. And

[08:42] the nice thing about this, you just provide value. You go in and you don't just probably a little

[08:46] bit of value. You actually do what a fool's go at project would be for whatever it is that you're

[08:50] good at and you just set it up for the dude or you've spent a whole day walking them through how

[08:54] you do this stuff. And you're like, well, how do you find the time for that? You work all the time.

[08:57] That's how you do it. This is work. It's investing in the long-term relationship that you're

[09:01] paid to ventilator. Does that mean that I'm going to give to somebody and I might not get anything back?

[09:05] Yes. Did you say you want to be an entrepreneur and make the world a better place? That's what

[09:09] it looks like at a micro level. The ultimate leverage that you can have in a relationship is not

[09:13] need anything back. If you do that, you can be the guy that stacks I owe you and then when you do

[09:19] need to make your move. Because you are going to do the next thing, then you've got all these blank

[09:23] checks for any of the cash in and that is how you can propel yourself way faster and you just load the

[09:28] deck early when you don't need anything. The time to dig the well is not when you're thirsty,

[09:33] but when you have enough water so that when you are thirsty, it's there. Now we can go in the offensive.

[09:38] My plan B was always strip at night drive Uber during the day and I'm dead serious. If you're

[09:43] making less than 60,000 years, I don't understand why you wouldn't take that car that you saved up for.

[09:49] That's got four doors. It's 15 years or younger. There's no visible damage on it. You got those three

[09:54] check marks. You can drive Uber. It is the most flexible job. You can make money immediately. There's

[09:59] no risk besides the actual vehicle itself. You can work whatever hours you want. You can do it on

[10:04] separate apps and when I say whatever hours, I said there's flexibility but also how many hours you

[10:08] want. You work 12 hours a day if you feel like you're living on 1500 bucks a month or less.

[10:11] It's been 20, making another 200, have saved up after taxes so I could go in the offensive again.

[10:17] If you know it doesn't cost you much to live, your risk tolerance goes up because you don't have

[10:23] other shit to worry about. Real cost of the shit that you can't afford or shouldn't be

[10:28] affording right now. You're paying for the car but you're sound repicing your dreams. You're paying

[10:32] for going out with the boys at the club buying a table, getting bottle service, buying girls,

[10:37] drinks, I've said boom, 100 bucks. Boom, 200 bucks in a night like what just happened?

[10:41] That's half my rent. You become less dangerous because it's very hard to fight someone who has nothing

[10:47] to lose and it's very hard to fight someone who can live on nothing. We had to pick between

[10:52] living on $10,000 a month and making $10,000 a month or living on $1500 a month and then spending the

[10:58] spread if you spend $5,000 a month, $3,000 a month, $2,000 a month on your education so that you can increase

[11:05] your earned in capacity. It's hard to be stopped. Side note, if you can get competitive with yourself

[11:11] and how little you can spend, recommend. One of the other hacks that Dave Ramsey has that

[11:15] of a huge fan of is taking out the amount of money that you're going to spend for the entire month

[11:18] putting it in your wallet and leaving it there. Don't spend more than that period. That's it. That's all

[11:22] you got. You were one of these people who wants to credit card hack. Get 2% here and I get 1%

[11:27] here and I get 3% here. You're focusing on the wrong fucking percentage side. If you're trying

[11:31] to be financially disciplined, just fucking be disciplined. So I get asked a lot about the income

[11:35] to spending ratio. I never had one. That's because I just try to maximize both sides. How can I

[11:42] hack the game to spend as little as humanly possible period? And then how can I hack the other

[11:46] side of the game make as much money as I possibly can? I just saved every dollar that was at food,

[11:51] transportation, living. The other way of doing this is getting competitive with your bank account.

[11:55] One of the habits that I highly encourage you to do is that every morning what's the first thing

[11:58] you check is that Instagram? Is it YouTube? Is it your texts? I'll tell you the first thing that I

[12:04] check the mornings when I was in this period of my life. It was my bank account. Every day I wake up and

[12:08] I'll check my bank account. And what happens when you do that is to develop this muscle of kind of this

[12:12] understanding of the money flow. It might be un-inventful to check your bank account every day. But

[12:17] if I can give you a habit that will make you a lot of money, it's just like weight loss. If you get

[12:21] on a scale every day and you're trying to lose weight and you don't do jack shit but you literally

[12:26] just get on the scale every day people lose weight. Drawing and putting awareness to the problem

[12:31] or the thing that you're trying to change improves it. If you're in a business and you want sales to

[12:34] go up start tracking everything. If you just start reporting publicly on close rates and put

[12:40] a leaderboard up, sales go up. Think about this from a human behavior standpoint. Punish bad behavior

[12:44] with yourself as quickly as possible and you want to reward good behavior as fast as possible. So you

[12:48] do more of it. That's why you check the bank account every day. Start seeing it go up and you get this

[12:52] little ticker and it goes up and if you really want to be a G about it, this is how I did it.

[12:56] Check your bank account and you have a Google sheet on your phone and every day I put my balance

[13:00] in. And if you can start getting addicted to getting personal records in your bank account,

[13:05] like if I can give you the one gift of this is to gamify it. The people who make the most money,

[13:10] they think about money as a game and the best way to do that is early on. Track two things.

[13:14] Check your bank account and you put it in. And what's nice there is that you can start seeing

[13:18] long-term trends. When I would look at that trend, I got a tremendous amount of good feeling.

[13:24] I would look at it and be like, I fucking did that. And every month, it'll get a little bigger,

[13:27] a little bigger, a little bigger, and you start feeling progress for the sacrifices that you make

[13:31] every day. Because you look at where you're at this month versus last month and you see progress.

[13:35] So if you want to improve your money situation, you got to check it. You've got to look at it every

[13:38] day. And the first thing in the day priority means it is happening prior. It's more important.

[13:44] So you wake up, you make money priority, you check your bank every day, you start

[13:48] getting a pulse on what's going in and what's going out. What's going in? What's going out?

[13:52] You look at all of the classes that go in, you look at all the minuses and next month you try

[13:56] to make that column go up and that column go down. You keep running that cycle. And I promise you,

[14:01] if you actually look at your bank account every single day, even for 90 days, 90 days,

[14:06] it will be amazed at what goes in there. Like, huh, they didn't even know I still had that out.

[14:09] Most people getting excited. They avoid the things that they don't like.

[14:12] Got to confront it. I'm fucking poor. Don't want to be poor. I'm going to look at this money

[14:16] until eventually it starts paying attention back to me because money sticks to the person who pays

[14:20] at the most attention. This is how the economy works. The person in two parties who pays the most

[14:25] attention is where the money ends up.

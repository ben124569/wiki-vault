[00:00] You're not making as much money as you want because you're working on the wrong stuff.

[00:03] You're chasing opportunities rather than solving problems.

[00:06] So a problem is something that threatens the future livelihood of your business.

[00:10] So it decreases the likely that your business will continue to exist.

[00:13] So for example, if you get customer complaints from your product, that is a problem.

[00:18] If your processor, you know, relationship becomes a red flag, that is a problem.

[00:23] Your sales team starts dropping conversions.

[00:25] That is a problem.

[00:27] These are things that threaten whether or not you're going to be alive tomorrow.

[00:31] Now, the second bucket are missed opportunities.

[00:34] These are things that you are not doing, but you should be doing in your business that could

[00:38] expand or grow your business.

[00:40] Here is the fundamental problem.

[00:42] In my life, I have almost equally colored them the same as just things to do.

[00:48] I need to fix the sales team. I also need to get this email follow-up campaign redone because it sucks.

[00:54] Right? Or it's not there to begin with.

[00:57] We need to get this re-targeting across all platforms. Why aren't we doing that?

[01:00] And you probably have this list of what I consider should do.

[01:03] Right? I know I should be doing all these things, but I'm not.

[01:06] And so this is where this gets really painful for the entrepreneur myself included, which is,

[01:12] we only have limited resources.

[01:15] But our list of should-dos is unlimited.

[01:19] The amount of opportunities taken to their natural extreme is that you have a business that sells

[01:24] everything to everyone. Think about it.

[01:26] At every point, there's, oh, we could have a product here.

[01:29] That's an opportunity for revenue expansion.

[01:31] Oh, we should add in this other channel.

[01:33] That's a possibility or opportunity for revenue expansion.

[01:36] And so what ends up happening is that over time,

[01:39] everything feels like something that you should do.

[01:42] And then over time, your list just gets longer and longer and longer.

[01:47] And unless you delineate, which thing is a problem,

[01:50] and which thing is a missed opportunity, you will get way overwhelmed.

[01:55] So this is why I think this is so crucial.

[01:58] Missed opportunities are typically more fun.

[02:03] They're exciting, they're new things, they're shiny, and that's why us entrepreneurs love pursuing them.

[02:09] The reason that I talk about focus and the woman that redress so often is it's because

[02:14] it's the thing that I struggle with to this day most often.

[02:18] And so half of these sermons probably more than half

[02:20] are actually just me yelling at me to be clear.

[02:23] Now, these are really fun and exciting.

[02:26] And they tend to be around the things that you love.

[02:28] And so if you're a product person,

[02:29] you're probably going to have a lot of product should do's.

[02:32] If you're a marketer, you're probably have a lot of marketing related should do's.

[02:36] If your customer's success related, same thing.

[02:38] So if your finance, same thing.

[02:40] Whatever your thing is, tends to be the thing that you like doing the most up.

[02:44] And that's where you tend to see the most missed opportunities,

[02:47] because that's where you spend the most time.

[02:48] You can always see the next step, the next step, the next step.

[02:51] And you keep wanting to grab those other things and bring them to your business,

[02:54] because you see how much money that we're

[02:55] quote leaving on the table.

[02:56] Problems on the other hand, suck.

[02:59] And they're not fun.

[03:00] And it's usually you going into something that you set up once and having to fix.

[03:04] You thought it was going to work, but it's not being executed properly,

[03:07] or there's some key problem that you didn't expect.

[03:10] It's basically you did something a new piece of information came to light.

[03:13] And now you have to do something about it.

[03:15] The reason beyond what I just said of why you shouldn't focus on the missed opportunities,

[03:20] because there's obviously so many of them, and taking to the natural extreme,

[03:22] it's literally everything.

[03:24] It's also because when you prioritize miss opportunities,

[03:29] you grow your business.

[03:30] But guess what else happens, you grow your problems.

[03:34] And so if you have not solved your problem,

[03:36] before growing the business, that problem just gets bigger.

[03:40] Some of you guys may have noticed that I've been making a little bit less content lately.

[03:44] And so I've been super busy on this big missed opportunity.

[03:48] I put it that way.

[03:50] And I've been pouring tons and tons and tons of hours into this big new project,

[03:54] like massive thing for 2025.

[03:57] And Layla basically came to me and she was like, I'm dying over here.

[04:01] Like, I need your help. I need you back.

[04:03] Right? Like, your head's not in the game.

[04:05] Like, we're doing business every day, and you're over here trying to build the future.

[04:09] And the thing is, this is not a problem to be solved,

[04:11] is that dichotomy to be managed.

[04:13] If you're the visionary entrepreneur in the business,

[04:15] it's normal for you to live three months, six months, a year plus out.

[04:19] That's normal.

[04:21] But you can't take your eye off the ball from today.

[04:24] And so for me, this was a pendulum that I was swinging too far in this direction.

[04:28] And so she was like, dude, you need to make some content.

[04:31] You're not spending any time on it.

[04:34] And so to give you context, I think over the last two weeks we've had,

[04:38] have we even had a scheduled recording session?

[04:41] Yeah. So we've had about one, we've had one recording session last week.

[04:45] And this is now one today.

[04:47] And the ones that I was going to, I wasn't as prepared as I should have been for those sessions.

[04:54] I was like, all right, what are we talking about today?

[04:56] And the team kind of basically gave me the talking points.

[05:00] And so for you guys, it may not be content, right?

[05:03] It may be, you need to make ads.

[05:04] It may be, you need to be looking at the outbound team.

[05:06] It may be our customer successes failing.

[05:08] Whatever that thing is, it was the thing that's hard.

[05:12] Right? And so for me, like, I, it's like,

[05:14] despite the fact that everyone thinks that I'm a content creator,

[05:16] this is not my main job.

[05:18] Right? And so my life is not as, you know, as much as I try, right?

[05:23] As much as I try to make more content, everybody, like, it's not, it's not the main thing still.

[05:27] And so, um, but I let it get away from me.

[05:30] And so the thing is, is like, I've given, I've learned to over time, give myself a little bit of grace

[05:34] and saying, this, I will never solve this.

[05:36] It is unsolvable.

[05:38] But it's simply about percentages of the pie that I'm going to allocate to now versus the future.

[05:44] And I get a little bit too over indexed on the future.

[05:47] That's in my nature.

[05:49] And so I have to over emphasize the present.

[05:52] Because this, if this doesn't work,

[05:55] then that will never happen anyways.

[05:57] And I think Leila has always been so grounded in today.

[06:01] And I've been so grounded in the future.

[06:02] That's been our Yen and Yen, but we both try and mean the,

[06:05] I have to pull her towards the future.

[06:07] We should be like, hey, let's, like, this is where we're going.

[06:09] This is, we have to build this way to get to here.

[06:12] And she's like, yeah, but that's a massive pain for me.

[06:14] And I will tell you something that I have, and I'll take me far too long to learn,

[06:17] is that it's easier to solve small problems than big problems.

[06:22] And so, when we're thinking about putting the sequence of what things were going to prioritize.

[06:28] By the way, the TLDR of this is this is strategy.

[06:31] Strategy is prioritizing limited resources against unlimited opportunities.

[06:36] These are things that you could do with these resources versus the resources you have.

[06:40] And so, if you have a fixed pull of resources,

[06:42] the first things, and this is like, I'm relicking at my list right now,

[06:48] are the things that probably suck.

[06:50] They are the problems.

[06:51] And that is where you can spend or should spend, in my opinion, your time.

[06:56] Because when you solve your problems, guess what else also happens.

[06:59] You grow.

[07:00] You would like my team to go over that list of things that you have,

[07:05] to grow your business.

[07:06] The things that are the missed opportunities and also the problems.

[07:09] And give you a step by step plan to solve those, because we probably have solved them for businesses

[07:14] just like yours, because we have a lot of different companies,

[07:16] probably bigger than yours in the portfolio.

[07:18] And so, if you'd like that, we are holding workshops here in Vegas.

[07:22] This is my actual portfolio team.

[07:23] We hold them one or two times a month.

[07:25] And so, if that's at all interesting, you can go to acquisition.com,

[07:29] and you can click the scale button.

[07:30] And if you're business qualifies, we'd love to see out here.

[07:33] Opportunities can grow your company.

[07:36] Problems solve also grow your company.

[07:38] But when you solve problems as you grow, you get growth through getting better.

[07:44] When you grow through capturing missed opportunities,

[07:49] you grow through doing more.

[07:50] And to be fair, I have no problem with growing through doing more,

[07:53] but I do have a problem when more also creates more problems.

[07:58] And so, if the goal of the entrepreneur is to

[08:02] allocate resources across the entire company to achieve the best returns,

[08:07] then we should be allocating more of our time towards solving problems

[08:11] that are coming up in daily basis.

[08:13] When you have a business that no longer has problems,

[08:17] you will grow by default.

[08:19] And so, my allocation of resources has gone in this direction.

[08:23] Now, I want to zoom out and make this super tactical for you.

[08:26] You probably look at data, hopefully, if you follow my stuff, to any degree,

[08:31] on a regular basis. Now, if you're early on, you have to go gather that data from tons of

[08:35] places. As you get more advanced, that data becomes pushed to you via dashboards or direct reports.

[08:40] People present those things on meetings. It's the first slide.

[08:42] And then you talk about the data.

[08:44] So, I want to give you a 201 level hack here that will change how you run your business.

[08:48] Number one, the data that you choose to display must be there for reason.

[08:55] One of the biggest problems that I see across our portfolio companies, and even within

[08:58] our holding company, is that my record ports and my employees

[09:03] often overreport because they know I love data.

[09:06] And so, there's like, look at all of this data that we have.

[09:09] But if you present me a piece of data and a change in that data does not result

[09:15] in a change in behavior, it is a waste of time.

[09:19] And so, right now, if you look at the data and you're like, okay, we're trending in this direction.

[09:24] If you ask the hypothetical question, if we max this out, would it change what we're doing?

[09:30] If the answer is no, then you should stop looking at that piece of data. It's noise, not signal.

[09:36] And so, when you're making the decisions for your business, the data that you look at,

[09:41] you should clearly know and your team should know what behavior this data influences.

[09:48] If our average view duration drops, then it could be from a number of reasons.

[09:52] But if it does drop, are we going to do something about it and what are we going to do?

[09:57] This also will target your discussions or orient your discussions with your team.

[10:03] And so, if they come to you and say, hey, we want to run a meeting about this,

[10:08] the end result of every meeting should be a change in behavior.

[10:12] It should be what are we going to do? Now, if someone says, hey, I want to report these trends that we're seeing,

[10:18] cool, and I'll give you a really recent one that happened.

[10:22] I had a vendor for a platform a while ago, and the vendor was telling me, hey, we should go for

[10:29] shorter versions of this type of content. And I was like, okay, why? And he said, well, because

[10:36] when we shorten it, a higher percentage of people watch it, or consume it. And I said,

[10:42] why do I care? What does the view duration or listen duration have to do with any of the metrics

[10:49] that we have in this business? Can you prove to me that us getting a higher percentage of people

[10:55] viewing a shorter piece of content in some way drives our business? Now, if he then said, yes,

[11:01] pieces of content that have higher average view duration or average listen durations,

[11:05] then create more shares than I would say, got it done. We're doing it. But if you just report,

[11:12] oh, we should do this because it improves this metric, how does that metric tie to getting us more

[11:17] customers or making customers worth more? If you can't tie why this thing or this metric that we

[11:24] somehow track tracks to this, I do not care. And the reason I think this is so important is that we

[11:30] have such limited attention in business every single day that if someone's going to buy or bid for

[11:37] our attention, they better damn well have a good reason for it. And also, your team is limited as well.

[11:44] They are human beings too. And so they have many people, they've got slack messages, they've got emails,

[11:49] they've got meetings, and then they have the work that they're actually supposed to do. And so,

[11:53] if you have a quarterly, for example, and you have your whole team there, if you aren't clear

[12:00] about what change in behavior, the data is going to create, you are wasting your time and theirs.

[12:07] If after that day or after that meeting, you go back to business. You might as well have just taken

[12:14] the day off, wrapping this back to problems and missed opportunities. You will probably have

[12:20] significantly more data around your problems than you will around missed opportunities.

[12:24] missed opportunities are going to be purely hypothetical. We think if we get this percentage

[12:28] to be able to convert and they pay this price, this is the revenue uplift that we have potential

[12:33] to capture. All of this is hypothetical. Fine. On the problem side, we have to look at what

[12:40] thing we're going to change to fix this problem. And so this is how we do it. We have four steps.

[12:46] All right. So if you're writing this at home, then this is the writer downer part.

[12:51] Number one, is the condition or the goal that we are trying to, the problem we're trying to solve.

[12:56] All right. This is how this is current. This is desired. Cool. Next thing is what is

[13:02] the action? What are we going to do? And this is to be clear a hypothesis. Our turn rate is at

[13:10] 5%. Okay. We hypothesize that if we do a 101 reach out to every customer as they enter our

[13:18] you know, by our product, we will decrease turn. That's the hypothesis. It's an action

[13:24] tied with what we expect and the reason for taking this cost on because it will cost you money to

[13:29] do this, cost resources. The third bucket. And this is the fun one. Did we do it or not? So this is

[13:37] the before and after. So we have the problem. Here's how we hypothesize it. We have what data that

[13:42] we want to affect. So turn rate was the percentage. We wanted to go down. We hypothesize that's

[13:47] going to go down by this much. Cool. That's the before. The after is did we do it or not? Very simple

[13:54] because you can have this whole hypothesis. Get to the end of the quarter, get to the end of the

[13:58] week and say, oh, we didn't really do it. Okay. Well, then we didn't test the hypothesis.

[14:03] Now here's the fun one. Let's say you do it. Did what we expect to have happened happen?

[14:10] Because we're guessing that if we do this thing, turn will go down. But we could do the thing

[14:16] and turn could remain the same. And so it cost us time and it cost us money, but the problem

[14:21] remained unsolved. And this is the nature of business. And this is why your second business

[14:26] grew way faster than your first business because you already knew the solutions to the

[14:29] problems that you're going to create along the way. And then you run smack into problems that you

[14:34] don't know how to solve. And this is why I'm I want to hit on this so hard. You're not growing

[14:40] because there are problems that you need to solve that you're not solving because they're not fun

[14:44] and you don't know what to do. So instead, you're doing more of the thing that you know to do

[14:50] around opportunities, but you still have not solved the problem. And you've done this enough times

[14:55] that you've now grown the problems to the point where it's stifling your business. And so you have to

[15:00] stop. And so you have to look at that big to-do list that you have. And you have to think which of these

[15:07] are problems that I need to solve that will make us better and as a result of being better,

[15:12] grow our business and which of these are opportunities that are missed, that we think that we

[15:17] could do but aren't doing yet. I would encourage you to take that entire list of missed opportunities,

[15:23] the MOs and just move them somewhere else and what I have is something called Alex's big money-making

[15:30] idealist. Everybody in the company knows about this. I have more ideas than we have capacity to implement.

[15:36] And I have learned through many years of working with Layla that I actually only get maybe one

[15:42] out of 10 or 20 that I actually get to do because you don't have unlimited shots on goal.

[15:49] That is the problem. So Jeff Basos has the saying that at the beginning of this book,

[15:53] I'll actually read it to you because I think it's so significant.

[15:57] Outside's returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom and conventional wisdom is

[16:02] usually right. Given a 10% chance of 100 times pay off, you should take that bet every time. But you're

[16:07] still going to be wrong, nine times out of 10. We all know that if you swing for the fences,

[16:11] you're going to strike out a lot but you're also going to hit some home runs. The difference

[16:15] between baseball and business, however, is that baseball has a truncated outcome distribution.

[16:19] When you swing, no matter how well you connect with the ball, the most runs you can get is four.

[16:24] In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs.

[16:28] This long-tailed distribution of returns is why it's important to be bold.

[16:32] Big winners pay for so many experiments. Now, here's the one flaw and I best know this is much

[16:37] smarter than me, much richer than me. But there's one flaw with the analogy.

[16:42] If you go to a casino and you have a 100x payoff and you've got a 1 out of 10 bet, then you should

[16:49] make that bet every time under one assumption that you can bet as many times as you please.

[16:55] Let's say you go to the casino and it's a $10 minimum bet and the bets 100x payoff, but you only have

[17:02] 20 bucks. You're only going to get two swings, which means the likelihood that you fail entirely

[17:09] is 4 out of 5. You have a 20% chance of actually winning an 80% chance of losing period.

[17:16] And so this is, in my opinion, a more realistic take of what it's like to be a business owner.

[17:21] We do not have unlimited swings. We do not have unlimited resources. And so we have to be incredibly

[17:27] measured with which swings we choose to take. And so the highest likelihood swings are the problems

[17:34] that need to be solved in your business today. These are the sure money. These are the as soon as you

[17:40] solve it, you cash it in. The things that are certainly not certain is the missed opportunities that

[17:46] are purely hypothetical. And so, if you solve all the problems that you have at a current level,

[17:53] once you get to that and there are times where you get there where everything's kind of humming

[17:57] along. That is when you look up your big missed opportunities list, your big money-making

[18:02] idealists. You say, now, which of these will I take? And here's the interesting thing.

[18:07] If you do this, you will find that many of the ideas that you were jazzed about two months ago,

[18:13] now you think are stupid because you found out more from solving the problems that actually give

[18:17] you more information that this is actually not a missed opportunity. And so it increases the

[18:22] likelihood that the swings you do take, the big swings do result in the big payoff.

[18:28] And so, this is like the ultimate sleep on it. Like if you have an amazing idea,

[18:33] don't tell them right then because you're going to oversell everybody and oversell yourself.

[18:37] If you sleep on at the next day you're a little less psyched. If you come back to two months later,

[18:40] you'll be amazed at how many of these things you just won't even want to do anymore. And think

[18:44] about how stupid it would be if two months later, after looking at all your ideas, 90% of them

[18:50] you don't want to do anymore. It means that every one of those things that you shove down your

[18:54] teams throat because you were excited about it was a mistake. It was you failing as an entrepreneur

[19:00] because you got to distracted. You got to excited about Shiny object. You got to into the stuff that

[19:05] you like rather than confronting the stuff that you hate that will absolutely grow your company.

[19:10] This is something that I'm personally working on and I'm heated about it because this has been

[19:15] such an epiphany for me in terms because I love any frameworks that allow me to better prioritize.

[19:21] That allowed me to be a better strategic thinker for my business. And so this operationalizes better.

[19:27] What you guys can expect from me is I will be prioritizing making more content for you guys.

[19:34] I hope you guys have liked the deeper content stuff, like the real business stuff. I think right now,

[19:38] I'll tell you honestly, we settled on a 6-1 ratio. So basically five out of every six videos are going

[19:44] to be deep business stuff. Like if you guys haven't seen the last three videos that I put up on

[19:50] YouTube, especially the one before last, there's a banger case study on what we did to make 3

[19:56] million bucks, more profit on one of our portfolio companies to increase customer satisfaction

[20:01] course, decrease refunds and charge backs, increase ascension rates by over 40%. Just by fixing our

[20:07] onboarding process in this particular business. And so every company needs some sort of onboarding

[20:12] process. Whether you're a physical product business, you're a software company, you're a service

[20:17] business, you need to have that stuff. But guess what? That was a problem and it was a problem that we

[20:23] solved and it immediately made us more money. And we should have put more attention on that even

[20:28] sooner because the reputation that we would have would be simply better. So like the early

[20:34] you create that amazing customer experience, the more customers who go through it, the more people

[20:39] have positive things to say about you. And so I say all this to say one main thing.

[20:46] Confront your problems today. Forget about your opportunities for tomorrow. Put them on the

[20:51] big list. Once you've solved all the problems, go revisit the list and then pick the one that has

[20:58] the highest likelihood of yielding the biggest return for you and then go all it on it. If this

[21:04] content was valuable for you, check out either of these two videos.

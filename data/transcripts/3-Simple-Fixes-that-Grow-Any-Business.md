[00:00] I'm going to solve three massive business problems

[00:02] that can take you from 10 to $100 million.

[00:04] And at the end, I'm going to walk you through the framework

[00:06] so that you can apply this to your business,

[00:08] your work, or your personal brand.

[00:10] I recently spoken to Vent and had a Q&A section,

[00:12] and there were three different business owners

[00:14] that presented with different problems.

[00:16] One was an employment setting business,

[00:18] and they knew how to set appointments

[00:19] and build up on teams for agencies,

[00:21] coaches, consultants, whatever.

[00:22] The second business was a marketing agency

[00:24] for HVAC business owners.

[00:26] So the third was actually very big influencer.

[00:28] We were 30 to 40 million subscribers

[00:29] across all platforms with the objective

[00:31] of making more money.

[00:32] So each of them had very differently phrase questions,

[00:34] but they were all suffering from the same constraint,

[00:37] and it wasn't what they thought it was.

[00:38] So the first business that asked a question was an employment setting business.

[00:41] And he was saying that his problem was

[00:43] that he needed to get more customers,

[00:44] which, by the way, most time that's not the problem.

[00:47] It's usually because the customers you have,

[00:48] keep leaving, and that's the real problem.

[00:49] And when we look at businesses to invest in an acquisition.com,

[00:53] we operate off of a singular concept,

[00:55] which is the theory of constraint.

[00:56] A business will grow up to its constraint,

[00:58] and then it will grow no longer with us entrepreneurs,

[01:00] continue to work on the things that they enjoy

[01:02] rather than the things that the business needs.

[01:04] Usually because they haven't actually identified the correct constraint.

[01:08] For example, if you have a three step sales process

[01:10] and you get 50% to go through step one,

[01:12] five% to go through step two,

[01:14] and then 50% to go through step three,

[01:16] you could improve each of them by 10%,

[01:19] but which of them makes the biggest difference in your business.

[01:22] Going from five to 15 triples, the business,

[01:25] whereas the other ones only incrementally improve it by 20%.

[01:28] He had a very low quality customer.

[01:30] The vast majority of customers did make enough money.

[01:32] They did stay long enough.

[01:33] They didn't have enough skills, et cetera.

[01:34] That was what he thought he had to solve.

[01:37] Said, okay, of all of the companies that you've ever worked with,

[01:40] which of them made the most money off of the appointments

[01:44] that you set, right?

[01:45] And he had a very specific answer of what type of avatar he did best with.

[01:48] And so there's two directions for that business.

[01:50] One is you niche down on your service delivery

[01:52] and say, these are the only types of businesses

[01:54] that I'm going to take because they're going to be worth more.

[01:56] Stay longer, refer, et cetera.

[01:58] That is probably the easiest next step for that business.

[02:02] I were going to own this business

[02:03] and I transplanted my brain and my brain to get his body

[02:06] that she could own half of a 50 to a hundred million dollar business

[02:10] that he grows over the next five to 10 years,

[02:12] picking the most valuable business that he sets appointments for.

[02:16] What would the marketing spend be

[02:17] of a business that's doing $50 million a year, realistically?

[02:20] Probably somewhere in the neighborhood,

[02:22] I have to $10 million a year.

[02:23] So he could either partner with that business

[02:26] or spend a year to learning how that business works

[02:29] that then he owns both sides of it.

[02:31] If you partner, you can usually go faster.

[02:33] But you give up some of the upside

[02:34] because you slice the pie.

[02:35] It's up to you.

[02:36] Because most business owners, the reason they don't create

[02:38] valuable businesses is because they have to keep

[02:41] doing the same work over and over again

[02:42] and they don't get credit for it.

[02:43] But basically, sentence to this terrible,

[02:47] Atlas-like existence are rolling the border

[02:49] up the hill and rolling it back down every month.

[02:51] And if the team that he built was 50 outbound guys this month

[02:54] and then next month he starts at 50

[02:56] because it's all within the same company

[02:57] and then does another 50.

[02:59] And then another 50, six months later,

[03:00] he's got 300 outbound guys that are all

[03:03] still working for him all generating revenue

[03:05] that he is owning a slice of all of it.

[03:08] This is number two was the HVAC agency.

[03:11] This is a business that markets for HVAC companies.

[03:14] It 50 or so clients in that niche

[03:16] and their running campaigns across 50 different local markets.

[03:19] If he's able to generate leads and fill up 50 different

[03:24] HVAC services pipelines because of his marketing prowess,

[03:27] he probably has the marketing skill of a 50 to a hundred

[03:32] million dollar HVAC business.

[03:33] If you have a five million dollar marketing agency,

[03:36] then it's reasonable that some of the clients

[03:38] that you serve are making $50 million

[03:40] and revenue off the services you're generating

[03:42] and you're getting none of that.

[03:43] You're only capturing the service fee.

[03:45] The more steps you take towards owning the result,

[03:48] the more you're basically just doing the business for them.

[03:51] But at a certain point, you are the business.

[03:53] And so it makes sense for you to own the economics of the business.

[03:56] And either you've got to learn the HVAC business

[03:58] or you partner with someone who already knows it

[04:01] or you could buy one.

[04:02] And with your marketing prowess,

[04:03] you juice the hell out of it.

[04:05] Most people will try and buy it

[04:06] but then also try and keep this agency thing going

[04:08] but sometimes you've got to take a half step back

[04:10] so you can take 20 steps forward.

[04:11] A fastest way, build a $10 million business

[04:14] is often not the fastest way to build a hundred million dollars business.

[04:18] If you wanted to build a building,

[04:19] that was 10 stories tall, you would start with a very different foundation.

[04:22] Now imagine you built a 10 story building

[04:24] and then said, okay, I want to build a hundred-droid building

[04:27] using the same foundation.

[04:28] You wouldn't be able to.

[04:29] But that's exactly what most entrepreneurs do

[04:31] when they're trying to scale

[04:32] and they wonder why they're stuck

[04:33] is because they built it wrong to begin with

[04:35] because they were in the wrong opportunity vehicle.

[04:37] One of the big things that took me too long to learn

[04:39] is it's the size of the slice of the pie

[04:42] that matters not the shape of the slice of the pie.

[04:44] They obsess about the shape of the slice

[04:46] rather than having a slice that's like this

[04:49] of a much bigger pie.

[04:50] The average IPO founder,

[04:52] when a company IPOs owns 12 1.5% of the company they found it.

[04:56] Because the more people you make money,

[04:58] the more money you ultimately make.

[05:00] The third business was the big influencer business.

[05:03] 34 million subscribers across all the platforms

[05:05] and they were focusing all their attention

[05:07] on how do we get more high quality videos out?

[05:09] And when I asked them,

[05:10] what problem you trying to solve,

[05:11] they said we want to make more money.

[05:13] You're seeing your business as this box of media

[05:15] and trying to make more better videos,

[05:17] which if you wanted to brand

[05:18] and just continue to build a brand before making an ask,

[05:20] that would be the right problem solved.

[05:22] But they were at 97 out of 100.

[05:24] They were at 0.000001% creator.

[05:29] So do we really think that they're constrained

[05:30] if their business is that they aren't good enough at marketing?

[05:33] No, probably not.

[05:34] You guys are trying to take your 97 out of 100 media companies

[05:38] to a 99 out of a 100 media company.

[05:41] When the objective you said was to make more money

[05:43] and you have no product that you sell.

[05:45] So all of your monetization relies on sponsorships

[05:48] and ad revenue, which is typically the least efficient way

[05:51] to monetize because anyone who pays you for a sponsorship

[05:55] is making a huge arbitrage on your brand and your value.

[05:59] Give any amount of questions that these guys forget it,

[06:01] which when they don't make videos,

[06:02] we're getting 100 million views a month

[06:05] when they don't post anything now.

[06:07] That kind of thing is a company that's 100 million

[06:10] plus in revenue.

[06:11] So they have the marketing department,

[06:13] but what they don't have is a sales department,

[06:15] they don't have a product department,

[06:16] they don't have customers success.

[06:18] They have none of these other departments.

[06:19] There's zero out of 100 on all these

[06:21] and so the constraint isn't going 97 to 99.

[06:24] It's going from zero to 20 on these ones.

[06:27] What are the choices I have here?

[06:28] Version one is if I've got an advertiser,

[06:30] you're consistently comes to me.

[06:31] I may be able to negotiate some sort of equity

[06:34] and getting even 10% of a company that's worth $100 million.

[06:37] And then you put all of your effort behind it

[06:39] and make it a $2 or $300 million company.

[06:41] That's a significantly better outcome for many of them.

[06:43] Then what they're currently getting

[06:43] pages video to paycheck, right?

[06:45] The second option is to say,

[06:46] okay, is there a category of products

[06:48] that continue to pay me the most out of all the advertisers?

[06:51] Just do what Amazon does,

[06:52] see what's already selling and then clone it

[06:54] and make it your own and put your name on it

[06:57] and make your version yours and better.

[06:59] And if you do that, then you own the entirety of that thing.

[07:02] But in order to do that, you probably,

[07:04] if it were me, I would go snipe some of the topics

[07:07] that some of those companies and say,

[07:10] you're currently an executive here.

[07:11] Would you like to own a slice of my thing?

[07:14] I'm happy to own 70% and get three of the best guys over

[07:18] have them build their boxes behind my thing.

[07:21] That's the fastest and easiest way.

[07:23] The longer maybe bigger money way is if you do it all yourself

[07:26] but that's always the trade that you have to make as an entrepreneur

[07:28] how many skills do I have to have

[07:30] in order to pursue this new opportunity

[07:32] versus the ones I currently have.

[07:34] The third opportunity for them is probably

[07:35] at least operational risk for accepting the fact

[07:37] that they just like doing media

[07:39] and that's what they jam on and they don't.

[07:40] Want to touch either of these other business components

[07:42] and in the results as a creative shop

[07:44] that knows how to make viral videos

[07:47] that they can transform into ads.

[07:49] And that's where you go from being a really good creator

[07:52] to being a Madison Avenue agency that makes ad that crush.

[07:56] Most influencers are getting paid

[07:57] based on the impressions that they're getting

[07:59] the brand for free based on their audience.

[08:02] But where the real money is made

[08:04] is where you take that TikTok video

[08:06] that YouTube toward that Instagram video

[08:07] that it is and then they put a million dollars

[08:10] of ads been behind it when it's already shown as a winner.

[08:13] And then it goes from being shown to five million people

[08:15] in your audience to a hundred million people

[08:17] that it converts from cold.

[08:19] Ads been has no limit on reach

[08:21] as long as it's profitable.

[08:22] So they can always expand beyond your existing audience

[08:25] which means that you get to capture all of the upside

[08:28] based on how skilled you are as an advertiser.

[08:31] So those are the three paths for that particular type of business.

[08:34] It's not like okay, well I'm not one of these three businesses

[08:36] now what I should do,

[08:37] but it's actually the framework that we approach the problem

[08:39] which is one, what problem are we trying to solve?

[08:42] In each of these businesses

[08:43] they wanted to make more money.

[08:44] The next one is over what time horizon.

[08:46] If you want to make more money tomorrow,

[08:48] the number of things you can do is very limited.

[08:50] If you want to make more money in 10 years,

[08:52] you take a very different play.

[08:53] If the amount of time it might take to build

[08:55] a hundred story buildings foundation,

[08:57] might take the same time it takes to build the entirety

[09:00] of a 10-floor building.

[09:01] Above the surface, somebody else building a 10-floor building

[09:04] might happen way faster than you can.

[09:06] As yours is just continuing to build this base

[09:08] before you start building up.

[09:10] The next question which problem will we prefer solving?

[09:13] Or which problem we feel like we're more equipped to solve?

[09:15] Or which problem is easier?

[09:17] Because if you start framing it in terms of the problem

[09:19] that you're gonna have to solve to be successful,

[09:20] it actually makes it much more controllable for you.

[09:23] I would say, well, which of these do we feel more equipped to do?

[09:26] Now I think this is.com, we are really good at recruiting

[09:28] which is how we scale all the companies.

[09:29] We have as you root talent have already been there done that.

[09:32] And so we probably say, hey, we feel really confident

[09:34] that we could recruit somebody in and put seed capital

[09:37] into get it going, then we'd own the whole pie.

[09:40] So for us, that would be a problem that we feel very confident

[09:42] solving and gives us the most upside.

[09:44] You have to answer that for you, given your skills

[09:46] that your resources and your experience.

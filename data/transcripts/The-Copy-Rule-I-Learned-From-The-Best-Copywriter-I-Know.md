[00:00] What's going on everyone? I wanted to share the rule of one with you that I learned from Michael Masterson

[00:05] And if you haven't heard of Michael Masterson, he's the chief

[00:08] Growth strategist at a gore publishing which to my knowledge the biggest information seller on the market

[00:14] They do over a billion dollars here in revenue and he is the person who created their entire acquisition machine

[00:20] Which is teams and teams of hundreds of copywriters who generate

[00:26] demand

[00:27] through compelling words

[00:29] And I think there's something really magical about that because he not only has been able to do it himself and hit home run after home run

[00:35] And if a home run offer but he's been able to duplicate it in other people and create and get people who've never sold a thing to

[00:41] Writing copy that generates

[00:43] 20 million 40 million 80 million plus just from a single letter or message and

[00:49] In his book great leads

[00:52] The first concept that he introduces is arguably the most important

[00:56] And he calls it the rule of one and

[00:58] I've been I

[00:59] It was so important to me that I wrote it down and I have it right on front of my computer because it applies to almost everything

[01:05] But especially to communication and sales messages and so whenever he said the common thing that most

[01:11] Cooperators do were most business owners who were trying to make an offer

[01:15] To be compelling to a marketplace what they do is they just stack is many different

[01:19] Great things inside as they possibly can and then say well if that one doesn't work one of them will work

[01:24] So I'm just gonna throw them all in and he said

[01:26] That's the recipe for he calls toss salad copy

[01:29] Which is just you just jumble everything together and you hope, you know

[01:33] It's throw everything in the wall to see what sticks

[01:35] But the reality is the most compelling messages and he reviewed the top 100 offers of all times since they worked there

[01:42] 91 of them all centered around a single concept and so if you think about what that means

[01:49] It means that you're looking for the one big idea the one compelling message that has to be easy to understand

[01:56] easy to believe and

[01:58] Interesting or unique and so he said those are the three elements of a one big idea and so when you're thinking about the sales messaging

[02:06] And this has been really just I've been I've been putting this as a forefront of my mind is that when you're writing copy for a

[02:12] For an advertisement or you're writing copy for a landing page

[02:15] The sub bullets should only be bullets that reinforce the singular message or the singular argument

[02:22] Right they should be stories

[02:24] They should be arguments they should be facts that are presented solely to reinforce the singular concept, right?

[02:32] And so if I said you know, hey, there's six ways six ways to to

[02:38] To you know wake up early or something like that

[02:41] Or six morning strategies if each one of them was kind of different that's like it's a toss salad

[02:47] Whereas if I wanted to center it around one

[02:50] Big benefits or one core topic now the six topics that I could have on either of it are gonna still be sub points of the major one rather than

[02:58] You know 15 crazy headline ideas right and so for me

[03:03] That has been incredibly powerful and if you look at if you have advertised before and you look at the best converting

[03:10] Advertisements that you've ever had you will probably see that similar trend

[03:13] Where the ones that do best are the simplest the most direct and the clearest to understand

[03:19] Now the issue is when you only have to pick one it forces you to be incredibly

[03:26] Tactful on your selection because you're only going to pick one and so I think what that ends up doing is it forces us as marketers to really think is

[03:33] These things is this the best idea is this the most

[03:37] centralized

[03:38] focused concept that I can point as the tip of my spear of my communication message, right?

[03:44] And so a lot of these things around like any kind of unique selling proposition

[03:48] That's going to be the rule of one right you don't have 19 selling propositions

[03:52] You want to have one core one everyone can immediately understand is is counterintuitive and

[03:58] Is believable right and so when you put all three of those things together

[04:02] Then you have a message that's compelling and people will take one step towards you and so I have now like I said

[04:08] I wrote that at the top my computer and I've been writing copy and keeping this at top of mind

[04:13] Because I can guarantee you that even since I started doing this just even reading the book

[04:17] I've gotten the the copy that I've been putting out has been so much better and more targeted and crisper

[04:22] Because there's one central idea I'm trying to convince the reader or prospect of and then and then the sales message that follows is actually very transparent

[04:30] And simple to write the hard part is figuring out what that one idea is going to be

[04:34] But if you're going to think about one thing then that would be the one to focus on so anyways

[04:38] I hope that was valuable for you. I showed this stuff as it comes to me in my in my journey of marketing and and sales

[04:44] And so I hope you enjoy this like subscribe all that kind of stuff and I'll see you next video

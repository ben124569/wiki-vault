[00:00] Who's pumped about sales?

[00:02] Sort of pumped about, okay, so quick question.

[00:05] So I can cater to this two you guys.

[00:06] As I try and tell my team sometimes,

[00:08] I'm gonna talk fast, you can just listen fast.

[00:10] So, who here has one person or less

[00:13] that would mean if you were selling,

[00:15] doing the majority of the sales in your company?

[00:17] Can you get a hand raised?

[00:19] Okay, so like half.

[00:20] Okay, that's perfect.

[00:21] In the other half of you have a sales team multiple two or more, right?

[00:24] Okay, so the name of my lovely talk,

[00:28] it's gonna be the closer framework, all right?

[00:31] And so what I'm gonna do is break this up.

[00:35] It's a two halves.

[00:36] The first half is how you actually manage the conversation,

[00:39] that should say work.

[00:40] You get the idea, yeah, closer framework.

[00:43] And then the second half is how you manage the sales team,

[00:45] so you can get wicked consistent sales

[00:46] on a monthly basis.

[00:49] So first things, first, who here has ever struggled with?

[00:53] Inconsistently quality, inconsistent cack, right?

[00:56] You're like, I thought I was at a thousand and now I'm at 3000.

[00:59] My leads are shit, actually my leads are amazing.

[01:02] My sales team is underworked.

[01:04] Now they're overworked, they say there's too many,

[01:06] there's too few, they're not being efficient, it's set.

[01:07] Is anyone done with any of that stuff?

[01:09] Okay, cool.

[01:10] So I've run a lot of sales teams B to B,

[01:13] we did outsourced sales company, we had to fly two gyms,

[01:16] actually sell for them.

[01:17] So we'd fill them up in 30 days,

[01:18] armed with us actually flying people out in selling.

[01:21] So we've done a lot of sales, and this is the simplest framework

[01:24] that you can use.

[01:25] And so this is the first of the five Cs.

[01:27] So I tried to use markets as five Cs,

[01:28] so when you go home, you've got 10 Cs.

[01:30] Okay, so the first one, governs the conversation,

[01:34] so that's kind of the fur, everyone who was ready,

[01:35] this is kind of more of you over here.

[01:36] We're raising your hands about life, about one person,

[01:38] or it's me.

[01:38] This is the governing framework

[01:40] for how you make the conversation.

[01:41] C is you clarify why the person is there.

[01:48] Now when you use this framework,

[01:50] everything that's in your framework has to be a question only.

[01:52] Do not put paragraphs, do not put statements,

[01:54] because they will start reading them,

[01:56] they can't think that way.

[01:57] Only put questions, because they can pause,

[02:00] they can ask another question,

[02:01] they can pause, they can ask another question,

[02:03] and they need no intelligence to do that.

[02:06] Which means it's scalable, okay?

[02:07] So when you're asking, so all of these buckets

[02:10] are the buckets under which you want to create

[02:12] the framework that you're making your sale.

[02:14] So it's like, what made you get on the call?

[02:16] What's your goal?

[02:17] Why is that important to you?

[02:18] What would it look like 12 months from now?

[02:20] If this ideal outcome were to be achieved, right?

[02:22] Those are the clarification questions.

[02:24] Next, you label them with a problem.

[02:27] So what I'm hearing is, you've done X, Y, and Z,

[02:30] and the missing link has been X, whatever,

[02:33] is that right?

[02:35] Yes, got it.

[02:36] I now have a problem, you know, I've cancer, I can cure it.

[02:38] All right, next is O.

[02:40] We're gonna overview the pain, okay?

[02:42] So I'm assuming not the first person,

[02:44] you've come to try and solve this problem,

[02:45] so what have you done in the past?

[02:47] All right, I've done X, Y, and Z.

[02:48] Why did that not work for you?

[02:49] Obviously it didn't work because they're on the phone with you.

[02:51] All right, so you always have that advantage

[02:52] because they are on the phone with you right now.

[02:54] So you're over viewing past pain.

[02:56] We call it the pain cycle.

[02:57] You do that until they have nothing left

[02:59] and you're like awesome, and then you recap the pain.

[03:02] Then S, you sell the vacation.

[03:05] This is the only thing that your salespeople have to actually know.

[03:10] There's gonna be three stories that you're gonna tell them

[03:12] that they're gonna be illustrative of the thing

[03:13] that you were helping them solve.

[03:15] So an example would be,

[03:16] fitness nutrition and accountability,

[03:18] if I was trying to sell weight loss, right?

[03:20] You're usually missing one or two or all three

[03:22] of these things, that's why you weren't successful, right?

[03:24] You couldn't consistently work out.

[03:26] You couldn't consistently eat the right way,

[03:27] or no one was there to hold you accountable.

[03:29] So make sense?

[03:30] Yes, if you're selling leads,

[03:32] it would be like, you need your leads to be exclusive.

[03:33] You need them to be timely.

[03:35] You need them to be geographic, whatever.

[03:38] Like you're gonna find three things,

[03:39] and then you have to give a short,

[03:40] 30-second snippet of why that's important, right?

[03:43] If I was trying to illustrate accountability,

[03:44] I'd be like, hey, did your parents ever tell you

[03:46] to brush your teeth when you grew up?

[03:47] You probably hated it, you're like, no, I don't want to.

[03:49] And they kept doing it over time,

[03:50] and I'll bet you brush your teeth now, right?

[03:52] And you need someone to hold you accountable,

[03:53] so you can create the habit.

[03:54] Does it make sense?

[03:55] 30-second story?

[03:56] They understand it.

[03:57] That's the use of solidification.

[03:58] All right?

[03:59] Eat, explain away their concerns.

[04:02] Away concerns.

[04:04] Bob, Bob, you get the point.

[04:05] All right, that's where you're doing all of your

[04:06] options and overcomes.

[04:08] Crazy people buy without obstacles.

[04:10] Nor will people have concerns.

[04:11] You need to overcome them.

[04:12] These have to be drilled.

[04:14] They have to be drilled.

[04:15] So that means that you have flashcards.

[04:17] I need to think about it.

[04:18] I have to talk to my husband.

[04:19] I have to check with my partner.

[04:21] I have to.

[04:22] So there's only three, by the way, if you don't know what they are.

[04:24] It's price.

[04:25] It's stall.

[04:25] It's decision maker.

[04:27] All right?

[04:27] All you have to do is understand what each of those three are.

[04:29] If it's price, it's a discrepancy and value.

[04:32] They don't understand the value.

[04:33] If it's decision maker, what you have to do is rely on past

[04:37] agreements that are implied that that person is already communicated

[04:41] to the partner.

[04:42] So your partner knows that you're struggling with these things

[04:43] already.

[04:44] They know that you're looking for a solution.

[04:46] So why do you think they'd be opposed with you solving the problem?

[04:48] The journey that you have, that they don't agree with.

[04:51] Overcoming.

[04:53] This has to be drilled.

[04:54] Next one is, so we decision maker, we did price, and stall.

[05:00] All you're doing is teaching someone to make a decision

[05:02] because people don't like making them

[05:03] because they fear making mistake.

[05:06] Perfect.

[05:06] Halfway through.

[05:07] Okay.

[05:08] So what you're going to do is walk them through

[05:10] decision making process.

[05:11] So how do we make decisions?

[05:13] Either do you like me?

[05:15] Yes or no?

[05:16] Do you like the product?

[05:17] Yes or no?

[05:18] Do you think that we'll be able to help you achieve this outcome?

[05:20] Yes or no?

[05:21] Do you have access to this amount of money in your bank account

[05:23] or no someone who does?

[05:24] Yes or no?

[05:25] Yes?

[05:26] What card do you want to use?

[05:28] Right?

[05:29] Overcome.

[05:30] You make them confront the decision.

[05:31] Right?

[05:32] What you're making concern?

[05:33] Then they tell you they make concern.

[05:34] You overcome it.

[05:35] Close.

[05:36] All right?

[05:37] Last one is reinforce the decision.

[05:39] And I like doing this, and we included it after time,

[05:43] is that people back out.

[05:45] So how can we slam it on them?

[05:47] How can we get them super pumped?

[05:49] So immediately afterwards, that's the 30 second video from the founder.

[05:51] I'm like, hey, just saw you sign up for our software.

[05:53] Super excited to have you by name, personalized, head written card, t-shirt, any of those

[05:58] things, reinforce the decision, make the feet nice and hot.

[06:01] Makes sense?

[06:02] That's the closer framework.

[06:03] Every single one of these buckets has to be questions that are simple for them to

[06:06] ask.

[06:07] All right?

[06:08] So when you're organizing your script, this is the conversation we're going through.

[06:11] Does that make sense to everybody?

[06:12] Okay.

[06:13] That is the first of the five seas.

[06:14] Don't worry, the other ones are fast.

[06:15] And it's about how you manage your sales team.

[06:18] Okay.

[06:19] Don't worry, I'll be fast.

[06:20] So that's closer.

[06:23] The next one is, don't worry, I'm rocking, we're good.

[06:28] Okay.

[06:29] The next one, I should know these.

[06:32] That's okay.

[06:33] Okay, call recordings.

[06:35] And then I'm just going to write these down real quick for you.

[06:38] So you can write them down.

[06:39] Combs.

[06:41] Cut.

[06:43] Competition.

[06:44] Okay.

[06:47] So Marcus is much smarter than me.

[06:49] I think he's like the really classy, classy person.

[06:53] This is like from the streets closing 4,000 people.

[06:55] 101 sales, like weight loss, Susie's writing with her kids trying to write permanent

[07:00] marker on the wall and I'm trying to close her cut a cut.

[07:02] All right.

[07:03] So close the sequence to tell you manage the framework.

[07:05] Call recordings.

[07:06] If you're not recording every single fucking call that your people are on.

[07:08] One, you're not compliant.

[07:09] Two, you should do it because then they become more accountable to following the script.

[07:14] You also overview those.

[07:15] The tool that you need to use is gone.

[07:17] If you guys told me to zoom, the fucking best.

[07:19] So I can say, use going.

[07:20] It's amazing.

[07:21] Combs.

[07:22] You need to talk to your team on a regular basis.

[07:25] All right.

[07:26] The cadence there is daily huddles weekly 101s.

[07:32] And when you do the, and then obviously monthly.

[07:34] But the daily huddles are quick.

[07:38] All you do is you share testimonials.

[07:39] So they remember why they're selling.

[07:41] So they get beat up every single day with those.

[07:43] They need to remember why they're still doing it.

[07:45] All right.

[07:46] So if you're doing one's that you're doing.

[07:47] When you're meeting with them, you're going to have them tag you in three calls.

[07:50] They're best call.

[07:51] They're worst call on their average call.

[07:52] When you go over in the 101s, you're going to ask them to show you where they

[07:57] clarified the problem.

[07:59] Where they outlined the pain.

[08:01] And then where they asked for the sale and where they overcame objections.

[08:05] If they never clarify the pain and they've asked for the sale, you don't make money.

[08:09] So that way they always know that on every fucking call, you always ask for the sale.

[08:13] You can never make a sale.

[08:14] If you never ask for it.

[08:15] All right.

[08:16] That's what you're from the communication cadence.

[08:18] Cut.

[08:19] You've got to cut the bottom.

[08:20] All right.

[08:21] It's the number one thing that will drive sales teams is by cutting the bottom 10% you

[08:24] do it on a regular basis.

[08:26] It has to be on a regular basis.

[08:28] All right.

[08:29] Even if the team is going OK when you cut the bottom, you'll see a 30% jump in productivity.

[08:34] Every time.

[08:35] So if you can have a persistent 30% jump, why would you not do that?

[08:38] Does that make sense?

[08:39] Okay.

[08:40] Competition.

[08:41] Last point.

[08:42] Ooh.

[08:43] I'm good.

[08:45] Okay.

[08:46] So competition.

[08:48] Sales people are competitive.

[08:49] You have to have a leaderboard that is published, that they can see every single day, that they

[08:53] get notified when every other guy is making a sale.

[08:55] If it's super high volume, it could be end of day.

[08:57] But when they, you've got a bell if you're in person.

[08:59] If you're not in person, you can have a thread that should be all the sales guys

[09:01] digging.

[09:02] They can literally send it image or a gift of a bell.

[09:04] So it's like ring the bell, right?

[09:05] So that they know and it says volume, they can see it.

[09:08] There's activity.

[09:08] There's action, right?

[09:09] It's all of momentum.

[09:11] So leaderboard.

[09:12] That has to be checked every day, has to be updated regularly.

[09:15] That has to be on point.

[09:17] And then competitions, we found that six weeks works best.

[09:21] In terms of sending them on like closers, go to Vegas, or go to Bahamas, or whatever

[09:27] it is.

[09:28] And so we put them in three-man teams, and that tends to work really well, because they

[09:32] share best practices.

[09:33] They continue to work with each other.

[09:34] They root for each other so it's not as cut throat.

[09:36] It's just always having top dog.

[09:38] And in terms of how much to spend on that, 25% of one month's check is usually the

[09:44] amount per person that applies like that would be.

[09:47] So if you guys make 70, you might spend 1500 bucks to send per guy for like a three-day,

[09:52] or like a two-day weekend.

[09:53] It's not expensive, five grand, but it is worth every dollar.

[09:56] So to recap, if you want really, really consistent sales, use the closer framework.

[10:03] Everything has to be questions.

[10:04] Do not have statements, have 30 second stories.

[10:06] Record your calls, make sure you're sticking to the Comkidians, cut the bottom percentage,

[10:10] and keep it competitive so they stay in it.

[10:12] Thank you.

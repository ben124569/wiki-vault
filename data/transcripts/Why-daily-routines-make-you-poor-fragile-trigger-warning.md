[00:00] I'm probably going to piss a lot of people off in this video and that's not my intention, but

[00:04] you come here for the unalcer, you know, raw truth. And so that's what I'm going to try and provide you.

[00:10] Just FYI, my name is auctionebusie.ionacquisition.com. We do about $85 million a year in revenue.

[00:14] One of the biggest things that I talk about all the time on this channel in terms of how to grow

[00:18] is that there are three different components to growing a business, right? You have your skills as

[00:23] the entrepreneur, you have your character traits as the entrepreneur, and you have your beliefs. And what

[00:26] happens is most people continue to add potential to their business, but do not grow their business,

[00:31] because they're not focused on the thing that is to constrain. That's kind of the fundamentals

[00:34] of the theory constrain is that a system will grow to its constraint and no further. Basically,

[00:37] you grow until you are bottlenecked and then that bottleneck becomes the weak link in the chain

[00:42] so to speak, and then you cannot grow past it. And so people do all these other things, which add

[00:46] potential, they add strengths to the other aspects of the chain, they add, they re-fortify other

[00:51] aspects of the bridge, but not the weakest point. And so they actually never make more money and they

[00:55] stay because they have not attacked the constraint. And so last night, I was at a dinner with a

[01:02] couple of entrepreneurs, young, doing a couple of million bucks a year, and their constraint was so

[01:08] evidence to me that I figured I would make a video about it because I think it will be helpful for

[01:12] you as well. And so there's two things that I want to bring up. And what's interesting is that as I,

[01:17] when I talk to younger entrepreneurs, I would say younger being with quotes, last experience, whatever,

[01:22] entrepreneurs, they are outpournets are clearer. And what I mean by that is the red flags,

[01:26] the things that are limiting them are clear to me, then say people who are further along, right?

[01:31] And so with this particular couple of entrepreneurs, the limiter was two things, they were both based

[01:37] on character traits. And so I thought that a lot of times I talk about skills, I talk about beliefs,

[01:41] but I'm talking about character traits as much and I thought this would be a useful example for this.

[01:45] A couple of the statements they said throughout the dinner really rubbed me the wrong way,

[01:50] not personally, but just in terms of me looking out for another entrepreneur.

[01:55] They made I am statements, which are in my opinion some of the most powerful statements that you speak

[01:59] over yourself about what you believe to be true, right? And so they said, we are high anxiety people,

[02:06] we have lots of anxiety. And I don't even like saying it like myself to just make this video for you

[02:13] because of how much I hate that type of statement. The second thing I heard later on in the

[02:19] conversation, they said something to the degree of, I'm an all or nothing type person,

[02:23] like I either have to go full-send mode when I go out or I can't drink. Or a different example

[02:29] of that same concept would be like, I either have to train really hard and take all the supplements

[02:36] in the meantime or I just sit on the couch and you know it is. And when I heard both of these

[02:42] things and there were other traits that they brought up, but these are the ones that I'm

[02:45] remembering off the top of my mind. I paused and I was like, do you believe that that, do you

[02:50] think that belief serves you? I know like what you mean. I was like, do you think that that belief

[02:54] serves you? That you are all or nothing, that you will have to go full-send mode or you have to

[02:59] stay it. They're like, well, and really thought about it like that. The thing is is that when we make

[03:03] these statements and the thing is maybe the further on and the game you go and this is why I think

[03:08] mentors and having people outside of you, to speak into your life that you trust is very useful

[03:13] because they can hear you speak these limiting statements over yourself. I told the story before

[03:19] in the past but I'll say it again, I used to tell people that I was bad at math. Most people

[03:23] now would never consider that I was bad at math but people would say I'm pretty good at math.

[03:26] Right? And I thought I was bad at math until 2006. Think about that for a second. Like,

[03:30] until 2006 I thought I was bad at math. I think that crazy. Right? And I say this because there

[03:35] are so many beliefs that we speak over ourselves. These traits that we claim to have, we claim them.

[03:40] Right? As though they are ours but they are not. In order to grow your identity must be

[03:45] whatever is required to grow. Period. That's it. So if this season of your life requires you to be

[03:51] more assertive then you would say I have a tendency based on external circumstances to be more

[03:55] assertive in these types of conditions. Right? And so the language has to change towards I have a

[04:00] tendency towards, right? Or I have a proclivity for rather than I am, which is definitive certain

[04:07] and end of case meaning nothing can be done about it. And so if we can change the way we speak,

[04:12] we will change the way we live because we change the way we think. Number one. Number two thing that

[04:16] came up. So one was obviously all the IM statements. What I would say limiting character traits

[04:22] is they talk about their own traits but the traits are not things that serve them. And so if you

[04:27] have traits that you speak of yourself, you have to ask yourself, does this serve me? Does this serve

[04:31] me? Is this going to help me accomplish the goals that I have? And if it doesn't then stop saying

[04:36] it. So here's the second thing they did that was kind of the red flag for me.

[04:39] Apart from making this because I'm sure they're going to watch it. Crutches are dangerous.

[04:43] Superstition is dangerous. What I mean by that is that we have these things that we do

[04:51] these routines that we set. And the thing is is if we become dependent on the routine we actually

[04:57] become weaker as a result of it. And so that is why I'm always so sensitive to religious and I'm

[05:04] using quotes here. I'm using it in the literal word of religious. Religious adherence to routines.

[05:11] Religious adherence to how I have to wait. Like whenever you use terms like I have to I must.

[05:17] We should. I need to. These are all things that you're making statements about how the world

[05:22] must be when you have no control over it. And so if I wanted to conquer somebody who is a competitor of

[05:27] mine I would hope I would pray that they have crutches and superstitions that I can exploit.

[05:34] For example, if you have to drink a bottle of alcohol every night to go to bed that is a crutch.

[05:40] If you have to smoke a blunt every night to fall asleep that is a crutch. If you have to take

[05:45] animals every night to fall asleep that is a crutch. If you have to take pills every night to go to sleep

[05:50] yet it is a crutch. And I told you at the very beginning of this video I know this is going to

[05:54] piss a lot of people off. But believe it or not there were humans hundreds of years ago that had none of

[05:59] these things and they slept just fine. Hundreds of years ago there were humans who did not have coffee

[06:04] in the morning. There were humans who did not have pharmaceutical drugs. There were humans who did not have

[06:11] orange glasses. There are humans who did not have these weird rituals that we try and convince ourselves

[06:18] we must do. We have to do. We need to do. We cannot live without. And all the end of doing is

[06:23] because the thing is you have a level of maintenance of how you have looking for what ever.

[06:29] And so what happens is it is like when you start drinking coffee in the beginning you feel better.

[06:33] And then over time you need to drink coffee just if you are normal. And so then the benefit that coffee

[06:38] can first is going. And so if you really want to get benefits from things then you need to cycle the

[06:44] things that you do which means inherently you are not going to have a routine because the things that you are

[06:48] doing are constantly changing which gives you the temporary flux or benefit that it will confer

[06:52] you as a result of it being novel. If you are going to do it. But most people do it that way.

[06:57] Instead they become dependent on the superstitions about how they must go to bed every night.

[07:01] How they must fall asleep and what they must take and what they have to have their mornings

[07:06] or what. Or they create a punishment for themselves or I can't be productive or I can't think

[07:11] it straight or I'm really really agitated all day. It's so weak. It's so weak. It makes you so

[07:19] non-rezyliant that I would hope to compete against you. I mean I would hope that because I

[07:25] would just hope that something interrupts your magical routine and then fucks you for the day.

[07:31] I've always had the belief that I'd like to be able to sleep on a cot somewhere and be just as

[07:35] effective and a cot with you know in a corner in a closet as somebody who has to have every single

[07:42] aspect of their life completely dialed in. I see it as the difference between the rocky cut scene

[07:47] of him versus Drago and Rocky 4. Drago has got all these fancy science things that he has to do

[07:51] and all these supplements that he's taking all the stuff and Rocky's just doing his thing on doors

[07:55] getting it done. And so as much printers the two take place for this video for you. Number one

[08:03] being incredibly cognizant of the things that you speak of yourself. When you make I am statements

[08:08] they are the strongest statements that you can make because they're deeply embedded beliefs about what

[08:12] you believe about yourself. And so if you say I am this way when you describe yourself when you

[08:19] meet someone new you meet a girl on a date and you're like I am I have a short fuse right I have a

[08:24] September I am disorganized I am not good with time I am not good with money I haven't saying

[08:31] this shit right but just to give you the types of things that people say all the time they do not

[08:34] serve them. Does this belief serve me if it does not stop fucking saying it period and say something else

[08:44] right or the very least if you feel compelled to have to describe this thing then say I have a

[08:49] tendency or I struggle with behaviors that aren't this way rather than I am number one number two

[08:57] being incredibly weary of the superstitions and routines and religion that you adhere to that you claim

[09:04] is the source of your productivity creativity alertness mental well being subject you know happiness

[09:11] whatever it is or the conversive that if you lack it the threats or the punishments that you speak of

[09:17] yourself if I am not I am agitated I have a short fuse I can't focus I'm not productive I don't have

[09:23] energy all of these things are just weaknesses that you literally build into yourself so stop that's

[09:30] all I got for today guys so most in action I make this channel because a lot of people broken I don't

[09:34] want to be one of them and a lot of people speak limiting beliefs over themselves they claim traits

[09:38] that have do not serve them and they make superstitions and crutch that make them weaker rather than

[09:44] if you want to survive in the world of business you want to build a huge enterprise you want to

[09:48] make the impact that you have you have to be able to know exactly who you are you have to speak

[09:52] beliefs to serve you and you have to be able to succeed independent of circumstance that you create

[10:01] you are source not reaction lots of love keeping awesome kids you guys soon bye

[00:00] This is the blueprint to make your first million dollars.

[00:05] And I'm going to walk you through it, step by step,

[00:08] even if you're starting with your first dollar.

[00:10] So there's three levels from the blueprint,

[00:12] and level one is fundamentals, and it starts with who you are.

[00:16] And the reason we start with who you are is because you are the foundation of everything that you want to have.

[00:22] And so there's a thing of me.

[00:24] And the building blocks of who you are are first,

[00:26] the knowledge that you have, the things you know about.

[00:28] Second, the skills you know how to do.

[00:31] Third, the motivation to actually do them,

[00:34] and fourth, the environment to make it easy.

[00:36] So the first pillar of this is knowledge.

[00:39] In order to become a millionaire,

[00:41] the first thing we have to do is know what a millionaire even is to begin with.

[00:45] A millionaire means that you have over $1 million in investable assets, liquid, minus your house.

[00:54] So your primary residence is actually excluded from this.

[00:57] Now, I'll give you a fun fact that you probably don't know.

[01:00] One out of nine Americans is a millionaire.

[01:04] And the thing that separates the people who are the millionaires from everybody else is what they know exists.

[01:10] And if you're like, who are you to even say this?

[01:12] My name is Oxramozzi, I'm an actress and I come, our portfolio of companies is over $250 million a year.

[01:17] And since 2016, every single business I've ever started has gone to over $10 million a year,

[01:21] and we have three companies that are worth $100 million plus.

[01:24] So the reason that rich kids, for example, have an advantage over poor kids,

[01:30] is because rich kids have parents who tell them about opportunities that exist that get better returns on their time.

[01:38] If you don't know private equity exists, you sure is how aren't going to get into it.

[01:41] If you don't know that you can become an investment maker in sell companies worth $100 million and get percentages of companies that you didn't even found and take on no risk,

[01:50] then you're not going to pursue it.

[01:51] And so I make these videos so that you can know things that you might not naturally have around you or anyone in your surrounding area,

[01:58] who knows that these things exist.

[02:00] And to give you some context, I was 22 when I started this journey and ultimately quit my job before I ended up starting my first business.

[02:08] When I did go to quit my job, I emailed a bunch of different gym owners,

[02:12] because I figured I wanted to get into fitness because there's something I was into.

[02:15] And only one of them got back to me.

[02:17] And that gym owner was a business owner and he was making money.

[02:21] And so I moved out to California, I changed my environment, so that I could be around this guy.

[02:26] And this guy helped me learn the ropes and taught me about my first business, which opened a gym.

[02:31] And it was only after learning and paying for consulting for a gym business that I didn't have,

[02:36] that I felt comfortable enough to begin on my own.

[02:38] So the second component of knowing who you are are the skills you have.

[02:43] These are the things that you do.

[02:45] And so what can be really deceiving about this is people say, hey, I want to be confident.

[02:50] I want to be charismatic.

[02:51] I want to be good on camera.

[02:53] But they make it seem as though it's a trait.

[02:55] So a trait isn't a real thing.

[02:57] What it really is is a bundle of skills.

[03:03] So let's say if you wanted to learn the skill of sales.

[03:05] And so underneath of sales, we may have being able to actively listen,

[03:09] being able to repeat back what someone says,

[03:11] nodding and keeping eye contact, being able to shake a hand firmly.

[03:15] Walking into a room and being able to project your voice, being able to have

[03:19] reasoned to arguments with someone if they have some fallacy that they believe

[03:24] that you can help them overcome.

[03:26] All of these are sub-skills that if someone gives you all of them,

[03:29] someone's say he's a good salesman.

[03:31] Now, if you have this first level skill, you can usually become a millionaire,

[03:35] literally with just that.

[03:36] But then, fundamentally, if you want to level up, you can learn marketing.

[03:43] And marketing is basically sales done one to many.

[03:46] And so all the things that you learn how to do one on one,

[03:49] you start projecting to larger amounts of people.

[03:51] And so this is just sales at scale.

[03:54] And so underneath of marketing, you would also have to understand media.

[03:57] So where your communication is happening, you'd want to understand headlines,

[04:03] because that's going to be the first line of communication.

[04:05] You probably have to learn something about web pages.

[04:08] And you have to learn conversion.

[04:10] Right? These are all sub-skills underneath of marketing that would make you a good

[04:13] marketer.

[04:14] Now, if you know sales and marketing, then you know acquisition,

[04:20] because that means that you can completely acquire customers.

[04:23] And so each of these skills stacks on top of one another and makes all of the skills

[04:28] retroactively more valuable.

[04:30] So the more you learn, the better you get, the better you get, the more you get.

[04:35] And so the path to becoming the person who can make the first million is

[04:40] predicated on the knowledge you have about the world,

[04:43] so that you pursue the right path to get the skills within.

[04:46] And so sure, it's just as hard to learn how to pack boxes in a warehouse,

[04:50] probably as it is to learn how to do sales.

[04:54] They take about the same amount of time to learn.

[04:56] This one just has significantly higher returns.

[04:58] And so this is where the knowledge shows you where to orient your effort,

[05:03] so you get the highest returns back on the skills you learn.

[05:06] So now let's talk about motivation.

[05:08] My tiny little box of motivation.

[05:10] And so motivation fundamentally comes from deprivation.

[05:14] It's from what you don't have that creates the action or urgency around acting in general.

[05:19] And so for example, if I'm sleepy, I'm motivated to sleep.

[05:23] If I'm hungry, I'm motivated to eat.

[05:25] And so right now, if you're motivated to become a millionaire,

[05:29] it's because you lack a million dollars.

[05:30] One of the easiest ways to become more motivated in money, rather than physiological stuff,

[05:36] like hunger, sleep, whatever,

[05:37] is to surround yourself with people who make significantly more money.

[05:41] Now, immediately, you're like, wait a second, I don't know anybody who's a millionaire.

[05:44] Of course you don't.

[05:45] But you may be able to create a reference group that you compare yourself to who are millionaires.

[05:51] And so for me, for example, when I had my job in Baltimore,

[05:54] which is what I left us become an entrepreneur and start my first business,

[05:58] most people were just like, this is a terrible idea.

[06:00] Why would you throw away your college years?

[06:02] Why would you throw away this good job that you have that steady and stable?

[06:05] And looks good on paper and sounds good at cocktail parties.

[06:08] And it was because I hated it.

[06:09] And at some point, I realized that basically everyone except for one guy that I kind of knew,

[06:14] who we talk about our entrepreneurial dreams together,

[06:16] all of them thought this was a bad idea.

[06:18] And so at some point, this is where high agency or high self belief has to become more important.

[06:23] You're belief about yourself has to be more important than what other people say about you.

[06:26] And so there's a perfect segue to my second tiny little box environment.

[06:31] And so think about your environment as friction or lubricant on your goals.

[06:36] And so if you want to change someone's behavior, you change their environment.

[06:39] So let me give you a really simple example of this.

[06:41] I can guarantee you that I can get every single person in a building to take their clothes off.

[06:46] How can I do that?

[06:47] I could do that by locking the doors.

[06:49] That's one change to the environment.

[06:50] Second, putting them all together in one room,

[06:53] second change to the environment.

[06:54] Third, cranking the heat until it's 200 degrees.

[06:57] Eventually everyone would strip down because it would be so hot in there.

[07:01] And so you are that little rat in the experiment,

[07:04] and you want to create the box around you that lubricates the activities that you want to do.

[07:09] And so fundamentally what you want to think about is,

[07:11] how do I make it as easiest possible to work as hard as I can?

[07:14] And then how do I eliminate everything else that distracts me from my goals?

[07:18] More specifically, how do I eliminate everything that distracts me from doing the stuff that gets me the skills

[07:26] that takes me towards my goals?

[07:28] And so that means that it could be people, it could be software, it could be alcohol.

[07:32] If you just simply put this as your filter thinking,

[07:35] does this increase or decrease the likelihood that it hit my goals?

[07:38] Cut out everything that decreases the likelihood that it's your goals,

[07:41] because sometimes it's easier to see.

[07:43] And then all that you'll be left with is nothing and time and the ability to learn and act.

[07:48] I've talked about something that I call the season of no,

[07:50] which I've entered multiple times in my career as an entrepreneur,

[07:54] which is basically where you're not successful enough to be in the group of friends that you want to be in.

[08:00] But you want to have a completely different lifestyle than the people you're currently with.

[08:04] And so you basically just have to say no to everything.

[08:06] And that means that you're saying no to the social gatherings,

[08:08] because you know none of those people there have the goals that you want and none of them understand what you want to do.

[08:12] It's saying no to the distractions and no to the entertainment that you do normally,

[08:17] because you know that that's not going to increase the likelihood that you hit your goal.

[08:19] So for me, I gave up fantasy football.

[08:22] I gave up drinking with the boys.

[08:24] I gave up going out.

[08:25] I gave up really just like friend gatherings in general.

[08:29] And so the only thing that I did was I worked and then I went home at five and then I worked from five to nine.

[08:34] And so I'd worked five to nine in the morning, go to work, work five to nine again at night.

[08:39] And so I had eight hours of time that I could work on me and what I wanted to do next.

[08:43] And five to nine that I had nine to five that I worked in the middle of the day,

[08:46] that was basically how I paid my bills.

[08:48] And if you're like, wait, there was no time.

[08:50] Yes, there was no time.

[08:51] I didn't have a girlfriend.

[08:52] I wasn't going up to the movies, right?

[08:54] Like, it was just a hundred percent focused on removing everything that wasn't getting me close to where I wanted to go.

[08:59] And if you're like, wow, this makes me a weirdo.

[09:02] Yes.

[09:03] Yes.

[09:04] It makes you odd.

[09:06] And if you expect to be normal and achieve odd and outlier results, good luck.

[09:12] So we've just covered who you are and you've made a little bit of money.

[09:17] The next step is figuring out who to sell to.

[09:20] And I want to make this really real for you.

[09:22] And so a lot of people think that you got to make a million dollars.

[09:25] You got to sell 10,000 people something for a hundred bucks.

[09:30] Right?

[09:30] And that would be one million dollars, right?

[09:32] That's that's what that equals.

[09:34] But it's way easier to just sell a hundred people, something that cost $10,000.

[09:41] Which also equals one million bucks.

[09:43] And so believe me, finding a hundred people way easier than finding 10,000.

[09:49] And so the real problem that you're solving is,

[09:52] what do I have that's worth $10,000?

[09:54] Well, the thing is, they also don't have to pay you now.

[09:57] This can be split over four years, right?

[10:00] Which would then be 2,500 bucks a year.

[10:02] Which is now $200 per month.

[10:06] And for you to acquire the hundred customers,

[10:08] you're talking about two people per week,

[10:12] which is not that hard.

[10:13] And if you're reaching out to a hundred people per day,

[10:17] then you getting two out of 700 people to be willing to spend $200 a month with you,

[10:23] all of a sudden, this million dollar goal becomes a lot more real.

[10:27] If you're trying to figure out who to focus on four of these two people a week or

[10:31] that you're selling to, that's what we'll cover right now.

[10:32] You have three basic circles that I've identified for all the entrepreneurs that I've talked to.

[10:38] Number one is that you help someone who is like you overcome something that you overcame in the past.

[10:44] And so that's typically some sort of painful thing,

[10:46] or some sort of problem, you figure it out as solution to,

[10:48] and then you operationalize that for other people.

[10:50] The second is something that you're just very passionate about.

[10:53] So it's like you're really into this thing,

[10:54] and then you help other people get into that thing too.

[10:57] The third is some sort of professional skill.

[11:00] And so that's like, oh, I used to do accounting or booking for this business,

[11:03] or I used to do building management, right?

[11:04] I used to do property management, like whatever it is,

[11:06] you have some sort of skill that you learn in the professional marketplace that you help other people do.

[11:11] And so all of those things, those three peas, pain, passion, profession,

[11:16] are the three fundamentals that I look at in terms of trying to pick the who.

[11:21] So pain, passion, profession.

[11:26] Underneath of this, if you're like, okay, where do I want to start?

[11:29] The reason that I like helping fewer people rather than more people in the beginnings

[11:33] is because you don't have money and you don't have resources.

[11:36] And so if you're going to start a business, you might as well start with fewer people that pay you more,

[11:40] because it's easier to run that business.

[11:42] And so I like to use the, the old Tesla analogy here,

[11:47] which is when Tesla started, he wasn't trying to bring in the Model 3 into mass market.

[11:54] He started with the Roadster, which was the most expensive version of the car,

[11:58] because he knew that the fewest amount of people will be able to afford it.

[12:02] The other thing that this does is it actually positions you at the top of the marketplace.

[12:06] Then he moved down market and created the Model S,

[12:09] which was now a $120,000 car.

[12:11] Then he went and got the Model X,

[12:14] and then he had the Model 3, and then he has the cyber truck,

[12:18] but I think it's why anyways.

[12:20] The point here is that he basically worked his way down and went broader and broader and broader market,

[12:25] as he continued to get resources and be able to redeploy them into broader and broader parts of the marketplace.

[12:32] And so for you, you're going to probably pick what paying passionate profession you're going to go to.

[12:37] You're going to start with the smallest version of that market that you can,

[12:40] the most specific, the closest to who you can help the most.

[12:44] And so I will give you this third little piece here, which is,

[12:47] if you're for some reason split between two of these, like, well, I like this,

[12:51] and I also ever came this thing.

[12:53] Help the person that you can provide the most value to.

[12:56] Now, if you're like, okay, I can help this poor person go up by $10,

[13:01] and I can help this rich person go up by $100,000,

[13:04] then in a real way, that $100,000 is a representation of how much value you can provide that person,

[13:11] meaning go do that one first.

[13:13] Now, once you've identified, okay, I'm going to start with a niche,

[13:15] I'm going to pick one of these three piece, then you run them through these filters that I have.

[13:21] Is that number one, you want them to have the problem to solve.

[13:24] Now, all of these things fundamentally are problems, right?

[13:27] There's not enough information about this passion,

[13:30] there's not enough information to this pain,

[13:31] but there's not enough information about this professionally when I learn.

[13:34] But fundamentally, all of those are the problem.

[13:35] So you have to have a problem that you're trying to solve,

[13:37] and the people you're trying to sell to need to have that problem.

[13:40] Number two is they have to have the money to spend.

[13:42] If they don't have the money to spend, but they got the problem,

[13:44] then you don't have a business around it.

[13:45] You got a nonprofit, which is not the point of this video.

[13:48] This is about making money.

[13:49] Underneath of this, problem to solve,

[13:53] you want them to have the urgency to solve it now.

[13:57] So this can't be something that they're like,

[13:59] oh, that would be nice.

[14:00] It has to be something that they want to solve right now,

[14:01] because this will overcome all of the people who are like,

[14:03] oh, I'm going to think about it.

[14:05] They keep pushing it off.

[14:06] If you have cancer and somebody has a cancer treatment,

[14:08] you want it now.

[14:10] Now, on the money side, you also want them to have the authority to spend it.

[14:14] So you want them to be the one, ideally, who's the principal,

[14:17] who's the one who makes the decision about the implementation

[14:20] that you're going to help them with.

[14:21] And I want to be really clear.

[14:22] I use these as thought exercises to help you get started

[14:25] and pick the who that you're going to serve.

[14:28] But the end of the day, if I had to boil all of this down,

[14:30] it just comes down to this one truth,

[14:32] which is that you want to serve the person that you can provide

[14:36] the most value to.

[14:37] I'll tell you that asixings of you,

[14:39] why commentator, et cetera, they have one rule that they learned in years,

[14:43] which I will share with you, is that they now only invest in founders

[14:46] who already have experience with the problem.

[14:49] And again, I define problem very broadly here,

[14:51] that you have overcome this sort of difficulty

[14:54] and you've lived with the problem for five plus years.

[14:57] If you've lived with it, then you intimately understand it,

[14:59] because that means that you'll also intimately understand the prospect

[15:02] that you want to sell to.

[15:03] And so it kind of is like this hack for already knowing what their thoughts and dreams are,

[15:07] what the pains that they're experiencing, how they talk, the words they use.

[15:10] So it's kind of this big time warp of saying,

[15:13] oh, I already spent the last years of my life living being me.

[15:15] If I can sell to people who were just like me, then I don't need to do five years of studying and figuring this out.

[15:19] And so for me, I had struggled getting into shape.

[15:23] That was my problem.

[15:24] I was not jacked enough.

[15:26] And so then I spent all my time learning about it,

[15:28] so that I could become more jacked, so much though that I annoyed everyone at work.

[15:32] And enough that they were like, please quit this and start something fitness related.

[15:35] And so for me, that was the perfect first pick.

[15:37] Now, I was between SAT prep and why was that?

[15:41] Because I had been pretty good at test prep.

[15:44] I tested pretty well and I had gone through a process of improving my own scores.

[15:47] And I was like, oh, I could probably help other people improve their scores too.

[15:50] The other thing that I was considering was frozen yogurt,

[15:53] because I actually really liked Frojo.

[15:55] At the time, this is before Frojo and yogurt boomed.

[15:57] And so actually it was, you know, kudos to young Alex.

[15:59] It was actually not a terrible time to get into Frojo and yogurt.

[16:02] And so fundamentally, it's like, I had two things I was passionate about.

[16:06] Or pain.

[16:06] These are really just equal sides of the same thing, right?

[16:09] It was a pain.

[16:10] And then I became passionate about it when I solved it.

[16:11] SAT, Frojo, Jim.

[16:14] And so actually all three of these were in this pain slash passion bucket.

[16:18] And I chose to start the gym because, uh,

[16:20] Frojo and yogurt cost 150 grand a open, which I didn't have.

[16:22] Then it was really just between SAT prep and fitness.

[16:26] And I actually started on the SAT prep path first.

[16:29] And then I was going to partner with someone.

[16:31] And then I'll just say it, it ended poorly.

[16:34] And because of that kind of negative experience,

[16:36] and I wasn't emotionally mature enough, I said, fine, I'm not doing that.

[16:39] Uh, I'm just going to do fitness.

[16:40] So it was kind of like a process of elimination.

[16:42] I couldn't do yogurt because I didn't have the money.

[16:43] I felt like I got, uh, burned on my SAT prep thing.

[16:47] And so then I just ended up with, well, I guess I'll just do fitness.

[16:50] And so the only disclaimer that I have about all of this stuff that

[16:53] I just covered.

[16:54] So this is my warning, right?

[16:55] This is my warning call for you is that you want to make sure that you're going

[16:59] to be in a market that's at least flat or growing.

[17:02] You don't want to get into a market that's shrinking.

[17:05] And so if I wanted to get into retirement homes for old folks,

[17:08] that's a growing market.

[17:09] That's a good thing.

[17:10] And so if you had just recently placed your grandmother and it was a pain

[17:13] process for you and then you figured out how to do it in a way that was really

[17:17] smart and efficient, then you could provide that solution to other people who

[17:20] were in the exact same position as you.

[17:22] And it's probably urgent and they have the money in authority to do it.

[17:25] You just don't want to get into selling print newspaper.

[17:28] Today.

[17:29] So you've covered who you are, who to sell to and you've made a little bit more money.

[17:35] And now we talk about what to sell.

[17:38] So there's four elements that I like to have in every product that I sell.

[17:42] Number one is that it's unique.

[17:44] And the reason for that is because I don't want anyone else to be able to sell it.

[17:47] The second is that it's expensive because expensive stuff makes you more money per unit.

[17:53] Third is that I want it to be sticky.

[17:56] I want it to be things that people don't just buy once, but keep buying again and again.

[18:01] And the fourth is that I want it to be air.

[18:03] So unique expensive stickier meaning it's something that doesn't cost me a lot to deliver.

[18:08] And so this is basically the relationship of your gross profit.

[18:12] It means it costs you up, honey, you can sell for a buck and people keep buying it again and again.

[18:16] And no one else can sell it but me.

[18:18] So let me show you a product that everyone's heard of that actually matches all four of these.

[18:22] Coca-Cola.

[18:24] It's unique and that no one else knows the recipe for Coca-Cola.

[18:27] It's expensive relative to how much it costs.

[18:30] It might cost a few pennies to put this together.

[18:32] Really, probably the can is the most expensive part of the product itself.

[18:36] And it's sticky in that, I mean, literally if you spill this on the floor to sticky.

[18:39] But on top of that is that when people start drinking Coke, they don't stop drinking Coke products.

[18:44] For usually their entire lives.

[18:46] Imagine introducing someone to a product and then knowing that they would literally always buy a product.

[18:50] They'd always go to restaurants in order what you had when they go home.

[18:53] They crack up in your thing when they eat food.

[18:55] They drink your products.

[18:56] That's a great business.

[18:57] So these are all exceptional things for making your first million dollars.

[19:02] Now if you want to make a gazillion dollars,

[19:04] then you want to add something else to this, which is scale.

[19:08] So if I just need to have 25 clients like I talked about earlier,

[19:12] then I very much I could just do myself, give people time, give people service,

[19:17] give people some skill set and transfer to them.

[19:19] That's unique because no one else can do it because it's just me.

[19:22] I can charge a lot because it's just my time, which is the cost.

[19:25] And if I'm good, people pay again and again and again.

[19:28] And so these like a normal service business with one really good person meets all four of these things.

[19:33] The issue then becomes scale.

[19:35] And so what I want to walk you through is different ways to make any product more scalable.

[19:39] I think that people have a massive misunderstanding about what it even means.

[19:42] So the first part is that it's not is something scalable or not.

[19:46] It's how scalable is it.

[19:48] So this is really easy to scale.

[19:51] And then this is really hard to scale.

[19:53] And so one on one with you is harder to scale than let's say me adding another user on school,

[20:00] the software platform.

[20:01] And so everything about scalability has to do with something called the incremental cost of adding a customer.

[20:08] But all that really means is how much cost do we have to encourage a business to bring on one additional customer?

[20:15] The most scale businesses bring on an additional customer costs almost nothing.

[20:19] Imagine yourself on carrier.

[20:21] If another person signs onto their network of cell phone usage, it doesn't really cost them much at all to add the additional user.

[20:27] If another person comes onto Facebook, it's not that much.

[20:30] If another person comes onto school, it's not that much to add the person.

[20:34] And so all of these things are easier to scale.

[20:37] Now I will tell you one of the things that's very interesting about very scalable businesses.

[20:42] Is that typically they're more demand constrained.

[20:45] Meaning it's harder to get people to buy that stuff.

[20:49] Whereas there are some businesses that are very hard to scale.

[20:53] Think like a very high service business.

[20:56] So like accounting for example, is harder to scale because it's hard to find really good accountants and be able to maintain that quality of service at a high level.

[21:05] Scaling a law firm really hard because it's all bad expertise.

[21:08] Which means you have to get lots of people and it takes a really long time to get them good enough.

[21:11] And you always have the risk of them leaving.

[21:12] And so oftentimes very unscalabable businesses have partnerships structures so that people come in so that they feel like partial owners in that business.

[21:20] But if you're the ultimate original owner, it can be harder for you to scale.

[21:23] Again, there are massive law firms.

[21:25] It doesn't mean that it's impossible.

[21:28] It just means that it's harder.

[21:29] Congrats.

[21:30] You're one third of the way there.

[21:32] And now we move on to level two.

[21:35] And this is level two.

[21:38] And we start with.

[21:39] Get them to buy.

[21:40] And there's two steps to this.

[21:42] Step one is they have to find out about whatever it is that you sell.

[21:46] And in fact, I wrote an entire book about this thing in a hundred million dollars leads,

[21:50] which is getting strangers to the one of our stuff.

[21:52] All right, this is advertising.

[21:54] The second thing that you do is you get them to buy.

[21:57] So let's start with number one, find out.

[22:00] So there are eight things that you can do to let people know about your stuff.

[22:05] The first four only you can do, the second four are things that other people do on your behalf.

[22:14] These, I call the core four.

[22:16] These, I call the four lead getters.

[22:22] So these are the only four things that one person can do to let other people know about their stuff.

[22:28] So you've got more amount reach, which is letting people who know you know about your stuff.

[22:32] Cold is letting people who don't know you know about your stuff.

[22:36] Then you've got content, which is letting people who know you want to many know about your stuff.

[22:41] And then you've got paid ads, which is letting people who don't know you want to many know about your stuff.

[22:47] These are the only four things that you can do to let someone else know to force them to find out about whatever it is you have to sell.

[22:54] Because they cannot buy it unless they know you exist.

[22:57] Now, if you want to get more leverage because this is about becoming a millionaire,

[23:01] then you can use these four things to get lead getters.

[23:05] Now, the first type of lead getter is a customer.

[23:08] This is the people who you actually get to buy.

[23:10] Now, they can get, they can do the core four themselves.

[23:13] They can let people, they know one on one, they can let strangers know one on one.

[23:17] They can be in ads for you, or they can make content.

[23:21] That's when they make a review, or they make a post talking about how great your stuff is.

[23:25] That lets more people know about it.

[23:27] The next is you've got employees.

[23:29] Employees do the same core four as you do on your behalf.

[23:34] So they do warm out rates. They do cold out loud.

[23:36] They make ads for you. They make content on your behalf.

[23:40] The next version of this is affiliates.

[23:44] So affiliates are businesses that already have your customers in their business.

[23:50] And so let's say I have a gym.

[23:52] If I want to get more people to my gym, I can make a deal with a car director.

[23:55] And I can say, hey, I will send you patients when they ding themselves at my gym.

[23:59] And then when you have somebody who wants to lose weight, because that's why they're backwards,

[24:02] you can send them to my gym.

[24:04] So that creates a reciprocal relationship between you and another business.

[24:07] And every customer they acquire, they can send to you and vice versa.

[24:10] And the last is agencies.

[24:12] So these are other businesses that specialize typically in one of these.

[24:16] So you've got content agencies, you've got paid ads agencies, you've got outbound agencies.

[24:20] In all of those, you'd still have to start with the core four to contact the agency.

[24:23] And then they would use the core four to actually advertise.

[24:26] So these are the only things any person can do to let other people know.

[24:29] And these are the types of people that become the targets of the core four that can then do it on your behalf.

[24:33] Now, if you're trying to get 25 customers, right, like I talked about, like you only need 25 people to pay $10,000 a year for four years to become a millionaire.

[24:40] Okay. So the thing that you have, and that's assuming no taxes.

[24:43] I'm just going to assume this is international video.

[24:45] The first thing in the easiest is here is warm outbound.

[24:49] You just let people know who already know you that you have this thing for sale.

[24:53] And that you're willing to help them.

[24:54] One of the easiest offers is hey, I'll help you for free.

[24:57] So that means I'll put three hours or five hours of my time to help you achieve some sort of outcome.

[25:01] And at the end, if you don't mind, I'd love to make you an offer about what it looks to work with me for paid for money in the future.

[25:07] Very simple offer.

[25:09] And the thing is, when you offer two, three, four, five hours plus of your time for free, a lot of people are willing to do that.

[25:15] And so fundamentally, just think about it, like five sales calls that you do in a row, accept it's really smooth and you're just providing value.

[25:20] And that way, it kind of gets the jitters out for people who've never sold before.

[25:24] And when we actually talk about how to close, I'll cover that in much more detail.

[25:28] But this is the easiest way for people to start.

[25:30] Now, you can pair this with content because then you let people know publicly, hey, I'm doing this thing.

[25:36] What hit me up?

[25:37] In fact, I'll put my hopefully first post somewhere over here.

[25:40] This is the first post I ever made to promote my business.

[25:43] And it was something called the Free Training Project.

[25:45] And I had already worked with people doing warm outbound for a year at that point.

[25:48] I think I had 13ish customers, something like that.

[25:50] And then I published their results and I said, hey, if you guys want to work with me, I got a few spots open.

[25:55] And that's what became my first content post to let people know.

[25:59] So they could find out about my stuff.

[26:01] Now, over time, I learned how to run paid ads and do cold app out, which is like, cause emails, DMs to strangers,

[26:08] just say, hey, can I give you this amazing offer?

[26:10] And ads work the same way, except we call them up, bring them in and close them.

[26:13] And if you're starting out, this can seem like a lot of stuff that you're like, oh, I'm going to do all eight.

[26:18] Until you get two million dollars, you can just do one of these.

[26:20] And if you're going to do two, do content and warm outbound.

[26:24] This is the easiest way to start.

[26:25] It's also the cheapest.

[26:26] Here, you have to have a really good skill set.

[26:29] This is also pretty cheap.

[26:30] It's just harder to do.

[26:31] But if you're going to do cold app bound, you might as well start with warm start with people who aren't strangers.

[26:36] And then level up to people who are strangers.

[26:38] But these ones are the least expensive way of getting customers.

[26:41] This is the most expensive, but it scales quickly.

[26:45] So once people have found out about our stuff, great.

[26:47] So now they know, but now we've got to get them to give us money.

[26:50] So now we've got to get them to buy.

[26:52] When I started my gym, I hated the idea of sales.

[26:54] I even said someone say, hey, you're a salesman.

[26:56] And I was like, I was disgusted by the idea.

[26:58] I'm an academic.

[26:59] And so then I had to pay rent.

[27:01] And clearly, it was like, how do I get these strangers to give me money?

[27:03] And immediately learned sales.

[27:05] Now, over the last 10 plus years, I've done 4,000 plus consoles.

[27:10] And it wasn't until I had to transfer that skill of sales to other people that had to create a framework that was repeatable for other people to also close.

[27:17] I remember the first time I went home for Christmas.

[27:20] Uh, I had an employee close their first sale without me.

[27:24] And I got teary because I realized it was the first time that my business could make money without me.

[27:28] And so this is the framework I have, which is closer.

[27:31] And so this is an acronym, and it's very simple, and it's easy to remember.

[27:34] And the reason that one's smaller is not because R is less important.

[27:37] It's because Amazon, Jeffy B, decided to only send us five of the right ones instead of the sixth.

[27:42] So the first of the closer framework is clarify why the person is there.

[27:47] And so fundamentally, the big advantage that we have as a business is that these customers have reached out to us.

[27:52] And so we need to clarify why they're even, why they even took the time to reach out.

[27:56] Why did you respond or add?

[27:57] Why did you respond to my email?

[27:58] Why do you comment on my post?

[28:00] Whatever it is, if you haven't engaged leads, which means that they've responded in some way,

[28:04] then they've taken the first step.

[28:05] And basically, every form of advertising, this exists.

[28:08] And most people aren't cold-calling and then immediately closing.

[28:11] And so even in that situation, you would call them said an appointment, and then on the appointment,

[28:16] you would then say, hey, what made you take this appointment?

[28:18] What made this worth it for you?

[28:19] And then what we're doing here is we're clarifying the problem.

[28:22] That leads us to the next letter, which is L, which is labeled them with a problem.

[28:27] Now that may sound similar, but it's actually very different.

[28:30] So what we're doing is when we label, we say, huh, so it sounds like you are here.

[28:36] You want to get here.

[28:38] And this is the thing that's getting in the way.

[28:40] Does that sound about right?

[28:42] And so what we've done is we said, this is your current, this is your desired,

[28:45] and we've established a gap, and sometimes in obstacle.

[28:50] That's a monster.

[28:50] Okay.

[28:51] And what we want to do is we want to position ourselves as the sword that can kill the monster

[28:56] and ultimately get them to their desired and state.

[28:59] But we can't sell unless we have a gap.

[29:01] And that is why C and L are so important before you get into anything else.

[29:04] So for example, your 200 pounds, you want to be 150, 50 pounds is the gap.

[29:10] The reason that you're struggling is because you don't know how to work out.

[29:13] You don't know how to eat unless you've, like, a spoon here or fork.

[29:16] There you go. You don't know how to eat.

[29:17] And you have no one who's holding you accountable to making sure that you do these first two.

[29:20] And it be to be setting.

[29:21] It's like you're doing 10k a month and you want to make a 100k a month.

[29:24] And the issue is that you don't have ads that are working or you don't have enough leads that are coming in.

[29:30] That brings us to the next thing.

[29:31] Once we've clarified with there, we clearly label them with a problem.

[29:34] You're here. You want to be here. This is the problem.

[29:35] Then you overview past pain.

[29:38] All right.

[29:38] I call this the pain cycle.

[29:40] So you overview past experiences.

[29:43] The reason this is so important is that pain is what motivates action.

[29:47] And so you think about motivation in general.

[29:49] It's always from deprivation, like I said earlier.

[29:50] So you being overweight and reminding them of how overweight they are.

[29:54] And the cost of being overweight this whole time.

[29:57] It basically further brings them this way.

[29:59] It expands the gap between where they are and then where they want to go.

[30:02] And the further that gap is, the bigger the rubber band is.

[30:05] And so remember, this is our amount of deprivation, which is the amount of motivation

[30:09] to get someone to buy.

[30:10] And so when we do the pain cycle, we simply say,

[30:13] what have you done before?

[30:14] How that work out for you?

[30:16] And then the pieces that they liked, you compare, you associate with your solution.

[30:20] And the pieces they don't like, you associate with why it didn't work,

[30:24] why your solution is different this time.

[30:26] Once you get to the end of, okay, what you do?

[30:29] How that work for you?

[30:29] Oh, it's different.

[30:30] This way, oh, it's similar in this way.

[30:31] What else have you tried?

[30:33] You keep going through that pain cycle to continue to poke on that pain button

[30:36] to keep expanding the gap between where they are.

[30:38] And where they want to go and the frustration in the present for not having achieved it.

[30:42] And so once we've over the pain, now we sell the vacation S.

[30:45] A lot of people salesmen, this is when salesmen blab.

[30:48] This is when salesmen lose the sale.

[30:50] And the reason they lose the sales, because they just do this massive monologue.

[30:53] And that doesn't work.

[30:55] Instead, what you want to do is come up with what I call a three-pillar pitch.

[30:59] And each of the pillars is usually one or two statements and then followed by an analogy or metaphor.

[31:04] And so you say, hey, if you want to create SEO to get more leads, then it's kind of like,

[31:11] and then we basically make our transition.

[31:13] It's kind of like when you get a paycheck and when you have an investment account,

[31:17] your paycheck, you work and you get paid every single month.

[31:19] But you put a little bit of that money towards your investment over time that investment compounds until eventually,

[31:24] it makes you more than what you make in your active.

[31:26] And so SEO kind of works the same way.

[31:28] Now, realistically, there's really no similarity to getting traffic to a website as there is between

[31:33] a paycheck and an investment account.

[31:34] But it compares something that people understand with something that they don't understand,

[31:38] so they can learn.

[31:39] And so fundamentally, you should come up with three analogies that explain each of the pillars of what differentiates your solution.

[31:45] If I was selling leads, which I came up with a script for mortgage brokers,

[31:48] it was the lead's had to be exclusive.

[31:51] They had to be timely and they had to be qualified.

[31:53] And so you just say, okay, have you ever got on the phone?

[31:55] Somebody who doesn't have money and they're just window browsing, yeah, it's paying in the ass.

[31:58] Totally.

[31:59] Right?

[31:59] And so it's like, cool, you're just giving an example.

[32:01] You give it an analogy that explains it.

[32:02] If it's something easy to understand, examples, if it's something hard to understand, better for it.

[32:06] And the reason I call it sell the vacation is that you'll notice that I'm not actually explaining much about the product at all.

[32:11] And the main reason is because they care about themselves.

[32:13] They don't care about our product.

[32:14] They care about their problems, not about our product.

[32:17] And the only reason they care about our product is if there's a way that they know with high conviction that's going to get them to their goal.

[32:22] And so we want to talk about Maui.

[32:24] We want to talk about Hawaii.

[32:25] We want to talk about where they're going.

[32:27] What it's going to be like when they're at 150.

[32:29] When it's going to be like when they're making 100,000 dollars a month,

[32:31] not all the steps it's going to take to get there.

[32:34] We're not talking about TSA.

[32:35] We're not talking about taking your shoes off and sitting next to somebody who stinks and getting on the plane and having bad plain food.

[32:40] Because guess what all of that stuff is, I just gave you an analogy.

[32:44] And so once we've done S, we then go to E, which is explained away their concerns.

[32:48] So at this point, after you've overviewed the pain, you say, hey, I think I might have something for you.

[32:52] Would you like to hear about it?

[32:54] They say yes.

[32:55] And then you go to sell the vacation.

[32:56] Once you've sold the vacation, you ask you say you ready to get started.

[32:59] That's how I'm good to you.

[33:00] And you kind of close in question you want.

[33:01] Fair enough. Great.

[33:02] Now, if they then say anything, but yes, I want to buy, you then go to E.

[33:07] Explain away their concerns.

[33:08] And so the way that you explain away the concerns is that typically there's three big categories.

[33:12] So people blame their circumstances for why they can't do something.

[33:14] They blame other people for why they can't do something.

[33:17] Or they avoid the decision altogether, which is basically blaming themselves.

[33:20] They give their power elsewhere.

[33:21] And so within that, you basically have six categories of questions that fall their knees.

[33:26] So one is they say they don't have the time.

[33:28] I'm too busy right now.

[33:29] Now's not a good time.

[33:30] The second is they say, I don't have the money to do this right now.

[33:35] This is too expensive.

[33:36] This is outside of my budget.

[33:37] Number three is they say,

[33:39] somebody else has the decision making authority.

[33:42] All right.

[33:42] The fourth is they say,

[33:44] I'm not sure this is right for me.

[33:46] This is a fit question, all right?

[33:48] Which is really just means that they have a preference that isn't aligned

[33:52] or that they believe is in aligned with the product that you sell.

[33:55] Oh, I have to follow me.

[33:56] Oh, plan.

[33:57] I don't want to count calories.

[33:58] Five is they blame other people's past experiences with them.

[34:02] And so this is one that we overcome with something I call Bernie twice,

[34:05] but it's other people's products.

[34:07] And then finally, they avoid this is a stall.

[34:14] This is sound similar to this, but it's actually very different.

[34:18] This is I don't have time.

[34:19] This is give me time.

[34:20] That covers the explaining way of the concerns.

[34:22] There's a hundred other closes that give you,

[34:24] but those are the theories behind each of them.

[34:26] Finally, we have to reinforce the decision.

[34:28] So now we have somebody who's made the decision,

[34:31] they've chosen to give us money, which is amazing.

[34:33] We love them for that.

[34:34] But the thing is that sometimes people change their minds when they go away,

[34:37] especially if you're good at sales.

[34:38] And so when you have the R,

[34:40] what we're doing is we're reinforcing that they made a good call.

[34:44] Now this actually begins the hand off to onboarding.

[34:48] All right.

[34:48] So when you onboard a new customer,

[34:50] this is what happens in the first 24, 48 hours post purchase.

[34:53] And what you want to do is make as many promises as you can

[34:57] in that time period and keep them.

[35:00] So that they feel, and we're talking like,

[35:02] hey, this is what's going to happen next in the next 30 minutes.

[35:05] This is going to happen.

[35:05] Right?

[35:06] You're going to get an email and then you can click that link.

[35:08] And then this is going to happen and you want to as many of those

[35:09] things that you tell them to have happened to happen.

[35:12] And from this, we do something called BAMFIM,

[35:15] which is book a meeting from a meeting.

[35:16] And when you do BAMFIM, it means that no one ever gets left in the cracks.

[35:21] No one falls through.

[35:22] And so the reason that a lot of customers cancel is because you said

[35:25] someone's going to reach out to them.

[35:26] And they thought it was going to take 30 minutes.

[35:27] You didn't set the explanations.

[35:28] It takes two days.

[35:29] And they're like, you know what, this isn't for me.

[35:31] I actually, I've changed my mind, right?

[35:33] Instead, you want to always have them.

[35:35] It's like a baton pass.

[35:36] It's like sales passes.

[35:38] The onboarding onboarding one passes the onboarding two,

[35:40] onboarding two passes the senior engineer or the media buyer,

[35:43] or whatever it is that you do deliver results for people.

[35:46] And at that point, you've kept them through the process.

[35:48] And you've reinforced, you know what?

[35:50] These guys are on top of it.

[35:51] They're legit.

[35:52] And if you want to make this extra magic,

[35:56] what you do is you pass on the notes.

[35:59] So you never want a customer to repeat themselves.

[36:02] And so the way you do that is that you take notes on every call.

[36:04] And so if you get on a sales call, for example, in the setter,

[36:07] had notes, then you can start the call.

[36:08] I'm like, hey, I know you talk to Andrew.

[36:10] You said this and this and these are the problems you're struggling with.

[36:12] They're like, wow, these guys are on it.

[36:13] And when that goes to onboarding and they have their onboarding

[36:16] conversation with Sarah and then Sarah says, oh, I know you talk to Andrew

[36:19] and you talk to Jeff.

[36:20] And you said these things.

[36:20] They're like, wow, this business is legit.

[36:22] Very small change, massive improvement in terms of how

[36:25] satisfied customers will be.

[36:27] And because this is all about making more money, the likelihood that they

[36:30] actually ascend and buy more in the future.

[36:33] Yeah. And if you're a beginner, you're the one taking all of these calls.

[36:35] So at the very least, take your own notes and remember what you're

[36:38] talking about with these people.

[36:39] And if you have multiple customers, review the notes before you get back on the call

[36:42] with them.

[36:42] Close more deals.

[36:43] Make more money.

[36:44] Say the wrong.

[36:44] We got them to buy.

[36:45] We got our first customers.

[36:46] We've made a little bit of money.

[36:48] Now we get them to buy even more.

[36:51] So now we got to get them to buy more times.

[36:53] And specifically, this is all the different ways that you can make a customer

[36:56] worth more money to your business.

[36:58] And so the idea is that the customers or the businesses that make customers

[37:01] worth the most are the ones that make the most money on surprise it.

[37:05] But there are eight specific ways that you can do with literally any business.

[37:08] So the first way is that you can increase the price.

[37:11] So for this example, let's say I'm selling gum.

[37:14] All right.

[37:15] So I'm selling gum.

[37:16] And what I can do is instead of charging five dollars for this, I can charge six

[37:19] dollars.

[37:19] It costs me the same amount.

[37:21] But I've now made more money.

[37:22] The second way that I can do this is I can decrease my costs.

[37:26] All right.

[37:26] So if this thing was originally five dollars and it cost me a dollar to make,

[37:30] I can buy more inventory.

[37:31] I can do advances so that I can get this down to 50 cents.

[37:34] So I'm still making 50 cents more per box.

[37:36] That's the second way that we make any product more profitable for us.

[37:41] The third way we can do this is we can get them to buy more times.

[37:47] So right now, I say, hey, you want to buy my gum great, but wouldn't be cool

[37:50] if you got on a gum subscription.

[37:52] So you get one of these every single month.

[37:53] The fourth way is to get them to buy something else that's new or different.

[37:58] All right.

[37:58] So right now, I'm selling you this gum, but wouldn't be cool if you got these

[38:02] nicarret patches as well.

[38:03] So wouldn't these patches go great with your gum?

[38:06] It doesn't matter what you sell, you can have burger with fries.

[38:09] You could have an iPhone case with your iPhone.

[38:11] There's always something else that pairs or is complimentary to whatever your

[38:15] core offer is.

[38:16] And sometimes you make more profit on this thing than you do on the main thing.

[38:19] The fourth thing that you can do is get people to buy more quantity.

[38:22] All right.

[38:23] So this is when the number goes up.

[38:25] So currently you're buying one box, what if you bought three boxes of gum?

[38:29] And so the difference between this and this is this is how many times they're buying

[38:33] over a period of time.

[38:34] This is how we're increasing the quantity all at once.

[38:37] And so this is think about this as bulk purchases buying more volume.

[38:41] The second way that we can do this is increase quality.

[38:44] So now we say, okay, how do we sell you a better version of this?

[38:48] So these ones are two milligrams of nicotine.

[38:51] These ones are four milligrams.

[38:52] So if I have a box of the same size, but I still do a four milligrams version,

[38:56] then it might be a higher quality or maybe the nicotine in this one comes from

[38:59] a magic plant in the Amazon.

[39:01] Either way, we saw a higher quality version.

[39:03] If I were selling burgers instead of selling mystery meat,

[39:06] you could sell sirloin burgers.

[39:07] Right?

[39:08] If you're selling iPhone cases, it would go from plastic to Kevlar.

[39:12] It would go from plastic to metal or wood.

[39:15] We have a higher quality version of whatever it is that we sell.

[39:18] And if you're selling services, there's a zillion ways you can make more valuable.

[39:21] But it's like you have higher quality representatives who are going to be answering your

[39:25] thing.

[39:25] You have priority support.

[39:27] You get answered first.

[39:27] You have extended hours.

[39:29] So you get more times all of those things are different versions of higher quality.

[39:32] The next is that you can do the equal option.

[39:34] You decrease the quantity.

[39:35] You decrease the number that someone buys.

[39:38] So instead of buying 160 pieces, you just buy 20.

[39:43] So you can have a down so.

[39:45] Now the reason that this can make you more money is that it actually makes you more money

[39:48] per person you talk to, not per customer.

[39:50] And so what this is, you make money here when you took a no in turn into a yes.

[39:54] So it's taking a no, a small no turning into a small yes.

[39:57] And then later, you've all these other things to turn into a big yes.

[40:00] And then finally, we go from something that's higher quality to something that's lower quality.

[40:06] So is there a version of your product that could be the discount version, the economy

[40:11] class version?

[40:12] And with services, it's literally the equal option.

[40:14] You have junior reps to answer it.

[40:15] You have extended times.

[40:16] You don't get calls.

[40:17] You only get chat support.

[40:19] It's all just thinking what are different ways all the components and features that

[40:22] I have with my service.

[40:23] Most times if you have a service, you just have to you haven't even defined all the standards

[40:27] you have.

[40:28] You just need to think through every single thing.

[40:29] What about speed?

[40:30] What about quality?

[40:30] Who they're talking to?

[40:31] What about the medium they're on?

[40:32] Is it one to many?

[40:33] Is it one on one?

[40:34] Is it recorded?

[40:35] Is it live?

[40:36] Like all of these things are factors that make something more less valuable?

[40:39] And so with physical products to say my digs, if it's usually going to be the ingredients

[40:42] and how new it is.

[40:43] This is an older model.

[40:44] Those are all things that decrease the quality.

[40:46] And so when you're looking at this, these are the eight ways that you can get any customer

[40:51] to be worth more.

[40:52] And so if you're a beginner, you want to know the easiest one of these to make more money.

[40:56] Charge more for the exact same thing.

[40:59] It oftentimes when you're a beginner, you want to start love.

[41:01] So it's okay.

[41:02] But what I would recommend doing is what I call the five to five to five model.

[41:09] So basically, every five you sell, you bump it by 20%.

[41:13] All right?

[41:14] Very easy.

[41:14] So if we're at $5 for our gum here, the first five people, if everyone buys no problem,

[41:19] we bump it to $6.

[41:20] So $5 goes up, 20%.

[41:23] It goes to $6.

[41:24] And if the next five buy no problem, then we go up to $7.

[41:28] And we keep going up by 20%.

[41:30] And you can keep doing this forever until people stop buying.

[41:34] And so then you just look at how much gross profit do I have, times the conversion rate,

[41:38] and that gives you your perfect price.

[41:40] And so I'm telling you, you might be worried about what if what if I sell for your people,

[41:43] you just have to do the math.

[41:44] And you never discount in order to make a sale.

[41:47] You can choose to test your price, but you have to stick with it for the number that you said you would.

[41:51] The second easiest one of these to do besides obviously raising the prices over time is just getting people to buy more stuff.

[41:57] This one requires nothing new from you.

[41:59] This one also requires nothing new.

[42:01] You just ask them to buy again next month.

[42:03] This one gets them to buy more today.

[42:05] And so these ones are among the easiest that you can do as a beginner.

[42:08] This one, decreasing cost super valuable for you.

[42:11] Usually takes more time for you to negotiate with vendors, get economies of scale, things like that, but still valuable.

[42:17] All these other things are things that you add to the business, which creates more products.

[42:20] And I'll say that anything wrong with that, but it simply a more advanced move.

[42:23] So these three right here are the ones that you want to focus on if you're beginner.

[42:28] And this is a concept that you should understand how to master this is the language of business.

[42:33] And so it doesn't matter what we're talking about.

[42:35] You should be able to apply all eight of these to anything.

[42:37] So if I'm selling whiteboards, I say, okay, I can raise the price of this whiteboard.

[42:41] Next is I can get people to buy more whiteboards over an extended period of time.

[42:45] Wasn't that one great? Wouldn't be great if you had more of those for your team?

[42:48] Or I could get them to buy five whiteboards today, one for every room in their office.

[42:52] Right? Or I could say, hey, this is a, you know, flimsy metal whiteboard.

[42:57] Let me get you a wood one, it'll look better on camera.

[42:59] Or I can make it higher quality by saying, hey, I won't put my logo on yours.

[43:03] So that it's not an all year camera shins.

[43:05] The next is I can decrease how much it costs me to actually manufacture each of these whiteboards.

[43:10] This also increases my profit.

[43:11] The next thing is I say, okay, you got these whiteboards.

[43:13] Who would about your paper? Right?

[43:15] That you know, would go great with your whiteboard?

[43:17] Rolls of paper.

[43:18] The next is, okay, can I decrease the quantity?

[43:21] Okay, so instead of buying five, you buy one.

[43:24] Right? And then in terms of quality, we go the other direction.

[43:26] So instead of buying this wood one, you buy this metallic one.

[43:29] And if you're starting with metallic, then maybe you go from this metal one to really flimsy metal or an older model.

[43:34] You should be able to apply this to anything you sell.

[43:37] And once you've mastered this, you can become a master of increasing the lifetime value.

[43:41] AKA how much people spend with you.

[43:43] Imagine this bucket is your business.

[43:45] And imagine this is new customers coming in the door.

[43:48] If you don't fix this leaky bucket,

[43:50] they're never going to be able to stack up.

[43:54] And so,

[43:56] once you fix it,

[43:57] you can flow as much as you want.

[44:00] But now you're keeping your customers and your revenue compounded.

[44:03] And if you do that for a long enough period of time,

[44:06] while we leave for my friend over here to fill up the bucket,

[44:08] this is a cyber truck.

[44:10] And this is 100 grand.

[44:11] And in the next 30 days, September, October, November, December,

[44:14] each month and 2024,

[44:15] I'm giving one of these to someone who's watching this video right now.

[44:18] And so the way that you win this stuff

[44:20] is by building the largest group on school within the next month.

[44:23] And last month's winner just to give you some context,

[44:25] got you about $50,000 per month in recurring revenue.

[44:28] And we make it pretty easy.

[44:30] So right now, one out of two people who start a community on school,

[44:32] that's paid makes it least $1 online.

[44:34] And oftentimes, this is a lot more than that.

[44:36] In fact, right now,

[44:37] the average is $1,360 per month.

[44:40] So no, this isn't going to get you on the Forbes list,

[44:42] but it can help get you started.

[44:43] And so if that sounds it all interesting,

[44:45] the best part is you can start your own community on school,

[44:48] absolutely free going to school.com for slash games.

[44:51] All right, join the community,

[44:53] have fun, make money, save the world,

[44:55] and I'll see you on the other side.

[44:57] And if you keep doing it over time,

[44:59] you'll have more money than you know it to do it.

[45:00] And you'll be overflowing with customers and cash.

[45:03] And that's how you create a cash flow,

[45:07] explosion.

[45:08] And once you got people buy it,

[45:09] and people are buying again and again again.

[45:11] Now, you're making a little bit more money.

[45:14] But the next thing you need is going to be help.

[45:16] And so you're going to have to have other people

[45:18] to help you along the way.

[45:19] Because this is how you scale.

[45:21] And these are two mannequins that represent employees.

[45:23] So let me share a framework with you.

[45:24] That's really expanded my vision in terms of how companies grow.

[45:27] This is taking me years to develop.

[45:29] But fundamentally, I see the size of a company is always

[45:33] can be limited by the number of brains or the cumulative knowledge

[45:38] that exist within the company.

[45:40] And so that should make some sort of sense.

[45:42] Like the amount of total knowledge that that exists

[45:44] is going to be the potential of the business,

[45:47] which is why as entrepreneurs,

[45:48] you have to learn more because if you make your brain bigger

[45:51] and you make your knowledge base bigger,

[45:52] look how much bigger the company can get.

[45:54] But the thing is is that you don't realize that you can get

[45:58] three or four or five other people's lives

[46:02] built into the business by saying, hey,

[46:04] I don't need to learn finance.

[46:05] I'm going to go find somebody who's got 20 years of finance

[46:08] experience in this industry.

[46:09] Hey, I don't need to learn HR and recruiting.

[46:11] Because we know find somebody who has that experience.

[46:13] Because what happens is,

[46:14] once you do that,

[46:16] the potential of the business,

[46:18] you can't even see it because the peak would be all the way up here.

[46:20] And so this is the big unlock.

[46:23] This is how Steve Jobs built the biggest,

[46:26] one of the biggest tech companies in the world.

[46:27] It wasn't because he knew how to build the iPhone.

[46:30] He knew how to build the team.

[46:34] They could build the iPhone.

[46:36] And so the most viable skill set fundamentally that you can have

[46:39] as a business owner is the ability to get other people to do stuff

[46:41] for you.

[46:42] And so on one level, you have the influence to get them to want

[46:44] to do that thing for you.

[46:45] And then everything else after that

[46:46] is enabling them to know how to do the right stuff.

[46:50] And so the first is the persuasion side.

[46:53] Now that, I think I've heard during the closer stuff,

[46:55] that's going to be the values you have, what you represent.

[46:57] And if people really admire you,

[46:58] and that's where you have to continue to level up yourself,

[47:01] this is the who you are part,

[47:02] in order to attract the best talent.

[47:04] But what you have good talent,

[47:05] how do you make sure that they know how to do the right stuff?

[47:08] And so I call this the management diamond.

[47:11] All right, so it's very simple.

[47:12] So I reverse this from,

[47:14] if somebody doesn't do what I want them to do,

[47:17] why would that be?

[47:18] The first reason is they didn't know that you wanted them to do it at all

[47:22] because you hadn't told them or you weren't clear about it.

[47:24] Now, if they know that you wanted them to do it,

[47:27] they might not have known how to do it.

[47:30] Because they're like, okay, I got that you wanted me to do it,

[47:32] but I just don't know how.

[47:34] The third is that they knew how, they knew that and how,

[47:37] but they didn't know when you wanted them to do a buy.

[47:40] So they couldn't just been totally able,

[47:42] they just didn't know that you wanted it right now.

[47:43] And next is they knew that, how and when,

[47:46] but they didn't have any motivation to do it.

[47:48] They didn't know why you wanted them to do it.

[47:50] And so when I think about each of these things,

[47:53] you can actually solve this.

[47:55] So you solve this through comms.

[47:57] So this is through clear communication where you include the deadlines,

[48:00] which is here, but you saw for this one.

[48:02] Is that whenever you include what you want someone to do,

[48:04] you give them a time duration and then you ask them how long they expect

[48:07] it's going to take.

[48:08] To solve the how, what we do is we have the three D's,

[48:11] which is document, which is you figuring out a checklist

[48:15] of exactly what you do because oftentimes in your beginner

[48:17] or when you're starting your own business,

[48:19] you have to do every single job.

[48:21] And so you know how to do the job better than they do.

[48:23] The problem is in the beginning,

[48:24] you're more unconsciously competent or you do a lot of other things

[48:28] that you don't know that you do,

[48:29] which is what makes you successful.

[48:30] You're like, no one can sell like I can sell.

[48:32] What it really means is I don't know how to teach anyone

[48:34] like I can sell.

[48:35] And so that means it's a deficit on you,

[48:37] not a deficit on them.

[48:38] And so the first thing you do is you document,

[48:40] step by step through checklist,

[48:42] what you do to get the result,

[48:44] whether it's making a website or it's doing outbound

[48:46] or doing sales or making content, whatever it is,

[48:48] you document, step by step what you do.

[48:50] The next is you demonstrate it,

[48:52] which means you do it in front of them using the document.

[48:56] So you say, hey, let me show you how I'm following the checklist

[49:00] and then look at what happens.

[49:01] So I follow the checklist and look at what happens.

[49:03] And they gain trust in the checklist and the documentation.

[49:07] And so after you've documented and you demonstrate in front of them,

[49:09] then they duplicate,

[49:11] which means they now do it in front of you using the same document.

[49:15] And if they get the same outcome as you do using just the document,

[49:18] then you have duplicate the scale and now they can do it.

[49:21] And so they know how.

[49:22] Now finally, the why is a question of motivation.

[49:26] So I'm not going to be able to solve human motivation in one video.

[49:30] But what I will say is explaining and leveling up what this thing

[49:35] does within an organization.

[49:37] A lot of people do want to do a good job.

[49:38] And they do want to be contributing members of society.

[49:41] But a lot of times we have an explain how what you do here

[49:44] feeds us overall machine,

[49:45] which hopefully does some good in the world.

[49:48] And so it's simply explaining in simple terms how customer service,

[49:52] for example, it's like, hey, you do customer service.

[49:54] And you respond to tickets using this process,

[49:57] we get to have your customers.

[49:58] Happy your customers stay longer, pay more and refer their friends.

[50:01] And if we want to have this big mission,

[50:03] we want to make sure we're delivering to the people that were currently serving.

[50:05] But on top of that, we want to be able to help more people over time.

[50:07] And so you very much are important to our whole business to success.

[50:12] And so if every person in the organization knows how they tie what they do,

[50:17] directly or indirectly to you being successful as a business,

[50:20] then they have a larger motivation for why they should do it.

[50:23] And so if you ever have a conversation where you're like,

[50:25] why is my employee not doing anything,

[50:27] I would also suggest using this as a framework,

[50:29] because then it's not none of these blame them.

[50:31] You say, hey, John, I asked you do this.

[50:35] And then you didn't do this.

[50:37] And so help me understand, was it that you didn't know that I wanted you to do it?

[50:41] Because I see this message here.

[50:43] So was that part unclear?

[50:44] Is it that you didn't know how to do it?

[50:46] Was it that you didn't know when to do it by?

[50:49] You didn't know why to do it.

[50:50] And let me give you the bonus number five.

[50:53] Was there something blocking you?

[50:55] And so this is actually one of the most common ones of the diamond,

[50:59] because what it is is, for example,

[51:01] hey, I could have the best chef in the world.

[51:03] And I say, hey, make me an omelette.

[51:04] He understands what making an omelette is.

[51:05] He knows how to do it.

[51:06] And I said, make it for me right now.

[51:07] He's motivated because he's on live television.

[51:09] What's the problem?

[51:10] He ain't got no eggs.

[51:12] And so the whole point is, and I had this,

[51:14] I'll give you a real example with my team.

[51:16] I was like, hey, guys, why are you guys not getting these edits out on time?

[51:19] And they were like, ah, we want to spend more time at home.

[51:22] We want to spend it at that headquarters.

[51:23] And I was like, I built this massive headquarters for you guys.

[51:25] Why are you not spending time here?

[51:26] And so it turned out they knew how to do it.

[51:28] They knew that I wanted it.

[51:29] They knew when they needed it by it.

[51:30] They were very motivated to do it.

[51:32] The problem was the internet at our headquarters was in fast enough.

[51:35] They were way faster at home.

[51:36] And so we spent 200 grand to get Google fiber drilled down into the building.

[51:40] So we get a gigabyte a second now.

[51:42] And now they all edit here.

[51:43] And so the thing is, there's a lot of times as a boss or an owner,

[51:46] you have to see what are the things that are blocking.

[51:48] Because most people do want to do their jobs.

[51:50] But this little five work, five part framework, this diamond is one of the most

[51:55] valuable tools I have because this actually makes a productive discussion.

[51:58] Because either you can solve the constraint for them or you find out that you've

[52:03] got somebody who despite all of these things still chooses not to do it in which

[52:06] case, maybe it's not a good for them.

[52:08] So we had a new sales rep that came in and we were really excited about him.

[52:12] And he, you know, he seemed really sharp, really understood what was going on.

[52:15] And within three days he was doing all of the stuff.

[52:18] But he came to us and was like, I really hate this.

[52:23] Now that's something that I can't fix.

[52:25] If you hate, you know, talking to new people and talking to customers,

[52:29] talking to prospects all day long, then sales is probably not for you.

[52:32] Now that being said, we also want to break down like, hey, everything's got periods of

[52:35] suck.

[52:36] You got to learn skills, things like that.

[52:38] But if I check every one of these boxes and someone says,

[52:41] checks all of them and nothing stopping them except for themselves,

[52:44] then it makes the conversation really easy.

[52:45] It's like, dude, I don't want you to do something you don't want to do.

[52:47] No worries.

[52:48] So boom, why do I bring a tripod here?

[52:51] If you're like, what are the three pillars of the business?

[52:53] These are the three pillars of business is Alex understands them.

[52:55] The first, the tip of the spear is acquisition.

[52:58] That's marketing and sales that's letting people know about your stuff and getting

[53:00] them to exchange money in order to get it.

[53:02] The second pillar is delivering that stuff.

[53:05] So someone advertises someone sells and then someone has to create and deliver the

[53:09] iPhone.

[53:10] So once you advertise and you sell, now you have to deliver the product.

[53:13] You got to give the person the iPhone.

[53:15] So that comes from the design.

[53:16] That's product, that's distribution, that's delivery in service businesses.

[53:19] That's customer success.

[53:21] That's onboarding, that's delivering the service in self.

[53:23] That is all the stuff that goes into this delivery.

[53:26] It's how you fulfill the promises that acquisition made.

[53:29] The third one, and this is the one that a lot of people forget and this often limits

[53:33] businesses is operations.

[53:35] So this is everything else that's not included in these two, but that support these

[53:39] two.

[53:40] So think IT, legal, finance, payroll, HR, recruiting, all of that stuff supports these

[53:46] two other functions.

[53:47] These are the core value creators in the business.

[53:49] You got to market and sell stuff.

[53:50] You got to deliver that stuff.

[53:52] But everything else that has to exist in order for these two to continue to function.

[53:56] You got to pay taxes.

[53:57] Got to pay payroll.

[53:58] You got to send people checks.

[53:59] Right?

[54:00] These are all things that must exist, but most entrepreneurs are severely lacking.

[54:05] And this is sometimes where the biggest outside help can come and help expand

[54:09] the overall business.

[54:11] So that the potential of how big the thing is that you want to build can get so much

[54:15] bigger.

[54:16] And then you just keep adding more and more people to this and you keep expanding the

[54:22] stool.

[54:22] But the three core pillars of the business remain unchanged.

[54:26] And so if these are the three pillars of the business and you want to take a partner

[54:30] on, so let's say that I want to take this partner, not necessarily life partner, but

[54:33] I want to take a partner on my business because this happens a lot really early.

[54:36] And usually it's because there's so much work and you have no capital and you're like,

[54:40] you know what, if two of us work, at least twice as much stuff will get done.

[54:43] The problem is most partnerships come from two guys or two guys who are buddies and say,

[54:48] hey, let's get like we have fun hanging out.

[54:50] Let's and we love talking about business.

[54:52] Let's do business together.

[54:53] But the problem is, let's say they both love marketing and sales where they both love products.

[54:57] We're, they both love operational stuff, just like people things like that.

[55:01] Well, then you actually are super top heavy and what happens is this goes like this

[55:07] because you're over over indexed on one and the tripod falls over.

[55:12] And so you want to be balanced in the business so that the business can continue to

[55:15] scale proportionally across all functions.

[55:17] And so if somebody is going to partner with you, they have to have a skill that you don't

[55:22] have time you don't have or capital you don't have.

[55:25] And from the skill perspective, it means they have to have one of the other legs of the

[55:28] stool that you don't have.

[55:30] From a capital perspective, that might be the thing that flows into the business that allows

[55:33] these people to work in the beginning when it might not be as profitable or for you to buy

[55:37] inventory for you to buy a machine that you're going to do the equipment with.

[55:39] Or let's say it's you sending the capital, somebody else is going to be running the

[55:44] business on your behalf as an operator owner now they're going to be putting in time or

[55:47] energy that you don't have because you're doing other stuff.

[55:49] Congrats.

[55:50] You're now done with level two.

[55:52] More money.

[55:53] And now it's time to go to level three.

[55:55] So here we are on level three and I want to quick take a quick pause to invite you if you're

[56:01] a business owner doing over a million dollars a year and you'd like to scale to the next

[56:05] level.

[56:05] I want to invite you to come out to our workshops here in Vegas to my headquarters to meet

[56:09] with me and my team.

[56:10] Each of my functional directors will work with companies of my portfolio doing hundreds of

[56:14] millions of dollars a year to help you deconstrain your business to get to the next level

[56:18] whatever you ask if you're trying to go from one million to ten million or ten million to

[56:21] thirty million or fifty million we've been to each of those levels multiple times before

[56:25] and we know what it looks like to have advertising go from one to ten.

[56:28] We know what it looks like to have delivery go from ten to thirty.

[56:30] We know what it looks like to have finance go from thirty to a hundred and so we can

[56:34] help you deconstrain those things and help you ultimately scale.

[56:37] If that sounds interesting, show that you all are all around here and we'd love to

[56:40] have you out.

[56:41] Otherwise keep enjoying the bit.

[56:42] Let's go to the first level of level three keeping your advantage.

[56:45] So things are working people are working for you.

[56:47] You're making sales now we want to expand the gap between you and everybody else.

[56:51] And if you're like, why is there a big sea saw here I'll explain in a second.

[56:54] But the fundamental crux of all this is the big word leverage which is let's define it.

[57:01] How much you get for what you put in.

[57:03] So leverage doesn't mean good or bad it's just how much you get.

[57:07] Now if I do this many times let's say I'm pumping something then I'm doing more repetitions.

[57:12] And the amount of leverage I get is proportional to the size of this lever right now.

[57:17] If I want to get more for what I put in then it means I would extend this lever all the way

[57:21] out here and I'd get more for every push.

[57:24] If I wanted to have less which why would you I would put my hits here and I have a much

[57:28] smaller lever so it's much harder to do the same amount of work.

[57:31] And so how much you get is leverage.

[57:34] High leverage is I get a lot for what I put in low leverage is I get very little for what

[57:39] I put in.

[57:40] There's lots of forms of leverage in a business and the idea is that you want to have as many

[57:44] working for you at the same time as you possibly possible.

[57:47] So I'll give you a couple examples.

[57:49] So one one that I built mine on is brand its reputation.

[57:54] So that means that if I have a brand versus not having a brand the brand gives me leverage

[57:58] in a lot of ways.

[57:59] So number one is I've higher click the rates.

[58:02] If I run an ad with a trusted figure then more people will click then otherwise would

[58:07] have normally without a brand.

[58:08] That means I get more for what I put in high leverage.

[58:11] Second I get higher conversion rates.

[58:14] And so the people who click also have a higher likely to opt again following through and

[58:18] ultimately buying.

[58:21] And once people do that then they're able to say yes or they're willing to say yes and

[58:26] higher prices.

[58:28] Another form of leverage is people.

[58:30] If I can get more for what I put in I only live one life's one lifespan but I can get

[58:36] somebody else's life basically their experience to help propel my business towards my

[58:42] goal then I get my life plus their life.

[58:45] And so that gives me more leverage.

[58:48] So I want to make this real for you.

[58:49] So imagine you see an advertisement for this blank t-shirt.

[58:53] All right.

[58:54] Are you inclined to buy it?

[58:56] Probably not unless you're just in the market for white t-shirts.

[59:00] But all of a sudden if you see this one right next to it you might have a much higher likelihood

[59:04] of clicking converting and then buying at a higher price.

[59:08] So literally if these are side by side this might be $30 and this might be $5 and you

[59:12] still might be more likely to buy this one.

[59:15] That is the leverage that bring gets you because they for the same ad at the same dollars

[59:19] get more sales for what they put in.

[59:22] And you can see leverage everywhere.

[59:23] If I write code and I write it one time and then millions of people use it that gives me

[59:28] leverage I did work once people use it millions of times.

[59:31] So for example if I write a book then it takes me excellent at the right book.

[59:35] But once the book's written I don't have to work again for the book.

[59:38] But if people keep telling their friends about the book and saying it's good then it continues

[59:42] to sell copies and spread the word that's leverage.

[59:45] I'll give you another one.

[59:46] So if I do this in the beginning I'm probably really inefficient at it.

[59:50] But if I do this for days and days on end I probably realize I get to put my weight on it and

[59:54] you know what I can lock my arm out so I don't have to use my muscles and I can just

[59:57] lower my weight on it to the same.

[59:58] So my skill gets better.

[60:00] And so I get more per unit of effort.

[60:03] And so skill is also another form of leverage.

[60:05] And so one of the most important relationships to get leverage earlier on in your career

[60:10] is understanding what work is.

[60:12] So work which is what you do every day is volume times leverage equals output which means

[60:27] work equals output.

[60:30] So it's not about how hard you work it's about how much you get for the work you do.

[60:34] And so if I have a lot of leverage awesome but if I have a lot of leverage and I do a

[60:39] lot of repetitions then I get even more output.

[60:42] And so the thing is and this is what people don't understand it's in the beginning you

[60:45] need to do volume because volume gives you skill.

[60:47] Skill is leverage.

[60:48] And so for example let's say I'm doing cold calls in the beginning of my career.

[60:52] If I do a hundred cold calls and somebody who's been doing cold calls for ten years and

[60:56] has an amazing skill set does a hundred cold calls he's going to get more appointments

[60:58] booked than I will.

[60:59] So for the same work same volume he's going to get more output.

[61:03] So in a very real way he works more than I did he got more for what he put in.

[61:07] And so there's a reciprocal relationship between volume and leverage because the more

[61:13] you do the better you get and the better you get the more you like it the more you like

[61:17] it the more you do it.

[61:18] And so this is the virtuous cycle of work but you have to get started in the beginning

[61:22] when you have low leverage.

[61:24] And so the only thing you could do is compensate with volume.

[61:27] It means you have to do a thousand door knocks a thousand cold calls a thousand cold emails

[61:31] a thousand pieces of content so that you can start getting good.

[61:35] And so one of my favorite and least favorite things is work smart not hard because the

[61:40] reality of it is that you have to work hard in order to work smart.

[61:44] And so now we just finished keeping your advantage.

[61:46] So you've made even more money and you're continuing to scale your business.

[61:51] And so now we move on to the next part of level three sticking with it because if everything

[61:56] is going well the only thing that can stop you is you.

[61:59] And so I'll give you one of my favorite close and Charlie Munger which I'll paraphrase.

[62:03] He more or less says compounding is the eighth wonder of the world and the objective of

[62:07] compounding is to never interrupt it.

[62:09] And so he talks about this to stop people from day trading and get a people buy in and

[62:13] out of stocks.

[62:14] He says you should be willing to buy a company and have the stock market be closed for the next

[62:18] five years because you bought a share of a company and you believe it's going to go up

[62:21] for a long period of time.

[62:23] So that's why you buy high quality businesses.

[62:25] But the concept of not interrupting compounding is one of the key philosophies that I have

[62:30] around focus focus is one of the most important things of entrepreneurs.

[62:35] And if you talk to the most successful entrepreneurs they talk about ruthlessly focusing

[62:39] for long periods of time.

[62:41] And Steve Jobs was famous for grilling his direct reports and asking them when he would

[62:46] start meetings what if you said no to lately.

[62:49] So I define focus by the quality and quantity of things you say no to.

[62:58] So if you say yes to many things then you are not focused.

[63:03] If you say no hypothetically to literally everything except for one thing you would define

[63:08] that person is incredibly focused probably obsessive.

[63:12] But like imagine a kid for example who did nothing but play video games all day.

[63:16] He's incredibly focused on videos he doesn't eat he doesn't sleep I'm saying hypothetically

[63:20] does nothing else he's incredibly focused.

[63:22] At some point I'm not saying you do that but it points out the hypothetical stream of what

[63:26] focus really is.

[63:28] And so some people claim to be focused but it's not are you focused you're not it's how

[63:31] focused are you.

[63:32] And so if you followed any of my stuff at all I talk about the woman the red dress and the

[63:37] reason I love this analogy is it's perfect.

[63:39] So in the matrix there's this moment if you haven't seen the movie where Morpheus who's

[63:44] the guy or the teacher in the story is teaching Neo the main character about how the matrix

[63:48] works.

[63:49] And so they're walking through a crowded city he's talking about something and he says we

[63:52] look at we're listening to me we're looking at the woman the red dress and he says what

[63:56] and he says look again and he says and when he looks again there's a gun pointed his head

[64:00] and so he says if you're not one of us you're one of them and so these are agents

[64:04] agents basically are the things that disrupt everything in the system and so what appears

[64:10] to be a woman in the red dress what appears to be this shiny object this amazing thing

[64:14] that catches your attention this big opportunity you think you should leave your current

[64:18] thing for that is often agent in disguise meant and sent to kill you and destroy your

[64:24] progress and your focus but let me tell you how to set this this is and this is what it

[64:28] looks like for entrepreneurs and so there's five stages that I think entrepreneurs go

[64:33] through in the beginning you have zero right and then you have uninformed optimism which

[64:40] means that you don't know what you're talking about but it looks really good this is the

[64:43] grass's greener on the other side then you have informed pessimism which is now that I

[64:50] got into it oh it actually isn't that easy to make money in this thing even though my

[64:54] cousins do any is actually doing it for five years there's all these other things I

[64:57] didn't know about but now you know about you like this is actually a little harder than

[65:00] I thought then if you keep going you have the value of despair this is where everyone

[65:05] gives up and everyone stops trying now what happens most times is they never get to step

[65:11] four what happens again well I'll tell you stuff four and they'll tell you what happens

[65:15] so step four is you get to informed optimism so now remember they're optimistic

[65:20] of them here now you're informed about it so you're like okay I get what it takes

[65:26] to make this work and I can see away from me to win and then finally you get to

[65:31] hear which is you achieve the goal right you do what you set out to do to begin

[65:35] with but you have to go through the value of the spirit this happens in every

[65:38] single business especially when you're starting out but what happens for most

[65:42] entrepreneurs is dotted line they started all over again and so they say oh you

[65:50] know what I'm gonna go find my point of uninformed optimism because there's

[65:53] another thing it's not trop shipping it's crypto it's not crypto it's whole

[65:58] sale it's not whole selling it's insert whatever opportunity you think is

[66:02] quick and easy and I promise you none of them are because think about this way if

[66:05] something were quick and easy everyone would do it and already be winning so I

[66:09] want to break this myth and half because I think it's so important because it is

[66:13] the number one thing that destroys most businesses is disrupting compounding and I

[66:17] think part of the reason that this myth is proliferated is because the people who

[66:21] are selling you that myth make money on you buying their solution and so what they

[66:25] do is they say oh the average millionaire has seven income streams right and so

[66:30] you think oh millionaire is have seven income streams therefore I should have that's

[66:34] like saying oh the average billionaire has a private jet therefore I should fly

[66:37] private to be a billionaire it confuses sequence it's not that you get tall when

[66:43] you play basketball it's that tall people play basketball and so for you in your

[66:48] career most people who make a lot of money focus all of their eggs in one

[66:53] basket and then once they've achieved all this success then they diversify

[66:57] but after they diversify their returns go down not up bill gates for example if

[67:03] he had never sold his Microsoft shares right now would be a trillionaire he

[67:07] would be worth one and a half trillion today instead he's worth a hundred to a

[67:11] hundred and fifty billion and the main reason is because he diversified after he

[67:16] focused all of his wealth building into Microsoft now Steve Bulmer his number two

[67:21] man in the very beginning had a much much much smaller shares I think Bulmer

[67:24] has like two or three percent a tiny slice of Microsoft Bill Gates said 49

[67:29] percent when they went public so he had half the company and so today Steve

[67:33] Bulmer his number two is almost as wealthy as Bill Gates because he has

[67:39] stayed focused this whole time and never liquidated his shares and continue to

[67:43] grow Microsoft and so they want to feed you this myth that somehow one seventh

[67:48] of you split between all these things they say try a bunch of stuff see what

[67:51] works the reality is any of these things can work if you concentrate all of

[67:57] your attention in to going then see overflows then that is how you get an

[68:04] overflowing opportunity you keep working you keep doubling down on it and you

[68:09] say no to the woman of the red dress because you know that she's just the value

[68:13] of his fair she's just an agent in disguise and if you stick with it you will

[68:17] win and that's the thing that separates the people who win from the people who don't

[68:20] is that they can just keep saying no to everything else they keep saying yep you

[68:25] know what that's amazing opportunity for someone else that's an amazing

[68:29] opportunity for someone else and let me show you this mathematically so let's

[68:32] say that you're in your third month your third week your third year whatever

[68:38] increment you want of you developing some skill right you continue to get a

[68:42] little bit better every single year fine now you see this new opportunity

[68:47] that you're at ground zero four and you think man I think I could grow faster

[68:51] by doing this thing and so you have to reason let's say get you're on your

[68:56] four of opportunity number one that instead of saying okay woman to go to

[69:00] you know I'm gonna go to my fifth year so you're not you haven't done this yet

[69:02] so this is hypothetical instead you say you know what I'm gonna start this new

[69:05] opportunity and new opportunity I'm gonna be here which is higher than where I

[69:09] was before and it's gonna be a double the rate okay but now I'm on your two

[69:12] here guess where I'm gonna be if I'm on your two past this on this opportunity

[69:16] and so you can't compare year two here to year two here you have to compare year

[69:22] two here to year five here and so this increment I promise you it's significantly

[69:28] easier to take something from ten million dollars to fifteen million dollars

[69:31] than it's taken from zero to five in a year she finished keeping your advantage

[69:35] and sticking with it and you've made even more money we just keep making money

[69:40] we're crazy and so we move on to the last and final step of level three get

[69:45] better and keep getting better and so one of the key skills that I've

[69:49] developed over my career that I want to share with you is the ability to learn

[69:53] but not in the way that you might think traditionally and so what happens is

[69:57] sure in the beginning you want to get from courses and experts in things

[70:00] like that but over time what you want to double down on is volume because

[70:03] what volume does is it gives you data and then data you could do something

[70:07] called a common factors analysis so let's say that I make ten pieces of

[70:11] content okay these are my ten pieces of content with it's ten alright now that

[70:17] means that within those top ten pieces of content there's gonna be a top one

[70:21] and there's gonna be a bottom one and this is gonna be the one that did better

[70:24] and this is gonna be the one that did the worst and so what I want to do is see

[70:28] what did the top 10% have that this one didn't have what are the discrepancies

[70:33] between these two and those discrepancies are the golden nuggets that build

[70:38] together to help you acquire skills and so one of the things that people

[70:43] shy away from in the beginning is how low leverage you are you have no capital

[70:47] you have no friends you have no other people can up yet so it's just you and

[70:50] when you start you suck but the thing is is that the pain of how bad it is and

[70:55] how hard it is in the beginning is the thing that forces you to seek out

[70:58] better ways to do it and so you have to go through that pain so that

[71:03] you can seek out these improvements and then all of a sudden you figure out a new

[71:06] way to use that lever that takes one tenth to the time you figure out how to tweak

[71:10] your email headings to get way more open rates or you tweak your offer to get way

[71:13] more responses or you make your ad hooks better so you get higher you know people

[71:17] clicking the ad all of those things are skills and so this pain and this volume and

[71:23] this is the poor part getting a feedback loop going is what creates skill so it's not

[71:28] just doing a lot you have to do a lot so that you can see what works

[71:32] so that you can get better fundamentally common factors analysis is how I learn everything

[71:38] because a lot of the skills that I have to learn now are things that no one teaches there's no

[71:42] courses for what I'm trying to learn now and so I have to just try a lot of things and see

[71:47] huh what are the top 10% have in common and this works for figure out your customer habits

[71:52] are you're like hey what are my top 10% of customers what are they having common in terms of

[71:56] what they did and who they are what are the bottom 10% what did they do and who are they okay

[72:01] well I want less of those and more of these and so this is a continuous loop that you do on your

[72:05] customers the same thing works in your content where the top 10 pieces and the bottom 10 pieces

[72:09] what are the top 10 ads and the bottom 10 ads what are the top 10 of perfect sales scripts

[72:14] in terms of recordings what do we say differently on those calls then we said on these calls

[72:18] it literally applies to everything and that continuous loop of progress and feedback is how you

[72:24] get better and that is the core of leverage from a skills perspective and so right now if you're

[72:29] watching this video maybe a million dollars is your goal and if it is your goal then you have to

[72:33] deconstruct it to what you need to do from the very beginning and what are the actions that I have to take

[72:38] and you take these actions so that you can look at what worked and what did it so that you can get better

[72:43] and so this is fundamentally how you create goals and no this isn't your mom's goal video because

[72:50] you've already seen it this isn't about smart goals this is about your relationship with your goals

[72:54] and so this is something that I don't see people talk about but you have a relationship with your

[72:59] goals it is something that you're willing to sacrifice in order to keep and so when I think about this

[73:03] for myself I had a conversation with Leyla for example where I said you know what I define love

[73:09] as what you're willing to give up in order to keep something and so you say hey man that guy

[73:13] I brought he must love that car because he's he continues to keep working on an over and over again

[73:17] it still doesn't work he must love that thing because of what he's willing to put up in order to keep it

[73:22] and so if we think about that as the measuring stick of how much not do I love something we're not

[73:26] at how much do I love something then you can see in a very real way how much do you really

[73:31] love your goals are you willing to lose a friend over it are you willing to give that up in order

[73:35] to keep your goals are you willing to give up a girlfriend for it in order to keep your goals are you

[73:39] willing to give up a wife or a spouse for it in order to keep your goals for me the answer is honestly

[73:45] yes and the reason that I have such an intimate relationship with my goals sounds kind of weird

[73:49] is because my goals have fed me more than anything in my life they have helped me

[73:55] become the person that I want to be because they have oriented my behavior to help me do the

[74:01] activities that create the character traits that create the outcomes and so I use that as my

[74:06] filter for the people who are in my world so if someone comes in my world and I think

[74:10] do I need to sacrifice my goals in order to keep you now a lot of times it's not an all-out sacrifice

[74:15] sometimes I just ask the question is my goal achievement more or less likely with this person in my life

[74:21] and oftentimes it's just neutral which then for me is okay well then you're going to drain

[74:25] me of resources that don't get me to my goals that I could otherwise those marbles

[74:29] that I could otherwise keep focused on the main thing which means I have to say no to this because

[74:33] I choose my goals over that now this may sound extreme and that's because it is but you can't

[74:40] want to be exceptional and not be willing to be the exception it is normal to be not normal to have

[74:47] not normal outcomes if you can't expect this is a preference thing from the closest you can't

[74:53] want my outcomes but want it your way if you change the variables you change the outcome and what I

[74:58] can tell you universally is that the people who achieve outsized returns are the ones who did

[75:03] outsized work and more specifically made outsized sacrifices in order to continue to be able to

[75:08] pour in to that which mattered most and so I'll I'll be real with you for a second I've hit my

[75:14] million dollar goal I hit my hundred million dollar goal and now I've been pretty public I'm

[75:18] trying to document everything that I do to hit a billion in beyond and at the same time the

[75:23] billion dollar goal matters a ton to me and at the same time not at all because the billion dollar

[75:29] goal is not because I want to hit a billion dollars for some reason I can't buy anything I can

[75:33] buy at a billion that I can't really buy now that that I can consume as an individual sure maybe

[75:38] I buy companies or buy big buildings or something like that but it doesn't actually change my

[75:42] but the reason that I hold on to that billion dollar goal is because I would like to meet the man

[75:46] who I would become who's able to achieve that and so for me the quantitative measure of what my

[75:53] business has grown has been an indicator of my personal growth and so I have a belief that either

[75:58] your business is growing or you are and so when your business is growing is going down guess what you're

[76:02] usually growing a ton because it's painful and that's why they call growing pains not growing joys

[76:07] it's not fun but the thing is is that most things in life aren't fun decline is painful stagnation

[76:13] is painful growth is painful the question is which of those pains get you close to where you want to

[76:18] follow the steps in this video and hit your million but you should want to make as soon as you hit

[76:22] the million set it for 10 and as soon as you had 10 set it for 100 not because you need the money

[76:27] because but because you want to meet the man or woman who's capable of making that a reality

[76:33] the biggest gains in life the best players in life play infinite games because the objective isn't

[76:40] to win you're not going to win at business like take it to the natural stream let's see

[76:44] become the richest man in the world let's hit historically at the richest man none of them was

[76:48] the richest man for their entire lives they touch the top for a brief second for a year for two years

[76:54] and then they disappear or they die so it's this whole idea that's not even true you don't win

[77:00] the point of business is to stay in business that is why it's an infinite game the point of marriage is not to get married

[77:07] it's the stamory the point of fitness and health isn't to get fit or get healthy it's to stay healthy and so most of the

[77:14] games were playing in life are not finite games they're infinite and so if you can adopt this learning mentality

[77:20] then there is no end because you

[77:23] are the asset you are the outcome and so by saying that you are finished playing means that you are finished becoming

[77:32] and for me I don't want to stop getting better until the day I die so we started your journey to your first

[77:36] million by figuring out what skills you needed to have what knowledge you needed to know to get started then

[77:40] figured out who you were going to sell to then what you were going to sell them then figured out how to

[77:45] advertise and close in order to get them to buy then from there we increased how much they were

[77:49] if I get them them by more times then we recruited the people who need to be our team to help us along the way in

[77:55] scale then we keep and expand our advantage through leverage and stick with it to unlock compound and

[78:01] growth of the business and ourselves and then finally we get better through continuous learning loop

[78:06] and that is how we get to first building and if you enjoyed this click the next video which is

[78:12] 13 years of brutally honest business advice because at this point hopefully you'll have your

[78:17] personal link or be on the way to it and then I'm going to get you with some harsh truths of getting from one to ten to be on

[00:00] What's going on everyone? Happy Saturday. Today, I wanted to make this podcast for you

[00:08] because I got off the phone with Ed Turnney and he and I had a long conversation about a wide

[00:14] breath of topics and he was like, dude, you should talk more about this kind of stuff. And so what I

[00:19] want to do is actually share with you kind of my experience of having the chip on my shoulder and

[00:26] kind of where it got me and what I learned in the process. And so if you have any kind of like

[00:34] thoughts around trying to beat someone and like you're going to take these guys down and like all

[00:39] this stuff and I know many many people in this space you know fill that way towards me.

[00:45] I can tell you having literally gone through the entire process. It's really interesting.

[00:52] So like when I had my gyms I wrote this huge essay and it was for myself because I actually

[00:57] have a creative writing background that most people don't know about. But I entitled it that everyone

[01:05] wishes for the American dream and roots for you for the American dream until it comes true. And I

[01:10] felt that way with my clients, you know, they were rooting for me when I was sleeping on the floor. They're

[01:13] like good for you, like pursuing your dreams. And but as time went on you know and I started

[01:20] to be able to hire people and we started making more money and eventually I didn't have to work

[01:23] in the business. They're like, oh you're too good for us now, like, a big businessman, right?

[01:28] And everyone roots for you until you do better than them. And so what ends up happening is that you

[01:36] have to set higher in her goals for yourself to drive yourself, right? And for me I definitely was an

[01:43] angrier person or maybe I'm just better at hiding it. But I was a fully angrier about stuff.

[01:49] And I set this goal that I was going to beat Baydross. If you guys were called who Baydross

[01:55] cooling in and he said, big guru or was big guru in the gym space, he had to put body. And

[02:03] and I started telling myself all of these things, you know what I mean? Like how he's wronging

[02:08] people and he's ripping people off. And I would tell myself these stories, you know what I mean?

[02:12] To try and like get myself amped up about like how I'm just going to like write the industry

[02:16] and do everything and I'm going to be bigger than him and like all this stuff, right?

[02:21] And the reality is, you know, as time went on and you know, gym won't screw and we grew and grew

[02:29] and you know, I'm not, I don't know, it is numbers are but I'm fairly certain that our coaching

[02:35] has been bigger than his in this space at least for a while. And when I got there, you know,

[02:43] I guess to the heart, you know, to match that in surpass. First off, I found that it was incredibly

[02:50] empty. But secondly, I felt and realized that he was completely unaffected. He had, he was still

[03:02] incredibly wealthy. He had other entrepreneurial endeavors he was pursuing. And this my success

[03:08] in no way affected his life. And it was one of the most humbling and also freeing moments of my life

[03:18] when I realized that because he wasn't an enemy. I doubt I was even, you know, like a blip on the radar

[03:27] during that time and me, obviously, they know who we are now. But it didn't affect his life.

[03:35] And all this malicious, you know, this vengeance, this vandeta that I had, like the only person that

[03:42] poisoned was me. And, you know, there's two sides to this coin on one side. You have like the drive.

[03:51] You know, if you guys have seen the Jordan documentary talks about how you used to make things up

[03:54] that other people would say about them that they never actually said. And I feel like it's kind of like

[03:58] that and it's, and that chip on your shoulder does drive you. So I can't say it didn't drive me,

[04:03] but I don't think it made me a happier person. And so, and believe me, I'm not the guy who's like

[04:08] go, go hug trees and be happy, like I'm all about the chiefing stuff. So like Bell means go do whatever

[04:14] works for you. But I can tell you that seeing it truly, seeing my success not in any way,

[04:25] impact someone else's success really radically transformed my feelings about competitors, about the

[04:33] space, about the industry, about other coaches in general, about what I was willing to do to help

[04:39] other coaches, et cetera, it really transformed me. I started calling up other people who were in

[04:46] our space and just saying like, hey, how can I help you grow? And they're like seriously.

[04:49] And I'm like, yeah, I'm like, I mean, you're not going to take my stuff and I'm not going to take

[04:53] your stuff because people are attracted to different people for different reasons. You know, people,

[04:58] like everyone has different psychographics that they attract. Like I'm 81% male. Like women in general

[05:02] don't find my content of healing. I'm just like, like those are the, that's the data, right?

[05:08] Those are the stats. But the thing is that by, by freeing myself of this, I realized it didn't

[05:15] impact my success at all and other people growing with, you know, with me helping or without me helping

[05:21] didn't affect my success either. But it did massively affect my mental well-being.

[05:26] And so I guess there's two sides to this message that you can take. One is, if you were the,

[05:33] the line climbing of the mountain, um,

[05:37] biomeans stay hungry as hell. Do whatever it takes for you to stay motivated.

[05:41] But I would say, don't, don't do anything stupid. You know, don't, don't, don't, don't,

[05:47] say anything. Don't, don't, don't take massive, you know, malicious attacks. I didn't do that.

[05:52] But I'm just saying like, don't do that because you will end up burning bridges. I've had a lot of

[05:57] people do that to me and I'm sure beters has had it too. And you know, something that's been

[06:01] in the space for a long time have had people do that. And what is of happening is that you just kind of

[06:06] burn your reputation and, you know, what's going to happen is somebody who's taken a massive, you know,

[06:11] swipe it may, um, you know, they're going to want to do a deal with someone else. And that guy's going to

[06:17] call me and he's like, what do you think about this guy? I'm like, I think he's a little bit, I think he's

[06:20] naive. I think he's, I think he's new, but I think he's small bones. I think he's an emotional person.

[06:25] I don't think he's able to restrain himself. I think he's very volatile. I wouldn't do business with

[06:30] him if it were me. You can do it every one. And I would just be like, this is my experience with it.

[06:35] I would, I don't touch people like that with the 10 foot pole, but do what you want.

[06:39] And usually when people hear that, you know, from someone that they think is less volatile,

[06:43] they will usually heed that advice. And there's been probably a lot of people who have taken

[06:48] attacks at me who somehow find things that just fall through for them. And that may or may not have

[06:53] been as a result of, you know, me, but the point is that I think that that anger,

[06:58] use it to fuel yourself, but don't, don't use it to attack. It just doesn't end up going well.

[07:04] And also, people make associations with how they feel about what you say. And so if you're always talking

[07:11] negatively in general about other people, people will not remember who you were talking about, but they

[07:15] will remember how you made them feel and they will associate the negativity with you. And so that's

[07:20] something that I learned early on in like some of the persuasion books and I was like, oh, okay, I need to

[07:24] watch out for that. And so it's hard for me, especially because I was like so angry or when I was younger,

[07:30] that to not do that, right? And so that's one side of it, right, is if you were, if you were climbing

[07:36] the mountain. And I guess the message to the other side is that like, it's just, you're not going

[07:43] to affect anything. Like you're not going to hurt anyone by your success. And that's like, that's

[07:47] probably the biggest message I can give is like, you're not going to hurt anyone. Like it's not,

[07:52] like you're not going to hurt anyone. Like when people make swipes at me, it's like, it doesn't hurt

[07:54] me. Like it doesn't affect me at all. Like it doesn't affect my business. It doesn't, it just affects you.

[08:02] And I'm only sharing this because like it was something that I think really hurt my mental

[08:05] well-being when I was younger and I, and if I can provide value, you know, I hope that it doesn't

[08:11] affect those people if they see this. So many, and maybe that's you. You know, maybe there's a

[08:18] competitor in your space or maybe there's another, you know, another business down the street that

[08:22] you're like, screw this guy, blah, blah, blah, blah. I can promise you, you would make so much more

[08:26] money if you guys just like talked and shared like best practices because there's so few markets

[08:32] where it's actually winter take all. There's, there's so few, you know what I mean? That it

[08:37] actually works that way and it's a zero-sum game. The reality is that most businesses can't even

[08:42] handle the amount of demand that there is for the service and the solution that they have,

[08:46] the problem that they solve. And the other reality is that there's a lot of people that like

[08:50] things solved in different ways. You know, if Lailon, I were entering the weight loss space,

[08:55] it's not like I have to start attacking weight watchers. You know what I mean? Like there's just

[08:59] certain people who are attracted to that type of messaging. And if Lailon, I got into that space,

[09:04] we probably have a very different angle brand message looking field than they would and we would

[09:08] attract different types of people with different values. And so there's a lot of room and the

[09:14] ocean's very, very big. It's so much bigger than everyone gives it credit for. And that's,

[09:19] I think I told a story recently about a competitor, a competitor, another company is in our space,

[09:25] who's doing this like the same amount as we are and they're not even like marketing on Facebook.

[09:30] And I'm like, are you kidding me? And they have an entire outbound team. And when I heard that,

[09:34] I was just like, gosh, I just like, I continue to have my mental barriers stretched around these

[09:39] concepts. If like, the game is so big. And the only person you hurt when you spit hate is yourself.

[09:45] You hurt your long-term prospects because people at the top do talk. Like, it's it. Like,

[09:50] they're definitely is like, I think I heard Andy for solosatists. It's like, everyone at top

[09:54] just like hanging out. Like, they're all just like, most of us know each other, you know what I mean?

[09:58] And like, we text each other and hey, how's this working for you? How's this work? Like,

[10:01] there's no animosity. Like, I'm friends with a lot of people who are in the gym space who serve

[10:04] your monitors. Like, I have no malicious intent. If someone's like, hey, should I work with someone?

[10:08] So I'm like, give him a shot. You know what I mean? Like, everyone has a different way of doing things.

[10:13] You know, this is what ours works well with. And if you like our style and you like, you know,

[10:17] you like selling hard, you like going high ticket, you like marketing hard. You like focusing on metrics.

[10:23] Like, that's us. You know what I mean? Like, there's people who like more done for you.

[10:26] That's like, that's cool too. Like, there's guys who do that really well.

[10:30] So anyways, I wanted to share this with you because, uh, Ed inspired me.

[10:35] To share this message with you because, um, if you, you know, if you are a ingrereer, you've,

[10:40] you have this, uh, anger inside of yourself. I want to 100% get you. I feel you.

[10:45] But I would just say, try and use it to spur your soft on. Do not use it to throw shade

[10:51] because it will not benefit your well-being and it won't benefit your long-term success. So,

[10:57] anyways, um, hope you found that valuable. Hope you enjoyed this. Um, if you did, leave a like,

[11:02] or comment, or review, or just, uh, listen solemnly. Uh, but anyways,

[11:07] hope you have an awesome day and have you saturday and I'll catch you guys soon. Bye!

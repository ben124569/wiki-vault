[00:00] I wanted to talk to you about a cash flow process

[00:04] that I've been consistently walking through for the last

[00:06] couple months.

[00:08] Part of this started with the book that I'm still currently

[00:10] working on called Building A Better Malice Trapped.

[00:14] And all of that is around how you can increase

[00:17] how much money you make per customer that comes into your

[00:19] business.

[00:20] And so the easiest way to know if you have an issue

[00:22] is think about this single question.

[00:24] So I'm dealing with a lot of agencies on our software side.

[00:27] And what I'm essentially walking them through is a cash flow

[00:30] quadrant, but not the same cash flow

[00:32] quadrant that you'd have in like Robert K. Sockies

[00:34] for his dead poor dad, but a cash flow quadrant for how you can

[00:37] increase the value per customer.

[00:39] Because fundamentally, it's my viewpoint that if a

[00:42] business cannot pay $100 or $200 to get someone in the door,

[00:48] they don't have a marketing problem.

[00:50] They have a business problem, right?

[00:51] They have a cash flow issue.

[00:53] And they don't know how to acquire customers and make cash

[00:55] flow upfront.

[00:56] And so what I'll do is I want to walk you through the

[00:58] forced-at-process that I look at when I'm looking at a customer

[01:02] that's coming in the door.

[01:02] And that doesn't matter what they're coming in on.

[01:04] They could come in on a free offer, they come in on a

[01:07] low-barrier offer like a new client special or something like

[01:10] that that's a $29 thing, $29, it's really matter.

[01:13] Or it could be a straight up value offer where there's no discount,

[01:15] whatever, there's no free, no nothing simply value

[01:19] even provided.

[01:20] So there's sort of fundamentally the three types of offers

[01:22] that exist in the marketplace, free, discount, and value.

[01:25] But all of them can still lead to the same mouse trap.

[01:28] And so the first thing that I'll look at is products.

[01:33] Is there something that we can add on in this sales

[01:36] choreography when someone comes in the door,

[01:38] so we can immediately add a product purchase to bolt on to

[01:41] additional service package.

[01:44] So initial service package could be x period of time,

[01:47] x number of sessions, or a single session done at a discount,

[01:50] or even a single session free, they're going to value

[01:52] a, or whatever.

[01:54] The point is, in this works in any industry, right?

[01:56] You could come in and obviously in the gym and fitness

[01:58] space, the next natural self-aportomics would be supplements, right?

[02:01] If you were in a car practice clinic, the next natural sale

[02:05] might be orthotics or a special pillow or some sort of brace

[02:10] or whatever, right?

[02:11] It's a physical product, some can immediately purchase from you

[02:13] at a very high margin specifically to go with the service

[02:16] that you're also selling them.

[02:18] Another example might be, if you're in the beauty space,

[02:21] you might sell masks or serums or creams, all of those things

[02:26] would be the first quadrant of how you can increase

[02:29] how much you make for a customer, right?

[02:30] So let's say I'm going to use $100 at the average.

[02:33] Like if you can't pay $100 for every person who walks in the door

[02:36] in your marketing, then you're not going to have a business,

[02:39] right?

[02:39] If you can't make a $100 on a customer's coming in

[02:41] in a service space business, you're not going to succeed

[02:43] and has nothing to do with your marketing

[02:44] it's because you don't have this process down.

[02:46] So even if they come in for free, boom, you sell 100,

[02:49] $200 per person in product.

[02:51] You've already broken even on that,

[02:52] but if you still want to really beat and dominate everyone

[02:55] in the market, you go to the second quadrant,

[02:57] which is how can I get them to add on additional services, right?

[03:01] So this might be introducing them to upsells within your core offer.

[03:06] So if you were a facility, a gym facility, for example,

[03:09] you might have your large group training,

[03:11] but you might also have accountability, nutrition coaching,

[03:15] sell my private training, all of those things

[03:16] would be add-ons to the initial core offer.

[03:19] All of those increased the average lifetime value

[03:21] and investment of the new customers coming in,

[03:23] which allows you to make more money, all right?

[03:26] That's in a gym space.

[03:27] If you were looking at a medspa,

[03:29] someone comes in for a Botox treatment or whatever.

[03:33] First thing you're going to do is try and get them

[03:35] to buy a package that's more of the same thing,

[03:38] but then also give them what we'll all

[03:39] consider a menu close, which is,

[03:42] let me show you what other things we have to offer.

[03:44] We have cool sculpting, we have filler,

[03:46] we have microdermabration, we have skin tightening,

[03:49] we have whatever, right?

[03:50] All of those things would be showing them

[03:52] what other services it offers you have for that

[03:55] exact customer so that they can become more value of you

[03:59] and that you can become more value of them, right?

[04:01] So cashflow quadrant number one is product,

[04:03] cashflow quadrant number two is add-ons services.

[04:06] Number three is more from a,

[04:10] for somebody who's more capital-constraining

[04:11] wants to make more money per customer up front,

[04:14] you can add on prepaid or financing.

[04:17] And so if you're in a really established industry,

[04:19] you can get financing companies to do this

[04:20] for your care credit is massive in the healthcare industry.

[04:23] People get, you know, get boot jobs finance,

[04:25] they get anything finance through care credit, right?

[04:28] If you can establish that in your business,

[04:29] you can get sometimes half or more to finance the packages

[04:34] that they may have purchased from you.

[04:35] So the third piece there is just simply asking

[04:39] and offering a 10% discount to get some to prepaid

[04:42] and there's a key note there.

[04:44] You don't say paid and full, you some offer someone

[04:46] to prepaid, that's the language around that,

[04:48] to drag some of that revenue up front or cash up front

[04:53] so that you can further liquidate the cost of acquisition.

[04:55] Now, let me show you how powerful this is

[04:57] with a single math example.

[04:59] If you have 10 people who walk in your door

[05:02] and let's say you self-five with them, all right?

[05:04] And one of those five does a prepaid on your service, right?

[05:08] And let's say everybody else averaged out to $500

[05:13] for their, for the initial purchase,

[05:14] but one of them paid $2500, right?

[05:18] That $12500 sale increases the average ticket

[05:21] from 500 to 1000 across all of the customers

[05:24] that you had in the door.

[05:25] So even if a small percentage take that offer,

[05:28] it can be a massive increase in the average order value,

[05:30] average cart value, average cash per show,

[05:32] whatever way you wanna call it.

[05:34] And can change the game in terms of

[05:35] how you can acquire customers and beat out

[05:38] the people in your competitive space.

[05:40] All right, so I want for, I've said three so far.

[05:42] So product is number one, add on services number two,

[05:46] getting people to prepaid for services

[05:48] that are happening in the future number three.

[05:51] And then number four is continuity.

[05:53] So is there a way that we can also tie continuity

[05:56] into this acquisition process, right?

[05:58] So I'm gonna not do the gyms

[06:01] because everything I do is about gyms,

[06:02] so I'm gonna try and apply this in a different setting.

[06:05] So let's say we have, I mean, a Met's Bison

[06:08] easy one to use because there's broken up.

[06:09] So someone comes in for a discount Botox, right?

[06:12] First thing there, they might not make the surgeon

[06:14] or the Met's Bison or Met,

[06:15] or I might not make a lot of money that first transaction,

[06:17] they might make a couple hundred dollars,

[06:18] but that should at least cover the cost per show.

[06:21] The next thing they're gonna do is give them products, right?

[06:25] The products that are gonna go with that might be

[06:27] the serums, the max at home,

[06:29] because everything that someone's coming in for there

[06:31] wants to look younger and more beautiful, right?

[06:33] And so all the products that would go along with that

[06:36] would immediately be sold from a take home kit standpoint.

[06:39] Like if you wanna maintain these results

[06:40] or extend these results, you should have these things.

[06:42] The next would be our menu close, right?

[06:45] Do you wanna do microdroomederation?

[06:46] Do you wanna do the cool sculpting?

[06:47] Do you wanna do filler?

[06:48] Whatever, right?

[06:49] Then we're gonna prescribe a package

[06:53] that's gonna be their total beauty package,

[06:56] which might take six months or whatever

[06:57] to get them to where they wanna be.

[06:59] And then the continuity that we're gonna time to this

[07:02] is a process that I like to call downselling the upsell, all right?

[07:06] And so what that is is,

[07:07] typically you'll wanna have people pay more in the beginning

[07:09] because it costs more to a part,

[07:10] cost more to onboard a customer

[07:12] than it does to maintain a customer.

[07:14] And so if we're getting more cash up front for these customers,

[07:17] they're gonna be more invested in our process

[07:19] and it also allows us to cover the overhead

[07:20] of getting them activated,

[07:21] getting them onboard and giving them a great experience.

[07:24] But then you can simply offer them

[07:26] the same thing that they've been getting

[07:29] but just on a recurring basis

[07:31] and do it at a pretty decent discount

[07:33] and most people will jump at that offer.

[07:35] What it does is then locks that person

[07:36] into regular recurring cash flow for the business

[07:39] and then massively extends the lifetime value of the customer.

[07:42] And so I'm gonna walk you through one single math example

[07:45] that I'll sign off.

[07:45] But hopefully you can look at that quadrant

[07:47] with the scenery existing sales processes

[07:49] and say how can I implement each of these four things

[07:52] into the sales choreography of my business so that

[07:55] I can outspend my competition so that

[07:58] I can spend $500 per person who walks in the door,

[08:00] $1,000 per person who walks in the door.

[08:02] And the reason that's so important is because if you can get that

[08:05] cash per show high enough,

[08:07] then you can spend on multiple different channels of acquisition.

[08:11] You can have referral partners.

[08:12] You can have, you can have cold traffic.

[08:14] You can have affiliates.

[08:16] You can have all of these different venues.

[08:17] You can have, you can have direct mail.

[08:19] You can have social media stuff.

[08:21] You can like all of these different venues

[08:22] cost different amounts but at a certain point,

[08:24] all of them become affordable.

[08:26] And that is what unlocks the huge amounts of growth

[08:28] that are available for a business owner

[08:29] and it comes from the back not the front.

[08:32] And so everyone thinks they have a marketing problem

[08:34] but typically it's because they have a monetization issue.

[08:36] They're not good at cash flowing or choreographing

[08:39] the money that they're making per customer.

[08:43] So to bring this all home, what we're trying to figure out

[08:47] is how much can we make up front in the first 30 days

[08:50] and then what's the lifetime value of the customer?

[08:52] The cash value for the first 30 to 60 days

[08:54] is going to be important for how you spend money

[08:57] to get them in the door.

[08:58] The lifetime value on the back end

[09:00] is going to be how much money you're going to be able to extrapolate

[09:02] in how much revenue you make per month

[09:03] based on your sales volume.

[09:05] So for example, if you sell 20 people every single month

[09:08] and you know that your lifetime value per customer

[09:11] is $2,000 total and you sell 20 customers per month total

[09:16] that it means that your business should cap out

[09:19] at 20 times 2000, which will be $40,000 a month.

[09:22] And that's an easy way to back into.

[09:24] Like if you feel like your business has not been able to grow,

[09:26] it's because one of two to two numbers,

[09:27] either you're not capturing enough on the back end

[09:30] or you don't have a big enough inflow.

[09:32] That is it.

[09:33] It's all there is to it.

[09:34] You can massively simplify this.

[09:36] Now, if we're looking at trying to back into that number,

[09:40] so let's take a business A that can only pay $100 per show,

[09:44] which means they're not making a lot of money.

[09:45] And then option B is we've got a business like a $1,000 show.

[09:49] Let's see if we can reverse engineer a $1,000 per show

[09:54] into a business model.

[09:55] So if someone comes in and let's make it in a track

[09:58] to front or an offer.

[09:58] Let's make it a $19 new client special, whatever.

[10:03] Evaluation.

[10:04] It doesn't really matter what industry it is.

[10:05] It works the same way.

[10:07] So someone comes in for a $19 thing.

[10:09] They show up.

[10:11] From there, let's say that we know that we're going to close half

[10:15] onto the next service package.

[10:18] Now that next service package, let's say the average is going

[10:20] to be $2,000.

[10:22] Now that's going to be over an extended period of time.

[10:24] Cool.

[10:25] Let's say that our minimum that we can get down

[10:26] is $500 because that's what we say is minimum in order to buy.

[10:29] And that's why we're closing half and not 100%.

[10:31] The next thing we do is we sell $200 per customer.

[10:36] Now if $2,000 is with the packages and we closed half,

[10:38] we're at $1,000 in lifetime value.

[10:41] Just from that first transaction, half times $2,000 is a thousand.

[10:45] Now of all those people that say yes,

[10:48] now let's say we sell each of those people $200 for the product.

[10:52] Now we added $200 now we're at $1,200

[10:55] lifetime value.

[10:56] Then let's say two out of those five people

[10:59] that we sold for example.

[11:02] Decide to add on an additional $1,000 for the services.

[11:06] All right, from your other service offerings that you have.

[11:09] All right, so now we've got two fifths times a thousand,

[11:14] which would be $400 that we add again to the customer.

[11:19] So now we're at $1,600 per show.

[11:24] And then again, on the back of that we say,

[11:26] hey, we know that from every of the five that we have,

[11:29] we can get, let's say another two to sign on as a continuity

[11:34] at $200 month and we turn out at 10%,

[11:37] which tax another $2,000 onto two of those customers.

[11:41] All right, and so that would add yet another $800 on top.

[11:48] So you get $2,400 per person that walked in the door

[11:52] for a free offer.

[11:53] All right, that is how you can beat everyone in your marketplace

[11:57] is that you consistently execute the process.

[12:01] That means every single time you have a choreographed handoff

[12:05] between service A or service 1 and sale number 2,

[12:08] sale number 2 and sale number 3, sale number 3 and sale number 4.

[12:11] And if part of you is like, man, I feel like I'd be selling

[12:13] all the time, yes is the answer.

[12:16] But the secondary correlate to that is that,

[12:19] if you look at the research that exists on how to maintain

[12:23] a customer over the long haul,

[12:25] it's about expansion revenue.

[12:28] It's about a sentient.

[12:29] It's about selling them more things over time

[12:33] so that they can continue to be reminded of the value

[12:35] that you provide, because over time people always want

[12:37] new things.

[12:38] And so it is your duty if you believe in the value

[12:41] that you provide to make the offers to those people

[12:45] and communicate that process in a seamless way

[12:48] so that every part of your business knows,

[12:50] my objective is passing the baton from point B to point C

[12:54] from point C to point D.

[12:55] And all of that choreograph process ultimately results

[12:59] in a front end that allows you to spend whatever you want

[13:02] per customer because you're back in a so strong.

[13:05] And that process, that cash flow quadrant

[13:08] is the reason that Jim launch has been able to stay

[13:10] number one in this industry,

[13:12] despite the saturation, despite the charlatans,

[13:15] despite the many people who would claim

[13:17] that they're doing the same thing, but they're not,

[13:20] because they don't execute that process.

[13:22] And at the end of the day,

[13:23] what you are always going to be pay-forced

[13:25] the value that you can create the marketplace.

[13:27] We've been able to choreograph that process

[13:29] for the businesses that we serve,

[13:31] so that they make more per customer

[13:32] and so that their customers are better served.

[13:34] And that's ultimately what you have to do

[13:36] what we have to do is entrepreneurs and business owners

[13:38] is how can I serve my customer in the highest

[13:39] and best degree ever?

[13:41] And how can I do it in a seamless way as possible

[13:43] so that I can have as little operational drag as possible

[13:46] so that I can outmarket my competition

[13:50] and continue to play the game.

[13:51] So anyways, that cash flow,

[13:55] the quadrant is how I think through the choreography

[13:59] around creating selling systems

[14:02] so that our gyms and our businesses

[14:05] can beat out their competition

[14:06] and I would encourage you to print that out,

[14:08] put it somewhere so you can think about

[14:10] every single sales process that you have through that lens

[14:13] and I guarantee you that you'll make more money.

[14:15] That's what, that's what when I do my consulting days

[14:18] and I sell consulting hours,

[14:20] this is the process that I walk through

[14:21] and I'm just as generous as I can to be honest

[14:23] and I'm just as generous as I can to be honest

[14:26] and I'm just as generous as I can to be honest

[14:29] and I'm just as generous as I can to be honest

[14:31] and I'm just as generous as I can to be honest

[14:34] and I'm just as generous as I can to be honest

[14:37] and I'm just as generous as I can to be honest

[14:40] and I'm just as generous as I can to be honest

[14:42] and I'm just as generous as I can to be honest

[14:45] and I'm just as generous as I can to be honest

[00:00] What is going on everyone today?

[00:02] We're going to talk about a fun topic, which is,

[00:05] I got a message yesterday from somebody who said,

[00:08] who's dead broke and was like, what do I do?

[00:10] All that kind of stuff.

[00:11] And so, I think I've talked in the past,

[00:14] I'll probably do another one about when I've lost everything,

[00:17] what I did step by step to,

[00:20] I think that after I lost everything,

[00:22] the next month I did 110,000 or so in sales.

[00:25] And that's sorry, not sales, that was cash collected

[00:27] in the next 30 days.

[00:29] So, like, you absolutely just need skills.

[00:32] You can have nothing else in your life.

[00:34] And a beautiful thing is that no government can take it

[00:35] from you, no person can take your skills from you

[00:38] and divorce.

[00:39] Those are always your own, which is something that,

[00:42] I don't know, for some reason, feels magical to me.

[00:45] And so, one of the things that I've seen,

[00:46] as I've kind of moved up, I'm not saying that,

[00:51] arrogant, you know, just developed, progressed, whatever,

[00:54] is that the people who I surround myself with now

[00:56] have more money than the people that I surround myself

[00:59] when I was early on in my career.

[01:01] And what's ironic is that these people

[01:03] actually spend less money.

[01:06] They have less desire to spend money.

[01:09] And they find ways to acquire things

[01:12] for less money on a pocket.

[01:14] And that's always really interesting to me.

[01:17] And so, right now, I think there's,

[01:19] if you were to look at, quote, investment opportunities, right,

[01:23] you could invest in buying a house.

[01:27] So let's say, let's say you've got, I'll do two scenarios.

[01:30] Let's say you've got $50,000, all right?

[01:33] And you're like, okay, I'm thinking about buying a house, right?

[01:38] And I think for first task,

[01:39] you might only have to put 10% down.

[01:41] I'm not sure, it's 10 or 20.

[01:43] Yeah, oh, remember.

[01:44] But anyways, let's just say 10 for sake of, whatever.

[01:47] So 500,000 warehouse, all right?

[01:50] You put 10% down in the new, get the mortgage, right?

[01:52] You get the liability of the mortgage payment every month.

[01:55] Get it.

[01:57] Now, if you were to, and let's say that in order for you

[01:59] to save that, you've been making, I don't know, 60 grand a year,

[02:03] and you've been saving that for five years, something like that.

[02:06] Now, let's look at an alternative scenario

[02:09] where you are still making that same amount of money, 60,

[02:12] and you saved up 50.

[02:14] And instead of buying a house, you have a long conversation

[02:18] with your spouse, and you say, or maybe you don't have

[02:20] a spouse, whatever with yourself.

[02:22] And you say, I wonder how much money

[02:25] I could get for this money.

[02:28] Interesting, right?

[02:29] And so you leave through the businesses that are in your area.

[02:34] And by the way, the best way to do this

[02:36] is one, you should contact brokers, not necessarily

[02:39] to buy a business, but to get an idea of some of the businesses

[02:42] that are in the area and what price ranges look like.

[02:44] But if you buy from a broker, you're going to pay retail.

[02:47] You could definitely negotiate a deal,

[02:48] and I'll tell you one of the deals that I did.

[02:49] That was really good at the end of this.

[02:52] But anyways, so let's say,

[02:55] you reach out to some businesses, things

[02:57] that you like or enjoy or feel like you have

[02:59] some specialized knowledge in.

[03:01] And you find out that there's a business that's doing,

[03:05] let's say, I don't know, $250,000 a year in profit, right?

[03:14] And because it's a small local loan business,

[03:17] and you're not going to pay retail for it,

[03:19] you get it for two and a half times earnings, right?

[03:23] Which would be, which two and a half times,

[03:26] it's 525, hopefully.

[03:28] You know, thank, two and a half.

[03:29] No, that's 625, excuse me.

[03:30] 625,000 dollars is what a business you might pay

[03:34] for businesses doing 250,000 a year in profit.

[03:38] Now, here's where it's interesting, right?

[03:40] So I had an early mentor who taught me this negotiation

[03:44] tactic that I've used pretty much for that entire life

[03:47] since this moment, and I used it in the deal

[03:49] that I'll tell you about in a second,

[03:51] which is a growing price that I grew on terms, right?

[03:53] And so when you would go to, quote,

[03:55] talk to this business, right?

[03:57] There's the price, which you might say, cool,

[04:00] this business is 625, and then there's terms, right?

[04:04] And so the terms side, once you've agreed on the price,

[04:06] you need to go shit down whatever.

[04:08] And then you say, okay, well,

[04:10] I'm going to need you to sell our finance,

[04:12] meaning you're not going to pay anything

[04:13] you're paying over time, right?

[04:15] I need you to sell our finance,

[04:19] three quarters of the deal, all right?

[04:21] And so three quarters of the deal, man,

[04:23] I'm doing some math today, but like 400,

[04:25] and you know, 30-ish, 437, whatever.

[04:28] $1,000, and you're going to find us that for, you know,

[04:34] three years, right?

[04:36] And then on top of that, or five years,

[04:39] you can do it every one here.

[04:40] I think, I mean, you can probably,

[04:42] I mean, you try and push it out as far as you can, right?

[04:45] And then what you have remaining,

[04:47] which would be like, in this instance, $200,000,

[04:49] then you get a note from the bank, right,

[04:52] or SBA loan, which you have a $200,000 loan for,

[04:55] and you put your 50,000 dollars down, right?

[04:58] So then that would be 250, which would be 25% of $200,000.

[05:04] So I'm going to recap this.

[05:06] 625 is the cost of the business, you know,

[05:09] 437, you get seller finance,

[05:11] meaning you can pay that over time,

[05:13] and then you've got $200,000 that you get a loan from the bank.

[05:15] So, which you put $50,000 for.

[05:18] So if you're thinking about this,

[05:20] the guy who's selling the business,

[05:22] he sells for 625, but he's only getting $200,000 upfront.

[05:26] You're only putting 50 of that 200,

[05:28] and you're taking a loan for the rest of it, right?

[05:32] And so when you're looking at this,

[05:34] you've now acquired this business

[05:35] that makes $250,000 a year, right?

[05:38] So you upgraded your income from 60 to $250,000, right?

[05:44] And within, you know, 24 months,

[05:47] all of that income will be yours,

[05:50] and maybe hopefully you'll grow it,

[05:51] or you'll probably try and work extra hard

[05:53] and take over some of the other positions

[05:55] or cut out some of the waste, et cetera, in the business.

[05:58] And so that massively speeds you up in life, right?

[06:04] And if you compare that to what it would cost you

[06:07] to start your own business,

[06:10] in terms of investment and like existing book of business,

[06:13] client lists, all the knickknacks you have to buy

[06:15] that you don't even think of, zoning permits,

[06:17] and all the fees and licenses,

[06:19] it's actually pretty decent deal.

[06:21] So I'll tell you one of the deals that I did

[06:25] that was pretty good.

[06:26] So I had four locations at this point,

[06:28] this is one of the gyms, and I opened a fifth location.

[06:30] So the first two locations, I opened,

[06:33] I opened the first one I think for $40,000,

[06:35] I mean, I put, I put as little as I possibly could

[06:37] in this thing.

[06:39] And it happened to have been old gyms,

[06:41] so there was like turf already in,

[06:43] the flooring was already in, it was painted,

[06:45] like there was a bunch of things I didn't have to pay for.

[06:46] So I locked out there.

[06:50] And but the second one, because I thought I was smarter,

[06:53] I put 250,000 into the second location.

[06:56] And here's the fun thing.

[06:58] It made no more money than the first location debt,

[07:00] which I always think is hilarious.

[07:02] So like to the undecimed,

[07:04] everything looks like a spending opportunity.

[07:06] And so I pretty much had empty my bank account.

[07:09] And so on my fifth location,

[07:11] my next two locations were corporate locations

[07:13] to actually pretty cheap, which was pretty cool.

[07:16] Those were good deals.

[07:17] But the fifth location that I did,

[07:20] I had a gym that went out of business

[07:21] or he had not out of business.

[07:22] He wanted to uproot because it got divorced

[07:25] or he had some family crisis.

[07:28] And so he was looking for someone to buy his gym.

[07:31] And so it was beautiful.

[07:32] It had all this equipment that was really expensive

[07:34] in it and I was like, man, this is like a dream come true.

[07:36] And so I agreed on price,

[07:38] because I had my mentor talk me through this.

[07:39] I agreed on price, but I think was 40,000.

[07:42] I think he was 40,000.

[07:43] It was 40 or 50.

[07:44] I think he was bit.

[07:45] So that's what I agreed.

[07:46] And then I was like cool, I'll pay you over the next year.

[07:50] And he was like fair enough.

[07:52] And so I made you didn't say like that.

[07:54] We negotiated in the 12 months

[07:55] as what we came to.

[07:57] And so I mean, I tried to go for 24 months.

[08:00] But he agreed on 12.

[08:01] And so the beautiful thing with that was,

[08:04] I didn't put any money out of pocket.

[08:06] So my first gym I put 50 grand in.

[08:08] Second gym I put 250,000 dollars in.

[08:10] Fifth gym, smarter more experienced me,

[08:12] puts no money in.

[08:14] And in the first 30 days we did 51,000 in sales.

[08:18] So this gym in the first 30 days literally paid for itself

[08:22] period.

[08:23] And so this thing is now kicking off profit.

[08:26] Every month during this whole period of time.

[08:30] And then 12 months later, I ended up meeting Russell

[08:32] and telling him how I was doing this stuff.

[08:34] And he was like, you should be teaching other people

[08:35] how to do what you're doing now.

[08:36] And so I ended up selling the gym for one and a half

[08:40] times more than I quote, bought it for, which I then

[08:43] had the gym pay for on its own.

[08:45] And so I basically acquired a cash flowing asset for nothing

[08:49] and then had just acquired a cash flowing asset

[08:52] for no money.

[08:53] And so I think about that in light of the original thing

[08:57] that I mentioned was just like, I get people who message

[08:59] me all the time like, what happens

[09:00] if I don't have any money?

[09:02] I don't know what to do.

[09:03] You always have to just get skills.

[09:04] So this is just my opinion.

[09:05] Is that because there's no one who can take them from you.

[09:07] There's no divorce.

[09:08] There's no government.

[09:09] There's no revolution.

[09:11] There's no financial crisis.

[09:12] I can ever take your skills from you.

[09:14] And that's why when entrepreneurs hit zero,

[09:16] they can usually bounce back.

[09:17] I've done it.

[09:17] I had $1100 in my bank account at one point

[09:21] at my lowest point after I had six gyms.

[09:25] After this.

[09:26] So even when I had this experience in the sounds cool,

[09:28] like I messed up.

[09:29] And that's why I think I love this saying,

[09:33] you only should only have to get rich once.

[09:36] And that's why people who are wealthy are more risk

[09:38] of first because the downside risk of losing everything

[09:40] is always bigger.

[09:42] Like you can reverse 30 years of great decisions

[09:45] with any number multiplied by zero.

[09:48] Any number multiplied by zero.

[09:49] You can have a billion dollars

[09:50] if you make a bad investment, it goes to zero.

[09:53] And so that's why when people are like,

[09:55] I don't know why you're motivated.

[09:56] And I don't know why.

[09:58] There's just always things that can happen.

[10:02] Internet made.

[10:02] And it's just being risk-averse is what I have noticed

[10:04] from the people who have the most money

[10:06] is that they actually have way lower risk tolerance

[10:09] than the people who have no money.

[10:12] Which is hilarious because it's like,

[10:13] the people who have the least amount of money,

[10:15] then go buy lottery tickets, which are literally

[10:18] the worst investment.

[10:19] You can possibly make.

[10:22] And they consistently invest their money

[10:26] in a terrible investment that has all the downside risk

[10:29] of going to zero, whereas the richest people in the world

[10:31] find things that could never go to zero

[10:33] and they buy them for zero.

[10:34] So think about that for a second.

[10:36] People are using their money, poor people, use their money,

[10:39] to buy things that have virtually guaranteed risk

[10:44] of going to zero, with tiny risk of upside, right?

[10:49] Whereas rich people buy stuff for zero dollars

[10:53] that have upside potential, but that doesn't have

[10:58] a billion dollar upside potential.

[10:59] They would rather have a guaranteed small return

[11:01] with no risk than a potential for huge return

[11:05] with guaranteed risk.

[11:07] Think about that.

[11:08] So any who, I think if over time,

[11:10] and it's not like you can shift your perspective on this

[11:12] overnight, it took me a long time.

[11:14] And I still am doing it now in shifting how,

[11:16] like, as I still get excited about,

[11:19] I see these crypto currencies, 20xing and stuff

[11:23] in a month and I'm like, man, that's crazy.

[11:26] But then I also think, well, the downside risk

[11:30] if me going to zero is far more upsetting to me

[11:33] than me getting 20 times more on some tiny investment

[11:36] that I would make.

[11:37] And so I don't do it, right?

[11:40] And so anyways, I say all this to say,

[11:44] a grand prize, a grand terms,

[11:46] trying to get something for nothing,

[11:48] see if you're gonna make an investment

[11:51] and any kind or you're trying to start a business,

[11:53] there's usually a business that's already for sale

[11:55] or has a motivated seller, an owner who doesn't wanna do

[11:58] it anymore who will almost give it to you for free.

[12:00] And that's the thing is when you're new,

[12:02] you're getting so excited, but you're not patient, right?

[12:04] That's why you have to have the character traits

[12:06] of being successful before you will see the success.

[12:09] Because if you have that character trait, you'll look

[12:12] and you'll say, I can take six months

[12:13] because in the decade of my life, there's no rush.

[12:18] But me making a good dealer, bad deal of like,

[12:21] should I put all my investment in this thing

[12:23] or should I be able to get something

[12:24] that makes four times more money for free?

[12:26] You can do that.

[12:27] You can do that.

[12:28] And I'm telling you, I talked to business owners

[12:30] every day, I mean, guys, making a million,

[12:32] two million, four million dollars a year,

[12:35] who literally told me they're like, dude,

[12:36] if someone came today and offered me it,

[12:38] like, guys, we're making a million dollars a million dollars

[12:40] a year in profit.

[12:41] Like, if someone had offered me 200 grand right now,

[12:43] I would take it, I'd just some so tired of this business.

[12:46] So like, there are opportunities.

[12:48] They're just not listed anywhere.

[12:49] You just gotta look for, right?

[12:52] And that's the thing, no one will do it

[12:53] because it's work.

[12:54] So, but the good news is that if you have a little bit

[12:56] of work ethic, you can make a tremendous amount of money

[12:59] with very little risk and do it the way

[13:02] the rich people that I know do it.

[13:03] So, otherwise, have an amazing day

[13:05] keeping awesome in a kitchen, I'm so excited.

[13:07] Bye.

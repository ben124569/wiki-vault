[00:00] Warren Buffett once told the story of his closest friend from Columbia Business School.

[00:05] He said the guy was incredibly smart and incredibly hardworking, really strong ethics, great

[00:09] character, and they kind of were in a similar spot as they graduated. But the outcome of their

[00:16] lives was dramatically different based on the single decision. The friend of his went to the

[00:22] steel business and he said worked very hard and earned him modestly, you know, modestly good

[00:27] living while Warren went and started his first private partnership and then what would eventually

[00:34] become a virtual pathway. And he said this final quote which has always struck me or struck

[00:39] me then and stuck with me since which is what I learned was it's not as important how hard you

[00:46] row but what boat you are in. And so in the video that I'm about to show you this was a

[00:51] presentation that I was given for a keynote and they asked me to talk about what they called

[00:56] level 7 entrepreneurship. So once you kind of they have like levels 1 through 6 that they were talking

[01:01] about level 7 is kind of rising above the businesses and using your businesses as or seeing

[01:05] your businesses almost as products that increase your, you know, personal network, etc. I took that

[01:10] to mean how do we assess and appraise opportunity itself. This is one of my, one of my favorite

[01:16] presentations I've ever given and I hope that you get value from it, Bozene Nation. For those

[01:21] guys you don't know me by the way my name is oxymonyzzy, i own acquisition.com, it's a portfolio

[01:25] of companies that does about $85 million a year. I think these videos just because I think a lot of

[01:29] people are broke and I don't want to be one of them and hopefully some of the lessons that I've

[01:32] learned along the way can help you. So buckle up and enjoy. How's it going? Awesome. Sweet. So I am a

[01:43] level 7 entrepreneur category 5 hurricane level 10 fire breather, top secret security clearance

[01:49] holder. It was kind of weird to hear the context for the talk today because I don't really feel

[01:57] like a level 7 entrepreneur. Just feel like somebody's taking a couple steps forward and one

[02:04] toe after the other. So let's rock and roll. Everybody good with that? Sweet. Zachquisition.com.

[02:12] That's our fancy logo. Awesome. Guys, when you hear something totally insane? Yeah.

[02:19] Oh, I can see it here. Much better. I was able to take home more in a year than the CEO of McDonald's.

[02:27] IKEA, Ford, Motorola, and Yahoo combined as a kidnish 20s. Which is acquitted to over 1.2 million per

[02:42] month and dividends for nearly half a decade. And I haven't talked about it publicly that much

[02:48] mostly because didn't really care to. We're at an interesting point in Ryan asked me to

[02:55] to bring this up. Where we've exited two companies this year, Sultar House, Sultar Car.

[03:01] And I'm kind of in a season right now of consolidation and kind of distilling down what I like to call

[03:08] artifacts. So just frameworks that crystallize the learnings that I can set forth for my next chapter

[03:16] with kind of a backpack full of lessons. And so I have way more frameworks than I will be able

[03:21] to share with you today. That book is the first of 10 books that I'm writing on it. That is really

[03:27] just expanding on one framework. But I'm going to show it with you for today that hopefully you get

[03:32] some good stuff out of. All right. And no one was more surprised than me to hear those numbers.

[03:38] So what's interesting is that me expressing that fact creates envy and some people, anger and others,

[03:45] skepticism and most and confusion in old people. And hopefully inspires us to like few

[03:53] because you guys are who I'm making this for. So these are just a few level seven observations I

[03:58] added in quickly this morning because Ryan asked me to talk about a couple of these.

[04:04] Some things that I've learned. One, everyone wants you to do well, just not better than them.

[04:10] Except that no one actually wants you to be rich except for you. Really mean that.

[04:16] Because if you're not fighting for you, no one else says. Money only solves money problems.

[04:21] And then you're left with problems that money can't solve. You don't arrive. You just enter a new club

[04:28] as the smallest member. The guy who literally lives in the unit directly above me and my building

[04:34] took home one billion this year in income. Not an exit in income. He owns outright 100% owner,

[04:43] 3.8 billion in sales, 26% net margins. And last year took $920 million. You're before that,

[04:51] took him 850 million. Pull guy. So I'm just poor.

[04:59] And one of the last observations I'll say is that this last year, I'd say we fully exited the

[05:09] org chart. And we're making pretty much the same money that I just showed you. And it was wildly

[05:18] boring. And almost depressing. And so I kind of have this thing that like let's make

[05:24] active income cool again because I think passive income is slightly overrated because we all have

[05:29] this desire. We seek freedom. But what I really think we want is options. And we want to

[05:36] engaging activities because we like imagine because all of us buy back all of our time. And imagine

[05:41] you buy all of it back. And you're making all the money. And you do nothing. It's terrible.

[05:51] And so I'm just sharing this with you because that was my goal for such a long time that when I kind of got there,

[05:58] it's not fun. Like all I want to do now is start something else because I've got a lot of

[06:03] summers left. Might as well do something cool. So who wants to hear about stuff that can

[06:10] shortcut your path to material success so that you can ponder the purpose of achieving it to begin with.

[06:16] And so I think that there's something to be said for intention behind how you create your business

[06:23] and people can feel why you're doing things. Total tangent I was talking to a buddy of mine who

[06:29] just sold his company for 200 million. And he said you know what's interesting is that when you

[06:34] talk to most people, he said 99% of people are plugged into the matrix. And what you meant by that is

[06:39] that they're operating from a place of lack and a place of desire to get other people to give them

[06:46] money. That's kind of where they operate from. You said when you exit the matrix, it's very rare,

[06:52] but you'll see that when you make things just for the sake of making them like art,

[06:57] then they take on a whole different form. And this book is kind of the first of the many things

[07:02] that I hope to create from that same space. And so anyways, I hope you enjoy it if you do pick it up.

[07:07] And hopefully I'll prove to you some enough value for 99 cents. So how I turned $1,036 into $85 million

[07:15] a year in portfolio revenue in five years using four frameworks. And that is December 20th, 2016.

[07:21] So your life can change pretty quickly. So that was me when I started. I didn't have to have money

[07:30] for rent. So I slept there. Skiet those locations from and always still pits me.

[07:39] Mostly because I'm just grateful for what we're at now. Anyways, I'm sorry. Skiet these locations

[07:46] from 0 to 6 and 3 years off cashflow, which was pretty cool. Then I did 18 months of doing gym

[07:53] turnaround. So it's kind of like gym rescue or like bar rescue, but gym's but no gym owners want to

[07:57] get rescued. So I called it gym launch. Brilliant marketing right there. And this is actually the

[08:03] first ad I ever ran, which is actually me just doing a walk through of this gym in the hood.

[08:11] And I did a hundred and ninety one signups in 19 days. Just me selling 101 at 500 bucks each.

[08:17] I would show you, but I don't think we have enough time. But that ad, if you ever want to check it

[08:20] out at some of my YouTube channel, it's got like 400,000 views. It's 90 seconds. So anyways,

[08:26] from there, we package the IP for a better gym model because I had six gyms and then I did all these

[08:30] turn rounds. We scaled that to 2.4 million a month, which is a B2B business. Then we started a

[08:36] supplement company, scaled that to 1.7 million a month. That's B2B to C and B2C. For this, you don't

[08:42] know that means business to business and business consumer. Sorry, and business to business to consumer.

[08:47] And then after that, we founded a software company, which scaled to 1.6 million a month,

[08:51] which was B2B to C, which we actually just sold two months ago. And yeah, that was cool.

[08:59] And then we co-founded a national photography chain, which now 14 months later is doing 1.1 million a month.

[09:05] So, and now we have acquisition.com to take interest in 78 and multi-elearning and local chains,

[09:12] and we grow them to exit. So that's what we do. Which is cool for me, but what's in it for you?

[09:17] All right, so here's my goal for the presentation. To help you get you from where you are,

[09:21] using some of the lessons that are learned the hard way, and a few stories to make them stick

[09:25] to a level 7 zillion entrepreneur. Cool, which is an entrepreneur who contemplates the meaning of

[09:30] life because they have no need for money. Great. So, if someone has achieved success, and I'm going to

[09:38] use quotes here, faster, again, quotes here, than you, then they simply have been better

[09:44] allocators of a single resource. And it's probably not the resource you think. All right, so

[09:48] on a base my presentation is on a single premise, which is time allocation is the only thing that

[09:53] matters. If you master time, you will master material success, not single master happiness. I'm

[09:57] just saying you'll master material success. All right, and so don't worry, this is not a time

[10:02] management presentation. This is a presentation of how to drag your time horizon by the balls into

[10:07] the present. All right, way faster than everyone you desperately want to beat. I mean that,

[10:13] right? Like you can drag your time horizon to the present if you learn how to

[10:17] think differently. All right, so from the outside, what appears to be speed is not lots of activity

[10:24] that is a fallacy that most entrepreneurs believe. All right, it is making the right strategic decisions

[10:29] and making fewer mistakes. So, if you see where it says micro fast macro slow, for the most part,

[10:34] when I look at entrepreneurs and I see what they're doing, that's what their life looks like.

[10:38] They go really fast, and then they change directions. They go really fast, and they change directions.

[10:44] But I can tell you my neighbor who's right above me has been doing the same thing for 40 years.

[10:49] And it's micro slow, macro fast, and the speed comes from not having to take detours.

[10:55] If you consistently move forward over a long enough period of time, you go really far.

[11:01] And so here's a level seven observation for you. 90% of success can be boiled down to

[11:06] consistently doing the obvious thing for an uncommon long period of time without convincing yourself

[11:10] if you're smart of a new R. So, I like this quote from Neurol Ravicon. It's loose. I just remember

[11:18] from a book or something. I only believe that 1% of decisions matter. The rest of them are

[11:22] irrelevant. The difficulty is understanding which of the 1% of the 99% of the ones that matter.

[11:28] And so, what I want to give you is some of the frameworks that shape my 1% decision, so you can

[11:32] use them too. All right, so first off, this is the premise. Money is a denomination of time.

[11:38] Every transaction we make is for some percentage of our lives.

[11:43] Our wealth is a measure of how little of our lives will must trade for the things that we desire.

[11:48] Money is an IOU from society for future goods and services which is translated as other people's

[11:52] time for value that we provide. And so, to somebody who has lots of money, they need to trade

[11:58] very little time by percentage of their life to get the Lamborghini. For somebody who has no money,

[12:04] they have to trade a very large amount of time to get the same Lamborghini. It's just a store of time.

[12:11] And so, the key multiplier in time is leverage. And the size of the opportunities that we pursue,

[12:16] aka the strategic decisions are directly proportional to the amount of leverage that we can employ.

[12:22] Rich dads, and I think this is the biggest difference in economic quality.

[12:26] Tell their kids to pursue high-leverage opportunities, real estate, funds, acquisition,

[12:32] business ownership. That's what they encourage their kids to do because they already jump

[12:36] through the levels and they know what is there. Most people don't succeed because of ignorance,

[12:42] not because of lack of desire. Poor dads tell their kids to pursue low-leverage opportunities.

[12:48] Forcing those kids to have to learn the hard way like many of us did, what leverage actually is.

[12:54] Many times, never discovering what it is until it's too late. Example, get a good job,

[12:59] build a small business, and I'll clarify what that means. In a second, etc.

[13:04] So, this is a good book. You can probably get most of the take-kings

[13:08] just total side note. I think one of the most valuable things you can do is just read billionaire,

[13:11] autobiographies, because you get to see how they think. So, he said, this hit me like a ton of bricks.

[13:18] He said, it's harder to build a small business than a big business because level 10 town is only

[13:23] attracted to big opportunities. It's harder because you got to do it on your own. You got to do

[13:31] everything. If you chase the big things, it also makes it worth it because small goals and big

[13:39] goals are equally difficult. You have to expend time to achieve either of them. See,

[13:43] minus one making big. Really. Does that make sense? Does it like, that hits you because it hits me.

[13:50] So, with that being established, these are the four frameworks that I use to apply leverage

[13:54] and have given me the quote, faster than normal, quote, material success that many claim to desire.

[14:01] Number one, and I apply these frameworks when we're looking at investing in portfolio

[14:04] companies, when we look at ourselves and our own companies, what we're going to do to scale them.

[14:08] And so, these are the four things I look at. Number one, scale the entrepreneur.

[14:13] Number two, scale the market. Number three, scale the deliverable.

[14:20] Number four, scale the business. Now, from a equations standpoint, because this is how all these

[14:26] things work together, a level 10 entrepreneur on a level one opportunity will do pretty well,

[14:32] but not that great. Opportunity is a function of two of these things. The market times the

[14:38] scalability of the deliverable. If you've got a numb nuts on a level 10 opportunity, they'll still make

[14:45] money. Some of you guys know them. Some of you guys are them. And then finally, the business

[14:55] acumen is to understand how the actual enterprise itself has to scale. All right, so let's start

[14:59] with the first one. You are not making as much as you want because you are not as good as you think you

[15:05] are. Fact. If someone in your marketplace, derisite competitor is making more than you,

[15:13] it is because they are better than you at the game. Do not throw stones at them, throw stones

[15:18] at your ego instead. Admitted deficiencies and learn their strengths. It will be the only way to beat them.

[15:25] So, if we can admit the deficiency, then at least we can create space to learn. So, how do we get

[15:30] better? Look at the entrepreneurs, the first and more important thing that we do when we're looking

[15:34] to try and get into a business. And so, every business is bottlenecked by the entrepreneur in one of

[15:39] three ways. And so, if you're the entrepreneur, this is you. Number one, you'll either lack a skill.

[15:46] Number two, you will lack a character trait. Number three, you will lack a belief. So,

[15:53] imagine a ladder. And you can think of this as you've got traits, you've got beliefs and you've got

[15:57] skills. If any side of that ladder is missing, no matter how developed the other components,

[16:04] you will be limited to the lowest rung. This is the theory of constraints, right? Just visualized.

[16:12] So, fun activity. I will tell you the problem and you tell me whether it was a skill deficiency,

[16:18] a trait deficiency or a belief deficiency. A long time ago in a galaxy far away, I had 10 businesses.

[16:25] I also had no money. I had six gyms. I had a turnaround business, four gyms. I had a

[16:34] car-practor agency, I had a dental agency. I think that's a six plus yeah. Right, nine or ten.

[16:43] A lot, plenty. My lovely wife, Leila, who is not my wife at the time, said, uh, you need to pick

[16:51] something or you're gonna, you know, or I'm leaving. You know, it's like, oh man, that is a high stake.

[16:58] I should pick something. And so, uh, I ended up picking something. What do you think the issue was?

[17:06] What was my deficiency as an entrepreneur? Was it a skill? Gonna get hands for skill? Hands for trait?

[17:15] Hands for belief? Interesting. Okay. Well, this is my opinion. The lesson is niche-lapping

[17:21] fallacy, which is the fallacy that if I pursue all of them, one of them will work out, which is

[17:27] a fallacy. It is false. When in reality, all of them could have worked out, but none of them will

[17:33] work out if you pursue them all. And so many of you probably have your hand in two things.

[17:38] You're like, I'm not really sure which one it is. Fucking pick. Pick. Because people are competing

[17:47] against who are beating you, just have one thing. And imagine right now for a moment that one

[17:52] of those businesses disappeared, everything that you have on that business is vanishes. How easy

[17:59] would it be to make the other one win? So just do that. So the lesson was the niche-lapping fallacy,

[18:05] what I lacked was focus, and for me, I think focus is a character trait. So that was the trait

[18:12] deficiency. But I wasn't done yet. I still had more things that I was not successful because of.

[18:18] So this is me talking about my grand plans. This is at my first location, by the way. This is

[18:24] how I was showing how I wanted to build America's next gym. So I was really cute. And so

[18:30] anyways, I went to this mastermind. It was Russell Brunson's in her circle. This is five or six years

[18:34] ago. And I said, here are my grand plans. I've got six locations. I've got my next four picked out.

[18:41] And I told him about how our model worked and everything. And he said, I think it's a terrible idea.

[18:47] And like my heart sank. Because I was like, I looked up to this guy so much. I was like, God,

[18:51] I mean, I can just get one thing from this guy. And he said, Alex, you have a level 10 skill set

[18:58] in a level 2 opportunity. You shouldn't be running gyms. You should be teaching gyms what you do.

[19:04] And that's where it's like the big frameworks that change your life. And that's what I'm trying

[19:09] to do with this presentation for somebody in the room is that it's the big strategic decisions

[19:13] that make the big impacts in our lives. It's not the incremental gains. It's the rich daddy says,

[19:18] why are you even bothering with this? This is not big enough. You're never going to achieve

[19:23] scale running a liquor store. This is not going to happen, right? But you need someone like that

[19:28] from the outside to get that perspective. And so this was what I got from Russell years ago.

[19:34] And so can anyone identify the deficit that I was suffering at this point in my career?

[19:39] Was it a skill or a belief? Belief. And so this was actually my trajectory of me as a multi-gimonar.

[19:49] I had lots of skills. I had decent character traits, I think. But I didn't know that it was possible.

[19:56] I didn't know that that was something that you could do. And so I switched from being a multi-gimonar

[20:00] to a licenseor. And so finally, this would a skill deficiency looks like. And I'll give you one

[20:06] that I hear all the time in it and at marketing. I'm sure Ryan has heard this as well.

[20:09] No good salespeople exist. No one can sell. I got it and so my sales team is so inconsistent.

[20:16] Someone's they close a lot. Someone's they close a little. I want to kill them. And sometimes

[20:21] I don't want to kill them. Sound familiar? Anyone? This isn't a problem. It is a skill deficiency.

[20:30] You lack the skill of recruiting higher interviewing, training, and managing a high-performance sales

[20:35] team. It's all this. And so it's not that this does not exist. It's that I do not have the skills to conquer this problem.

[20:44] And so here's a pro tip where I thought, is binary's versus continuum. So if you might check the

[20:50] box and say, well, I know how to manage a sales team. The question is not whether or not you know how to

[20:55] manage a sales team, but how well you can manage a sales team. It's not a binary. It is a continuum.

[21:01] And as a fun thought, all of these things exist on a continuum. Your skills, your training,

[21:08] your training, your training, your training, your training, your training, it's not whether you're

[21:09] honest or not. It's how honest are you. So the best way to learn is to phrase your bottleneck or

[21:16] complaint into a solvable question. My sales team is inconsistent. How do I learn to create consistency

[21:21] in sales? Simple, right? And skill. I'm not going to get into how learn skills, but this is the

[21:27] quick, quick bit. It comes from repetition and feedback. AKA volume. The volume of work that you do,

[21:34] which is why I think we need to make active income cool again. All right. So I just looked at my CRM

[21:43] this years ago and I was able to pull the stats from my personal closing because you have to say

[21:49] who closed something in a CRM for gyms. And over a three and a half year period, I had closed

[21:57] 4,000 sales in the CRM. These are one-on-one sales. And so I often get the question, Alex, you seem

[22:04] so certain or you're so good at these things. How do I shortcut that? And the route is that most

[22:12] people don't have that rocky cutscene of eating shit and they're not willing to go through it.

[22:16] And maybe you are going through it right now. And so my promise to you is that your work works

[22:20] on you more than you work on it. You build your character through the work that we do. We increase

[22:26] our capacity to do work itself. And so if you can think about the work that you're doing is

[22:31] increasing that trait rather than the output of the work, then I think it will help a lot of people

[22:37] get through some of the harder times. It did for me. And so some of the things, some of the

[22:42] things that I have in my community are do the boring work and outwork yourself out. Because

[22:49] conviction doesn't come from positive affirmations in the mirror. It comes from having done something

[22:54] so many fucking times that you're bored of it. Because it's like, well obviously this is how you

[22:59] sell. Obviously this is how you scale a sales team because you've done it so many times. And I was

[23:04] on a podcast not that long ago for young male entrepreneurs. And the guy was like, hey, you know,

[23:09] I really hear what you're coming from. You know, I know you did hear all those years of

[23:12] reading shit that no one talked about. And so for all the audience that just wants to like

[23:16] shortcut all that, what's your advice? And I was like, you'll never beat me because you're not

[23:23] all in to do it. And so I think that the biggest deficiency that people have is their expectations.

[23:29] And so because we have these very lofty expectations, everyone's trying to become a millionaire

[23:32] in 90 days. When if I were to get you a to sign a contract, this is I promise you will be a

[23:37] millionaire in five years, but you won't earn anything for five years until you become a millionaire.

[23:41] Would you be willing to sign it? Most people say they would, but they don't live like they would.

[23:47] And I promise you that if you live like you would, you'll head it. But everyone just starts

[23:51] over every 90 days thinking that this is going to be the thing. When you could have just had that

[23:55] slow gradient that will get you there eventually. So I'd rather get rich for sure than get rich quick.

[24:01] And so the best part about all the stuff is that skills, trees, and beliefs all compound. And that is

[24:06] what yields crazy outsides return, seemingly overnight. And so this is actually one of my favorite parts

[24:12] of the presentation. Just side down. So let me give you an example of someone who's good at math.

[24:16] Let's see if anybody here good at math, born and good at math. Cool. So I wanted to make this into

[24:22] individual slides, so pretend each of these lines are not shown until I say them. Cool? Great.

[24:28] All right. So let's say you're good at math. All right. Cool. Not very monetizable. All right.

[24:34] Moving along. Let's say you're like, you know what? I'm going to start bookkeeping. I don't

[24:37] want to learn how to keep books. Like, okay, cool. Now you have something you can at least monetize.

[24:43] And they say, you know what I'm going to get accounting to gray. I'm going to learn how to do accounting.

[24:46] Okay. Now this is something that's really becoming a career. You can feed your family, et cetera.

[24:50] And then you say, you know what? I'm starting to get an attack strategy.

[24:53] Then all of a sudden you learn how you can you can help businesses avoid

[24:57] tax drag as my lawyer says. And then you learn into you learn about insurance because like,

[25:03] oh, this is cool too. And it has really cool ramifications also for tax, but also for some

[25:07] some investments stuff. Okay. That's cool. And then you learn how to negotiate deal structure.

[25:11] Ah, now we can you start seeing how the person changes as we're talking about adding these skills to

[25:17] the repertoire. First you're talking about a bookkeeper than an account, then maybe a controller.

[25:21] Now we're talking to CFO. And then you have an amazing mastery of capital markets.

[25:29] Now you're a rainmaker. And so the thing is, is that for this little example,

[25:34] it's one plus one plus one equals a zillion.

[25:39] Right? The point is that these skills stack on top of each other and create asymmetrical returns

[25:45] to all of these skills that came before it. And as a fun example, this was my actual skill stack.

[25:52] So first I learned how to get in shape and work out. Then I learned about nutrition, which was a

[25:57] whole another thing. Then I learned how to sell. So I started making a little bit of money.

[26:02] Then I learned how to, oops, market locally. So I started getting leads and I already knew how to sell.

[26:08] So then it was like boom, it was like a huge magnifier on the other three skills I had before that.

[26:13] Then I learned how to operate. So then I had to scale the six locations. And then I learned how to

[26:17] scale sales team. So I had six people selling it all those locations. And then I learned how to market

[26:23] B to B nationally. And because I already knew how to scale sales teams, I'd been doing it for years.

[26:28] I knew how to do high volume transactions. I knew how to operate a big business because I had

[26:33] 40 employees when I was 25. So I had all these other things. But as soon as I had that belief that I had a

[26:40] different vehicle that I could pursue it in, we went from zero to 28 million a year in 20 months.

[26:49] Pretty cool. And so as a different example, here's Jay Z's little skill stack.

[26:56] He learned how to, uh, man, see, if I, if I could have like revealed it later, it would have been fun air.

[27:03] But it's okay. So he had rhythm, right? In a natural skill or a procreability towards rhythm.

[27:10] All right. Then he learned how to write lyrics and rhymes, right? Then he learned how to sell.

[27:15] Got people, his CDs and get on stage, right? Then he learned how to promote himself.

[27:20] Then he learned how to create a label. And then he learned how to recruit other talent.

[27:26] And then he got Beyonce, right? And so the thing is, is this making sense?

[27:31] And so what might be valuable for you because I think I've just been through an

[27:35] introspective period is to think, what is my skill stack? And what are my deficiencies?

[27:42] And which of these deficiencies are keeping me from what I want?

[27:45] And why am I not working on them? Cool. So does every human here see how you can

[27:52] become an entrepreneur through higher leverage, through auditing and improving your skills,

[27:56] traits and beliefs? Yes? All right. Awesome. Check the box. So framework number two, scale the market.

[28:05] So, uh, I went to this match mind, all the people in this little picture actually do $600

[28:12] million a year in revenue, which is pretty cool. And I had this really interesting experience because

[28:16] I was one of the smaller guys in the room in terms of revenue at the time I think we're doing 35 or 40

[28:21] million somewhere in there. And I was like, why are these guys making more money than me?

[28:26] Because I was like, I don't think these guys are smarter than me. I was like, why? Why are they making more

[28:30] than me? And so I was left with one thing, right? And the answer was, they picked better markets.

[28:39] So when I looked at what all of these guys were doing, almost all of them were mass market,

[28:42] they were selling something that was expensive and they could target the world. And I was like,

[28:46] huh, they have better markets than me. And I was running up into this, this cap of my market right

[28:52] around 30 or 40 million. And so here's a quick little framework for you guys in terms of how to

[28:58] pick your market because many times I said that the equation here, right? Entrepreneur, level 10,

[29:03] times market, level 10, times delivery vehicle, child got to unit second, level 10, times business

[29:09] acting, and is what makes builds fortunes. All right. So the quick answer was, you have to select the

[29:13] avatar that you can provide the most value to. So now I'm going to question again, which, which

[29:17] avatar should I pursue? The one you can help the most. Simple. The media answer is picking avatar

[29:24] so that you can prioritize your service and provide that value with low operational drag. And that's

[29:30] why you pick one so that you can do the same thing over and over again and get better and better.

[29:33] And better at it so you don't have to spend as much resources to do the same level of value which

[29:36] is create margins, which is what you can take home and spend on Lamborghinis. Cool. So this is my

[29:43] life speech answer. If you had one thing to get with your hotdog stand, so I give everybody here a

[29:50] hotdog stand. And you have one competitive advantage. What would you want? Would you want the best

[29:57] location? Would you want the best ingredients? Would you want the best tasting hotdogs? Best marketing?

[30:04] Or would you want? Someone's right at the book. And this is actually a story of a marketing

[30:13] professor who says this is the beginning of every marketing thing. Of course. It said,

[30:18] what you want is a starving crowd. Because of my house shitter location is, if when the football

[30:23] game lets out and everyone is drunk, it's too cocky and afternoon and you're the only hotdogs

[30:28] stand there and you've got a starving crowd coming to you and you're gonna sell it to your hotdogs.

[30:32] They can be dog shit. You're gonna sell them. They probably won't even care. And so these are the

[30:38] four attributes that I look for in a market that I want to pursue. One is pain, right? They must not

[30:44] want but desperately need what I have to sell them. Number two, they must be able to afford

[30:51] what I want to sell them. A friend of mine had a business where he could help people and prove

[30:56] resumes to get more jobs. Problem. They didn't got no money, right? Couldn't afford his services.

[31:05] The third is tactical. Is he want him to be easy to target? Right? It's amazing if you want to find

[31:11] vegan, grandma's or whatever but if you can't tactically target them, it's one of those things that

[31:16] I would just cross out and be like, sounds hard. There's gonna be other hard things. I'd rather

[31:20] not add one to my list. And then finally growing, a good friend of mine had an ad platform

[31:27] that he sold to newspapers. And tries he might, it was growing and then his growth slowed and

[31:32] it started to shrink and he could not figure out what it was. He was like, I need new hooks and

[31:37] he offers and he couldn't figure out he's a smart dude. And I was like, hey Lloyd, you think

[31:42] that might be because you're selling the newspapers. Stringing 25% per year compounding.

[31:48] Right. It's just the big obvious thing. So if you're going to go into business, you might

[31:53] as we'll do something with the tailwind. If you got the choice, I just will pick something that's

[31:57] growing. Right? I know this stuff sounds simple but some of you guys are in drinking markets.

[32:02] Some like why? Rich dad poured that, right? Just make this smarter decision. So I'm going to

[32:08] skip through this stuff. I hit it most of it. And I'll just, I'll say this one little story that

[32:13] I like a lot. Warren Buffett talked about one of his, the smartest classmate in his closest friend

[32:19] from Columbia. And he said, this guy was brilliant, he was hard working, really high character

[32:25] dude. He's like, and I went to go build my partnership, the Berkshire pathway, well eventually we

[32:30] would become. And he went into the steel business. And he said, we did dramatically different even

[32:37] though we both had the same skills or in level of skill. And he said, and that's what taught

[32:41] me that it was far more important what boot you are in rather than how hard you row. And I think

[32:48] a lot of you guys are in robots and you need a bigger opportunity vehicle. And so the old

[32:55] VC saying is, great entrepreneur, poor market, market wins, poor entrepreneur, great market,

[33:02] market wins. That's why when people are looking at investing, they're like, what markets do I

[33:07] want to expose or to? Why don't I just ride the tailwind? So now once you selected a better

[33:14] market, you're going to want to scale, right? Right. So I'll skip the story, but short story.

[33:22] I had an agency under came up to me and he was like, Alex, I've scaled my agency, everything

[33:27] saturated, I can't get any more clients should I enter another market. Guys doing two million

[33:32] bucks a year is spending $50,000 a month on that. And I was like, you're right, carpractors are

[33:39] completely tapped out. The 10 billion a year that goes to carpractors and total revenue, your

[33:45] rinketing $2 million marketing agency has completely saturated. Whatever shall I do. Great question,

[33:52] friend. These are the five ways you can scale your market. So let's just use salon owners as an

[33:57] example. Let's say that's your avatar who you're going after. Whatever. So there's your ideal market.

[34:02] Wait number one, you can go up market. All right. So that would be going to multi location owners,

[34:06] chains, franchises, etc. Number two, you can go down market, go to hairstylist people who will

[34:12] eventually become your avatar in time. Number three, you can go to an adjacent market. So something

[34:18] that's very similar in terms of the core desires of the customers that you're serving. Right.

[34:22] So it might be Lashes and Nails. You can go broader, which just means going even wider. Right.

[34:28] Lashes Nails, Skidcrubs, Medspas, you know, Salons, Mousage, etc. Right. Or you can go deeper in your

[34:38] adjusting market, which if I had to tell you that is usually my favorite, which is by competitors

[34:44] and go figure out new platforms at outbound to your system, increase your ad budget. It's just

[34:49] doing more of the thing that you're already doing, which if you ever get anything common things for

[34:54] me is do the boring work. If something's working, do more of it. Usually works better. Great.

[35:02] So does everyone see how you can enter a better market and then scale it? Framework number two?

[35:08] Boom. Check it. All right. Number three, this framework that I'm about to share with you is the

[35:13] opportunity lens through which I look at all opportunities that I want to pursue. All right.

[35:17] It perfectly tracks my progression. This is actually pretty cool. So I got this, I borrowed part of

[35:22] this from the Val Ravicon, who's really brilliant. You can follow him on Twitter. But there's four

[35:28] C's to leverage. All right. I said the whole premise of this presentation is leverage. So

[35:33] entrepreneur, check that box, market, check that box. Now scaling the deliverable. So I'm looking

[35:39] at a company. I want to make the deliverable more scalable and increase the profit margin. Here's how

[35:43] you think about it. So the first level of leverage is labor. So back in the day, this is the

[35:48] only kind of leverage. That's how the pyramids were built. That's how ancient rural

[35:51] to you had. They just had bodies. Right? The problem with bodies nowadays is that you need permission

[35:56] to do things. Right? And so you have to ask people to do things or pay them to do things.

[36:01] Otherwise, they won't do them. It's such a bummer. Right? We'd make so much more money if we didn't

[36:05] have to do that. Second, our second level of leverage. And this is a higher level of leverage.

[36:11] This is capital. This is what the next generation of billionaires in fortunes were built off of,

[36:16] bough it, munger, et cetera. Once again, they used other people's money. So permission is required.

[36:20] Unfortunately, can't just take the money. But you can sell my lot of money, just leveraging capital.

[36:25] Right? And at this point in time, it was leveraging capital times labor.

[36:32] The third of this is code. The difference here is that this is permissionless. If you write software,

[36:38] you don't need to add permission to duplicate it. It just will continue to duplicate it over and over again.

[36:42] Right? I had no cost. To be looking at the Mailchimp founders. It was

[36:45] code that is what created their billions. And then finally, you've got content or media. Right?

[36:53] That's how Joe Rogan can sell his podcast for $100 million. What's his product? Media. It costs

[36:59] zero cost of replication. All right? I'm going to bring this home in a second. I promise you

[37:04] like where we're going. All right? And then you'll notice that above that top line, zero permission is

[37:09] required for either of those things. And that is where the new fortunes are being built. And right

[37:12] now, if you look at that pyramid and you're like, I'm not on that pyramid, you should get on that

[37:16] pyramid because that's where all the fortunes are. And if you look at the very top here,

[37:21] these are guys that use all four. Bezos, Zuck, Dorsey. They've got labor, working for them. They've got

[37:28] capital working for them. They've got code working for them and they have content and media working

[37:32] for them. All of them with permissionless leverage. Interesting? Cool. We call that a leverage for

[37:40] Bangor. It was funnier on the plane when I added that slide. So I was only able to see this trend

[37:47] after I had made these jumps. So my goal is by showing you this trajectory, you can do it proactively.

[37:52] So each opportunity jump that I'm about to show you 10x to my income. So at first, I was an

[37:58] employee. I was a management consultant. I was someone else's labor. I was making four figures a month.

[38:03] Then I became a trainer. I was my own labor. I'm my own master, right? So I became self-implaced.

[38:10] I jumped to five figures a month. Then I became a gym owner. And then I got finally used labor as

[38:17] leverage. I got to use other people's time. Right? And then I went to six figures a month.

[38:22] Then, and this is a big pivot, I went from leveraging labor to leveraging labor and media,

[38:32] which is a sort of licensing. Right? I started licensing something that has no cost to replicate.

[38:36] All right? And that's when we started making a million dollars a month. I'm talking income, not

[38:39] revenue here, by the way. Next level is eight figures a month. And this is where I think we're headed.

[38:45] We'll do about 85,000,000 in this year. We'll see how the quarter ends. And this is because now I

[38:50] added capital to this mix. Now I can buy things. Right? So it gives me more leverage to expand what I'm

[38:57] already doing. And so this is what I think will get me to eight figures a month. I'll let you know when I get there.

[39:02] And then finally nine figures a month is doing the whole stack. Right? Do I know what I'm going to

[39:06] do there? Not yet, but I got someers. Okay. So mind you, this is a framework. It's a tool.

[39:14] All models have limits, but it has served me well in thinking how to expand. Is that helping you?

[39:18] Sweet. So you guys want a really cool bonus framework that I've been thinking about for a long time.

[39:23] I have six minutes left, so you won't get it. Okay.

[39:26] I can go. All right. Well, pretend you never, uh, that's all right? Okay.

[39:37] So, uh, cool. You said yes to this. Fantastic. Okay. So this is low leverage. This actually took me like,

[39:43] you know, these little things take like, it's five minutes each to little little lines of shit.

[39:46] Anyways. Uh, so here's framework number three, scaling the level of all. So this is delivery

[39:52] to you. So when I look at a business that I'm looking to buy into or improve, et cetera,

[39:57] these are six different types of questions that I ask, which is number one,

[40:01] can I do this thing in a 101 setting, a small group setting, or a one to many setting?

[40:05] And can I change the price accordingly? Number two, is this a do it yourself?

[40:11] A done with you, or a done for you solution? Can I move along that spectrum at either direction

[40:17] in a way that might optimize my outcome for better profits? Number three,

[40:21] well, level of support going off. This is a little bit more service space, but hopefully it'll

[40:25] helps on me. Um, do I want to do tech support? Do I want to do chat support? Do I want to do email

[40:31] support? Do I want to do phone support? Do I want to do zoom call support? What type of support do I

[40:34] want to provide? Do I want to probably different levels at different income levels or different

[40:39] payment levels? Something to consider. Consumption for if I'm licensing material, do I want to be

[40:45] written? Do I want it to be live like this? Do I want it to be audio only? Do I want it to be video?

[40:49] How am I going to package the information? Number five, speeding convenience. If someone has

[40:55] helped for me, is it 24-7? Is it 95? Do they have a response time of under a minute? Do they

[41:03] have a response time of two days? Right? These are all variables that you can use to increase or decrease

[41:09] the value or margin that you are using to deliver. And then finally, this is probably my favorite

[41:16] of the six boxes if you can have a favorite on a framework about delivery. Um, one is, I want

[41:23] you to imagine the value that you provide right now in the price you charge for it. Okay? Now,

[41:30] I want you to 10x that price. Now, I want you to think about what you would deliver if that were

[41:35] actually your price. How much more would you do? Interesting thought process. Blue sky,

[41:45] do it on your own time, but it's a good thought experiment you should do with your team. Number two,

[41:50] think again about your current product. If you had to deliver a more value than you currently are,

[41:57] but for one tenth of the price, what house would you need to build that would cost nothing to replicate

[42:05] to provide the value? And number three, if I could have a favorite question of my last framework

[42:13] of number box six, this would be it. If right now the gods of marketing, Ryan Dice gives the

[42:20] god voice and says you can no longer get new customers from marketing. And the only thing you have

[42:26] for your existing customers and the only way to get a new customer is for those customers to bring

[42:32] them to you. How different would your client experience look? Food to think on. The thing is,

[42:42] the people think that word of mouth is dead. That book right now, if you just do the math,

[42:48] it sounds like $250,000 a month of book, soft afford of mouth and no funnels.

[42:54] People can spread stuff fast at the never before. We're just not taking advantage of it because we're

[42:59] too greedy and too short term thinking. They get people aren't referring your stuff, fix the stuff,

[43:04] buy by bothering it. People don't want to talk about it. I don't know. Time check for myself.

[43:10] Apparently I'm on time. Everything is for sale. This is another quick framework. I'll give you

[43:17] for scaling delivery. I have a ton of these. These are just two that I wanted to bring up.

[43:20] So these are the only things you can ever sell. I've been trying to think through what are the

[43:24] base chunks, base units of shit you sell. You got products, you got services, you got access,

[43:30] you have media, you have risk and you have money. Only things you can sell. I challenge you to think

[43:36] of something else. If you do figure one out, that doesn't include these as base chunks, I'll add it.

[43:40] All right, because I've been thinking a lot about this. What's even cooler about this is that each

[43:44] of these components have physical and digital pieces. A physical product would be a bag of

[43:50] dog buns. A digital product is what a lot of you guys sell. Like a course. A physical service

[43:58] would be like a massage. A digital service might be marketing. Physical access would be access

[44:04] to this event or to a real estate building that you rent every day so that you can have shelter

[44:11] digital access. It might be if there was a virtual recording of this live. Digital access.

[44:17] You have physical media like a billboard, digital media. You got you know what that is, you're here.

[44:23] You've got physical risk like you're building is being insured and you've got digital risk,

[44:27] like a cyber attack. And then you've got physical money and everybody knows about cryptocurrency.

[44:33] This is kind of cool. The different things you can sell. So here's the challenge.

[44:36] Can you think through how you can add one of these other components to your existing offer stack

[44:42] without providing a lot of operational drag but while also providing value.

[44:45] All right, and so I got a couple. I presented this to a couple a smaller group.

[44:51] And they were like, what about experiences? I was like experiences or products or service

[44:54] or success. A business is all of those things chunk together.

[45:00] Titles like if I wanted to make you a knight, what do you get? You get access.

[45:05] If I wanted to give you IP that is access to products.

[45:10] So when you're thinking through this like those are the based chunks that build everything.

[45:13] And so I think sometimes when we can just boil it down to what are the based units,

[45:16] it can be useful in thinking what else can I sell or what can I transform my existing things into that are more valuable.

[45:22] And so here's an easy thought. This is one of the more genius things that we did is that

[45:28] if you're not anybody here in ad agency?

[45:30] A couple people. Well, I'll tell you what we did is that we had the agency side and they were like, huh?

[45:38] What if we just find the winners and then license the winners every single month to everybody else who wants to run their own ads?

[45:48] All margin. Great idea.

[45:51] Made us an extra million a month in profit. You should try it. Good recommend.

[45:56] Number two, add an experience to continuity, right? Or add physical products to digital experiences.

[46:06] These are all different ways you can mix and match these things. Time to return. Fantastic.

[46:10] Does everyone see how you can add leverage to your deliverable from those two frameworks that shared?

[46:13] Yes? Say yes. Awesome. All right. Check the box. Number four. Scale the business.

[46:20] So you covered a lot today and we feel like this? A little bit? All right. Fantastic.

[46:24] So I'll wrap this up by showing you what we can focus on in each revenue level,

[46:28] in that what we focus on in each revenue level for our portfolio businesses when we come to scale them.

[46:33] All right. So these are my last five years of revenue from 2017 till now. All right.

[46:40] If you notice, that's what being stuck looks like. I didn't know what to do.

[46:45] And so anybody want to know what happened there? Yes? Cool. I read this book.

[46:51] Which I recommend to good book. But there was one chapter in it that completely made everything click for me.

[46:56] And so I applied that book because up to that point I intimately understood what it took to get to 3540-ish

[47:02] million, but I didn't know how to get past it. Now I do. That's what I'm going to share with you. All right.

[47:07] So who here is zero to a million? Can we leave you goes at the door? Okay. Cool.

[47:13] One product, one avatar, one channel.

[47:16] If you have multiple businesses in your under seven figures a year, stop.

[47:23] More businesses clearly aren't making you more money.

[47:28] One product, one avatar, one channel. But I thought I should have multiple acquisition channels.

[47:33] You don't even fucking make money yet. So no, one product, one that avatar, one channel.

[47:38] The problem that you're trying to solve here is that you have no fucking clue what you're doing.

[47:42] The objective is consistently sell something to people who actually want. That's the objective.

[47:47] That is why we talked about picking the right market first.

[47:51] One to 10 million. The objective is to increase the lifetime gross profit per customer. I don't like

[47:56] saying lifetime value because no one knows what it means and it's revenue for the most part. I like to

[48:01] think about what is my gross margin on the things that I'm selling. The problem is that most times when

[48:06] you're at that million-ish, you're not making enough money, take home. And so the problem is that you're

[48:10] not making enough profit per customer to scale, which is what is required to go from one million to 10 million.

[48:15] And so the objective is to add higher leverage deliverables so that you can make more money.

[48:19] Hence why we went over the deliverables. Makes sense? Awesome. 10 to 50 million.

[48:26] What happens here is that your consistency of delivery starts to drop. And so what you need to do is

[48:30] you actually have to start professionalizing the business. This is where you actually pay taxes.

[48:33] And don't go to jail and pay payroll and all that kind of stuff. And the problem is that if

[48:38] inconsistent delivery, you have poor tracking, your share and issues are fucked and your finances are

[48:42] a mess. The solution is you have to hire a high-level experience you've already done this before.

[48:46] All right? So that is where framework number four is. This is scaling the business. This is actual

[48:52] business acumen. And then finally, framework X and framework one is a live this entire time

[48:59] because you have to become the entrepreneur that is required at each level. Sometimes your best is not good enough

[49:06] because what is required is more than your current best. And so I think rather than thinking like I'm

[49:10] trying my best, it's like well it's clearly not working. So why don't we just try fixing the problem

[49:16] and ignoring your feelings. So framework X, a track talent. All right? And this is the piece that I was

[49:22] missing is that what happens is you have to grow revenue streams. Innovation dies at this level of

[49:27] business because one entrepreneur can only do so much. Right? And so you need other stallions to

[49:32] come in who can drive revenue. All right? And so at this point the business actually becomes a

[49:36] conglomeration of many businesses. So think about it having 10 CEOs that all run their own P&Ls

[49:42] that are actually growing their own many businesses within the larger context of yours. If you think

[49:46] about Amazon, Amazon isn't one business. It's a zillion businesses club together. So as you scale,

[49:51] it becomes more lobbying things together, becomes more acquisition, et cetera. As a result of this.

[49:57] All right? So here's the solution. You have to get an account and set of ice to drive growth.

[50:01] So I'm going to skip this story. You guys want to hear a cool mental model. Alex Scharffins right here.

[50:07] So there's six external, this is the function is how I define it. Any of five. So one is lead gen,

[50:15] two lead nurture, three sales, four customer success, five ascension, six resell. All right?

[50:23] These are the things that all of you probably know how to do. Hopefully. Right?

[50:28] This is how you scale. These are the six internal business functions that mirror the external.

[50:34] Everybody knows their CPCs, their CPMs, what percentage click through rate? They're speed to response,

[50:39] hopefully. One percentage close rate you guys have. But I'll bet you if I asked you how many

[50:44] applications you get a month. What percentage of those applications do you get to book a call?

[50:48] What percentage of interviews are you transitioning into a full-time role? What is your onboarding

[50:54] look like for a new employee? What is that training look like? How do we ascend those people?

[50:59] What is their career path? Is it clearly defined for them with role, the title and pay?

[51:03] And then finally, what's our retention on this? And I'll tell you the quick story for why this is

[51:09] important. So I had a team of, right now we have a big call called team. We have 26 guys.

[51:17] And the lowest wrong on that is Cole Calling. So they call people who don't know. And so for those

[51:21] you were like our sales team sucks. Like track calling people who don't even know who you are

[51:25] and then get them to buy a 40,000 dollar thing. So our sales team is pretty good. So we had this goal

[51:32] for two quarters. My sales director said we're going to add another 10 BDRs. And I said,

[51:37] great goal. Two quarters later, we haven't added 10 BDRs. So third quarter and around, I was like what's

[51:43] your goal? He's like I'm going to add 10 BDRs. And I was like, I feel like we've done this before.

[51:47] So why haven't you added the 10 BDRs? And because this is where we're like, okay, this many

[51:54] calls equals this much sales, blah, blah, blah, blah, right? Everyone's done this. What do you think

[52:00] about on that? And I was like wait a second, how many people are you interviewing a week?

[52:05] Five from HR. And I was like, well, five's not going to get us there. Because that was just replacing

[52:12] the turn of the front line position. And just like you have turning customers, you have turning

[52:15] employees, especially at the front line. And so when we discovered that the actual

[52:19] limiting factor was HR, not running enough ads to get enough interviews and changing the actual

[52:24] process, we had 10 hard in two weeks and took us three quarters to get there. And so two weeks later,

[52:32] now we have double the applications that are coming in for our business. And I'll bet you that all

[52:36] of you have one of these things, you're one amazing hire away from all the growth you ever wanted.

[52:41] You just got identified that that's actually probably most of your bottleneck.

[52:45] Especially as you scale. Cool. So, does everyone have a clear idea what they need to

[52:50] focus on to scale their business at their current level? Yes? Checkbox number four. Awesome.

[52:55] So, did everyone get something they can take away, hopefully, and drag their future by the

[52:58] balls towards the present? If you enjoyed this stuff, you can get more frameworks like this for

[00:00] What's going on in Mozi Nation? You're here with Alex from Mozi YouTube's richest

[00:05] YouTuber or a richest YouTuber to be

[00:08] I'm kidding for those of you guys who don't know me my name is Alex from Mozi

[00:11] Weodeckposition.com. We do about $85 million a year

[00:14] I got a question either day that was five things that millionaires think about

[00:17] that poor people don't and I wanted to change that to billionaires

[00:20] And that is because a lot of millionaires have terrible beliefs and you know I tend to agree with the

[00:24] Grand Cardone on this one which is

[00:26] Don't listen to millionaires listen to billionaires so you can choose to listen to me or not

[00:29] I hope that we will be billionaires in the next 10 to 15 years

[00:33] But we still have lots of work to go and hopefully the world doesn't melt down between now and then

[00:37] All right, so these are the five things that billionaires think about the millionaires do not think about

[00:41] Number one is the size of the opportunity a lot of times millionaires were pursued

[00:46] What most billionaires would consider small fries or small chips table stakes things that are just not that interesting

[00:53] Because there's just not a huge amount of growth potential now when you're getting started

[00:57] It's not stupid to niche down many of the biggest businesses in the world started with a niche

[01:01] But they had the ability or possibility to build something that was going to be truly enormous and so the total adjuster of market or the potential scale

[01:09] Of a business itself is something that a billionaires were think about the millionaire will not the second thing that millionaires

[01:14] Do not think about or mistakenly prioritize is they prioritize promotion over product the biggest question

[01:21] That a billion-year-old ask about a company is

[01:25] Will people continue to buy this product over and over and over again and stay to differently?

[01:31] Is this something that people will never stop buying if people will never stop buying this thing?

[01:35] Then it will be inevitable that we will make money

[01:38] All right that is how they are thinking most millionaires on the other hand just learn promotion and because that is how they made their first money

[01:44] Because they didn't make any money and then they start learning how to promote they make some money

[01:48] They assume that I should just do more promotion and with the exception of very big mass market brands that are direct to consumer and

[01:55] Have big ticket items, you know for example solar would be one where you know promotions going to matter a lot

[01:59] Because you really are going to only sense sell someone one time on this for 30 years

[02:02] So promotions can matter more in that sense situation

[02:05] But most businesses have a recurring nature of some sort right and so

[02:09] Making sure that the product is good enough that when we put the promotion behind it people do not stop purchasing it so that we can get

[02:13] Outside of returns on our marketing and our business model overall is something that billionaires with thing about and not

[02:18] Niners the third thing that millionaires with will will will mistake here is they will make the mistake

[02:26] Of thinking I can do this myself or I'll just underpay just a handful of people to to to run this with me

[02:32] So they will have what we call the genius with the thousand slaves model versus army of

[02:38] smarter people so the second criteria that I heard Stephen Schwarzenin who's the

[02:43] owner of or not owner of the founder of blackstone he's worth about 30 billion dollars talk about was that first

[02:48] She looks at the size of the opportunity and the second thing that he looks at is

[02:52] drum roll

[02:53] Can I find 10 out of 10s who want to pursue this opportunity and so here's the interesting thing big talent

[03:00] Only chases big opportunity and the reason and he says this quote and he hit me really hard

[03:05] He said we didn't say this to exactly but I'm paraphrasing

[03:09] He said it's harder to start a small business than it is to start blackstone

[03:13] Because big talent doesn't want to go pursue a small business opportunity

[03:18] Think about that for a second that one totally shook me to my core right is that the reason we have to have these big goals

[03:24] It's not just for ourselves to get through the muck of of wanting more and going and suffering through the

[03:30] Transantrubulations that come with entrepreneurship

[03:32] But also so that everyone around us can stomach it because they believe in where we are going into

[03:36] It is something that is true in its vision that is compelling and the opportunity and also the compensation that they can make

[03:43] If you're running a dry cleaning store, it's very difficult to attract 10 out of 10 talent there and I define 10 out of its

[03:49] And talent as people who are the best in the world of the thing right nine at its

[03:53] And talent is the best people in the world that I can attract given my company right and eight is somebody who is very very good at the thing

[04:01] And takes initiative and can yield outside his returns a seven is someone who is functional

[04:05] But has to take direction to execute right and a six and below you don't want them in your business anyways

[04:11] And the vast majority businesses are run by six is in below

[04:14] Let's be real if you're looking at your team most the team is probably not best in the world or best in the world that you can get

[04:19] Right of course not and that is probably because the size of the opportunity that you're chasing is not that good

[04:25] Number four is time horizons most millionaires and people who don't make a lot of money

[04:30] Think in very short time increments. They think in this week and this month

[04:33] They're thinking can I make payroll can I make rent and I understand that but the reason that the people gain outside's returns

[04:39] Who are wealthier is because they see time as an asset rather than a liability

[04:43] They see time working for them rather than against them. They see the opportunity compounding in and of itself

[04:48] Because they have time on their side and so the smart person the billionaire look at the opportunity say

[04:53] Does time help me or hinder me in this opportunity because I have this little quote that I like a lot

[04:58] I prefer to play games where if you wait you win I'll say it again

[05:02] I prefer to play games where if you wait you win

[05:06] We're success is an inevitable consequence of time you may not know when but you do know whether

[05:12] You will get there. I'd rather get rich for sure and get rich slowly

[05:16] Then never get rich at all always hoping that I'll make it in the next 90 days

[05:20] Which is what the vast majority of millionaires think they're only thinking about their next promotion

[05:24] They're only thinking about their next campaign. They're only thinking about the next thing they're going to do rather than thinking big picture

[05:29] If I do this for the next 10 years

[05:31] What is going to position me for where I want to be and ultimately opportunity that I want to pursue and

[05:36] five the last thing that

[05:39] Billionaires will prioritize over millionaires is brand and this is something that I didn't understand really early on

[05:44] I thought brand was a waste of money and thought branding was stupid

[05:47] But a different way of saying brand is reputation right and I heard a

[05:51] I'm in that I that I do business with frequently say this and I really like this a lot

[05:55] He said you only get one name

[05:58] You only get one and

[06:00] I it really it really struck me because I just thought that was such a such a consolidated way of communicating the point

[06:05] We only get one name and the thing is is that your brand compounds with time the more

[06:11] Decisions you make that are integrists that are aligned that are not short-term and thinking that are not sacrificing

[06:16] Your integrity to get the short dollar which is candidly what most people do most people do that right

[06:23] And that's why most people have a so-so or poor brand right?

[06:26] Like yeah, he's pretty good, but you know, he kind of does some stuff everyone's a lot of little shame, right?

[06:29] But if you have an impeccable brand the other types of people that you will track will be people who have impeccable brands

[06:36] And I can tell you this is that the the area on the top of the mountain is very very

[06:40] Sparsely populated

[06:42] They're not a lot of people the top and they all know each other. It's crazy and you know why it's because they seek out

[06:47] People who see the world the same way they see the world and it's an exception to the rule rather than the vast majority

[06:53] And so if you want to have game recognized game if you want those people to sit across the table and look at you as

[07:00] an equal

[07:01] Then it starts with the character of the person and if the characters right billionaire will bet on the character of the individual

[07:07] Knowing that they will get to where they're trying to go eventually in enough time because it is an

[07:12] inevitability provided the values continue and so when you're making the business decisions

[07:17] Taking the long route that takes longer, but will most certainly compound and make you wealthier in the long run is

[07:24] What billionaires will do rather than millionaires all right and so I wanted to make this about billionaires rather than millionaires

[07:28] Because candidly if you just know how to run some ads

[07:31] You can be a millionaire, right you can learn how to promote and sell stuff the stuff you might sell my suck

[07:35] But you might make enough money to be a billionaire, but to be a billionaire

[07:40] You got to play the game for a long time

[07:42] Which means you have to understand that you must play the game for a long time in order to become a billionaire

[07:47] And if you're playing the game for a long time to be a billionaire

[07:50] Then all your decisions are gonna be made within that time horizon and the context that that come with that the decision making process

[07:57] And so if we're thinking about this if there's one thing

[08:00] That you can take away from this that billionaires would think about the millionaires do not is

[08:05] Understanding the time horizon right because all of these other components roll into that right

[08:12] If we have a long time horizon we're doing this forever

[08:14] I don't want to be the one who's doing it all so I don't want to be the genius with the thousand slaves

[08:17] I want an army of smarter people who are gonna do this. Oh my behalf

[08:20] I want 10 out of 10s who are pursuing this opportunity and can grow it without me right if I want this to truly be

[08:27] Something that is going to change my life

[08:29] I can't pursue a small thing for my entire life. I got to pursue something big because it has to be worth it

[08:33] Because and I've heard this from Schwartzman and I love it too

[08:36] He said small goals and big goals are equally hard

[08:38] See minus will make it worth it right?

[08:40] It's just as hard to accomplish making a hundred thousand dollars a year

[08:43] It is as it is for somebody to make a billion dollars a year think about it the time requirement is the same

[08:49] Arguably it's less to make a billion dollars here

[08:51] You just have to think differently about it if I'm gonna be around for a very long time

[08:54] I'm going to outlive my promotion and so only thing that we remain will be the product and what people talk about with the product and the decisions that I chose to make with my brand

[09:03] Because I was thinking long term

[09:05] And so everything comes down to this concept which is can you think beyond this week this month this quarter and think when I look back 80 years from now

[09:15] Are the decisions that I'm making right now the ones that I would be proud of that are aligned with the long term goal of

[09:21] Seizing the big opportunity that is worth fighting for and so this is what I have I have learned in gleam from the the handful of billionaires that I talk to and I

[09:29] Costantly am trying to analyze them and think what do they have that I don't and maybe is that I'm just too young

[09:33] And I just need to keep doing what I'm doing which is oftentimes the response that I get and so anyways

[09:38] Most ination the reason I make this channel is is because there's a lot of people not on which to be one of them

[09:43] These are the traits that billionaires will will look through the lenses off rather than millionaires should often make short-term short-sighted mistakes

[09:51] In pursuing

[09:53] Their goals and so I don't want you to do those so anyways

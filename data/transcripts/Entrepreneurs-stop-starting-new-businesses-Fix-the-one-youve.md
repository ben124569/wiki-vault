[00:00] I did business owner reach out yesterday who's doing about $550,000 a month and they were

[00:04] crying for us to become an acquisition, not a comfortable company.

[00:08] The conversation was really interesting and so I thought I would share it with you.

[00:12] We hopped on the call within the first minute or two after saying, hey, how's it going?

[00:16] It's like, yeah, I had a bunch of clinics and then COVID hit, we took everything to

[00:23] telehealth and then our profit exploded and it's been awesome.

[00:26] I was like, well, that's great.

[00:27] And he's like, so what I'm thinking about doing is helping a new business to help

[00:34] physicians improve their medical practices.

[00:38] And I was just like, huh, he was like, yeah, because you did this thing with Jim owners and

[00:43] you kind of licensed your model out.

[00:44] I kind of wanted to do the same thing with physicians.

[00:48] And I sat there and I was like, this is going to be a really interesting conversation.

[00:52] And so after him going, you know, giving his reasoning behind this, I was like, well,

[00:56] I have no interest in that business at all.

[01:01] And I was like, let me tell you why.

[01:02] I was like, first off, you want to answer a established marketplace that is incredibly saturated.

[01:08] The value proposition that you have is not based on like a ton of personal experience,

[01:13] right?

[01:14] You have a handful of examples.

[01:15] It's also not that unique.

[01:16] There's plenty of other people who do the same thing.

[01:19] And so you want to enter a space you've never been in before.

[01:21] Have a new acquisition system, a value proposition that's not to find.

[01:24] It's incredibly saturated.

[01:25] And there's nothing new.

[01:27] And I was like, I have no interest in this business.

[01:30] And he was like, huh, and I was like, but what I am interested in is why don't you want

[01:35] to take the thing that's making you $550,000 a month that you grew in two years and just

[01:39] take that to $5 million a month.

[01:41] Why aren't you doing that?

[01:43] And so he was like, well, honestly, I kind of got stuck.

[01:46] I didn't know how to grow it from here.

[01:50] And so it was such a nice point because there was a pause.

[01:53] And you could almost hear him saying it to himself and hearing him say it out loud.

[01:57] I was like, let me ask you this.

[01:59] If we could go from $550,000 to tripling your amount of customers you haven't got

[02:04] a 1.5 million a month, I was like, would you still be interested in doing this whole medical

[02:08] thing?

[02:09] This other thing that you were telling me about earlier would try to teach physicians.

[02:12] And he was like, oh, no, of course not.

[02:13] I would just want to do this thing.

[02:15] And I was like, okay, so to be clear, let me restate this because you got stuck in this

[02:20] existing business, you thought the solution would be, I will start another business.

[02:25] Huh, not a good deductive reasoning pattern, right?

[02:30] And this is obviously a very smart individual, right?

[02:33] And I say this because all of us, right, I do this.

[02:37] I do this all the time, right?

[02:39] And this is going to be repeated theme because it needs to be repeated, right?

[02:41] We need to be reminded more than we need to be taught.

[02:43] That is a saying that we have in my world and I will pass it on to you guys'

[02:47] designation.

[02:48] We need to be reminded more than we need to be taught.

[02:49] Do the boring work, repeat successful actions.

[02:51] And so if he's gotten to this point or if you've gotten to a point in your business

[02:55] and it has plateaued, the question is, has it plateaued because this is true, like, I have

[03:01] the only reason a business should plateau that is reasonable, that is not your fault, is that

[03:06] you have reached the total addressable market as in you have saturated the total market

[03:11] of that thing.

[03:12] So for example, if you were selling dog food and every dog within this, you know, maybe

[03:19] you saw a specific type of niche of poodle food, right?

[03:22] You've gotten, you know, 70% of poodle owners to buy your food and you can't grow any more

[03:27] beyond that, right?

[03:28] Well, that would be reasonable, but then you'd obviously just do a different type of dog,

[03:32] right?

[03:33] You'd hot verticals, right?

[03:34] So there's not even a reason, but it would be the only potentially rational reason

[03:39] that would be that your market has changed.

[03:42] So a different example is the front of mind owned a company that does newspaper advertising,

[03:46] right?

[03:47] So they actually help newspapers translate their advertisements into digital products,

[03:51] which is pretty cool.

[03:52] So they are able to sell, like basically a whole new ad product to small businesses who

[03:57] want to buy ads, right?

[03:58] Which is, by the way, how newspapers make money.

[04:00] Key could not grow his business because newspapers have shrunk by 25% year over year,

[04:04] which is 25% compounding the wrong direction.

[04:06] And he's been in that business for like 10 years.

[04:08] And now the market size is like literally like 5% of what he used to be 10 years ago.

[04:12] And so as a result of that, he was growing at a inverse rate to the shrinkage of the industry,

[04:17] right?

[04:17] And so he got to a point where he couldn't grow any more than just basically servicing

[04:21] the ones that are so alive and then as they fell, so did his business, right?

[04:26] And so that is the only logical reason that a business can apply to that is not in your

[04:30] control.

[04:31] And unless you're selling your newspapers, which you're probably not, the reason is much

[04:35] simpler, which is you just don't know how.

[04:37] And I'll tell you a different story that I had and then I'll wrap this up at the end.

[04:41] So I was having a different conversation with a woman who is doing, I think, $4 million

[04:45] a year.

[04:46] And she was selling info products that were weight loss, like weight loss, insofo products,

[04:51] so like programs and e-books and things like that.

[04:54] Which is cool, right?

[04:55] She's a big following, all the kind of stuff.

[04:57] And I did a podcast with her and after we got off the podcast, she was like, yeah,

[05:02] so these are my plans.

[05:03] I'm going to be doing like an apparel line and subwoman line and cream line and whatever,

[05:09] right?

[05:10] And I just kind of sat there and was like, well, I think it's a terrible idea.

[05:14] She was like, she just looked at me across there and she was like, what?

[05:16] And I was like, yeah, I think it's a terrible idea.

[05:18] She was like, oh, and I was like, why don't you just take the thing that's making you $4

[05:21] million dollars and make it make you $10 million dollars?

[05:24] Why don't you do that?

[05:27] And the answer is the same as the first answer.

[05:29] I just don't know how.

[05:30] And I was like, right, well, why don't we solve that problem?

[05:32] And then not create a new business.

[05:36] Why don't we just put all of our effort in solving that problem?

[05:39] And so I'm a big believer, and this is the piece that I want to share with you,

[05:42] most of the nation, is that I'm a big believer in the theory of constraints, which means

[05:45] that a system will grow until it is constrained, right?

[05:48] It has a constraint and then when you remove the constraint, it will continue to grow,

[05:50] right until it reaches another constraint.

[05:52] And so most people are always curious, or many people ask me, hey, Alex, how did you

[05:57] achieve quote so much in quote such a little time or at such a young age?

[06:01] And I say all that in quotes because so much could be and young age, whatever.

[06:04] But I'm saying, I'm just imperferencing, right?

[06:07] And I think that one of the things that we have done well is prioritizing what problems

[06:13] to solve.

[06:15] And that is understanding the prioritization of problems.

[06:19] And realizing that there is really only typically one or two things that are constraining

[06:25] our growth.

[06:26] And by definition, there'd really only be one thing that's the constraint until we reach

[06:29] another thing that might be beginning to constraint us, but isn't the true constraint yet.

[06:33] I'll tell you a third story.

[06:34] So I had a conversation with a young business owner who is doing about 150,000 more

[06:39] months.

[06:40] Within a little bit of time, I was able to see that the issue that he had was that he

[06:44] hadn't scaled a sales team, right?

[06:45] That was the issues that he couldn't scale sales.

[06:48] And we had, there was a zillion things that he could do to improve his business.

[06:52] He could increase his life somewhere of property, he could change his pricing model.

[06:54] I think there were some things on his messaging that were off.

[06:57] At the end of the day, the thing that he hadn't done was that he hadn't scaled a sales

[07:01] team.

[07:02] And so we ended up circling back two weeks later and he was like, hey, I want to know how

[07:07] I can get the most out of this phone call with you.

[07:10] I was like, well, have you scaled a sales team?

[07:12] He was like, no, we don't really have anything to talk about.

[07:15] Because there's nothing else that matters right now besides this.

[07:18] And it took like two or three reinforcements of that message until he was like, you're really

[07:22] not going to tell anything else.

[07:23] I was like, no, because it doesn't matter.

[07:25] It doesn't matter.

[07:26] That's not the constraint right now.

[07:27] Sure, you could improve your pricing.

[07:28] Sure, you could do these other things.

[07:30] But the thing that is stopping this business from growing is that you do not have a scaled

[07:35] sales team.

[07:36] And you don't have that skill.

[07:37] So let's phrase the deficiency as a question, which is, how do I learn how to recruit

[07:43] manage and train a sales team?

[07:46] And to the first business owner, the question that I said to the who's doing the 550

[07:49] a month who's doing the clinics, it's like the question is, how do I scale acquisition?

[07:54] And he had a product that was not allowed to be marketed on Facebook and things like that.

[08:01] So he had to do alternative methods.

[08:02] And I was like, so the question is, how do I acquire more customers than I already am from

[08:06] a different channel that I'm allowed to?

[08:09] When we phrase the questions like that, then they become problems that we can solve.

[08:13] Rather than, I don't know what to do.

[08:15] Therefore, I will just start another business, which so many times is the entrepreneurial

[08:19] solution.

[08:20] And it's because it feels good.

[08:22] And we think that somehow when we start another business, it's going to somehow grow.

[08:26] But the reality is, and this is what I have found over and over again, is that the businesses

[08:29] will grow to the level of incompetence of the entrepreneur.

[08:33] So if you're a $4 million entrepreneur, the next business will be a $4 million dollar business,

[08:36] no matter what it is.

[08:38] Because that is your level, that is your skill set.

[08:40] That is dictated or predicated by your beliefs, your traits, and your skills.

[08:45] And unless you change one of those things when you start the next business, you will

[08:49] be capped at that.

[08:50] And the other reality is that how many CEOs of public-intradiated companies do you know

[08:54] that are sees two companies?

[08:56] CEOs, not founders.

[08:58] Elon Musk is the only exception, but he's the founder.

[09:00] He's not the one who's the one who's the one who's the operating's not the operator of those

[09:02] companies.

[09:03] It's literally only one.

[09:04] And he's also a genius and literally like the smartest human being alive.

[09:09] But most of us are not Elon Musk.

[09:11] If we're on YouTube right now, we're probably both not Elon Musk.

[09:14] Maybe we're going to agree on that.

[09:15] And so the point of this is that you can't be CEO of two things.

[09:19] It's hard enough to be in one business.

[09:21] Business alone is hard enough.

[09:24] Why make it more difficult and three times as complex by adding more variables in.

[09:29] And so I think what most business owners, most entrepreneurs, can do right now is simply

[09:35] ask the question.

[09:36] And this is usually what I'll start.

[09:37] Any conversation that I have with an entrepreneur who's reaching out for something, right?

[09:41] Or one of the portfolio companies CEOs is I'll just ask the question which is whatever

[09:45] the run rate is at the moment.

[09:46] Let's say it's a million dollars a month.

[09:47] I'm like, what's stopping us from being a five million a month?

[09:51] What's stopping us?

[09:52] And until we can clearly answer that question, there's nothing else we need to do.

[09:56] And when we ask better questions, we get better answers.

[09:59] Why am I not growing is different than why am I not doing it extra million dollars a month?

[10:03] What is stopping us from doing that?

[10:04] And if we can get crystal clear on that, then we can find the constraint and then we can

[10:07] remove the constraint because then we can put all of our effort towards that singular

[10:10] problem.

[10:11] And that, in my opinion, is how you scale companies quickly.

[10:14] It appears fast from the outside.

[10:17] But from the inside, it feels manageable and clear because we're all focused on the one

[10:22] problem that we're solving at this moment, which might be in the beginning.

[10:24] We need to increase our sales team.

[10:26] And then once we've increased our sales team, we might say, hey, you know, we've increased

[10:29] the sales team, but they're not all performing the same level.

[10:31] So it's like, okay, we need to have better onboarding and training for the sales team.

[10:34] Okay, we need to do that.

[10:35] Okay, that's the next problem that we saw when you have consistency in this process.

[10:39] Okay, now we're doing that, but now we're not getting enough leads.

[10:41] Okay, now we'll put all of our focus here.

[10:43] And so each time there's going to be a constraint and we just have to focus our

[10:46] attention towards the constraint.

[10:48] And then instead of doing, we'll debot an act and we will naturally grow to the next

[10:52] level.

[10:53] And so that has been one of the more valuable lessons that I've had.

[10:56] And I will tell you that there are a lot of entrepreneurs who are listening this.

[11:00] You right now, it might be you.

[11:02] So I might be talking to you right now is that you think that you need to start another

[11:06] business or another product line because you were stuck at a current level and somehow

[11:09] think that this new product line or new business is going to solve the problem and it

[11:12] is not.

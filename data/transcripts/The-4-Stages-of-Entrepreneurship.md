[00:00] What's going on everyone?

[00:01] Super excited.

[00:02] It's breakdown.

[00:03] We're talking about today, which is the kind of four big chapters

[00:08] in the growth of business.

[00:09] So zero to a million dollars a year,

[00:10] one a $10 million a year, $10 to a $30 million a year,

[00:13] and then $30 to a million dollars plus.

[00:14] All right.

[00:15] And this is down taking me a long time to figure out,

[00:19] paid significantly.

[00:19] So hopefully this will be a value to you.

[00:22] It's kind of interesting though,

[00:22] because when I learn more about this,

[00:24] it's hard to even learn things without having the context

[00:28] or framework to apply them on.

[00:30] Like unless you have a business,

[00:31] it's hard to understand all the bottlenecks

[00:33] because none of it's real for you.

[00:34] So this will probably be more for the people

[00:36] who have businesses,

[00:37] but if you don't have a business, then please enjoy.

[00:40] That being said, zero to a million,

[00:42] really, really simple.

[00:43] It's just one product on one channel.

[00:49] Very simple.

[00:50] All right.

[00:51] That means you learn how to figure out

[00:52] how to sell one thing on one channel.

[00:54] All right.

[00:55] A channel would be like cold email, Facebook ads.

[00:58] Instagram ads, YouTube ads, referral partners.

[01:02] You know what I mean?

[01:03] All off of organic.

[01:04] You know, I mean, earned media.

[01:05] So all of these are different channels

[01:07] that you can use to acquire customers.

[01:08] And the reason people get stuck in like 100, 300-ish range

[01:13] is usually because they stuff it really nail this.

[01:15] It still happens where they get clients from here and there,

[01:17] but they don't have a reliable system

[01:19] for acquiring customers.

[01:20] All right.

[01:21] Literally, that's zero to a million.

[01:23] It's a reliable system of acquire customers.

[01:25] And doing it.

[01:26] And most people also get stuck here

[01:28] because they have personal problems.

[01:29] Like they're super angry and they hate themselves

[01:32] and they're not good with people.

[01:33] That's type of thing.

[01:34] Like they a lot of times they have the right system.

[01:36] They execute it and then they crash themselves

[01:38] because they have sleeping with their customers

[01:40] or sleeping with their employees.

[01:41] Just like it's just crazy and her personal drama

[01:44] is in this range.

[01:44] But the business, from the business standpoint,

[01:46] it's very simple.

[01:47] It's just one product on one channel

[01:48] and then you just make the math work.

[01:49] So it's just on a thousand more thing.

[01:51] Got to sell 100 a month.

[01:52] That's it.

[01:53] It's all it is.

[01:53] At that's point though, right?

[01:55] A million-ish, two million-ish a year.

[01:58] Now mind you, these are rough.

[01:59] Sometimes it might be one to three,

[02:00] it's just the right year.

[02:01] But once you're in that kind of one to three range,

[02:03] getting to 10 is an entirely different thing.

[02:06] All right, getting to 10 is multi products, right?

[02:12] Now an important note here is that

[02:13] you're not starting multiple businesses, right?

[02:17] It's gonna be cross-cells and up-cells, all right?

[02:22] So that's in another way.

[02:23] It's creating a value ladder.

[02:25] It's creating a backend.

[02:26] What's the next level of service that we can provide these people?

[02:29] What's the next thing that they're naturally gonna want to need

[02:31] or want in need after buying or in extra product?

[02:34] And so thinking through this,

[02:36] it's most people who are in this million dollar range

[02:39] are like, man, what else should I sell them?

[02:41] You're actually in the right question.

[02:43] Exactly the right question.

[02:44] That's what you need to do to get from one to 10.

[02:46] Now, from 10 to 30, it's multiple products

[02:50] and depending, sometimes it's multiple channels.

[02:54] All right, you can kind of do it either way.

[02:58] Either single product on more channels

[02:59] or you can do multiple products on single channel

[03:01] or you can do multiple.

[03:02] Like, that's a little bit wiggle, but I would say the easiest

[03:06] for most people is just focusing on their backend,

[03:09] which is the cross-cells and up-cells.

[03:10] What are the things that this person's actually gonna need next?

[03:12] Which is going to increase our LTV.

[03:14] So basically what happens is,

[03:15] you're selling the same number of units

[03:17] as before, like I was saying,

[03:18] let's say you sold 100 people at that one K LTV.

[03:22] But then you four X, your LTV,

[03:24] and all of a sudden, are five X your LTV, right?

[03:26] This is how it happens.

[03:27] You five X your LTV and it becomes five K over the lifespan

[03:30] and now you're at 500,000 a month.

[03:31] And then because you're 500,000 a month,

[03:33] you can start going to another channel

[03:35] because you're gonna forward to do it

[03:36] because your LTV's higher.

[03:37] So basically what ends up happening is,

[03:38] you learn how to cheaply acquire customers

[03:40] with one channel that you're very well suited for, right?

[03:42] Then you extend and expand the LTV of that customer

[03:45] by introducing a backend.

[03:47] And then once you have that backend,

[03:48] it now opens up other traffic platforms

[03:50] or channels that you wouldn't otherwise be able to afford.

[03:53] But now that you have a superior backend,

[03:54] you can now go broader.

[03:55] That's kind of how it works from a business day to day standpoint.

[03:58] It's zero to a million, one to 10 million.

[04:00] All right, next line here is 10 to 30 million.

[04:03] This is another one where people massively screw up,

[04:06] which is professionalism is professionalizing the business.

[04:09] All right.

[04:10] And this is honestly really painful and it's hard to do.

[04:14] And I'm thankful that I had mentors early on

[04:16] that were like this is what you need to do now

[04:17] because I probably wouldn't have said this is the next thing.

[04:20] But what ends up happening which you're at like 10 million,

[04:22] million a month type ranges,

[04:24] then the thing that made you special,

[04:25] your special sauce here, which may have been a lot of you

[04:27] as the founder, is it starts to get diluted out, right?

[04:31] And then you have customer complain,

[04:33] and customer support issues.

[04:34] And then things, it's just like,

[04:35] you're basically still a really big small business

[04:39] at that 10 million.

[04:39] You don't have the systems,

[04:41] the infrastructure to build more on top of

[04:43] because it's still like Google Sheets and Trello boards.

[04:47] It's just like it's just craziness.

[04:49] It's just trying to manage this.

[04:50] And so this is where you have to hire

[04:51] some more corporate people.

[04:52] And this is what every entrepreneur fears more

[04:55] than anything, right?

[04:56] Is that we fear bringing these corporate suits,

[04:59] who are just gonna suck the life out of you?

[05:01] You're like, I started this business to not have to do that,

[05:02] but you know what?

[05:03] Every massive business in the world

[05:05] was started by a founder, right?

[05:07] Who probably didn't like that?

[05:08] And the reason big businesses run like business businesses,

[05:10] big businesses is because it's the only

[05:12] what a run big businesses.

[05:13] I like you have to have corporate structure,

[05:16] you have to have structure, you have to have hierarchy,

[05:17] you have to have,

[05:18] you have to have HR, you have to have these things in place,

[05:22] so that employees feel more comfortable,

[05:24] but also so that you're protected from liability standpoint,

[05:27] right?

[05:28] Because honestly, once you get into this range,

[05:30] you become a target, right?

[05:31] This is where lawsuits start coming in.

[05:32] This is where lawyers and contracts start mattering

[05:34] and all of this stuff, right?

[05:37] And so professionalizing the business,

[05:38] especially from HR, legal and accounting standpoint,

[05:41] comes here and then the IT systems, right?

[05:44] So this is really like really strengthening the ops

[05:47] and the business, the operational infrastructure.

[05:49] Because what this does is that it makes all of these things

[05:52] that we learn how to upsell before,

[05:54] it really makes them methodical, right?

[05:56] Because people get the same product every time,

[05:59] same product every time.

[06:00] And so then client happiness goes back up,

[06:03] and things are good.

[06:04] Now, the problem is, the people who've committed this $30 million

[06:07] or you're getting from 10 to 30

[06:09] is that they're not innovative at all.

[06:11] If anything, they stifle innovation,

[06:12] because they think what things to go through

[06:13] the certain way and then they just,

[06:15] you know, you want to choke them to death.

[06:17] But you have to do it, right?

[06:18] But the thing is is that if you draw like pendulums, right?

[06:21] If you go too far in that direction,

[06:23] then you lose the creative energy

[06:24] and the drive of the business,

[06:26] because you kind of have these suits

[06:27] that are trying to control everything, right?

[06:29] And so this is the gap that I have struggled to make

[06:31] is going from 30 million plus to $100 million a year.

[06:35] And so I'll share what the mentors that have shared

[06:37] this with me, hopefully it'll be useful for you.

[06:40] But yeah, I mean, we've been, we did 20, 37, 32,

[06:43] I think the last three years.

[06:44] So it just really been stuck at this level,

[06:48] and it's because of this last piece, right?

[06:49] Because the thing that made us, right?

[06:52] Which frankly was me and the entrepreneurs,

[06:55] like drive, and I'm gonna say them

[06:56] the sole response, but obviously our team's amazing

[06:58] and they're the reason this works.

[06:59] But it's saying like, what's the soul, right?

[07:03] And so what it was of having to happen

[07:05] is that at this level, you actually have to have more souls.

[07:09] You have to have more people with the judo, right?

[07:12] More people who can drive, grow,

[07:14] who can take initiative and seize opportunities, right?

[07:19] And so this is kind of the entrepreneur

[07:21] versus the entrepreneur dilemma.

[07:22] It all breaks this down for you.

[07:24] So an entrepreneur is somebody who

[07:27] wants, has entrepreneurial tendencies within

[07:29] within a corporate structure, right?

[07:32] An entrepreneur wants to own their own thing.

[07:35] And I have made horrible mistakes so many times,

[07:39] hiring entrepreneurs and treating them like entrepreneurs.

[07:41] When in reality, I should have just never hired them, right?

[07:44] Because they're gonna tell you, no, I had a business

[07:47] before, I don't have any interest in doing that.

[07:49] And so you really have two kind of two outcomes that happen here.

[07:52] You either have the entrepreneur who comes into your business,

[07:55] lost their judo, right?

[07:57] And now just sits on your business

[07:58] and continue to complain to about how they're not

[08:00] getting paid as much as they could make on their own,

[08:01] but they can't make it on their own,

[08:02] which is why they're with your business, right?

[08:05] Or the person is right and can make more on their own.

[08:08] And so they come into your business,

[08:09] basically regain their confidence,

[08:11] start doing well and then take as much of that business

[08:13] with you as they possibly can.

[08:15] And so either way, the outcomes poor.

[08:17] And so I had to learn that one,

[08:18] the hard way, multiple times in our business,

[08:21] which is don't hire entrepreneurs, right?

[08:23] What you wanna do is find entrepreneurs, all right?

[08:25] These are people who really prefer,

[08:28] they love the entrepreneurial drive of like driving growth,

[08:31] driving change, taking initiatives, building out new things,

[08:34] innovating, right?

[08:36] But they don't have the same appetite for risk, right?

[08:39] And so because of that, they like having this kind of safe

[08:42] place to go experiment into all this stuff,

[08:43] but they still know they're gonna get a paycheck every month.

[08:45] Now that paycheck's variable,

[08:47] but even if they suck, they're still gonna get paid

[08:49] ever paid well, right?

[08:50] And so this is what I have,

[08:52] I've been trying to, you know,

[08:54] in view into our business right now,

[08:55] and it is working, is putting entrepreneurs in places

[09:00] where they can drive change,

[09:02] because if you really think about it,

[09:04] what ends up happening is that your business

[09:06] becomes a conglomeration of smaller sub-businesses, right?

[09:10] If you listen to Jeff Bezos talk about his directors,

[09:13] he actually calls him CEOs,

[09:14] he's like, oh that's CEO of that business,

[09:15] that's CEO of that business,

[09:16] but they're all within Amazon, right?

[09:18] But they're kind of sub-CEOs,

[09:20] and this is the thing is like, you need,

[09:22] you can only provide so much willpower and spirit

[09:28] to a business once it gets to the size,

[09:30] because there's just so many people that you just get diluted,

[09:32] like your spirit, your care,

[09:35] your drive, your vision,

[09:36] just get diluted throughout an organization.

[09:38] And so you need,

[09:39] you need heads that can kind of reinvigorate the business

[09:44] and drive new innovations.

[09:46] And so what ends up happening is,

[09:49] the way the structure looks like,

[09:51] and the way it shifts to, I'll show you real quick.

[09:53] And so,

[09:56] is it shifts to something like this, all right?

[09:59] So you've got your core here, right,

[10:02] which is the operational infrastructure

[10:03] that we put in place from 10 to 30 million.

[10:05] So this is your HR, right, legal,

[10:13] IT finance, right?

[10:17] That's your core, all right?

[10:18] That's the core option of the business.

[10:20] That has to happen, everyone goes to jail, right?

[10:22] People need to get paid, you need to pay taxes,

[10:25] contracts need to be signed, you know,

[10:27] CRM's IT, all that kind of stuff, right?

[10:29] And then what ends up happening

[10:30] is that off of that spoke, right?

[10:33] You have profit centers, right?

[10:36] And inside of a profit center,

[10:37] you're gonna have product,

[10:40] and you're gonna have acquisition, all right?

[10:42] So acquisition's marketing sales

[10:44] and then product, right?

[10:45] And so inside of these,

[10:48] these are all identical, right?

[10:49] Product acquisition, right?

[10:52] Product acquisition, you get the idea, right?

[10:53] And so each of these become profit centers,

[10:57] right, for the business.

[10:58] And so these things can all roll into you,

[11:00] well, this all rolls into someone else, right?

[11:02] From an operational type,

[11:04] but this is really how the business would function, right?

[11:06] And so this is where you might have, you know,

[11:08] product line, you know, number one, right?

[11:10] Product line, number two, product line, number three, right?

[11:14] And each of these are gonna satisfy needs for the customer.

[11:17] Ideally, when you're enumerating these product lines,

[11:19] you wanna use the existing resources that you have

[11:22] and capital and infrastructure

[11:23] to create products that are similar but different, right?

[11:26] So, for example, if I were, if I were, like,

[11:29] because obviously we have a coaching business for gyms,

[11:31] so if I were, you know, expanding,

[11:34] like, services, then what's one of the things

[11:36] that we've added in?

[11:37] So we added in, we call it, boiler room.

[11:41] So this is something like, a lot of our gyms

[11:43] we're asking for more help with sales.

[11:45] And so we're like, well, how about we just train,

[11:47] you guys like, we train our team,

[11:48] like our team drills every morning,

[11:50] we do boiler room, that's how,

[11:51] that's how all of our guys start our day.

[11:52] So one of all of you just,

[11:54] if you want this additional service

[11:55] because not everyone wants it,

[11:57] you can pay a little extra for it

[11:58] and then you can bring all your sales team

[11:59] and we can drill your sales team

[12:00] and so they get pumped up.

[12:01] And the nice thing is something like that

[12:03] just shows such clear ROI to a business

[12:06] that it's like, oh my God, I would never stop paying for this.

[12:08] So it's really sticky, right?

[12:10] And it's high margin.

[12:11] So it literally works for everyone, right?

[12:13] And so it's like we have our core,

[12:14] like, let's fix your business service

[12:17] and with the existing resources we have,

[12:19] which is these are the skill sets

[12:20] and the individuals that we have that work for us,

[12:23] we know that we could create this product line

[12:25] and I'm calling a product on my service line.

[12:28] With little investment, right?

[12:29] We don't have to do a ton of stuff there, right?

[12:31] Whereas when I started the supplement company,

[12:33] that was a huge undertaking

[12:35] that probably wasn't the wisest decision.

[12:37] I was fortunate that we were able to maneuver it

[12:40] and now it's a very, very healthy business.

[12:42] But it took, I mean, but it was very hard

[12:43] and I probably shouldn't have done it in that order, right?

[12:45] I should have thought like, okay,

[12:46] well, they also want someone to run their ads for them.

[12:49] So that's gonna be our done for the agency side.

[12:50] So we're gonna add that in, right?

[12:52] And again, each of these,

[12:53] like this hopefully this makes sense

[12:54] to you delineating these things.

[12:55] It's like, these are all types of services

[12:58] that a customer who comes in would naturally also want

[13:00] in addition and these can be upsells,

[13:02] that will increase the LTV customer,

[13:04] while also making your own service stickier

[13:07] and helping them basically,

[13:08] you wanna envelope the customer

[13:10] with all the things that they want.

[13:11] That being said, you have to have the operational know

[13:13] how to do this and this is where people get screwed up, right?

[13:16] Is that when they create these product lines,

[13:18] they start trying to manage both

[13:19] and then they start trying to manage all three

[13:21] and then they start another business

[13:23] and then they get even crazy, right?

[13:24] And so this is where people massively screw up.

[13:27] And so until you have a true leader

[13:30] and I'm saying a true leader,

[13:32] this person has to be as smart as you are, right?

[13:34] Running a new product division,

[13:36] I would not recommend doing it,

[13:38] which is why business growth is slow

[13:40] because it's all about the people.

[13:41] Like that's the hard part.

[13:42] Every entrepreneur's biggest problem is they can't find good people.

[13:45] It's the hardest part of the world.

[13:46] And it's also because we need to be better people

[13:48] to attract better people and also manage better people,

[13:49] because if you think about it,

[13:51] if I were an omnipotent being, if I were God, right?

[13:55] I could probably perfectly manage everyone

[13:57] to become an A player.

[13:58] So that's a belief that I try and use.

[14:00] It's like, if I were a perfect leader

[14:02] in a perfect manager, I could get everyone

[14:06] to search forward and be the best, right?

[14:10] But I am an imperfect leader

[14:11] and I'm an imperfect manager

[14:12] and so I have to find people that have a little bit

[14:14] of battery included to get the result

[14:17] that we're looking for.

[14:18] So hopefully this makes sense

[14:19] in terms of how you structure the business

[14:20] and how it scales.

[14:21] You know, at this point, this would be like

[14:22] your zero to zero to a million would be here.

[14:25] You go zero to 10 million, maybe with product line one

[14:29] or product line two, add it in, right?

[14:31] Which then allows you to scale your acquisition.

[14:33] So acquisition goes up on each of these things

[14:35] because the total LTV's higher.

[14:37] And so this is ultimately how the business scales.

[14:40] So, hook with your crap for everyone.

[14:42] If you're zero to a million, you don't need to work

[14:45] out anything.

[14:46] You guys saw one product on one channel.

[14:47] That's it.

[14:48] You got to get good enough at it

[14:48] that you can do it repeatedly in your sleep.

[14:50] Once you have that, then you're like, okay,

[14:52] we got this on lock.

[14:53] Now we can sum multiple products these people.

[14:54] So I need to find somebody who's good,

[14:56] put them in charge of this, help them build out a product line

[14:58] that is an entrepreneur and then will cross

[15:01] them into this additional service or product line

[15:04] that doesn't require a ton of capital investment.

[15:06] What else could we provide these people

[15:07] that they're been asking for, right?

[15:09] From 10 to 30 million, it's like, all right.

[15:11] Now we need IT, we need legal, we need HR,

[15:13] we need compliance, we need all of this other crap

[15:15] because you become a target straight up,

[15:16] you become a target in the business.

[15:18] And so you professionalize the business

[15:20] but you can't lose the entrepreneurial spirit.

[15:21] To not lose the entrepreneurial spirit

[15:23] is when you hire entrepreneurs

[15:25] and then you put them in charge of product lines,

[15:27] all put around the central spoke of the infrastructure

[15:32] for operations.

[15:33] So hopefully that makes sense.

[15:34] Hopefully that met valuable.

[15:35] If you're in the zero to one million dollar range,

[15:37] then just don't get distracted with sharing objects.

[15:39] Focus on one product, on one channel.

[15:41] It's all you need to do.

[15:43] Keep being awesome.

[15:43] I'll catch you guys soon.

[15:44] Bye.

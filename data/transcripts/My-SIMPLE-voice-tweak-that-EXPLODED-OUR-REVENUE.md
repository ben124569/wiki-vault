[00:00] In this video, I want to talk about why you're probably not closing as many sales as you

[00:03] hope you are.

[00:04] Now, there's a lot of opponents, components, too closing deals, right?

[00:06] You have the actual offer itself, price point, the prospect, the process they went through.

[00:10] So I actually think there's five peas in that have to happen and be alignment prior to

[00:14] the sale.

[00:15] So the first is the promotion for the right prospect at the right price, for the right product,

[00:20] following the right process.

[00:21] Right?

[00:22] There's the five peas that I think through when I'm looking at an entire sales pipeline.

[00:25] But what I want to talk about specifically today is why, even if you're following

[00:27] other things correctly and you're getting on the phone, you have a script that you know

[00:29] works or your team has a script that you you wrote out because you know it works, right?

[00:34] If they're not closing, then it means that they may be saying the right things, but they may

[00:38] be saying it the wrong way.

[00:40] And so there's two components to saying the right things the right way.

[00:45] So one is tone and the second is cadence, right?

[00:49] It's emphasis.

[00:50] And so I want to give you an example of both of those things.

[00:52] So for example, if I were to give you a script like you know Jerry Seinfeld's comedy script

[01:01] and you were to get on stage and you were trying to deliver that, right?

[01:04] The tone, the pauses that you would have would not be the same as his, right?

[01:08] His intonations would be different than yours or aren't.

[01:10] And so as a result he would be funny and you would not be and you'd be wondering like, well

[01:13] this works for Jerry, why is it not working for me?

[01:16] And so just like that, you may be looking at your team and wondering like, well this works

[01:19] for me, why is it not working for them?

[01:20] And you're looking and they're saying the words really, why is it not working?

[01:23] It's because they're saying them the wrong way.

[01:25] And so let me illustrate this in a different way.

[01:27] So if I were to say my own name, so if Layla, my wife calls me and she says Alex, right?

[01:31] Or Alex, or Alex, right?

[01:34] All three of those are just my name, right?

[01:37] Said differently, have different meanings.

[01:38] I'll give you another example.

[01:39] I got this from Jason Flylan.

[01:40] I love this.

[01:41] I didn't say he hit his wife.

[01:43] I didn't say he hit his wife.

[01:45] I didn't say he hit his wife.

[01:47] I didn't say he hit his wife.

[01:50] I didn't say he hit his wife.

[01:52] I didn't say he hit his wife.

[01:54] I didn't say he hit his wife.

[01:57] And so each of those sentences has different meaning, right?

[02:01] Because of the emphasis that we put on the words.

[02:04] And so just like both, so one is you have the tone that you're using, the pauses

[02:09] or you put emphasis, right?

[02:11] And then you have how you're saying the words.

[02:14] And so what happens is you have somebody who's reading a script, but they aren't

[02:17] reading it the right way.

[02:18] There's two ways to fix this.

[02:20] One of them is to become a master salesman, right?

[02:22] And learn how to control your tone, right?

[02:25] Learn when to lower your voice so that what you're saying shows the prospect that it's

[02:29] really important, right?

[02:30] Some slowing down what I'm saying.

[02:32] I'm lowering my tone so that you know that you need to pay attention to what I'm

[02:35] saying.

[02:36] Where it's really exciting.

[02:37] I'm talking about all this stuff.

[02:38] It's really exciting.

[02:39] We're all fast-paced.

[02:40] We're all up here, right?

[02:41] Then it's going to communicate something different, even if we're both saying the same

[02:45] words.

[02:46] And so one of those things happens from repetition, right?

[02:47] You learn, you start to learn this stuff because you're like, man, I nailed that

[02:50] out.

[02:51] What did I do right?

[02:52] And so one of my side-note recommendations for everyone is, everyone here, hopefully,

[02:54] has been on a hot streak at some point.

[02:56] There's some days you get on the phone, you're like, man, I can just close anyone right

[02:59] now.

[03:00] When you are hot, those are the videos you should watch.

[03:04] That's the game-taped footage that you should go over and over and over again.

[03:07] In the beginning, you might not have that.

[03:09] You have to watch other people's stuff.

[03:10] But when you're hot, you say things differently.

[03:14] You pause at different points.

[03:15] It's those micro nuances that create master salesmen and the true master salesmen, right?

[03:21] The difference between a 250-battern, a 300-battern, right, for a baseball analogy.

[03:24] It's like one, one hit every two or three games, right?

[03:26] It's not a huge difference.

[03:28] But that's the difference between a master salesman and a poor salesman.

[03:30] And average salesman is that great salesmen never get cold.

[03:34] They are always on a hot streak because they know how to recreate success.

[03:38] And it's because they know how to say the things the right way for the right prospect.

[03:41] And so, to wrap this up for you, if you have your sales team, right?

[03:45] The easiest tactic is to get them to a watch the footage of themselves when they were

[03:50] hot.

[03:51] And if they haven't watched other people who were hot and what they were saying at that point

[03:55] because there are minor ways and tonality and shifts and pauses that you will do when

[04:00] you are assuming the close the right way, when you're projecting the confidence, when you

[04:03] have the conviction that communicates differently.

[04:05] Let me give you a fun tip that I found.

[04:07] We always close the highest percentage on our deals when we had people finishing our program,

[04:13] because on the days that we would finish our cohorts, our groups of clients, we'd have

[04:18] all these success stories that would go again after another, after another, after another,

[04:20] we'd do all these interviews on one day.

[04:22] And so my sales team would watch this happen and then they would get on the phones and

[04:26] they would be so convicted about what they were selling.

[04:28] And so this leads into the two ways that you can fix this.

[04:32] So number one is that you become a master salesman.

[04:33] You become a master salesman through repetition and through studying game tip footage, which

[04:36] is the first thing I said.

[04:37] The second way and the faster way of doing this is to believe in what you saw.

[04:41] This is hard.

[04:42] I'll be right with you.

[04:43] This is hard for a lot of people, especially if you're a business owner, because you

[04:46] know all the problems in your business.

[04:48] They're always going to be problems and those aren't going to go away.

[04:50] And so one of the things that I have, I have hacked in my own mind, is asking two other

[04:55] questions, which is, I will never have a perfect product and I'll tell you that right now,

[04:58] but I can have perfect intentions.

[05:01] And so that is something that you can delineate for yourself.

[05:03] Number one, and you know your intentions.

[05:05] So if you're in intentions on a perfect, then you can fix those and you can have perfect

[05:07] intentions.

[05:08] But your product will never be perfect, because it could always improve.

[05:12] The second thing in terms of improving it is knowing that the prospect we better served

[05:18] working with you than with anyone else.

[05:20] And so that is something that I have, I have looked at.

[05:23] And so this is easier for somebody who's getting into a marketplace and you can see the

[05:26] other competitors there there.

[05:27] You may not be perfect, but you can believe that you're the absolute best shot that this

[05:32] person has to be successful.

[05:33] And this is especially true if you have some sort of education or training type business

[05:38] where someone is required to do something.

[05:39] So if you're helping someone with life coaching or helping someone with weight loss,

[05:43] you're helping someone with their business.

[05:45] These are all skills that they have to develop.

[05:47] You cannot eat the food for someone.

[05:48] You cannot do the push-ups for someone.

[05:49] You cannot hop on the sales call for them.

[05:52] They have to learn in the skill.

[05:53] Which means that you can provide something, but they also have to come the other half of the

[05:56] distance.

[05:57] And so the way to continue to have that conviction is one, recognize your intentions.

[06:01] If you can fix your intentions, then your intentions are perfect, then that is going to be

[06:04] a huge step for that you'll have over your competition.

[06:06] Because then it will force you or cause you to say the things the right way.

[06:10] Because people can feel conviction.

[06:12] They can feel the subtle nuances of how you communicate and they will choose to believe

[06:15] you, not based on what you say, but on how you say it.

[06:18] And the second way is by making sure that your product is the best and that it is the

[06:22] best shot that this person has.

[06:24] You can't say, I guarantee that you're going to lose weight.

[06:27] I can't say I'll guarantee that you're going to make more money.

[06:29] Because you can't control the variables.

[06:32] But you can guarantee that you will be the best shot that this person has at being

[06:35] successful.

[06:36] And so for me, cracking that code mentally helped me a lot, especially in weight loss

[06:41] sales when I was starting out, because I would have someone in and I knew the stats.

[06:45] I knew that in six months, you know, half the people who were signing up, weren't going

[06:48] to be at the gym.

[06:49] I knew that.

[06:50] But the thing is, I can't look at someone and say, well, you know, maybe maybe they

[06:54] shouldn't sign up because I mean, half the people aren't going to, aren't going to show up

[06:57] you know, within six months.

[06:58] But instead, I was able to shift and this was something I had to learn that I

[07:02] am still the best shot this person has at getting where they want to go.

[07:05] Right.

[07:06] They're still going to have to do stuff on their part.

[07:07] But I know with conviction that my intentions are perfect and that I am the best shot

[07:10] they have at getting where they want to go.

[07:12] That is the conviction that I can stand on, that I can look someone in the eyes through

[07:15] their soul and tell them that I were the best shot for them to be successful.

[07:19] And that is how you can change the way you speak so you can speak with conviction to a prospect.

[07:22] And that is what I found.

[07:23] And so hopefully you find this valuable.

[07:25] If you are not selling or your team is not selling the way you want it, it's not necessarily

[07:28] because the words you are saying, sure, it's all the other things that I said.

[07:31] The promotion, the offer that you're running, right, the process that you're taking them

[07:34] through, the price that you're selling it, who you are selling to, the prospect themselves.

[07:38] All of those things are going to be things that are going to weigh into whether or not

[07:41] it's successful.

[07:42] But once you are actually on the phone with a person, fundamentally, a sale is simply a

[07:45] transfer of belief.

[07:46] And if you do not believe, then you cannot transfer that belief.

[07:48] And the way that you communicate belief is not in what you say, but how you say it.

[07:51] And so hopefully that was valuable for you.

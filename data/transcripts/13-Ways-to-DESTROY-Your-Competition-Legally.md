[00:00] The first way to legally destroy your competition,

[00:02] by the way I'll explain this 13, is network effects.

[00:06] So you can have different types of network effects.

[00:07] The first type is a customer base.

[00:09] So that's having a large, various, established user base

[00:12] that by the nature of it being large,

[00:14] attracts even more people to the network.

[00:16] So if it's just you, that's not an network.

[00:19] If it's you and two other people,

[00:20] all of a sudden people are like, I want to join that group.

[00:22] But when you have that fourth really good person,

[00:24] now a fifth wants to come in.

[00:25] And as every additional person gets added,

[00:28] that network becomes more valuable.

[00:30] And so if you're like, how does this actually work

[00:32] in the real world?

[00:33] Well, give you two very different examples.

[00:34] So one is you can think of Facebook, right?

[00:36] Social platforms.

[00:37] So a platform is invaluable until lots of people are on it.

[00:40] But once lots of people are on it,

[00:41] well, no one wants to join the small platform

[00:43] because there's no one's on it.

[00:44] But if everyone's on this one,

[00:45] then they can instantly connect with more people.

[00:47] Now, in a very different version of that

[00:49] in the hardware world, is telecommunications company.

[00:52] She'll look at Verizon, you'll look at AT&T

[00:54] as they were racing to create their monopolies,

[00:56] which they more or less have.

[00:58] And I'll explain what that word means in a second.

[01:00] They were offering all these benefits

[01:02] for people joining in families

[01:05] and free texting between people

[01:07] who are on the same network as them

[01:08] so that they could encourage more people

[01:10] to be on those networks

[01:11] and then there were advantages of being inside of it.

[01:13] Now, customer basis, the first type of network effect,

[01:16] a different type of network effect

[01:17] is a product ecosystem.

[01:18] So think of something like Apple, right?

[01:20] They have all these unique plugs

[01:22] and all these unique software

[01:23] as an operating systems

[01:24] that only work on Apple products.

[01:26] And once you buy one Apple product

[01:28] or two Apple products, all of a sudden,

[01:29] you don't want to mix and match PC and Android

[01:32] and all this stuff into your world of technology.

[01:34] And so they create a closed loop system

[01:38] where everything works with itself.

[01:40] And if your product is good enough

[01:42] that you can get people iPhones,

[01:45] then you can get millions and millions of users

[01:47] to then just buy all these other core products

[01:50] that they have less affinity towards

[01:53] and then force them to use all of your products

[01:56] because of one champion product that everyone has.

[01:59] And so sometimes if you're thinking about this for your own business

[02:02] it's like, okay, one is there a way that I can structure

[02:05] what I have.

[02:06] So if more people enter my network from a customer base

[02:09] it adds value to every other business,

[02:12] every other customer.

[02:13] So the opposite of this is a traditional service business.

[02:15] Usually if you're one on one with a client,

[02:17] you provide value.

[02:18] As soon as you're one on two,

[02:20] then it provides less value.

[02:21] And some most businesses are structured to deteriorate

[02:24] as more customers come in.

[02:26] Versus things like a buyer's group.

[02:29] So if you have 20 dentists who get together

[02:31] and say, hey, we're gonna all buy together

[02:33] because we're going to get cheaper prices

[02:36] than as more dentists come into that association.

[02:39] You get more and more buying power

[02:40] and then you become a greater and greater monopoly

[02:43] and have more leverage over your potential vendors.

[02:46] Right?

[02:47] And so you can think about incorporating

[02:48] these elements into your business

[02:49] to make the business more competitive

[02:53] and harder for anybody else to disrupt you.

[02:57] And this competitive advantage is so valuable

[02:59] that tech companies and these massive behemoths

[03:01] are willing to lose billions of dollars

[03:03] to establish this network

[03:04] because they know that once they've mapped an ecosystem

[03:07] then they can profit in all sorts of ways.

[03:10] The second way to destroy your competition

[03:12] is exclusive control over a resource or technology.

[03:16] So we have example of resource.

[03:17] So possessing exclusive rights to essential resources

[03:21] or materials that are crucial for production for some goods.

[03:24] Right? So like the Debeir's group

[03:26] which is a big diamond group

[03:27] historically has controlled a huge portion

[03:29] of the diamond market.

[03:31] And by doing that they made a full control supply and demand.

[03:33] And since they own most of the minds

[03:35] and the distribution they can basically set the prices

[03:38] because supply and demand exist.

[03:40] And so believe it or not, there's more diamonds

[03:42] there are dishwashers in the United States

[03:44] but they're valued more

[03:45] because they control supply to keep the prices high.

[03:48] And this is a huge advantage to them.

[03:49] Imagine if all those diamonds got released

[03:52] and they were what they really are

[03:53] which is not nearly as rare as sapphires,

[03:57] emeralds and rubies are.

[03:58] But how amazing would it be to have this big stock pile

[04:00] of stuff that you got for almost nothing

[04:02] that you can sell for exorbitant amounts of money?

[04:05] That's a competitive advantage.

[04:06] So you've got the natural world where you've got

[04:08] like diamonds or there's resources, right?

[04:10] But in the technological world you've got data

[04:12] and proprietary tech.

[04:13] So that would be patents or a huge amount of data

[04:16] that other people don't have access to

[04:17] and cannot replicate legally,

[04:18] which creates a huge barrier to entry.

[04:20] So I'll give you an example that's really easy to understand.

[04:22] So Google search will literally never be beaten at the keyboard

[04:27] inserted search.

[04:28] I'm going to be clear because there's other things

[04:29] that can happen later, right?

[04:31] But search itself, Google will always have more data

[04:34] because they started first.

[04:36] And so if somebody starts today and can collect

[04:39] lots and lots of search data,

[04:40] Google still has 20 years of experience and data

[04:43] on all of these users across the world.

[04:46] And they can use all those algorithm refinements

[04:48] that they have that no one else has

[04:50] to continually make better models,

[04:52] which is why even though OpenAI and ChatGPT

[04:54] have become a huge source of search in the world,

[04:57] Google is still very much a threat,

[04:59] even though they're called behind on AI in that race,

[05:03] they're still ahead on the data.

[05:05] And if slash when Google makes its bigger play

[05:08] into AI, they already have everywhere you've ever

[05:11] searched on Google Maps, every email you've ever sent,

[05:14] they have the stuff that you buy on the Android store,

[05:16] and everything you search on your phone,

[05:17] they have all of that data.

[05:19] And so they're going to be able to personalize their AI better.

[05:21] Because I will make one bet, which is the best AI that will win,

[05:24] not necessarily the first one.

[05:26] Because as soon as you use a better one,

[05:27] you'll immediately switch.

[05:29] So I don't think that they're in some crazy rush.

[05:31] I think what they want is better.

[05:33] And in fact, Google dominated search for so long

[05:36] that it became so apparent that they were something

[05:40] that the government calls a monopoly.

[05:43] And so the government has tried for many years

[05:45] to try and break apart Google's monopoly for search,

[05:47] and Google is very good at defending itself with all the lawyers

[05:50] in the world, and they've pretty much been able to just keep

[05:52] that monopoly in place.

[05:54] And so these competitive traits that I'm talking about for businesses,

[05:58] you don't need to have all 13 that I'm going to talk about.

[06:01] I want you to go through it and be like,

[06:02] is there one of these that I can more directly weave in

[06:07] to the fabric of my business so that I develop

[06:09] a stronger and stronger competitive position over time

[06:13] rather than an eroding one?

[06:15] So speaking of the government, the third way

[06:17] to crush your competition is government regulations

[06:19] and licensing.

[06:20] So there's two types that matter most right now.

[06:22] One is government grants, the other is licensing requirement.

[06:24] So government grants have usually exclusive rights

[06:27] from the government to operate in some sort of particular market.

[06:30] So that's utilities or public transportation.

[06:32] And so things like Amtrak.

[06:34] So Amtrak operates as a government-granted monopoly

[06:38] in the United States for rail service.

[06:40] So they have exclusive rights to operate certain routes

[06:43] that literally no one else is allowed to operate.

[06:46] So talk about being able to like set your own prices.

[06:48] Now there's things that come with that,

[06:50] but talk about like going out of business.

[06:52] It's like, well, literally no one else is allowed to do business.

[06:55] And as long as people want the transport method,

[06:57] they're going to stay in business.

[06:58] So this second is strict licensing requirements.

[07:01] So basically, you can operate.

[07:03] So Amtrak has this type of service between states,

[07:06] or you could do one service in a specific area of territory.

[07:09] And so like utilities like Con Edison, which is in New York,

[07:12] has a strict mandate from the government

[07:14] to operate that area.

[07:15] And so they have, so anybody who wants to get in there

[07:18] has super high barriers to entry.

[07:20] And just to give you context how that will this is,

[07:22] Con Edison's revenue last year is about 16 billion.

[07:25] So that's more than a billion a month.

[07:27] And since we're in the great city of Las Vegas,

[07:30] I think one of the big obvious ones is,

[07:32] once you go through the regulatory process

[07:34] of getting a casino license,

[07:36] it's basically a licensed to print money.

[07:38] Because they say that people can literally just

[07:40] hand you money with a low chance of winning,

[07:42] the same thing for lotteries.

[07:44] Because they're so lucrative, because you guarantee the odds

[07:48] that you win.

[07:48] And the only thing you have to do is market the lottery.

[07:50] And when people have a chance to win for money,

[07:52] for no work, guess what?

[07:53] People do it.

[07:54] And so the government has to grant that

[07:57] and have big taxes on those corporations

[07:59] because they know that they're going to make money.

[08:03] And so I'll tell you fun, hermozzy family story.

[08:05] But one of my relatives in Iran owned the national lottery.

[08:10] And so he did very well until obviously the revolution

[08:13] over through.

[08:14] And then everything was confiscated for his family

[08:16] and many others like mine.

[08:19] But he owned the lottery.

[08:21] And so he was allowed to come up with all sorts of promotions

[08:25] as long as he wrote a check to the government.

[08:27] And so these things have occurred

[08:30] across different countries, across borders.

[08:32] And so sometimes simply having the knowledge

[08:35] of navigating the government regulations

[08:38] to get a grant or permission to do business in a certain way

[08:42] gives you competitive advantage.

[08:44] Even something on a smaller scale is simple

[08:46] in some of the hard states as getting a liquor license.

[08:49] If you have a liquor license, you're able to sell liquor

[08:51] at huge margins.

[08:52] And so it becomes a huge profit center in the business.

[08:54] And so that's a small example.

[08:56] But they all fundamentally are around the same effect.

[08:59] Now you might be like, well, how am I going to use the government

[09:01] stuff?

[09:01] Well, some massive companies like Oracle,

[09:04] they've been able to get that and I'll talk about there

[09:06] just way of destroying competition in a second.

[09:07] But the fourth way you can destroy one that anyone can use

[09:10] is economies of scale.

[09:11] And so there's two different ways that you can attack this.

[09:14] One is cost advantages.

[09:15] And so basically you achieve a lower cost basis per unit sold

[09:20] through larger scale production.

[09:22] And so that allows you to undercut prices

[09:24] and to turn smaller competitors.

[09:26] So it means other people who are smaller can't

[09:28] bind the volume that you can.

[09:30] And so as a result, can't price low as you can.

[09:34] And so this is a price-based strategy.

[09:38] As in, you can still make a profit at a lower price

[09:42] than all of your competition.

[09:43] And so this is a low cost leader strategy, which typically

[09:47] is paired with economies of scale.

[09:49] Where you don't want to get into, and this,

[09:51] I want to make this a clear cautionary tale,

[09:53] is that if you're getting into one of these markets,

[09:55] there's no advantage, this is dank, kind of equal.

[09:57] There's no advantage to being the second cheapest player

[10:00] in a marketplace.

[10:01] The cool thing with this strategy is that it gets better

[10:06] with time.

[10:07] And so that's what you'll notice as a common thing,

[10:09] which each of these points is that as you have a greater network

[10:12] or as you have a more robust ecosystem of products

[10:16] or you have larger economies of scale,

[10:18] most businesses like I said, degrade with scale.

[10:21] They get worse and harder with scale.

[10:23] Whereas if you have one of these strategic advantages,

[10:25] woven into the fabric of your business, as you get bigger,

[10:29] and the business becomes more complex,

[10:31] you have another force that's driving your competitors away.

[10:34] So you have something that's very strong

[10:36] in working in your favor as you scale,

[10:39] which is one of the key traits of becoming a very large business

[10:41] is having one of these thoughts into your DNA,

[10:45] woven day one.

[10:46] So for example, my software company Allen,

[10:48] we started scheduling appointments,

[10:49] 100 appointments a day, a thousand appointments a day,

[10:51] we got up to four, five thousand appointments a day,

[10:53] and we still continue to do that in that company.

[10:55] And so as we acquire more data and we send more messages,

[10:59] we get economies of scale on literally messaging itself.

[11:02] And so if somebody else wants to come in

[11:04] and we're sending millions of messages a day,

[11:06] they're gonna have to pay more per message than we do.

[11:09] And so with that,

[11:10] we know that we actually have increasing margins

[11:13] as we have more messages that go out

[11:15] in addition to the data that we have that no one else has.

[11:18] And so that is a compounding advantage

[11:20] that makes it harder to compete

[11:22] if someone starts to years later than us.

[11:24] And again, any one of these competitive modes

[11:28] will be enough to build you a massive multi-billion dollar company.

[11:32] And so you don't need more than one of these.

[11:34] You just need to do one right all the way.

[11:37] The fifth way to destroy competition is vertical integration.

[11:40] Now this is one of the sweet hearts of private equity

[11:42] because it's something that usually capital can come in to do.

[11:44] And this is something that we've done in multiple

[11:46] or portfolio companies, which we'll talk about in a second.

[11:48] So there's two kind of common ones

[11:50] that people have.

[11:51] One is control over supply and the other's distribution networks.

[11:54] So control over supply means the own everything

[11:57] that is required from kind of click to close.

[12:00] And so in the DeBears example I gave earlier,

[12:02] they owned the mines all the way to owning the front store.

[12:05] Or Tesla, right?

[12:08] When Elon is building the cars,

[12:10] he wants to get his close to supply chain of like,

[12:12] where do I get steel from all the way to the actual retailers,

[12:16] which are just Tesla retailers that sell online to the customer?

[12:20] So you vertically integrated the entire chain end to end,

[12:22] and you was able to capture margin at every step.

[12:25] And by doing that, you can have a more profitable business

[12:28] and or sell products that are better than other people

[12:31] at lower prices because you can eat into your own margin

[12:33] and then put everyone else out of business.

[12:35] And so their multiple advantages to controlling your supply.

[12:39] One is that you can control quality all the way through.

[12:41] And everyone is aligned with the end user

[12:44] and the ultimate business at large.

[12:46] The other piece is that you control disruption

[12:48] because if you have vendors that you rely on

[12:51] for key components of your products,

[12:53] if those vendors got a business,

[12:55] then it threatens your business.

[12:56] And so by controlling all of these things,

[12:58] like controls kind of the opposite of risk

[13:00] and a lot of businesses,

[13:01] if you control those elements,

[13:02] then they are things that you can manipulate

[13:04] and adjust more proactively than being reliant

[13:08] on third parties.

[13:09] So you not only capture the profit and high-fired quality,

[13:12] but you also decrease the risk of the business.

[13:14] So let me give you a one-point-o example

[13:17] of how this would work.

[13:18] So by being a self-publisher, which I am,

[13:21] instead of hiring a publisher to publish my books,

[13:24] I take over a second portion of the business.

[13:27] And so rather than relying on publishers

[13:29] to print and distribute the stuff that I have,

[13:32] I print and distribute the books that I sell

[13:35] because I have the relationship with the customer, you guys.

[13:38] And I'm the one who wrote the book,

[13:39] I didn't go straight it out.

[13:41] And I now can make sure that the size of the book,

[13:44] which is a little bit unique,

[13:45] which I did on purpose,

[13:46] because I wanted to be like a kid's book

[13:47] and very approachable,

[13:48] those are all things that somebody else might not be willing to do.

[13:51] Now if I wanted to keep eating up the supply chain,

[13:53] I would then go to buying the warehouses that do it,

[13:57] rather than just simply using the warehouses

[13:59] that do the distribution.

[14:00] And if I want to take another one,

[14:01] I would buy the printing presses.

[14:03] And if I would take another chunk up the ladder,

[14:05] it would be I would buy paper mills.

[14:07] And so you can keep vertically integrating until it's

[14:09] my own forests that I take to my paper mills,

[14:12] to make paper.

[14:13] And then they go to my warehouses

[14:15] where I distribute the books that go to my retail,

[14:19] which is me fundamentally as the storefront,

[14:21] that actually get the customer's departure.

[14:24] And so that would be a completely vertically integrated

[14:27] product line.

[14:28] And if you think about their products in that way,

[14:32] then you think, wow, think about all the margin

[14:34] that's included in a book.

[14:35] So go from literally water and sunlight,

[14:38] which is what it takes to grow trees and time,

[14:41] all the way to a quote influencer who has lots of impressions

[14:45] and free media that can drive sales.

[14:47] So you're basically selling free media

[14:50] with sunshine and water.

[14:52] And that's where you have everything in between

[14:54] is where all the middleman take a slice.

[14:56] And if you can eat all of that up, you have all the control.

[14:59] The sixth way to destroy your competition

[15:01] and my personal favorite is a strong brand identity

[15:04] and customer loyalty.

[15:05] And the reason I like this one so much is that some of the other

[15:07] as I mentioned, sometimes there are car huge amount of time

[15:09] or a lot of complexity like government regulations.

[15:12] And some of them are just a car out of capital, right?

[15:14] Which if you're starting a business or you have a small business,

[15:15] it might be harder to develop over time.

[15:17] But this one is one that you can make with skill,

[15:20] which is why I love it so much.

[15:22] Which with brand power, you can build powerful associations

[15:26] and then your brand becomes synonymous with the product itself.

[15:29] So for example, Google is synonymous with search engines,

[15:32] clean-ax for tissues, band aids for,

[15:34] I don't even know the actual name for band aids is,

[15:36] because it's so synonymous, like tissue-based,

[15:39] I who even knows, right?

[15:41] And so the advantage when you have a strong brand like Nike

[15:44] is that you can simply take your logo,

[15:46] put it on a commoditized product

[15:47] and get higher conversion rates, lower costual car customers,

[15:51] at premium prices.

[15:53] And so you get massive improvements to the business.

[15:56] Because fundamentally, if you can price above your competition

[15:59] and increase the demand for what you have,

[16:02] what a competitive advantage.

[16:03] And the thing is is that you can simply build it

[16:05] with time and skill, which is why I love it.

[16:09] And anyone can build a brand if they know how to keep their promises

[16:12] and make associations clearly and deliberately

[16:15] over a long period of time with what their customers value.

[16:19] And then strongly disassociate with the things

[16:22] and the people that their customers don't value.

[16:25] Until over time, people just have

[16:27] associate that value intrinsically with the brand itself.

[16:31] And so me personally, I've tried very hard

[16:34] to teach lots of business stuff to business owners

[16:37] because I believe that private enterprises

[16:39] the only way that we can save the world.

[16:41] And so I want as many entrepreneurs getting as big a business

[16:44] as they possibly can to help the most customers

[16:46] and do it the right way so they can build businesses that last.

[16:49] So that capitalism has a fucking chance.

[16:53] If you're a business owner and want to figure out

[16:55] which of these strategies is right for your business,

[16:57] come out to a workshop.

[16:58] We just started running these at our headquarters here in Vegas,

[17:00] at acquisition.com.

[17:02] So that's you.

[17:03] Good acquisition.com.

[17:04] Click scale.

[17:05] And if you qualify, we'll see you here.

[17:07] Weighted destroyer competitors number seven,

[17:09] strategic pricing.

[17:09] And so you can think about this from a price discrimination

[17:12] perspective and for a predatory pricing perspective.

[17:15] And I'm using the literal terms.

[17:17] Don't read into it.

[17:18] So predatory pricing is basically temporarily

[17:20] lowing prices where your profits can outlast

[17:25] selling at a loss so that no one else can enter the marketplace.

[17:28] And the most classic example of this was Microsoft

[17:30] is any person you wanted to add a new feature

[17:33] to the Microsoft suite they would immediately copy that,

[17:37] put it into their bundle, not raise the price.

[17:39] And then that person, fundamentally,

[17:41] everybody who already had Microsoft just kept paying Microsoft

[17:44] and got that feature for free.

[17:45] This is very, very common in software where everyone's

[17:47] in a features war where they try and copy everyone else's stuff

[17:50] and give it away for the same price or free.

[17:53] So for example, a simple version of that is Instagram,

[17:58] copied Snapchat's stories, made it Instagram stories,

[18:00] and basically stalled Snapchat's growth as soon as they

[18:04] were able to do that.

[18:05] And so that's a version of it which is predatory pricing.

[18:07] The other is price discrimination which is founded

[18:10] on selling different prices to different people.

[18:14] So this is maximizing profit.

[18:15] So someone walks in the door and you say,

[18:17] hey, how much money you got?

[18:19] And they say, a lot.

[18:20] You say, okay, well, these pair's issues are $200.

[18:22] And somebody else walks in the door and they say,

[18:24] you say, how much money you got.

[18:25] They're like less than that guy.

[18:26] And you're like, all right, well, these shoes are $100.

[18:28] You sell the same product at two different prices

[18:30] to different people based on their spending power.

[18:32] And so one of the classic examples of this is airline.

[18:35] So they collect tons and tons of data on other users.

[18:38] And so by the way, if you have credit card points

[18:40] with an airline, they know all you're spending, by the way.

[18:43] And by the way, most airlines make the majority

[18:46] of their money on the credit card systems

[18:48] and just use all of the airline stuff

[18:50] as the coolest benefits program to get people to use their cards.

[18:53] If you didn't know that.

[18:55] In fact, they get 3% of all of what you spend on your credit card.

[18:58] That's their income.

[18:59] And so if you barely ever use your, you know,

[19:02] Southwest points, but you spend $20,000 a year in your credit card,

[19:07] they make $600 a year on you, no matter what.

[19:10] And so if you and somebody else are looking at the same flight

[19:14] with the same seat, you might get displayed

[19:16] two very different prices based on what they know

[19:18] your spending power is and your need is.

[19:20] And if you have that kind of competitive data,

[19:22] compared to your competition, then you can make more profit

[19:26] than they can.

[19:27] And so, regressing this down to a small business,

[19:29] the way I think about this is being very clear

[19:32] on the one or two customer segments or avatars

[19:34] that you really serve and being able to segment those people

[19:37] so that you can sell to the right wallet.

[19:41] Right?

[19:41] Now, so discriminatory pricing is literally selling

[19:43] the same thing at two different prices for different people.

[19:46] I don't personally like this.

[19:48] And so the way that I feel ethically okay about it

[19:50] is I like to tweak my offer just a little bit

[19:52] so that when I have the rich person,

[19:54] I can add one thing like a free cocktail worth third thing

[19:57] and charge a lot more for it.

[19:58] But I can still ethically say these two things were different.

[20:01] So if they ever do meet on the plane and say,

[20:02] how much did you pay for your ticket?

[20:03] How much did you pay for your ticket?

[20:04] I can at least, they came to the owner and be like,

[20:06] hey, why do I pay 200?

[20:07] I've paid 160 and we bought in the same hour.

[20:09] They're like, well, you got a cocktail.

[20:11] Now the person might be like, well, if I had known,

[20:13] I'd be like, well, they still were different.

[20:16] And so that at least gives me a little bit of stress

[20:19] to free sleep, I'll put it that way.

[20:20] And so having a couple tiny things that you can change

[20:22] about your offer, especially works well with services,

[20:25] allows you to price more aggressively

[20:28] to someone spending power or need while ethically

[20:30] being able to sleep at night without saying

[20:32] that you sold the same thing for two different prices.

[20:35] And as a fun bonus for this one,

[20:36] is that pricing compared to all of the other things

[20:39] that I've talked about so far is one of the easiest

[20:42] levers to build and manipulate,

[20:44] compared to government regulation or massive economies

[20:47] of scale.

[20:47] You can do this one much faster and you can do it on a smaller scale.

[20:50] So number eight is exclusive contracts with three different parties.

[20:54] So you can either have exclusive contracts that control supply

[20:57] so no one else can get supply.

[20:59] So if I am herhys and I have a contract with the farmers group

[21:04] in Africa that gets the coconut nibs that are required

[21:06] for chocolate, then I make it very difficult

[21:08] for anybody else to get into the chocolate business,

[21:10] unless they resell from me,

[21:12] which means I'm still gonna make a profit on their business.

[21:15] The second way you can think about that is customers.

[21:17] So government contracts is a classic example

[21:20] where if you get a contract like Lockheed Martin does

[21:23] for making fighter jets or whatever they make

[21:24] for the government for defense,

[21:26] then the government is known to be able to keep that contract

[21:30] and they're only gonna have one for a specific need at a time.

[21:33] And so once you lock that contract in,

[21:35] no one else can really compete for that core service for years.

[21:38] And then imagine five years later,

[21:40] well, you've already done this for five years.

[21:42] Is someone gonna spin up a company

[21:44] that didn't make all that money in that meantime?

[21:46] Doesn't have all the relationships

[21:47] and then get the next contract, probably not.

[21:50] That's why companies like Oracle, Lockheed Martin,

[21:52] are a good $1 billion company,

[21:53] because they basically just siphon off tax payer dollars

[21:56] and have locked those contracts in.

[21:58] The third is contracts over distribution.

[22:00] And so you've got the supply side,

[22:02] you've got the customer side,

[22:03] and then you've got reaching the customers,

[22:04] which is basically the middle between the two.

[22:06] And so if I have an exclusive contract to sell video games

[22:10] and the only retail distribution is game stunk, right?

[22:14] Then I can, unless there's other markets

[22:17] places for distribution,

[22:18] I can have a huge monopoly over everybody

[22:20] who walks into those stores.

[22:22] And so having exclusive contracts with distribution

[22:24] are ways of locking down markets.

[22:26] Well, I mean, I'll tell you, and obviously one.

[22:28] One of the classic examples of having massive distribution

[22:31] as a monopoly is Coca-Cola and Pepsi.

[22:33] And so they're the primary two players in the drink game.

[22:37] And the reason is, as soon as they can buy a company

[22:40] that gets some sort of market share

[22:41] because they actually have a good product,

[22:43] they can immediately drop it into their distribution base

[22:45] of every single restaurant, every single 7-11,

[22:48] every single Walmart, every single Walgreens,

[22:50] every single retail store,

[22:52] they already have the existing relationship,

[22:53] they already have the distribution.

[22:55] And so by having that locked in,

[22:57] they don't even have to really innovate.

[22:58] They just wait for the market to say,

[22:59] oh, this is a winner, they overpay the founder

[23:01] so that they get FU money.

[23:03] But they pay that guy 500 million bucks

[23:05] and they immediately take that thing

[23:06] and make it worth $5 billion.

[23:07] And if somewhere to try and compete with Coca-Cola,

[23:10] they'd have to have 100 years of sales

[23:13] and outbound teams establishing all of these connections.

[23:16] And the thing is that especially because Coca-Cola

[23:18] is in the physical world,

[23:19] like there's not a huge, like,

[23:22] you have to get the product to physical human beings.

[23:25] So having a physical distribution network

[23:28] gives them a huge competitive advantage.

[23:30] And this is just through contracts.

[23:32] They have these relationships,

[23:33] they have these agreements,

[23:34] and they're just already in place.

[23:35] And to the flip side, the people who are

[23:38] sat on the other end of the distribution agreements,

[23:40] if you don't carry Coca-Cola and Pepsi,

[23:42] people are like, what kind of Mickey Mouse thing

[23:44] you got going on here?

[23:45] Because they own the vast majority

[23:46] of the beverages that most people could see.

[23:48] And so when you're thinking about building your business,

[23:50] having these agreements where you can get access

[23:52] to distribution, increase the value of the company,

[23:54] and secures revenue, because you get to rely

[23:58] on all the marketing, each of these individual retailers

[24:00] do to get customers in to buy your product.

[24:02] And fundamentally, this is a B2B or B2B to C strategy.

[24:06] And if you don't know what that means,

[24:07] it's business to business or business to consumer.

[24:10] And so if you want to lock in one of these things

[24:11] in your smaller business, you have to make it worth it

[24:13] for the distributor.

[24:14] And so if they're picking between you and someone else,

[24:17] then you can say, hey, I will help you.

[24:18] I will sell you my product at a lower cost than other people,

[24:22] or I'll add in a whole retail kit that'll move more product

[24:25] for you, or I'll come out to your site

[24:27] and train your staff for free.

[24:28] You have to add other perks and incentives

[24:30] that more established players probably aren't willing to do,

[24:32] or don't need to do, so that you can get a foot in to the door.

[24:35] So number nine, huge capital requirements, meaning it takes

[24:39] a ton of money to just get into the business.

[24:41] And so that automatically knocks out 99.9% of business owners

[24:44] who aren't going to be able to raise a billion dollars

[24:47] on their first go.

[24:48] Now, Elon, for example, was able to do this with SpaceX

[24:51] because he's Elon and buy the way casually shot up hundreds

[24:56] of satellites in the space so that he could create starlink.

[24:59] And you have global coverage for internet.

[25:01] And there's other obvious examples of this.

[25:03] You got Exxon Mobile who has a huge capital to go,

[25:06] find search and then drill oil, or under water oil drilling.

[25:11] Like these crazy things that cause gazillions of dollars,

[25:13] that you're not like, hey, you know,

[25:14] I'm thinking about opening a dry cleaning store

[25:17] or an underwater oil rig.

[25:18] Right?

[25:19] It's a huge amount of capital, or even simply

[25:23] as simple to understand as developing a new drug,

[25:26] like a pharmaceutical.

[25:28] It takes a ton of time, a ton of money,

[25:31] a ton of regulation.

[25:32] There's multiple big things, and a ton of money

[25:34] because you have to run the whole thing for years

[25:37] out of loss, not being able to make a penny.

[25:40] And then the day that it gets legalized,

[25:42] then you print money for like 30 years.

[25:44] But it takes time and money in regulation

[25:46] and knowledge of regulation in order to even get to that point.

[25:49] And many failed drugs that don't work,

[25:51] which a lot of people don't talk about.

[25:53] And so if you don't have a huge stock pile of cash,

[25:56] you either got a raise it, or you got a not play,

[25:58] which means once you do win, it's hard for people to enter.

[26:01] Because even if you do figure out the hair loss,

[26:05] fixing drug, you're going to have a huge years and years

[26:07] of profits in advantage over somebody else

[26:09] who's going to what be the second player in that market years

[26:12] later.

[26:13] Right?

[26:14] And let's scale this down to small business.

[26:16] So it's easier to start a social media agency

[26:20] because it just requires skill, then starting

[26:22] a manufacturing plant, or starting a business

[26:25] where you have to buy capital equipment,

[26:27] so equipment in order to make the business work.

[26:30] And so basically the amount of capital that's required

[26:34] in order to start the business becomes a competitive

[26:37] advantage in it itself.

[26:38] And so if you have the ability to raise capital

[26:40] or even saving lots of money for yourself,

[26:42] you can automatically pick vehicles to start a business in

[26:46] that have fewer people competing against you.

[26:49] So you automatically shrink the pool.

[26:51] Number 10 is IP, intellectual property.

[26:53] Now this is one that I think is wildly understood,

[26:55] but you've got kind of two basic camps here.

[26:58] So you've got patents, copyright trademarks,

[27:00] which is basically like I own this information

[27:02] and no one else can use it.

[27:04] So a simple example of that is this book.

[27:05] Like someone else can't copy the contents of this book

[27:08] and then republish it and just put their name on it.

[27:10] It's illegal.

[27:11] And it's good that it's illegal

[27:12] because then people wouldn't spend the time to write a book

[27:15] if they knew that the moment it does well,

[27:17] some 100 other people can publish the same book.

[27:19] And same thing with like a cartoon character like Mickey Mouse,

[27:22] which by the way is expiring kind of students.

[27:24] That's kind of frightening for Disney.

[27:26] But they, you can own these patents for 70 or 100 years

[27:30] or whatever it is.

[27:30] And so you basically have an entire lifetime.

[27:32] And sometimes two lifetimes, they're able to create wealth

[27:36] with this one thing that obviously lots of people

[27:38] like if it's good.

[27:39] And after that point it becomes common.

[27:41] It means everybody can use it.

[27:43] And so we might find some very interesting Mickey Mouse,

[27:46] a pair of all and cartoons that start appearing

[27:49] after Disney's big ownership over that IP expires.

[27:54] Now the other version of this is trade secrets.

[27:55] And this one's really tough because it's really hard

[27:57] to enforce.

[27:58] It's really hard to keep secret because you have employees

[28:00] who learn trade secrets and then they can leave.

[28:02] And then it just becomes competitive practice.

[28:04] And so the thing is, like the classic one is Coca-Cola

[28:07] secret recipe for their drinks.

[28:09] And this is actually really common in flavoring

[28:11] because there's really unique recipes for like Red Bull

[28:14] and monster.

[28:15] And I think monster famously didn't own its own recipe

[28:18] from the person that was actually doing the manufacturing

[28:21] and had to pay like $500 million to just buy the rights

[28:25] to its own recipe from the people who made it in the beginning.

[28:28] Some crazy amount of money, somebody can fact check me.

[28:30] All right.

[28:31] And so the thing is is that, but if you're like,

[28:33] man, someone's using my offer, someone's using my ad,

[28:36] someone copied my content.

[28:37] That's not considered intellectual property, believe it or not.

[28:40] And so there's very strict guidelines which I won't get

[28:43] into about it.

[28:44] But if you do have a copyright, right?

[28:46] If you do have a trademark, which is like you can't use

[28:48] acquisition.com, right?

[28:50] You can't pretend it's your business.

[28:52] And the key word, I think, for knowing

[28:54] whether it's Red Wrong is pretending like it's yours.

[28:57] You can't pretend that you wrote this book.

[28:58] You can't pretend that you an acquisition.com.

[29:00] You can't pretend to represent something that you're not,

[29:02] which is what this protects.

[29:04] And so this gives you the business owner,

[29:08] the opportunity to spend more resources, more time building

[29:11] things of value because you know they're going to be protected.

[29:13] And if I ever wanted to sell the rights to my book,

[29:16] I would be able to sell it for probably close to $100 million

[29:20] based on the revenue that this book brings in

[29:22] and just continues to make money.

[29:24] And these types of businesses set themselves up for things

[29:27] called royalties.

[29:28] And so Oreo, for example, and to bisco,

[29:31] set up lots of different royalties with like supplement

[29:34] sellers.

[29:35] She want to say this is Oreo flavored or ice cream dealers.

[29:38] She want to have Oreo, real Oreo flavoring.

[29:40] So if you want to use the Oreo recipe

[29:42] and the Oreo logo on your products, they say, sure,

[29:45] you can use it.

[29:45] You just have to give us 8% of revenue of whatever you do.

[29:48] And so there's also a really strong strategy of saying, hey,

[29:51] I'm going to just lean into this.

[29:53] I'm going to go get 10 different big brands to license me

[29:56] their brands.

[29:57] I'm going to pay them the royalty.

[29:58] But I'm going to piggyback on 20 years of branding

[30:02] and marketing that they spent gazillions of dollars on.

[30:04] So you can start small businesses.

[30:06] A mutual acquaintance of mine started his supplement company,

[30:09] just taking all these premium brands like Swedish fish

[30:12] and sour patch kids and making them in a supplement line

[30:15] that people immediately recognize.

[30:16] So you got to benefit from that brand recognition

[30:18] and already a flavor that people loved and knew,

[30:21] even though he was a small business.

[30:23] Number 11 is acquisitions and mergers.

[30:25] And you're like, how do you destroy your competition

[30:26] through acquisition mergers?

[30:27] Well, you kind of don't.

[30:28] You kind of just assimilate your competition.

[30:31] And so this one is a darling of the private equity world

[30:35] and basically the world that I live in as a investor, which

[30:37] is, hey, we've got three companies that are all competing

[30:41] for the same market.

[30:42] Well, what if we just buy them all and put them under one?

[30:44] Well, now we control the entire marketplace.

[30:46] And so the government seeks to break these things

[30:48] up once they get really, really big.

[30:50] But the problem is it gets really hard when a company

[30:52] is really big because they know how to defend themselves.

[30:54] And so Facebook, for example, Meta has acquired

[30:57] number of companies like Instagram and WhatsApp

[31:00] to consolidate its position.

[31:01] They added messenger in.

[31:03] And so they have all these things.

[31:04] And they've been prevented at this point from buying

[31:06] anymore because they don't want one company owning

[31:09] all of the digital media.

[31:10] And I think rightfully so.

[31:12] But that is a way that you can develop a monopoly.

[31:16] And so when you're thinking about acquisitions and merges,

[31:18] you're really just thinking about market segments.

[31:20] Or like I was saying earlier, so this one basically

[31:22] umbrellas on top of any of the others.

[31:24] So you can do private equity.

[31:25] So you can do acquisitions, for example,

[31:27] and acquire all of the things in the supply chains.

[31:29] So you basically use outside capital to acquire

[31:32] the entire supply chain and vertically integrate.

[31:34] Or you acquire all of your competitors

[31:36] in your chief economies of scale.

[31:37] Or you acquire the distribution and the exclusive contracts

[31:40] and then you create a closed loop.

[31:42] And so you basically use capital

[31:44] and taking existing resources and assets.

[31:47] And so I had a company yesterday was talking about this.

[31:50] And they were like, hey, I'm having this problem

[31:52] because this company is doing about $60 million a year.

[31:54] It's a roofing business.

[31:55] He was like, I buy all my leads from this online lead source

[31:59] and then the biggest lead source in the US

[32:01] and I'm their biggest buyer.

[32:03] I was like, okay, cool.

[32:04] So what's the problem?

[32:05] Is it what I'm having trouble scaling beyond them?

[32:07] I was like, okay, well, there's two ways you can do it.

[32:09] You either buy it or you build it.

[32:10] And my recommendation to him was,

[32:12] hey, go find five small agencies that sell

[32:16] to roofers exclusively and sell paper lead

[32:19] and rather than buy the leads by the company.

[32:22] Because he had the capital to do it.

[32:23] And so if he buys one, two or three of the businesses,

[32:26] he can then own another chunk of his budget.

[32:29] So he owns all of the media assets that create the leads

[32:32] and he owns the roofing company

[32:34] that can create the roofs.

[32:36] And then what was the next thing you would buy?

[32:37] He'd probably buy the financing company

[32:38] that finances the roofs and he'd make points on that.

[32:41] And so the more you eat up of this,

[32:43] which you can do through acquisitions and mergers,

[32:45] the more of a competitive advantage you have,

[32:46] the more valuable the company.

[32:48] And so what's interesting is that small businesses

[32:50] get spawned, stay small through competition,

[32:52] but big businesses think about consolidation.

[32:56] And so you could see five business owners

[32:59] who are all neck and neck in a local market.

[33:01] But the funny thing is that one guy sells private equity

[33:03] and then private equity buys the other five

[33:04] and just owns them all.

[33:05] And it just seems like this silly squabble.

[33:08] And so if you can work together to create

[33:10] a much bigger enterprise,

[33:12] the sum of the whole is greater than the individual parts.

[33:15] And this is very true when it comes to equity value

[33:17] and a business.

[33:18] And so if you seek to create a more valuable enterprise,

[33:22] don't think from the competitive lens,

[33:23] think like, how do I eat up things that would cause risk

[33:26] to my business?

[33:27] And so that's looking at distribution,

[33:29] looking at customer bases, looking at media assets,

[33:32] looking at all different components.

[33:34] So you could say, hey, is there a way

[33:35] that we can work together rather than compete

[33:36] so that we can just become a much bigger thing

[33:38] and then owner stronger position in the market?

[33:40] Which then gives us some of these downstream things

[33:41] we've economy's of scale.

[33:42] We've a stronger brand.

[33:44] All of these competitive modes that you then position yourself

[33:47] to destroy competition.

[33:48] And so me personally, and this is something

[33:50] that should be way too long to learn about business

[33:51] is that rather own 20% of a billion dollar company

[33:55] than a hundred percent of a million dollar company.

[33:57] And one of the classic examples you probably have heard of

[33:59] because you've probably seen their big green trash bins

[34:01] is waste management.

[34:02] Which you may not know this, but the owner of,

[34:05] but the founder of waste management

[34:07] didn't even like start a business.

[34:09] He just bought waste management routes

[34:12] and he kept buying them over and over and over again.

[34:15] And so he saw was a very fragmented market

[34:17] of mom and pop shops that he saw weight.

[34:19] If I added all of these routes together,

[34:21] I would have huge economies of scale

[34:23] and then I would own the entire network of waste,

[34:25] which is more or less what he did.

[34:27] And so he grew the entire company through acquisitions

[34:30] until he became a multi-billionaire

[34:32] and had a big public company which we now know

[34:34] as waste management.

[34:36] And so if you're a small business owner,

[34:38] you can just think about that exact strategy

[34:40] that waste management did,

[34:41] which is if you are, let's say a pool cleaner,

[34:44] or you own lawn care company,

[34:46] then you can look at all the other lawn cares

[34:48] in your local marketplace and say,

[34:49] okay, well, what if I owned all of these?

[34:51] And you just focus on your local city.

[34:52] And if you own them, you're gonna have huge advantages.

[34:55] It's gonna be harder for people to come in and compete

[34:56] against you.

[34:57] You have the relationships, you have economies of scale.

[34:59] You have more efficient routes

[35:00] because you have your houses are closer together.

[35:02] And this happens with lots of home maintenance type of businesses.

[35:05] And the thing is is that right now,

[35:06] this is a huge private equity interest

[35:08] of there's tons of M&A activities happening here

[35:10] because they're seeing the same thing that's right there,

[35:12] which is wow.

[35:13] These guys are all really fragmented.

[35:14] Instead of competing, if we consolidated,

[35:16] we make a much more viable thing.

[35:18] So number 12 is one of my favorite personally.

[35:22] And so one of my big saying is,

[35:24] find what everyone wants, make it better,

[35:27] and give it away for free,

[35:28] and step four, monetize another way.

[35:30] So it's having an innovative business model.

[35:32] So a lot of people talk about this

[35:33] and disrupting marketplace.

[35:34] And so you take stuff that other people

[35:37] are currently selling at a profit,

[35:39] and you just give it away for free.

[35:41] And so Google, for example, with Google Docs,

[35:43] Google Sheets, Google Slides,

[35:45] to try and disrupt Microsoft or eat up some of its market share,

[35:49] they offered essentially the same software for free.

[35:52] And add it some features that made it even easier

[35:54] for people to work together if they were already on Google.

[35:56] So fundamentally, many of these models exist

[35:58] on premium concepts,

[36:00] which is I give something for free

[36:01] that you continue to use,

[36:02] and I put all of my effort on ascending people

[36:05] from free to paid.

[36:07] And so it's actually a marketing strategy.

[36:09] And so your cost to acquire a customer

[36:12] is the cost to deliver a customer,

[36:15] divided by your conversion rate.

[36:17] So if it costs me a penny to service a free customer,

[36:20] and I convert one out of 100 free customers

[36:23] into paid customers,

[36:25] then my cost to acquire a customer is a dollar.

[36:27] And so you would actually take all of what would normally

[36:29] be a marketing budget,

[36:30] and you put it into delivering the free thing,

[36:32] and make sure that that free thing is so good,

[36:35] that the word of mouth marketing on its own,

[36:36] because it's free, then generates more demand

[36:39] that you then just take the cost basis of delivering

[36:42] the free thing, and that becomes your marketing spend.

[36:44] And this is really common in disruptive businesses,

[36:47] because that is their competitive advantage.

[36:49] That's what makes them difficult compete with,

[36:50] because other people in their marketplace,

[36:52] that's their core business.

[36:53] And then you're just giving it away for free,

[36:55] because you found out another way to monetize.

[36:57] So Spotify, for example, did a great job with this,

[36:59] where they made free music for everybody,

[37:02] because they licensed, they made all these agreements.

[37:04] And so you can listen to whatever songs you want on demand,

[37:06] as long as you're willing to listen to,

[37:08] like Jesus, as long as you're willing to listen to ads.

[37:11] And if you don't want to listen to the ads, you can pay them.

[37:13] Today, they do a refresher with musicians.

[37:15] We can get into whether it's ethical, how much they pay them or not,

[37:17] but that's not the point of this video.

[37:19] The point is that they had an innovative model

[37:21] that disrupted that industry.

[37:22] But you're like, okay, these are some massive things,

[37:24] but is there something that I can do on a smaller scale?

[37:27] Well, the answer is yes.

[37:29] You just have to do the math.

[37:30] And so for example, I had a concept that we tested out

[37:34] at a gym, it didn't work, but I can still explain it to you,

[37:37] is that I had a meals company called Prestige Meals,

[37:39] and I also had a sub-income company, Prestige Labs,

[37:42] and I knew gyms.

[37:43] And so in one of our test kitchens, I said,

[37:45] hey, what if we told people that if they were on our meals,

[37:49] they could get the gym membership for free?

[37:52] And so we marketed free gym forever,

[37:56] because the whole stick was,

[37:58] if you eat the right foods when you're not here,

[38:00] the results are gonna get in here,

[38:01] are gonna be massively amplified.

[38:03] Now, the difficulty that we had,

[38:04] and I think if I worked at it a little bit longer,

[38:06] I then was like, this is a little bit of distraction,

[38:08] because I was getting way too into,

[38:09] like, trying to innovate this business model,

[38:11] but fundamentally that's how it worked.

[38:12] It's just, okay, well, I have a capital cost for the gym,

[38:15] but once I incur that, the additional users isn't that much

[38:19] to take on in terms of price.

[38:21] And so I'm willing to give this thing away

[38:22] for free that other people charge for, as long as,

[38:25] they buy this other revenue stream

[38:26] that has more profit or has more income.

[38:28] And so that's how I think about pairing different services

[38:31] together where you just take a very cheap service

[38:34] that a lot of people want.

[38:35] Even if you go from $20 to zero, it's still free,

[38:38] and free gets 10 times the interest of not free.

[38:41] And so that then allows you to generate the demand

[38:44] for your much more valuable service

[38:45] that you can sell it a higher altruity.

[38:46] I'll give you another version of this,

[38:48] if that I would test out.

[38:49] So if I had a large facility, right,

[38:53] I might say you have to, you can come to my facility

[38:56] and you can use your free, you have to do these rules

[38:58] and I can kick you out.

[38:59] So that would control some of the riff raf, for example.

[39:01] But by doing that, I would use my gym as my free lead magnet

[39:04] to get people in the door, and then what would I do

[39:06] in there in the door?

[39:07] Well, they got to sit down with us to do an onboarding consultation,

[39:09] which we would sell personal training at.

[39:11] And so it's like, I can give the whole gym membership away

[39:13] for free if you just buy personal training,

[39:15] knowing that only one out of five people are gonna buy it.

[39:18] And that's fine because I didn't pay for the customers

[39:20] and I'm making all my profit here.

[39:21] So as long as my profit and my personal training

[39:24] covers the cost of maintaining the facility

[39:26] and I can still net a profit, then I have a good

[39:29] and very innovative business model.

[39:30] Number 13 is control over distribution channels.

[39:32] Now you might be like, this is really similar

[39:34] to contracts with distribution, and it is kind of

[39:36] accepted way more valuable.

[39:38] Because contracts, at some point, they can break them.

[39:42] Like all of the vendors over and I could say,

[39:43] you know what, cool, cool, we don't want you.

[39:44] Now is that likely?

[39:45] No.

[39:46] But if you have absolute control and ownership over distribution,

[39:49] you also can profit from everyone else's business.

[39:51] Two.

[39:52] And so Amazon, for example, owns a distribution monopoly.

[39:56] They have access to everybody in the United States.

[39:59] They're the most widely adopted product,

[40:01] which is Amazon Prime in the United States in total.

[40:04] And that's how they can get you things in two hours, right?

[40:07] Which is crazy.

[40:08] And they had the warehouse network built out first.

[40:12] And they were putting so much strain on the US Postal Service

[40:15] and UPS that they're like, well, we're just gonna start

[40:18] Amazon, it's delivery.

[40:19] And now Amazon is delivery.

[40:20] As you see, the Amazon trucks everywhere,

[40:21] where they just have their own people that

[40:23] and their own vans that do all the deliveries for them.

[40:25] And so Amazon, because they have access to everyone's front door

[40:29] step, if you wanna sell a product in the Amazon,

[40:31] you pay Amazon two thirds or half of the revenue,

[40:35] which is absurd, but it's also why Amazon's revenue

[40:37] is like a good deal in dollars a year.

[40:39] How do you chunk this down so you're not Amazon,

[40:41] you're like, how do I make this work for me?

[40:43] So I would say, on a smaller scale,

[40:45] you have local distribution.

[40:47] So you can create distribution centers in a local area

[40:49] and you just slowly expand outwards,

[40:51] because in that city, in that tiny area, you're the best.

[40:54] Now, the other version of this is that you get

[40:57] really good distribution on a specific market segment.

[41:00] So if I have every single CEO in America

[41:04] and I know them all first name basis,

[41:07] then if I wanna sell private jets,

[41:09] I probably will have a good job doing it.

[41:12] And so just think about it as means of communicating

[41:14] or means of delivering messages or products,

[41:17] two customers that you have complete control over.

[41:19] Now, I don't own those CEOs,

[41:21] but somebody might own those relationships, right?

[41:23] And so the idea is, as much of that

[41:26] is that you can have complete control over

[41:27] creates a competitive mode.

[41:29] Now, I wanna zoom out.

[41:30] We talked about 13 different things here.

[41:34] The chunked up version of this is the actual word monopoly.

[41:39] And it comes from the Greek mono, meaning one,

[41:42] and policed, meaning to sell,

[41:43] meaning only one person can sell.

[41:46] And so there are 13 ways that I just outlined,

[41:49] we're only one competitor can sell.

[41:51] And that could be because they control the supply,

[41:53] they control the demand, they control the media,

[41:55] that talks to those people,

[41:57] they control the technology that prevents other people

[41:59] from getting into it.

[41:59] It just costs a ton of money, get into the business.

[42:01] They have some sort of grant or license that says

[42:04] that only they can do it.

[42:05] So there's all these different ways,

[42:07] but fundamentally, it's finding a way that no one else can enter.

[42:10] And as much as monopolies are quote,

[42:13] frowned upon in the government,

[42:14] they don't do very much to break them up.

[42:17] And this is how Bill Gates and John D. Rockefeller

[42:20] created life-changing wealth.

[42:22] But you can create life-changing wealth

[42:23] and not necessarily become a billionaire.

[42:25] You just create a small network of a very small niche

[42:27] that you own.

[42:28] And by doing that, you can take steps

[42:30] and weave one of these 13 strategies

[42:32] into the DNA of your company

[42:33] to make it more competitive and ultimately make more money.

[42:36] And I told you, number six, my favorite was brand,

[42:39] and how to build a brand.

[42:40] And I actually made an entire keynote

[42:41] that doesn't require any money

[42:43] and only skill to understand and deploy in your business.

[42:46] So go check it out.

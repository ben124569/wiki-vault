[00:00] In this video, I'm going to tell you the number one way to increase the percentage of sales that get closed by you and your team through a systematic process.

[00:08] And if you don't know why I'm on Amazon, I would ask was it's not calm. It's portfolio of service, coaching, e-learning, info businesses that do about $85 million a year.

[00:16] And so the reason I want to make this is years ago, I was recruited to bring in our to be brought in and flown in for a sales consultant gig, which I don't do and it was years ago.

[00:27] But the team was selling mortgage leads. And so they wanted me to do is the first half of the day I took apart the the actual sales script and rescript everything kind of reframe the offer all that kind of stuff.

[00:37] And the second half of the day I was supposed to train the team. And so after spending the first half on that talking to the founders on like I'm stuff, the second half they had a nine person team and they were selling mortgage leads.

[00:45] And when I walked in, the first thing that I asked the team was, hey, and they were like, hey, this guy John's been kind of a problem. I was like, okay cool. I was like, hey John, how good are the leads?

[00:55] Whole teams there. It's quiet. Ever like pressure zone John. He's like, well, I mean there and I was like, I'm good. Thanks so much.

[01:03] And everyone was like, what is happening? I was like, dude, I can give you the best script in the world. I was like, but if you don't believe in the product, I was like, none of this is going to matter.

[01:11] I said, if you believed in the leads, I was like, you wouldn't even need the script because if you were to ask me the same question and I truly believe that these leads were amazing, I would be like, dude, these leads are sick.

[01:22] I mean, right now my cousin is a realtor and I'm sending her leads right now because she's already building so much of a pipeline from it. I'm actually studying for a realtor exam so that I can, so I can buy these leads from this company and not even sell these but sell houses instead.

[01:35] Right? Cause houses have a big, bigger ticket than these leads do. And so for me, like, I'm just basically waiting to get through to that point so that I can move out on my own. But yeah, I mean these leads are awesome. So the way that you talk about the products that you have will indicate the level of conviction that you have.

[01:50] And the best sales people are true believers. And that's why a lot of great salesmen come from clients who've used the products and services if it makes sense for them, you know, for their life and whatnot.

[02:01] And so people will believe, like, if you think about sales really is, it's a transference of conviction. And so you've got some person who doesn't believe, one person who does believe and trust is what completes the transfer.

[02:14] And you have to duplicate the conviction in this person and this person. And so if a sales person doesn't believe in the product, they have no way to transfer the conviction because they've no baseline of conviction to work off.

[02:25] And a different version of this happens when people start hot, they do really well. And all of a sudden they start not selling as well.

[02:32] It's not because they don't know how to sell. And training is not the thing that's going to fix the problem because they're already closing before.

[02:38] And they're not closing now. I mean, they've changed something. And oftentimes it's because they've heard something from one of the prospects that they sold that something was not good.

[02:47] And so the way to prevent this and to actively increase conviction, which is what's going to change the way they say the words on the script is by actively having a process to make them believe.

[02:58] And so obviously the way to make a believe is to actually have a good product, but in terms of systematizing them, it's having a regular cadence between customer success and sales.

[03:07] So this is me getting a little bit operational with you, but this is how it works. You meet weekly and you have both teams on and the people from customer success share the wins of the clients who are going through the program.

[03:17] That's not a weekly basis. It's a long form format. It also serves as a way for them to talk back and forth to each other. The sales team can see what's happening on the customer success size.

[03:25] I can see what's happening on the sales side. And you create cross departmental knowledge, which is really useful because the sales team knows not to say some things because people are misunderstanding them.

[03:34] And the success team is giving the sales team ammunition for the things that they know that they're doing to deliver that makes them more convicted on top of that.

[03:41] You should have a pipeline that is established for customers where you can collect testimonials and reviews.

[03:47] And what you do is in the best case scenario, you have that client hop on with the sales team and explain their story.

[03:53] And I can tell you this because me first hand, one of the things that I realized when I looked at our stats was that on Saturdays and particular Saturdays, we were closing like 100% of people walking the door and I was like, huh, what's different about these days at my facilities versus the days that we're not, you know, we're closing a normal moment.

[04:09] And it turned out that those days were the days that we would actually do the way out for our program.

[04:14] And we were finished there six weeks or their 12 weeks or whatever it was. And we would do all the way out to the same day.

[04:19] And so it's kind of like a graduation ceremony. So everyone steps on their cry and they're losing weight. They feel amazing.

[04:24] But all of my team was there. And so when we had sales consoles that were that morning or throughout the graduation day or right after the graduation wants all fresh in their mind.

[04:34] They would when someone walk in, it's like the sales took half as long because the belief and the conviction was so strong in the salesman.

[04:41] It overcame the fears and the doubts of the prospect, right? And so in a lot of ways you have to compensate for lack of conviction with training and, you know, learning logical base frameworks and learning how to have excellent conversation, right, that that help people make decisions.

[04:58] But if you truly believe in if you think about how we buy things as prospects, we buy these things because somebody recommends them.

[05:05] And we believe the person like think about an organic buying process, right? Someone says, hey, do you have you going to that same much of it's awesome?

[05:12] Like, go like, well, great. I'm going to go there, right? Like, why would I not? And so the closer you can have the trust so that when you make the recommendation, it's like having a referral, the person will believe you because the way you're saying it is believe a ball.

[05:26] And the way to make it believable is to actually believe it. And so having a structured process of increasing the conviction of the sales team is a way to massively increase the closing person, inches of your team, not based on skill, but based on heart.

[05:41] And so if you can bridge that gap between the customer success and the sales team and you can do that both internally and externally internally because you have processes, externally because you get those customers on the calls to think you hear the stories.

[05:52] But also you and the sales directors can read those testimonials every single day to them in the morning. And I like that because it sets the cadence for the day because it reminds us why we do what we do on a regular basis. Why am I taking these calls? Why am I knocking on these doors? Why am I setting up shop and collecting leads at the whole food so that I can so we can make sales later? Why am I doing this? I'm doing this so that I can be a part of this transformation, these people are going through as a result of whatever products and services we sell.

[06:21] And so the sales team probably more like customer support and sales. I feel like are very similar in that they get beat up all day long.

[06:29] And sales people especially and so this is for the founders and the CEOs are going out there and they're fighting for you every single day. They're the front line in my opinion.

[06:37] They're the offensive line of the team. They're just pushing their in the in the trenches moving the ball forward.

[06:43] Every you know one two yards at a time they're chipping away at it and let's see if I can get this camera back and they're pushing your products forward every single day on your behalf.

[06:53] And so the biggest thing that assails director and if you were the sales director because your business is smaller is that you have to breathe conviction into them because their conviction can wane over time.

[07:03] And it's a cup that has to be refilled because it's that conviction that they're spreading to all the prospects and the thing is the prospects are spreading doubt into them.

[07:11] And so you have to fill it up from your side so that they can become diluted and then get refilled right which is why a good sales person comes in. They can crush and almost suddenly start going down. It's not because of skill because they already had this skill. So you know how to they already knew how to close and they came in. The problem was their mojo is off.

[07:26] Mojo mojo mojo mojo.

[07:30] And so this video is fundamentally about fixing mojo with an assails team which is just getting them to believe and reminding them to believe which is why the one of the biggest saying is having sales is we need to be reminded more than we need to be

[07:40] taught people who believe in something automatically sell it and I'll give you a final final example to drive this point home. I'll just use the the Christian community overall.

[07:49] I really just any kind of religious community in general. A big part of most faith is spreading the faith and you can tell when someone truly believes the faith they're on fire with the face because they they truly believe it.

[08:02] And it's not like people go through sales training right to bring people to faith. They just truly believe in it and if you've ever been around someone who has absolute conviction because conviction and this is a key point is not.

[08:17] Do you believe in the product? Do you not believe in the product? But to what extent do you believe in the product? How much and how deeply do you believe that is the predictor of your ability to close a massive predictor of your ability to close which is why so many founders are always some of the best promoters.

[08:31] For their businesses because they believe in it more than everyone else and they should be but you can duplicate that ability in getting other people to believe by having a process in place to do so and understanding that the training the blocking tackling in terms of like say this and that say this in that sure it's important to have those their tools right their tools that you have in your tool about but the fundamental work ethic that someone will fight and their desire to actually help someone is the difference between them thinking about themselves so they can get their commission check and then they're going to be the best thing to do is to do that.

[09:00] And then thinking about the prospect and how this person is missing out on something that's genuinely going to help them and really transform their life and really solve the problems that they have and they will fight for the sale so much longer because they genuinely want this person to win because they genuinely believe that your products and services are actually going to help them.

[09:17] And so bridging that gap and understanding this for myself was so important because a lot of times we get obsessed with the drills and all of a sudden you have to do that stuff for sure you have to drill you have to understand how to say the words and all that kind of stuff.

[09:28] But the heart if you can change the heart and you can depth it right because it's not just like I said it's not just do they believe but how deeply convicted can I get this team to be and that is where having proof or you're actively selling your sales team that is where you'll get the outsized returns in my opinion on increasing the effectiveness of the team is they truly and deeply to their core believe and the last point that I was making is if you've ever been around someone who truly believes in something and it's like kind of

[09:58] insane by whatever the thing is like it could be aliens, it could be whatever right but like something crazy but they're like so sold on it.

[10:05] There's an element of yourself that wonders if you're right because you have conviction too in whatever you believe and so you see their depth of conviction

[10:14] their depth of faith in the thing that they have concluded and the deeper it is the more you start to question your own beliefs which is why the pastors of huge churches

[10:25] typically have deep deep faith and if like there's a lot to study in terms of converting people literally because you're changing someone's entire world view

[10:33] and so if you study the process that people come to faith and how they convince others to come to faiths in general

[10:39] there's a lot of elements of selling that occur there in helping people make decisions to help themselves and so the person who typically does the converting

[10:48] can never believe less in the thing that they're trying to convert someone into than the person who's being converted the person has to believe in

[10:55] your conviction more than they believe in their doubt and the story that they have been telling themselves and so the skills are simply a way to clearly

[11:03] communicate and build trust so that your conviction can be transferred but it starts with having the conviction to begin with in order to initiate the transfer over the

[11:14] bridge of trust and so this is the number one thing that I see missing from sales trainings and it's one of the easiest things that we can do to implement in a team or even in yourself to improve your numbers overall in your business

[11:24] all right and if you don't know I am I probably said it earlier if I didn't my name is oxymosy we don't have position calm

[11:28] portfolio services info coaching course businesses that do about $85 million a year and so I make these videos because I struggle a lot coming up and I just if I if there's any lessons that I can share

[11:39] I prefer that my pain not have been in vain all right so I still have to go see you guys next video bye

[00:00] In this video, I want to talk to you about the tax strategies of the ultra-walthy, and as someone who is ultra-walthy, I find it ironic that the vast majority of videos that I see on YouTube are made by people who are not ultra-walthy talking about how the ultra-walthy do things when they have no transparency into what their actions actually are.

[00:15] I have gone through, I've spent probably $750,000 on different tax advisors, different tax strategies, to try and figure out at least the US system to minimize tax drag.

[00:26] The conclusions that I have are somewhat simple, and I want to share this with you so I can hopefully help you avoid a lot of the headaches and pain that I had to go through in this process.

[00:36] For context, in the last three years, I spent $18 million paid $18 million in taxes to the US government.

[00:44] I'm happily done so, Uncle Sam, but what I want to do is, rather than talk about the little KDBD hacks, I want to shift your perspective around them because,

[00:51] as I looked into many, many of these things that are touted as tax strategies, most of the times they are just tiny little BBs that do not make a significant difference.

[01:00] If I can shift your perspective around this and get you to think the way the ultra-walthy thing about taxes, then I think that'll make a bigger difference in your life than anything else.

[01:07] Right off the bat, the first thing is, where you live is going to make the biggest initial difference.

[01:12] First off, at a state level, where you live is going to, you can have a zero tax date versus California as a 15 or 16% tax date, plus all the other taxes they tack on everything else you do.

[01:23] The first thing to do is you can live into living a lower tax date.

[01:27] The second level of this is what country you live in.

[01:30] If you are a US resident, you suffer from global taxation, meaning it doesn't matter where you live, they're going to tax you.

[01:37] And so there's only two ways to get around federal tax.

[01:41] The first is to live in Puerto Rico six months of the year at export services from Puerto Rico.

[01:47] If that is, you can do that, it's a 4% federal tax rate.

[01:50] So you can have zero percent state, 4% federal, and live there.

[01:53] It's 100% legit, it is legal to do that.

[01:55] The other way to do it is to expatriate, meaning you stop becoming a US resident, you renounce your citizenship as a US citizen, and then you come back basically as an alien.

[02:03] The way that you do that is you can become a citizen by investment, you spend a million dollars in investment into the US, and then you get basically a golden visa which means you pay for it.

[02:12] And again, though, you have to be here less than, you know, six months of the year, otherwise you then become a US tax resident, and even if you're not a US citizen.

[02:21] So the big conclusion here is in the beginning, you know, get out of the states that are, you know, the high tax days move to a state that is lower tax.

[02:29] But what I want to do is shift your perspective around this overall, big picture, because if you look at how your wealth will come out, and again, this is why I said this is tax rate of the ultra wealthy, vast majority of your net worth is going to come from growth, not the contributions.

[02:44] Okay, and so if you've clung your money into your, which you're, which you're over time calculator, you can Google when they're all over the place.

[02:50] You'll be able to see that the vast majority of your net worth over time is going to come from the growth of the assets that are in it, not from the contributions.

[02:58] And it comes mostly from starting earlier. And so that is why I'm such a big proponent of living on absolutely nothing for as long as you're impossible, so that you can, so you can start using the compounding interest of time to your advantage.

[03:08] And for perspective for everyone who's listening to this, don't think right now, I can only put $500 a month aside, it's not going to make a big difference.

[03:15] The thing is, is that $500 a month when you are 20 will make a bigger difference than $5,000 a month when you're a 45.

[03:21] So think about that for perspective.

[03:23] All right, the dollars now count 10 times more than the dollars and 10 years, and so forth. Okay, so that's a more, the second thing that the ultra wealthy, in terms of tax considerations is that they think differently about how they buy.

[03:36] So for example, if I buy something that's worth a $100 for $30, I instantly tripled by money, except I didn't pay tax on that tripling, right?

[03:42] Because the value of what I've purchased is worth three times more than what I paid for it.

[03:46] But the beauty of this is that I get that gain without having to pay taxes on it, and then it continues to grow and compound again without taxation.

[03:53] And so the vast majority of wealthy people understand this and they structure their life and their investments in that way, which leads me to the third day, which is how slash if you sell it.

[04:03] So the only reason that the tax rate is going to matter to you is if you pay capital gains, and that means that you've chosen to sell.

[04:10] But there are a lot of strategies around buying and holding. You look at more and buff it. He's held piece held seize candy for how 30 something years or 40 something years. Same thing with Coca Cola, right?

[04:20] Same thing with Guyco, who continues to buy things and hold them because he realizes that the tax treatment is going to be so efficient if you buy correctly.

[04:28] And so the goal is to think from the perspective of not I'm going to buy and try and flip this. I'm going to hold this for five years or this company looks good for this month.

[04:35] It's do I think that this thing is going to last for a very long time. And if so, I will get this proportion of returns by buying safe and buy something that's going to be here in 30 years, then trying to buy something sexy now.

[04:46] And so if you can understand that then you buy things to hold them for the long term because the biggest shift in perspective, the ultra-worthy half versus the not wealthy, is that they think in longer time horizons.

[04:55] They think about generational wealth. They don't think about what I'm going to pay for this month, a half-can buy a car or whatever.

[05:00] And it's not easy stuff that leads naturally to the fancy stuff which is like, well if I'm buying all these things, how am I going to live my life later?

[05:05] Good question. Well, the cool thing about how the US tax code works is that loans are never treated as income, but they are spendable money that you can consume and use.

[05:15] And so for example, if I continue to plow all of my money into assets that are well-isolated, which is the definition of wealth that I gave you on my other videos,

[05:23] if they continue to grow and they are growing tax-free, then the growth that is tax-free, I can realize by taking loans against those things.

[05:31] And I can use those loans to live my life. And as long as the loans that I'm taking are less than the growth of my assets, then I can use all of that growth, continue to let it compound tax-free for the rest of my life,

[05:42] and live off the loans in one idea that they can rectify my account. And so these are the strategies that the people who are ultra-worthy.

[05:49] The things when they talk about conservation easements, which is a basic view done in Atlanta, and you get the full value, and even though you didn't pay the full value, it's a BB, right?

[05:56] You're not going to be able to put your entire income against that. You know, captive insurance. I've got a friend of mine who was like,

[06:02] Dude, do this thing with me and it's said, and for me, it ended up saying it was going to save like 200-500 years, which honestly doesn't make a big dent for me.

[06:08] And it wasn't really worth the hassle. So I was like, I don't know, it's supposed to little fishy.

[06:11] Guess what happened? The IRS ended up flipping their ruling on it, saw people taking advantage of it, and then they back-back charged people with interest in fees.

[06:20] Right? And so the thing is, is that the US tax code is not fair, because the government can change something else whenever they want.

[06:25] They can say, you know what, we can change this rule this year, and we're going to back-text people three years. Then can do that, because they have complete controllers, I think we can do about it.

[06:31] Right? I like to think about it, just like I think about content on any kind of platform, is that I just have to align within the rules that exist.

[06:38] And long-term, if I don't sell anything, I'm not going to get taxed on it. And so the idea, long-term is, live for less than I, you know, for as low as I possibly can, if you like island living, then by only going live on an island, if you, if you so choose, for me, I choose and not to do the Puerto Rico thing, because the difference in net worth for me makes no difference in my life.

[06:59] And so I'm going to have a million students to have a hundred million dollars and a hundred and eighty million dollars to me makes no difference. And so I got into this game, because I wanted to have used money to have freedom to do X, Y, and Z, right? To live where I wanted to live, to do what I wanted to do with whom I wanted to do it, right?

[07:15] And so if that is the goal of what the money is going to afford me, I can't put the money above the freedom. And so if I have to remain prisoner of an island for six months to the year in order to get my better income tax rate, right?

[07:28] Then it seems like it's putting the car before the worst from it. I'm relinquishing the original objective I had and making the path of the vehicle the objective rather than realizing that money in it of itself has no value. It only has value in so far as it allows me to do things that I want to do.

[07:42] And so if I'm forgetting that, which many of us do because the game is so enticing, then I think that that is what makes that more recent. A lot of people are in a rationalizing, no, I love island living, but I'll tell you what the reason that they give you that 4% is because it's not that same.

[07:55] So for me, I think the easy thing, me living in Texas versus California, the living lifestyle is the same for me, but I pay less to fewer taxes. Worth it, makes sense to me.

[08:05] I'm living in Puerto Rico, I'm relinquishing a lot of freedoms there and I have to be there six plus months of the year and for me that's very difficult with outages and to basically know stores that are interesting and not a lot to do.

[08:16] I'm not going to give up the half of my life literally so that I can get half more money on my network because as much as people are like, well that 40% is going to come out.

[08:24] So it's the other 60. And so again, I think it makes sense if you are smaller and you're starting out and you're trying to develop your network.

[08:31] But I can tell you right now the vast majority of your worth is going to come from the growth and none of that has to be taxed.

[08:35] And so if you play the game the right way, which the way the ultra wealthy clay, they're not trying to think of it all these little hacks and codes that you see on the internet here.

[08:42] It's really bad making sure that you understand the big rocks correctly, which is by low immediately get value on your money for buying for less than what some things worth.

[08:50] When you sell it or don't sell it at all, you can continue to take loans against the increased value of the assets and you can live off this with this your life if you so choose.

[08:59] And so these are the tax strategies that the ultra wealthy from someone who actually is ultra wealthy. I hope you found value in this video. Click subscribe and I'll see you in the next video. Bye.

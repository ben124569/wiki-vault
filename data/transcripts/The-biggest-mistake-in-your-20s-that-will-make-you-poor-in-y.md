[00:00] In this video, I'm going to break down one of the stories that impacted my life, the most, and hopefully how you can learn from it.

[00:06] So, I wasn't that great of a person when I graduated high school. I think I was really self-centered.

[00:11] There's always about me and what everyone could do for me.

[00:14] Everything I wanted was just like respect and status.

[00:16] And maybe that hasn't changed, I just got better at it. I don't know.

[00:20] I want to share with you a conversation that changed my life.

[00:22] If you don't know, I am at a Zoshmozi, I would like to visit Shnakcom. It's portfolio of companies

[00:25] that have 85 million dollars a year. This particular story was after my first semester of college.

[00:29] I went to an all-guys school in high school and I went to Vanderbilt for my undergrad.

[00:32] And I had acquired a pretty bad reputation in my opinion in high school by being kind of a promiscuous

[00:39] for lack of a return of my, you know, I was known as a womanizer and I just didn't generally have a very good reputation.

[00:44] At least one that I was in proud of. And so when I went to college, I was like, okay, it's my chance to start fresh and it's a much bigger school.

[00:50] So, you know, my transgressions won't be as known because it's way more people.

[00:54] And the first, you know, three months of my college career, I did everything that I was doing in high school on steroids.

[01:00] I did more of everything. I drank more, I went out more. I ended up having a one thing of one nine GPA going inside.

[01:08] I basically had these report cards from my teachers that were like halfway through the first semester that were sent home.

[01:14] They were like, you're a son of a family and basically every class.

[01:17] And so my dad called me up and was like, if you're going to do this, like, you can do this here for very and not do this at college, right?

[01:24] And so I went home and I was like, how do I get these people to stop talking all this math?

[01:30] Like, there was the same back in the day called juicy campus, which was like a gossip form and I'm getting shut down because they were so much hate on it.

[01:35] But there was like this massive, massive threat about me and how it was just like a total womanizer and all this stuff.

[01:40] I felt horrible. You know, I mean, you can imagine like the younger version of yourself that's really sensitive to like what everyone says about you.

[01:45] And so I just went to my wife and I was like, how do I change what they're saying? How don't get them to say good things?

[01:51] And it sounds were hard to say this now. But what he said to me changed my life. And he looked at me in the eyes and he was like,

[01:58] why are you trying to change people's perception of you when you can just change who you are and let their perceptions catch up?

[02:04] The only way you're going to change your reputation is by being different. He's like, you need to stop being this person that does all these things and your reputation will catch up.

[02:12] And even if it doesn't, you'll always know.

[02:14] And honestly, it barely scratched the surface because my ego is so high and I was like, no, I just have to think of a better way to like mark and

[02:22] But I ended up knowing that he was very serious about the threat of pulling me out of school. If I didn't do my grades up.

[02:26] And so what I ended up doing for the next half of the semester of my first semester of freshman year is I didn't go out at all.

[02:31] I didn't drink anymore. I really didn't like hang out with girls at all and all I did was study.

[02:35] And I was able to pull my money been one, two. It was very low up to a three point two for the semester, which basically meant I got an A on everything from that point for the rest of the semester.

[02:45] And so when I went back home, it was like, well, no, you know, you can do it. And so we should always expect that that is what you're going to get from here and out.

[02:50] And it also kind of proved it to myself too. I was like, I guess I can do this. And you know what happened is after I started switching that way.

[02:58] People still thought of me as a whore. And I still had to deal with that. It took like two years to really reverse the reputation that I had acquired in the first three months.

[03:07] I think during that period of time, I grew an appreciation for how easy it is, especially in first impressions to set them wrong one.

[03:14] And now hard it is to overcome a negative impression. And my reputation overall, the realization I had was there's too many people that you're interacting with in the world to try and curate reputation.

[03:26] The only way to change your reputation is to change who you are.

[03:30] Reputation is fundamentally just what people say about you to your face and behind your back. I'm not saying that you need to care about everyone else things.

[03:37] That's not really the point of this. It's much more if one person says you're an asshole, whatever. If every person you know says you're an asshole, like you might be an asshole.

[03:43] And so if you have one of the situations where you feel like the proof or the evidence is overwhelming and you might even believe it, then it's probably you.

[03:50] I think that for me getting out of the hole like I can control this and try and curate what people think about me and transitioning to be like at the end of the day, I'm the only person who knows who I am and I don't like who I am.

[04:01] And just saying like well, how can I get to a part where I would like me? Even if everyone else hated me, how can I like me?

[04:07] When I started operating from that place, it really changed my life because then I started thinking like what version of me do I want to be and what does that guy do?

[04:14] Well, that guy studies really hard and that guy works out really hard and that guy is a really good friend.

[04:18] It's always respectful, doesn't have an ego and it took me a long time and I still work on this stuff.

[04:23] You know, I've been almost saying I'm done by any any sorts of imagination.

[04:26] But I think that if you can simply shift the perspective of like I'm going to try and appear this way to like I want to be this way.

[04:35] If it just so happens to get captured great and if it doesn't, great.

[04:39] And there's this this quote by HwikTee is that I'm probably going to butcher.

[04:42] But he says if you need someone else to tell you something about yourself, you are out of integrity

[04:49] because you can always be your own witness. I think that that's a great point to wrap the this little video lesson up with

[04:56] because that piece strikes to the core of everything which is we are our own witnesses.

[05:02] And if we want to change our reputation, we need to change our reputation with ourselves first.

[05:06] And then eventually it will reflect in the world.

[05:09] And this has just been very telling for me because like more and more people recognize me every day when I'm walking around.

[05:13] And I'm like, she's like, I don't have any room for having a bad day.

[05:16] Like if I'm out to dinner and like I'm just like not concentrating and I'm short with a waiter and then we'd

[05:20] recognize this me, then you know he's like this guy's an asshole or whatever.

[05:23] And so I guess in some ways it's like you can pretend like your famous because you are to yourself.

[05:28] And so I will leave you with that designation.

[05:30] If you're new to the channel, welcome lots of love and I'll see you guys in the next video.

[05:33] Bye!

[00:00] Burnout isn't real.

[00:01] I just got off the phone with an eight-figure plus CEO

[00:03] that was contemplating shutting down his entire business

[00:06] because he felt burnt out.

[00:08] I'm gonna release my side of the conversation with him

[00:10] so that I can show you the unlocks that we went through.

[00:12] Never done this before.

[00:14] It's an incredibly powerful call.

[00:15] You can unlock the unlimited motivation

[00:17] that I think he was able to tap into by the end of it.

[00:20] You do not have mental illness.

[00:21] You are not mentally unhealthy.

[00:24] You do not have anything wrong with you.

[00:26] If anything, you have a lot of stuff right with you.

[00:29] I think that you will really hard on yourself.

[00:33] You're not only doing great, you're doing extraordinary.

[00:37] Like you're doing very well.

[00:39] And so whatever voices you have in your life,

[00:41] internal or external,

[00:43] that are telling you otherwise.

[00:46] You need to stop listening to them.

[00:47] I tweeted this morning and I was thinking about you.

[00:49] Do not listen to people who's dreams

[00:51] for your life are smaller than yours.

[00:53] Like parents, friends,

[00:56] only person who can know who knows how big you dream is you.

[00:58] And if someone does have bigger dreams for you,

[01:00] then you should absolutely listen to them.

[01:01] You don't even need to be in, but if you don't.

[01:05] Then there are advice is not bad.

[01:06] That you don't share a common future.

[01:09] And most advice should come from a shared common goal.

[01:13] But most people will give advice that serves them

[01:15] through your behavior.

[01:17] This is another way to involve manipulation.

[01:19] Like they're experiencing help and manipulation is intentional.

[01:23] All we do when we communicate with anyone

[01:24] in general is to manipulate their behavior

[01:26] or change the behavior.

[01:28] It all is to change your behavior from this call.

[01:30] I hope that this decreases your stress level

[01:31] because it reframes how you act in the company

[01:34] and in so doing allows you to go further.

[01:38] Because right now, what feels unsustainable to you

[01:41] is unsustainable because you've defined it as unsustainable.

[01:45] What happens is people start defining normal as good.

[01:49] And that is the problem.

[01:50] Normal is normal, normal is average.

[01:54] And so we have to be different than average

[01:56] or different than normal or extra ordinary.

[01:58] In order to achieve an extra ordinary outcome,

[02:01] I want to say Andy Grofe said,

[02:02] only the paranoid survive,

[02:04] arguably one of the goat operators of the century

[02:07] who basically turned it into a round.

[02:09] Saying that only the paranoid survived.

[02:12] And you hear like Steve Jobs, like he was obsessive

[02:15] and he was difficult to deal with.

[02:18] And so if we try and use standard is this guy normal.

[02:22] The obvious answer is no, and I hope not.

[02:25] And so a lot of these character traits

[02:27] that I feel like I've heard you say about yourself

[02:30] that are set in a negative light,

[02:32] said differently, it's just they are not the same as other people.

[02:36] Well, we can't hope to be have a different outcome

[02:38] from other people and then also

[02:39] I hope to have the same behaviors

[02:40] viewpoint beliefs and skillsets.

[02:43] Right?

[02:44] So like you gotta let your lungs adjust the altitude.

[02:49] Like you just want to like the reroads of success.

[02:53] You know what I mean?

[02:54] I started talking whatever Europe I was.

[02:56] I think.

[02:57] Not even fuck.

[02:58] It's been like six, seven months.

[03:01] And the business is triple.

[03:03] What's interesting though is that you were in pain then

[03:05] and I would say that you're in equal pain then,

[03:07] changing the circumstances or our conditions

[03:09] is not going to change any fear.

[03:11] You changed your conditions.

[03:12] We actually massively improved them.

[03:14] You are feelings didn't change.

[03:16] Which means that the feelings are not valid.

[03:19] Doesn't mean they don't exist.

[03:20] It just doesn't mean that we have to listen to them.

[03:23] Managing stress is a learned skill.

[03:26] It doesn't come from changing conditions.

[03:28] Anything external does not influence how stressed you are.

[03:31] The judgment you have about the external

[03:32] is what influences how stressed you are.

[03:34] I don't like the term mindset.

[03:36] You don't mean I hated overall.

[03:38] But in terms of like reframing and perspective shifts,

[03:42] I think those are powerful to think through.

[03:44] Which is that the end of your life

[03:45] you will probably be equally satisfied

[03:47] and dissatisfied.

[03:48] There will be things that you will wish you have.

[03:50] You would have accomplished.

[03:51] And there will be things that you will be proud

[03:52] that you had done.

[03:53] The same as right now.

[03:55] And so I think it's much more about figuring out

[03:58] how to separate your internal dialogue and feelings

[04:02] or at least response to your feelings from the external.

[04:06] You don't have to go through the fire.

[04:08] The fire gives you evidence that you have the trait.

[04:11] You can be a patient person but never contested.

[04:13] But the moment you tested you have evidence

[04:15] that your patient.

[04:16] So all it does is it gives us reinforcement

[04:18] that what we thought about ourselves all along was true.

[04:22] What is the practice of doing this?

[04:23] It's being able to separate and identify

[04:27] when you feel stressed.

[04:29] Step one, I feel stressed.

[04:31] I feel it.

[04:32] And whatever your triggers are for me,

[04:34] I feel tight in my chest.

[04:35] That's how I know that I start feeling stressed.

[04:37] So when I feel that, I think, OK, what is causing this?

[04:41] What is the trigger that I have chosen

[04:43] to judge is good or bad?

[04:45] What is the label that I'm describing to a situation?

[04:47] If the peel back the liar and say, what is it?

[04:49] And then usually, if you take it all the way down,

[04:51] it means that you think you're going to die.

[04:53] Sales are alone today, which means sales are going

[04:55] to be low forever, which means that when I have to fire

[04:57] everyone, which means everyone's going to hate me.

[04:59] They're going to be isolated and alone.

[05:01] They're going to die.

[05:01] Or I just get you think it doesn't mean it's true.

[05:03] Thoughts are not true.

[05:05] Not all thoughts are true.

[05:06] They're just thoughts.

[05:07] Same as feels.

[05:09] They're just, they're literally just chemicals in your brain

[05:11] that are meant to keep you alive.

[05:14] Not to be succeeded.

[05:15] When you feel stressed, stop and be like,

[05:17] ah, I'm feeling remotion here.

[05:20] I wonder what is causing this?

[05:21] What am I labeling as bad?

[05:23] Do you why I need to change anything

[05:24] about this external condition?

[05:27] Probably not.

[05:29] So do I think that law of large numbers is that if I

[05:32] 365 days and I did the exact same thing,

[05:35] there's going to be days that are in the bottom 10%

[05:38] and days that are in the top 10% with the exact same conditions

[05:40] like in terms of behaviors.

[05:42] Insures yes.

[05:44] And so I just described this as like, oh, this is just

[05:46] my people, one of those bottom 10% days.

[05:48] And bottom 10% days happen every 10 days.

[05:51] Independent, it's three a month.

[05:53] It's almost every, you know, every week ish.

[05:55] And even of those 36 days, you might even be in a bottom

[05:57] 10% day of things.

[05:59] Which is about a 1% day.

[06:00] 3.6 days a year.

[06:02] Fucking horrible days.

[06:04] What does it mean we need to change our behavior?

[06:05] Probably not.

[06:06] Because our behavior over a long trendline

[06:08] has triple this business.

[06:10] I feel for how much should be yourself up

[06:12] because I too be myself up.

[06:14] And I do know what it's like to be miserable.

[06:18] And I prefer not being miserable if I have a

[06:20] Victor Fragrals man surf from eating.

[06:22] The man's in a fucking hall like in the hall cost, right?

[06:24] And he's like happy ish.

[06:26] So if he can be happy there, then me making a

[06:28] fuckload of money being young and healthy and married

[06:31] in the most of all country in the world,

[06:33] do I really have any reason?

[06:35] When COVID hit, the first three weeks, a shitload of gyms

[06:39] closed.

[06:40] My judgment of that was that they were people who wanted

[06:43] to have a reason that was socially acceptable for losing.

[06:46] They were just waiting.

[06:48] And then finally they had an out that they could be like

[06:50] COVID and everybody like, oh, I shut up.

[06:53] Not to say that external conditions don't affect things.

[06:56] They do.

[06:57] But the way of gyms that I saw that really wanted to keep going

[07:01] but couldn't have it like month and night

[07:03] when the second shutdown happened.

[07:04] They ran out of cash.

[07:05] They literally couldn't keep the doors up.

[07:07] But the ones that happened in the beginning

[07:08] had lost the will to fight.

[07:11] And so my goal for this call was to renew your will to fight

[07:15] because if we can separate your internal feelings

[07:18] from the external conditions that are around you,

[07:20] you can be unbelievably successful.

[07:22] Now, if it is uncomfortable, of course it is.

[07:25] It's expected to be.

[07:26] That's why it's growing pains because if you were doing the same thing

[07:28] you were doing before, then you would already have a doubt

[07:30] to it, which is why like I said,

[07:31] you gotta let your lungs adjust to the air.

[07:34] Stenner, fewer people can stand it.

[07:36] There's more pressure.

[07:37] But it does normalize.

[07:40] Just like when you look back at what you were running a million dollar

[07:43] business and you were stressed out of your mind then,

[07:45] you're equally stressed out now.

[07:48] But you would wish to have the problems you had with a million

[07:50] businesses because you have adjusted your lungs

[07:53] as strong enough.

[07:54] The things that you're doing are not even impossible.

[07:56] They've been well-to-occurring and in-done for decades

[07:59] by other companies.

[08:00] So it's surely between your ears.

[08:04] Which is good news, because it means all we have to do

[08:05] is reframe reality.

[08:07] And when you feel stress, you do not need to be hailed

[08:11] stressfully.

[08:12] Because the plan is solid.

[08:16] We just need our commitment to the plan

[08:18] that we just decide.

[08:19] I think you just have to be able to like create space.

[08:23] If you think about one of those like Yeti Mugs,

[08:25] you know what I'm talking about?

[08:26] You can have some of the hot on the inside

[08:27] and it doesn't, it's not hot in the whole

[08:29] that it needs to stay hot for a while.

[08:30] The difference is that there's separation, there's air

[08:33] between the outside and the inside.

[08:34] It could be cold outside of the hot outside.

[08:36] It's not gonna change the temperature on the inside of the ball.

[08:38] So you need to be more like a yeti.

[08:40] Right now, if it gets colder, your inside gets colder,

[08:42] if it gets hotter, the inside gets hotter.

[08:44] But the more you can stay constant independent

[08:47] of the external conditions, I feel stressed air.

[08:50] That's because I have labeled something

[08:52] externally as hot.

[08:54] But is it?

[08:55] I have an external stressor?

[08:57] Do I need to feel stressed?

[08:58] Space, what if this were good?

[09:00] What if this is normal?

[09:01] What if this is to be expected?

[09:03] What if this is just the bottom 10% damage just statistics?

[09:05] Of course, I'm gonna have bottom 10% damage.

[09:07] One out of 10 days is bottom 10%.

[09:09] And on the flip side, something internally is off,

[09:12] space, it doesn't mean that I need to act that way.

[09:15] So it's bi-directional.

[09:16] If you delay the space between when you feel something

[09:19] and when you behave, I promise you the behaviors that you will do

[09:22] after you've had some space, we more line with your long-term goals.

[09:26] To have the expectation that building a business that's going

[09:28] to set you up for the rest of your life

[09:30] is going to be easy as ridiculous.

[09:32] The reason it is difficult for people

[09:33] is because you have to change how you do reality.

[09:36] And you have that power, you're super-inspective,

[09:38] you're very caring.

[09:39] You have all the characteristics of an excellent CEO,

[09:41] the only thing that you suffer from is insecurity,

[09:43] in second-guessing.

[09:44] Less emotionally reactive, more confident.

[09:46] Being able to continue to do without seeing the result

[09:49] of your doing.

[09:50] If you embody those traits, this company will grow beyond

[09:53] what I think you expect.

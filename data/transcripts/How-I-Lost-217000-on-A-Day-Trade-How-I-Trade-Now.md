[00:00] What's going on everyone? My name is Alex Shermozie and I am the host of the show owner of

[00:05] Allen prestige labs gymlaunch with 120 million in sales in 44 or 45 months. What I want to talk about today is

[00:12] Something that I think is really important to get a lot of questions about and it's about long-term short-term investing

[00:17] Some big pitfalls and I just want to share with you some of the mistakes that I've made in this kind of transition that I've been through

[00:23] Going from kind of CO to kind of

[00:26] Investor slash capital allocator, right? So the first thing is I want to share some some substats with you that I found really interesting

[00:34] I think it was fidelity

[00:36] Did a study was either fidelity or tors Schwab did a study on which investor profiles and activity yielded the best returns in terms of total portfolio value, right?

[00:47] And this is in stocks and they found that there were two categories far outpaste everyone else

[00:55] Let me tell you what they were

[00:57] The first and highest performing portfolio activity where people who had purchased stocks and then died

[01:06] And so as a result there was no more activity in their account and their accounts outperformed everyone else

[01:13] The second highest were people who purchased a count or purchased stocks to the account

[01:19] And then had forgotten their password as a result had not done any trading

[01:24] And so for me I think this is hilarious because it shows credible flaws in human judgment

[01:29] And it also shows the power of compounding growth when buying businesses in general

[01:35] Because then you just get exposure because if you think about this from across all of the accounts that they have

[01:40] Then across all of the accounts and they have equal exposure to ups and downs, et cetera

[01:44] So across all of those accounts which is just like taking index of the market

[01:48] The people who do the least amount have the most money in the account

[01:52] Now what I want to do is explain to you a mistake that I made

[01:56] I probably like two weeks ago that cost me should I have to do the math probably cost me

[02:02] Two hundred grid yeah, it costs me 200 grand all right

[02:06] So here's a 200 thousand on mistake that you don't have to make it. I'm going to walk you through the math

[02:09] All right, so what I was doing is I have in my quote portfolio

[02:15] I guess it's not quote portfolio. I have three to five percent of it in an investable assets that I

[02:22] Candidly I just play around with and it scratches my entrepreneurial itch and

[02:27] Just me being a human being ninety five percent. It's actually ninety seven percent of my

[02:32] Worth is in really really stable stuff. All right, but I want to talk to you about the five percent

[02:37] So here's the difference between holding versus trading

[02:43] All right, and this is something that is massively underlucked and I'm hoping to at least convince one person who's

[02:50] Listening to this that if you look at the math you you see how quickly you shouldn't do you shouldn't try and you

[02:57] Shouldn't try and beat the market

[02:59] By by by trading all right, and so here's here's the first reality is that there's huge quantitative firms that have

[03:07] Hundreds of analysts are trying to beat you and they they make their money doing that

[03:11] But the second one is a simple hundred dollar example, all right, so let's say you have a hundred dollars

[03:17] All right, so this is our this is our initial capital

[03:20] All right, and I'm going to give you two scenarios that we're going to walk through

[03:23] So in scenario number one

[03:26] We're going to have our day trading example and let's say that over expert of time you do really well

[03:32] Now I'm just going to ignore the fact that most people are just going to lose money

[03:36] All right, so that's probably like 75% of all of us are going to mess up somehow and think we're going to beat it and it

[03:42] You know I'm going to quote by the dip and then it just goes down by another 50% right, but let's just assume you double your money

[03:49] All right, so your one hundred dollars becomes two hundred dollars. All right, everyone's cool

[03:54] So let's just say that happens over a five year timeline. Why never all right now

[04:00] The point here is that it doesn't really matter because if you're in this as soon as you are doing this through trading

[04:08] Then the capital gains treatment gets thrown out the window and it becomes regular income. All right, so your tax differently

[04:14] So this hundred dollar gain right that you have here

[04:19] From one hundred to two hundred gets taxed at

[04:23] forty five, you know 43% whatever it is and so you have a an additional let's say here

[04:30] So then it means that after this whole period of time you're going to be left with a hundred and

[04:37] forty

[04:39] Shit, sorry, well hundred and fifty five dollars, all right, sorry about that

[04:43] Hundred and fifty five dollars, which are left after tax all right post tax

[04:48] Now don't worry I'm going to show you a third scenario to second the second scenario is you do it and you instead of

[04:54] Trading that whole time you just earn the same amount

[04:58] Two hundred dollars, you're hundred turns to two hundred dollars and candidly the my all my passives

[05:04] That has out for four of my active stuff, which is hilarious, but which just confirms this for me

[05:10] Which is why I'm making this video. All right, so let's just say that you still you make the same hundred dollars

[05:14] All right, we're good there hundred dollars, but now it's capital gains, all right, so instead of being left with a hundred and fifty five dollars

[05:20] We're now left with a hundred and eighty dollars. Wow, well, that's bigger

[05:25] But let me show you and this is the thing that kind of blew my mind because that's why I love looking at the math so much is

[05:32] Well, then how much would I have to gain from day trading or trading on shorter terms of swing trades or whatever

[05:40] For this to be worth it, right, how much extra money would I have to make

[05:46] To outpace the fact that I'm I'm getting this regular income tax treatment on my income, all right, so here's what's crazy

[05:55] So in order for me to get to net eighty dollars, right, I would have to take that hundred dollar investment

[06:03] And turn it into I did the math earlier. It's a two hundred and forty five dollars

[06:09] All right, so that means that I would have to

[06:14] My my growth here would have to be fifty you know forty five percent higher, right

[06:20] And that crazy in order to yield

[06:24] Because that times the regular tax treatment gets me to hundred and eighty dollars, all right

[06:28] So if I'm comparing the two things if I want to be left for the hundred eighty dollars option one is I buy something and I forget about it

[06:37] And then later five you know five years later, I I sell it for whatever reason and I am left with a hundred and eighty because I only had to pay capital gains on it

[06:46] In scenario in order for me to to just match that not even beat it

[06:51] I would have to take my hundred dollars and turn it into two hundred and forty five dollars

[06:56] And then sell it and this is obviously this whole time you're continuing to flip things and buy things and buy things right and then after the regular income tax I'd be left with a hundred and eighty dollars

[07:07] All right, and so when I saw that illustration it became so obvious to me because

[07:12] I had had some decent gains and something

[07:15] And so I decided to sell it and I actually ended up selling it at a good time

[07:20] Because it ended up going down because I felt like it was getting a rebellion and so I thought I felt pretty good about myself right and

[07:29] What ended up happening is

[07:33] The thing ended up coming back up to exactly where I had sold it again and so if I had literally just done nothing

[07:41] Then I would have more money because now I have to pay I have to pay taxes on regular income because I sold it within a year

[07:48] And mind you again guys this is on my three to five percent. I don't touch anything that's that's not that all right

[07:54] So I'm just being very clear and candid here nor do I recommend you do that so if you need the look if you need the edge

[08:01] Then I would say put your put 3% aside for pure speculation which is just like I'm which is basically just saying I'm a human being and I'm an idiot

[08:10] And this is how I can manage my idiocy

[08:13] But when you see the math spelled out like this between this is what smart people do and this is what dumb people who don't make us much money do

[08:21] Then it makes me so much more inclined to just do what smart people do and take all of that extra time and just do something else or just make money with my extra time

[08:30] What am I good friends he I've known him for 20 25 years

[08:38] And when I met him he was I think he was he was managing I mean maybe five million dollars like not which in the finance role is not a lot for management

[08:46] And now 25 years later

[08:49] I think you manage just 3.5 billion he's one of the most stable people that I know and when I talk about this stuff he's like you need a hobby and so I guess the message that I have for everyone is maybe get a hobby

[09:03] And just let the money grow and pretend you're a dead person and if you can't pretend you're a dead person then throw away your password or give it to somebody that you would be ashamed to ask for your password back

[09:15] So that you just don't touch your stuff because ultimately you'll probably be probably end up getting higher gains

[09:23] And be you'll get taxed less on those gains

[09:25] So I hope that was valuable for you. I hope this makes sense. I hope you get a laugh out of my $200,000 mistake that I just made in the last two weeks

[00:00] I'm Al Shemosi and I'm an investor and I own acquisition.com. It's a big portfolio company.

[00:03] It makes me momentarily than an olive root need in rest of my life. I had a hundred business owners

[00:06] who flocked to our headquarters to scale their companies. And so they asked me questions for an hour.

[00:10] I tried to do my very best to make the solutions as tactical as seemingly possible so that you can

[00:15] watch him from home immediately use them in your business. First off, I have to say thank you for

[00:19] taking me out for dinner last time. That conversation that we had literally changed my life

[00:25] to the Chinese business. So, yeah, appreciate that.

[00:29] And it's all the story of what happened.

[00:31] First of all, we had an event that was scheduled, had to get moved. The memo got passed down

[00:36] and everyone found out except for one sales guy and he sold six people into an event that didn't

[00:43] exist. On like a random Monday, we had six people showing up. Came from Israel and he was like,

[00:49] hey, I'm here for the workshop and I was like, this looks awesome for us. I'm really happy.

[00:54] I'm really happy that we're in this situation. We've always tried to come from the perspective of like,

[00:58] when you have something that gets messed up, like you can't just like refund somebody because they're

[01:02] still net negative. He still flew from Israel. If I said, hey, my bad, here's the money back. He's

[01:07] still going to like screw this guy. Right? And so we had the team spend the day with the six and then we

[01:13] took them out to dinner. And I bring that up just because it was a great example of like something

[01:20] that took me too long to learn. Was that like, you can't just make it right. You have to make it

[01:24] more than right in order to actually make it right. You know, that was obviously a super unfortunate

[01:29] situation and you know, every business, if you have humans, you make mistakes. Right? And so that was a

[01:34] mistake that we had made. I remember hearing the stat from Disney, which is that it takes 37 magical moments

[01:39] to overcome one tragic moment. And so the moral of that statistic is not, let's do 37 magic moments.

[01:45] It's avoid the tragic moments if at all possible. But if you do find yourself in a tragic situation,

[01:51] here is an interesting thing that Layla taught me, which is that believe it or not, the people that

[01:56] you wrong and then super compensate to make it super right become your biggest ambassadors. He flew

[02:03] back out and he gave such a heartfelt, you know, you know, story that like it took somebody who was

[02:10] negative and I think, you know, from at least what it sounded like, he was super positive towards us.

[02:15] And I think that that's in some ways as terrible as it is when you do have one of those tragic moments,

[02:21] just see it as an opportunity to flip someone from a hater into an ambassador. Rather than being like,

[02:26] oh, we got to give these people refunds. It's like, no, like, we actually get to build our

[02:29] reputation and decide what kind of company we want to be. Where we're stuck at right now. So we're

[02:34] selling the back end offer up 195 or more. Yeah. Or semi-private. Okay. Or four months for 595,

[02:42] our turn for both of those is 50%. So we did it's 30% turn. And the reason why we've got such

[02:49] terrible turn is nobody shows up. Like, 7% of our student body actually shows up to the calls and

[02:56] actually gets the value from the thing they purchase. What's the onboarding? We'll go ahead.

[03:01] So we have the closer get them to see the calendar of we have eight sessions a week that they can

[03:07] join. So they shut them the calendar. They say, okay, which one of these do you think you can come to?

[03:12] And then they get them to say, okay, this one. And then the closer says, okay, I'm going to tell Jenny.

[03:18] So the coach on that calls, she's going to be expecting you. There's two kind of like

[03:23] different angles to attack this. One is the kind of like logistics side, which I'm going to

[03:27] cover first because it's easy and just processed stuff. And the other is kind of like the bigger

[03:30] more amorphous stuff, which is like, how do I make our thing easier? Easier and more enjoyable

[03:35] for people to kind of experience on the logistics side. I'm sure that you're on my email list.

[03:41] If we had dinner, you'd better be on my email. By the way, if you got anyone here read the most

[03:45] of you minute. Anyone? I think it's the best, like I think it's some of the best stuff to put out.

[03:49] Anyway, it's really good. I think it's really good. I spend like my Sundays on it. Anyways,

[03:53] so Ban Fam is a way of life. So book a meeting from a meeting. Right? And so the sales guy

[03:58] should obviously book to the onboarding call, right? Or whatever. I do think that you probably

[04:03] need to add one onboarding call that's specific to the person not just have them drop in.

[04:07] How much do you want this to work? Really bad. Okay, so this is what I would recommend doing.

[04:12] You'll probably want to do something in the neighborhood of four to six sessions that are one

[04:16] on one. I'm just big like, now if you need to just price in order to do it, fine. But it's four to six

[04:22] sessions of one on one before they kind of qualify to go into the kind of the group setting. And so it's

[04:27] like you will personally onboard them so that they have this way better buy in their way. Like they

[04:32] don't feel like they're just like in no man's land and just getting tossed into the middle of a

[04:34] conversation. But you kind of like on ramp them. After you have the onboarding, which should be and you

[04:40] can cut the, I mean at the very beginning, just do two. You know what I mean, just to start and then you

[04:44] can kind of see how it goes. From there, you basically want to keep Ban Famming per session. So all the

[04:52] people are showing up. The last five minutes, I would say, okay everybody, let's pull up the counters.

[04:56] When you guys showing up again, great. And I book it with everybody so that I'm keeping people

[05:01] forward. And you have to back that up with probably the reminder sequence that they're going to

[05:04] get because it's actually a scheduled session. So they should get automated reminders and they should

[05:08] probably get a main or reach out from the person who's running the session. If the people were

[05:11] supposed to who are supposed to attend at the very least, do the automated one. And that would probably

[05:16] get a huge amount of like that will probably do a lot. And so this is actually, believe it out,

[05:20] this is an onboarding process for a gym. So if you have large group training, if you take people

[05:24] and just toss them into the group, it's much harder than having kind of a more dedicated onboarding

[05:29] experience. The idea is you do like 6-1-1 sessions to someone. They feel more comfortable in the gym.

[05:33] They understand people. They understand how they can survive the culture is. And then they kind of

[05:36] graduate into the group sessions. And so what happens also is that the group sessions are now in a

[05:41] pedestal. It's like, you're not ready for that yet. Right? So you got to earn that. And all of a sudden

[05:45] becomes the prize that they earned. And now they got on board. Is that the thing, can you see how that would work?

[05:50] For sure. Yeah. So this would probably be that if that out, it's like a big, has long-tailed,

[05:54] sort of pricing system. And the question that you'd ask if you want to give an AB close for this

[05:59] is you would say, would you rather train, you know, start your start your thing in a group or

[06:05] one-on-one with me? Now it's if you're selling. If it's somebody else or one-on-one with John.

[06:09] And there are a lot of times they're going to be like, why rather do it with John? You're like,

[06:13] great. So this is the price for that. And then you just go for that sale. If it's not like,

[06:17] no worries, we can just start you here on a big deal. And then if you want, if normally you sell six,

[06:22] you can say, you know what? I'm still going to give you one. If you do that, because it's going to be

[06:25] way better for the experience for you. So then it feels like a gift and doesn't feel like they're like,

[06:29] well, now I don't want the group thing, right? So just give them one or two, if you sell a six,

[06:34] for example. So that makes sense? So he presented obviously with a low consumption issue, would then

[06:41] probably translated into low renewal and probably high-churn. And so the issue that

[06:49] typically precedes that is low consumption. Right? And so in order to first get consumption,

[06:55] you know, figured out, I like to get attribution in place. And so I don't know what kind of

[06:59] tracking he had, but I think he's like seven percent or something like that. And so he had some level of

[07:03] tracking, which allowed him to even take action on the problem. But most times when I ask more questions,

[07:09] I'd say nine times at a 10-day entrepreneur has a problem, but doesn't collect any data that

[07:12] precedes the problem. And so then the first step is to just go collect the data. And once you have

[07:17] the data, typically the solutions become obvious. And so a lot of time is wasted in this space of

[07:23] like trying to ideate and figure out this hypothetical solution without any data. And you're like,

[07:28] I don't know, is it this or this or this that we could do? It's like, well, you have no data,

[07:31] so you have no idea. And so you just keep circling. And so when you don't know what to do,

[07:35] get data first, and then it makes the path easy. I self-care coaching services to

[07:40] tripward executives. So basically we help these people find their next role. So we did 7.2

[07:45] million in revenue last year. We got about two million in profit. Amazing. And we know how to grow

[07:50] be to see, we know that we can do that, but we're really wanting to get B2B going. Okay, so these

[07:54] enterprise level deals are a little bit more, they're different volume. Right? So we're struggling

[07:58] to get our first B2B deal because they have to be big enough to have the bunch. Why do you want to

[08:03] do B2B? So this entrepreneur is obviously doing well, he's doing multiple millions of dollars a year.

[08:08] And he's got something that says decent margins. And he said in order to scale, he should do B2B.

[08:14] But he was in a consumer-based marketing, consumer markets are huge, it's way more consumers than

[08:17] there are businesses. So he had a proven product with a proven acquisition channel and was profitable

[08:22] and was growing. And he was spending, you know, three or five thousand dollars a day. I was like, this

[08:26] is nothing. In terms of the amount of scale that's available for the product that he had. And so

[08:31] when he said he wanted to do this other new thing, I had an inkling that it was for no actual

[08:36] reason besides he probably encountered some sort of difficulty that he assumed the new path wouldn't

[08:42] have. And so this is just a classic woman in the red dress. Why can't you just do more what you're

[08:46] currently doing? We can. Okay. We hit like 90 and knocked to over. And like that was a big, like a

[08:52] million month. Like that was the milestone where it's like okay. I'm trying to do a different stuff.

[08:56] I'll tell you what my initial reaction is which you're already probably guessing, which is like

[09:00] I will exhaust more before I look at anything new. And so someone have to make a very strong

[09:05] argument for me why I can't do more about a Marty doing. So if I were to buy your company tomorrow,

[09:09] I'd be like, yeah, don't worry about that. Just what are you currently doing to get customers?

[09:13] It's Facebook ads. Okay. So what are you spending a day?

[09:16] Uh, anywhere from 35,000. Right. I'd be like, okay. So how do we get to 100,000 a day in spend?

[09:22] A day. Yeah. Wow. Like what stops us from getting to 100,000 a day? Okay.

[09:27] And the answer to that question is the constraint. So what stops you from getting? So let's say

[09:32] 10,000 a day. So it's a triple. So like what stops you from doing that? We were there in October.

[09:36] We're back around 10,000 a day and that we had like sales efficiency.

[09:39] Mm-hmm. So things like that. Obviously Q4 is not like the best time to have that type of

[09:43] service. And so really just like making sure they're back in or are front in like sales,

[09:48] called the closed very all that could stop us like able to. Yeah.

[09:51] profitable. We have a lot of like services like one on one so we pair pictures really well.

[09:54] We have a writing team in house that we pay. Yeah. So there's costs. So what would,

[09:59] but that those costs are fixed because you'd have that cost to be a bit. Right.

[10:02] Okay. So what stops us?

[10:05] The problems that exist in the beta-seasonary will also exist in the beta-be scenario.

[10:09] And so he's like, hey, I've got, I've encountered this problem. I don't know how to solve.

[10:12] And so my way of solving it is to not solve it and start something else that will

[10:15] create even more problems in my business. And so when you say like that, it sounds ridiculous.

[10:19] But this is a decision making process that a rather a mistake making process that a lot of

[10:23] people follow. Fundamentally, you want to ask, why can't we do more? And the issue of that question is

[10:28] the constraint. And the only, in my opinion, proper constraint for deciding to go after new avatar

[10:34] is that you run out of the existing avatar. So think about this. Have you ever done B2B?

[10:38] Like enterprise? Okay. So the thing is is that they are a higher leverage, but you're also going to

[10:44] have like 10, 15 touch points. And so the number of deals per guy is going to go down a lot.

[10:49] There's also going to be multiple stakeholders that they have to get involved on their side.

[10:52] And multiple stakeholders that you're going to introduce on your side. So just in general for B2B

[10:56] like enterprise level sales, you increase conversion rate and stick of a customer by increasing the number

[11:02] of people that are involved in the transaction on both sides. So basically you want to show,

[11:10] you want to show, has as many of these ties as you can to do enterprise sales. The lowest

[11:15] risk adjusted return move in any businesses to do more of what's already working. And answer the

[11:20] question why, why can't we do more? And so if you have a sales efficiency issue then like

[11:25] solve the sales efficiency issue because it's holding you back from tripling. The things that you

[11:28] brought up are all fixed problems. As in their their problems on both paths. So to to forego the path

[11:34] you're currently on for a new path that's completely unproven with with the same problems that you

[11:38] know already exist is a much higher risk move than just saying, yeah, why don't we just get to 30

[11:44] million? Okay, so just focus on maxing out B2C, yeah, we're about B2B, so we're like fully

[11:49] confident B2C. Yeah, so we're doing everything. Well, not even that you're doing everything that you

[11:53] have exhausted the market of C's. Okay, right? Like it's so if you want diversity then I would rather

[12:01] you go to diversity of channel rather than changing customers. The riskiest thing you can do is a new

[12:06] business. Basically you have a new offering of new acquisition like everything is new. And so I would

[12:11] rather if you if you have the itch for new just get a second channel but I don't think you're even

[12:15] close to that. You're at 35,000 a day. I think you can totally spend 50,000 a day for sure just on that.

[12:22] What will likely be the next thing that gets in your ways that your row as is going to drop?

[12:27] And so typically that's going to be you're going to need to have option one, better lead magnet,

[12:34] option two, better creative, option three, superior CRO, conversion optimization just on the the

[12:40] pages. Option four, improve sales efficiency. Option five, all four. And then that allows you to scale.

[12:46] And like fundamentally the difference between companies that can spend 100,000 a day and 5,000 a day

[12:50] profitably is how good they are. It's literally just making all of this pieces better. And that takes time

[12:54] because you're going to really change one of those at a time and this is why business takes time to grow.

[12:58] I sell bleacher rentals to Festals and Fairs. So we do around 4.5 million in revenue

[13:05] and about a million in profit. You bet that. What's stopping me is having my leadership team

[13:13] delegate fully some of the responsibilities. And I think it has to do with creating processes that

[13:20] are followed by all. If we need to hire key people and we don't have the processes, then we

[13:25] can't delegate properly. So how do you train leaders? So this is a good question when

[13:31] chunk up one level because I think it'll be valuable in general. Which is that fundamentally when

[13:36] we're hiring anyone, we look for the smallest skill deficiency possible. Fundamentally, you've got

[13:42] traits as people call them and then you've got skills. Now based on Alex's worldview, this is not a thing.

[13:52] It's just that. A trait is just a series of skills. Right. And so when you hire a CFO, for example,

[14:00] you're going to try and hire for the smallest skill deficiency. And so if the CFO is a dick for

[14:07] example, but they're exceptional on all these other things, then you're like maybe I can teach

[14:10] them to be kind in these ways. Now that'd be a big, and that's a lot of skills to just have some

[14:15] like go from not kind to kind, right? A lot of sub-skills underneath of that. And so if it's two days

[14:20] to train sales and two months to train kindness, take this person who's kind and then train them on

[14:25] sales. Later on, sometimes you have people who you're like, okay, this person's a little different

[14:30] than our vibe. They're not going to be oil and water. But they have this massive skill set that we

[14:36] can use and this tiny deficiency that is around this stuff that we can be transferring with them

[14:41] upfront that they need to fix. I've seen this happen again and again and again where a manager or

[14:46] a leader talks to somebody else and says, hey, and then uses a Morpheus terminology that's very

[14:51] hard to pin down to basically say, change your behavior and they're like, but how? And they're like

[14:55] change it. And you're like, okay, I don't know what that means. And so the reason I'm so obsessive

[14:59] about operationalizing terms like what is patience, what is courage, what is humility, like what

[15:04] are these terms actually mean in terms of behaviors, like patience is figuring out something

[15:08] you're doing the meantime. Like if you do figure out something you're doing the meantime,

[15:10] you're a bide-of-all being patient, right? And so it's telling someone what they actually have to do,

[15:15] not who they have to be. Stop being lazy is very hard for someone to solve. It's like,

[15:20] I keep telling or not be lazy and she's keeping it lazy. But you have to break the term down

[15:23] into what behaviors you describe as lazy. Because when you talk to, you know, you're your partner,

[15:29] you talk to somebody else, you say, hey, Sarah's kind of lazy. Have you noticed that?

[15:33] There are things that she did that you observed that you described the label lazy too. And so you

[15:38] have to think more deeply like, what did they do to deserve the title? And it might be like,

[15:43] they don't respond quickly to slack messages. These are things that if you said, hey, Susan,

[15:48] instead of insulting her and saying, hey, you're lazy. Instead, we'd say, hey, you don't respond to

[15:53] slack messages quickly enough. You aren't responding. You know, after hours and hours keep going

[15:57] to an NINPM and you're not responding until after five. And so for this week, I want you to focus

[16:02] just on responding to slack messages. So I'll just turn on notifications. Let's turn it on both of

[16:06] your phones and turn it on to your computer so that you can see it. Is there anything else that's

[16:10] going to get in the way of your responding quickly? Now, when we ask that question, we might find out

[16:13] that Sarah is overwhelmed because she's doing somebody else's job, we laid off and we haven't

[16:18] backfilled. It's like, okay, well, now we have context. But until we get to there, we can't appropriately

[16:25] measure Sarah's inherent value or traits rather behaviors to give her a label. So to your question,

[16:33] how do you train leaders? I think that attracting good leaders. So one of it's recruiting.

[16:38] Right? So Chick-fil-A's head of people said this. She said a lot of people are trying to fix

[16:43] process when they really lost the championship in the draft. And so a lot of people are trying to

[16:49] figure out what playbook they should be using with a team that's never going to win. So the big

[16:53] framework that we use for training in general is document, demonstrate, duplicate. And so first,

[17:03] you figure out exactly what the checklist is. And I like checklist more than quote SOPs. That's

[17:07] a personal preference. And so it's like, and you want to be able to break it down into behaviors.

[17:11] And I think this is where a lot of training goes wrong. I think most companies aren't very good at

[17:14] training. They're just they basically hire a bunch of people who's got the skill and then fire the

[17:18] rest. But if you do get good at training, it's like, how do you train kindness? Well, you say, okay,

[17:23] well, people who are kind when they come on a phone, they smile. Right? And they know they're

[17:27] head when people are listening. And they repeat back what someone says. And they, you know, raise their

[17:31] voice when they walk into a room. Right? And so if you boil it down into some of the behaviors,

[17:36] then the onus is on us as leaders to be more specific with what we tell our subordinates to do.

[17:43] And I think a lot of times if you're struggling to train some of these key traits with leaders,

[17:48] it's because you're not being specific enough about what you want them to change. And so it's like,

[17:52] you're just not getting it. It's like, well, no one can do anything with that. And so it's like,

[17:56] you have to, and this is where the work comes in from the top down. We're like, okay, when you do this,

[18:01] and so the easiest way to bucket this, that's a key. There we go. Is Sarah, I need you to stop doing this.

[18:15] I need you to start doing this and I need you to keep doing this. And so just being more granular

[18:20] about what behavior you want them to stop or what behavior they're not doing that they need to

[18:23] begin or combination. And so giving someone the feedback of, I need you to do this instead of this,

[18:29] has been some of the most effective way that I've been able to change people's behavior. And it's

[18:32] the about around the specificity. And so if your leaders aren't doing what you want them to do,

[18:36] document them to treat duplicate. This is the step process. Let me show you how I do it. Now you do it in front of me.

[18:42] And this is what we're going to have you stop doing. You're going to now do this instead and keep

[18:46] doing the other stuff that's good. I sell professional book publishing services to entrepreneurs and

[18:52] executives. We do a million dollars in revenue. I'd like to be at 3.2 million revenue.

[18:56] Very precise. And I just earned 32. Yeah. That's a best, this is the best

[19:03] explanation for revenue goal I've ever had. That's great. What's stopping me is I'm at the stage where

[19:08] I need to make more money before thinking about other things. And the challenge I'm facing is

[19:13] a lot of things have worked for us up to this point, but I need to know what to, I need to

[19:16] clarity around what to do more of. So what's the input? So what's the thing that drives the business?

[19:22] The biggest thing that drives the business right now is referrals. Okay. The second biggest thing is

[19:27] related to organic in the form of speaking social media and guest coaching. And then we have a split

[19:33] between cold email outbound and Facebook ads. You're doing all the acquisition channels. All of them

[19:40] and we didn't even mean to do all of them. And try them on. They all seem to work enough. What's the greatest

[19:44] percentage of your customers? What channel do they come across? Greatest percentage of the customers

[19:47] be after referrals would be organic. Okay. And that's, you know, you put that both in organic

[19:53] content, but also like speaking and things like that. Okay. How many speaking things you're doing

[19:58] on like a monthly basis? About one prettier last year. Okay. So I have an idea. So I would ask the

[20:06] question like, like, I think I might have told this in a short, but a really close friend of mine

[20:11] he took over real, which is a public-traded real estate brokerage. Their primary way of getting

[20:18] more agents is him speaking at real estate events. And so in Q4 he did 66 speeches. And in 24

[20:26] months he took from 200 million to 1.2 billion in revenue. And so he's doing 270 plus events per

[20:31] year in person. We were having dinner and he was like, no one gets it. He was like, no one understands

[20:39] how much more we do than them. And I'm only telling the story not to make, hopefully it comes

[20:45] across the right way. Because I think you're just like, if, if, and I'm guessing if that event

[20:50] generated business for you? Yeah. I mean every time I speak we make a more of a camera. Well, yeah.

[20:56] So I'd be like, let's like, how do we go from, you know, one a year or one a week and start there

[21:01] just like target 15 extra. And so he rightly identified that he simply needed to do more. The next

[21:07] actual question I was going to be asking is like, what are all the ways to your customers? Which

[21:10] he obviously answered. And so then it was like, okay, the next fall of question I'm thinking is,

[21:14] where do we have the most leverage? So either that's going to be, which thing is taking the

[21:18] least amount of time to make the most amount of money or which one is the thing that cost you

[21:21] least amount of money that makes the most amount of money. I see it's at the time leverage

[21:24] or it's money leverage or both. Now the fact that he said I always make a bunch of money after I

[21:29] speak, I was like, okay, that's a positive indicator. And as soon as he said, I only do one speaking

[21:33] of it in a year, I was like, I don't need to know anymore. Like, if you're, if that's a significant

[21:37] amount of revenue and it's one day, once a year, like I see that and think, okay, well, we could

[21:42] 50 x the business if we just did 50 of those. And so then the constraint then becomes, okay, how

[21:47] do we get booked on these stages? But then that's, you follow the same core four, you do the outreach,

[21:50] you post, and then you reach out to people to find out. And sometimes you have to pay to be on

[21:54] the stages, sometimes you get a booth and then they'll give you a speaking slot. There's always

[21:57] ways to get on if you need to. We have quiet companies in the UK and do, right, come revenue

[22:03] across the portfolio is about 35 million. The metric isn't so much want to get to a revenue

[22:08] metric. We want to try and create a minimum around 50 million enterprise value for a few

[22:14] own all of them out, right? No, so it's very, I think the problem is, do we focus on build net,

[22:22] double down on the companies we already have, grow the EBDR that way, what we keep acquiring

[22:27] and build the EBDR through acquisition? I mean, do you have 14? 14? Are they similar? No, that's the

[22:33] thing. So, yeah, if we used to grow through acquisition, we got to try and create synergy down

[22:37] the line. Yeah, so you're, you're in a very classic kind of PE no man's land. So you have more

[22:45] companies than most funds would ever have. And you didn't pursue a synergistic strategy in order

[22:53] to do a comedy volume. And so on one extreme, you have like constellation, which you're probably

[22:57] familiar with in Canada, it's like they only buy vertically integrated SaaS and they go sub 3 million

[23:02] and they just do 100 deals a year, right? And they just know their playbook. On the other side,

[23:06] you have traditional PE that would have a variety of different businesses they buy, you know,

[23:10] detail shop and then a supplement company and then whatever, but they only have 68 companies in

[23:14] a fund and they have a decent, decent, you know, decent home code team to add value to the company.

[23:20] And so if I were in your position, first thing I would do is probably ask myself, who do I

[23:26] want to be when I grow up in terms of what you want the actual data to do to the business to be?

[23:30] Because you can hit 50 on either of those paths, right? And so it's which of these do I feel more

[23:34] like more me? Like do I feel like I do have a couple of these businesses that you're like I really

[23:39] understand these ones? And if you don't feel that way, then I would probably look at these and go 80

[23:44] 20 and say, okay, what's the 20% that's driving 80% of the enterprise value and trim

[23:50] honestly, I would just like go completely passive on those ones or just return equity or do

[23:55] some sort of deal so I could get my attention back and then double down on the ones that you are good at.

[23:59] So this gentleman who had a P firm suffered from a classic issue that I cover in the

[24:05] offers book, which is that he had not committed to the niche. So this is page 38 of the book.

[24:11] And I tell the story where I try not to niche flat people, which is that they need to pick one niche

[24:20] Now this gentleman had basically two paths that he could follow. He could follow a more concentrated

[24:25] path of just a few companies that could be disparate or different in nature. But because of a team of

[24:32] fiveish people, he could probably preside over those call it six companies that are the the

[24:36] better ones of the portfolio, double down on those inject capital, bring you know recruit higher

[24:42] level talent, maybe improve the strategy and then grow the companies. The alternative path

[24:49] was that he just gets really vertical meaning he tries to get as many companies that are of the same

[24:55] type so that he can see trying to use fancy words but synergies between the companies so that they

[25:02] all together kind of the sum of the parts is greater than the whole because you can centralize some

[25:07] costs which adds profit to all of them. You can have cross business learning so if you have 10

[25:12] HVAC companies started by 10 different founders, all of them are going to have a few things they do

[25:16] well. So you take the best practices from each of them individually and then you implement them across

[25:21] all of them and so you get this cost savings of the bottom line by centralizing costs and then you

[25:26] distribute out best practices and so that is a typical kind of private equity play which is a roll-up

[25:32] play where you can buy 10 things for a million dollars and sell all 10 together for 50 million.

[25:37] And so he was obviously shooting for a 50 million dollar exit and the crazy thing is and this is true

[25:41] of entrepreneurship is there's a lot of ways up the mountain. The bigger the goal is the fewer the

[25:45] ways up the mountain there are. So you want to get to a trillion dollar company well there's

[25:48] you have to you're going to have to do some crazy new technology that probably doesn't exist

[25:54] in order you've to get there. If you want to have a 50 million dollars that you can do that with

[25:58] just about any business by just getting it to a decent amount of size and yes that includes chains

[26:03] of brick and mortar that includes online business like you can you can absolutely do it in any

[26:08] niche no matter how small it is. I so the wellness so basically physical therapy personal training

[26:15] 35 to 45 year old athletes are is the avatar and we do about little over three million the

[26:21] biggest thing that stopping me you have a huge shortage in practitioners to give context there's

[26:27] about 16,000 open positions your supply constraint yes so I need more producers to produce

[26:36] so I decided to kind of pivot and say well if I can't find the people I'm going to increase price

[26:44] one glad you did that as the thing you decided to do so that's fine. I started another business

[26:50] on e-commerce yeah yeah so to start teaching people to yeah so that went well to the tune of

[26:58] we didn't lose revenue okay but I'm at that point where now do I go all in on continuing

[27:06] to increase price and move more into almost like a concierge membership model or do I go all in

[27:13] and just try to crush and find the people and do what nobody else is possibly doing do you have any

[27:17] issues on getting customers no we have more demand okay yeah so if you're in my story about

[27:27] buddy money is in the cleaning business all right I'll tell I'll tell you so form a gym owner

[27:34] crushed it with gym launch and then decided he started making enough money that he started investing in real estate

[27:38] as all entrepreneurs do and then after you know crushing in real estate he was like you know I should

[27:43] probably start a cleaning company because he started doing Airbnb is out of his real estate he's like

[27:46] this is cost me a ton of money I should vertically integrate and so he started the cleaning company

[27:51] to clean you know his Airbnb is he's like well now that I have the cleaning company I might as

[27:54] start selling other customers don't leave money on the table right uh it's you can see how this

[27:59] is spindles right the moral of the story that was that I call I call them up and he was telling me

[28:04] he's like dude it's crazy he's like selling cleaning customers he's like cax like 25 bucks it's insane

[28:09] everybody like it's so easy to get customers and I was like oh you should scale it's the moon he's like

[28:14] yeah you know it's kind of hard to get English speaking made to don't take stuff from people and do a

[28:20] good job and show up on time and are willing to work for $15 an hour and I was like okay so the

[28:27] nice thing that you have is you have a supply country business that he was used to fitness which is

[28:30] typically demand constraint so it's just it's hard to get people to one a shot to the gym right

[28:36] not hard to get people to say they want somebody else to clean their house and so basically the

[28:41] reframe that I gave him is what I'll give you which is you're not actually in the physical therapy

[28:46] business you're in the recruiting physical therapists business the whole paradigm that I would have

[28:52] around this is what is the career path look like for the physical therapist so that I can make this

[28:56] really enticing on top of that I have to still think through the same you saw the same core for

[29:02] right you've got you got warm outreach you've got cold outreach you've got paid ads and then you've got

[29:09] I should know these are what the book okay we're gonna content right so these are the these are the

[29:14] four things that you can do right and then you've got headhunters right which is basically recruiters

[29:19] and you have word of mouth from your existing whoops word of mouth from your existing staff

[29:24] and so these are the ways that you can get physical therapists and so we have to approach this

[29:28] the same way we approach getting customers they are just now the customer and so maybe running in

[29:34] D dad's is probably not the way that's that you're gonna get them but I'll bet you that

[29:40] outreach will work exceptionally well to get therapists and I would probably bet that if you had a

[29:46] really good referral incentive over time that would compound now small not as much you'll

[29:52] probably need to do this to start as you get bigger though there's gonna be enough of the base

[29:56] where a few percentage every month of referrals is material and so let me just put this in math for you

[30:01] said that you can say this will motivate you to do it how much do you make in gross profit off of a

[30:07] physical therapist per year on average? about 360 okay so if I told you that I could add

[30:16] $350,000 in growth profit per year to your business how much would you be willing to pay for that

[30:20] in the first year? right and so giving someone $500 for a referral not that motivating if you said

[30:27] I'll give you 20 grand for a referral I'll bet you'll get them to move. Most businesses are either

[30:33] supply constraint or demand constraint now if you have a business that's both that it's like you don't

[30:38] have customers you know there's employees like that's a tough place to be most of the time it's one of the

[30:42] other and what's interesting is that entrepreneurs will often try and solve basically like not solve

[30:49] the real problem and this was kind of the exact what she was presenting was she was like should I do this

[30:54] other thing or should I like it should I change my model all together but the crazy thing is it's like her

[30:59] model was doing great she was making good margins she had she's doing good revenue out of two locations

[31:04] it's like why are we gonna break the model like the constraint of the businesses that you just

[31:08] don't know how to recruit so let's just solve that problem because her other path of like just

[31:14] raising prices which is to be fair I'm all in favor of at some point it's like you can't raise the

[31:19] prices anymore like you're becoming like a luxury business and it's just like you're changing all the

[31:23] dynamics of the business but her business worked already and so for me the lowest risk thing to do

[31:29] is not change the business model but just figure out the problem the business and solve it and for her

[31:34] biggest problem was I can't get people but I don't think she had quantified how much she should be

[31:38] willing to invest in getting more talent and I think this is wildly underrated it's like think about

[31:44] from return on on profit I just only did on gross profit right it's $350,000 per employee so

[31:49] I'm like why would you not pay I mean like just being wrote why would you not pay $50,000 or $100,000

[31:53] right if you know that if I people are happy to put you know a hundred thousand dollars in the stock market

[31:58] and get 10% back and make 10,000 but in their businesses their hesitant to give a commission

[32:02] of of 10,000 dollars for $300,000 thing right and so if you're like well what if that doesn't work out

[32:07] then push it out where there's the contingencies that you're happy to do it and if you want keep raising

[32:11] the price until you get people to refer like with enough incentive you can move the world and so

[32:16] speaking of this physical therapy brick and mortar business I did a brick and mortar breakdown

[32:21] of five locations a car practice that had done through M&A on how to accelerate the growth of the

[32:26] business and it's super tactical and it works whether you have a single location or you're even

[32:30] virtual a lot of the tax will carry over to any business to help it grow. Enjoy.

## Full Transcript
[00:00] For three years, I recorded two videos a week and I put them in a Facebook group because I didn't understand how YouTube worked.

[00:07] And over that time period, I got better at communicating and things like that.

[00:12] But there is a specific video that was among the most watched and most shared videos that I ever made.

[00:19] And I thought I would share it here with you guys, Mosey Nation.

[00:22] For those of you guys who don't know, my name is OxomoZone, I'm now position.com.

[00:25] You know, portfolio company said it was about 85 million dollars a year.

[00:27] Now, in the video it's from the past few years from the numbers that are in there.

[00:31] It's what I was doing at that time.

[00:33] And this specific video is incredibly valuable to me because it was one of the videos that really set me free.

[00:39] In understanding the true single, most valuable resource that we have as entrepreneurs and how most entrepreneurs are leaking it.

[00:45] And once I plug that hole for myself is when I started seeing explosive growth in my business, but also in my life overall.

[00:52] And so I wanted to share this video because I think it's incredibly valuable.

[00:55] And the marketplace of attention has said that this was one of the most valuable videos that I've ever made.

[01:00] And so I wanted to share it with you. Hope you guys enjoy.

[01:03] This is a little bit less common for me.

[01:06] I'm going to make a video, I guess, podcast, depending on how you're consuming this.

[01:11] On a pretty tiny, tiny, tiny sky topic.

[01:15] And I titled this the New Entrepreneurial Golden Resource and how you're probably leaking it.

[01:20] So a lot of people don't know this, but I probably, I would say, I'm into four or five people on the side, not in a formal business setting in terms of like them paying me anything like that.

[01:32] But just people that have become friends that I've taken interest in their business and I've helped them along.

[01:37] And invariably, and what's interesting is that the higher up you go, the less tactical the mentorship is.

[01:44] I had, so I've had the fortune of actually connecting and befriending my first billionaire friend, which is cool.

[01:51] And what's, what's happened is a result of that is that like I obviously obsessively look at what people were doing better than me are doing.

[01:59] And then when I'm relaying to the people who are, while I'm trying to help, there's this one resource that people who make a ton of money manage extremely well and people who do not do not.

[02:10] And a lot of people, I would say mistakenly think that the number one resource is time, right? Everyone's like time is money, time is money, time is money.

[02:18] And I would argue that that's not necessarily true. I would argue that attention is money.

[02:23] That is the golden resource. So the billionaire friend that I have, he's actually been helping me on the new endeavor that we are launching to our gym lords.

[02:32] And I'm not sure if it's true, but I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true.

I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true.

[03:02] I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true

[03:32] I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true

[04:02] and the only way you can do that is if you have the attention in the band with in order to do so. That's why if you look at a business owner and the more I obsess on looking at billionaires and people who are doing better than we are, I look at how to fly it and how clean they keep their space. I mean both in a literal sense that their surroundings, their office, their house, their homes, their cell phone, their computers. It's quiet. Everything. It's pristine. It's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think it's true. I think

[04:32] we talked to these people. There's a certain amount of tranquility that's there. They just have very low tolerance. It's not that they're trying to be impatient with you or impatient with the world. It's just that they understand that they have felt like they're operating at such a high level that there's so many things that are demanding of their time and attention, that they just like they can't. They have to forcefully remove themselves from so many different situations. I'm going to give you an example. One of the people that I'm somewhat nervous about,

[05:02] they had four businesses. This is something that happens so many times. You want a $100,000 coaching. This is what happens in a $100,000 coaching sessions. I'm being honest with you. What happens is someone who's coming in usually doing between $13 million a year can't get past a certain point. The reason they can't get past is because they only have so much attention. They've spread between four or five different kits. That's when the gym owner has four gyms and is making less money than they did when they had one gym.

[05:32] Because the amount of attention that they can allocate to one facility has gone down so much that with fixed costs, they basically are breaking even.

[05:39] And so the same thing happens. Now that entrepreneur is probably making one to $3 million and rose revenue but not taking anything home because they don't have the attention to actually put on the things.

[05:47] And so in order to grow, you need to do less. In order to grow, you need to do less.

[05:54] And that comes from both delegation and also choosing what not to do. The better you get, the better the opportunities that you have to say no to. Imagine the level of opportunities that we have now.

[06:04] I'm just being honest. Imagine how many things we could do or try and JV with or do a partnership with or whatever because of the distribution network that we have and the trust and the goodwill that we have with the gym owners that we have in our network.

[06:18] Right. A lot. I get, you know how many people that cold message me like I have an opportunity for you. I'm like really you have an opportunity for me.

[06:27] And so the better you get the better job to see if to see no to which is why becoming a higher and higher and higher level entrepreneur is more and more difficult because it requires discipline.

[06:37] It's not about doing more. It's about doing less because we in need what to do more.

[06:41] So doing more of your own internal character history if that was what it took to get to be more successful then everyone would be more successful because it would be something that does not take effort because that is something that we already do.

[06:52] And so like man I work anyone I've got all this work that it cool that gets you from zero to one.

[06:57] It's not going to get you me further than that. So stop identifying with that. It was something that I used to identify with. I was like I'll I'll I'll I'll work anyone I would have like that was something that I used to think about.

[07:07] And it was a character treat is an identity thing and the more you grow the more you realize that your identity needs to be fluid because what it needs to be is exactly what it needs to be at that given time of development.

[07:18] Because the character trace that I'm going to have to emphasize in a year are going to be different than the ones that I have to emphasize now the skills that you need to learn like delegation.

[07:26] Leadership those are things that are not the things that take you in the beginning. You have to be independent.

[07:32] You have to be hustling you have to be grinding you have to be willing to put in the work because no one else will do it for you.

[07:37] Especially if you have no capital start which most people are on here are in that situation. To real this back in.

[07:43] The number one thing that you have to be paying attention to is where you are paying your attention.

[07:49] Right like you spend attention that's why they call paying attention. It's because it is a resource and most people don't pay attention to that right.

[07:56] And so one of the things that a lot of people don't know about me this was going to go along.

[08:00] Some of the things that a lot of people don't know about me is that I for nine months paid a coach to teach me one thing which was to manage my attention.

[08:11] It was to teach me how to think.

[08:13] And so for 90 minutes every single day all I did was talk about what I was thinking about.

[08:20] Think about that. Every day I paid attention to one of my attention once.

[08:25] And when I did that all of a sudden my business blew up right and I realized that I had toxic relationships.

[08:33] I had toxic relationships with parents. I had toxic relationships with friends or pseudo friends.

[08:38] Things that I that were taking my attention past things that I had on my mind that I knew I had not handled.

[08:44] So this is called like open loops or open cycles right. So when you have something that you like have it resolved this.

[08:49] Then you need a hand of that and you get that attention back because what happens is you have to bowl this tiny little bowl of marbles if each of those marbles is is is a unit of attention right if you had to measure it.

[08:59] And so you put little marbles of attention on your child who trombist you put little marbles of attention on your marriage you put little have marbles of attention on your health.

[09:10] You put little marbles of attention on your spirituality and then massive marbles of attention on your business.

[09:15] But the thing is is that sometimes you need to quiet and collect all of these other little marbles so that you have more

[09:20] Potency more potential energy more potentially units of attention to spend on the one thing that you're trying to grow which in this case would be your business.

[09:29] And what's interesting is that what happens is that things that were perceived as difficult become really easy.

[09:35] And I don't know if you've ever had this happen, but like if you were in college or you were in high school and you're like,

[09:39] I can't solve this problem, this math problem and you were exhausted and then you go to bed and you wake up the next morning and then I'm going to see it seems really easy.

[09:45] Like I don't know how I didn't see that before because attention gives you the ability to see.

[09:50] Right?

[09:51] Like if you think about wisdom right?

[09:53] Wisdom is an ability to see where other people cannot see.

[09:56] Right?

[09:57] Two people are presented the same situation the wise and person sees things that the other person does it.

[10:01] And how can you see better?

[10:02] You see better if you have more ability to see which comes from your most valuable resource.

[10:08] Attention, how much horsepower do you have?

[10:10] And so look at the things that you have in your life right now.

[10:13] Like if I see someone who has a messy relationship life, who's got a messy love life,

[10:16] who goes out every weekend and gets trashed.

[10:19] Right?

[10:19] Like I can tell you, billionaires don't do that.

[10:21] That like the whole Tony Stark, like vision of the entrepreneur, is a farce.

[10:27] It's not true.

[10:28] Don't believe that.

[10:30] Every single billionaire, every single high-level entrepreneur is quiet.

[10:34] Unbelievable quiet.

[10:35] They keep themselves completely isolated.

[10:38] They have a bubble around them of layers of protection.

[10:41] They're like like for me, it's me and then there's Laila and then we have our CIOO and then

[10:48] we have our executive assistant team because we have a team of EAs at this point.

[10:52] We have four who work the next level.

[10:55] There's no one who has direct access to including our employees.

[11:00] No one does.

[11:01] And that's because it would dis-serve you, you guys, our gym owners,

[11:06] if everyone had access to me.

[11:08] The reason that I don't respond to Facebook message is not because I don't want to.

[11:11] It's because I literally can't.

[11:13] And if I did, I would be disturbing everyone because then my attention would be split

[11:17] because someone can't turn right leads to them or whatever.

[11:20] You know what I mean?

[11:21] Like because these little things, these little things that are perceived as huge issues to you

[11:26] in that moment because you have a little bit of attention,

[11:28] you have so little left that everything seems like an explosion.

[11:32] But when you have lots of capacity, big problems seem small.

[11:36] And small problems seem big and it sounds reverse because what you do is you start seeing

[11:40] that all of these things are attention drinks and you just say,

[11:43] how do I want to play anymore?

[11:45] And you stop playing.

[11:47] And then all of a sudden everything is really simple because

[11:50] do you only things you have to do become really simple?

[11:52] At our gym loads about one of the things that we had to do or that I had everyone do,

[11:56] was simply to find the number that they needed to have in their gym,

[12:01] number of EFTs, in order to have the life stuff that they wanted to have.

[12:05] Really simple process.

[12:08] Most people didn't have that, but it's amazing what happens when you have clarity

[12:12] because it then allows you to put your attention in one direction.

[12:15] And then it gives you a litmus test, will this help me grow this number?

[12:18] Yes or no?

[12:19] Yes, cool, let's do it.

[12:20] No.

[12:21] Ignoring.

[12:22] Right?

[12:22] And it takes discipline to say ignoring.

[12:25] It takes discipline.

[12:26] That's why it's hard.

[12:28] That's why most entrepreneurs aren't successful.

[12:30] That's why most entrepreneurs don't grow.

[12:31] It's because it's hard.

[12:32] It's counterintuitive.

[12:33] It's counter-your character.

[12:35] And so you have to learn how to not be yourself in order to be the person that you want to be.

[12:39] And that's why most people don't do it.

[12:41] And so to go ridiculously full circle on this,

[12:44] every time I meet with an entrepreneur and I tell my told you,

[12:47] I coach is probably a loose term, but I'm with a few handful entrepreneurs

[12:54] on a semi-regular basis and just see how it's going.

[12:56] And the question that I always ask is what's your attention?

[12:59] Resurutention.

[13:00] And if someone comes in, they seem really, really scattered,

[13:03] I already know that their attention's all over the place.

[13:06] They're super-spreadment.

[13:07] They're less able.

[13:08] So of course they can't grow their business because they don't have the very horsepower,

[13:11] the main resource that allows them to grow and push.

[13:14] And so look at your life, look at your relationship,

[13:18] with your spouse, loved one, look at your habits,

[13:21] how you wake up, how you eat, how you exercise, do you drink?

[13:25] Here's an example for why we stop drinking.

[13:27] And it has nothing to do with any kind of like,

[13:29] there's no religious anything regarding this.

[13:32] We stop drinking because I realized that I would drink at night

[13:36] on a fairly regular basis, not like I was had some issue with that I really didn't.

[13:40] I mean, I drink a lot, but I just, whatever, the point is this,

[13:43] is that I would drink in the evenings because I would,

[13:46] it would help me just destress, but I don't want it.

[13:49] But what that does is it masks the thing that is taking my attention

[13:53] that I have anxiety on, right?

[13:56] And so if you need to take a drink to unwind,

[13:59] that it means you have things that you have not resolved.

[14:02] And so one by one, what happened is that when I stopped drinking,

[14:04] everything got really loud.

[14:06] And so I had to face and confront the things that I had not resolved yet.

[14:11] And so in the beginning it's the hardest.

[14:13] But then what happens is once you've actually resolved all of those things,

[14:17] the desire to drink goes away because you're like,

[14:19] well, I actually feel really good right now.

[14:20] I don't want to mess that up.

[14:22] And so it flips.

[14:23] But it took, it took probably six months for that to happen from it.

[14:27] And so I'm just giving that as an example of what,

[14:32] of what happened in your attention split and kind of gaining that attention back can be.

[14:36] So look at your life, look at your relationships,

[14:39] look at your habits, and the things that are taking your attention,

[14:42] you need to handle complete the cycles and get the attention backs.

[14:45] You can work on the one thing that you're trying to grow.

[14:47] And if you have side hustles on side businesses, get rid of them.

[14:52] That's what people, people come and they pay tons of money to tell them,

[14:56] do one thing.

[14:57] And the only reason that they listen is because we make work.

[15:00] And I'm telling you right now, that's what I would say.

[15:03] Do one thing.

[15:04] Focus.

[15:05] Do one thing.

[15:06] Focus.

[15:07] It's angry again.

[15:08] That's why most times when someone comes in they're like,

[15:11] hey, I want to start an online business in a food prep business and

[15:14] and whatever, right?

[15:16] All at the same time because one of them is going to take off.

[15:20] It doesn't work that way.

[15:21] All of them can take off.

[15:22] You can have a billion dollar food prep business.

[15:26] You can have a billion dollar gym business.

[15:28] Like your business, like having more businesses is a farce.

[15:31] I was talking to a gym owner the other day and he's like, yeah, I mean,

[15:33] two pig chicks is better than one.

[15:35] And I was like, no, one fat paycheck is better than two.

[15:37] You can have a hundred million dollar roofing business, right?

[15:40] That just repairs roads.

[15:41] You don't need to do general contracting and also windows.

[15:44] And also gutters and roofs.

[15:46] You can just do one thing and you really, really, really, really, really, really, really

[15:50] make as much money as you want.

[15:51] And so just bring that belief of yourself of like,

[15:54] I have to have three things in order to make more money.

[15:56] You know, you don't.

[15:57] You don't.

[15:57] It's not true.

[15:58] You want things.

[15:59] I had someone who's in the real estate space who was doing real estate coaching.

[16:03] After her first month of being in the coaching called me up and was like,

[16:07] there's just not enough real estate agents.

[16:08] She was doing like $200,000 a month.

[16:10] And I was like, real estate agents.

[16:12] I was like, how small of a marketing micro gym owner is?

[16:17] I was like, you literally outnumbered my market a hundred to one.

[16:20] And I was like, and we are out doing outpacing your revenue,

[16:24] 21.

[16:25] It's just these beliefs that we have that are silly.

[16:28] And I can tell you that the higher if you go, all of those limiting beliefs to

[16:31] secure.

[16:32] And you just see people who operate a very high level, very quiet, very clean.

[16:36] They're like, if someone walks in the door and is any negativity,

[16:38] those people just get up and leave.

[16:40] Nothing personal.

[16:41] I just can't have that in my life, right?

[16:42] Someone complain, someone's negative, the weather,

[16:45] traffic, so like, don't worry, I'm just going to get up and go,

[16:48] it's nothing personal, right?

[16:49] That's how they handle themselves.

[16:50] So, um, thank you guys for your attention.

[16:53] Um, I hope I gave you a positive return on it.

[16:55] That was my intention.

[16:56] Um, this wasn't a normal type of, uh,

[17:00] video that I would normally make, but it was something that was like,

[17:02] online mine.

[17:03] And I just had two or three calls recently where I had 12 people to consolidate.

[17:08] Their businesses get rid of one, two or three businesses.

[17:11] And then within a matter of 30 days, um, two of those people,

[17:16] uh, had a multiple of three X or their total revenue between of what they were doing before

[17:21] within 30 day period, just by getting their attention back.

[17:24] Look at what you can consolidate.

[17:26] Lots of everyone, I appreciate you and um,

[17:29] shoot a like for someone who feels really distracted or if you have a spouse and you're like,

[17:32] we should clean up our stuff, tagging so that you can clean it up and, uh,

[17:37] have to get some attention back.

[17:39] All right.

[17:39] Also, that's an amazing Thursday.

[17:41] And I hope to see you guys soon.

[17:42] Bye.

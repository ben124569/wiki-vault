[00:00] So when I started my first business, I remember signing the lease and having my heart drop

[00:03] because this really exciting thing that was once my dream, all of a sudden became a reality

[00:07] and then I was terrified because I realized that I had no idea how to get customers.

[00:11] And this reality set in for a while because I was told I should run a group on to get customers

[00:16] and I ran a group on and no group on's were purchased.

[00:19] And all of a sudden I knew I had $5,000 a month that was coming out.

[00:22] And I only had $5,000 saved up total and I was in a new area and I knew no one and I had

[00:27] zero customers to start with and my business was going to quote open in two weeks.

[00:31] And so this was a point of panic for me and then luckily a friend of mine said, hey,

[00:37] we should go to this marketing conference and at this marketing conference I went there and I had no

[00:41] idea what I was doing.

[00:43] Everybody there was a business owner, it was a $3,000 marketing event workshop and they promised

[00:48] that I would make $10,000 by the end of the weekend and I really needed to make $10,000.

[00:52] I'll look at you the long story short, I didn't make $10,000.

[00:55] But I did learn about this thing called Facebook ads and that was ultimately how I got my first

[00:59] 29 clients and my brick and mortar facility way back when almost a decade ago.

[01:05] And since then we've learned a lot of different ways to get customers.

[01:09] And so over the last year we spent a million dollars plus in I mean honestly, we've been a lot more than that.

[01:16] But for the purpose of this video I'll say a million dollars.

[01:19] I think we probably spent like four or five million year to date.

[01:22] But I think a million dollars is a nice round number four of my YouTube online.

[01:25] The thing is is that the vast majority of the customers that I have don't actually come from paid advertising.

[01:31] Crazy, right? And so what's interesting is that as I've looked at my businesses that I've

[01:35] had the age as an entrepreneur or become more experienced, I'll put it that way.

[01:38] I've diversified how I get my customers and one of the interesting things that's happened is that when I

[01:43] started this game, I was the paid advertising guy. That was how I got in. That was like,

[01:48] forget everything else, paid ads as the way to go. It is the truth. It is everything, right?

[01:54] But what's happened is that over time my perspective on this is dramatically shifted.

[01:58] And part of that is because I have realized that I think there's a lot more of a

[02:03] it depends type of answer for it. So if you are looking at the largest companies that are out there,

[02:09] the vast majority of them with the exception of consumer products are not based on paid advertising.

[02:16] Like if you're a consumer product, if you sell widgets or you sell gatorade, whatever it is,

[02:21] the vast majority of the revenue comes from paid advertising and media. You really just become a

[02:26] media company with a product that you can push and sell in large scale. But most people are a lot of

[02:31] the people that I work with sell B to B and sell in different ways that are not that type of product.

[02:36] And so when I look at the biggest companies that are not consumer goods, the vast majority of them

[02:40] are not driven by direct response paid advertising. But if you look at sales force, which is a CRM for

[02:47] businesses, they're not based, they didn't grow based on ads, they grew based on a number of other

[02:53] things. A lot of them is word of mouth. A lot of them is outbound. And so what I want to do today

[02:58] is walk you through the different ways that we get customers and the different categories that

[03:02] exist and how you can think through it. And this is going to be a repeated theme because this is the

[03:06] framework. This is probably one of if not the most important framework that I use when I'm looking

[03:10] at scaling a company, one of our companies in acquisition.com. So when we take on businesses,

[03:15] which are usually like 3 to 10 million, we invest in them and then we scale them. This is one of

[03:18] the first frameworks that I look at. And figuring out, is the traffic channel that they're using the

[03:22] best one long term? Are there short and easy wins that we can do immediately to get or double or

[03:27] triple, quadruple the amount of customers they have? And all of that kind of cool stuff.

[03:30] All right. So the first one here is the first thing I talked about, right?

[03:34] Is paid ads. All right. And the reason that this is interesting is that this is one that a lot of

[03:38] people talk about. It is the fast money way because you can turn them on and immediately start getting

[03:42] business. The difficulty that I have found is that at large scale, especially in B2B or B2B to

[03:48] see businesses, it can become more challenging, especially in niches. And that is because you can

[03:55] burn through an entire marketplace very, very quickly with paid ads and you have to learn how to

[04:01] scale outside of that. All right. So paid ads covers any kind of advertising that you have to pay

[04:04] a platform for. So you'll notice the left column is all going to be about platforms and the right

[04:10] column is all going to be about people. All right. Actually, I'll save that. I'll tell you what it's going

[04:14] to be in a second. All right. So one paid ads, two. And this one is one that is what I'm doing right

[04:21] now, right? This is earned media. All right. So this is media that a platform will give me for free

[04:28] to distribute, you know, valuable stuff. Right. So I'm getting these impressions for free

[04:33] and so that is earned to me. Now this takes a long time to do. You have to be good. People have to find

[04:38] your stuff interesting. All of that kind of stuff. But it is definitely a way to build a business.

[04:43] Look at Kylie Jenner. She's like, hey, I've got 100 million followers. I say, hey, buy my $29

[04:47] lip kit and boom. She makes $25 million a month. Crazy. Right. Now that being said, the best way

[04:54] to do that is to pick Chris Jenner as your mother when you're being born. I'm kidding. Lots of

[05:00] respect for what you guys have done if you ever watched this video. But besides that, earned media is not

[05:04] the fastest way, but it is a way of building something that can become the base or foundation

[05:09] for getting your customers. The third way is through owned media. All right. Now owned media is all

[05:14] the contacts that you have and have already given you permission to contact them. All right. So this is

[05:18] all the people in your CRM. This is all the people in your cell phone. This is all the people in

[05:22] your contacts list that you've collected over the years. All of those people have already given you

[05:25] permission to contact them. Do you know who else is in that list? Wait for it? Every single person

[05:32] that you're connected with on social media. So all the friends, all the followers, all friends

[05:36] you have in Facebook, all the followers on Instagram. Those are all people who've actually given

[05:39] you permission to contact them without any opt-in form. You can directly message someone in Instagram.

[05:44] You can directly message someone who's a friend of yours on Facebook without any kind of filters.

[05:48] And so it's funny because I have entrepreneurs who reach out to me and they're like, hey man,

[05:51] I don't know how to get my first customers and like dude, you've got 2,000 friends on Facebook and

[05:56] you've got 2,000 followers and you've got 4,000 leads right there and you haven't even reached out to them.

[06:02] And they're free and they're literally right there and they already kind of know like and trust you.

[06:07] Huh. Interesting. I got a buddy of mine who does a million dollars a month just off of this one platform.

[06:11] It's all it does. These are the three that are based on platforms. So you've got paid media, you got

[06:16] earned media and you got own media. All right. Now the second category of ways that I look at when I'm

[06:23] scaling the businesses that we take on that we invest in is manual outbound. So this is cold calls,

[06:31] cold emails, cold DMs. If you're an industry that allows it cold texts which is not a lot of them,

[06:36] but some of them are allowed. All of those things are things that you have a person who is reaching out to

[06:41] people who have not given you permission to contact them and you're reaching out to them as basically

[06:45] interruption based advertisements. You're one on one manually scaling something. What's interesting

[06:49] and fascinating about this and I'm going to save the six one for last because I think it's the most

[06:52] powerful and we'll notice in all of these is that they are all linear meaning for every input.

[06:57] You have usually an equal or proportional output. So you might get three to one so you put one in.

[07:02] You get three out. You put one in and you get three out and whether you put a hundred in or you put

[07:05] 3000 in you're still going to get that same ratio out. All right. One of these compounds. The rest are linear.

[07:12] All right. So first one, paid earned owned and then manual outbound. All right. This is so for us.

[07:18] As I've transitioned as I've aged, I've moved from this kind of this column this side over here to this

[07:22] column over here. All right. So number five is affiliates. So these are all the people who already

[07:31] have pulled together all of your dream customers, all the customers your customer

[07:36] avatars are already existing in one place. They belong to associations. They're in Facebook groups.

[07:41] They're on mailing lists. They're all pulled somewhere. If they're not pulled somewhere,

[07:45] then you probably should reconsider what's happening. But most of your dream avatars are they are

[07:50] somewhere. And so the idea with affiliates is to go find someone and create a win-win situation

[07:56] where they can refer you business and you can pay them or compensate them in some way. Right.

[08:00] And the key to making this work and this is one of the most people mess up and this beautiful

[08:04] thing about affiliates is that it works at every level. Right. If I've got a dry cleaning store,

[08:08] right. I'm going to look at the other places that I can affiliate with that already have my

[08:12] ideal customers. So probably lots of fancy stores that sell fancy clothing that may be dry

[08:17] cleaned. Those were probably the places that I would look at trying to make affiliate

[08:21] relationships with for their customers when they sell a jacket to send them to me. But the key is

[08:24] is not to just drop your business cards at the front desk or figuratively do that even in an

[08:28] online setting and just say, hey, can you refer me business and they're like sure and then they

[08:32] just toss your cards and you just leave the door. Right. Instead, it's about having full integration

[08:37] partners. All right. And the way that that works is you have to walk them through what their customer

[08:41] experience looks like. So after they buy at the counter what you I need you to do is I need

[08:45] to put this in and stay blip to the top of their bag and say, hey, these three magic words. And

[08:50] as a result, I'm going to be able to pay you for every single person that x y and z's for me. Right.

[08:55] And so you have to do a full integration. This is where everyone messes this up. All right. So

[09:01] two of the companies that I have. So right now, right now affiliate is our responsible

[09:06] across two different entities that I have for two and a half million dollars a month. Just

[09:10] of the revenue that we do. So 85 million, two and a half million a month comes from affiliates. All right.

[09:15] Say huge huge opportunity. The beautiful thing here too is that it's free. Right. The only cost of

[09:20] affiliates is just the cost of acquiring the affiliate. And then a second, I'm going to show you how

[09:24] all these things work together. All right. But for right now, I just wanted to delineate them.

[09:28] So in affiliate. So for us, we have our huge distribution base of brick and mortar facilities.

[09:32] They are affiliates for the supplements, right. I also worked with affiliates on our software

[09:37] to get agencies, right, so that we could work their leads for them. Those were affiliates, right.

[09:42] We are integrated into their customer base customer lifecycle. And the reason that you do this

[09:47] and the reason they would do it is that you have to find a way to enhance their value proposition.

[09:51] So for example, if I were trying to get that fancy clothing company, right, to get my

[09:56] dry cleaning store, then I would tell them, hey, for any person who buys your thing, I will give

[10:01] them a free dry cleaning of the thing they just bought if they bring it to my store. Now, all of a

[10:06] sudden, that business has a superior value proposition that they can offer to their

[10:12] clothing bank customers in the guy down the street. They're like, wow, this place is rich. They even

[10:15] have negotiated a relationship with another vendor to take care of me. It's the next natural

[10:21] need I'm going to have. And if I were also a dry cleaner, I probably need to go shape with a tailor

[10:24] who can custom fit stuff and make adjustments on clothing, right? We got to think like this.

[10:28] And so if we do that and we get that full integration, now it's valuable to their customers,

[10:32] they get perceived as more valuable. And then on top of that, you can choose to pay them for every

[10:35] person who retains it. Right. Now, all of a sudden, they're adding more gross profit to their business.

[10:39] They have a superior value proposition all by working with you. You've now made it a win for them

[10:43] and cost them nothing. And for you, you have no risk. You don't have to pay a platform. You're

[10:47] paying them to their business. And the thing is is, that's just one affiliate. Imagine having 200 of

[10:52] those clothing stores pushing towards your dry cleaning. Right? That's the game. Okay. So that's

[10:58] affiliate's. And the sixth way here is the most powerful. All right. Can anyone guess what it is?

[11:03] Dentida, it's referrals. Word of mouth. That's what that is. WOM. Every one of these other ones are

[11:10] linear in that, you know, there's x input and x output that's going to have. There might be, there might

[11:15] be some, you know, one to three, one to ten, whatever it is, but that ratio is fixed. The crazy thing

[11:21] is that with referrals, one person can become the beginning of the entire business, one person

[11:26] tells two people, two people, two people, four people, four people, two people, eight people, etc. Right?

[11:31] And when I look at the biggest businesses that exist out there, they're all on this side,

[11:37] vast majority of them. If they're selling B to B, if you're selling consumer goods, like I said earlier,

[11:40] a lot of them are over here. They've really become media companies and all about marketing. Right?

[11:44] But for everyone else, especially if you're telling selling higher ticket services, if you want something

[11:49] that is super, super sustainable, super, super enduring, something that is a more sellable

[11:53] enterprise, four, five, and six are the way to do it. And what's interesting to me is that over time,

[12:00] I have really just focused so much on this guy because I can't help but think to myself, if I'm

[12:05] building a product, I want the product to do all this work. If I sell someone, I want that sale

[12:12] to do work for me. I want that person to bring me another customer because this one multiplies the

[12:19] rest of the entire board. Right? If my referrals and my word of mouth are crazy, when I start

[12:24] running paid ads, my ROI starts multiplying like crazy and becomes overwhelming and crazy. Right?

[12:29] And I said crazy a lot of times. So in my book, in this book, I talk about how we have 36 to one

[12:35] lifetime return to advertising and it continues to improve. Right? And the reason we have 36 to

[12:40] one return our advertising is because we have other ways of getting customers in each customer

[12:44] comes and beued within it more customers. And that's the real secret to this. And so if you're

[12:49] like I can't get above two to one, I can't get before one. You have to ask yourself the question

[12:52] which is, why does my food suck? Why are my customers ashamed of getting me more customers? Why are

[12:58] they not telling other businesses or other other people about my services? Because if it were so good,

[13:03] why are they doing it? And so, in one of my other videos, I talk about the three questions that are

[13:07] great for framing value in terms of your product itself. But one that I think is very powerful is,

[13:11] if you could only sell one more customer and you could not do any of these other five ways of

[13:17] of getting new business. And that one customer had to be the source of new business for you.

[13:23] What type of experience would that person have to go through in order to become a

[13:27] raving fan and bring everyone they know to you? When you answer that question, it will frame how

[13:31] you should create the product and create an amazing customer experience so that you can get more

[13:36] customers from every other channel that you use to a customer's. Okay? Quick recap here. If I'm

[13:40] trying to get customers, we spent millions and millions of millions of dollars on acquiring them,

[13:45] there are two categories. You've got platforms and you've got people. And if I'm trying to bring

[13:49] on a business and I'm trying to scale that business, I'm going to look at which ones of these

[13:52] do I feel like make the most sense? And if I'm trying to build an enduring enterprise,

[13:56] typically, me, Alex, will shift a lot of effort over time towards four, five and six and not

[14:02] necessarily a way for one, two and three, but I will add these to it because it creates the solid base.

[14:07] Because when I go from one outbound person to ten, I can reliably count on the fact that I

[14:12] will ten times the sales. I don't have to worry about ad accounts getting shut down. I don't

[14:15] want to have to worry about platforms. I don't have to worry about any of that. As long as we have

[14:18] a phone or as long as we have profiles and we can reach out to people, we can get new business.

[14:22] With affiliates, each one of those people is working for my business. Every day when they're marketing

[14:27] every day when they're spending money, every day when they're on the corner, they're waving

[14:30] their signs and they're promoting their business, they're promoting by business too. The reason I like

[14:34] this is because there's leverage. There's leverage. You can get one good affiliate and you can set

[14:38] up your entire business for life. One good affiliate. At the end, I told you at the beginning

[14:43] that I was going to show you how these kind of all layer together. So, for example, an affiliate

[14:48] may be an example of somebody who has earned media and owned media. They may be somebody who

[14:54] already has a pool of customers that's owned media that they may email. They also have maybe

[14:58] followers on some channels or whatever that they have access to. When you make that affiliate,

[15:03] they're using other ways of getting customers. But for us as business owners, we need to think

[15:06] of that as a separate way. For you to acquire that affiliate, you might have to do manual

[15:09] app out. You might have to reach out to them to get them to reach out to you. Or get them to respond,

[15:15] or get them to do business with you. Understanding all six of these work because they all

[15:20] kind of work together. The big picture here is that you have to, I'm like drop my pencil thrown

[15:25] on all over the place. When you're looking at scaling the business, I don't want to overcomp

[15:28] give this for you. You want to pick one of these channels and you want to do it well and you

[15:31] want to master it. Once you have mastered it though, it would be who of you. And this is what I

[15:36] have changed as an entrepreneur. I used to always be the paid guy. You have to understand that I

[15:40] used to always be the paid ads guy. All right. But as I've had more experience and as I have dealt

[15:44] with bigger and bigger businesses and I've had mentors that I've paid lots and lots of money for

[15:48] and I look more than anything at the businesses that they have and how they are enduring. I have now

[15:53] witnessed and lived through this transition to being all about paid ads and transitioned to all

[15:59] or most of our efforts towards two, three, four, five, six as the ways and I can tell you I

[16:04] sleep great at night, knowing that I have all of these leverage ways of getting customers that will

[16:09] happen inevitably. And if it happens inevitably, then it means I have less risk. If I have less risk,

[16:15] then I sleep well. If I have less risk, then I have less risk. If I have less risk, then I have

[16:17] more valuable. It becomes more sellable. If I choose to do that in the future. And all of this is

[16:21] because of how we see client acquisition. And so anyways, my friends keeping amazing, lots of love,

[16:28] I make this stuff because I know there's a lot of broke people in the world and I don't want

[16:31] you to be one of them. As I said, I have this book. It's 99 cents. It's because the cheapest

[16:36] the platform will allow me to put it on. You can blame Jeffy. Be for that. Jeffy. And so it's cool.

[16:42] I've got people from all over the world who are not in the best economies who have been able to.

[16:46] I've been messaging me until I appreciate that. I make my money from the portfolio companies that we have.

[16:51] I'm not selling courses. That book also comes with the course, the course is free. It's free.

[16:54] You don't have to opt in for anything. It's just there. You can watch. You can zoom the downloads.

[16:58] I do this because I believe that the way to save the world is through business and capitalism

[17:03] and enterprises that are serving the public in a good way. So keeping amazing, hit subscribe.

[17:09] If you liked this and if you didn't, I just I love you anyways and I'll see you in the next video.

[17:14] Bye!

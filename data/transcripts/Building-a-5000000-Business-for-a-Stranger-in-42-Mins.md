## Full Transcript
[00:00] If you doubled revenue across all of these, you'd already be at five.

[00:02] And that's probably about six months before.

[00:04] Yeah.

[00:06] So this is Raymond.

[00:07] He's a car factory.

[00:08] Just $5 million a year.

[00:09] And this is Alex.

[00:10] I'm an investor.

[00:10] And I make all the money that I have a golden share with diamonds

[00:13] that I sit on at bed.

[00:14] And I just count how much money you have.

[00:15] And the point of today is I'm going to try and help Raymond

[00:17] take his chain to the next level.

[00:19] Hey, Alex, my name's Raymond Cooner.

[00:21] I'm the founder of a carer first of Washington.

[00:23] So just a little bit above my business.

[00:25] We currently have six brick and mortar locations.

[00:27] Trilling 12 months, revving you 5.2 million.

[00:30] You better run roughly 1.2 million.

[00:32] And our net profit is about 23%.

[00:34] Do you buy those for due open up organic?

[00:37] So far, I bought all of them.

[00:38] Oh, really?

[00:39] Yeah.

[00:39] What I think moving forward moving at change

[00:40] is rather easy a little bit.

[00:41] So overall, the company is doing well,

[00:43] 5.2 million, 23% margin, healthy.

[00:45] I was curious whether he opened them organically

[00:48] or he bought them because there's basically

[00:50] two big expenses strategy, either buy or you build.

[00:52] And so he chose a buy strategy.

[00:54] That initial kind of sorting told me,

[00:56] okay, these are the types of questions and problems

[00:58] I need to look out for as you go through the rest of the presentation.

[01:00] So what's the goal?

[01:01] My three-year goal is to try to get to $5 million,

[01:03] even though I'm not going to try to build a business

[01:05] deck and run individually.

[01:07] But then I also want to entertain selling

[01:09] to the institutional buyer.

[01:10] So this is very much a priority.

[01:11] What we talk about.

[01:12] So when someone says they're trying to build a disselet

[01:14] versus build it to keep it, I see both of those

[01:16] is basically the same path.

[01:18] It just shows how much they want to work

[01:19] like super long term either way, all paths

[01:22] lead to building a better business.

[01:23] So who do you help specifically?

[01:24] Our key demographic that we help is 35 to 65 year old men

[01:27] and women that have some kind of condition

[01:29] that we can help with whether it's our hang, discomfort,

[01:32] or loss of women.

[01:33] And insurance for cash.

[01:34] We're busing 75% insurance.

[01:36] Oh, interesting.

[01:37] Okay, how do you help them?

[01:39] So the way we help them is when someone comes into our office

[01:42] we'll design a custom treatment plan for them.

[01:44] That might be over a period of 60 to 90 days.

[01:47] It might include carapactic, rehab,

[01:49] and spinal decompression.

[01:50] So spinal decompression kind of differentiates us

[01:53] from a lot of our competitors

[01:54] because it's a niche service that we offer

[01:57] for people that have disculated injuries.

[01:59] Is that like stretching people, I kind of think?

[02:01] Yeah, okay.

[02:02] Exactly.

[02:02] Well, how do you make money?

[02:04] Our offer.

[02:05] So basically on the front end, we offer a free consultation.

[02:07] So then when the patient comes in, our packages can

[02:10] range from 2400 to 3600 over a 60 to 90 day period.

[02:14] We're primarily a reoccurring revenue model.

[02:17] And roughly one out of every seven of our patients,

[02:20] they come in for a larger case value,

[02:22] so it's a car accident or work injury,

[02:24] might be worth up to $10,000.

[02:26] Well, right off the bat, I think the reason

[02:27] that he's been able to expand

[02:29] is that he's making a decent amount of money.

[02:31] And so typical carpractors who don't know business

[02:34] will sell one crack at the back at a time,

[02:37] where he's already selling high ticket packages,

[02:39] which is the right direction to go for a premium service.

[02:42] And he obviously has a super premium

[02:43] with this whole kind of insurance $10,000 thing.

[02:45] And so it's like right off the bat,

[02:46] this price points are right.

[02:47] What's advertising?

[02:48] How do you find him?

[02:49] We're paid advertising.

[02:50] Number one is Facebook ads, though we spend about a thousand

[02:53] bucks per location on that.

[02:55] The second one is Google ads,

[02:56] so we're spending roughly 500 to a thousand

[02:58] from our done on each location.

[02:59] Okay, got it.

[03:01] So what sales will I say?

[03:02] How many do you sell per month?

[03:03] On average, we're getting about 35 leads per month.

[03:07] And out of the 35, we have 28 that show.

[03:11] Okay, let's bring it in.

[03:11] And then we have a show where you'd about 80%.

[03:13] That's great.

[03:14] And our closing weight is about 71%.

[03:16] So total sales probably run 20.

[03:18] Cool.

[03:19] So right off the bat, Raymond's got really strong show rates,

[03:22] exceptionally strong clothes rates.

[03:24] And mind you, this is one location,

[03:25] so we'll see if that's system one.

[03:27] Which stand on some part of my mind, I'm like,

[03:28] okay, when you have super high clothes rates like that,

[03:30] we might need to bun prices.

[03:31] Like it just shows that the market is willing to spend more.

[03:34] And so for me, like I would say healthy clothes rate percentage

[03:37] is usually like 30 to 40%.

[03:39] That's kind of like usually where you find the sweet spot

[03:41] of price versus number of units sold.

[03:43] Not always, but that tends to be like a rule of thumb.

[03:45] But by and large, it shows that he knows how to get people

[03:47] to shop and he knows how to close.

[03:48] I was saying the way it was the problem.

[03:50] If I were to prioritize my constraints,

[03:52] what I think there are number one I would say is probably

[03:55] leave low.

[03:56] I think that we could do better in that department.

[03:58] It's not consistent.

[04:00] What I had one location, it was really easy to predict that

[04:03] and to change the outcome pretty quickly.

[04:05] But as we've scaled, I'm having a tougher and tougher time

[04:08] to scale the market.

[04:10] What Raymond's dealing with is super common

[04:12] when you go from one location to multiple,

[04:13] especially if it's purchased, let alone organically grown.

[04:16] Because usually I call it founder magic or owner magic.

[04:19] It's like if you have one location,

[04:20] it's like your thumb prints on it.

[04:21] Your heart beats on it, everybody knows you.

[04:23] They kind of grump with you, everyone kind of knows your vibe.

[04:25] You have old customers, you remember you.

[04:26] And so it's like always can be special and different

[04:28] than everyone that you open after that.

[04:29] Because your tip of it is not nearly as entrenched.

[04:31] Second one will be like our sales infrastructure

[04:33] because we are 75% insurance-based.

[04:36] There's so many different plans out there, right?

[04:38] So we have, well, the patient comes in.

[04:41] We have to determine what kind of insurance they have

[04:43] by verifying it and then make a customized plan

[04:45] based off of that.

[04:46] So if there's a way to streamline that into one day,

[04:49] I think it'll be much more effective for us.

[04:51] When I personally practiced,

[04:52] I was able to do it in one day,

[04:54] but I'm having a tough time training my doctors

[04:56] to be able to do that.

[04:57] Okay, and then people operations.

[04:59] People operations, so obviously when I had one location,

[05:02] it was really easy to control the standard, right?

[05:04] But as we expand it's harder and harder

[05:06] to have that same standard.

[05:08] Okay, show us the numbers.

[05:09] So going over the numbers again,

[05:11] so top line revenue, five point two million last fall months,

[05:14] profit, 1.2, that margin is about 23%.

[05:18] Our cac is about 700, our lifetime values, 3,400.

[05:22] So that's 4.8 to 1, LTV to CACWASHO.

[05:26] Marketing spend, we're spending about 1500 to 2000 per location right now.

[05:29] The show rates 80%, close rates 71%

[05:32] and our annual ad spend on marketing is about 110,000.

[05:35] So right off the bat, I've seen the numbers are really strong.

[05:38] The amount that he spending per location seems low,

[05:40] given how much money he's making.

[05:42] So I think there's probably opportunity there,

[05:43] but I'm just very curious how it actually breaks down

[05:45] between locations, because that'll probably give us more insight.

[05:48] Huh, okay, Jimmy, anything broken up between channels,

[05:51] between Facebook and Google?

[05:53] So this is our Facebook data.

[05:56] I was able to put together like our 12 month numbers

[05:59] for all the clinics, for ad, and then for as far as the challenge

[06:03] that we have is because we're insurance based,

[06:05] we don't get paid for like 30, 60, 90 days after.

[06:08] So I had to go back and I picked Q2 for three clinics.

[06:10] Yeah, okay.

[06:12] So these are the numbers for those three clinics in quarter two.

[06:16] So looking at this whole sheet, I scanned it,

[06:18] and then the bottom where you can see Q2 there,

[06:20] it's capital hill ever in Kent.

[06:22] And so can you see an eight row as there?

[06:24] So that was really strong.

[06:25] The lowest cac by decent margin.

[06:28] And so I wanted to understand whether that was a performance thing

[06:30] or like a just cost less because of a market play,

[06:32] a cost-per-impression CPMs are lower there.

[06:34] There's much to be more people.

[06:35] I wanted to double click into that to figure out

[06:37] why that one's doing so much better than the others.

[06:38] Okay, so why is Kent so much better?

[06:40] Is the dock there different than the other dock?

[06:42] They're about the, he's good, but he's about to stay.

[06:45] I would say that culture of that team is really good.

[06:48] I think that's one thing that stands out.

[06:50] Cause cac is half of capital hill, right?

[06:53] We're getting more LTV and lower cac at Kent.

[06:55] Right.

[06:56] Is it that the people that are coming,

[06:57] because it's insurance so is that they're like billing better?

[07:01] Like how could they get LTV to be so much higher?

[07:03] Do you have any other data that you've collected together?

[07:06] Yeah, so this one Google AdWords.

[07:07] Well, these obviously do significantly better

[07:09] than your Facebook ads.

[07:10] Yeah, for sure.

[07:11] Interesting.

[07:12] So right off the bat, look all the way to the right.

[07:15] Row as me is return on Antspend.

[07:16] CC 12 to 12 to 19 to one.

[07:18] I'm seeing really strong row as here.

[07:20] And some thinking, okay, so if I have a machine

[07:22] that I can put a dollar and get $24 back out,

[07:24] I want to put as much money that machine is

[07:26] seem really like possible.

[07:26] And so that's why my next question,

[07:28] I'm asking if how much more can we spend here?

[07:30] This is obviously a profitable channel.

[07:31] Are you maxed out on spend here?

[07:33] I don't think I am.

[07:34] I work with a third party company on this

[07:37] and I basically go off their recommendations.

[07:40] I personally would love to spend more obviously on this

[07:42] because they were trying to lie.

[07:44] And these people are in, you know,

[07:46] and we didn't need to help.

[07:47] Yeah, so there are a bunch of these.

[07:48] You're quote, there are case acceptance

[07:49] goes up much higher.

[07:51] These patients high in tech.

[07:52] Yeah, yeah.

[07:53] Really good.

[07:54] Well, I mean, this is the most promising part.

[07:56] So if you think about people's willingness to pay

[07:58] being proportional to their spending power

[08:01] and the pain that they're experiencing with it.

[08:03] Now, he literally has people in pain.

[08:05] And so when you have someone who's being in corruption based,

[08:07] that means like they're just scrolling around

[08:08] and they see an ad, they're probably not as in pain

[08:11] as somebody who's like, oh, I just did something

[08:13] to my back, they're on Google.

[08:14] They're searching for a solution immediately.

[08:16] So the intentions are completely different

[08:18] or rather they're significantly stronger

[08:20] with people that are actually looking for the solution.

[08:22] And so I would wager that those people by faster,

[08:25] they buy bigger tickets and we'll see if that's true.

[08:27] Walk, walk me through the sales process.

[08:29] So if they want, Pisha comes in, we do a consultation.

[08:32] We take X-rays, we'll do an exam.

[08:34] Actually, it's starting from click to close.

[08:35] So the person clicks on is Google is basically

[08:39] the sales process for Google ads

[08:40] different in the sales process for MENA

[08:41] or how's it, how's it flow for you?

[08:43] Yeah, so Google, they will call directly

[08:45] into our, we have a centralized call center.

[08:48] Okay.

[08:49] So the call is, click to call is the ad.

[08:51] Click to call or click to schedule on our web,

[08:53] or they go to our landing page.

[08:54] Okay, so click to call or they self-book, got it.

[08:57] So then they, they talk to a rep that centralized.

[09:00] They have rep-dissum sort of discovery call.

[09:01] Do they look at their insurance at that point on the call?

[09:03] They don't, but that's the thing I'm thinking of adding in.

[09:06] So they can't get on top of that.

[09:07] Do they, they just some sort of discovery.

[09:08] They're currently not doing insurance on the call.

[09:10] Yep.

[09:11] All right, so then they do what?

[09:12] So then they've got to the next available file.

[09:15] We try to get them in same day or next day right away.

[09:17] So some people call and then they book them

[09:19] and the people who self-skidges will just book drive them.

[09:21] Exactly.

[09:22] And then what's the, what's the kind of like reminder

[09:24] sequence there to make sure that?

[09:25] Because you have really good shop rates.

[09:26] Yeah, so we do three tax messages.

[09:28] Okay.

[09:29] And then we do a phone call.

[09:30] If they don't respond to tax messages,

[09:32] they do a phone call the night before.

[09:33] To confirm, we'll do another one like two hours before their,

[09:35] they'll put it.

[09:36] So Raymond is describing what appears to be very boring work.

[09:39] But is one of the biggest levers that I look at that is

[09:42] often huge holes of revenue for most small businesses

[09:44] that they simply just don't work their leads either well enough

[09:46] fast enough or hard enough.

[09:47] They're not responding to them quickly.

[09:49] They're not personalizing the reach outs.

[09:51] They're not doing it multiple times and they're not doing it

[09:53] in a timely fashion relative to when they're coming in.

[09:56] And so he clearly had a system for working leads,

[09:59] like, be texting these three times this and we do this.

[10:01] And so as soon as someone demonstrates that, I'm like,

[10:03] okay, there's probably not immediate holes in low-heating fruit

[10:06] there and his number's kind of supported that.

[10:08] Said differently, when you see 80% show rates,

[10:11] you've got somebody who knows how to work leads.

[10:13] Okay, so three reminders and call if they have not

[10:16] confirmed their requirement and follow up call as well

[10:18] if they stood and pick up the first call or the other ones.

[10:20] And then if someone doesn't hit any of those five

[10:22] do you pull them off the calendar?

[10:23] We don't pull them off the calendar,

[10:24] but we kind of expect them not to just like that

[10:26] we'll book kind of.

[10:27] Yeah, we would down the ground real.

[10:28] Okay, okay, so then they come in,

[10:31] so they show up to the appointment.

[10:32] No, what?

[10:33] They come in for their appointment.

[10:34] We'll do a consultation.

[10:35] So we have a patient coordinator that gets a preliminary data.

[10:39] So they're getting assessment.

[10:40] Yeah, so they can move in, like move here,

[10:42] does that hurt?

[10:43] That kind of thing, like Jericho where you have pain.

[10:44] Kind of like after Closer framework.

[10:46] Okay.

[10:46] So they'll do the first half of that on there.

[10:48] And then they'll take X-rays, we'll do an exam.

[10:51] And then we'll tell the patient that,

[10:52] hey, we need to process these films or these X-rays

[10:55] and then we need to get you back into tomorrow.

[10:57] So we'd go over the results of the data.

[10:59] Yeah, that's really a lot of some people.

[11:00] Yeah, that's not it.

[11:01] Okay.

[11:02] So then we'll release them for,

[11:03] what we'll still do treatment that day,

[11:05] we'll do a light treatment.

[11:06] And then we'll have them come back the next day.

[11:07] And by then, we'll have everything verified.

[11:10] And then we'll have a customized plan for them.

[11:12] And then we'll identify the training.

[11:13] Can you walk me through the ad funnel

[11:15] with the Facebook ads?

[11:17] We have a video ad out there.

[11:18] Do you have ads live right now?

[11:19] Yeah.

[11:20] Can you upload Facebook ads live?

[11:22] We're going to pull them up and we're going to see it.

[11:24] We're going to see, we're going to see for ourselves.

[11:26] So we've different creative.

[11:28] It looks like it's the same copy.

[11:30] All right.

[11:31] So I think there's probably just some work

[11:32] that could just happen on the actual ads themselves.

[11:34] Like I think you can have a clearer call out.

[11:36] And the first line, I would probably separate the call outs.

[11:39] So it's like, it's just your ever-insurring areas.

[11:42] So it's interesting areas, I would go to like residents

[11:44] or something like, are people like basically combine the two,

[11:47] whereas as chronic badfms,

[11:48] it's enough to have life sentence,

[11:49] attention efforts from yours.

[11:50] So if you like, attention ever, like,

[11:52] residents with back pain.

[11:53] That combines both lines, punchier, put two answers

[11:55] on either side.

[11:56] Okay, that's what it is.

[11:57] And you're putting proof first,

[11:59] and I probably wouldn't hear.

[12:00] I probably lead with a question,

[12:03] which should be like, are you?

[12:04] So either I would lead with a question

[12:05] that'd be some sort of like more specific pain,

[12:08] or I would lead with the offer.

[12:09] And then have the proof of why they should believe

[12:11] that I can help them after they've seen the offer.

[12:14] Because like it took us all the way down

[12:15] to actually see what the offer was.

[12:16] Got it.

[12:17] In the headline, if you scroll away down,

[12:19] like all, avoid surgery, tribe, spinal and decompression.

[12:21] I would probably just put like the offer there.

[12:23] So it's just like a restame of like free spinal,

[12:26] decompression, boom.

[12:27] Not in an all about whatever.

[12:28] So like that's probably what I would.

[12:30] But I would put there.

[12:31] There's a lot of words.

[12:32] And I think you could probably get just like I combined

[12:34] the first, the headline and the next sentence

[12:36] into just like attention,

[12:37] ever it, residents with back pain.

[12:39] Right, it's like boom, we got that.

[12:41] And it's like, it'd be amazing how much like just changing

[12:44] tweaking the headline, probably compressing the copy

[12:47] into a handful of bullets.

[12:48] It's like, do you struggle with?

[12:50] Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom,

[12:51] and you've probably tried, boom, boom, boom, boom,

[12:53] but there's a better way.

[12:55] This is how we do it.

[12:56] We've helped this many people for limited time.

[12:58] We're doing X, Y, and Z.

[12:59] And I think that would probably work well.

[13:02] I cannot guarantee availability

[13:03] we can accommodate 10 vouchers of drill for a patient schedule.

[13:05] I do like that, probably you can be compressed.

[13:07] Okay, like we can only see a 10 new patients per week,

[13:10] but scheduling the abilities first come for a serve

[13:12] for this treatment done.

[13:13] So I'm walking Raymond through some improvements to Zads

[13:16] that I wrote a book on advertising

[13:18] and in the pay that section,

[13:19] the first part of a re-ad is a call out, right?

[13:21] It's getting people to notice the most important

[13:23] the ad, right?

[13:24] That's what this is.

[13:24] So the call out is whatever you do to get

[13:26] the attention of your audience.

[13:27] And so there's kind of four ways that I like to do it

[13:30] and the way that I'm presenting for him here

[13:31] is a yes question, right?

[13:33] Which is like it's almost implied.

[13:34] So we're saying this audience of people

[13:36] which is local area and then they're like,

[13:38] do you have back pain or who have back pain

[13:40] is kind of an implied yes?

[13:41] And then we're leading with that for the call out,

[13:43] which is the most important part of every ad

[13:45] is the only thing that's been going to read.

[13:46] So once you have the call out,

[13:47] I use a what who went framework

[13:49] when I'm thinking through ad copying.

[13:51] And so he's talking about a void surgery.

[13:53] So this is opposite nightmare scenario, right?

[13:55] And so you can basically construct your ads

[13:58] by piecing these parts together in the ad copy.

[14:00] And then obviously we want to have the offer very clear.

[14:04] When we get to the offer section,

[14:05] that's where we need to tell them what to do next

[14:07] which is kind of the last part of the ad.

[14:08] One of the reasons I love doing these

[14:10] is that I get to take some of the experience

[14:11] that I've had from years of work

[14:12] and actually just help other people out.

[14:14] And so one, I had a chain of six locations.

[14:16] So I had to work leads and get people to show up all the time

[14:19] and write ads to get people to do that.

[14:21] And then secondly, we had a licensing business

[14:23] that licensed the thousands of brick and mortar locations.

[14:25] And so I had to solve these problems at scale

[14:27] across many different markets.

[14:28] And so the nice thing is the patterns are the same

[14:31] and you just have to execute them.

[14:32] And so I'm glad that I could share.

[14:33] Let's get to schedule an appointment.

[14:36] Kind.

[14:41] Okay, so we just go straight to the,

[14:42] straight to the, okay.

[14:43] Okay.

[14:44] I would say most of our patients

[14:45] schedule like that versus call.

[14:47] There's a couple of things that I think we can go over

[14:49] in terms of sales process, lead magnets,

[14:52] things like that.

[14:53] Honestly, I think a big part of it that's not up here is the ops.

[14:57] In this type of business, it's so operational,

[14:59] heavy in terms of like on operational excellence.

[15:01] I had a bunch that if he has the same model

[15:05] at all these locations and some of the locations aren't

[15:07] profitable and some of them are,

[15:09] the biggest lever is he and be the people

[15:10] who are actually running the system.

[15:11] So I have to be really particular about what recommendations

[15:14] I'm going to make if there's very weak ops and execution

[15:17] behind it.

[15:18] And so one, it's going to limit the things

[15:19] that I'm going to do and change the priorities

[15:21] of what I'm going to recommend.

[15:22] And so a lot of times, this is so,

[15:23] it's like, oh, I need to change my strategy

[15:25] when the reality is that the team's just not good enough

[15:27] and you need to focus on the team rather than the model.

[15:29] You absolutely can run a 10 to 1, 15 to 1,

[15:33] you know, row at, oh, you're doing a Google

[15:35] but you can do that on Facebook as well.

[15:38] If the offers write.

[15:39] And so right now, the offers like,

[15:40] they're really isn't one,

[15:41] which is just like, try this thing.

[15:43] It doesn't even say free.

[15:44] Once you come over here in the world,

[15:45] we'll walk through the game.

[15:46] Go.

[15:47] All right, let's go.

[15:48] There's inconsistently flow.

[15:50] There's the sales process that I want to look at.

[15:52] I think the discovery process

[15:54] needs something need a better front end offer

[15:57] and crusade spend.

[15:58] So those are the really tactical things

[16:00] that I'll walk through.

[16:01] I think that we're going to look at lead magnet.

[16:05] I think this needs to be better for ads.

[16:10] Let's offer this number one.

[16:13] Number two is, yeah, copy.

[16:18] Number three.

[16:19] I think we're going to go, I think the,

[16:22] disco process, do you see what I'm saying?

[16:25] The discovery.

[16:26] All right, number four.

[16:29] Sponsis.

[16:33] Do you have fun anything?

[16:34] Under, you don't have fun.

[16:35] It's easier insurance.

[16:36] We do, we do, so the decompression is cash.

[16:38] So we do offer financing.

[16:39] Okay, do you have a third party?

[16:41] Yeah, okay, cool.

[16:41] Then I want to work with them.

[16:42] So Raymond has, obviously,

[16:44] he's got a successful business.

[16:45] He's doing 5 million top line, 1.3 bottom line.

[16:47] So he's not, he's not doing bad.

[16:49] And so a lot of my questions were proven questions

[16:51] to see if there was low hanging

[16:52] for that already exists in the business

[16:54] that we could kind of tweak and immediately

[16:56] increase the profit and revenue of the business.

[16:57] And so these are the kind of holes that

[17:00] from asking the questions like,

[17:01] we could improve something here.

[17:02] Oh, we can improve something there.

[17:03] Sometimes I asked and you, I was like,

[17:05] no, that's good, you got it.

[17:06] All right, and we'll go on to the next thing.

[17:07] And so to be clear, it's not like I'm trying to say

[17:09] like he has all these things wrong.

[17:10] He's making money.

[17:11] He's making more than $1 a year.

[17:12] Like he's obviously good at business.

[17:14] And so I'm just trying to find the things

[17:15] that I think I can add value that are ideally

[17:18] low operational risk for him to execute.

[17:20] Raymond's actually on level six,

[17:23] which is all the way over there,

[17:23] my arms not that long, of the scaling roadmap.

[17:26] He's at 20 to 49 employees, right,

[17:29] between all of his locations.

[17:30] And to get to 50, he has to do some of these steps.

[17:33] Now, if we're looking at the constraints of his business,

[17:35] we can see here that he's having this sales issue.

[17:38] So what sales issues occur at level six?

[17:41] Well, closing efficiency on core product draft

[17:44] becomes inconsistent.

[17:45] Reef ones go down, but so do closets.

[17:46] And so he's in this situation right now,

[17:48] just right out of the book.

[17:49] I'm telling you, like we spend a long time with this.

[17:51] And business is behaving patterns.

[17:52] And so to graduate, he has to install better sales

[17:55] training, individual coaching, and a team cadence

[17:58] for making sure that they're operating at KPI or above.

[18:01] So keep a performance indicator, KPI.

[18:02] And so this is what he has to do at this level.

[18:04] And if you're a business owner and you're curious,

[18:07] what stage you're at and what things are kind of plaguing you,

[18:10] we probably know your problems.

[18:11] But how to graduate to the next level

[18:13] and how to solve them, this scaling roadmap is totally free

[18:16] and it's personalized to you.

[18:17] So you can go to Acquisition.com,

[18:19] Ford slash roadmap, just type in your business info.

[18:21] And we will send you the stage that is specific to you

[18:25] across all eight functions of the business.

[18:26] So product marketing sales, customer service, IT recruiting,

[18:30] HR, and finance.

[18:31] You'll have all the problems and the solutions

[18:33] to get the next level.

[18:34] It's one of the most valuable things

[18:34] I can give you, it's absolutely free.

[18:36] Go check it out.

[18:36] And if you, by the way, want to have us take a look

[18:40] at your business on the thank you page,

[18:42] you can book a call, you can come out to our headquarters

[18:44] and our team would love to kind of do

[18:46] what we do here with you.

[18:48] OK, so we're going to start.

[18:50] Let's actually, I think that's actually not about where.

[18:53] OK, so starting with the lead magnet,

[18:56] I think that offering $19, $29 somewhere in there,

[19:01] first consult or free x-ray or something

[19:03] that extent will probably go way better.

[19:06] And I do, like, especially for your type of business

[19:09] to do a low ticket and say it's something like this.

[19:12] It'll be like $20 x-ray plus assessment of a walk.

[19:20] And the reason I like this is because you get the credit card

[19:24] on the phone.

[19:26] And even though it's an insurance thing,

[19:27] it's like, yeah, no worries.

[19:28] We just put a card down just for Shoprate.

[19:30] Obviously, we have a doctor who's going to be there

[19:32] which is going to make sure that you're going to shop.

[19:33] And the thing is, if we build in the 29,

[19:35] then the likely right shop is super high.

[19:37] And this is literally just to take Shoprate

[19:39] so like basically 100% of it.

[19:40] So then, and this is over the phone.

[19:42] So this, you do, that's a phone.

[19:44] I did this in front of some Gen Z kids and they're like,

[19:46] what's that?

[19:47] That was like, Jesus.

[19:48] All right.

[19:49] You'll recognize it.

[19:50] So we do this.

[19:51] Now, when they walk in the door, okay?

[19:52] So this is going to be a little bit of a departure.

[19:54] Okay.

[19:54] So they walk in the door.

[19:56] And when you, and I think the reason that you probably

[20:00] sold better obviously your better at sales

[20:02] and probably your docs are.

[20:03] But if you think about how sales works.

[20:06] So sales, you want to sell at the point of greatest pain,

[20:09] not the point of greatest satisfaction.

[20:11] So let's say to be a normal person

[20:13] they're right at the middle of this line.

[20:15] Now they're having a bad day because now they're in pain.

[20:19] Then all of a sudden they get something fixed

[20:20] they're even better than normal.

[20:22] If your salesman, where do you sell?

[20:24] Do you sell when they're here, when they're in pain,

[20:26] or do you sell here, when they're super happy

[20:29] at the point of greatest satisfaction?

[20:31] So do you sell at point of greatest deprivation?

[20:33] Or point of greatest satisfaction?

[20:35] A.K.

[20:36] Pain or value.

[20:38] Where do you sell?

[20:40] Here.

[20:41] So if I, let's see you walk in my restaurant.

[20:44] And you're starving.

[20:46] And I say, hey, here's a steak and you eat the steak.

[20:49] And then after you eat the steak, I say,

[20:51] hey, how was the steak?

[20:52] You say, oh my gosh, the best steak in my life.

[20:53] Amazing.

[20:54] And I say, great, would you like another steak?

[20:56] You might be like, I mean, no, but I mean,

[20:57] hey, the steak was great.

[20:58] Like, I'm not saying the steak was better.

[21:00] Like, why don't you want to buy another steak?

[21:01] You said he was so good.

[21:02] Why don't you want to buy another steak?

[21:03] Does this sound familiar?

[21:04] Because I hear some sales calls from businesses

[21:06] like, well, if it was good, there weren't you buying more.

[21:09] Because you're selling at the wrong time.

[21:10] Now, let's play the, let's play the take back.

[21:12] You walk in the restaurant, you're starving.

[21:14] I say, hey, how hungry are you saying I'm starving?

[21:17] And I say, cool, you want two steaks?

[21:19] You're probably like, hell, yeah, I want two steaks.

[21:20] I'm starving.

[21:21] And then I sell you two steaks.

[21:23] You sell the point of greatest pain,

[21:25] not the point of greatest satisfaction.

[21:26] Now, here's where it gets tricky.

[21:28] Sometimes the point of greatest satisfaction

[21:33] for one thing becomes the point of greatest pain for another.

[21:37] So if all of a sudden, I help you make more money.

[21:41] For example, then all of a sudden, you have a new problem,

[21:45] which is you have taxes.

[21:47] And then I say, hey, with all that extra money that you made,

[21:49] I can introduce you to somebody who can help you

[21:51] with your taxes, do you want that?

[21:52] Yes.

[21:53] And so where people conflate this in terms of orders,

[21:56] you have to make sure that if you're doing an upsell

[21:58] at the point of greatest satisfaction,

[22:00] it's opening the loop of pain for the next problem

[22:02] that you're going to solve through your next problem.

[22:05] And so it's kind of the same thing here,

[22:06] where people are literally coming in pain,

[22:08] but ideally what I would want to do is,

[22:10] we take the assessment.

[22:12] Instead of doing the treatment then,

[22:15] I want to sell the package.

[22:17] Got it.

[22:18] Then if you want, if they have time,

[22:19] they can do it, or they can come back tomorrow

[22:20] and get their first treatment.

[22:21] Got it.

[22:22] So it's the same time scale, we just move the order out.

[22:24] I really don't know.

[22:25] Because, I mean, I've been this patient.

[22:27] So I go to a contractor.

[22:29] They do something, I'm in pain.

[22:31] They just my back and then they're like,

[22:33] hey, come back for this, but I was like,

[22:35] I'm like, you fixed it, I'm great.

[22:36] Yeah, yeah, I told you.

[22:37] Right?

[22:38] But it's not a long-term solution.

[22:40] I'm like, good enough for me.

[22:41] You know, like an item out.

[22:42] And so that might be an immediate like 15,

[22:45] you know, 10 to 15% boost in sales.

[22:46] So like, that's number one.

[22:48] But the thing is is that I think that your closurates

[22:50] are going to go up.

[22:50] So one is like, you're losing someone

[22:52] to drop off, right?

[22:53] But I think closurates are going up.

[22:54] And like when you're in pain,

[22:56] you're desire for a more like all the desires there

[23:00] in that moment and we're emotions there.

[23:01] We're missing it, though.

[23:02] Hey guys, this channel, I make for you business owners.

[23:06] This is all I do every day.

[23:08] This is what I love.

[23:09] I'm so excited about this new series.

[23:11] And so if you have other business owner friends

[23:13] that could benefit from some of the tactics

[23:14] because these tactics work across lots of different

[23:16] industries, not just car directors, right?

[23:18] It would mean the world's me if you just put into a text

[23:20] and you text into them or you share it to them

[23:22] in the DM because it ultimately helps more businesses

[23:25] get better and I believe we're private enterprise

[23:27] and I think that's how the world could save

[23:29] no one else has come for us.

[23:30] All right, back to the video.

[23:30] I always had this rule, with finnists

[23:32] that someone walks in the door first thing I want them to do

[23:35] is expand the gap of where they are, where they want to be.

[23:37] So like everybody hop on the scale.

[23:38] The amount of people's like, oh, I don't want to hop on this.

[23:40] Like good, I know I'm like, get on the scale.

[23:42] We got to know we're just a no, we got to know we're at.

[23:43] That makes sense.

[23:44] And so it's the same idea with this.

[23:46] Okay.

[23:46] So lead Maggie in terms of off ride,

[23:49] do you think this would be good.

[23:50] This will increase show up rates overall,

[23:52] getting somebody to get a $20 credit card

[23:53] purchased with phone is like not hard.

[23:55] But they do that.

[23:56] That secures their spot.

[23:57] Then when they come in, we do same day sale.

[24:03] Now what has been the issue with the docs making this sale?

[24:08] Like you said they struggled with this.

[24:09] So there's two elements.

[24:10] You said there is insurance like some insurance up there.

[24:12] So what do you ask the issue here?

[24:13] Yeah. So the issue is a patient comes in

[24:15] and then we have to verify the benefits.

[24:17] So there's like 20 different insurance and every patient has

[24:19] a different like coverage or whatever right.

[24:21] Yeah. So then we got to we have to make our dream of plan

[24:24] then take out whatever the insurance covers and then maybe

[24:27] the their co-pay to co-enterates.

[24:29] So just doing that process.

[24:30] Yeah.

[24:30] I think when they're on the floor,

[24:32] seeing patients and then having to switch gears and do the math

[24:36] of like what this, you know, here's my recommendations.

[24:37] There's you know, all that.

[24:39] I think that part kind of stresses them out.

[24:40] How much of is templated?

[24:42] Most of it's like as far as the.

[24:44] So we have a we know that someone has blue cross ratio.

[24:47] So whatever.

[24:48] Yeah.

[24:48] It's all excelscredible.

[24:49] We could punch a number.

[24:50] We'll have an extra calculator for that.

[24:51] So questions.

[24:51] So someone calls.

[24:53] So basically there's two spots that we can put this process.

[24:56] So either we can do it on the phone with the disco.

[24:58] Yeah.

[24:59] Or we can do it the moment they walk in the door.

[25:02] So it would work like this.

[25:03] So someone walks in and say, hey, do you have your idea on you?

[25:05] I just want to confirm your appointment.

[25:06] Yes, I'm Sarah.

[25:07] Cool.

[25:07] Great.

[25:08] But do you have your insurance card on you?

[25:09] Yeah.

[25:10] And so you asked that.

[25:11] Yeah.

[25:11] That way we can get the templates already like ready to go.

[25:13] Right.

[25:13] So that then the dot goes.

[25:15] Yeah.

[25:15] And then he leaves them in there and says,

[25:17] cool, let me get the x-rays.

[25:18] Yeah.

[25:18] And then he comes in with the x-rays and with the

[25:20] template for their specific insurance.

[25:22] Totally.

[25:23] And then you can just match them and just do the sale.

[25:24] Yeah.

[25:25] So the issue is like some of those some of those.

[25:27] So I centralize where they verify those benefits.

[25:29] Right.

[25:30] Some look and take like 30 minutes to an hour.

[25:32] Okay.

[25:32] So if the gas best of.

[25:34] Okay.

[25:34] So then we have to do the phone.

[25:36] Yeah.

[25:36] I agree.

[25:36] So what we're trying to do here is we're trying to decrease the friction

[25:40] associated with them giving us money.

[25:43] And so there are three major levers to providing value.

[25:47] The fourth is obviously the dream outcome that they want to have to want.

[25:50] What you're selling.

[25:51] Right.

[25:51] But the other three correspond to the risk.

[25:55] Okay.

[25:55] And the perceived likelihood achievement.

[25:56] How long they have to wait and what they've got to do that they

[25:59] don't want to do or they got to stop doing that they do want to do.

[26:01] Okay.

[26:01] ease or difficulty.

[26:02] So you want it to be easy.

[26:03] You want to be fast.

[26:04] You want to be risk free.

[26:05] What we're doing here is saying,

[26:06] okay, well, he had this big delay in the process that people had to wait

[26:09] another day in order to get the solution presented to them.

[26:12] And so wouldn't it be better if we could just have that happen prior to

[26:15] them coming in so that from a speed perspective and a friction perspective,

[26:18] they don't have to do anything besides say yes.

[26:21] And then we can get we can get paid and they can get helped.

[26:24] And for those of you curious, that was the value of creation chapter and the

[26:26] hundred million dollars for the book.

[26:27] But the twenty and a dollar thing gets in the way.

[26:29] Yeah.

[26:30] Then we can still just do the, just like a, you can do a free off like free

[26:33] x ray for assessment, whatever.

[26:34] Just if that's an issue.

[26:36] I mean, personal preference.

[26:37] Get the credit card and the insurance.

[26:39] Okay.

[26:40] Over the phone.

[26:41] If it seems like a training issue, then I'll prioritize the

[26:42] insurance card.

[26:43] But in that way, it's like you already have everything preloaded.

[26:46] And so then they can come out after F the x rays get printed off from the

[26:49] scheduler of the front desk.

[26:50] Right.

[26:50] And I mean, shoot the morning off.

[26:52] I wanted to add the asset.

[26:53] He print all the print all the packets after everyone.

[26:56] And then the doc gets them in the clip, where do they walk in the door?

[26:58] Perfect.

[26:58] Yeah.

[26:59] I mean, you think they'll work?

[27:00] I think so.

[27:00] Okay.

[27:01] Um, the, and then if they ask like, hey, why didn't you make sure it's up on

[27:04] a twenty land bucks, then we'll say like, they just in case the

[27:06] doctor thinks he can help you.

[27:07] That's one of the lawyer insurance.

[27:09] Yeah.

[27:09] I'm sorry.

[27:09] I'll give you a different one.

[27:10] This is just how we always did.

[27:12] Okay.

[27:13] So the reason I gave Raymond that line is because it only always works.

[27:17] And I'll tell you the story behind this.

[27:18] So I used to try and sell free trials and believe it or not,

[27:22] there was a time in my life where I couldn't even get people start

[27:24] free trials.

[27:25] They literally get in their car, drive to my gym and I'd be like, hey,

[27:27] you want to start 14 day free trial.

[27:29] And they would say, yeah, if they cool, do you want to put, you know,

[27:32] your credit card down, do they be like, why do you need a credit card?

[27:34] If it's a free trial, I'd be like, I, I mean, it will, I know, I,

[27:39] I didn't know it.

[27:40] It's like, because I want to build you later.

[27:41] Like, eight, I, like, I didn't have anything to say.

[27:43] And so one time it just came out and I was like, well, this is just

[27:45] how we've always done it.

[27:46] And after I started saying that, no one objected.

[27:50] And so despite how ridiculous that may sound, it's unbelievable

[27:54] how well it works.

[27:54] So if you're in one of the situations where you have like a tiny little

[27:57] process change or something that you need to do or introduce, you

[28:00] know, into a sales process.

[28:01] This is like, why are you collecting my information?

[28:02] It's like, oh, it's how we've always done it.

[28:04] And people just know that a lot of employees just do what they're

[28:07] told or they just do whatever someone, you know, taught them to do.

[28:10] It's policy.

[28:12] And so then what they do is they just stop asking that person

[28:14] questions because they're like, it's not really up to me.

[28:16] It's just like, oh, this is how we compete our patient

[28:18] profiles.

[28:19] OK.

[28:19] Like, it's better to appeal to policy.

[28:21] Totally.

[28:22] OK.

[28:22] We'll get this.

[28:23] If this for whatever reason issue, you'll

[28:24] prioritize the insurance.

[28:26] They'll come in.

[28:27] They're going to have the printed out stack of all the insurance.

[28:30] The doc gets this on a clipboard.

[28:32] Yep.

[28:33] Right in order of the patients that you see that day.

[28:35] Perfect.

[28:36] It's like, OK, Mr. Johnson, I've got your x-rays here.

[28:38] I've got your insurance here.

[28:39] OK, this is what we're going to do for you.

[28:40] And then this prescriptive clothes.

[28:41] Makes sense.

[28:42] OK.

[28:42] So right now, are there some locations that are having way

[28:46] hard closures and others or like what's the highest

[28:48] tools, probably, we all say capital Hill and what's

[28:51] the difference though?

[28:52] The doctor has a lot of certainty.

[28:53] No, no, no percentage difference.

[28:55] Oh, so let's say Auburn is let's say they're averaging about 55

[28:59] 60%.

[29:00] OK.

[29:00] And then capital Hill might be at like 80%.

[29:03] OK.

[29:04] No, I mean, they're both OK.

[29:05] Yeah, they're terrible.

[29:06] Yeah, they're not terrible.

[29:07] But if you look at them, because a lot of these people

[29:10] have insurance, so they're entry level, like financial

[29:12] not like super high on the worst part.

[29:14] So the ones that are the 10,000 markets that have zero

[29:16] on a pocket is, I mean, you're going to have 100%.

[29:18] Yeah, so this is how I would imagine that the packages

[29:23] themselves are going to be similar.

[29:25] It's just how much it's being covered is going to be the

[29:27] difference.

[29:27] Yeah, that's how they're all right.

[29:28] Yeah.

[29:29] And then also the fact that I think if a clinic sees a lot of

[29:32] those 100% coverage ones, then they kind of skip,

[29:35] then they start, they won't work on their sales skills

[29:36] for the ones that are.

[29:37] And then they could say, oh, these are crappy leaves or

[29:39] whatever, but you just get to work a little bit for them.

[29:41] Right.

[29:42] So I think just grid in that training, that's

[29:44] all I'm going to do to train them and we'll play more.

[29:46] I'll give you something that will help you a lot with

[29:48] brick and more.

[29:49] So I've done a lot of brick and more of sales processes in my life.

[29:52] And as much as possible, I like them to be like

[29:55] clicks and check boxes.

[29:57] When we sell supplements, for example, it's like you literally

[29:59] just turn a laptop around and then you just like punch

[30:01] through it and you literally just say the words and then at

[30:03] the point that you ask for the thing you ask for the thing.

[30:05] Like you really can machine it that way.

[30:07] And that will eliminate so much of the variability between

[30:10] people.

[30:10] And so I would look at what the top 80% guys doing consistently.

[30:13] Wake that into the basically the deck so that they have

[30:16] a visual aid to go through it and then it feels like, oh, this is

[30:19] this is the next step.

[30:20] I do this.

[30:21] I just this is what you need.

[30:22] This is what we cover.

[30:23] He circles the thing on their on their thing turns it to them

[30:25] and then they they rock and roll and then they just book out

[30:28] their next appointments with them.

[30:29] So they're probably going to have a double pop

[30:31] or almost like, okay, they can show to them.

[30:33] Okay.

[30:33] So there's two ways to do it.

[30:34] One is you have the laptop and you turn it towards the

[30:37] customer and then you basically read the words on the slides.

[30:40] That is like the perfect sales pitch but with visual aids and

[30:42] whatnot.

[30:43] The second way of doing it is you have that clipboard.

[30:46] But they don't know what's on the clipboard.

[30:48] Right.

[30:49] And the clipboard just has the script.

[30:50] Got it.

[30:51] And so it's like cool.

[30:52] You see I have to couple questions.

[30:53] And so you basically go through the sales process and you

[30:56] just look like you're checking off the boxes that you're

[30:57] going through a script.

[30:58] But then they always say the script and then the doc can

[31:02] visually show this which they then staple to the patient contract.

[31:05] That way you know they follow the process and then it just

[31:08] keeps it consistent every time.

[31:09] So either of those work up done above.

[31:10] Okay.

[31:11] So leads, page 07.

[31:14] If you have employees and you want them to do what you want

[31:16] them to do, then there's three steps.

[31:18] Document.

[31:19] You make a checklist.

[31:21] Demonstrate.

[31:22] You do it in front of them.

[31:23] Duplicate.

[31:23] They do it in front of you.

[31:24] And so right now, the who's actually doing it is that he

[31:27] wasn't the salesperson.

[31:28] He did say years good at sales now and say, OK, I need you to

[31:31] document this by putting this into a checklist.

[31:33] Give it to someone else for them to follow it.

[31:35] So now that you have it in a checklist, now you follow it in front of

[31:38] them so they can you prove that the checklist works that you

[31:41] and if you keep changing things while you're not using the

[31:43] checklist, then keep changing the checklist until you

[31:45] actually follow it.

[31:46] And then once you have the checklist right, have them followed in front

[31:48] of you.

[31:49] And then once that happens, then you've been able to duplicate the

[31:51] skill in somebody else.

[31:52] And that's going to be a huge issue or rather a huge opportunity for

[31:55] Raymond in his business.

[31:56] So the next one is I think ad spend needs to go out.

[31:59] So what?

[32:01] Because you're not spending very much.

[32:02] Yeah, I know I know it wasn't till I had to do this process.

[32:05] I was like, shit, we can just give them because the recurrence or

[32:07] high-end, some of those things.

[32:08] And if I, I mean, I was just been up like a million hours a month on

[32:11] good ladwards if I could.

[32:12] Yeah.

[32:12] So how do we look, I guess that would be one thing to increase.

[32:15] Well, the first thing I would just literally tell them, like, I

[32:17] need you to double the ads spend and I need you to find more keywords.

[32:20] OK.

[32:20] So just find more for me.

[32:22] Got it.

[32:22] The other thing that might be worth looking into would be

[32:26] local SEO.

[32:27] OK.

[32:28] His SEO is especially for intent base.

[32:30] So it's like obviously they're searched, but it's not

[32:32] hard to win at SEO locally.

[32:34] OK.

[32:34] Like, naturally you want to win back pain at the good luck.

[32:36] But like, you want to win ever, you know,

[32:39] car practice, or ever at spine, ever at pelvic health, ever at low

[32:43] back, ever at lumbar, ever at like you mean there's so many

[32:45] sciatic, like all those, I think you could probably win on long

[32:49] till keyword.

[32:49] So put that in some seven.

[32:55] So right now, Raymond is doing the core force.

[32:59] This is a page 49 of the lead's book.

[33:00] So this is about advertising getting leads.

[33:03] And so he is currently running paid ad.

[33:05] So one of the core four.

[33:07] But I think that he has an opportunity on posting free content on

[33:10] his site to drive SEO.

[33:12] If you don't know, SEO is at search engine optimization.

[33:14] So that people who have high intent were looking for a car

[33:16] practice in my area, or other keyword or long-tailed

[33:19] terms will get sent to that site to maybe read a blog or something

[33:23] that sounds interesting.

[33:24] And then while they're on the site, they can take one of the

[33:26] call to actions in order to kind of take the steps in the

[33:29] funnel.

[33:29] And one thing that helps us a lot, I think, is we're pretty

[33:31] good about getting refuse.

[33:32] We have more reviews than everybody in our cities.

[33:34] Oh, it's great.

[33:34] And then I think that helps us to local SEO.

[33:37] But yeah, and I guess the big question is,

[33:40] like, with the ad spend a lot of these sort of agencies that

[33:42] we hire, like they work with many car records, right?

[33:45] So the most car records don't do what we do with itself.

[33:48] Acid is a 2400.

[33:49] They do visit the visit, which is a nightmare.

[33:52] So I think that they base our ad spend, the recommending our

[33:55] ad spend based on that, but my return on it is so much

[33:58] higher than the average guy.

[33:59] Oh, yeah.

[33:59] I was with him.

[34:00] Yeah, totally.

[34:01] So if you want to talk in, in marketers speak for them,

[34:06] okay.

[34:07] And just giving us our target CPA, like a cost to acquire our

[34:10] CPL, just say like listen, I can, I can pay up to this.

[34:14] So like make it rain dude, as long as it's under this, I'm good.

[34:17] If you're managing an agency, the more specific can be

[34:20] the better.

[34:21] And so you have to have learned some marketing language, so

[34:23] that you can talk to them like marketers.

[34:25] And I also tell you, though, respect you way more if you can

[34:27] speak their language.

[34:28] What you're going to be looking at is either cac, depending

[34:31] on what, you know, what, it's either CPA or cac typically

[34:33] CPA means cost-break position.

[34:35] Cac is cost-yocard customer, both terms fundamentally

[34:37] mean the same thing.

[34:38] And or CPL, so cost-prelead.

[34:40] I like to kind of break this down into two numbers.

[34:42] One number is what I will tell them is my acceptable range.

[34:45] And then the number that's actually my accept to pull them

[34:48] out because sometimes they tend to overshoot.

[34:49] This is just me with a history of agencies.

[34:51] And so I'll give my I'll build in a little bit of padding

[34:53] between what I tell them and what I'm actually willing to pay.

[34:56] But the more you trust the agency, the more those

[34:58] you know, the more you can be closer together.

[34:59] Because if you build trust, build a good relationship,

[35:01] the higher up that number is the more traffic they can ultimately

[35:05] send you because they can spend more to get you a customer.

[35:07] And when would you consider bringing that all in the house?

[35:10] So, um, because I kind of, I hate dealing with these.

[35:13] No, I get it.

[35:13] I get it.

[35:14] If problem wouldn't mean my priority right now.

[35:15] Okay.

[35:16] Because like, if I look at this, I'm like, okay, we got 12 to 12, 24 to 11,

[35:18] 9 to 11.

[35:18] So I'm like, we're doing pretty well on this.

[35:20] Right.

[35:21] And do you not have, do you have Google on the other three as well?

[35:23] Yeah.

[35:24] Okay, it's just not there.

[35:25] I've read the one like a higher middle low.

[35:27] Oh, so that's low.

[35:28] 9 to 1 is a low one.

[35:29] Yeah, for sure.

[35:30] Oh, that's great.

[35:31] Geez.

[35:31] Okay, cool.

[35:32] I would say basically I'd stop at it at five to one.

[35:35] Okay.

[35:35] And say like, so basically double or triple whatever the CBA

[35:38] there currently is.

[35:39] And sometimes what you'll find though is that if you can double or even triple

[35:42] how much you can spend a good customer, you might be able to like 10

[35:44] to actually fly.

[35:45] It's not like it's not, it's not proportional.

[35:48] Because you just all of a sudden you're

[35:50] out spend this many more people to illustrate what I'm, what I'm

[35:53] explained to the Raymond, I'm going to give you two hypothetical examples.

[35:55] All right.

[35:56] So let's say I say you could spend a thousand dollars in scenario one and that

[36:01] will turn into 10 thousand dollars.

[36:03] Now you might think, wow, I should do that.

[36:07] But wait, there's more.

[36:08] What if I said you could spend 10 thousand dollars and make $50,000

[36:13] which one did you rather have?

[36:14] Well, hopefully, hopefully this one.

[36:17] Because here you make $40,000 net.

[36:21] And here you make $9,000.

[36:22] Despite the fact that this is a 10 to 1 versus here, you have a 5 to 1.

[36:28] So you have half the efficiency, but you have four and changed times the amount

[36:34] of absolute return.

[36:35] And I see many small business owners get stuck in the strap of being like, I have to

[36:39] optimize this.

[36:40] I have to optimize this.

[36:41] And you do to agree.

[36:42] But at some point, sometimes you just got to spend more.

[36:44] You need to expect efficiency to drop at scale.

[36:46] It's just part of the game.

[36:47] Cool.

[36:48] So local SEO, that and all right.

[36:51] So let me do this.

[36:52] So what I want to do is I want to reorder these so that you have kind of like the next

[36:56] steps.

[36:57] Does that work?

[36:58] Okay.

[36:59] Sweet.

[37:00] I feel like we can, I feel like we're making profits.

[37:01] I like that.

[37:02] I like the doing it before the show.

[37:04] Oh, it makes all the size of this.

[37:05] It makes all the change in the world.

[37:07] So what I'm about to outline is the next six months of work for Raymond.

[37:10] And I would say a relative amount of increase that these tactics can do for his business.

[37:15] And so one of the key parts of laying out a plan like this is making sure that the

[37:18] person has the right resources and that they're doing them in the right prioritization order.

[37:22] But if there's something that takes five minutes and can double the business, well, let's

[37:25] do that first.

[37:26] And I tend to save the heavier things for later, unless it, it absolutely has to be

[37:31] done first.

[37:32] And the other ones are contingent on the execution of that.

[37:34] And so by and large, I will do light work, high impact first.

[37:38] And then oftentimes there's the heavy work heavy impact that has other things that tail

[37:43] or are attached to it as the order of operations for him.

[37:47] Now we started this whole conversation route operations to make sure that they had the right

[37:51] people in the right seats to actually execute these strategies.

[37:54] And so that's also something I'm taking into consideration what I'm laying out this

[37:57] plan.

[37:58] So I'm going to use black here.

[37:59] So we're going to go in order.

[38:03] So number one, you're good.

[38:05] As increase, Google spent.

[38:10] So that's number one.

[38:11] And you're going to try and spend as much as you possibly can.

[38:15] Facebook, we'd magnet $3, tighter ad copy.

[38:25] What I would do, honestly, is I would look at, so this is how it spines some shit.

[38:31] So I would look for co-opractor agencies that specialize in higher ticket.

[38:37] And then I would look at their customers.

[38:39] And then I would look at their ad accounts.

[38:40] And then I'll bet you that they run the same ad copy that seems to work really well for

[38:43] all of them.

[38:44] That's right.

[38:45] Okay.

[38:46] If I was like, if I had to go my 1.0 version.

[38:49] Okay.

[38:50] So number four, this is going to be the credit card plus insurance card setter.

[38:59] This is cool.

[39:00] Number five, oops shit.

[39:02] Number five, print out, morning of insurance plans.

[39:11] Six.

[39:13] We need the sales manager to take over the process, right?

[39:16] Manager takes sale, one location test.

[39:24] If it works well, you can roll it out.

[39:26] Yeah, I already do that.

[39:27] So I'm going to take this one.

[39:28] Oh, perfect.

[39:29] I got that right.

[39:30] I would add in local SEO to get more traffic.

[39:37] This is a long term investment though, but I think it's so worth it for what you're

[39:39] trying to do because the thing is the SEO is going to have the highest return.

[39:43] Like in terms of roll I said, I actually, there should be more profitable.

[39:46] It's like you got a bit of weight a year.

[39:47] But you're looking at, on the one to your timeline.

[39:49] So I think it's just going to be worth it.

[39:51] And that's not worth doing that with all my, this, into the locations.

[39:54] Yeah, you're just ranking each of those local markets.

[39:58] And then like as soon as you know, you're going to open up another one.

[40:00] It's like you just, yeah, exactly.

[40:01] Start spending it out.

[40:02] I'll just put this stuff point here.

[40:04] Same day.

[40:05] Got to level that.

[40:06] Four step.

[40:08] And then I'll scale and we'll add in sales, preso slash checklist for an integer.

[40:20] So I think if we do these things, we're going to put a little estimator here.

[40:24] I think this is probably an easy two x in terms of leaf low and making more money.

[40:30] This can absolutely double the return that you're doing there.

[40:34] This kind of these two are together.

[40:35] So I'll just like meet there.

[40:37] This is probably going to give us the 10% back that we're losing between day one and

[40:42] day two right now.

[40:43] There are just some plus 10%.

[40:45] Now this one, I think like the thing is with this one, that I like so much is it

[40:49] doubles the efficiency of each store.

[40:51] Like this one's like super super sexy because all of a sudden, it might be able to take

[40:55] your can from like 1.5 like three.

[40:59] And like you might not have to open anymore stores.

[41:01] Like if you could, because like if you can double revenue, the fixed costs are more

[41:03] less the same.

[41:04] Yeah, right.

[41:05] So you can double revenue across all of these.

[41:08] Then you'd already be at five, like you'd already be at five in terms of even if you

[41:11] didn't have to do anything else.

[41:12] Would that be attracted to the industry for a while?

[41:14] Oh yeah, even if it's just that small amount of, yeah.

[41:16] Okay, yeah.

[41:17] Locally SEO is probably like you might be able to get like a 30 to 50% boost.

[41:21] It'll just take like a year.

[41:22] But the nice thing is this home origin.

[41:24] It's all March.

[41:25] And then the sales president will probably be able to smooth out your closing percentage.

[41:29] Probably be someone like a 20% lift.

[41:31] That would be kind of like my guess.

[41:33] So we've got a double, a double 10%.

[41:36] This could be a double, this is more in terms of volume.

[41:39] Volume.

[41:40] This is yeah, 30 to 15, probably 20% lift here.

[41:43] And that's probably about six months of work.

[41:46] Yeah.

[41:47] Well, dude, that's the plan.

[41:48] Thank you so much.

[41:49] Yeah, 100% thank you, man.

[41:50] So I just sat down with Alex and he broke down my business and all the marketing constraints

[41:54] that we have and gave me some pretty easy and momentum at things that we can do to grow

[41:57] right away.

[41:58] So Raymond was amazing.

[41:59] I'm so pumped to be able to work with him in this business and help him out here.

[42:02] This was lots of fun for me.

[42:03] Probably more fun for me than even was for him.

[42:05] And hopefully even more fun for you.

[42:06] And if you liked this style of content really tactical business stuff, you're going

[42:09] to love the first one of these that I did with Ashley who is a stylist.

[42:13] And I think the tactics I laid out there got many businesses.

[42:15] Blah.

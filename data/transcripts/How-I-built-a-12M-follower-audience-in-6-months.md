[00:00] What's up YouTube?

[00:01] Yesterday over a thousand of you guys stayed on for an hour as we walked down a private

[00:06] event speech that I gave and I read to the speech just for Instagram live and YouTube

[00:10] for you guys.

[00:11] And so we cover in the video is one, the content creation model that we've used to grow

[00:14] over a million person audience over the last six months.

[00:17] Number one, number two is how to position yourself in your messaging so you don't sound

[00:20] like a dick.

[00:21] Number three, the concept behind giving away the goodwill and then selling the implementation

[00:26] makes a lot of people feel like they have to keep their best stuff hidden.

[00:29] And the reality is you got to give it all away and then you'll always get so much

[00:32] more than you think you will.

[00:34] Number four was the three traits of ultra-successful people that I've seen of all the

[00:37] people that I know were worth $1 billion more.

[00:39] They have these three traits in comment and they're not exactly what I expected them to

[00:42] be.

[00:43] The next one is the best way to scale a sales team because I was one of the question

[00:46] I got the chat and I was really excited to talk about it.

[00:47] So broke down the entire process of how we've scaled the next one is discussion around

[00:50] closing because now we went from the big team down to like how do I actually get people

[00:54] to say yes and the three firms that I use to walk someone across the finish line?

[00:58] How I deal with failure and then finally I give you a little bit of a sneak peek on the next

[01:01] book.

[01:02] I hope you enjoy the light for a best of day and I'll see you on the inside.

[01:05] I'll give you guys the skinning scoop on what the presentation was if you guys can

[01:10] throw some hearts or some thumbs up.

[01:13] Okay, cool.

[01:14] So I'll give you the overarching theme which was the first third of it I had to bring

[01:21] everyone up the speed you didn't know what our deal was.

[01:24] But in the last six months we've grown from like 180,000 person audience across all

[01:29] channels to like 1.2 million now in the last six months so it's been a lot of growth and

[01:36] I mean, no one's experienced it more than me and so I'm very grateful so that's all

[01:39] you guys so thank you so much really honored.

[01:42] And so I'll kind of explain that and then the second portion was kind of like the tactics

[01:45] which was like what do we actually do to do that and I'll cover that to second.

[01:50] And then the third part was my observations on like the things that worked big picture rather

[01:55] than like the blocking and tackling like hacks and things like that.

[01:58] So let's go into kind of section two which is the tactics.

[02:02] So there's kind of a five step process that we've been doing and Kales been helping me

[02:06] out with this but basically we test first and so this works for you because I used to

[02:11] email myself out of you guys are like I have I used to email myself like brain dump like

[02:15] I had an idea on a conversation or someone else I got able to lose it I just emailed

[02:19] myself and I was never ending threat of like me to me and I'll be guys have that.

[02:23] And then I would go for content I would look at that thing and then I would try and come up

[02:26] with my content ideas.

[02:28] But what I discovered was I could use Twitter as my brain dump and take basically the

[02:34] same amount of time as I would to email myself with the context of it not but I could just

[02:38] do it on Twitter and then what happened is what used to be a private communication became

[02:42] a public thing.

[02:43] So I was able to share something that otherwise was a mean you lost.

[02:45] And then the out of benefit was Twitter and like TikTok out there similar in that they're

[02:50] very fast testing like you can post 10 times a day and it doesn't like hurt your account

[02:54] whereas you know Instagram people were like hey man I've seen enough of your stuff like

[02:57] one post a day and it's fine or whatever.

[02:59] And so on there you can post plenty of times and then you get to see the engagement because

[03:03] both of those platforms are very like viral ready it's so easy to share and whatnot.

[03:07] And so from those we see the best performing content and then that is what I then use to

[03:14] create to basically record videos off of.

[03:18] So tweets turn into videos the threads turn in the long videos the short tweets turn

[03:23] into shorts and then that becomes from there we record those things.

[03:28] Step three is we add call the actions to them which is something that we actually just

[03:33] recently started doing so you're probably seeing more of these videos and stuff in the

[03:35] future but we just started doing it's my podcast.

[03:38] If you haven't checked that if you are an audible person or audio person the game podcast

[03:42] you didn't know we haven't podcast has just grew from like 20,000 downloads a month to 400,000

[03:50] downloads a month which is like insane so you guys are awesome I love you I'm glad that

[03:55] it's providing value.

[03:57] But the biggest thing that we did to get the growth was really just saying like hey do

[04:02] you like this like they review and share it for a friend.

[04:05] Share it for a friend.

[04:06] So we start doing that and then that's what everything just blew up which makes sense

[04:11] because like the book for example had a ton of our value to it because there was call

[04:14] the actions embedded within the book and so we just took like what we already know worse

[04:18] than business we need to be reminded more than we need to be taught and just apply it to

[04:21] something that I'm not as familiar with like I don't consider myself like a content creator

[04:25] like you know we do business stuff and like we try and capture as much as we can and so

[04:30] doing that we started interjecting in three places the beginning the middle and the end

[04:36] and if it's longer you can do a couple of mid rolls and so what we did to

[04:40] operationalize that was we took like what are all the call actions you would have

[04:43] because you don't always be the same thing because some people get like banner blindness

[04:46] so it's like for me it's like you know hey check out the book it's 99 cents you can

[04:50] get download it you know like go check it out it's got 5,000 five stars like people seem to like it

[04:55] you know hey leave a review that would be awesome you know tag me in this or send this to a

[05:00] friend so that'd be a share ask hey if I had a vet coming up with a vet coming up but if I had

[05:04] an event coming up or if I was like hey I'm gonna do a workshop with like you know five

[05:08] entrepreneurs over you know a million bucks a year that I would just point people to something like

[05:12] that if you had a lead magnet that would be one of those things and so you get the idea like

[05:16] whatever whatever you want to direct traffic that would be the call action but here's the

[05:21] here's the the sticker here's the thing that the nuance I made at work is that rather than just doing

[05:25] one do like five for each one of them and then you've got like 30 of these that you can

[05:30] sprinkle in and then they seem really organic and because I I'm doing them really short they're only like you know

[05:35] five or 10 seconds they don't they're not like these three minute long ads they're going to

[05:38] almost kill themselves and just immediately skip skip until they get to the end of the

[05:41] ad right and so it's like little caught actions that are small enough that people actually hear

[05:46] them and different enough that you don't get like audio blindness and so that was a step three

[05:53] step four is contextualized and so what I did in the presentation I showed this image you guys remember

[05:57] the meme that was like a dog part that was that she started it's like me on Facebook me on Tinder

[06:02] me on Instagram if you guys is this cool you guys like otherwise I'll just be dancing on my mind okay cool

[06:07] you guys want me to do more of this because Caleb we have a bet I was like no one's going to show

[06:12] up and if someone showed up then I would lose the bet which is probably very well it's not a

[06:16] bet I should not have taken um anyways so die part and uh there's Tinder linked in all that stuff right

[06:23] so that was the meme and so if you look and I've this visual if you look at a lot of my tweets a lot of them

[06:29] became TikToks and then from that short TikTok I have a YouTube shorts version and I have an

[06:35] Instagram version and the thumbnail on the text are contextual to the platform and so you guys are

[06:41] probably seeing people who like take a TikTok and then just like post it the same thing with the TikTok

[06:46] watermark on Instagram or they take the same TikTok watermark and they put it on YouTube shorts

[06:51] and they have the same like captioning whatnot around it and saying the thumbnail I think that people

[06:56] feel that like you didn't take the extra a little bit and this could be me judging I don't know I'm

[07:00] just sharing what works for us and so we try to make it contextual to the platform and I think that's

[07:04] been helping um and so that's step four so test on Twitter record shorts are short as long as long

[07:11] add the code to actions to drive the action drive the action look for drive the shot for everyone

[07:17] four is you contextualize the platform they're distributing on and this step five is actually distributed

[07:24] and this is the this is the little little less in the eye learned and so I shared this I think

[07:27] on my YouTube channel but I had a conversation with Rick Hardone I wrote six months ago and this is

[07:33] actually what was probably the big impetus excuse me catalyst for this happening for me ramping up everything

[07:38] we said he said look at your Instagram bro look at my Instagram and I was like okay and he's like

[07:43] falling in bro is like I'm posting five times more than you are and he said look at your Twitter

[07:47] look at your YouTube look at my YouTube and it was just such a stark contrast in terms of the amount of

[07:52] content that he was putting out compared to me and then it became really obvious and so what ended up

[07:56] happening is we were posting seven times a week which was three YouTube videos a week which three

[08:01] podcasts a week and one Instagram post as all I was doing and we went from seven times a week to 80 times a

[08:06] week across all platforms and so it was a 10x increase in content that here's what's interesting

[08:13] we didn't get a 10x increase in quantity we got a 10x increase in growth rate so the actual

[08:19] net result went from 180,000 which had taken us 12 months to build to getting to 1.2 million in

[08:27] six months of building and so the rate of growth 10x and so literally the input was equivalent to the

[08:35] output in terms of the the equivalence between those things so right now if you're thinking

[08:38] yourself man I would love to grow 10x faster so whatever your growth rate is on a new platform

[08:43] if you're thinking about it I would bet you I don't know if it'll be a dollar to dollar increase

[08:48] or a one to one increase but I'll bet you if you do more you won't get less and so that's you could take

[08:54] that wrong some bit and so I started doing that that's when we saw this explosive growth and

[09:00] the thing is is I told this other story that hopefully you guys want my be sharing with you

[09:04] you guys go just getting like some of the nuggets from the event go okay um I uh I had a

[09:11] immense really early on when I had my gyms that told me to start putting flyers out right and so I

[09:15] put uh so I listened to them and I put flyers out and waited a few weeks nothing happened I went back

[09:19] to the ones with them and also hey we did the flyers thing it didn't work and it was like what do you

[09:24] mean I was like well I mean one guy called me but he's because he said I dinged his car it was a

[09:29] Mercedes and I just tried to talk to him in the nice thing and I'm gonna have a phone and

[09:33] he's like what was your test size it was like what do you mean he's like well how many did you put

[09:37] out oh I put 300 out it's like 300 oh yeah it's like dude I don't even test for less than 5,000

[09:44] fires that was like oh well that explains it is like and then we do 5,000 a day once we have a winner

[09:53] it's like oh and so that wasn't even like 2x or 5x or 10x it was 20x and that was a per day not in total

[10:03] so if you did at the end of that month you would have put up 150,000 flyers and I put up 300

[10:09] and so I'm looking at the difference in results between this really successful business person

[10:12] to myself and I miss mistakenly thought that the issue was the strategy rather than the execution

[10:20] and so one of the number of things that I feel like I get in my DMs all the time is like hey I've been

[10:24] doing the rule 100 you guys don't know what that is it's my little stick for if you do 100

[10:28] primary actions a day to put your business or make your products and services known you will get more

[10:32] business which means if you do 100 cocaused you 100 cold emails you do 100 DMs whatever that is you do

[10:37] 100 of that primary action per day or if it's at as bench been a hundred dollars a day whatever it is

[10:43] or you do 100 a week if it's actual organic content I promise you you will have more business than you

[10:49] know to do it you're you're probably will not be demand generation it will be satisfying the demand that

[10:53] you have to handle and so the thing is is that people hear that they hear the rule of 100 and I had a guy

[10:58] literally message means that hey I've been doing the rule 100 I've just crossed 100 I started eight weeks ago

[11:03] and I was like what do you mean you started eight weeks ago and you crossed 100 so why mean I've done

[11:08] 100 you know reach out server the last eight weeks I was like bro so seven times eight is 56 times

[11:17] a hundred should have been 56 thousand reach out in that same period of time and hopefully you're

[11:21] catching the drift here that it's not these like two x three x increases in volume it's typically

[11:27] multiple orders of magnitude it's not ten x it might be a hundred x or three hundred x in the case of the

[11:33] flyers or 56 thousand versus a hundred in that same period of time and the issue is that most people

[11:37] dramatically underestimate how much effort is required to achieve goals that are dramatically above

[11:44] what the norm is experiencing and so it's like right now if you're getting normal results it's usually

[11:48] because you're putting out a normal level of output which is almost not existing because everyone's so afraid

[11:52] of someone leaving a mean comment the amount of being comments that again is unrolled the amount that

[11:57] it influences me because I is is law and that's where right here so do you get it to it's mostly

[12:03] because all of you guys you guys are awesome so you guys if you guys bury those comments and so

[12:07] most of the nation you guys rock thank you again and so that was section two of this thing you guys

[12:13] want to hear section three I can give you guys the stick okay so section three the consolidated version

[12:19] of this and I'm still like working on it so this was like the thing that made this uncomfortable

[12:23] for me because I think if I were to redo the entire presentation the entire presentation would have

[12:27] been section three altogether and it just would have started there and then gone down because

[12:32] everything that I shared with you although it's incredibly important probably lacks the one thing

[12:38] that I think matters most which is that most people are talking about shit that they have not done

[12:45] and the way that they talk about it makes people hate them let me explain so if I said for example

[12:52] let's say all right let me just let me try to paint a different so let's see that you're you're

[12:57] your on your newspaper who hear sees people shaking their finger and telling them what they should

[13:00] do when they're doing speed all the time right plenty people now how many times have you gotten you

[13:07] know seen that 18 year old relationship coach who's on your newspaper trying to sell coaching

[13:12] for relationships right the dating expert that's 21 years old right if you guys seen this

[13:18] gonna get like some parts or some thumbs go out if you guys have seen this right it's ridiculous

[13:23] why is it ridiculous because there's an unspoken question that must always be answered in my opinion

[13:29] which is why should I listen to you and so I think the common reason that people are not experiencing

[13:36] the growth and the brand and the authority that they wish to build is because they're trying

[13:40] they're putting their ladder against the wrong wall they're trying to build something that they do

[13:44] not have the authority to preserve and so for example if you wanted to build a business brand right

[13:51] if you look at the biggest influencers in the business space so you look at any for sale you look

[13:56] at Gary V you look at Patrick Bintay but if you're a newspaper you look at you look at uh you look at

[14:01] at my lab right you look at these guys a really important question is how many of them need

[14:06] it the social media following they have in order to make the money they make no and so they have

[14:14] the authority to talk about business because of the shit they have already done and so it's kind

[14:20] of like and I hear this all the time it's like man my content so much better than that guys I can't

[14:24] believe people you know share that guy stuff if you on Musk tweets I'm on the the porcelain

[14:29] thrown right now it'll get 500,000 shares and it's not because of the content it's because of the

[14:34] frame and the brand that has wrapped around that message it's because Elon said it that made it

[14:39] important right and so the idea is it's very difficult to deliver theoretical knowledge on business without

[14:46] having the proof or the evidence to substantiate the theoretical knowledge you're claiming to have

[14:51] because it doesn't pass the litmus test of like why should I listen to you why should I listen to

[14:55] the 10,000 dollar most business coach why wouldn't I listen to Tom Billy because people

[15:01] want to make in the same stuff as Tom and I'm like yeah you are as I get sick you're missing

[15:04] the one thing where you build a billion dollar bread small thing that you're missing right we've got

[15:10] the the stayed home wealth coach right that's talking about how you should dollar cost average into

[15:15] the stock market being like dude I'm getting way better advice than Warren Buffett isn't it maybe

[15:20] maybe you're saying the exact same thing is Warren Buffett it's not fair that Warren Buffett gets

[15:24] all all this media and you don't except for the fact that he's built a hundred billion dollars

[15:29] in that worth and made so many people wealthy through Berkshire halfway like there's just that

[15:33] that little 80-video right go that's missing and so if that sounds hopeless to you there is good news

[15:39] so the point is is that first identify if you're doing it if you are probably stopped the second

[15:45] thing is that you change the way you speak all right and so changing the way you speak comes in

[15:49] terms of how you talk and what you're talking about so the what you're talking about the way to be

[15:54] unfuck with the ball so that people can't shoot you down who can't give you hate is by saying listen

[16:01] I don't know this is just what I did and this is what worked for me this time I hope it serves you

[16:09] versus this is what you need to do to get what I have or this is what you need to do in order to

[16:15] view X it's the difference between how to to how I so you start your message with how I built

[16:24] a 13 million dollar month company not how you can build a hundred billion dollar company

[16:30] it's minor but it's huge right it's kind of the difference it's almost like the difference

[16:34] of saying like hey do you want to buy my shit versus hey do you know anybody wants to buy my stuff

[16:37] it's these tiny little pivots in language that that have deep implications behind your intention

[16:44] of how you're speaking to them and you say you should or how to you're presuming a place of

[16:49] the 30 that you may not have heard whereas if you're always coming from the place of like I had

[16:54] oatmeal for breakfast right no one's gonna object with you on there like I don't know for breakfast

[16:59] but if you say you should have oatmeal for breakfast if you want to look like me

[17:04] how much more do you hate me now a lot and it's just a difference in language and so the idea is

[17:09] that we change the way we talk and what we talk about and so rather than talking about the general

[17:14] ideas of an industry which we probably don't have the authority to presume because we don't have the

[17:19] experience the depth of experience to make sure that our assumptions are valid across the sizes of

[17:24] business because you may make an assumption and you make a statement that works for a $10,000

[17:29] month business and then everyone else is like well I can think of a hundred ways this wrong and then

[17:34] you look like an idiot but if you say hey this is how I've gotten a 10,000 a month I hope this is

[17:40] helpful for you no one's like fuck that guy that's not how we got to 10,000 a month because they don't

[17:45] know they kid they kid they cannot challenge your experience and if you want to make a pivot on that

[17:50] it's a hey this is what I've been doing with John and Jim and Casey and Sarah to help them with their

[17:57] skincare condition to help them with their home remodel to help them with their XYZ so I hope it helped

[18:03] you out because this is the friend we made for them and they seem to think it was useful size

[18:06] 100 share with you guys if you speak from that perspective it's speaking from experience rather than theory

[18:11] and most people who are talking right now are just taking Gary Vee's content taking other people's

[18:16] content deluding it watering it down and then delivering it from a position of weakness because you

[18:20] don't have the brand and you don't have the authority you know the expertise or the experience

[18:25] real over imaginary to make these claims and so I think the heart of the issue is not I mean sure

[18:32] there's the blocking attacking of the volume and the distribution and and contextualize the

[18:36] content all that stuff right there's all of that and for sure you have to do the doing it has to

[18:40] get stuff but the heart of it comes down to talking about things that you have the authority to speak

[18:46] over and it reminds me of a speech from Morpheus from the Matrix where he stands up and I think it's

[18:51] in the second of that I can't remember and he stands up and he says I stand here truthfully on

[18:55] afraid he said not because of the path that lies before me because of the path that lies behind me

[19:00] because no one can question the things that you have already done no one can question the experience

[19:04] that you've met with even if it's this big and the thing is it's about it's about doing the first step

[19:12] and then talking about what you just did and what you just learned and then taking the next step

[19:16] and then talking about what you did when you just learned now the maximize first of that is having

[19:21] a kale of behind the camera and and miced up all the time so we can catch and that's going to

[19:25] we're going to be making more stuff for you guys on that because you guys asked for and we're building

[19:28] the team to try and deliver that for you guys but that takes time and it costs money to do that

[19:33] so I get that and so I think that just doing the doing and then talking about what you did is one of

[19:38] the simplest way to document the lessons learn how you progress and grow over time and as a total

[19:43] side note if you want to check this out if you go on my podcast which is actually the oldest platform

[19:47] about that one by the way I have like four I mean almost 400 episodes on there you can go back

[19:52] six years ago and listen to the difference in terms of what I was talking about then and what I'm

[19:57] talking about now and part of the reason that we document all this stuff and mission the

[20:00] business for acquisition not come is the document to share the best practices this is a building

[20:03] world class companies is that it how shitty is it that Jeff Basos doesn't have a vlog of him being like

[20:10] day 37 and Amazon you know trying to try to get these books shipped out you know had some shipping

[20:15] issues today but you know going to get after tomorrow like how invaluable would it be if we could

[20:21] look back at Jeffy Bees you know library of content and see him build one of the biggest companies

[20:27] all time same with Steve Jobs same with Elon Musk right and so I was my hope is that you know we

[20:32] get to a building of the yard and I hope that because I want to have the journey documented with the

[20:38] lessons that I learned along the way and the shifts in belief like earlier today I got asked by

[20:43] somebody who's who listen to all my podcasts they're like hey in podcast 86 which by the way

[20:47] it's four and a half years ago they're like you said this thing and I was like you know I think I've

[20:51] shifted my understanding of that and so I was like there's more nuance to it and so it's really cool

[20:56] for yourself to document these things and when you do do it from that perspective which is to

[21:00] do it for yourself to do it because you believe it should be made because you want to add to the

[21:04] body of knowledge rather than preach to somebody to do it not because you want to feature ego because

[21:08] you want to feed the audience if you can do it from that perspective then I think the audience can

[21:11] feel the intention and so that kind of leads to what I would consider to be like probably one of

[21:15] the later points in the presentation which is the whole concept around giving which is first off

[21:22] humans are exceptionally good at sniffing out intention and I think that's evolutionary and

[21:27] deeply wired in us because we have to know when we're getting double crossed we have to know

[21:30] and trying to be able to guess if someone's lying to us and so we're actually very very good like

[21:34] even people who have like necessarily like low-right cues or low-processing power

[21:38] still can have exceptionally good ability at sniffing out lying can sniff any out intention

[21:43] just sniffing out in like in to ill well and so because evolutionary if you weren't able to do that

[21:48] get double crossed you get your coconut stone right and so we have this really innate

[21:54] very tuned instrument inside of us that can hear intention in totality and microaggressions

[21:58] and so I don't think you can fake it I think you just have to truly shift your perspective

[22:03] so that you can live in that way authentically which is to actually believe that if you give

[22:09] to your audience over long enough period of time you will reap higher rewards and so I'm going

[22:14] to be clear since day one I've always been into make one but I think that the vehicle that we use

[22:21] to make money is a longer game and I got asked on the I think carbon cycle the only other time

[22:26] I've been on Instagram life was like hey man why are you one of the good guys you like why haven't

[22:29] you like sold out or whatever and I was like well first off I want to be clear we're equating

[22:34] selling with bad which I would never do um number one number two is that I'm absolutely

[22:41] a capitalist and long term greedy it's just that I think that you need working with companies

[22:45] thinking about mining skills of getting someone from 3 to 30 3 to 15 million

[22:50] is more valuable for me to work with the handful of people and just everyone else stuff for free

[22:54] so that they can get to the level that I can then work with them right rather than trying to build

[22:57] a massive infrastructure around you know helping tens of thousands of people trying to consume the

[23:03] content when I can just give it to them for free right which leads to another big point that I have

[23:08] around this release of belief that I have which is give away the secrets sell the implementation

[23:13] and so a lot of people have info behind walls and that's fine I'm not saying there's anything wrong

[23:17] with that but the real value at for the service is the implementation the accountability the

[23:21] troubleshooting and the perspective from which to solve the problem so I'll give you an example so let's

[23:26] say you want to get better at sales right so I can make tons of sales content if I wanted to and

[23:31] the people be like wow this guys are really good at sales because I give away all the secrets right

[23:34] but they might consume it and be a little better but they would be even better if they had a

[23:37] coach who's like listening to their calls and seeing like see right here you paused and then she

[23:42] lost trust with you or hey see how here you should have made this into a question rather than making

[23:47] command and if you did that you could have solved more of her back with than your front foot

[23:50] right like dude you missed for poor in the first two seconds because you said this instead of this

[23:54] right and then the whole calls went off since that or she said this objection early on and then

[24:00] you didn't catch it so she just detonated it in the sale and you should have confronted that earlier

[24:04] right and so if you if you don't have the perspective from which to get better at the skill

[24:08] because you already only have your baseline skill set because you can't it's very difficult to self-appraise

[24:13] that is where having coaches mentors people who are better at teaching the skill comes into play

[24:18] and so you give away the secrets to prove you are good because here's the here's the flip side people

[24:24] are like what if what if I what if I give away all all these secrets and everyone consumes them right

[24:30] what if you give away a whole bunch of shit and everyone consumes it which one do you think you're

[24:37] going to make more money mom people make their purchasing decisions based on the value they've already

[24:41] received not the value that they're going to receive like it's a really big point that took me

[24:46] way too long to learn one of the strongest persuasive powers in existence is reciprocity if people

[24:54] get something they feel almost like it's like sick to their stomach they have to give something back

[24:58] right it's just most people are like it's not everyone there are some crazy other but most humans

[25:02] because all of our civilization has been based on this concept of reciprocity right and so you can force

[25:08] reciprocity your direction by just jamming so much good will and so much value down to someone's

[25:14] throat that they just feel like they have to vomit back on you in terms of value because they're

[25:17] so full on value they're like getting drunk with the value that you're providing for them and so when

[25:22] you do that it results in a sale and I'll tell you one of the lessons that I learned later this is just

[25:25] at least been true for me is that the end of your value ladder of the ascensions that you can

[25:32] agree for a customer is predicated in the last thing that you provided that was in excessive value

[25:36] from what you charged so if you think about the first thing you do is your content is free it's worth

[25:41] more than what you're giving because you're giving away everything and so then they purchase the first

[25:44] thing and if that first thing let's say it's a thousand dollars but it makes them ten thousand dollars

[25:48] they're like well fuck yeah what else you got you're like well I got a ten thousand worth

[25:51] thing and they're like I'm in and then they make a hundred grand and they're like dude what I'll see

[25:56] got no I got a hundred thousand one I think and this is the part where people fuck up is that

[26:00] that the hundred thousand one thing they get a hundred thousand dollars value and then what they have

[26:03] done is that they have now completely squeezed the price-developed discrepancy and what they have is not

[26:09] a raven customer but a satisfied customer and then that is where the customer relationship ends and so

[26:16] the idea of being able consistently and always have more demand than you can fill is predicated

[26:23] or is based on the ability to always provide not just a little bit more but significantly more

[26:28] than you are charging for and so there's two ways of doing that one is you can decrease your price to

[26:33] the point where it's basically nothing and so if you give anything over nothing it seems more which is

[26:38] what this kind of the premise around free content but the thing is that free content doesn't cost

[26:42] it's just not monetary it's time and attention how many people do you know to make content and they get

[26:46] no fucking engagement on it it might be you you might be that person why do you think that is because the

[26:51] price of free is still not worth it. Go shit right and so the idea is like if you are in that

[27:00] situation you make this free content you say content doesn't work and so you keep putting our

[27:03] shitty or cheater content because you keep saying that it doesn't work I think if you can flip the

[27:07] script and say hey what if I made all of the stuff that I have that's free more valuable there will

[27:12] my competitors are currently charging for what if I make my free stuff better than their paid stuff

[27:18] and if you really truly try to do that not just like say that but live that look it think about all

[27:24] the deliverables that happen think of it all the the checklist and the and the cheat sheets and the

[27:29] visuals and the videos and the in depth trainings that you would provide if you were trying to

[27:33] get your course and what if you just gave that away what happens if someone makes a hundred

[27:39] grant about using your free stuff they fucking want to give you money to buy more from you

[27:45] reciprocity and so as long as the next thing that you have can provide even more value because probably

[27:51] if you were able to help them make a hundred thousand dollars off of your free stuff you probably

[27:55] have enough expertise to help them make a million dollars right and so that's the idea here is like

[28:01] having to provide so much value and access that they want to continue to buy from us over and over

[28:05] right that's the that's the stick and so when we're checking back out to this right I said in the

[28:10] beginning we've got our five method right we can test we test the right stuff then we record the

[28:17] stuff then we add call to actions to the stuff so we direct the traffic we want we contextualize

[28:22] the platforms and then we increase our volume that's the tactics the heart behind it is that we think

[28:29] I will only talk about the things that I know of that no one can question I will talk about how

[28:33] I did something not how to do something I'll talk about what my clients did now what you should do

[28:40] and I will base that from our perspective I will try and give away as much as you really

[28:44] possible so much so that it makes me sick to my stomach and I'm very afraid of the amount of value

[28:47] that I'm giving because I know that based on reciprocity if I give more value out there I will get more

[28:53] in return because you can give that scale of concept so think about this if they cost you the same amount

[29:00] to provide value in a video to one person is the dust of ride value to a million people who watch a

[29:04] video just think about it conceptually it costs you no more efforts to do that but the beautiful

[29:11] thing with technology is that there's still only one of you to receive from everything that you did

[29:16] on a multiple with leverage at scale like I don't know if you can see this visual but you do one

[29:22] level of effort one input and technology amplifies it to everyone but then it all has to come back

[29:29] into one which is you and so you could this is how you can a mass significant well like this is how it

[29:35] works so Caleb asked me the other days like dude people say leverage all the time he's like what is

[29:40] leverage even mean this is what leverage means leverage means the ratio between inputs to outputs

[29:47] in a system and so if the input that we have is time or money if we have something that has lots of

[29:53] leverage means we get a huge multiplier effect if I put one unit in I get 10 units out I get a

[29:58] 100 units out that is a high leverage activity or system and so the aggregation of wealth for people

[30:07] who have money is a function of understanding time because wealth is based on the fundamental unit of money

[30:17] money is a foundational unit of time why because you can trade them back and forth everybody here

[30:21] can trade their time for money it's an even exchange system and so here's what's interesting

[30:25] everyone can trade time for money but you can trade some time for more money right and so what we're

[30:30] doing when we gain leverage is we're looking at and this is the people who are the wealthiest is that

[30:34] they have control over their time so that when they do get it they get the most out of it right and so

[30:41] the game of business to aggregate wealth is to play with higher and higher and higher amounts of

[30:46] leverage over the one thing that we all have the same amount of which is time and so mastering that

[30:52] is the key to becoming wealthy so you master your time in order to master your money and so there's

[30:58] two components of mastering time you have mastery of time which comes down to the micro which is the

[31:03] day to day to speed of activity and I can tell you right now if you talk somebody you say hey we should

[31:08] do the same right and then boom they've got this organized they've already done two or three

[31:11] messages and then like it's getting done tomorrow I guarantee that that person is going to be more

[31:15] wealthy because they have a micro mastery of their time right on the map actually I'm going to

[31:21] explain that when I need a little bit further so think about this from from an organizational perspective

[31:26] imagine that the default time period that you use to get something done is let's say a week let's say

[31:33] that's just the unspoken default that's the cultural default of like hey we need to start this project

[31:37] hey can you get this this thing two minutes it will get you by end of week right end of week that's

[31:41] defying so okay with that right but let's say because you want to become a master of wealth and you

[31:45] understand that time is huge is one of the biggest components of wealth you then say no guys the

[31:50] new default is end of day for all activities unless stated otherwise that becomes the new norm

[31:56] and so let's say that this project that we had originally has seven it back and forth interactions

[32:01] they get something to you it takes a week you get them something back takes a week take a week take a week

[32:05] the whole thing takes seven weeks right now imagine it was end of day the same output happens in one

[32:13] seventh at the time because we both get it done and a day next day two things happen next day two things

[32:18] happened next day two things happen and then boom the project done it would took two months

[32:22] take somebody else four days and when you multiply that effect over a year over a decade that is

[32:28] when you see the outsize returns in wealth and money because of mastery on the micro of time

[32:34] the second component of time is the macro perspective time which is all of the activities

[32:40] acting in alignment with my overall goal and do I believe that they can compound on one another

[32:46] are they directionally aligned over a decade over three decades so that I can have a

[32:50] compounding effect leverage in action over a longer period of time so that my input is far less

[32:57] from my output far outweighs the input that I did because I let time work as an asset rather than

[33:04] a liability most people's plans when you add time get worse what you want to do is play games

[33:10] where if you wait you win and so those are the games that we want to set up and those are the

[33:14] games that the people were truly wealthy understand and so I can tell you having dealt with people

[33:18] who make significantly more money than me they're mastery of the micro of understanding how speed

[33:24] moves things forward because on a macro scale of getting things done day day

[33:29] day rather than week week means that at the end of the year they have 40 times the output

[33:35] and people are like that's not fair who said life was supposed to be right and so this micro

[33:42] kind of exchange that happens there gets enhanced and magnified and people get upset about it but

[33:47] the thing is you can either decry the system and hate on it or you can accept it for what it is

[33:51] and just choose to play the game and win the way you want to if that's what you want and so

[33:57] as the micro and then from the macro perspective like I was saying earlier is that

[34:03] the biggest shift that I see in people who are wealthy is that they talk in decades not days

[34:09] and I can tell you based on the time period that someone talks in when they talk about their plans

[34:14] how wealthy they are or to be fair how wealthy they will be and so if you have truly realistic

[34:22] plans that you're like this is what's is they'll take me about 10 years if you hear someone say

[34:25] that I can tell you that they're going to be successful and if you can shift your perspective to that

[34:29] where you actually start planning and like okay it would be unreasonable that if I did this for

[34:34] 10 straight years that I wouldn't be significantly wealthy that I am today so that's what I'm going to do

[34:40] and then having the singularity of minds and not get distracted and so there's three things

[34:46] they did a research study on this I found this interesting hopefully you will too actually you guys

[34:49] dig in this because I was I was this is you guys good dig in um and if you want first of questions in there

[34:56] because I'll wrap up my little my little my little diatribe there's three things that they found that

[35:01] made people who are all true successful and all true successful did I wish I had the definition

[35:06] for what they defined as an interest successful but we'll just leave it at that they said they have

[35:10] a superior already complex and they think that they are in some way better than other people

[35:15] and deserve more than others number one number two they have massive insecurity and fear failure

[35:22] they never think that they will measure up or be good enough interesting paradox and then number three

[35:29] is they have impulse control and so think about this from a bigger picture perspective

[35:35] they have the superior to conflict so they believe that they can accomplish these amazing things like

[35:39] how like some people if you tell them your goals will say how dare you think that way how dare you believe

[35:43] that you can accomplish something like that and so it takes a little bit of delusion in order to think

[35:47] I'm going to make an iPhone whatever the fuck that is I'm going to put a computer and everyone's hand

[35:51] in the world I'm going to do them right well people think it's super us and the only thing that separates

[35:57] genius and insanity is what happens is outcome right and so they have this this vision and where they

[36:04] want to go and they believe they can do big stuff number two they have this fuel that they push away from

[36:10] from always feeling they'll never be good enough right and that's what drives them towards this this

[36:15] outcome and then number three and this is the big one this is the one that everyone messes up

[36:20] is they have the impulse control to stay focused on it and not let Chinese objects distract them

[36:24] even though there's another opportunity comes up two years in they're like no if I keep doing

[36:30] what I'm doing and I follow the plan that I said I will be it would be unreasonable that I do not achieve

[36:36] the goal that I have could this help maybe but even if I don't do that I will still get there and I'll

[36:41] rather take the get rich for sure than get rich quickway every day and most people this is my finding at least

[36:49] if you were to sit down with someone and say here's a contract you sign here and you're going to live on

[36:54] 30 thousand dollars a year for the next five years but at the end of that five years you'll be able to

[36:58] make a million dollars a year most people would sign that contract but they don't live like they

[37:05] would sign that contract and so if you can and the reason that that contract works is because it delays

[37:12] the gratification it it separates the I'm going to have the cookie today from I want to have

[37:17] a six pack for life right it's the I will suffer for this long period of time I will make the

[37:23] hundred dials I will make the hundred pieces of content a week I will spend the hundred

[37:26] dollars a day on advertising and sacrifice my lifestyle in order to learn not to get rich but to learn the

[37:32] skills that will make me rich eventually and I know that if I accumulate these skills because I'm

[37:38] dedicated to that and I'm willing to sacrifice more than other people to achieve my dreams and I'm

[37:43] going to put a pin on this road quick because I think this is real how many of you to save humanity

[37:48] would sacrifice your life like throw like a light or a thumbs up or something like that like how many

[37:54] of you guys would give your life maybe even your country right a lot of people would do that a lot of

[37:58] farm military to appreciate these are like how many people would do that for Savior's family pause

[38:08] why is it that that is more important than your dreams because I was asked in an interview a few days ago

[38:18] why were you willing to sacrifice so much and I feel like the better question is why are people not willing to

[38:25] sacrifice anything it's like if you're willing to sacrifice your life give the ultimate price for a country

[38:32] or for whatever why would you not give at least that much to realize the potential that you believe you have

[38:40] and so that's for me why the sacrifices never felt like sacrifices they felt like trade-offs and for

[38:46] me they were trade-offs they were prices I was willing to pay and so it's like if there's a pair of shoes

[38:52] that I wanted it is 500 dollars and I bought them so it was like don't you feel guilty about

[38:55] 2500 dollars I would say no that was the price that I was willing to pay so I wanted the shoes

[39:01] period and so if there's a price tag that we can ascribe to our dreams or the potential that we

[39:07] believe that we have which is what we want to pay down as regretting the future for not having it

[39:12] if you read the price tag and it says you know football with the boys dodgeball during the week

[39:16] you know drinking a couple of nights some a little bit groggier if that's the price tag

[39:21] is that a price that we'll end up high and I think if you are you'll get significantly closer

[39:27] what you're trying to do and so that was that was the general gist of the the chat that I had

[39:33] chat it was a presentation of the rest you guys like that was that cool I don't get a little bit of

[39:37] recap and this is not the normal style this is the first Q and A Q and A ever you can thank Caleb

[39:43] hopefully I won the bet and he's he's not told me that anyone actually is live so I could just be

[39:47] renting at the but if you guys have Q's or A's about any of that stuff let me know in the chat

[39:56] and Caleb will read them out to me and then we'll rock and roll from there a common question we got

[40:02] is what would be your number one tip for building A sales team okay number two for building

[40:07] a sales team is higher a very good sales manager that's a that's a very serious answer higher

[40:11] somebody's already built a sales team that's the the real answer the second and much harder answer is

[40:18] learn to sell yourself learn to sell the product train the next person to manage the product

[40:24] read books on sales management which comes down to communication cadence and managing

[40:29] a training process or recruiting process and then a management process so there's three big

[40:33] things that have to happen in the sales team if you ever crewed the right talent which by the way

[40:37] let me say do a lot of time it comes down much more of the picking than it does to the training

[40:40] right because it's much easier to take somebody's naturally ready baseball and get a better

[40:44] they get somebody who has zero eye hand coordination and trying to get them to become a proud

[40:48] you can it'll take you three times as much time to get some more from a two to five then

[40:51] it takes someone to take take a seven to nine all right so number one is being able to spot

[40:55] a talent and recruit them on your team number two is the training component which is you need to get

[41:01] as specialized as evenly possible and here's the key point that I think most people mess up

[41:04] in their sales training they focus on the product not the prospect so the whole time they're trying

[41:09] to educate their team on the bells and the whistles and the things and the differentiators

[41:13] between them in the competition well most of the time the other people have on the phone don't even

[41:16] know the competition number one number two they don't even understand the features they don't

[41:19] understand the problem and so what we should be talking about is why are you here what problem are

[41:24] resolving and then we should have very deep context of what are the common issues that the prospect

[41:29] is suffering from because at the end of the day the more accurately you can depict the pain someone

[41:33] is experiencing the more you can enter the internal conversation and dialogue happening their mind

[41:38] the more they will believe whatever you have next and so if I can perfectly describe what your

[41:42] situation is right now just imagine that I was able to describe your life and the things that you

[41:46] suffer from right now perfectly if I say if I just describe it all to you be like cheese it's like this

[41:51] guy like knows everything I'd be like and that's why I think you're good fit for the program

[41:55] I wouldn't even need to tell you about the program because you'd be like cheese I mean if you

[41:59] understand my problem that well then I'm sure the solution will work and so that's why also

[42:04] from a flexibility standpoint if you train yourself to you can swap products out as needed

[42:10] but the prospect will probably not change and so when we're training so first we recruit the

[42:15] right people we pick right right so the the the championships are one in the draft right not

[42:21] the last year number two is that we train around prospect on the product

[42:26] in number three is that we manage around the values of the team and the headspace and we managed

[42:32] towards one key thing which is conviction because if you have somebody who's been recruited well

[42:36] and they've been trained on the pains of the prospect the only reason someone's not going to be able to

[42:40] sell is because they lack conviction something happened they got a tax they got a call somebody's

[42:44] complaining about something and all of a sudden their conviction drops and you can see this because

[42:48] if someone was hot and then goes cold it's not because they don't know how to sell because they

[42:51] were hot they already know how to sell is because they stop feeling motivated too close and so when

[42:55] someone gives them the initial objection they shrink away because they don't believe that they're

[43:00] really helping the person and so then they don't want to push any further because I can tell you let

[43:05] me say this imagine imagine you went back in time and you were going to talk to your old self from

[43:13] 10 years ago right and you wanted to say hey there's a thing called Bitcoin she get into it

[43:19] and sell it on this day all right I know it means nothing right now this is they that you're going to sell

[43:23] it on but here's the thing if you went back in time you had to not be you you had to just come in

[43:29] another body so to you your perfect stranger but you're talking to yourself think about how you would sell

[43:35] that person that is what somebody with conviction sells like and every everything that they come up with

[43:42] you be like let's dive into this more you're suffering from this let's pull these pieces apart

[43:49] no like I think we do need to make a decision because every day like you'd start breaking it down

[43:52] the way you would talk would change because of the level you were convicted and a key point on

[43:58] conviction is not that it's binary and this is a false thing that people say it's not do you believe

[44:02] the product or not believe in the product it's to what extent do you believe in the product how

[44:06] deeply you believe in product I actually have you ever talked to somebody about something and they

[44:14] had some cocky maning something that was insane right but they talked about it was so much

[44:19] conviction that you started to question your own beliefs because I can't predict that they were

[44:24] that is the power of conviction over any tactic in sales and that's again the thing that I was

[44:29] talking about earlier with the intention right people can smell out intention and so if you have the

[44:34] genuine deep desire to help the prospect and you genuinely believe that this product or program

[44:39] or service is going to change their life then selling gets easy the hard part is doing that which is

[44:44] why most of sales get fixed by fixing those things and not necessarily having some super insane

[44:50] program for training pick the right people you teach them about your prospects but there are things

[44:54] that they're really struggling with and you teach them to have a question-based conversation which is

[44:58] why are you here what have you struggled with in the past why didn't that work okay now that I've

[45:02] understood those things I think you might be a good fit for a program I tell you about it yes

[45:06] x-y-z that makes sense cool we can before doesn't have to be complicated right like that

[45:11] simple salescript is what we taught thousands and thousands of Jim Morrison they close millions and

[45:15] millions and millions of hundreds of millions of dollars and sales using that because the more

[45:19] complex you have the system the easier it is to break and so for me I've always taught off

[45:23] question-based frameworks because we just asked questions it always gives you a home base so someone

[45:27] goes out you know they're all the way out of space you got to bring them back a question can

[45:31] always bring someone right back on point you're like thank you so much for sharing that

[45:34] boom next question right you can walk them down towards the sale so once scaling a sales team

[45:40] best option is to hire an experienced sales manager done this before if you can't do that then

[45:46] you need to learn how to do this to yourself recruit someone who has the already ideally

[45:51] track record work ethic intelligence candor to sell and ideally in a selling firm those similar

[45:57] years if you're doing high volume transactional sales then you want some of you's done high

[46:01] if you're doing you know enterprise sales that you want some of you's done at long

[46:04] sales site who's probably more of a farmer than a hunter it's different person out of

[46:08] stuff you got to make sure that you match those so you start recruiting then you create a

[46:11] question-based framework just for the script and the rest of the time you're educating them

[46:14] on the prospect not the product and then finally from management perspective if someone is dipping

[46:19] all of the effort goes towards raising their conviction educating them on all the things that

[46:23] we're doing to help our prospects exceed giving them the testimonials having live clients

[46:28] hop on and talk about how their life has changed saying hey Dan remember how you sold Johnny

[46:32] two weeks ago well here's Johnny in his life's totally different Johnny he'd love

[46:35] like can you share your experience all of a sudden Dan now feels like the next guy he gets on the

[46:40] phone with is just like Johnny and that is how you can fix someone sales without even having to

[46:45] get into the nitty gritty and sure every morning you do your huddle you know deal with the

[46:49] overcomes before struggling with make sure we drill stuff do the role-playing you obviously have to do

[46:53] that that's the blocking attacking selling but if you want to build a world class sales team it

[46:56] comes down to the culture of conviction so that answer that question what are three books that

[47:03] you would recommend people read I've only read one so I don't real talk I think it would be much

[47:11] better so I have this YouTube video that says I was once weak I saw my channel I genuinely think it's

[47:17] the best I mean I think it's it's one of the best presentations I've ever given and it's literally

[47:23] just about closing and I think if you just it's 90 minutes of just straight closest and if you

[47:28] can understand that and it it shows you an ethical approach to closing which is about giving the power

[47:33] to the prospect because the reason that people don't buy isn't because they don't want to buy it's

[47:38] because they're afraid to make a mistake and so what they do is they give their power away and so

[47:42] there's three ways to give their power away from the outside end they give it to their circumstances

[47:46] first so that's time that's money or that's some particular aspect of the problem they don't like

[47:51] so time wise I'm not going to get into all the problems you can go forever but time wise we all know

[47:56] that it's not about time it's about priorities right how can how can somebody become a self-made billionaire

[48:00] you don't even mean and like we all have the same amount of time so that's and I give you the actual

[48:04] scripting around that but just watch the video to explain the second for circumstances is money which is

[48:08] not about money it's not about resources about resourcefulness so what's the difference between

[48:12] somebody who's broke and a billionaire who lost everything and then builds it back again

[48:17] well both people have grounds you're at one point but the difference is that one person is resourceful the other

[48:21] person isn't and so it's not about resourcefulness so right now if you are broke

[48:27] every self-made billionaire who was broke you're in the exact same position as them so which means it's not

[48:30] an excuse which means if let's say tomorrow you needed a $50,000 surgery how would you come over the money

[48:37] how would you come over then and this is an easy question for everybody because this is what I think

[48:41] really drives at home that sounds like a hypothetical who here is on the live right now most

[48:46] of you guys by the way because digging this is this cool rockin okay who here has had an unexpected

[48:53] buildup maybe something like maybe your car breaks down maybe you have a tax bill for my business

[48:58] owners any huge tax bills all of a sudden they came up what about what about a payroll tax for

[49:05] example you forgot that you were paying anybody we have a major water breakage right

[49:12] you're still here it's telephone it's not answering right now so you obviously survived

[49:18] and here's what's interesting we are willing to become resourceful when we feed someone else

[49:25] but not ourselves so when you had to pay your landlord and pay rent you figured out a way

[49:31] when you had to pay the tax bill the IRS you figured out a way when you had to pay the bill for

[49:36] your car breaking down you figured out a way but for some reason when it comes to investing in yourself

[49:42] you're not and so that's because people blame the circumstances rather than themselves

[49:49] and so we peel this back right so we're having this conversation with prospect and so the three things

[49:53] circumstances so time money fit so fit is like uh I'll give you a simple example they say uh

[49:58] there's broccoli on this meal plan I hate broccoli I don't need broccoli right and the easiest

[50:02] overcome there is just you got to change change there's a lot of stuff that you can un-un-pure there

[50:08] but you just simply say like I mean so many people are like hey well I currently dis-for-practice

[50:13] can I just like have that on the meal plan I'm like well that practice got you that body so probably not

[50:19] got to change the change that's the fundamental truth there so those are the three that

[50:24] happen in circumstances the next level that people will cast bullshit to pastor power two is other people

[50:28] so to say I can't do this because my spouse can't do this my kids I can't do it because my employees

[50:32] I can't do it because uh big bird doesn't matter right the thing is is they will say I can't make

[50:37] this decision because I'm relying on someone else to make this decision and there's a fundamental

[50:42] flaw in this and the big flaw is this is that if we fast forward the clock two years

[50:47] who are you gonna blame for the life that you have yourself or the person that you're giving on the

[50:52] power two of course that and that's not fair the relation that you're gonna have and so what we're

[50:57] doing is you're asking for permission when you should be asking for support

[51:03] real talk and so the thing is is obviously there's sub ones that are anything that which is like

[51:07] hey do they you know they approve of your current situation you know if they say you know no they don't

[51:11] approve of them they're happy that I'm you know feeling this way it's like cool the while they

[51:14] be against something they already don't approve of cool if the rules are reversed what do you think

[51:18] what happened would you help would you be okay with them doing something to help themselves well why do you

[51:21] think it would be different for them right like you get these are all like the simple like

[51:25] many or many overcomers but the big one is that you're asking for permission instead of support

[51:30] right because you really have to logically play this out and so once you get someone to say you know

[51:34] what you're right like I need to take control of this cool now we're talking to some of you's in charge

[51:39] all right which gives you the last circle and the last circle is avoidance is that now when someone

[51:44] says I need to think about it I'm not sure at least you're talking to somebody who's in charge

[51:49] which is amazing and so if you're a salesperson and someone gives you a circumstance thing you

[51:53] might be too low that you have to still keep overcoming to get to the golf now someone says a

[51:58] spouse thing you might have to overcome that and then still have to overcome and avoidance thing

[52:02] but if you can think about peeling back the onion from the outside in then what we're doing

[52:05] is we're not selling we're giving this person the power to make a decision and the objective of the

[52:10] sale and to say this or not just fucking inscribed this in everyone's hearts is that the point of the

[52:14] sale is not to get them to buy the point of the sales to get them to decide and so if you guys

[52:21] don't know the definition of of decide comes from lat which is de Cadere which means to

[52:25] literally cut off and so the question you ask the prospect is that's what this word means and so the

[52:31] question is which future are we cutting off today are we cutting off the future that is more

[52:36] aligned with the dreams that you're trying to accomplish or we cutting off the past that you're trying to

[52:41] step out of which which path we cutting off today right we need to make a decision right and so now at this

[52:50] point when you're in a void is you're talking to somebody in power and so we have to do is get them to

[52:55] confront that is the theme of this one is so we have to get them to confront the decision which most of

[52:59] the time is means they don't even know how to make a decision and so I like to use the frame of past

[53:03] present future and so the past is saying is usually overcoming past worries that they have past mistakes

[53:10] they've had so simple examples like hey I did something like this in the past they didn't work I'm afraid of

[53:13] the same thing happening again right I called this the Bernie twice which is hey do you ever get anybody in

[53:19] middle school yes are you married to them no did you swore off the entire gender because you had a

[53:24] bad experience no well because if you did then you'd be allowing that bad experience to burn your twice

[53:28] once when you paid for it and didn't have it worked out in second when it prevented you from being

[53:31] the love of your life and so we can't take that one experience to let it burn you a second time so that's not a

[53:38] good reason isn't and then it's like well do you think that eventually you're going to do this

[53:41] do this thing right this is me getting the future but like the more fluid you go with this

[53:45] the better you're got but getting a future is like do you think you're going to like be struggling with this

[53:48] forever well no okay well do you think you're going to eventually have to do this sure what if you're

[53:52] going to do it eventually when it's all doing now right and so there's the past which is about you know

[53:59] burning twice the other thing that you can pull from the past is like you think to the reason where

[54:02] I have the conversation right now is because you've had trouble deciding do you think you've got in this

[54:07] point multiple times in the past you haven't been able to trigger and that's why we're here today

[54:12] how much is not making this decision cost you up to this point is it more than the cost of this

[54:18] I don't think this is a fast decision because you've been making this decision last five years

[54:22] the days just the first day we're taking action on it right so we can keep like you can keep going

[54:26] through that's all past right present is they admit all that stuff in the narrative boom you're in the

[54:30] present with the person and you have somebody use some power who who shakes off all the shit

[54:34] they've had in the past you're like great do you know what it takes to make the decision and usually

[54:38] they'll say no you're like great there's three things that you need to figure out what is do you think the

[54:43] product is going to help you solve the problem that you have the way that you want it to be solved yes or no

[54:48] yes great do you want to work with me and or us yes or no great do you know someone or have

[54:55] access the amount of money to get started yes or no if they say yes then you're like great we just made

[55:00] the decision we'll cartoon you you have to help them make the decision and if they're still there they're

[55:04] like you know if you're anything like me you're probably afraid of making a mistake that's not fair

[55:11] what are you most afraid of having happened right what are you afraid of I think it's one of the

[55:17] most powerful questions and negotiations and sales because you're sick what are you afraid of having

[55:22] happened let's play it out right and this gets into another close call let's consider the options right

[55:26] but say like that's considered the options like worst case scenario right I go to Vegas I take

[55:31] your credit card number I send it to an Igerian prince he matches everything out and you don't get the

[55:36] result you want right right okay do you think it's gonna happen no okay or at least we're not there right

[55:40] okay so we're getting close to gold we're getting closer all right what's the what's the real worst case

[55:45] and well I still want to fail again okay that's beautiful what would make you feel like you're not

[55:53] gonna fail you what would you need to say and then this as soon as they start answering this question

[55:59] you've got it just a matter because the thing is that they're gonna say I would you see this

[56:02] in this and you're like we already have that you just know about excited talk about future trail

[56:05] layer because that's not important it's important as I feel because the end of the day like you

[56:09] just have to trust that our intention because you have to trust the person more than the paper right

[56:15] you're walking through the process and so even then and then you can do future outing in the

[56:19] tube but you get the idea here so big picture or is this is this guy I've already been

[56:22] ready to use this joke because I can talk about sales all day okay get some hard stuff okay go

[56:27] Caleb's telling I still this could be the ultimate prank because I still can't see the phone

[56:32] and so right now in my mind I'm talking to myself this entire time uh self so big picture you have

[56:40] these big concentric circles from the outside people who start with the lightest bullshit because it's

[56:44] the easiest thing to cast your tip power to I don't have time I'm too busy I don't have the money

[56:49] you know this doesn't sound like a perfect fit for me those are the easy things right and we go

[56:53] one step closer that which is then is other people right and then we say hey it's about asking

[57:00] for support out for mission right and we explain how in the future they're gonna blame them for

[57:04] for everything and that's not fair to them it's not fair to the relationship you want to

[57:07] value the relationship long term this way you have to do you have to own the decision cool boom

[57:10] now we're the present and we go past present future past we get them to give up all of the

[57:15] reasons that they've failed before it is not something that's been influenced today you teach them how

[57:19] to make a decision and then you confront their concerns that they might have and you can talk around

[57:23] them right and the easiest one and I'm still working on creating a framework around this but I'll

[57:26] share it with you and you can share it with your sales teams if you like it and then I'm trying

[57:29] to figure out like a skeleton key over common so there's two that have a hiding great like you

[57:34] can use them in as ton of scenarios and I've used them all the time so you can use them for your

[57:37] number one is called the reason close and the reason close is whatever reason they give you

[57:41] you say that's the perfect reason you should do this so if they're like dude I don't have the money

[57:44] starts to program like that's the exact reason you need to do this program if they're like I don't have

[57:48] the time start the program like that's because like this is the very reason you need to program

[57:53] right it doesn't matter what the thing is you just say that's the very reason you need to do this

[57:57] right so it's called the reason close the second close is something I'm working on called like

[58:02] the hypothetical close so you guys have probably heard of like the unicorn close and the one to 10

[58:06] those are all closest that similar themes around them and if you're not familiar with that is

[58:10] you know the one to 10 closes you know if this were a one and you hated it I don't

[58:14] want to skip from one and that would be Alex you saw I hate you breath smells and I never want to see

[58:18] you again and 10 being like this is this is a program that I want to get started today right

[58:23] where are you at right and here's the key it doesn't matter what number that they say let's say

[58:27] they say six you say okay cool well what would you what would it take to make you a ten

[58:32] and they literally give you the thing that they said to get a yes and then you can also flip

[58:38] and say why aren't you a one and then they start selling you on why it's good right and so that's

[58:43] the one to 10 close the unicorn close to somewhere which is just like hey if this were some

[58:47] amazing uniform program would you do it they say yes they say now then you say cool then I don't

[58:54] think we need to talk about this that figures something else going on and then you can start attacking the

[58:57] actual the objection which is like you know trust me like let's talk about that right but

[59:03] this is what I'm working on for a skeleton T so I gave you the the reason close the other one is

[59:06] the skeleton king and so which is the hypothetical close and so this is what I'm working on some

[59:09] so the figures out but if I said whatever thing they say so let's say it's time let's say it's money

[59:16] doesn't matter and I say cool so time see issue right okay so if time worth the issue would you do it

[59:23] you ask you for this guy right and then they're like well yeah you're like cool and then we dig in and say

[59:29] then what would it look like to have time and then they have to generate the responses and we're like oh cool

[59:36] well that's not going to take that one time the first thing we're going to do is replace all these

[59:39] activities which are spending all your time on not getting results and replace with things that are

[59:44] great solve a problem and so what happens with the hypothetical close you basically take their object

[59:49] their obstacle and you just say cool if that obstacle doesn't exist what you do it because the thing is

[59:54] is once they say yes you got a hypothetical yes so all we have to do is match the conditions of the

[59:58] hypothetical yes in the real world and then we close the deal and so those are two of the strongest

[60:04] like multi use closes that work at any point in this whole kind of equation um that I like a lot

[60:10] that I've used like a fair amount and so you can use those with your team which is like hey

[60:14] sweet you guys have any more questions because I know that that was that was really valuable um like

[60:20] that was a good question uh one of the questions is uh this was from a while back but how do you

[60:26] deal with failure I mean I don't want this to sound like dismissive as an answer but like

[60:34] most people just have the wrong I'm just gonna say for a while like I just don't I don't I don't

[60:40] feel bad about failure because I don't see failure as bad and so this this jumps up into a larger

[60:47] corner's conversation which is that most people ascribe labels positive and negative labels to

[60:51] situations and so this again gets into my world view to mark again and so but we have a meaning

[60:58] maker in our in our heads and so our entire lives and our children were going around and we're

[61:02] asking good all what does that mean what does that mean and we just take whatever they tell us

[61:07] as the meaning for things right and the thing is we don't remember every single person who told us

[61:11] what every single thing meant we just took it as fact and then later on it are lives and we have

[61:16] enough other meanings that we can try and neglect positions on we can say that doesn't make sense

[61:20] I don't know if that's true and the problem that most of us have is that we deem failure and we

[61:25] were told that failure meant that we were a failure and that's false because failure is a necessary

[61:34] part is a requisite for success and so here's the thing this is something I can promise you

[61:39] if you are not failing right now you are not going to succeed it is a requisite it's a requirement

[61:45] for success and so how do I feel not bad about failure well if I told you that there was seven

[61:51] steps to success let's just say and you were on step four would you feel bad

[61:57] of course no let's just say that step four is failing

[62:01] all this is just unpacking the label that we've described to this thing and just looking at

[62:06] it for what it really is which means I made an attempt and I learned something and then I

[62:10] would work at that new learning to take one step closer to what my desired outcome is and like

[62:15] all the life is already processed not to get like two whatever but like that's what it is and so

[62:19] the ideas that we see failure is bad that's the problem that's all this so that's it genuinely and

[62:24] I hope it doesn't come unrelatable off unreelatable but like it just doesn't bother me

[62:31] everyone's asking about the your next book yeah

[62:39] I

[62:42] it will be done when it is worthy of your attention and so right now I have

[62:48] right now I've written five versions end-to-end of the lead's book and I'll just tell you

[62:53] as to the promise the problem is that the offers book was such a defined thing that I was

[62:58] that I could create a manual to solve it never going to immediately read it and then

[63:01] TEDx surprises you all these things and improve how much way they're making when it comes to

[63:05] leads it's actually a significant more cleverised topic and so it's not just like how do I do

[63:12] cool going how do I do cool emailing how do I do club esinger how do I run out how do I do

[63:17] grab mail how do I do how do I make posts how do I make content how do I make like all of

[63:22] those things are have to have to encapsulate it in the book which I think I've done an

[63:26] okay job choking up but the issue is I wanted it to also be for me if you follow any of my stuff

[63:32] there's two two things ideally three but two that are requirements is that it must be valid

[63:37] and it must be useful. Valid means that it's correct in a large number of scenarios ideally in

[63:43] all scenarios that means it has a highly agreeable entity. useful means that if I actually do this thing

[63:48] I will get the desired angle even if the y is not true but if I do these things I get the

[63:55] angle and so I'll give you an example of so something that is valid but not useful would be if I said

[64:00] something's work and something's done that is 100% valid it's also not useful at all right and on the

[64:06] flip side so many so many sales marketing and set of gurus for example say like there's seven stages

[64:13] of awareness and this is how someone walks through a lead to become a customer and they start

[64:18] retroactively putting in thoughts into a prospect's mind when we have no way to validate that.

[64:24] Now if we do the actions that they say in order to sell stuff it might totally work but it doesn't

[64:30] mean it's valid because I might buy something not for those reasons and so the idea is I need to be

[64:34] both valid I need to be useful and the third bonus for me is that's entertaining because if it's

[64:39] valid and useful then that will make people money and many self motivated people will just go through it

[64:44] for those things because they know that this is a cheat code to make you money but if I can get to be

[64:47] entertaining then I get more people to consume it ultimately with so for the book right now it is

[64:53] valid but the utility is lower outside of just baseline understanding how to market conceptually

[65:02] and so that has been the issue that I'm having because I'm trying to figure out what I need to

[65:05] like write you know eight subbooks which is a lot of work obviously and just have one book that

[65:10] explains conceptually how this works so I'll give you I'll give you some stuff that like this might be

[65:14] interesting for you guys that I had done okay what's the difference between promotion marketing

[65:18] and advertising right what does a lead what's a lead if I can a subscriber on YouTube is that

[65:27] a lead if I get a follower Instagram is that a lead what what makes it a lead what makes it not a

[65:34] lead I'll tell you the difference that I have the book which is information that you can leverage

[65:40] your credit transaction that is a lead so if I get a subscriber on YouTube it's not a lead

[65:44] if I get a follower on Instagram that is a lead right because I can leverage that conversation

[65:50] your credit transaction they would say well the follow-on YouTube would maybe buy something yes

[65:56] but after something else happens right if they commented and I said hey give me your number

[66:00] now I have the information I've just created transaction right and so I've been I've been trying

[66:05] to peel these layers back to create with absolute clarity something that people who want to

[66:11] get more customers and the the procedure of that is getting more lead flow or deal flow if I that

[66:16] they could read the book and immediately execute everything the book and increase their lead flow

[66:20] and so that has been the trouble that I've had and trying to encapsulate that simply in a

[66:25] simple book while also accounting for all of the disparate ways that you can generate leads through

[66:32] and so the second big breakthrough that I had was something that I called the advertising cycle which

[66:36] you'll have to read the book but basically I beat 58 broken models to get this to work the way I

[66:42] needed it to and I would consider this the value equation of this book and so I am working on it

[66:48] it just because we're also running acquisition stuff and actually like growing the business one

[66:53] out of writing the book takes time and I just will put out a product that I don't think is deserving

[67:00] of your attention and so I will always hold that as the hard line and so I promise that when it

[67:05] is done it will be worthy of it to the best of my human ability so with that being said I hope

[67:12] you guys enjoy the first live ever Q&A of solo if you guys can give a Caleb a shout out because

[67:19] this was all this idea and if no one's there I would blame them and I will have one of the

[67:23] bet that I've been talking myself for this entire time anyways most of the action I love you guys

[67:29] if you for some reason are new on here we have a book that's 99 cents that a lot of people

[67:34] referencing anything is 5,000 five to reviews on Amazon, Sonia and Sense if you want to check it out

[67:38] a lot of people get value from it the podcast is your podcast listener we have a podcast that

[67:45] encapsulates a lot of the stuff higher level I don't sell anything like the whole reason that

[67:48] acquisition.com is this is because I'm trying to help businesses that are doing 3 million or more

[67:53] and so if you are a business that's doing 3 million or more and you're on the internet loves to work with you

[67:57] hop on acquisition.com, fill out the fall of the four we'd love to get to 30 million and beyond

[68:02] we've done it six times already so we're pretty good at it especially for this type of business

[68:06] but if you're below 3 million and you're not in that industry where you're 3 month you're below 3 million

[68:10] and you're in that industry that's why we make the book we make YouTube we make Twitter content we make

[68:14] it's very content and we just I'm just trying to get everybody tools that need to that I wish I had

[68:20] early wrong not saying they're right I'm just saying they've worked for me so anyways

[68:23] appreciate your most ination you guys I don't deserve you but I am grateful for you nonetheless so

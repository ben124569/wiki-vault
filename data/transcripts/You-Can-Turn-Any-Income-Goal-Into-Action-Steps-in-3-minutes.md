[00:00] If I want to make a million pounds next year in 2021, obviously I get the market circumstances

[00:05] like what should I be thinking about?

[00:07] Okay, so you're doing it, everyone ready?

[00:09] So you have to think about units versus LCV.

[00:12] So when I talk about growth consulting, cash flow consulting, I've made, you know,

[00:16] handful of videos about it.

[00:18] When people pay me 50 grand for six hours, I literally break it out of these two core pieces,

[00:23] which is how much is a client worth, how many do I need to sell?

[00:27] Right? And if you want to do a million growth versus a million net,

[00:30] so we just need to be specific here. If you're just looking for a million growth,

[00:33] then you need to have your LCV at 10k, you need to sell 100 clients, right?

[00:37] Which means you need to sell two clients a week, 52, right?

[00:40] Times two, give yourself a little bit of buffer, right?

[00:42] So, and then I just reverse engineer from there.

[00:44] So if it's two clients a week and I know that I close one out of five sales calls,

[00:48] then it means I need ten sales calls a week that show.

[00:52] And if I know that, let's say your average show rate is 75%

[00:55] that I'm just going to say 15, so it's at 66 to give myself again.

[00:58] At each level I give myself a tiny buffer so that it makes it realistic that I'm going to achieve it.

[01:03] So now I need 15 calls a week. In order for me to make get 15 calls a week,

[01:08] what's my average, you know, a cost per call? Yours is like $5, but for everyone else, you know,

[01:15] it's a couple hundred dollars, but let's say yours is 50. I would say, okay, I'm going to safely

[01:19] budget 75, right? And it's 15 calls. So that's 22, 50 per week.

[01:24] And it's been the need to spend, which means that I'm spending, you know, divided by whatever seven

[01:31] is 300 bucks a day, right? And so for me to get to and how many ads do I need to make to spend

[01:38] $300 a day profitably, probably need to make ten good ads per month. And so that means I would block

[01:48] one big calendar day per month to make all the ads and the copy and all that stuff. I block out

[01:53] two to four hours a week to review them, you know, update the copy change, you know, change

[01:56] creative, et cetera. And then $300 a day yields me my 15 calls, 15 calls yields me 10 shows, 10 shows,

[02:03] yields me two sales. And then because of the back end system that I built, I know that my LTV is 10

[02:07] grand. And that's the game.

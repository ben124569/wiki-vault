[00:00] Today's topic is going to be preparation within the context of work.

[00:03] And so what I want to do today is actually reset your bar for what preparation looks like

[00:06] for the highest achieving people that I know within different context.

[00:09] So whether that sales, that's marketing, content, whatever customer success, all of these

[00:14] contexts have different types of prep.

[00:16] There's two different ways to prep that I'll talk about and give some tactics that you can use

[00:20] and maybe send to your team as well because hey, if they prep more, you'll make more.

[00:25] I'll give you an example of like a resetting that just recently happened for me.

[00:29] So I'm obviously very big on the amount of reps that it takes.

[00:33] Like volume negates luck is the number one quote that we have in the sales team wall so that

[00:39] the guys understand like it's just about the reps and we just say it all the time it's repeated

[00:43] over and over again because we also believe repetition of the same beliefs is something that will

[00:47] drive them to remember this thing because we need to be reminded more than we need to be taught.

[00:52] But recently even getting into this content game, this is about a year ago,

[00:55] I was talking to Eric and so Eric's a content creator who has 10, 15 million subscribers,

[01:03] something like that on YouTube and we were saying I was like hey, what can we do to make our

[01:08] YouTube videos better?

[01:11] So he said oh, just send me your prep case for the videos and I was like what do you mean?

[01:21] I was like you mean like the notes on my phone and he's like no,

[01:24] and I was like can you send me one of yours so I know you're talking about it?

[01:27] And so he sends me his most recent prep for one of his videos and it was like 22 pages

[01:34] for like a 15 minute video and I was like oh okay so my understanding of how much work it takes

[01:43] to do something at this level is wildly under what the reality of it is at at that level.

[01:50] And so I attended something he invited me to like a little creator meet up with some of the

[01:54] the biggest guys on YouTube. I'll just I'll just say this way you would know everybody in the room.

[02:00] And when we were there they were all discussing how much time it took them to prep for videos and a lot of

[02:04] these guys were spending two three four straight weeks of 12 hours a day to make one video per month.

[02:12] And I will tell you this is that it was in no way surprising to me after going there for two days.

[02:17] What it took and why those guys were the number one in that industry for making content that was exceptional.

[02:25] And so it completely reset my standard reset my bar for how much preparation was required to be exceptional.

[02:31] And it was because and this is why it's so silly for me because I feel like I keep learning and

[02:35] re-learning the same lessons but just in new domains is that the people who are doing way better

[02:39] than you are just working so much harder and the things that people think that someone's working like

[02:44] two times as hard or three times as hard because we tend to think in increments. We're like okay

[02:47] well I work I work this much someone must be doing twice as much work. But it's not even close to that.

[02:52] These guys are doing like literally a hundred times the work and it's not only that they have a team of

[02:56] 10 people spending four weeks to prepare one 15 minute video like the order of magnitude in terms of effort there

[03:04] You multiply by 10 times times 12 hours a day times four weeks. All of a sudden you really are at

[03:10] 1000 times the work 1500 times the work to create to be fair and outcome that is 1500 or 10,000 times better than the

[03:19] average YouTube video or whatever it is that you're making. And obviously I'm just using this as a content example

[03:23] but it applies to anything. It sells means it applies to how you prep for a date.

[03:27] Plice to how you meet the parents or the in-laws. And so I'll tell you a second story. So I am I used to do

[03:34] consulting stuff and I had a guy who was a friend or a business acquaintance who said hey man I would love it

[03:44] if we could spend a day together and I was like I don't really do that and he's like just name or price and I said fine

[03:49] actually total funds side note story with us. I was like fine I'll do it for 50 grand.

[03:54] This was ages ago and he said how about how about 35 and I said how about 75 and he was like all right 50s cool

[04:03] and I was like all right and so just aside now when someone says hey can you do it for less you can always say hey

[04:08] I can do it for more and every single time I've used that overcome it has worked so right now it's like a hundred

[04:13] percent overcome for using that highly recommend using it in a sales situation because people were like okay

[04:18] I got to understand like that's your price so that was first half of story number two it's a consultant so when I when I did that day

[04:25] what I did was I started them morning I think that we were gonna start meeting at nine and so I woke up at five

[04:33] and I spent four hours reviewing his business right because I figured my day was gonna be shot this is gonna be my day like I'm not gonna try

[04:39] do anything else and so I spent the four hours prepping and I came in to the day with I think four or five pages of notes of like

[04:47] okay here things we could do here that would better here's things on your follow-up sequence here's things on the

[04:51] on your on your on your landing pages here things that you can do from a content here's how I think your CTS could be better all of this stuff right and so I came in with it

[04:59] and the next like four hours I just spent showing him what I had spent the morning going over and at the end of the day

[05:06] he was like I have genuinely never had anyone come this prepared to something and to me I was like it was four hours a

[05:14] prep it wasn't like a crazy you know me four hours prep's nothing you know what I mean in terms of work

[05:19] but it was really confirming because this guy obviously had the money to spend 50 grand for a day or whatever and

[05:26] that he had not had that type I was like it's still bewilders me and I see that more so

[05:32] that it is remarkable how low the bar is to beat everyone else and so that's what I take that's my takeaway from that

[05:39] like on one hand you've got air acting some of these super creators who are spending

[05:43] thousands of hours on a one single piece of content but I think if you like do consulting or you do some sort of work where you do the same thing over and over again

[05:51] like you can have like a four to one ratio if I go into a meeting and it's a 60 minute meeting you can take 15 minutes before you get into the meeting

[05:57] and I think like a four to one ratio is really a one to four ratio like if it's a eight hour a day spending two hours if it's a

[06:04] 60 minute meetings spending 15 minutes if it's 20 minute meetings spending five minutes before you get on

[06:09] will make the 20 minutes two three times more effective by just having that little bit of block to say who's on this meeting

[06:16] what's the background of this what's the agenda what problem we're trying to solve it just it just absolutely focuses you

[06:22] and makes you a driver in the meeting I can just absolutely like promise you that now third one

[06:30] when we have founders you come into the portfolio so when we invest in a company one of the things that happens most commonly is a lot of them are running pay to ads

[06:37] or they start running pay to that so it's either way so either they're running ads and they hit some sort of plateau or they want to get into running at

[06:43] and so I'll tell you the story that I explained to almost all of them which is

[06:48] I say all right how many you know what do you what do you guys spend in today and they're like all right we're spending five thousand

[06:53] day okay fine so how many new ads are you making per week and a lot of times they're like oh we

[06:59] record ads once a month and I'm like okay well how many ads do you make they're like usually five or seven ads and I'm like okay

[07:06] so let me give you some context we make about 30 ads a week

[07:14] new and that's new unique video now that's not repurposing of that that's 30 core pieces which then get

[07:20] zillion doubt in terms of like let's take the hook for number one and put it as number three and then redo the same

[07:25] video those would be permutations that go from 30 to like 100 pieces of creative and as soon as I explain that they're like oh

[07:32] I was like so you're doing five to seven and you're complaining that you can't scale but the

[07:36] realities that you just can't scale given this level of creative like if you're creative is a five out of ten

[07:41] you can get to five thousand a day profitably but you're not going to get to fifty thousand a day

[07:44] profitably because you're not getting that one out of a hundred ad that can scale to colder audiences or newer

[07:51] people and so it's just the like if you have a mediocre ad like many of you guys two start running ads

[07:57] are like oh I get it to a hundred dollars today but I can't get it to be profitable at five hundred dollars today

[08:02] it's like yeah because your ad is so bad it can only go to the absolute hottest audience and then as soon as you

[08:06] goes outside of that very hot audience that kind of knows you a little bit it stops working right and so if you

[08:12] had if you went from a five out of ten ad to a seven out of ten ad then all of a sudden it's like oh I can get to

[08:15] five hundred dollars today and if you get to an eight out of a ten ad you can get to a five thousand dollars a day right

[08:20] but the nine out of ten and the ten out of ten ads like that's what converts the world but in order to get that

[08:24] ten out of ten ad you have to do so much more preparation before you do the ads and actual total volume of work

[08:30] of doing the ads itself and so I share this stuff because my entire goal of this right now

[08:35] is to reset your expectations of the amount of preparation that it takes to be good

[08:40] because it's so easy it's like media increase is the is so easy to do because you just do something

[08:46] and hey anything's better than nothing so if you're doing nothing then absolutely start but

[08:51] what happens is people are like why isn't it working for me and it's not working for you because

[08:56] you're not working nearly as much as you as what is required to get that level of output right

[09:02] so let me tell you a different story so I had a buddy of mine's ability there and he wants to

[09:08] start making content which is I am a huge proponent of this because he actually has stuff to say

[09:14] and but he's still learning the content came right and so he's like hey man can you look at my

[09:19] Instagram and tell me or sorry can you look at my he said look can you look at my social media and tell

[09:23] me what I what I want him doing wrong or what I should be doing better and so before I pull

[09:27] up his thing I was like well how many posts are you making a day across all platforms and he was like

[09:32] one I'm doing one a day right now and he said it like that kind of like he was like yeah so I'm

[09:36] doing one a day right now and I was like alright man we make at the time we were making 50

[09:43] a day we make more than that now and he just looked at me and he was like you don't need to say anymore

[09:48] he's like I got it like he understood in that moment the same thing I did when I when Eric told

[09:53] showed me his prep case for his YouTube videos I was like I get it like I'm I'm he's like thank you

[09:59] for resetting my my my measuring stick that's what he said it was like my you reset my bar reset my

[10:05] expectations of how much how much work it takes to get to that level that I want to get to

[10:11] hey if you want to get around people who are actually winning who look like you who smell like you

[10:15] who talk like you and are doing what you want to do I'd like to invite you to the the school

[10:19] games community it's school dot com for such games I take calls in there I put content that's

[10:23] like this and more personalized inside of that community and I drop a huge amount once a month

[10:28] and eight hour training on how to actually take this stuff and win anyways and so if that's

[10:33] interesting school dot com for such games see in there I share this stuff because I think what

[10:37] of the biggest gifts of surrounding yourself in a championship team so there's a book by

[10:43] Angela Duckworth called grit which is good book but one of the things that they talk about

[10:49] in the book is that one of the best ways to develop grit is to surround yourself with people who have

[10:54] grit so one of the for sure ways to get better to skills around yourself with people already have

[10:58] that skill for ahead of you and so that's why joining a championship team is one of the best things

[11:03] you can do to understand what is required to win and so when you're the the story that she tells

[11:09] in the book is uh swimmers who want to get better at swimming if you can make the the state team or

[11:15] whatever of like a championship team all of a sudden there's standards of work that you didn't

[11:21] understand is what everyone's doing so you go from like oh I'm swimming twice a week and that's what

[11:26] you can do to be best in your high school or whatever I'm making up the numbers but when you go to

[11:30] the championship team you realize that they do three hours a day twice a day and all of a sudden you're like

[11:35] oh and it's that same moment I had with Iraq I was like oh and the same moment my friend had when

[11:40] when we talked about the social media was like oh it's just this massive bar reset of like

[11:45] oh this isn't like a two times as as much thing this is like a 50 a hundred times as much and so it's just

[11:52] when you realize how much work it takes to get good you realize how few things you can get good at

[11:57] and that's where the focus becomes so important because the only way to get that good is to do a few

[12:02] things and so that's where the strategy of picking or prioritizing the things that you want to get

[12:07] good at becomes more important because you just can't do a hundred times the work on a hundred different

[12:12] things and so making sure that you're allocating your resources to the one thing that matters most

[12:17] which then forces you to prioritize what you're spending your time on would by the way I think is a really

[12:22] good activity if you can spend a day or a week thing okay if I could only have one thing be true

[12:28] about our business if I could have like if we have more traffic than anyone else we will win

[12:33] based on this model or whatever it is that we have if we have more referrals than anyone else then

[12:37] we will win no matter what if we have the best advertising in terms of paid ads if we just had that one

[12:43] thing we will win if you can be very clear about that one point of leverage then you attack it with

[12:49] absolute onslaught of hours of work and repetition and preparation for those repetitions that

[12:55] then you'll do even more and so it's like I'll give you the ad example I was saying earlier if I

[13:00] if I'm doing a hundred ads a week and my competitor is doing seven ads a month I'm doing four

[13:04] hundred to his seven all right so I'm doing I don't know what the math is there but a lot let's it's

[13:10] late fifty times sixty times more right then he is in terms of volume but not only that but when I go

[13:18] into that advertising day what am I doing beforehand I'm prepping all the I want to prep all the

[13:23] hooks at a time I want to do research of of past ads that have done really well I want to take

[13:27] different ad styles that I've seen across social media in general that I liked and like I wonder if

[13:31] we can make a version of this for how we're going to advertise our thing and by the way I love

[13:36] taking from other spaces like seeing a hotel ad or an Airbnb ad I mean oh that's would work really

[13:41] well in the software company that we have oh we've got this you know we've got this dry cleaning

[13:46] business that would work really well this ad for a gym or whatever right and I have this little

[13:50] swipe on my phone where whenever I see an ad I like I I save it and then I also screenshot it so that

[13:55] when I get into my prep sessions I already have my stuff that I want to use to prep in front of me

[14:01] and so one of the one of the big other things besides resetting your bar of expectation of how much

[14:07] prep it takes to win is that the more you prepare for stuff the more frequently you do it the

[14:12] better you will get it preparing so preparing in it itself is a skill right and so like the first time

[14:16] you prep for making ads the per time you prep for making content it's going to take you longer and

[14:21] you're going to be less efficient at it but if you know for example this is your hundredth time

[14:26] preparing for making a podcast whatever like this is my prep for this little this little podcast year

[14:30] I wrote this out ahead of time I was like these are all the things I wanted to hit on

[14:33] because I think they're important right and so I think in terms of resetting the bar

[14:37] start thinking at hundred rather than ones and twos so it's not that somebody's doing twice as

[14:41] much work or three times as much work they're doing a hundred times the work and in the example I

[14:44] gave earlier sometimes way more than a hundred times the work two more quick things on this and

[14:49] then I'll let you go about your days you can start preparing so Elon Musk recently talked about

[14:54] something when I recently said but I've heard of article or an interview from him that he said

[14:59] you reference Parkinson's law so Parkinson's law for those of you guys who don't know is that work

[15:03] expands the time a lot it right and so I think what you don't want to do is overprepared for the wrong

[15:08] thing and let me let me let me put my caveat there is that I actually think there's tremendous

[15:14] ROI to cramming meaning he uses Parkinson's law in reverse which is that it also if work expands

[15:21] the time a lot it can also shrink to the time that you shrink to and there's a reason that kids cram

[15:27] it's because it's really hierarchy ROI on their time right if they if they prefer weeks and weeks

[15:31] and then they they take the week before the exam often don't look at anything sometimes they do

[15:35] worse than just cramming right before the test and so people aren't idiots like we know that cramming

[15:41] works which is why we do it but I think I highly encourage thinking about prepping is cramming

[15:46] I actually think it works amazingly well in a business context but people somehow I've said it's

[15:51] like a bad thing because I don't even know why teachers say it's a bad thing at the end of the day

[15:55] like either ace the test you didn't and so whatever now in terms of long term like I think you know

[16:00] not sleeping the night before probably impacts you or if you like probably impacts your

[16:05] uh performance more but if you just study the day before and you study the morning of I'll promise

[16:10] you that the study the morning of will get you more than what you did the night before in terms of

[16:14] immediate result on the test more than long term retention which is different just to be clear but the

[16:19] thing is is if you're doing a meeting you're going to take notes and then you're going to delegate

[16:23] stuff and so you being able to run that meeting effectively based on you cramming for that meeting

[16:27] super hierarchy on your time and so I absolutely love the concept of cramming within within the

[16:33] world of business because a lot of times you do have something you just need to do once and you

[16:36] need to impress the client you need to impress the boss you need to you need to just come prepared

[16:41] for a company uh presentation that you're doing in front of a whole team or the department or the

[16:45] whole the whole company entirely going back to the two types of work there are is that there's two types

[16:50] of preparation you have you have preparation for things you're going to do that you do many many

[16:53] many times which you get better and better preparing for which means you can actually shrink the amount of

[16:57] time you need to prepare and I think the close you do the preparation to the event itself the

[17:02] more valuable it is and so that is why take the five minutes literally actually take the five

[17:07] minutes before the meeting to say okay this is John let me look at his profile real quick okay

[17:12] John's he's out of Milwaukee okay the bucks are doing well let me see if you if you follow the

[17:16] bucks okay you attack something there and um and his wife's name's Joyce okay got it so you get on the

[17:21] meeting you're like dude John how's it going I do the bucks are killing it oh that's fantastic how's

[17:25] Joyce doing she's good great and uh I saw um do we have is this Mike is this my he's your uh he's your

[17:31] VP of uh customer success hey Mike next to me too man um I was just looking you guys up before

[17:36] up before I got on uh um really cool stuff that you guys are doing to XYZ Corp right as soon as I say

[17:41] that they're like immediately in 60 seconds they're like this guy prepared and that's what it communicates

[17:47] and the thing is is that the idea that someone knows that you prepare literally separates you from

[17:52] so many other people who just show up and they're like oh what are we gonna do today right and so

[17:58] sure you should absolutely have be prepared in terms of the agenda in terms of you're scripting

[18:02] for how you run these meetings but you get so much return on demonstrating that you prepared like

[18:08] people know if you prepared it just it completely blows them away and I still to this day I get

[18:15] people so they're like do you thank you so much for taking the time like you I feel like you

[18:19] knew our our company I feel like you knew our business like even better than people that I've spent

[18:23] you know I've had all you know I've vendors who did all this stuff and I was like yeah I mean

[18:28] I'm not gonna walk into a meeting not knowing what I'm talking to like what are we gonna do

[18:33] spend the whole the whole time fact finding before I can actually make a recommendation around

[18:37] something well that's such a waste of time for you and me because I know what I'm looking for

[18:40] and it's gonna be really inefficient for you to exchange a via verbal and I can just click around

[18:44] and find out what I need to do especially if you're looking at from an external way in to like

[18:48] okay wire prospects not converting well I don't need to talk to you I should look at what somebody who

[18:53] doesn't talk to you would see so that I can make the recommendations or conclusions and sometimes

[18:58] that kind of preparations more valuable because they're not gonna color they're not gonna give me

[19:01] the wise and the white difficult because I don't care I'm a prospect right at least I'm gonna put

[19:05] those glasses on and so back to the the one-time thing versus the many-time thing if you do it a lot

[19:12] of times you're gonna get better better prepping and I would say preface as close to the event as you

[19:17] and I think a four to one ratio in the beginning is good 15 minutes to 60 one hour to four hours

[19:22] in terms of prep to how much work you're gonna do for whatever the thing is and over time it can

[19:25] shrink a little bit so you may like one of 10 so it's five minutes for 60 minute meeting but

[19:31] for the things that you're going to do one time that you have never done before that's where it

[19:35] actually expands the other way it goes like 10 20 hours a prep for one hour of presenting and so the

[19:44] determining how much you're willing to prepare for something that you're only gonna do once

[19:50] rather than something that you do all the time and my opinion comes up to the stakes and the

[19:54] returns and so if you're gonna go do a speech in front of a thousand people and you've never

[19:57] spoken before and it's ideally hopefully it's a topic that you do understand but you just haven't

[20:02] spoken in that environment before then I want to control for every other variable that can

[20:06] approximate me speaking in front so one I want to I want to match them to you for sure if you're

[20:09] getting up there and you don't know what you're what you're talking about like the things you're

[20:12] going to talk about well dear god you know like no wonder that you suck at talking right now

[20:17] beyond that it's how many ways can I approximate this like for example going live on social media can help you

[20:24] approximate a live audience in person is it perfect no but is it better than just talking to the mirror

[20:30] probably now if you market it now this is a real one this is actually from the fitness world

[20:35] if you get used to squatting for example I'll bring it home if you squat in the mirror every day and you

[20:41] can see yourself in your squatting if you go to a competition this actually happened to me my first

[20:45] competition I worked out at a gym that had a mirror in front of the squat rack and so I just I just

[20:48] always squat there didn't think about it when I got to a competition I had the squat rack and when I

[20:54] looked out there was no mirror it was just a crowd of people watching me squat and I was like oh this

[20:59] is weird because I didn't even realize but I it was actually so different from how I trained and so

[21:04] from that point going forward I turned around in the racks so that I would be facing the gym at

[21:07] least that I wasn't looking at the mirror so that it was closer approximation of competition and so

[21:12] as many of those variables as you can control for you want to have in the prep so that the prep

[21:17] as closely as possible approximates the performance and so there's cramming for for it like

[21:23] you having information that'll better arm you for consulting sales customer success whatever

[21:29] which by the way if you're in customer success like spending five minutes before you can on the call

[21:32] with a customer like reviewing the call notes reviewing the the notes from the sales team looking

[21:37] the person's profile before you get on dear god will they think it's absolutely amazing and it

[21:40] takes this much work like you'll you'll like they will think you're three times cooler with five

[21:45] minutes of work for a 60 minute call like I almost think that you saying hey give me five minutes

[21:50] at the beginning of the call and starting five minutes late will still even though I heat

[21:54] starting late would still yield you a better outcome at the end of the 60 minutes

[21:59] then starting on time and not being prepared it comes down to the return on effort and return on time

[22:04] and so if you're going to talk to a thousand people and this and these are let's say your

[22:08] ideal customers well if I was going to have a thousand one-one meetings how much would I prepare for

[22:14] each of those one-one meetings that was 60 minutes I might prepare 10 minutes right well if I've

[22:19] 10 minutes times a thousand that's like I don't know 167 hours right something like that and so

[22:26] if 167 hours of prep for that one thing now realistically that might not make sense because you

[22:31] do have diminishing returns and so that's why I'm speaking one to many is higher return

[22:35] but just to give yourself a context is like when we did the the book lunch I was like

[22:38] dear god how much do I prep for a thousand person audience and I'm going to have half a million people

[22:43] there I'm going to have 500 thousand have 500 times why better not waste anyone's time while I'm

[22:48] there and make sure that every second the value per second is super high and so I think again

[22:53] we have to reset our expectations of how much work it takes to prepare for the one-time performances

[22:58] based on what you expect to get from it so if it's if you're going to do one-time performance to

[23:02] ten people then maybe maybe you prepare for four hours right but if you're going to talk to a

[23:07] thousand people then maybe prepare for 40 hours and if you're going to talk to ten thousand people

[23:12] then maybe you do prepare for 400 hours or it does have a diminishing term so maybe it's $200

[23:17] right but I think what most people miss out on is they get up and they say they're talk once

[23:21] and they do it once to their wife and once they're dog and they're like you know I'm super nervous

[23:26] and so I'll leave you with this you are not nervous you're under prepared it's not that you have

[23:34] anxiety is that you didn't do the work that you know you should have done and so if I have anxiety

[23:40] about something that's coming up that has become my telltale sign that I am under prepared that I

[23:44] didn't do the work that I know I should have done and that's when you get nervous when you can

[23:49] get up on stage and you can do or whatever whatever your your your your version of the performance is

[23:53] and have absolutely zero anxiety it's because you absolutely habituated to the stressor and so

[24:00] for example if you want to get someone to stop being afraid of spiders the fastest way to do that is

[24:04] get them into a room with spiders and let them sit there have a fucking panic attack pass out

[24:09] wake up again pass out wake up again until eventually they habituate they just realize that they

[24:13] don't die and they're still there and they're a spiders and they keep living and then the

[24:18] phobia is gone they habituate and so what you want to do or at least how well I like to do it is I want

[24:23] habituate to the stressor which is if I'm stressed about this thing then it means I haven't prepared enough

[24:28] and so it's it's it's it's not imposter syndrome you're just inexperienced you're just not good enough yet

[24:36] and so I want to make sure that I can control for all the controllables first and then

[24:39] leave room for the uncontrollables but have all of my bandwidth available so that when the

[24:45] mic cuts out or the the presentation is working oh my clicker runs out of battery all of these things have

[24:50] happened that I still I'm still prepared enough that people are then are like damn he and all that really

[24:55] well it's because this wasn't my first time and that's the difference is that like when you

[25:03] you don't want people to think it's your first rodeo and so many of you are going into every meeting

[25:07] every call every appointment like it's your first rodeo and they can tell everyone can tell

[25:14] and the people who can tell the most are the people who you want to impress the most like it's very

[25:19] easy to impress poor people because they don't know any better much more difficult to impress a

[25:25] wealthy person because they know how the game works and so I see this with the like the the Rolex

[25:31] flex or the I rented the lamba for the day and look at my Instagram picture anybody who's really in

[25:36] the game is like dude my jet costs 500 Lamborghinis like I could give a fuck what you drive right

[25:41] like the way you impress them is you outwork them so to impress poor people you outspend them

[25:46] to impress wealthy people you outwork them that's the difference so if I see a kid who's not

[25:53] flexing any of that stuff but I see how hard this kid's working that's what impresses me

[25:58] if I if anything I see a younger guy who's like blowing cash to like flex I'm I'm not even neutral I'm

[26:05] less impressed I'm like dude what are you playing like who I meet him like who are you trying to impress

[26:10] and then wherever they say I'm like it's the wrong person man because the right girl also is impressed

[26:16] by hard you work because they know what that leads because people take wealth as an approximation

[26:22] for character and that's not true they say I have this Lamborghini therefore I work hard but if you just

[26:28] spend way beyond your means which is what I see it as especially if you're younger I just see that

[26:34] as your responsible insecure and so it's making sure that you're putting the right bed out

[26:40] and the best bait for getting the right people is the effort that they know you put in when they

[26:47] weren't looking and you only do that by when you show up the first time it looks like it's your

[26:53] hundredth time and they know it's the only meaning you have with them and that you took 20 hours to

[26:59] prep for it they're like all right this kids got it or this guy's got it this guy's got it she gets it

[27:05] like that's all I look him like immediately it's just like I had that conversation my billionaire buddy

[27:10] he was like you don't need to say anymore I get it and I feel that way with vendors so if I

[27:16] go to the phone with someone and they have clearly 10 hours of preparation 20 hours of preparation for

[27:20] that call they don't need to sell me that heart I'm like I get it you've demonstrated in advance

[27:26] the value that you want to provide before we start to work together like I get it like

[27:31] whatever the bill is send the invoice to you care of it let's start working together

[27:35] when someone spends all their time trying to sell me and I'm like what did you do to prepare

[27:38] and they're trying to overcome with their words you already lost and so so many of you guys

[27:42] are losing before you step into the arena you're trying to ride a bull for the first time

[27:49] on your first rodeo and then thinking that you need to have some special talent or some natural

[27:54] that's going to make it make it work like why why so and so is different or better it's because

[27:59] that guy has been three hours a day morning and afternoon every day for the last two years

[28:05] riding bulls and so he doesn't have to think about that his only thing that he's thinking about

[28:10] when he's on the ring is the uncontrollable so that he can use a hundred percent of his band with

[28:14] for oh I had the meeting and then he brought two people I didn't expect well tell me more about that

[28:19] oh that would work well with page two if you turn a page two in the in the prep file I have I think

[28:23] this will be really applicable for you and when we get there I'll definitely need your insight

[28:27] oh wow he included them in but if I didn't have that prep ahead of time I'd be like oh wow I had

[28:31] a game plan and now it's totally screwed because there's two other people who are stakeholders so

[28:36] TDR you're underprepared most of the time most of you and I'm saying this because I talk to you

[28:44] guys a lot five minutes of prep for 60 minute meeting we'll do more than trying to

[28:52] razzle dals of your way through with your words once you're on

[28:56] I think SunSuc said every battle is one before the battle begins

[00:00] All right, so quick one.

[00:01] I'll give you my very sexy headline,

[00:03] how I turned $1,362,124,996,000 for 22 in revenue

[00:10] in over 44 months using four unique acquisition frameworks.

[00:14] Would you guys want to know what those are?

[00:16] OK, cool.

[00:17] Quick writer, downer.

[00:18] Does everyone here own their own legion

[00:19] as in you know how to generate your own legion?

[00:22] Everyone does.

[00:23] OK, someone does it.

[00:25] So I'm going to give you four steps, really quickly

[00:27] before I even get into this presentation,

[00:28] because this is, I would say, these are frameworks

[00:31] that you can immediately use with the presentation

[00:34] that was given just a Mr. Burton about how

[00:36] to capture leads in one eye to your need traffic.

[00:39] And so I'm going to show you the things

[00:40] that we've used very, very successfully to get more traffic.

[00:45] But before you do that, this is something

[00:46] that you can do in less than 15 minutes

[00:48] and pretty much solve your legion problem.

[00:50] Right now, you can Google, number one,

[00:52] you can put it to somebody in your company.

[00:54] How would you run a Facebook lead at at probably seven minutes?

[00:57] Number two, how to connect Facebook lead at

[01:00] to Google Sheets via Zapier.

[01:03] Number three, give away something free

[01:06] and then target the audience that you want.

[01:09] If you don't know how to target the audience that you want,

[01:11] take your existing customer list, Google,

[01:14] how to set up a Facebook look like audience,

[01:17] and then run it to that audience.

[01:18] That's it.

[01:20] Like, yeah, Google, number one, how to run a Facebook lead

[01:24] at Google number two, how to connect Facebook lead

[01:27] at to Google Sheets with Zapier, ZAPI-E-R.

[01:32] Number three, you're going to target your

[01:37] either local audience or whatever audience it is

[01:39] that you use.

[01:40] If it's not local, then you'll upload a customer list.

[01:42] If you don't know how to do that, that would be video

[01:44] number four, which is how to create a look like audience.

[01:48] Run a Facebook.

[01:49] And then number five, give them something for free

[01:52] and exchange for their phone number.

[01:54] That's it.

[01:55] You can get leads.

[01:56] You're welcome.

[01:57] It'll take you 60 minutes.

[01:58] And this, by the way, is what every third party

[02:01] lead gen company is doing, and they charge you five times

[02:04] more for that process.

[02:05] They also pay someone, and just from a belief standpoint,

[02:08] every single, I know all the guys in that space,

[02:10] the guys pushing the buttons, they train in less than seven

[02:13] days with two hours of videos, and they're paid under

[02:18] 15 bucks an hour.

[02:19] This is not hard stuff.

[02:20] People just don't know how to do it.

[02:21] And now it's very easy in its own YouTube.

[02:23] Cool, because that's like the really button-clicky stuff.

[02:26] I was going to stand up here and be like, all right,

[02:28] connect here, and that thing that would be a waste

[02:30] everyone's time.

[02:31] So this is going to be the stuff that's going to make

[02:33] the return on that significantly higher.

[02:36] So that's not a cool.

[02:37] All right, awesome.

[02:38] Yeah, 112 million.

[02:39] That was cool.

[02:40] All right.

[02:40] So using the four frameworks, we're going to double down

[02:44] again and again.

[02:45] So that literally was my bank account.

[02:47] And over the next 44 months, we're going to spend 3.1

[02:50] million in advertising, which gives us a 36 to one

[02:54] lifetime return on advertising.

[02:56] So I don't know what your return on advertising on.

[02:59] But I'm told that's pretty good.

[03:00] And so I'll just work well for us.

[03:04] OK, so that's me.

[03:06] Go Founder.

[03:06] I'm going to do it for life.

[03:08] Who's up here?

[03:09] Being awesome.

[03:10] And dealing with me.

[03:11] But that was me when I started to Albert,

[03:12] you and I have very similar stories.

[03:14] Sled up on the floor.

[03:15] I had no idea what I was doing.

[03:16] Went to a Facebook marketing event literally

[03:18] the week before my gym opened.

[03:19] And was like, oh, so this is how I'll get customers.

[03:22] And I was able to actually fill my gym

[03:23] up using that stuff in 2013.

[03:25] And so I was able to scale from zero to six locations

[03:27] under three years as a kid off cash flow, which is pretty neat.

[03:32] And then I sold all of those and lost everything.

[03:36] And that's where my bank account was at the end.

[03:38] Because I then I got into business with who's

[03:39] in dieted for fraud.

[03:41] And so I had that entire process.

[03:43] And then I had nothing again.

[03:44] I screenshot it because I was like,

[03:46] I don't want to tell the story.

[03:47] So from there, because I still was good running gyms,

[03:51] we started gym watching my wife and I.

[03:54] We went for zero dollars when I took that picture

[03:56] to 2.4 million a month and 18 months.

[03:59] We ran 74% net margins on that business, very good business.

[04:03] First of all, I was going from 0.7.

[04:05] And it's six months.

[04:06] The reason I'm telling you the speed on these

[04:07] is because the acquisitions that I'm going to share with you.

[04:09] All in which it is went from 0.4 and six months.

[04:13] This is actually my last week.

[04:14] And I had the recent acquisition.

[04:15] We went from 40k to 700,000 a month and 10 months.

[04:18] And so just to you have an idea in terms of different spaces.

[04:20] That's B to B licensing.

[04:21] This is e-commerce, direct to consumer.

[04:24] This is agency software.

[04:26] And then this one is a brick and mortar chain

[04:28] of childhood, magical experiences.

[04:31] The thing is, you should see the numbers buying this thing.

[04:33] Anyhow, so this is what we do now.

[04:36] Taking interest in 78 multi-figure businesses

[04:37] and grow to excellent three-fifters.

[04:39] That's what we do.

[04:40] The reason that this presentation is so cool for me

[04:42] is that I don't usually get to talk about this stuff,

[04:44] so I'm pumped about it.

[04:45] But what was really cool was during that process,

[04:48] we've made over a thousand success stories,

[04:49] like a lot of success stories using the frameworks

[04:53] I want to show you, create 71 millionaires in counting.

[04:55] So very happy about that.

[04:56] And so I just want to take you through the frameworks

[04:58] that we use to scale our companies.

[05:00] And this is what we do when we're scaling companies.

[05:02] The same checklist every time.

[05:04] This is what I look at.

[05:06] So this should be right for everyone who's either

[05:08] under 100,000 dollars a month.

[05:10] This should help you establish your first reliable acquisition

[05:12] channel.

[05:13] What I said in the very beginning, that's the tactics.

[05:15] Google is by videos.

[05:16] You'll have Legion.

[05:17] That's that.

[05:18] I'll show you how to do it and make way more money for it.

[05:20] The second is if you're a bobero 100,000 dollars a month,

[05:23] I get your next acquisition channel profitable.

[05:25] So you can get your current acquisition.

[05:27] To your next acquisition,

[05:28] Brian asked me to give you some really tactical shit

[05:30] they can use.

[05:32] So the fourth primers, my goal is not to break the leaf

[05:35] for some stories or vote of anyone.

[05:36] I'm going to say this stuff that's like working right now.

[05:38] So mentor one was totally a businessist

[05:40] to give a golden BBs and not silver bullets.

[05:42] So today my goal is to give you as many golden BBs as possible.

[05:45] Very candidly.

[05:46] There's going to be a lot of things.

[05:48] You're going to think about this like a checklist.

[05:49] Are you going to have a whole here.

[05:50] There's a pocket money here, a pocket money here.

[05:52] And I just want you to scoop up as many of the ones

[05:54] that makes sense to you.

[05:55] Some of them you already have.

[05:56] So we give maybe not.

[05:57] But you'll have by the end of this presentation

[05:58] I think you'll have a lot of ways to make more.

[06:00] So quick round work.

[06:02] This is the first thing we do.

[06:03] So only two ways to grow a business.

[06:04] That is it.

[06:05] I start from the top and then we'll break it down from there.

[06:08] Number one is you get more customers.

[06:10] Seems obvious, right?

[06:12] This is where everyone looks.

[06:13] Number two, make customers worth more.

[06:15] There's no other way.

[06:16] That's it.

[06:17] Get more more.

[06:18] Make it more with more.

[06:19] And sometimes some places you get the ultimate intelligence.

[06:22] Think you can cook or sell that or add a stall.

[06:24] Either way.

[06:25] It's so cool.

[06:26] But since everyone you're probably is trying to grow your business,

[06:28] that's all we're going to talk about.

[06:29] So fourth one, Mark's one.

[06:30] Get more customers too.

[06:31] Make more money.

[06:32] Second one.

[06:33] The math.

[06:34] Which is going to be how do a car customer is in profit?

[06:36] Who here is a marketing budget?

[06:37] Get more marketing budget?

[06:38] How are we going to get rid of that?

[06:40] Shouldn't have one.

[06:41] Because if you can spend a car customer's edit profit is and they are

[06:45] a net cash flow positive.

[06:46] It means I make money before I even have my credit card do.

[06:49] Which means it eliminates a acquisition as a bottom deck in your business.

[06:53] And B, if you don't have capital, like you saw in my big account at the beginning of

[06:56] this thing, you can compete against anyone's still.

[06:59] If you have the skill, like this is real.

[07:01] You can still crush it right now.

[07:03] I guess people who have way more money because they don't know the game, right?

[07:06] The game that's happening under everyone's nose.

[07:08] So that's the math.

[07:09] We call that customer client finance acquisition.

[07:11] And we're choose the offer.

[07:13] So how to get complete strangers to raise their hands and make offer so good they feel

[07:17] stupid saying no.

[07:18] All right.

[07:19] So I'll show you how to kind of high set that little ad.

[07:20] That's going to break down what we do there.

[07:22] Number three is the traffic.

[07:24] So once you have those two things in place, you know what math you need to hit.

[07:27] You know what you're going to give them.

[07:29] Then we got to go find traffic.

[07:30] All right.

[07:31] So I'll give you the six traffic sources that exist right now that everyone has access to.

[07:34] And my hope is that you'll probably find two or three traffic sources that are in front

[07:37] of you.

[07:38] I've got a special page for Brad and there.

[07:39] So you can look out for that.

[07:40] Your team can look out for that.

[07:41] It's our money to do us homework.

[07:42] And then the fourth one is the money.

[07:45] Right.

[07:46] So the whole point here is to make money.

[07:47] I'll show you exactly how we maximize back back in LTV, which informs the front end, which

[07:51] is why ultimately it's much more of a circle than it is steps.

[07:55] So make sense.

[07:56] We have the math.

[07:57] We make our offer go to the traffic.

[07:59] We make money, which means we update our math and run and run and run and we go.

[08:02] All right.

[08:03] That's the game plan.

[08:04] Cool.

[08:05] All right.

[08:06] Rock and roll.

[08:07] So if you like childhood pictures, this is what I like to do.

[08:09] So you see a lot of doodles in this presentation.

[08:11] This is the simple way of seeing it.

[08:13] So you got the math traffic, offer a beat, and then you got the money that you're

[08:16] willing to do.

[08:17] Okay?

[08:18] Quite literally.

[08:19] So we're going to start with the math.

[08:20] There we go.

[08:21] Client find his deck was just, how to acquire customers out of profit.

[08:24] This is the entire process mapped out.

[08:26] Don't worry.

[08:27] You'll operate on each of these steps.

[08:29] But this is what it is.

[08:30] All right.

[08:31] So this is, I'm going to show you how to make money with no money.

[08:35] Which means if you have money, you'll be able to do far better than this.

[08:38] This is how you do it if you have $0.00 in your bank account right now.

[08:41] So if you have less money than your competition or feel like you need to spit or you're

[08:44] spending too much to a bar customer, this is for you.

[08:46] This is how you do it.

[08:47] So quick definitions are quite cost-to-car customer.

[08:50] Because sometimes I say these quickly and I forget what I'm talking to.

[08:52] So cost-to-car customer, I say, cack.

[08:54] All right.

[08:55] All cost required to a bar in your customer, advertising payroll, media buyer, paid off

[08:59] teams offer all that stuff, is cost-to-car customer.

[09:02] Number two, cost of good sold, direct cost of fulfillment.

[09:05] Gross profits.

[09:06] The amount of money that is left over after the direct cost of fulfilling.

[09:10] So if you have one more customer, how much extra would you have to pay for the fill that,

[09:13] everything after that is to juice, gross profit.

[09:15] Pay back period.

[09:16] The time of period takes the business to receive the gross profit necessary that it cost

[09:20] to do a car or the customer back.

[09:22] Put a dollar in, you get a customer tomorrow and then it takes you two months before you get

[09:26] that cash back in your wallet to spend again.

[09:28] All right.

[09:29] Those are your cash conversion cycles.

[09:30] I'm going to show you how we do this quickly.

[09:32] The more you can cadets the cash conversion cycle, the faster you can grow.

[09:35] All right.

[09:36] Especially if you don't have funding which I've never had.

[09:37] All right.

[09:38] The big cash is something that is not that I invented.

[09:40] It is just something that we track which is the amount of gross profit that I can attract

[09:44] from New Testament the first 30 days.

[09:46] The reason I track this so vehemently is that like many business owners here, everyone has

[09:51] access to one thing which is a credit card.

[09:53] And so I basically know that I have 30 days against the clock that I can spend whatever

[09:58] I want and as long as I have it back, plus some in 30 days, I never have to use my money

[10:03] to grow.

[10:04] So I have all the financing I need and I can grow for free.

[10:07] I essentially get my customers to pay for the growth of my business.

[10:10] Okay.

[10:11] So this is the only math equation the entire thing.

[10:13] This equation is what has created everything in my life.

[10:16] Your 30-day cash, so this is the planning list of this.

[10:19] I have to generate more cash in the first 30 days of running and advertising than it cost

[10:23] me to acquire two customers and the cost of the bill both of them.

[10:27] Cost of acquiring customer and the cost of fulfilling them times two.

[10:31] If I can make more than that in the first 30 days off of one customer, I can grow unlimited.

[10:37] That's only one from zero to two million, zero to two million, zero to whatever in six

[10:40] months, eight months, ten months because it really becomes operational drag not about the

[10:44] acquisition.

[10:45] So, and it's not positive cash flow.

[10:47] So that entire process while you're growing, we're taking cash out every single month

[10:51] while we're growing.

[10:52] It's cool to experience.

[10:54] And so this allows all of us smaller players who are not BC backed, tout's been everyone.

[10:58] Okay.

[10:59] So this is a quick walkthrough.

[11:00] I'm drilling this one in because it's really important to understand the concept

[11:02] works.

[11:03] So, I've got a $100 from a credit card to a part of two customers at $50 each.

[11:06] This is a hypothetical.

[11:08] Two of those customers each spend $300 with you.

[11:11] So you make $600 bucks.

[11:12] Now you're hot.

[11:13] But you still have to fill the customer.

[11:15] So cost you $50 each, $100 total.

[11:17] At the end, you have $400 plus, you have two new customers and you can continue to sell those.

[11:22] And you have $400 in your bank account.

[11:24] With this looks like visually, you have to do.

[11:26] This is how you generate a bucket of cash.

[11:27] Yes.

[11:28] All right.

[11:29] This is what it looks like visually.

[11:30] I'm a big visual guy.

[11:31] So zero debt, zero money, zero customers, day zero.

[11:34] All right.

[11:35] From there, we take our little debt.

[11:37] There we go.

[11:38] $100.

[11:39] And we spend $100 bucks in ads.

[11:40] We do exactly what I said in the beginning.

[11:42] You're going to get your, you're going to run your little ads and you're going to get your

[11:44] offdance.

[11:45] There we go.

[11:46] So they're going to run the ads in front of eyeballs.

[11:48] I'm also going to get clicks, which we're going to track for us.

[11:51] Right.

[11:52] We're going to get offdance.

[11:53] We're going to schedule them.

[11:54] We're going to show.

[11:55] And then we're going to get sales.

[11:56] And there's two of those people.

[11:57] So it's visually what I just said.

[11:59] I'm just depicting it for you.

[12:00] All right.

[12:01] And now we have to fill the fill fill fill fill this people.

[12:03] So 600 goes to 500.

[12:05] 500 goes to 400.

[12:06] 400 goes to my bank account.

[12:08] And after the dust settles, this is what happens.

[12:12] It gets dispensed though.

[12:13] Right.

[12:14] When the dust settles, I have debt free.

[12:16] I have $400 in cash.

[12:19] And I have two customers that I can now sell.

[12:21] Whatever the fuck I want for free.

[12:22] That's the game.

[12:23] You can add zero subtract zero, but this is what we're doing.

[12:26] All right.

[12:27] So you have to understand the math before we get into the stuff.

[12:28] This is what I double down.

[12:29] So then you double it down again.

[12:30] You do the whole process.

[12:31] Boom.

[12:33] 800.

[12:34] Four.

[12:35] Because the fulfillment is slowly just going black on Vegas.

[12:36] And Vegas again.

[12:37] And then that was our first round.

[12:39] And our second round.

[12:40] We doubled the amount of customers.

[12:41] The third round.

[12:42] We called the third round.

[12:43] We called the third round.

[12:44] And around around.

[12:45] We go.

[12:46] If you can actually call it money acquisition until your operations break.

[12:48] This will therefore eliminate the need for capitals to constrain on your growth.

[12:52] I think this is a big deal.

[12:54] Just like cool.

[12:55] I just want to make sure I'm like.

[12:56] Jock on them.

[12:57] Okay.

[12:58] Cool.

[12:59] The math.

[13:00] How do car customers is a profit?

[13:01] Client by any exact position.

[13:02] And there's my little arrow and my check mark.

[13:05] It's been a long time.

[13:06] I'll make sure the check mark for it.

[13:08] Okay.

[13:09] The offer.

[13:10] How to make offer so good people feel stupid saying no.

[13:11] That's a little worry guy right here.

[13:13] Gotta get the fish used to bite.

[13:14] Great.

[13:15] Great.

[13:16] So I'm always having a big offer so good people to stupid saying no.

[13:17] So the problem.

[13:18] So right now the first one I said is right now if you spend too much money with car

[13:21] customers or you have a working budget or any of those types of things that you're

[13:24] problem.

[13:25] If you don't have that problem, this might be your problem.

[13:27] If your ads are converting well.

[13:28] All right.

[13:29] Click versus opt it.

[13:30] Like you're like I feel like we're spending but we're not getting shit right.

[13:33] Or you're sales team has trouble scaling.

[13:35] Like it's hard to ramp up new guys.

[13:37] They're having trouble closing.

[13:38] Like kind of stuff.

[13:39] Obviously the sales bar you've already got covered.

[13:41] But a lot of times it's the offer.

[13:42] So I just actually had a consulting day yesterday.

[13:44] We read about the entire offer.

[13:46] And I'll give you a couple of cool examples that I've done with the companies that

[13:49] are worked with.

[13:50] So to catch fishing you bake or an offer, you start to put many conversations to initiate

[13:53] transaction with a customer.

[13:54] Will you are literally providing to them and exchange for their money.

[13:57] Usually with marketing campaigns, it's going to be the number one driver of success.

[14:00] What does it do?

[14:01] If you do this proper, let alone a vacuum.

[14:03] So you don't have price shopping or any of that stuff.

[14:05] All right.

[14:06] Create a category when it forces customers to make a value based decision instead of a price based

[14:11] decision.

[14:12] Lay on I sell days of our time for 100 grand.

[14:15] And like that doesn't make any sense because there's plenty of marketing from

[14:19] studio full day for free or a thousand dollars.

[14:22] But because it's incomparable, they'll do that.

[14:25] All right.

[14:26] People will pay it.

[14:27] So the goal is to decolonatize the offer.

[14:30] And if we do this properly, we'll increase our click-through rates, our CTRs, which means

[14:34] of the eyeballs that see it more people to say decided to take one step towards us.

[14:39] Of the people take a step towards us, more of them think it's interesting and decide

[14:42] you opt in.

[14:43] And then, not only that, once they're on the phone with us because the offer is so compelling,

[14:47] more of them say yes.

[14:48] And so this is the multiplicative effect.

[14:50] And so the translation is more leads more sales higher prices.

[14:53] So here's two real life examples.

[14:55] So when I had my little Jim, I struggled to sell it $99 a month boot camp.

[15:00] I could even close people on a free trial.

[15:03] It was sad.

[15:04] I switched from a $99 a month boot camp to a free six-week challenge.

[15:09] And the way that we structured the offer was people would come in.

[15:12] They would put $600 down.

[15:14] They lost 20 pounds.

[15:16] I'd give them the money back.

[15:18] But, 48 hours after they bought, we sell $300 supplements.

[15:22] Twenty-one days after that, we'd say, hey, you want to just win the challenge right now.

[15:26] Stay on as a member.

[15:27] You give it the $600 back as credit towards a membership.

[15:30] You want to do that?

[15:31] We close 70 to 80 percent of people on that.

[15:33] And so if you followed the money, it was just $600, $312, 12 month contract.

[15:39] My cost of acquisition dropped by a tenth.

[15:44] And we would get 30 to one off the front, but four are membership dues.

[15:49] So the reason I was able to have been six gyms in three years of the 23rd

[15:53] who didn't know shit about fuck was because I was making so much money in the first 30 days.

[15:58] I could open a gym, sign a lease, and have it completely full, and someone else's money

[16:01] before the first point showed up.

[16:03] And I had all the payroll staff and pay for it.

[16:05] The next six weeks before the EFT kicked it, EFT's the record revenue in the gym.

[16:09] And so it was simply by changing the offer.

[16:12] I was still using the same platforms.

[16:14] I was still the same salesman, but it was changing the offer.

[16:17] So many more people clicked.

[16:18] So many more people bought.

[16:20] We had so much more cash flow front.

[16:21] And I'll give you seven cool upfront offers that you guys can take home with you.

[16:25] Here's a different example.

[16:26] B to B agency.

[16:27] All right.

[16:28] So a lot of agencies that are in the lead gym room for small businesses,

[16:30] charge like $1,500 bucks a month.

[16:32] We switched that for the agencies that use our software to pay me once,

[16:37] and then only pay me after that if someone shows up.

[16:40] Well, generate the lead.

[16:41] We'll work the lead.

[16:42] We'll do everything.

[16:43] If they show up to the appointment that you pay us,

[16:44] I do not like that.

[16:45] Right?

[16:46] We went from the average agency getting half to one returns on their advertising,

[16:51] to getting 11 to one returns before their retainer.

[16:54] But four, before they got all the recurring revenue in the back end.

[16:57] Which means that they would make 11 to one in that 30 day cycle.

[17:00] They could keep pouring cash in.

[17:02] And so they're constraints for operational and not acquisition based.

[17:05] All right.

[17:06] So there's been a $10,000 a month.

[17:08] This was before and after.

[17:10] Is the same amount of impressions.

[17:12] The response rate.

[17:13] These one went through the roof.

[17:14] There's two and a half times higher percentage of people who responded.

[17:18] All right.

[17:19] After that, you had a higher result of people who were booking.

[17:22] There we go.

[17:23] Look at the difference in appointments.

[17:24] Same advertising spent.

[17:26] Same show rates.

[17:27] Closing percentage 2.3x because the offer was better.

[17:30] So we already have a 2.5 and a 2.5 and a 2.5 and a 2.5.

[17:33] Let's see how far we can go.

[17:34] In the price, we called Ripple the price.

[17:37] We went from a thousand down to $1500 a month.

[17:39] To pay me $4,000 a day.

[17:40] That's it.

[17:41] You never have to pay me again unless someone shows up.

[17:46] But that basically just made me get the first three months of front.

[17:49] And then we still got paid two days later when the first person showed up.

[17:52] And so the difference was, taking $5,000 off your $10,000 of advancement.

[17:57] $212,000 off front.

[18:00] And 11.2 to 1 return before the back end kicked in.

[18:05] Is that like, is everyone getting this?

[18:07] This stuff happens now.

[18:09] Okay.

[18:10] So you might think that's so neat.

[18:13] But how?

[18:14] Excellent question.

[18:15] So when we're looking at offers, there's seven things that I'm looking at.

[18:18] So how can I improve this offer?

[18:20] So whatever it is, if you're the business owner, which requires you to raise your hand, you have control over this.

[18:24] The first thing is, what is the promotion?

[18:26] It's either going to be free, discount or premium.

[18:29] The second is the core offer, which is the main thing.

[18:32] It's the stake, not the sizzle.

[18:33] I'll explain the difference in the second.

[18:35] The bonus is, these are the things that are provided in addition to the main thing.

[18:38] Do you do scarcity?

[18:40] We have an X left.

[18:41] And I'll show you how to do these, even if you don't have X left and do it more linearly.

[18:45] All right.

[18:46] Urgently.

[18:47] I'll show you how to configure the offer so it feels like it's tomorrow, even though it may not necessarily end tomorrow.

[18:52] But it doesn't the way that you can position or explain how.

[18:55] All right.

[18:56] I'll show you how to stack guarantees.

[18:58] If anyone have a guarantee, I'll show you how to multiple guarantees.

[19:02] If we're stack guarantees before, very interesting.

[19:04] I'll show you how.

[19:05] All right.

[19:06] And then seven is the match of naming form.

[19:08] So one of the cool things about this is that if you run this play over time, it gets tired.

[19:12] Like the marketplace is seen before.

[19:14] And so I'll show you how to re-skin the same thing over and over and over again.

[19:18] That's what allows you to get evergreenly generation.

[19:20] So three.

[19:21] So quick point on this.

[19:24] If I'm starting with a new business, I pretty much always start with something free.

[19:28] And I do that because the first thing I'm going to do is always create flow.

[19:31] I create flow that I'm monetized the flow and then I add friction.

[19:35] So if you're like, man, I'm so worried about being overwhelmed with leads and like, well, fuck you.

[19:39] All right.

[19:40] So the point is that typically free offers will convert if five to 10 times any other type of offer.

[19:47] All right.

[19:48] So I'll always start here and then try and use my brain to figure out how can I turn something that's free.

[19:52] And it's something I give pay for.

[19:53] And I'm going to give you seven offers structures to show you how to do that.

[19:56] There's 19 in total.

[19:57] You can get the rest in my book for $10.

[20:00] And this is where I start every business.

[20:02] All right.

[20:03] So that's free.

[20:04] Second is discounts.

[20:05] One thing that's important to look at with discount is that there's four different ways to display them.

[20:09] All right.

[20:10] So if you have a discount offer right now that's tired, you can read a display the same thing in different ways.

[20:13] So if you could say it's experts in a job, you can also flip it and say what the absolute amount is off.

[20:18] You say the relative amount.

[20:19] So it's enough to save your entire, your time on this mortgage.

[20:22] If you're as beat a beat or beat a city.

[20:24] Or a poor poor.

[20:25] That's enough to get a state dinner once a week in savings.

[20:28] Right.

[20:29] So it's how to display the same thing in different ways.

[20:31] Right.

[20:32] And then the final way is doing is just saying what the price is now versus what it was before.

[20:36] All right.

[20:37] So it's four different ways you can display a discount.

[20:38] And that's what will keep your promotion fresh.

[20:40] And then obviously finally is the premium offer.

[20:43] This is what I call street for the jugular.

[20:45] This is when you're selling your $100,000 a day.

[20:48] What's interesting about when you do premium offers, most of the time you just need to charge way more than you think you should.

[20:54] And then these, the economics behind this can get really wild because in terms of return on aspen,

[20:59] if I'm selling $100,000, $500,000,000,000,000,000,000 things,

[21:03] the other people competing against usually aren't selling anything close to those types of prices.

[21:08] And so that's how we can get 30 to 150 to 100 returns on advertising on a regular basis.

[21:13] Because we looked at 36 to one that means half of my advertising's got to be more than 36 to one return.

[21:17] Why?

[21:18] Right.

[21:19] And so it's because we use premium offers, but we layer them after.

[21:22] So bring them in free and then we'll upsell them through premium stuff.

[21:26] So that's number one.

[21:27] Number two is the main thing.

[21:29] All right. The stick.

[21:30] Most of times when someone is working on it offer of some type,

[21:34] they've got some sort of service.

[21:35] It's really boring and it's not very attractive, right?

[21:38] And so there are four very most value that we've broken down after looking at this at a lot of times and looking a lot of offers.

[21:44] The first is the dream outcome.

[21:46] All right. So everything on the top side of this equation is stuff that people value.

[21:49] They want more of this. This is great.

[21:51] We try and increase this.

[21:52] The bottom side of the equation is stuff that detracts from the experience that makes them less likely to want to be.

[21:56] All right.

[21:57] So the time delay effort and sacrifice.

[21:59] All right.

[22:00] As I've studied as a quick aside, as I've studied bigger, more successful businesses.

[22:05] I noticed that in my beginner days, I focused a lot more here on promising more.

[22:10] Trying to paint this beautiful vision of the future.

[22:12] When I look at Netflix and Amazon and these guys were trying to make seamless experience so that thoughts can become,

[22:18] you know, drugs, delivery packages that are door.

[22:21] Is they're trying to eliminate as much efforts act twice in time as possible for their customers and that is how they're increasing value.

[22:27] And so as we've shifted our businesses, we focus a lot more on this now than we did here.

[22:32] But just something to consider.

[22:35] All right. I'll give you an example of each one.

[22:37] If I'm trying to get Brad to give me money, I'm probably going to say, hey, Brad, let me show you how to do this marketing stuff for life speed,

[22:43] rather than hey, I'm going to get you a six pack.

[22:45] Why? Because for him, he values that more.

[22:48] And so whatever the thing is that you're selling the audience now for a woman, it might be different, right?

[22:53] But for the avatar, painting the dream outcome will increase the value, right?

[22:57] Making sure that once that like it's compared to different offers, right?

[23:01] B to B versus B to say once if you're comparing two things in the exact same market that are same,

[23:05] that are satisfying to same need, I'll just use weight loss as example, because everyone understands that one.

[23:10] Then you kind of move on to the next step in the equation.

[23:12] The next is perceived like we hit a achievement.

[23:14] So if I have somebody who's a plastic surgeon and they say they can do a tummy talk,

[23:19] and this guy's done, this is his first surgery that he's ever done, you got another guy who's done 10,000 surgeries,

[23:24] are you willing to paint more for the guy who's done 10,000 surgeries? Same surgery.

[23:28] And I should probably take the guy to 10,000 even less time too, because we value the perceived likelihood of achieving our goal, right?

[23:34] Certainty and decreasing risk is something that we value.

[23:37] So if you can think about ways that you can decrease the perceived risk in the customer's minds and I'll show you more of the tactics about that later.

[23:43] But if this is where the social proof, this is where the testimonials will, this is where the video,

[23:48] the video that you have that watch in the lobby of the lady whose life got changed, all of that stuff will literally increase the value of what you're

[23:54] selling without having to do anything to it. It's simply the perception of the value.

[23:57] Now that's the top side of the equation, that's kind of the easy part. I'll make you out of money and here's all these people who have made money too.

[24:03] Whoo, right? The bottom side is where it gets interesting.

[24:06] So time delay. There's two components of time delay to increase the value of the product that you're selling.

[24:10] One is the immediate first first outcome. So for example, if a girl comes to watch out of the gym, please wait lost, right?

[24:18] And she feels better the first day. She has, she has an immediate value for seat of value, right? She doesn't look better, but she feels better, right?

[24:27] And so you want to have some sort of first-wing early.

[24:30] But the second piece is how long is it going to really take so and so to hit their goal, right?

[24:34] It's going to take them a year. If I can shrink the time horizon, then I will increase the value of the product from selling.

[24:40] When the easiest and best ways to make a product more valuable is look at what everyone else can do and if a time period and cut it in half and then deliver that.

[24:48] So easy thing in the world to sell. Speed. People love speed.

[24:52] All right? And so if we can shrink the time delay between when they buy and when they get, our product becomes more valuable.

[24:58] Next one is effort and sacrifice. So if I'm trying to sell, so you can use it on losing weight and I say you've got two options here.

[25:06] Option one is you can give up everything you love. You can wake up at 4 o'clock in the morning every day. You can be sores help.

[25:12] You have to eat separately from your family. You know, you gotta have people laugh at you, you gotta risk injury.

[25:18] All of that stuff. And by the way, it's going to take 12 months maybe, right?

[25:22] For you to get to where you want to go. Right? Or you can just breathe in some gas and wake up skinny, which one is she going to pick?

[25:30] Right? Reality is that's why the same outcome is 50,000 dollars for one.

[25:36] And you got to arm wrestle so much for an hour to get close and for a thousand dollar deal for training or gym membership.

[25:42] Right? It's because the same dream outcome has she knows she's probably not going to show up to the gym.

[25:48] So we're perceived like good if achievement's low. She knows it's going to take her fucking forever. She's going to give up everything she loves.

[25:54] Right? And she's going to also have to, it's like the only thing she's going to enjoy is the fact that she feels better.

[25:59] And that's it. And so if you can look at these four variables within the context of what you are selling, you can manipulate these to make the core thing more valuable, simply by changing their perception around it.

[26:08] So that's the main thing. That's the stake, right? That's the main stuff that we're offering.

[26:12] So first is we're going to try and figure out if we can do some sort of free or discount version.

[26:16] The second is if you look at the main thing and see if there's ways that we can make the thing more valuable.

[26:20] Third, now notice when you have free or discount, you can give away bonuses as part of the free thing and then upsell the core thing, which I'll get to in a minute.

[26:28] But the bonuses are things that we've provided in addition to the main thing.

[26:32] All right? So for example, when I used to sell those boot camps, let's talk about earlier,

[26:38] I was selling $99 with boot camp. I was throwing everything I possibly could.

[26:42] I was like, how's your food? I'll give you massages. I'll drive you home.

[26:46] Like whatever you want, please sign up, right?

[26:48] What's interesting is that if I just say, hey, you get the workouts.

[26:52] But if you sign up today, I'll also give you food preparation instructions in eating outguide, you know, grocery list.

[26:58] I'll give you how to eat on the weekends, how to drink alcohol and say skinny.

[27:03] Like all of these extra bonuses, but only if you sign up today.

[27:05] All of a sudden, my core offering, which is literally the same thing I was doing before, is perceived as more valuable.

[27:10] And this is what it looks like visually, because you make the ask after the core offer, right?

[27:15] If you're selling. And then if they say no, or they say, you need to think about whatever, right?

[27:20] That's when you start stacking. Because when someone sits down at like the whole time, the first thing you present after you've been selling this whole year to time,

[27:27] that's what they anchor with. So just like there's a price acre, there's a product anchor.

[27:32] And so they think in their mind, this is what he's been trying to sell me this whole time.

[27:37] And so they're going to anchor, okay, well, I tried to compare this price to this product.

[27:41] But then what I do is you stack and stack and stack.

[27:46] And then all of a sudden the product, the bonuses seem like such a steel, compared to the thing that I originally mentioned, that it's like why be a fucking idiots and not say yes today.

[27:55] So when you can stack this stuff, it also gives you a really nice way to get around the whole discount thing.

[28:00] So rather than it's rather than be like, well, let me talk to my manager, so you can get to 10% off.

[28:04] It's like, well, how about we throw this instead? And we throw you this instead. Let me throw you this instead on top, right?

[28:09] And so that way gives the sales guys, like our guys have a huge bolt of private access client materials that they can use to close deals.

[28:17] And they have street value because they're listening, right?

[28:20] So in a sense, you can literally make products. Put them on your side.

[28:23] You might sell and might not, doesn't matter. The money that they've received is valuable.

[28:27] And then you can sell something for $2,000 and give them $15,000 of prizes.

[28:31] Whatever, I've sold the bonuses. I have more bonuses. They're always more bonuses.

[28:35] I have lots of bonuses. Okay.

[28:38] So that's the sizzle, right? So the stake and then that's the sizzle.

[28:41] So if I'm looking at a business, the first thing I'm looking at is the promotion.

[28:44] The next thing is I'm going to see how I can adjust the stake and make it more valuable.

[28:47] See if I can change an altar services around that would cut the time and have.

[28:51] Decrease the effort that they have to put in. Increase the likelihood that they think they're going to achieve it.

[28:55] And then right when they're about to make an decision, I say, oh, by the way, that's just this big.

[28:58] Let me tell you about all this other shit that we're going to do for you.

[29:00] They're like, holy crap. I'm definitely going to sign up. Oh, by the way.

[29:04] I only have two spots left that I have 16 more appointments this week.

[29:07] So what do you want to do? Right? And so then we have scarcity.

[29:10] All right. So there's three ways that I've seen how to do scarcity at the clip.

[29:14] All right. One is, if you actually have a limit to apply, that's awesome, right?

[29:18] One of the things you can do is you can have a limited supply of bonuses.

[29:21] So you have to say, I've a limit supply of the core thing.

[29:24] I can have a limit supply of the bonuses that I'm giving in.

[29:26] And I can reroute the bonuses in different ways.

[29:28] Re-skin them, put on a new, I do headline or whatever.

[29:31] To change, make the same thing different, which I'll show you as the seven step of this thing is reshitting them.

[29:35] So that I can pretty much always have limited bonuses that I can always provide.

[29:39] Scaresly with. Does that make sense? Yes. Okay.

[29:42] So there's the scarcity pieces. All right.

[29:45] Urgency. This one is probably the one I use more than scarcity to be candid with you.

[29:48] All right. Because I think it's easier to run on a regular basis.

[29:52] So just a quick side note. The difference between scarcity and urgency is scarcity is the function of unit units or quantity.

[29:58] Urgency is a function of time.

[30:00] People that I can't walk them in together, they're different.

[30:03] All right. So the first one, and this is probably the one that I use the most.

[30:07] All right. This cohort based urgency. So it's like, hey, we've got a new group of clients starting on Monday.

[30:12] I can't really miss out. We've got a bunch of awesome killers in that group.

[30:16] Right. It's it's Thursday, right? And they're like, oh, I don't want to miss that group.

[30:20] Like, yeah, you should do it. The guys are awesome. Just get started.

[30:22] It just gives you this little nudge. Now, when she signs up, if she says, no, I'm coming back on Monday.

[30:27] I'm like, you should just do the nask group. It's good that you miss this group because the next one's even better.

[30:31] And it starts on Monday. Right. And so you always have this rolling cohort that can happen, which you're probably already doing.

[30:37] You're just not selling it. The next kind of emergency is, is name-based urgency.

[30:41] So this is where you can re-skin the same offer. It's a, hey, this promotion, like you should end your promotions every month and just re-skin them and then start it.

[30:49] So you just have this fall surgency. It's not fall surgency. It's real urgency. But it's a, the new year thing ends in our,

[30:55] Brad's New Year's special for Closes School ends January 31st. Well, guess what?

[30:59] We've got Closes for Lovers opening in February, which then closes February 28th.

[31:04] And so it's the same program. It's just the promotion is different.

[31:08] And the promotion can still even be the same price once you just name it different. But that promotion is definitely up.

[31:13] You can have to be get around and use urgency as care she's your care.

[31:18] The promotion of pricing and the bonus itself is the re-exploding.

[31:23] This is, if there is a way right now, or anything in your marketplace is changing, it's shifted.

[31:36] This, this sounds like crazy. If you can get like a drill, for example, if I was saying, you know what it's not about new speed adds anymore.

[31:42] It's all about inbox leads, right? Because DMs on social media, you're getting correct to the decision makers.

[31:47] And the software that we have does it for $8.30 per cent a day and delivers 13 to 15 fresh leads in your inbox is anybody who responds back.

[31:55] Right? But the thing is a lot of people can get in on this soon. So you're going to want to sign it now so that you can get it just proportionate about the games.

[32:00] Right? So I'm just exploding on, reaching this arbitrage.

[32:03] So if you can think of ways that you had your own product and make it into an exploding opportunity, it'll create more urgency to take action.

[32:09] Number six, this is really cool. So most people either don't do guaranteed to use or just do one and they really lay more in guarantee, but most people don't do two.

[32:18] All right? So I'll show you how to this works. So I got this closed from Jason, flatland and it's one of my favorite closes of all time.

[32:26] And so when he's closing someone, if he has ever had a 30 day satisfaction guarantee, lover to leave it, whatever you want to say, say, hey, I'm not asking to say yes for another day.

[32:35] I'm just asking you to make an informed decision, which you can only do on the inside of the program, which basically gets them to delay the decision by buying. It's fucking awesome.

[32:43] And so if you ever have stuff like every single person, if you have a 30 day lover to leave a guarantee, you can basically get people to, you can make them feel safe.

[32:52] Get them to say no, hey, would you be opposed to moving forward and they know it wouldn't be opposed to moving forward today? Cool.

[32:57] Because I'm not asking to make it a decision right now. Just make it.

[32:59] I just want you to make your informed decision, which can only do once you start with us, right?

[33:03] And we can only make this kind of guarantee because we know we're so good at what we do, and we know people would say otherwise we wouldn't be a business, right?

[33:08] Right? Okay, cool. So let's get started. So back guarantee is fucking awesome.

[33:13] And so if you can't do an uneducational guarantee, I would highly highly recommend it. Here's what's cool.

[33:17] You can have a unconditional guarantee that's based on one timeline, and then you can have a conditional guarantee that's based on another timeline.

[33:24] So it's like not only that, and this is the one that you make crazy, right? So this is what you say, hey, not only that.

[33:31] If you don't make 10 grand using my software in the first 30 day, in the first 60 days, I'll give you 10 grand.

[33:37] Because that's how I know how good it is. But you got to show up to everyone of the colors that we have.

[33:42] You got to make sure all your payments are on time. You've got to XYZ, the things that are your activation points for your service or product.

[33:49] The things that you don't will make someone actually successful, and then you just bake those right into your conditional guarantee.

[33:55] And so they're like, wait, so if I love it to leave it, and you're telling me that 68 days from now, like if I don't achieve this crazy result, if I do these three things, then,

[34:04] that's all you need me to do to buy, and there's only two spots left.

[34:07] And so when we stack these things, you can massively increase the closing percentages for the team and bake the offer more compelling from a marketing perspective.

[34:15] Last one. Okay, Magic naming formula. So how to name, how to use the same offer and rename it, rescan it over or over again?

[34:21] This is especially important if you're in local markets. So I'll give you an interesting one.

[34:28] So let's see, you've got this big bundle. I'll talk you about the free six we've challenged. Let's say that that's our original bundle. It's fitness, nutrition, stuff.

[34:37] Right? Then we call it the fall six week challenge.

[34:43] We call it our spring 28 day blueprint. Then we call it our Halloween 42 day detox.

[34:50] Same exact that. It just keeps it fresh. And so that way we don't have to change the operational structure of the business, but we can constantly keep the marketing fresh.

[34:58] Okay. And that's the magic stands for. So it's the magnet, which is make a magnetic reason, which is why I like having a reason of why it's so it's like it's fall and spring, it's whatever.

[35:10] It's, you know, my kid lost a tooth. It's our fifth year anniversary, right? Which is a great one. We just started running fifth year anniversary at that's why I'm running this offer. If you look, that's why he's running the offer.

[35:19] I ran the offer last month too, but now it's our fifth year anniversary, right? And the thing is, is you can be like, it's my wife's birthday, it's my birthday, it's my company's birthday. It's like three times a year you already got birthday so you can give reasons why for it.

[35:29] Right? Like you can only, I always used to tell people think like a fraternity party player. Just like you need this much to create it to have a party. It's like,

[35:36] it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it

[36:06] takes start, you know, sprints, accelerator, whatever, right? The point is that we put these things together. Now you don't have to have all of them, but if you just have these on the back of your mind, you'll always be able to spin headlines very quickly in the name products and offerings that will convert.

[36:20] Those are the seven things that I look at when I'm trying to adjust the businesses off, can make the marketing more compelling and get more clicks.

[36:26] Check number two.

[36:28] Whoo!

[36:29] You guys with me so far? We're still good?

[36:31] Yeah.

[36:32] All right, so I'm about to show you one of the sexy things that I have.

[36:34] All right, so I can guarantee everyone here that you will get more customers from the thing I'm going to show you.

[36:38] So, yes, I guess.

[36:39] A couple of people move around in their chairs.

[36:41] Fantastic. This is our pond.

[36:43] If you have our little, a little wormy guy, now we've got to put it in the pond. So you've got to find our pond.

[36:48] Never go hungry again. This is actually the photo shop.

[36:51] The CEO is like, this is my never-hark, go hungry again.

[36:54] Framework. So he has this posted behind his computer.

[36:57] So he knows that there's always ways to get more customers.

[36:59] You can take a picture of this because this is like my holy grail.

[37:02] If I ever need more business, this is where I go.

[37:05] All right, so you've got paid media.

[37:07] You have earned media, you have money media, you have the hotbound, you have feelings of partners and your referrals.

[37:10] And I'll show you the ways that we use each of these.

[37:14] I've done, I've done 20 million out of every single of these boxes except for earns media.

[37:21] So that's actually the one that, and I've just starting doing that now.

[37:25] But the other five, or whatever, I made over 20 million from each.

[37:29] So I'll tell you the, like, I'll tell you what we do right now that's working.

[37:32] And so yeah, I'm going to show you a lot of shit here.

[37:35] You're probably not going to, like, just pick one or two that you actually will do.

[37:39] And like, if you do that, then you can go to the next one.

[37:41] Like, give yourself permission to do the next one if you just do one of them.

[37:43] Okay, so pay media.

[37:44] And I've got one for you in this one.

[37:46] Okay, so remember we have our little equation.

[37:48] We've got to make one the first 30 days and it costs two five to customers and facility customers.

[37:52] All right, so if you, if you don't have an action, this is the action for you.

[37:56] Just spend 100 bucks a day on those lead ads that I'll sell you.

[37:58] All right, if you do this, give yourself a slush fund.

[38:02] There we go. Give yourself a slush fund.

[38:04] One of the, one of the early marketing mentors that I had told me,

[38:08] is that if buying all these courses and coachings and whatever, just say whatever amount of money you're willing to

[38:13] below every month on advertising.

[38:15] And then always spend it.

[38:17] And that way, you know, force you to do it.

[38:20] And the thing is, is you want to have your ego tied up in your onion.

[38:22] You're like, fuck, I suck.

[38:23] It's like, why, I'm supposed to suck.

[38:24] I don't know what I'm doing, but you will figure it out in the promise you.

[38:27] If you actually just spend, and I just recommend people start at 100 bucks a day,

[38:30] and you'll start to see some traction.

[38:32] You'll watch the more YouTube videos, and you'll learn a lot faster than all the many, many, many things that you better out there.

[38:38] Okay, cool.

[38:39] So these are the examples of paid media, YouTube Facebook, Instagram, influence your shout outs.

[38:43] It's actually underrated podcast, GDN, podcast, meaning you can get the,

[38:48] you can pay the person to basically say commercial like radio.

[38:51] GDN and search radio, rated search is a hack that I'll show you in a second.

[38:55] That just better from here is losing money.

[38:58] It'll give you like your highest return to advertising.

[39:00] So this is our advanced lead generation.

[39:03] Got a little magnitude, you guys.

[39:04] A little promotion.

[39:05] Then what we do is we give some offer to liquidator acquisition costs.

[39:08] Our upper on cash offer.

[39:09] That's how we get all that money back.

[39:11] We have two ups, we have ups all down.

[39:13] So this is literally every single offer that I've home run has been.

[39:16] Every single one of them is look just like this.

[39:18] And then we feed it in a condo day.

[39:19] One, two, three, four.

[39:20] That's what we do.

[39:21] Over and over and over again.

[39:22] So I'm going to give you one cool, this probably the,

[39:24] this is the thing that I've most excited about.

[39:27] This is not what I love more than anything.

[39:28] I literally wrote a book just on this one topic.

[39:30] So these are free cash offers.

[39:32] So you're like, how do I make money if I'm giving something away for free?

[39:34] Excellent question, right?

[39:35] There we go.

[39:36] Libby, this is an example.

[39:38] Libby free is someone comes in for XY service that you should always know more about your service than they do.

[39:44] And give, I don't want to say incomplete solution.

[39:47] But give a solution that's not going to, I'll give you an example example.

[39:51] If someone were getting a car wash, it would be like the lowest bare minimum of the cars not even looking that much better.

[39:57] Well, it'd better, but not that much better.

[39:59] Right? Or if someone is coming into work out of the gym or rather if someone's coming into lose weight, right?

[40:04] I'll say you can have access to our group and we'll give you homework hours.

[40:06] While they're out of the gym.

[40:07] And they're like, but like, or you can do our super sexy guaranteed results, double guaranteed has all these bonuses.

[40:14] And it's only this for you right now to start some money you should definitely get into it.

[40:18] We're guaranteed you lose 10 pounds in the first 30 days.

[40:20] If you don't, we'll keep working for you another 30 days.

[40:23] Right now? Right?

[40:25] And so that is someone someone comes in for something free.

[40:27] We give them an inferior offer and then we upsell the primary offer.

[40:31] Right? That's what we call limited free.

[40:34] By the way, you also don't even have to mention the inferior offer because you have to tell them to remember more than half the time.

[40:40] Second one, free with the positive. That was the thing that I mentioned earlier.

[40:43] If you never have any kind of service that requires effort, we'll be half of the cost where you get a result.

[40:48] Anything that's a lot of services. Right?

[40:50] You can mark it something for free and have them like if you didn't therapy, you didn't like coaching.

[40:55] You did anything that is some sort of like the client has to do something.

[40:58] You have to pay for the program.

[41:00] And then if they get the outcome, or if they do the habits, they can get the program free or rebate the credit back to them.

[41:07] Right? Towards future services.

[41:09] So my sense? It's pretty cool. This one fucking kills.

[41:12] This one is awesome.

[41:15] This one is awesome.

[41:16] It's more money than any offer on this board.

[41:18] Because what it does is it aligns the customer with their result.

[41:21] When they don't have the use of money as a accountability, so your client's success goes through the roof.

[41:25] And it's like, well, marginally, if you lose 22 pounds in your first six weeks working with me,

[41:31] Are you going to keep, you're going to want to come to me for the next four weeks?

[41:33] She's like, well, that's why we do the promotion.

[41:36] So I'm not worried about giving you six weeks free if I get six years through me.

[41:39] Right? But if you follow the money, when I said earlier, she got six weeks free.

[41:43] Because we took the money and we credited it against her future rate, which you probably put up a little bit,

[41:48] And then discounted it off the money that you got.

[41:50] So make sense? Area three. Okay, giveaways.

[41:53] Good ways are awesome. The way you do giveaways properly.

[41:55] Have a first place prize in a second place prize.

[41:57] The first place prize is your core offer. It's your biggest sexiest, most expensive package.

[42:02] You do that because everyone knows the price.

[42:05] And you market and you're going to give that one away from free.

[42:08] And the second place prize is an acceptable discount and absolute value.

[42:12] So for example, if I was giving away, God, what services?

[42:16] I don't know, a year of window washing. Whatever.

[42:18] Right? And it's the ulcer of platinum window washing experience.

[42:22] Whatever. Underneath of that, let's say that I was a $4,000 deal.

[42:26] Underneath of that, I would say, second place prize gets $600 of window washes.

[42:32] Right? You run the promotion. You wait four days.

[42:36] Give them the count of when the person's going to get cold.

[42:40] Then you announce the winner. Pick one person. Everyone else. Congratulations.

[42:44] You won second prize. Right? You can put in the thing more than one winner may have bought.

[42:48] Completely compliant. Right? If I do it that, you give every single person a $600 off.

[42:54] You're $4,000 package.

[42:56] Me? This works really well. Why you leave? This works.

[43:02] Okay. Free with free pay. This is also one of my favorites.

[43:06] If anybody here has recurring services or bundled services,

[43:10] if you're trying to get up front cash, this guy,

[43:14] then you can sell like buy three get free and you can double the price for the thing.

[43:20] So you're still selling six months up front, basically.

[43:22] But it's buy three get free. The buy six gets six. Whatever.

[43:26] And that can go with products or you can go with time.

[43:28] It's really matter. When you do this, though, you get so much cash for up front.

[43:32] You can pretty much help market all your competition.

[43:36] It's very cool. And turn on pre-paid people is one fifth of month-to-month people.

[43:42] That's why I. It's winter free.

[43:44] So if you have a type of service or a work that has to be done in the same thing that has to be done multiple times.

[43:50] So an example would be a car tractor or a massage there for somebody who does the same service over and over again.

[43:56] What the best things to do is just do a splinter free offer which means you pull one of them off.

[44:00] Ideally, you want to pull one of them off and what like tanning is a really good example.

[44:04] You're selling it. Like if I said, I'm going to give you five day free VIP tanning experience.

[44:10] First thing I'm saying, the shipper excited, we say, hey, how tend you want to get?

[44:14] I'm going to show you this book of tan.

[44:16] The chocolate one. Okay. Well, you look like vanilla.

[44:18] So it's going to take us a lot more than five days to get there.

[44:22] So you want to get there? Cool. Then why don't we just sign up for a membership?

[44:26] Right? Because you can't tan five days in a row. You can't once and five days because otherwise you're burdened.

[44:32] Because we know more about our service that our customer does.

[44:34] So there's a lot of things that your customer wants, but they don't know how to get there.

[44:38] We can make promotions that in their minds, like, oh, it's like five day weight loss.

[44:42] It's like, no one will lose the right.

[44:44] But in their minds, you can then educate them so they're better consumers and then make a better

[44:48] More informed by decision. Once Kimberly understands that she's vanilla, she wants to get to chocolate and

[44:53] take more than five days. We already hear and you like me because it's why I'm going to be a nice.

[44:57] She'll sign up. Right? And so this offer works very, very well.

[45:01] You break off one piece, same thing like laser hair removal. You can't do one session laser hair removal.

[45:05] You need all six. Right? There's lots of things like that. You can break off one or two.

[45:09] And they can't really do that without the other ones.

[45:11] And so you give the two for free because you know, it'll, it'll bring them in.

[45:15] And this one, this is one of my favorites. So for this event, for example, if I were to do invisible free,

[45:20] would invisible free offer is, as I say, hey, you can come to this event absolutely free.

[45:25] But you're pretty credit carded. At the end of the event, if you don't think it was worth five grand,

[45:30] you just let me know after the first day. And I'll send you, you know, like we won't fill your car.

[45:36] But the upsell say you're selling right there is, or you can pay right now for three grand and get all the recordings.

[45:44] And, and so you have this thing that's marketed for free, the downsell is they sign up for something more expensive.

[45:51] Right? The downsell is they sign up for something more expensive that gives them less.

[45:55] Right? And then you say, if you don't think it's worth x, y, and z, then we won't fill it.

[46:00] But the requirements and that is you have to shut this works with like webinars too, same thing.

[46:04] If you're worried about people showing up, this also a great way to get people to show up.

[46:07] Right? If you're ever doing like a pitching thing too, now they have their credit carded.

[46:11] Like there's different strategies to use this one for. Like if you want to everyone to pinch you could downsell everyone

[46:15] to just stand and offload it. So you make the prices closer. If you want more people to pay today,

[46:19] make the price to try to see bigger ad more bonuses. So if it's like 250 and 200, well then, oh wait, I'll wait for 250 to 200.

[46:28] And then I get everyone to show up because the only way they can not get filled is by showing up.

[46:32] And then you have everyone's cats with attention, you can pitch your eyes off.

[46:35] All right, this is for bread.

[46:38] So this is the easiest hack that everyone in the entire world can do. They probably aren't doing.

[46:42] Own your damn terms. So this is literally on the plane today. Light speed, LMS.

[46:47] Everybody else is paying for your terms. All these guys are, they're marketing guys are doing it.

[46:52] And you're here. Right? And so it's like I got to see another one of these guys before I see yours.

[46:57] And then everybody's got an answer, right? You're not even coming up, right?

[47:02] And so it's just like if you just own your brain at terms, the return on on ad spend for bread at terms is stupid.

[47:08] It's like 20 to 40 to one. It's crazy. And it's so easy to set up. Google how to set up branded search terms, 10 minutes.

[47:15] And then you can put all these in and guarantee you like all you do is you send them to a landing pitch.

[47:19] It just does email opt-in phone up. Like simple because they're already looking for you.

[47:23] They're just the lowest low toss leads out there, which is make sure that they're seen.

[47:27] So it's branded search. You're just literally owning your own keywords.

[47:31] You say I want to advertise for Bradley, Lightspeed, Lightspeed, LMS, Lightspeed, training, Lightspeed, like all the variations of that.

[47:39] Someone might be searching. Pay me the number one you like on the phone. Don't worry. The others are faster.

[47:44] Okay. I'll just give you a quick strategy for this. Most of you guys have listing contacts.

[47:49] All right. So my recommendation from a strategies perspective is to do a quarterly push. I'll just move a little faster for you.

[47:55] So when you're doing content, like you kill it with content. Right?

[48:00] The strategy that we see that works is just let them know what you do.

[48:04] Not a pitch. Just let hey, spread lee from Lightspeed and this is what we do.

[48:08] And if you're one of those guys awesome, then we have all the value you give. And by the way, if one of those people that has this problem that we saw,

[48:14] that's why you see it. Right? So you don't lose anything from those people when you do that on regular basis.

[48:19] And then this is what most people are missing.

[48:22] Which is a quarterly push. All right. So that means once a quarter you will afford a blitz on your list.

[48:28] And that's where you promote like fucking crazy for four days and they shut it with real scare to you on an offer.

[48:33] And that week you can squeeze your list every quarter. And most people aren't doing this.

[48:38] So if I'm going to go buy a business or buy a piece of a business, I'm looking to do this checklist that I'm going through right now.

[48:42] The offer, the company's acquisition for the man.

[48:45] And then what traffic sources are using and I'm just checking boxes.

[48:48] And like, right, this service was good in.

[48:50] Let's do this and I just plug in these holes and just like that, and be at the triple their acquisition.

[48:54] Right? This is a checklist.

[48:56] All right. Next one.

[48:57] Oh, which media? This is actually very similar. Same concept.

[49:00] This is from you work.

[49:02] Followers where you're promoting it and saying in your podcast, here you're saying it's here list that you are.

[49:06] Everything else is more or less to say.

[49:08] All right. The difference here is that this is email list, message, or list SMS list,

[49:12] blog audience, contact in your phone depending on the depending on how many contacts you've been phone.

[49:16] This is a really good one right now.

[49:18] This is, D&Jax is 9.4 email. Still one of the best emails like Everetton, it's called the 9.4 email,

[49:23] because it has my words in it.

[49:25] And it says, do you still need help getting that problem solved?

[49:28] That's it.

[49:30] Email your list that, I guarantee you will get people who are spot-banks and yes, I do actually still need help solve it.

[49:34] I probably need to solve it.

[49:36] Nothing else. Don't get, like, don't say by the way, the 9 words.

[49:39] Do you are still struggling with? Are you still struggling with issue?

[49:42] All right. How about?

[49:46] Just FYI, I mean, I know you guys are more on the sales, sales world,

[49:50] but we get ridiculous ROI on outbound, so we have a 20% outbound team.

[49:55] My hack here is to use multiple forms, and then the software does that too,

[50:00] but you get way better conversions if you contact on multiple channels.

[50:03] All right. From a strategy perspective, really quick.

[50:06] If you're starting out on this channel, I just tell everyone 100 reach out today.

[50:12] 100 a day, guaranteed, you will make more money.

[50:15] And I give people 6 months.

[50:17] I give it 6 months, like it's no boss.

[50:19] But I have to get to have somebody not kill it within 6 months if they do that.

[50:23] So that's this simple strategy, and it works very, very well.

[50:26] These still work, because I feel like people have forgotten this.

[50:29] I don't know why. At least in the marketing world, I've once forgotten about it.

[50:32] So it's like blue ocean for us.

[50:34] The first thing to do is to call your own leads, right?

[50:37] Things are obvious, but sometimes people have so many leads.

[50:39] I talk to a lot of marketers who've never talked to their leads.

[50:42] So first thing to do with being called your own leads.

[50:45] Next, I spent $50,000 in coaching and programs and stuff to learn outbound.

[50:51] Didn't use any of it. I think the best thing is to just start, because there's enough.

[50:56] And they want this to every niche. It's worth just, like, you'll figure it out.

[50:59] And that's what we ended up doing anyways, really.

[51:02] And then, yeah, give it 6 months.

[51:04] And then we put 10 to 20% of our, I said marketing budget, but that's certainly,

[51:08] I've certainly spent on advertising. We've been 10 to 20% of that towards outbound.

[51:12] Not expecting an ROI for the first few months.

[51:16] And it took like a quarter, basically. It took like a quarter to ROI.

[51:19] But now it's about 20 to 1 for us.

[51:21] In terms of the return. Just really good.

[51:23] Okay. All right. The full of supporters.

[51:25] All right. So if I said the ones that I've made, the most money from.

[51:29] One, two. Lots of lots of them.

[51:34] So one of the things that our goal here for this is to get it is to be a full integration.

[51:39] So a lot of people do like, hey, talk it by thing or do a webinar with me or do a podcast with me.

[51:44] And that stuff's great. But I mean, it's like, you'll see a little clip.

[51:48] But I want full integration. And so what I try to figure out is who has problems that I can solve.

[51:54] So for example, if I were going after personal trainers, I would go after a software that cater to personal trainers.

[51:59] I would find out that the biggest problem that those people have is that the trainers need their first five clients for the software.

[52:03] For them to stick. If people don't use CRMs, they don't have C's customers.

[52:07] Right? Can use the CRMs. We'll be on customers.

[52:09] And so I could say, hey, this is our software guy. You've got 14,000 personal trainers.

[52:12] And I want to sell stuff for personal trainers. I know how to get them clients.

[52:16] Why don't you send them to me? And I'll solve your biggest problem of activation.

[52:20] And so the idea is, I want to get into their onboarding process.

[52:24] The reason press to use labs, which is our self-in-competitive, which is more revenue than mine.

[52:28] Jim company does. It's because we use the distribution base and integrate it to the self-in-cell.

[52:32] And so when someone can really comes in, she buys services.

[52:36] Before the $48 later we're doing a nutrition consultation for selling them supplements.

[52:40] And so that all of the marketing spend that all my partners are spending, it flows through big.

[52:45] And they're happy to do it because they get paid handsomely. And I'm happy to do it because I don't have to pay for acquisition.

[52:50] Now there's two ways that you can use a strategy that I like.

[52:53] One of them is what I've just said where you can't agree. We're at their new and promoting and selling your stuff.

[52:58] The other way is where you're doing the promoting and selling their stuff.

[53:02] Where you actually become the affiliate. And if you're not sending too much money away, a lot of times this amount less work,

[53:09] it's just being a failure. You get 50% of top-line revenue that you're sending over someone for another work.

[53:14] Most businesses don't run with 50% margins. So if you can get 50% of top-line and do none of the fulfillment,

[53:19] and you're paying for the traffic anyways, why not?

[53:22] And then if that person think you're a friend of the business over, also has that list, you can say,

[53:27] you know what, all referral those people over just since of people back.

[53:31] Right? And that may sound silly, but if you do it on a regular basis, people will do it, but you have to do it first.

[53:36] You have to sell their thing first and then they will return.

[53:39] All right. So, generally, see if, for prestige, labs you have 4,000 affiliates that are brick and water,

[53:46] mom and pop shops that sell their products. Alan is a software that we use. We have 200 or 400 agencies that white label our product and then sell it on our behalf.

[53:56] And they make tons of money doing it. We just make a little piece and all of it.

[54:00] Right? And so, how can I find ways to make other people money and then integrate?

[54:04] So, these are the quick strategies and then we'll get to the six ways to make one money on customers.

[54:10] Okay. So this is a different example I'll share with you.

[54:13] So, I was working with a company recently that hired some simple consulting stuff, and they catered to physical therapists.

[54:20] And so, they were like, how can we do this partner integration? And I was like, well, we do all PT sell to every client that who uses physical therapists as a distribution mechanism to get to customers.

[54:32] He would be to see. They were like, well, orthotics, braces, recovery bands, all that stuff. Like, right.

[54:38] Reach out to those companies and say, hey, give me 10 of your guys. I'll teach them how to sell your product.

[54:46] And exchange for you just sending more of your guys for me to teach them how to sell your product.

[54:50] I'll also sell them my product. But I'm selling more of your shit for you. People will feed you like tons.

[54:56] If you can sell this product for them. So, like, if you can, because most of you guys are here to have a sell.

[55:00] So, a lot of people don't know their clients, they have people who don't sell their products.

[55:04] You can take their customers to teach them how to sell their own product better.

[55:08] And then they will feed people to you because you're solving their problem.

[55:12] We kill it with this. And primary action for anyone here who's in action, take your,

[55:18] if you do 100 reach out today, or just identify the 10 biggest partners.

[55:22] And then spend real money together. Like, real money. You know what I mean?

[55:26] Send them to EV. Send them a watch. Send them something to the candy door or something to their office.

[55:30] And she'll be like, can I please, I've got bags of money. I want to throw you. Please, please let me just give that money to you because it's a burning hole in my wallet.

[55:36] Right? And usually people would take that meeting.

[55:39] Also, if you said, if you said letters, would they get $1,000 a day cash, people tend to return the calls.

[55:44] To do. Okay. I feel this is a bargain. Last one. For us, and then we'll get to LTV.

[55:49] So, this is the golden ratio. 30% of our customers still come from referrals.

[55:53] Our goal is to companies to get the percentage of customers who refer to be great, that percentage of customers who leave.

[55:58] If you can achieve this, you have limitless growth. It's just like the client-funded acquisition of customer success.

[56:04] If we can get a higher percentage of customers to send us someone, then to leave, our business will grow with nothing else.

[56:11] And so that is our golden ratio. So that's the goal with referrals.

[56:14] So here are some examples of stuff that we do for incentives. I'm going to give you a really sexy one right now.

[56:19] So obviously, this is the kept, there's the cash one. The unlockable bonus is something that's really nifty.

[56:25] And so if you have a VIP service or some sort of thing that's of value, like those bonuses I was talking about,

[56:32] something that's really sizzle. It could be a software feature. It could be a training.

[56:39] It could be anything that you can think of. But especially if it's something that gets status, then you say,

[56:45] Hey, they're like, what are those kinds of fancy bands? Those are just for people who send us other clients.

[56:51] You don't hate their friends. You hate your friends because you haven't sent us anyone.

[56:54] I don't know why. You hate your friends so much.

[56:57] But so when you do that, it's like a classy way of paying someone without having to pay a cash.

[57:02] Take it to events. All of the sets of things we're really want for referrals.

[57:06] All right, do you know anybody who's looking to achieve acts? That's probably one of the best outbound openers, by the way,

[57:13] because then you don't feel like you're spamming someone.

[57:15] And they're like, you know what fuck my sister? I'm the one who needs to lose weight, right? And then they tell you.

[57:20] Okay. Cash bonuses integrated. Yeah.

[57:23] And then I would make sure that you have this integrated in the onboarding process. I know some of this stuff, some of you guys may have heard of, but you might still not do that.

[57:30] Every company that I like I work with. Like, yeah, right, ask for referrals. I'm like, are you?

[57:36] Like, we've been meeting too. Like, why? Where is in the process?

[57:40] Right? Just show me where it is in the process and then we make sure it happens every time.

[57:43] And then one of the biggest pieces here this the last one will say about our referrals is from human psychology as,

[57:51] if I take bread to the airport, right? And I do throw out a favor. Immediately after the favor happens,

[57:57] is when Brad feels the most positively towards me, and I actually feel the dure of the favor, like it wasn't happening with deal.

[58:04] Six months later, when we look back on that situation, I feel like I did bread a huge favor, and Brad's like, there's nothing to be the airport.

[58:11] And so that is why people have these weird relationships with businesses sometimes when they leave, because whatever you do for me lately,

[58:17] really sitting in the thing is the person who's the dure disproportionately feels like they did more than they actually did.

[58:22] So you get two different cognitive biases working against each other. And so, when you're doing testimonials or referrals,

[58:28] the moment you have the activation point, that first positive magical moment that you probably have choreographed in your customer onboarding experience,

[58:35] that's when you ask, does everyone know where like their big magical moment, their activation point of like, if someone does this, then they stay 10 months longer or whatever.

[58:42] Does everyone know that is? If you don't take your longest customers, look at what they did in their beginning, and they try and model that.

[58:48] Oh, it's a few more. Does everyone feel like there's a lot of different ways we can get customers now? Six different goals.

[58:54] Did they want to have at least one of these that you're not doing, but you can immediately just pull cash out of? Okay, good.

[59:00] Most businesses would do very well if they just started up by picking the biggest pile of money in front of them.

[59:06] Most of us have these big bags of money that are sitting in front of us, that we just don't pick up.

[59:10] And so what I end up doing for these companies, I just start with this big pile of money. Just take 10 minutes on YouTube and get creative terms up within by it's five o'clock today because you fix that long, right?

[59:22] And then you have leaflet. I've never had less than 20 to 40 percent increase in number of customers from just doing one of these things.

[59:29] I mean, that should cover a lot of guys' grunts for this year.

[59:32] So we got the math to how to car customers in a profit.

[59:36] They offer on how to get complete strangers to say yes because if you stupid if they say no because all the things you made,

[59:41] we're in a dangling that little double-garing team, super-sigre of double bonus, six week whatever in front of the, in front of their name.

[59:48] And then finally, how you become a beautiful.

[59:51] All right, so this is where the numbers and metrics become really cool.

[59:54] This is probably the part that I spent the most time on, not because it's long because it's sexy.

[59:58] So how do you become a beautiful? Make so much money for customers that you can use any channel you download please.

[60:02] Does anyone feel like it costs too much to our customers?

[60:05] One person, anyone else? Feel like it costs too much to our customers, two people, anyone else? Three people, four people, five people.

[60:11] Okay, guys, people, this is for you guys. Everyone else's a chill.

[60:13] The thing is is that high balls are never going to get cheaper than they are today.

[60:16] Think of one. They were literally never be cheaper than they are right now.

[60:19] And so if you feel like their expensive now, then what is it going to be in five years?

[60:23] More expensive. You can guarantee that.

[60:26] Everything I have on the fact that basically we have more expensive figures from them.

[60:30] And so this is the only lever that you can pull to be unbeatable so that you can spend everyone.

[60:35] That way you can use all of these channels because if you have a million dollars a deal, you can use direct mail and still work.

[60:40] You use radio, nationally and still work because you make so much more for customers.

[60:44] And so as much as this is in acquisition thing, the back end informs the front end.

[60:49] Sometimes when I choose to go backwards.

[60:51] So let's play a quick money game. They're really like money games?

[60:54] Yeah. All right. So this is the business, Jeannie exercise.

[60:58] This is our sample business. We get 30 new clients a month. One client a day.

[61:03] The average client stays with us for three months.

[61:05] The price per month is $100. We currently have $100.

[61:08] We're going to point a big library.

[61:10] That means that we're not going to grow at this rate. We're not going to shrink at the rate.

[61:13] We're going to stay even.

[61:14] We have 20% margins. We're doing $10,000 a month.

[61:17] Which means we're taking home $2,000 a month.

[61:20] That's right. This is our business.

[61:22] And this business, Jeannie, is beautiful. I kind of a business, Jeannie.

[61:26] Business, Jeannie, if you will.

[61:27] Shows up. It says, I can double one aspect of your business.

[61:31] Which one would you like it to be?

[61:33] It's very nice to meet you.

[61:35] Let's just go.

[61:36] All right.

[61:37] Option number one.

[61:38] I can double the number of new clients that you sign up every month.

[61:42] Option number one.

[61:44] Option number two. I can double the price of your partner services.

[61:48] Everything else says to say, you know, all these are beautiful.

[61:51] Trace number three.

[61:52] I can double the number of purchases per customer.

[61:56] Which do you choose?

[61:58] Going at one.

[61:59] To business. To business.

[62:01] All right.

[62:02] So do me a favor.

[62:03] All right. I'll do raise hands on choice number one.

[62:06] Trace number one.

[62:07] This one. Double number of clients.

[62:09] Okay.

[62:10] Choice number two. Double price of product and services.

[62:13] Okay.

[62:14] Number three.

[62:15] Double the amount of purchases everyone makes.

[62:17] All right.

[62:18] So we have a really even split, which is perfect.

[62:20] All right.

[62:21] Somebody walk through some cool shit with you.

[62:23] So if I double the amount of clients that I have, right, then I'm coming in.

[62:28] Then I'm going to go from 30 to 60.

[62:31] The math behind that means that I'm going to go if the business will double eventually.

[62:35] Right. Because the church stays the same.

[62:36] It's going to double and it's going to get the 200 clients at 100 dollars a month.

[62:39] So I'll make 20 grand.

[62:41] 20% margins is four grand.

[62:42] So I double the amount of profit.

[62:44] Did everyone follow me with that?

[62:46] Yes.

[62:47] Cool.

[62:48] So number three.

[62:49] By double the amount of purchases per customer.

[62:52] It works out to the same thing because each customer becomes, they buy twice, essentially,

[62:57] because they're buying two different things from us.

[62:59] Right.

[63:00] So we're an easier way to say this than we're occurring business.

[63:02] If you're doubling the lifespan of the customer, they're buying twice as many times.

[63:05] They go from three months to six months.

[63:06] By the way, we've been cutting it in half.

[63:07] This is a different way of saying it.

[63:09] Right.

[63:10] And so by doing this, this has a slight advantage over number one.

[63:14] So does anyone know what it is?

[63:16] You don't have much.

[63:17] I'll tell you what it is.

[63:18] The advantage of this one is that your LTV per customer is twice as high.

[63:24] So now I can spend more on the acquisition.

[63:27] Right.

[63:28] And so the point here is I'm making twice as much profit per customer.

[63:31] I'm making twice as much profit in each of these scenarios from a business standpoint.

[63:35] I'm making the same amount of profit that this is a better business.

[63:39] Because I'll be able to grow this more easily.

[63:41] Now, for this example, I'm keeping all their variables the same.

[63:44] But my marketing cost would be half on this one.

[63:46] Because I can acquire the same amount of customers to get them to stay twice as long.

[63:49] Does that make sense?

[63:50] Yeah.

[63:51] Okay.

[63:52] You double your price.

[63:54] You make six times the profit.

[63:55] So let me walk you through this.

[63:58] If you're at $100 a month, and your cost of a filling was 80.

[64:02] That's the 20% margin.

[64:04] We double that.

[64:05] You go to $200.

[64:06] And we're still at 80 to fulfill.

[64:08] So we now have 20 and the 100 in profit.

[64:12] So now we have six times the amount of profit as we did before.

[64:17] And no one's fucking pay the attention to their prices.

[64:20] Pricing's everything.

[64:22] It's the number one lever on how much money you make.

[64:24] So, is that cool?

[64:27] This is what we're going to talk about.

[64:29] This is my only one favorite subject.

[64:31] So that is how important the six levers that I'm going to share with you are.

[64:37] So when I said make them worth more.

[64:39] It's an increase in lifetime gross profit.

[64:42] Now people have heard everyone here at the turn of life's lives.

[64:45] I value it.

[64:46] It's defined a million different ways.

[64:48] Do you live in Google?

[64:49] You'll see six different definitions of it.

[64:51] So I will define this for you.

[64:53] Lifetime gross profit.

[64:55] The purple is the juice.

[64:57] All right.

[64:58] That is what we, that is the squeeze.

[64:59] That is what we get at the end.

[65:01] All right. That's the chop.

[65:02] That's the gross profit.

[65:03] That's not the chop.

[65:04] That's that would be enough profit.

[65:05] The gross profit is the cost of the film is cost of good sold.

[65:09] And then what is left over to that pay all the other should we have.

[65:12] We're at the other side.

[65:13] But it comes out of that's right.

[65:14] Gross profit is 50.

[65:15] This isn't a good business by the way.

[65:17] This is just an example because it's simple.

[65:19] All right.

[65:20] So I'm going to use this as kind of the case steady for all these animals.

[65:23] I'm going to give you.

[65:24] I'm going to show you every lever that I pull in a business to make way more money for

[65:28] costs.

[65:29] All right.

[65:30] So in this business, the lifetime revenue.

[65:35] This $500.

[65:37] Lifetime gross profit is 250.

[65:39] Everyone's with me.

[65:40] All right.

[65:41] So if you don't know how to calculate this in your own business,

[65:44] everyone know what their number is in their business.

[65:46] Lifetime gross profit per customer.

[65:48] For everyone who didn't say yes, here's how you do it.

[65:51] This is the simple way and then I'll show you what if you have a recurring base business.

[65:55] This is the simplest back of napkin way of doing it.

[65:58] Take the total revenue that you've collected since you started business.

[66:02] Let me just add up the bank statements.

[66:04] Times your gross margin we should already hopefully know what your margin is on the services you deliver.

[66:10] Just like if you do services for example, I pay extra hour.

[66:13] It takes a while to get the result.

[66:15] Why hours compared to the prices 20% of the price.

[66:18] So I'm excited by personal trading and it was $20.

[66:21] And I saw it for $100.

[66:22] I'd have an 80% gross margin.

[66:24] Is that fast?

[66:26] Okay.

[66:27] Thank you.

[66:28] So I've got the total money.

[66:30] The total money times the margin.

[66:32] And then I just divided by the total number of customers I've ever signed up.

[66:36] This will underestimate it, but I'd always rather round down and then make more money.

[66:41] But this will be the closest estimation because if you're like, well, we're better now than we were before.

[66:45] Cool.

[66:46] That's okay.

[66:47] You can always make more money.

[66:48] But it's better to underestimate these numbers.

[66:50] This is better if you have just selling products.

[66:53] We're like one-time purchases.

[66:55] If you have a recurring business or a business where people will buy more often,

[66:59] then this is the way you do it.

[67:01] Same top line.

[67:02] The only thing is different is that you divide the bottom by total number of

[67:06] churned out customers.

[67:08] So like if 900 of my 1000 customers are churned, then it's going to be divided by 0.9.

[67:14] Which basically makes my LTV go up because 10% of my customers are still going to keep paying me.

[67:19] Does that make sense?

[67:20] I know that was kind of complicated.

[67:21] But does that kind of make sense?

[67:23] It's like a kind of, I just go with it.

[67:25] Sorry.

[67:26] All right.

[67:27] This is probably my favorite quote of my own.

[67:31] The business is under that can make his clients more valuable to his business than his competition wins.

[67:35] All right.

[67:36] I even miscoited myself with that's the end.

[67:38] All right.

[67:39] So the idea is now, like, I'm not trying to out spend everyone.

[67:42] I'm trying to make this human being more valuable to me than anyone else.

[67:46] So that means that I'll be able to acquire him better than anyone else.

[67:49] And so the more I can spend an acquisition, the more channels will be opened up to me.

[67:53] And then the more depth of the channel like I reached like,

[67:55] if I get priced out of Facebook, what's like, what's I go past 300,000 in my audience because it's too expensive to reach the next part?

[68:00] Then I get priced out.

[68:02] Right. So like, it's been more than I can keep going deeper and deeper into each of the channels that I have.

[68:06] On top of that, I can also get more depth in the actual market like market penetration because I can still outspend my competition.

[68:12] All right.

[68:13] So if you can only spend a dollar to a car customer, you'll probably never be in business.

[68:18] And so, but no one looks at this and they're like, my marketing is a work.

[68:20] It's probably because your business doesn't work.

[68:22] Right.

[68:23] And that's the issue.

[68:24] Okay. Like even Facebook, which is free, makes $40 a year on everyone.

[68:28] Crazy, right? I haven't thought about like $2.50 a month because the Facebook for when you log in for selling your animals.

[68:34] So this is what it looks like in real time. So this is, let's say this is a gym on it.

[68:37] Even though he's got a time of this thing on it.

[68:39] Just to say it's a gym.

[68:40] So there's got, you know, he's got old-spice, marketing to him. He's got, he's got equipment manufacturers that they're out TV.

[68:48] Or else, he'd you piece me.

[68:50] Then you've got a payroll and you've got software and then you've got gym watch.

[68:55] Me, marketing against, right?

[68:58] Well, I cannot spend all these guys.

[69:00] So this is what happens.

[69:01] I own all of his eyes.

[69:03] His eyes are mine.

[69:05] Because I can outspend all of them.

[69:06] I'll artificially raise the prices so that they can't bid on his eyes.

[69:12] So it's a ethical, I don't have to go.

[69:15] It's a legal way to create them when I'm on it.

[69:18] If I can make so much more money than rest of my competitors, then I can load every eyeball that's in my audience.

[69:23] Because I'll set the CPM so high in no one else can bid.

[69:26] I'm bidding against myself to give him high.

[69:28] So make sense?

[69:30] That's like position of fuck you.

[69:32] That's what the back end is.

[69:34] Okay, and that's why I refer to Lifetime Gross Prophecy, the arm joint and grace of business.

[69:37] Like if you have this, you have the biggest stick.

[69:39] So here's the six ways that I increase Lifetime Gross Prophecy.

[69:43] Number one, you can increase the price, which we didn't know a little genie example.

[69:47] That's just one of them.

[69:48] The second one is you can reduce the actual cost of the filament.

[69:51] I'll show you some of the ways that we look at.

[69:53] Number three is you can increase the number of purchases that a customer does.

[69:56] Number four is you can upsell them, which has two different types of upsells.

[70:00] One is making something better.

[70:02] The other was selling more of the same thing.

[70:03] So one is quality, one is quantity.

[70:05] Downs sells is the opposite of that.

[70:07] So it's poor quality, lower quantity, a fewer fewer.

[70:10] And then six is cross sells.

[70:12] So it's what's the adjacent need they're going to have.

[70:15] So there's a lot of people just kind of locked cross sells and upsells together.

[70:18] And I don't like to.

[70:19] I like I think there's more nuance to them.

[70:20] And if you can think, as you can think of nuance, you'll act in nuance.

[70:23] You may want to think more creatively about the business.

[70:26] So increasing price, this one's a quick one.

[70:28] Look at the difference in Lifetime revenue and gross profit.

[70:31] If I increase the price by 50%, I doubled my profit.

[70:35] I have this conversation with Jim owners all the time.

[70:37] On average, we increase the recurring revenue by 38 dollars a month.

[70:40] The average image, 12 and a half percent net margins.

[70:42] The average image is at $129.

[70:44] So if I had $38 and they're making $12.5, I just 3.1 x their profit.

[70:50] They're like, what do I care about 30 bucks?

[70:52] And like, I'm going to triple your fucking profit.

[70:54] That's why this is important.

[70:56] So number one, if there's a weight increase, the perceived value,

[70:59] that's what we do to bake the offer all that stuff.

[71:01] It's so that we can raise the price so we can make more money.

[71:04] Number one, so just one be quicker.

[71:06] They're just more visuals, but they're fast.

[71:08] That's the easy.

[71:09] So my wife called me.

[71:10] There we go.

[71:11] So number one, is if you have people in your company that are doing like basic administrative

[71:15] or even semi skilled work, you can outsource it for $4.9 to $10.

[71:19] And they do a great job.

[71:20] Just FYI, so you can probably cut down your cost of filming for a lot of services

[71:25] that you sell or produce it yourself.

[71:26] And by doing that, you still increase the margin, which increases your lifetime

[71:30] risk profit, which allows you to make more.

[71:32] And spend more aggressively.

[71:34] Another one that we do is tools and software.

[71:37] So like, this is uptight, for example.

[71:38] I've got this video guy that I paid, but I used to pay to do all this stuff.

[71:42] But now we can do other stuff, right?

[71:44] Which is like automatically get the things caption, get that nice like meme cover

[71:48] and like the progress bar.

[71:50] It does it all of that, all of that with a click of a button.

[71:53] And so it's like, well great.

[71:54] Well then now you have all this other time to do high value stuff,

[71:57] rather than do this, this kind of stuff.

[71:59] So there's things like that.

[72:00] So there's software that can take a lot of the high value labor

[72:04] and just automate it.

[72:05] Technology.

[72:06] So if you have tax, or like our agency software, for example,

[72:09] makes tamper responses, it increases the chat efficiency of a person

[72:13] by about 100x.

[72:14] All right.

[72:15] And so by doing that, we make the cost of fulfilling

[72:17] leap nurturing, a hundredth of what it would normally be.

[72:20] And so I can sell it at a reasonable rate, but it cost me pennies,

[72:23] compared to what it cost my competitors.

[72:25] And so when you have this type of advantage,

[72:27] then I can make ridiculous profits because I'm pricing at market.

[72:31] But it cost me nothing.

[72:33] And so I have so much more room compared to everyone else.

[72:36] And then forecasting, if you're in a product's business,

[72:39] buying wholesale obviously, if you have to cash below,

[72:41] we do that a lot or sell from the side to safety cruise starting.

[72:44] Do you hear starpods to goods?

[72:45] All right.

[72:46] So this is what it looks like visually.

[72:47] And then that's what it looks like.

[72:48] So the top line didn't change, but the bottom line did.

[72:51] That's the difference.

[72:52] This still is an increase in lifetime birth profit.

[72:55] Check box number three.

[72:56] Increase number of purchases.

[72:57] Here we go.

[72:58] So number one is decreasing sure, which is a KAA getting people to buy again.

[73:02] All right.

[73:03] So that is providing a better service,

[73:05] doing more activation, more onboarding, etc.

[73:07] And number two is increasing the quality of the product.

[73:10] This was increased by for repeat purchases.

[73:12] All right.

[73:13] So most people right now don't do any of this.

[73:15] Like there's so many ways to reach people.

[73:17] So I told you like there's little pockets of cash right now in your business.

[73:20] This is probably a positive cash for you, just like literally just weird increase

[73:23] of sleep.

[73:24] Increasing the baller.

[73:25] And then finally increase client outcome,

[73:28] to increase volume for refresher.

[73:30] That was for you.

[73:31] Right.

[73:32] And so if I can increase number of purchases effectively,

[73:34] if I have a refresher thing, then how can I increase the outcomes?

[73:36] How can I increase them skills that will make them more money?

[73:39] Right.

[73:40] So that they will intern and pay people.

[73:42] All right.

[73:43] And this is what that looks like.

[73:44] So if I'm increasing number of purchases,

[73:46] I'm not increasing my margin on a relative basis.

[73:49] But an absolute basis.

[73:51] I now have twice as much as I did before.

[73:54] Is everyone thinking like the purpose of this is so that you can think about your own

[73:57] services and products and think, I will be an easy thing that I could do right now

[74:01] and just make more money.

[74:02] Right.

[74:03] These are all the different ways you can increase life to value of customers.

[74:05] Upsells.

[74:06] All right.

[74:07] So there's two types of upsells.

[74:09] Number one is you can sell more of something.

[74:12] One burger goes to two burgers.

[74:14] Number two is you can make a better burger.

[74:16] You go from small burger to a big burger or a normal burger to an organic burger,

[74:20] whatever.

[74:21] Two different types of upsells.

[74:22] So right now, if you have a fore service,

[74:23] if you're thinking, what kind of upsells could I do?

[74:25] Can I sell more of it?

[74:27] Can I sell better version of it?

[74:28] Because they're easy things.

[74:29] A lot of times you just serve in the customers, ask what they want.

[74:31] All right.

[74:32] So when I'm thinking about upsells,

[74:34] number one is units.

[74:35] I can sell more web pages.

[74:36] If I was selling web pages,

[74:37] or if I was now getting some more types of pages.

[74:39] Right.

[74:40] Number two would be like if I'm selling service,

[74:43] I could sell it by units of time.

[74:45] So if I'm in units in terms of quantity and I also have time.

[74:48] So if I'm trying to do upsell for more,

[74:50] I think about both of them.

[74:52] As a right now, if you have different things inside of your business,

[74:55] like if you're currently selling support,

[74:57] why don't you sell 12 months of support?

[74:59] Why should sell 24 months of support?

[75:00] If you're selling one site,

[75:02] why don't we sell a 10-tab website?

[75:04] It's units.

[75:05] By the way, there's always more units you can sell if you think you think you're a problem.

[75:09] Next one is service as more.

[75:12] So this would have looked like visually.

[75:14] Boom.

[75:15] So now you'll notice, again,

[75:17] this is the same duration of time.

[75:19] They're not staying longer necessarily,

[75:21] but we're getting them to buy more of the same thing.

[75:23] That's why the margins are the same.

[75:25] I'm going to show you different example later,

[75:27] where the margins are different.

[75:29] So now this is the second type of upsell, which is better.

[75:32] So you've got, let's say, normal service,

[75:35] and that could give you expert service.

[75:37] That's quality.

[75:38] A different version of quality,

[75:39] just because I like to give examples,

[75:41] is the enhanced burner, like I said earlier.

[75:44] Before that, you've got webpagesign,

[75:47] and then you've got webpagesign that loads really fast.

[75:50] Speed.

[75:51] Remember this at the value equation?

[75:53] These are the values.

[75:55] Quality, time,

[75:57] decrease, sound, background,

[75:58] decrease, average, and sound,

[75:59] decrease, time.

[76:00] Those are the things that you're reversing

[76:02] when you're thinking about your upsells.

[76:04] Another version of this,

[76:06] if you have a slow burger or a fast burger,

[76:08] you can wait 20 minutes for it,

[76:10] you can get it in the brain.

[76:11] It's more valuable.

[76:12] So you can upsell that.

[76:13] Same with service.

[76:14] Do you have chats of port?

[76:16] Where do you have phone call support?

[76:18] That's an upsell.

[76:19] So that's accessing convenience.

[76:21] And in the burger example,

[76:23] are you getting it home?

[76:24] Where's it getting delivered?

[76:25] So if I'm thinking about upsells for

[76:27] enhancements that are better,

[76:29] you've got quality, you've got speed,

[76:31] and you've got accessing convenience.

[76:33] So right now,

[76:34] is anyone can anyone think of something

[76:35] that should be upselling?

[76:36] That's one of these things in your own business?

[76:39] Great.

[76:40] Awesome.

[76:41] So, Pro Tip,

[76:42] is anyone here competing

[76:43] in somebody who gives their stuff away from free?

[76:45] Like what you sell.

[76:46] Sometimes happens in software.

[76:48] So, if you're ever competing against the free competitor,

[76:51] the only thing that beats free is speed,

[76:54] fast beats free.

[76:56] If once a year on Chipotle

[76:58] gives away a free burrito

[77:00] to anyone who dresses like a burrito.

[77:02] And if I want to get Chipotle out of Halloween,

[77:04] I've got to wait two hours.

[77:06] If there was a wine,

[77:08] next to the free line,

[77:09] for $10 to buy Chipotle,

[77:11] I would pay the $10 to not get the free burrito in weight.

[77:14] People pay for speed.

[77:16] So fast beats free.

[77:17] A lot of people don't think about

[77:18] the components of time for their offers.

[77:20] Okay.

[77:21] With better, it's the same concept.

[77:23] All right, but you'll notice

[77:24] with this upsell,

[77:26] I can make much more profit.

[77:28] But, and so,

[77:30] interestingly,

[77:31] you are upsell

[77:32] can have a lot more profit

[77:34] than your core offer, can it?

[77:35] Right?

[77:36] Which is pretty good to you.

[77:37] I have the numbers over here

[77:39] if you're saying them behind the pedagos.

[77:41] And so, this is a quick Pro Tip for you as well.

[77:43] If you are doing upsells,

[77:45] many times,

[77:46] you want the upsell price to be five times

[77:48] the core offer price.

[77:49] Here's why.

[77:50] Customers are fractal,

[77:52] they're 80 to 20.

[77:53] So, it's the pre-operantable, right?

[77:55] And so, 20% of my customers,

[77:57] one out of five,

[77:58] if I would have double my revenue,

[78:00] I'd five extra price

[78:01] so that one out of five buys my five times higher price.

[78:03] And so, I'd double the revenue,

[78:04] my business by adding a single upsell.

[78:06] But,

[78:08] I might have way higher margins on my upsell

[78:10] than I have on my original.

[78:11] So, I might two or three x

[78:13] before x,

[78:14] my profit by having that upsell.

[78:16] Downsells.

[78:17] So, this is an easy one that fucking knowing does.

[78:19] There's two types of downsells.

[78:21] The people that we're going to say know that then say yes.

[78:23] And the second is people who are going to leave

[78:25] within step.

[78:26] All right?

[78:27] And so, think about all these as little golden BBs

[78:29] in the business.

[78:30] Pro Tip for this is if your sales guy's

[78:32] for example, never sell the low cost things

[78:34] because they get on the phone

[78:35] and they can't just, you have this thing

[78:36] they never sell it.

[78:37] We do a, we buy you a lunch.

[78:40] It's a simplest thing in the world.

[78:42] We say who's buying lunch today?

[78:43] And so, if anyone sells our low cost product

[78:45] because everyone wants to know

[78:46] how you get an unqualified leader

[78:47] to get by the real thing, right?

[78:49] And so, whoever sells the lowest ticket thing

[78:52] that day, the low-word ticket thing,

[78:54] the downsell, watches bought

[78:56] and that sales guy's honor.

[78:57] It worked better than the commissions.

[78:59] There's just happening to get steak,

[79:00] you know, steak or grump up every day.

[79:02] And so, they just motivate them

[79:03] every morning to try and get

[79:04] to get lunch cover for them.

[79:06] So, a downsell,

[79:08] you have a worse version, right?

[79:10] You have one on one, you can't really see it here.

[79:12] And a group, right?

[79:13] Version of whatever the thing you have is,

[79:15] the level of support.

[79:16] You might have a full sweet solution

[79:18] and then you can have a done with you

[79:20] or do it yourself solution.

[79:22] So, you have different levels of service

[79:23] that you're going to put with it, okay?

[79:25] And so, let's say in this first example,

[79:27] someone says no, and then says yes,

[79:29] so they say no to the core offers

[79:31] we make no money.

[79:32] And now, we make a extra,

[79:34] and here's what's really cool.

[79:35] The downsells oftentimes for us,

[79:37] are actually higher margin.

[79:39] So, we sell stuff that is almost 100%

[79:41] margins for our downsells.

[79:42] So, even though we make less absolute money,

[79:44] we still usually do pretty decent profit on it, right?

[79:47] And so, and that's natural

[79:48] because there's going to be buying something

[79:49] that is lesser naturally, right?

[79:51] So, you don't want to give something

[79:52] that's like equal or it's still cost you

[79:54] time and money on it downsell.

[79:56] All right.

[79:57] So, the second one is,

[79:58] is that it getting them to leave,

[79:59] we have to stay.

[80:00] And so, we say hey,

[80:01] I know you were at this level of support.

[80:03] We'll let you stay for this now.

[80:04] We're going to remove one thing

[80:06] that you don't care about.

[80:07] And so, you probably have more than one service

[80:09] or feature that you offer.

[80:10] Remove one,

[80:11] and then give it to them at the lesser price.

[80:13] That way you can have to think

[80:14] they're not trying to get a rates for different people.

[80:16] So, in some sense,

[80:17] which of these things Katherine do you hate?

[80:19] That you never use.

[80:20] This one?

[80:21] Great. Not good off.

[80:22] Now, you can get it at this price.

[80:23] Because, especially like software,

[80:25] you'll get a lot better.

[80:26] You'll extend the LCV of the customer.

[80:28] Last one.

[80:29] Cross-cells.

[80:30] Everyone talks about these.

[80:31] I'll show you a couple of cool things

[80:32] with these that we do.

[80:33] Okay.

[80:34] What are all aspects of the customer journey?

[80:36] Immediately before and after purchase is coming.

[80:38] What is their next national aid?

[80:39] So, this is the question.

[80:40] So, if you're looking at your customer journey,

[80:42] what is the thing that they normally do immediately before?

[80:45] They start doing business with you.

[80:46] And what is the thing that they do immediately after?

[80:49] They start doing business with you.

[80:50] After they purchase.

[80:51] There's usually a next national thing.

[80:53] There's lots of pairings that happen with sales.

[80:56] There's like, you made them make the decision

[80:58] to do or invest in something.

[81:00] Right?

[81:01] Usually, there's other stuff that comes in

[81:02] to the result of that decision.

[81:04] We did the hard work of spending money to acquire the customer,

[81:06] getting in the phone, doing 16-volocals,

[81:08] to get them to clubs.

[81:10] They get the rest of the fucking money around them.

[81:12] Right?

[81:13] And so, there's two ways to do this.

[81:15] Number one is, you can refer the business out

[81:17] and receive commissions.

[81:19] We do this all the time.

[81:20] We make millions and commissions just for

[81:22] sending business that we say,

[81:23] hey, this is a report for a partner.

[81:25] This is who we recommend.

[81:26] And just like, as soon as you're earlier,

[81:28] if I'm sending these guys business, they'll send business back.

[81:31] Right?

[81:32] And I'll get paid on it.

[81:33] So, I'm sending business, getting paid,

[81:35] and getting customers as a goodwill.

[81:37] So, make sense?

[81:38] Okay.

[81:39] Number two, is that if it's like a lot of money

[81:43] that you're referring away.

[81:44] So, for example, with the Jim, we taught them how to sell

[81:46] something.

[81:47] I did the math in my head and I was like,

[81:49] there's a lot of something.

[81:50] So, let's build that.

[81:52] So, we decided to build that,

[81:53] but the entire business ended.

[81:55] So, I'll be able to do it with the mortgages

[81:57] who's doing the bank accounts.

[81:58] He's referring that business out.

[81:59] And at a certain point, you look at the math in your life.

[82:01] Fuck, we should be opening that.

[82:02] Right? We're sitting these guys.

[82:03] These guys are making more money on our customers and we are.

[82:05] If that's ever the answer,

[82:06] these guys are making more money on my customers than I am,

[82:08] then that makes this the due business.

[82:10] Most times, they're not.

[82:11] So, I'm not as well to take 30 percent,

[82:13] 20 percent, 40 percent commission,

[82:14] and not have to do with the headache.

[82:16] But still get all these little rep new streams.

[82:18] Right? I'm going to fill it for like 20 different things

[82:20] that we just get paid for every single month

[82:22] because we would tell them to do it anyways.

[82:24] So, like, as soon as you sign up for the Jim,

[82:27] well, I'm in a teller. Well, hey, they become affiliates of ours

[82:30] for the supplements because they refer the business.

[82:32] Right? But it's like, what a pair of brands.

[82:34] Because they're going to be like, what things

[82:36] my hands are hard? What gloves should I use?

[82:38] Here's my book of all of my affiliates,

[82:41] I'll buy them with you together.

[82:42] And just like that, we made another $200

[82:44] in my customer that took no effort.

[82:46] Right? So, there are these extra-next natural things

[82:49] that your customers are buying.

[82:51] Know what they are and they just provide them for the

[82:53] ahead of time and get paid for it.

[82:54] So, across those, the simple answer.

[82:56] Simple example.

[82:57] Burger, you want to cope with that.

[83:00] Right? It's different. It's not another burger or a better burger

[83:03] or a faster burger. It's a cook. Right?

[83:05] From selling fitness, we do want supplements with that.

[83:09] Yes. Right? Next version.

[83:11] From selling website design.

[83:13] I say, hey, now that we have your website,

[83:14] do you want to get advertising with that?

[83:16] Hey, do you want to support with that?

[83:18] Right? These are all next natural things that they're going to have.

[83:20] Do you want ads and super-previous,

[83:22] sport and fast cloud service hosting, whatever the text

[83:26] stuff, whatever, more that stuff.

[83:28] All of these are cross-cells that we use.

[83:30] So, if you can list out the customer needs

[83:32] and think about before and after, it's the easiest way to think about it.

[83:35] Then you'll be able to capture all of this gold in front of you.

[83:38] Right? And so, this is where a lot of the juice is squeezed.

[83:41] You go from, you know, you have 500 revenue, 250

[83:44] in gross profits, you know, 520.

[83:46] Just buy this example.

[83:47] Because you have a ton of extra margin of these.

[83:49] I think, I have an example right here.

[83:52] So, I don't know if you guys know this,

[83:53] I still have this original marketer.

[83:55] You can actually build an entire business off cross-cells.

[83:57] So, if your core product doesn't have enough juice in it,

[84:01] you can actually market down below the competitors,

[84:05] give it away for free or at a loss, called loss layer.

[84:08] And then, upsell the coke in the fries,

[84:11] because you know that's the role of the profit is.

[84:13] You make the better burger, you sell the cost of a low cost.

[84:15] And then, so you said, this is the example.

[84:18] You want to get a person to drive the road.

[84:20] Or an 18 cents in gross profit, right?

[84:22] On the burger, but then you make on the $2.00 burger,

[84:25] so that you make a dollar 14 on fries and coke, right?

[84:28] You're making six times the profit on the upsell.

[84:31] So, if you know these things about your business,

[84:34] and you know that there's an adjacent thing that's way higher margin

[84:36] and easier for you, that you're usually just referring it away,

[84:39] well, hey, make sure you're capturing it,

[84:41] and be if you're not, then bring it in house.

[84:43] So, that was the six. I'll do it on this real quick for you.

[84:46] And hey, make your customers more valuable.

[84:49] And be able to use any acquisition channel, be down there on Facebook.

[84:51] So, that is the six of the long-trace of life's value.

[84:55] There we go, checkbox, warm guy, math, traffic offer money.

[84:59] Those are the four farmers that we used to go up to $1,000,

[85:02] $2,212,000, $1,411.

[85:04] You guys get another quick grab up?

[85:06] Yeah. Okay, fantastic.

[85:07] So, I do we cover a lot.

[85:08] We talked about the only way to grow a business.

[85:10] There's only two. Get more customers, make them work more, right?

[85:13] We talk to the four frameworks. We got the math.

[85:15] How do we park customers in a profit?

[85:17] The offer, how to get complete strangers to raise their hands,

[85:20] and give you money.

[85:21] Number three, how to never run out of customers,

[85:23] because there's unlimited different pools that you can go through,

[85:25] and then the money. How do you come up beautiful on the back end?

[85:28] This is the math framework that I showed you guys earlier.

[85:30] Hopefully this should now make sense to you in terms of how you can actually make a profit

[85:33] with $0 upfront on a foreign customers.

[85:35] The number one formula that is literally good in the basis on which I built my acquisition life.

[85:40] How it works in a day-to-day basis from day-to-day as you're doing this process?

[85:44] Be offered itself, right, in the seven components that I look at,

[85:48] that I can kind of boost any of the offers I have, adding guarantees,

[85:52] recycling the, you know, recycling the Navy formula, adding her,

[85:55] see adding scarcity, making the core of her smaller, adding the bonuses,

[85:58] making sure that the core offers solving the four main value drivers.

[86:01] Seeing if I can offer free, front end or discount front end,

[86:04] so I can attract more customers.

[86:06] The value equation itself, we can always use and think back to to make your core thing more valuable.

[86:11] There's the visuals for those.

[86:13] Scares today, urgency, guarantees, magic naming formula,

[86:18] the traffic.

[86:19] We talked about this, the six different new client sources.

[86:23] But boom, if you didn't get that picture earlier,

[86:25] and then, make them worth more.

[86:27] That's the equation that we use for if you have a civil business or a growth hurry business.

[86:30] There's the equation that's encapsulated,

[86:32] as then you can always measure your gifts that.

[86:34] We now know how much more powerful pricing is,

[86:37] comparing to adding more customers,

[86:39] we're getting them to buy more.

[86:40] Both those things are good.

[86:41] This is the biggest leverage in your business.

[86:43] So I showed you six ways to make more money in the customer.

[86:45] That's the top one.

[86:47] Six ways to increase LTGP.

[86:50] Increase price, reduce cost, increase number purchases,

[86:53] upsells, downsells, cross-cells.

[86:55] Getting downsells, you can either get them to stay longer

[86:58] or just turn and know into a yes from that.

[87:00] All the different versions of the cross-cells that exist.

[87:02] I think you can think of, which is always the next to Jason Need.

[87:05] As long as you put a question.

[87:07] Let me ask you a slow question.

[87:09] Do you feel like you can use any of these frameworks?

[87:12] Yes.

[87:13] Do you feel like you understand how low car cost was profitably

[87:16] and grow without capital?

[87:17] Yes.

[87:18] So those of you don't have the capital to spend.

[87:20] Do you feel like you can create a new business?

[87:22] You can create a more valuable offer that would get more conversions

[87:25] and higher prices now.

[87:26] Do you feel like you have new client sources that you haven't neglected

[87:29] and can easily use right now?

[87:31] Even if you use just a single piece of a single framework

[87:35] to get you more customers or make them work more,

[87:37] will you share time with us?

[87:38] Yes.

[87:39] Yes.

[87:40] Awesome.

[87:41] Thank you for having me.

[87:42] Thank you.

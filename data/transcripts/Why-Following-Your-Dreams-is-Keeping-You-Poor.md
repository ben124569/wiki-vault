[00:00] Falling your passion keeps people poor or at least poor the they ought to be and maybe you feel lost right now

[00:06] I get it. I've been there. I was dead broke in my early 20s and I read all the self-help books

[00:10] I could get my hands on and a lot of them said fall your passion and ironically that didn't help me

[00:15] Then I started changing what I did and my life changed as a result

[00:19] So problem number one with fall your passion it gets caused and effect backwards

[00:24] So often we become passionate about things after we get good at them not before

[00:28] You will hear people say fall your passion you hear really smart people very successful people say that and think about why they might say that

[00:34] They're like well, let me look at myself. I'm passionate about what I do

[00:37] So just do what I do be passionate

[00:40] But the thing is is it's just like saying hey if you're gonna be rich fly privateer

[00:43] If you want to be tall go play basketball it doesn't work that way you get rich and then as a results of being rich

[00:50] You can fly private. It's not that flying private's the reason that you're rich, right?

[00:54] So you will do the work to become passionate not that being passionate is necessarily thing

[01:00] Now here's thing some people are like well some people just naturally have a passion no

[01:04] They found the thing earlier they had their chance experience when they were in their early toddler years

[01:10] Or they're five six seven they start painting and that's like oh god

[01:13] So they fall the same process they had some sort of chance encounter

[01:16] They start doing a little bit of deliberate practice all of a sudden they realize they're valuing their skill

[01:21] Their parents their friends like oh you're good at drawing. Oh you must really like this and then boom

[01:25] All of a sudden deeper passion emerges. They start identifying as it and then boom

[01:29] Confidence skill and then passion and so I say this to say that some of you myself included like never really had

[01:35] Something that just magically occurred

[01:37] You have to start stuff that you're not necessarily as good at and have broader exposure

[01:42] Stoody allowed chance to take root number two

[01:44] It's too vague and assumes everyone has a clear passion and many people have no idea

[01:49] Right, so it's hard to say that you like X more than Y you might like both right and so it's very hard to quantify

[01:56] Makes it hard to decide and so how good you are at something is a little bit easier to make an AB decision

[02:02] All right, so if I said you know do you like pizza more than you like tacos?

[02:05] You would be like I don't know like I kind of like both of them right

[02:08] But if I said are you better at English than you are at math?

[02:11] It's probably easier for you to make call there right and so preferences versus skills are

[02:16] easier to determine a decision path which then gives you clarity on what next steps to take

[02:22] So even examples of Bill Gates tried a bunch of different things

[02:25] We tried law I tried mathematics you try programming before he found his direction and he wasn't following a clear passion

[02:30] But he was exploring his abilities and opportunities and I'll give you a personal example back in the day before I started business

[02:36] I was like why kind of like throw you and I learned a little bit about that

[02:39] I was like I like fitness and I like test prep and so I kind of had these different skill sets and these different domains

[02:45] But I was only able to have clarity once I started and then took action on it because then the feedback loop begins

[02:49] And so the objective of developing passion is to get a feedback loop started

[02:55] So three liking something doesn't make you good at it

[02:58] All right, so think about like this being passionate doesn't even guarantee that you have the skills for it

[03:03] And sometimes it's better to have a career and enjoy your passions and your free time my dad used to tell me

[03:08] Well, if I did what I was passionate about I'd be a bartender at a ski slope and I mean

[03:12] Used to say it in just but like the point where I'm clear to me. He was like listen

[03:16] There's things that you do to provide for your family. There's things that you do to provide for yourself

[03:20] Build a future have security and there's things that you do with your free time now

[03:23] Some people are like those things could be one of the same, but I'll tell you what my dad loves what he does and

[03:28] I'll tell you that he didn't start it because he loved it

[03:30] He started because he wanted to be a productive member of society

[03:33] Maybe it's a little bit that immigrant in me but like you know the rest of the world isn't so comfortable that they're sitting in sunshine and rainbows

[03:39] But here's the crazy part many of them are more fulfilled than we are because they don't see anything wrong with doing the work

[03:44] Doing the work is seen as a very like it's seen as a due to for responsibility

[03:48] It's seen as a good thing guy provides first family nothing wrong with that

[03:51] So I'll give you a little a little example here

[03:54] So warmbuff it follows the philosophy that he calls the circle of competence, right?

[03:58] Which is focusing not on what excites you but on what you understand best and his passion follows his competence not the other way around

[04:06] So for example me personally all the jimmelons I know love fitness

[04:10] But many of them were very broke and so they said hey

[04:14] I should start a business around fitness because I'm passionate about it and then made no money because they had to realize oh wait

[04:19] I don't really think about business and so it's like being

[04:22] Understanding fitness is like 5% of the fitness business. It's just kind of like oh I like cooking

[04:26] I should start a restaurant. It's like what's about 5% and what's crazy is the thing that you're actually a passion about cooking or doing fitness

[04:32] Has almost nothing to do with monetizing that skill

[04:35] Real so here's the fourth reason I think it's bad advice ball your passion

[04:39] Skips the hard work part

[04:40] So getting really good at something means practicing the boring or the hard parts too

[04:45] Right, so for example I actually really like playing ping pong something that I enjoy

[04:49] So I decided I was like oh I'm gonna look into what it would take to get better at ping pong because I do like it

[04:54] And I played a lot when I can and I started watching what some of the teams do and they're like all right

[04:59] 500 forehands 500 backhands in a row and I was like oh

[05:02] Yeah, I don't want to do this

[05:05] It's so I may be passionate about it, but I don't want to do the work that is required to go from

[05:10] Passion it to like world class or state level or whatever, right all of the research on deliberate practice shows that

[05:18] It's not an enjoyable process. I want to say this again all the research on deliberate practice

[05:23] Which is required for competence and competence is certainly required for making money and whatever

[05:28] Curie what is that it is not an enjoyable process. This is what the research showed

[05:32] All right, I was actually kind of blown away by that and so when you're repeating the same salescript over and over again

[05:36] It's not that fun, all right. It's very tedious

[05:39] Or you do the same basketball shot over and over again, right or you know you do the same presentation the same speech

[05:44] You do it over and over and over again. So it's not novel

[05:47] It's just focused on tiny iterations on feedback loops

[05:50] It's just sanding off the edges over and over and over again and once all of the first level of roughness is faded off

[05:56] You take out a lower grade sandpaper and then all of a sudden you do it another level of

[06:02] Miss like you just you approach it and levels of feedback. I mean one of my favorite quotes from myself

[06:07] Is the real work begins when the excitement to work ends a lot of skill development is like running a marathon

[06:14] Where you have a couple people might cheer you on the beginning for making a decision to start and then for 26.1 miles

[06:20] Basically no one cares

[06:22] You're running and you're like wow, this is really long and then you're like oh my god

[06:26] I have to do four more of these one fifths right here like oh my god

[06:29] This is there are five more of these one fifths is tough and then at the very end

[06:33] Right is you're about to accomplish people just see you sprint the last bit and they're like oh

[06:37] Congratulations, but you're like it's the mundane middle you have to master the middle

[06:41] That's where all the that's where all the gains come in

[06:44] So I'll share a rule that has worked very well for me for developing skills and so this is the hundred million all leads book

[06:50] Step four of outbound. I talked about this which is reach out to them a hundred a hundred per day

[06:54] Right and so I call this the rule of what hundred I talk about it length a little further in the book

[06:59] But like when I did my book lunch actually for this book two years ago

[07:02] I practiced the presentation that I did

[07:06] 90 times before I actually did it live

[07:08] Right now the rule of 100 is by doing a hundred per day

[07:11] I'd say it's hard for me to do an entire price to 100 times six

[07:14] There's literally not a much more than a hour's but I did it three full times per day was a 90 minute presentation

[07:18] It's about four and a half hours of deliberate practice per day and I would watch the recording and then I would tweak the presentation

[07:24] Where I stumbled or I felt like I needed a better visual whatever and I did that every single day

[07:28] And so the idea is that it just requires significantly more work and it's also not going to be fun and the more practice you have at

[07:36] Practicing the better you get at it because I know that practice proceeds

[07:41] Excellence and so the more times you start practicing and realizing that that practice leads to winning

[07:47] You start to get excited to practice not for that practice itself

[07:51] But because what practice means to you because you know what comes after practice, which is winning

[07:56] Here's the fifth reason that I think follow your passion is terrible advice

[07:59] It also sets false expectations

[08:03] So it makes you feel like work should always be fun and exciting and it isn't an early mentor of mine told me and I will never forget this

[08:08] He said never try to make money out of something you love

[08:11] He said because then you'll just ruin it and turn it into work and it was so interesting because he was a very successful guy

[08:17] And of course you're gonna have people in both sides of this and again

[08:20] I want to be clear. I think that you want to do things you enjoy

[08:24] I just think that it takes time of not enjoying it to get to the part where you enjoy it because it takes time to get good

[08:30] And so for anybody who's gonna like try and blow me up on this

[08:33] Biomines do it we're all gonna die and no one's gonna remember us

[08:36] But like the point is you have to develop passion rather than follow it you have to create it and so I'll give you a different example

[08:44] Many Hollywood actors realize that it sucks and that many actually inquires involve

[08:51] more waiting rejection and business administration

[08:54] Then actually creative fulfillment and so Jeff basis talks about this recent everything is overhead and so there's like you might

[09:01] Have you basically have like maybe 10% or 20% or 30% of your day like if you have 30% of your day that you're love

[09:06] I feel like you're winning it life

[09:08] Right because the other 70% of stuff that is required in order to get that 30% because the thing is is let's look at the alternative

[09:15] You could just do nothing

[09:16] Right and I think that if you do nothing or you hate everything you do that there's probably a middle path and

[09:22] I'll also say something that I think most people will disagree with but I'll just shoot

[09:26] I'm gonna shoot my shot. I think that the way that you approach the work you do

[09:31] can fundamentally change the work itself and so there's this great

[09:37] I think it's a parable or knowledge maybe it's a story

[09:40] But basically of this man who basically swept floors for like 35 years and he just did an amazing job at the Japanese story

[09:47] And the way that he approached this and was like how are you like there's no way that this is fun or interesting and

[09:55] He ends up saying like I imagine that they're paying me a million dollars every single day to sweep the floors

[10:00] And so I think how would I sweep them if they paid me a million dollars every day to sweep and so it changes

[10:07] entire perception of how

[10:10] To approach the work and if the work that you do

[10:14] I saw this this this little post that went viral the other day of a waiter that had a tip that said do better

[10:20] Right, so instead of having money there

[10:22] It's said basically zero dollars and the person said do better and he said normally

[10:26] You know, I could you know take this and be like really offended or say these people sucks

[10:30] But he decided to take it to heart and so the next day he shut up to work

[10:35] And was like I'm just gonna try and be the best he's like oh, I'm trying to remember one's name

[10:39] I'm gonna try and smile the charismatic he's like in the craziest thing happened all of a sudden

[10:43] People were telling me I was so nice and they started giving me bigger tips and they started talking to me about other

[10:48] Opportunities and the thing is is that he was still doing the same job

[10:51] But he was the way he approached it was different and so like would you say that you're was he did he become passionate about his work

[10:59] Or he did he just decide to see the larger picture that the work we do works on us

[11:05] More than we work on it and so

[11:07] That leaves me naturally to the sixth reason that I think follow your passion is terrible advice

[11:13] It also just ignores money realities right just because you love something doesn't mean you can make enough money doing it

[11:18] So just look at American I don't try outs right ain't nobody try to see them saying right even though those people love it

[11:24] And so I remember for me early in my career

[11:27] I wasn't driven really by a specific passion

[11:29] I just didn't really want to be broken anymore like as terrible as this sounds like people used to ask me like

[11:34] What's the mission of gym launch the mission of gym launch when I started gym launch was Alex not being broke

[11:39] That was the mission of gym launch now here's the thing

[11:43] As I developed the business it did become to take an industry from its needs to its feet

[11:48] But at the moment when I started gym launch I just lost everything for the second time and I was like I

[11:55] I am not doing this again

[11:57] It's like this has to work right and so I say this that like a lot of people have a lot of romances

[12:02] But it's just not based in reality and people doctor their memories

[12:06] They look back and it feels different than when you're going through it

[12:10] I'll give you some examples when you look back on some of the hardest things you've gone through you probably have a sense of pride for having gotten through them

[12:17] But you're proud and retrospect and so if someone says hey, you know, what's it like it's like oh, you know what you got to

[12:23] You just got to enjoy the moment you got to revel in it

[12:27] It's like you're not reveling in it. It sucks

[12:29] But you keep going you persist because of what you know

[12:32] It's building inside of you the skill sets so that you get persevere at a higher level

[12:37] So I'll give you a give you a business example. All right, so there's a very harsh reality of supply and demand

[12:44] All right, and so if your passion is something that a lot of people like to do

[12:47] There's probably a lot of people wanting to do it and so that means there's a lot of supply and so it's gonna be super super competitive

[12:54] Think acting think singing think painting and so it might not be the most realistic path for making money and like one of my

[13:02] Owners said it's like what stops you from just painting when you want to paint and then making money when you want to make money

[13:07] So I have the reason I think that

[13:09] Follow your advice is

[13:10] Follow your advice is bad advice

[13:12] Is bad passion follow your passion is bad advice all right?

[13:15] Is that it misses often more important life things?

[13:19] All right, so good work needs decent pay good coworkers good recognition

[13:24] Security and purpose all right, and so the environment you work in will absolutely affect how much you like it and how long

[13:31] You can endure it all right, so this is a quote from my good friend Sharon

[13:35] Survatsa

[13:37] In my 20s I thought it was about the destination in my 30s

[13:41] I thought it was about the journey and in my 40s I realized it's about the company and I thought that was so profound

[13:48] It's like in the beginning you're just like you're always like how do we get there?

[13:50] How do we get there and then little later you're like you know what it's about?

[13:53] Enjoy the process, but then later you're like well, how do I enjoy the process?

[13:57] Well, if I've got the people I like around me it makes almost any process enjoyable and so there's other components that

[14:03] Factor in the overall soup of what you want to do in your life and what you actually spend your time on it

[14:08] And so I'll give you two examples so imagine

[14:12] You've got one career where you do what you like

[14:15] But it's terrible work environments you hate all the people you actually don't like the the thing you're producing

[14:20] But you like the work that you do, but not with the outcome is right so it's removing purpose

[14:25] And it doesn't allow you to do some of the other things that you enjoy

[14:30] Well, that would probably be pretty painful on the flip side if you had a job where you're like, okay

[14:34] I don't like this component of my job, but I like literally everything else

[14:38] Well, you probably have a more filling life that way now. I will zoom out for a moment if we would break the world for a second

[14:45] You don't need to have a filling life who made that demand at the universe?

[14:50] Anyways

[14:54] So give it something we were like well life should be life should be fulfilling

[14:58] I should it life should make me happy right you just demand of the universe and by doing that by the way

[15:03] You create space between you and the outcome which means you'll never achieve it anyways

[15:08] So eighth reason why failure passion is terrible advice is that it doesn't allow flexibility and a change of work

[15:14] This is a big one all right and a changing you so think about it

[15:18] What did you like when you were 12?

[15:21] Probably different things than you like when you're 22 which I can promise you is different than things that you like at 32 and

[15:27] Probably different than things that you like at 52 and so the thing is is that the world

[15:32] cares also about different things 20 years later and so you are going to change and the world is going to change about what you like and about what it likes

[15:41] And so if you say follow your passion what if you change the world change as that's happening

[15:48] And so being obsessed with your one thing doesn't give you the flexibility to evolve and so

[15:53] For example, what if you were really passionate about making my space pages?

[15:56] That was something really passionate about well the world moved on and so like either you're gonna move on

[16:00] Or the world moves on and if you always obsess about that one thing

[16:03] That's like that might change and if you if you burn all these boats around this one passion

[16:07] It assumes that it will be there forever and that's not reality and

[16:11] Here's the ninth reason that I think follow your passion in starboard-bytes

[16:14] It's self-focused rather than others focused and there's tons of research that says that people who focus on others are the happiest if that's your goal

[16:23] You know, I want to be happy so fun and so we tend to look back and are proud of the heart things that we overcame

[16:30] Especially in service of other people or a larger mission

[16:32] So for me, I would make real business education accessible for everyone and the thing is is that I don't always want to record content

[16:38] I don't always want to think about what we're gonna talk about today or what you know what we're gonna put out

[16:43] but

[16:44] The service of that mission is very valuable for me and there's a different body research

[16:48] I can't tell you where it is so you can choose to believe it or not

[16:52] But that people can actually endure a significantly larger amount of pain for other people

[16:57] So hear me out so if if if you got hooked up to an electric shock machine and they said cool

[17:02] We're just gonna turn this up and just tell us when to stop people stop

[17:06] But if you tell the person that they're loved one is in the other room and that every shock that you take

[17:11] They don't have to take people's tolerance for pain goes up like tenfold and so to me

[17:18] I see that as an allegory for how we can choose to live our lives

[17:21] So that person who's experiencing the pain for let's say they're loved on their wife. They're spouse. They're daughter. They're they're son

[17:26] Do you think that in that moment when they when they feel like they're shielding the storm from the people they love that they don't feel like they have purpose

[17:34] But objectively they're suffering. See others layers to this and

[17:38] So the idea is I think that saying follow your passion is

[17:43] Very self-interested it actually doesn't allow you to plug into a much stronger motivation or fuel and

[17:49] So I would prefer follow your purpose. It's called the martyrdom effect

[17:53] But basically you can handle way more pain in the service of others which is wild

[17:58] But the thing is this is if you're like man, I'm struggling to get motivated. It's because it's just trying to motivate for you

[18:03] I think it's a lot of people and I know that sounds a little foothoo

[18:05] But at the end of the day like the research the research, right? Like we are built this way or social creatures

[18:10] And it would make sense that people get applauded for

[18:14] Sheltering and protecting and serving the community and I think that that's so woven into our culture or most cultures that

[18:21] We're willing to do so much for it. I can tell you right now

[18:24] I absolutely can take more pain for laylet I can't from it and just replace layla with whatever that thing is that you love and so

[18:30] I want to I want to tell you the story because I think it's it's a parable that

[18:35] Really resonates deeply with me and it's similar to that Japanese man who who swoops the force

[18:40] Which is a traveler came upon three stone cutters working at a quarry and so he asked them what they were doing

[18:47] The first stone cutter replies I'm cutting stone. I'm exhausted. It's back-racking work. I'm miserable

[18:53] This he goes to the second stone cutter and he says, you know, what are you doing here? He says?

[18:58] I'm earning a living to support my family

[19:00] And you know cool you go to the third stone cutter and he says what are you doing?

[19:06] The third stone cutter smiles and he says I'm building a cathedral

[19:10] That's going to inspire people for generations that my grandchildren and their grandchildren are gonna be able to go to and worship our Lord and the thing is is that all three stone cutters

[19:21] All three med are doing the same work fundamentally having an entirely different experience of what that work means to them

[19:28] And so that same work that you do that right now might feel terrible can be a job that work can be a career or

[19:35] That work can be a calling

[19:37] Simply depending on your own perspective and so maybe

[19:41] Just do what the world wants that you're good at it and

[19:44] Then allow yourself the time to become passionate about it along the way as you get back and so passion happens as a consequence

[19:51] Not a requirement

[19:53] So if you're like that's all well and good Alex, but what do I do well big operationalization fan and so what do you do instead of following your passion?

[19:59] So here's a practical action oriented framework that will invert that advice into positive steps that aim can take

[20:05] Number one start with curiosity not passion so begin by exploring things that peak your interest even

[20:10] Logically all right just like duck worth research showed most big successful people didn't start with a burning passion

[20:15] They began with just simple curiosity that they were willing to investigate

[20:19] They were willing to follow up a different way of saying that is just something that you might be interested in

[20:23] Right the second is embrace the learning process

[20:26] So commit to developing the skills and competence first get good first recognize that mastery

[20:32] Proceeds passion getting good

[20:34] Proceeds enjoying it not the other way around and set skill specific

[20:39] Building goals rather than kind of waiting for motivation to strike because I promise you you're gonna wait for a long time

[20:44] Number three value your existing ability so assess what you're already good at and then consider building from there like warm-up

[20:50] It says look at the circle of competence

[20:52] Right focus on the areas of natural advantages some things you naturally have done more early on in your life

[20:58] Just do more of those things for commit to the deliberate process burn the boats and

[21:03] I define commitment as the elimination of alternatives meaning except that meaningful progress requires hard work and

[21:08] Fundamentals might not feel exciting right like Olympic athletes do so many repetitive drills like

[21:14] Phelps used to talk about eight hours of swimming. Can you imagine that just lap after lap after

[21:21] It just so many repetitions and just understand the excellence requires practice and the boring parts are included

[21:27] Five set realistic expectations so recognize that all work involves tedious aspects stuff that sucks right

[21:33] So instead of expecting constant enjoyment aim for overall

[21:37] Satisfaction in meaning just remember that even dream jobs like basis said have administrative tasks challenges

[21:43] They have overhead right they've stuffed the sucks. It's just part of a life six take the reality of money seriously

[21:49] Right like money will not bring you happiness, but it can help you avoid pain now

[21:54] I also have a little bit of a nugget on this which is that people do get happier up to a certain amount of money and then it stops

[22:02] Alex's theory on this spending money is a skill most people can only learn how to spend money up to here

[22:08] And then they don't learn how to spend it effectively

[22:10] I believe that money can continue to make you happier as you develop the skill of spending in a way that gets you better returns on

[22:15] In an intangible returns rather than tangible returns

[22:20] So if you have the if you have to pick between two different things follow the path that might have higher income earning

[22:26] If you're about even on both follow the money next

[22:30] Prioritize other environmental factors all right

[22:32] So if you want to change your life change your environment. I've said this a hundred times

[22:35] But if you want if you're like I'm really getting I'm struggling to do to do this

[22:38] You don't have to find this passion go to a place where other people are passionate about it

[22:42] All right that environment and if it's helpful create multiple feedback loops because all we're really looking back before here

[22:47] It's like just be very real is you just want to find a feedback loop

[22:50] That's all we're looking for you just want to find a place where you can do something and get someone that says that sucked that was terrible

[22:56] This is what you need to do better or different and so finding a place where you have supportive colleagues or you've got supportive people who are all kind of

[23:03] In pursuing the same thing all trying to get better that's the like it will change your life next

[23:08] Allow your passions to evolve

[23:10] So stay open to developing new interest throughout your life. You don't have to be stuck with one thing if you change your mind

[23:14] That's okay right your for you'll suffer like they have different passions than your 20 year old self

[23:18] It probably would find different people interesting at 40 as you do as 20 right and the world will also change to

[23:25] So having that flexibility is important and so committing to this one

[23:28] Passion forever it's it's it's too heavy of a decision. I think and so if you come into it saying this might change

[23:35] We'll allow you to take the first step because it's not this has to be the perfect pick

[23:39] I have to this has to be the one thing forever. It's like it's too big

[23:42] Right just shrink it down like alright. Well, I'm kind of interested in this for now

[23:46] So start right and then finally connect your work to serving others and I think this is arguably one of the biggest ones

[23:52] Just because there's so much research that supports it is that you just want to find ways on how you work

[23:56] But if it's other people you look at think about the stone counters right all three guys are in the same work

[24:00] One of them feels like so incredibly passionate about this because it's helping the world

[24:05] It's helping his family out and he's getting paid while he does it like and the crazy part is that all of them are doing the same work

[24:12] And so I think the easiest way to become passionate about what you do is to choose to become passionate about what you do

[24:20] And find a reason that's larger than yourself to pursue it and that passion and your ability to withstand the pain

[24:26] Because the pain now has purpose behind it rather than being meaningless and if you want to see a real person taking their passion and

[24:33] Then turning it into a you know monetized business

[24:36] I did this fool breakdown of a girl who's really into fashion and stylist stuff don't worry

[24:41] You have to be into that you can't look at what she did to monetize what she enjoyed and what we did to help her grow the business

## Full Transcript
[00:00] What's going on everyone? Alex Shmozi here, founder of Jim launch, Alan, Prestige Labs, and owner of a couple other companies.

[00:08] And today, I'm going to talk to you about how to sell some stuff.

[00:13] All right, so there's three types of questions.

[00:16] I think I've talked to other videos about how to structure your sales conversations.

[00:21] But I haven't talked to as much about the nature of the questions and the types of responses that you're getting, right?

[00:26] And so in a sales process, right, you have some questions that are going to be mining questions that's trying to extract information from the prospect.

[00:34] And the remainder of the questions are questions to get agreement, right?

[00:37] So you're going to put a proposition that they're going to ask for agreement, right?

[00:40] And if you get enough agreement, it's going to be natural that they're going to want to move forward working with you.

[00:44] Now, the way that you structure these questions, right?

[00:47] I'd say that you have yes-based questions, you have neutral questions,

[00:52] and then you have negatively inclined questions, right?

[00:55] First time I heard about this from Chris Voss, he's the guy who does the, you wrote the book, never spoke the difference.

[01:00] Really interesting stuff.

[01:02] And so a yes-based question would be like, sound great?

[01:06] Yes, that sounds great, right?

[01:08] A neutral type of question would be like, fair enough, is that sound fair?

[01:12] Is that sound reasonable to you?

[01:14] Right?

[01:15] They'd be like, well, that sounds reasonable.

[01:16] Now, it's still technically a yes-based question, but the question that we're asking has a neutral tone to it.

[01:21] All right, because we're not saying, hey, is this the most amazing thing you've ever heard of?

[01:25] Like, do you think this is the most amazing program, the amazing product, like blah, blah?

[01:29] That's asking a lot of someone, right, for them to agree to that.

[01:33] So that would be a harder yes to get.

[01:35] It's easier to get something like a reciprocal yes, which I would say someone says, you know, that's a lot,

[01:42] and we say, no worries, what if we did this fair enough?

[01:45] They say, well, he made a concession, that sounds fair,

[01:48] or if we did this, is that sound reasonable?

[01:50] That's not like a fair expectation.

[01:52] Yes, it does.

[01:53] Great, and then you can go to close the sale.

[01:55] And if you've heard any of my past sales stuff, one of my favorite closets, which I got from Jordan Buffert, is fair enough, right?

[02:01] I just love this close so much, because it's like fair enough, right?

[02:05] You make a concession fair enough, and so many times we were like, well, they made a concession in I'm a reciprocal human being.

[02:11] It's very hard for me to deny this request, and so yes, I do believe it's fair,

[02:14] and then you say, boom, then let's move forward, right?

[02:16] But this is one that I learned very recently that I really like, and I, when I look back through my actual conversations, I do this,

[02:23] and that's why I think it's so interesting, because I'm going to be, I'm going to be, I'm going to level with you really quickly.

[02:30] All the people that I know who teach sales are natural born salesmen, which is interesting, right?

[02:37] They're natural born salesmen. I don't know a lot of people who teach sales, who weren't naturally very good at it quickly.

[02:45] Right? And so there are some things that people naturally do because they've had a lot of experience doing it,

[02:51] and usually you get a lot of experience doing it because when you start doing it, you get enough success that you can, you can steam roll, right?

[02:57] And, and get a lot of volume, and then once you do lots of volume, then you come a master at it, but you get some sort of inclination or

[03:04] or proclivity towards the skill, right?

[03:06] That being said, it doesn't mean that anyone else can't become a great salesman. It just means you might have to have more reps to get there.

[03:13] Now, that being said, no base statements. This is actually where you go in opposition, right?

[03:19] And so the reason and the psychology behind this, per my understanding, and it makes completes sense to me at least,

[03:24] is that people feel safer saying, no. People feel like they retain their autonomy. They feel like they're at ease.

[03:31] It's harder, especially if you think about decision fatigue. At the end of the day, people don't want to be responsible or anything.

[03:35] They don't feel vulnerable to saying, yes, and agreeing to something, right?

[03:39] Instead, they prefer to say, no, and stay safe, right?

[03:42] But if you phrased your questions properly, you can get people to say yes by saying no, which is one of the most powerful sales taxes I've shared in a different video,

[03:50] where Richard Schwartz taught me how to get someone to say yes by saying, no, hey, you don't want anything else to you.

[03:55] No, I don't want anything else. And by doing that, they got 95% of people to take an upsell.

[03:59] All right? Now, no-based question. This is something like, would you be opposed to moving forward today?

[04:05] Would it be completely unreasonable for us to get started at the end of this conversation?

[04:09] Would it be a completely out-of-left field for me to say that we should start working together today?

[04:17] So, it's all of these, would you be opposed to, would you be against, would it be unreasonable, right?

[04:23] All of those things are no-based kind of anti-susti-tints or, sorry, precedents, that lead into a no-based question?

[04:31] And so, think about this. If I said, and I'm going to give you the same kind of scenario here, if I'm trying to get my wife to go where I want to go to dinner, right?

[04:40] Because I want to go to cheesecake factory, the finest establishment in the land, all right, count it, get the kitchen chicken little, so you can get a half-grolled and half-half-right,

[04:48] and get the sauces from the Thai lettuce wraps. Anyways, if I say, hey, babe, you want to go to cheesecake factory?

[04:55] She might be like, well, no, I don't want to go to cheesecake factory, right? Or like, I'm not really sure, right?

[05:01] Now, if I switched that and I said, babe, would you be against going to cheesecake factory?

[05:05] I'm like, well, I'm not against going to cheesecake factory, and I'm like, great, let's go.

[05:10] And so, that's the beauty of a no-based question. See how different it phrased, right?

[05:15] And if I say, hey, you excited to move forward today? That's a yes, right? It's harder to get someone to say yes, I'm excited to move forward today.

[05:20] Would you be opposed to moving forward at the end of the conversation? No, I'm not opposed to moving forward. Great, and we get to sale.

[05:26] And so, this is really interesting because, um, what I find, because there's lots of literature on, you know, getting people to say lots of yeses and chocolates,

[05:36] this is things like that throughout the sales process. But in my mind, these are all still ways of getting agreement, which is the goal.

[05:45] So, it's simply using psychology in terms of how people like to respond to things, how they feel in the moment of, you know, saying yes,

[05:53] means they feel vulnerable, saying no makes them feel safe, and leveraging that. Now, that being said, it doesn't mean every single question you have to ask has to be a no-based question.

[06:01] But I think if you, if you can rephrase a couple of the key milestone questions that you have in your sales conversations, or if you feel like you're kind of close to the edge with someone,

[06:10] leaning towards a no-based question, I think is something that natural salesmen do well automatically. Like is it done reasonable for us to move forward today?

[06:17] Right, would you be opposed to moving forward today? Would you be opposed to knocking out the paperwork? You'd be opposed to, um, are you against XYZ, right? Oh, no, I'm not against it. All right, let's rock and roll, right?

[06:27] All of these are still ways to get questions. And so I think that in some of my sales scripts right now, we're going to be shifting from fair enough clothes dive is so wired in my brain from doing it so many times,

[06:37] to some no-based phrasing, because it's easier to get agreement with prospects, especially even if they're kind of fatigue or at the end of the day, or which is when people are less likely to want to say yes to things.

[06:52] Counter-exemplar could be decision-futigated, just want to say yes to get done with it, right? Depends on the size of the purchase.

[06:58] But anyways, I hope this is valuable for you in terms of phrasing behind the questions. Obviously, this is not for mining based questions where you're trying to extract information from someone,

[07:07] and to better understand, this is really where you're trying to get agreements towards milestones to work together.

[07:13] All right, so I hope this made sense, keeping awesome, lots of love, and I'll catch you guys soon.

[07:17] Bye!

[00:00] What's going on everyone? I've got a fun topic today how to make a million dollars and so I know this is almost click-bitty

[00:06] But I want to

[00:08] Go over it mostly because it's like one of the no more questions I get all the time and so we might as well actually break down the math for you

[00:15] And so the no more in way that I know that someone has no chance and actually doing this to stay

[00:19] Don't even know the math behind how to accomplish their goals, right?

[00:22] And so that's what we're gonna break down today. All right, so the first thing is you have to know how many units of whatever it is

[00:27] You're selling to get to your goal, right?

[00:29] And the question is do you want to make a million dollars in revenue?

[00:31] Do you want to make a million dollars in take-a-min come mind you to be in the top one percent in America?

[00:35] That's 400,000 years, all right?

[00:37] And so let's say you have a business that run 40% net margins, which my view is very good

[00:42] If you run 40% net margins, that means if you made a million dollars in revenue you would make 400,000 dollars a year in net profit

[00:47] Well, you get to take owner pay right from your business, which is why by the way

[00:51] I think that having a job that pays well is very underrated

[00:56] I think it's just from being realistic if you look at the odds

[01:00] I think it's far far far more likely that you're gonna achieve a six-figure or multi-six-figure income

[01:08] Fast by having a really high paying job because you've acquired a skill

[01:11] Then trying to learn basically all the skills and own your own business. I'm just being candid and I think that if I knew

[01:17] The amount of risk that I was taking on when I started business

[01:20] I don't know if I would have done it again

[01:22] And I think that I had an atypical entrepreneurial journey because I wasn't really an entrepreneurial personality type

[01:27] I just really hated my job enough that I

[01:30] Was gonna do anything

[01:31] But that and so that's what started it, but let's get to that. Let's get to the mean the potatoes, all right

[01:36] So I want a ton of people having to even figure out their price point on things yet

[01:40] And so the easiest way to understand this is that if you have a million dollars a year, which is what you want to make

[01:45] Then you want to break this down, right?

[01:47] So a million dollars a year is gonna be 83k per month, all right roughly, right?

[01:51] It's 83333 whatever you could say 84k, but 83k per month, all right?

[01:55] That's what you have to make in

[01:57] Revenue right now if you break it down per day, I think it's the 33333 I think

[02:03] per day, but if you if you do it per week, so let's just break this into weekly

[02:06] It'd be like let's just say 21k, okay, so 21k per week all right

[02:11] And you'll notice I'm gonna keep breaking this down because it's really difficult to hit fuzzy targets

[02:15] So I heard this in Jason Flyland fuzzy targets don't get hit, right?

[02:18] So we need to make this a very precise clean pristine target all right?

[02:21] So we got a million dollars a year breaks down to 83k per month 21k per week

[02:26] Excuse me

[02:27] 21k per week and then from there

[02:30] You know seven seven days would be about 3k plus per day, right?

[02:33] So so that's that's how we know how we can get to that number now

[02:37] I like weeks because weeks are like normal cycles daily can be a little bit too volatile until you get to like 10 million plus per year

[02:44] And so if we're if we're talking starting out right 21k per week, all right

[02:49] So the thing is is we just have to know what the lifetime value of our customers and so let's say you're selling a single product that has no upsells

[02:56] All right, which is pretty common a single product that has no upsells

[02:59] Let's say your LTV is a thousand dollars, okay now I want to be really clear about this

[03:05] You don't have to sell a thousand dollar widget for this for the math that about to share with you to make sense

[03:10] All right, it just means that your total lifetime value of a customer is a thousand dollars like Starbucks

[03:14] I think their LTV is like eight thousand dollars and you're like holy cow

[03:17] Well think about how many times you purchase the Starbucks over the last you know 10 years, right?

[03:20] It adds up and so for me

[03:23] I'll give you a couple of different examples of what a thousand dollar LTV might be if I sold a course for a thousand dollars and I sold nothing else

[03:28] That would be a thousand dollar LTV if I sold a hundred dollar a month gym membership and the person on average stays ten months

[03:34] That would be a thousand dollar LTV if I sold let's say

[03:38] ah

[03:39] crap if I sold a

[03:41] Skincare products right in the average order value was you know 250 dollars and the average amount of time that's in which stayed on my

[03:47] Cream products was four months one thousand dollars is my LTV, okay?

[03:50] So these are all different ways of achieving a thousand dollar LTV which makes this hopefully a little bit simpler now

[03:56] If I have to get to a million dollars then I need to sell 21 units per week, right?

[04:02] And so that would be 21 divided by a thousand just 21 right units per week to hit our

[04:07] Gole and so if I know that I only really sell five days a week money through Friday, right?

[04:11] Then it means I got to sell four or maybe five I'd probably make five my goal so I overshoot it a little bit

[04:16] So I got to sell five deals a day, right?

[04:20] And five five deals a day and the nice thing is with this process that I'm walking you through right now

[04:24] Like you can add as many zeros as you want it works the same way right?

[04:26] You can add zero to your product zero to your goal like everything works the same way

[04:30] So it's five deals a day is what I have to close now the thing is is I may know my math

[04:34] Right and know that five deals a day we close let's say one out of three deal one out of three phone calls

[04:39] Which means I'm gonna do 15 phone calls a day who show up right?

[04:45] And now if I'm selling products and it might be based on second version

[04:48] So if I've like you know 1% conversion on my store and he commerce store for example

[04:52] Then I would need a hundred times the amount of sales I need right so if I need five quote sales per day with

[04:59] The life and the value of a thousand and I know that it takes a hundred clicks to get one

[05:04] Purchase then I need 500 clicks a day. Hopefully that makes sense here

[05:07] But I'm just walking through a more a more service based sale because it was top of my all right

[05:11] So 15 calls right per day and let's say that I know my shop right on these calls is you know 66% so I have 22

[05:19] Set-up points per day right

[05:22] And the thing is is I know that based on my either outreach efforts it takes let's say

[05:29] I don't know 50 outreach efforts to get one appointment. I need a thousand outreach efforts a day right now

[05:33] Mind you a thousand dollar deal would not be worth any kind of effort like that so I because this is way way too low to have kind of like a hand-to-hand combat

[05:41] sale type type system

[05:43] This would probably need to be close to like ten thousand dollars and then there you go you get your 10 million

[05:49] But but I'm using this just to illustrate like the different ways to get there right and so

[05:54] A nice thing to think about this is that if you if you take out if you take this little number here

[05:59] Your deal size right and you put that is the main variable for this process, right?

[06:03] You could either sell you know nine

[06:07] 10 k deals

[06:09] per month and have a million dollar business

[06:12] Wow right you could sell one hundred k deal

[06:18] per month to have a million dollar business

[06:21] That sounds pretty chill you could also sell a hundred or roughly, you know 83 right

[06:27] One k deals per month that sounds a little harder, right or if you have hundred dollar widgets you got to sell

[06:35] God eight hundred and thirty right or 33 whatever it is times a hundred dollars per per month to hit that

[06:42] 83k right it's so you can kind of see how much harder it gets the lower the prices like it's

[06:48] It's it's hard to sell eight hundred and 33 things every month. I mean that's that's a lot of work

[06:52] Right and honestly it's hard to sell 83 things a month selling nine easier, right and so it's been and this is just the conclusion that I've made throughout my life

[07:01] Is that especially when you're starting out

[07:03] I think it's easier to start with premium things as in like it's easier to just over deliver like crazy for a client

[07:08] Rather than trying to think about like how do I make this scalable so you don't need to worry about that yet like you need to just start making money

[07:14] Right and so it's like how can I just how can I how can I find a sweet spot in here right this like

[07:18] 5,000 10,000,000,000 more

[07:20] How can I find a sweet spot in here where I can just provide tremendous value to someone?

[07:23] That they will want to continue to do services with me and I

[07:27] Don't have to have a tremendous amount of operational skill because the reason that this is so hard for people

[07:31] This hundred dollar month or even ten dollar month range is it's the operations behind it

[07:35] You have to be able to support so much volume

[07:38] That you're very good with people and that's a totally different skill than learning how to market and sell in a car customers

[07:43] And so this is where I think most people kind of run into trouble and why a lot of people who end up making more money earlier

[07:48] Kind of focus on this on this upper side of the latter

[07:51] There's a very very very few exceptions to people who

[07:54] Make a lot of money like super super rare make a lot of money below this thousand dollar

[07:59] You know per unit price tag right like you have to find a way to get your LTV higher because it's just too hard

[08:05] Like a choir customers just just too difficult to not have a high LTV and like like I said Starbucks right

[08:10] Eight thousand LTV so it doesn't have to be your ticket price that has to be low

[08:13] It's just like you have to find ways to make customers worth more right unique expensive sticky

[08:19] Air if you remember that from before having for me something that they were gonna continue to come back again and again and again

[08:23] So any of

[08:25] How to make a million dollars. I think most people do not do this math on this

[08:28] Which is you got to make twenty one thousand dollars a week and then there's a zillion ways to make twenty one thousand

[08:33] One's week right you can sell hundred all units you can sell thousand all units you can sell ten thousand all units because a hundred thousand all units

[08:38] But at the end of the day that is how you do it and if you think about this from a sales professional

[08:42] Stand point some I'll break this down for you guys as a bonus because I know a lot of sales people fall or stuff

[08:48] Make this whatever your product is your commission right so if you want to make a million dollars

[08:52] Geals a sales person right then you're gonna need a sell like it and let's say you get a thousand our commission

[08:57] Then you need them sell 83 units a month of your thing right now. I mean sound crazy and that it is because that's why you know

[09:03] That's why the top one percent is you know half of that

[09:07] In terms of income right and so but if you can if you can figure out that a thousand dollars

[09:12] You know if you can get your like you should be able to think in your mind like this is my income goals the sales person

[09:17] This is what I would like to make is the amount of calls, you know or it calls taken

[09:21] Required to hit this goal reasonable right because on some level every every position has a cap based on time

[09:28] Right how much how much time you can allocate right there's only twenty four hours in a day and so

[09:32] And who reverse the math on your own business in your own

[09:36] Products that you're selling and a lot of times this will help you get your old-zloff faster

[09:40] So anyway keeping awesome lots of love and I could you guys soon bye

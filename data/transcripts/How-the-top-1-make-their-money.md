[00:00] The majority of millionaires are made in real estate.

[00:02] The majority of billionaires are made in private equity.

[00:05] And the point of this video is to walk you through

[00:07] the money-making process that they use

[00:09] to make tons and tons of money for themselves,

[00:11] tons and tons of money for their investors,

[00:12] and most importantly, accelerate value in a business.

[00:14] So let's walk through an example

[00:16] that everyone probably understands.

[00:18] So if you were to buy a house

[00:19] and you wanted to use this as a real estate investment,

[00:21] then you make money on this in two main ways.

[00:25] One is that the value of the house goes up,

[00:27] so let's say it's worth one million,

[00:28] it becomes worth two million.

[00:30] Great, we had appreciation.

[00:31] The other is that you get checks for $1,000 a month

[00:35] from the tenants.

[00:36] But the point is that you're gonna get paid every month

[00:38] for some sort of production from a renter

[00:40] and the house is gonna up to value.

[00:41] Now if you just did your own house,

[00:42] then you're just not paying this,

[00:44] or you're just paying the bank for your mortgage

[00:45] and whatnot,

[00:46] and you're pretty much just gonna make your money

[00:47] in appreciation.

[00:48] There are some things that you can have appreciation

[00:50] that just happens over time.

[00:51] The other is just kind of forced appreciation,

[00:53] which is where you fix the stuff,

[00:56] you clean the windows,

[00:57] you add a kitchen,

[00:58] you do work, right?

[01:00] And then it increases the value of the thing

[01:02] because somebody else might be more likely

[01:04] to pay for it or buy it.

[01:05] Very, very simple.

[01:07] Now the thing about real estate

[01:09] and why I think it makes so many millionaires,

[01:11] it's a really simple business model.

[01:13] Like you buy the house,

[01:15] you put a certain amount down,

[01:16] you take a loan for the rest,

[01:17] as long as you put a tenant in that can cover that.

[01:19] Now, I'm obviously simplifying this,

[01:21] but that's because that's the point.

[01:22] I'm simplifying it for the point of a video.

[01:24] So many of people have lost their asses

[01:25] in real estate,

[01:26] but because it is a reliable thing,

[01:28] they're not making any more land

[01:29] and they do keep making more people over time,

[01:31] as long as population growth continues,

[01:34] real estate will be really good investment.

[01:35] Okay, now that is a big fucking asterisk

[01:37] because of how population growth has been happening.

[01:39] Look at your pan's real estate market, for example,

[01:41] because their population has declined,

[01:43] we take some of these things to be true.

[01:44] We assume that humans are gonna always have more humans,

[01:46] but that's not always the case.

[01:48] Okay, now our second example is,

[01:51] let's say that we have a business.

[01:52] So let's see if I can make a really simple business,

[01:55] or a friend.

[01:56] All right, we'll make that my little business,

[01:58] or a friend.

[01:59] All right, is that kind of a business, see?

[02:00] No.

[02:01] All right, there's my business.

[02:02] You don't like my drawing deal with it.

[02:05] So the interesting thing with private equity

[02:07] is that there's more ways that you can make money.

[02:10] Number one is you can buy businesses with a much wider range.

[02:15] Like a house isn't gonna go for sale for a dollar,

[02:18] but businesses do sometimes get given away

[02:21] for free more or less.

[02:23] And that's also because there's no debt.

[02:24] A lot of times you go by houses,

[02:25] they have debts that they have to pay back.

[02:27] And that kind of fixes pretty hard core

[02:29] where people's kind of bottom is.

[02:31] They're like, I'm not gonna lose money on my house.

[02:32] Like, fine, I won't make money,

[02:34] but you have to at least pay the bank back.

[02:35] Of course, the market still decates prices,

[02:37] but I think there's still a strong line

[02:39] that people will hold in negotiations,

[02:41] which slows down crashes in real estate.

[02:45] Whereas a business can go from being not valuable at all,

[02:48] to 12 months later, being worth hundreds of millions

[02:50] of dollars, let's say it's a technology,

[02:51] or let's say it's a patent that goes through,

[02:53] or some sort of pharmaceutical thing.

[02:54] I'm giving you extreme examples

[02:56] because you're like, wait a second,

[02:57] how's this apply to my business?

[02:58] Well, if you didn't have a way to reliably get customers,

[03:01] and then all of a sudden you find a channel

[03:03] that reliably brings you customers,

[03:04] that makes something that isn't valuable, incredibly valuable.

[03:07] Or you hire one key person in the business

[03:09] that expands a new territory for you,

[03:11] makes something that was once a risk.

[03:13] And the thing is, is that a lot of times,

[03:15] businesses accelerate in value,

[03:17] kind of like the forced appreciation,

[03:18] you're gonna build in a kitchen,

[03:19] you build in a bathtub or something.

[03:21] The forced appreciation in business,

[03:23] sometimes takes a negative and then turns it into a positive.

[03:26] And so what was once a risk,

[03:28] then becomes a pillar of value.

[03:31] And so when you're thinking about accelerating value

[03:34] in a business and this is what we do at acquisition.com

[03:36] is that we think through what are all of the negatives,

[03:39] what are all of the risks associated with this business?

[03:41] And then if one by one we can flip the risks

[03:44] into pillars of value,

[03:47] then we get, we kind of get counted twice.

[03:50] So instead of a negative discount on our value,

[03:51] it becomes a pro and adds to that multiple.

[03:54] And so this is kind of the big difference

[03:56] with private equity versus the house, right?

[03:59] With a house, you can't change the neighborhood,

[04:01] maybe the neighborhood can slowly change over time,

[04:03] but you can't take it and then put it in Manhattan, right?

[04:05] It's just gonna be where it's gonna be.

[04:06] You can fix a couple things.

[04:07] So there's kind of an upside limit to real estate.

[04:10] You're not gonna get a hundred X deal in real estate.

[04:13] You can get a hundred X deal in private equity all the time.

[04:17] And that's why the people who amassed fortunes,

[04:19] the richest people in the world,

[04:21] know how to reliably create 10X 50X type returns.

[04:26] And at least in their careers,

[04:27] especially the best ones,

[04:28] have had multiple of these 20X's 50X's in big, big bets.

[04:33] And so let me walk you through

[04:35] how they would actually happen.

[04:36] So let's see, you've got a business that's doing

[04:39] three million bucks a year, right?

[04:41] And let's say it's doing one million dollars in profit.

[04:43] This business is not gonna be valuable,

[04:45] like not that valuable, all right?

[04:47] So no institutional investors can one buy this,

[04:49] it's too small.

[04:50] I mean, it makes money, maybe it requires the founder,

[04:53] so there's key man risk,

[04:54] there's not a bunch of other things,

[04:55] but like fundamentally,

[04:56] this isn't gonna be a super attractive business.

[04:58] Now, a retail investor,

[04:59] meaning like some doctor or lawyer who's local,

[05:01] might want to buy this business,

[05:03] says a retirement asset for themselves,

[05:05] not knowing what the fuck they're doing,

[05:07] and then lose their asses.

[05:08] So someone could give you money for it

[05:10] because they don't know what they're doing,

[05:11] but it doesn't mean that it's actually worth anything.

[05:12] It just means that you pull and win over on someone, all right?

[05:15] So the thing is that a good private equity investor

[05:17] realizes that this is not worth much to a potential acquired

[05:22] today, but could become very valuable

[05:24] with a few small moves.

[05:26] And so all of a sudden, this business

[05:28] starts doing, let's say, $12 million a year,

[05:31] which would be a million dollars a month,

[05:32] and then it gets to somewhere in the neighborhood

[05:34] of, call it, $5 million in profit.

[05:36] Okay, this is now a much, much more valuable business.

[05:41] And so here's, this is the magic, this is how it works.

[05:45] Is that you could pick this up for almost $0.

[05:49] You wouldn't have to pay a lot to get a business

[05:51] that doesn't million dollars in profit.

[05:52] It's been to you, you are, but fundamentally like,

[05:54] you might do some seller financing,

[05:56] put some money, a little bit of cash in,

[05:58] just a million dollars a year profit,

[05:59] you might put 500 grand down, like,

[06:00] as a show of good faith.

[06:01] The thing is, this thing's riddled with risk, right?

[06:04] A $3 million dollar top-by-business probably has,

[06:06] I don't know, 10, 15 employees, like, not a lot of people.

[06:08] And so it's not very reliable, it's very volatile.

[06:11] And so it just screams risk.

[06:13] And so risk means, fundamentally, the multiple

[06:17] that you ascribe to a business's profits

[06:20] is a direct correlation to the risk you ascribe to the business.

[06:25] So saying that in the opposite way

[06:27] is how likely you think it will continue to make money

[06:31] if nothing happened.

[06:33] And so if the owner leaves that's a material change

[06:36] to the business, how long do I think this business

[06:38] will keep making money when this person leaves?

[06:40] If I think it's absolutely guaranteed,

[06:42] there's no way this business doesn't make money,

[06:44] even after the person leaves,

[06:45] then he's going to get a high multiple in the business.

[06:48] His revenue and profit are very valuable

[06:50] because they're really secure.

[06:51] On the other hand, if it's like,

[06:53] I think this could maybe burn down in six months,

[06:55] then it might get a 0.5 multiple, or it just realistically,

[06:59] a zero multiple in the business saying,

[07:00] I'll just take it over for you.

[07:01] I'll take it off your hands for you, right?

[07:04] Now, the thing is, is that sometimes the difference

[07:07] between these things doesn't actually take a ton of work.

[07:10] It takes some expertise, but like,

[07:11] not necessarily a lot of time.

[07:13] And so if companies doing these numbers,

[07:14] it's like, all right, we'll probably need to hire CEO,

[07:17] we need our CEO, probably need to have

[07:19] bringing some sort of director of marketing

[07:21] to run some of the day-to-day for it.

[07:24] We probably need to update sales ops in the business.

[07:28] We'll probably update pricing

[07:29] because they're probably mispriced, right?

[07:32] And because we update pricing,

[07:33] we can now spend more in marketing,

[07:35] which gets us more sales, right?

[07:36] And we just, we run that little Kim,

[07:38] but sometimes something like this can happen

[07:40] and like, oh, 12 to 24 months,

[07:42] not a very long time in terms of time periods.

[07:45] But here's the crazy part.

[07:46] Here's the crazy part.

[07:48] This business is basically worth nothing.

[07:52] This business, and let's say that it's moderately risky.

[07:55] So it's not, it's not like this is not a bank,

[07:57] but it's like they're probably not gonna go out of business.

[07:59] And I've been going to cover that.

[08:00] But like 95% of banks, banks are actually very,

[08:02] very stable business and they make a lot of money.

[08:05] We more restaurants go out of business than banks.

[08:07] I was put it that way.

[08:07] All right, but let's say that this business

[08:09] gets an eight X multiple,

[08:11] and this would be a $40 million business, okay?

[08:16] So in what world do you know that you can go from something

[08:20] that costs you no money to 12 to 24 months later

[08:23] having something that's worth $40 million.

[08:27] Not many.

[08:28] And so fundamentally this arbitrage

[08:30] that exists here, because it doesn't take many steps

[08:34] or much time to create huge step ups and value,

[08:37] that is where private equity investors make their buddy.

[08:41] This is where business owners who know

[08:43] how to play the game get filthy rich.

[08:46] And the thing is is that a lot of people

[08:48] are just very intimidated by this word and these concepts,

[08:52] but this is all it comes down to.

[08:54] Is that 99% of transactions are gonna be

[08:56] some sort of multiple?

[08:59] When I say multiple of EBITDA,

[09:00] EBITDA is just a fancy word for right now

[09:02] just called profit, but in the private equity,

[09:03] it's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,

[09:06] and amortization.

[09:07] It's just that earnings before,

[09:09] this is the part that matters earnings.

[09:10] How much money you make before all this other stuff?

[09:13] So if you've made money and then you get taxed

[09:15] in different different states,

[09:17] would you say the business is worth more life?

[09:19] Why can't you incorporate it in different states?

[09:20] Okay, well then I wanna know the earnings before the taxes, right?

[09:23] Well, I just bought this piece of equipment

[09:25] and like if I didn't buy the piece of equipment,

[09:28] we'd have more profit, cool.

[09:29] Well then I want the earnings before

[09:31] the depreciation that you're gonna apply, right?

[09:32] That's the idea here, okay?

[09:34] And so that means that there's two big variables

[09:38] that we can influence with a business, the multiple,

[09:42] and the EBITDA.

[09:44] So basically, if we can increase how much profit

[09:47] a company makes and how reliable that profit is

[09:56] and growing,

[10:00] then we're gonna get a higher multiple.

[10:03] All right, and so let's say we have two businesses.

[10:08] All right, we'll say two businesses.

[10:10] Business number one, let's say they're both the same size.

[10:13] Let's say they're $10 million in top line revenue

[10:18] and say we're $3 million in profit.

[10:21] So let's say we have two identical businesses here.

[10:24] This business is purely transactional,

[10:27] meaning it's one-off transactions,

[10:29] there's no recurring revenue,

[10:30] there's no annual revenue retention.

[10:32] It has one way of getting customers.

[10:34] It has a founder who's interagually involved

[10:36] in delivery and marketing and operations.

[10:39] So all three aspects of the business.

[10:40] So running the day to day,

[10:41] the running make you for the products good

[10:43] and making sure we're getting more customers.

[10:44] So one guy's involved in all of it

[10:46] and they're going down.

[10:47] They used to do $20 million and six

[10:49] and now they're at $10 million in three.

[10:51] All right, so this is our $10 million business.

[10:53] So is this growing?

[10:55] No, would you say that this is reliable in the future

[10:58] that it's going to continue to happen?

[11:00] Well, the thing is it said, this business is basically

[11:03] unselable.

[11:05] Like it's not that it's worth nothing.

[11:07] It's just that it's worth nothing to someone

[11:09] on the outside.

[11:10] The thing is to the guy on the inside

[11:12] he's making $3 million a year,

[11:13] there's value to the business.

[11:14] There's just not value to anybody else.

[11:16] It's that's the key here is that when you're thinking

[11:18] about building the business,

[11:19] it's I want to make this viable for anyone,

[11:22] not just valuable for me.

[11:23] So if you own a barber shop

[11:25] and you make $2 million here from your barber shop

[11:26] but you're involved in the day day,

[11:27] there's nothing wrong with that.

[11:28] I mean, you're meant to work or I'm meant to work, right?

[11:30] But it's just that I have been built

[11:32] so that it can be worth $2,000 here to somebody else.

[11:35] If you can build it like that,

[11:36] then now you own an asset that has intrinsic value

[11:38] to the marketplace.

[11:40] Now let's go through this other one.

[11:42] So this one, this guy's worth $0.

[11:44] I don't know what that was fair.

[11:45] This is worth $0.

[11:47] Unselable to this guy.

[11:50] So this one last year they did $5 million.

[11:51] And this year they did $10 million.

[11:52] And they're pasting $20 million for this upcoming year.

[11:55] They'll do $3 million this year,

[11:56] but they'll probably do $6 million or $7 million next year.

[11:59] It's all annual recurring revenue.

[12:01] We think that the margins are going to expand

[12:03] as they get better because they're going to have economies of scale.

[12:06] And so we've got profits going up.

[12:07] We don't think the market's going anywhere.

[12:09] It looks reliable and it's growing.

[12:11] Well, this thing might get a 12x multiple.

[12:15] And so then this thing might be worth $36 million.

[12:18] And so then you're like, wait, how can these two businesses

[12:21] with the same size and the same profit worth

[12:23] such dramatically different amounts?

[12:24] Because fundamentals of value creation.

[12:27] How reliable is this money that I'm going to be making?

[12:30] And how much of it is there?

[12:32] So if you have a lot that's not reliable,

[12:34] then you're going to get a small multiple in a big number.

[12:37] If you have a small amount of profit, but it's super reliable

[12:40] in this growing, then you're going to get a big multiple

[12:43] on a small number.

[12:44] And if you've got a ton of profit,

[12:45] and it's super reliable and grown really fast,

[12:47] then you're going to get a monster multiple.

[12:49] Like fundamentally, that's it.

[12:51] That's how it works.

[12:52] And so here's one of the other big things

[12:53] that people don't get with private equity

[12:55] is that with a house,

[12:56] you can't build a house to a scratch.

[12:58] I mean, you can build a house to a scratch,

[13:00] but it's going to cost you money.

[13:01] But a business, you can start with nowadays,

[13:04] almost nothing.

[13:04] You can start selling your time,

[13:06] and you start making some money,

[13:07] and start paying other people all off cash flow

[13:08] in the business, which the business can start for free.

[13:11] And so you can have something that literally cost you $0,

[13:15] that becomes worth billions.

[13:18] And there is no piece of real estate on earth

[13:21] that you can build for $0, and then it will someday be worth billions.

[13:26] And so the reason that private equity makes more money

[13:29] than real estate at the highest levels

[13:31] is because it requires more skill,

[13:34] because there are more skills required in order to do it.

[13:36] Now to be fair, this is in some ways,

[13:38] just as strong as an advocate of real estate

[13:40] is that it's a simpler business model.

[13:41] And people still lose money in real estate all the time,

[13:43] just got to look at the forms.

[13:45] People lose money all the time in it,

[13:46] ran real estate when they get greedy.

[13:47] But in terms of reliably giving people returns

[13:51] over years and years and years,

[13:52] it has worked provided population continues to grow.

[13:55] So if you are going to buy real estate,

[13:56] try and buy it in areas where people are continuing

[13:58] to either move to or have more kids.

[14:00] So fundamentally, there's only three ways

[14:03] that you make money in a business,

[14:04] or make a business more valuable.

[14:05] Number one is you increase the number of customers.

[14:09] Number two is you increase their value,

[14:14] which I'll just say is LTV or LTP depending on you say,

[14:18] which is how much they pay you over time.

[14:20] Third is decreasing risk, right?

[14:22] Which is increasing the reliability of the business over time.

[14:27] And so whenever you're allocating money or time

[14:31] in your business, it has to circle up to,

[14:33] this is gonna get me more customers.

[14:35] This is gonna make them worth more,

[14:36] or this is somehow gonna decrease risk.

[14:37] And if you can't very clearly state how you know

[14:39] it's gonna get you customers, how you know

[14:41] it's gonna make them worth more, how you know,

[14:43] it's gonna decrease risk.

[14:44] Then you have to ask yourself,

[14:45] is this the best use of my time money and effort?

[14:49] And this is where I think most people do this instead,

[14:51] is that they then spend money on stuff that's worth nothing.

[14:55] And that's why a lot of people don't get rich when they try to.

[14:57] It's that they don't know where value gets created.

[15:00] And so you either have to make more money,

[15:01] or you have to make the reliability of that money more valuable.

[15:04] And you make money by getting more customers

[15:05] making the worth more, and then you decrease the risk

[15:07] is so city with that in the future.

[15:09] So you're like, okay, well, I want,

[15:10] I want to have that big amount of profit,

[15:12] but I want a massive multiple associated with my business.

[15:15] So let me just give you a couple of kind of like

[15:16] the big, legal ways that people think about this.

[15:19] Accusure.com is a family off

[15:20] that functions like a private equity firm.

[15:22] And we look at lots of different businesses.

[15:24] And one of the easiest ways that we have

[15:26] for companies to get into the portfolio

[15:27] is that we can meet you at one of our workshops.

[15:29] And so we run workshops occasionally at our headquarters

[15:32] here in Vegas.

[15:33] And so if that sounds interesting, my team will be there.

[15:35] We can give you a whole bunch of things

[15:36] that you can do to make your company more valuable.

[15:38] And maybe someday become a portfolio company.

[15:40] In the meantime, go there, acquiesa.com, click scale,

[15:43] and maybe we'll see you here.

[15:44] So number one is how much debt your company that looks like pet doesn't it?

[15:48] How much debt your business can carry.

[15:50] And so that's going to be a function of cash flow.

[15:53] And so if you have a lot of cash flow,

[15:54] meaning that you can take distributions in huge amounts every month,

[15:57] that means that your business can support a lot of cash

[15:59] loach means it can support a lot of debt.

[16:01] So unlike with your first home, there's

[16:03] like these fixed amounts that banks will say,

[16:05] you have to put 20% down.

[16:06] And if it's commercial real estate,

[16:07] you have to put 35% down, whatever it is.

[16:08] They're these fixed amounts that they say,

[16:10] you have to put down in order to limit their risk.

[16:13] The thing is that with businesses,

[16:15] it's varied based on how much cash flow business has.

[16:18] And so a business that has almost no cash flow,

[16:21] like it's going to be able to take on almost no debt.

[16:22] And when it has tons of cash flow,

[16:24] it can take on tons of debt.

[16:25] And it just proportionate amount.

[16:27] The second thing is organic growth.

[16:29] So this is the stuff that I teach on this channel,

[16:31] which is marketing, sales, pricing, all these things

[16:34] that we do.

[16:35] This is all considered organic growth.

[16:37] Anorganic growth is when you buy

[16:38] their company's northered growth, you combine balance sheets.

[16:40] But if you are growing as a business,

[16:42] that's going to give you a bigger lever on your multiple.

[16:44] Meaning you're going to get more for it.

[16:46] Because if they know, or they believe

[16:48] that you're going to consistently grow 20% a year,

[16:51] no matter what for the next five years,

[16:52] then they know that the business is going to double

[16:54] in five years.

[16:54] So if they did nothing, they're going to more than double

[16:57] their money because they're not going to buy 100% with cash.

[17:00] They're going to buy it with debt.

[17:01] So if you double a business and you

[17:02] but 20% down, then you could four acts

[17:05] or five extra money on the business

[17:07] because of the leverage that debt gives you.

[17:09] This is all why these multiple levers increase

[17:12] how much you get paid.

[17:13] So the third one is categorization,

[17:15] which is probably for literacy here.

[17:16] If you were a business that is categorized as,

[17:20] let's say, a traditional service business, right?

[17:23] But you're able to build some technology

[17:25] into your business that allows your staff

[17:28] to get 10 times more done or him 10 times the customers,

[17:31] then you have something that would be called

[17:33] tech and able service, right?

[17:34] Or sometimes even a true SaaS business.

[17:37] And so tech and able services have higher multiples

[17:40] than traditional services and SaaS companies

[17:43] have higher multiples than tech and able services.

[17:46] And so how you categorize the business,

[17:48] if it's just moving one step over, which is,

[17:50] okay, let's just look at our delivery,

[17:52] let's just invest in a little bit of technology

[17:54] so that we can get categorized differently.

[17:56] It might cost you 100 grand to get some streamlined processes

[18:00] and tech and place to have five x 10x the delivery.

[18:02] And if that's the case, then you got a $100,000 investment

[18:07] that might give you three more turns on your multiple,

[18:09] three more turns being like you go from a five

[18:11] multiple to an eight multiple.

[18:12] And let's see, you make a million dollars a year.

[18:14] It's like, well, that had $3 million to your enterprise value

[18:17] for a hundred grand.

[18:18] It's a 30x return.

[18:19] So like, that's just how you have to start thinking about it

[18:20] within the business.

[18:21] It's like, oh, this is totally worth it.

[18:23] So should I take this $100,000, put it in my pocket

[18:25] and then put it in the S&P 500?

[18:26] Well, if you're a business owner,

[18:27] you can put it right back into the business

[18:28] in a way that you know you're gonna get a good

[18:30] return on capital.

[18:31] So categorizing what type of business your business is really in.

[18:35] Next one is a size premium.

[18:37] So this is when that a lot of people don't understand.

[18:38] When you buy wholesale and your real life,

[18:42] if you buy one roll of toilet paper or you buy 20 rolls of toilet paper,

[18:45] the 20 rolls of toilet paper gonna be cheaper

[18:47] because you bought both, you bought wholesale, right?

[18:49] Businesses are actually the opposite.

[18:51] If you put a ton of profits together,

[18:53] you get a size premium.

[18:55] So a business that does $100 million a year in profit

[18:58] is worth a hell of a lot more

[19:00] than a company that does 100,000 dollars a year in profit.

[19:02] And a big part of that, believe it or not,

[19:05] is that the people who have the most money in the world

[19:07] have so much money.

[19:08] And this is very hard for like,

[19:10] you'd probably grasp if you're not familiar with this.

[19:12] But like the people at the top, black rock, black stone,

[19:16] you know, like all the, all the big guys, all right,

[19:18] stage street, all that stuff.

[19:20] They have so much money that they have minimum check sizes.

[19:24] So I was talking to a friend of mine and one of the banks,

[19:28] I'll just put it that way.

[19:29] And their minimum check size now is 150 million.

[19:32] So not enterprise value.

[19:34] That's just the minimum.

[19:35] So if you have a $300 million company,

[19:37] they have to buy at least half or they're not interested.

[19:40] Because they need to be able to write checks of 150 million

[19:42] or greater because they have so much money

[19:45] that they can't waste time writing checks smaller than that.

[19:48] And so they pay a premium for operators to go and gather

[19:52] a bunch of assets together so they can write one check.

[19:55] I know this sounds insane,

[19:57] but this is how people make gobs of money

[20:00] is understanding this other world.

[20:02] And so this is why people are like, man,

[20:05] I've got, you know, key man risk in my business.

[20:07] And like, dude, you make a million dollars a year,

[20:08] of course you have key man risk.

[20:09] It's a tiny business.

[20:11] Like, this isn't where you solve that.

[20:12] We solve that when you're at,

[20:14] once you get to an institutional level,

[20:15] which by the way is about five million in profit per year,

[20:18] is where institutional investors

[20:20] like begin to really take notice of a business.

[20:22] Below that, you're not really gonna get much.

[20:25] And at the five million mark,

[20:26] you might get somewhere in the neighborhood of like 25 to 40,

[20:29] somewhere in there,

[20:30] but like if you cross 10 million,

[20:32] it gives you a size premium, you get a little bit more.

[20:34] On the multiple.

[20:35] So not only do you have a bigger amount of profit,

[20:37] you also get more for that profit.

[20:39] So it's like a double multiplier effect.

[20:41] And this is why people talk about patients all the time.

[20:42] It's like, you could sell today for 25,

[20:45] but maybe if you waited a year

[20:47] and got your five million to eight million in profit.

[20:50] And you've short up a couple things,

[20:52] you go from having a $25 million sale

[20:54] to a $75 million sale for one more year of work.

[20:57] So $50 million of enterprise value,

[21:00] three X, what you would have gotten paid for one more year of work.

[21:03] And this is how that compounding

[21:06] unlocks these huge numbers in private equity.

[21:08] E is age.

[21:10] So to further on my little speech there on patients,

[21:17] the age of the business also makes a business more viable.

[21:20] And so I think about this way.

[21:21] Imagine there's a business that's one year old

[21:23] that's doing these numbers.

[21:23] And then a business that's 10 years old

[21:25] and doing these numbers.

[21:26] Well, you'll probably feel more confident

[21:28] by in the 10 year old business

[21:29] because you're like, it's been around for 10 years.

[21:30] Like it's not going anywhere.

[21:32] The ministry partner, if you just said this to me

[21:34] and I never forgot,

[21:34] and he said a business always becomes more valuable

[21:37] every single year until it doesn't

[21:39] and then it's worth nothing.

[21:41] And you're such a profound statement,

[21:43] which is basically like, as long as you keep growing,

[21:46] no matter how slowly or even maintain

[21:50] and the business stays around,

[21:52] the business is more valuable.

[21:53] So 10 million dollar business at your five

[21:55] and then 10 million dollar,

[21:56] your six, it's a little bit more valuable at your six

[21:59] because it lived another year.

[22:00] But the moment it goes down a little,

[22:03] it's worth nothing

[22:04] because no one wants to touch it unless you have

[22:06] to stress to asset experts

[22:07] and I'm not going to get into that.

[22:08] And so when you're thinking about your business,

[22:11] it's like, okay, I would have created lots of cash flow

[22:14] in my business.

[22:14] I want to have lots of work in a growth.

[22:16] I want to grow on a sell more.

[22:17] I want to market more.

[22:18] I want to make sure that my price is good.

[22:20] I want to get efficiencies within my organization

[22:22] so that I can get categorized as a better type of business

[22:25] to has generally higher multiples.

[22:27] I want to get it big enough

[22:29] that I get a size premium so that I get more

[22:32] for each dollar profit in terms of enterprise value.

[22:35] And I want to keep doing this for a long time.

[22:37] And if I do all this stuff,

[22:38] I can make generational wealth in a number of years.

[22:41] And so no, this is not the get rich in six weeks stuff.

[22:44] This is like get rich in six years, it's.

[22:48] But the thing is, six years at least for me now

[22:50] is not that long.

[22:52] Six years is not that long.

[22:53] Like you're still pretty much,

[22:54] you're in the same decade that you're early in.

[22:56] And so when I think about that,

[22:58] I'm like most people simply can't wait six months

[23:02] for anything.

[23:03] And I was telling one of the business owners

[23:05] here the other day about this is like,

[23:07] the woman that redress, I talk about it all the time

[23:10] because it's been the hardest thing

[23:12] that I struggle with my entrepreneur for all the things

[23:14] that's been the hardest.

[23:15] And once you stick with something for five years,

[23:19] you get it.

[23:20] You're like, oh, I understand now.

[23:22] Now it's not just saying you had a business for five years

[23:24] because some of you guys are fucking looking at you.

[23:26] Do six other things all the time

[23:28] and you have the one business that makes you money

[23:29] and you never paid all the attention

[23:30] you should be paying it to.

[23:31] Because you always busy thinking about these

[23:33] other opportunities,

[23:34] you could be better.

[23:35] When in reality, think about the logical extreme here.

[23:37] One guy starts a new business or a new side hustle

[23:40] every six months.

[23:41] Think about the other guy.

[23:42] Does one business for 50 straight years

[23:43] never does anything different?

[23:45] Who makes more money?

[23:47] You already know, let's see your four years in your business,

[23:49] okay?

[23:50] And you say, man, I have this opportunity

[23:53] that I could be doing so much more money.

[23:55] Okay, that's fine, but for you to do that,

[23:59] that means you're gonna miss out on your five

[24:01] of your current business.

[24:03] All right, now what you're really missing out on is

[24:05] not only are you missing all of this, right?

[24:09] But the new business has to be able to do that, you're one.

[24:14] Now maybe the new business does have that.

[24:17] You're one which is great.

[24:18] But again, now you're two,

[24:20] let's say you're a little higher there.

[24:21] That's okay, but this is what you're also missing out on.

[24:24] The line that would have been off this fucking graph, right?

[24:26] Here is that this is the second year

[24:29] and this is the second year from when you made the decision.

[24:32] And this is what people miss out on.

[24:34] This is what people don't get.

[24:35] This is why people stay poor as they can't stick with stuff.

[24:38] Because a mediocre opportunity executed to infinity

[24:42] is going to do better than an inferior opportunity

[24:45] that you consistently switch to over and over again.

[24:48] And so the reason that these things create

[24:51] more enterprise value is that most of these take time,

[24:56] even in the precariserization would take work and time,

[24:59] almost all of these take time.

[25:01] And so if you just think about the logical stream

[25:03] of what your actions lead to,

[25:05] you can reverse into the present of what actions

[25:08] will I get the most return for my effort.

[25:10] And that is how you can grade a lifetime of generation

[25:14] of wealth.

[25:15] And if this stuff about focus is hitting for you,

[25:17] I made a whole talk on this at my headquarters here in Vegas

[25:20] to have group of business owners about it.

[25:21] Check it out.

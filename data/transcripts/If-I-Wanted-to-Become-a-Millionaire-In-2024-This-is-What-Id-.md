[00:00] This is the blueprint to be coming a millionaire and I'm gonna walk you through the levels to be coming one.

[00:07] Level one is the fundamentals of wealth creation and we're gonna start with what even is a millionaire?

[00:13] It's someone who's net worth excluding the primary residence is an excess of a million dollars assets minus

[00:19] my abilities. For example, let's say you own a one million dollar house and you oh

[00:24] 500 thousand dollars on it. If you had nothing else saved up in your bank house

[00:29] I would hope that you did but let's just say you had nothing else saved up in your bank account

[00:33] then your net worth would be 500k in this instance you would not be a millionaire right now

[00:39] Let's call this a one million dollar house and the oh nothing on it your net worth would be a million dollars now

[00:44] There's a difference between having a liquid net worth versus a net worth a liquid net worth is

[00:49] Assess it you can trade in and out of so if I had

[00:52] Million dollars in cash in my bank account versus owning assets that were worth a million dollars

[00:55] Those are different things and you might be wondering how does Alex have any authority to speak on the subject?

[01:00] I'll tell you why I became a million in my early 20s

[01:03] I had my first cash million in my bank account when I was 27 and I crossed a hundred million dollars in that worth by each thirty one

[01:08] So I became a millionaire a hundred times in a row

[01:10] So I can tell you how to do it at least once and I've helped over a hundred other people create a million dollar plus net worth

[01:15] Over my career and there's just the one thing I know about let alone all the people in our community

[01:20] He's done a lot better than that and so we go to step two in this little journey of ours, which is equity

[01:25] Because there's two ways that you can become a millionaire you can earn your way there or you can own your way there and the faster way is to own your way there

[01:33] And that's what I'm gonna walk you through

[01:36] So I'm gonna walk you through both examples of earning your way there, which is how I first thought it was

[01:42] Versus owning

[01:44] So if I want to earn my way to a million dollars then I'm going to need to make two million dollars over

[01:49] Experiod of time and then

[01:52] Divide that by two because of taxes to get to my one million dollars. Let's say making two hundred thousand dollars a year

[01:58] And I made two hundred thousand dollars a year for a decade

[02:00] That's assuming that you saved one hundred percent of your income you'd be able to earn your way to

[02:05] One million dollars in liquid net worth on the other hand you can own your way

[02:10] Meaning that you own assets either

[02:12] You know, which could be businesses or real estate, which probably the two most common assets that people own that are trying to invest when I say invest

[02:17] When you are an entrepreneur you are investing you're just heavily index on one stock, which is your own. Let's say that I create a business

[02:24] That gets to $250,000 per year in some instances

[02:28] I might be able to sell this company if it was truly automated and had a a team of people that worked without me dating it

[02:34] I could sell this at probably a four times multiple and this is again

[02:37] That would be a very good multiple for a business that is doing that kind of profit because this is actually a small amount of profit for when we're talking business

[02:44] sales, but that would get us to a

[02:46] One million dollar

[02:48] net worth all right because we want a hundred percent of this business that makes 250,000 dollars you improv it without us working at all

[02:55] And we could sell that four million dollars and so you can see the difference here. It's like okay

[02:58] Well, one of these takes ten years this one is just how long does it take me to automate the creation of 250,000 dollars a year

[03:04] And so what's interesting here is that almost the actual income between the two is almost identical

[03:09] But as soon as you achieve it you almost already have the net worth because here time is working against you because you have taxes

[03:16] And you have your living expenses that are cutting out of this every single year

[03:19] Whereas here you get the multiplier without your living expenses with time being an ally for you which takes us to the next step on our journey

[03:30] Don't diversify diversification is for waiting

[03:34] The

[03:36] diversification to quote Uncle Warren is a hedge against ignorance

[03:40] You only diversify if you don't know what you're doing the more you know the less risky it is

[03:44] I actually am approaching diversification from a focus perspective

[03:48] Which is what's the one thing that you're gonna invest your most valuable resource because when you're early on you don't have that much money

[03:54] So your most valuable resource isn't your money?

[03:56] It's your time and your attention. There's two ways we can allocate it V1

[04:01] We do little allocations like this

[04:04] I'm gonna look at crypto. I'm gonna look at day trading. I'm gonna look at forex

[04:07] I'm gonna look at flipping houses. I'm gonna look at long-term investing in real states

[04:11] I'm gonna look into Airbnb

[04:12] I'm gonna look into starting an ATM business. I'm gonna look at you get the idea, right?

[04:16] So let's say this is you and this is your time and attention that you have to pursue any new opportunity

[04:21] So you say I need seven incomes dreams because the average millionaire has seven incomes dreams

[04:25] So I'm gonna spread myself thin between seven different opportunities and while I do that

[04:30] I'm gonna be multitasking trying to fill different cups at the same time with different colors and I'm somehow gonna wait until one of these things

[04:36] Takes off right. I have to see which one of these will work

[04:40] But the reality is it's not which of these ones will work any of them could work if you put the work in

[04:46] But you have to reach a threshold once you get to the top the extra cash start spilling over and you actually have a profitable opportunity

[04:52] Which one of these cups is closer to spilling over?

[04:54] You going in on one thing or you spreading yourself between seven and the reason that this myth continues to proliferate is because it's

[05:00] Absolutely true that people who are the wealthiest have multiple income streams

[05:03] But what's not true is about how they got there the wealthiest people in the world go all in on one income stream

[05:09] And they keep adding it up over and over and over again until it overflows and then once it overflows

[05:16] Because they're making so much money from their one opportunity

[05:19] They then start diversifying back between the other different ways

[05:24] But they made their wealth focusing on one thing and then they maintain their wealth by distributing it

[05:30] You don't make money by by splitting your attention up

[05:33] You make it by focusing on the one thing that matters most be two you say what do I really like?

[05:38] Well, I do have experienced doing this one thing and so I'm gonna ignore all of these other opportunities and just go all in on one thing

[05:44] The reason I'm such a big advocate of focusing your attention on one thing is that this is where you get disproportionate returns

[05:50] Because I think it's very arrogant to think that your 10% of your attention where you're not even that good at business to begin with

[05:55] Spread between 10 things is somehow going to compete against somebody who's putting all of their effort on one thing

[06:00] But here's the fallacy that most people who are starting out don't get they think

[06:04] I'm gonna try all of them and see which one works out or rather I'm gonna try to start multiple things and see which one takes off

[06:11] But the reality is that all of them could take off or none of them could take off

[06:15] But it's silly based on which one you work on so it's not which one will work

[06:19] It's which one will you work on you want to go as fast as possible through that I have no idea what I'm doing phase

[06:24] So you can get to the I do know what I'm doing phase and I understand the risks that are associated with this

[06:30] And that's why I don't want to diversify because I actually get outsized returns here

[06:34] There's five stages that you go through as an entrepreneur when you're considering a new opportunity phase one is

[06:41] It's called uninformed optimism. This is where you were uninformed

[06:45] But you're like man this opportunity sounds so great look at all these people making on this money and so then you dive in and

[06:52] Then you get to something called

[06:54] Informed pessimism you're like oh wow

[06:56] This isn't as easy as I thought there's all these other things that they didn't talk about in this ad or in this highlight

[07:02] Real that they show me on this YouTube short about this person that made a thousand dollars

[07:04] They going from nothing from a home right?

[07:06] So then what happens next is you keep working on it and then you get into the valley of

[07:13] despair

[07:15] sad face at face

[07:17] This is where most people quit and this is what most people do now

[07:21] dot dot

[07:23] They find another one of these things to get into and they go all the way over back here because they take oh

[07:29] No this one has due to on this side of the fence

[07:32] So I'm gonna go to the other side of the fence where the grass is green

[07:35] But what they don't realize is when they get into that side

[07:37] It's completely made of manure and that's why the grass is so green right?

[07:41] There's poo on both sides you just didn't know about it until you got there all right and so what happens is people keep repeating the cycle

[07:48] Over and over and over again and then never make progress and so here's the thing is that when you do find something that you're like you know

[07:54] What I kind of like this okay?

[07:56] This is harder than I originally thought I need to keep learning wow

[08:00] This is actually really hard. There's a lot more pieces to this than I understood at the beginning

[08:04] I guess this is why everyone is at rich and

[08:06] then something magic happens

[08:09] You then start to have

[08:11] informed

[08:13] Optimism you now start to realize you've wrapped your arms around whatever the opportunity is or whatever thing you're pursuing and you're like okay

[08:20] I haven't gotten there yet

[08:21] I understand the math I understand the process is getting where I am to where I'm trying to go and ultimately

[08:26] This is what I'm trying to do with this blueprint for you is it if I can help you tackle as much of this or at least

[08:30] Compress the time that takes you get here

[08:32] That's a big victory for me and then you finally get to the final phase

[08:35] Which is achievement which is you actually accomplish

[08:39] externally what you set out to and most newbies fall out between here and here and then start this process over again

[08:45] So most people only relive this over and over and over again without ever making it to hear

[08:53] Which then naturally leads you to here because then you have no desire to

[08:57] Deversify because you now get it and what are you doing here?

[09:01] You reset the you reset the target

[09:04] You say this is where I want to go next and

[09:06] Because you've been through this process once you understand that you know what me going after this ten times bigger girl

[09:12] Sounds amazing I'm gonna find out there's some stuff that sucks

[09:15] There's gonna be a period where it's gonna really suck and it's gonna feel hopeless because I don't see how how to get through it

[09:19] I'm gonna keep jogging and then understand how to get there and then I'm gonna get there

[09:22] I'm gonna repeat the process now we go to the last part of level one of

[09:26] Becoming a millionaire

[09:30] The long game

[09:33] If I told you to build a tallest target possibly could in 10 seconds here's what you might do boom

[09:39] 5 4

[09:42] 3 2

[09:45] 1 time right now imagine I told you to build the tallest building you possibly could in 10 days you would probably say you know what

[09:56] I can probably get some more boxes how flimsy it's this right like how stable is this?

[10:00] You think this is gonna last a long time probably not so I might build it piece by piece from the ground up with more stable bricks from day one

[10:08] And I would keep doing it this way right and I keep adding and keep adding and keep adding and then when

[10:14] 10 days came I might be five stories high and so the reason this is such an important

[10:21] Frameshift for people is that the fact that they're in a rush

[10:25] Causes them to build the thing they want to build differently the fastest way to get to

[10:31] This tall is to build it the exact way I did earlier stack it end end up to this point

[10:36] But if I then said I need you to build something that's 10 stories tall you would never get there and what happens is people get stuck

[10:43] Right they get stuck at this level

[10:46] And they can't add another one on top and they stay here and they're like why can't I get my million dollar

[10:51] Business to 10 million dollars and it's because you built it wrong to begin with and so I as much as this sounds painful

[10:57] Sometimes the fastest way to get to 10 million is to start back at zero and build it right to begin with

[11:02] I talk so much about long game and about making sure that you're building it the right way because this thing

[11:08] Is never gonna last and so the hardest thing about building something right is that in the beginning

[11:14] You need to have something to sell need your amazing valuable thing and then that's a megaphone is terrible

[11:19] But then you need to advertise it to let people know about stuff and then

[11:25] You start making sales but the problem is that people get to this point and then think oh

[11:30] I need to do mark more marketing and sales right because that's what made me money

[11:34] But the problem is the more you market and sell the more people actually find out that this is not a gift and this is actually a

[11:40] Big pile of shit

[11:43] And so what happens is now you've got people who buy this thing and tell their friends this thing stinks and then over time

[11:50] It becomes more and more expensive for you to advertise because

[11:54] Your reputation stinks and so the right way to build it is to understand that you have to build the thing first and then you got to let people know about it

[12:02] But then you don't crank on this you keep fixing this thing until this guy becomes a happy camper

[12:10] And tells his friends and then till that

[12:13] Happens you keep making this thing better and this is the same thing as if I did this and just kept guessing it

[12:18] That's me vertically building the tower and then reaching a max that I can't go past anymore versus

[12:23] Building it so that I get people to say wow this thing's amazing and so then they also tell people for me

[12:29] So that when I get to that point I actually built it with a huge base of foundation and I can keep stacking on top of it

[12:35] And that's the difference in terms of mindset and perspective of how you actually build something that's going to last and then

[12:41] Along the way with your team and the people that you hire rather than saying I just need a body in the sea

[12:45] I see the person to do this thing. You're like who here has talent and I might interview 20 people for one role

[12:51] Rather than three so I get the right person if you feel stuck all the time and you can't make progress

[12:57] Usually need to go back to the beginning and realize that you built a vertical business

[13:02] I had no foundation to begin with and now we have our foundation built for our level one of wealth creation

[13:07] Level two is all about the actual tactics of getting to making your first million and it starts with finding a hungry crowd

[13:14] Let me explain what I mean by find a hungry crowd

[13:16] This guy started a business selling hot dogs and he was given one wish from a genie of what competitive advantage

[13:22] He would be able to have the first thought he had was like maybe I'll make my hot dogs cheaper the genie shook his head and was like no

[13:28] He's like hmm, what if I made my hot dogs taste better?

[13:30] The genie said no, don't waste your wish on that maybe I'll just make mine the fastest cooking

[13:35] So I can serve the hot dogs faster genie said that's not what you want to waste your wish on the genie looked at him holding the hot dogs in buns in hand

[13:42] And said it's not about the hot dogs if you want to build an amazing business

[13:46] You want to put your hot dogs in on the best corner in front of a starving crowd because if your hot dog stand is on the corner

[13:52] It doesn't matter how cheap they are how good they taste how fast they cook the moment that hungry crowd walks out and sees your hot dogs

[13:59] Dan you're gonna sell it every time so right off the bed

[14:01] I want to talk about two key concepts when it comes to finding a hungry crowd

[14:04] One is that we have to understand that the market is always gonna be the strongest

[14:08] Variable in how much money you make right if you're selling toilet paper during COVID

[14:12] You're gonna sell out right because it didn't matter how good your toilet paper was there was a starving crowd

[14:18] And so supply to man which is one of the reasons that we have it as our logo

[14:21] It is the strongest force in all of our cannabis and business

[14:24] It is the core thing that everything else is built up and so you have to understand that the market is number one

[14:28] If I was trying to sell

[14:29] Services to newspaper companies, well in newspaper companies are decreased by 25% per year compounding

[14:34] negatively in the wrong direction the next lever on this

[14:38] Is the offer that you give people right if you have a superior offer then if you're in a normal market

[14:44] That'll be the next lever that you have if I say hey start for free and I only get paid if you get some sort of result

[14:50] And it's a truly

[14:52] Free low risk amazing value and you get results tomorrow offer then you're gonna sell 10 times a hundred times more than someone who just has like a

[14:59] You pay me and maybe you get results and maybe you don't type of service or product the final thing is your ability to persuade

[15:06] Ideally go after a really big market with an amazing offer and be a hell of a persuader

[15:12] But the thing is is you can be terrible persuading and have a terrible offer and say you can only buy my toilet paper in

[15:18] 80 roll chunks or I'm not gonna sell it to you and still sell out during COVID

[15:23] But if it's not COVID then it's how can I make the totally paper offer that I have to give you the more compelling and if all the toilet paper offers look the same

[15:31] Then it just comes down to how well I can persuade people to buy mine

[15:34] That's concept one when it comes to finding a hundred-accompanied

[15:37] Concept two is the four things that I look for when I'm actually trying to find that market number one is

[15:43] I want people who are in pain you want to make sure that the people that you're selling to are in desperate need

[15:48] They don't want but must have the thing that you were selling the second is that they must have the ability to buy so purchasing power

[15:56] So a friend of mine had a business where he how people who are unemployed

[16:01] Fixed their resumes so that they could get a job now you might be like oh wow

[16:06] Tons of pain absolutely but the problem was he kept trying to grow this business and he couldn't grow it because they were all broke

[16:12] Because they never job the third factor that I look for is

[16:16] Easy to target because at the end of the day

[16:19] Even if you have some reason lots of pain who can buy your thing if you can never find them

[16:23] It doesn't matter because they're never gonna buy your things. They'll never know you exist

[16:25] And so if I have the choice between two different marketplaces in one of them is like nurses incredibly easy to find or something that is way harder to find like

[16:35] Psychedelic as text in you know Croatia way harder to target and you know what they might have a huge pain

[16:41] And lots purchasing power to buy my thing but if I can't find them it's relevant the fourth point you want to have is that you have a growing market

[16:46] Now I gave the example earlier about the newspapers, right?

[16:49] So believe it or not a good friend of mine actually had a business that sell a rev share model to newspaper

[16:54] So he was an amazingly persuasive guy

[16:57] He had an amazing offer which is zero risk. He just said like let me get a percentage of the revenue that I bring to you

[17:02] All right, so these two things were completely maxed out

[17:04] But he couldn't figure out why his company wasn't growing over here

[17:07] He was beating his competitors and gaining more customers than they were

[17:11] But still slipping away in terms of his ability to grow and it was because the entire marketplaces a whole was shrinking and so you want to make sure

[17:19] They have all four of these things you can't just have three of them or two of them or one of them

[17:23] You need to have all four and so when you're thinking about what thing you want to sell

[17:27] Start with who you want to sell it to so you have your hunger card now. What do you do?

[17:32] One avatar one product one channel. This is the simplest formula to getting

[17:37] $2 million plus all you have to do is find one person that you want to help

[17:41] It's just making sure that you're very clear on the one very specific person that you are going to help

[17:45] That is the avatar the next thing is you want to give them one product and the reason I say with one product is that a lot of people over

[17:51] Complicate their businesses too early. They're like man if I want to double my business

[17:55] I should sell them three things right and then I'll get them to buy more stuff

[18:00] But the thing is is that if you're under a million dollars

[18:02] You're just adding a ton of complexity when you don't even have that many customers and so most times you'd be better served

[18:08] Steakin with the one thing that you're selling and saying how can I sell three times as many of the exact same person?

[18:14] And that becomes the problem that you solve

[18:17] But most people get confronted with these issues and then go for the easy route and again

[18:21] This is like that building where you can add something on top really quickly

[18:24] But it doesn't create the skyscraper that you want instead you want to think how can I do more the third variable here is

[18:31] Channel now it doesn't matter what channel you're currently a car customer is on you can hit a million dollars plus

[18:37] Literally any channel that you advertise on without going under new channels

[18:41] So if you do outreach as then you reach out to people one-on-one to get customers whether that's cold calls cold emails

[18:47] DMs you can expand and continue to get more customers with that one channel if you post content

[18:53] You can keep posting content on whatever channel you're on and just do it better post more content post better content

[19:00] And by doing so you'll increase the amount of customers still with only one money making product or

[19:05] Let's say you're running ads obviously if you're running ads you can just spend more money on the ads provided you're doing it

[19:10] Profitably and if you can't expand past $2,000 you're probably with paid ads

[19:14] You have a business problem or you have a pricing problem

[19:17] You don't actually need to add another channel because then it again complicates your business because you're like, okay

[19:22] Well, I'm currently doing you know 500,000 here on YouTube you don't want me to do you might think oh I'm gonna start doing cold emails

[19:29] Right as my next way of getting customers well that majorly complicates your business when you're this early on

[19:35] Now you might be think wait shouldn't I have diversity of how you acquire customers?

[19:39] I thought you said that was a good idea. It is but you're so small

[19:42] It doesn't matter yet because you're not looking at a potential acquire or who's gonna try and look for to decrease risk for you

[19:49] You just need to get better at doing the one thing that you do well because you're really probably not that good yet

[19:54] As terrible as that may sound it's probably real all right and so the fastest way to get to the million is to build it right from the get-go and not over-complicate your business

[20:02] Which means you pick one avatar one product and one channel that you focus on until you get there

[20:08] So now we go back to our tactics of building our first million dollars the next thing at level two is our offer

[20:15] Now I wrote an entire book on this thing 100 million dollar offers

[20:18] It answers the question what should I sell and it's because that's the most common question that I get asked every single day

[20:24] For people who are trying to start a business which makes sense what am I supposed to sell so I call this the value equation now

[20:29] Fundamentally you've probably heard all over the internet. You need to provide value. You got to give value right

[20:33] But the question is what is value and after doing a lot of study

[20:36] Afirgin this app between our profile companies it actually comes down to four variables

[20:40] Variable number one is the dream outcome what the dream outcome is for whoever the prospect that you pick is the way that you can compare two different

[20:46] Dream outcomes is how much more value

[20:47] But they think one outcome is versus another if I would have talked to a

[20:50] 30 year old man and say hey I can help you lose weight where I can make you a millionaire

[20:56] Most guys would value being a millionaire more than let's say being handsome

[21:01] There are different outcomes that people will describe different values too and that's just a very

[21:06] Extreme example. Well, let's use the weight loss example and let's switch it to women if I have one ebook that helps someone was weight

[21:12] And then I've got a one-on-one personal training program that has someone was weight

[21:15] It's the same dream outcome so then what then determines which one is more valuable because the ebook might be 50 bucks

[21:20] And be overpriced and the personal training might be $5,000 and be underpriced

[21:24] How can you make that discrepancy because there's more value? Let me explain the next one is perceived likely to achievement

[21:30] Meaning when I buy how likely do I think I will get what I want through buy if I buy a $50 ebook on

[21:40] Good meals that I can cook that are healthy

[21:42] Maybe I'll get some food that I might like in here and I can feel a little better about myself

[21:46] But they don't realistically think that they're gonna all of a sudden transfer on their entire body from a 50 dollar ebook

[21:51] Now if you sign up for personal training for a year

[21:53] You probably have a way bigger perceived likely to achieve it and so you value it higher now

[21:58] Both of these elements the dream outcome and the perceived likely to achieve it are the things that you want to increase

[22:04] In your communication with prospect you're saying it's really really likely that you're gonna get this thing that you really really want

[22:10] The next two variables the equation are the painful side of the equation

[22:14] Which is what is someone have to give up in order to get it so the first thing

[22:18] That we have is time and there's two elements of time. There's micro and macro micro is

[22:24] How long is this gonna take every day?

[22:26] There's a certain amount of time that's gonna take on the micro for them to experience the result

[22:30] Right, so if I'm talking about the lady who's doing personal training

[22:32] She might have to go to the gym three times week. That's gonna take time. She might have to prepare food

[22:36] That's gonna take time. That's on the micro level on the macro level

[22:39] How long is she gonna have to do these micro commitments in order to get the macro result that she wants?

[22:44] She might have to lose 50 pounds and I might take her 18 months

[22:46] So macro the goal is I want this to be as little as possible micro time

[22:51] And I want this to be as sure as possible on the macro so that when I say hey

[22:54] You're gonna get the dream body you want you absolutely know that you're gonna get it and it's gonna happen really really fast

[22:59] So the next thing is effort and sacrifice effort is what you have to start doing that you weren't doing

[23:07] That you don't want to do as a result of the purchase

[23:10] Sacrifice are things that you have to stop doing that you wish you could do but can't do anymore as a result of the purchase

[23:16] And so for our lovely young lady

[23:19] She's gonna have to sacrifice

[23:20] Margarita Mondays and Taco Tuesdays she's no longer gonna be able to get to do that even though she wants to do that

[23:26] She's gonna have to sacrifice sleeping in on the weekends and she's gonna have to start

[23:31] Weaking up early and working out and eating food that she doesn't like and so that's for

[23:35] In fact, if I tend to be dual sides of the same coin whatever you have to start doing

[23:38] She's typically have to stop doing something else the top side we tried increase the bottom side

[23:44] We try and decrease we want to get it to zero because if you think about this in a hypothetical

[23:49] Extreme the perfect offer that have the absolute most value would be the biggest most compelling dreamy

[23:56] Compossibly imagine that you're absolutely guaranteed to get

[24:00] Instantly with no effort

[24:02] So if I say you can click a button on my website and then look down at your apps and then have a six pack

[24:07] That would be the hypothetical extreme value now people can get that through personal training changing their diet and waiting 12 months

[24:14] But because of this

[24:17] The value is significantly decreased because there are costs associated

[24:21] Understanding all four of these variables is how you craft offers that get people to say yes and give you money because

[24:27] Oftentimes the most expensive part of the offer that you have isn't the money

[24:31] It's the other things that they have to start doing as a result of the purchase those are called hitting costs if I have a marketing agency

[24:37] Okay, and I do content for people all right and

[24:42] When I start to in content I say okay, it's gonna take a 60 days to ramp up

[24:47] We're gonna start having two calls a week for an hour

[24:49] You're gonna have to fly out to my studio and we're gonna record and it's gonna take 60 days before you're gonna start seeing any kind of traction

[24:55] Imagine that offer

[24:57] Compared to somebody who says you don't need to do anything I can just draw stuff on my own a

[25:03] Immediately start posting and your phone's gonna ring today

[25:05] Well shoot, which ones more valuable?

[25:07] It's still the same core services, but how we wrap them make them

[25:12] Probably ten times more valuable than they were before and that's why I understand these variables and making the right offer

[25:18] Is so compelling on your road to your first million and the reason this is my first book is that offers is about strategy

[25:24] Offers is one of the largest levers that you can pull with any business because it actually affects all departments when you change the offer

[25:30] It changes how you market when you change the offer it changes the sales script the sales process

[25:34] When you change the offer it changes what you deliver it literally affects everything and so for us

[25:40] We always try and nail this with our portfolio companies that acquisition.com to be clear

[25:44] We don't sell coaching we invest in businesses and buy them and for context our average portfolio company over the first 12 months

[25:51] 1.8x is revenue and 3.01x is profit and over their first 24 months

[25:56] They two point eight x revenue in 4.7x profit meaning that they disproportionately drop the increase in revenue to their bottom line

[26:04] Because we make sure that the thing that we are selling is as valuable as humanly possible

[26:09] So the next on our journey of wealth and riches and glory and status and all things amazing is

[26:16] Marketing and sales and if you think about this from a sequence perspective

[26:20] You have to make the thing and then

[26:23] You have to promote the thing now the making the thing is

[26:26] 100 million dollar offers what should I sell then next question is who should I sell it to aka?

[26:31] Getting leads and you get leads through advertising which is the concept of my second book

[26:36] 100 million dollar leads and then you get them to buy

[26:40] But the thing that people mess up is that they then think okay, I'm gonna do more of that

[26:44] But what you actually need to do next is you go back to here and you fix the product and keep making it better

[26:50] And then you promote it more and then you come back and fix the product make it better and it becomes as much recycled

[26:54] So if we need to understand how to market and sell

[26:57] Then it means that you have to have one advertising method. There are eight ways you can advertise

[27:02] There's four that you can do and then there's four that other people can do for you

[27:06] You can do warm outreach which is reaching out one to one to your friends

[27:09] You can post content one to many but to people who know you you can run paid ads

[27:13] Which is doing one to many to strangers or you can do one to one to strangers which is cold outreach

[27:18] And if you're like man no one's buying my thing I can guarantee you that you're not doing enough of these core four period

[27:23] That's it because these are the only four things that you can do to advertise the next thing is that you can get referrals from customers

[27:30] Which are lead getters next you can have employees who help do the core four for you

[27:34] You can have agencies who run the core four for you make content for you do outreach for you

[27:41] All of those things you can hire another business help you with and then finally

[27:44] You've got affiliates which some people call influencer some people call endorsements

[27:47] But somebody who already has an audience already has a business and then you compensate in some way to do the advertising for you the core four to let other people know about your stuff

[27:55] these are the eight ways

[27:57] That you can advertise anything to anyone and the nice thing is when you're starting out for your first million

[28:02] Just pick one once you pick the advertising method that you want and let's say you're using lead getters

[28:06] You have to learn one of the core four to then get lead getters and that's okay

[28:10] That's fine. That's part of business. These will always give you more leverage than the first four

[28:14] And that's okay, but you have to start with these first

[28:16] So let's assume that you're just going to stick to the core four at the beginning because you're like

[28:19] I don't want to involve other parties which I recommend especially if you're starting out and you're like, you know what?

[28:23] I'm going to post content. That's what you're gonna do. That's your your method. All right now

[28:27] You're gonna have all these people who like your posts comment on your posts DM you personally when you make content

[28:34] That they find compelling or interesting and say hey, I love your help on whatever this thing is then you transition into sales

[28:40] Now it's so important for founders who are starting a company to be an interglion involved in both of these processes

[28:47] The reason you want the founder to be interglion involved in the beginning is one it's cheaper and especially when you have less cash

[28:52] That makes sense to these your skills that you're gonna that are gonna be required for you to succeed over the long

[28:57] So you're gonna want to understand them at a tactical level because when you bring someone else in in the future

[29:01] These lead getters whether it's employees, agencies, affiliates, whatever you can teach them the right way to do it

[29:06] And when they say hey, that's not possible you can be like, no, it is let me show you how and then you have a litmus

[29:10] Test of whose legit and who's not who's gonna help you in your journey whether you're hiring them or you're incentivizing them it works the same when it comes to the sales side

[29:18] We want to get into a choreographed process knowing what step one

[29:22] Through letter Z of the process looks like to get someone from I

[29:29] Think this might be interesting to giving you money

[29:32] But if you don't know what you're doing first you have to

[29:35] Throw stuff on the wall and see what sticks and a lot of it's just gonna be your gut in the beginning and figure

[29:39] That didn't work. Whoo that didn't oh that one actually got a response all right that's step two

[29:43] And you keep trying until you get to step three and then keep trying until you get to support

[29:46] So eventually somebody gives you money and then you backtrack and say what happened to this person?

[29:49] That is do these steps great now I'm gonna try and recreate that as many times as I can and then that becomes your process

[29:56] And that process repeats at each micro level two because that might be three or four steps to get to the conversation

[30:02] Or someone it might give you money and then what are you doing that conversation?

[30:05] Well, when I asked this question first and this question second and this question third

[30:08] It's more likely that they ultimately buy and so if you don't follow a script in the beginning you better make one because if you're going to eventually get out of sales

[30:15] Would you shoot if you want to scale then you're going to be able to teach somebody else how to self-tool

[30:18] And one of the biggest issues early on is that the founders the most convicted about the product and you should be it's your company

[30:24] But people who come after you are never gonna be as charismatic or as convicted in the thing that you have as you are

[30:29] Which means you need to follow a process to maximize the likely that the prospects that they speak with

[30:35] Ultimately purchase the next level in our blue printer journey to wealth the mountain of Mordor and my Mordor

[30:41] I mean more money is paying yourself how much should you pay yourself when should you pay yourself?

[30:46] But all the top is we're gonna talk about today

[30:47] This is probably the most subjective and the reason for that is because it underlines one key concept that is a hundred percent personal

[30:54] Which is risk tolerance which is how much risk are you willing to take individually?

[30:58] One of the regrets that I have early on as I continue to

[31:02] Double down on my gym chain was that I took all the profit of each gym and I kept putting into the next gym

[31:06] And I basically took nothing out for the entire time now that's super risky

[31:09] I was living on nothing living cheap. I was eating cheap

[31:12] I had a cash car that I owned outright and I just

[31:16] Put everything I had to make every hour of my day growing my business

[31:19] Eventually though ended up losing all the money from selling all my gyms and was left with nothing

[31:23] And if I had taken out some cash during that period of time, I would have had two benefits

[31:27] But if at number one is that when you really try and take out cash with in the business

[31:32] You'd be amazed at how much cash would just magically appears and so I like having bank account

[31:38] PRs be a good personal goal for every entrepreneur

[31:41] Even if the increment that you're increasing is small it does two things one it forces you to take cash out of the business

[31:47] So forces cash flow the second is that it forces you to decrease

[31:53] You're spending personally and I have a strong belief that as you're coming up

[31:57] Learning the discipline to spend less if you increase the cash for the intake out of the business

[32:02] And you spend less over time than your bank account has nowhere to go

[32:06] But up and I can promise you that when you have a very full bank account business decisions become less stressful

[32:12] And when you make less stress decisions you make better decision

[32:15] I do believe in taking some money out of the business along the way because let's be real

[32:19] You're going to live along life and then you're going to die and if you double down every single minute until the day that you died

[32:24] You build the most enterprise value you live a really shitty life

[32:27] So at some point you have to balance the investment versus consumption of life itself or the fruit of your labor

[32:34] That is why I'm a believer in at least allocating a certain percentage of the cash flow from the business to you personally

[32:39] a healthy way of thinking about this that we have for some more

[32:43] Heavy capital intensive businesses meaning like brick and mortar chains

[32:46] Which is one of the biggest parts of our portfolio. This is one back of napkinway that you can use

[32:50] 33% goes to you 30% goes to growth which is new locations

[32:54] And then this is rainy day. This is cash reserves to the business cash reserves to you and this is for new locations

[33:00] Another way of doing it is something called watermark

[33:03] We know that we need to grow two locations and this is a proxy it doesn't have to be two locations

[33:08] You can be hiring two people hiring two reps. It doesn't matter two more developers if you're a software company

[33:12] It works the same two more per month costs $X dollars

[33:15] We have why profit so all we do is we say whatever the profit is at the end of the month

[33:20] We subtract this and then we have a watermark above which we always leave in the account and then everything else

[33:28] We distribute this cash flow. That's the different way of doing it. This is a little bit more aggressive

[33:31] If you want to maintain a certain growth rate this one is a little bit more flexible

[33:35] It really depends on you and your tolerance for risk and that's one one thing that I'd say I pride myself on in terms of

[33:41] Arbulated a helpful company since newer founders were creating their first kind of generational wealth is

[33:45] These are hard conversations to have and a really important conversations to have then you want somebody who isn't a financial advisor

[33:50] Who's trying to get you to take as much cash out so that they can invest and get their 1% fee?

[33:54] You want some reason on the same side of the table as you'd be like I get where you're at

[33:57] I can see where your wealth is and also sees over the next 24th 36 60 months

[34:01] What it looks like for us to just have that one big blue so you never have to work again

[34:05] Yeah

[34:06] Roaching the second level of the table over a second level which is setting goals

[34:11] And I think this is a really misunderstanding most people think like oh I need smart goals or specific

[34:16] Control that I'll show you what I do that all right so random focusing on how we focus on activities

[34:21] So the goal should be what happens but the goal should be what we do

[34:26] I had a buddy mine

[34:27] Is this your name you take random on 20 random on 30 random on and then if you would follow up

[34:31] And I was like why do you keep on enough?

[34:33] He said well I make the money and I keep my goals so that I like ease off the gas bill

[34:36] And I said excuse your defining your roles the wrong way

[34:39] I see was not hitting your role every time you're not doing the activities

[34:43] And so I said pink the activities the goal and then you'll hit it every time being more

[34:48] And it's a big flip top he saw his own success into simply at the end of the day

[34:52] Did he do all the things that he said he was going to do at the beginning of the day and then you can actually control your inputs

[34:59] Because inputs are what drive

[35:03] Outputs don't need to go out

[35:06] Say what am I gonna do that would be unreasonable that I don't hit these out

[35:10] So for example my inputs might be and this is one of my favorite ways for thinking about like advertising

[35:15] Is something that I call the rule 100

[35:19] So the rule 100 simply says that if you do a hundred primary actions over a hundred days

[35:23] You'll usually enter first result that you multiply one now you pump people by saying you're even the first result

[35:28] You want but the key point is that you're doing a hundred actions and one of my little monitors

[35:33] I would share with you is count in hundreds all right, so a lot of people are like in a Disney how many hundreds did you do?

[35:39] If I was doing more more in jazz, I'd say cool reach out to 100 for today

[35:43] If you do any home reach out, let's say cool reach out to 100 people a day if I'm making content cool

[35:48] Make a hundred minutes of cuts and every day if I'm running ads I'd say run a hundred dollars a day

[35:53] In each of those are activities that we can say these things will drive these outputs

[35:58] They make that the goal and so at the end of the day you said yes, I did or no

[36:03] I didn't do it not did I make a sale because I want or what even human sale

[36:07] They you should still do your tutter inputs so they can make two sales tomorrow

[36:11] So the second class I'm gonna talk to go to the company balls how we actually set the lowest portfolio companies

[36:16] And it's not the way in a day, but it is something that we're gonna recognize because we actually use the scientific method

[36:22] Here's how it works four simple boxes one this is what problem are we actually try this off a lot of times

[36:28] We spend the most time on this part of this because a lot of times you're like a few we need to read your logo

[36:33] Why what is that going to accomplish?

[36:36] What can string are we leaving it right because so us we at our goals to the constraints of the business

[36:42] Because let's say that conversion rate on our own age is not a problem

[36:45] But then why do we need to reach it on the logo?

[36:48] Oh we don't but about their ways to solve problems is decided on our common yield

[36:52] So this is how number one which is what problem we're solving the second is what's our hypothesis?

[36:58] Which is a near-fancy x then y?

[37:01] So what that means is I say my hypothesis is in far website is low conversion as the problem never solving

[37:09] My hypothesis is that if you redesign the website

[37:13] We will then get increased emerges and then only if you say how do we measure

[37:20] x and 1 how do I measure that we redesign I could say yes or no I did it

[37:25] Or I could say that we hold a split test every one day that we run over the quarter that we the x

[37:31] That's something I could say yes, or what we did and then why my comparison rate let's say we're a 10% and

[37:37] Then I'd say is it greater than 10%

[37:40] Yes, or not and then finally the last thing is did we do it and

[37:46] Then didn't work we figured out the problem solving we figured out what our hypothesis is to solve it

[37:51] We determined how we're going to measure whether or not we did or whether it had happened and then we say did we do the thing and then didn't happen

[37:58] Because we could not do the thing and then it wouldn't matter if we have to repeat it later

[38:02] It's all from the wire we don't doing this thing

[38:04] But if we did it today then either be improved it or maybe you redesign the website and the conversion rate didn't improve

[38:11] So either that might not be to constrain or our hypothesis was wrong and so this allows you to

[38:16] Eradately improve the business

[38:18] So we covered the fundamentals of wealth creation

[38:21] Then we talked about how to create our first fillet and now we got it and now the little three we're talking about signature and getting the original

[38:28] Again rich once so one of my mentors was ex-cold minstacks and Chloe and one of his mentors

[38:35] You go minstacks told him we show me after you ever chance and I heard that saying and really stuck with me

[38:41] Because if you play the game right you show me not to play it once and then after that

[38:45] Should we be depending with house money the whole time and never take bets then we would lose the far over in other words

[38:52] Never been the Empire by pot of gold and this is the very first passage you want underblood offers

[38:58] Outside the trurin's often come from many against conventional wisdom and convince the wisdom is usually right

[39:03] Given a 10% chance of a hundred times pay off you should take that bet every time for you so it would be wrong

[39:09] 9 times 10 we all know that you swim in fences. You're gonna strike out

[39:14] But you're also gonna hit some of runs the difference in baseball and business

[39:18] However, is that baseball is a shrunken outcome distribution

[39:22] When you swing no matter how well you can't in the ball the most what you can get is for

[39:27] In business every once in a while you when you step on to the plate you can score a thousand runs

[39:32] This long-tail distribution of returns is why it's important to be both big winner pay for so many experiments

[39:39] That's from Jeff basis so if you do hit it out of the park

[39:43] You should want to have to bet everything on it again to keep staying rich

[39:49] When you get that one winning bet that they're one winning ball

[39:52] They come and you knock it apart shouldn't you should be able win for good

[39:56] And so that's one of my favorite things when it comes to well-building is that four tips are created

[40:01] Through taking huge risks with small amounts of money

[40:04] But four choices are preserved by taking small risks with lots of money

[40:08] So we talked about why you only have to hear each once and if you're worried it's been for the fences

[40:13] You still need to be very sure that once you hit it you never bet it all in black again

[40:18] We're still looking to answer to our next one people

[40:21] So what explain the concept of quantum marketing calendar all right

[40:26] So you think about this as internal external to business

[40:30] now you got

[40:31] prospects on this side we have customers

[40:35] candidates

[40:36] You got to police and so you actually need to market all four directions at all times most people step all their time

[40:44] advertising here they say okay, I would spend all my resources

[40:48] Apples to get prospects and then they convert those prospects over this money line and they turn the prospects into customers

[40:54] But the promise if you only

[40:57] advertising this direction who's gonna deliver?

[41:00] The thing to these customers what you need employees?

[41:03] Which means that you also

[41:05] Amy advertising to get candidates

[41:08] Church her into employees and so this is ultimately the dual sided

[41:13] Major of advertising because as you grow the left side

[41:17] Meant to also grow the right side if you want to continue to get these customers to buy again and again

[41:23] And again then we also need to

[41:25] Amortize doing this direction to the customers to get them to buy again

[41:30] And again, so we have to test your prospects and customers

[41:32] We have a chance to get customers to become a repeat customers

[41:35] We have a chance to try them into employees and we advertise to employees to give them more engaged

[41:40] And to keep them engaged

[41:41] And keep educating them so they can send up everybody to the more value to our customers

[41:47] Hopefully see you at my side of the company

[41:49] So if you ever feel like you're a genius of the thousand hands it usually means that you're really getting

[41:52] Arotizing and turning prospects into customers

[41:54] Right, but you're really bad at turning candidates into employees and then trading employees you get to become even better

[41:59] And so the more you have to retire here the more you feel like you're half the two because you have no one else

[42:05] I'll figure out so let's say we got our genius scenario

[42:08] We've got better price scenario

[42:10] So if you're the genius of the thousand hands, right

[42:13] And you're making $5,000 top line of $2,000 a income

[42:16] Every year you make $2,000 dollars for your ads on billion dollars every taxes to your network

[42:21] This is a wallet on four right?

[42:23] But here's the difference between the example and the explain down what I was talking about before

[42:27] And this is since you can add the billion dollars to your business

[42:31] But you also have a probably 10 million dollar asset as business if this thing truly

[42:39] Rugged value E to E is short for enterprise value

[42:42] So there is no enterprise value here because it's just a genius with a thousand hands

[42:46] You're just doing with a thousand helpers here you own something that provides value to your customers

[42:52] But you can sell to somebody else because if you require no work in order to provide the value

[42:56] It means it will be a part to what cops didn't know work provide the eye which means it becomes a more valuable asset

[43:00] And so if I took the business for genius of a thousand hands, but you truly dollars here

[43:05] And I didn't increase the rapid and I didn't even increase the profit

[43:08] But I simply remove the genius and make the structure of the business genius the people who work

[43:14] It's out of it and the processes and the systems that they follow genius

[43:18] Then I can have ten million dollars to network to the first new owner and so the one that fastest ways to create well is

[43:24] Make the thing you have reliable is to make it risk free and make sure that we'll laugh and so even if it took you

[43:32] You used to do that for you to get ten million dollars so the enterprise value or network gain

[43:37] You have to make twenty million dollars of income to get to that same timid

[43:41] But meanwhile while you're building it you're still also making money in this scenario

[43:45] Which is what we basically do for the majority of businesses that we have acquisition.com

[43:50] Because if we often take this into two million three four five et cetera

[43:55] And then take them to this side and say hey, let me show you what looks like at 10

[44:01] With a seven next multiple it's a number of one or two or three million dollars to a seven million dollar network to a

[44:08] Million dollar network

[44:10] And that is how you get wealthy. This is how you get rich now

[44:13] One be clear you can absolutely get two million dollars a year in profit with not a lot of people

[44:19] We're even just on your own because the increases AI

[44:21] Automation things like that like we're gonna see more big companies with fewer if you were I now

[44:26] But until the day until the general AI comes in and just crushes everyone people are so required to get to where you want to go

[44:33] So if you want to not just make a million bucks or a couple million bucks and you want to get to 10

[44:38] Twenty fifty a hundred million dollars can be on you got to get the people side right and now

[44:44] The reputation side woo a fun joy imagine all these flowers is different life experiences that you've gone for

[44:51] If you look at them all here, this is an okay. This is just a lot of random things put together

[44:57] Now when we do this and we combine them all

[45:01] We now have something much closer to bouquet and we put all of your personal life experiences and your skills

[45:07] And your character traits together you create bouquet and in other words you create our

[45:12] Abitation but bouquet doesn't really exist all we did was we associated things that were separate and then we put them together

[45:20] And so you can strengthen your reputation by putting more in a similar type of

[45:26] Dixerian sister together. You're like oh

[45:29] He's not a strong interest in this thing now if every single one of these would be different and some of these were weeks

[45:35] It would be a lot harder to understand and what is the point of this thing and let's say that you had a drunk driving accident

[45:42] Right all of a sudden how different does this bouquet look?

[45:45] Which shows you how one negative experience in your life can actually affect how people see the rest of everything else?

[45:51] And so when we're thinking about bread or building a reputation, I like to think of as what flowers do I want in my bouquet

[45:57] And which things I might also really try to emphasize we're not included all in

[46:02] Association is our going to be ones that strengthen this and with hurting you once they break it apart

[46:07] So reputation is a different word for saying what a brand is and a brand is simply an association between something you know

[46:15] And something you don't know when we're building a bread you want to associate all the things that you want

[46:21] So to think about you with the thing that they don't know which is you now for me the more my personal brand has grown

[46:28] The more I have

[46:30] Transposed

[46:31] Acquisitions comms association with me and so now when my team goes out to the airport and it's worried I have this as acquisition

[46:41] People like to go by that after me because they've gotten value for my videos in my books

[46:46] They see a association with that value and they want to pay for it

[46:49] But if this just had a brand that I'm sure you wanted they would have no desire to pay 50 this actually happened

[46:54] One like director Victor or the airport and a brand of person came up was like happy 100 dollars for the hat

[46:58] And she said no obviously because that's our brand works. Yeah, I heard her so the idea is that that is fundamentally

[47:04] Combrating works if my Louis Vuitton right I'm gonna do the world of horse Louis Vuitton simple right if I'm the

[47:10] Liberton what do I do I get came hard to action

[47:15] To wear my clothing or care my purse and then

[47:20] Lady who doesn't have status says man I would be like him

[47:25] But I can't buy care so I'm either think that I've associated with him and then when I wear it

[47:30] I'll have this status by proxy from her and that's fundamentally how the luxury market works

[47:35] But it's also about every market works now

[47:39] Why do you bring it's drop celebrities when they make a racial slur or they get into an accident

[47:46] Where they get arrested for fraud because that becomes an association that people do know and then they don't like

[47:53] And so they say I don't want to associate our brand with that and so they said we're gonna bring this association

[47:59] And so when you're building a brand it's being very particular about what and who you want to associate with

[48:05] If I'm a horse starting us to me and I don't want to our co-hosts

[48:09] You're going to think very different things about me even if the materials exactly the same

[48:13] You would be like that's flawed

[48:15] Welcome to humanity and psychology, right?

[48:18] Doesn't matter about whether it's flawed or not. I can just say that this is how it works

[48:21] And so when you're building your reputation especially in the BV or the BCCs

[48:25] You want to provide value right we talked about value for each earlier

[48:29] And so means if you want to get things that people want you to fast and easily for the

[48:32] Deccision is very great and so when we do that you compound

[48:37] Costs were surplus the street word for that is good will which is what amount of down into what get he

[48:43] Access what they pay for so let's say I paid a dollar for something and I feel like I got five dollars worth of value

[48:50] Right everything here between the two lines is customer

[48:54] Service or but we like it all good will but the interesting thing about this is that if I do this over and

[49:03] Over and over again

[49:04] These things weren't added in my experience

[49:07] They've been

[49:08] Multiply good

[49:10] Meaning if I keep providing something good and that's why it's so hard as a brand to decide when I'm going to monetize something because the thing is that the next time

[49:18] Providing in the more value when people think that you're one of them on the size

[49:23] They love you got much more than you get that much more reach and

[49:26] More good will so that the next time and so it's basically

[49:30] Reinvesting but rather than reading the best in capital

[49:32] You're a reinvesting you will because what I can tell you is that good will compound faster than revenue

[49:38] You can build a hundred million dollar brand in

[49:41] Three years and to build a hundred million dollar in revenue

[49:44] My take you way longer than that and that's because if you just focus on providing good will at scale

[49:49] You get a disproportionate return the rock was it over night build

[49:54] Terra Monna into a six billion dollar company simply makes it on his friend and who would have you

[49:59] You built her a beauty line into a billion-dollar grid

[50:01] Conner Gregor with proper file billion-dollar grid George Clooney building our grid and so

[50:07] They understood this concept which is that this will grow faster and so they just proportionally invest early in

[50:14] This so that later they can monetize and do the right hook the people loop to the audience and to quote on the word

[50:21] It doesn't matter how much you build you have any number

[50:25] No matter how big it is

[50:27] Multiply by zero equals zero so if you make a bet in the investing role that you then lose all the money

[50:35] Even 30 years of investing make it you go all that on one bet and you lose you lose it all

[50:39] You must use 30 years of good decisions with one math decision

[50:43] And that's the thing that I people

[50:45] Calculate when they think about the personal rate if we're going back to these flowers like I've had earlier

[50:50] If I have this one broken flower

[50:53] If forever affects the way this book analytics

[50:56] Imagine you give this to your wife your girlfriend and you're so there here you go if you like

[51:01] It's such a high-sour

[51:02] Then it distracts from all the other flowers that you have and so now swine making sure that you

[51:09] Never risk your reputation to make the short money so that you can let you go

[51:15] Well keep compounding let the party keep going

[51:18] He's one of the smartest and hardest long-term business decisions

[51:22] Because we buy a certain only fan tomorrow

[51:24] I'll bet you probably a lot of money

[51:26] It's like but it would be like this broken flower, but it would currently affect some people receiving and the brand

[51:31] And I also want to know now we finished reputation

[51:34] We're talking about

[51:36] Compatitive when there's big fancy words from a messaging about an average and sting richer

[51:41] Compattings with something what's wise unto itself all right, so I've a hundred dollars and you come down that 10% a year next year

[51:49] It'll be about 110 dollars the year after that I had 10% like this and I've already just a 1.1

[51:56] Right, then the next year one thirty three and so forth and so you notice that even though the time between

[52:03] These intervals remain insane the actual amount that were growing continues to rise for

[52:09] Fortunately to how much we had which is how a

[52:11] The Lord can have a hundred billion dollars and so many another 15 billion dollars this coming year

[52:19] Right, is because he understands the power of

[52:22] Continental they call it day-fonder of the world and the last decade

[52:26] Warp up to seeing more money that they made you know for the rest of his career and after because the longer you do it the better

[52:33] Yes, which is why something is fairly well-filling fun levels are so important

[52:37] Compatting only a lot to be able to long-term perspective because this early first four years

[52:41] I mean decent but now bad, but if you do that over 30 years it becomes unbelievable and it's also why you have to

[52:48] Not diversify because if we were then splitting this up and so you know

[52:51] Maybe I'm gonna set this we're interrupting the compounding process and

[52:56] Equity is one of these single greatest compounding vehicles because you can't

[53:00] Reoutake capital within the same vehicle right and a simple example that would be like if I have

[53:07] 10 locations and I can grow by 10 percent

[53:11] Every month then I go from 10 locations to 11 locations the next month

[53:15] I get to 12 locations that month I get 13 and by 20th month

[53:19] I get a two-up case. It gets 22 and 24 and it compounds because by that time

[53:23] You'll go to the infrastructure to sustain the facts for peace

[53:27] So pandexpress they had 600 locations this year they had 2000

[53:33] At the beginning of the year that took them 45 years you guys it this is one year

[53:40] They can reward this one year

[53:43] Then they did an any prior year before that and that's why you just have to stick with it for a longer to time

[53:48] And this is one of the things that people won't realize about restarting me over your 10 to your 11

[53:54] You might be incredibly bored with your business, but if you go from a hundred million to a hundred and ten million

[54:00] You grew by 10 million and even though this new thing might sound more exciting

[54:05] You're what but what if you go to a zero to 10 million year one?

[54:09] He's really unlikely and so this is where all of the compounding is locked even though it's incredibly boring

[54:16] But if there's one thing like you might be right down boring this will make you rich

[54:20] What if everybody's told what he was at the money isn't paid in the buy or the cell?

[54:25] It's made in the wing and the wing is the hardest part because you have to sit with your hands here

[54:30] Pockets at the side that the original plan that you had was a good plan

[54:33] And the hard part of the plan is sticking with the plan not doing the play like deciding what your gonna work out as a heart

[54:39] Deciding that it's gonna be three years a week for the years and art. It's continuing to do it for the entire time

[54:44] This would make it hard and

[54:46] I want to find a turn for you guys really up for me, which is patience right?

[54:50] I don't know like B patient B patient what does that actually mean being patient?

[54:54] Simply means figuring out what's in in the meantime

[54:57] It's time to make this video. I'm being patient for my stocks that are right right now

[55:02] While I'm making this video I've been patient for the cut that I wanted to lose some fat

[55:06] While I'm making this video right now

[55:08] I'm being patient for some of our portfolio companies to capitalize on the rednesses that were making way down

[55:12] But I'm making a video and so if we have to use it when you stick to the planet

[55:16] Sometimes the best thing you do is if you know it in the letter B

[55:19] We should be in the you don't get to rub the compounding process and there's a famous setting that's sending patience in impulse control

[55:26] And there's one big learning that I think all of those to learn from so there's a test for the workflow

[55:31] It tests they took little kids and they put a bar full in front of them and then we 30 minutes and then they could eat the marshmallow

[55:36] Now the beat the marshmallow during the 30 minutes they did get a second marshmallow

[55:41] If they were in a week 30 minutes and not eat the marshmallow

[55:44] Then they would give them a second marshmallow at the end

[55:47] So they got done all the rewards since it's been for waiting 30 minutes

[55:49] Now what's interesting is that the dummy the difference between kids who

[55:54] Who versus and the ones who could and obviously long term they figured out that people could wait and delay grad deviations

[56:01] The ones were more successful

[56:02] But the strategies that they'd use to delay was not that they stared at the marshmallow that used to rot out

[56:09] The kids were successful didn't have a lot of different things some of them went to a different time of the group

[56:14] They just just did it themselves from the marshmallow itself some of them started singing songs to themselves

[56:20] Other of them took the marshmallow and put it in their pockets so they couldn't see anymore

[56:24] And so the big things that they had the skills to figure out what to do in the meantime

[56:29] And so the more still you are the more ways to win and that's why building skills so important

[56:34] And it's so important because it allows you to be patient and gives you something to do even the time while you allow your master plan to come

[56:41] For mission without being like a smarter than you are to begin with

[56:44] So this includes almost the difference for dichroning sex and today level free of well-building

[56:51] So let's

[56:53] But wait Alex you left that box

[56:55] I've done the relations

[56:57] That brings us to the very last level which could be a bit above the levels the level of level of levels on the business

[57:02] That's what I did that's what you know to say enjoy well

[57:05] Let's talk about it. You might be there really just two levels of wealth

[57:09] Love the one is that you have all of your personal needs taken care of the second level of wealth is the unlimited level of all features that you just always want to keep you using

[57:17] What he to make more money and that means that you've progressed from solving personal needs to play in game

[57:22] And so I think a lot of people do is they can never figure out with enough gifts for them

[57:26] And there was a period of my life earlier on where I was like okay

[57:30] Let me figure out all these rich people things. I want to definitely I was in this go out to all the next

[57:34] Trust routes every single night the thing is that the link the one percent is actually not that expensive

[57:38] If you apply five in cost about five fifty thousand dollars for month if you want to eat out

[57:43] Every hour a week at the nicest trust routes of you know five hundred dollar theirs every single night

[57:48] 15,000 month if you want to sell it see we sell everything here so they pay what's probably five grand

[57:54] But right I'll top down to say you want to go and buy out their clothing so that's another 15 thousand dollars

[58:00] For them so let's say you spend five thousand dollars month on

[58:03] Nutrition instant another five thousand dollars month on their being the form of such

[58:07] Put it all right. Let's just call him cool hundred thousand dollars per month

[58:10] I've expenses for oh we've got to work with it. Let's let's look some good ball

[58:14] Let's put another 50 year in a month

[58:16] But so 150 thousand ones month he's just under two million dollars a year and he knows after tax

[58:22] Right so maybe close to four million dollars a year income

[58:25] Then that's a good amount of money. He's actually not a lot in the amounts of seamfix

[58:30] What I mean is that you can

[58:33] ball out all the way also off of the rest of your life on this level of income

[58:37] What I would encourage you to do is actually figure out what he is good for me

[58:41] Maybe it's worth it to take these things and see which of them you actually enjoy and I think he was really down

[58:47] For me by the belly and realize that didn't care and then just I gave it back six months later

[58:51] It's a little back I lost and so I think the big shield the argument is that you figure out what your

[58:55] Personal dreamless is there a lot of people have these sheer shows like I would be a none there

[59:00] It's a why because you can just make this for the rest of your lives and ball out

[59:05] But really now you can probably live incredibly comfortably on 50 thousand dollars

[59:11] Like still one percent living unbelievable well-flipy stuff for fifty thousand dollars a month after taxes

[59:18] So I think if you put what is food look like right?

[59:22] What does travel look like what is clothing look like?

[59:27] What does the experiences look like?

[59:29] What is helpful like and you start cutting an actual number to it you realize that when you actually

[59:35] New South very personal teachers to getting a less than the original we thought and so that brings me to the next last look

[59:40] This which is the game itself

[59:42] Now there's a recent deadline podcast is called the game and it's because at this point

[59:47] I play the game the anxiety joy the game and so the whole kind of have been enjoying it while is not about

[59:52] Not working

[59:53] I think this is one of the big mess you might feel that way now

[59:57] That you can't want you to and the fact that you're having with you too is one of the reasons they might not ever get the love you want

[60:03] And so it's not about not working

[60:06] It's about getting addicted

[60:12] to freedom

[60:15] And freedom again

[60:17] doesn't need a word

[60:18] It means you have an option to work and so I believe that

[60:23] Humans

[60:24] All our best when we do work this worth doing when we have the purpose that we derive for any effort and the total

[60:31] That we put it every day and you get we here

[60:33] We don't have it opposing forces to strong issue if you live with it and you never left even close to your medicine

[60:38] You've been struggling with muscle and I think it's the same thing with mental strength

[60:42] Unless you're continually raising the ball or eventually actually it's used to lose it

[60:46] It's so most of us want to become the best version of ourselves in order to become the best versus ourself

[60:51] We have to increase the difficulty of the level that we're playing on

[60:55] Imagine playing a game that you've been on your time, so then you put it on the easiest level. He gets bored

[61:00] We think we want easier, but we don't we want to do things that we enjoy more and

[61:06] Enjoyment and easier and not necessarily the same thing

[61:08] It's what we're trying to enjoy our wealth. It's finding the things that we can lose ourselves in

[61:16] For the rest of our lives and being able to kick the fact that that thing makes shifts over time

[61:22] It shows what it looks like or it feels like if if you fix the order all the way to the end of the movie as a reminder

[61:29] You die and you can't take any of it with you

[61:33] And so even if you if you finish your life with this big pile of money at the end you still have to push it over the edge of the cliff

[61:41] Right or it just falls off to other people whose hands

[61:51] Yeah

[61:53] So

[61:54] Remind myself of that fact every single day

[61:57] The whole point of the game is to play the game and by playing the game we win the game

[62:04] Because the best games in life will finish us the best games in life or even games not five

[62:09] games

[62:10] I'll play the difference the point is until you die married the point is the same

[62:15] When it comes to business the point is into

[62:18] When at business the point is standing in business and literally keep playing and so when we think about the greatest teams

[62:27] That we play as humans we have to take the same fit in frame or

[62:31] We fool ourselves into a false finite prison that we keep

[62:36] Wuttering why we don't feel like winning when we get to finish on because we never realized that there was no finish line to begin with and

[62:43] The fact that we're playing the game so sure are victory

[62:47] By it's very nature

[62:49] And so this realization how mean refrained how I thought about spending my time

[62:54] So that I could enjoy my wealth the point for me

[62:57] Sustain the business and see why I can become in this process the point is to be a see what does it look like at 20 years of marriage with health

[63:03] It's not that like cool. I've been training for 20 years. I'm in decent shape

[63:07] I wonder what it looks like on how the at 50 because if you're only in shape for six weeks if you're like our six months of your life

[63:12] We can see years of your life from cares if you only have a good marriage for a few years of your life

[63:17] Who cares if you only in business and then go out of business really quickly and then get out of the game who cares and

[63:23] Which is why could fix it take away that you have and this is from

[63:30] Which is in Churchill you win as old you know good

[63:33] And so that's how you enjoy your life and your wealth and the issue of burn

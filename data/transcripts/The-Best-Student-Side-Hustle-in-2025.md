[00:00] The best businesses start for students where you can earn $1,120 per day in profit, not revenue.

[00:07] You can do it while you're still in school and for anyone who's not in school,

[00:11] you could still do it only four hours per day. And at the end of the video, I'll tell you the

[00:15] super say and version of this second make you a million dollars a year. It was one of the three

[00:19] businesses that I almost started before deciding to start my GM and the business was test prep and

[00:25] or tutoring. Most people go about test prep tutoring the wrong way. You don't want to sell tutoring

[00:29] you want to sell the outcome of tutoring, which is to get into either a job that's going to

[00:34] pay more or be able to pass a test of some sort or ideally the standardized test which in my

[00:38] opinion are the most viable tests that you can help some para for because when you get into a

[00:42] better school either college or business school that has a material difference on the network that

[00:47] those people hang out with. The companies that recruit from those schools and the average salary

[00:51] and earning capacity of those people. College was the original bus stop. It was anybody can come in

[00:56] and you will make more money as a result of going through this training. Here's the simplest model

[01:00] that works. Very time constrained that anyone can do. Number one is that you don't do one on one. You

[01:05] do one too many but you don't do unlimited because you're probably not good enough to do that yet.

[01:09] But you can do semi-private. The reason semi-private is one of the most profitable service models

[01:14] is that you can charge two thirds of what you can do one on one but you can do it with eight times as many

[01:19] people. You have a group of eight students. It's still a small group setting. They still get the

[01:22] personalized attention but when they're taking problems you can have them take turn doing the

[01:26] problem versus teaching someone on the problem. If you charge $60 an hour and you're doing one on one

[01:29] which is the typical model that most people will do. You worked four hours. You would make a total

[01:33] of $240. Versus is doing one on eight and charging $35 with eight people there. You make 1100 for the same

[01:40] for hours. This is when we talk about opportunity vehicles. Four and a half times more money.

[01:44] Her unit of time. Because you have this model and not the one on one model. From a money math

[01:49] perspective, you charge 35 bucks. It's cheaper than the 60 that someone would charge 101. You might be

[01:54] better but you have eight people. You're making $280 an hour. You do four of those hours a day. You're

[01:59] making $1100 a day for four hours of work. You're one of those people who was really good student

[02:04] didn't know what to do. You could make more doing this than you could do a doctor. Not have to go to

[02:08] school. Not have to take loans. And still have your entire day and just work from six to 10. Not bad.

[02:14] What's cool about this? You could do it at free libraries. I got tutoring. I did it at free library.

[02:18] She didn't have to pay for that. I got to do it just at cost. All you have to do would be to get

[02:23] students that would pay you three times a week and you would need 50 students to do that.

[02:27] $35 a session would be a very nice sweet spot that most people could afford and you price

[02:31] that again based on the fact that they would make $100,000 more a year. They go to these better

[02:35] schools. In terms of packaging this, I would prefer to get people to prepay because I don't like

[02:40] transactional one-off things because it ties it to close to the time I'm spending. But I would work

[02:45] it out so that it would be $35 a session. I could probably estimate in order for us to increase your

[02:50] trial or student or your own score every thousand problems statistically gives you an extra 20

[02:56] point. Whatever that math would be that would be obviously a core part of my selling pit. We have to

[02:59] get you to do this many problems which is going to take this much time. And so I would sell to go,

[03:04] which is how much do you want to increase your test score? I'm a curriculum perspective. You have a

[03:08] three-day curriculum that you teach to class A and class B separately. And then the last day

[03:13] you do is to make up for those people but they would still have to pay the same rate

[03:16] that that way they don't fall behind. So you literally don't have to do anything during the

[03:19] day. You could work a full-time job. You could play video games all day and then just do two

[03:22] during four hours. Test prep is extremely repeatable if someone does the work. They did a research

[03:28] study. The test scores that people have on SATs and GMAT is directly proportional to the number of

[03:33] problems they solved before taking the test. So it's very clear input output equation. The more

[03:38] problem someone does, the better their scores are. When I learned that one research graph, I bought

[03:42] every single GMAT phone book that I could find at Barnes Noble's and I did Olethe and that's

[03:47] how I scored above Harvard's GMAT and it took me four months to do that. I worked personally four

[03:52] hours a day doing problems. On Saturday I would do a test to test my score to see if I got better.

[03:57] Kind of like chess where there's patterned recognition. I was more motivated to be good at this

[04:01] test than any test I've ever taken which why I got some motivated to help other people do it too.

[04:05] Just why I started thinking about that business. So if you are somebody who was pretty good at school

[04:09] was pretty good at standardized tests. This is a really great opportunity that you could make

[04:13] top one percent earning with milk capital out of pocket. No rental space, no build out. First thing

[04:18] to do is hit up your network. All the people that you know go knock doors. But also DMing people

[04:23] that are in your high school. But you can say, hey, do you know anybody who needs test prep

[04:26] services? I got this score and I moved my score from X to Y just doing this. I'm walking people

[04:31] through it so that they can get the same test scores because I was able to get into a better

[04:34] college as a result of this score. Here's where I was. Here's what happened. Here's the

[04:38] method I used here's the outcome of the improvement. I would also be DMing parents and adults

[04:42] because I have no shame. If you want to start a business you should probably get rid of your shame

[04:45] because you're going to get embarrassed. So you just ask lots of people and if you ask enough people

[04:48] and say, hey, I'm giving a free session to show how my whole method work and I'll do a free

[04:52] and if it makes sense for them awesome. And with that is it's really more of a half assessment into

[04:55] a salesman. You do a little bit of at the beginning show them one easy win that they can have. They

[05:00] see an improvement and then you transition to like this is how I teach you like that. You give the

[05:04] first five to 10 for free and you do that. You say you have to do your homework and every day you

[05:08] don't your homework I will fill you. You have some skin in the game and then they might even like

[05:11] that where they're going to be way more motivated to actually do the work and then in so doing

[05:15] they will get even better test scores. The end of that there's three things you're going to ask for them.

[05:18] Feedback on things that could be better. You are testimonial and you're going to ask them for a referral.

[05:22] There's the big three that you're going to do in exchange for doing the work for free. If you get

[05:25] more than 10 people who really want then just what you can start charging. Once you have the referral

[05:29] and the testimonials post the testimonials let me know if you're interested to very simple. They post

[05:34] anybody who engages you can DM them with better offer of that was my first 10. My next 10 I'm doing

[05:38] for half off. Those are not super hard write hooks because they're inspiring for a lot of people

[05:42] people think it's cool and then you have call to actions which drive into your DMs and then you

[05:46] can upsell them with that. Beyond that the other two ways would be reaching out to people who you don't

[05:50] know not just people you do know and then running ads. Most people could just do people they know

[05:55] referrals going to sports teams where they need tutoring and saying hey I know some of these guys are

[06:00] worried about getting in the school. I know they're not trying to go to Ivy but they need to get a

[06:03] buff and axe to get in with their sports scholarship or whatever. You can go to the teams it spreads

[06:07] really quickly and then all the little cross dudes are all the hockey dudes. Good come at the same time

[06:11] after practice. If you do a good job the word a mouthless bread. That's it. It doesn't have to be a

[06:15] complicated amount. Maybe take you six months to build up your student base to be at 1000 bucks or 1100

[06:19] bucks a day. Would you rather do that then spend four years in college go into that and not make money

[06:25] the entire time and have to work full time to do that your fall. So you could do all that stuff that I just

[06:29] said on your own with basically no help and get yourself to a top 1% earning income which is

[06:33] better than anything you're going to get after college anyways and you could do it in six months without

[06:36] risking the money the time in the debt. But if you wanted to go super sad you can have other people

[06:41] do those things for you because then you just get really good at getting the students to sign up and say yes

[06:45] and then you templatize your process for how you get them to do more problems because that's the

[06:48] most predictable way of increasing their score and so then you have a teacher you can pay 50 bucks an hour.

[06:54] You make the spread between the 280 and the 50 and many teachers will have a lot of work for $50

[06:59] an hour and if you really wanted to run really crazy margins which I prefer to I like to have my

[07:03] service based margins to 80% or higher which means that my cost per unit below 56 so 50 works there.

[07:10] That means you can pay good people they could make more than they're making with the real job.

[07:13] They're happy to do it the students are happy to pay it because it's less than 101 and then

[07:17] all the while you get to scrape everything off the top without ever having risk and then those

[07:21] four hours you get back what do you do you promote more you market more you sell more you get more

[07:25] people in and you find other teachers so then what happens is you start getting a development pipeline

[07:29] for getting students in and a pipeline for getting teachers that hey teacher said 50 do you have

[07:32] any other teacher friends who you think would be good at this yeah I've got 10 friends who would love

[07:35] to make twice as much money in half the time great send them my way then you get a lot of teachers

[07:39] who are waiting for you to find them students and a lot of students that are ready to come in groups you

[07:43] want to go god mode you can do four teachers rather than one and they're now getting paid 50 bucks an

[07:48] hour you're still making your same 280 but you're making 1100ish per hour because you got four

[07:53] guys working so at the end of the day just that half day for hours with four people working you're

[07:58] making 4400 day and you paid each of them 200 dollars each 800 dollars off 4400 you're looking at

[08:04] 3600 a day does anybody know what it takes to make a million dollars a year in income so it

[08:08] says 3300 today you're at 36 that's what you now make a million dollars a year you're more than above

[08:13] the top one percent and you do it with four employees that are part time and some hustle

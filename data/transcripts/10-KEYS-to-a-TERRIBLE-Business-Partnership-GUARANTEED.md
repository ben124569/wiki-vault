[00:00] When you're in a business relationship, you're in a marriage.

[00:01] And their extra kicker of life is going to get dragged into the business.

[00:04] I promise you.

[00:08] In this video, I want to give you the keys to having a terrible terrible partnership.

[00:11] And the reason I work with talk about it in this perspective is because my,

[00:14] my big hero Charlie Moogra talked about inverted thinking as one of the best ways to solve

[00:18] problems. So rather than think, how do I have an amazing partnership?

[00:20] Let's think about how would I guarantee a miserable terrible partnership that would,

[00:24] uh, definitely ensue in a terrible breakup with lots of lawyers and all the paperwork.

[00:28] And just honestly, ideally, take forever and result in no benefit.

[00:32] All right. And if you don't hire my name's Alchimosi,

[00:34] I own acquisition.com to portfolio companies to have $100 million.

[00:36] I make these videos because I hope that you make lots and lots of money from them.

[00:39] And then hopefully you apply to become a portfolio company with us,

[00:41] as long as you're doing, you know, three to let's say $20 million a year.

[00:44] And ideally, an internet business.

[00:46] Now that being said, let's rock and roll on how to have a terrible partnership.

[00:49] Now, as somebody who has a lot of partnerships, um, it is taking me a very long time to get here.

[00:52] And I have learned a lot along the way in the beauty of having stories.

[00:56] It's that you can get the lessons without the scars.

[00:57] And so I will give you, let's see, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

[01:02] 10 different things that you can do to guarantee absolutely a trotaceous terrible partnership that you wish you could just not live anymore.

[01:08] Right. That is what's going to happen if we can make this partnership as terrible as we're going to shoot for here.

[01:12] All right. So number one, is that we're going to make sure that they have the exact same knowledge basis you.

[01:16] All right. So this person that you're going to do business with knows the exact same stuff of you.

[01:19] There's no stuff that they know that you don't know.

[01:20] All right. Because that way, one of you is a unnecessary.

[01:23] All right. And so this is a great way to have a terrible start to a partnership.

[01:27] One of you being a necessary to begin with, which means both of you are giving away half your equity for no incremental benefit.

[01:32] It's also not very good for the business because why would you do that?

[01:34] So that being said, number one, have the same knowledge base and maybe even if we're being crazy, which we are, right.

[01:39] Throw in the same experiences. Right.

[01:41] If you both work the same place doing the same thing, why not start a business together doing the exact same thing?

[01:45] Brilliant.

[01:46] I know.

[01:46] All right. So number two is time, right.

[01:48] Make sure that they have the same amount of time as you.

[01:51] All right.

[01:52] Or disproportionate.

[01:53] And what I mean there is the big three-on partnerships is knowledge money time, right.

[01:56] Which means they either have to have knowledge you don't have.

[01:58] They gotta have money you don't have.

[01:59] They gotta have time you don't have.

[02:00] Right.

[02:00] And so if you have no time, make sure they don't have time to, right.

[02:04] Now if you do have time and they have time, then you're fine.

[02:06] But the thing is, is then you'd have to look at one of the other three parts of this equation.

[02:09] In order to make sure that's still a terrible partnership.

[02:10] All right. So make sure that you're misaligned on time.

[02:13] All right. The next one is money.

[02:14] If you're getting to a partnership, if one of you has money, and the other doesn't,

[02:17] then that's value that's being out of the relationship.

[02:19] But if you're going to partner with somebody and they don't have money that you don't have.

[02:22] They don't have knowledge that you don't have.

[02:23] And they don't have time that you don't have.

[02:24] They might have to do the partnership.

[02:26] I don't know.

[02:26] But it is a great way to have a tablet partnership, which is what the purpose of this video is.

[02:29] Now that being said, let's say that somehow we still figured out a way that we got in a relationship

[02:33] where one of us didn't have the knowledge, they have the time written out the money that the other person had.

[02:37] We got together.

[02:37] Okay. Cool.

[02:38] There's still more ways that we can, we can torpedo this thing.

[02:40] Just wait.

[02:40] Buckle up.

[02:41] So the next one is that we can make sure that we have different expectations of one another and the business.

[02:45] All right.

[02:45] So it's like, hey, what do I expect you to do?

[02:47] What do you expect me to do?

[02:48] Right.

[02:48] And those expectations, we want to make sure.

[02:50] And this is number five is that there's no agreements.

[02:52] We don't record it anywhere.

[02:53] We don't write it down.

[02:54] We do it on a handshake because we're old school.

[02:55] Yeah.

[02:56] Great way to have a terrible business relationship.

[02:57] And the reason that people don't want to do that is because usually they don't want to have the

[03:00] hard conversations.

[03:01] All right.

[03:01] They don't want to say what happens if this goes wrong.

[03:03] Right.

[03:04] And like, what do you expect you really expect me to take the trash out every day?

[03:06] Like, they want to have this unspoken expectation.

[03:09] You have unspoken expectations.

[03:10] Do you even know what's going to be magical?

[03:11] Where you don't actually have to have hard conversations with people.

[03:14] And if you can't have our conversation with a partner before even doing business before you

[03:17] are even married before you, there is even money or stakes on the table or equity value

[03:21] that's been grown, then do your God.

[03:22] You're not going to have a good conversation at the end.

[03:24] All right.

[03:24] So if someone's like, I don't do agreements, just walk away.

[03:26] I just, I've been doing this like just walk away.

[03:29] It's only like very, very, very weird people do that.

[03:31] Like banks.

[03:32] Banks don't just give you money without expectations.

[03:34] Like, come on.

[03:34] Like, this is real world.

[03:35] And I used to think, I remember early on.

[03:37] I heard someone told me that and I was like, Oh, I don't want to be the guy.

[03:40] He's like, on the type of person that if you can shake your hand, then blah, blah.

[03:44] And I just don't, I just don't trust people that much.

[03:46] So the idea for me is, make sure the paper says we need to say, but then trust the person,

[03:51] right?

[03:52] Which is like, I hope that we never have like, we write these contracts with the intention

[03:54] of never having to look at them.

[03:55] Right?

[03:56] But we still use the contract as a vehicle to facilitate dialogue around difficult topics

[04:00] and to have shared expectations in a way that we both understand them and agree.

[04:04] Right?

[04:04] That is the purpose of the contract.

[04:05] It's not to get lawyers involved.

[04:07] Purpose of the contract is that we have clear expectation.

[04:08] That is why contracts exist.

[04:10] Clear expectations on agreements.

[04:11] All right.

[04:11] So if we're making sure that we have a terrible partnership, we got to have all the same knowledge.

[04:14] We got to have disproportionate time and money.

[04:16] Right?

[04:17] So all those things, time money knowledge, we're all matched on those, which means that one of us isn't necessary.

[04:21] On top of that, we have different expectations, we didn't write it down, so there's no agreements.

[04:24] And there's no expectations that we've been communicated about what you're going to do what I'm going to do.

[04:27] All right.

[04:28] Now, the next one, this is big one.

[04:29] Give away everything.

[04:30] So make sure that you give away everything in the partnership and do it just proportionate amount of work

[04:33] at the onset.

[04:34] Because that way you'll just definitely make sure that you can go on a resentment towards the other person.

[04:37] And the flip side can be true, too.

[04:38] If you know the other person can be doing a lot of work, then you think yourself, oh, well,

[04:41] I'm going to squeeze as much out of them as I possibly can.

[04:44] What's going to happen?

[04:45] They're going to resent you and they're going to try to renegotiate later once reality sets in.

[04:48] So if you can think a few steps ahead of the person, rather than saying like, oh, I'm going to get them,

[04:52] just say like, hey, I don't know if this is going to be equitable in the future.

[04:54] Like give them more.

[04:55] And you'll actually start to create a relationship rather than a negotiated contractual agreement,

[04:59] which at the end of the day, that's all contracts are supposed to do is just outline the expectations between two parties.

[05:03] That's it.

[05:04] All right.

[05:04] Now, the next one is that we want to make sure that we have not, we want to have a misaligned three things.

[05:09] Mission, values, and vision.

[05:10] All right, which means that we don't actually want to take this business to the same place.

[05:13] And this may sound hilarious to you, but you would be amazed at the amount of partners that we get on the phone with.

[05:18] They're like, what do you guys want to do this business and what does it like?

[05:20] I think what you go this one, the other is like, I think what you go that way.

[05:22] I'm like, I think that you should figure that out, right?

[05:24] Or one of you shouldn't be here, right?

[05:25] Figure it out.

[05:25] All right.

[05:26] Which is where do we want to go?

[05:27] And the next one is the values, which is how are we going to get there, right?

[05:29] What are the things that are important to us about how we deal with other humans, right?

[05:32] What are those values?

[05:33] And if some people have different values, it becomes very difficult to do business, even if you want to

[05:36] accomplish the same thing because you want to do it different ways.

[05:39] And then it'll create endless strife and conflict throughout.

[05:41] Now, the last one is what you can consider lifestyle, right?

[05:44] Which is what do you similar interests lifestyle?

[05:47] It's very difficult to do business with somebody.

[05:48] If you're like, you're a Dave Ramsey saver and you, you know, you're, you live far below

[05:53] your means and you're doing business with somebody who lives far above their means and goes

[05:57] into debt all the time because the thing is, is when you're in a business relationship,

[06:00] you're in a marriage and their extra kick of your life is going to get dragged into the business.

[06:03] I, per, am, is you.

[06:05] I, per, am, is you.

[06:06] It is going to get dragged in, right?

[06:08] And so you've got to look just like you, you married the girl you married the family, that

[06:11] whole thing.

[06:12] It's the same thing with business.

[06:13] If like, they've got all this crazy stuff going on in their personal life.

[06:16] It's a great way to guarantee that that stuff is going to trickle into your business.

[06:20] And the thing is, is if you have an unreliable partner, creates an unreliable relationship,

[06:23] which creates an unreliable business.

[06:24] And so it's a great way to have a terrible partnership.

[06:26] All right.

[06:27] And so when we're thinking about partners, big picture, I give you two frameworks and then

[06:30] some in-between.

[06:31] So, a framework one is that they got to have knowledge money or time that you don't have.

[06:33] If both of you have the exact same experience, knowledge, time and money, one of you,

[06:38] isn't required.

[06:38] And now crazy.

[06:39] The thing is, is just because you need something.

[06:40] For example, if I need an accountant for a business, doesn't mean I have to partner

[06:43] with my accountant.

[06:44] It means I have to pay them for services.

[06:45] So just because you have a need doesn't mean they have to have equity.

[06:47] All right.

[06:48] So big a hamo in here.

[06:49] If you're like, well, I don't know how to do that.

[06:50] He does.

[06:51] It's like, well, can you pay someone to do it?

[06:52] Like, equity is the most expensive thing that you give up in a relationship.

[06:54] So you want to make sure, especially when it built something big, they're giving away equity

[06:57] to people who are going to really drive the growth.

[06:59] And you have to see this thing 10 years in the future, which no one thinks 10 years

[07:01] in the future anyways, which is why everyone's small.

[07:03] Okay.

[07:03] So boom.

[07:04] So knowledge, money, time, you got to check those boxes, make sure that you're lying there.

[07:07] Next one is expectations agreements.

[07:08] All right.

[07:09] Make sure that they're equitable.

[07:10] Make sure that they're well-installed and make sure that they're documented.

[07:12] Right.

[07:13] If you do those things, then it's very, very as much less likely that you're going to have

[07:15] a turbo partnership.

[07:16] You can solve them.

[07:17] But it's much less likely.

[07:18] And point of this video is to guarantee a turbo partnership.

[07:20] All right.

[07:21] Now, the next big framework is that mission values and similar interests.

[07:23] It actually works the same way in marriages.

[07:25] It doesn't partnerships and to be real.

[07:26] It's very similar.

[07:27] So you got to make sure that you want to do the same thing with the business

[07:29] big picture.

[07:30] You got to make sure you want to do it the same way.

[07:32] And then you got to have similar interests and lifestyles, right?

[07:34] Which is make sure that they don't have a messy life, which is you want to be proud

[07:36] to associate with the other person that you're doing business with.

[07:38] And I'm saying proud.

[07:39] Not okay with, but proud to associate with them.

[07:41] You want other people to meet them just like you want to meet the, you know,

[07:43] the girl meets the parents.

[07:44] You want to be proud to present this person not like a aircraft, right?

[07:46] Big picture.

[07:47] Great ways to guarantee a terrible partnership.

[07:49] As if you do all those things.

[07:50] All right.

[07:50] So on the flip side, make sure that if time money and knowledge that you don't have, right?

[07:54] Either they got money, you don't have, they got time, you don't have, they have

[07:57] a technology don't have or experience, right?

[07:58] So they can bring something to say that you don't have.

[08:00] So one of you are both of you are required.

[08:01] And that the company grows based on the shared skill sets that both of you have.

[08:04] All right.

[08:05] You want to make sure that you set expectations that you document them.

[08:08] And then you make sure that they're equitable.

[08:09] All right.

[08:09] Because if you do that, then it's very unlikely that you're going to fail.

[08:12] All right.

[08:12] And the next one is that you want to make sure that there's a line of mission,

[08:15] values, and similar interests.

[08:16] You want to do what the types of people who see the world the same way as you have

[08:20] the biggest long-term goals.

[08:21] And they want to do the process of getting from where you are to where you want

[08:24] to go the same way you do.

[08:25] And the easiest limit test is if you present both of you with the same data,

[08:28] which you make the same decision.

[08:29] If these answers, yes, then you'll have far less conflict in your partnership over the

[08:33] long haul.

[08:33] And so the idea is, can I find people who have complementary skill sets, but a line

[08:38] mission values and interests?

[08:39] And if you can do that, you can make room for a magical rather than terrible

[08:43] partnership.

[08:43] All right.

[08:43] Keeping awesome imagination lots of love.

[08:45] And I'll catch you guys in the next video.

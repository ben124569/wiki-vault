[00:00] How do I maintain being a husband that is present with my wife?

[00:03] Well, also consistently grinding to achieve Michael.

[00:05] You don't.

[00:06] Well, I can do a special end of your Q&A couples edition.

[00:09] You guys have questions and we may or may not have good answers to them in joining.

[00:13] What do you do for dates?

[00:14] Expensive restaurants, chill at home, et cetera.

[00:16] I think we got to expensive restaurants sometimes.

[00:19] And sometimes we chill at home and just like watch movies and do nothing.

[00:23] I was say that our need for dates is to Porsche for how much we're working.

[00:26] So if we are working a lot, we will need to take dates.

[00:29] Because if we are not working a ton, we have enough time with one another intermittently

[00:32] that I feel like our need for like carving out time goes down a lot.

[00:35] For me, I delineate date night versus going out to eat because for context we've got to

[00:40] eat pretty much every night of the week.

[00:41] And so what makes it special if you go out all the time?

[00:44] Like is it the fanciness of the restaurant?

[00:45] Not really because we do a lot of business dinners and things like that.

[00:48] So we've got to like five restaurants probably three nights a week.

[00:50] We're going to give you a chance more night.

[00:51] Well, now we've got a Jimmy Johnson too.

[06:40] We don't have to pull eye.

[06:41] We don't have to pull eye.

[06:42] We don't have to pull eye.

[06:44] We've only had one real big argument in our careers.

[06:47] And it was about business.

[06:49] It was something about relationships.

[06:51] Do you train or do fitness together if not why not?

[06:54] I don't think I'm a good training partner.

[06:56] Historically, I don't train well with many people.

[06:59] Like I like having a trainer or two yell at me.

[07:01] You also don't like that trainer who's yelling at you.

[07:03] To be your spouse.

[07:04] Correct.

[07:05] And that's how Alex trains people.

[07:07] So instead of the him yelling at me and me doing exercise,

[07:10] I just go, why are you yelling at me?

[07:12] Actually, I think now if we train together,

[07:15] we can be completely different to be fair.

[07:16] I actually just like going to gym and listening to music and not talking to anybody.

[07:19] Yeah, so we go to the gym at the same time and we don't work out together.

[07:22] I work at the same time.

[07:23] We love the car right there and the car right back.

[07:25] Yeah, we actually, yeah, we enjoyed the car right.

[07:27] When did you know she was the one that was a fit for you as your spouse

[07:31] and heard the same to you?

[07:32] Once we increased the anti-handly nose, the one.

[07:34] You looked at me creepily and they were like, that's how I know.

[07:37] She looked at me.

[07:38] Like I was like, it's me going.

[07:40] I had a handful of moments.

[07:42] Big moment, number one was when you went to Hawaii and soldier ass off

[07:45] when we weren't together.

[07:47] So we split for like 30 days so she could do a launch.

[07:49] I just had a head on collision DUI.

[07:52] My mother was in the hospital.

[07:53] I just split with two different business partners

[07:57] in the last 30 days.

[07:58] I just lost all my money.

[08:00] Like it was all of this happened in a 60 day period.

[08:03] Honestly, it was just because she stood tall when everything else was crumbling around me.

[08:06] I didn't deserve the loyalty that she chose to show me.

[08:09] You stood tall and like basically followed through with my commitments

[08:12] even though you didn't owe me anything.

[08:13] Because I basically made the agreement to the cinema that we'd launch it.

[08:16] But like we broke up, she could have just left and gone home.

[08:18] Like that, she could have done that.

[08:19] She didn't.

[08:20] When I lost everything the second time.

[08:22] Laila was like, I would sleep with you when her birth became to that.

[08:26] I was like, I like you, but like I respect that if you don't find me

[08:30] respectable at this moment because I have nothing.

[08:32] She was like, I'm in.

[08:33] And so that was, I mean honestly, there's probably too big moments for me.

[08:35] Yeah, we had all the hardship in the beginning, really.

[08:37] Like all the hard stuff has before we got married.

[08:39] What about you?

[08:40] Um, I didn't even rest that.

[08:41] Yeah, four year moments.

[08:43] One of them was after you got the DUI and real winner.

[08:48] No, I mean, and then I was like, what's he going to do next?

[08:51] You just completely turn shit around.

[08:53] When you see someone there in like their darkest moments,

[08:55] like what are they going to do?

[08:57] And he just went right through it and picked his shit up.

[09:02] And it was like, I'm not going to fucking indulge myself in that.

[09:05] And I respected that a lot.

[09:06] And I would say the second time is when nine, ten months in the relationship.

[09:10] And I felt like, I wonder if he's ever going to let me in.

[09:14] And we were at, you're one of your old gyms.

[09:16] And somebody was saying something.

[09:17] And then you looked to me and you said, well, I'd really like your opinion.

[09:20] And I was like, and in that moment I was like, I think he's making an effort

[09:24] to be more cooperative.

[09:26] And then he did.

[09:27] And then you like fat, like very quickly accelerated in terms of like your team.

[09:31] And then you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like, I think you're like

[10:01] a character and they're a respectable person.

[10:04] It's much easier in this moment to be like, I'm proud to be married to this person.

[10:07] And you know, you're not going to be feeling super romantic most of your life.

[10:11] Like you're going to be, you know, we're going to your job.

[10:14] You're going to be with friends.

[10:15] You're going to be out and running errands.

[10:16] You're going to be stressed.

[10:16] You're going to be dealing with life shit.

[10:18] We're with family.

[10:19] You're going to have kids like all these things.

[10:20] And so it's like in all of those moments outside of like the fairy tale, 60 minutes,

[10:25] every two weeks you get like, how do you feel about that person?

[10:28] Do you ever have communication issues?

[10:30] If not, what do you do to communicate so well?

[10:32] Ooh, little assumption there.

[10:33] If yes, how do you resolve them?

[10:34] I think that we're fairly good at recognizing when we're not communicating well.

[10:38] And we usually try a different method of communicating.

[10:40] We step away for a second.

[10:41] Often times we step away and then we write to each other.

[10:45] Yeah.

[10:46] That's probably the biggest go to.

[10:47] Because it gives us time to look at our thoughts before we say them to each other.

[10:52] Number one hack.

[10:53] We text on our angry, which is actually like seems like opposite.

[10:56] No, it's not like angry texting.

[10:58] We're not answering that thing each other.

[10:59] No, it's like let me clearly think out what I'm trying to say.

[11:02] And then I say it and then I like reread it and I re-hurt and I'm like, okay, she's saying this.

[11:05] You know, and we just creates more space between the communications.

[11:09] You can think about your response.

[11:10] And so for us, I think it's just decreased the emotionality that we resolve them to it.

[11:14] I do think that one of the keys besides the text thing is that we physically change environments.

[11:19] So it's like if you're in a tip in the kitchen, if she goes to living room and I go to my office

[11:22] and we text, it's like we both physically change environments.

[11:24] We're going to left the scene.

[11:25] It just diffuses a lot.

[11:27] I would also say that, you know, we are busy.

[11:29] And so often times we need to go do something and then we just come back to it later

[11:34] and half the time we're like, yeah, let's just fucking forget about it.

[11:36] Like we're like, it's not even like we were just both whatever in the moment.

[11:39] It doesn't matter.

[11:40] You were tired, I was wondering.

[11:41] Yeah, and I think one thing that we do well is we're willing to just let shit go.

[11:45] What are the non-negotiables in your relationship?

[11:47] If it's good question.

[11:48] Yeah, it's funny because I think we talked about them more on when we got married and now they're

[11:51] just facts of agreements.

[11:52] Agreements.

[11:53] Yeah, actually, they were the negotiables.

[11:55] They were like, what are the things that we both mutually agree to?

[11:58] And if we want to change one of these agreements, we both need to agree on it otherwise,

[12:01] we stick with what our commitment was.

[12:03] This will be, quote, unhealthy in the narrative world.

[12:06] But I actually told Layla, I was like, the business comes with foreign marriage.

[12:09] That was the first three years of our marriage.

[12:11] I'm not going to say that's great advice.

[12:13] No, I'm just being, I'm being candid.

[12:14] Yeah, so people get divorced because of money issues.

[12:18] The business makes money and feeds us.

[12:20] So feed the business, the business sweet us.

[12:22] And that was kind of my reasoning.

[12:24] And then we were both miserable at like three-year point.

[12:27] And Layla and I sat on the bench one day outside of our house and we were like, I don't

[12:31] like this.

[12:32] And she was like, I don't like this either.

[12:33] We're both like, I wouldn't want to continue this way.

[12:35] And she, I know, going into that conversation was afraid, like, well, what if Alex just like,

[12:38] this is what he likes and this is what he thinks normal?

[12:40] And honestly, if I'd said, like, I love this.

[12:41] This is great.

[12:42] I think Layla would have been like, this doesn't work for me.

[12:44] And then that would have been it.

[12:45] And I'm going to flip that if it had been the same way with Layla.

[12:47] I probably would have been like, maybe more work for me.

[12:49] And so, you know, we tweaked the how we were going to work.

[12:51] And so we said, well, if we're miserable, we won't stick with the business.

[12:55] So we were like, let's make our marriage first.

[12:58] And if we're happy, then the business will win or not, but at least we won't be miserable.

[13:03] And so when we flipped it, it actually tremendously improved our lives.

[13:07] I think we like, I joked about it.

[13:08] I was like, I think we three extra marriages this year.

[13:10] When we made that change and she was like, oh, we definitely tripled that year.

[13:14] When we got married, we both looked at like the highest success marriages are people

[13:21] who have low expectations and high commitment.

[13:23] I'm going to expect that you're going to not change.

[13:25] And not only that, you might get worse.

[13:26] And right?

[13:28] And I'm still committing to this, provided you don't change your values in what you want to do.

[13:32] It's like the big, the big core things.

[13:34] In order to have a relationship where two autonomous people can be together,

[13:38] you have to give each other that space to just be experiment, do what you want to do,

[13:44] find yourself at times, change, adjust, you know what I mean?

[13:47] Not freaking out about things not being to your expectations or to your desires.

[13:52] It just lowers the pressure in conversations.

[13:55] Like the reason a lot of people split up during like engagements is because whenever you have

[13:58] conversations you're like, wait, you didn't pick up your socks.

[14:01] Does that mean that you're never going to pick up your socks for the rest of my life?

[14:04] And for the rest of my life, I'm going to see socks on the floor like they just catastrophize.

[14:08] And so I think just being like, huh, I don't like this.

[14:11] Okay, we're busy right now.

[14:13] When we have time, I'll bring it up.

[14:14] Like it's not an anything.

[14:16] And if I forget by the next time we talk, then it's probably not that big of a deal.

[14:18] Yeah, and the flip side is that if everything is super, so easy, like you just like

[14:22] let everything roll off, it's like usually just not confronting shit.

[14:25] Because no one, no two people are perfect together.

[14:27] Like there's just always, like there are people.

[14:29] You have tons of different things and communications and things like that.

[14:32] We both know that both of us have these things that are, we're huge strengths for us.

[14:36] And so then we each get to deal with each other's like downsides of those strengths, you know,

[14:40] which, you know, one for me is like super high activity high output, driven, can get a

[14:45] fucked on of shit done.

[14:46] I also care so much about so many things that I tend to stress more over stuff.

[14:51] Yeah.

[14:52] And I'm super, super distracted for the most part.

[14:54] I can seem aloof and disinterested in a lot of small stuff, which I think a different

[14:59] spouse might interpret that as Alex doesn't care about me.

[15:03] I think Layla has just never done that.

[15:04] It's just been like, oh, Alex just doesn't care about any of the stuff.

[15:07] And that's not a reflection of his care for me.

[15:08] It's just he just doesn't care.

[15:10] He doesn't, it's not even just care.

[15:11] Just think about.

[15:12] I always appreciate it was that Layla never tried to change me.

[15:14] I think we seek each other's opinion on things because we respect each other's opinion, not

[15:18] because we need the approval.

[15:20] Yeah.

[15:21] Here's one that you'll love.

[15:22] How do you decide what to do when you wake up and start your day?

[15:25] Try to get like the most important things done early.

[15:29] I mean, I usually work on the exact same things for a very long time.

[15:31] I spent a long time thinking about what one thing I'm going to do and then what's

[15:34] to decide that that's the thing that makes the most sense from the most angles that

[15:37] will give me the most leverage.

[15:38] That's what I do.

[15:39] That's like my first six hours of every day.

[15:41] And I've been doing that.

[15:42] That habit of like the first six hours of every day is dedicated to the thing that

[15:45] matters most.

[15:46] I've been doing for since I started working.

[15:47] So I mean, like a decade plus.

[15:49] Some people, it's like late at night.

[15:50] So I think it really just depends on who you are.

[15:51] But for me, I'm the first thing in the morning.

[15:53] Could either of you have achieved the success you have without one and no.

[15:56] Yeah.

[15:57] I think we could have.

[15:58] I think we would have been harder and we're thinking we would have taken longer.

[16:01] And it's interesting because I think right now, if I knew what I know now, I could redo

[16:05] it.

[16:06] And I think if you knew what you knew now, you could redo it.

[16:08] But to know what we know now, I don't know how long it would have taken me to realize

[16:12] how important operations were.

[16:13] Culture.

[16:14] People.

[16:15] I don't know.

[16:16] I like it would have been, I was a hard sell.

[16:19] Seriously.

[16:20] I was a hard sell.

[16:21] I got a hard sell.

[16:23] It was very rare that I had somebody that I respected so much and who was so persistent

[16:27] for such a long time and had so much evidence behind them that eventually I realized that

[16:32] the way that I saw business in the world was not entirely true.

[16:37] But there was more of the picture.

[16:38] And so I think knowing what I know now, yes, how would I have known what I know now?

[16:42] I don't know.

[16:43] Finding the right business partner is difficult.

[16:45] And so to say that you'll have the same amount of success, I think at some point, yes,

[16:49] and you will find eventually a partner.

[16:52] But it is, that's one of the hardest things.

[16:54] I mean, we see it in acquisition.com and people buy all the time.

[16:56] Like, oftentimes the business is not where it could be because the partnership is not

[17:01] right.

[17:02] And that's just more often than that.

[17:03] You can count on one hand the amount of good partners you have in your life.

[17:05] You look at Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett.

[17:07] They found each other and were like, great, this works.

[17:09] We don't need anyone else.

[17:10] We're just going to keep doing this.

[17:11] And so like, could Leyla have found someone else?

[17:13] Absolutely.

[17:14] Could I find someone like Leyla?

[17:15] Absolutely.

[17:16] How long would it have taken?

[17:17] I don't know.

[17:18] Could I do it on my own?

[17:19] Absolutely not.

[17:20] We had so much in common that we were like, I don't know if we should date or be friends or whatever,

[17:22] but like, let's, how are we related?

[17:24] Yeah, we related.

[17:25] You could be my sister.

[17:26] What is your version of quality time with your partner as business owners?

[17:29] What do you do when your partner wants to work and you want to spend time away from work

[17:33] for a bit?

[17:34] Wondering because my partner and I own companies and work a lot of the time.

[17:36] I think that's something that we've learned.

[17:38] And at least I can speak for myself.

[17:40] I have learned is that you can want something and also not get it.

[17:47] And that is okay.

[17:48] And there are many times in a relationship where maybe I'm, because we tend to trade off

[17:52] seasons where Alex has a really intense work season.

[17:55] Next season's Leyla's really intense work season.

[17:57] So we don't match up much.

[17:58] And so I might want to go do something with Alex for the entire day and also realize

[18:03] that I'm not going to get what I want.

[18:04] And I've recognized myself like in my young twenties, like wanting something and being mad

[18:09] that you can't have is very childlike stance to take.

[18:12] But we're adults.

[18:13] So I can want that and accept that I'm not going to get it and do something else instead.

[18:17] If there's a season where I have a day that's free and Alex doesn't, I go do other things.

[18:23] I make plans for myself.

[18:24] I entertain myself.

[18:25] I can still do things I like doing, even though I would prefer to do them with

[18:29] him.

[18:30] I can accept that he's not in that season.

[18:32] And the last thing I ever want to do is deter him from his goals and the things that

[18:35] make him happy and fulfill the end of the day.

[18:37] And so I think it's understanding that you can want something and not get it and it's not

[18:42] a problem because there are many seasons where that's just light.

[18:46] I want to emphasize Leyla's point, which is that because we work in the same business, we

[18:51] are almost always in a different season.

[18:53] Now, sometimes we're both in a busy season, but we're almost always one of us is.

[18:57] And so I think we've just grown accustomed to the fact that we've shifted our expectations

[19:00] to them.

[19:01] What the other person must or should do in our relationship in order to be satisfied.

[19:04] Desire comes from a place of lack.

[19:06] And so when you don't always get to see your spouse when you want to or get to spend time

[19:11] with them when you want to, when you do, it feels, it's that much more fun.

[19:15] It's that much more exciting.

[19:16] It's that much more that you cherish it.

[19:18] And I know for us, as we've gotten bigger bowls and we have more demand on both of our

[19:22] plates and we're probably both in a really busy season right now.

[19:25] The time that we do get together, like even this last week, we spent like an evening

[19:28] together.

[19:29] Just chilling together doing nothing.

[19:32] It was like the highlight of my whole week.

[19:34] And it felt better than it may have if that were like an everyday thing.

[19:37] Because then you probably just could take a beach on it.

[19:39] The thing is, Esther Perrell, the mating and captivity, which Layla read the book and then

[19:43] just told me what was in it.

[19:44] But she said, she said that you need to create space to be missed.

[19:47] And I just love that.

[19:48] Bozination, what's up, you guys are amazing.

[19:51] We are beyond grateful.

[19:53] We don't feel like we deserve it.

[19:54] We are appreciative of all the support you guys had over the last year.

[19:57] And we can't wait to spend the next year with you.

[19:59] Keep being one of the other.

[20:00] 24.

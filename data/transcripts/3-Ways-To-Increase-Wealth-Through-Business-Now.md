[00:00] So these are the three biggest levers for growth in a business.

[00:03] Three big levers for biz growth.

[00:08] All right.

[00:10] Going up.

[00:11] All right.

[00:12] The first is gonna be your market, all right?

[00:14] And so the reason that investors look at this stuff

[00:17] is because they know that if you put a great entrepreneur

[00:20] in a bad market or a bad market or a bad entrepreneur

[00:24] in a great market, the market will usually win.

[00:27] And so let me tell you a quick story

[00:29] about this to illustrate this point.

[00:30] So one of my friends Lloyd owned a great tech company,

[00:36] and he started a probably a decade ago,

[00:38] and they grew pretty quickly,

[00:40] and then it sort of plateaued,

[00:42] and then it started to go down.

[00:43] And he was trying to figure this out,

[00:45] and he was struggling with it,

[00:46] and he called me up when he was like,

[00:47] hey dude, what do you think the issue is with this?

[00:50] And I was like, dude, you're selling your software

[00:53] to newspapers, because that was his exclusive customer

[00:55] for his ad product.

[00:57] And despite having an amazing offer

[00:59] and being a great salesman,

[01:01] because it was a zero risk offer for them,

[01:03] he only just revsured with them.

[01:05] Despite both of those things,

[01:07] he was not able to grow,

[01:09] because he was in the newspaper market,

[01:11] which was shrinking by 25% every single year

[01:14] over eight years that he had the business, right?

[01:16] He still has it to the side, but for eight years

[01:18] he was trying to figure out what was going on,

[01:20] and he looked at every single piece of the business

[01:21] except for probably the most obvious one,

[01:23] which is the market itself.

[01:24] And so what I want to introduce you with these three

[01:26] that levers, and that's the first one is the market,

[01:29] is you have to do these from the top down.

[01:32] All right, if you were in a horrible market,

[01:33] it doesn't matter how good your offer is,

[01:34] it doesn't matter how good your persuasive abilities are,

[01:37] you will not be able to outpower a bad market.

[01:40] And so the way I look at these levers

[01:42] is this going to be a plus,

[01:44] is it going to be a neutral, or is it going to be a negative?

[01:49] And so as long as your market is not a negative,

[01:52] and as either a neutral or a plus,

[01:53] you can move on to the second lever for business growth.

[01:57] The second lever is your offer.

[02:01] And what I mean by that is what you literally

[02:04] giving a customer in order to transact with them.

[02:07] This is the products and services

[02:10] that you offer and exchange for money,

[02:12] and the terms under which you offer them,

[02:14] and what they need to do to redeem them.

[02:16] That is in essence what an offer is.

[02:19] And so these are the terms, the price, et cetera,

[02:22] and what they get.

[02:24] If you were in a normal market or a good market,

[02:27] if you're in a good market, it doesn't matter.

[02:29] If you were selling toilet paper during COVID,

[02:32] it didn't matter what your offer was,

[02:36] or how persuasive you were, which is the third one.

[02:38] You were just in the right market at the right time,

[02:41] and you're going to make a ton of money.

[02:43] But most of us are in this market.

[02:45] Most of us are just in normal markets

[02:47] that are growing a normal amount.

[02:48] And the nice thing is if you're in one of those markets,

[02:50] you can still make a tremendous amount of money

[02:52] by offering a unique offering and a good product.

[02:56] And so the offer is going to be the second thing.

[02:59] Now if you have an incredible,

[03:00] your resistable offer, then more people will say yes,

[03:03] and you can make a tremendous amount of money.

[03:06] But again here, you can have an amazing offer,

[03:08] you can have a normal offer, you can have a shitty offer.

[03:12] And as long as you do not have a shitty offer,

[03:15] or a normal offer, you can move on to the next one,

[03:18] which is the third big lever, which is persuasion.

[03:22] So some people are naturally good persuaders.

[03:24] They're good marketers, they're good salespeople.

[03:28] And the thing is that each of these

[03:31] is more important than the rest.

[03:33] All right, so go from the top down.

[03:35] So I'll give you some examples.

[03:37] If I were in an amazing market,

[03:40] it doesn't matter if my offer persuasion abilities are good,

[03:42] I'll make a ton of money.

[03:43] If I'm in a bad market, it doesn't matter

[03:45] if I'm in a good persuasion and good offering,

[03:49] I'm not going to make any money.

[03:50] And so basically, you can just move from the top down

[03:53] and check these off your list.

[03:54] And so most of us are going to be here in this normal market,

[03:58] right, a normal market.

[03:59] You serve dentists, you're serve tire practice,

[04:01] you serve normal people who are in pain.

[04:03] Those are normal markets.

[04:04] They're not growing, they're not shrinking, they're just normal.

[04:07] Right?

[04:08] Now, from there, we move to our offer.

[04:11] Now the thing is is that this is typically the easiest

[04:14] lever on any business to grow the business,

[04:17] because any business, if takes a little bit of time,

[04:20] to go from a normal offer to an amazing offer.

[04:23] You can't really go from a normal market

[04:25] to an amazing market with your business,

[04:26] unless you change your entire business.

[04:28] But with an offer, you simply can repackage

[04:30] the value proposition, how you charge,

[04:32] and that terms under which you offer your services,

[04:35] and you can move from having a normal offering,

[04:38] or a subpar offering, to an amazing irresistible offer.

[04:42] I call them grand slam offers.

[04:43] And the reason I call them that is because grand slam

[04:45] is both very rare and very good.

[04:47] But the difference between baseball and businesses

[04:49] that when you have a grand slam offer,

[04:52] you can knock the ball so far to the park,

[04:53] you can win for a thousand years.

[04:55] And that's the difference, right?

[04:57] In baseball, you can only win four runs,

[04:58] no matter how good your offer is.

[04:59] In business, you go in for life.

[05:02] And so, making the actual best offer

[05:04] is gonna be the second biggest lever on your business.

[05:07] Now, let's assume that you've got a great offer.

[05:10] Now, if you have crap persuasion skills,

[05:13] you'll still make money.

[05:14] If you have normal persuasion skills,

[05:15] you'll make a lot of money.

[05:17] If you have fantastic persuasion skills,

[05:19] you'll make a tremendous amount of money.

[05:21] All right, which leads me to the next piece.

[05:23] So let's assume that you just have a normal offer,

[05:25] not an amazing offer.

[05:26] All right, then it takes us to our third portion here.

[05:29] The only way, if that is your scenario,

[05:31] you're in a normal market, you're normal,

[05:33] you have a normal offer.

[05:35] The only way for you to be hyper successful

[05:38] is to develop persuasion abilities.

[05:40] And so that's learning how to market and sell,

[05:41] how to acquire customers through multiple channels.

[05:44] All right?

[05:45] And so, the thing is is that this one is usually

[05:47] the most difficult to acquire.

[05:49] In my opinion, it takes a lot of time,

[05:50] takes a lot of effort, takes a lot of volume,

[05:51] takes a lot of practice, a lot of failure

[05:53] in order to get good at this, all right?

[05:54] And so, if I'm looking at a business and I'm trying to grow it,

[05:58] the first thing I'm gonna do is check this off,

[06:00] it's just say like, are we making sure

[06:01] that we're not in a bad market?

[06:03] And we're at least in a normal or good market?

[06:05] You'll know if you're in a good market, believe me.

[06:07] Like I said, if you're selling toilet paper,

[06:08] Crooked 19, if you're selling hotdogs outside of a baseball

[06:11] stadium as soon as the game wants out,

[06:12] you know you're in a good market.

[06:13] Right, but most of us are here.

[06:14] So as long as I'm not in a bad market,

[06:16] I move on to the next one.

[06:18] And so if I'm looking at the business, I say,

[06:19] okay, what is the current offering?

[06:21] What are we doing in exchange for money?

[06:23] What are we giving clients?

[06:24] Right, where do the terms the agreement,

[06:25] what's the price point and what are they getting in exchange?

[06:28] All right?

[06:29] And so then what I will do is shift the business

[06:32] from here in this direction to create a grand slam offer.

[06:36] And the beautiful thing is this can literally take a half a day.

[06:39] Maybe a day, right?

[06:40] Where you just re-recombine, repackage,

[06:43] reposition, rename the offers,

[06:45] change the terms under which you make,

[06:47] you offer your businesses and services and products.

[06:49] And overnight, you can take a normal business

[06:52] to an extraordinary business by doing this one thing.

[06:55] All right?

[06:56] And then finally, the last thing that you can do

[06:58] is you can develop all the skills of persuasion.

[07:00] So if you're looking at the entrepreneurial journey,

[07:04] my recommendation for most people is I start here.

[07:07] This is the first thing I will do.

[07:09] The second thing I will do is get them to focus here

[07:11] and on proving this skill and going from a normal sales person

[07:14] and a normal market or two an exceptional sales person marketer.

[07:16] Because they should already be being reasonably successful

[07:19] because we fixed the offer first.

[07:21] And then move up to the top to the biggest lever

[07:24] and say now that we understand how to make amazing offers,

[07:27] how to persuade people in masses.

[07:29] Now let's go find a market that we know we can apply

[07:32] the skill set too, that we think is going to crush it.

[07:35] So right now, if your business is not growing,

[07:38] it might be because you are lacking one, two,

[07:41] or all three of the levers that creates success.

[07:44] And so if that, hopefully that found it,

[07:46] you found that valuable,

[07:47] hopefully you can think about your own business within this context.

[07:50] Am I in a great market, a normal market or a shrinking market?

[07:53] Is my offer insanely compelling?

[07:55] Is it normal or is it bad?

[07:58] Are my persuasion abilities exceptional?

[08:00] Can I acquire clients at the staff of my fingers whenever I want?

[08:04] Do they come in kind of semi-consistently,

[08:07] but I can't really grow it?

[08:09] Or do I have no idea what I'm doing

[08:10] and I get people in the phone and I can never get money?

[08:13] And so if you can rate yourself on these things,

[08:15] then you can identify where you have opportunities for growth

[08:18] and then follow these steps to get to where you want to go.

[08:21] So hopefully that you found value in that,

[08:23] hopefully that was cool in terms of framing how growth

[08:26] and the biggest levers that exist in business overall

[08:29] and keeping awesome and I will see you on the flip side.

[08:33] Bye.

[00:00] I had a conversation with a good friend of mine

[00:01] about basically this business endeavor that he had done

[00:04] and over a long period of time

[00:05] and ended up not working out.

[00:06] But in that whole period of time,

[00:07] he never reached out to me once.

[00:09] I was like, why?

[00:10] And what transpired from his reaction

[00:12] is kind of the point of this video.

[00:14] I'm gonna talk about that conversation

[00:15] and I think it absolutely affects so many people

[00:17] and limit to their capacity

[00:19] and why they aren't successful.

[00:20] And some of the underlying reasons

[00:22] and at the very end, I'll keep you kind of a framework

[00:23] that has helped me through this year particularly

[00:26] because it's been a very hard year for me.

[00:27] But hopefully it helps you.

[00:28] The big theme of this though

[00:29] is that no one cares just when

[00:32] because until you win effort always goes unnoticed.

[00:35] You just have to get used to it.

[00:36] It's the way of the world.

[00:37] I remember I asked him, I said,

[00:39] hey, do you mind if I make a music content about this?

[00:40] He was like, sure, but what about, you know,

[00:42] from our long conversation, I said,

[00:43] you said this thing, if I'm gonna fail,

[00:45] I'd rather it be on me.

[00:47] And he's like, well, what about that was interesting to you?

[00:49] He said, I honestly needed to have that happen

[00:52] to realize that I can't do it on my own.

[00:53] Otherwise, it'd be easy to put that blame on somebody else.

[00:56] And so I responded with, how could you put blame on someone else?

[01:00] And he said, well, you know, saying, like,

[01:01] hey, I failed because I used someone else's system,

[01:04] or I failed because, you know, so and so didn't keep their end

[01:06] of the deal or what didn't do their responsibilities,

[01:09] or I failed because they ruined my business by doing X-Y-Z.

[01:12] And they're all basically just like cop outs

[01:13] when your mind gets kind of weak, right?

[01:15] They're kind of like excuses.

[01:17] But I hate to say that I've witnessed this

[01:19] happen too many times.

[01:20] And this is all him saying this.

[01:21] And I said, false, funny.

[01:23] Because it just doesn't matter.

[01:24] No one thinks of themselves like,

[01:26] hey, that worked out really well for him.

[01:27] I wonder who's fault it is.

[01:29] We only think false and the negative.

[01:30] We don't think false and the positive, right?

[01:32] I bring this up to him and he says,

[01:33] I have a visceral understanding of the fact

[01:35] that I need better systems, you know, better leverage

[01:37] and better people around me to, you know, make that.

[01:39] Next chapter, happen.

[01:40] And so I have to stop hiding.

[01:42] In thinking about this, I was like, no one asks,

[01:45] who's fault it is when it works.

[01:47] And the reality is that two years from now,

[01:50] when you think about the championship Super Bowl game

[01:52] or the quarterback's who've hit these records,

[01:55] no one's like, hey, you know,

[01:56] that guy got really good calls from a rough,

[01:59] hey, it was really raining that day.

[02:01] No one remembers.

[02:02] They just remember who won.

[02:04] And so I think that this is a really interesting thought line

[02:07] that I wanted to kind of dive into.

[02:08] Because the individual question did something

[02:10] in the fitness space.

[02:11] And so I reached out and was like,

[02:13] why didn't you ask me for help?

[02:14] And this was basically his response was that he,

[02:17] he didn't, he wanted the failure to be on his own

[02:19] if he was going to fail.

[02:20] And it was such a contrast to how I've seen the world

[02:23] that I thought it was worth making

[02:24] because for any of you who have this view or view,

[02:26] I think it does you a tremendous disservice.

[02:28] Because my perspective has always been,

[02:29] it will always be my fault.

[02:31] And no one will care what I got help or who I got help from.

[02:35] They will just know whether I won or lost, period.

[02:38] Period.

[02:39] And so the reason that the background of my feeling,

[02:40] like I'm so passionate about this,

[02:41] like the background of my phone is too words.

[02:43] It's just win.

[02:45] That's it.

[02:46] It's just win.

[02:46] When I think about that, it's like no one cares.

[02:50] Just no one cares.

[02:51] No one's going to ask to how many people did you get help with.

[02:54] Before you failed, they just are going to know whether you failed

[02:57] or not.

[02:58] And I think it's ridiculous to live life to say,

[03:02] because the real real is that underneath of this

[03:04] is actually ego.

[03:06] It's not being able to say, I don't know, please help.

[03:10] And so it means that many people would rather

[03:13] maintain their ego's and fail than win.

[03:17] And so I think a lot of beginners are stuck there.

[03:19] They're actually stuck in their own pride.

[03:21] They don't reach out for help.

[03:23] They don't consume content because they think they're smart enough.

[03:26] And this is something that's really common amongst people

[03:28] who identify as being intelligent.

[03:30] That's actually what's really interesting.

[03:31] This is why I think humility is such an important part

[03:34] of getting to where you want to go,

[03:35] is that you have to be able to say, I don't know.

[03:38] You have to be able to say, I failed,

[03:40] or I couldn't figure it out.

[03:41] And so if you can't do that, right?

[03:44] Because you probably maintain some certain aura,

[03:46] some sort of an image that people around you have like,

[03:48] oh, he's a smart guy.

[03:49] Or he was always good at school or whatever the thing is.

[03:52] Like, and then you see somebody else who was dumb at school,

[03:54] all of a sudden succeed.

[03:55] It's because usually they're okay being like,

[03:57] I don't know, can somebody help me?

[03:59] But if you're the smart one of the people you know,

[04:01] then you're not willing to do that

[04:02] because you have to humble yourself.

[04:03] The thing is is that the work has to be done.

[04:05] The learning has to get learned.

[04:06] The question is, what format or what mental soup do I need

[04:10] to have in my head that maximizes the likelihood

[04:13] that I will learn faster than other people?

[04:15] And I think humility is one part of that soup.

[04:17] You have to be humble enough to listen, to ask.

[04:21] You can learn anything you want

[04:23] as long as you're willing to look dumb

[04:25] in front of other people for an extended period of time.

[04:28] I think the most underrated money making habit

[04:31] is being willing to look stupid

[04:34] because one of the shurist ways to never succeed in life

[04:38] is to avoid looking dumb, is to avoid failing.

[04:42] And what's really interesting about this

[04:44] is that risk is guaranteed.

[04:46] And so there's this thing that people have this

[04:48] misconception, this fallacy about how life works.

[04:51] Which is they want to avoid risk.

[04:53] But the thing is is that all great things come with risk.

[04:56] If you put an idea out there, you risk ridicule.

[04:59] If you want to fall in love, you risk rejection.

[05:02] Like if you want to have intimacy, right?

[05:03] You risk vulnerability.

[05:05] Like all of these things have every,

[05:07] whatever there is joy, there is suffering.

[05:09] And wherever there is suffering,

[05:11] there's potential for joy.

[05:12] And so the thing is is that most of these elements

[05:14] that we want out of life are double edge swords.

[05:17] They're two sides to the same coin.

[05:19] We want one side without the other.

[05:20] We want the sunny days without the rainy days.

[05:22] But it's just weather.

[05:23] And the only way you can avoid that is by never going outside.

[05:26] But I think if you never go outside,

[05:27] I think you miss out on life.

[05:29] And so I think that the same degree, like missing out on risk

[05:32] is that we have this big fear of this thing.

[05:33] When reality is that if you risk nothing,

[05:36] you become nothing.

[05:37] You are nothing because nothing ventured, nothing gains.

[05:41] You're not going to get what you want

[05:43] by never risking what you have.

[05:45] And the thing is is that the things that we have

[05:47] aren't always material.

[05:48] And I think this is actually one of the big misconceptions

[05:50] that people were starting out.

[05:51] It's like I can easily stand here and say,

[05:53] you were the most dangerous in the beginning

[05:55] because you have nothing to lose.

[05:56] But the thing is that almost everyone has things to lose.

[05:59] And most of the things that they have to lose in the beginning

[06:01] are in their head.

[06:03] And that's why it's so difficult.

[06:04] Because what you have to lose is your social standing.

[06:06] What you have to lose is looking smart in front of your friends.

[06:09] What you have to lose is being the more successful one

[06:13] of your medium group or your low group of friends.

[06:15] So the people who know you are maybe

[06:16] you're the first one to go to college and your family.

[06:18] And you're the prodigal son

[06:19] of the prodigal daughter.

[06:20] And so if you go out and fail all of a sudden,

[06:22] this whole image that you have perfectly

[06:24] manicured and created for your friends and family gets

[06:27] shot, like it vanishes.

[06:28] And your whole identity is wrapped up in this.

[06:31] But I think that when we have to do this,

[06:32] we have to invest our identity in different things.

[06:34] And then we have to invest our identity in our behaviors,

[06:36] rather than what other people believe us to be.

[06:38] If we think about our identity as this thing,

[06:40] it's like, do we have an anti-fragile identity?

[06:42] Do we have an identity that can withstand external circumstances

[06:45] changing?

[06:46] And I only bring this up because it was so hard for me.

[06:48] And also getting kicked in the nuts multiple times,

[06:51] losing everything tends to make you question,

[06:52] like, who am I?

[06:54] And where is my identity rooted?

[06:56] And so this is something that I've been thinking a lot

[06:58] about right now because this year

[06:59] transparently has been a super hard year for me.

[07:01] But I keep asking that myself, the question of like,

[07:03] where does my identity live?

[07:05] And this is why I think so much about behaviors

[07:07] because we try to say like, you need someone

[07:10] who has all this tweet.

[07:11] It was like, I don't like it that other people judge me

[07:13] for what I do or they love me for what I do,

[07:16] rather than loving me for who I am.

[07:18] And I saw this quote a lot of people

[07:19] were liking and commenting on it.

[07:21] And then it had a follow-up to this,

[07:23] which was, do I love me for what I do?

[07:27] Or do I love me for who I am?

[07:28] And I think this sounds very pithy

[07:30] and very rhetorical.

[07:32] It sounds nice.

[07:33] But I think if you were to ask the question,

[07:35] what is the difference between who you are

[07:36] and what you do?

[07:37] You get a very interesting answer, which is,

[07:39] it's very hard to describe who someone is

[07:41] without describing what they do,

[07:42] which is why for me doing is being.

[07:44] Then it goes into, okay, if doing is being,

[07:47] then who I am is what I do,

[07:50] rather than who I am is what other people think I do.

[07:54] And so that means that when external circumstances get bad,

[07:58] what do I do?

[07:59] That is who I am.

[08:00] By shifting that perspective,

[08:02] your identity becomes rooted in the actions

[08:03] that you can control.

[08:04] Your identity becomes under your control.

[08:06] And then by extension,

[08:08] the ups and downs that emotional roller coaster

[08:10] that comes with the external status that people give you,

[08:13] for the things you can do potentially for them,

[08:15] or otherwise, then starts to disappear.

[08:17] And I think it allows you to take the big risks

[08:20] that you know you need to take.

[08:21] I'll give this example, but when I started,

[08:24] my gym business to put this in perspective,

[08:27] I signed up for a mastermind of gym owners

[08:30] when I didn't own a gym.

[08:31] Think of how ridiculous that is.

[08:34] Like I started at a mastermind.

[08:35] I paid money, even though I didn't have a gym

[08:37] to be with a bunch of gym owners.

[08:39] Now to me, it may complete sense,

[08:40] because I was like, well, why would I want to just go make

[08:42] mistakes first and then go here?

[08:43] I was like, I mind as well, learn, you know,

[08:46] where to put the best location

[08:47] and how much to pay for rent and you know,

[08:49] where to buy my equipment and where to the best workouts

[08:51] and how do I find trainers?

[08:52] I was like, I must ask them who have five, 10 years each

[08:55] in industry experience and I'll just start day one,

[08:58] 10 years ahead.

[08:59] duh, the thing is that that seems so foreign.

[09:02] And I don't know why it seems so foreign.

[09:04] Why would you not ask for help?

[09:05] And the only reason I can think of is that you have an ego.

[09:09] Like I just, I don't know the other reason.

[09:10] Like why would you not ask for help?

[09:12] I always try to take the perspective of like,

[09:13] I wanna be the biggest success story

[09:16] of every mentor of every person is ever given me advice,

[09:19] at every vendor I've ever worked with.

[09:21] And that's fundamentally been my quote secret.

[09:24] Is I do everything that someone else tells me to do.

[09:27] To the tea, the first time,

[09:29] and then I take what works and then I toss the rest.

[09:32] And I fundamentally believe kind of,

[09:34] I think either the roast at this or MSN can't remember.

[09:36] But it's like, I can learn something from everyone

[09:39] and in that they are my superior.

[09:41] And so basically everyone is better than you at something

[09:44] and in that you can learn from them.

[09:46] And so rather than having this judgmental perspective

[09:48] of like I'm better than everyone,

[09:49] which is fundamentally all rooted in ego,

[09:51] you can always find,

[09:52] and this is something that I've seen

[09:53] with people who are ultra wealthy,

[09:54] that in my life is that they will actually be interested

[09:58] in people who are significantly below them in status,

[10:02] because they will just think, how do I ROI this time?

[10:04] And they will just search for something

[10:06] that this person knows more about or is better than them at,

[10:09] and then they just hone in on that.

[10:11] And what's great is that the person who's kind of below them

[10:13] in status is very happy to share the thing that they're really good at.

[10:16] But in that moment, who's better off at the end?

[10:18] Well, you can make the argument that person who's below

[10:20] and status feels great about themselves,

[10:22] because person who's above is asking them questions,

[10:24] telling them it's so interesting.

[10:25] But the person who leaves with more information

[10:26] than they started is the one who asks the questions.

[10:28] Who's the one who humbled themselves and said,

[10:30] I don't know anything about motorcycles,

[10:31] tell me about motorcycles.

[10:32] Right?

[10:33] I don't know how to fix how to fix each fact-fads,

[10:35] like tell me about that.

[10:36] Like what else am I gonna do?

[10:37] I'm here and we're together and I can learn from you.

[10:40] But at the end of the day,

[10:41] one of my favorite perspectives on

[10:42] kind of these types of hardships is it's actually

[10:45] on the sort of grip and door,

[10:46] but I think it's so profound is that the dwarves who made it

[10:49] or the goblins who made it had this kind of spell on it,

[10:52] which was that it only takes in that,

[10:54] which makes it stronger.

[10:55] And I just love that as a perspective for me on life,

[10:58] which is like one, everything that occurs to us is there.

[11:01] Is there a way?

[11:02] Is there a timeline?

[11:03] Is there a version of the universe where I get better from this?

[11:06] And this has just been very top of mind

[11:08] because 2025 has been probably the hardest year

[11:10] to my last eight years.

[11:12] But I thought to myself like,

[11:13] well historically, when I have very bad years,

[11:16] I typically have really good things that happen afterwards.

[11:18] So what is the good thing that's going to come from this?

[11:21] What is the lesson that I need to learn?

[11:22] What is the friction that I'm getting rubbed against

[11:25] that I need to get reshaped in some way?

[11:27] And I've had some really interesting kind of like mental

[11:29] breakthroughs in terms of what I'm planning to change

[11:31] about my behavior going forward.

[11:34] But I'll give you this other kind of mental frame

[11:36] that's helped me through this, which is when something bad

[11:39] happens.

[11:40] A lot of the things that are bad

[11:41] happen only in exclusive linear mind.

[11:43] It's all given example.

[11:44] So let's say you've got $10,000 saved up.

[11:47] That's your life savings.

[11:49] And let's say that you lose $1,000.

[11:52] That would be pretty traumatic.

[11:53] It's 10% of everything you have.

[11:55] Now the question is, what does it change about what you do?

[11:59] Does it change the food you eat?

[12:00] Does it change the car you drive?

[12:01] Does it change where you live?

[12:03] What does it actually change?

[12:04] It usually changes absolutely nothing.

[12:06] But then we choose to feel terrible about it

[12:08] because for whatever reason that's what we choose to do.

[12:11] But the key word there is choice.

[12:13] We choose that.

[12:14] Equally, we could say I choose to not feel terrible

[12:17] because it changes nothing about my life.

[12:18] And so I've used this as this great framework

[12:20] for like, what does this change about my identity?

[12:22] Is it changed my job?

[12:24] Does it change right?

[12:24] Does it change my married to?

[12:27] What does it change about my life?

[12:28] And most things change absolutely nothing about your life.

[12:32] And so it's really just absolutely voluntary suffering

[12:35] that we choose to subscribe to.

[12:36] You know, opt me into that suffering.

[12:38] That sounds good.

[12:39] Right?

[12:40] Of course not.

[12:41] Back to the risk of what we're willing to do

[12:42] or what we're willing to take in order to win.

[12:44] Is that no one will remember that you asked for help.

[12:48] And you can never expect someone to invest in you more

[12:50] than you invest in yourself.

[12:52] Because at the end of the day, they will only remember if you win.

[12:55] And so for me, I always think to myself, progress

[12:58] is greater than pride.

[12:59] And the thing is, there's only one person's pride

[13:01] that I want, which is my own,

[13:03] is that I'm proud of myself.

[13:04] Because the thing is, is that most of the people in my life

[13:07] will not be here for the rest of my life.

[13:09] Well, guaranteed will not be fresh to my life.

[13:13] Right?

[13:14] Either they will die or I will die, but one of us will end.

[13:16] And so the idea that I'm going to dictate the few brief

[13:19] moments I have in this existence based on someone else's

[13:21] perception of me feels like a pretty terrible way to live.

[13:23] And I say this because it's like, well, obviously,

[13:26] we all know that, but we still do it.

[13:28] And so it's like, what are the mental frameworks

[13:29] that we have?

[13:30] And so I'd like to remind myself

[13:32] that winners write history.

[13:35] But here's the cool part.

[13:37] Is that if you win and when you win,

[13:39] you get to have a revisionist history of your own life.

[13:42] Like you can basically read right your own history

[13:45] so that you can make it whatever you want.

[13:47] Because what's really, really weird and very trippy

[13:49] that I think about a lot is that your life only exists

[13:53] in your mind.

[13:54] Like memory in of itself, like if you start

[13:56] looking into the science of memory, it's wildly inaccurate.

[14:00] Like, remember our feelings about how things happen.

[14:02] And then like, there's the great fruit of the loom,

[14:05] hoax where everyone thinks that there's like this

[14:06] quannacopia of fruit on the tag for fruit of the loom.

[14:10] But there was never a big, a bunch of fruit on the tags

[14:13] for fruit of the loom.

[14:14] But we all have this collective memory around it

[14:16] and just shows how poor our memories really are.

[14:19] I used to think to myself that most of the time,

[14:21] I'm not sure I can remember most of this suffering.

[14:23] And so I'll give you a really, really tactical version of this.

[14:26] So if you've ever accidentally drank too much

[14:28] and you're throwing up, right, and you're like,

[14:30] this is terrible.

[14:31] I remember thinking to myself, like the first time

[14:34] that that happened, I was like, you know,

[14:35] I probably won't remember very much of this.

[14:37] And I was like, well, that's kind of refreshing.

[14:39] And so most of this suffering, when I look back on this,

[14:41] will be very, very short in terms of the memory,

[14:43] even though this may be four hours of me wrapped around

[14:46] his oil in.

[14:46] In thinking about this, it's like a lot of the suffering

[14:48] that we have to endure.

[14:50] We actually only remember as a moment,

[14:52] even though it may have lasted hours and days and months,

[14:54] there's just these highlight reels

[14:56] or these reverse highlight miserable moments

[14:58] that we remember.

[14:59] And so I think a lot about the concept of moments

[15:02] because we actually don't remember most of our lives,

[15:04] which is like very wild to consider.

[15:05] Like most of our lives are not recorded

[15:07] and we don't remember it.

[15:08] It just vanishes into nothing.

[15:10] All we have are these discrete moments

[15:12] that we just choose to ascribe to memory.

[15:13] That means that in the moment when something's good,

[15:15] I can think to myself, remember this,

[15:17] try and demarcate this moment.

[15:19] And equally opposite, if something is bad,

[15:22] I can just be like, you know what,

[15:23] maybe I'm gonna compress this one, right?

[15:25] Like I'm gonna choose to just be like, you know what?

[15:27] It was, it was a brief moment.

[15:29] When it might have been a month of just absolute misery.

[15:32] And I know that I'm gonna look back on 2025

[15:34] and just be like, tough year, right?

[15:36] And then that's gonna be it.

[15:37] But the thing is is like, if I didn't go out this year

[15:41] and ask other people for help,

[15:42] I might make 2025, 2025,

[15:44] since 2025, 27, all terrible years.

[15:46] And I would prefer to not have that happen.

[15:47] What's interesting is that,

[15:48] the sometimes the people of the hardest time asking

[15:50] for all people who start to become successful.

[15:53] Maybe some of you in the beginning were easy to ask for help,

[15:55] but then you got the identity of becoming successful.

[15:57] And then everyone around you gave you all the acclades,

[15:59] give you all the status.

[16:00] And now you're puffed up.

[16:03] So you can't be perceived as less than.

[16:05] For me, I still do this day and willing to pay in time,

[16:08] pay in money or pay in favors to do whatever I have to do

[16:11] in order to get other people to help me.

[16:13] Because you will be rewarded far more in life

[16:16] through determination than your intelligence.

[16:18] And the problem is is that determination just looks

[16:21] like a long string of failures until it works.

[16:24] You were rewarded for being able to endure

[16:26] the long string of failures more

[16:28] than you're rewarded for your intellect at avoiding them.

[16:32] Because the thing is that that suffering is guaranteed.

[16:34] You sticking it out is not.

[16:36] And so my TLDR on this is that you have to incur risk,

[16:41] period, you will fail, period.

[16:45] The only thing that people remember over the long term

[16:47] and often the only thing you will remember is whether you

[16:50] want or not.

[16:50] And so do whatever it takes to win,

[16:52] because you're probably only going to remember snippets of it.

[16:56] And everyone else isn't even thinking about it to be

[16:58] with.

[16:58] With that, have an amazing Tuesday.

[17:00] I'll catch you guys on the flip side.

[17:02] Bye.

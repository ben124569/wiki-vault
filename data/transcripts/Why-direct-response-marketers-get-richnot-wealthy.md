[00:00] In this video, I want to break down the difference between branding and direct response marketing

[00:04] and why not deeply understanding the differences costing you millions and millions of dollars

[00:08] and ultimately the amount of money that you probably want to make.

[00:10] And if you don't know why, my name is Alex Mozi, I own acquisition.com.

[00:13] It's a portfolio of companies that is about $85 million a year in revenue.

[00:17] Alright, I make these videos because I was once broke and I've learned a lot of lessons

[00:21] on the way and I don't want the pain that I experienced to be in vain.

[00:24] Alright, that's why I make these.

[00:25] So, that being said, branding versus direct response.

[00:27] I think this is one of the more interesting topics that I have dove into over the last year or so.

[00:34] And it's come from a variety of different conversations I've had with top marketers in this morning.

[00:39] I had a conversation with Dean Graciosy who is a phenomenal world class marketer.

[00:43] And we talked for like an hour this morning just about this concept of the different

[00:46] stitching branding and direct response.

[00:48] And I thought I would share some of the lessons or discussion points that we had with you

[00:51] so that you can hopefully benefit.

[00:53] And so, the first point is that you may have heard this in my book,

[00:56] 100 million offers.

[00:57] But the longer you delay the ask, the bigger the ask can be.

[01:02] So, for example, if you're, you can use this in any situation whether you're, you know,

[01:06] courting a lady or a guy or whatever, you know, in the first five seconds you're like,

[01:11] hey, let's go home together.

[01:12] It's like, well, you might have some audience that be willing to do that,

[01:14] but the vast majority of people would not be willing to do that.

[01:16] But if you date for, you know, six months, then that might be something that would be almost

[01:20] everybody would be willing to do that after six months, depending on whatever relief.

[01:24] That's not my point here, but you can get the idea that a higher and higher percentage

[01:27] people would be willing to take you up on that offer if they spend more and more time with

[01:29] you.

[01:30] And so, the longer the delay, the bigger the ask and the visual that I like to describe

[01:34] to this is the longer the runway, the bigger the plan that can take off.

[01:37] And so, the bigger the payload you can get based on the amount you delay.

[01:41] To the same degree, if you've seen Gary V, he's, he's an influencer and he owns a marketing

[01:47] agency out on New York.

[01:49] And he spent, I want to see 10 years or 12 years building his personal brand.

[01:53] And then he finally had his ask, which was, hey, buy mine NFT.

[01:56] And then within this band of, you know, six months ended up making like a hundred million

[01:59] dollars from that NFT launch, right?

[02:01] Now, I would make the argument that the NFT launch itself was actually director-co-outs marketing

[02:05] play, whereas everything prior to that was really about building the brand.

[02:09] Different examples of this that I think would be important to drive the point home and

[02:12] why I think that many, many, many marketers start and direct response and that end up

[02:17] in branding is because of what about to share with you.

[02:19] So, please listen closely to this if you were trying to make more money.

[02:24] If you look at most big consumer brands, you look at, you know, Colgate or Crest or, you know,

[02:29] shampoo brands, right?

[02:30] That have been here for a very long time.

[02:32] They're not offering two for one deals.

[02:34] They're not like, hey, go buy this toothpaste for 50% off, right?

[02:37] That's not actually what they're doing.

[02:39] They're just talking about the products.

[02:41] And if you look at some of these bigger celebrities that exist, you look at Dwayne Johnson

[02:44] the Rock.

[02:45] This is huge brand and then said, hey, I'm offering, I'm starting the securely

[02:49] got you guys to check it out.

[02:51] Colenberg Rigger, Conner Rigger, built up his personal brand and then said, hey, check out

[02:54] proper 12.

[02:55] Kylie Jenner was like, hey, he built up a brand and then she did her lip kits.

[02:59] And so what's interesting is that brand, people are now realizing, is an amazing arbitrage

[03:03] opportunity for maximizing value.

[03:06] And I think part of the reason behind this is that good will compounds faster than revenue

[03:11] does.

[03:12] And so hear me out, think through this with me.

[03:14] If you've seen somebody who's consistently been selling in this baby you, what happens

[03:18] is you provide value in some way.

[03:20] And then you extract the value that you've the equity in the relationship through monetizing

[03:26] it through an ask or some sort of right hook as they say, just getting them to try and buy

[03:30] something, right?

[03:31] And the thing is that whenever you make an ask, you decrease your good will, right?

[03:34] And so you kind of have to start over at zero again and then you build up good will.

[03:37] And then you ask and then it goes back to zero again.

[03:40] Things are constantly depositing and extracting capital in the relationship and the

[03:45] hope is that it costs you less than deposit than you make on the extraction, right?

[03:49] Like that's fundamentally what like traditional direct response marketing is at its most

[03:53] basic form, right?

[03:55] And the reason it is direct response is that we are actively requesting a direct reply or immediate

[04:02] action as a result of seeing our advertisement, right?

[04:06] Of any kind.

[04:07] To contrast that with branding, what we're doing with branding is that we are reinforcing

[04:12] the values and the stories that people tell about our products and services, all right?

[04:18] So we're reinforcing stories versus asking for actions.

[04:22] And you might be like, well, I, you know, branding doesn't make sense.

[04:25] And I want to tell you this because when I started out my career, I thought that every

[04:28] single company that did branding was retarded.

[04:31] I was like, you guys are idiots.

[04:33] If you guys understood how direct response work, you guys would make more money.

[04:36] I'm such a genius blah, blah, blah, blah.

[04:39] And I was wrong as I often am.

[04:41] And the more I studied these massive companies, I was like, okay, so all of these companies

[04:46] all do this type of marketing, whereas little old me is doing this quick, you know, jab,

[04:51] right hook, whatever.

[04:52] Mario, I've just, I've just, give ask, give ask, give ask, and always just, you know,

[04:56] depositing in a value in order to extract the value later.

[04:59] And the thing is, is people get it.

[05:01] People have seen it.

[05:02] They know the game.

[05:03] And yes, it does work too limited degree, right?

[05:06] But it's very, very rare to find a massive, massive direct response company.

[05:12] I'm not saying they don't exist, but I would say the proponents of enormous companies

[05:15] are not direct response based companies.

[05:18] And so why is that?

[05:20] And I would posit, and this is my theory, and this is what I talk to.

[05:22] Dean this morning about at length is the difference between direct response and branding

[05:28] is not the I or R O I on the advertisement itself.

[05:31] But on the time horizon with which we measure it.

[05:34] All right.

[05:35] And so in direct response, you're always calculating your return on ads been immediately

[05:40] rather than thinking, can I build up this brand?

[05:44] And then look at the return you're getting on that brand overall over an extended period

[05:49] of time.

[05:50] And so I'll give you a classic example to illustrate the difference.

[05:53] If I were selling t-shirts, a direct response marketer might have a cool, funny, mean thing,

[05:59] aggressively market it, have upsells of two of the same shirts, five of the same shirts,

[06:04] getting on continuity for each meme for every month, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[06:07] It would be a typical direct response market play, not see, you can't make money doing it.

[06:10] You can, and that's, this is the big exception I'm having here, right?

[06:13] Is that like you can become a millionaire doing small games.

[06:17] All right.

[06:18] So I'm not saying you can't do it.

[06:19] You absolutely can.

[06:21] It's just that what type of game would you prefer to play?

[06:23] And I can say that as I've aged or weathered in the game, I continue to shift more and

[06:27] more towards branding.

[06:28] But I do think there's a balance that needs to be struck, but from a, from a branding perspective

[06:33] in that same example, it would be spending a year talking about what your values are,

[06:39] the stories that you want people to tell about you and your company.

[06:43] And then you can simply put your brand on a t-shirt and people will pay a hundred dollars

[06:49] for it, right?

[06:50] And so then what is the return on the advertising you did for that year?

[06:53] Well, if you can sell t-shirts for a hundred dollars rather than trying to arbitrage, you

[06:58] know, meme t-shirts and discounts and bundling and doing all sorts of more complex things

[07:03] and just simply saying if you believe what we believe vote with your dollars about the

[07:07] things that you care about, align with us.

[07:09] And that's fundamentally what branding is.

[07:11] When branding works very well is when what you are saying about your brand clarifies what

[07:16] people are already saying.

[07:18] And so a lot of times people have a general gist of what your brand is.

[07:21] Hopefully it's what you want, oftentimes it's not.

[07:25] And this is especially true in the direct response marketing community at large because

[07:29] people say terrible things about the people who are doing their direct response.

[07:33] And so their brand is the reputation and the things that other people say about you.

[07:37] And an example that Elon Musk gave in the interview, I can't remember where you gave

[07:40] it, he talked about how the consumer is the one that creates your brand.

[07:44] If you look at, I think he gave the example of Toyota and Ford, but the point is not

[07:48] necessarily the brands, but more so the message, which is he said, listen, you know,

[07:51] Ford talked about being reliable and being high quality, etc.

[07:56] He said, in Toyota, they're marketing never sit that.

[07:58] And yet Toyota is the company that's known for being reliable and high quality and things

[08:03] like that compared to the Ford's.

[08:04] Right?

[08:05] He said so as much, you can say whatever you want in the marketing messaging, but it has

[08:09] to be true.

[08:10] And so to my interpretation of that is what you want to do is give people the words to

[08:15] describe your brand that are true.

[08:18] And just give them the words to say, rather than trying to redefine the thoughts they

[08:23] have.

[08:24] And I think that that is really what comes to effective branding and doing that deliberately.

[08:27] As an added point to that, this is something that I got from Grand Cardone, which has

[08:31] been one of the really deep and profound lessons I think I got from our two conversations

[08:35] we've had about marketing in general.

[08:37] But one, first off, the many people who don't like Grant, you have to appreciate how effective

[08:44] he is promoting himself in his brand.

[08:46] You have to respect that.

[08:47] All right, you can, you can not like them in, but you can app, you must respect what his

[08:53] level of effort and the outcome and the output of his effort.

[08:56] Right?

[08:57] I personally, if I had nothing the positive interactions with the grant, but my point is,

[09:00] is that you have to respect that.

[09:01] Now that being said, one of the things that he said that I have really taken with me is

[09:05] the one or two words that someone will associate with your brand.

[09:10] He said, when they think, I want them to think this, right?

[09:15] And that is not this massive declarative value statement or mission statement because people

[09:21] don't care.

[09:23] Nor do they remember hardly anything.

[09:26] And so if you can get the masses to just remember, oh yeah, he's the real estate guy.

[09:31] He's the business builder guy, right?

[09:33] Which would be more aligned with what we do.

[09:35] We build businesses.

[09:36] And we buy interest in information, coaching, e-learning type businesses that are in

[09:42] a niche.

[09:43] And that's what I want people to associate.

[09:44] Now they're not going to remember all the stuff that I just said.

[09:46] But if they can just say like, he's the digital business builder, like digital business

[09:51] investor, either of those things would be things that I would say, okay, that's a positive

[09:55] association, that's the type of association that I want people to make with my brand.

[09:59] And the thing is, is that if I can wait a longer time, which is why most people cannot do

[10:04] this and why I'm not saying necessarily have to start branding day one.

[10:08] But if you can be cognizant of what the message that you were relying in your content and

[10:12] the advertising that you do, and I'm using advertising by the actual definition, which is

[10:16] to make known, right?

[10:18] When you make your products and services known in the many ways that you do it, if you can

[10:22] reinforce the simple message in every single thing, people will begin as long as it's

[10:28] aligned with what's true to say the same things back to you.

[10:31] And that will reinforce the cycle of who you are in the marketplace in what you stand

[10:35] for.

[10:36] And so if branding is a higher ROI activity overall, I believe it is.

[10:42] And I think that there's the many massive companies that exist out there would be great

[10:46] testaments and evidence to that point is that they don't engage in direct response marketing

[10:51] for the most part or even at all.

[10:53] To the vast, like the vast majority of the time, they are talking much more about who they

[10:58] are and what they stand for, right?

[11:00] Why they do what they do, right?

[11:01] And then people then buy their products and service in accordance with their values and

[11:06] they vote with their dollars with the things that they care about being the identity that

[11:10] they wish to associate with.

[11:12] And so I think that the recent setcode and started with direct response and then became

[11:16] and now talks to sushi about branding.

[11:18] The reason why it's in next started direct response and then talks way more about branding.

[11:21] The reason that I started direct response and talked much more about branding stuff.

[11:25] Now, at least that's my belief in where I think that it's because that's where you make

[11:28] more money just over a longer time horizon.

[11:33] And I think the reason that many direct response marketers burn out is because they don't

[11:36] like the brand that they are building for themselves, which is why most people leave the

[11:39] space over a long enough time horizon.

[11:42] And so that's why you don't see many, I'm not saying there aren't any, but the vast majority

[11:46] of direct response marketers tend to be younger.

[11:48] One of the difficult things about this and I was having a conversation with the friend

[11:51] about this is that because it is such a young space, there are not many people who have

[11:57] old lessons.

[11:59] The predominant education that exists in the spaces people who are new, the fact that

[12:04] someone can consider themselves a quote, OG in the Internet marketing space after three years

[12:08] is laughable, right?

[12:10] It's laughable to Larry's.

[12:11] But it's true.

[12:12] In that space, it's very difficult to be an OG because most people burn out because

[12:16] their brand equity drops so much, right?

[12:19] And so if the only way that we can build very big things is doing them the same thing

[12:24] over a long period of time, then it would create the, I don't know, say obvious, but a

[12:29] natural conclusion that branding is the direction that more people end up going in once

[12:32] they have the ability to do so.

[12:35] And so if you can delay the ask and you can have the resources and you can have the patience

[12:40] to build something bigger, your goodwill will compound faster than your revenue will in a

[12:45] direct response marketing environment.

[12:48] And so this is the concept around give, give, give, give, give, give, give, give, give, give,

[12:54] give, give, give, get.

[12:57] And what's interesting is that I think most people in the prospects that are consuming

[13:02] your, your content and things like that, they are waiting for the other shoe to drop.

[13:06] They're waiting for you to make the ask.

[13:10] And so they have their guard up, but if you give, give, give, and then right when they're

[13:15] expecting you to ask, give again, and then again, and give even more, their guard begins

[13:20] to drop and then they start to think, man, this guy or this guy or this guy is awesome.

[13:25] I really like this person.

[13:27] And then something interesting happens.

[13:29] They start telling people about you because they don't believe that they're sacrificing

[13:32] their own brand equity by sharing your message.

[13:35] That is where the compounding effects of word of mouth start to take off.

[13:40] And so when I say that goodwill compounds faster than revenue, it's because in the traditional

[13:43] example, it would be give, give, give, ask.

[13:46] And this isn't me pooping career or anything like that.

[13:47] I mean, I think that very much at least establishing that cadence is useful for most people

[13:51] who are doing a direct response.

[13:53] At least give something before you ask, right?

[13:55] But if rather than asking, right, where you have to start over at zero because you build

[14:00] your build equity, you build value in the relationship and then you're asking you back

[14:03] down as you're on the, you build it and you go back down as you're on the, you

[14:05] basically always cap by the amount of value that you have in the relationship.

[14:10] That's the cap, right?

[14:12] But the alternative, if you were to look at this visually, would be give, give, give, give,

[14:16] give, give, give, give and then it keeps going, the chart keeps going off.

[14:19] And then at a certain point, a certain percentage of that audience because they have, they

[14:24] are reciprocal in nature type people.

[14:26] They will take steps towards you without you even asking simply because they believe so

[14:31] strongly in what you have and those the types of clients, right, that you want to be able

[14:35] to take on.

[14:36] It just takes patients to get there.

[14:38] But when you have those types of clients, they get better results, they pay bigger

[14:41] premiums and that also gives you implied scarcity within your products and services

[14:44] and you're always understanding your demand, which will essentially eliminate your bottleneck

[14:49] that you have in growing because you will always have more demand than you can possibly

[14:54] handle.

[14:55] And that is the benefit of building the brand over the long term, rather than simply the

[15:00] one-two punches in order to extract capital today.

[15:03] And so if you can delay the amount of time that you have between when you provide value

[15:07] and when you ask an ideally you never do.

[15:10] You simply allow the goodwill to continue to compound, allow the word of mouth to continue

[15:14] to grow, to the point where you start receiving money probably far further in the future

[15:18] than you are now and what you are accustomed to doing.

[15:21] But in that future state, you can then look at the minimal amount that you're spending, right

[15:26] in order to distribute your message to advertise, right, to make known.

[15:29] And then you will see that you have significantly higher returns on your advertising efforts,

[15:33] it just took longer to get there.

[15:35] And so understanding that it's been branding in direct response and having a longer-term

[15:39] perspective and looking at the OGs in the space or lack thereof, the people who have

[15:43] transitioned from direct response to branding, I think that there is a lot of lessons that

[15:47] we can take from it and this is just one of them that I wanted to share with you.

[15:50] And if you're new to the channel, walk into Mozy Nation, I said this earlier, but our

[15:53] profilit is about $E5 million, it's actually been a little higher than that, I just

[15:56] tried to consistent, but I think it's probably over 100 now.

[15:58] But I make these videos because I struggle a lot coming up and I hope that the pain that

[16:03] I went through is not for nothing.

[16:05] And so that's why I make these videos.

[16:06] So I just hope you like it.

[16:10] So anyways, keep being awesome and I'll see you guys in the next fit.

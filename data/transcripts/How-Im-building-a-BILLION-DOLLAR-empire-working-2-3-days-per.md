[00:00] This video is for all my friends who are doing 1 million, 3 million, 5 million dollars a year and who come to me and are always like man

[00:07] I want to challenge this is so boring. I want to do something new and exciting

[00:11] And so let me tell you a story about my neighbor and so my neighbor had a trash business

[00:17] All right trash collection business about his boring is it gets and he sold his business a few years back for a lot of money

[00:23] I'll just put it that way and I was walking one day and he was like watering his lawn

[00:28] And I was like hey man, you know what's going on and he said I just got out of my non-complete

[00:34] And I was like oh, that's awesome. So, you know, what do you plan on doing? He's like well

[00:38] I plan on doing the exact same thing again and I was like wait, what do you mean? He was like well

[00:43] I plan on starting another trash business and selling it right back to the guys who bought my last one

[00:47] And I was like what and like he could tell that I was kind of like confused by this and he was like

[00:52] He's like why would I learn something new? He's like I already knew everything about the trash business

[00:56] He's like I'll just do it again. It just really hit me because I was like

[01:01] So many entrepreneurs myself included right and I made this mistake so many times early on in my career

[01:06] We desire novelty we desire challenges we want growth right but the thing is is that we think growth means new

[01:13] When I think that a lot of times we could redefine growth as meaning we develop the character traits to be able to

[01:18] Persist and continue to do the same things over and over again

[01:21] You don't see these real estate moguls for example being like man. I've built you know 20 million dollars in real estate

[01:26] I kind of just need a challenge. I'm gonna start I'm gonna start a restaurant right they don't do that

[01:30] I mean think about how stupid that would sound to you your life. Dude you're so good at real estate

[01:34] Just keep doing real estate right but I see this especially in the market and community more than anything

[01:39] Is this this need for

[01:41] Constant change and and and and growth and challenge right but I think you need to redefine the challenges

[01:47] This is becoming hard for you because you're getting bored so the challenge is learning to a be comfortable with boredom or be

[01:54] Not needed because the business doesn't exist to satisfy our

[01:59] Internal deficiencies right and that's usually almost of a spill that we're insecure

[02:02] We need connection we need we want status right these are the things that we build our business to solve

[02:07] But our business doesn't actually need to solve any of those things that just needs to provide value to the customer

[02:12] And then we try and extrapolate our project our own needs on the business

[02:17] And in so doing break our businesses and make the wrong decision and so let me tell you different story

[02:21] So I've had one two three different guys

[02:26] Tell me in the in the internet marketing space who I say once doing 15 to 20 million

[02:31] Another is doing about 10 million others doing about 10 million a year

[02:34] Probably in the neighborhood of like three-ish million in profit per year around there three to five

[02:39] And so each of them on their own reached out to me and said hey man, I think I'm gonna start

[02:45] A software company because I'm I'm not I'm not challenged enough doing this anymore, right and

[02:49] And I thought about that and I just thought how kind of hilarious it was

[02:53] It's like I've risen to the top of my game

[02:55] I'm bored doing what I'm doing and so I'm gonna stop doing this and then I'm gonna enter a new arena where everyone else has been doing that for 10 years

[03:01] And there are other kingfins in that arena and I'm gonna try and relearn everything from ground zero

[03:07] And then try and beat them now here's what's interesting, right here's what's crazy

[03:12] If you were to let's say make a hundred thousand dollars a year in your business

[03:16] And you decide that you're going to be a true entrepreneur and I mean you never gonna quit and it means that you're gonna continue to do business for

[03:22] You know 40 years or whatever right if you were to gain at the same pace as the marketplace

[03:27] Which by the way when you're smaller is really easy right it's 10% here

[03:30] If you were to grow by 10% here by the end of the 40 years you would have a gazillion dollars, right?

[03:35] But most people are always trying to beat the market when in reality if you just matched the market

[03:40] You would become

[03:41] Extraordinarily crazy wealthy at the end of this game

[03:45] But because we are so frenetic and we have these insecurities that we project on our business and then force our business

[03:50] To solve our own personal issues

[03:52] We end up breaking the thing that is actually working just fine because we have these interpersonal needs that we're trying to satisfy

[03:58] And this was very hard for me to learn I'm saying this because for me

[04:01] This was a mistake that I made over and over again

[04:03] Probably for the first four years of business for me

[04:05] I tried to make my business solve my personal problems when it really just needed to solve my clients problems

[04:10] And I needed to do with my own personal stuff, right?

[04:13] One of the things that I wanted to give you was the ways that I create

[04:17] Challenges for myself

[04:19] Within the business without destroying the business all right so let me give you two different things that have been complete life-savours for me

[04:25] So I have desires for innovation. I've desires for new things, right?

[04:30] And so

[04:31] Where to channel that is not to create new businesses

[04:34] Where to channel that is to create new

[04:36] Friends or new back ends, I mean like how can I change the hooks?

[04:40] How can I change the creative how can I change the aditias the marketing the front ends that bring people in because the more variety

[04:47] I have there the more different types of avatars I'm going to attract and ultimately grow the business

[04:50] So you can use that entrepreneurial ADD but use it in a way that's going to serve you right and serve the business without rather than breaking the business

[04:57] Right whereas if you start creating more businesses to satisfy your ADD then when ends of happening is well

[05:03] You know you have lots of businesses and you don't have any money

[05:05] That's the first thing the second thing that I do

[05:08] That when walking through is understanding constraints all right one of the the lessons that I've learned over the last 12 months is

[05:14] Multiple metrics for success and so I'll dive more to that in another video

[05:18] But basically for a very long time my life the only metric for success that I had was how much profit and how much increase in that worth

[05:24] I had at the end of the year that was at the lack of aditias

[05:26] And I think that as we've gotten to the point where like an increase in net worth the marginal utility of more money

[05:32] Meaning like the amount of extra good that I can purchase or that more money can purchase me is very very little

[05:37] Right there's nothing that an extra $10 million or an extra

[05:41] $50 million is going to purchase me that the first you know 50 is a money right there's nothing

[05:45] Right that there's nothing that I can't already get right and so when you think about things like that

[05:50] Right what it forces you to do is

[05:53] Create different ways to win right because it's a game right if you're entrepreneurial then you all you should

[05:58] Especially if you become more successful you'll see it as a game right and so you have this game that we're playing and

[06:03] We have these metrics for success that originally are just increasing that worth right

[06:07] But then you can say can I increase my net worth and have a good marriage can I increase my net worth and and

[06:12] Be in shape right and so one of the constraints that I'd like to offer you as a challenge to give to yourself

[06:18] So that you don't get bored in the business that you have is a

[06:21] Is a constraint around time right and so that was one of the things that I did in over the last 12 months was like okay

[06:27] I want to build something that does a billion dollars a year in revenue

[06:32] Which is the goal for the portfolio and transparently we're not there

[06:35] You know where to about $85 million a year across our portfolio

[06:38] We're still a little short

[06:40] But it's a good thing to focus on now the thing is is that I don't want to make and

[06:46] The way that I have to make that is it I can't I'm not gonna outwork to get to a billion

[06:50] You have to make good decisions and you have to let company work in your favor right because if we have the 85 million and we give grow by 10%

[06:57] year in you know 20 years will probably be there right and

[07:01] So well, let's see a doubling would happen every seven years

[07:04] So 21 years would be double double double so that would be two four eight so eight times

[07:10] 85 no we'd still be so we need another doubling so we'd have to like 28 years from now

[07:14] We could be it if we just grow at the market rate right which is pretty encouraging I think I think we can beat the market

[07:19] But anyways the point is

[07:21] Adding constraints makes the goals far more interesting because I think the first level of achieving any goal is learning how to sacrifice everything to achieve the goal

[07:29] So I think

[07:30] Candidly I don't know many people who are super successful who haven't done that you have to be able to put everything

[07:34] You have only all sort of success and sacrifice it for what you want some people may not like that idea

[07:39] And that's fine. I don't I just don't know people who are all true successful who have done that and the reason they are willing to sacrifice everything is because the deficiency

[07:45] They have in their soul is so great that the pain they're suffering from is like for not having the thing is so great that they'll put everything else

[07:51] On the altar for their success and I know that I did that first hand and so I remember even when I was when I was growing growing into this entrepreneur

[07:58] Or all that I didn't tell myself

[07:59] I'm gonna not work everyone because I didn't even think that was realistic

[08:02] I said I will out sacrifice everyone's one of my competitors are going up to dinner when my competitors are hanging out with the kids my competitors are hanging out with their wives or being good

[08:08] Husband's I was like I will get ahead that was what I told myself and it worked

[08:13] But at a certain point and this is why multiple metrics of success are important

[08:17] The new goals that I'm setting have constraints on it because anyone can just sacrifice everything

[08:23] To get what they want but the question is can I

[08:26] Build a billion dollar a year of new portfolio working to her three days a week right and

[08:32] Can I do that also while being in competitive shape physically right and working out one to two hours a day because I like it

[08:39] Can I do all those things and so this is kind of the new levels of challenge I'm doing rather than trying to break what I have and going

[08:45] Doing ten other new things

[08:47] It's like can I add constraints the existing game to make the game more fun for me without breaking the machine because ultimately like the machine doesn't serve to

[08:54] It doesn't exist to serve me

[08:56] It exists to serve the customer and making sure that I don't complete those two things

[08:59] Has been a very valuable lesson in the very beginning for me. I'll tell you the story when I when I started

[09:05] The first time where I really saw success was when I learned how to sacrifice I was saying sacrifice earlier

[09:11] So I'll tell you how actually learn how to do this so when I was in college

[09:13] I ended up pledging in fraternity and it was a very hard pledging process hard being like time consuming right

[09:20] And I think we had to basically every hour of the day minus three hours and minus class time

[09:25] So we had three hours study hall and we had

[09:27] Whatever class time was all the rest of the time we had during the day

[09:30] We had to be at the house and doing chores and stuff and so that was pretty miserable and that wasn't like you know

[09:35] Autotodified but what ended up happening was I

[09:39] End up getting really good grades that semester in college and it was because they forced me to do three hours a day every single day of homework

[09:46] And if you do three hours a day of work every day and this is what I realized in college

[09:50] There's the days that you don't have work to do if you still work three hours you get ahead on a future work

[09:55] And so I realized that for only three hours a day if I just did that I would I think that that's a mess

[10:00] I got like a three eight three years something like that what I did after I finished pledging was I realized that all these extra hours the day were mine

[10:05] And so what I did was I was like well if I can just study all the rest of the hours then I should do really really well

[10:10] And that ended up being a really good methodology was I just sacrificed it all of my day

[10:15] So I basically went to the gym went to the library and went to class and I was it and I I

[10:21] That was it. I never worked past nine p.m. and I went out almost the night to the week

[10:25] But by always doing it that way and not wasting my time I ended up doing really well

[10:28] It was the first time I ever learned how to sacrifice everything which was everything else

[10:32] I just didn't do anything besides work work out and go to class like that was it throw on day

[10:37] And so when I started applying that same kind of concept to business

[10:40] It was actually fairly easy for me because I was so used to sacrificing everything

[10:44] I just switched over what I was sacrificing for it and

[10:47] I think that you have to learn how to sacrifice first in order to learn how not to sacrifice later

[10:54] Right because a lot of people are like why would I want to achieve the success?

[10:56] You have or whatever, but I don't want to sacrifice Xy and Z

[10:59] I just I think you can say that I just don't know anyone who's done it

[11:03] It's kind of like saying I want to get over the the whole that money has on my life except

[11:07] I haven't made any money. I think you have to achieve something before you can give it up

[11:11] right I mean Buddha who who gave up his his worldly riches like he talks

[11:16] You know he he walked the middle path because he had been extremely wealthy in a prince and then given it all up and lived as a poor person

[11:22] And then walked the middle path and so I think that in order for us to walk the middle path in life

[11:26] We have to have achieved the thing in order we have to achieve mastery over the thing before we can truly master it and mean and give it away

[11:33] Right and that's how we can eliminate the desire desire for the thing because we truly know what it's like to have it

[11:38] Right and then that means we can truly know why we don't need it and so I think that's um

[11:43] I know it didn't mean to get 100% business philosopher on you

[11:47] But that's that's kind of where I think this goes full circle. So big picture here

[11:52] Multiple metrics of success don't change your business just to challenge yourself find new ways to either create

[11:58] Front ends or new product lines or things like that within your business that can satisfy your ADD and if neither of those things

[12:04] Or what you want to do then just use constraints to create challenges in your own business that improve your life in other ways

[12:11] Right and you can always go back to my neighbor

[12:15] The guy who sold his business for trash his trash business for a lot of money and and just say he's like

[12:21] Why would I learn another business when I'm already really good at this one?

[12:24] He's like I'd have to learn everything from ground one. He's like that just sounds hard and stupid

[12:28] And I couldn't really argue with the wisdom of that advice because he doesn't use his business to satisfy his interpersonal desires

[12:34] He uses business to create wealth, which was the whole point

[12:37] So anyways, I hope you found value in this video

[12:39] clicks a private if you did more videos like this to help you make more money

[12:43] Most of your nation keep being awesome and I'll catch you guys on the flip side. Bye

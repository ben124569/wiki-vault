[00:00] I'm gonna start a $10 million trash collecting business.

[00:03] So if you want to start a business, this video is for you.

[00:05] We're gonna turn this trash into cash.

[00:08] The first thing you need to do is get customers.

[00:10] And the easiest way to do that is to talk to people you already know.

[00:13] And the easiest way to do that is to pull up your phone,

[00:16] looking your contacts, and find one, let's call, Caleb.

[00:21] Hey, what's up, man? Are you at that wedding?

[00:23] I am, yeah.

[00:24] Well, quick question for you.

[00:26] This may seem out of the blue.

[00:28] Is anyone taking out your trash?

[00:30] Oh, shit.

[00:31] No, it's probably just sitting there smelling awful.

[00:35] Do you know anybody else who might be at the wedding who's also not taking out their trash?

[00:39] Probably, but what are you talking about?

[00:42] It is out of blue. I'll explain why.

[00:43] So right now, I'm starting my little trash clean business.

[00:46] I want to help 5 or 10 people and just do my service for free.

[00:49] I'll do everything.

[00:50] And if it is good, if you're opening a leave me review,

[00:53] I mean the world to me. And if it sucks, I'll be telling me so I can make a better.

[00:56] Do you doubt the perfect time for a drink?

[00:58] I might fucking hate touching that drink.

[01:00] Well, tell you what, why don't I do it for free?

[01:02] You're helping me out.

[01:03] If it's good and you like the service,

[01:05] I can talk to you about what it would look like afterwards in like two weeks.

[01:09] That work?

[01:10] That sounds incredible. Yeah, thank you.

[01:12] And the other folks that you know,

[01:14] do you think you do a three-way text intro with me?

[01:16] Yeah, absolutely.

[01:17] Thanks for supporting me, man. I really appreciate it.

[01:19] So that is number one of four different ways that one person can let other people know

[01:24] about their stuff. There are eight ways in total, but today we're only going to talk about

[01:27] four of them. And they are called Unsurprisingly The Core 4.

[01:31] Well, in the Money Center where we break down

[01:34] this week's Money Making activities, here we've got a strapping.

[01:38] Men in what appears to be a TECCDO tank top, we're going to watch the scheme footage.

[01:44] Are you at that wedding?

[01:45] Interesting first question. I guess this is a personalized tidbit that you found out

[01:50] from the social media is doing a little pre-research or pre-search.

[01:54] This may seem out of the blue. Is anyone taking out your trash?

[01:57] Woooo! And right for the right for the jugular. All right, let's see what was just happening.

[02:01] All right, so we acknowledge that they said they were going to the wedding.

[02:03] The compliment was that, oh, that's nice.

[02:05] Now, could he have come out for a better compliment for sure?

[02:07] I'd give that a four out of ten on the compliment scale.

[02:09] Now, what he didn't do was tie to a positive character trait.

[02:12] That would have been bonus points. Now, what does he do next?

[02:15] He asks another question and leaves the conversation whatever direction

[02:18] he wants to go in this instance talking about trash.

[02:22] Anytime someone is doing something that you want to do for them,

[02:25] they spend the same resource, which is time.

[02:27] And so all you have to do, whether you're struggling, fitness services, cleaning services,

[02:30] trash-to-get services, IT services, whatever it is, you say, hey, how's all this stuff going?

[02:36] They say great and you say, how do you have time to insert the thing that you're trying to sell?

[02:41] And everyone's like, man, I wish I had more time and you said, oh boy, I just

[02:46] happened to be a time salesman and I can give you some back.

[02:48] All right, let's go back into this game footage.

[02:51] It looks like he's falling a script which makes it less impressive or does it.

[02:55] He's actually falling a script because if you don't know what you're doing,

[02:58] just stick with the script. I think that's what he's actually reading.

[03:02] Do you think he can read? Do you know anybody else who might be at the wedding who's also-

[03:05] But he already assumed the clothes on this one and he's going for more.

[03:09] Do you know anybody who is looking to three Malcolm, not have the trash during the wedding?

[03:14] As a quick tidbit. This isn't now a line. It's not going to be perfect and honestly when you do

[03:18] 20 or 30 or 50 of these, you'll start to find your own rhythm. These are the big things.

[03:22] If we're thinking about these as milestones, it's like, hey, I'm not asking them.

[03:26] I'm asking if they know anybody. Now, in this particular instance,

[03:29] I was like, man, I he clearly exhibited the issue, but if you've been like, no,

[03:34] I actually do have somebody who's taking the trash or whatever.

[03:37] A couple of directions you could go there. It'd be like, awesome if they're doing it for free.

[03:40] And then they would say, no, it'd be like, well, I will. And then boom, you can get the business.

[03:44] Or you just say, hey, do you know anybody who is? It's a very easy transition.

[03:47] So you're not asking them for business. You're not soliciting.

[03:49] Grasky thing nobody. And so then you give them the reason why. Because I'm taking on five

[03:52] case studies. Now, case studies is a word that I didn't use in this. But if you said, hey,

[03:56] I'm taking on five trials or five people for free. And I'm just trying to get some testimonies.

[04:00] Some reviews. Okay. Let's go back to the the game footage. If it sucks, I hope you tell

[04:04] me, so I can make a better. And we just outlined both outcomes and areas in the explanation,

[04:09] which is either I'm good and you leave me review, which is my ask or I suck and you just tell

[04:14] me so either you get feedback or you get a review. And it works great. And the nice thing is,

[04:20] you can make money three different ways from somebody for free. Because everybody in the

[04:23] stands is like, how are you gonna make money? Give them all your stuff for free. Your time is valuable.

[04:27] Your time isn't valuable because if it were valuable, we'd be making money. And if you're not

[04:29] making money right now, guess what? Value says zero. This gives you practice and feedback from

[04:35] friendlies, which is a great way to start. Category one is that they will get the free service and

[04:39] be like this is awesome. Keep doing it and I'll pay you. They literally just become customers.

[04:43] Option two is they then say, hey, I don't want to do this, but I'll leave you review. So then you

[04:48] get a review. Version three of them making the money is that they just send you a friend, even if it's

[04:53] not them. And they could do all of those things. Somebody could leave you review, send you a friend,

[04:57] and become a customer. But they could do any of those things individually. And if you want secret

[05:00] door number four, they could also say, you know what you work at. I don't want to send you a friend,

[05:04] and I don't want to be a customer, but I'll tell you what you could do better. And that also makes

[05:08] you money in the long term. Why don't I do it for free? You're helping me out and see, notice the

[05:13] frame. You're helping me out letting me do this for free. It's not, hey, you owe me one because I'm

[05:21] doing this for free for you. Wrong frame mind. If you come in at that, you're gonna be a weirdo

[05:26] and everyone's gonna sense it because you're gonna have this weird resentment towards people

[05:29] because you're like, I can't believe when we're giving this stuff away for free, they should be

[05:32] thanking me. No, they shouldn't. Because you have no reputation and you have no track record. Because if you

[05:37] did, you wouldn't have to give it away for free. But you are because you haven't done it again. And that's okay.

[05:42] And notice he's still reading from this, this screen. So he might not even have a brain.

[05:46] Brains are optional in this. That's how simple this is when you ask people who know you. The other

[05:51] folks that you know, do you think you do it three way text intro with me? Ooh, snuck you back in.

[05:55] Remember earlier you said, hey, do you know anybody said, you know some people? He remembered and

[06:00] said, hey, why don't we do a three way? Not the way you're thinking. I see you. But how do we do a three way

[06:05] intro? And the reason you do that is because if you say, hey, can you make the intro to me? They have to

[06:10] remember. But if you say right now, hey, do a three way text while I'm here, there's two things

[06:15] happen. What is that? You get the lead. And here's the second sneaky thing that happens.

[06:19] Is that because you actually have an intro of a third party in the message group, the person who's

[06:24] getting introed is way less rude. Overall, I think I think four and a half out of ten.

[06:29] Maybe a four point six, and I'm mostly giving that because of the hair and the Tuxedo tank.

[06:34] Regardless, this goes to show you that you don't need to have a brain. You can follow half of a script.

[06:38] And you can still get a customer by talking to people who you know and asking them if they know

[06:41] anybody. And just like that, you can start your trash cleaning business because they're always you can

[06:45] make money from three people. They become customers. They leave you a review. You get you a customer.

[06:49] They send you a friend for they give you feedback. They can make you better so that you can eventually

[06:53] actually be worth what you want to turn. But there are two limitations. Let's walk this way.

[06:57] First limitation is that you only have so much time. You're going to be calling people

[07:00] going to reach out to people and trying to get them to try your services or your products of some sort.

[07:06] You can only do that so many hours a day because it's just you.

[07:09] Limitation number two is that you only know so many people. You add up your email list,

[07:12] your contacts and your phone, your followers on social media across every platform that you're on,

[07:17] if you're on platforms. You might have a thousand people who know you. Well, if you did a

[07:21] hundred of those a day in ten days, you would have reached out to everybody. Now, that doesn't

[07:25] mean that you shouldn't reach out to them again. You should. But at that point, you start to run

[07:28] into some friction. So we just got our first customers from warm outreach. As in talking to people,

[07:33] we know one on one. Now we're going to transition to getting our first customers from posting free

[07:38] contact. Ah, that'd be light. Good on. Cool. Where are the best way to get your husband to take the

[07:44] trash out? Two things. Number one, instead of saying, hey honey, will you take the trash out?

[07:49] Say, hey, would you mind taking the trash out? Hey, would you be opposed to taking the trash out?

[07:54] Would it be a huge inconvenience for you to take the trash out? If you say it like that,

[07:58] instead of a yes-based question, it's a no-based question because they're like, no,

[08:02] wouldn't be a huge inconvenience. I would mind it all. And then they take it for you because people

[08:05] are more likely to say no to things than yes, but you get them to say yes by saying no. The other

[08:10] way to make sure they keep doing it is that after your husband or your spouse does it,

[08:14] that you reward them for doing it. And that's where you say, thanks so much. That meant so much to me.

[08:18] It's like, you're my hero. Any of those types of things make it more likely that someone's

[08:22] going to do it again. Now, if you don't want to use any of these persuasion tactics, just call

[08:28] 1-800-Alex trash and I'll do it for you and you can say you got it for your husband as to give

[08:32] because he means so much to you. For ashes gross. But if you're one of those people,

[08:38] there's three ways that you can actually not have to touch your trash. Wait, number one, use a bag.

[08:43] You take the bag, just like a pooper scuper, you take your hand, and then you can go over the whole

[08:48] thing and then you dump it. Wait, number two, is you use tools like these. Go down, touch your trash,

[08:57] and there you go. Hands free. And wait, number three, you can call 1-800-Alex trash because I love

[09:03] the smell of trash and I will do it for you and you are helping somebody who actually has barely

[09:08] any way to smell. And so I wear these because I can't smell that good. And so this is a natural

[09:12] line of work for me because I can do something that doesn't bother me at all about this other

[09:16] beat. Here's how making free content works. Do you make free valuable stuff for your audience so

[09:19] much though that they say give us more? Give us more could either be more free value or

[09:24] paying you money for the services that you offer. Now let's actually break this down in real time

[09:29] with these videos. What are the best way to get your husband to take the trash out? What was that?

[09:34] That was part one of content, which is hook. Now, notice how many seconds is that? Three seconds in.

[09:41] The first three seconds are the most important three seconds in the content video. Two things.

[09:46] Number one, so notice I have a two step framework that I then introduce in the beginning.

[09:51] Give step one, give what it is, then give an explanation of why it works, and then I move on to

[09:56] step two and repeat the cycle. And so that is a retaining cycle, which you can either use lists,

[10:02] steps, or stories, or combinations of all three to keep the audience engaged. And right now,

[10:07] I'm going through lists, steps, and stories making this. Now let's keep watching this one and see

[10:13] just call it 1-800-ALX trash and I'll do it for you and you can say you got it for your husband

[10:18] as you give because he means so much to you. And so the idea with the reward is that you want someone to

[10:22] share the last piece. So it's either something that diverts the audience, meaning something that they

[10:26] laugh at, or think is funny, or it's some sort of action that you're going to have them take.

[10:30] Now ideally here, this is funny enough that someone would send it to their friends. Now let's look at

[10:35] number two and break this one down together. Trash is gross to everyone but me. So trash is gross

[10:41] to everyone but me is a weird but probably effective hook because curiosity, if you're like,

[10:46] why is this person talking about this? And the thing with content is you're going to make many,

[10:50] many, many, many things. And sometimes you would be surprised by what works and what does it.

[10:54] So oftentimes you can start with a crazy topic, or you can start with a crazy question, or just a

[10:59] factor of statement that people might find jarring. Any of those things might catch someone's

[11:03] attention so that they keep watching. Wait number one, use a bag. And so each of these is an open loop.

[11:10] So I'm opening the loop and then I close it with what the thing is but you're still like what's

[11:14] number two and what's number three and the idea is that you retain them so that they watch it.

[11:18] And wait number three, as you can call 1-800-ALX-Trash because I love the smell of trash. There you go.

[11:24] Fun little wrap up on the video, we've got a hook. We've got some retention tactic which has a list

[11:29] of step-of-story and then some sort of a word-of-call action at the end. And just like that,

[11:33] we have made two pieces of content following the hook, retain, reward framework that you can use

[11:39] for any type of business. Now, pro tip on this, if I were to start a local trash business,

[11:43] I would say there's one of two directions I would take my content in general. You could also

[11:46] in or splice them. One is actually talking to consumers and saying here, here's some tips about

[11:50] trash you probably didn't know about. Things that can make their life better independent of using

[11:54] my services, or you could make content targeted at people who you'd want to work at your trash company.

[12:00] So it might be targeted more around what a salesman job or a trash collecting job might look like

[12:05] so that you can attract more talent. Either of those strategies work and you could probably

[12:08] do both together because you would eventually just be known as the trash cake. All right, I'm going to

[12:11] give you a couple quick tips that have worked well for me on making content. Number one, people need

[12:16] to be reminded more than need to be taught. So a lot of times we have this idea that I've said this

[12:20] thing one time in content, therefore I should never say it again because I would be repeating myself.

[12:25] But it's arrogant to assume that 100% of your audience, 100% of the time,

[12:30] consumes 100% of your content. And also that if they consume something one time, they wouldn't want

[12:36] to consume it again and or a version that's just slightly different from the original.

[12:41] You'll probably see tweet reels for me that also appear in video format for me that also make

[12:47] their way into captions and fool posts on the exact same concept and then I also talk about them

[12:53] in podcasts. Think about yourself, who do you follow? You probably know the themes of stuff that

[12:58] they're talking about on a regular basis and you follow them because you want to be reminded.

[13:01] I've watched comedians do the same bit over and over again because I think it's hilarious. And so

[13:06] it works the same way with your own content. If people like something, make more of it.

[13:10] Another one is that in the content that I just showed you, I made a call to action at the end.

[13:14] You could obviously not make a call to action at the end at all. You could just make the content

[13:19] and cut it and then that would be perfectly fine and you could just expect that people would

[13:23] make comments. They would like it or sometimes DM you anyways just because they want to find out more.

[13:27] I think that down actually would work because I made the third way kind of funny. And the cool thing

[13:32] is that anybody who likes or engages or comments on your posts are leads because you can then

[13:38] message them. A lead is a person you can contact and an engage lead is someone who has shown

[13:41] interested in the stuff that you have. We create content so that we can get people to engage so that

[13:46] we can then say, hey, I saw that you engage with my thing. That gives you a reason to reach out to them

[13:51] without seeming like a scumbag. And so like that is how you can generate leads for free using content.

[13:56] I'm going to give you a frame shift that helped me a lot in the beginning. When you're making content

[14:01] looking at the number of views can be depressing because then you think, man, I suck no one likes me.

[14:07] But I started to imagine whatever the number of views was as the size of a room I was talking

[14:12] in. And so if I was willing to do a lunch and learn from my trash business with 15 people in it,

[14:18] I was stoked. And so the idea that 17 people watched my video is a full room. It's a classroom.

[14:24] And so the idea that I could do that and reach them for free, just reframing it and not comparing it

[14:29] to what a million clip view is. But just saying, what does 17 people look like? Wow, that was worth it.

[14:34] And if you can keep that perspective, it becomes way less discouraging. And everyone starts at

[14:40] this one big magical number. It's not bad. It's not you sock. It's not that you're late. Everyone starts

[14:48] here and you build from there. And so that is how we got our customers from our second

[14:52] different way to advertise, posting free content. Now we'll transition to reaching out to strangers

[14:58] one on one to get our next customers.

[15:13] Hello. Hey, how's it going? Pretty good. Reason I'm not going on your door is because I

[15:17] helped the Johnson's your neighbor take out their trash. And they sent me over here to ask you

[15:22] if you have somebody who takes care of your trash for you.

[15:26] Well, would you be opposed to me doing it for you? No, no actually that sounds incredible.

[15:31] All right, well fantastic. So if you have any trash right now, I can just grab it.

[15:35] Yeah, I think it was it. Yeah. All right, fantastic. So I can take that out to my truck and then I'll

[15:40] get the rest of your stuff. Do you know what I touch the only thing? So like that was a very helpful thing.

[15:47] Hello. Hey, how's it going? Good. Reason here because I took out the Johnson's trash.

[15:55] That's what I do for a living. And I was curious if you have somebody who takes out your trash.

[16:00] I do. Yeah. Well, are they as awesome and smiley as me?

[16:04] I'm here. Do they also do it for free for this month? No.

[16:11] Because I'll do both those the extra smiley stuff is on me.

[16:14] If it's actually free. Yeah. Yeah, it's free for the first month and after that it goes at 29 bucks a month.

[16:18] Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's do it. Okay. Fantastic. Well, if you've got a bag,

[16:22] I'll grab what I have and then I'll bring them out to the truck and I'll come back with my cleaning spots. Yeah. Let's do it. All right.

[16:32] Hey, how's it going? Hello. Hello.

[16:36] I take out the Johnson's trash and they wanted me to take out your...

[16:40] So guess what just happened? I got to know and guess how much poor I am.

[16:44] 0% poor and so you know what? Yes, this can change your life but you can have in many

[16:50] noses you want and nothing else changes. And so all we do is we roll the dice again.

[16:58] Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, and we're back. For the cold outreach breakdown. It is you reaching out

[17:05] 101 to strangers and you can do that. Be a email phone call, direct message, SMS,

[17:10] voice mail or knocking on someone's door like I demonstrate it. Now let's break down these puppies

[17:15] one by one. This was the nice guy. Reason I'm knocking on your door? So right before we get into this,

[17:20] there's a lot of setup here. So number one, I have trash over my shoulder. The reason for that is

[17:25] because I'm already visually demonstrating what I do and especially I'm dressed in work clothes.

[17:29] You might think it's this person here to fix something. I have curiosity working on my side because

[17:33] he might have a people or look through the window before answering the door which most people do.

[17:38] So before even getting the knock in the door, I'm trying to look a certain way so that it increases

[17:42] the likelihood that they open the door. Now the second thing is that I've got a huge secret weapon

[17:47] that most people don't do. So the reason I talked earlier about giving away free stuff is that

[17:51] once you do give one person free stuff, what do you think you should do with that free person?

[17:55] You should leverage it to the greatest degree possible to make as much money as you possibly can

[17:59] for giving away something for free. Because if I can get 10 more sales from the one person I give for free

[18:03] by name dropping them or by using them as an intro or segue into a sales pitch, that's worth

[18:08] giving away the service for one person. And so in this example, the Johnson's which is the neighbor,

[18:14] I can give one person in an entire neighborhood free service and then go to every other door and

[18:20] say, hey, I work with the Johnson's which then creates trust and they're like, okay, this is legit

[18:26] and then I can bridge in. So right now and I do that in the first couple seconds because I want to

[18:30] disarrange them so they don't act rudely to me. If someone knows that you know someone they know,

[18:35] they will act much more polite to you and be far more likely to give you more time to make whatever

[18:40] presentation you want to make. And they sent me over here to ask you if you have somebody who takes

[18:44] carry your trash. Notice the question that I'm asking after proceeding it with, I help the Johnson's out,

[18:50] I ask the individual, does he have somebody who's doing this particular service? Because I'm not saying,

[18:57] do you want me to take a trash out for you? I'm asking if they have someone who's doing it.

[19:00] Because then I'm leading them in a path that I haven't answered on both sides. It's a yes no

[19:04] question that I have 100% response that's good on either scenario. So this one is an easy one because

[19:11] they're like, I don't have anybody who does this particular service and believe it or not,

[19:14] it's crazy as it sounds. It's actually even better sometimes that they do have someone because

[19:19] that means they already are willing to pay for the service. So by the way, if someone already has

[19:23] or pays for something, they're more likely to buy from you, not less. Would you be opposed to

[19:28] me doing it for you? And so that's the no-based question. So rather than saying, hey, do you want me to do it?

[19:32] I'm saying, would you be opposed to, or to be a great inconvenience to you? It's set or a,

[19:36] where it's an easier yes by saying no than a pure yes based question. For all the yes based salesmen,

[19:41] myself included, I've closed plenty of sales under saying, you ready to start?

[19:44] Open and go on on Monday. Let's get started. Whatever. It doesn't mean it doesn't work. It just

[19:48] means that in general, when you ask a huge population, a slightly higher percentage will say, yes,

[19:52] to no question. No, no, I have to do that sounds incredible. Right. We got the yes and we move on.

[19:58] Now, as a side note here, once you get the yes, shut the fuck up and go. Everything you say after the

[20:03] point, they said yes is increasing the likelihood that they changed their mind. And so as soon as you get

[20:08] the yes, it means that you've said everything is sufficient and everything after that point increases the

[20:12] risk that they reverse their answer. You got what you needed, get to the fucking truck, get your shit,

[20:15] move back there and then get it done. Now, let's go through the scenario of, I do have somebody already.

[20:22] And I was curious, if you have somebody who takes out your trash. I do. Yeah. Yeah.

[20:27] Same question. Just asking if they have the provider or not. Now, he says yes here. Do they also

[20:32] do it for free for this month? So I now have to have an alternative scenario that I can plant like an

[20:37] alternative offer also as an aside. In a live scenario, you want to sound like someone they know.

[20:43] And people they know don't say, hi, the reason that I'm calling is, if you were on a cost script,

[20:48] hey, this is Jason, pause. And they'll be like, yeah, like, hey, this is Alex, pause.

[20:57] And then they're like, where the fuck do I know Alex from? Yeah, here I ask him, like, hey, how's it going?

[21:02] I'm not saying, hey, my name's Alex, and I'm here to take a trash out and I want it like,

[21:07] breathe. Are they as awesome and smiley as me? I'm a big rapport guy. I like cracking jokes

[21:14] at all times in sales. Now, that takes a little bit more skill, but it disarms people and people

[21:17] are way less likely to be rude as somebody who's just being incredibly positive upbeat and sunny.

[21:22] And so you can be as ridiculous, say, we'll do they give you free smiles. It's such a pattern

[21:27] interrupt that people are like, what is this guy saying? They're not going to be like, fuck you.

[21:32] They're going to be like, you know what? I know, they don't give me free smiles. I'd be like,

[21:36] well, they should be because with a house like this, I mean, how much trash you must be creating a

[21:40] ton of trash. And that makes my job better. I love trash, right? Like, I could say that kind of stuff.

[21:44] They're like, oh, this guy's insane, but like, at least he's funny. And so I could literally have the

[21:48] exact same service and just because they like me better, they'll give me the business. But I pair that with

[21:53] what I say here is, are they giving it to you for free? No. No, they're not. Guess what that makes me,

[21:59] better than the guy they have right now. And so then it's like cool. He did me a favor on this is

[22:04] like, so it's just free forever. And it's like, no, it's not free forever. But I can code

[22:07] by truck come back and be like, yep, just to be clear, like, it's going to be free for this month

[22:11] to the next three pickups or four pickups are on the house. And that's just a way to earn your trust

[22:15] earn your business. And hopefully give you some free smiles on the house. And then after that, it just

[22:19] goes at 29 bucks a month. Great. You have your ID on you. Because I'd ask for that. He'd go get his wallet.

[22:24] He'd come back with his ID. So they come with their ID. You write down the information. You say,

[22:28] cool, can I change you for the card you want to use? You hold onto it until they give you the card.

[22:31] Then you swap cards. You write down the credit card information so that they don't mess up the

[22:34] number because if they write it down, they might change the numbers so that it doesn't go through.

[22:38] So you write the card information. Say, awesome. Let me get your autograph. Boom. Number three.

[22:43] The one that everyone's afraid of. I take out the Johnson's trash and they want to meet to take

[22:48] out your trash. I will tell you this. If you ever do Dordador, which is the most aggressive of the

[22:53] sales, like the hardest one to do in my opinion, you will earn respect forever from everyone.

[22:59] Everyone knows what it takes to be a Dordador salesman. It's like you have to have thick skin and

[23:03] you gotta learn how to talk to people. If you look at Jeff basis, you'll get Bill Gates, you'll

[23:07] get Mark Cupid. You look at Warren Buffett. You look at some of the most successful people in the world.

[23:11] They started in a Dordador face-to-face toe-to-to-selling environment where they got to get rejected.

[23:17] You have to learn how to sell as a base skill. It doesn't mean that you have to make money from selling,

[23:21] but you have to learn in the skill because you're going to have to sell your wife. You're going

[23:23] to have to sell your kids. You're going to have to sell your employees. You're going to have to sell

[23:26] your investors. You're going to have to sell customers. So learning how to get rejected and moving on

[23:30] with your life and realizing that nose are just coins that you tossed in the machine where you

[23:34] roll before you get your win. You can just remember that that you're putting it together,

[23:38] brick by brick, the success that you want. Bill's on nose, then you get to where you want to go faster.

[23:42] And just don't take it seriously. That guy's having a bad day. It's nothing to do with me. I'm

[23:46] just asking if you want to take a stretch out. Hey, in case this disclaimer wasn't obvious,

[23:49] this is a studio setting and we did it this way so that we could get a perfect illustrations

[23:53] of each scenario. Real life is hardly that clean. Some people answer the door with a gun.

[23:57] But this just gives you an idea of just how to literally take the first step, not going to

[24:01] the door talk to the stranger. Ask the girl out. Do the thing and not be afraid of getting

[24:05] no because no is the price of yes. So cold outreach presents three problems that we will need to

[24:11] solve together. Problem number one is that you don't have their contact information. Number two is that

[24:16] even if I did contact them, what do I say? Which comes down to a script and it offers.

[24:22] And the third thing, I've got the contacts. I know it's to say what my offer is, but I'm not

[24:26] getting enough for price. Number one, if we're trying to solve how do you contact someone,

[24:31] you have to build a list. So you build list in three ways. Number one is that you build it with

[24:34] software, just Google, software for lists, insert whatever your avatar name is for plumbers,

[24:39] for home services, for whatever, you pay monthly fee, you export a list that meets it to your criteria.

[24:44] The second way you do it is you go to brokers. brokers are people who own lists and they sell those

[24:48] list and multiple people. And so you go to Mr. Listbroker, you say, hey, this is a list of them

[24:52] looking for. How many you got? And they'll say, I've got 17,000 contacts. I mean, these criteria.

[24:56] And you say, awesome. How much? And you need to get a little negotiate and negotiate. And then

[25:00] option number three is you use the old elbow grease method, which is that you assemble the list yourself.

[25:04] Now, assembling the list yourself is in my opinion the most valuable way to do it,

[25:09] because it's going to be a virgin list. And the first few scenarios, other businesses are also

[25:13] going to that software, also going to those brokers. And so those leads might be tired of getting hit up.

[25:18] It still works. The long term in my opinion, best way to do this is to find the leads yourself.

[25:23] And you do that through looking at help, Google Maps, databases that exist online for free,

[25:28] and you basically scrape them yourself. You can also go to Facebook groups, Reddit forms,

[25:32] things like that where people are already assembled together. All of these things are ways

[25:36] that you can build lists. And the list should just have the way that you can contact them.

[25:40] The second is you're like, what do I say? Well, I have the script inside of 100 million

[25:43] all leads. You can do that. Now, the second part is BFV. It was BFV. BFV is big fast value. You'll

[25:50] notice that what I said with him was I had a free offer ready in my back pocket so I could disarm him.

[25:54] If you're talking to strangers, they're not going to be as friendly as the people who know you.

[25:58] They're not going to be as polite. And so you have to be even better with them with an amazing offer.

[26:04] I'm saying something that is superior to what other people are charging for. You'll be able to win

[26:08] more business. And it's actually one of the biggest force multipliers, especially in cold

[26:12] to get people to say yes because they don't trust you. So you have to give them a big incentive

[26:16] to do it anyways. The third is I'm not getting enough replies. And you solve that with one thing.

[26:23] Volume. Volume of reach out. Being willing to accept nose, 100 nose, 1000 nose to get to your

[26:29] yes. And we do that through automation and through collaboration. So you get other people to do

[26:34] more volume with you. And you also do technology to automate different portions of reach out.

[26:40] Because believe it or not, every part of this process of building the list, getting your

[26:45] phone system set up if you're doing cold calling. If you're setting up accounts to do cold

[26:49] DMs, all of these things are automatable to a great degree. And so get good at tech because it will

[26:55] give you huge leverage on the amount of replies that you will get back for the effort you put it.

[27:00] And so method number four is one of the biggest baddest methods because it is the fastest and

[27:05] also the most risky to do. But if you know how to do it, well, you can get bags of this.

[27:12] This is money, a bag of money. So we just knocked on doors of complete strangers to get our first

[27:17] customers doing cold outreach. And now we're transitioning to our fourth and final of the

[27:22] core four running paid ads. Are you backed up? Intrash. You smell that smell. Is that what you're

[27:30] Sunday night smells like when your trash is built up from the whole week? Does the smell of your

[27:35] trash drive you bananas? Because that time is over now. What's that? You missed your

[27:40] child's practice again? You didn't get to watch your favorite show again? The only have so many

[27:47] minutes in the day. Why would you spend it taking out your trash? I'm watching the game on my phone.

[27:54] I don't know. I never feel like that. You don't have to anymore. What's that? You love trash as

[28:02] much as I do? No, impossible. No one loves trash more than me. And so why would you rob me of the

[28:08] opportunity to clean your trash up for you? Is this you every trash day? I missed it. No.

[28:17] If this is what your Monday looks like or whatever your trash is, the day after you miss it,

[28:22] then you know exactly what I'm talking about. And so having seen how after how

[28:26] it's after half busy professionals working at home for getting to take their trash out,

[28:30] running after the truck to try and get it only to realize that they have to smell their trash

[28:34] for another week or until the next pick-up day, it's terrible. And so I decided to make a

[28:39] business just to solve that problem. And so we do three things both of everybody else. Number one

[28:43] is that we will never miss a pick-up day ever. We guarantee that because if we ever do,

[28:49] we will give you three free months if we miss even one pick-up day because we're so reliable at it.

[28:55] Number two is that we will always be on time. And so you're not like,

[28:58] when are they going to pick it up? I know it's out there so your trash is just sitting on

[29:01] front of your door for a day while you wait for us to pick it up. We say there we're going to be

[29:04] there at 7. We're going to be there at 7. And the third thing is is that you will only hear

[29:08] two statements from our team. Yes sir, no sir, yes ma'am, no ma'am. That's it. It's service with a

[29:14] smile. If that sounds as soon click the link or call 1-800-Alex trash. Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb,

[29:19] dumb, dumb. We are here running paid ads two day, the fourth of the core four. Talking to

[29:25] people who don't know you won't do many. This is how running paid ads works. There's lots of

[29:29] free value in someone's newsfeed whether it's their television that they're watching or they're

[29:33] looking at the Instagram or the TikTok. And then there's a pay-dad that goes in between the

[29:38] value that they're receiving. And then these are the strangers which you pay the platform to gain

[29:42] access to. Now when we run a paid ad there's really three parts to it. You've got the hook,

[29:46] you've got the meat of the video which is just like retained by the way if you're like hook

[29:49] retainer words like very similar. The only difference is that at the very end we're just going to

[29:53] make a call to action. Right? Whereas in a piece of content you might not do that and just have some

[29:57] sort of funny moment or something that makes it more shareable. That's the main difference between

[30:00] the two. And so the way that I've made ads is the made ads for a long time, the bulk of my material

[30:04] net worth has been made running paid advertising. So I have a decent amount of experience doing it.

[30:09] So let's watch together. Are you backed up? Intrash. Right off the bat we do have the hook which is a

[30:14] question. It's a yes-based question. Are you backed up? Now I have three visual cues here to create

[30:20] curiosity and create a call out and filtering mechanism. Man with glove. Trash slightly in the background.

[30:25] So this just looks weird. And so I'm going to get someone to maybe give me a half a second of their

[30:30] attention. If this is what your Monday looks like. So what I did, it did was present the problem.

[30:35] You'll notice that all three of these things is simply honing in on who I want to respond because

[30:40] when you're with ads, the reach is guaranteed. You're spending money to reach eyeballs. You want to

[30:44] make sure the ad communicates that this is for this specific type of person so they respond. You'll

[30:48] notice there's different ways that you can start an ad with a call out. All right? So the call out

[30:51] usually goes before the hook. The call out is you're trying to say to this specific avatar this is

[30:55] for you. You can do visual calls or you can do auditory call outs. Visual call out is something

[30:59] can see with their eyes that says this is for me. An auditory call out is me saying,

[31:04] Las Vegas homeowners. This is who I'm talking to, which is the best hook is saying this is for you.

[31:08] And then you put your real hook, which is the question or the lead to the ad. For getting to take

[31:13] their trash out, running after the truck to try and get it, these are all just pain points. People who

[31:17] are busy at work, they don't have time, they're coming back home, they're forgetting their trash

[31:20] day. Only to realize that they have to smell their trash for another week or until the next pick

[31:24] up day. Pain, they have to smell their trash because they forgot about it and it's sitting there.

[31:27] The whole point here is we're ad shading the pain, we're bringing up like, oh yeah, this is important.

[31:31] I really do need to fix this. This is something that I hate having to do with. And so we do three

[31:34] things, but then everybody else. So notice I'm then introducing three things. All right, so when I was

[31:39] selling fitness programs, I saw a fitness nutrition accountability. Trying to come up with three things

[31:44] for whatever the core service helps people know that you're about to tell them what it is to

[31:49] that opens the loop so they're more likely to listen. And then it just gives them a way to organize

[31:52] the information so they can know the benefits. And I've just found three works for it. Number one is that

[31:57] we will never miss a pickup day ever. And so I present the probably the biggest pain point that

[32:02] they have because that's what I introged the clip with. I put my guarantee right in the middle.

[32:05] Sometimes you can put the guarantee at the end, sometimes you put the guarantee at the end,

[32:06] sometimes you put the guarantee at the beginning. So you can move the guarantee around. It felt like

[32:09] it matched most with this pain point and saying not only that, just to go above and beyond,

[32:13] I'm going to deliver this really fast value crazy amazing offer. So if we miss one day, we're going to be

[32:18] three months for it. Now all you got to do is make sure that you don't do that and if you have a business

[32:21] then why would you miss it? But it sounds insane. Number two is that we will always be on time.

[32:26] All right so the other issue is like what other pain points are there. So well, even if you know

[32:30] that what day to someone's coming there, do you want to have trash pot up in front of your house?

[32:33] It's another pain point. So the deeper you know your avatar and the deeper you know the pain points

[32:37] that they're experiencing around one of the problems, the more detailed you can be in description of

[32:41] the pain. And so copy and advertising is about the details, the smell of the trash, the chasing

[32:46] after it, the having it pile up in front of your house. The smell when neighbors come in, not just like

[32:51] you smelling it but like have you read somebody else come in because then affect status. So there's

[32:55] different ways that you can attack the same problem. The first one I say might not be the one that they

[32:59] feel like they suffer from. So I want to say multiple things so that one of them hits a pain point

[33:03] and they're like wow, this does affect me. And the third thing is is that you won't only hear

[33:07] two statements from our team. Yes sir, yes ma'am was the next pain point. Is they probably have

[33:13] a lot of low skilled laborers who pick up trash, who are not that friendly and don't have a lot of

[33:17] report. And so for me to just elevate our service to everybody else to say yes sir, no sir, yes ma'am,

[33:23] no ma'am because in today's day and age, no entry to anyone with respect. And so my company would be

[33:27] about that because respect would be a pain point for these types of individuals. And now we transition

[33:32] to CTA which is called action so that we actually get them to do something from this app. If that's

[33:36] sounding as you click the link or call 1-800-Alex trash. And that is one example of yeah, you can have

[33:43] one or two or three kind of meaty portions of it where you hit on the pain a couple of different ways,

[33:48] maybe talk about the benefits of a couple of different ways, but you can have way more hooks because

[33:53] the hook is going to be the most important part of this ad because 80% of people are going to decide

[33:58] not to watch your ad in the first three seconds. So that's the part you test the most. If you can get

[34:02] them to buy the ad in the first three seconds, you have bought yourself more time to consume the

[34:07] rest of it. Is this you every trash day? So it's a yes-based question in front of two visual call outs

[34:13] that look like somebody who is a homeowner who is trash. That would be the hook.

[34:19] You smell that smell. Is that what you're Sunday night smells like? Yes-based question with a very

[34:24] weird intro that might catch people's attention. Does the smell of your trash drive you bananas?

[34:30] So that is a yes-based question with humor. And like if I wanted to do track doctors,

[34:34] I wouldn't dress this way and I wouldn't be in this setting. So the setting and the avatar of the

[34:38] person in the ad will do more to attract the right types of people than anything else. If you want to

[34:44] track more women, put women in the ads. And if you're like men, I'm a guy and surprisingly,

[34:49] all of my clients are men. It's probably because you're in the ads. So if you want to have twice the

[34:54] reach have two or three or four different people in the ads that you have. It's one of the easiest ways

[34:59] to double or triple your business or lead club. What's that? You missed your trial practice again.

[35:04] Didn't get to watch your favorite show again. All right. So here's two yes-based questions that

[35:08] it. Those are both pain yes-based questions that they say. Yes, I have been missing these things

[35:12] that I connect that to trash. I'm bridging it to the trash problem. It's really a problem not

[35:16] having time. I'm just choosing to put that towards trash. What's that? You love trash as much as I do.

[35:21] So just like that, we've got a hook and a lot of there's visual action at the beginning of this to

[35:25] break the attention of the normal new speed that's what might be expensive or the TV that they're

[35:30] watching. I'm watching the game on my phone. So that is a relatable moment that every man has had when

[35:37] they get asked to take out the trash. You're just doing something else that you'd rather do besides

[35:42] take the trash out. And so each of these hooks can lead right into that original first video I sent.

[35:47] You just cut off the first five seconds and then you use this and then it clips right to

[35:50] there's three things that we do better than everybody else and then we go right into it.

[35:54] And that's how you make paid ads. And that gives us the fourth way that you can get customers in the

[35:59] core for for trash business or any other business you want to start. And we put them all together.

[36:05] It looks like this.

[36:18] Ah! So it'll be a montage of you throwing trash bags over your shoulder, dumping it into the

[36:26] big old receptacle. You're going to be spraying the money gun everywhere because you've turned

[36:30] so much trash into cash. We'll edit this down for YouTube. We'll make it for the podcast.

[36:35] We'll post on TikTok, shorts, everything. What do you think?

[36:41] I think that idea is garbage.

## Full Transcript
[00:00] For the past five years, I've kept a documented email chain

[00:03] that I've called lessons and failures.

[00:06] And in that chain, whenever I have a lesson

[00:09] that I feel like I've learned, I would email it to myself

[00:13] with the circumstances and the lessons I could document it.

[00:17] And I've been doing that for five years.

[00:18] This may be the last year that I do that

[00:20] because I've kind of transitioned to documenting my thoughts

[00:23] on Twitter rather than email chain to myself.

[00:26] And so that's actually grown a lot

[00:28] because they were public rather than private

[00:29] and then consolidated.

[00:30] But this video is far overdue

[00:33] because it is from the lessons and failures of 2021.

[00:36] And you know, currently this lessons and failures videos

[00:39] tend to be like buying up a one video for the year.

[00:41] And so I hope you enjoy it.

[00:43] I'm going to be covering a vast, you know,

[00:46] big, big swath of topics during this video.

[00:49] And just to give you a little bit of context,

[00:51] my name's Oxford Mozi, I ownacquisitorcom.

[00:54] It's a portfolio of companies at this point

[00:55] over $100 million a year.

[00:56] I make these videos because I'll be dead one day

[00:58] and this all be this left.

[01:00] And so just a couple of major bullets from 2021,

[01:03] I sold the majority stake of Allen,

[01:05] which is a software company that we owned 100% off.

[01:07] It had done 12 million in trailing 12 months revenue.

[01:09] We sold it to strategic buyer.

[01:11] The terms and price of the deal,

[01:12] I signed a nine disclosure for it.

[01:14] So I cannot share that part.

[01:15] But we did 12 million leading into the sale.

[01:17] We sold two thirds of Jim Lunch and Pristise Labs,

[01:21] which was a company that we founded my wife and I

[01:23] to American Pacific Group at a $46.2 million valuation.

[01:27] It was an all cash deal for us.

[01:28] There was no burnout, there was no seller financing,

[01:29] there was no transition period.

[01:31] Those were the terms of that deal.

[01:32] So I was able to do that and I negotiated it in.

[01:34] So I could tell you guys on this lovely YouTube video.

[01:37] In addition to that,

[01:38] wrote and published $100 million offers,

[01:39] which to date is still the number one best seller

[01:41] for advertising for now eight straight months,

[01:43] at least the time of this video.

[01:45] It has nearly 5,000, 5 stars on Amazon,

[01:47] and a five star 4.9 ranking on there,

[01:50] which I'm very grateful for.

[01:51] So thank you guys, part of Mose Nation for sharing the word.

[01:54] I hope to continue to write more of these books.

[01:57] I have a lot of outlines.

[01:58] It's just very hard to make them exceptional

[01:59] and that's why they take so long.

[02:01] That being said, in the same 2021,

[02:03] we grew TikTok, Instagram, YouTube,

[02:06] all to over 100,000 in the subscribers followers,

[02:09] that are in a year and grew Twitter to 20,000 in 90 days,

[02:13] all of which without really any knowledge of these platforms.

[02:15] So I'll share some of the things that worked for us

[02:18] if that is of interest to you guys.

[02:20] Despite the sale, not including the sale money

[02:22] that we have from all three of those exits that I discussed,

[02:25] we still did seven and $8 million of EBITDA

[02:27] are like personal earnings outside of the sale

[02:29] from real estate things like that.

[02:31] And just from dividends from other companies we own,

[02:33] I sold our Bentley.

[02:35] That was the only nice car that we owned.

[02:37] We had an I.E. but it was a gift.

[02:39] We still have that, we'll probably end up selling it

[02:40] because it's just not that practical.

[02:42] And beyond that, I also sold my home.

[02:45] And so at this point,

[02:46] I own no personal assets and I'm leasing my life.

[02:49] And so that's kind of what happened last year.

[02:52] So let's get to the lessons,

[02:53] because we're like Alex, I don't really give shit

[02:54] about your accomplishments.

[02:56] And I tend to agree with you.

[02:57] We'll dive in together to some of the major topics.

[03:00] I'm gonna start with some heavy hitters

[03:01] and then we're gonna get into the more tactical stuff.

[03:03] One of the heavy hitters here is,

[03:04] if we think about, you know, Betty White,

[03:07] if you're at a Betty White,

[03:08] she was one of the Golden Gals,

[03:10] super successful actress, she just died

[03:12] before 100th birthday, very sad.

[03:14] And what's interesting is that she was kind of a meme

[03:16] all over the place that how she just missed it

[03:18] by like 14 days.

[03:19] But what's interesting is that you probably

[03:21] haven't thought about Betty White since then.

[03:22] Or you might not even hurt her.

[03:24] What's interesting to me about that is that Betty White

[03:26] achieved pretty much all levels of success.

[03:28] She was a really nice person.

[03:29] She was a huge human rights advocate.

[03:31] She donated tons of money.

[03:32] She was famous.

[03:34] She had like, she did everything, right?

[03:35] And yet you probably haven't thought about her

[03:38] except for me making this video, right?

[03:41] And I think in a lot of ways that's how our lives will be.

[03:43] And it gives me a lot of perspective

[03:45] in the things that we find important

[03:46] and how much we value the opinions of others

[03:49] when most of them won't even remember after we die,

[03:51] like even a few weeks later, they'll just continue

[03:54] to live their lives.

[03:55] And so if people don't even care for more

[03:57] than a few weeks that we died, why do we

[03:59] subscribe so much value to how they want us to live?

[04:02] And so that has been kind of one of the guiding principles

[04:05] that I've tried to think through with high

[04:07] live for my life and kind of this next chapter.

[04:09] And it's been a great lens for realizing

[04:12] that most things just don't matter.

[04:14] And that most of the meaning, at least for me,

[04:16] comes from the things that I choose to do

[04:17] meaningful rather than a capital and meaning

[04:19] that has been prescribed for everyone else.

[04:21] And I'll share with you a quote that was very meaningful

[04:23] to me, because again, this was just a long email chain

[04:25] that I've sent to myself.

[04:27] But Albert Kimu was a French moron

[04:29] as a Moroccan philosopher.

[04:30] And he said, the meaning of life is why you don't kill yourself.

[04:34] And that will probably trigger a lot of people.

[04:36] And that's not my intention.

[04:38] But when I heard it so succinctly stated,

[04:41] I thought about it.

[04:41] I was like, that might be one of the best

[04:42] best conditions I've heard.

[04:44] The reason you don't kill yourself, right now,

[04:45] you have a reason.

[04:46] Why don't you do it?

[04:47] What is the deep core reason for why you don't kill yourself?

[04:50] That reason is your actual meaning.

[04:52] That is the thing that prevents you from killing yourself.

[04:54] And so that is the meaning for you.

[04:57] And I thought that was really fascinating.

[04:59] Now obviously for people who follow a certain

[05:01] or specific faith, that is going to be maybe the reason.

[05:03] And if it's not the reason, then that might not be

[05:05] your deepest hope belief, kind of interesting thought.

[05:07] But for me, that was very interesting.

[05:09] And I'll share with you what the reason I don't,

[05:11] which is I just love learning.

[05:13] And I just, there's so much more to learn.

[05:15] And that's really it.

[05:16] I just love learning.

[05:17] And I want to continue to learn because I enjoy it so much.

[05:19] And I would be really bummed if I died

[05:21] because I wouldn't be able to learn all the stuff

[05:22] that I want to learn.

[05:23] And then, dispeling the legacy myth,

[05:26] kind of once and for all.

[05:27] My great, great grandfather was a king or something

[05:32] in Iran.

[05:33] And maybe this is folklore, but doesn't really matter

[05:35] because the point of the message is the same.

[05:38] I don't actually remember his name.

[05:40] I think it was almost Han, but it doesn't matter.

[05:42] The point is, I don't remember his name.

[05:43] And he was like royalty.

[05:45] And he had 400 kids.

[05:46] And he was a ruler.

[05:48] And so think about that from a achievement perspective.

[05:50] He like ruled a country.

[05:52] So wealth, kids, fame, all of those things.

[05:56] And here I am, only like five generations later.

[05:59] And I can barely tell you his name.

[06:00] I don't even know what he looked like.

[06:02] And so I mean, he influenced my life

[06:04] and basically no way besides the fact

[06:05] that he was pro-generated from him.

[06:07] And so we have these ideas of legacy.

[06:10] And they are not real because if you just take out

[06:14] the time horizon for any reasonable period of time,

[06:16] a thousand years, 10,000 years, we will be forgotten.

[06:19] There is no legacy.

[06:20] And so the idea of like, I want to build a legacy.

[06:23] Is silly, unless you want to say that it's just,

[06:25] well, I'm going to leave an impact on people

[06:26] and those people, even impact on people.

[06:28] Then cool, then you just want to help humans.

[06:29] And that's fine.

[06:30] But the whole concept of being a legacy,

[06:32] legacy though, is kind of superfluous.

[06:34] It's kind of a relevant.

[06:34] It's just living your life according to your values,

[06:36] which is great.

[06:37] But I wouldn't necessarily call that a legacy.

[06:38] I have taken this dance that it's very much a myth

[06:41] and that us accumulating assets is very much like a casino

[06:45] analogy that a lot of you guys have loved from imagination,

[06:47] which is if you imagine life as a casino,

[06:50] whereas we come in or come of age, we get a chip,

[06:52] and we get seated at a poker table.

[06:54] And we're dealt cards, right?

[06:56] And based on our skill, we're able to continually

[06:58] hopefully amass chips over time and continue to play.

[07:01] And the difference between a casino in the real world

[07:04] and the casino of life is in the real world,

[07:06] you can cash out your chips and walk away with more money.

[07:08] But in the casino of life,

[07:09] when the green river taps you on the shoulder,

[07:11] and it says you're time to go,

[07:12] you get up from the table, your chip's still on the table,

[07:15] and everyone pushes it back to the middle,

[07:16] and then everyone redistributes those things.

[07:18] The lands you own, the baskets you own, et cetera,

[07:20] that was just get redistributed, new people,

[07:22] own them right after you.

[07:23] And I remember thinking about this one,

[07:25] I had bought a piece of land,

[07:26] and I was like, this is cool, I own this land.

[07:27] And then I realized that that land

[07:29] had been bought from another guy,

[07:30] I had been bought from another guy,

[07:31] I had been bought from another guy,

[07:32] everyone person before me, but like this is mine.

[07:34] But not really, we just kind of lease it while we're alive.

[07:36] And then we die and then we give it back,

[07:37] and then someone else takes it, right?

[07:38] And so, death tax is everyone 100%.

[07:41] And so that thought process for me has led to,

[07:43] you know, the decision that Lail and I had,

[07:44] which was to give a werewolf, when we die no matter what,

[07:46] because we don't think it's good for anybody

[07:48] to inherit tremendous wealth,

[07:50] because we think it ruins the person.

[07:52] And if we're gonna give it back to humanity anyways,

[07:54] then as well just be more targeted in how we give it, right?

[07:57] And so that has been a lot of the thought process

[07:59] around like, why do we choose to do what we do?

[08:00] Because it's one of the questions

[08:01] that you don't interview a lot,

[08:02] which is like, why are you still motivated to do it?

[08:04] And it's like, well, what else would I do?

[08:05] I'm not gonna just sit and drink peony clouds all day,

[08:07] that would be terrible.

[08:08] And the process of success for me is the process of becoming.

[08:10] The becoming is the success.

[08:13] And so hard work is the goal.

[08:14] That is the goal, hard work that we find meaningful.

[08:17] And that is, for me learning is meaningful

[08:20] and I learned by doing.

[08:21] So that being said, 2020 alone was also difficult for me

[08:23] because it was a year that I basically took off.

[08:25] I did not work much at all.

[08:27] And that was mostly to kind of have the full experience.

[08:29] You know, I don't wanna say,

[08:30] I don't wanna poo, not working without having not worked.

[08:32] And after not working for almost an entire year,

[08:35] I can tell you, for me, no, bueno,

[08:37] I was very sad for me, I was very depressing for me.

[08:39] I did not enjoy it, I did not get any meaningful.

[08:42] It was just not good, it was very empty.

[08:44] And so I'll give you a couple of the quick conclusions

[08:46] that I had from that whole year.

[08:48] The first thing is that for me, price of things

[08:51] no longer can first value, which is actually kind of interesting

[08:54] because when you think about it in the beginning,

[08:56] you can go out to an right restaurant

[08:57] and it's really fancy because it's a nice restaurant.

[08:59] And so the fact that you're sacrificing so much

[09:00] to go out makes you enjoy it more.

[09:02] If you save up to buy a purse, if you're a girl,

[09:04] then the purse is more meaningful to you.

[09:06] But if you can buy a purse off of one minute's worth of income,

[09:09] then a really nice purse, or the most expensive purse,

[09:11] or one minute's worth of income,

[09:13] then the person no longer has that conferred value

[09:15] from the price.

[09:16] And so what's interesting about that though

[09:17] is that it allows, I feel like, me now,

[09:19] to look at things without price altogether

[09:22] because if all things cost essentially zero,

[09:24] then you get to just purely look at things from what they are,

[09:26] which is you take out the marketing,

[09:27] you take out the psychology and it's like,

[09:28] do I like this thing?

[09:29] Does it serve me?

[09:30] Does it have function?

[09:31] And so that has been kind of my occupier's razor

[09:33] for how I deem things more valuable to me?

[09:35] So I realize that I prefer just simple cotton tanks

[09:39] because they are just easier for me

[09:41] and I like them.

[09:41] I don't need more expensive tanks

[09:43] because I don't like them.

[09:44] I like these ones, right?

[09:45] And if there's something that happens to be more expensive

[09:47] and I like it the best, then I will get that.

[09:48] But price no longer conferred value

[09:50] if you don't feel like the price gives you status

[09:53] because you don't get your status from the expensiveness

[09:56] of the thing or the cost of the things that you wear.

[09:58] Kind of interesting.

[09:58] Next was, I had the realization

[10:00] that I had no way to actually spend the amount of money

[10:02] that we have accumulated over our lives

[10:03] that we continue to accumulate.

[10:05] There's no real way to spend it,

[10:06] like as in consummate.

[10:08] Like you can spend it to buy assets for sure.

[10:10] But then those assets just make you more money.

[10:11] And so buying things for the sake of consuming them,

[10:15] there is a very easy limit that you reach

[10:17] where you don't really get any more benefit.

[10:20] And so realizing that there's a diminishing marginal return

[10:22] with money was like an interesting conclusion

[10:24] to like realize myself.

[10:26] And I think what's interesting is that having more

[10:28] allows you to realize that you were just as happy

[10:31] when you had less.

[10:32] And maybe you have to do that on your own

[10:33] and get there to let me prove it to myself

[10:35] as Lysbrand says.

[10:36] But to me it was just a very interesting realization.

[10:40] The next one was as a result of this dealing with

[10:42] taxing inagants as I like to say,

[10:45] almost went down this behalf of the building,

[10:47] like these cascading trusts to decrease tax drag

[10:51] on the exits that we had.

[10:52] And I think it would probably

[10:53] would have saved me somewhere in the neighborhood

[10:54] about $6 million.

[10:55] It was like I just don't care enough.

[10:57] I'll just pay my taxes and I already have more

[10:59] than I can spend or eat and move on.

[11:03] And at the end of the day, like for me,

[11:05] I realized that the wealth is built through the owning

[11:08] and not the selling.

[11:09] And so the goal is to just transact

[11:10] as little as possible and just continue

[11:12] to build value in the things that you do on.

[11:13] Because most things over a very long period of time

[11:15] just go up a lot.

[11:16] And so it's all about patience.

[11:18] And I like this is a quote that you can share.

[11:20] But I like setting up games where if I wait, I win.

[11:23] And so those tend to be the games that I know

[11:26] more drawn to words where I was, I feel like when I was younger,

[11:28] it was more like if I can't win fast, that I'm gonna play.

[11:30] But now it's like I would love to have the games

[11:32] where you cannot win unless you wait

[11:34] because I know so few people will play.

[11:36] And typically, even words are outsized.

[11:38] Next one was just really thinking about ownership

[11:41] in general for personal belongings.

[11:43] I have still dedicated, you know,

[11:45] a lay line I know we own nothing.

[11:47] We lease our lifestyle.

[11:48] And I would say that it has been very freeing.

[11:50] And we thought about buying a house again

[11:52] and we actually ended up deciding not to do that.

[11:54] And so we are just leasing our lifestyle.

[11:56] And it is very freeing.

[11:57] I will say that.

[11:58] One of the things that I also have started asking myself

[12:00] as a question for framing what someone else who's ahead of me

[12:04] is doing and this might be useful for you

[12:06] is a lot of times I originally would look at,

[12:08] what is this person doing that I'm not doing?

[12:10] And so it comes from the assumption

[12:12] that I need to do more, right?

[12:14] Whereas if we come from the opposite perspective

[12:16] of what is this person lack that I have?

[12:19] What is this person not doing that I am doing?

[12:21] I think a lot of times there's more answers

[12:23] to that question that are more meaningful

[12:25] than trying to do more because at a certain point

[12:27] you max out your ability to do.

[12:28] And if you were doing all day long, right?

[12:31] And you're not getting to where you want to go,

[12:33] then what you were doing is the wrong stuff to do.

[12:35] And so it's not about doing more

[12:36] because what you're doing is already maxed out.

[12:38] It's about doing less and about doing different.

[12:42] And so in order to do different, if you are maxed out,

[12:43] you must do fewer of the things you were currently doing.

[12:45] And so it is a really good limit to us for me

[12:47] to think through what are the character traits

[12:49] that someone might lack that I have,

[12:50] what are the activities that they are doing

[12:52] that I am doing so that I can look through

[12:55] different lens through it to improve myself.

[12:58] And then the final one on living stuff.

[13:00] And this may have seemed a little bit more head

[13:02] even to some of my past lessons and failures,

[13:04] but I think part of that was just because with the sale

[13:07] of all three businesses and the dividends and everything

[13:09] like we crossed the 9th figuring out worth

[13:11] at Laylist 29, I'm 32.

[13:13] And so we have a lot of summers left, hopefully.

[13:15] And so it gives you a little bit of perspective on like,

[13:18] so what I want to dedicate the rest of my life to.

[13:20] And so the last framework that I'll leave you

[13:22] within the kind of the woo woo,

[13:24] niss of this video is the 85-year-old decision framework,

[13:27] which is instead of talking to an 85-year-old,

[13:30] which is a great thing to do, by the way,

[13:31] if I imagine myself as an 85-year-old version of me,

[13:34] and I ask that man for advice on what I should do in situations,

[13:38] A, he's an asshole, always making fun of me.

[13:41] But beyond that, I get really, really clear answers

[13:44] from someone who wants truly just my best.

[13:47] And I've found this to be a repeated theme

[13:49] throughout my life is that a lot of times I know what I need to do,

[13:52] and I'm just not doing it.

[13:53] That may be true for you too, is that a lot of times,

[13:55] we don't have as much ignorance as we think we do.

[13:57] We just have a lot more fear to take that action.

[13:59] And so when I talk to my 85-year-old self,

[14:01] I get a lot of clarity in terms of what decision

[14:04] should I should make and more realistically,

[14:06] how few of them really matter.

[14:07] Because when I think about my 85-year-old self,

[14:09] all the ins of telling me to do is enjoy it.

[14:11] Like, you're gonna die and definitely no sacrifice anything for me.

[14:14] Like, I would give everything I have to be 32 again.

[14:17] 85-year-old self would give everything he has,

[14:19] all the billions of dollars just to be 32 again.

[14:21] And I have that gift right now, and it's kind of interesting.

[14:24] And so too, many of you probably, you know,

[14:26] if you give up everything you have to get 10 years

[14:30] to go back in time, 10 years, would you do it?

[14:32] And it's not to relive life from a regret standpoint,

[14:34] but just to have 10 more years, right, of youth.

[14:37] I think a lot of people would do that,

[14:38] which then gives you a really interesting perspective

[14:40] on the value of money and how we trade it for time and living.

[14:43] That was one of the frameworks that I've been really thinking a lot

[14:45] about when it comes to my life.

[14:47] The next one is about solving problems,

[14:50] which is a lot of you guys know that I'm a huge fan

[14:53] of Charlie Mongers, and one of the processes

[14:55] that he champions is inverted thinking,

[14:56] which is or inverted problem solving,

[14:58] which is rather than asking,

[15:00] how do I want to solve this problem?

[15:02] I try and destroy the solution.

[15:05] So, for example, if I wanted to destroy my marriage,

[15:07] what would I do, right?

[15:08] I would probably not be loyal, right?

[15:10] I would probably never compliment my life.

[15:12] And I could, you know, the list would go on, right?

[15:14] And what's interesting about the inverted thinking process

[15:16] is that you think of far more ways

[15:18] that are threats to a certain condition

[15:20] than you do solutions naturally.

[15:22] And I think it's because our brains are wired

[15:23] to think of threats, right?

[15:24] We're trying to survive, not thrive.

[15:26] But you can use and trick your brain into thinking

[15:28] of all of the threats that could possibly come up

[15:30] within a given situation, and then all you do is reverse them, right?

[15:33] And so if you think, how could I destroy my business,

[15:36] you know, as easily as quickly as possible, what I do?

[15:39] And you tell yourself what those things would be, right?

[15:41] And then all you have to do is reverse those,

[15:42] and those become your strategic anchors.

[15:44] Those becomes the biggest priorities in the business

[15:46] that you need to do more.

[15:47] And so it's a really wonderful process

[15:48] that has taken me time to just immediately go to that.

[15:52] You know, first I had to think about it deliberately,

[15:53] and then I saw the utility in using that framework.

[15:55] And now I use it quickly, you know,

[15:57] it's more top of mind for me now

[15:58] that I solve more problems through inverted thinking,

[16:00] but it takes time to get there.

[16:02] And so that has been probably something

[16:04] that I've worked a lot on in 2021 that I hope serves you.

[16:07] But you can really solve so many questions.

[16:09] You know, like, if I wanted to make it off,

[16:10] or what if I wanted to get something that no one would say

[16:12] has to owe it to me, and then you put all the things down,

[16:14] and you'd quite do the opposite of that, right?

[16:16] If I wanted to sell this personal, what would I do?

[16:18] Great, well, to guarantee that they would never buy what I do, right?

[16:21] And so you reverse it, and then that gives you

[16:23] what you need to do to sell.

[16:24] And so you can solve so many problems that way,

[16:25] but I think it just triggers it in part of your brain

[16:27] and you solve problems differently.

[16:28] A few major lessons.

[16:30] One is finding things.

[16:31] So we're going to go from clouds all the way to dirt, okay?

[16:34] So business business.

[16:35] If you can find people the money to pay,

[16:38] they will find a way to make it work.

[16:40] And so I think that financing is something

[16:41] that is underrated.

[16:42] I think the entire education industry at large exists

[16:45] because government gives basically free money,

[16:48] to anyone who wants to get educated,

[16:49] through student debt and student loans.

[16:51] And so that whole industry probably would not exist

[16:54] if that student loan thing didn't happen.

[16:56] And so if you can find yourself in industries

[16:59] where there is easier lending,

[17:00] you will sell more people at higher prices,

[17:02] just interesting lesson that was a great reminder for me.

[17:05] Number two, whenever possible,

[17:06] especially within services,

[17:08] sell to goal rather than selling programs.

[17:10] And the reason for that is because people want to buy the outcome.

[17:13] They don't want to buy your program.

[17:14] So if someone wants to buy, you know,

[17:16] they don't want to buy your gym membership.

[17:17] They want to buy a body.

[17:18] They want to buy what their body's going to look like.

[17:20] And so sell that.

[17:21] It's a very interesting nuance,

[17:23] but it's really important when you're trying to persuade

[17:25] someone to take action and it creates a clear line

[17:28] between their purchase and their desired end state.

[17:30] And so rather than sell, like I said,

[17:32] a 12 week whatever, sell the goal.

[17:35] And so I think if you can make that shift

[17:36] in your products and services,

[17:37] you ultimately sell more people

[17:38] and have happier customers.

[17:40] Moving on, I read 70 books last year.

[17:42] I barely read most of them.

[17:44] I skimmed with the majority.

[17:45] And that was mostly because most of them

[17:46] were just not that interesting or that good.

[17:48] The books that I read intentionally last year,

[17:50] so I would skim, thought they had good stuff,

[17:52] and then reread, ready fire aim,

[17:54] which I've talked about, which is Masterson.

[17:57] Steven Schwartzman's what it takes, really good book.

[18:00] Couches capitalism.

[18:01] I read the first half, but it was really good.

[18:03] And it really shifted how I saw business

[18:04] and what we want to do with that,

[18:05] was there's not common terms of giving back

[18:07] and helping all stakeholders.

[18:08] Because I'll go on the tangent

[18:10] that this book led me to, which is the realization

[18:12] that charity as a whole is a very broken model.

[18:15] And so it's my belief, and this is what my,

[18:17] you know what I hope to accomplish with acquisition is that

[18:21] if we can create an entity that is self-sustaining

[18:23] and self-growing and continually gives a percentage

[18:28] of its earnings, then we will have created a charity

[18:31] that grows and fuels itself rather than

[18:34] creating a charity that solicits money.

[18:35] Because the exchange, it's not there.

[18:37] It's always banking on a goodwill rather than a value

[18:39] who's changed from selfish people.

[18:41] And so I think it's much easier to focus on people's

[18:44] as a large selfishness, and then only have to get one person

[18:47] to be more giving, right, which you could make the argument

[18:50] that we're being selfish by giving, but whatever.

[18:52] If you only have to convince yourself to be giving,

[18:54] and then convince everyone else to be selfish,

[18:56] it's much easier to do that over a longer period of time

[18:58] than convince everyone else to give, right?

[19:01] That is kind of the perspective that has changed for me

[19:03] with regards to charity and giving overall.

[19:05] And so, Lailin, I have given millions now to charity.

[19:10] And I feel like now that we've been involved,

[19:13] there are things that I would want to improve.

[19:15] And the only solution that I could think of

[19:17] was creating a true for-profit type business

[19:20] that would attract the best talent who could grow the thing.

[19:23] And then dedicate a specific percentage of the profit

[19:25] every year no matter what, that would go to the causes, right?

[19:29] And then that way, as the company grew,

[19:31] so too, with the giving, right, rather than always soliciting.

[19:34] So that's one of the things that the catch-to-catches

[19:36] capitals gave to me.

[19:38] I read everything that Warren Buffett and Charlie Moograver

[19:41] had written over that last year.

[19:42] So there's the shareholder letters that,

[19:46] Buffett has written, there's Charlie Moogra's All-Mannac.

[19:49] And there's just basically anything that they've written,

[19:51] the transcriptions from all of Moogra's speeches,

[19:53] very, very, very, very good, very impactful for me.

[19:55] And the All-Mannac of Naval Robocon,

[19:57] that was a good book, very easy read, like two hours,

[20:00] very, very easy read.

[20:01] I think I read it again, like literally right afterwards.

[20:04] Very good book, very, very good.

[20:06] All right, so I have to say about that, very, very good book.

[20:07] Now let's get even more tactical, social media.

[20:10] So some of the things that worked for growing

[20:13] these social media is for us.

[20:15] Number one is only talk about stuff that you know,

[20:17] or that you have experienced or that real for you.

[20:20] I think one of the things that I see at least

[20:21] turns me off when I see other people's stuff

[20:23] is I see people clearly,

[20:24] we're encouraging other people's content.

[20:26] And it's like this has already been said,

[20:28] and you're not adding to the body of knowledge.

[20:29] You're just, you know, deluding down your version of it

[20:33] and it's just not that useful, right?

[20:34] It's not a value additive.

[20:36] And so it either has to be true

[20:37] because you've done it or it is true to you.

[20:39] And I think that is a very good.

[20:40] So like if you're starting out,

[20:41] what's true to you is that you're trying.

[20:43] And so that would be true.

[20:44] And you're experiencing that you're going through our true.

[20:46] And so that is kind of in accordance

[20:47] with the whole document, don't create concept from Gary V,

[20:50] which is very difficult to operationalize.

[20:51] But at least just capturing the things that you're going through.

[20:54] No one can, no one can claim that you are speaking false truths.

[20:59] Like, no one can negate your truth of what you just did.

[21:03] Right?

[21:04] If you did this thing or you helped this client,

[21:06] that is true.

[21:07] There's no way that anyone can say that you didn't do that.

[21:10] And so you can give your unique perspective,

[21:12] which is adding to the body of knowledge

[21:14] rather than regurgitating stuff that you read in a book.

[21:18] Which goes down to, if someone has already made it,

[21:20] don't remake it.

[21:21] Next one is, I realized for me,

[21:24] I don't want to have a schedule.

[21:25] So what I mean by that is like,

[21:26] I don't want to have a schedule for posting stuff.

[21:29] I'm not a social media creator.

[21:31] I am a business guy.

[21:32] You know what I mean?

[21:33] Like we take investments in e-learning

[21:35] and really internet businesses is what we focus on.

[21:38] So that's where I make my money.

[21:41] The schedule felt very constraining to me

[21:42] and when I didn't have the schedule ended,

[21:44] I'm making more.

[21:44] And so that was something that I figured out for me

[21:46] was useful.

[21:47] The next one was like, why do you make stuff?

[21:49] And I think I alluded to the beginning of this video,

[21:50] but like making stuff,

[21:52] there's obviously making stuff for the audience.

[21:54] But I think for me it's making it for me.

[21:56] I'm making it to documents

[21:57] that when I look back and I'm old and gray and baggy

[22:00] and saggy.

[22:01] I can be like, oh yeah.

[22:02] That's what I used to think about when I was at that point.

[22:04] And it gave, it'll help me document my

[22:06] what I'm thinking about at that time.

[22:07] And hopefully maybe for you

[22:08] if you can shift that frame,

[22:09] I think would be helpful.

[22:10] And I heard this from Grant that I really liked.

[22:12] He said, assume no one will ever see it.

[22:14] And make it anyways.

[22:15] And so when he said that,

[22:16] I thought that was like,

[22:17] it corroborated the conclusion that I had gone to.

[22:19] All right, come to it.

[22:20] Next one was, you want to be platform specific for formatting.

[22:23] That's something that we, you know,

[22:24] we found out like, you just,

[22:26] you gotta be platform specific.

[22:27] And so either learn the platform by using it

[22:30] or find someone who does that was very helpful

[22:32] for us.

[22:33] The next one is that people feel intention more

[22:35] than anything else.

[22:35] And I think that was a big lesson for me

[22:36] because like, I don't sell anything.

[22:38] I have a book that's 99 cents that you can get on Amazon

[22:40] because the cheapest, the only listed four is 99 cents

[22:42] and the audible they don't even let you list your own prices.

[22:45] They list the prices.

[22:46] People feel intention, right?

[22:48] And so I think that people are always waiting

[22:49] for the other shooter job,

[22:50] at least for me and my channel.

[22:51] Like, when is he gonna picture something?

[22:52] Nothing is right, right?

[22:53] Like, let's share a company in which case I'm buying

[22:55] not selling, right?

[22:56] And so the point here is,

[22:58] if you're coming at it from the right place,

[22:59] like people are exceptionally good at sniffing out

[23:01] of why people want something, right?

[23:03] Like we're very good at not being deceived.

[23:05] Like it's very good from an evolutionary standpoint

[23:07] to not get double crossed, right?

[23:08] And so I think we have very good intuition to who is lying, right?

[23:12] And so the easiest way to get people to believe you

[23:15] is to tell the truth.

[23:16] And if you do want to sell people stuff,

[23:18] just tell them you're trying to sell them shit, right?

[23:19] Like in the companies when I was like,

[23:21] when we were selling stuff, I was like,

[23:22] I'm here to sell you shit.

[23:23] I want to make money.

[23:24] That's why I'm here.

[23:24] And I do longterm want to make money

[23:26] from all the investments that we make,

[23:27] which these videos do help with that,

[23:29] to attract internet businesses.

[23:30] But a lot of my intended is the fact

[23:32] that I know that I'm going to die

[23:33] and it's not going to matter anyways.

[23:34] And like this is fun for me.

[23:36] Tone, like in selling matters more than words.

[23:39] And that was something that I got to see firsthand.

[23:42] I saw someone deliver a pitch that was really bad.

[23:44] Someone else basically went up and said the same thing

[23:46] with the right tone.

[23:47] And that was where the intention came in and it crushed.

[23:49] And I think that seeing that juxtaposition

[23:52] just showed me how much more

[23:53] the intention and the heart behind the action.

[23:55] Like humans are so good at sniffing out intention.

[23:57] We can, it's just so,

[23:58] you have to be so perfect at lying.

[24:01] It's impossible.

[24:02] And so the easiest way to become,

[24:05] to become trusted is to be trustworthy.

[24:07] Right?

[24:08] It's to actually have people's best interest in mind.

[24:09] And if you can't get that, then like figure out a way

[24:11] to do that and then the selling will happen on its own.

[24:13] The next belief that I had that was broken was

[24:15] that organic traffic is very worthwhile.

[24:18] If you are patient, you were good enough.

[24:20] And I think that being good enough

[24:21] comes back to the stuff I started earlier,

[24:22] which is when you talk about stuff you know,

[24:24] make sure it's true because you did it.

[24:26] If someone else made it, don't remake it.

[24:27] Like making for yourself, assume no one else is gonna watch it

[24:30] and so make it anyways.

[24:31] And at the end of the day, I think this stuff has to be art.

[24:33] Because you make art because you believe it should exist.

[24:36] Not because the art's going to do something for you.

[24:38] True art is made to exist because you believe it should exist

[24:41] because you believe the universe is better for it.

[24:43] Like you believe the body of knowledge

[24:44] exists as a result of this thing.

[24:46] If you're making something to do something,

[24:48] it's usually not as good and people can sense it.

[24:51] And I think that's where people fail with organic marketing,

[24:54] which is just like earned media.

[24:56] And I'll share this with you, my YouTube team,

[24:59] bro, Scott told me something that he said was like,

[25:03] his biggest learning that I'm sharing with you

[25:05] from what he told me.

[25:06] And he was like, you have the longest time

[25:08] rise in of anyone ever worked with.

[25:09] It's like you just, you talk in like five year and 10 year

[25:12] time rise in for like whether we're gonna

[25:14] do something successful or not.

[25:16] And I guess sometimes you adopt these things

[25:19] and you get so used to it that you forget

[25:21] that other people don't think that way.

[25:22] And so I guess I'm sharing it with you

[25:24] because he seemed to think that it was something

[25:26] that was worth sharing.

[25:27] But like time is everything.

[25:29] Like how you think through how long something is going to take

[25:33] because time is really just a function

[25:35] of your expectations of an outcome.

[25:36] And so if you could extend the time rise

[25:38] into infinite, then you basically remove your expectations.

[25:41] And when you can create with that expectations,

[25:43] you usually end up creating better stuff.

[25:44] And so it's one of those things where like you only gain

[25:47] your life when you choose to give it, right?

[25:49] You only achieve happiness when you decide that it's no longer

[25:53] a priority, right?

[25:54] And you just start to live and accept the moment for what it is.

[25:56] And so I think that it's in a lot of ways,

[25:59] it's similar that time rise in really feed and everything.

[26:02] And the most successful people that I know

[26:04] have the longest time rise in.

[26:05] And in game theory, the person that don't long as time

[26:07] rise in wins, it's the difference between fine

[26:09] that and infinite players.

[26:10] And so you can literally give yourself

[26:11] an immediate competitive advantage simply by thinking

[26:14] I will outlast, I will endure it.

[26:15] And I will be here for a long time.

[26:16] And you build with that in mind.

[26:18] And so what happens is you just, you get rid of all

[26:20] the short term plays.

[26:21] Like I was asked the other day like, why don't you create

[26:23] a no-strip line?

[26:24] And I'm like, is it's just not, what's the point?

[26:26] You know what I mean?

[26:27] Maybe I'll change my mind later, but like I just,

[26:29] it's like short term cash drive, right?

[26:31] And so I think it's all about being long term selfish,

[26:33] rather than short term selfish.

[26:34] And long term selfishness comes from just giving more

[26:37] than everyone else, which ends up benefiting humanity,

[26:40] which is great that humanity serves

[26:42] or rewards the people who give the most,

[26:44] which I think is interesting.

[26:45] Moving along, so we had COVID in 2020, 2021

[26:48] is their cover for all three of our companies.

[26:50] It taught me a very important lesson

[26:52] which is a buffet quote, but market over manager,

[26:55] which is it is more important

[26:56] the boat that you are in,

[26:57] rather than how hard or how well you row.

[26:59] And you know, our company was able to have a very strong

[27:02] recovery as a result of that,

[27:04] but it taught me that we were not Superman,

[27:06] that we are valuable, that we can lose.

[27:11] And despite how hard we row,

[27:13] it's, you can still have harder,

[27:15] like you can still not achieve the outcomes that you want.

[27:17] And so I decided, you know, when, when, when the flu hit

[27:20] or whatever, that I was not going to, like,

[27:22] we were like, we're not going to be affected by this.

[27:24] Like we've made, I was like,

[27:25] I've made the decision that we're not going to be affected by this,

[27:26] but, you know, my decision did not really change reality.

[27:29] And so it really was very humbling for me to see

[27:31] that like, yes, indeed market is stronger than the manager.

[27:34] And so that is what, you know,

[27:35] spawn me to create a 55 minutes

[27:37] to become a millionaire, that, that, that presentation,

[27:38] because it's all about opportunity vehicles.

[27:40] And that was a great deal of my thinking last year

[27:42] in putting together what we were doing with acquisition.com.

[27:44] Another conversation that I had was with Perry Balthier,

[27:47] who told me a story and I think he's,

[27:49] he's in, I think he's 60, hopefully Perry don't get up

[27:51] seven, maybe he's in his 50s.

[27:53] I don't know.

[27:53] And he said that when he looks back in his life,

[27:55] he said three or four huge, like,

[27:57] where he was crushing, it just home runs, right?

[27:59] Where he was just hitting another part of business wise.

[28:01] And he said, and every time he did it, he thought it was

[28:02] because he was doing so well.

[28:03] He said, but when he looked back on it,

[28:05] it was because he had,

[28:06] hopped on a trend that was happening that he was unaware of.

[28:09] And he's like, he was selling gold by the inch

[28:11] at some point, like, it's first big, you know, home run thing.

[28:14] And it was because, it was, it was gold-plated metal.

[28:17] It was because the cost of gold was so expensive.

[28:18] And so he happened to hop onto a trend that he was

[28:21] unknowing of.

[28:21] And so people wanted alternatives to gold, right?

[28:23] And so he was selling something that capitalized on a trend.

[28:26] And it blew up.

[28:26] And he's got a company now that does, you know, book

[28:29] he presend VAs, and it's because cost of wages in the US

[28:32] has skyrocketed, and there's a huge demand for offshore

[28:34] services.

[28:35] And so he's just riding that way, and he said,

[28:36] so, you know, as I've gone on, he's like,

[28:38] I've learned to market, learn to sell,

[28:39] I've all these skills and expertise,

[28:40] but a lot of times, I was just riding the market.

[28:43] And so I think that I too have had a little bit, you know,

[28:45] I think I've had a little bit a little more humbled by life

[28:47] that some of the biggest successes we had

[28:49] have just been, like, you know, I mean,

[28:51] we were at the right place the right time.

[28:52] The thing is is that when those occasions do happen,

[28:55] swinging hard at that fat pitch,

[28:56] because you don't know when the next one's gonna come.

[28:58] And so I think that that, something that we did well,

[29:00] but I would urge you that if you are in something

[29:02] and something is growing, is crushing it,

[29:03] don't think it's because of you, but do go all in.

[29:06] And I think that you will be very happy with the outcome.

[29:09] The market makes a lot of our success.

[29:11] We feel smart or dumb, and it has nothing to do with us

[29:13] the entire time.

[29:14] It was the little email thread that I left to myself.

[29:17] And so that was very interesting for me.

[29:20] Now, next lesson in failure, talent.

[29:23] So a lot of stuff on hiring and building team,

[29:25] because that was what was necessary for us to sell.

[29:27] And obviously build the whole code for acquisition.com.

[29:30] So for context, you know, everybody in the whole code

[29:32] of acquisition.com, we've got Harvard grads, we've got McKinsey,

[29:36] which is then a more consultant,

[29:37] management consulting from the world.

[29:38] I'm crouched from there.

[29:39] We have some of the best strategists from Vanguard,

[29:42] which manages to six trillion dollars,

[29:43] and that we've created in, to really get the absolute best

[29:46] of the best people.

[29:47] We had, you know, RCHFO has been CFO of a $5 billion,

[29:50] a $1 billion and a $750 million company.

[29:52] She's been sell side exit 16 times.

[29:55] So very, very, very, very well versed experience team.

[29:57] And so I've learned a lot about talent,

[30:00] the management, the acquisition of talent,

[30:02] and my perspectives on business have fundamentally changed

[30:04] from the work five years ago.

[30:05] I used to think it was all about strategy.

[30:07] Now I think it's all about people.

[30:09] And because if you find great people, great people,

[30:12] build great strategy, and execute great strategy

[30:15] to build great companies, you can't build a great company

[30:17] without great people.

[30:18] And I just, I just really, I just didn't think that

[30:21] when I was younger, I was like,

[30:22] I can will power my way through it, and it's just,

[30:24] even if you can, you can't do it forever.

[30:26] I'm gonna be again, I don't know.

[30:27] But for me, like at a certain point,

[30:28] it wasn't worth it in order to scale,

[30:30] like only one man only has two hands.

[30:32] And so you have to have more hands,

[30:33] and you have to have more people lined with your admission.

[30:35] And so, here's some of the conclusions

[30:37] that I've had around talent over the last,

[30:39] however long, better understanding of entrepreneurs

[30:41] versus entrepreneurs.

[30:42] So I had a big, you know, I used to say,

[30:43] like, you need to find entrepreneurs,

[30:44] not entrepreneurs, silly.

[30:46] It was a false binary.

[30:47] Entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs,

[30:48] you just don't continue them.

[30:49] You have some people who are there more or less entrepreneurial.

[30:52] And all of those things can change, given a dynamic.

[30:54] Plenty of people were employees,

[30:56] got laid off their COVID, and decided to start

[30:58] making money on their own,

[30:59] and then found out they did have an entrepreneurial streak, right?

[31:01] And so I used to think that this was much more like born,

[31:04] and I think now that it's much more made.

[31:06] And I never would have considered myself a big,

[31:08] rich, take her.

[31:09] I did everything by the book, you know,

[31:11] for basic bill my career,

[31:12] and I was only very lucky that I hated my life,

[31:14] so much that I was willing to quit everything,

[31:16] to start a business.

[31:17] But that is not common,

[31:18] and it was still one of the hardest decisions

[31:20] in my life, and seeing how easily

[31:21] some people quit their jobs compared to how long it took me

[31:23] to do it, even when I had no stake.

[31:24] I had no family, I had no kids.

[31:25] It was still the hardest decision my entire life.

[31:28] I really do think more and more

[31:29] that entrepreneurs are made rather than born.

[31:31] And it is, again, a continuum,

[31:33] and that continuum can change,

[31:34] where you sit on that continuum,

[31:35] can change based on your circumstances.

[31:37] And so I think that there's this,

[31:39] he's a pure entrepreneur,

[31:40] he's not a pure entrepreneur,

[31:42] and to me I feel like it's like,

[31:43] in this context for right now, and that can change.

[31:46] So that was something that I thought was interesting.

[31:48] And in that way, when we were recruiting talent,

[31:50] I'm not really looking necessarily

[31:51] for entrepreneur entrepreneur,

[31:52] it's just like, is this person aligned

[31:53] with where we want to go,

[31:54] and are they motivated intrinsically by getting there?

[31:57] Right, and so, then they will be entrepreneur,

[31:59] or if we can create the environment,

[32:00] such that those character traits come out.

[32:03] And I'll tell you the one thing

[32:04] that's sealed the deal for this,

[32:05] is that Layla's father is the,

[32:08] or was the dean of the McKinow Engineering Department.

[32:10] So academic, all the way 10 year,

[32:13] literally the most secure,

[32:15] security driven career path of all time.

[32:18] And I remember saying, I was like,

[32:20] if he can start doing entrepreneurship,

[32:22] I was like, I will change all of my views.

[32:23] Because I mean, literally an engineer in academia, 10 year,

[32:26] like it's just like all of the most security

[32:28] different things.

[32:29] And lo and behold, here he is now,

[32:31] starting his entrepreneurial dream,

[32:32] that he retired, and he's making money.

[32:34] And I like, I'm just filled with pride seeing that.

[32:38] But at the same time, it just, it was such a testament

[32:41] to the fact that we can change our stars.

[32:43] We can be what we want to be.

[32:45] And that was just such a big profound proof point for me,

[32:47] that it really shifted the way I saw talent

[32:49] in entrepreneurship in general.

[32:51] Next one, it was, in terms of finding talent,

[32:53] it is now that my, it's now my feeling that it is

[32:55] better to find a 400 better than a teaspoon

[32:58] on how to swing.

[32:59] Right, I would rather find people were really, really good,

[33:01] already, and then orient them,

[33:03] rather than trying to teach someone how to do the thing.

[33:07] Right, now you might not be able to afford that

[33:08] at a certain point in your business career,

[33:09] but that is still the ideal that I would,

[33:11] that I would go towards.

[33:12] And if you look at what Steve Jobs, you know,

[33:14] was able to do in his career, he was really the

[33:17] assembler of great people towards a common mission and goal.

[33:19] And that is what creates big companies,

[33:21] is lots of people align in a specific direction

[33:23] to something that is meaningful.

[33:25] Which again, if the point of your company

[33:26] is to make you money, it's not that meaningful

[33:28] for a lot of people.

[33:29] And so it has to be something bigger than you.

[33:30] And that again is something that I had to learn.

[33:32] Once you do that, you need to get out of their way, really.

[33:35] And so I have a friend of mine who owns a company,

[33:38] and he's a CEO of that company.

[33:41] And the founder of the company, you know,

[33:43] made him CEO, but he has become,

[33:46] he's not really a CEO by the true sense

[33:48] that he's not actually executing and like leading

[33:51] the stuff because the founder is micromanaging,

[33:53] which either means one of two things,

[33:55] either don't trust the person to do their job

[33:58] or you're not good at hiring people.

[34:00] It's like either the person has the talent

[34:02] and you need to trust them,

[34:04] or they don't have the talent,

[34:05] which means you suck at hiring.

[34:06] But either way, we suck.

[34:07] And so once you do have the right person,

[34:10] you have to extend trust,

[34:11] even if that person hasn't quote earned it yet,

[34:13] because it's the only way that the machine runs.

[34:15] And trust is typically reciprocal

[34:16] and sometimes you have to give it first.

[34:18] And you will make more by giving it

[34:20] than by deciding to live a life without trust,

[34:22] even if you get burned.

[34:23] So that was been a lesson for me from the last year.

[34:26] One of the next ones was,

[34:27] A players are the things that really grow business.

[34:30] And once you get stuck at 30,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000

[35:00] And most people are not actually,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,

[35:30] You know,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,

[36:00] of discipline of not overspending means remaining charitable,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,

[36:30] But I think that if we view our leadership as a process of our leadership as a process of our leadership as a process of our leadership as a process of our leadership as a process of our leadership as a process of our leadership as a process of our leadership as a process of our leadership as a process of our leadership as a process of our leadership as a process of our leadership as a process of our leadership as a process of our leadership as a process of our leadership as a process of our leadership as a process of our leadership as a process of our leadership as a process of our leadership of our leadership of our

[48:00] leadership of our leadership of our leadership of

[48:30] leadership of our leadership of our leadership of

[49:00] leadership of our leadership of our leadership of

[49:30] why right if you can answer that question I guarantee the hit it last one last last major lesson topic for me was

[49:39] leverage the amount of we make amount of money we make is

[49:42] directed proportionally amount of leverage that we are able to employ you know Naval has his

[49:47] his his four that he talks about I read name them as sees so I could remember it

[49:51] but you've got collaboration which is in playing other people you've got capital which is using other people's money

[49:57] you've got code which is using software and you've got content or media right which is

[50:03] all of these things

[50:05] especially the top two you can

[50:07] replicate without cost right like if two people use the software or a hundred people uses offer

[50:12] there's very little additional cost if one person watches this video or a thousand people watch this video

[50:16] there's no added cost to me for capital if I can use other people's money right then I can grow something faster

[50:22] if I can use other people's time when it comes to labor then I can do more right and so

[50:27] I think understanding how to use all four of those things is one of the things that unlocks true wealth

[50:31] and so I would encourage you and this has been a process that I've taken I've really

[50:36] geeked out on but look at the wealthiest people in the world and look at the people around you are

[50:40] succeed or who are growing quickly and look at which of those four sees if one two three four or all of them

[50:47] they are using two grow their businesses and so now when I look at opportunity it's how can I

[50:54] employ the most leverage in the opportunity because then all leverage does is give you higher output per unit of effort or time

[51:01] That's all it is if we only have limited time the extent to which we can multiply that time is an extent to which

[51:08] We are employing leverage which is the multiplier and so these are all multipliers in it of themselves

[51:13] if you look at Facebook

[51:14] They used they have late birth there's lots of employees are working there there's capital they used other people's money to grow the business

[51:20] There's code which is the software based that the whole thing is built on and they sell media

[51:24] It's all four right all four things are created and that's why the thing is the empire that it is

[51:29] You can see how people are employing these things together you look at

[51:32] Grant and some of you guys for some reason like poop poo the fact that like I've even talked to Grant which is

[51:36] Beyond saladomy whatever some is doing better than you and anything

[51:40] There's something we can learn from them right and so

[51:43] Like I'm gonna I'm gonna talk to you hard for a second it is your ego

[51:48] That is fragile that makes you

[51:51] Not want to learn from someone else who's doing better than you in some way because

[51:56] You feel like it makes you suck and you want to give an excuse for why someone else has achieved more than you in that way

[52:01] Well, he doesn't have the ethics that I have well he has better genetics well

[52:05] Well, he was born better looking whatever it is right for the wife right whatever it is it doesn't serve you

[52:12] And I say this as somebody who used to do that a lot

[52:15] And so I realized that I was not getting any better by giving up all my excuses for why I wasn't achieving what someone else was achieving

[52:23] And so the biggest goal was to reframe my envy into curiosity which is how are they doing that and how am I not doing as well as them if I

[52:31] Claim to be all these things

[52:32] Then the reality should match that and it's not and so I will break down why I think I think Grant's gonna multiply by a lot like a lot

[52:40] a lot

[52:42] So one you know set a you know set a galvanized people towards across so you know set an employee and and and have people aligned

[52:50] So that's he's got collaboration the next level is he's got capital

[52:54] He's raising tons and tons and tons of money to to buy stuff and he's got tons and tons of content and

[53:00] The next move that I think he's going to make is is around starting a bank and I think it'll be one of the most brilliant moves that he makes because

[53:07] What's even easier than getting someone to invest just get someone to save and what will be cool is that what is gonna happen

[53:13] It's using a so many deposits into card owned bank that he can then use that money to go to the Fed and

[53:18] He can lever bank rates of leverage and then buy way more stuff to get returns on that because people are still's too chicken shit

[53:26] To make investments for themselves so they're just gonna bank and he'll give them a better return on their money than the banks are and

[53:31] He'll be able to suck so much cash from the universe of his audience

[53:35] That he will get so much leverage on this things that he's went and buy I think it's gonna be a really really cool thing to say

[53:40] And so I was I think they're in that way we can learn of him now does he have any does he have any code?

[53:45] No, he's got three of the four maybe able to embed that stuff in later

[53:48] Maybe won't I don't know and so the things is like you don't need to have all of them

[53:52] But the more of them you have the more multi-plicative the effect is on the ultimate amount of money that you make and when someone goes from you know

[53:57] Zero to billionaire in a decade

[54:00] I think we can all learn something from it. I certainly

[54:03] am trying to analyze everything that someone is doing much better than I'm

[54:06] Is doing right special this that I'm super designed like well I was alive ten years ago and he was alive ten years ago

[54:11] And he became a billionaire in that time and I did not become billionaire

[54:14] Therefore he's better at this game than I am right now right and so

[54:19] I just think it's really valuable to look at that way the last piece is a

[54:23] seasons of waiting

[54:25] Waiting and inaction are active decisions

[54:29] Charlie Marvard talks about this when it comes to investing and he's like not selling is an active decision

[54:33] All you have to do is look at the markets because people cannot hold themselves back

[54:36] It's not that we are doing nothing. We are doing nothing

[54:39] Get the difference we're not doing nothing. We're doing nothing and that was the active decision we chose to make and

[54:46] So sometimes we just need to wait and that was something that I feel like I learned last year as well

[54:51] We said you know you can't you can't you can't have you can't you can't get nine women pregnant for a month to have a baby

[54:58] Right like some things take time. I think an acceptance of a different view on time has been something that shaped

[55:05] My life for the better and I can tell you the people unequivocally

[55:09] They make the most money that I know all speak in the longest time-risings and the people who make the least amount of money

[55:14] Unequivocally talking to shortest time-risings the people who talk about today tomorrow next week this month

[55:20] Make less money than the people we're talking about five years from now with out fail and so if that's all

[55:25] You can think about which is what are we making this month? What are we making this week? What are we making today?

[55:29] Right you need to extend your time-risings because when you do that you think smart because you think long

[55:35] And when you think long you make games where if you wait you win and so most of your nation

[55:40] Those are the lessons and failures from 2021

[55:42] There's the things that I learned that were very valuable to me. I made another video about just lessons that I learned from the sale

[55:47] Which I think I might have made a little bit too technical

[55:51] And I have another video that I made about how to sell a business

[55:54] That was very in depth as well in terms of the actual process of selling because I get lots of questions around that and so

[55:59] Check out those videos if you did and as always love you all and I'll see you guys in the next video keeping us up. Bye

[00:00] What's going everyone?

[00:00] Welcome back, quick little tactical training

[00:04] for you today as well.

[00:06] How to close everyone, down something like a pro.

[00:08] So one of the big beliefs that I like to set in our communities

[00:10] is that everyone buys something.

[00:12] What I mean by that is that everyone has some money,

[00:14] no matter what, and everyone has this problem,

[00:16] and we should find a way to help everyone

[00:18] to a certain degree.

[00:19] And obviously you want to try and sell your primary program

[00:22] because that's going to be objective.

[00:23] That's because you think it's going to help them the most,

[00:25] et cetera.

[00:26] But there come times where people can't afford it

[00:29] for whatever reason.

[00:30] That's reality.

[00:31] All right, anyway, tell us your other eyes.

[00:32] What are you talking about?

[00:33] So in the real world of sales,

[00:35] understanding how to downsell like a champ

[00:38] is one of the reasons that you'll be able to massively

[00:40] increase your close rate.

[00:41] Now, doing it properly is one of the key points here.

[00:46] So when you do it poorly, it sounds like begging,

[00:50] and it sounds like you totally lose your frame in the sale.

[00:53] And now you sound desperate and aggressive and clingy.

[00:56] And you sound like you've got,

[00:58] I love this term, Commission, Breath,

[01:00] and basically just ruins the sale.

[01:02] And then they don't even if they could afford it,

[01:03] they don't want to buy for me because of what you're doing.

[01:05] It sounds unethical, et cetera.

[01:06] I like, wait, you just said it was this price.

[01:07] You're just going to keep lowering it.

[01:09] And so the key to doing this is having a key set of cards

[01:14] that you have in your back pocket that you can choose to play

[01:17] as you go down.

[01:19] So it's kind of like a step-to-step.

[01:21] And the way that you do this is through exchange.

[01:24] So one of the other powerful influences

[01:26] in human psychology and in general is reciprocity.

[01:30] We have a very hard time if someone gives you something,

[01:33] not giving something back.

[01:35] The beautiful thing is, is that after you exchange something,

[01:39] the person who sets the terms always has the power

[01:41] and the agreement.

[01:42] So for example, if someone asks me to do something,

[01:46] which is essentially what they're doing when they say,

[01:48] no, they can't afford that.

[01:49] They're asking you to do something for them.

[01:51] Can you do it for less?

[01:52] That's the implication, right?

[01:54] They can't do it for that.

[01:54] What else can you do?

[01:56] And so there's a study that like show this and I mean,

[01:59] there's hundreds of studies that show this.

[02:00] But where they took people in colleges

[02:03] and they let them cut in line.

[02:07] And the thing is, is that doing a small favor,

[02:10] people don't have a good idea of what,

[02:12] of what, like, equality in an exchanges.

[02:15] And so if you do a small favor for someone,

[02:18] and after you do the small favor,

[02:20] then make a big ask, it's still very hard for people

[02:24] to say no.

[02:25] And so that's the thing is that people don't have

[02:27] with reciprocity, an idea of fairness of exchange there.

[02:31] Like it's like, hey, yeah, remember I bought

[02:33] you lunch yesterday?

[02:35] Can you take me to the airport and back this weekend?

[02:37] Or can you help me move out of my apartment?

[02:39] Like, that's not a fair exchange.

[02:41] But the thing is, is that with reciprocity,

[02:42] people will say, yes, to things because of just underlying

[02:46] human psychology.

[02:48] So here's how you use reciprocity,

[02:50] which is one of the strongest things,

[02:51] motivators for persuasion in a downselling environment.

[02:55] So after, let's say you offer your primary program,

[02:58] you're like, hey, it's, you know, it's X.

[03:00] Right?

[03:01] And they're like, I just can't afford that.

[03:04] So what you say is this, you say, tell you what,

[03:07] I'll do it for this if you, XYZ, right?

[03:11] If you leave me a testimonial.

[03:13] So I'll drop the price in half if you leave me

[03:15] a testimonial, fair enough.

[03:17] And when you say that, it's like,

[03:19] they ask you to make some sort of adjustment.

[03:23] You take that in consideration.

[03:24] You make the adjustment and you make the offer again.

[03:26] And you say, does that sound fair?

[03:28] Right?

[03:29] And the thing is, it's very difficult for people

[03:30] to keep hearing that over and over again and not say yes.

[03:34] So give you an example of one of the step downs

[03:36] that we use, it's really successful.

[03:37] And so let's say we're selling our front end program

[03:40] for $300 for three hundred bucks a week,

[03:42] price straightforward, three weeks.

[03:44] So they say no.

[03:46] They say, you know how this too much for me

[03:47] and say no problem.

[03:48] What if we did 49 weeks for 12 weeks, right,

[03:51] with a commitment?

[03:52] And so we're doing is that you always have these,

[03:54] you always have these cards that you can play.

[03:56] So in a fitness example, right, you have the term.

[03:59] So how long are they're committing to?

[04:00] That's number one.

[04:01] Number two, you can ask them to give you a testimonial.

[04:04] You can ask them to give you reviews.

[04:06] You can ask them to bring a friend.

[04:07] And each of these things are things that you can ask them to do

[04:10] so that you can ethically lower the price

[04:12] because you're asking them to do more.

[04:14] All right, on top of that,

[04:16] you can also add bonuses in the original package.

[04:18] I don't like removing bonuses as much

[04:20] because I want to give them those things.

[04:23] And so it's more like, I'd rather go in the other direction

[04:26] of asking them to do more things for me.

[04:28] And that way, if someone else is like,

[04:30] why she paying X and I'm paying Z,

[04:33] you can say, well, she's doing some extra things

[04:35] for me that you're not.

[04:36] And they're like, oh.

[04:37] And so that way you're not saying like two people

[04:39] are having different prices for the same program

[04:42] because you've made additional terms to the agreement, right?

[04:45] So traditional step down would be like, hey,

[04:46] can you do this thing for 299?

[04:48] They say no.

[04:49] You say awesome.

[04:50] No worries.

[04:51] You know what?

[04:52] I can just cut the price in half

[04:54] and if you can just commit to 12 weeks fair enough,

[04:56] they say no and you say, okay, no worries.

[04:59] Let's just not even worry about the commitment

[05:00] just get you started today for 49 bucks.

[05:02] Fair enough, they say no.

[05:04] You say, all right.

[05:06] And you have to acknowledge that it gets kind of

[05:08] increasing ridiculous as you make more and more offers, right?

[05:10] In it in a light tone because it's still gonna

[05:13] pull on that internal mechanism inside of people

[05:17] to take action and say yes, okay?

[05:20] So we've already done two drop downs.

[05:21] We did half price with commitment, then we removed

[05:24] commitment, $49.

[05:26] All right, we're $49 and we eliminate commitment.

[05:28] That's two step downs.

[05:29] All right, step underneath of that.

[05:30] You're like, all right, how about this?

[05:31] I'll do it for $39 if you leave me a testimony at the end.

[05:34] Fair enough.

[05:35] And also when you have the testimonial,

[05:37] you're also putting another implication

[05:38] that they're going to get results.

[05:39] So you're selling while you're down selling at the same time, right?

[05:43] Now you've said three downsets, fair enough.

[05:46] They're like, no, I still can't do it.

[05:47] You're like, all right, cool.

[05:48] Let's just get you kicked off at $29 a week.

[05:50] Pays you go, don't worry about it.

[05:52] And just bring a friend in the first 30 days.

[05:56] All right, that way I can at least cover my cost

[05:57] and that way it gets me at least half price

[05:59] without a same before.

[06:00] Fair enough.

[06:01] It's hard for someone to hear that.

[06:04] Make have you make all of these,

[06:06] what is it?

[06:07] Accommodations for them and not say yes, three, four, five,

[06:12] six times and be very clear about how you're asking for this.

[06:17] Don't just say sound good, sound great.

[06:20] Cool, that's not the call to action.

[06:22] The call to action when you're down selling.

[06:24] I mean, I really like this in general, what I'm selling

[06:26] is fair enough, sound fair.

[06:29] Because you're lowering the bar to just say,

[06:32] yeah, that sounds fair.

[06:33] You're like, awesome.

[06:34] Great, what card do you want to use?

[06:35] Let's get you started, right?

[06:36] Ha ha ha.

[06:38] If you want, you can even transition really cool.

[06:40] Do you want to do your, you know, your tuition appointment

[06:42] in the morning or the afternoon.

[06:43] So you're already taking more micro steps

[06:45] in the right commitment for you as to the card.

[06:46] If you want to do that.

[06:47] But I'll go through this one more time for everyone

[06:50] who's listening.

[06:52] So primary offer, it's $2.99.

[06:53] It's got all this amazing stuff.

[06:55] Fair enough?

[06:56] No, okay, no worries.

[06:59] What we can do is if the price is enough,

[07:01] but you really still want this.

[07:02] If you want to just go longer,

[07:04] which you're probably going to need anyways, right?

[07:05] I'll do it for $49 and we could just half

[07:07] of what I said earlier, right?

[07:09] Fair enough.

[07:10] And when you're asking this, you have to ask it

[07:13] like you actually want them to say yes.

[07:15] And that's why the tonality is so important.

[07:16] Don't just read the script and be like, sound fair.

[07:19] Like, if you're like fair enough,

[07:21] like you have to really, you have to ask it.

[07:23] Like you're actually asking them to say yes.

[07:26] I know this sounds minor, but it's everything

[07:28] over the phone.

[07:28] You don't have your body to make so that they can see

[07:31] because only 9% of communications verbal, right?

[07:34] And everything else is how you say the words,

[07:37] not just the words you're saying, right?

[07:39] I can give you another example of like how,

[07:41] I can take one sentence and make it mean like six things

[07:43] and I know that's my how you say it.

[07:44] All right, sales is the same thing.

[07:46] So big program, they say no commitment at half price,

[07:50] fair enough, they say no, they say listen.

[07:52] Don't worry about it.

[07:53] I get it sometimes convenient can be scary.

[07:55] I about this.

[07:56] I'll just let you get started for a day.

[07:57] Pazzy go, I'll prove myself.

[07:59] All right, we don't have to get married.

[08:01] We can just start first date, right?

[08:02] $49, all right?

[08:04] Fair enough.

[08:06] You got a really wait for it.

[08:07] And they're like, you're like, okay, you're counting it.

[08:10] That's okay.

[08:11] No worries, we'll get this started.

[08:12] We'll figure this out together.

[08:13] The thing is is that when you're doing this,

[08:15] it's collaborative.

[08:16] You're on the same side of the table saying,

[08:18] let's figure out a way to make this work, right?

[08:20] Because if you have built the report

[08:22] throughout the sale, you've dug the pain, right?

[08:24] So they know that this is something

[08:25] that they need to do and they know they need to do with you.

[08:27] They will work with you as long as you've maintained

[08:29] a report and you don't get aggressive, right?

[08:32] And so you're like, okay, no worries, how about this?

[08:36] I'll do it for 39 a week.

[08:37] All right, so it's 25% off of my already 50% off, right?

[08:41] If you just leave me a testimony at the end.

[08:43] Fair enough?

[08:45] It's hard for people to keep saying no to that.

[08:48] And you're like, okay, 39.

[08:50] All right, I'll do it.

[08:52] All right, this is the best I can do, all right?

[08:55] Because at this point I'm pretty much paying you to work out, all right?

[08:57] So I can do this for 29, all right?

[09:00] Just send me a friend in the first 30 days.

[09:02] That way at least, I can get back to the 49

[09:04] that at least covers my costs.

[09:06] Fair enough.

[09:08] And we say it like that.

[09:09] See how the tonality changes, right?

[09:11] They're like, man, this guy's really trying to help me out.

[09:14] He's really trying to accommodate me.

[09:15] And so when you drop down that many,

[09:17] like at this point we're at six drop downs, okay?

[09:20] So, so this person, all right?

[09:23] If they say no at this point then in my opinion,

[09:25] it's not a money thing.

[09:26] You lost them earlier on in the sale and they're trying

[09:28] to get off and at some point earlier on,

[09:30] they became disengaged for the phone call.

[09:32] All right, that's where you get the hate

[09:33] and I get the credit card they hang up, right?

[09:35] It's because they're just done with the conversation

[09:36] they just want to get off the phone, right?

[09:38] In person, they can't just get off the phone.

[09:40] You have a little bit more fighting room.

[09:42] Over the phone is not that way, right?

[09:44] And so these are the things and that's why you have to

[09:46] confront the obstacles earlier on,

[09:49] like someone's disengaged.

[09:50] They're not paying attention.

[09:51] They're giving you surface level problems.

[09:53] That's really like, hey, can I be real with you

[09:55] instead of nicely?

[09:57] And then you deliver the pain, like, hey,

[09:59] I'm not saying that to make you feel bad, all right?

[10:01] I'm saying that so I can help, right?

[10:03] And so when you say that it's like,

[10:04] you've given yourself permission to inject the truth,

[10:07] rub the pain a little bit, but then you,

[10:09] you put a bandaid on it afterwards, all right?

[10:11] And so any of, that's earlier on objections,

[10:14] I will get into that right now.

[10:16] But knowing how to downsell, we'll massively

[10:19] increase your crows rate and by adding these little cards

[10:22] that you have that you can trade with people on,

[10:24] allows you to have flexibility in the deal, right?

[10:27] And then that way, they can feel like you accommodated them,

[10:30] you still help them.

[10:31] And then ultimately, what you're doing is just

[10:32] trying to get your foot in the door,

[10:34] because in seven days and 14 days,

[10:36] they're finally going to trust you

[10:37] and then they'll buy the full price program later.

[10:39] Like, don't worry about it.

[10:40] It's just like, let's get you going,

[10:42] let's get you in our world so that we can provide value,

[10:45] and then after that, we'll make it work.

[10:47] All right, so two cents on downselling,

[10:49] you need to know how to downsell,

[10:50] and you need to know how to do it ethically,

[10:52] without sounding like you're begging or being pushy.

[10:54] And that's how you do it.

[10:55] All right, lots of little everyone,

[10:56] if you like this, drop a comment, drop a review,

[10:58] drop a, you know, drop a whatever,

[11:00] engage with this.

[11:02] And have a, have a miraculous Wednesday.

[11:05] All right, get you some, bye.

[11:06] You're welcome.

[11:07] You're welcome.

[11:08] You're welcome.

[11:09] You're welcome.

[00:00] If you had advice that you could give,

[00:02] 40 year old Dave, would you tell him?

[00:05] Hey guys, on this episode of Four Mozes,

[00:07] I'm gonna be flying down to Nashville

[00:08] to record a full podcast with Dave Ramsey.

[00:10] I'm gonna be breaking down a viral clip.

[00:12] We posted that went crazy everywhere.

[00:14] We're gonna be doing a full workout together

[00:16] and we'll wrap it up,

[00:16] stay photo shoot and join.

[00:19] What flavor is up?

[00:25] No idea.

[00:26] You never know.

[00:27] It'd be a sinker.

[00:27] There's no chocolate chips.

[00:29] I'm probably a white top one.

[00:32] Not for me.

[00:33] Traveling erupts my productivity more than LaLose.

[00:36] For me, like having my stuff and my setup,

[00:39] I tend to be more effective when I'm at home

[00:40] and so it feels like a bigger cost for me.

[00:42] So I try and do it as little as I can.

[00:44] Going out to C-Dave was something that like,

[00:46] I've always been a big fan of his stuff

[00:48] and so it made a ton of sense for me to take a day

[00:50] to fly out to see him.

[00:52] See, everyone who doesn't fly private,

[00:54] I'll give you a little bit of insight

[00:56] that it's not always as practical as you might think.

[00:58] Because the Wi-Fi is slow as shit.

[01:00] Yeah, we're cheap, five-inch at flyers.

[01:03] We have lunch.

[01:04] I just can't, you know?

[01:05] You can get their faster.

[01:07] And they just pay, I'm seeing amounts for the plane.

[01:09] And it's just like, I don't want to pay

[01:10] for full of the price to just have a nice plane.

[01:13] Like, we're on the big thing speed.

[01:14] That's what we like about it.

[01:15] I'm still not loaded.

[01:17] Where's the fucking daughter?

[01:19] I think I can.

[01:20] All right, make some goddamn content.

[01:25] What?

[01:27] I want to hear about Salomon's paradigm.

[01:28] Yeah.

[01:29] Salomon was an ancient king in the Bible

[01:30] and he was considered one of the wisest minimal time.

[01:32] It's his particular paradox

[01:34] because he made lots of bad decisions repeatedly.

[01:37] Had unfitrolled passion for money and women

[01:39] and neglected to instruct his only son

[01:41] who went on to ruin his kingdom.

[01:42] People give significantly better advice

[01:44] about their own scenarios

[01:46] if they don't know it's about themselves.

[01:47] If you only just followed your own advice

[01:49] to be way better than you currently are.

[01:50] A practice that I started doing,

[01:52] which is I have a coaching session with myself.

[01:54] Weird.

[01:55] I have a conversation with my future self, Z-E-Five

[01:58] and I asked him for an advice on what I should do now.

[02:00] And so 85-year-old me explains to me

[02:03] what I already know in my deep self

[02:06] but my emotional self that's, you know,

[02:08] running the ship for guests.

[02:10] But instead of like meditating to myself,

[02:12] I actually write it down.

[02:13] You would actually like do this in a good job.

[02:15] But that's the way for the wi-fi.

[02:19] Salomon broad jokes.

[02:20] My line and the their line

[02:23] and then my line again as I'm going through.

[02:24] So it's like I'm like chatting

[02:26] but I'm filling out both sides of the chat

[02:29] but I'm putting different hats on.

[02:30] That's like me's arguing to me.

[02:31] Like I do with the shit too.

[02:33] I talk about thinking long and being patient

[02:35] because every day I'm impatient as fuck.

[02:38] I'm like, why is this happening faster?

[02:39] Like this should happen two quarters ago.

[02:41] Like the same thing as you guys

[02:42] feels on Twitter's like, I sealed them too.

[02:46] And on the inside.

[02:47] Oh, wild.

[02:49] I don't know that's why.

[02:54] I'm big on the way.

[02:54] What can I control?

[02:55] What can I get on the control?

[02:56] I hope that there was going to be wi-fi

[02:58] and there wasn't good wi-fi.

[02:59] I knew I was going to basically have three hours

[03:01] of my life taken from me.

[03:02] We ended up turning it into a reporting session

[03:04] which ended up doing really well

[03:06] from the stuff that we recorded in that time period.

[03:07] So ended up being a net positive

[03:08] that I didn't have wi-fi.

[03:09] If I had had wi-fi,

[03:10] the advantage of my not a good capture.

[03:12] So you were here about a month ago.

[03:14] Layling I walk a lot.

[03:15] And so we get stopped fairly frequently.

[03:17] But this particular guy came up to me,

[03:20] didn't say hi.

[03:21] And immediately started telling me about his life.

[03:23] And he didn't take a breath.

[03:24] He was like shaking.

[03:25] He's like, dude, he's like, I'm just so sick of being poor.

[03:27] And he's like, I've got a one year old.

[03:29] I'm working two jobs.

[03:30] He's like, so I just, I don't know how to get a head.

[03:32] This is a video I'm making for a Vauntay.

[03:34] The young man who was working two jobs

[03:37] with a one year old who's struggling

[03:39] and said you're sick and tired of being poor.

[03:40] And did it know how to get out?

[03:42] There are four more people who are struggling

[03:44] than there are people who are succeeding.

[03:45] And so having content that speaks tactically

[03:47] to what to do when you're in that situation,

[03:50] appeals to a much broader audience.

[03:51] It wasn't surprising me that it got the response

[03:54] that it did, but I'm happy that I think it served

[03:57] a lot more people than just a Vauntay.

[04:04] All right, where is the life button here?

[04:07] It's like six buttons here.

[04:09] Someone definitely has a bad button.

[04:14] I think a lot of people beat up on Dave

[04:16] because of his chances on debt.

[04:17] I live 100% debt free.

[04:19] But also his argument, succinctly put is,

[04:22] debt introduces risk.

[04:24] Risk when compounded over a lifetime is bound to come due.

[04:28] If you plan on playing the game for a very long time,

[04:30] you're betting on the fact

[04:31] that you're never gonna have a bad season.

[04:32] And that's a hard bet to make.

[04:35] Thanks.

[04:36] Wish me luck.

[04:38] If your plan requires luck to succeed, it's a bad plan.

[04:41] Oh my god.

[04:43] People travel all over the country.

[04:47] Come here just to say, you know, they're different.

[04:49] That's the work that I'm saying.

[04:50] So I think you're gonna be right here.

[04:51] Dave's gonna be a good one.

[04:52] See, he's a, oh good.

[04:53] That's my good side.

[04:54] Yeah, this is usually my better side,

[04:57] but thank you for having me.

[05:00] Order to have you, sir.

[05:01] For coming to honors.

[05:04] You did a podcast with Ram Steffen

[05:07] and he showed you his investment for Folia.

[05:10] You said something to him that massively changed

[05:12] direction to how we invested.

[05:13] So you know, rich people always enamored me.

[05:16] Like I thought they had some kind of special sauce

[05:18] or something.

[05:19] There aren't any secrets.

[05:20] They find something that they like and that they understand

[05:23] and that they're good at.

[05:24] And they do a lot.

[05:25] Your giftings are much more in the real estate world

[05:27] than they are in analyzing stocks.

[05:30] If we were gonna put a portfolio together of your knowledge

[05:32] base, it would be 80% real estate, 20% stocks maybe.

[05:35] Well, like it's okay if your portfolio is real estate heavy.

[05:37] The reason that that little piece of advice

[05:39] that you gave to Graham was so meaningful for me

[05:41] was because everybody told me what they did

[05:43] and what had worked for them.

[05:44] I talked to probably every guy that I know

[05:46] was rich of the main was like,

[05:47] well, I should I do with all this.

[05:48] And the answers that I got were as different

[05:51] as there are people under the sun.

[05:52] Yep, left me more confused than anything.

[05:54] When I looked at that pie and thought,

[05:55] okay, well, what's mine, I'll watch base.

[05:57] It's all business.

[05:57] I showed that clip to lay on my wife

[05:59] and I was like, I think this is what we should do.

[06:00] I think we should just stick to business

[06:02] and just buy businesses and grow them.

[06:04] That's what we did with acquisition.com.

[06:06] Yeah.

[06:07] Wow.

[06:08] Put money and stuff you understand and you love.

[06:09] Don't put money and stuff because it sounds fancy.

[06:13] I'll bring it to him because I had an,

[06:14] and I could talk to you all day.

[06:15] If you had advice that you could give 40 year old Dave,

[06:19] would you tell him, you know now that you didn't know that?

[06:22] Play incremental long ball.

[06:24] Don't look for the home run.

[06:26] I keep waiting for somebody to call me

[06:28] and for this to get easy.

[06:30] One phone call and it's all over.

[06:32] Oh, no, I don't have to think about it anymore.

[06:33] Someone else is gonna do it for me.

[06:34] It's all automatic.

[06:35] Now we're gonna be automatically.

[06:36] It's never gonna be easy.

[06:37] It's a hustle and ground.

[06:38] It's a claw.

[06:39] You make a bazillion mistakes, make mistakes

[06:41] that are experiments that you survive.

[06:43] You put out a hypothesis.

[06:44] You survive the experiment.

[06:46] It took, live another day to have another experiment.

[06:48] But I don't know the hypothesis.

[06:49] No the product that fails.

[06:50] No other idea that fails.

[06:51] Our failures at Ramsey are,

[06:53] and number and in money are a way greater than our successes.

[06:56] The only thing is we survive them.

[06:58] A, we didn't have debt and B.

[06:59] We never bet the farm on one horse.

[07:01] And so we're not looking for the singular home run.

[07:03] We're looking to survive and fight another day

[07:05] and keep iterating.

[07:06] The accumulated value of those iterations

[07:09] are what we call the gleaming mountain of success,

[07:12] which turns out as a pile of garbage

[07:14] and mistakes that you're just standing on

[07:16] rather than laying under it.

[07:18] I didn't understand brand.

[07:19] I didn't get it.

[07:20] Like what you want you was just all quantitative.

[07:22] Like it was all clicks, conversions.

[07:24] Like that was all I kind of cared about.

[07:26] Going to the content world was kind of an experiment.

[07:29] I done affiliate, I done referral programs,

[07:30] I done paydads, I done cold outbound,

[07:32] but I'd never done content.

[07:33] I'd never made it.

[07:34] And then in making content,

[07:35] you learn about brand.

[07:36] I'm not saying I understand brand,

[07:37] but I know more than I did.

[07:39] It feels like once you start doing that,

[07:41] you realize what you were doing all before was wrong.

[07:43] Ha ha ha.

[07:44] What's going on, dudes?

[07:48] I was like thinking like,

[07:49] let me see if I can download any lessons.

[07:50] If someone's making more money than me,

[07:52] there's always something to learn.

[07:53] I would say having the conversation with Dave,

[07:55] like it's just showing up.

[07:57] He does three hours a day, every single day,

[07:59] for 30 plus years, three hours a day.

[08:02] I've shown up in making content.

[08:03] He's 62.

[08:04] And once you have the right strategy, it's volume.

[08:06] Like you just need to do more.

[08:08] But I think just seeing that level of consistency

[08:10] over 30 years, like I'm grateful

[08:11] that I passed my 10 year mark,

[08:12] but I'm excited for what the next 20 looks like.

[08:15] That's very cool.

[08:16] I like, and talking, you're presenting.

[08:20] I think I've earned more calories.

[08:21] Your brain is 25% of your calorie intake.

[08:24] And it consumes like most of your sugar.

[08:25] Look how good the color, I will fill you.

[08:28] So if Warren Buffett still murdering it,

[08:31] they're getting regular, cherry-coated.

[08:33] It's like two miles, the world are cold,

[08:36] can keep it up a knee.

[08:39] Wait for it.

[08:40] Wait for it.

[08:41] And we're not dead.

[08:43] One more flight in the books of Not Dying.

[08:47] Excited for the codoshit.

[08:50] What is it, Saturn?

[08:53] Oh, good.

[08:53] I got to get a good pump on before I got it.

[08:56] All right, so we're gonna do, I'll be a super set of calves,

[09:11] and hamstrings with alum, owner of raw fitness.

[09:16] I will train way harder.

[09:18] If I'm training with a training partner,

[09:19] I'll train longer, I'll do more reps,

[09:20] I'll do more sets, just someone else holding me accountable.

[09:23] And one of the nice things if you ever get the opportunity,

[09:25] is to train with someone stronger than you.

[09:26] Just like you're limiting beliefs in business,

[09:27] you also have limiting beliefs in lifting.

[09:29] And so when you see someone warm up with your one-ret backs,

[09:32] it really shifts the way you see the weight.

[09:35] Gotta start with calves,

[09:38] start with the most important body part.

[09:39] Caves, we're actually my weakest body part

[09:41] for a very long time, and I actually had a girlfriend say,

[09:43] why don't you train here, caps?

[09:45] And I'd been training them for like three years.

[09:47] So Blum and I have no need to other for...

[09:49] Blum and I have 12 years.

[09:51] Blum was the Jim owner of Hadad Jim.

[09:54] I did not have a Jim.

[09:56] Yeah.

[09:57] You lived in one?

[09:58] Yeah.

[09:58] I would just basically harass everyone.

[10:01] Have them let me just come around

[10:04] while clipboarding, just take notes that everything they were doing.

[10:06] I'm like Alex is the same Alex.

[10:08] He would always be their asking questions

[10:09] that I had no answers to.

[10:10] What's your turn?

[10:12] What's your turn?

[10:13] I'm like, I don't know.

[10:14] I'm 29 years old and I run a gym.

[10:16] I don't know.

[10:17] I don't know what you're even talking about.

[10:19] But what's your onboarding process?

[10:21] This is like, they sign up and then they work.

[10:24] I like to go easy, hard, easy, hard, hard, hard.

[10:37] How do you like it?

[10:38] It's hard.

[10:39] They don't do it.

[10:40] Show it.

[10:41] You can do it.

[10:42] They don't want to do it back.

[10:43] Hard.

[10:44] They don't do it.

[10:45] It's nice.

[10:51] All right.

[10:52] All right.

[10:53] Yeah.

[10:54] Got it.

[10:55] So I try and full body every day because I want to grow everything every day.

[11:02] And I also have a irregular schedule.

[11:04] So I don't want to be like Mondays back day.

[11:06] Wednesdays like day, you know, Friday, shoulder, tricep, I've been in like, I miss two

[11:10] Fridays and around.

[11:11] I haven't trained shoulders, but I still try to have them like three weeks.

[11:13] So I try and everything every day.

[11:14] Bodybuilding and business are actually really similar.

[11:17] And then you will have uneven inputs to create an even output.

[11:20] Because perfect business would have amazing marketing, amazing sales, amazing product, amazing

[11:23] customer success.

[11:24] But the individual might be like, I'm really good at marketing and that's all I do.

[11:27] And that's fine, but the business needs to be balanced.

[11:29] And so I kind of think of the exercises in the same way.

[11:32] I'm only going to select exercises and I'm going to order them and do the most volume

[11:35] on the ones that I need to work on the most.

[11:37] So that my physico raw is more balanced.

[11:40] You know, I think splitting muscles.

[11:43] Typical row shape you're doing the gym and you think it's going to be a better exercise.

[11:47] All right.

[11:48] So that was our workout.

[11:52] So we are heading to a photo shoot.

[11:55] Main reason, if you've ever seen any of my other random images that I've been taking.

[11:59] The reason I'm not wearing a hat is because when we took the photo shoot last time we were

[12:03] in transition on the logos and I didn't want to take a bunch of pictures of the old

[12:06] logo hat.

[12:07] Now we'll have photos once again with the right logo in the hat.

[12:11] And the logo beater.

[12:13] And the logo beater.

[12:14] Essential detail.

[12:15] Cookies.

[12:16] Ordered some cookies.

[12:17] That has no, it's gifts dessert.

[12:19] Yeah.

[12:20] No, whatever.

[12:21] Whatever.

[12:22] It's a horrible offense.

[12:23] Oh, it's so funny.

[12:24] It's a great idea.

[12:25] We saw you take the brownie and slide it into the trash can after you were done your

[12:29] lunch.

[12:30] Didn't take the extra bite.

[12:31] What's the deal here?

[12:32] I'm not accusing.

[12:33] I just wonder, Sid.

[12:34] Why?

[12:35] You never know.

[12:37] What are you going to need?

[12:39] You want to see your little sugar?

[12:40] Well, uh, always up.

[12:44] I've been watching my head since the gym.

[12:46] It's good for your meal system.

[12:48] People who do is we'll run through all the different facial expressions that we use for the thumbnails.

[12:53] All the different panels.

[12:54] So what does it actually those out?

[13:02] Guys, should I get a bra?

[13:03] No, you.

[13:04] Yeah, I can't get a bra.

[13:05] Yeah, I can get a bra.

[13:06] Crush.

[13:07] I did that for you guys.

[13:08] I know a lot of you guys are like, man, you know what made me really like,

[13:11] it was a better than that clearly pressed.

[13:20] There's no one there.

[13:21] It's a good girl pose.

[13:22] Oh, what's this white?

[13:27] You want to listen to feedback from the audience, but you don't want the feedback from the audience to change the brand.

[13:32] Because the brand's your, is your identity.

[13:34] It's your reputation.

[13:35] It'll make you new.

[13:36] And if you get funneled into like the algo of looking like exactly the same.

[13:40] Everything like exactly every other person you're funnels for the algorithm, then you lose the uniqueness of what makes you new.

[13:47] And then you get the views, but then the moment that your type of content no longer is in both.

[13:53] And something else is like your entire brand disappears overnight.

[13:56] I'm going to steal this from Gary.

[13:58] I think it's really good.

[13:59] You are your own niche.

[14:00] Everyone has multiple facets.

[14:01] They just don't express them.

[14:03] Like I like getting dessert.

[14:05] I also look kind of jack.

[14:06] I also am into business.

[14:08] I also work with my wife.

[14:09] It's just like people who fuck with any of this things with fuck with my stuff.

[14:12] But if it was like challenges are really important that's always should make.

[14:15] Then I would be catering to something that's not me.

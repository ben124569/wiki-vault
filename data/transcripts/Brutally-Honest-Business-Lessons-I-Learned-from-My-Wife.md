[00:00] The single most important decision that you have in increasing your net worth. Do you guys know what it is?

[00:06] It is not the business that you start. It is not the industry even that you are in. That's important.

[00:13] It is not the market you serve. It is not your pricing. It is not your legion strategy. It is one thing.

[00:20] It is who you marry. The reason that I think this is one of the most important decisions you make in your life

[00:25] is because that person will be constantly grading at you or that person will be supporting you.

[00:30] I think the vast majority of marriages either fall in the grading category or the neutral category.

[00:35] The more question I get related to this is how do I get my wife and this is more for the

[00:41] fellows but for ladies just reverse the genders. How do I get my wife to be like Laila? How do I get

[00:46] her to like business? The simple answer is you don't because you don't change who you marry.

[00:53] You are not going to change. What I wanted to do is explain to you how this came to be for us

[00:59] and I think that we have a lot of counterintuitive or cruncharian views on marriage and love.

[01:06] I think that we have a very good marriage and it has worked really well. I will share some of the things

[01:10] that have been different for us than most people. When I met Laila, we actually went on a date and

[01:17] it was a 15 minute date because I tried to get her to do a phroyokes. I said it was low commitment

[01:21] and if either of us was weird we could dip out really quickly. She agreed and so we went to phroyoke

[01:26] and within a little bit we hit it off but not in the way that you would normally expect. There

[01:32] was no romantic chemistry. There was no chemistry. I was like man I think this girl is amazing.

[01:38] I was just very interested in her and I thought she was smart and I thought she liked the same

[01:45] stuff as me. She was like this is cool. She is interesting. We ended up walking and talking for

[01:50] like four hours but we didn't have any romantic chemistry at all. Even on our second or third date,

[01:58] Laila was like I don't really get any vibes from you romantically at all. It's like okay cool.

[02:05] But over time obviously we worked on that but in that first couple of dates she was in fitness

[02:12] and she was like one of the top salesmen at 24 fitness at the time and I had a

[02:16] and I was in fitness too and I had a few gyms at the time and so I said gosh you got to stop working

[02:22] for them. You should work for me because I knew if someone could sell I knew we could make a lot of money

[02:25] together and so I pitched her on the idea of quitting her job and coming to work for me which of course

[02:31] she said no because she had just met me from the internet. But anyways I did end up saying

[02:35] I'm going to do this thing called gym lunch and she was like okay I don't care I just met you and I was

[02:40] going to be it's going to be something and so I went and I flew into the first three gym lunch

[02:45] this is when we used to fly out and I did gym turn around and we did I did three of those and I came

[02:49] back. She picked from the airport we talked on the phone every night and I had not taken her on a date

[02:53] up at this point so now it's just like two or three months at this point that we'd been

[02:56] quote dating I had actually taken her out anywhere it was always like hey if you just want to like

[02:59] hang out with me I'm going to be working all day and it was that was kind of like we spent every day

[03:02] together but it was just like I'd wish enjoyed being around each other and so we did this right

[03:09] we came back she picked me up the airport and she was like you better take me on a date and I was like okay

[03:13] okay one thing first right you got to help me process these contracts and she was like oh fine we went

[03:19] I poured us both a drink and I taught her how to process the contracts and then within an hour we

[03:24] had processed a hundred thousand dollars in sales and she looked at me and she was like what do you do again

[03:28] and I was like oh and I understood and she was like isn't legal like yeah it's legal

[03:33] that's here's like okay I'm in at that point she actually left her her roster of personal training

[03:39] clients and joined me in launching the gyms and so we very much started our relationship in business

[03:47] together and then learned the love and romance side I think the business side I think she said this

[03:53] too it became natural to both of us we naturally worked well together and I think there's no

[03:58] coincidence that my business is exploded once I met Layla because she really was the

[04:04] end of my young when it came to everything that we had to do and this is important for anybody

[04:09] was a partner in business the the thing that got us from four five hundred thousand dollars a month to

[04:16] making millions a month was understanding the division of roles and so you know she was really

[04:21] naturally good at sales and so was I and so we were both kind of like just you know tag teaming and

[04:26] that was cool in the beginning because everyone was kind of doing everything but at some point we

[04:30] needed to divide up responsibilities and so we went to a mentor we drew everything on the board

[04:35] of what we needed to do and there's this huge thing of just tasks and activities that we're doing

[04:40] every single day every single week and so we took this big marker and he drew a lot you know

[04:44] big circle around like 80% of it and he was like all right all this goes to Layla and the stuff

[04:49] that was just marketing sales and product he was like this is Alex's and I was like oh this is a great deal

[04:54] right and the thing is is that Layla being as growth-oriented as she is basically I remember

[04:58] because you kept telling herself she was like I'm not going to be the reason this business fails and so she

[05:02] just learned all of this stuff I mean I think that's one of the big reasons that we were able to

[05:06] massively explode after that because we had an amazing operator who could basically fulfill on the promises

[05:12] and and handle the the flow that I could generate and so we started to work together and then it

[05:18] became kind of weird because you know business was growing really quickly and something plays

[05:23] really like so you guys are just like dating or like yeah and they were like they started to get

[05:26] work because like what if you guys break up you know and we were like oh we broke up we'd still do the

[05:30] business together but it got to a point where I was like you know this is this is getting to we need

[05:36] to make a decision about this relationship and so I actually came to Layla and I had a true proposition

[05:44] all right like a proposal in the in the true sense of the word and so I said what do you

[05:51] um if we got married I was like I think it makes a lot of sense and choose like I mean I would say

[05:59] yes and I was like all right I was like well here's my reasoning and so I broke down the reason

[06:03] I was like both young I was like we're both have Persian backgrounds we're both so we have the

[06:07] same cultural things like we get that that side of ourselves we both like fitness you like business

[06:13] we work together all right I was like I feel like this makes sense like we should do this and so

[06:18] she agreed and so we went we got in the car and we went and I was like I guess we got to get you a ring

[06:24] and so got in the car got her a ring came back 45 minutes later and was like well shoot I guess

[06:29] we got to get a church thing organized and so we called him a pastor and I was like you

[06:34] free once they know it and he was like yeah and he was like a Sunday and he was like are you sure

[06:38] like this is fast and we were like yeah we're sure so when did the back to church and got married

[06:42] that was a night so we were engaged for like less than a week and that was it we actually told

[06:48] our parents after we got married so no one knew we just we got married and then told everyone afterwards

[06:53] it was pretty cool and it's been interesting though because our the business always came easy

[06:59] and the romance and the relationship was the part that we had to work at the love side of the

[07:03] relationship because we just we meshed so naturally on the business side and so I say this to say

[07:09] for everyone who continues to ask the question how do I make my wife like Laila I think that you're not

[07:14] going to do that I think Laila is Laila right and I think that your wife is your wife or your partner is your partner

[07:20] right and so you have to figure out what that year in Yang relationship is going to be and if that person is not

[07:26] in the business it is Laila and I is both of our beliefs that there are really only two roles that

[07:30] that person can play in your life they can either be and I got this from Gary Vee but I 100% agree with it

[07:36] they can either be a cheerleader or they can be a fullback all right so the cheerleader is the

[07:41] person who's on the sideline who's cheering you on to win the game right because at the end of the day the cheerleader

[07:47] who actually wants the team to win would never ask the quarterback to come out of the game when the

[07:52] game is on the line all right and you know the difference because if when the game is on the line that cheerleader

[07:56] is asking you to throw in the towel asking you to to hang your locker you know put stuff up in the locker

[08:01] and leave the game with that part with them then that's not a cheerleader that's neither right and that's

[08:06] my point is that if they're not doing one of these two things they are detracting from what you ultimately

[08:11] want to do and there's nothing wrong with a spouse who's not in the business that's totally fine

[08:14] and it's a decision and that's okay right but you still need to be supportive all right so the

[08:19] question are you going to be supportive in that you are covering the other aspects of your life together

[08:24] and the role that that cheerleader plays is that when you are not at work it helps you detach from

[08:28] your work so you gain distance gain perspective can realize that there are other things that are important in

[08:31] life which ultimately will actually make you better business person because if business is the only thing you have

[08:37] right then all of your chips are always on it which makes you more emotional and erratic and makes you make

[08:41] more decisions so if you realize it gives you context and perspective which is why whenever you have a death

[08:46] of someone who's close to you the gift of that death is the perspective that it gives us right

[08:50] and so that is the role that that cheerleader has is they give you perspective and context

[08:55] to the importance or relative importance of business in your life right but they are supportive

[09:00] because they understand that it is for the team right the other role is the role is the dynamic

[09:05] that layland i have which is the full back role which is that one person is blocking while the other

[09:11] person carries the ball down the down the field and we're rotating right one person blocks the other

[09:15] person carries one person blocks one person carries and that has been the role that we have had is that we're

[09:20] both on the field together and so each of those has different pros and cons right and we we were

[09:27] we were big believers our big followers of Esther Parall who's a relationship expert and I think this was such

[09:32] of when I assure this with you because I think it's so valuable as Americans or many of us in the

[09:36] Western world we want to solve problems when in reality many times there are dichotomies that must be

[09:43] managed but cannot be solved I'll give you a business example how do you solve micro managing versus

[09:49] application or delegation right how do you how do you solve that you don't solve it it is a dichotomy

[09:54] that must be managed and relationships as we see them have the same dichotomy between closeness

[10:00] and familiarity and distance and intrigue all right and so what happens is in the beginning of most

[10:06] relationships because you are so distant and you have some similarities if you take some steps

[10:11] towards closeness the relationship improves right you get to know the person better you start to

[10:16] trust them more and you're like this is awesome but what happens is that if you continue down

[10:20] that path you become brother and sister and you just become roommates because you live together you're

[10:24] so familiar there's no variety and there's no mystery there's no intrigue right and we believe me

[10:29] as Lailonite we work together we live together in the same house we work out at the same

[10:32] jet like we spent all of our time so what we have to do is we actively create space and so I think

[10:39] what's important is to figure out where you are on this dichotomy and figure out what action or where

[10:44] you need to lean towards in your tendencies and the relationship to find the middle ground and

[10:49] obviously it's going to sweat it's like a pendulum but you try and keep it in the middle and so for

[10:54] us like I said because we're in business together we actually have to actively create space so

[10:59] we have different offices there are an opposite sides of the house we try not to be on the same

[11:03] meeting something like that because at the end of the day if I want to say hey what you do today

[11:08] actually don't answer I was on every meeting with you there's no space everything is familiar

[11:12] and familiarity though comforting is not attractive all right and so which is why you know

[11:19] like it's like joke the joke is like it's like a brother or sister right like you live together

[11:22] but like it's like right because you're so familiar right you know everything about that person

[11:28] now the flip side is a complete stranger there's all the mystery but there's no trust right

[11:34] and so to have the long-term relationship it is our belief that you have to manage both of those things

[11:39] and so the flip side is a lot of people get married right and one person to work

[11:43] and one person doesn't work and that's okay but what happens is they start to grow apart

[11:48] and because they're not sharing the same reality they grow further further apart until the

[11:51] person feels like a stranger to them right and you probably heard that for people right and so if you're

[11:56] in one of those relationships then the goal should always be how can we share our experience

[12:00] how can we create a shared reality how can we grow together and make sure we are growing in the

[12:05] same direction because the entrepreneurial stimulus that you're going to get from business is going

[12:09] to change you it is going to force you to adapt and by extension grow and the stimulus that

[12:14] your partner is going through is going to force them to adapt and grow and the goal is how can we

[12:18] align that growth so it's in the same direction so that we look at each other 15 years ago we don't

[12:22] think who did I marry right and the person you might have changed and so might have they but I think

[12:28] that in order to maintain the relationship it's maintaining the the middle ground of that dichotomy

[12:33] and so for us our process around this is is we always create space to be missed and I think that

[12:40] some of you who have maybe had a spouse or someone who you spend a lot of time with if you actually go

[12:44] travel somewhere and then come back it's almost like you're really in my opinion I feel like my

[12:48] experience has been better and so it's like you're like miss the person and I think that we need

[12:51] to create more space to be missed especially if you work with your spouse and so for us the relationship

[12:58] has been very much a love logically format we both share the belief that you can create love

[13:02] through actions and so we did not have the romantic love we learned it we actually I you know I would

[13:09] not say that I was in love with Laila when we got married real talk I was not in love with Laila

[13:14] when we got married I loved her as a person and I thought that the decision made sense but we were not

[13:19] in love and it took us I would say it took us until I'd say it took us until 2020 December of 2019

[13:28] we kind of came to a head and we both said that we didn't want to keep living our lives this

[13:32] way so we had you know we were just making I mean a lot of money and we still do but like

[13:38] our lives are very different now right and it was all because the the money that we made for both

[13:43] of us was out of scarcity and lack right we were so fear driven that we were going to lose the

[13:48] thing that we made and so just so you know as you're as you're building your business in the beginning

[13:52] you fear being poor as you kind of transition in the middle you fear losing the status that the

[13:57] money has gotten you right and so the fears change over time but anyways we got into this point and I think

[14:03] we had made $30 million in profit in the last 24 months and we both were like I don't want to

[14:10] keep living this way and so that was when we decided going into 2020 that we were going to like

[14:15] prioritize our marriage and so what's interesting is that in 2020 despite the fact that our

[14:20] businesses got hit because of COVID or whatnot we have a lot of brick and mortar base businesses

[14:25] our marriage probably like tripled that year in terms of how much better it is now etc

[14:32] and it was because we actively spent a lot of time making sure that there was no space between us from

[14:37] uh from uh not in the way that I met earlier but that there were not things between us I think

[14:44] she uses the the catchman for that like whatever sits between you on the couch that you can

[14:48] get to make sure there's nothing there and so I think that there were some things that I you know

[14:52] held onto that I had resented and I think there were some things that she had done to or whatever I mean

[14:56] minor stuff but stuff that grows and I think even the fact that we were unhappy in working and making

[15:02] as much money as we were was great was great in both of us because we we both saw each other working

[15:07] so hard we're like well I don't want to be the one who's not working hard and so we both

[15:10] felt like we'd be letting the other person down and so I think we're even saying hey I'm not really

[15:14] happy with how life is going for us was actually really valuable because then it was like oh you feel

[15:19] that way too I feel that way and then all of a sudden it was like this whole thing diffused and it

[15:23] was this big fear that we had that if we voiced that we weren't happy with how something was going

[15:27] the other person would be like well I am happy right that wasn't the case at all and so by even

[15:31] just admitting that we had a shared reality it allowed us uh to move forward with uh with a a

[15:36] a perspective of like truth and integrity first and so not integrity in terms of lying but truth

[15:42] and radical candor about about we were out emotionally in the moment and we've we really tried to keep

[15:47] that and it's been it's served us very well and so if you have a spouse who's in your business I think

[15:54] figuring out whether the person is a cheerleader or a fullback is an important step right and then

[16:00] adjusting whether you're trying to get closer or trying to get farther away from that person

[16:04] uh in create space if you need it or create closeness if you need it to manage that dichotomy

[16:10] is important and then finally understanding that at least for us love with something that we were

[16:16] able to create rather than something that we got had to marry for and so we married for logic we

[16:21] married for business reasons and I honestly it was one of the best decisions if not the best decision

[16:26] business wise that I've ever made in my entire life and so um if you are in that situation then those

[16:32] are just a handful of perspectives I'll share more um as more comes to me but I thought that it

[16:36] would be valuable since a lot of people continue to ask me about what is the working dynamic like between

[16:41] LL and I and hopefully this video does a little bit uh to put some context to it so

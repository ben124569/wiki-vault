[00:00] I just spent eight hours with the top 10 business owners on school from last month sharing

[00:04] the money-making strategies that they used to win the school games.

[00:08] Here are the best ones.

[00:09] The first thing we talk about affected every business in the room and yours, which is

[00:13] how to get more leads and how to turn those into customers.

[00:15] So it's using free school food.

[00:18] Okay.

[00:19] So, essentially what we do is we create a quantum on YouTube in Instagram stories.

[00:23] We do not have to call the outreach as well.

[00:25] I doubt it.

[00:26] It really happened this.

[00:27] So you're doing content?

[00:28] Yeah, but we're doing content.

[00:30] There's one of them.

[00:31] You're doing outreach to the people who follow and all that stuff on your content?

[00:34] Yeah, and also we get like school organic traffic as well.

[00:38] Yeah, start to do that.

[00:40] Yeah.

[00:41] Well, ranking with you.

[00:43] You'll pre-group like, you know, you'll end discovery.

[00:47] I know idea.

[00:48] Like we didn't optimize for that.

[00:49] I am.

[00:50] Be worth looking at it.

[00:52] How many, do you know how many searches a day we get on tour?

[00:54] I don't know.

[00:55] A lot.

[00:56] What?

[00:57] Like.

[00:59] Yeah, this, this a lot.

[01:00] And.

[01:02] But the, honestly, there's more visits to profiles.

[01:07] That makes sense.

[01:07] Yeah.

[01:08] And then you go profile and see what you do.

[01:09] Why more traffic goes through the profiles?

[01:11] But, indeed. So you have, so you've content.

[01:13] You have outreach.

[01:14] We'll get you a door, man.

[01:16] We've contented.

[01:17] We have outreach.

[01:17] What are you, what else are you doing?

[01:19] Yes, it's like the school organic.

[01:20] So people just click him high profile.

[01:23] And it also being the other people's profiles as well.

[01:26] You know, they just join our curiosity.

[01:27] Yeah.

[01:28] So we then get those people to join the free school group as well.

[01:30] So, I'll put it on like it by the platforms.

[01:32] So how do they, um, so in, in each of these.

[01:35] So you may content and you have it in like the description and do you integrate into the

[01:39] content?

[01:40] Like, okay.

[01:41] Yeah.

[01:42] So I just like leave the link in the description.

[01:43] Also I put in my Instagram bio.

[01:44] So actually in YouTube as well, I just promote my Instagram.

[01:46] People would join the Instagram or the follow-in Instagram.

[01:49] And they're just joined the community.

[01:50] I've curiosity, even though I didn't promote to it.

[01:52] Just in the bio.

[01:53] Um, though with the outreach, we didn't promote the free group.

[01:55] That's only like if people weren't interested, which is like, okay, we've got this free

[01:59] group you might want to join it.

[02:00] And then with school people just join naturally.

[02:02] Okay.

[02:03] So I'll say bio links.

[02:05] Yeah.

[02:06] Plus description.

[02:07] Yeah.

[02:08] Okay.

[02:09] Got that.

[02:10] And so, and what's in there is that the free group or the, the paid group.

[02:12] It's all free.

[02:13] Okay.

[02:14] So this goes to the free group free school.

[02:17] Got it.

[02:18] All right.

[02:19] What else?

[02:20] Okay.

[02:21] So when they join, they get the auto DM, which is the first line of our DM script.

[02:25] Okay.

[02:26] And then we also in the classroom section.

[02:28] So we have a start here post that tells them to go to the classroom.

[02:32] So DM as soon as they join the free school.

[02:34] Yeah.

[02:35] Okay.

[02:36] Yes.

[02:37] All on the free group.

[02:38] Got it.

[02:39] Okay.

[02:40] And then we also have like a start here like pinned post that tells people to wash a course

[02:42] and there's a pinned course as well.

[02:44] So that's in the classroom section.

[02:45] And the course is essentially like a perfect webinar about like Russell Brunson.

[02:48] Maybe.

[02:49] Like we kind of break into a course, but like a perfect webinar.

[02:51] Yeah.

[02:52] And then indoctrination to like book a call and then we just close them on the call.

[02:55] And then we also did the DMs as well.

[03:01] So you see T.A. to call.

[03:03] And then what do you do to maintain the value in the community?

[03:06] Yeah.

[03:07] So our community is actually like it's extremely like inactive.

[03:09] So I just put a pause like now and then.

[03:11] But like it's like the members who are inactive are the ones buying.

[03:15] It's like because they, they, you've like zombies are like dead bodies there.

[03:19] Yeah.

[03:20] So like the free community has like 400ish members, 450ish and about like 53.

[03:24] So it was very like high-convane.

[03:27] Yeah.

[03:28] Yeah.

[03:29] So it's pretty active there.

[03:30] But the community was dead.

[03:31] But yeah.

[03:32] So you can earn a 14% of people who went to your free thing.

[03:35] Yeah.

[03:36] Into your got it.

[03:37] And then you convert them into just a higher ticket paid community as well.

[03:40] Yeah.

[03:41] So it was 99.

[03:42] Yeah.

[03:43] And it's why it's dead.

[03:44] But then.

[03:45] Yeah.

[03:46] Because you just took the most engaged people in the movement.

[03:47] Yeah.

[03:48] But your high ticket immediately engaged.

[03:49] Yes.

[03:50] That's completely active.

[03:51] Yeah.

[03:53] And you take your most engaged people and you take them out and put them some

[03:56] Rousing like torque here instead of course it makes just total seen.

[04:00] No, it's like the people who are inactive were joining the, the height.

[04:03] Because they're active there.

[04:05] Yeah.

[04:06] Yeah.

[04:07] Yeah.

[04:08] That's actually true.

[04:09] No.

[04:10] That's exactly what.

[04:11] Yeah.

[04:12] Yeah.

[04:13] Yeah.

[04:14] And we also tested this with someone else as well.

[04:15] So he was going to enter the school games when he just kind of gave up.

[04:19] But he was making like $500 a month.

[04:22] And we got to $10,900 this month.

[04:24] So what the fun was was tick-tock and Instagram real short form content.

[04:28] A whole community exact same process and we basically 20 X to the income.

[04:33] So literally just drawing.

[04:35] I mean, I would say in the same the other day because somebody asked me this question.

[04:38] I think I'm going to kill an A call.

[04:39] But it's like, how do I convert people from free to paid?

[04:42] And I still think that these single simplest way to do that is just like,

[04:45] depending on the price point, like if it's a low ticket paid,

[04:48] then you just add the onboarding call to personalize their experience,

[04:51] which then it's like, hey, what are your goals?

[04:52] What are your obstacles right now?

[04:53] You know what?

[04:54] You might be really good fit or whatever.

[04:55] And then you can just sell straight into it.

[04:57] If it's hard to get, then you have your, you know, your VSL or your webinar,

[05:02] whatever that you incorporate into their onboarding process and allow them to self-select if it's a,

[05:06] you know, 5000 or whatever, you know, plus offer.

[05:09] That's probably the most, I can imagine that would be the most widely adopted method.

[05:14] This one?

[05:15] Yeah.

[05:16] Yeah.

[05:17] It's the most easy to understand.

[05:18] Yeah.

[05:19] And I'm almost, didn't understand anything else that I heard.

[05:21] But there.

[05:22] Yeah.

[05:23] I've seen that being used over and over and over again, like in a lot of slightly different ways,

[05:28] but because a free community, if you've got content and then you're promising a free community,

[05:33] conversion rates are through the road.

[05:35] It's the most efficient mechanism to convert them.

[05:37] It's a lead magnet.

[05:38] I mean, fundamentally, it's a lead magnet.

[05:39] It's a lead magnet.

[05:40] Yeah.

[05:41] I'm like, under free community as well.

[05:42] You make like indoctrination posts.

[05:44] You know, how Rossi Browse talks about like the internal belief, the external beliefs.

[05:47] You're just basically shatter all their limiting beliefs.

[05:50] Okay, we need to make note to make training on it.

[05:52] Yeah.

[05:53] I'm going to simple, I'm going to do a simple version of this, which is just,

[05:56] traffic free group.

[05:59] Yeah.

[06:00] Free score.

[06:02] It's the group funnel.

[06:04] Yeah.

[06:05] Free score.

[06:06] We already have that training.

[06:09] Yeah, but it's old in the wrong place.

[06:13] Yeah.

[06:14] Yeah.

[06:15] And it's for, yeah, exactly exactly.

[06:17] That works so well.

[06:19] It's probably the most common pattern on school, as I think someone didn't analysis that

[06:24] almost everyone ranking in Discovery and Lead boards has two groups, one free one

[06:28] paid.

[06:29] It's like the, the funnel.

[06:31] Yeah.

[06:32] It's an tactic and it works.

[06:34] Yeah.

[06:35] So this like, for everybody at home, traffic free score, DM to webb plus,

[06:41] basically just drive everything there.

[06:43] So your pin post there, you may contact you soft toss it, be like, hey,

[06:46] maybe you want to pitch in the classroom, which kind of is

[06:49] disamined because you're like, oh, this isn't a width, huh?

[06:52] Yeah.

[06:53] It's, it's a module.

[06:54] Yeah.

[06:55] And we've got some people to rather than making like one on the video,

[06:58] because this is why I teach the students to break it up into small

[07:01] videos and like distribute the webinar like that.

[07:04] They get not look like that.

[07:06] Yeah.

[07:07] It's like there's four videos and introduction and then three core stories

[07:09] and the fifth video is I've got this thing for me.

[07:11] And it puts everyone off guard as well because like,

[07:13] I don't sign up to webinars anymore because like, I'm in that space.

[07:16] This just puts people off guard completely.

[07:18] Yeah.

[07:19] Every step of this is like, extremely efficient because like,

[07:22] I know if you ever link in baro to a free group,

[07:25] but absolutely crashes.

[07:26] Like those groups are the ones that the top of Discovery.

[07:29] Yeah.

[07:30] Because it's just so efficient.

[07:31] We see 80% conversion rates on pages like.

[07:34] And so you get them in and then the auto DM scenes like,

[07:38] 100% of people.

[07:41] And then you put them to that module and that module

[07:44] is starts the funnel and the funnel is like module one module two.

[07:47] Yeah.

[07:48] And then you get them onto a call,

[07:50] Yeah.

[07:51] Which is probably going to be the most efficient method

[07:53] at converting free to paid.

[07:55] Yeah.

[07:56] Right.

[07:57] Some people they don't even book the course.

[07:58] They watch the course.

[07:59] They don't book the course.

[08:00] But then when you DM them, they're like,

[08:01] Oh, yeah.

[08:02] Watch the course.

[08:03] And then they do it.

[08:04] So you DM again.

[08:05] So basically after they watch it, you follow up DM.

[08:07] And also we just DM them anyway.

[08:08] But some people just still watch the course and then book or they'll book later.

[08:11] And they'll just come back to it.

[08:13] And as soon as you're making the post and they're like,

[08:15] they find they go back to the course to get the link and then they book here.

[08:18] Yeah.

[08:19] How much is the thing that you're selling them?

[08:20] The paid group.

[08:21] So it's 999 a month.

[08:23] Okay.

[08:24] But this could work even for a cheap percentage.

[08:27] Like, like, you don't have to do high ticket.

[08:29] You don't even, you don't even have to do a call actually.

[08:32] It could just be selling a $99 thing over DMs and maybe even a call.

[08:36] Because for more, I'm just thinking for beginners.

[08:39] You need because you don't have a ton of traffic in a ton of light.

[08:44] Like privileges to work with essentially.

[08:47] You have to like get the most efficient conversion at every point.

[08:51] Right?

[08:52] Because you're looking to squeeze every last drop.

[08:55] It's also, I mean, this is also from a technical complexity.

[08:58] Like, this is pretty simple.

[09:00] Like, click to free free to you make the five modules.

[09:04] And then you talk to them and ask them.

[09:07] Well, yeah, this is the most effective way to work amazingly well as well.

[09:10] Because especially with the short form content, this is something I really has recently.

[09:13] So the guy who's working with you had like 900 members.

[09:16] He made one post and like 800 people joined.

[09:19] And that's insane.

[09:20] And of course, we booked like hundreds of sales calls from that.

[09:23] Yeah, it's monster.

[09:24] This is very simple.

[09:25] I like this a lot.

[09:27] Do this.

[09:29] This is great.

[09:30] Really good.

[09:32] The thing that I keep, I keep, this is me making a bet.

[09:36] Is that I will bet that there's going to be a lot more.

[09:39] $1,000 a month type quote high ticket like shifting over.

[09:44] Partially because of what you noticed, which is if you can double or triple acquisition.

[09:49] Because it's healthy to cat ratio.

[09:51] And so you can still drive down a cat a lot to improve that ratio.

[09:54] And so I think, I mean, the space always has like a vibe.

[09:58] Right?

[09:59] Like you have like the rank and rent, which is kind of coming back.

[10:01] Right?

[10:02] I think in the high ticket world, there's a lot of people like the pendulum swing a little bit this way.

[10:06] And I think it's kind of coming back just to tiny bit where people, this is why like brand and content.

[10:11] And like value and advance is becoming more and more important because there's not a lot of trust.

[10:15] And to be fair, there's there will always be less and less trust over time.

[10:18] And the more mature the platforms get the less just eyeball arbitrage exists.

[10:22] Like if you remember for that five seconds that clubhouse was a thing.

[10:26] But I had, I need plenty of people went on there.

[10:29] And then we're doing like a hundred thousand a day on clubhouse because it was just huge arbitrage of eyeballs.

[10:35] They're getting way more exposure than they normally would.

[10:38] But as platforms kind of settle that it's like, okay, who's legit starts to rise and who makes the best content.

[10:43] And things like that.

[10:44] And so right now there's not like besides school, there's not like another platform that's really like emerging.

[10:49] And so it's my belief that that's why I trust, that's why content stuff is so important.

[10:54] And so I'm going to be doing this for a long time.

[10:57] And I think that this whole.

[11:00] Thousand all our months like instead of being the three thousand four thousand dollars month, I think a lot more people are willing to stomach the nine nine nine a month.

[11:09] Because they can see and as soon as we roll out more stuff with like reviews and things like that.

[11:13] They don't just make it more and more trusted and I was talking.

[11:16] The other day about this but like if I could start gym lunch all over again.

[11:21] The biggest thing that I would have done differently is I would have probably tried to make it like 10 grand a year.

[11:27] And I would have put all my focus on how do I keep 80 90 percent of my customers were doing.

[11:33] And that would have been my main focus.

[11:36] I just want such a crazy valued price discrepancy that no one would leave.

[11:41] And they would reform more people, etc.

[11:43] Because I would have probably acquired two three four times the customers.

[11:47] And I would also would have stuck longer because like over the last how many years we've done like 5,500 locations that have gone through gym lunch.

[11:55] And like if all 5,500 locations were still paying me I'd be richer than I am today.

[12:01] And so I think about that a lot of like sure there's on one hit like when you don't know how to sell it's very exciting to like start racing your pricing like oh my god I just sold 10,000 oh my god I sold 20,000 oh my god 100,000 like it gets really cool.

[12:14] But once you learn how to require customers you then become completely obsessed on the other side which is oh shoot you realize the game like same when I've talked about this at length which is.

[12:24] You don't want to keep having to go get customers.

[12:26] I mean of course you have like you want to be able to go get customers but not to have to go get customers.

[12:32] And so like that's the big difference and so like when I look at businesses now I can't almost exclusively about how much does this thing grow on a word of mouth.

[12:39] How much like what percentage of customers stay every year once they're like in and activated what not because then it means that I get credit for customers I sold two years ago.

[12:47] And so even if you sold a hundred customers a year if you can keep all of them 10 years from now you're 10 times bigger.

[12:52] And so the vast majority of like the internet marketing world focuses on growing by simply selling more units because they can't keep anybody.

[12:58] But people who make the most money just don't lose customers.

[13:01] But you have to like learn how to sell in order to get there but like this is kind of the evolution that happens and so pricing I like my thoughts on my.

[13:08] And like my thoughts on pricing has changed from the the old school day and Kennedy model which is like say it's hybrid prices you can without cracking a smile.

[13:16] Like I'd swung back a little bit more to like well let's just make them smile at how blown away they are with the value that we have and then they're more likely to tell their friends more likely to stay longer and then like I wildly underestimate how.

[13:30] How much word of mouth affects these businesses like some of you guys have probably bought.

[13:36] Coaching courses and what up because a friend of yours was like I went through his YouTube training was actually really good.

[13:41] And then that guy doesn't know that you were told that he just sees an ad and he sees a conversion and he's like oh my ads are killing it.

[13:48] But it's not that it's because the product really good and so like in the early days of gym lunch we got a hundred to one return on advertising.

[13:54] It wasn't because my ads are exceptional is because everybody who's going through was just printing money.

[13:59] And so like that's the that's the the big shift and those are the guys you make the most money.

[14:04] So once you actually have a pretty good profit in the second clip we talk about pricing and I talk about pricing a lot because pricing has the strongest lever on profit more than getting more customers more than even retaining them longer.

[14:15] Nailing pricing will make you more money than any other skill.

[14:18] I have a question of the pricing because I did you know the what you said the charge as high of a price.

[14:23] And I tried to increase it but I didn't follow the principle of only increase the price after sufficiently increasing value.

[14:28] Yeah, I noticed the people are much more likely to ask for a refund at the heart of price.

[14:33] Before the 70 seven a month now is one for the seven.

[14:35] Should I suggest going down to 87 which is still bigger than the previous price or is that a huge price change.

[14:42] Okay.

[14:43] Yeah, just 77 and 137 is not like a math.

[14:45] I mean it's a there's something in me a jump in terms of conversion or like rather a drop in conversions.

[14:51] But the all all you're optimizing for is conversion rate times L T B.

[14:57] That's like that's the whole equation.

[15:00] So we talked about the four levers in this business right like you've got traffic you've got conversion.

[15:04] You've got price and you've got turn like there's the four levers.

[15:07] So like to grow the business you have to increase well decrease turn but increase the other three right.

[15:13] And so if you know that let's see you've got a hundred clicks to a page.

[15:17] Let's say at 77 you convert twice as many customers.

[15:20] Well it comes down to really just like what's your earning for eyeball.

[15:23] And in the affiliate world is called EPCs which is earning for click.

[15:26] And so you just literally want to make the most money per click over the longest period of time.

[15:30] And so now if the 77 converts at twice the percentage of the one 37 and they turn at half the rate then over when you do that a hypothetical max calculation.

[15:40] You'll be like you literally all of this is just math.

[15:43] You just plot the see what it looks like see where max is out see what the other max is out at and you're like okay that's the price.

[15:49] So how would I do that if I'm sending people straight from YouTube to about page one school.

[15:54] You look at what it's at when 137 or whatever and then you know you know what your metrics were at 77 right and so you just compare what's the true so you look here.

[16:03] Let's do the math.

[16:04] So let's say you've got 77 bucks.

[16:07] That's a seven.

[16:09] All right there.

[16:10] And what was turned on 77?

[16:12] Well I don't have the exact numbers so that's another issue obviously.

[16:16] Yeah, okay.

[16:17] Like let's just walk through it hypothetically.

[16:19] Like give me a month average would stay people.

[16:21] Okay so that would be 33% sure right.

[16:24] And so you divide that by that.

[16:25] I've got bad numbers because I started it.

[16:27] Let's find two months ago.

[16:28] Two, you're fine, Dormat.

[16:29] One for the seven's probably like two months only.

[16:31] Okay, cool.

[16:32] All right.

[16:35] So 137 divided by 50% turn means you just double 137 right and see you've got what does that?

[16:42] 200 and 70.

[16:45] Four is LTV here and then here you've got what's that about at times three?

[16:51] Two for the one.

[16:52] Two for the one.

[16:54] Thank you.

[16:55] Two for the one.

[16:56] Two for the one.

[16:58] Two for the one.

[17:00] Okay, cool.

[17:01] So LTV here is bigger than here.

[17:03] But then the question comes into conversion right which happens before this.

[17:07] So then you're like all right.

[17:10] What percentage of clicks do I convert here?

[17:12] We're percentage of clicks do I convert here.

[17:14] And so because someone do two 74 divided by 231.

[17:20] Four, one point 186.

[17:23] One point 186.

[17:25] Yeah.

[17:26] Right.

[17:27] And then 20% more on this one than this one.

[17:30] This makes you more money.

[17:32] So make sense.

[17:33] Yeah.

[17:34] I would attract that if I'm sending people.

[17:35] You probably took straight to school about.

[17:37] We've got to just use some like fancy guess work.

[17:40] You should have got a feel of like when you were making a video.

[17:46] I went for it.

[17:47] I'm going to link how many kind of members joined.

[17:50] Yeah.

[17:51] Okay.

[17:52] And do you know if there was a big drop or if it kind of stayed the same?

[17:55] I mean it did a role probably wasn't decreased but not you know more than 20% of the work.

[18:00] Well 20% might be hard to feel.

[18:02] Yeah.

[18:03] Because it'd be like one day you get four or one day you get five like that might be tough to feel.

[18:07] But I know that that metric's coming out soon anyways for us.

[18:11] So once as soon as that conversion metrics on there.

[18:13] I've already looked at it by the way.

[18:15] Like like conversion rates across the platform.

[18:18] There's the biggest indicators the price of this thing.

[18:21] Yeah.

[18:22] I mean some free groups convert it 80%.

[18:25] But the difference between you know something that's like 10, 20, 30.

[18:35] Those things can convert like five percent.

[18:38] But once you get a price that's like over 100 it drops significantly.

[18:44] Yeah.

[18:45] Yeah.

[18:46] And so here we know what each of these is worth.

[18:50] And so you're just thinking what percentage of people buy it.

[18:52] And that's the conversion.

[18:54] And so if 50% more people buy this then you're like okay.

[18:58] Well then 50% even I'm making 50% more sales at this price versus I mean this is just a classic like chart of pricing versus volume.

[19:08] That's all it is.

[19:09] I really want to make sure it makes sense though.

[19:12] Yeah.

[19:13] Okay.

[19:14] This is how you figure out price it.

[19:15] And I would just encourage you guys to be willing to test.

[19:18] Like the PC who just sold profit well.

[19:22] They did this big meta study but basically the more frequently you analyze price the more profitable your company is.

[19:29] Just it's like a direct correlation.

[19:31] So companies that never look at their price and never adjust their price are way less profitable than ones that look at it anyway,

[19:36] which are less profitable than ones that look it quarterly.

[19:38] So just be willing to test price.

[19:40] I got some questions for you though like which one do you think is making you more money on your traffic?

[19:45] Because your traffic is probably remaining somewhat a constant right?

[19:49] Well I'm not pushing as hard as during the school games.

[19:51] You know I was selling every video and I don't want to do that for long term brand.

[19:55] So it's hard to compare but I would say it's more like the optics of being less than 100 a month.

[20:00] It feels like different you know than over 100 a month.

[20:04] So it's trying to think it was more efficient.

[20:06] Probably 7 to 7 because it's like I feel like the product has more but more aligned with the value there.

[20:12] But your audience is younger on the same.

[20:14] No.

[20:15] 25 to 60.

[20:17] Well I'll tell you personally we have a portfolio company that we ran.

[20:21] This is like this you guys might find this really interesting.

[20:24] Hey guys if you want to be in this room it's actually free for all these people because they won the school games.

[20:29] And so school is a community platform and helps you build a group and a community that you can monetize online or that you can build for free.

[20:35] And so we give you the tools we give you the training and we give you the community so that you can actually recreate that.

[20:41] And as of right now 54.1% of people who start a pay commute on school make at least one dollar.

[20:47] And so I say that because the first dollar business is the hardest one to make because there's so many skills that required to get there.

[20:54] And we've been obsessing about this for the last five years to make it as easy as you can possibly.

[21:00] If you want to start for free you can go check it out.

[21:02] And if you want to ask me a question I on board all the new customers every single Monday.

[21:07] So sign up start for free and I'll see you next Monday.

[21:10] It's school.com for slash games.

[21:12] So we ran we ran a high ticket upsell and we tested 50k 35k 25k and 15k wildly different price points.

[21:22] I'm just a mid I love the shit.

[21:24] And so it was really interesting is that the good version of the time basically the revenue we generated from all four of those was identical.

[21:31] And so on one hand you might think oh why rather just have fewer customers at 50k dollars.

[21:40] But for me personally I would rather have more people that I can again what's my value price discrepancy.

[21:46] As provided the cost of goods is not like you know like I don't want to eat into crazy margins or something but provide the marginal you know all the services are still pretty good.

[21:55] I'd rather have four times the customers to then sell keep and then also have a crazy like in terms of word of mouth from those people saying that my things unbelievable.

[22:05] That makes sense.

[22:06] Do you know what I'm not just like high ticket you can like change your price and conversion doesn't move but with the lower ticket it really does.

[22:15] Which I think it's because it's more intimate like when you buy something that's real high ticket you're it's small and you're talking to a human and everything but when it's lower ticket.

[22:23] It does seem to make a big difference.

[22:26] Because I had to get fundamentally if you believe you're going to get this big expensive outcome then logically in 25k and 35k like if you go and make a billion dollar business they're both worth it.

[22:39] It just like comes down to whether you can actually afford the you know the difference.

[22:44] It comes like a structural conversion difference where what I mean by that is like some people literally can't afford the difference between you know 15k versus 50k like there's just some people just literally can afford it even they both might want to buy it.

[22:57] Be a hear your you're selling it in a you're allowed it's like you with your finger over the button you're like.

[23:03] I mean my fear is that if I decrease it to 87 I would piss off all the people that joined at 1 for the 7.

[23:09] Yeah so like how would you like does the price done.

[23:12] Well the worst cases they could cancel and come back.

[23:16] Not the end of the world because so just it just for everybody like just for a perspective.

[23:21] Um taking if you plan on having the business for a long time then it's not going to make any difference.

[23:26] Like you're figuring out the right price point is for your community is going to be the thing that matters most.

[23:30] And so like you might lose a month like you're turning already at whatever 50% they're going to be gone into months anyways.

[23:35] Yeah so like I'm just being like really real right so like you we want to tweak this stuff to right.

[23:41] By the way, yeah like that's way above the real straight aim for it.

[23:44] I just price point below 20% yeah.

[23:47] Okay.

[23:48] Like good is but look good is like in between 5 and 10.

[23:53] Yeah like 20% is.

[23:57] Like average is it yeah because I actually I actually analyzed.

[24:00] Yeah.

[24:01] I actually put the whole platforms numbers into profit well.

[24:03] Oh, certainly.

[24:04] Yeah.

[24:05] It took profit well for like 7 days to process it and it almost broke it.

[24:10] Um because it's like 50 transactions a second or more.

[24:15] But it's like yeah that that's probably around the average or what's interesting is it's coming down in real life.

[24:23] Because I think people are learning more about what works and what doesn't work.

[24:28] Um but the good ones are sub 10.

[24:31] But so if you're 50 that price is too high.

[24:34] I don't have data to be honest.

[24:36] Yeah.

[24:37] Yeah.

[24:38] And I'll just do it if you just if you have like 4 hours and some coffee.

[24:42] Yeah.

[24:43] So like good.

[24:44] Like you turn members and it'll click on them membership and it'll tell you their out TV.

[24:48] We calculate it on a home in Believall.

[24:51] So just go and fill out your own spreadsheet.

[24:54] Yeah.

[24:55] And you'll figure it out.

[24:56] Like it's the numbers of the air that's why I see you just have to use some.

[25:00] Some different.

[25:01] Okay.

[25:02] And for the like general churn should I just export like the list of all members and compare

[25:07] it out to like week to week or something.

[25:08] No, no, you want to look at your churn members will tell you their out TV.

[25:12] So you want to see all of your churn members and their out TVs and then look at the average

[25:17] LTV.

[25:18] That's your out TV.

[25:19] From there you can reverse engineer your churn.

[25:22] Yeah.

[25:23] Because out TV would be divided by your price.

[25:26] That gives you your you can do the man.

[25:28] Yeah.

[25:29] Yeah.

[25:30] Okay.

[25:31] That answers it.

[25:32] Cool.

[25:33] Awesome.

[25:34] Well, this is great.

[25:35] I'm going to have to well, unprasing too and we're saying a gym lodge.

[25:37] I do believe I could sell what I built for 30 K.

[25:40] Like I believe I sell it for 30 K whatever, but I also do a painting business.

[25:44] That's why it is my main focus.

[25:45] And I also willing to sell it same thing for 97.

[25:48] So just to go.

[25:49] This is what my advice to you would be because I understand your business outside of this business.

[25:54] I think that I would try and I would want it to be just high fit high enough of a price that they care.

[26:00] And so maybe make it 5,000 year.

[26:03] Maybe 10,000, but the whole purpose is not to make what I mean sure you'll make money doing that.

[26:08] But the real money is that if you can get those people to then open your version of painting under your logo.

[26:15] And basically you can consolidate.

[26:17] I'd have them use your systems and whatnot.

[26:19] Then it's like they kind of basically become partners of yours as they open up locations underneath of your flag.

[26:24] And if you have the capital then you can front I'm sure the capital's not too big for starting painting stuff.

[26:30] I would have I mean do you know I mean it's like 27 net.

[26:32] You can afford it.

[26:34] So like I would be like off from the capital you can get 20% and I'll give you a base and then I'll show you how to run the business or whatever.

[26:41] And like you're going to be a co-owner.

[26:43] Like that's I think that might be the mega play for you.

[26:46] And then you can still use that to have that have to get any game.

[26:49] And you take that community and skim from the top.

[26:52] So it's like you let that like you don't need to take you don't need to bet on them.

[26:56] You let them you hold try outs.

[26:59] You know I put the pull pull sticks in and just see who kills each other and wins the leader board.

[27:03] And I'll bet you if your leader board was about who is the who's the next one who's going to be able to partner with you.

[27:08] But you're the board we got we'll.

[27:10] Take the hook spin.

[27:14] Cool.

[27:15] So you got what you needed to do.

[27:17] I was.

[27:18] Yeah, sure.

[27:19] You had that one that one equation from version rate times LTV was there like that equals to it.

[27:26] Conversion rate.

[27:28] Where?

[27:29] Yeah, you wrote it on the I think you flipped it over on the other page.

[27:32] Oh traffic trunk.

[27:33] Bottom.

[27:34] I don't believe that that's where it was.

[27:36] But I don't know if you said that you finished the equation.

[27:39] Oh for the these guys at the top.

[27:42] Yeah, I don't know if you're just talking about that.

[27:44] That's the price divided by Trenik was LTV.

[27:47] Oh, that's that's what this is.

[27:49] And then traffic times conversion.

[27:51] This is the other two of this is then you've got price.

[27:55] As your levers and then you have a turn.

[27:59] So these are the four levers of the business that we're talking about.

[28:04] So if you want to make more money in your community, you either have to drive more traffic to it.

[28:09] You have to convert a higher percentage of that traffic.

[28:11] You have to price it as high as you can.

[28:13] And you and this is all balanced with.

[28:16] Turn.

[28:18] Which is okay. Well, I can raise my price but does that also increase turn and by how much?

[28:23] And so that's why we're fighting like it's balanced between these two.

[28:27] And price also affects conversion.

[28:30] So there's a bidirectional relationship between Tren, price and conversion.

[28:34] And then this is this is the machine.

[28:36] Right, this is your business machine.

[28:38] Right, this is the machine that we have at school.

[28:41] This is what you drive into it.

[28:43] Which is the traffic.

[28:45] So this is the effort that you guys are doing on a railer basis.

[28:47] This is the inputs into the like this is the big black box of making money.

[28:50] This is school.

[28:51] And then this is what we're driving traffic, whether it's Facebook ads or whether that's content or direct outreach or whatever it is.

[28:57] This then just flows into the machine.

[29:00] You're looking for the maximum like yield.

[29:03] Yeah.

[29:04] So like how much dollars per click and way.

[29:08] Right.

[29:09] And all of these variables play into that.

[29:11] And you're looking for like the most efficient way to turn the click into some money in.

[29:16] Yeah.

[29:17] Couldn't you just put that in school like this metric, you know, and just get that number.

[29:22] So we see it because you have all the stats.

[29:24] No.

[29:27] We're trying.

[29:28] Yeah, I mean like, yeah, I can calculate that.

[29:30] It's like if we had that, you know, if you go into the dashboard, you can see the MRR.

[29:34] If we could see that right underneath or maybe like, you know, the Tren, so we can see it in real time.

[29:38] Because it's easy to see increases in MRR, but like this takes more than that.

[29:42] Yeah, it's a good point.

[29:43] Like I, you, the the next kind of metric we're rolling out is like the traffic and conversion stats that helps.

[29:50] Because now you can see your conversion and your clicks, right?

[29:53] I'm already have that data.

[29:54] I've already looked at it.

[29:55] That's why it's some insight.

[29:57] And then we've already got the Tren data to.

[30:01] So I guess that would be an interesting formula.

[30:04] It would be like EPC earnings per click.

[30:07] I think yeah.

[30:08] They could be a cool thing to see.

[30:11] And then.

[30:14] Yeah, good idea.

[30:17] And this next clip we talk about beating your competition by doing things differently than them.

[30:22] And how do I identify a great market and other great opportunities?

[30:26] And how to approach them in a way that other people aren't saying.

[30:29] If you're on school, especially in like the last couple of months, you probably noticed that there's a lot of really good value there.

[30:33] But it was, it was getting stuffy.

[30:35] There wasn't a whole lot of like,

[30:38] personability.

[30:39] All right.

[30:40] Or fun, so to speak.

[30:41] So it was an obvious niche.

[30:43] And it kind of happened organically where the offer was solid.

[30:49] Final builder is stuff like this.

[30:50] Different business model though instead of it being a high ticket, all of the front and we give you the package and then fuck off.

[30:56] This one was, hey, we'll work with you.

[30:58] And you just give us a subscription.

[31:00] And that's awesome.

[31:01] And so it's a nine, nine, what's the price?

[31:04] Nine, nine.

[31:05] Okay.

[31:06] Cool.

[31:07] And so we started with what you guys were talking about, free and high ticket.

[31:12] Two groups, two groups.

[31:13] Okay.

[31:14] Yeah, this is a recurring theme.

[31:16] But it keeps going.

[31:17] Okay.

[31:18] So where was traffic coming from?

[31:20] Just school.

[31:21] Okay.

[31:22] So this day we've never made a single.

[31:23] Nothing.

[31:24] Not even close to the ground.

[31:25] My friends don't know that this is going on.

[31:27] No one else.

[31:28] Yeah.

[31:29] They're you guys.

[31:30] Okay.

[31:31] God.

[31:32] So traffic was going to free group, right?

[31:33] Yeah.

[31:34] Traffic was going to free.

[31:35] So the school games for a page would bring people to paid.

[31:38] So we had a link there.

[31:39] It said, here's the free.

[31:40] Okay.

[31:41] Interesting.

[31:42] Because that's where a lot of people were coming.

[31:44] So it's actually kind of like this.

[31:46] Yeah.

[31:47] Yeah.

[31:48] Anybody have a simpler one?

[31:49] Yeah.

[31:50] Yeah.

[31:51] I said I was going to switch what's up.

[31:52] Like 15 people, eight bought within the first hour.

[31:54] Okay.

[31:55] And so everyone's like, who the hell is this guy?

[31:58] And then from that it sort of was a nice flywheel.

[32:01] And the pre-sell you did inside of the free group.

[32:03] Yeah.

[32:04] Actually, it was friends, family members, basically anybody that had something that we could offer.

[32:09] Was it a zoom like?

[32:10] I just do like a zoom.

[32:11] I was like in person phone calls.

[32:13] Okay.

[32:14] People in the world.

[32:15] People in the world.

[32:16] People in the world.

[32:17] Yeah.

[32:18] Get the floor.

[32:19] I'm feeling the baby.

[32:20] Okay.

[32:21] So that was what got it going.

[32:22] Yeah.

[32:23] But then from that point on, what we were doing was sharing, I mean,

[32:28] Sam doesn't like this phrase, but you know what, what's the kind of what they're

[32:31] doing?

[32:32] I think it's a valuable post.

[32:33] Something that had it in there.

[32:34] I wouldn't call it what you were doing a value post.

[32:37] I think this industry's got real weird with value post.

[32:43] Do you know what I mean?

[32:45] It's like people posting value, but no one cares.

[32:49] Because it's not even value.

[32:50] It's just some bullshit opinion or article in line.

[32:53] What goes differently is he made things fun.

[33:00] And got other people to contribute on his post.

[33:04] So his posts blew up way more than value posts.

[33:07] There was like hundreds of comments.

[33:10] And they were really fun and like alive.

[33:13] And so he bought like personality fun and like.

[33:19] But I would say personality and fun posts.

[33:22] And that those were like crashing.

[33:25] A lot of people engaged.

[33:26] And then a lot of people like who is this guy?

[33:28] And they've used his profile.

[33:29] Then they saw his stuff.

[33:30] Then he got on the lead boards and now he's got another thing feeding him.

[33:34] And then he got on discovery and now there's another thing.

[33:37] So by making things fun and adding some personality and being interesting and not just trying

[33:43] to like post articles.

[33:47] You everyone kind of started to know who he was and then that energy started going there.

[33:52] And then it started looping on itself.

[33:54] There was like a feedback loop.

[33:56] It was really interesting to see that happen honestly.

[33:58] Yeah.

[33:59] And it'll probably start happening more and more.

[34:01] It's their gift group is the next one.

[34:03] So we're starting to see this new pattern actually with funny things a work and really well.

[34:08] The sky made a group.

[34:09] It's a pure joke.

[34:11] When you get to level 9 you get kicked out.

[34:13] Yeah.

[34:14] Yeah.

[34:15] It's really funny.

[34:18] Like see how it's see what that does to everyone and to let you know.

[34:22] Every all of these serious business owners with seven figure businesses are joining and just laughing.

[34:28] Yeah.

[34:29] And posting funny shit and like I love that.

[34:33] I think there's there's definitely something that we had topic we could talk about today about community culture.

[34:39] Yeah.

[34:40] Because I think that's how you get retention.

[34:42] And that's how you get raven fans.

[34:45] As if it's there's a culture and a vibe to it.

[34:48] And that's starting to happen and work.

[34:51] Honestly more effective than the logic that I'm seeing really start to take off is quite interesting.

[34:58] That's probably how I define it.

[34:59] Yeah.

[35:00] It entertains your business in other words too.

[35:02] I think what's goose really great is making posts that are really engaging.

[35:07] Like I even again, plant you of seven figure business owners.

[35:11] I just like like to make it fun.

[35:14] So just like you're think that's you grow.

[35:17] Like know the value post just like the pose of the driving engagement.

[35:20] And to make people like collaborate.

[35:22] Who's just huge.

[35:23] There's a theory that I have behind it that actually is something that people can probably start to use.

[35:31] Because it's kind of I didn't realize it until I was looking in retrospect.

[35:34] But it's something that I call broccoli wrapped in bacon where it looks really stupid and fun.

[35:40] So you're curious about it.

[35:41] But by the time you're done reading you actually learn something.

[35:44] So each one of my posts take like 45 minutes to an hour to make.

[35:47] Because sometimes I have the funny part or I have the broccoli part.

[35:52] But I have to come up with the other part.

[35:54] And so what we started to find in this system was right after you got eyeballs.

[36:00] And as long as you had a good offer, you immediately could just start sharing all of your successes.

[36:06] Everything at work, everything at didn't work.

[36:08] We're even how you felt that day if it was somehow valuable.

[36:11] But not a value post to suppose.

[36:13] And the engagement went through the roof.

[36:17] And this is what it meant, which might help a lot of people that are here.

[36:20] Is one of the reasons we didn't go back and start offering up ads is because at least I was nervous a little bit about the dilution of the quality of the people.

[36:30] Because they were all coming from school.

[36:32] And those people knew how school worked and we're really fucking engaged.

[36:36] And so we have, I don't know, 600 members something like this.

[36:39] But we're more engaged than groups with 10,000 members.

[36:42] A lot of them.

[36:43] And every time something goes off, like let's say it's someone struggling with,

[36:47] I don't know, a heartbreak of some kind.

[36:50] A bunch of community members just swarm on this dude and help them out.

[36:54] And it was that culture as Sam was talking about that we somehow stumbled into and realized,

[37:00] Okay, this is this massive thing.

[37:02] It's not just like kind of an issue.

[37:04] Totally an issue.

[37:05] Adressing sort of the personality, the things that you might need from a friend.

[37:10] And then that was why people were signing up for everything else.

[37:14] They just wanted to be able to do that and run their business in like a safe space.

[37:18] So there's something to be said.

[37:21] I suppose about being able to reach out to the things that don't logically make sense.

[37:29] And that was what we ended up doing there.

[37:31] So as you said, in conclusion, the discovery ended up being that backbone where probably a lot of us

[37:39] should maybe lean on a little bit more.

[37:41] If you can get that slightly higher, the number of people that are coming to school all the time

[37:46] is just rise and everyone's looking like if you've got one offer here,

[37:50] you've got another one over there that you can just jump over the same person.

[37:53] It's just a bunch of really high quality leads and people that are waiting to jump onto those.

[38:00] I may not have much for you to chew on there.

[38:03] No, no, that was fine.

[38:04] That was much to share.

[38:05] So is the first one we've seen that didn't really use external.

[38:09] Yeah.

[38:10] Yeah.

[38:11] I mean, I know Evelyn, I mean, she obviously did drive outside traffic,

[38:15] which she crushes internally as well.

[38:17] Because she is truly valuable posts and a lot of her posts like the differences.

[38:22] So for everybody at home, I feel like the difference between the value post and the quote value post

[38:28] and the quote value post and the valuable post is that the quote value posts are like,

[38:33] here's six things to know and gives a shit, right?

[38:37] The valuable posts are like, I did work for you, or I took risk for you,

[38:43] or I spent money for you that you don't have to spend.

[38:47] And so fundamentally, it's a bargain on time or money.

[38:50] And so like Evelyn's like, hey, I spent $25,000 on ads and these are the ads that I ran.

[38:55] And this is what happened.

[38:56] Like, oh, shit, well, great. I don't have to do that.

[38:59] And this work for her, like, she gives her TLDR at the end and you're like, that was valuable.

[39:04] Yes, if you can get a blend of that and then people making like a parody video about the community,

[39:09] like if you've seen the ones people have made the skill.

[39:12] If you can get a good balance of that, that I would say is like perfection.

[39:16] Because you've got the value, but you're also smiling and feel like a part of this group.

[39:22] And then you're like, I can't believe I'm having fun and I'm talking to people that make millions of dollars.

[39:27] If you get those to, it's slight.

[39:30] It's experience and results.

[39:32] So on the customer's success side, like in normal B2B businesses, we talk about both.

[39:36] It's like, you can get someone results and there's also client experience, which is like the soft and the hard.

[39:42] And believe it out, like, client experience matters, sometimes a lot more than even the results does.

[39:47] But if you have amazing results at a terrible experience,

[39:50] the moment they can find somebody else who can get them the result they will leave.

[39:54] But if you have an amazing experience in like mediocre results, they're like, well, I love these guys.

[39:58] And those days.

[40:00] Yeah, so one of the the tweaks that we ended up kind of noticing is that we, on school, it's so great.

[40:06] It's community.

[40:07] We actually don't really have the post as a thing or what we do.

[40:11] We really turn it back into that.

[40:13] So the community is the community.

[40:15] And we really highlight that, that there's just being like the overlord and be like, here's what we give you guys.

[40:19] So it's like, no, more and more in the comments comments, DM, that was the thing that really just gets super fat.

[40:26] Do you guys think I'm assuming you guys engage a lot in your community, right?

[40:30] I think that's like, most people could do it like in terms of the people at home or like, my community is dead.

[40:36] And it's because you're expecting like the community to do the work and in the beginning, like, you need to drum it up like you need to engage.

[40:42] You need to be thoughtful about your responses to comments and things like that.

[40:46] There are small things that are really nuanced.

[40:48] I mean, school understands it really well because it uses the platform, but like if you're making a post and you're not using a poll, you're fucking out.

[40:56] There's something that you can do that just adds a little bit of flavor to what you're doing.

[41:01] There's also like, we were talking about earlier, pinning to module, like every little thing that school has.

[41:08] If you're not using it, you're kind of even money on the table because there's usually a lot of thought that's gone behind the scenes for that thing.

[41:15] And I'd even go as far as saying that, you know, we have this free-to-paid system, but probably what's going to start emerging a lot more here is what we did, where there was a lot of drop-off where people wanted to hire us from the free, but they didn't have a grand ready to go, or they didn't have their offer ready to shoot.

[41:31] So they would fall to a low ticket, which was just like a white label GFL, GHL.

[41:36] But we ended up inverting it because people were like, what the hell does this software do?

[41:41] And you had to go and explain the whole damn thing.

[41:43] Instead, we just sold the mastermind later on and then gave them this as a gift, like hey, and you also have the software.

[41:49] And then it just went through the roof where people kept signing up.

[41:52] So inevitably we got free, low ticket, high ticket, and it's just been wonderful, happy in that.

[41:58] And it's just this flywheel where people bounce around within it.

[42:01] Of course, that gift of the software that gives them the incentive to go up.

[42:05] I want you to just do this for me. Now I know it's here, so.

[42:09] So I guess they've got the extra piece on the end of that simple funnel.

[42:13] They've got free, low ticket, and high ticket.

[42:18] Which sounds like it's what everyone eventually wants to achieve from what we've heard at all of these events.

[42:23] But just balancing the traffic source, the free and the paid first, is probably everyone's first it.

[42:29] In this fourth clip, we talk about something that I made tons of mistakes on early.

[42:32] Either you've got entrepreneurs who are really getting retaining customers and don't know how to get them or they're really getting marketing and sales and don't know how to keep them.

[42:38] If you're one of those people who's really getting marketing sales and doesn't have to keep them, this is all about making sure that they stay with you.

[42:44] And I'll tell you now, as an investor, the number one thing that I look at in business is how many people from last year still paying you.

[42:50] It gets way easier to grow when you don't lose 100% of your customers every year. That's a promise.

[42:55] Well, we want to talk about engagement. We did it. I've just been weeks analyzing this.

[43:00] And what I found was honestly shocking.

[43:04] But...

[43:05] That's a no.

[43:06] Yeah.

[43:07] Video M.

[43:08] So, what's really interesting is classroom content doesn't really matter.

[43:16] First of all, you do not need to make a monster course.

[43:20] In fact, that just overwhelms everyone.

[43:22] We even owe it.

[43:23] Or, it's less than an hour.

[43:25] Yeah.

[43:26] Anime shreds launched with no classroom and no post more than one sentence.

[43:32] My post was just like six emojis.

[43:37] And there's thousands of comments.

[43:40] So, the things that really work I've seen in that a very low-f, low-f, low-f, too, is

[43:51] that you get your community to share something about themselves.

[43:57] So, because I've seen these posts that always rip really well.

[44:02] They get more comments than a well-thought-out article post by the creator who penned it.

[44:09] So, that's like, you know, one that always works is like, what's your favourite book.

[44:16] Have you ever seen that one just keep popping up in your communities?

[44:19] Even if some random asks it, it just keeps getting comments.

[44:22] And if you've seen this, that one, because it's just asking me,

[44:25] and Mr. Shea, something about themselves.

[44:27] And then other people are curious.

[44:29] What's your favourite movie?

[44:31] If you want even the most simple one, what's your favourite gift?

[44:35] Got one, that one's by who it.

[44:37] That one just guaranteed, like, more comments than anything else.

[44:42] And it's kind of a little bit more fun.

[44:44] It's not too much, if it to think about.

[44:48] Or, this one I've found is really good.

[44:52] It's like, share three things you do.

[44:58] Share something you do for fun, where you're from,

[45:02] and a photo of your workspace.

[45:05] Right? Because people want to share.

[45:07] And so they're like, okay, I'll take a photo of my desk and workspace.

[45:10] I'm from Germany, and I like to play golf.

[45:14] Right? That's just sharing themselves.

[45:17] And they do a comment to a post like that.

[45:19] And then everyone looks at the image and they know the other things.

[45:22] They're like, oh, you've got this desk, or you're into the guitar.

[45:25] I also play guitar. And now they're making friends.

[45:27] You're connecting the community together.

[45:29] Like, we actually do use that one.

[45:31] And of course, when we tell people, if you see someone's introduction post with that,

[45:35] comment a gift as well, and it works amazingly.

[45:38] And it's like the culture of the gift that it possibly is for Wall Street.

[45:41] Like, gift from their post.

[45:43] Now everyone will start putting them in.

[45:45] Yeah. And so these, this I swear is the key to light.

[45:49] Because when someone comes in, they're all, you just need a simple way for them to engage.

[45:53] And once they're engaged, and if they meet someone,

[45:56] they're like, if now they meet someone they're on DMs,

[45:59] and then that moves to like,

[46:01] hang out and real life for them.

[46:03] So they associate that value back to your group.

[46:07] Right?

[46:08] I just add something as well.

[46:09] Helen? Can I just add something?

[46:10] Yeah, go for it.

[46:11] Yeah. So if you want people to engage,

[46:13] you can do like all these like little tricks.

[46:15] We can just tell them to engage as well.

[46:17] So like what we've done is we've just like indoctrinated people to engage with each other.

[46:21] Essentially, right? Like in a good way though.

[46:23] So we talked about the print, the mastermind principle from Think and Grow Rich,

[46:26] we explained it to people and I said,

[46:27] this is why you should engage with each other.

[46:29] And then now everyone's just hosting calls with each other,

[46:31] communicating like that kind of thing.

[46:33] So sometimes you see to tell people, it's the same with the Q&A recordings as well.

[46:37] Just tell people to watch them, give them a reason and like tell a story.

[46:41] And that makes them want to watch it and then they'll watch it.

[46:43] So it just works with anything.

[46:45] It's just sometimes you just have to add tell them why they shouldn't do it.

[46:47] Yeah, this is huge. Like especially on the Q&A course.

[46:50] People sometimes have a question like,

[46:52] does anybody here know blah blah blah?

[46:53] And if there's like, for the people and there's 600 in the community,

[46:56] we're like, well, have you made a post?

[46:58] And always know. So we like make a post.

[47:00] We'll put it maybe if it's good one.

[47:02] And like just telling people that they can make a post.

[47:04] They almost feel like they don't have the permission when they join the community.

[47:07] But like know, you can make a post.

[47:08] You can make a post. You can ask if somebody here knows this or does that.

[47:12] And just doing that, especially if something more advanced that you can't

[47:15] let answer in five minutes, I think that's huge.

[47:18] Yeah, that's done.

[47:20] That's good for like the regular conversation.

[47:22] I think you need to imagine a blend of like sometimes you need to share like

[47:26] something you did like you need to always pay attention to problems your community has.

[47:31] And you as the lady, it's your job to like find the best solution.

[47:36] And you can kind of crowd source it, but sometimes if to go and explore your on your own.

[47:40] And then you find it and you bring it back and you share it.

[47:43] You're like, hey, we found we know this is a problem.

[47:46] We did this. We found the solution and here it is.

[47:49] That that's like good leadership.

[47:52] Then you need, but you need some fun stuff in there for sure.

[47:56] I'm honestly shocked at how much of a difference it makes if you have it.

[47:59] It honestly would go as far as saying it's more important than the value.

[48:03] Like because I've seen seven figure people join groups that are purely for entertainment.

[48:09] But with other seven figure people, so it's like the value happens as an accident.

[48:15] And members contributing.

[48:19] Like I think one of the most common problems I've seen is people say,

[48:23] I've got members in my community.

[48:25] I'm posting five times a day, but no one's commenting.

[48:30] Right? That if you're seeing the people say that.

[48:34] Yeah. And it's because the people that have engaged communities aren't posting five times a day.

[48:39] They members are commenting.

[48:41] It's a difference. And when you ride an article this long that's just an opinion piece, what is someone supposed to say?

[48:49] Like really like.

[48:51] And you're putting a burden on them to read that fucking thing.

[48:54] Like who wants to read that?

[48:56] Another follow-up you can do to get more engagement too is

[48:59] I like to never answer anything in the comments.

[49:02] I always ask questions.

[49:03] So everything gets answered with a question which follows a bread for every person.

[49:08] And and you get the research you get to find out those problems you can.

[49:11] Yeah, asking a question.

[49:13] It's just that always works so well.

[49:15] It's crazy.

[49:16] Yeah.

[49:17] I think a really good idea too is if you have something that's like a community review.

[49:22] Like for example, we have music money.

[49:24] And a lot of we tell a lot of the artists that post their new music.

[49:27] Post their new beats.

[49:28] And then the community members will review.

[49:30] Like, oh, I think you should tweak this.

[49:31] I think you should tweak that.

[49:32] And then we have another community where it's mainly about like content.

[49:35] Making good content.

[49:36] And people will post their content or post it.

[49:38] Link to their content is almost like.

[49:40] I don't know if you guys remember like the engagement groups.

[49:42] Like back in the day where like they'll post it and everybody goes and comments and likes on their post on Instagram.

[49:47] And that increased a lot more engaged in around the community too.

[49:50] Absolutely. And just one more thing to add on to that.

[49:52] Like I think people under us to me like.

[49:54] How well information travels in the form of a mean, right?

[49:57] Like a mean can communicate like a 45 minute video worth of information to the right person.

[50:03] Right. If they're a sponge and can soak the information out of it.

[50:06] And so I just think like on the recipe like the video's Ryan Post, right?

[50:09] Or like something like that.

[50:10] I'm like, oh, that's funny.

[50:11] Did you see the fast and furious?

[50:12] I was dying.

[50:13] I watched it like 100 times.

[50:15] Yeah.

[50:16] So like I think people just under us to me like,

[50:19] All right, like, you know, like what goose does is like, you know,

[50:21] you make it fun to read a post. I think I mean just like suck your eye in.

[50:25] And so it's like if you can figure out how to communicate something through a meme, then you're killing it.

[50:29] And yeah, I just watched this movie last night.

[50:32] It's really good.

[50:33] Dumb money.

[50:34] Anyone see that?

[50:35] It's about the GME game stop, the hedge funds.

[50:40] And it's a Wall Street bet farm.

[50:44] They have a rate.

[50:45] They had a very good culture.

[50:47] You know, they invented diamond hands and like they were making memes.

[50:50] They were making memes of like the Wall Street bet's head,

[50:53] spanking the hedge fund.

[50:54] Like, you know, and everyone just felt like they were in this David Vuskalayath like thing.

[51:00] And they were all part of something.

[51:02] And that's the most powerful thing you can get as when you get that culture there.

[51:07] I think school community in the last month has finally found something.

[51:12] There's like this culture because people are contributing these parody videos.

[51:16] That must have taken them a long time if you've seen the Harry Potter one.

[51:19] I made the friends one.

[51:21] It took me like four hours.

[51:23] Yeah, Harry Potter one must have taken a dough down.

[51:25] Wait.

[51:26] It's sensitive.

[51:27] You've seen the Harry Potter one, right?

[51:29] Yeah.

[51:30] Um, I see the mood of Moisey too.

[51:34] But the power like referencing that done money thing.

[51:37] That guy just tweeted out a picture just the other day of a game of a dude leaning up to play games and game stop.

[51:43] Game stop stock, shot up again from dude just tweeting a picture, right?

[51:47] Just like no words attached.

[51:49] You know the people are like, oh, it's back on.

[51:51] I need to you know, bind to this game stop.

[51:53] And so that's what the power of a movie.

[51:55] You've got to watch this movie right at down.

[51:58] Don't worry.

[51:59] Not only is it amazing movie just for straight entertainment, but this guy who led that game stop thing is probably one of the best community leaders with ever seen on the internet.

[52:08] Because he bought down some hedge funds.

[52:11] Yeah.

[52:13] And I'm free.

[52:15] He was with me.

[52:16] He was with me.

[52:17] He was a promise in the world to people either.

[52:20] First he wasn't telling people, game stop was going to go up 100 X.

[52:23] He was saying this is going to go up four or five X.

[52:25] And I feel like that's another thing people can do is not over promise.

[52:28] Whenever and then people are like, yes, I believe it can do what you're saying.

[52:31] It's going to do.

[52:32] And then everybody believes in it.

[52:34] You know, yeah.

[52:36] Yeah, that is perfect.

[52:38] Exactly what happened in that movie.

[52:40] And that's what we're starting to see happen in school like people of making these parody videos.

[52:44] And then people would laugh.

[52:47] And then we started seeing people posting like, this is the most positive place I've ever seen on the internet.

[52:55] Like that's pretty powerful.

[52:58] So people want to go with the energy's good.

[53:00] Right?

[53:01] Like if you scroll your Instagram and you feel bad and you go to Facebook, bad, Twitter, World War or something.

[53:07] Then you go to like, you know, you go to school and there's some funny videos and someone making a million dollars.

[53:13] That is the ultimate, right?

[53:16] Like people winning and people laughing.

[53:19] Yeah.

[53:20] We've seen two outstanding ways that you can drive culture, especially if you're trying to pivot.

[53:25] One of them is categories.

[53:27] It's super passive.

[53:28] This like the thing that's right above your feed, where you can sort of when someone comes in, they get a pretty good idea.

[53:34] This is actually Sam's idea.

[53:36] They get a good idea of what the place is for.

[53:39] So even if you don't actively use them, it's just kind of a good found in the movie.

[53:42] It's just kind of a good foundation.

[53:43] We've got a lot of good feedback back from that.

[53:45] Even though I hated them at first, they're super useful.

[53:47] And like a level one sort of way.

[53:50] And then the more important one is your pin post.

[53:53] Does anyone rotate their post?

[53:54] Actually, I don't miss you for you.

[53:56] Did you?

[53:57] Yeah.

[53:58] All right.

[53:59] Close the first thing I have a song.

[54:00] Who's this dude, Long hair?

[54:01] I coach your post and he's like rotate two pin posts a day.

[54:05] I do that with myself and I do that with Justin as well.

[54:09] Awesome.

[54:10] You're going to do it with your post.

[54:11] It's over power rush.

[54:12] And so how long until you saw results?

[54:14] I've immediately awesome.

[54:16] Yeah.

[54:17] Okay.

[54:18] You rotate pin posts and my favorite thing is when you see people typing.

[54:21] Yeah.

[54:22] Everyone's like, what are they typing about?

[54:24] Yeah.

[54:25] So what we did with them is exactly this.

[54:27] The pin post.

[54:28] When you first start a community, your first thought is, oh, I need the start here.

[54:34] So that everyone knew it was exactly where to go, which actually kind of fucks you after a little while.

[54:39] The people that are coming back, seeing the same shit every single time they come back.

[54:43] And so you kind of want to speak to them more.

[54:46] So you post the pin of the start here post in a classroom module or whatever you need in the start here classroom.

[54:54] And then the pin posts are just the stuff that's going on day to day.

[54:57] You got a crazy idea or if you can't post the day, you take one of your community members and you post them up there.

[55:02] And they're fucking jazzed to be pin.

[55:04] Oh yeah.

[55:05] If you pin your members stuff, that's key, I think.

[55:09] You should always aim to have at least one or two.

[55:12] The ultimate is all of the pin posts from other people that aren't you.

[55:16] It just shows the community that if they, they, it is possible for them to make something the.

[55:22] You're willing to pin at the top.

[55:24] And then it, it, it, it's like creating this in the center for people to do that.

[55:30] And the other thing I would say is you should always be just sensing it on the lookout for who are the most valuable contributors are in your group or in your community.

[55:42] So like, you know, when ghosts, when ghosts kind of started to take off.

[55:49] I see them to me and I see now that you've proven yourself, school hard core.

[55:55] Like, what do you think of this upcoming feature?

[55:58] Right.

[55:59] So I started to bring him in and give him like access way more access to me.

[56:04] And, and then, you know, he's been at the office all week.

[56:08] Helping design screens for the next three months.

[56:12] That's true.

[56:13] So, I mean Ted Carr, who's hosting a school meetup right now in LA with a hundred people.

[56:19] Here's a key to our office.

[56:22] So he can just, he and the alarm pin coach.

[56:26] He can just rock up whenever he wants.

[56:28] And we just talk about sensitive things in front of him.

[56:31] It's like he's a member of our team.

[56:33] But what I'm trying to say here is when you see those people, you need to reward them.

[56:40] Because all a group needs to keep it engaged.

[56:43] Even when it's big is 10 true, regulars people like.

[56:47] It's like a sitcom, right?

[56:49] Like, how many people watch friends, but it's just like five people, right?

[56:54] And it's those people that get everyone else to come because they like the vibe and they like it.

[56:59] So, you know, we've got people like Ted, we've got people like Goose,

[57:04] There's Max Posen, There's Evelyn, right?

[57:08] Well, them contributed different peace.

[57:10] This Ryan Guy with Gif is adding a new kind of flavour.

[57:13] Kirby was adding something.

[57:15] Now he's on the team.

[57:16] Matthew was adding something.

[57:17] Now he's in charge of our podcast.

[57:19] And so, and there's a lot more people.

[57:22] But you've got to find those, when you do see those people, you need to like do something to make them feel like they're a part of the leadership in a way of the community.

[57:36] What I did is I hired one of the best guys to do a week-lick-all.

[57:40] So I just pay him 100 bucks and he does want to be a click-all.

[57:43] So he's like a professional software engineer.

[57:45] And he just helps if like the technical questions.

[57:48] So he was already posting a bunch, but I asked him how he do want this.

[57:51] Because he already was attending every single call.

[57:53] So might as well get 100 bucks for it.

[57:55] And literally, for 400 dollars a month, I get like a professional software developer that just hosts a weekly call in my community.

[58:02] Yeah, this is how you find your team, by the way.

[58:04] Like, honestly, everyone we've hired that's on the non-suffering engineering side is from school.

[58:11] Users like, when someone applies, I look, I'm like, where's the link?

[58:15] And I look at their activity chat.

[58:16] And I'm like, this person doesn't use school.

[58:18] Like, if they don't care about a school, I don't want to hire them.

[58:21] So like, if someone literally cares about your community and is contributing without getting paid,

[58:27] then they're going to obviously believe in what you're doing.

[58:31] All right, with this exchange in topics from engagement, which I don't know if we should do it,

[58:36] but that is how you find great people.

[58:38] Yeah, I want to hit on one thing with engagement.

[58:40] So we've tossed around the word culture, and we have been to find the word culture.

[58:44] And so I'll just share mine that might be helpful.

[58:47] Which is the rules that govern the reward and punishment and organization.

[58:51] And so if you think like we have either spoken rules or unspoken rules, but there are rules of how you act.

[58:56] And so if you're with your buddies, if you say, hey, I got my girlfriend flowers, they just might all of a sudden say,

[59:00] like, oh, he likes talking dick too.

[59:02] You know, like, okay, that's the rule of behavior, right?

[59:05] Like, if you do something that's nice for your wife or girlfriend, you're going to get made fun of.

[59:09] But it's because they like you.

[59:11] Right? And so, but like, if you said that to your parents or your, you know, whatever the dinner table,

[59:15] then we go like, oh, that's really sweeter. That's really nice of you.

[59:18] Right? And so it's different rules.

[59:20] So there's a different culture at the family dinner table, then there is one year out with your buddies.

[59:24] And so fundamentally trying to define what are the rules that govern what gets rewarded and what gets punished within my community will dictate what the quote culture is within it.

[59:35] And so just kind of thinking about that in terms of those terms, we'll probably make it a lot easier.

[59:39] And so to your point, goose, I actually think this is the category speedest that you're saying.

[59:43] Really, really important. And the main reason I say that is because, like, if people are about to make a post, when you see what the categories are, this signals or this tells them,

[59:52] this is what we want you to post about.

[59:54] And so this is like, this is an, an innate rule to this community. Like, we want you to post about wins.

[59:59] We want to approach that traffic, when you approach about monetization, when you post about whatever.

[60:02] So it might be like, you might have like gifts. Like, they'll imagine the community, like, same identical community,

[60:08] internet marketing, right, just something like completely generic. And the categories in one are gifts, memes.

[60:16] Right, like something that makes money, like money making, wins, and just for kicks, right.

[60:23] And so like, that is one community. And the other one is conversion rate, value posts, question, whatever, right.

[60:32] And so when you see the two of those, like, you have a very different feel for those communities before you even engage.

[60:38] And so like right off the bat, that's the, that's the banner.

[60:41] Literally, that the subcategory of all the topics that are going to get discussed.

[60:45] And so like, if you want to shift the conversation that's going to happen within the culture of, or within the, within the community that you have,

[60:52] telling them what you want them to talk about with the categories feels like one of the most important things that you can do to do that.

[60:58] And you also buy, by very nature of having those topics means these are what we reward.

[61:03] Yeah, and what we actually did is we like gamified the categories as well.

[61:07] So when it's like, I think Sam did it with like, so in calm, you see, maybe people like ring the bell.

[61:12] So we got like a clip from a game like a GTA 5 where Travis has shown me the money.

[61:17] And every time someone gets a win, they post that, we're having a calling a wins category for her, her, her, her, her, show me the money.

[61:22] And every time they go, I win, they post it. And it would just make it way more responsive.

[61:26] Everyone would come and show up with the money every time someone gets a win and they just goes insane.

[61:30] Yeah, and you can have it be wins or you can have it.

[61:32] Somebody be funny the way you have it. It's still cops to say, but one of them is like, I'm, I'm more inclined to post this if I don't feel like I'm flexing.

[61:39] You know what I mean?

[61:40] So yeah, I think this was like a, I like put double star that personally.

[61:44] And then I think that the pinning your members feels very important.

[61:48] Like I think about like what's, that's like a jackpot reward.

[61:51] Like this is what we reward in general.

[61:53] And if you pin, pin certain posts, then that's a super reward.

[61:57] This is like, let me, let me put this guy on the literal pedestal and tell everyone in my community, this is what I want you to do.

[62:03] This is me, they do a big reward for somebody who does this.

[62:06] And so it orientes the behavior of everyone in the community.

[62:10] And then I would say what I do is like, pinning is probably the first, for saying this is a great post.

[62:15] So this is amazing, right? That's key.

[62:17] Like you see me, do this, I do it all the time.

[62:20] And then I just tell people, then pinning them but also sending them a DM,

[62:25] and then the only people I DM are the people that are like the most school hard core, basically.

[62:31] And that I talk to them all the time.

[62:33] And then the next level of hard cores every now and then will be on zone.

[62:38] And then the next level is, they'll be at the office, right?

[62:41] It's literally what I do, not by design or deliberately.

[62:44] This is just how it happened.

[62:46] happen, but bring those people closer and give them more.

[62:50] Because by the way, they also give me the best feedback.

[62:55] They're helping design school, literally.

[63:00] And you can use them to help you shape the future of the thing you're building.

[63:05] And when a new member comes in and they see that you're really tight with members like

[63:11] that, they're going to be like, oh, shit.

[63:13] If I can get my way up there, I can have that too.

[63:18] Do you get what I'm saying?

[63:19] If you do this, it'll work.

[63:22] It'll work really well.

[63:24] And it's not exhausting at all.

[63:25] They're just the least exhausting business I've ever run.

[63:29] Because they don't have to talk to anyone like everyone.

[63:32] There's no, I'm never promising that.

[63:33] I only talk to the people who I think, who I want to talk to, really.

[63:40] Yeah.

[63:41] There's a point a few days ago that school games community was really dead.

[63:45] No one was posted.

[63:46] I was like, fuck, I'm going to get fired.

[63:48] All I did was I added a category called Banta.

[63:51] And I message Ryan, who's the gift guy, who's top of the school community.

[63:54] And I said, made this for you.

[63:56] And immediately he made a post.

[63:57] There's 300 comments in like two hours from one post.

[64:01] And also on the reward punishment thing.

[64:03] Whenever Evelyn posts every single time she posts, I'll comment Evelyn over delivers a

[64:08] gift.

[64:09] Just like reinforced the good behavior.

[64:10] And the DMs are probably sent 10 a day.

[64:12] It's ever a good comment.

[64:13] I DM and I'm like, this was a great comment.

[64:16] That was a great post.

[64:17] And then bad behavior, if someone posts bad stuff, don't like it.

[64:21] Message them and say, his or her rules, his or her bad post looks like reward good.

[64:26] Here's her bad post of like, your post.

[64:32] See screenshot.

[64:35] I got a quick tactic that's been like working wonders for our culture.

[64:39] I have all my guys when they join and put like in their bio and school, I put like a 15-minute

[64:43] counterlink.

[64:44] And then I'm like always referencing it.

[64:45] So I'm like, I mentioned like, hey guys, like book the 15s, I put it on my roadmap, I have

[64:49] like a little roadmap, like book three 15s with these guys.

[64:52] And I'm doing all the closing right now.

[64:53] So like, I'll like go on my live calls.

[64:55] I'll notice that two guys who are across the country from show, have so much in common.

[64:58] And I like reach out to them like, yo, you should book a guy with, I feel like you should

[65:00] book a call with this guy.

[65:02] Because of why, XYZ.

[65:03] And then I follow up with that later like had that call go.

[65:06] And then I get a ton of like insight on like all my members and like what they're communicating

[65:10] outside of me.

[65:11] Because like, there's like a little like, like a power dynamic.

[65:13] Like I'm like, thumb the head coach, I'm like the CEO guy right.

[65:16] So I don't get like a lot of like vulnerability.

[65:17] But I can get the insight from my community members through each other.

[65:20] And the concept actually came from when I was a threat president because we would have our top

[65:24] 10 exec guys go on constant 15 minute lunch breaks with all the new members.

[65:28] And then that's how we collected mass information and connected guys like pledges together

[65:31] before the recruitment process.

[65:33] So they would have friends before they even joined the thing.

[65:36] And so like the result of that is like I have like buddies like flying down to like Dallas

[65:39] to meet gliders who I didn't even like like the do the other on the own.

[65:43] Because the reward is so high they're getting like brothers.

[65:46] So I'm gonna say back to you.

[65:48] So the users in the community, you sell them to put like a calorie link for 15 minutes.

[65:52] So and then whenever you see people that you think make sense and they already, it becomes

[65:56] an innate rule of the community which is like, hey, if you like someone just like click

[65:59] they're like in book a call.

[66:01] They might just segment out you know one part of their calendar where they have you know

[66:04] opening to just banter whatever maybe they do for their lunch breaks and they meet new

[66:07] people every day.

[66:08] Yeah.

[66:09] I thought like an I do like an hour for three days a week.

[66:11] That's just open.

[66:12] Yeah.

[66:13] And it crushes.

[66:14] So a lot of people do use that.

[66:16] Almost.

[66:17] Yeah.

[66:18] So I tested it with like five or six guys and they're all they all loved it.

[66:19] And so I'm making a mandatory for everybody now.

[66:21] Who's just like the man?

[66:22] He's in the map.

[66:23] The map.

[66:24] It's not a school feature.

[66:27] This this right.

[66:28] Are you using it?

[66:29] They have members meeting up constantly in person that they've met through music

[66:33] money and doing like studio sessions and stuff and that's honestly like like you

[66:36] guys said like they they equate that their connection to being a part of music money.

[66:41] And so I feel like they you know people I just saw the school beams pop up but they

[66:45] just people just share their location.

[66:47] Who's in Atlanta?

[66:48] Who's in his in Detroit?

[66:49] You know.

[66:50] He was interesting.

[66:51] I was in I'm in Ham's this group and he to the power.

[66:55] Just like what's the most valuable part of the community and he's trying to remove some

[67:00] stuff and and the emphasize some stuff.

[67:02] And what could we what's one simple thing we could do to improve it.

[67:05] I was the most common answer was get more people to plot the location on the map.

[67:13] I was like what we actually took that idea just a little bit further.

[67:18] We're not sure if it'll work yet but it's incredibly popular.

[67:20] It's been our most popular piece so far.

[67:23] Which was setting up a system that the community could engage on so that it continued

[67:29] that fly wheels sort of perpetually.

[67:31] And what we're calling it is it's it's based off the school games and we're just

[67:35] caught at Rambo games and we just have a pile of things at the end that you can win.

[67:41] And the structure is you'll be a sign teams between three to five you have one team

[67:47] captain they coordinate with our community manager and the objective is to compete

[67:54] based off of three metrics where they are on the leaderboard from and these are

[68:00] all based on a 30 day time span so it'll basically one to one of the school games where

[68:04] where they are on the leaderboard what their own personal score is on how much they've

[68:10] grown in their own relationships and health.

[68:14] And then the last one is how good their offer is based off of where they started from

[68:18] before.

[68:19] So using those three different metrics people were super jazzed about it and we

[68:22] had I think like 30 signups to do this thing that will probably do this next week.

[68:28] We don't know all the little intricate details but I think there's a massive opportunity

[68:32] there whereas previously like when you're starting probably most of us have run into this

[68:37] you really want to get a few community managers to like lift up from the bottom and help

[68:42] comment and stir up conversation but at a certain point when it's feeding itself you can sort

[68:47] of just give that momentum by doing top down where they are in teams or some form of competition

[68:54] and reporting to the community manager.

[68:56] So now the managers are doing less time but having more impact.

[69:01] Yeah and the more you reward the top members versus trying to dig up the bottom members.

[69:07] Those top members dig up the bottom members.

[69:09] You know it actually is less like your model.

[69:12] Yeah and it could be some super stupid.

[69:14] We the biggest request that we've had recently is I designed a few profile pictures because

[69:19] I wanted more color in their thing.

[69:21] So I was like all right if you're on the leaderboard I'll go ahead and do it.

[69:23] And now it's one of the things that we offer in there because people really want it.

[69:27] And it's silly and it's.

[69:28] And then you guys design a whole suite of gifts for school.

[69:31] Yeah.

[69:32] Yeah.

[69:33] Yeah.

[69:34] Yeah.

[69:35] I got it.

[69:36] Yeah.

[69:38] Maybe a suite like level six unlock.

[69:41] Like if you get to level six I'll make your profile thing for you.

[69:44] Or one more question for you.

[69:46] And just for the context right you said if you go back in time make gym lunch 10k a year.

[69:50] So I'm kind of in this new building phase of like I'm I'm going to make my product 10k a year.

[69:55] Honestly go big headlamp out of it.

[69:56] So like what we're like the two to three like specific things that you would like definitely implement into gym lunches model back then.

[70:02] Like with your knowledge now to actually make people like renew your year.

[70:06] Okay.

[70:07] I got to figure out where my time comes from because this is something that I wanted to talk about.

[70:10] So well we what everyone in my opinion what you want to do and school's going to very quickly be able to facilitate this.

[70:16] Some really excited about that.

[70:18] You have one time value.

[70:21] And then you have ongoing slash consumer way.

[70:25] All right.

[70:26] And I think the big issue, my opinion.

[70:29] In the information slash education space.

[70:32] Is that we try we have one we have one thing here that we try to build for both.

[70:37] And so we're like okay well I can get some to say yes to thirty thousand dollars whatever.

[70:42] And because they can't pay that today I'm going to spread it over a year.

[70:45] And I'm going to deliver all the one time value upfront.

[70:49] And then they're still making payments of twenty five thousand you know twenty five hundred dollars a month.

[70:53] Uh, month three month four five hundred six.

[70:55] But the problem is the value.

[70:59] So I think about like this.

[71:02] Value is going like this.

[71:06] But this is price.

[71:09] And this is where people cancel.

[71:13] Value.

[71:16] And so when you when you sell them initially.

[71:20] They're like twenty five hundred bucks which is my first payment.

[71:23] Look at the difference between price and value.

[71:25] So I'm stoked this is great.

[71:27] But the day after you learn how to run Facebook ads when you buy something to learn Facebook ads.

[71:31] The value of the content teaching your Facebook ads descends to zero.

[71:35] There's no additional value right.

[71:37] And so this is why in my opinion this is where I think the industry should go or will go and or if I started over again this is what I would do is.

[71:45] You have one time value that you need to be really clear about so this is a lot of times this is going to be the education.

[71:50] Right.

[71:51] This is this is the entirety of this right.

[71:53] This is the education that jack was the tools the blue prints the whatever right now this usually has a lot of value.

[71:59] Because you're teaching someone something a skill that's very important and they're going to have that skill forever.

[72:03] It's one time payment for an ongoing permanent value increase for them.

[72:07] But all this stuff.

[72:09] So you've got community right people consume that on a monthly basis.

[72:13] There's calls right that they consume on a monthly basis.

[72:17] For us like for example we did a boiler room which is something that we did for gyms which was we would train their sales staff.

[72:24] And so we would drill them every day so we basically run their sales meeting for them every morning to increase the clothes rights at the jet.

[72:30] They didn't want to do it nor were they good at it.

[72:32] If we could increase the clothes or the gym they'd make more money that's day right it's consumable.

[72:36] We had ads which for us was consumable because I would spend 50 grand a month.

[72:43] I would test ads and like 10 representative markets I would take the winners and then I would give I would license those winners to a thousand locations.

[72:49] So there's zero cost and that besides the 50 k and then everything after that was great.

[72:53] And so that was why I was such a high profit margin business.

[72:56] We're still it.

[72:57] And so the idea here is if you put on a sheet what's the one time value that I deliver and then what's the ongoing value?

[73:05] And if you were to only do this only price this in a way that most people were like wow just these things alone are worth x.

[73:12] This becomes your ongoing price and this becomes your upfront.

[73:21] And so that is the concept of big headline tale but what you want to do is you want to make sure that what is being built on a regular basis that is ongoing value is ongoing value.

[73:30] The things that you build one time are one time value.

[73:34] And so then you can create that described so rather so it's probably for most of these quote you know the coaching education businesses instead of saying okay I'm going to sell you something for 30 thousand dollars is twenty five hundred dollars a month.

[73:45] It might be it's 10 k for and then five hundred dollars a month.

[73:49] But then no one cancels right.

[73:52] And so then you just play with how do I look good eight you know cost to acquire.

[73:56] And the thing is this is where the patience of like if I did this all over again like the the business model that gets fast is to twenty million.

[74:03] And that's really the only that it's fast is to a hundred million.

[74:06] Because you might have this price the old pricing model which skyrock is to twenty million a year or whatever.

[74:12] But then like you have a really hard time passing because turns starts eating away you and so you're like shoot I need to sell more things somewhere but it's really tough especially in an inch to sell more right.

[74:21] Whereas if you're not losing the customers then the first year you do you know eight the next year you do.

[74:26] But you add another eight on top of your 16 30 or 24 like oh actually by your three I'm a little bit above what the other one was but the first one you're at 20 and you think you're hot shit because you're beating the other guy who's lower ticket.

[74:37] Right but you're four all of a sudden this guy's now 32 and you're still stuck at 20 questioning your life and everybody hates you right but this guy's like man the price to value for my stuff is through the roof.

[74:47] And when you want to sell something else you have this massive distribution of people who love you and your brand your reputation are all great because you delivered something really valuable and you charge for it and then you live something let's be honest less valuable but then you charge appropriately.

[75:04] So my sense yeah so this allows you to have basically price here price.

[75:12] And then it drops to here for your ongoing.

[75:19] And so you still always have the delta.

[75:24] This is how I think about.

[75:26] Yeah.

[75:27] But super helpful I never had the discrepancy between the one time in the ongoing value I would try to bunch the ongoing with the six k ticket price but now I'm going to go.

[75:34] And so one thing I think is again a mistake that most people make I mean myself include I made this mistake.

[75:40] I think it's the best is how most people do this and in this business is they take it and they spread the payments over a year some arbitrary about a time.

[75:48] I would rather say like I want to be very clear you're paying this for this and that for that.

[75:53] And so if you need a payment plan we're going to front like it's not spreading over a year like you need to pay this office fast as possible because that's what you're paying for and I'm maybe doing you a favor like I'll split pay it all three pay it or whatever.

[76:03] And that might mean that the ticket price like and here's the funny thing is that everyone here knows this who's in the high ticket world you sell something for thirty thousand dollars you're not collecting 30.

[76:14] You collect however many payments your turn is times.

[76:17] It's like okay yeah but we turn at twenty five percent a month and we're at our price points twenty five hundred bucks so really it's 10 k.

[76:24] That's what you're actually making so whatever you claim versus what you make or two very different things and so if that's really what you're making then maybe you just charge seven.

[76:32] And you get way more people to say that because the thing is when you have a thirty k price point you still have to make the thirty k sale.

[76:38] But you're not even collecting 30 it's like the worst of both it's like you have a lower conversion because the price is high but you're not even collecting on the low conversion.

[76:45] And so it's like sell it seven maybe and then let's say that turn on the five hundred is.

[76:51] I don't know but I have a four percent right and so now of a sudden it's twenty five to you're getting twenty five months at five hundred so you get twelve five on the back.

[76:59] Seven on the front now you're at nineteen five and LTV and because you charge seven at front instead of trying to confront.

[77:06] A thirty k price point you might sell two or three times as many and now your EPCs go up six acts because you had you trip you doubled LTV but you might also.

[77:15] One and a half acts conversion or double conversions now you four acts.

[77:19] EPCs in terms of you are earnings per click or your conversion what each each person is worth to you.

[77:24] This is in my opinion the better way to run the business most people just don't do it and maybe.

[77:29] In five years we'll find this video and.

[77:32] Is that what made Jim wants to sell a bull.

[77:35] No, I made Jim want to sell a bull was that.

[77:38] I did nothing in it and it was very consistent.

[77:41] And we had multiple forms of acquisition and so I had to basically paint the picture which was that.

[77:46] Did you know that thirty percent of Jim's got a business every year and they're like I didn't know that and I was like right so.

[77:52] No matter what structurally a third of Jim's got a business because it's a tough business in general and so the good news of that also is that.

[78:00] Every year another thirty percent enter the market and so we can stay at this place and we can sell all the new Jim's that come in and that means that this business will just.

[78:07] You know continue to maintain and then the opportunity for growth is going to come from you know some of the other things that I had already like played at seats for that we're going to be down the line to increase.

[78:16] Great.

[78:17] As well as that's beautiful and that's like exactly what I did so thank you.

[78:20] I'm ready to like go home and work as so.

[78:22] Yeah.

[78:23] So you guys.

[78:24] For real.

[78:25] Yeah, I was glad to thank you.

[78:26] Because with the coaching business you answered my question that I've been asking for like six months.

[78:31] What does the end go to be?

[78:32] Yeah.

[78:33] You've been asking me for six months?

[78:34] No, not you.

[78:35] Second year.

[78:36] I have to ask you every single.

[78:38] Every story post.

[78:40] Yeah.

[78:41] Oh good.

[78:42] Okay.

[78:43] Great.

[78:44] Talk about how to build a community within any business and every single business has a community that just have bad ones and good ones but every business has one.

[78:51] And so if you're doing it the bad way there's done existent.

[78:54] The second worst way is when it's just dependent on you having a relationship with every single customer.

[78:59] The idea way is that every one of these customers has a relationship with one another so that if your.

[79:05] Break with them breaks they still stick because they've got five other connections to other people in the community and that.

[79:11] Break things the bond that's what creates a network within a community and then it will always be bigger than you because one person can only have so many relationships and that's what allows your business to go bigger than you.

[79:21] This is just how I would explain it's like each one of these people on the right.

[79:24] This is the traditional way that most people are doing it which is that they try and become more and more interesting that.

[79:30] They go to the model.

[79:31] That's literally guru model.

[79:33] Yeah, they're all just right it.

[79:36] Go to a model doesn't work well for community.

[79:39] By the way, if you just post it doesn't work and if everyone wants to talk to you you're going to be exhausted.

[79:45] Yeah.

[79:46] Yeah.

[79:47] And so I think about this for so like this is what it looks like visually and with your eyes you're going to most of me.

[79:52] Have you seen the difference but the point that I would highlight is look how many tie-ins.

[79:56] These people have to the community versus those people those people only have one tie.

[80:01] And so the likely like if this if this breaks right this breaks this guy leaves right he gets out.

[80:08] But if all of a sudden this breaks right he you know stop talking to that guy.

[80:12] He's not going anywhere right or this breaks like nothing happens.

[80:18] And so I think a lot of the things that we're talking about here are trying to get to this which is like we're talking about the maps.

[80:23] We're talking about the 15 minute thing.

[80:25] We're talking about encouraging the engagement between them.

[80:28] Like the whole point of all this stuff.

[80:31] Is to facilitate that.

[80:34] Like why do we want them to share things about themselves to take a picture of their car take a picture of their workspace or share themselves on the map?

[80:40] It's because then they can start orienting themselves with one another.

[80:44] Like that's how they connect with each other because they can find similar things.

[80:48] And so it's like how can we create a space that rewards them sharing things that they can find similarities?

[80:53] Because fundamentally they have a shared interest.

[80:55] But until they know the rules of engagement they're just going to be like okay why don't want to get punished for doing something.

[80:59] And so by having the categories by pinning exactly what you want people to do by DMing this people afterwards.

[81:05] Like those are all things that then encourage more and more of this which then creates this.

[81:11] And then this I'm actually really pumped that this is the direction that the conversation went in because in a past you know probably one or two ago we went really deep on retention right.

[81:22] And so there's lots of like what I would consider like the hard science stuff of retaining the community.

[81:26] And I'm glad that groups you're here for like to basically have the other side of the conversation of retention in the community which is the whole experience right and what are the rules of how this community works and what do we reward what do we punish.

[81:37] And I think like I'll bet that the people are watching this and probably you guys too you might be able to cut your turn even more by doing this stuff.

[81:48] Somebody at a hand yeah shoot yeah I have two kind of questions.

[81:53] How do because I resonate with this a lot.

[81:56] How do you go from guru like once you already are operating on the right side.

[82:02] How then would you go to the lab you don't decrease you you increase them.

[82:06] That's good yeah okay that answers that the second one is.

[82:11] Okay how do you so because I think a lot of the conversation is pre-framing so I used to work for a lady.

[82:19] She had 4,500 members and then what she would tell them is if you cancel you can never come back for a year.

[82:26] Right which was awesome because people would never leave like a decrease turn and then the second thing was they would have requirements like for them to do.

[82:37] Like what are you thoughts on that.

[82:39] I've seen the the you can't come back thing.

[82:42] Have zero effect in some businesses because they're like yeah I never want to come back anyways I don't really care.

[82:48] And so like it's like it's kind of one of those chicken egg things where like if you have a valuable community then people fear losing it and so.

[82:55] Then they don't want to cancel but at the same time if you've available community then you've already won and so doesn't matter.

[83:01] Okay just one more point.

[83:03] Yeah that question.

[83:04] Would you sell an outcome different than you would sell a community.

[83:08] Um I wish I could just sell a community.

[83:11] Yeah right people have a hard time describing value to community.

[83:15] I mean like in the gym world we used to say sell the bikini they come for the bikini they stay for the community.

[83:20] Um and like the way that you have the offer in terms of the outcome that they're going to have is going to be the thing that's going to bring them that.

[83:28] Right but then all of this is the stuff that's going to get them to stay and so I would say there's different objectives like to get someone to convert you talk with the outcome to get them to stay.

[83:37] They're going to like you they want to reward as many times as you can with that community and basically it's too arduous for one business owner to reward.

[83:45] Every single person as many times they possibly can to get someone to stick and it's so much easier to create the system that allows the culture that allows people to reward each other at a way higher frequency than you ever could as a guru.

[84:00] Cool.

[84:01] And I really want to like.

[84:03] Rally, what's the word?

[84:05] Emphasize like the leverage here on this left side like if you have a lot of client knowledge you can connect guys and it will exponentially increase your leverage on how valuable community is like.

[84:13] For example like just in right here like you should network I think you should network with other just and over there and maybe probably because you guys both have like this commercial construction experience right.

[84:22] I don't know anything about commercial construction because I know like one detail about that you guys can get like a quick 15 and then you'll like associate that connection with like the value of my community and that connection and build go like that.

[84:32] So like I can like almost like increase my leverage into like that construction space for example even though.

[84:37] I don't know much about it but it will add so much value to the community as a whole and it makes you guys level up too so it's like a win win.

[84:42] Yeah, this is huge. I actually sold a few people that way somebody asked me like if I have something on sales AI agents and I didn't so I searched up school and it's loaded up a few members that specialized in this so like if you joined today I'll connect you to XYZ who is doing exactly this and enjoy for that and then I connect them.

[85:03] You're bored about.

[85:06] It's incredible.

[85:08] No it's good.

[85:09] It's good.

[85:11] I feel like this is the visual like I feel like this is the main difference. Like this is what all the tactics that we were talking about earlier this is the end result of good culture.

[85:19] Like what happens is when community members start getting known like the leaders of the community kind of get jealous and they like remove them or like to punish them.

[85:27] So you need to work on your internal side as well and be comfortable with people leading your communities while for you deserve a sense.

[85:36] But we have champions side of the school. I mean, like all the all the names that Sam referenced earlier like you bring the people closer to you who you want to encourage and create distance for the ones who you don't want.

[85:51] Yeah, I literally never even think about that. Like we're building you guys up.

[85:57] Literally like we're trying to give you guys the fame and then.

[86:05] And then we do that the better the community is so like it.

[86:13] I don't what you're saying though. I had this realization all of a sudden.

[86:18] But yeah, the if you have that mindset you'll never have a good community because the moment there's someone that has anything good to say you're going to like kick them out.

[86:27] Yeah, I'm not saying I have I'm saying don't have it.

[86:29] Yeah, it might happen. It's kind of natural with humans.

[86:32] Kind of get jealous of you. It's going to be mindful of things that might be not what they don't align with your vision for the community like oh everyone.

[86:40] This thing is just way too complicated and I think this is a dumb idea.

[86:44] Even if people like it, I'm not a fan of this.

[86:48] It's not for a personal reason. I just it doesn't align with the vision of of the things you can't let it just go out of control.

[86:56] You have to shape it a little bit. But it comes in who you reward and who you pull closer and yeah.

[87:06] I mean when we we talked about this before even thinking like when we were coming with the idea of the school games overall was.

[87:12] We wanted to have as many like school games champ like it's the games like we want school games champions like that was the whole the whole point was to elevate it because.

[87:20] We're getting like already have the clap. You know what I mean? It's like our whole world still like get as many other people. So we have lots of things about this way is like you want to have as many different walks of life.

[87:30] And like avatars within the community that represents success.

[87:34] Like with it obviously with the you know the wide of the box the more buried the community the the champions can be. But like I would love to like this isn't planned.

[87:42] This just happens organically. But it's like I'm glad that Evelyn is a girl who's you know really really awesome inside of the community and there's also black guys and white guys and old.

[87:49] And white guys and older guys and yet like we have the grandmother who hit you know a million bucks like it shows that like anybody can do it.

[87:55] Obviously we're super super broad in terms of what we're looking at but even within the sub segment of whatever you sure you're going after you're going to have different psychographics of demographics that can be represented and that's that only increases the amount of people like this guy or this let's call this a lady right.

[88:11] These might be lady people right and then this might be a dude right and these might be dude people but if this person can't find connection and there's no no ties and then she leaves.

[88:22] Right so having different people that represent even kind of slightly different flavors like chocolate and caramel chocolate and coffee like it like you have you have chocolate is your community, but it's like different type different flavors of chocolate.

[88:35] Yeah, we can definitely see those circles and school community like the ads people yeah the like some people and there's the creator sky's all the like the YouTube is right then there's the there's definitely the girls and there's definitely I call them the chads.

[88:53] Like we call we joke around at that about that like oh that's the Chad network and then there's the like the boomers like for sure and by the way there's a massive population bigger than any other.

[89:10] The largest business that we have in portfolio.

[89:13] Frucious with hours.

[89:15] So I have a lot of spending.

[89:17] What was that?

[89:18] It's the largest generation in the world with the most money with the most and and spending power like you've got to sell to them.

[89:28] And yeah you can start to see these different things it makes the culture more interesting then I'd say the goose and gift people like.

[89:38] They were honestly for a period we were seeing post like how do I how to goose and like.

[89:45] Did you guys see all of these goose posts?

[89:48] It was like it goose was taking over at one point.

[89:53] And then when Ryan came in with GIF.

[89:55] I'm not shooting you the amount of they'll get few such on a cross out platforms bite so much that GIF eat call us.

[90:02] And said we needed to discuss a paid enterprise plan.

[90:06] And now we have to pay them a grand amount.

[90:09] Because we're using 500 terabytes.

[90:14] It's a testament to the culture.

[90:19] Yeah and it's like but then everyone saw that and they're like, Oh, I can use GIFs in my community.

[90:25] I can use polls.

[90:26] I can be more like goose and they're learning these different elements that they can play with.

[90:30] Yeah and their community.

[90:32] Yeah.

[90:33] The other one I'd say is calls calls is getting getting some the moment you take someone from just an avatar and some text to being on some.

[90:41] It's like a name you've got a voice.

[90:44] Now you can see a face now.

[90:45] There's some expressions and there's more depth.

[90:49] So if you're not doing calls, this is I'm sure everyone here's doing calls, but I beat you.

[90:54] There's people at home that are thinking they need to make a lot of classroom content.

[91:00] No, I swear all you need to do is have three posts that like introduce yourself and share a photo of your workspace.

[91:06] What's your favorite book? What's your favorite movie? What's your favorite GIF?

[91:10] There's four posts that easy and then one call on the calendar that could be just called coffee hour and there's no agenda.

[91:17] You just hang out on zoom while you have your morning coffee.

[91:20] Maybe once a week, three times a week, whatever.

[91:24] Done.

[91:26] Then let it happen first, right?

[91:28] And then you can figure out, OK, I'm going to make this a little module because this is what.

[91:32] Then you can start serving your community, but it has to be there before you know what they want.

[91:37] Right? And then you start serving and you keep adding things and curating and then it's more valuable.

[91:43] So now maybe you charge and now maybe you increase the price over time and do you see what I'm saying?

[91:49] Like that's all we need to start.

[91:51] We're actually going to hide the classroom tab when you create a new community.

[91:55] Hmm.

[91:56] Well, we looked at retention, making a course has no correlation to retaining as a customer.

[92:03] In fact, it's one of the reasons why people turn.

[92:06] Right?

[92:07] Because they say, I don't have the camera.

[92:10] I don't have a lighting setup.

[92:12] And I will come back when I've made my content.

[92:16] Yeah, no shit.

[92:19] So it has no correlation with retention.

[92:22] So we're like, OK, this is hide that tab and let's just get encouraged people to make a calendar and do three simple posts.

[92:28] And then bring people in down now the engagement setting.

[92:32] And then you learn you don't have to write article posts.

[92:36] You don't need to, this isn't sub-stack.

[92:39] Like you don't have to sit down and like invent these articles all the time.

[92:44] You're not a writer.

[92:46] You're, you're bringing people together.

[92:49] It's, it's a, there's a difference there.

[92:53] But it's very hard for people to grasp for some reason.

[92:57] There was something that you were mentioning before about.

[93:01] I'll take it to take it once a further.

[93:05] It, it's come up once, but a lot of times the offer that you have.

[93:11] No, this isn't for everybody, but it's quite easy for an offer to be hard to sell.

[93:16] And the person that needs it can't recognize it when they see it.

[93:19] But fundamentally, you can kind of always understand something like a mastermind or a coffee hour.

[93:25] And so if you sell that and you give them what they need, you almost always score.

[93:30] Like I think we have like 98% retention for across all of them just because we reversed everything.

[93:39] So that we're, we bring them in on what they want, but we give them what they need.

[93:43] And it, where it just works every time.

[93:45] And it's something that maybe you guys could, could also run with because it's, I mean, it's a showstopper for sure.

[93:52] And by that, you mean they come in for the funnels, they stay for the fun.

[93:55] No, they come in for the mastermind, they stay for the funnels.

[93:58] All right.

[93:59] Yeah, it's stickier.

[94:01] Yeah, we just started the other way.

[94:03] Yeah, that's just worked better.

[94:05] The fun is just kind of like a cherry on top, like it's, it's sort of, I mean, you'll see it and kind of like the captivate branding.

[94:11] I literally analyzed every little fucking pixel when I was like, how can I get more attention from one glance?

[94:17] And so it was colors, it was bizarreness, it was cussing, whatever it had to be, it was just like just be whatever it came naturally, not like forcefully.

[94:28] And then from that point, the fun was like a nice introduction and a good tone, sort of a good cultural tone,

[94:34] but everything else was just, yeah, trying to situate.

[94:37] And that was where our big roadblock was.

[94:39] And when we reversed that, like almost on accident, it completely changed everything else.

[94:44] How many people here are teaching someone how to make money or do something to do with business?

[94:49] What I think you'll find fascinating is that most people don't want to start a business.

[94:54] No, like really, I learned this after talking to big YouTubers, though like, oh, that now that it's a business and I was like, yeah, and I don't want that.

[95:05] So like, most people don't want a business.

[95:08] What they really want is they want to like feel good and have fun.

[95:12] Dead explains the whole world. How many people?

[95:16] How many people are at the fucking library?

[95:21] First of all, first of all, first of all,

[95:24] first of all, playing computer games, or like, you know, watching movies or like going to bars, right?

[95:31] Like, how much money gets spent on like going to bars and video games and everything versus everything else?

[95:40] It just shows you that it's what people want more than anything.

[95:45] But I think once you become an entrepreneur, it's even harder to see once you become a hardcore entrepreneur as you think everyone's kind of like you.

[95:52] But I can tell you most people aren't.

[95:55] Yeah, like, I mean, 9% of people have a business and that like that means literally like own an LLC.

[95:59] So that includes like hair stylists who are solo printers. So 9% so if you cut out solo printers and then just go people who have employees who are looking like one out of every, I don't know what the status, but I would imagine probably one out of every 50 people actually has a business with employees.

[96:16] Like, it's not a lot of people.

[96:19] This is why I think the fun element is really important because I've seen a lot of people say this.

[96:24] They were like, I never wanted to start a business or be an entrepreneur until I knew it could be fun, right?

[96:32] Like, it's, I think that's how you make the market bigger for sure.

[96:37] Like, if you want to get more people to buy your thing and all of that, I think a lot of it comes from not just more training or more like explaining or more like,

[96:48] logical concepts and frameworks. I think it's trying to make it more fun and interesting to people. Does that make sense?

[96:59] Yeah, that's why I was excited about these recent breakthroughs that we've had because it's it directly translates to the actual thing you want, which is retention, sales, would have mouth by the way, like all of the things that we dream of.

[97:15] But it comes from tapping into the slightly different thing.

[97:20] I love that we had classroom.

[97:22] I didn't. I think it's great I didn't.

[97:24] This next clip is about strategy, which is my fancy word for prioritization.

[97:29] Fundamentally, we all have a certain amount of time, money, effort, people that we can allocate across a million different things.

[97:36] And so the idea is the people who move the fastest in business make the best bets because they choose to allocate those resources to the things that get them the best resources.

[97:44] And this is how to pick which ones you should.

[97:47] So we were selling before we built the program.

[97:50] Okay. So as I'm actually using time to create the content and get the program out, there's less time to get more people in.

[97:56] So the revenue goes down as we're building. So how do you fix that?

[98:03] Thank you guys, partners.

[98:06] Do you get you're not solo, eh?

[98:10] Just split the responsibilities, maybe? Why don't you grow with one on building?

[98:16] There's a great way.

[98:18] Yeah, I'm glad to thank you.

[98:20] Oh, no, that's not.

[98:22] And also you're going to work a lot.

[98:24] So it's just a side note.

[98:25] You're just going to work a lot.

[98:26] Yeah, we work all day already.

[98:28] Yeah.

[98:29] So we also have one more person, Kirby, who does like community management.

[98:34] So we divided it even more. Like I'll just think about making it better.

[98:38] Kirby will run it operationally and homozy will bring people in.

[98:42] Do you see?

[98:43] Mm, that makes sense. So get like, it has to be more people if needed.

[98:46] If not, just split the work.

[98:48] Yeah, if revenue is going down because you're like, you.

[98:53] The point I was making earlier about the classroom thing is like, I would not watch you shoot over produce content for the classroom.

[98:59] Since the vast majority of people, they quote want to buy it, but they don't actually consume it.

[99:03] And they consume the community far more than they consume the content.

[99:06] And so I would like try and make it as paired down as you possibly can to increase the likelihood that they do consume it and get value.

[99:13] Because if they see a ton of videos, they just say like, nah.

[99:16] But if you say like, guys, the whole thing you can cover unless and two hours, then the likely that they're going to watch it goes well.

[99:23] So make sense.

[99:24] So I would just not kill yourself on it.

[99:26] Trying to think, what are the actual few things they need in order to be successful?

[99:30] Just make that so that you can still focus on basically keeping the business going.

[99:35] Yeah.

[99:36] Perfect. Thank you.

[99:37] How to revive a dead community, right?

[99:40] So whatever partners, they got in school very early on.

[99:43] And it just grew very massively before we had built out our infrastructure.

[99:47] They have 14,000 members.

[99:49] Just dead.

[99:50] Community is just dead.

[99:51] I think a lot of people on the school community haven't even been in there probably in weeks months.

[99:57] I think at one time there was a lot of like bots and stuff and we hadn't gotten that system in place.

[100:01] And that kind of probably wasn't good.

[100:03] And then see how to revive that community so it can be more of a nurture to the paid.

[100:07] So this is your free community.

[100:09] Into music money.

[100:12] Now this is, so yeah, we work with a lot.

[100:15] We have a bunch of different communities.

[100:17] Okay.

[100:18] This is one of our free communities called Kingdom Minds.

[100:20] Yeah.

[100:21] They have like 14,000 members and their paid community is doing well because we do webinars.

[100:25] And we just sell that.

[100:26] But the free community itself is just,

[100:28] No, it's not 95% of people are like at level one essentially.

[100:32] Like, you know, they may do an introduction and then that's all they ever do.

[100:35] So like, just, well, is there anything you guys have in mind like to bring that back to life?

[100:40] Yeah, it makes sense.

[100:41] Did you do the same thing that Zane did?

[100:43] Were like the people went into the free thing.

[100:44] You sold all the engaged people.

[100:45] No, and I think that's definitely part of it.

[100:47] But even the most engaged people in the free group of that one are the people from the pay group.

[100:51] They stayed over there and still were engaged.

[100:53] But it's like, we can't elicit more engagement out of people.

[100:56] They're like, oh, I want to join.

[100:57] You know, yeah, join, make a profile and then they're like, you know, yeah, we don't

[101:01] not to make it like a part of their everyday.

[101:03] And could we do anything?

[101:05] They've hurt.

[101:06] Yeah, I would like, you know, interest something exciting like a challenge or something that

[101:12] is going to get people excited.

[101:14] But why react? Why do you want to react?

[101:16] What do you mean?

[101:17] What do you mean?

[101:18] What does it mean?

[101:19] Well, it's just 14,000 members.

[101:20] I feel like there's a few boardcast posts in there and then move on.

[101:24] Do you post an image?

[101:26] So we have a school manager that's making posts in there.

[101:29] They cook posts.

[101:31] It's okay, posts, you know, about like content.

[101:33] Honestly, a lot of the game that we've gotten right now about like, you know,

[101:36] making it more funny and entertaining will definitely like, you know, have that.

[101:39] And there's been more value-based and more like, hey, we got a free training, which is the webinar.

[101:43] So it's probably a lot more CTA.

[101:44] What problem is the group solve?

[101:46] It's about social media, you know, like, why not not not not through them.

[101:51] Like, why does it exist for you as an upsell, as a funnel to go to the paid community?

[101:56] And to-

[101:57] Just the lead magnet.

[101:58] It's the lead magnet.

[101:59] Well, really the webinars.

[102:00] So here's the thing.

[102:01] So the webinar is the lead magnet, but we have a webhook that takes people to the free community.

[102:05] So people were just getting into the free community after the webinar.

[102:08] Webinar.

[102:09] So we don't even have their data on like phone numbers and stuff.

[102:11] So all we have is their email from school.

[102:13] If you just didn't have the free community, whatever things still work fine.

[102:16] Yeah.

[102:17] So maybe you just have a paid community.

[102:20] And you just run ads to your webinar, sell people in the paid community.

[102:24] Well, I think the only reason we'd want to get it better is just for discover, you know, be on the business.

[102:29] Yeah, one point we were at top 20.

[102:31] The community was top 20 because it was growing so fast.

[102:33] And then now it's like, I don't even know.

[102:34] It's like up there.

[102:35] So it's just kind of like, we have this a bunch of members in there.

[102:38] Like, I mean, we can deactivate it.

[102:40] Do you have any super users?

[102:42] No, yeah, they've already upgraded to paid members.

[102:45] Essentially, they're still over on the free community, but yeah, it's just, you know,

[102:48] our only point of really getting it back alive would be to get on the discoveries.

[102:53] I think, you know, overall.

[102:54] Like, raising engagement to get on the scary page would be the ultimate role.

[102:58] I want to add something when it comes to the posts.

[103:00] So you have a community manager, right?

[103:02] Hmm.

[103:03] Do they have their own accounts or do they use your accounts?

[103:05] They use the citizens in the group.

[103:08] Yeah, the owners account.

[103:09] Okay.

[103:10] It because if somebody else makes a post, but there are community manager,

[103:14] nobody will pay attention because people join because of you or the artist, right?

[103:18] So yeah.

[103:19] Great point.

[103:20] Yeah.

[103:21] I think if you're going to try and engage it, I think do it.

[103:23] Basically doing something exciting.

[103:25] That is valuable for those people.

[103:26] We'll get them to be excited.

[103:27] And then I would just, I would, I would balance that with Sam's question,

[103:31] which is like, why do you even bother?

[103:35] Well, if you do re-engage it, one thing that we did that was quite successful

[103:40] when we were doing the rainbow games thing was one requirement was you had to tag people

[103:45] that were less active than you.

[103:46] They would like to compete with it.

[103:48] And it was actually surprisingly, it was interesting.

[103:51] Sweet.

[103:52] Can you guys come up?

[103:54] Questions?

[103:55] Top and wine?

[103:56] I was always going to grab out of this bag of stuff.

[103:59] It was some that were interesting because all the ones left with pretty much covered it.

[104:04] At previous one.

[104:05] They were like standard topics.

[104:07] But there was some that were kind of unique this time around.

[104:10] Like.

[104:15] And I think this kind of relates somewhat to what you just said,

[104:18] which is what is the next lever to pull?

[104:22] It's like, because you know, there's a million things you could do.

[104:26] Like reactivate this dead community.

[104:28] But I swear your time would be better spent doing something else.

[104:32] But how do you find that next lever to pull?

[104:35] Yeah.

[104:36] So this is like, so that question fundamentally for everyone here.

[104:40] Like if you could walk away with that being correct would be in my opinion the most valuable thing that you can do to walk away from here.

[104:46] Because you're going to have two pages, three pages of notes from today.

[104:50] And what's going to happen is you're going to get on a plane.

[104:52] And you're going to have a fresh piece of paper.

[104:54] And you're going to go through your notes.

[104:55] And then you're going to write like a list of like three things that you're actually going to do.

[104:58] And then that's actually what you're going to end up doing from today.

[105:01] That will be the output of this day.

[105:03] And so I just want to make sure that and then of those three things,

[105:06] one of them will have by far a disproportion impact on how much money you make.

[105:09] And so most small businesses or even even midsize businesses don't grow as fast as they could because they spend their time doing the wrong things.

[105:18] And what's what's deceptive about it is you can make an argument that reactivating this group can make the business more money.

[105:26] There's a lot of things that can make the business more money.

[105:28] The question is which of these things will make it the most money.

[105:31] And so by doing that, we have to because it's a reverse back into.

[105:35] We had those four levers that had earlier.

[105:37] We've got traffic.

[105:38] We've got conversion.

[105:39] We've got price.

[105:40] And then we've got chart.

[105:41] So there's the big four things.

[105:42] And so if we want to grow the business, those levers have to change or the business will not grow.

[105:47] And so for many of you, it might just be you need more traffic.

[105:52] Like the business model is fine.

[105:54] The economics are fine.

[105:56] And you need more traffic.

[105:58] And so basically, at least my thought process that I have with this is I try and scale as much as I possibly can until something breaks.

[106:05] And then when it breaks, we fix that thing and then go back to scaling the shit out of it again.

[106:11] I mean, fundamentally, that's what we do.

[106:14] And I mean, I teach this for businesses, but I'll walk you through it.

[106:21] So what is going to go to these four levers that we talked about earlier, right?

[106:33] Which is going to be your traffic.

[106:36] Your two F's there, whatever conversion, which is you tweaking your bow page, making a VSL that's better adding carousel images, tweaking the bullets that you have in your landing page.

[106:47] You've got the price, which you can test, and then you've got shirt, right? Which is a big list of things that you can do.

[106:52] So these are the four levers. The things that you're doing have to ladder up to one of these four.

[106:56] If it doesn't ladder up to one of these four things, why are you doing it?

[106:58] All right. So like if we were to translate your objective with the free group, you would have to say, okay, I think that the us reactivating the free group will increase traffic.

[107:07] That's fundamentally what you do. You want this traffic source to make you more money from your to towards your ticket, her high ticket thing.

[107:13] And you say, okay, how much work will it take me to reactivate this group?

[107:18] Okay, is there anything else that could get me more traffic than reactivating the group?

[107:22] Of the things that I have available so right now could me just spending more money on ads or making better ads,

[107:27] make us more than me spending the time to reactivate the group.

[107:30] If so, forget reactivating the group, make better ads.

[107:33] We're spending more money on ads. So make sense? So once you figure out, and when we're picking which of these three things are four things that you're doing,

[107:40] the thought process is which of these is the biggest concern in the business.

[107:44] And so if conversion rates, like say for example, on the on the landing page is super low, then it might mean like, hey,

[107:50] before getting more traffic, I'm going to, I think I can double my conversion on this page because I haven't really spend any time on it at all.

[107:56] Okay, well then it makes sense to spend a day or two, like, can I really clean this up and make it as crisp as you really possible with the language that I use?

[108:03] Can I grab screenshots that are more meaningful that like you probably had more testimonials, things like that you haven't updated?

[108:09] Can I put that on there? Can I make an actual three minute VSL that is more compelling than the one that I just like tossed up there? Okay, that's probably a day of work.

[108:16] Well, it's probably high leverage because I can double the growth of the business by just improving this conversion metric.

[108:21] Pricing, like, well, if everybody just pays you more, we already went through that example over here.

[108:26] This guy obviously making more money. And then you have your big list of things that you're doing for churn.

[108:30] And so cool, which of these is the biggest thing that's going to train in the business? You pick the one that you're working on.

[108:35] And then for me, I tend to think through this.

[108:40] More, better, new, and I tend to do it in this order most of the time.

[108:48] So, like, I will just ask when we're portfolio is like, why can we not just do more of what we're currently doing?

[108:55] Like, whatever we're doing, why can't we just do more?

[108:57] So you have to make an argument to me that we should react to be the spirit rather than just spending more money on that.

[109:02] You have to make an argument that it's easier and it will make us more money than spending more money on that.

[109:06] And if you can't bet the argument that we're like, well, then forget about it.

[109:09] If we can't do any more for whatever reason, if some limitation, like, we can't post more than twice a day on Instagram.

[109:14] Like, we just can't. Or we can. And just, like, if we've seen that when we post three times, it doesn't, doesn't deal the same performance.

[109:19] So, two is kind of the sweet spot to find. All right, then what can we do to make it better?

[109:23] Right, okay, because if we can make those two posts just higher quality overall, can we, like, really think through the hooks?

[109:28] Can we make sure that they're, they're, they appeal ideally to the audience that we're looking for.

[109:32] If we do better, then the quality, the traffic will go up, the more views will go up.

[109:36] To make sense. Now, if we can't do any more, any better, then we need to try something new.

[109:40] And you notice that most of the times you can do more of what you're doing, you can do what you're doing better, which is why I so rarely do new things.

[109:46] Once you have something that works, that's the hard part. Once it works, it's like, how do we scale the living crap out of it?

[109:51] And the reason that most not for me to do my opinion, especially small ones, get stuck is that they find something that works and then they stop doing it.

[109:57] And then they get distracted by six other new things, then they get completely spread thin, and it's been like, what's ironic is that the small business owner is the one who has the least amount of leverage.

[110:07] And you have the, basically, your contribution and your time contribution to the income of the business is more direct than anybody else's, especially at this level.

[110:16] And so like you, like saying, okay, I'm going to take a third of my time, I might just be like decreasing your business by a third.

[110:21] And so you have to have a very strong argument for why that's going to make sense. And then for who, once you have a team, then that becomes the next thing. It's like, okay, we know we aren't increased traffic.

[110:30] The way that we're going to do that is like we can't do more posts on Instagram, so we're going to make them better.

[110:33] And this is the process that we're going to focus on getting better, which means that once a week I'm going to take three hours and I'm going to script out.

[110:39] I'm going to look at other people's content that have really good hooks. I'm going to write down all the hooks.

[110:43] And then I'm going to make content that I think is going to appeal to my demographic and a better way.

[110:48] Cool. Now, who's going to be, you know,

[110:50] if it's you, then you're the hoop and a lot of things. If the business is bigger, then it's like, okay, Jeremy, you're running this and then we just measure to make sure Jeremy does a job.

[111:00] That makes sense in terms of thinking through this. And so we just want to make sure that what you are doing is going to map to what's going to drive growth within the business.

[111:08] And I swear to God, so many times, people are just doing shit that does not map to this.

[111:14] Okay, reds over.

[111:18] One quick question on that. The first four is there like a certain priority that you would recommend for like, I'm a solo operator. I'm doing like 50 a month.

[111:25] Yeah.

[111:26] B to see offer. Is there like one of those big four that you would recommend prioritizing first?

[111:29] Start here.

[111:31] Okay.

[111:32] Because this is how you have life load in the business. So you have to promote. You have to car customers.

[111:37] Once this is relatively consistent, even at a low level, I then, this is me how I think through this. Now, not when I was younger.

[111:44] Normally, I would just be like, just do as much of this as you can, forget everything else.

[111:48] Now, it's doing enough of this so that we can keep working on how do we, how do we find the things that people actually want versus what we think they want?

[111:57] And then there's a things that we can remove. Like, how can we delete things? How can we make this simpler? How can we make it more elegant? How can we shorten the models that we have?

[112:05] I mean, we're hiding classroom for new people. Like, think about this. Like, we've removed three calls a week. Like, we're trying to take things away.

[112:11] So we don't want to add, it's easy for us to add the value. It's, but we want them to consume it. And so consumption should be the highest priority for everybody here.

[112:18] In terms of how do they get value? They have to consume value. Right? It's a consumption should be the highest priority.

[112:23] And so, we start here until you have enough flow going through the system that we can see what they really want.

[112:31] And a lot of times these simple things like the last mastermind, we went through a ton of depth of all the things that you can do to reduce current.

[112:38] Right? It's like, so you experiment with that. And this might be months while you're doing this. I mean, for context, school didn't hit like a, like, let's go hyperscale until like recently. And this was years. Right?

[112:48] Of getting the product right. Like, obviously, like, there's people coming in every day. And there was enough promotion that we basically, we could test and keep learning.

[112:56] But it wasn't like, we don't want the world to find out about it yet because we want to get all these pieces right. Once these pieces are ready enough, then you go back here and scale it a little bit.

[113:06] Boom. Yep. It's great.

[113:10] So right now, the question for you is, if you have really low turn, I don't know if you do, but from what you were saying, it sounds like you have low turn, then then yeah, do more.

[113:21] Do better. I want your fairly doing. So you're running ads. Yeah. Do you spend more? It's been more making better.

[113:27] Top 20% of my best customers targeted towards them. And then I have that insight and then just keep making that better and then just more.

[113:34] More better. And then just spend 400 grand a month on that. Yeah. Sure.

[113:39] I mean, it's like an inside joke in my business. Like, he's just to say more better. So yeah, that's what we're going to do this quarter. Just like we did last quarter. Just like we did the quarter before.

[113:47] We're going to do more. We're going to do better. And if we do this, things will probably make more money.

[113:50] And then if there's something that prevents us from doing more better, then we fix that and then we go back to more better.

[113:58] Does anyone have questions about what they need to do for this?

[114:01] Like, like, you need your like, okay, am I should I be spending more money? Well, if your, if your out TV is good in terms of your and your and your cack is low, then yeah, I just keep spending.

[114:11] I guess for like low ticket communities, you know, recently we had a video where we went like seven things like,

[114:17] oh, hand riddle, or later, it's all boarding, ex-again reviews. Yeah, for communities on school, like which one of these would you go after and the first.

[114:24] I feel like you have even more insight. Well, with you, the price sounds like the thing that's moving at them.

[114:30] So go the price. Okay.

[114:32] Because you've already experienced what that's done. All right, you know the average is around 20. You probably want to be on the good side of that.

[114:39] So figure out why you're not like, now I would talk to your customers first. Like, why did you cancel? You want to talk to the people that can't sit.

[114:47] You want to talk to the people that stayed and you want to figure out what differences they have.

[114:52] And then if you find the people that stayed, did these things emphasize those things. If you find the people that left to do the things remove those.

[115:01] And so it might not be price. I'm just, yeah, it about you told us. So, maybe it's price. So like balance that.

[115:11] And then, you know, with your traffic, you're, you can drive more of that. And then you can play with about page conversion. You can play with that.

[115:21] And then when you're bored of those, go back to retention.

[115:24] Yeah, I know I can drive like easily way more traffic is just that I have a leaky bucket.

[115:29] So I want to fix it. So I'm like, wondering if I should add the onboarding or, you know, onboarding, I think for sure is a good idea.

[115:35] And how would you, because you did that for a little ticket? You do a group onboarding and everybody who signs up gets one group onboarding.

[115:42] Then you attend, you do it once a week.

[115:45] I think people throw a lot of shit in the community and then they just keep adding. And then they think they need to keep adding to make it better.

[115:52] But it's not true. Like, overwhelm is the main cause of churn. Think about the experience.

[115:57] So how many things in the classroom would you say is like the sweet spot? Because I'm right now I've like eight maybe.

[116:05] Honestly, the hardest part I found when improving anything is to figure out what's actually wrong with it.

[116:10] That, by being working on the school games fun, or recently, by the way, almost would be happy with this.

[116:16] I figured out like what the problem, to try to figure out what the problem was was actually quite difficult.

[116:24] But in that was my, it was this guy I knew from New Zealand, who's a complete stoner that had text me when home mostly.

[116:33] When homozy launched the games, he couldn't understand what it was. And I was not going to try to explain it to him.

[116:40] But when we came back to making this, improving it, I was like, it turned out that he was the best signal for it actually.

[116:48] What the fuck is the school games? I wrote it down. That was the problem.

[116:53] If you didn't know what school was, you have, and you see an ad from homozy and he's talking about the school games and some leaderboards and coming to face.

[117:00] People don't know what the fuck that is. So I wrote down what the fuck is the school games and I was like, that is the problem.

[117:07] So, but that took me a lot of research to, to like find, right?

[117:13] I was talking to a lot of people. I was doing this with Kirby. It's quite an interesting process, right?

[117:18] And then we will, okay, well, how do we describe this damn thing in a way that is,

[117:23] makes sense to like, stone a dude? Um, because it helps to use extreme cases, like Steve Jobs tested products on children,

[117:32] because like if they could understand it, anyone could understand it, right?

[117:36] So, like defining the problem and then coming up with different ways you could solve it.

[117:43] I've been doing this with Goose and Kirby in the office all week. We probably design, we came up with many different ways to describe what it is.

[117:50] Many different landing pages, many different bullets. And we just kept talking to users getting feedback and kept iterating it.

[117:58] We probably made 30 versions. Some of them were so wrong. I wondered what kind of tangent.

[118:06] You'll never see it.

[118:10] But, you know, we actually, at the end of about one week, we landed on something.

[118:15] And now, everyone we show it to instantly gets it. It's like, we don't actually have to fully launch to find out.

[118:22] Well, when you learn how you can use everyone to get feedback and talk to people and show it to people and get their reactions,

[118:29] you can do a lot of fast iteration cycles without the harshness of like reality.

[118:35] Then when you launch it into reality, you have a way better chance, right?

[118:41] So that's how you improve anything. Like, that's not the games. But that's what we were doing to the games recently.

[118:48] We Kirby was doing interviews with all of the winners.

[118:52] That was overwhelming. Not many people were showing up. So we cut that. We just did one humorous EQ and A-week.

[118:58] Right? Attendance is up.

[119:01] Viewing is up. People are now saying that it's way more valuable.

[119:07] And, you know, so it's, we were unlocking the one day recordings after you got three customers.

[119:15] Well, like, why are we making it hard to get the most valuable thing?

[119:20] Now you just need three members. They can be free. Right?

[119:24] So like, what do people value? How do we make more people experience that?

[119:28] What do people not value? Take it out. What do people not understand? Reward it.

[119:33] You see, it's all the same.

[119:35] But I will emphasize what Sam is saying. There's a, it's so much more work than you expected to be.

[119:41] And everyone wants, like, the one silver bullet that you're going to magically fall on it.

[119:44] But if it were obvious, you would have already done it.

[119:47] And so it's like, it's disguised. And that's what, I mean, this is literally what makes business hard.

[119:52] And so I'll have a business owner on a Q&A call say, like, what should my price be?

[119:56] And I'm like, I don't know. I'll walk you through the process of how I'd figured out.

[119:59] But I don't know your avatar. I don't know your traffic scores. I don't know the value, profit or community.

[120:03] And even if I did, I would say, I'll start here. And I'm going to do the math and I'll move it.

[120:08] And I'll do the math. I mean, with a portfolio, the same thing I was doing.

[120:11] It was like, we tested 50, 35, 25, 15. We just tested it. I was like, I don't know. We'll find out.

[120:17] And then they were all the same. And then I was like, okay, well, which business would I prefer?

[120:22] And then we go into that, right? And so just in terms of thinking through things,

[120:25] like the amount of effort that goes into it that most, I would say that like, as I've gone,

[120:29] as I've gone, moved up in business, the my understanding of the level of effort that you're

[120:33] required to solve complex problems has gone up a hundred X. It's just to significantly

[120:38] harder to solve more complex problems. And that's also why the biggest pay days are on the other side of

[120:43] this problem. Because if they're really easy to solve, they're going to already solve it.

[120:48] So it's like four hours in a cup of coffee and a bunch of data and you're like, let's try this.

[120:54] There's a quote I learned from the software engineers at school.

[120:57] They say, you have to make every detail perfect, but the only way you can do that is to limit the amount of details that you have.

[121:05] So inside of the school games, we have eight videos, all of them together,

[121:09] or less than 45 minutes. One course. We do one cool week, and that's it.

[121:15] Then once in a month, you get a download from here. A mastermind. That's it.

[121:20] Very easy to explain to someone. One call, one course, one mastermind and what?

[121:26] And there's 13,000 people in that each paying 99 and a month. And they get the school software.

[121:34] I have a question. So there's a fine balance between, because if you're a leader of our big community, right?

[121:42] If you're showing up too much, you kind of almost lose your power, right?

[121:47] And if you do Q and A every single day, nobody will want it. It's not special.

[121:53] So how would you balance Q and A calls, making posts inside of the community, and just showing up and giving people attention like that?

[122:02] Sure, there's a data answer for this rather than me just guessing. We probably find it out and what the best, you know, cadence is.

[122:09] I'll tell you, I personally, I think post twice a month in school. That's not planned. I just, I just kind of poke around and I see what people are struggling with.

[122:16] I made that niche post because I was really tired of people like, what's mine?

[122:20] It's going to be about, and I was like, here's how you find your niche.

[122:24] And so it's just like, I just listened to what was the, like, there's, you probably noticed this in your community.

[122:29] It's probably like a problem to your, it's like, people just kind of glob on to a single problem all of a sudden.

[122:34] And like, I feel like I was seeing more and more of that. So I was like, all right, I'm going to try and answer this.

[122:39] And so then you make that and then it's like, hopefully. And if you put the thing in and then that problem still exists, then you didn't do it, right?

[122:45] So it's like you have to do it again. You have to make it simply, you have to make it easier whatever it is.

[122:49] You keep doing it until that one goes away. Then like the next problem will occur. And the good news is that your customers will always have problems.

[122:55] Yeah. And so you just solve.

[122:57] I can tell you a good thing that works for me.

[123:00] So I spend a lot of my time reading what people are saying. I'm trying to understand what things people are struggling with.

[123:10] So I'm not in there just posting it. I mean, they're listening the most more than anything else.

[123:15] Most would be like 90, it would be like a lot of time has been listening. Trying to figure out what is going on, what should I improve, what problems is the community facing, right?

[123:27] Then when I'm pretty sure I've got those problems, I'll even talk to some power users and I'll validate, do you think these are actually problems, right?

[123:36] And then I'll make sure I'm clear on the problems first. Okay, now if I spend now prioritise them, what is the most, what is the most pressing problem? Okay, number one. Now I'll just focus on that.

[123:47] At least I know if I just fixed that, I'll add some value, right?

[123:51] Yeah. So now I'll try to fix that. And I will try to fix that by research, experimentation, etc.

[123:59] And then I'll come back to my community and say, hey, I saw a little you guys will face seeing this. It sucks. I fixed it. Here you go.

[124:10] And then it's how I like that. So you add value.

[124:14] You know, like I have this little template on my wall for emails, which is, hey, I made this thing for you. Here's what it does.

[124:22] That's enjoy. Like CT. Like that's like, that's what I need not to play.

[124:28] Because it makes it really simple. Like, yeah, you guys were stuck with this thing. I made this for you. Here's why it's important. Goodbye.

[124:33] The hard part is finding the thing. Like I said, how do we make the school games funnel better? Well, what's the problem with it?

[124:41] That's the real question. And it was some stoner dude who had the answer.

[124:47] Yeah. So you wouldn't have a schedule of like posting daily or a second, like every second day or definitely not.

[124:55] That's like a Henry Ford production line for community. Like, we're not trying to pump out posts fast. That's not what makes it.

[125:05] But it's not that's not a good community. A good community is something that understands your pain and experience and delivers solutions and is fun.

[125:17] Yeah. You're right. Yeah. And isn't overwhelming and doesn't make me read five articles a day. Right? Like value post. Yeah.

[125:28] Because I don't want to read a buddy article that's pain in the ass. Like, I want a solution. Or I want to laugh.

[125:36] What have done here? So have a question. If you guys had to decide on building like a and a donna school or an anime shreds, which would be your choice.

[125:49] I actually don't understand the question. So the model that they have like you look at a donna school and he's got loads of

[125:57] Delivery in the calendar section like every day twice a day. And for higher price point and then you got animation shreds, which is nothing in the calendar.

[126:06] But loads of posts like just emojis and random stuff. Which is a better model for actually

[126:12] Helping more people get in greater scale and then eventually making more money with that.

[126:18] I guess we'll find out. If you guys have a big one, which would you, which would you pick? Well, I've bought watch both of them.

[126:25] The anime shreds one's super interesting because it broke a lot of like preconceived ideas. Like it had no classroom when it launched.

[126:35] It was a $11 and it grew to 100 grand a month faster than anything and became number one on discovery. Right? Like real fast.

[126:43] And there wasn't a ton of posting in there from the owners. It was mostly driven by the members, right?

[126:50] Plus, I know there are about page conversion rate as one of the highest. What I'm really curious about is their turn.

[126:57] But I guess that time will tell it's new. But I think the fact they started lower and then increased higher makes it's a good move for turn. And I also know turn as low in your prices lot.

[127:07] So that will be quite interesting to watch over time. And so can it scale? I know Hamza's trying to scale higher in a donor school.

[127:18] I think anime shreds guys apparently want to scale more. Both people probably want to do at least work as possible.

[127:29] So there's that and then there's the retention. And it will like over time will see like how those two models differ.

[127:38] I think what anime shreds wasn't just the price though. I think what they showed us is that if you have like something unique like the fact that it was called anime shreds and the artwork.

[127:56] That's that definitely added something.

[127:59] That's kind of what goose showed us. If you make something a little bit more unique.

[128:04] And that's just like free performance, right? Like if you can make your landing page conversion double by just theming things and making them a little bit more interesting.

[128:16] That for sure is really good. Like I would encourage everyone to think about that.

[128:24] But I can't say which model was better.

[128:26] Anime shreds converts way higher but a donor school is way more expensive.

[128:31] And they're both making around the same amount per month.

[128:35] It'll come down to EPCs earnings per click. So fundamentally if a hundred clicks go to a Donna school and a hundred clicks go to.

[128:41] And this is this is to be fair is purely contrasting the business and like the community because traffic stits outside of that.

[128:48] Because if anime shreds 10X is their traffic they will become 10X bigger than then a Donna school independent of what they didn't sell to the box.

[128:56] And so if we're just isolating conversion rate price and churn then you look at what's the 500 clicks.

[129:02] How much of these clicks worth for this business versus this business?

[129:06] And then that literally just gives you the objective measure of which one of these creates the most dollars.

[129:13] Because I'm kind of in a point where I'm like you guys start the school games and you've got that platform for us.

[129:19] And then I start like I'm going to copy what you guys are doing with the school games and how you run things and I copied a Donna school and game because that was the guys over the top right.

[129:27] Now anime shreds looks like he's going up there and I'm in a point where I'm like which which model is better and which ones actually.

[129:33] Yeah, because I'm not that good at business. I just see things that work and I copy it.

[129:36] You're not bad.

[129:37] Well these are going to be more. They're going to be more. So if you keep switching, you're going to eat.

[129:41] Yeah, exactly that's what it's like.

[129:42] There's a thing you want to see it.

[129:43] Like even saying it like that, me thinking about it is like it's probably neither.

[129:48] It's probably the one that is more like authentic.

[129:52] Because I'm feeling as to what am I baby, you know.

[129:55] All right. What is that?

[129:56] The feeling.

[129:58] Yeah.

[129:59] Well, my feeling to do is it goes a bit opposite.

[130:02] Because I'm doing 17 lives a week in my pay at the moment.

[130:06] So yeah, but my feeling is telling me to put it in the free community.

[130:11] But I mean that might be stupid because I'm trying to list all you guys saying you're saying no.

[130:14] We're just doing one now and it's like some of it the fuck.

[130:17] Yeah.

[130:18] I think if you want to use all that like all that.

[130:20] So last game's a ton of people, I think it was last games.

[130:25] It was like the live game. So it was like everybody was doing like Instagram lives.

[130:29] Might have been a lot, maybe two ago.

[130:31] And the thing is, we have to separate promotion from delivery.

[130:35] So from a promotion perspective, you're doing lots and lots of lives.

[130:38] You're making lots of posts. You're making all the stuff.

[130:40] I don't understand. I got you.

[130:42] And so my point is it's like I would take all that energy and put it into promotion.

[130:47] So you get way more people into your community.

[130:50] And then things is that you, if you do 17 lives a week, externally.

[130:55] It's okay that people don't consume all of them because if they can consume one of them, they might buy.

[131:00] Whereas if you're inside of the community you're doing 17,

[131:03] they might be like, oh, I'm missing out on 16 out of the 17.

[131:06] I'm not getting the value.

[131:08] If it's free, your cost is time.

[131:11] And so as long as you deliver a return on the time that they spend consuming your content,

[131:15] then they got, they have a positive exchange with you.

[131:18] And so you basically, it's like you can never promote too much.

[131:21] You can't put too much inside of the community.

[131:23] And so I would take some of that juju and put it externally to drive more through the box.

[131:27] I think Hums actually did like the opposite like when he increased the daily coffee

[131:32] to like nearly every day.

[131:34] He's turned like reduced massively.

[131:36] So I've no idea.

[131:38] I used to be like every day.

[131:41] And trying to figure out all kinds of things around the moment.

[131:47] I have my answer to him.

[131:49] He kept coming up with ideas.

[131:50] My answer to him was talk to your customers.

[131:52] I've recently been pretty public about this.

[131:54] Is that like, I widened my content for I think either three or six months.

[131:58] I like started sprinkling in some other pieces.

[132:00] I talked about how I eat and how I lay on how lay on I run,

[132:04] you know, being married and things like that.

[132:06] And the problem is that you do get positive reinforcement from it.

[132:10] And so it's like he made some stuff on relationships and then people like,

[132:13] oh, this is awesome.

[132:14] But the thing is is like the wrong people were saying it was awesome.

[132:17] And so what's happening is my audience was growing,

[132:19] what is growing with the wrong people.

[132:21] And so I had, I mean, I had this moment where like sometimes you have these like,

[132:25] I had a friend of mine come into a friend of Quain and so I'd say,

[132:29] flew in and was like,

[132:31] I probably just 10 million bucks a year.

[132:33] And he was like, yeah, you know,

[132:35] I don't listen to too much of your stuff anymore.

[132:38] And he's like, yeah, I was hardcore for like six years.

[132:40] And then I just kind of, I guess it didn't really apply to me anymore.

[132:43] He's like, I guess I'm not really like your avatar.

[132:45] And I was like, you're 100 or 100 most fucking avatar.

[132:48] Like you are exactly who I'm going after.

[132:51] And then I was like, oh, I'm a moron.

[132:54] And I just basically it's like you get, you get,

[132:58] it's a balance. Like you want to listen to customers,

[133:00] but you also want to make sure you're listening to the right customers.

[133:02] And so I reoriented all my, my content,

[133:05] which maybe some of you guys have seen.

[133:07] And it's been a hundred percent back to business.

[133:09] It's been the theme that we have internally, my guys know.

[133:11] Is that if it's not business, we don't make it.

[133:13] Just very straightforward.

[133:14] Like it can be business adjacent.

[133:16] So like if I talk about, you know,

[133:17] prioritizing tasks in my day that can have some element of productivity into it.

[133:21] But it's like, all my examples are going to be business related.

[133:23] And so, but by doing that,

[133:26] when I looked objectively across metrics for psych conversion,

[133:29] opt-in, book sales, applications, the portfolio,

[133:32] all of those metrics went up,

[133:34] even though the average view per video went down.

[133:37] And so it's like, I'm not in this to get famous.

[133:40] I've been this to make money.

[133:41] I have a question.

[133:42] I wonder if anybody has, I need this might be for everybody,

[133:45] but like has anybody done anything to when they do have a turn to customer

[133:49] to get them back into being a customer?

[133:52] Or you do.

[133:53] See the funny gift.

[133:54] You're just like, send a funny gift.

[133:56] And a DM ask credit pener, if you see him.

[133:59] Ask him for his message.

[134:01] He's apparently got some message he DMs people with a funny gift.

[134:05] And it gets people to react to for it.

[134:07] He says it's like something like weaving so soon.

[134:09] Is kind of like the vibe is kind of...

[134:10] Yeah, but you want to get the funny gift.

[134:12] Of course.

[134:13] Yeah.

[134:14] And it's just within school.

[134:15] Yeah.

[134:16] Okay, so no email or SMS or anything like that.

[134:17] Our sales team has that for ghosted leads.

[134:20] They have a Kevin Hart.

[134:21] I mean, it's like...

[134:22] I think that might be it.

[134:24] Yeah.

[134:25] I think that's what he's used to.

[134:26] Yeah.

[134:27] And yeah.

[134:28] It gets high response, so it's then any message.

[134:31] This next clip is about growing the business even beyond you.

[134:34] Meaning who are you going to bring on your team to help you get to where you're trying to go?

[134:38] And if the people that you're bringing on, keep being dumb and making stupid mistakes,

[134:43] it's not there fault, it's yours.

[134:44] And the good news is it's a skill that you can fix.

[134:47] And in this part, I'll break down how I get the best talent, how we recruit them,

[134:50] how I hire them, how we train them, so they can win.

[134:53] High-rank related stuff.

[134:54] High-rank.

[134:55] I've had a good in colliding with just stuff.

[134:57] Just till getting low-level stats so I can focus on my base specific.

[135:01] Well, for me, I know that if I spent 100% of my time on just YouTube making YouTube videos,

[135:06] I can get to like 100k or even 150k a mile.

[135:09] But right now it's like 15-20% of my time.

[135:11] So just everything else.

[135:13] What is that?

[135:14] Well, building the modules, delivering the product,

[135:17] on course, appearing on course.

[135:20] Just everything about community.

[135:23] Because you can't donate to all of those things.

[135:25] Yeah.

[135:26] Yeah.

[135:27] But like there's a lot of stuff like, you know, maybe email us, like sorting priorities, like calendar.

[135:33] All of those things I could be outsourced, so like, I'm wondering,

[135:37] in what order do I hire so I can basically spend 100% of my time on the thing I have the most expertise in.

[135:43] Well, building out the modules is mostly a one-time thing.

[135:48] And then once that's done, that'll be off your plate.

[135:51] The emails are 100% outsourcible.

[135:54] They're plenty of operators who can write emails for you.

[135:56] And I'd recommend taking somebody who's in the community who knows your voice

[135:59] and can give you like a good v1 draft and then you just tweak it and send it.

[136:03] The calls you want to basically just show up.

[136:08] Like, that's, I mean, more or less that's kind of how we run this like,

[136:11] I show up.

[136:12] We do the Q&A and then I move on with my life.

[136:14] And I treat it just like it's a meeting and I do it on my meeting steak because I do meetings on Mondays.

[136:18] And so we do it on that day because it's the least disruption for how I work.

[136:23] And so if you have, so I'm, I'm going to have a really big piece about this coming out soon,

[136:27] but basically the difference between maker and manager time.

[136:30] So if you have deep work, that's what I consider maker time.

[136:33] And a lot of people want any organization, got operators, video editors,

[136:36] coders, like they have, they have to just like get really deep into a project.

[136:40] And you want to minimize time on meetings as much as possible so that they can work.

[136:43] Basically when they're on a meeting, they're not working.

[136:45] There are managers, which is the opposite, which is for them being on meetings is working,

[136:50] right? And coordinating between things and talking to vendors and, I mean, like sales guys,

[136:54] customers support like those are, those are people who like when they meet is when they work.

[136:58] And so those are both fine, the problem is when they intersect.

[137:02] And so managers start interrupting makers from making.

[137:05] And the problem is that makers only have 14 time blocks a week.

[137:09] You've got one morning block and one afternoon block.

[137:11] And that's it. Like I'm sure when you're making a YouTube video,

[137:13] it's not like you can't split it between two meetings, right?

[137:16] Like you need a whole big chunk of time.

[137:18] Managers though can spread their time in 15 minute increments.

[137:20] And so they have 20 time slots a day, but it may only as two.

[137:24] And if you take one maker slot up, it's like you just killed 14th of night week.

[137:27] Right? And so there's a disproportionate cost for a manager compared to a maker.

[137:31] When it comes to calendaring. Now you're the entrepreneurs.

[137:34] You're like, how wise is relevant for me? Is that YouTube book?

[137:37] And so what's been, like if I had a bit like my single greatest return on time habit that I have

[137:44] was that the first six hours of my day since I was poor has always been zero meetings.

[137:50] And it was just that, well, the shoot, but people started calling because I had a brick and mortar,

[137:55] you know, Jim, people started walking in at 5 a.m. Right?

[137:57] So I was able to take, you know, like lock my door to my office.

[138:01] And I just was like morning sessions, I don't participate in.

[138:04] But as a 10 a.m., I would then start working and being out there.

[138:08] So from 4 to 10 was my six hours every day.

[138:11] And then from then on, I just knew it was just fires.

[138:14] But that still allowed me to move the ball forward.

[138:16] So I only got a maker, like basically five maker slots during the week,

[138:19] but then on Saturday Sunday, I got four more.

[138:22] So I got nine blocks at time throughout the week that I could do like major big work.

[138:26] And so if you can look at orienting your calendar so that, I mean, now I only have one day,

[138:31] which is one day is where I do any coordination or any calls or anything.

[138:35] And the rest of my week is truly empty, like truly.

[138:39] I can show you my calendar, it's empty.

[138:41] And that takes time to get to, but that's because that's like the team knows that if I have an empty calendar,

[138:46] we make more money.

[138:48] And so for you, you have to try and push as much into that one day as you possibly can.

[138:53] And that also means that if someone's like, hey, I've got this person that you should meet.

[138:56] And it's on a Wednesday and they have to net and it's one meeting.

[138:59] You just say no.

[139:01] Yeah, I think I always have to do it.

[139:02] But that's the only time I can make that you're like, then I guess we're not going to meet.

[139:05] I think I have to do the time studies to just it.

[139:07] Like the timer every 15 minutes.

[139:09] Because like it's, you know, it's got a hard to go in retrospect, like where did the entire day go?

[139:14] It's like, but like, you're working all day, but like what was the chief?

[139:17] Right.

[139:18] Make your time.

[139:19] Like when you have a maker block, you know exactly what you're going to be doing.

[139:22] You have the one thing that you're working on.

[139:24] And sometimes it takes five blocks in a row to get that one thing done.

[139:27] Like what the fuck is the school games?

[139:29] Like I bet you took more than one maker, but I know it.

[139:32] And in terms of the people you're hiring, like especially in a small business scale,

[139:36] like, do you, is it better to just hire somebody who can get the job decently down or

[139:40] sure a way like until there's like a killer?

[139:43] Um, that's a, that's a tough question.

[139:46] Um, I, it's a, it's a, it's a super tough question.

[139:49] I would say that it's going to basically you can, you can see the arbitrage between how much more you get back

[139:54] for the top.

[139:55] Basically, so let's say we take, let's just say in doing example.

[139:58] Let's say you bring in a mediocre email writer.

[140:00] If the, the discrepancy between how good your emails are versus their emails,

[140:05] but the time you save not writing the email goes into YouTube, for example.

[140:10] If you can make up the trade, then it's worth doing.

[140:14] Does that make sense?

[140:16] I think you would benefit the most from just a generalist person.

[140:19] So someone who's a hardcore fan of yours already emerging in the community is already doing the stuff kind of for it.

[140:25] Probably would be stoked to work with you won't cost you too much money.

[140:28] And we'll learn everything as you go with you.

[140:30] And now just do everything that doesn't make sense for you to do.

[140:33] Probably like you probably have a few customer support tickets to emails.

[140:37] They'll do those.

[140:38] I mean, multi-order does that for me, but are you already had someone?

[140:41] The issue is that he still in school, so he's like part of time basically.

[140:44] Well, so I probably need one more person.

[140:46] Quit.

[140:47] Just get him to quit.

[140:48] Yeah, get him to quit.

[140:49] Is 16.

[140:50] Yeah, get him to quit.

[140:51] Is that legal?

[140:52] Is that legal?

[140:53] Um, yes.

[140:54] Do you get a learn so much more doing this shit?

[140:59] But his mum would kill me, I think.

[141:01] Yeah.

[141:02] Don't say it.

[141:03] She was a blame it on him.

[141:04] Don't blame it on him.

[141:05] That's all.

[141:06] Why is his father?

[141:07] Yeah, but do you even, you'll definitely need group onboard.

[141:10] That's the next thing you'll get for y'all.

[141:13] I learned group onboarding from the first day one recording.

[141:16] You'll need those ASAP, bro.

[141:18] Yeah.

[141:19] Another thing is you could get an EA.

[141:22] If you got some like tedious tasks, like when I got my executive assistant in life,

[141:25] say so much time on my play, if it's just like tedious things are a little bit simple,

[141:29] I don't know if you probably have a bunch of stuff that's like simple stuff that you have to do,

[141:32] that you could just pay somebody like, you know, like offshore talent, like,

[141:36] you know, anywhere from like six to eight bucks an hour to do that.

[141:39] They would do you have a setter, like anybody in your DMs.

[141:42] Bro, you need to add ASAP to grow a setter in your DMs and on group onboarding calls.

[141:47] Your community is about to, your term will go way down and you'll get a lot of stuff.

[141:52] Would I give somebody my school best words to go, you probably set up a mini chat account or GDHL, like one of these other people?

[141:58] You're someone else.

[141:59] Yeah, we're talking about in your social media.

[142:01] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[142:02] You're like, like everything from YouTube to the adult patient.

[142:04] Because it's YouTube.

[142:05] Oh, okay.

[142:06] Yeah.

[142:07] You know, you don't have any following on social media?

[142:09] Well, everything goes on YouTube basically.

[142:11] You know Instagram, and I'm not sure about that.

[142:13] I mean, not really.

[142:14] Are you collecting any phone numbers?

[142:16] No.

[142:17] So even in your free school, you don't ask the most simplest funnel post to do.

[142:20] Now you see I'm getting generation man, then I do this shit.

[142:23] I mean, like, you've got telling me to add email, right?

[142:26] And like, eventually I probably have to add it, but like, I like my simple funnel, you know?

[142:30] Dude, I didn't send emails for nine years.

[142:34] Do you want to know emails?

[142:36] Wow.

[142:37] I say that to point out the extreme of like, whenever we were like, you have to, like, you don't have, like, there's a bullet.

[142:43] Did you collect them?

[142:44] Hmm?

[142:45] Did you collect them?

[142:46] Yeah, I mean, I collected them because I felt like I had to.

[142:48] But like, I did nothing with them.

[142:50] I truly nothing.

[142:51] That eventually I hired someone and they just said it emails.

[142:54] And I just like, was like, I don't want to read them.

[142:56] Like, I'll kill everyone.

[142:57] How many more years do you have in school?

[142:59] Half two in high school.

[143:01] And then I mean.

[143:02] Well, he's your bottleneck because he's a school as your bottleneck.

[143:05] School is your bottleneck.

[143:06] Yeah.

[143:07] School is my bottleneck for school.

[143:09] Yeah.

[143:10] And strength for sure is.

[143:11] Set one.

[143:12] Yeah.

[143:13] If you're going to get, if you're going to get into entrepreneurship, then, like, whatever.

[143:19] Either, I mean, I mean, I, I, I, I, I, I try not to, to tell people to quit high school,

[143:23] but like, I just don't think it like, like, so you think it's worth it if you quit.

[143:27] It's just, it's just the, it's just the systems.

[143:29] So they're like, what are you learning?

[143:31] Yeah, I mean, right.

[143:33] Yeah.

[143:34] Right.

[143:35] You're like, so I want to not learn a lot of stuff so that I can learn not much for most of my

[143:41] time.

[143:42] I get it.

[143:43] Like, I mean, I, it's very tough.

[143:44] I get that, but it's still like.

[143:45] If you're going to go to med school or like be a lawyer or be an investment banker or

[143:50] Goldman Sachs or like, maybe you're going to do computer science and Stanford, then sure.

[143:56] Stay in school.

[143:57] But if you're not going to do that, it's useless.

[144:00] If you're going to entrepreneurship, then like, there is no degree that's hard.

[144:04] Yeah.

[144:05] Just a thought.

[144:06] They even in business degrees, crap.

[144:08] Oh, yeah, it's irrelevant.

[144:09] Yeah.

[144:10] I've, well, I was similar, we, well, we have a similar problem with delegation.

[144:13] So for the promos and for all the engagement that Justin has to do in the community,

[144:20] it's hard to find time to like balance both of those two of those things.

[144:26] And really the big bottleneck is deciding if we're going to have them to yogra for

[144:31] with us all the time or like hire someone on a project for project basis, where you

[144:36] think works better out of the two.

[144:38] Honestly, I think he just needs a video algorithm for the day like so.

[144:41] I got some lasca there.

[144:43] That's right.

[144:44] And it's with me all the time.

[144:47] Yeah, well, it's been the most difficult art.

[144:49] Like, do we can say give everybody a gogra for like, I mean, basically you're

[144:53] years at this point.

[144:54] Yeah, probably just a year.

[144:55] Yeah, it's not that hard for all the time.

[144:58] It feels like, yeah, but yeah, it's because all of them, they just, they ended

[145:03] dropping off really, really quickly.

[145:05] I'm not making it.

[145:06] They just, they don't like, maybe it's a ultra fit thing to be that.

[145:10] But like it's been really difficult to find.

[145:12] But for sure, so I'm just going to stick with us travel.

[145:15] I made you want to.

[145:17] I feel like anyone in this room would want to do it.

[145:20] It's such a cheap.

[145:23] There's so much value.

[145:24] He's being with Alex every day.

[145:26] Could be people in your audience.

[145:28] But does he not want someone following him with a camera?

[145:31] No, no, I mean, we definitely would prefer.

[145:34] No, but him, it's him who's not.

[145:36] Yeah, he's he, he wants someone following us.

[145:38] But like, it's, it would be Thomas, but like, Thomas isn't.

[145:42] He's not a very agafer.

[145:43] Like, he's a, he's a different role in entirely.

[145:47] So he wants someone to follow him.

[145:48] He wants someone to like, can like have good bands or will push him.

[145:51] Sometimes like, someone who's like, the friend gang.

[145:54] Yeah, yeah, as he made a post about it.

[145:56] Oh, yeah, we made, we do do the hiring post basically every single month.

[145:59] What is he just learn how to use a camera?

[146:01] Oh, that's actually what I used to do.

[146:05] How won't you say why the fuck I'm doing?

[146:07] Do you pull out a camera?

[146:08] I can do it, yeah.

[146:10] Yeah, you already friends.

[146:12] If that's the element and you know how to use a camera, I mean,

[146:16] shit.

[146:17] You do.

[146:18] I mean, the only thing that's I'm still in the world.

[146:20] The only thing that's I'm still like throwing off by is like,

[146:22] Zillians of people have come in and I'll bet you that many of the people who've applied would have been a fit.

[146:27] So I just, it might just be a weird hiring process you guys have.

[146:29] I mean, when we, when we've run our things, actually, how did you come in?

[146:33] I applied for Laela's biographer.

[146:35] See?

[146:36] He's the good.

[146:37] And I was like, you're with me.

[146:38] Yeah.

[146:39] Yeah.

[146:40] Yeah.

[146:41] Shreddy had Jason.

[146:42] I agree on the feeling, Pat, though, if someone's going to be following you around

[146:45] or the time like the vibe is more important than the feeling.

[146:48] Yeah.

[146:49] The skill is not the thing.

[146:51] It's just the vibe of having them with you all the time.

[146:54] Daniel asked me on the last question in the interview.

[146:56] He was like, well, what's, what's like, is I was telling him about,

[146:59] I was like, listen, I'm going to be like, hey, we're going to do this big thing.

[147:02] And you're going to set up and then I'll be like, nah, just kidding.

[147:04] And it's going to happen all the time.

[147:06] And then also, like, you're going to have plans and then you're going to have to cancel the

[147:10] last minute because we go late.

[147:11] And like, basically, it's just going to be chaos.

[147:14] And I can be in a bad mood.

[147:15] And I can be tough sometimes.

[147:17] And I just like painted that picture.

[147:18] He was like, got it.

[147:19] I'm here for it.

[147:21] But he's like, what do you, like, I'm really experienced.

[147:25] I think you were like, I'm a really eye caliber videoer.

[147:27] What do you need a professional for?

[147:29] Yeah, what do you need a professional for?

[147:31] What do you ask me?

[147:32] And he's like, what's the most important thing for you to me?

[147:34] And I was like, I, like, I really thought about it.

[147:36] And I was like, you like me.

[147:39] That's really it.

[147:41] Did you start off?

[147:43] Sorry, what was your name?

[147:44] Daniel.

[147:45] Did you start off like absolute pro with the cameras?

[147:49] No, I had to learn how to use Cameron.

[147:51] Trisha.

[147:52] I'm just starting with the four.

[147:58] I'm referring to when you started the Alex.

[148:00] Were you already good?

[148:01] Oh, yeah.

[148:02] Okay.

[148:03] No, so I say that because like, I'll bet you that there's like people in that list.

[148:08] If you have had thousands of people apply for a videographer, it's like, there's definitely somebody in there who's an exceptional videographer.

[148:14] And so for me, I honestly, like, I am grateful that Daniel has the skill that he has and can like edit back and

[148:20] hers and do all sorts of stuff.

[148:21] He's a weapon.

[148:22] He can do lots of things.

[148:23] But like for me, if his skill was half of what it was, but what I like him as much as I like him, that would have been enough.

[148:31] This is just like your skills was bonus for me.

[148:34] But it was just like, we have such a sick vibe on the media team.

[148:38] I think we have a sweet, like the teams awesome.

[148:41] And so like, I've had a videographer in the past that I had nothing wrong with the guy.

[148:46] I just like, I didn't look forward to it.

[148:48] You know what I mean?

[148:49] It was just like work, I said, okay.

[148:50] Sit down and like, I got a little cord sub.

[148:52] And it came out and it came out in the footage.

[148:54] And so like, I have to look forward to there should feel, I should feel no friction or no hesitation to having Daniel around.

[149:01] Like I'm not worried if he's around if I'm saying so I don't have to edit myself.

[149:05] And like that is number one.

[149:08] You've got, she's got to like me and I've got it because it's both ways.

[149:12] Because she, like if you don't like someone, you can capture it very differently.

[149:16] Like on some level, like you can make someone look very different if you don't like them.

[149:20] And so it has to be both directions.

[149:23] Like both people have to have to get along with each other.

[149:26] That's probably something we ever really looked at because sometimes we want, like really really nice stuff.

[149:32] It's like, you know, this promotion shots and what it's,

[149:36] and obviously when you look at the applicant.

[149:39] I prioritize liking a person and if the thing is is like, I'll let you if there was something that we're like, hey, can you learn Adobe something?

[149:45] You'd be like, sure.

[149:47] I like it'll take me a couple weeks but I'll figure it out.

[149:50] And like if you have that type of person, it's like, I just, it's so much harder to find somebody like that is to find somebody who has the base skill.

[149:57] At least in my opinion with this role.

[150:01] So I would just prioritize someone that just likes and then that's it.

[150:06] And then from there, like the other skills.

[150:08] I remember where you mentioned this, I was watching some of your content and said, you can kind of made a system for how when someone's filming you.

[150:14] They're nodding.

[150:15] They're bringing you your decadent and a lot kind of stuff.

[150:17] Yeah.

[150:18] So, yeah.

[150:19] All this, I mean, Daniel's always got a nicaret, caffeine, water, gatorade.

[150:25] He's got a full full service.

[150:29] At all the time, he's always ready.

[150:31] I just put in that out there.

[150:33] Yeah.

[150:34] No, it's super awful.

[150:35] And like after every recording session, it's kind of like on a foul shot for basketball, like everyone, everyone pounds afterwards.

[150:41] Like it's just like, we always do that like wall.

[150:44] Like you guys can't see it because they're, you guys are looking at me, but I can see them.

[150:47] And like they're nodding the whole time while we're filming because they know that that, because when we thought activities, right?

[150:54] And then we had to go to the things because so Caleb who runs the whole team, he was obviously higher one and so he had to camera first.

[151:00] And that was the first time I had to be there if I really liked it.

[151:03] I was like, oh man, like Caleb's cool shit.

[151:05] Like this feels, this isn't, this is easy, right?

[151:08] And I was like, what makes it, and then Caleb obviously moved up and then he stopped big at the filming session.

[151:13] So we had two or three guys there at the filming sessions and I was like, man, this feels heavy.

[151:17] Like, what's like, why is this feel different?

[151:19] And so then we had to backtrack and be like, what is he do that is different than what other people do?

[151:25] Other people were like the vibe is like, vibe fuck, I don't care.

[151:28] What does he do?

[151:30] And what he did was he would nod while I was going.

[151:34] And after every filming thing, he was like, that was fucking awesome.

[151:37] Like sick, that was so dope.

[151:39] And then he also listened and he had really engaging questions that he'd be like, so, how does that relate to this?

[151:45] Or how does that relate to the fall of questions were written?

[151:47] They could slice that up and that made for really good content because the questions he had was questions that the audience had.

[151:53] And so it's just looking at like, what are all the little micro things?

[151:57] And then you make that into a checklist.

[151:58] And that's why I think most people can't teach anything because they don't get it down to like, what are the behaviors?

[152:03] And so now the tape, I mean the old team knows that when they film, it's like a whole thing.

[152:08] Did you like buy out as entrepreneurs people?

[152:11] Or like, no, we do, so I'll tell you the quick process and then we'll move to a different topic.

[152:15] But we do the big application, give a big raw file, told everybody that 48 hours to submit the raw for that way everybody's working off the same thing.

[152:25] Because if everybody can just pull from whatever then the quality of the content is going to be a huge factor.

[152:29] Whereas if everyone pulls from the same raw, the quality of the editor is going to be the thing that shines through.

[152:34] And so this is from the editing perspective.

[152:37] If we're doing videographers then yeah, it's going to be way more about vibe, like in terms of our our dynamic.

[152:42] But for editing, then they would submit.

[152:46] And so from 1200 we got 60 submissions to see if you guys like 5% of people actually submitted.

[152:51] Riley, did you come from one of our contests?

[152:54] No, as we stopped to.

[152:55] But it was pretty similar process like a plot, came to a wall file, headed it.

[153:00] Yeah.

[153:01] And so then they turned it in.

[153:02] And then you know, Caleb would look at all of them and be like these three guys are sick and they don't interview those guys.

[153:09] And then however many of them are cool.

[153:12] We're hot.

[153:15] That's fundamentally how we do it.

[153:17] Like we test for skill for editing, we test for skill.

[153:19] And then we test for vibe because it's way easier to go like from 1200 down to a much smaller with from skill.

[153:26] From a vibe perspective.

[153:29] What was the process for you for videographer stuff?

[153:31] I do like for interviews.

[153:34] Actually five interviews.

[153:36] What was Caleb to Frank and then what would you.

[153:39] And then what would he was intense?

[153:40] I was like, this is a test.

[153:41] Everything you test.

[153:43] You had like one really tall chair.

[153:44] What's small chair is like, pick one.

[153:46] I was like, I'm going to say this small chair.

[153:48] I'm going to lose.

[153:49] I'm in.

[153:50] I was in test.

[153:51] Yeah.

[153:54] That's point.

[153:56] So yeah.

[153:57] Hopefully I give you a little bit inside.

[153:58] Yeah.

[153:59] Sure.

[154:00] Process.

[154:01] Yeah.

[154:02] It's really all about the chair size.

[154:03] This is what matters.

[154:04] Yeah.

[154:05] I need somebody who isn't going to be trying to compete with me.

[154:07] It would mean.

[154:08] I just like, I don't, I didn't want that energy.

[154:10] I wanted somebody who's like super laid back and Daniels is laid back and they get.

[154:14] And you didn't, that gym launch.

[154:16] You said that you don't do emails.

[154:18] Like you didn't do emails.

[154:19] How did you nurture your clients then?

[154:24] Like kept in contact with them.

[154:27] You mean leads?

[154:28] Yeah.

[154:29] I just got more of them.

[154:30] Okay.

[154:31] I'm being did serious.

[154:32] Like I mean, like there were, there are many things I probably should have done.

[154:35] I just, every time someone's like, do you want to start emailing?

[154:37] I was like, oh no.

[154:39] And I didn't want to give it to somebody else until eventually they were like, can we please hire someone to just do this?

[154:44] And I just didn't look at it.

[154:46] I'm just, I'm so particular with written, written word.

[154:49] It's the, it's my primary way of communicating.

[154:51] It's like, like, people, despite the fact that everyone on the internet sees me on video.

[154:55] Like, my books are better and my opinion than anything I create.

[154:58] But it's also because I spend more time on it than anything else.

[155:01] And so when I see someone right, I'm like, this makes no sense.

[155:04] This is completely unclear.

[155:05] Why do you exist?

[155:07] You've also, I think, I kind of understand your question a bit.

[155:11] And I'm kind of like, whom I was in this way.

[155:13] Is it if you've got something that's working that isn't email?

[155:17] And you can just keep increasing the volume of what you're doing.

[155:21] Then who cares?

[155:24] Now is it? We just kept spending more money,

[155:26] and kept making more money.

[155:27] So I was like, I could do that, or I could make more ads than in crush.

[155:31] Yeah, I mean, honestly, I think, if it's same when I are so aligned with this,

[155:35] which is just like, find something that works.

[155:38] Do as much of it as you possibly can and eliminate everything else from your life.

[155:41] That's not that.

[155:42] And that out single is all your personal life stuff.

[155:46] Like, this was a theme of the whole last talk.

[155:49] If you guys all heard it, we talked for like an hour, maybe more on this one topic of like everything

[155:54] that you had like cooking, cleaning, laundry, getting your car filled up with gas.

[155:59] Like, all of this stuff.

[156:00] If you know that you can make more money with your time, then it cost you to get someone else to do that.

[156:06] Then you should do that.

[156:08] And then you'll be amazed at how much extra time you have.

[156:11] If you're cleaning your house or preparing your mouse,

[156:14] that's going to be the best thing you're going from this event.

[156:17] It's just to get someone else to do that.

[156:20] Cleaning and meal prep and groceries is like the lowest hanging food.

[156:25] So I calculated this up to someone based on US averages.

[156:28] So just the big three, which is laundry, cleaning and food related.

[156:31] Those together are 96 hours a month on average.

[156:34] It's like, I just found you two and a half full work weeks of time.

[156:39] But and also, there doesn't include switching costs.

[156:42] I've like the cost of time of like cleaning it, like cleaning up after you eat.

[156:45] And we're thinking about when you're going to do it.

[156:47] And what you're going to eat and groceries and what you're going to buy and putting them back in the shelves and taking the bags.

[156:52] So like all that shit.

[156:54] I like emphasize like the personal chef like house care stuff.

[156:58] Like, I've been a coach for a long.

[156:59] My first six K-Pane for, I got like an in-house health team, which is like a housekeeper chef.

[157:03] I'm like a dietitian stuff. It's crazy.

[157:05] But another expensive.

[157:06] Like, I pay my, I had a maid and I pay her 150 bucks twice a week to come over and I have a meal plan.

[157:10] I get to her and she shops with food.

[157:12] It's all whole foods.

[157:13] They come over and they make it at like 20 meals.

[157:15] My fridge all times are like amazing good like Latino whipped up food.

[157:19] It's a great.

[157:20] And I was able to take like three more sales calls a day.

[157:24] That's a big reason why I've been one of the school games.

[157:26] Like, that was huge.

[157:27] And you also feel amazing about it.

[157:29] It's like it was like a super luxury investment.

[157:32] Like, oh, shark has a private chef.

[157:33] But it's $1500 a month.

[157:35] Like, if you do the math, it's 96 hours.

[157:37] It is $1500 a month.

[157:39] That's literally like I have a big presentation on it.

[157:42] It's $15 and like $16 per hour.

[157:44] If you can make more than $15 and $16 per hour with your time,

[157:48] you should do that.

[157:50] It has nothing to do with luxury.

[157:51] It has everything to do with like, what is my return on time?

[157:54] And like, you can just ignore every poor person who says otherwise.

[157:58] This is kind of for both the, probably you've used Sam as well, definitely.

[158:02] But I guess like when you're building, you know, a startup.

[158:05] Obviously, you know, you might have, sometimes,

[158:08] you might have a little bit lack of capital, a little lack of resources.

[158:11] I guess how do you get a players to work for you and with you?

[158:16] And how do you like structure, constructures and all that?

[158:19] So like, you know, for...

[158:21] We need to earn even any money.

[158:23] No, no, no, no, no.

[158:25] No, no, no, no.

[158:26] I mean, no, maybe you're trying to get somebody who's, you know,

[158:29] making decent money, you know, already or you're wanting to get, you know,

[158:33] make a money.

[158:34] But like, you want to get an a player team.

[158:37] But you're still a startup.

[158:40] You're not, you know.

[158:42] Yeah.

[158:43] Well, it's really hard.

[158:46] It will probably take a long time.

[158:49] You'll probably want to quit.

[158:51] But eventually, like, something you'll just, there'll be a chemistry, I think.

[158:59] And a perfect fit with someone.

[159:01] And you just kind of have to give it enough time until that thing happens.

[159:05] And it ends up in a relationship with someone who's not a good person.

[159:08] And you also have to offer something unusual, like, for me,

[159:10] it was offering the, like, co-found a title to Daniel.

[159:13] Because I knew when I found him that that was what I needed to use.

[159:18] So...

[159:19] And that program.

[159:20] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[159:21] Yeah.

[159:22] And, you know, when I found him, it was like the perfect balance.

[159:28] Because he just wanted to code.

[159:31] He said, I love to code.

[159:32] I can build anything.

[159:33] Well, I need someone who can dream.

[159:36] And he was, like, if you've got some, like, money,

[159:39] and you know what to build.

[159:41] And you can help us get customers.

[159:42] And, and, well, I needed to as code.

[159:44] Like, then we'd good.

[159:45] And we, we had, like, a good chemistry.

[159:48] How did you all meet if you don't mind me asking him?

[159:50] It did 600 interviews.

[159:52] That's the same.

[159:53] How did you have it?

[159:54] Like, uh, like, uh, like, uh, like a hedge on it?

[159:56] So, like, did for a year?

[159:57] How did you find, how did you get the interviews?

[159:59] And you work with, like, uh, I worked with many different recruiters.

[160:02] Uh-huh.

[160:03] Hacking news.

[160:04] Like, I tried honestly, but a bit of everything.

[160:08] Plus, I had to hire five of the wrong people too.

[160:11] So, it's not like I just got it right.

[160:13] Like, it was the most brutal thing I ever did.

[160:16] Do you have, like, I hear people talking about doing more interviews.

[160:19] Do you feel like there's ever, like, a sense of uncertainty?

[160:21] Like, after you get to a certain point, you're like, damn.

[160:23] Option number one, two, and three, you're good or whatever.

[160:26] Like, what do you think?

[160:28] Yeah.

[160:29] Like, some people, I swore great and they weren't.

[160:31] And I'm sure some people were great and I didn't see it.

[160:36] And I missed them, but how can I know about those?

[160:39] Um, but in the end, like, Daniel May co-founder, he was, like,

[160:44] There was chemistry.

[160:45] And I think I didn't, I ignored.

[160:47] I was too logical back then, but I think I've come to realize now that the chemistry is really important.

[160:55] And I pay way more attention to that now.

[160:59] Ultimately, you're not going to know until you hire them, right?

[161:02] But you just have to talk to a lot of people too.

[161:07] I feel like there's, there's been this case where I feel like everybody wants to be an entrepreneur.

[161:13] You know, so like, when I'm trying to hire people or it's almost like, they'd rather do that myself or rather do that.

[161:20] Well, kind of piss.

[161:22] Just, you know, I guess like high level people for a growth partner, you just see somebody who can, like, be a growth partner, essentially, or be a, you know,

[161:30] I think I think main purpose problem is we're unicorns.

[161:33] Yep, and we provide our people with, like, we cover all the bases.

[161:36] So we need more people like us.

[161:38] Yeah, and then yeah, so we've even talked to some people that we know aren't making, you know, that much money and like, hey man, I'll pay triple what you're making right now.

[161:49] You know, like managing school communities.

[161:51] And they're like, oh, I'd rather do my own thing.

[161:53] This is like, wait, what, you know what I mean?

[161:55] It's like this connect, I think sometimes.

[161:57] So I don't know, like it's like, like, yeah, the money is not the whole thing.

[162:01] Right, right. Absolutely.

[162:02] Because, you know, when with us, we like competing with Google, NASA, space, Tesla.

[162:07] So everyone's trying to throw money in them.

[162:10] And they show us their DMs on LinkedIn and stuff, and stuff, and same.

[162:14] Like, the amount of recruiters, right?

[162:16] So, um, some money can't do it.

[162:19] Like, it has to be something else.

[162:22] Right?

[162:23] And you're just, do you think it's like the environment?

[162:26] You're just out.

[162:27] Well, what, when I got my co-founder, all when we get people now.

[162:30] I get everybody.

[162:31] Well, the hardest one is getting the co-founder in the beginning, because you don't have anything.

[162:36] So, right, that's the hard one.

[162:39] But with time now, the way we get it is through internal referrals.

[162:43] So, if we have great people, and they've worked at places like coin,

[162:46] most of our talent comes from Coinbase and Riot Games.

[162:51] Because we've got some of their best engineers, and they know,

[162:54] everyone, and we need to tell, they're like, how are you going over it?

[162:58] Riot or Coinbase, I'm okay.

[163:00] Do this place is badass, Graham.

[163:03] And they trust that person, because that person is an recruiter.

[163:08] They're probably the best software engineer these other people who've worked with.

[163:11] And so, they would mean a lot.

[163:13] What about people like, they aren't coders, they're like, what about, like, you know,

[163:16] Andrew or like, massive, you know?

[163:19] Oh, that's a different side of the business, so that comes from your customers.

[163:24] So, Matthew, who's running out podcast, he came from the community, and like, he showed,

[163:31] he was making podcast episodes for free.

[163:35] And then he flew to the first school games.

[163:38] He paid for it himself, he's from Ireland.

[163:42] Like, who on indeed is going to do that?

[163:49] I don't know if you've ever tried indeed, it's so bad.

[163:53] But, yeah, but you look from them within, I think, like, Kirby was, in my

[163:58] mastermind, and then he made this free community, called St. The Sises.

[164:02] He was one of the leaderboards for school community, right?

[164:06] He was like, okay, he's committed.

[164:09] Then Kirby hired Wickeder, was Wickeder.

[164:12] There he is, because he was his most engaged member in synthesizers.

[164:17] So, you see, and then Wickeder hired the Sky Cool Navarce,

[164:22] because he was someone who connected with him on school too.

[164:26] And now Navarce is referring to someone.

[164:28] Well, I love it.

[164:29] Yeah. I think that's what we're hoping for, right?

[164:31] Like, whenever you're like, don't, like, that being said,

[164:33] you know, I'm not sure if you're going to be doing a lot of,

[164:35] the best people in the world, but we're kind of rooting through

[164:37] in terms of, yeah.

[164:38] And that's what's one.

[164:39] But if you don't get that one, you don't even get anyone else.

[164:42] We have a few good really good people, I'd say.

[164:44] But yes.

[164:45] Have you pushed them for referrals?

[164:47] Um, yeah, but, I think, I think the big thing is getting the

[164:50] high level people.

[164:51] So, we have really good, like, um,

[164:54] executors, not really good leaders.

[164:56] That's one thing that we have, like, I'm literally, I'm managing, like,

[164:59] I feel like I have to run up the five meeting today,

[165:02] almost, you know, for our team, so it's just like excessive.

[165:06] Yeah, it's excessive.

[165:08] So I would challenge the structure, then.

[165:10] The vision for the business has to be big enough that smart people can fit their dreams

[165:16] inside of it.

[165:17] And so if you want brains, then you need people who, like, they need to be able to

[165:22] believe that their dreams can come true within your vision.

[165:25] If it's, again, if it's like, yeah, we've just got a couple of groups that were running

[165:28] and were making money, then it's like, that doesn't really get me motivated.

[165:31] If I'm intelligent, I'm like, because like the best people have, there's no lack of opportunity for

[165:36] best people.

[165:37] They have tons, like, you have to think about this.

[165:39] It's a totally different game.

[165:40] Like, if you're accustomed to taking people where like, I really want to job, all of those people are irrelevant.

[165:45] You have to be people who are like, in some ways, you're competing for them.

[165:49] So the more you're competing for a prospect, like, selling them.

[165:52] And so if you feel like, like, I'll tell you the funny one, is like, if you're interviewing people where you're like,

[165:57] sell me on why should take you.

[165:59] If you say that to somebody who's actually really talented, they'll be like, I'm good.

[166:03] Like, they just like, they just don't risk like, you have to respond to this offer within 12 hours.

[166:10] This is like, okay.

[166:13] I think you have the nail right there for me.

[166:15] Like, their vision has to be, our vision needs to be big enough to try to dream to fit into it.

[166:18] You have to be able to say, like, what we want to do is we want to make music money into the standard for this.

[166:23] And then they have to believe with a decent amount of certainty that it's possible.

[166:27] And so like, how you guys present, like, you are absolutely selling them.

[166:31] And so like, I think I can drew this about on a past one, but everybody here understands,

[166:36] you know, lead generation, lead nurture, sales, onboarding, and then, you know, retention ascension.

[166:43] Right? That's the, how you do with customers, right?

[166:45] This is the exact same process for an employer.

[166:48] You generate applications, you nurture applications.

[166:51] The sale is the interview.

[166:52] You onboard the employee and then either retain them or send them.

[166:56] It's the same thing. And so you basically have to understand the act,

[166:59] like, this is when we get into scaling, because everyone's like two or three people are like, what's scaling?

[167:03] It's just where the inflow of talent of the business matches the inflow of customers into the business.

[167:09] And you have to have an exceptional conversion process for attracting talent.

[167:13] This is where brand counts double.

[167:15] It counts once on the front end for customers and again on the back end for talent.

[167:19] And it becomes either a virtuous cycle or a vicious cycle.

[167:22] Either destroys your business. You have a bad brand.

[167:25] Because what do you think? Like, what, like, great talent will look at your reviews and be like, oh, is it never right?

[167:33] And what are we going to get in place?

[167:34] So I guess in the last question, I guess what will be the best way to acquire talent as a just building a personal brand?

[167:41] Like, in our field of work, because I don't think it's necessarily like, I can't, I don't feel like I can find the right people on LinkedIn or something like that.

[167:48] You know, for what we're trying to do, and these to be people are kind of like,

[167:51] I'm already kind of entrepreneurs or people who are in where the cells are managed or filled.

[167:56] You really depends on what role you're looking for, but I can promise you that very smart people are all like done.

[168:01] Do you know how I, um, I looked, I got invited to speak at something.

[168:07] I looked at who I also was speaking there and I saw how most he was speaking there.

[168:11] And I was like, that's my opportunity.

[168:14] That's the first time we met in person.

[168:16] Yeah.

[168:17] Honestly, so cool.

[168:18] How long goes that?

[168:20] One year before I spoke about doing a deal.

[168:23] But you have to like be strategic sometimes.

[168:27] Yeah.

[168:29] And then so you have to kind of do this old school networking thing, which I fucking hate, because

[168:35] It's like the only time I've ever done that.

[168:38] The whole thing's still like the one deal to never do that again.

[168:44] But yeah, you kind of have to do that.

[168:47] I had to start going to like these software things.

[168:50] I had to start to meet some software engineers.

[168:53] I had to learn about their world.

[168:55] I had to ask people about why does what do haters are software engineers?

[169:00] What do you like?

[169:01] What makes a good company? What makes a bear company?

[169:03] You have to like learn everything about it and network and do that.

[169:09] It really sucks, honestly.

[169:10] But if you're serious about it, I knew there was no way I could build school without this person.

[169:14] So I delayed starting it by a year just to find the person.

[169:19] Yeah.

[169:21] So I'm not even going to start until I find them.

[169:24] Like that's how a scene should line you there.

[169:26] That's why it's all everyone does not do software.

[169:29] It's just because the scale of how difficult it is to actually do it right is so hard that like,

[169:34] No, it basically no one does it right.

[169:37] Even if you know what you're doing, most people can't do it.

[169:40] Most people who are in the info order are like, oh, my info thing is insoluble.

[169:45] So I'm going to build software and they just think that like lightly,

[169:48] and go high level means they had a software company.

[169:51] Like, but I mean, right, or they create some widget that someone else can duplicate in five seconds

[169:58] that they did off with an off-shirt developer that like, if it actually did work,

[170:02] then that developer would hold you around some of them.

[170:04] So I'll play it out two steps and the code should anyways and it's all that all sucks.

[170:09] Like, you're done doing it.

[170:11] Yeah.

[170:12] And so when we're like, you're just, you don't want us to succeed.

[170:14] That's what, because you're doing stuff.

[170:16] I was like, no man, I saw that.

[170:17] Same with the five years and I was like, great.

[170:19] Okay, I saw the metrics.

[170:20] I was like, okay, this is legit.

[170:22] I spent all my money and it still wasn't enough.

[170:24] Yeah.

[170:25] I had to spend like twice that again.

[170:29] Yeah.

[170:30] Yeah.

[170:31] I guess for that two by the way, that's going to help a lot.

[170:33] Yeah.

[170:34] I mean, the personal brand thing is just good for, like, if you have one, it's great.

[170:38] It helps a lot.

[170:39] Yeah.

[170:40] But at the end of the day, if the, if the, if the business that you're trying to build

[170:43] solves a real problem and you really genuinely care about the problem, if you find someone else who also cares about that problem, they will be more likely to work with you.

[170:51] Like, that's fundamentally it.

[170:53] What do you, sorry, last question.

[170:57] Think about creating an offer to train people to do what you are trying to eventually staff for.

[171:05] Like, I'm gone.

[171:07] Yeah, like, you know, like, there was a point.

[171:10] There was a point in time I had a closer program.

[171:11] I was training closures and all the staff in them.

[171:13] You know what I mean?

[171:14] And then I was, I stopped the next.

[171:15] There's so many closer training programs.

[171:16] But right now, I really need growth partners.

[171:18] People who can lead and manage our clients and kind of oversee everything.

[171:22] What do you think about, like, I know there's a growth operator thing, but they're not going to be a lot of people.

[171:25] They don't have all the skills that's necessary.

[171:26] What are some of them, you know, created a program to train people to do something and create another business to solve the problem.

[171:35] Okay.

[171:36] Depends if it's like, I know with a software engineer, no one's going to be any decent in 10 years.

[171:43] Maybe a prodigy in six or seven, but like, there's just no shortcut in that.

[171:49] Like, I mean, my co-founders done 20.

[171:52] So, the years matter and the same is true with a lot of things.

[171:57] Like, there's just years.

[171:59] So, like, but some other things might be different, like sitting, okay, here you can teach them.

[172:04] Closing you can probably teach that.

[172:06] But these more high-level strategic things.

[172:11] Yeah, they don't happen in, like, it took me fucking 10 years.

[172:15] Like, so, are you going to wait 10 years?

[172:18] No.

[172:20] Yeah, it's just, like, fundamentally, every skill is trainable.

[172:22] The question is whether it's worth a return on effort and the resources to train someone with it.

[172:26] If you break things down enough, you can train someone to do anything.

[172:29] It's just that if someone has zero meta skills, they don't know how to read.

[172:33] They don't know how to write.

[172:34] Then on how to talk, you could teach someone to do all that stuff.

[172:37] It's just, why bother?

[172:40] So, I'd rather take someone who's already here and then just nudge them if I can with, you know,

[172:44] perpetrating, they're just bridges between all the skills they come in with and then applying that to my business.

[172:49] You got it.

[172:50] Cool.

[172:51] Appreciate it.

[172:52] Yeah, always.

[172:53] I mean, the people is the reason that most internet marketers in general can't make money.

[172:57] I'm sorry, they make money, but they don't make, like, big money.

[173:00] Is that they just can't, they can't, they don't know how to operate people.

[173:04] And that's usually because they need, like, a right hand, a true right hand, who can, who's as good as them.

[173:11] And, like, Laila will never get the credit that she deserves and that's fine.

[173:14] But, like, the reason that all of our stuff is so big is because she's so good at building.

[173:22] Like, she's an unbelievable builder.

[173:24] And so, like, the culture of the team is rock solid.

[173:27] I mean, the guys will tell you, like, Laila really runs the, like, Laila runs actors.

[173:31] Like, I really, like, she really does, she does.

[173:34] Like, Laila runs everything.

[173:36] Like, I mean, I told you, I have an empty calendar.

[173:39] I can't have an empty calendar and also have a business that's running unless someone else is actually doing it.

[173:44] Laila takes 15 meetings a day.

[173:46] She operates. She's, she's coordinating things between different departments.

[173:49] She's checking on portfolio companies. She's having, you know, one of the people who are having some sort of emotional breakdown about some craziness, whatever.

[173:57] Um, she handles all that with a smile, internet, and so, but like, I, I, I was, when we were talking earlier, like,

[174:05] I capped at $3 million a year and then when Laila came in 24 months later, I took home 17 million in income.

[174:10] And that.

[174:12] And so, the difference was that she liked people.

[174:15] And I tried to avoid them.

[174:18] And that was the problem.

[174:21] And so, she heard, like, Laila's genuine vision in life is to build a company that people love working at.

[174:27] That's her whole, like, the whole reason that she, like, she gets a, like, her internal mission is to build a company that people love being at every day.

[174:34] And so her vision just fits within my vision. And so I recruited her.

[174:40] Um, to do it. But like, if we didn't do stuff that she liked, we'd like, she wouldn't build it.

[174:44] So I very much, like, especially the more talented the people that you bring on, the more you, like,

[174:50] like, they don't need pushing. Like, they know what they're doing. You just need to make sure that they're doing it in the direction.

[174:57] And you kind of do this.

[174:59] Yeah, the amount of training that you have to give someone is inversely proportional to the skills that they come in with.

[175:04] So the more specifically the less skill the person the more specific the instructions.

[175:09] So, like, Sam could basically just be like, hey, can you just promote school a lot? And I'd be like, yeah, he's not like, hey, could you make these posts and write this copy and send these emails and run ads and make the hooks like this?

[175:24] Like, that exchange has literally never.

[175:28] Like, I don't even have to see him see the ads before.

[175:30] More of the, they go.

[175:32] Almost he takes me though that he was like, when does the activation stuff come out? And I said, blast those, do.

[175:37] I don't know.

[175:39] They're like, for real, like, I already did it.

[175:43] And then you're like, I've seen this and I was like, yeah, I've already been thinking about that. We've got something coming.

[175:48] Like, we don't even, I've already thought about the next four things and we've got things really.

[175:54] So by the time almost years the idea, I'm like, yeah, we've got it. Don't worry. Do your thing.

[175:59] And then I'm like, cool, let me tell you what I'm doing on the media side. It's like, oh, shit, great.

[176:04] Like, draw the things that are wrapping up the system we're putting in place, like, we changed our cadence, like things like that.

[176:08] It's like, oh, don't.

[176:09] I don't even want to think about your YouTube.

[176:11] It's like, if I had to tell him stuff, oh my god.

[176:15] Like, yeah, but it's good to divide it like that because I can just focus on this stuff. He can focus on that stuff.

[176:22] Right.

[176:23] Could be, can focus on his stuff. We have very good, like, division like that.

[176:28] Yeah.

[176:29] The amount of direction you need to give someone is inversely proportional to the skill they have.

[176:32] Yeah.

[176:33] Like, if someone could just be like, hey, can you build this company and be like, sure?

[176:36] People will complain like, if people, it's always a sign of notice when people complain, there's no communication.

[176:42] Have you, has anyone had this?

[176:45] Is it an issue?

[176:48] Like, with teams, maybe a lot of you don't have teams here, but bad communication communication.

[176:52] Sometimes it's always the complaint.

[176:54] Yeah, I've found it's interesting that one because you don't really need to communicate a whole lot when you get the right people.

[177:02] Like, almost you said, like, couple of words and I said, oh, I got it.

[177:06] Like, what have happened?

[177:08] Right.

[177:09] But sometimes if you hire the wrong person, there's no amount of communication that can ever make it work.

[177:15] And it's exhausting.

[177:17] And it just still doesn't work.

[177:19] And I think I understood this.

[177:21] I think I told this at one of the previous ones, but how you know what a good culture is.

[177:25] Is this story of Google in the early days?

[177:29] So Larry Page searched for something in the ads that showed up will not relevant to the words he typed in.

[177:36] He took a screenshot, he printed it off, he got a red market and he wrote these ads suck.

[177:42] He walked over to the engineers and he pended up on the wall and he tapped it.

[177:47] And one of them walked over and picked it off the wall, stayed up all night then, night, and invented ad cents,

[177:54] which is there, which has made them hundreds of billions.

[178:00] So he didn't sit down with him and be like, look, I think you need to do this in this, in this, and maybe this, he just said, these ads suck.

[178:09] Right, is that clear communication?

[178:11] I mean, damn it was.

[178:13] No, but that's what good talent is. You can just be like this thing.

[178:18] That does this. Yeah.

[178:20] They be even even after say do this, you can say this sucks sorted out like.

[178:24] And then they'll be on it.

[178:26] Or they might have already pre-empted what sucks because they've already been thinking about it.

[178:30] So I always remember that when people say, oh, like you need more meetings or more communication.

[178:35] Like there wasn't a meeting, first of all.

[178:39] Right, there was, there was sloughing something on the wall.

[178:43] Yeah.

[178:44] When the most difficult things, this is like, I think this, from an entrepreneurship perspective in terms of development,

[178:49] is like, and since anyone here had another business before this,

[178:53] yes, okay, did you achieve, in this business, what you achieved in your last business, like, in, like, from how long it took you to get to that level,

[179:01] and your, the business before versus how long it took you to get to that level with this business was it way faster.

[179:07] And so a lot of the reasons, because you already beat the bosses up to that level,

[179:11] so it's kind of like you're quickly retracing your steps, and then you get to a level that you don't, you're to your level of incompetence.

[179:16] The difficulty, the thing that takes the longest in entrepreneurship is figuring out what good looks like at each level.

[179:23] And it's one of those things that's really hard to translate.

[179:26] Like you see the billionaires on stage, and there's like, I, you know, get great people on your, like,

[179:30] sure. But the thing is is that connecting what great people to them looks like in their mind and what you think great people are, that is an ocean apart.

[179:40] And so I mean, I tell this story in San Bernard's talking about this last time, but like,

[179:44] when we started meeting with private equity firms to, to look at transaction with Jim Lodge,

[179:50] I, we'd have these super long tables that were these boardrooms, and I'd see their team all the way on this side.

[179:56] I saw my team all the way on this side. I saw my team all the way on this side. And I would just kind of sit there and listen to like the questions that they were asking and the responses that my team had.

[180:04] To be fair, the team that we had, it built a hundred million dollar plus company pre-COVID. Obviously, I sold during COVID, which actually hurt my valuation, but not the point.

[180:12] So they built a hundred million dollar company, which is cool.

[180:15] But when I saw the, the town on this side, I was like, oh, that's why these guys are going to make three billion dollars over the next five years.

[180:22] This team. And it was such a stark contrast in terms of the level of town. I get not disrespecting my team. It was just such a difference that it was literally like after that immediately.

[180:32] I was like, my whole bar, which just reset in terms of the caliber of the people that even existed in the world, and everything was like, how on earth did I get those people to work for me?

[180:44] And so like, right now, some of you have like one person who's like, man, I couldn't live with that person.

[180:49] There's somebody who's literally 10 times better than that person that exists right now, and it's just trying to figure out what you need to do to get them on your team.

[180:56] But the problem that takes so long is looking at what good talent in general looks like, but even when it gets rural specific, like, say, I'm going to do all this research to figure out like, how do good software engineers talk?

[181:07] Like, what do they like, what do they want? And so so many of you guys are at a point where you need to like start hiring a sales director or something like that.

[181:13] Like, what happens is like, this is the entrepreneur and it looks like you bring some more on, you talk to a bunch of people and they're like, I think this guy is good.

[181:20] You bring him in and he sucks and that takes six months away from the growth that you would have had because your sales team drops in this guy's sucked, you put bad processes in.

[181:27] Then you got to fix the process, you got to find the people that guy hired because he sucked anyways, and then you're like, shoot, I'm going to try again.

[181:32] You've been the next guy in. And then sometimes it happens again and you're like, wow, this sucked.

[181:36] And then the third time and sometimes it takes a year or two years and then you're like, I now know and you get lucky and you get one who actually works and you're like, oh, this is what a great sales director looks like.

[181:46] And so the next time you go through your entrepreneur, you're like, you go right to there and then you're like, shoot, I don't know what a good customer success person looks like.

[181:52] And then you try again. And so it's like, however quickly you can work through that so you can start recognizing the pattern of a will good looks like in general and then be what it will good looks like for a specific role.

[182:02] That's how quickly you move through the levels.

[182:05] That's been my experience with this and I wish I try and do everything I can to try and translate that into the stories that I tell with the content, but sometimes it's really tough because they're like, not but like that is that is the secret sauce like that is it is being able to recognize like what a good growth partner looks like what a good even a good agency.

[182:23] I've had a good agency that we work with now. That's majority them 95% of the dog shit.

[182:29] So me guys run them.

[182:31] So you're saying.

[182:35] So like that's that's that's that's that's the pattern recognition that's the highest value thing that you and a learning is an octopus what what good looks like.

[182:45] So obviously like I'm I'm doing a lot of the management for our community and that includes like making posts from a lot of young as gross and

[182:55] And I was he just and has like lots of businesses yeah like destruction.

[182:59] Yeah, it's going to be like helicopter scene and like shooting whatever it's got.

[183:03] And how how could we maximize his time within the community?

[183:07] Because right now he's doing two calls for a month.

[183:11] I mean I mean if you if you modeled what I mean what my contribution right now is I do one call a week and we do this once a month.

[183:19] That's my contribution and then I add Hawk look at you know I poke around and I see what people are asking and then I end up usually just like I haven't committed to anything.

[183:28] I just right one or two posts a week.

[183:31] I'm sorry a month that are just whatever's kind of top of mind.

[183:35] Like on calls that you do right like you treat it like a meeting like on the calls for the school games like the weekly or the monthly call you just kind of sit there and just like treat it like a weekly.

[183:47] Yeah, they're like their Q and A, is they're like this.

[183:49] When he said like a meeting he batches it on the day that he does all of his meetings.

[183:53] Yeah, I do my school call all my day where I have all my meetings.

[183:56] So it's not as disruptive as if he was like, I don't know writing a book and then he had to switch gears to do a zoom and then switch back into the book.

[184:05] That's that's going to take more than an hour.

[184:08] We're like I can't record like if we're going to go report you know some YouTube videos or something and that's my whole morning.

[184:14] I can't like start reporting YouTube videos. We like hold on guys and then like go take a call and then go back to report like just this and work.

[184:20] And Kirby's there to make it less taxing on.

[184:25] Why is he so come where is it doesn't have to scan the chat or pick the questions.

[184:28] Yeah, so like if you're going to do a call, have someone like Kirby on.

[184:33] So you're curvy in this like I would just literally model what we would.

[184:37] What we're curvy does on a regular basis and just just replace roles.

[184:40] It's the same same set up.

[184:42] And you would call them minutes and come to.

[184:45] Yeah, I also record them too.

[184:47] So so Daniels but you got I mean actually shoot if you guys have probably seen some of them me yelling at the.

[184:53] I don't know if you see it when it's a but some of them really well.

[184:57] But he's right there. I've got my webcam here.

[185:02] And so.

[185:04] And so those get clipped into content for me. So it's like I'm doing delivery for the people you know for the school community.

[185:11] But I'm also getting clips for marketing and those get those get hammered out.

[185:16] So it's you get doubled up.

[185:18] Do you record your calls?

[185:19] Yeah, and I post them in call recordings with timestamps as well.

[185:23] Yeah, and the classroom page.

[185:25] I may content with that.

[185:26] Are you guys recording with another camera like for you could make content with it.

[185:30] We haven't done it.

[185:32] Because like you'll get the I'll bet you you get the most heated.

[185:34] Yeah, you get like super heated. I get I mean I get heated on the calls.

[185:38] Because if you can use it for many purposes, it's a much more efficient use of time.

[185:43] Yeah.

[185:44] Because that one hour made content.

[185:46] It bored and customers.

[185:47] It delivered value it made a recording.

[185:50] Do you know what I mean?

[185:51] And then people also ask like if you think about this publicly if you're promoting a snippet.

[185:56] People are like, how do I get on those calls?

[185:59] And then you just.

[186:00] Yeah.

[186:01] People are really like when like doesn't get really passionate about like things that you just interested in on the other.

[186:05] Yeah.

[186:06] Yeah.

[186:07] Those those are quite a few moments.

[186:08] We'll probably be the best reals or whatever.

[186:11] Yeah.

[186:12] All my best clips are just moments where I just freak out at some of them.

[186:14] So this next part is super important.

[186:16] It's about client and avatar selection.

[186:19] So one of the big reasons a lot of businesses suck to actually operate is that you have too many different customers.

[186:23] You want too many different things.

[186:25] So you had to promise lots of different things to everybody to get them to buy.

[186:28] But now you got to deliver on all these different things to all these different people.

[186:31] And so learning to sell and specifically learning how to sell the right people and say no to the wrong people is a skill that will absolutely

[186:38] Unlock growth and profit in the business because you'll get more of the right people because you'll talk to them and you'll ward away the ones that suck.

[186:45] I have one little question.

[186:46] How did you in KL meet her?

[186:48] You know how to use a client really.

[186:50] Same story.

[186:51] That's so cool.

[186:52] The client is Jim was losing money.

[186:53] He was working a nine to five job.

[186:55] He would work from five a.m. to nine a.m. at his gym teaching sessions.

[186:58] He'd go to his job at nine thirty or whatever.

[187:01] Work from nine to five.

[187:03] Go back to his gym.

[187:04] Teach all the evening sessions five six seven eight.

[187:07] His wife had just had a baby.

[187:09] She was pregnant with her second child.

[187:11] All of his income from his primary business went into the gym that was losing money and they had nothing left over.

[187:18] And so he called me up and he responded to her.

[187:22] And I got on the sales call and I was like, all right, it's whenever it was at the time.

[187:27] He was like, he was honestly the first ten customers I sold.

[187:31] And he was like, I would buy this.

[187:33] I need this.

[187:34] But I just gave my last ten grand or my only ten grand to this coach that was going to teach me how to have an online fitness business.

[187:41] And I was like, do you have an online fitness business?

[187:44] And he was like, no, I didn't work or whatever.

[187:47] And I was like, well, what if we just made your gym make money with that?

[187:50] Be more.

[187:51] He's like, yes, I'm fine with just making my gym make money.

[187:53] And so I sent put a thousand bucks down and he like put a thousand dollars onto a credit card or something.

[187:59] That's a beautiful bro.

[188:01] That's sick.

[188:02] They made thirty thousand dollars in first thirty days.

[188:04] I think that's the coolest story in the world.

[188:06] Whenever you give some of the money to the chance to buy an out of thousand.

[188:09] No one you probably never even let nobody buy any.

[188:11] No, everybody started a thousand books for the first three years.

[188:14] Wow.

[188:16] Because all gym owners are broke.

[188:18] All gym owners are broke.

[188:19] And so it's a thousand down, a thousand a week.

[188:21] So the thing is is that, and this is what everyone in the entire, like the entire info space still doesn't get because everyone's like, my programs, it's like, no, it's not.

[188:30] It's not.

[188:31] The average gym that still to this day goes through gym lunch space over twenty thousand dollars on additional revenue in their first thirty days average average.

[188:39] First thirty days.

[188:41] We track it because it's such an important metric for us.

[188:43] And the reason that we have to do that is because they don't have the money to paint.

[188:48] When I want to get paid.

[188:50] And so it's like, I know that this system's going to on average, on average triple your profit.

[188:55] We'll go from thirty six thousand to a hundred and twelve thousand in profit.

[188:59] Net of our fees is an after-eath paid us.

[189:01] You'll make a hundred and twelve thousand.

[189:02] That's the average over a year.

[189:05] But when you're broke, it doesn't matter because you're still broke.

[189:09] And you can't buy anything.

[189:10] So it's like, put a thousand bucks down and I still need it to have money for ads.

[189:14] So he had like three thousand dollars.

[189:16] I was like, keep two for ads.

[189:17] Give one to me.

[189:19] And you're going to run this ad, which is a video of Leila.

[189:22] Here on this ad to this landing page that I've made, you're going to put your logo at the top.

[189:27] And then when these leads come in, I was like, you're going to call them like, you need to feed your family.

[189:30] What you do?

[189:31] And so it's exactly what he did.

[189:33] And so once the second payment came in and I gave them like a fourteen day to the top.

[189:38] And so they said, you know, you're going to put them like a fourteen day to the lake.

[189:41] Because most of them didn't have any money.

[189:43] And so they would pay it.

[189:44] They'd collect cash from the people that were coming in and they could make the payments.

[189:47] And then I gave them an incentive in the first thirty days to prepay the rest of the thing at a discount.

[189:51] And so that way it turned a thousand dollars down into sixteen grand in the first month.

[189:56] And so my LTV to cack in my cash flow in terms of acquisition was super strong.

[190:01] And then like we ran that, we ran that for a very, very, very long time.

[190:05] Like a year and a half ago, I think after after I sold and killed to go re-switched it from a front end and back end to just selling a year for thirty six.

[190:13] I think is what it is.

[190:15] And so that's what they do now.

[190:17] And it's just a they bill every twenty eight days and I think it's twenty nine ninety seven.

[190:20] There's something that I'm not supposed to, you know, three k down or whatever.

[190:23] And that's, and that's fundamentally what happens.

[190:27] But like I've just saying like the reason the nitching is useful is that when you niche down,

[190:32] you can productize the delivery.

[190:34] Like there's no generic business quote consulting that can ever deliver as consistent of an outcome as a very niche business can.

[190:43] Because imagine if you had to do it generically, be like, okay, come up with an offer.

[190:47] Make something free and you want to run it to a lead gen page.

[190:50] And then when the leads come in, you want to call them quickly.

[190:52] You have to talk in generalities.

[190:54] Whereas I was like, here's the ad, this is the landing page.

[190:57] This is how you set up your lobby when they walk in, say these words.

[191:00] This is the price you're going to sell at.

[191:02] And by the way, here's the delivery for it.

[191:04] Here's the meal plans.

[191:05] Here's the cookbook.

[191:06] Here's the eating out guide.

[191:07] Here's all that stuff.

[191:08] You can put your logo on it.

[191:09] You can make it yours already.

[191:10] Spend all the time doing it.

[191:11] And the sales training they went through was the sales training.

[191:13] I put my trainers at my gyms through, which by the way, my sales training was less than one hour.

[191:19] And so there's all this clothes are training out there that's hundreds of hours long.

[191:23] But when I needed to get guys to close, it was sixty minutes.

[191:26] It was like, this is what you say to them.

[191:28] It wasn't psychology.

[191:29] It wasn't like, so we want to increase their demand.

[191:31] I was like, when they walk in the door, say this.

[191:34] And then after they agree, say the next thing.

[191:36] And if they don't agree, you don't move on until they agree.

[191:38] Then you go to the next thing.

[191:39] And then here's where you ask for money.

[191:42] That was it.

[191:43] Because I wasn't trying to make a course to oppress people.

[191:45] I was trying to make a training that got one result.

[191:48] And again, I did turn around for two years.

[191:50] And so like, I had to give stuff that to busy gym owners who hadn't paid me.

[191:54] Because the turnerum business they didn't pay me.

[191:56] So I had to make the training for them.

[191:58] Like, how do you do nutrition?

[191:59] Was 130 minute video.

[192:00] That was it.

[192:01] And I was like, this is the color template.

[192:03] Way them in.

[192:04] Divide their weight by 10, which means you just move the decimal.

[192:07] I like how to break it down.

[192:08] I was like, okay, so I'm using 21 food units.

[192:10] Put the first eight over here.

[192:12] This is all they're protein.

[192:13] And then you can tell them you can scatter the rest between carbs and fat.

[192:15] You just do the yellow list.

[192:17] Got it?

[192:18] Great.

[192:19] I have them take a picture with it in front of them.

[192:20] That way their numbers there put it against the wall like this.

[192:22] Like, there's just, there's nothing they could mess up.

[192:25] And because of that, because all the variables were controlled,

[192:28] they all got to consistently go to outcome.

[192:29] They just took a long time to do.

[192:31] Because I actually done it.

[192:33] That multiple locations.

[192:34] And then 30 plus turnerounds in different markets.

[192:36] So also when I get the customer who was like, this won't work in my market.

[192:40] I'm like, I've got five other gyms on your block.

[192:45] But people are very limited.

[192:46] You know, I had one of the gym turnerounds that I did.

[192:49] I launched the gym.

[192:50] This is important for your customers.

[192:52] I launched the guys gym.

[192:54] And when I decided to switch the licensing, I called back all the guys who I've done the turnerounds for.

[192:57] I was like, these will be the easiest.

[192:58] They literally saw me crack 100 grand out of their gym in three weeks.

[193:02] Cold one of the guys up and he's like, how do I know it's going to work?

[193:07] I was like, I just did it in front of you.

[193:10] Like, I, you saw me meet with 250 people.

[193:14] These are quite enough.

[193:15] It's going to work for me.

[193:17] And I was like, you will never win.

[193:19] But like some people are like that.

[193:22] And there's like, it's not worth the time.

[193:24] It's miserable.

[193:25] It's really specific situation.

[193:26] So like, so I started as a B2C offer, right?

[193:29] But my top 10% of guys who like really kill it or the agency owners usually stuck at certain range.

[193:33] And then I installed the closer infrastructure and all that stuff.

[193:36] How if I wanted to explore that and make that the 100% how would I deal with my existing 40 guys who got in at a B2C offer?

[193:42] Who have this like expectation.

[193:44] Like, that could like help.

[193:46] The B2C offer is what a make money up like a generic how to start an agency offer?

[193:50] Yeah.

[193:51] Yeah, I would get rid of those.

[193:55] Well, the same thing with us, right?

[193:57] Just like, again, LTV to cac.

[193:59] Like how much the cost to acquire them, how much like when people are trying to decide between

[194:03] Avertars, which by the way, the concern you have is that probably the number one most common concern that people have in business.

[194:08] It's also one of the biggest leverage points that you can have is picking the right Avertar.

[194:12] So you're in this overarching space of agency.

[194:16] But if you like almost always when you go up market, you make more money.

[194:20] Almost always.

[194:21] And so when you deal with somebody who's a higher quality prospect, they pay more.

[194:27] They're lower maintenance because they already have more skills coming into it.

[194:32] And so forth, right?

[194:33] And so if you just look at, because I had a Ida Harris along lady asked me this question.

[194:38] So she was like, I have I'm getting 17 to one.

[194:42] I started 24 to one selling.

[194:47] Parasidilus on my extension technique. So she had some extension technique that was like extensions are like two grand.

[194:53] And if you and she had a technique to do it in like 30 minutes.

[194:56] So they could make a ton of money in a very short period of time.

[194:59] And she's like, and I have business consulting or coaching or whatever, which has like 11 to one.

[195:05] LTV to cac.

[195:06] She was like, so should I focus on like my business coaching offer?

[195:09] Should I just sell this hair extension?

[195:12] Just like teaching how to do hair extensions, which is not really a business offer.

[195:15] Just like how to like a hair thing, right?

[195:18] And so I just boil it down to LTV to cac times tam.

[195:23] So it's like if you have crazy LTV to cac and you have a massive market, which she did,

[195:27] there's way more hair style to do a business coaching and just want to learn more about hair.

[195:31] So it's like you have both more customers and a bigger discrepancy between what it cost you and what you make.

[195:36] And so then the only thing is just end and if there is a massive market, then you can crank end is in the number of units sold by a ton.

[195:42] And so it's like, and from there you can cross out the coaching thing if you want to.

[195:45] The business consulting.

[195:46] But stop running to two front ends.

[195:48] Focus on this one. They have the greatest arbitrage on.

[195:51] Smash the shit out of that and then all your focus becomes on ascension and cross out.

[195:55] That makes sense. So for you, I would probably like, you're going to have to sunset the 40 guys over time.

[196:02] If you are better at delivering a result like go with the value is as in whoever you can help the absolute most is to I think you should sell to it.

[196:10] So if you're like, I have three different people I help. It's like, well, which of them, like this happens in.

[196:14] I'd a lady who had a tile business, so she sold tiles, like a very generic business.

[196:19] She's like, I sell to homeowners. I sell to designers, interior designers and I sell to home builders.

[196:25] Three completely separate avatars.

[196:27] And I was like, okay, which ones worth the most to you?

[196:31] She's like, well, home builders are pretty much just only care about price. I was like, okay, well, then maybe you don't sell to them.

[196:36] Interior designers, she's like, these people, they bring the customers all the time.

[196:41] Like, they come with their, their, their, their doing the living room for whatever.

[196:44] And then the, you know, the people who just own homes, he's like, they're, you know, they're kind of like one off sales, but they have the most margin.

[196:50] I was like, okay.

[196:53] I was like, which one do you like doing the most? She's like the interior designers.

[196:57] I was like, how many people does an interior designer bring you on average per year? She's like 30.

[197:01] I was like, okay. So she was calculating it at a transactional level rather than at the resident at the interior designer level.

[197:09] Like, so how is it cost you to get in, how does it get in?

[197:11] It's like, I do outreach for a week once a month and I get like three to five more interior designers who come in.

[197:18] I walk the facility and then I share them what we do.

[197:21] And this, I mean, this business was doing 7.6 million top line and like 5 million in EBITDA murdering it.

[197:29] And so it was like cool. So you now are the, the interior designer is now your avatar.

[197:36] So you need to become the interior designer to you, but you need to make their life amazing.

[197:40] Delta home builders, Delta home owners, just interior designers that are people that you've got on your roster.

[197:46] And then all you do is you go from having 30 interior designers that send you business all the time to 300.

[197:51] And that's it. And there's 300 interior designers every city.

[197:54] And so all she has to do is you already had a way to acquire them. I was like, forget everything else.

[197:57] So it's like you want to just like, stake through that and a lot of times that's where this massive unlock happens in businesses.

[198:03] Like, and most businesses go through this because you start throwing stuff on the wall.

[198:06] You start selling stuff. You start looking at the cost rise you have and then you're like, huh, really good at these people.

[198:11] I suck at these people. These ones are okay.

[198:13] And then you start making your delivery. You make it decisions for teaching you to say, no to this money.

[198:18] This is where people can't do it. This is why everyone fails. They can't say no to money.

[198:22] So you have to say no. So when the 41st person comes on the phone with you and it's like, hey, dude, I like really need this.

[198:28] Like, I'd love to have a way to, you know, make money online or whatever.

[198:32] You're like, you should just watch for most videos for free.

[198:34] And then start a business and when you have a business, call me.

[198:37] Okay. So like, I know my, I mean, what I'm best at is the acquisition fulfillment and the operations of existing agencies like my two best clients.

[198:45] You're course away for the money people. Give it away for free.

[198:48] Okay.

[198:50] Give it away for free. And then you'll be like, look, I've had 40 people pay me whatever they sold. You know, you paid it's like, and I just want to over deliver and value.

[198:55] I don't give it to you for free. And so use it because I really just want to work better with agency owners because the zero to one stuff.

[199:02] You can just just do it. Just do the work. It's not that hard. Once, like that way, you can self-prove that year legit.

[199:07] And then I will tell help you scale it from that.

[199:10] And then like tangible items like actually sunset them. Like, where does that even look like?

[199:15] How long was the sell for?

[199:18] The 40 how long did you sell them for? Was the duration?

[199:20] It was like, I was starting off. I was like an inner circle, just like six K. What, like lifetime.

[199:25] Right. So this is the problem with lifetime deals.

[199:28] Yeah. You have a one time, one time income with a forever delivery.

[199:32] Um, like right. So the real real, the ethical way to do it.

[199:37] refund. I think pulled about refund. So if I make this decision, just a hard conversation refund integrity restore.

[199:43] That's my stock. But okay.

[199:45] How many of them are there? How many? 40.

[199:49] I am.

[199:51] Send them to someone else, maybe.

[199:53] That way, are they still how long is it been?

[199:57] It's been like two months.

[199:59] Okay. I mean, I would like, this is the, like, this is the tough part, you know?

[200:05] Like, you either, I mean, the alternative is you. But like the thing that thing I don't like,

[200:10] because if you'd said it's a 12 week program that I would have been like,

[200:12] if I'd live it out, like, finish it out. But you're like lifetime.

[200:15] You're just going to have these people forever.

[200:17] Every month in, yeah.

[200:19] Yeah.

[200:20] Because it's at least going to meet 12 months. You got 10 months.

[200:23] You got to trade off like, you could probably get away with it if it had been a year.

[200:27] Yeah.

[200:28] But you were only just starting.

[200:30] Yeah.

[200:31] To go all in on school, I had to refide a calculation of how many of my mastermind members had to refund.

[200:37] I had to refund $2 million.

[200:41] To go all in on school.

[200:43] There was losing 700 grand a month.

[200:46] How about that?

[200:48] Did you say losing?

[200:50] Yeah.

[200:51] Because it not.

[200:52] I refunded 2 million to focus on something that was losing 700 grand a month.

[200:56] Day.

[200:57] Why?

[200:58] I don't know.

[201:00] Yeah.

[201:01] No.

[201:02] It's worth it.

[201:03] Like if you do all the math, it was a no brain now.

[201:06] Yeah.

[201:09] Positive deal.

[201:10] Yeah.

[201:11] It's just if you want to just play in the big league.

[201:12] I mean, the things these are mistakes.

[201:13] Like people make mistakes in the beginning.

[201:15] Life times easier to sell, but it's because you don't think about revifications.

[201:18] But saying no to money is always what?

[201:21] Yeah.

[201:22] Is the biggest thing that makes you like,

[201:24] that after I did that, I had a massive jump.

[201:28] Because I could focus on school.

[201:30] Right?

[201:31] Um, and, you know, people offer me like a lot of money too to go and like speak in an event.

[201:38] And probably no one here is much as homozy, but 100 grand in first class flights.

[201:42] You just say no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[201:45] Then you don't even bother saying no, you just don't even reply.

[201:48] Yeah.

[201:49] And that, if you don't have the discipline to do that, then you'll get pulled in a million

[201:55] direct ones.

[201:56] Also, when you feel that sting of the 240 grand, you have to give back.

[202:00] It'll help you say no to everything else.

[202:02] Because you're like, I just refunded all these people.

[202:04] I'm definitely not going to mess that up now.

[202:06] Like, I just spent all this money to get this attention back.

[202:09] Like, wow, I mess it up.

[202:10] Yeah, does something to feel like personal power or something.

[202:14] We don't say no to money.

[202:15] You don't need it.

[202:16] Yeah, you're like, you show, you, it does something to you.

[202:20] It gives you some kind of power.

[202:21] There's no better feeling than turning money down.

[202:23] I mean, making money is also pretty good.

[202:25] But, especially with clients, you don't like anymore.

[202:29] Yeah, right?

[202:30] I would prefer to never see you again.

[202:32] Here's your money.

[202:33] Yeah.

[202:34] Really?

[202:35] I got like a little taste of it because I was like, I'm like the gatekeeper of the main closures.

[202:38] So I didn't think I could coach the guy I'd be like, no.

[202:40] But, re-funding is a whole different kind of thing right there.

[202:43] Yeah.

[202:44] Totally.

[202:45] But you'll feel super convicted.

[202:46] And when you get on the phone with people, you'll be like, this is for agency owners.

[202:50] And I'll help you scale or whatever, whatever you're good at.

[202:52] And if you're not, they know like, that's why I have this thing.

[202:54] I used to sell it.

[202:55] I'll just give it to you, man.

[202:56] Just follow the steps.

[202:57] Realistically, though, you're probably not going to do it.

[203:02] So at least this way, you can save your eight grand, which I probably could have sold you.

[203:07] It's a big conviction that's sick.

[203:09] Sweet.

[203:10] I have the same thought as him because I have a program called Start and then scale.

[203:15] But...

[203:16] So out of the scale, people, if you're better at them, you like them better and they're worth more.

[203:19] Hunter, set.

[203:20] I did have a question.

[203:22] If it's better offline, that's cool.

[203:24] How do you, for instance, like somebody joins at 30 gets to 200?

[203:28] How do you market that testimonial without a financial claim?

[203:33] So how can I actively share these stories?

[203:37] So getting into the, like, needy gritty with FTC is beyond my scope.

[203:42] But for the most part, it comes down to timelines.

[203:44] That's the thing that, like, most of these platforms hate.

[203:47] It's like, X in Y time.

[203:49] But if you just say X, I thought about this quite a bit.

[203:54] Yeah.

[203:55] And I've noticed that the only people that ever get in trouble, they did way worse shit than make a claim.

[204:01] Right?

[204:02] Because I know the people that got in trouble and I know what was going on.

[204:06] And I'll tell you how it happens every single time.

[204:09] Yeah.

[204:10] It's, they don't give refunds.

[204:12] Yeah.

[204:13] Their disputes go up.

[204:14] They piss so many people off that enough complaint to the attorney general.

[204:18] Yeah.

[204:19] That eventually so many complaints go to the attorney general

[204:22] that they investigate them and then they find everything like the first thing to go

[204:28] is always you get kicked off of strike.

[204:30] Yeah.

[204:31] Wave that slate, the Canadian, the coal mine.

[204:33] No one that doesn't get kicked off strike, they never get in trouble.

[204:37] Even if they're making wild claims on ads.

[204:40] But then when these people get panked, they've got to like say,

[204:45] Oh, everyone's doing it.

[204:47] Everyone's breaking the rules.

[204:49] Because they're trying to show like that they're not criminal.

[204:52] Yeah.

[204:53] We just stepped on this little rock.

[204:54] The refunds thing is bar none, for sure.

[204:57] There was a guy, I'm sure we both know it.

[204:59] But who got dinged by the FTC.

[205:02] Dings a very nice way of saying it.

[205:04] And I knew for like, I was in a room like this because I was in the back room.

[205:09] And he was speaking at the same thing as me.

[205:11] So I kind of funny.

[205:13] And he was like, how do you guys like stop all these charge backs?

[205:17] I was like, what?

[205:19] He was like, yeah, all these people, like, they're just, these assholes are charging back.

[205:22] And I was like, well, I mean, as we don't have, we just refund people if they ask for it.

[205:26] He's like, oh, no, we don't do refunds.

[205:28] I was like, I mean, at all.

[205:30] He was like, we say no refunds.

[205:32] I was like, but you blurt, you actually don't give any refunds.

[205:35] He was like, oh, no.

[205:36] I also, I mean, Sam said this, I think like three a go.

[205:38] And I just love this is like, you don't want to become someone's project.

[205:41] Hmm.

[205:42] Like, you don't want someone waking up thinking like, how can I destroy sharks today?

[205:45] Like, how can I ruin this guy's life?

[205:47] Because because that six grand was the last six grand he had,

[205:50] and it meant a whole lot more to him than it does to you.

[205:53] So just give it, it means more to him.

[205:55] Just go get another crossword.

[205:57] But it's always worth it just giving money back.

[206:00] And they come back too.

[206:02] Like, we noticed that, they a lot of people come back

[206:05] when you didn't make a big deal about it.

[206:07] They're the vice of the else.

[206:08] Yeah.

[206:09] Because you know what it's like yourself.

[206:10] You buy something you ask for refunds, your little house,

[206:12] what's this going to be?

[206:13] And if it's easy, you're like damn, I like this company.

[206:17] Right?

[206:18] You know?

[206:19] Hmm.

[206:20] So planet fitness, believe we're not, I obviously have finished the table saying

[206:23] a lot of the big businesses there, but planet fitness figured this out, which is,

[206:27] so you might not know this, but planet fitness to make money has to have 10,000 members.

[206:31] Like a brick and mortar has to have 10,000 members to make money.

[206:34] And they still prank.

[206:36] And they can do that in a market that only has 50,000 people in total,

[206:40] which is insane to think about.

[206:42] But they don't have like zero turn.

[206:44] They have like 5% monthly turn, which is, you're like, wait a second, how would you do that?

[206:48] They cycle through the entire town over and over and over again.

[206:53] And so what they figured out was rather than being like the dicks on the way out,

[206:56] they said they call the friendly goodbye.

[206:58] And so it's like, they're like, oh, you want to cancel?

[207:00] No problem, Steve.

[207:01] No worries.

[207:02] Let us know when you're, you know, you want to come back.

[207:04] Like, we'll get you going.

[207:05] Like very friendly on the exit.

[207:07] And so then Steve, when he like gets the next gig or gets the next job or feels

[207:11] fat again or whatever it is, he signs back up because it was no big deal.

[207:15] Also crazy how many people don't actually use the membership.

[207:20] They pay for it and they go.

[207:22] 92% don't use the membership.

[207:24] Yeah, it's only, it's only with the business model works.

[207:26] If they did, they'd have to charge $100,000.

[207:28] We'll have to be a bit.

[207:29] Yeah, it wouldn't be room.

[207:31] Yeah, I mean, the reason microgms are priced that way is because people use the membership.

[207:35] And it's the same scratch.

[207:37] So like, like the worst thing that, and so like, I mean,

[207:40] an acrid talk about finance finance, but I'll stop.

[207:43] How would you choose between the friendly goodbye?

[207:46] And then the one that he mentioned where it's like,

[207:48] if you leave, you have to pay the entry fee to come back.

[207:51] Those are different.

[207:52] One is a refund.

[207:53] One is like someone trying to cancel,

[207:55] which I see is separate things.

[207:56] One say, hey, I want to cancel your service.

[207:58] One is like, I paid you.

[207:59] Please give me my money back.

[208:01] It's not very friendly to say you can't come back.

[208:03] Yeah.

[208:04] If it's a little bit of a mess, it's not a good thing.

[208:07] Because someone can just make another account.

[208:09] How are you going to know it?

[208:10] Well, for high ticket, I can imagine.

[208:12] But like, I just would, I mean, I've all the people that I know who have done it

[208:16] and don't have good communities, it does nothing.

[208:18] If you have a great community, then it matters,

[208:20] but then doesn't matter at all because the great community is the reason that it happens.

[208:23] So, till the hour, I don't know if the tactic does anything.

[208:26] I remember I had this on a way smaller scale.

[208:28] It was like my second close, like 10k, and it was all excited.

[208:31] And you go on, he's on the coaching call and he just wouldn't knock on doors.

[208:34] He's trying it for 30 minutes because one thing he teaches door to door marketing to book jobs.

[208:38] So, I was really hesitant on what to do.

[208:40] And I just just bring down the energy.

[208:42] So, I let him out of the group or a fun to them.

[208:44] And then I posted my free Facebook group.

[208:46] Hey, how to climb?

[208:47] Wasn't really ready to knock on doors.

[208:48] If any of you guys are actually willing to do this, if you have a spot open.

[208:51] And it brought my ideal clients actually book close four off that post.

[208:55] You're like, in every week, you're like, I had a spot open up because...

[208:59] Yeah.

[209:00] Yeah.

[209:01] Not many of them spent in tumultruth.

[209:02] I got one question about, like, I've heard you guys talk about like off boarding.

[209:07] In your usual, like, you know, like, take in, you know, somebody wants to, you know,

[209:10] wants to cancel their membership or want to refer refund.

[209:12] You're like, yeah, for sure, just doing an interview, right?

[209:14] Is there any way we could maybe get that going on in school?

[209:17] Like, whenever somebody churns, like, obviously, like, it's hard to get them on the phone, right?

[209:21] You know, at that point, but I'd love to, like, figure out maybe that at some point.

[209:26] Like, oh, yeah, you want to cancel tool.

[209:27] Press this button.

[209:28] Just go to an appointment.

[209:29] How do we talk?

[209:30] I think they have to be able to cancel easily, but I think...

[209:33] Yeah, they have to be able to cancel easily, but I think you could encourage them to take

[209:37] call after the cancellation track resound them.

[209:38] Can we do a Zapyre integration for the cancellation?

[209:41] This is the...

[209:42] We would just say cancel.

[209:43] And what our DM would probably be the best.

[209:45] A lot of DM.

[209:46] Yeah.

[209:47] I've noticed that Zapyre integration, the Zapyre integration feature was amazing.

[209:51] By the way, but we started doing this one of our communities with people joined and we immediately

[209:55] went to a local welcome call, and then we just like immediately upsold them.

[209:58] It does really well.

[209:59] All the new customers in?

[210:00] Yeah.

[210:01] Oh, yeah.

[210:02] Yeah.

[210:03] That crush is just for everybody, by the way.

[210:05] If you let people come in and just give them an onboarding call, it's...

[210:09] I mean, think about what an onboarding call really is.

[210:11] It's like, what are your goals?

[210:12] What if you struggle with?

[210:14] Where are you at currently?

[210:15] What do you, like, why have you succeeded so far?

[210:17] Oh, I think we might have some things for you.

[210:20] It's just like it just led to itself naturally to a sales call.

[210:23] You can do an auto DM as well if you have a strong peripheral offer.

[210:26] You can put it into auto DM when they join.

[210:28] And like, who wants to do you know, but without you'll get this if you refer somebody.

[210:32] So that, you know, you set it up once and you can have literally like,

[210:35] extra 10% for free if you have a strong peripheral offer.

[210:40] And once they fill it, things will be more.

[210:43] Thank you.

[210:44] Just going back on that single stream or what you're good at.

[210:48] One thing we have is we have that physical academy.

[210:51] So what I was one of my questions earlier was about how would you integrate school platform into the physical.

[211:00] You know, just random thoughts.

[211:04] But then because I think our school academy has done by far, you know,

[211:13] mostly better than physical.

[211:18] What do you think?

[211:19] Integrating.

[211:20] Teaching.

[211:21] I mean, I think the in person members joining.

[211:24] I mean, you could, if you want to give a gift to the in person members,

[211:28] you could actually, I don't know if they can have a different membership.

[211:30] So now, they probably just join like anybody else would and it would just be a benefit to them

[211:35] because they know you in person.

[211:36] Is it digital or are you making more money?

[211:39] Yeah.

[211:40] They're kind of like how we're doing this and school HQ.

[211:44] So we've got almost these HQ.

[211:46] We've got school HQ for the power uses in the online world.

[211:50] We bring it offline and we let them come in like this.

[211:55] And that can produce content back for the like online.

[211:59] So you use it as a reward.

[212:02] Yeah.

[212:03] Yeah.

[212:04] You can charge for it or you can use it as a reward for like what we do here.

[212:07] We're not charged for it, but it's a reward.

[212:09] But you absolutely like as a side note, if you wanted to make even like,

[212:12] if you wanted the in person to generate more money and leverage kind of like both together,

[212:17] give them an offer to have a weekend with you.

[212:20] I mean like when I had the you have it, it's not a martial arts, right?

[212:23] Yeah.

[212:24] So I would do like weekend workshops, right?

[212:26] We're going to do a deadlift.

[212:27] You know, we're going to do the big three lifts for powerlifting this weekend.

[212:31] So anybody wants to come to that cool.

[212:33] I do like big booty boot camp for girls and they always wanted to teach them like a different like

[212:37] moves for butt stuff because they always want to know butt stuff.

[212:40] I do, um, I would basically just bring in specialists for stuff and then I would either

[212:44] then I would just market it to my community and say that they could pay, you know,

[212:48] grand or two grand or something for the, for the weekend.

[212:51] I mean, you know, no the price one better than me, but probably, I mean, you could probably get away

[212:54] with between $300 and $2,000 in terms of two days for them to come in and you spend two days with them.

[213:02] And you get ton of footage, you literally make money for it.

[213:05] You can get ads for your local gym, you can get ads for online all from that one.

[213:09] And that I actually think it's a huge advantage that you have the in person component because you can do stuff that

[213:16] no one else can do.

[213:18] Level seven in school community is visit school HQ the prize.

[213:22] Like, once you get to level seven in school community, you get to visit school HQ.

[213:27] And then in the games, it's getting the top 10 and you get to come to homo's HQ.

[213:33] It's the best prize on both leaderboards.

[213:36] It creates this, because in the digital world, everything seems kind of fake.

[213:40] So if there's some HQ that people get to visit and you start to see photos of this place,

[213:46] it gives people like something they can visualize like I can eventually go there.

[213:52] Right?

[213:53] And it works really well and you can use it in your marketing and all of us.

[213:57] I can guarantee you that if you make a post in your community saying that you're doing a workshop that you're limiting to 30 people.

[214:03] How many people do you have in your community?

[214:05] For you?

[214:06] What?

[214:07] The paid one.

[214:08] Pay 30.

[214:10] Yeah, so I mean you could do it on the free one if you wanted to because then you could just sell them at the event if you felt like it.

[214:15] But I think it makes more sense to do it to the paid one and just do a higher ticket thing from the paid.

[214:19] And so if you have 200, that's perfect.

[214:21] So that'll probably, you'll probably get like 30ish people who'd be willing to do it.

[214:26] And so do 30, you know, between 300, it's meditation system.

[214:31] Like 300 to a grand, probably feels about right.

[214:34] You can pick the pricing, start low on the first one and then move it up if you want to.

[214:37] If it's like, people are like, that was amazing.

[214:39] Follow what we want.

[214:40] And it's like, you can just do that once a quarter.

[214:43] So every 12 weeks or so.

[214:45] And just like that, you can pop an extra like 80 or 100 grand a year.

[214:48] And like, and but like you're not just doing it for money, you get all the other stuff.

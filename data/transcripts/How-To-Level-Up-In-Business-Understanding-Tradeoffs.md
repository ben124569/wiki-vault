[00:00] What's going on everyone?

[00:01] Want to tell you a story that maybe applicable to you,

[00:03] if you're an existing entrepreneur, a new entrepreneur,

[00:06] or somebody's about to make a big decision in life.

[00:09] Yesterday, I had a conversation that transpired

[00:12] between me and an 18 year old,

[00:14] who's now a freshman in college.

[00:17] And I think I wish I could have recorded it,

[00:19] but there were a lot of decision points and lessons

[00:22] and thought processes that we walk through together,

[00:25] that I think will be valuable for many,

[00:27] because it's the same decision-making process

[00:30] whether you're making a multi-million dollar decision

[00:33] or you're making a relationship decision or whatever it is.

[00:37] And so this 18 year old kid is my neighbor,

[00:41] I think I've referenced them before.

[00:42] And he's entrepreneurial, he did a little car washing business,

[00:45] he's done a little e-commerce business

[00:48] that he started on his own.

[00:49] And it's worked out pretty decently while for him.

[00:52] But because of the pressures that he's had on himself

[00:55] and from outside, he decided he had to do college.

[00:58] And so he started his first semester in college,

[01:00] and to make a long story short,

[01:02] he did something he wasn't supposed to do,

[01:04] and now he's in trouble,

[01:05] and that made jeopardize his future in college.

[01:07] And so he's obviously really rect about this.

[01:10] And so I said, hey, let's go for a walk.

[01:13] And so on this walk, I said, you know, what's your plan?

[01:16] He's what I think I'm, you know,

[01:18] I think I'm gonna try and fight this thing

[01:21] and give college another shot.

[01:24] And I wanted to walk him through this,

[01:30] because I wanted him to make any decision

[01:32] for the right reasons, right?

[01:34] And so I said, you know, do you think,

[01:37] like what's the outcome you wanna have

[01:39] from giving another shot at college?

[01:42] Because he didn't really like high school that much.

[01:45] He's like, well, you know, I just wanna give it a try.

[01:48] And I was like, okay, again,

[01:50] what do you wanna have happen,

[01:51] or what do you think is going to happen?

[01:53] What is the positive outcome

[01:54] that you're potentially looking forward

[01:55] to the negative outcome that you think could happen?

[01:58] He's like, well, honestly, I don't know.

[02:02] And I was like, okay, now we're getting somewhere.

[02:05] So do you think that taking, you know,

[02:08] genders literature studies

[02:10] and history of ass-tech culture, whatever,

[02:14] is gonna be more interesting to you now

[02:16] than the stuff that you studied in high school,

[02:18] which was again, general literature,

[02:21] is that gonna be interesting to you?

[02:22] It's like, well, probably not.

[02:24] And I was like, okay, then what's the real reason

[02:26] that you wanna go to college?

[02:28] It's like, well, you know, I feel like I'm a kid

[02:30] and I should experience having fun

[02:33] and all that kind of stuff.

[02:33] And I was like, okay, having fun's fine.

[02:37] Do you feel like you can have fun

[02:40] without going to college?

[02:41] Do you think that you could not spend

[02:43] 200,000 dollars in four years of your life

[02:45] and still have fun in that same period of time?

[02:47] If you weren't at college, but still with other people

[02:50] who are your age, I was like, well, yeah, I guess so.

[02:52] I was like, okay, cool.

[02:55] Then I'm assuming that's not the only reason

[02:57] you wanna go to college.

[02:58] What else is there?

[03:00] You started thinking, he's like, honestly,

[03:01] I don't really know.

[03:03] And so to give you a little bit more context

[03:06] before what I told him next, I asked him,

[03:10] what do you think,

[03:11] like, is he's starting a new,

[03:13] on-term, or if they think right now with real estate

[03:15] and he hasn't, he hasn't cracked it yet, right?

[03:19] And so I said, do you think it's possible

[03:21] that you want to go to college

[03:23] because it's a socially acceptable shield

[03:26] for you not being successful in entrepreneurship?

[03:29] Do you think that that might be a reason?

[03:31] Because if you're in college, then you,

[03:34] you're not seen as a failure if you're not

[03:37] winning at the thing that you're doing, right?

[03:39] It's your side hustle, it's your side gig.

[03:43] Things like, well, maybe, yeah.

[03:46] I think first off, you know,

[03:48] Kudos to him for being able to realize and admit that,

[03:50] but I think that that was, is such a core issue

[03:53] for many of us, is that we present

[03:56] these socially acceptable solutions to ourselves

[03:59] when deep down the reason that we're doing them

[04:01] is not for the right reason.

[04:03] And so in this instance, he's using it as a foil

[04:06] to protect himself against having to confront

[04:10] the realities of life, of business, of the marketplace,

[04:13] of not being good enough, right?

[04:15] Yet.

[04:16] And so I said, all right, what do you want to have

[04:19] happened in your life?

[04:21] Do you think you want to have a job?

[04:23] And he was like, no, I don't want to have a job.

[04:24] I was like, what do you want to do?

[04:25] He's like, I want to have my own business.

[04:27] And I was like, what do you think business school

[04:29] looks like in the real world?

[04:31] He was like, well, probably doing business.

[04:33] I was like, okay, so if you have four years

[04:36] and $200,000, if you invest that in college,

[04:40] versus investing $200,000 in four years into learning,

[04:44] into trying to start your own business,

[04:46] which of them after four years do you think

[04:48] will get you closer to your goal?

[04:51] He was like, well, probably the business one.

[04:52] And I was like, okay, so then right now,

[04:55] what you have is a clear logical outcome

[04:58] in terms of which decision path to make.

[05:01] But then now we have to start looking at

[05:03] what's the emotional driver that's preventing me

[05:05] from doing it, right?

[05:07] And so for him, going on in means making the first real trade-off

[05:14] is never made in life, right?

[05:16] Because if you were newer or you have a job

[05:18] or you're, it doesn't matter where you're at in your life,

[05:20] there are a lot of times, especially when we're younger,

[05:23] there's fewer big branch points, right?

[05:26] But as we get older, we have to commit and trade off

[05:31] something else, right?

[05:32] It's this for that.

[05:33] And I think, excuse me, sorry.

[05:36] I think that a lot of times we have to frame these things

[05:38] in terms of the things that we're willing to sacrifice.

[05:40] And so I told him the story of when I was starting my gym,

[05:46] the mindset that I approached it with was,

[05:49] I will not outwork everyone, but instead,

[05:53] I will out-sacrifice anyone.

[05:55] And so what I meant by that is,

[05:57] I'm willing to put everything and anything that I have

[06:00] on the altar of my success.

[06:03] And that's what I started from a mindset standpoint.

[06:05] So I wasn't like, I'm gonna be smarter,

[06:07] I'm gonna do something else.

[06:08] I just knew that any time my competitors

[06:11] or other people were going out or they were seeing friends

[06:15] or playing video games or watching football games

[06:17] they used to do all the time before I started a business.

[06:22] Or sleeping in or just all the many things,

[06:25] even honestly, my fitness even suffered during that period of time.

[06:27] That's thing, it's perfect, but I'm saying,

[06:28] I was willing to do, I was willing to sacrifice anything

[06:32] to get to where I wanted to go.

[06:34] And I introduced that kind of concept to him of like,

[06:37] you tell me you want these things,

[06:40] and yet when it comes time to sacrifice

[06:43] to pay the paper to make the trade-offs

[06:46] that are necessary to have that outcome,

[06:50] that's when you're faltering.

[06:52] And so, are you willing to sacrifice

[06:56] for the things that you want in the long run?

[06:58] And I was like, because he's my neighbor

[07:00] and we live in a nice neighborhood.

[07:01] And it's like, I'm the age I am and we live here.

[07:04] I was like, I sacrificed my 20s.

[07:06] I'm straight up, I sacrificed them.

[07:08] And I'm not saying it's the right path,

[07:10] but I want to make sure that whatever decision you make,

[07:13] you make it for the right reasons.

[07:14] If you want to go for four years in college, do it.

[07:18] By all means, but understand the reason you're doing it

[07:21] is because you believe that four years of

[07:23] from college and spending $200,000 is the best use

[07:27] of your time.

[07:29] And then, having the story that you'll have to tell yourself

[07:34] about the type of person who makes these types of decisions,

[07:37] and then you'll have to live with that.

[07:38] Because the thing is, the stories that we tell ourselves

[07:40] are create the identity that we have, right?

[07:43] When my favorite scenes in Matrix is in the third one,

[07:46] I know people don't like the second and third, I like all three,

[07:49] is when Morphe's is standing in front of all of humanity.

[07:52] And he says, I can tell you that I are staying here

[07:56] truthfully on a freight, not because of the path that lies

[08:00] before us, but because of the path that lies behind me.

[08:05] And I think that such a deep message,

[08:09] because where we are is because of the stories

[08:12] that we have that have led us to be who we've become.

[08:15] And when we make these choices, I think just as important,

[08:18] if not more important, is the story that we are telling ourselves

[08:21] about why we made the choices and what that tells us

[08:24] about who we are.

[08:26] And so, I wanted to clarify to the decision for him

[08:29] in terms of, is this what you want, yes or no,

[08:31] of these two paths, which one will get you closer to that thing?

[08:35] Yes, like this one or this one?

[08:36] Cool, now why are you not making it?

[08:39] Which now goes from logic to emotion.

[08:41] And then at that point saying, okay, I think we've

[08:44] had discovered the root issue, which is that your afraid

[08:46] is being seen as a failure if you're not immediately successful.

[08:50] And so, what I wanted to give to him was, if you fail,

[08:54] it does not make you a failure, it means that you failed.

[08:58] And part of entrepreneurship is failure

[09:00] and being able to deal with failure

[09:02] and how you come back from failure.

[09:04] And I said, right now, you're in this instance,

[09:05] where this is the first real big hit life is ever given you.

[09:08] Right, everything's relative, but in his life,

[09:10] at this moment, this is the biggest thing,

[09:12] worst things ever happened to him.

[09:14] Right, this bad issue that he had it with his school.

[09:17] And so I said, the story that you now get to tell us

[09:20] what you do from here, right?

[09:22] Do you use this as the catalyst to realize that you actually

[09:26] don't aren't interested in the school stuff

[09:28] and you never have been.

[09:29] And if I always wanted to do the entrepreneur thing,

[09:31] but it's been a side hustle, you've never fully committed

[09:33] to it.

[09:34] I was like, is that the story you want to tell?

[09:37] Or do you want to go and try and fight this thing

[09:40] and try and beat it and then spend another three and a half

[09:43] year spending more money and then be another 3.1 student

[09:47] that graduates from Pepperdine, right?

[09:52] Which one is the story that you want to tell?

[09:54] And so I wanted to share the story with you

[09:58] because I don't know where you're at

[09:59] or what decisions you're facing.

[10:01] But I think there was a lot of many things

[10:03] that we kind of covered in that conversation

[10:05] and unearthed.

[10:06] And so many of us know what we need to do,

[10:08] but have some emotional trigger that's stopping us from doing it.

[10:11] And I think digging deep and saying,

[10:13] like, what am I afraid of happening?

[10:15] What's my biggest fear?

[10:18] Because if I know this is what I need to do,

[10:19] then why am I not doing it?

[10:21] And I think if you can simply name the fear

[10:24] of what you are afraid of, it allows you to face it

[10:26] and it removes the power it has over you

[10:28] because then you have clarity.

[10:30] And then it's simply,

[10:32] am I willing to let my fear of failure stop me?

[10:36] From having what I want to eventually have in my life,

[10:39] or would I rather let that have me walk down a path

[10:42] that never actually helps me realize my potential?

[10:45] And so when you think about a maybe versus a never,

[10:49] then I'll take a maybe over a never any day of the week.

[10:52] And so like I said, I don't know where you're at.

[10:54] I don't know what trade-offs you're facing.

[10:56] I don't know what sacrifices you may have to make

[10:57] in order to get to where you want to go.

[11:00] But I think literally listing those things out

[11:02] of what you are willing to give up.

[11:04] There was a point in my life where I wrote down all the things

[11:07] that I had to additionally give up

[11:08] because I was at a point in just rubber meeting the road

[11:10] and I had to push harder.

[11:12] And this was probably three or four years

[11:13] in my entrepreneurial journey.

[11:15] And I remember making this video about that

[11:18] where I actively gave up football in Sundays,

[11:23] which was like a thing that I enjoyed watching.

[11:26] I know that I gave up all TV of all kinds,

[11:29] even like the wind down TV.

[11:32] I gave up any kind of going out.

[11:35] And I'm not saying that you have to do that.

[11:37] I'm just saying that that's what I did.

[11:39] And I know that this kid's father was like,

[11:42] hey, you need to have balance.

[11:44] You need to be able to enjoy life for still young.

[11:47] And my father, when I was younger,

[11:50] really hit on that really hard.

[11:52] And I really pushed back.

[11:53] And I still pretty much do.

[11:56] Because I don't believe that anything great

[11:58] was ever accomplished by someone who's balanced.

[12:01] I think that it takes extremes.

[12:02] It takes extreme effort.

[12:03] It takes unreasonable sacrifice

[12:05] in order to achieve things that are unreasonable.

[12:08] And so, you know, and I was telling him yesterday,

[12:12] the kid, not my dad.

[12:14] If you were competing against someone else

[12:18] who was a coder, you guys are both coding software, right?

[12:20] I was like, and you're going to college,

[12:22] you're having fun, you're going out on weekends,

[12:23] and you know, you code a couple hours a day.

[12:26] Versus the kid who drops out of college,

[12:29] code 16 hours a day, doesn't go out.

[12:32] It doesn't see his friends.

[12:33] Just codes for three and a half years.

[12:35] I was like, who do you think will be further along?

[12:37] And I was like, well, the other kid.

[12:39] And I was like, right, I was like, how much further along?

[12:41] He was like, probably a lot further.

[12:43] I was like, right, do you think it's reasonable

[12:45] or unreasonable that he would be further ahead than you?

[12:47] He was like reasonable.

[12:49] And I was like, so why would you not want to take

[12:50] the reasonable bet that you will be so much further ahead

[12:53] by making that choice?

[12:55] And so, all that to say, I don't know any people

[12:59] who are really successful who don't approach things

[13:01] in an unbalanced way.

[13:03] And I think that there's a differentiation

[13:04] between seasons and your entire life.

[13:07] What you do for a season of life

[13:09] doesn't have to be forever, but sometimes it does have

[13:12] to be for that season.

[13:13] And sometimes you are uneven.

[13:15] And so sometimes it's difficult to look at what I do now

[13:19] versus what I did to get here.

[13:21] If I sacrificed my fitness for periods of time.

[13:26] I'm not saying it was good.

[13:27] I'm just saying I did.

[13:29] There were times where I did not sleep as much

[13:31] as I probably should have.

[13:33] There were times where I did not see,

[13:34] I didn't do anything social at all for a month.

[13:37] I'm not saying it was right.

[13:39] I'm just saying that's what ended up happening.

[13:41] And when I hear stories of many people

[13:42] who kind of go through the shit, who go through their rocky

[13:45] ball bow up period, the rocky cutscene,

[13:48] almost every hyper-successful person that I've seen

[13:51] goes through a three to five-year period

[13:54] where they just get hit in the face day after day, after day,

[13:57] after day.

[13:58] Some of the great marketers, some of you guys may have heard of,

[14:01] Russell Brunson pitched for five straight years on stages

[14:04] unknown before he became Russell Brunson.

[14:06] Billie Jean did cold calling for two, three years.

[14:09] Jean Kennedy did face-to-face, durdador sales for three years.

[14:13] I did 4,000 101 consultations over four-year period

[14:17] selling fitness, doing 15, 20 appointments a day.

[14:20] And the thing is, is I wasn't Alex Ramozzi then.

[14:23] I was just a dude who was selling

[14:24] and just getting better and better.

[14:26] And the thing is that there's this unreasonable amount

[14:28] of effort, this unreasonable amount of sacrifice

[14:29] that usually has to go in to get the unreasonable goal.

[14:32] And yet people are not willing to make the sacrifice

[14:34] to do it.

[14:35] And so I think if we can simply look at what is the decision

[14:37] that's going to get me to where I want to go,

[14:39] which of these do I think will be better?

[14:41] And then what is the sacrifice that's required?

[14:43] And am I willing to make that sacrifice

[14:45] that I think it makes much simpler decisions?

[14:48] And we know why we're making this decisions we are

[14:50] so that the decisions are not made for us by life.

[14:53] So anyways, I hope that was valid before you.

[14:55] It was just half of mine because I had the conversation yesterday

[14:58] and I thought, man, I wish I had recorded this.

[15:01] But I don't know where you're at in your life

[15:02] and I don't know what decisions you're facing

[15:03] but hopefully this provides you for you.

[15:05] So lots of love keeping amazing.

[15:06] And I'll catch you next vid.

[15:08] Bye.

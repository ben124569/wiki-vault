[00:00] If you want to build a business that you can eventually sell, this video is for you.

[00:03] I've built and sold nine companies that the last one I sold was 46.2 million.

[00:08] And so I'm just drawing on my experience from selling those to different partners, competitors,

[00:12] private equity, strategic buyers, so that can tell you the things that I've learned, so that you can

[00:16] get there much faster than it took me. There was a guy who had rental events. So basically,

[00:21] he started an event business where he would, he basically have a venue that he would rent.

[00:25] And he'd have two, three events a week there and he would charge whatever the day rate is

[00:32] for the event and that would be more than what his rent was. And that was the entire business.

[00:36] And so he had three locations. He sold those and then he started a coaching business or an education

[00:43] business around helping other people find events bases, rent them out, do the same thing they

[00:47] eat it. And so he was like, hey, I want to sell this business the way that you sold too much.

[00:53] And after talking to him, I was like, dude, I think you're going about this all wrong.

[00:58] You're trying to sell the goose when you should be trying to sell the eggs. And this will be the

[01:02] common theme throughout this is that most people are trying to sell the goose rather than sell the eggs.

[01:05] And you never want to sell the goose. You want to keep the goose and let it keep laying golden eggs.

[01:09] Right? So that you can keep selling them. And for those of you don't know the story of the the

[01:12] goose and the golden egg, I'll read it to you. It's two seconds. There was once a countryman

[01:16] who possessed the most wonderful goose, you can imagine. For every day when he visited the nest,

[01:19] the goose had laid a beautiful glittering golden egg. The countryman took the eggs to the market

[01:23] soon began to get rich, but it was not long before he grew impatient with the goose because

[01:26] she only gave him one egg a day. He was not getting rich fast enough. Then one day after he had

[01:31] finished counting his money, the idea came to him they could get all the golden eggs at once by killing

[01:35] the goose and cutting it open. But when the deed was done, not a single golden egg did he find,

[01:38] and his precious golden goose was dead. There's something that creates value and then there's the

[01:42] thing that is value bull. And so figuring out which of the things that you have in your business is the

[01:47] goose and which of them is the eggs is one of the highest leverings that you can do because

[01:51] you can build towards the exit and intelligently. And so in this business, I was like, hey man,

[01:56] you're getting all these people on using your systems and your processes and your price points.

[02:03] I was like, you're doing all the work that a roll up would have to do if they acquired a bunch of

[02:07] these businesses. I was like, you're doing it up front. And so why don't you know this ahead of time and

[02:14] I want to build so that I can have the hundred or 500 or 1000 of my students who are using

[02:19] my system for doing events spaces, I should use all of those guys and I should set it up ahead of

[02:26] time saying, hey, use these colors and use these systems and use these price points. And in the future

[02:33] if you're successful, if you're the top 10% of the students here, I have an opportunity where you can

[02:38] roll up and sell with me in a group of 20 or 50 of these. And so here's the thing, if that's the business

[02:45] model, then you can just roll up 20 to 50 every other year and have a massive exit while you

[02:51] still keep the goose that brings those people in. And the thing is that the goose often is incredibly

[02:55] valuable but not sellable. And that's what's that's the difficult part about this, right? And I'll give you

[02:59] a counter example. So for me, acquisition.com is my goose, right? Like am I going to sell acquisition.com?

[03:05] Not really, there are some things that I'll talk about in a second about like transactions you can

[03:09] have at the goose level. But what really makes sense for me is for me to sell the eggs for me to sell

[03:13] the subsidiaries, for me to sell the companies that acquisition.com invests in, right? So the big

[03:19] picture is understanding what is your goose and what your eggs? So I'll give you different story.

[03:22] So I had a dude who was saying he had a couple Amazon stories, you'll notice this is recurring theme.

[03:26] He had a couple Amazon stores and he did well with those and he sold the Amazon stores and he started

[03:31] teaching people how to, you know, to start and build Amazon, Amazon stores. And I was like,

[03:35] okay, he's like, so I want to potentially sell this company. And I was like, well, the thing is

[03:39] is that this business isn't very recurring. It's not very sticky. It has huge key man risk with you

[03:44] being the face of it. Like not a lot of investors would A, want to buy it or B if they did, they

[03:48] wouldn't be a lot of money for it. I was like, so why don't you think about a way to get all these

[03:53] people that you're helping start Amazon stores, bundled together so that they become a sellable asset.

[03:59] Because the thing is is like, just like the event business, that guy had already sold three of the

[04:03] venues. We know they're sellable businesses. They're very straightforward. They're faceless.

[04:06] Like they're relatively turn key. Same thing with Amazon stores. Like they're faceless. Like

[04:11] another investor can say, okay, how much is it cost? What's my, you know, what's my yield? What's my

[04:15] return going to be over time? Okay. And like these are very sellable things. And so it takes a lot less

[04:20] effort to take something that is already very sellable and just think, how can I do way more of

[04:24] them or how can I make them bigger? Rather than trying to take something that inherently has a ton

[04:28] of key man risk isn't recurring. Has a lot of volatility in terms of acquisition. Like all

[04:35] of those things make it not very attractive to a potential investor. Real quick, if you want to sell

[04:40] your company or make it into a sellable business, acquisition.com just started our workshop division

[04:44] for companies that we don't own, which is just walking through the process that we do to build

[04:48] significantly more valuable companies at an accelerated pace. We have it here at our headquarters in

[04:52] Vegas. And so if that sounds interesting, you could acquisition.com, hit scale and follow the steps.

[04:56] And if you qualify, our guys will be in touch. So let's get to actual for a second. How do you

[05:00] figure this out with your business? So the first thing is is that is there something that's

[05:06] dependent on you? Everything that is dependent on you for the business, it's inherently going to be

[05:11] significantly less valuable. Number one, number two, is there a component of your business or of your

[05:16] customer's businesses that's very stickier recurring? So for example, gyms, micro gyms for gyms,

[05:22] intrinsically, they don't get sold very often. So there's not a market for small service-based

[05:28] facilities, like personal training studios, things like that. A lot of people don't want to buy that

[05:31] why, because they have key men risk at their level two, right? Whereas if I had, if I were helping

[05:37] franchise chains of restaurants like subway, you know, improve their profitability, then there would be a

[05:43] clear exit path because franchise that are existing trade all the time, same thing for accounting

[05:48] firms because they have high revenue retention. And so basically, if you look at all the different

[05:52] things that exist in your business, whether it looks at your customers, you look at different

[05:55] service lines that you offer within your business, and then the overarching business itself,

[06:00] one of those things should have some level of revenue that sticky and that doesn't require a face.

[06:07] And there's a lot of other factors, but if I had to like pick a couple, those would be two,

[06:12] that would be really important that I'd be trying to sus a pool apart to figure out what is the

[06:16] egg and what is the goose. In the easiest way to know if you're right about this is looking for

[06:22] M&A activity. So mergers and acquisitions activity for that type of business. So if you look, if you

[06:26] Google like coaching business, M&A activity, one, it'll show you how much there is. And if you don't find

[06:33] a lot, then you'll be like, okay, maybe there isn't a big market for this. Number one, number two,

[06:37] if you do find some, what is the difference between those businesses and my business? And then you'll

[06:41] be able to bridge the gap and say, oh, these are the things that these buyers like, not these

[06:46] other things. And then you can start orienting your effort and your business model around,

[06:49] the things that investors have proven that they like, what I don't want to go is trying

[06:54] sell a product to a market that doesn't exist. So you have to zoom all the way back out and think

[06:58] of your business as a product and an investor or potential acquire as a customer. And so somebody

[07:03] might listen to this and say, okay, well, what about Jim launch? Jim launch was that type of business.

[07:07] Well, one thing is that Jim launch was really dangerously close to being a franchise. And so I

[07:11] knew what franchise laws were. And so I purposely like name system fee by the way is what you

[07:16] need to be a franchise name as an every reason of the same name system, every one of your same

[07:20] systems and there's a fee associated. And so if you have all three, you have a franchise and if you

[07:24] don't have a franchise and you're doing all three of those things, you have an illegal franchise,

[07:28] which means you actually subject to getting sued and all that kind of stuff. And so if you're in the

[07:32] business of helping people do a specific type of business, you either have to pick a name and

[07:37] system with no fee, which must be one too, right? But you could do that. You go name and fee,

[07:42] like CrossFit, for example, like they have a name and there's a fee, but they give no business

[07:46] systems, right? Or you go systems and fee, but no name, right? Which was Jim launch. We didn't tell

[07:51] everyone that they had to unify under one flag. Now, one of my potential ideas that I was thinking

[07:55] about for Jim launch and the future was maybe I will start a franchise off the side of it.

[07:59] And with the best people I'll plug them into there. Now, and that will be covered under franchise law,

[08:04] but the reason that Jim launch was solable is that the big things that everybody needed, which

[08:09] is that key man was removed. So I was no longer involved in the delivery. I was no longer involved in

[08:13] the ads. I had a leadership team in place, right? All of those things. The recurring revenue,

[08:18] it is recurring revenue business. We did have relatively good annual retention of customers.

[08:23] And we had multiple acquisition channels. And over time, I grew Jim launch to be bigger than me at the

[08:29] time. And here's a nugget that people don't don't get. You see me now and you see Jim launch, right?

[08:34] The thing is, is that this dynamic of the size of me and audience, you know, influence now.

[08:40] And Jim launch, like I am bigger than Jim launch now. When I sold Jim launch, Jim launch was much bigger than

[08:45] me. And so that's the big thing that people miss is that like, if you're bigger than the company,

[08:49] you will always be key man risk for the business. Now, in that instance, you can sell the goose

[08:56] if you are bigger, but you usually have to sell a minority. And what that means is, like,

[09:01] people aren't going to take a risk that you're going to leave. But you're saying, I want to take

[09:04] chips off the table, where I want to either fund an acquisition or I want to like expand in this way.

[09:08] And so an investor will happily bet on you by investing in your business. That's what raising money

[09:13] is fundamentally. And so if I had, so like acquisition.com, I probably can't exit acquisition.com.

[09:20] Nor would I really want to, because I'm associating myself so strongly with it for such a long period of

[09:24] time. But what I could do is I could raise money off acquisition.com and say, look at all of our

[09:27] holdings. And I'm going to sell 5% or 10% of acquisition.com at a monster valuation so that I can

[09:33] either take chips off the table like one or two or more realistically, I would say, I want to go buy this

[09:38] massive company. And I want investors to help me do that and look out, it will add value to all the other

[09:43] holdings that we have. So we'll get a disproportionate return on it. Right? That me doing that isn't

[09:47] really an exit. It's a transaction or liquidity event. But it's not me leaving the business. Like,

[09:52] you look at beast industries, right? Like with Jimmy, Mr. Beast. He's raised at the whole

[10:00] co-level. So that means that the beast burger, the the the software he has, feastables, all of them

[10:06] are under that big thing. And so he's not, he can't exit his YouTube channel. But he can sell

[10:12] a portion of it to fund more growth, which is what raising money is. And so he's available to do that.

[10:16] If you look at, look at Elon, right? Elon is inextripted with the company said he has. And so

[10:22] his way of doing that is like they're mostly public companies with the exception of space

[10:26] sex. And so by doing that, the public participates. But he's not leaving. He's the owner of the

[10:34] business. He's still running the business. But he allows other people to participate in the growth

[10:39] of the company overall. So back to smaller businesses. So I had a media company that reached out to me.

[10:45] It was like, hey, I'm trying to figure out how I structure my media company to become

[10:51] sellable. He had a number of stars or talent in his kind of stable. Right? And so if you're in that

[10:58] business, you basically need to pick one of two directions. So either you get all of the guys in the

[11:03] stable to support a product. So that'd be like, hey, this is our hair gel. This is our dip. This is our

[11:09] whatever. Right? And ideally, you want that consumable to be a recurring thing, something that, and

[11:14] when I say recurring, it doesn't have to be recurring, but it can also be reoccurring. Meaning

[11:19] if I use hair gel, I might not want to have a subscription for it. But if I, when I run out, I buy more of

[11:23] the same thing. Like, I'm not a recurring subscription for Coca-Cola products, but I do buy Coca-Cola

[11:29] stuff on a reoccurring basis. And so if you get enough exposure, then people will buy that. Right?

[11:35] And so the idea here is that for him, either has to have a product or he sells advertising space

[11:42] and the impressions that he's able to consistently generate become the product. Right? Like, so if

[11:47] you're a media company, it's one of those two things. You're either pushing all of that,

[11:50] those impressions that you're getting from your stable into one product you own, or you're saying,

[11:56] I'm going to let any advertisers come in as long as it makes sense for our brand or the brand of

[11:59] the talent to place ads on their meat. And I'm selling media space itself. Those are the two ways

[12:05] that that business would work. Now, if you want to exit that business, he can't exit the stars.

[12:10] The stars would generate the impressions. Now, if he's not a star, he could exit the business

[12:15] if he has the stable of stars and he's selling advertising space. But if I were him, I would say,

[12:20] well, I would rather just have this incubator where I could just blow up products. And again,

[12:25] which ones the goose, which ones the eggs. In this instance, having all this massive media and

[12:29] impressions and whatnot, that's the goose. And then the eggs would be the products that we'd

[12:34] sell through that distribution. Now, using the strategy I was saying before, he could raise money

[12:39] by saying, I'm going to sell 10%, so I can front all the capital for this massive launch. Because

[12:44] if you have a ton of impressions, this is one of the big issues that a lot of creators have,

[12:47] is that their impressions and their fame far surpassed their wealth. And so in order for them to

[12:54] accommodate the demand that they have, they'd have to basically have a ton of money they don't have

[12:58] to buy in inventory and get, you know, they're like, logistics set up and like all these other

[13:05] things upfront to do it right. Because you want to do a good job because you can only have one

[13:09] reputation. And so they have to front all this stuff. And if you don't have money, it gets very

[13:13] hard. And so that's where sometimes having, like you're not exiting your brand before you have

[13:17] the product, you take a tiny bit, you give it to somebody else so they can bet on you and then you

[13:20] can put that money towards something that will make everybody more money. Now, I'll give you a fourth

[13:25] example of this. So I did an accounting firm, kind of like coach consultant, whatever you want to

[13:31] call it, reach out. And he was like, hey, I'm trying to think about the ultimate version of my business.

[13:35] Now, his business was a business where we were all it made a lot of sense because there's a lot

[13:39] of M&A activity in the accounting space for variety of reasons. But one of them is that the book of

[13:45] business is just worth a lot of money. There's usually high gross margins or net margins in the business.

[13:50] It's incredibly recurring and sticky. Like people don't normally switch who they're doing their

[13:54] taxes with year to year to year. And so they have massive LTVs. The hardest part of the business

[13:59] is acquisition is getting customers. But keeping customers is actually not too difficult in that

[14:03] business as long as you do a good job. And so he was like, how do I sell my accounting firm, coaching,

[14:08] consulting thing? And I was like, well, that's not what you want to sell because no one's buying that.

[14:11] But what people are buying is accounting firms in globs together. And so the top version of your business

[14:17] is having a roll up of 10, 20 accounting firms that you can exit every one or two years and exit

[14:24] for 100 million bucks or whatever. And you take your slice and you say, hey, I'm the one who's putting

[14:27] this deal together. And I get 20% and I get 30% whatever. And if you're thinking about this and you're

[14:31] like, well, why would somebody give up that kind of percentage? Well, here's how it works. So when you buy

[14:35] in bulk, right, when you go by toilet paper or Costco as a consumer, when you buy in bulk, you get a

[14:40] discount, like the more you buy, the less you pay per roll that makes sense. What's interesting is that

[14:45] in investing, it's a volume premium. So basically the more profit you have, the bigger the company

[14:51] is, the bigger the roll up is, the more you get per. And it's because big money is lazy. And so they

[14:57] will pay a premium to not have to do as many deals because deals are costly. Cost a lot of time,

[15:01] on extension. And so if you have to do 100 deals versus doing one deal, you'll pay a premium to only

[15:05] have to do one deal. And so if those individual accounting firms could sell at, call it,

[15:10] four times earnings on their own, right, if they can sell in aggregate together for call it 12 times

[15:16] earnings, then even if they give up 30% of the 12x, they're still double as good as they were before.

[15:23] And so everybody wins. And the thing is, is that I spend a lot of time trying to find those types of

[15:28] situations in business where it's like literally everyone wins is like, if we work together,

[15:32] rather than be competitive, if we can collaborate. And I'm telling you all the guys that I know

[15:36] who make gobs and gobs and gobs and money, like it's so rare that you're actually competing against

[15:41] people. Like I used to say this in the weight loss world, I was like, we're not competing against each

[15:45] other guys. Like because I had obviously big community of gym owners and we had tons of gyms

[15:48] are in the same market. And I was like, guys, we're competing against the couch. Like we're competing

[15:52] against Netflix. We're not competing, like we're competing against chocolate. Like we're not competing

[15:56] against each other, right? Like it's only like, I think it's like 11% of Americans like have a gym membership.

[16:01] But still a tiny percent of people who go to the gym. And that's have a membership, not even

[16:05] use their membership. And so I mean, just look at how many fat people they're like, it's not like,

[16:09] it's not like the problem doesn't exist, right? And so people get really obsessed about their competition

[16:14] rather than just thinking, okay, how can we collaborate? And we can all get better. Because the thing

[16:17] is that the private equity buyer, the ultimate person at the top of this food chain who aggregates

[16:22] fragmented industries, those guys don't think like small business owners. They just think, oh, this is

[16:29] really fragmented. I'm going to roll all these together and make a much bigger thing. They don't care

[16:33] that you have some sort of animosity. Because they just remove both founders who have egos and say,

[16:37] cool, these two work well together. And I can see some synergies in terms of costs. And I can get

[16:41] more profit and own more of the market. They just don't think about it like that. And so all the

[16:45] richest guys I know are just like, it's so funny because there's these these blood futes that

[16:50] exist between businesses that are local. But like the guys who you eventually sell to, if you, you know,

[16:55] succeed and do a good job with it, those guys don't care at all. And they just roll everything

[16:59] together anyways. And so we have this whole obsession about like competing. But like the reality is

[17:03] that if you collaborate, you end up making a lot more money. I'll tell you another quick example on this.

[17:07] So there was a dental association that we were looking really heavily into. So they had like 700

[17:13] dentists that were in their association. And dentists have to buy like floss and toothbrushes and

[17:18] toothpaste and whatever other stuff they need. And so they spend like 20, 30,000 a year on kind of

[17:22] like consumable products that they have to use in their practice. And so what they did was they

[17:27] did a co-op in terms of group buying. So they said, hey, let's all come together rather than make

[17:31] competitive, let's collaborate and let's buy together as one. And by doing that, they're going to

[17:35] go shade a big discount and rates. And so the discount that those guys would save in buying together

[17:40] exceeded the cost of the anomemorship, which by the way, brilliant model. And so like as long as you

[17:46] plan on being in business, why would you not want to have a savings that's an access of the cost

[17:50] of an association, which if you ever have the opportunity to do that, like I said, great model,

[17:54] especially in a niche. And so they did exactly what I'm talking about. It said he took the top

[17:59] 11 of the dentists rolled them up and they sold it for 120 million. But the PE group,

[18:05] damn them, was extra smart. We were bidding against them for the business. It was like, hey,

[18:09] you know what, we'll buy your business too. Well, we're at it because we'll buy your goose and the eggs.

[18:14] Because they all they saw was, wait, you have 700 other dentists in here. Well, that's our

[18:19] egg pipeline for the next five years. And so they're just like, cool. So we'll do this roll up

[18:24] and we'll pay you a premium on your revenue, which was actually fairly recurring to be in

[18:30] defensive this business, which is again, why it was sellable. Because they just knew that they're like,

[18:33] okay, we'll do this roll up. But next year, we'll just grab another 20 of them or another 50 of them

[18:37] and keep adding it together. And so the thing is, is that the most valuable version of that

[18:40] business wasn't actually that business. It was the eggs of that business. And so making sure that

[18:46] you understand which is the goose and which is the eggs for the business that you're building,

[18:50] then I can orient my whole business to shoot out as many of these eggs as I can.

[18:54] And by doing that, you have a goose that lays golden eggs and ideally you hold onto that goose

[18:59] and you pet that little goose as long as you can.

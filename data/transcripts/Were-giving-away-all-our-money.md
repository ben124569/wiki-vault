[00:00] Last week, Leil and I signed our wills donating our entire state to charity more or less.

[00:05] That obviously happens after read eyes, so it's not now.

[00:07] But it was a really interesting experience for me to go through because it put a lot of things into perspective within life.

[00:15] And so I wanted to share some of the thoughts around that because I made Instagram post about it and it's gotten the most likes and comments and interaction out of any post I've made today.

[00:23] And so I figured it was a point of interest.

[00:27] The reasoning behind kind of that decision is is multi-fold and so I'll share that with you.

[00:33] So the first is we are of the belief that, I mean, one, we don't have kids and so we would have, we have no direct incentives we pass it to.

[00:41] Second, even if we did have kids or have kids in the future, I don't think that giving people a lot of money when they do not earn it is good for them.

[00:50] All the people that I know who were given money, it ended up ruining their lives.

[00:55] And so I would not wish that on any of the descendants that I have.

[00:59] Next piece is kind of the concept of legacy, which is like, why don't you want to do something like the Rockefellers and have some big trust in it feeds every all your generations from here on out.

[01:08] I think there's these ideas that we all strive for of impermanence to the impermanence because we want to live on after we die.

[01:16] But I think it's just a human condition thing and it's just not reality.

[01:19] You know, if you think about like the Sumerians, civilizations from 5,000 years ago, there's no one that we even know about.

[01:26] We just know that they existed and that's about it.

[01:29] And we don't know about the rich people and the poor people and we don't know who started schools and who didn't.

[01:32] We just know that they existed.

[01:34] And I think that that may be the Americans in 5,000 years from now.

[01:38] And so there's the biological component of, all right, so when we die, our kids are going to marry people and they're going to have kids and those kids are going to marry people.

[01:46] And then you do that a hundred times and it's taking a 50% and then raising it to the hundredth power.

[01:50] You know, I'm sorry, a half and then just doing it over and over and over and over again, right?

[01:54] And so basically the amount of our genetic pool, if you want to look at it from biological perspective of what 10 or 100 generations from now is, is basically nothing, right?

[02:02] We're not really there.

[02:04] And then the other piece of it is like, will they know who we were or any of the character traits that we had will be passed on unlikely?

[02:11] And so for us, it felt kind of like the right thing because we also feel like we've been given a lot and not just from being born in America and all that kind of stuff, but

[02:22] from a broader context, I've shifted my perspective on, I think, business success over time.

[02:28] And so like let me give you a visual example.

[02:30] If you were to look at Chicillo Neal, versus let's say a tiny Asian lady, right?

[02:35] You could see a huge amount of genetic diversity just in that visualization.

[02:40] And I think the same visualization appears mentally, it's just not visual.

[02:46] And so think about that for a project. So like it's like, why is he so good at basketball?

[02:50] Well, it's like if you look at him, you be like, well, geez, he's so naturally inclined for that.

[02:53] I'm not to say that every person who has his genetic makeup would be, you know, as good as he was,

[02:57] but they would have inclination to be pretty good, right?

[03:00] And so I think that the same exists within your mental capacity and your character traits,

[03:06] but predispicious and for business. Like I wonder what, if we're to look through that same visual lens,

[03:10] which F-based was look like mentally or what Bill Gates would look like mentally or what,

[03:14] Warren Buffett would look like mentally. And all of a sudden, we might be like, well, it makes sense,

[03:18] because he's seven eight, you know what I mean? Of course, he's good at investing or of course,

[03:21] he's good at business or whatever. And so I think that my perspective on this has shifted because if you

[03:25] asked me when I was younger, what made me, you know, successful, whatever, I'm using quotes here,

[03:30] I'm not saying where the most successful people in the world are anything or far from it,

[03:33] but I think that I would have said hard work, sacrifice and all of that stuff. But I think is

[03:37] I've gotten more perspective. I think that, but just naturally, get out of it, you know,

[03:41] and I think that obviously work and sacrifice and those things hone the scale, just like she killed

[03:45] Neil, so he has to go to practice, but I think some people get disproportionate returns on their

[03:50] time and effort. And so to give back after we are dead is not really asking that much.

[03:54] Beyond that, it also gives me another huge conclusion about my own life, which is if I'm

[03:58] going to be donating all of this stuff when I die anyways, then it makes more sense for me to

[04:03] start giving away while I am alive. And I think that, you know, the first level of giving is obviously

[04:09] you can give money and Layla and I probably donated about a million dollars to you the last few

[04:12] years to various charities that we believe in. But I think what has, what is more valuable is the skills

[04:20] and the experiences and the traits and the lessons that we have gathered along our journey that

[04:26] I think is more valuable. And so the reasoning behind acquisition.com, which for those who

[04:31] don't know us is our portfolio holding company right now holds seven companies, or entirety, and

[04:38] then also percentage of. And that does about $85 million a year. Point behind, you know, this channel

[04:44] is the hopefully transfer those lessons while we are alive to other people. Because if we're

[04:49] going to give it all when we would die, why not start now? At least that's the, that's the thought

[04:54] process behind them. And so that's why for those you ask questions like that's why we are writing

[04:58] the books, that's why I'm making the courses, that's why I'm doing all that stuff and we're giving

[05:01] them away for free. What's interesting is that I think that Thursday shift that occurs and I'm just

[05:07] I guess noting this because my first businesses were created out of scarcity. And so what I mean by that is

[05:14] they were created out of an insecurity, they were created out of a deficiency, they were created

[05:18] out of a deficit, a need for something, right? One of my favorite quotes from Navarrava Khan is

[05:23] desires are contract we make with ourselves to be unhappy until we get what we want. And I,

[05:26] and I can't really, us building those businesses was not like a happy experience for me. It was very

[05:31] like grindy, dark rage filled like just our workout sacrifice type thing. And what's interesting is

[05:40] when I look at the people who make a lot more money than me now, they don't kind of act that way.

[05:43] And I think it's because the motivation has to shift because if you are this at least for

[05:49] me, it's like if I'm only trying to satisfy my own personal needs at 10 million or 20 million or

[05:54] 30 million, whatever it is, whatever your number is, you know, be able to cross maybe it's a million,

[05:57] whatever it is. When you cross that number in the bank all of a sudden, you'll feel the energy

[06:01] or the drive towards that satisfying that goal will diminish because you somewhat do, right?

[06:08] And so I think at that point there are two directions that you can kind of go in. One direction is to

[06:12] make money the ultimate scorecard, which I'll give you an analogy of why I think that's silly

[06:17] in a second. And the other is that you can change the driver. And so for the first one,

[06:23] the reason that I've never really been a big, you know, I've never espoused that, I've never been

[06:26] to be believer in that one is that I see the entrepreneurial journey as a casino. And so bear with me

[06:32] for a second. So imagine every one of us is given a token, right, as we, you know, come of age,

[06:38] whatever that age is, maybe it's 12, maybe it's 14, whatever the age is that you decide that you want

[06:42] to get in the game, right? And so we get a token and we go into the casino and we get a seat at the

[06:47] table. And we continue to apply and we continue to apply and we have the other players, right?

[06:51] And what's interesting is that everyone's playing for the chips that are on the table. The difference

[06:55] is that you might amass this big amount of chips, right? The thing is is that we don't get to cash out.

[07:01] We literally just have to leave the table and then someone else takes our seat and all of our chips

[07:06] get pushed back into the middle of the table for other people to play with. Again, and the other

[07:10] people you could say is your family, the other people you could say is your competitors, the other

[07:13] people you could say is just a marketplace for humanity as a whole. But either way we don't get

[07:17] the leave the casino alive and we don't get to leave with our chips. And so having that perspective

[07:22] for me just really reinforces that it's just a game because we don't get to keep any of it. And so

[07:27] once you satisfied like, once you can eat steak dinner every single night and it doesn't change

[07:31] anything, and once you can buy private jets and once you can do all that stuff like nothing changes,

[07:36] like more money changes literally nothing because money can only solve money problems. And that

[07:41] was one of the lessons that I've learned as we've gained more of it. Is that money really

[07:44] solves money problems? And once you've run out of money, problems for money to solve, there's really

[07:49] not a lot of utility for it. That's why for me the money scoreboard concept has never really

[07:56] resonated me dying a billionaire. So what? I mean, like it's going to take this big lump of money

[08:05] and then it's going to get handed to somebody else. And so that is also why I don't think we want

[08:11] to give it to somebody else because you know, an individual person because I think it would ruin

[08:15] them. And one of my favorite cards in matching the gathering, which is again, I played all the time

[08:19] when I was a kid, it was burning wish and the the flavor text on that card was she wished for a weapon

[08:25] but not for the skill to wield it. And that's very much how Lail and I both see money is that it's just

[08:32] this raw power and the more of it you get, the more skill you must have in order to wield it effectively.

[08:40] And so I think that that is why we don't we wouldn't want to quote ruin our descendants in that way

[08:46] or ruin anyone in that way because I think it's too much for one person to have. And so that is why

[08:50] we're pushing it towards causes rather than individuals because I also think that when you give it

[08:55] to individuals you rob them of the opportunity to earn for themselves and you rob them of the

[09:02] opportunity to to to achieve in that way because I can tell you I remember when I was a kid and I thought

[09:09] about this really deeply when I was in college. I thought to myself if I won the power ball right

[09:15] because I bought a ticket because it got like all you know all the guys that I knew all got won

[09:18] ticket because it was like a billion dollars or something at one point for the power ball. And it's more

[09:23] just for the conversation that that that comes as a result of that that we bought it is not because I

[09:27] thought it was like a chance or anything. But what was interesting is that I realized that during

[09:31] the drawing I actually had this feeling of dread because I really didn't want to win because I

[09:36] realized that if I won that it would kind of make everything that I was wanting to do meaningless which

[09:41] was really weird for me to think about. I was like if I just got a billion dollars then it would mean

[09:45] that I never even got to play the game or get the credit for earning whatever I would end up having

[09:50] because I wanted to have and this is probably my ego or my insecurities. I wanted to have

[09:55] people give me status for having earned this right but I think again as I've gotten older my

[10:00] my thinking around that has changed because like there are so many things that I've been fortunate with

[10:05] you know what I was born with genetically you don't know I mean I think that I've decent reasoning

[10:10] powers and I don't know how much of that is is learnable you don't know I mean I think you know

[10:16] I was born in the United States I was born a white male I was born to you know a doctor

[10:22] as a parent and so like there's lots of things that I have that already gave me a leg up and so

[10:30] anyways just to to bring this home for you the reason that we have acquisition.com and the reason

[10:35] that we are pushing far more towards giving away everything that we have is while we are alive

[10:41] in the most viable assets we have which is the value that we can provide in terms of the lessons

[10:45] and skills is because I just have no more marginally utility for money now that being said

[10:52] it would be it would be who of me to kind of follow an uncle Warren's footsteps which is I think

[10:57] that I will be a better allocator and multiplier of capital so that when I when we die we will be

[11:01] able to pass on and make a larger impact on you know whoever you know whatever causes we donate

[11:08] our stuff to then if I were to donate it now and we do donate stuff now because you know I think

[11:13] about this where it's like I've given away $2 million last two years and I think about $2 million

[11:18] in 40 years and how if I you know allocated it well it would probably be like $100 million right

[11:23] and I'm giving away all that money now but I think there's always the trade-off between consumption

[11:28] and investment that you know kind of all entrepreneurs make and the consumption investment

[11:32] trade-off happens kind of for everything it's like investing in your relationship versus

[11:36] consuming your relationship investing the business versus consuming the benefits of the money

[11:40] and that kind of happens with everything right and so that is kind of the the thought process

[11:45] and the thinking behind the the books and the courses and all that stuff behind Acquis is not

[11:48] comfortable as you asked the big impetus behind this was you know donating what will you know just

[11:53] our current estate is probably valued between 60 and 80 million depending on whose valuing the

[11:59] equity slices we have in the businesses we own I know that if I were to do nothing and just wait

[12:04] you know 40 or 50 years hopefully I live that long it would be a very big number right even at 10

[12:09] percent it will be over a billion dollars at that point and that's if we are no more money between

[12:13] now and then and so I think that it changes the game and I'll leave you this with this one quote from

[12:17] the bravacount that I think is really valuable you said retirement is when you stop sacrificing

[12:22] today for a hypothetical tomorrow and I think that what that will give me was the permission to stop

[12:29] doing that because if I know that I'm not going to be I'm not going to be taking anything that I'm

[12:34] making now with me anyways and I'm going to be giving it a lot all the way to begin with it

[12:37] pretty much eliminates the desire to trade time for money in any meaningful way besides things that

[12:45] that I you know enjoy and think that I can provide value with and so for the many of you that

[12:50] reach out I want to also say a couple things real quick one we don't sell time so I get probably like

[12:56] 100 dams that I asking if we do when I want consulting we do not we take on companies that are

[13:02] I say 3 to 10 million but closer to like the 5 to 10 million plus mark just FYI unless you have

[13:08] something that's really interesting and so we you know we invest and we take positions in those

[13:13] companies and help them grow for context at the time of this video the smallest business that we

[13:17] have in the portfolio does 8 million here so just like I said for context it says 3 to 10 but

[13:22] we're really skewing towards the the largest side of that and that is why I don't consult for dollars

[13:28] it's also why we're not selling courses what I'm saying masterminds or not selling coaching and

[13:32] if you see comments in the thread that are replies from fake alachromoses they're right now we have

[13:38] we're getting like targeted and it's probably because I think there's a lot of goodwill on the channel

[13:42] because we don't sell anything I will never ask you for a WhatsApp all right so like please like do

[13:49] not respond to any of the comments that have a picture of me and like some weird decimals afterwards

[13:55] to make it look like it's many I will never ask you for WhatsApp I will never text you from money

[14:00] all right so please please please please do not respond to this people do not feed feed that

[14:06] anyways love you all hope you're amazing this felt like the right time to make this video in the

[14:10] bargain up before I go to the gym and keep being awesome and if you enjoyed this video click subscribe

[14:15] for a lot more tactical stuff that we do about growing businesses and growing wealth the point of

[14:20] this channel is there's a lot of people who are broken I don't want you to be one of them so without

[14:23] further ado I'll see you next week bye

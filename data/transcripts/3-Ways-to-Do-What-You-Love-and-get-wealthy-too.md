[00:00] I really loved fitness, macro counting, different ways to exercise, different programming stuff.

[00:03] And I was obsessed with it so much so that the people that I worked with were like,

[00:05] dude, if you don't start a gym, I'll pay for the gym to stop talking about the stuff.

[00:09] There are three paths that every entrepreneur eventually has to take.

[00:12] You have the path of the pure artist, the path of the pure entrepreneur, and then a hybrid path.

[00:16] So the path of the artist is the person who loves doing the thing.

[00:19] Now your art from might be plumbing.

[00:20] Your art from might be carpentry, coding software, making media, making wallets.

[00:24] You have something that you enjoy doing and you do it well.

[00:26] The second path on the extreme is that you love business.

[00:29] Business is your art form and it doesn't really matter what business you're in.

[00:32] I love working with different portfolio companies, whether it's solar sales,

[00:35] mortgage sales, physical products, software, service businesses, brick and mortar chains.

[00:39] Like we have all of those in our portfolio and I love growing them all.

[00:43] And that's because the art for me is the actual business itself.

[00:45] The third path is a hybrid path and each of these paths can go all the way to the max limit here.

[00:50] So an example is a device Luka who is the founder of Shopify.

[00:55] And so he loves building Shopify pages and he loves the coding and loves the product.

[01:00] And so what he did was he found somebody else and have them build the business around him while

[01:04] he stayed focused on the main thing that he loved the most.

[01:07] The key here is that there is no right path.

[01:09] It's more about the path that works best for you during the season you're in.

[01:12] Because guess what? You could also change paths later.

[01:14] If you start in the artist path, you might transition to the hybrid path.

[01:18] Or you might start in the artist path and go all the way to the entrepreneur path.

[01:20] When I started, I really loved fitness.

[01:22] I was obsessed with fitness. I spent years I competed in fitness.

[01:25] And so all I read all day besides a little bit of personal development was like macro counting,

[01:29] different ways to exercise different programming stuff like exercise for ways to layer workouts,

[01:33] program all that kind of stuff.

[01:34] And I was obsessed with it so much so that the people that I worked with are like dude,

[01:37] if you don't start a gym, I'll pay for the gym so these stop talking about this stuff.

[01:40] As soon as I actually started a gym, I realized I enjoyed business even more than I enjoyed fitness.

[01:44] I started as an artist of fitness and I became an entrepreneur.

[01:47] But let me play out all three paths to their natural extremes.

[01:50] The artist at its extreme is somebody who continues to not scale and enterprise around them

[01:56] and continues to do the thing at extraordinarily high levels.

[01:59] And so this ultimately goes from a commoditized price point to a premium price point to a luxury price point.

[02:05] All right, so commoditized price point is like if you're a plumber,

[02:07] you do the same plumbing work everyone else does.

[02:09] Right? Now, if you start doing it really well, word of mouth starts to build and you can start

[02:13] raising your prices because you are an out premium provider. You do better work. You do it faster.

[02:17] People come to you because they trust your work. Right? Now, at the highest level, it becomes

[02:21] luxury. You become so advanced in plumbing. You can do it for massive building.

[02:25] Or you can do it for luxury homes and you make it look or neat and awesome and cool and whatever.

[02:29] What happens is demand continues to increase for your services or your product.

[02:34] And so rather than increase the number of units you sell, you just increase the price.

[02:37] You still make significantly more money and a lot more profit in that business model.

[02:42] But it still keeps you doing the core thing, which is that you like plumbing.

[02:45] You like making wallets. You like being a carpenter or whatever. You can have incredible artists

[02:49] who sell their paintings for millions of dollars a piece and they don't have a massive organization

[02:54] around. They're main thing that they focus on every day is the art. Now, there's obviously

[02:58] elements of entrepreneurship there because they make money. The hybrid version, developer who built

[03:02] the little website because he wanted to make some sort of physical product business that he

[03:06] didn't like the tools there out there and he started making it. But then other people because

[03:09] the product was so good started asking for it. Now, he could have just continued to raise the price

[03:13] the thing. But at a certain point, especially with software, it made more sense to make himself

[03:17] chief product officer, rather than CEO and then hire to CEO and hire an executive team to build

[03:23] everything else around him because he's a big shareholder. He has a lot of sway. But on the actual

[03:27] chart itself, he might be over here not necessarily at the top because he doesn't want that life.

[03:32] You still do your art every day, but then you find the people. Now, that does require skill because

[03:37] you need to have the perspective in which to make a judgment on who's good enough to be able

[03:40] to lead your company. Now, that's where having outside advisors and things like that to help you find

[03:43] those people who you do trust, you already have that skill who don't have a vested interest in your

[03:47] business, so they can give you the cleanest, pureest advice. The highest level of advice is someone who

[03:51] has been there done that themselves and taken other people just like me to where I'm trying to go

[03:56] multiple times. A level below that is someone who has taken multiple people like me to where I'm

[04:00] trying to go. They haven't done it themselves. The level below that is someone who's only

[04:03] done it themselves and helps no one else. The level below that is someone who saw someone go all the

[04:08] way themselves or saw multiple other people go other themselves. Below that is only seeing one

[04:12] person and below that is your mama uncle and your neighbor telling you they're too

[04:15] sensitive about how you should do business when they never run a business and have no right to have

[04:18] an opinion. You can leverage their experience to find the right people to fit inside of your

[04:22] business to build the business around you. The third path is that of the entrepreneur. That's the

[04:26] person whose art form is the businesses and so rather than thinking about making wallets and making

[04:31] more wallets, the business itself is the painting and so they will have multiple paintings in their

[04:35] career as they develop as an artist. So too does their expression of their art and so the types of

[04:40] businesses they build get bigger and more complex more or need or simpler. It just depends on

[04:44] what type of entrepreneur they are. I'll tell you right now the amount of businesses that I started.

[04:49] I started a non-profit online training business. I switched to a for-profit training business

[04:54] and then I switched to a brick and mortar gym then I had a chain of gyms then I had a gym turn around

[04:58] business. I had a car-practor agency, I had a dental agency, I had a licensing business, I've had

[05:02] an e-commerce business, that's own physical products, I've had a software business, I've got

[05:06] a service B to B and now I have private equity firm and I'm 33. As you develop as an entrepreneur,

[05:11] your art will change and it will be continually a changing expression of who you are and it will evolve.

[05:17] So the biggest question is which of the three are you? If you love the actual doing of the business,

[05:22] the thing you do, the product or service you deliver, that is your art then I would say start with

[05:27] the path of the artist and if you're good because if you really do love it you should be able

[05:31] to beat other people who don't love it and so you should naturally through word of mouth be able

[05:34] to get more demand than you have supply of time. At that point you'll have to start making the decision

[05:39] am I going to go hybrid or are I going to go all the way entrepreneur? If you're starting out right

[05:42] now and you're watching this video and you just love entrepreneurship in general and you don't really

[05:45] care what you sell you just want to make money then you probably more the entrepreneur path.

[05:50] You just want to hustle you want to figure out needs in the marketplace, figure out stuff that

[05:53] people are buying, connect the two dots, build the organization around it, put it operator in charge

[05:56] and then let it run and make cash flow. That's the entrepreneur path. The middle path, the

[06:02] hybrid path is usually someone who starts as an artist and then becomes that because they still want

[06:06] to build the big enterprise but they don't want to sacrifice the thing that love the most which

[06:10] is actually building the product. This little product thing as a side note could also be marketing.

[06:15] It could also be finance. If you like a certain component of the business you can own that

[06:20] component of the business and have someone build it around you you could just be the guy who

[06:23] loves fundraise and you just love raising funds and that's how you build your business and you get

[06:27] everybody else around you to run it. You will still leave your thumbprint on different aspects and

[06:31] be more heavily involved in different departments the ones that you love the most but at this point

[06:34] you do it by choice rather than do it by obligation. Do I love the thing or do I love the business

[06:38] of doing the thing and then walking that path down and the best news is you can always change your

[06:42] mind later. The most viable skill that you can have in order is product first then marketing then sales.

[06:49] And so right now if you know how to sell it's because you don't know how to market you know how to

[06:52] build products. If you know how to market then you can sell lots of stuff but you're only going to sell

[06:56] it once because the product is usually not that good. If you know how to sell product you will get more

[06:59] promotion from your customers than anything else and that is ultimately what scales the enterprise.

[07:02] Marketing can scale anything to a point and then what happens is the marginal cost of getting the

[07:07] next customer continues to get oh up and up and if you don't get word of mouth referrals from

[07:11] customers who use your product then eventually it becomes untenable and your company will plateau.

[07:15] And so the key to building a very very big thing that lasts for a very long time is having

[07:19] an exceptional product and I get that you're like sure but how do I make money and you know what

[07:24] if you just sell shit you can make money. If you market shit well you can make even more money

[07:28] and what happens for most entrepreneurs is they actually go in that direction they just learn how to

[07:31] sell shit because that's the easiest skill to learn you can learn it in a couple of weeks. Learn how to

[07:35] market takes a little longer you learn how to write copy it's really just translating the

[07:38] the persuasion of sales into different types of media and selling to many people at once. And so the

[07:43] highest leverage thing you can do is make an exceptional product that other people want to promote

[07:48] for you. My first real big experience with this was the book so 100 million dollar offers is a book

[07:52] is 99 cents you can earn on Amazon. Like right now it's up to 25,000 copies a month with no paid

[07:56] ads. The reason for that and a lot of people who knew me from high school or knew me from college

[08:00] are like dude it's so crazy some guy I know from work is like dude you got to read this book

[08:04] and it was your book you have more people who send you business than people who leave just based on

[08:09] how good your product is that continues to compound to the end of time.

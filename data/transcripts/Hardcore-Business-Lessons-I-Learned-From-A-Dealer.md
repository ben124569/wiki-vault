[00:00] I learned six million dollar lessons at my first job working hot summers as an 18 year old

[00:06] in a warehouse at a fifth generation fur coat dealer.

[00:10] And this business made it through two world wars, multiple recessions, and these lessons

[00:14] I've taken with me for life.

[00:16] The first lesson I ever taught me was how to deal with angry customers.

[00:19] This lady comes in and she is pissing angry.

[00:26] He's like, where's John?

[00:28] He sold me this coat and this button came off.

[00:31] This is so ridiculous.

[00:32] I spent so much money on this coat.

[00:34] Wow, wow, she's just making a scene.

[00:35] I didn't go in the retail store that much because I looked like an 18 year old and I wasn't

[00:39] going to be selling any $25,000 cuts.

[00:41] John, the owner of the store.

[00:43] I'm on the other side of the door so she can't see me and he's walking towards me to turn

[00:46] out to go deal with her.

[00:48] As he's walking towards me, I see him roll his eyes and then as he turns the corner, he goes

[00:53] right into character.

[00:54] Mrs. Johnson, that is ridiculous.

[00:56] I cannot believe that you had a coat that had a button that was missing.

[00:59] Who sold you that coat?

[01:00] I need to find them right now.

[01:02] We'll get rid of them.

[01:03] Did anyone see you with the coat without the button?

[01:06] We're going to get to the bottom this right now.

[01:07] All of a sudden, her whole tone changes.

[01:09] She started back peddling.

[01:10] She's like, I mean, it wasn't that big of a deal.

[01:13] I was just a button.

[01:14] It probably, no, we need to get to the bottom of this.

[01:17] This is not acceptable.

[01:19] And she all of a sudden became calm as can be.

[01:21] She's like, you know what?

[01:22] I just want it to be fixed.

[01:23] You could fix the coat that he's grabbed it from.

[01:26] He's like, we're going to handle this right now.

[01:28] He goes the back.

[01:29] They fix the thing in five minutes.

[01:30] He hands it back, and she's like, John, you're always the best.

[01:33] Thank you so much for dealing with this.

[01:34] I'm sorry.

[01:35] I was a little bit over the top.

[01:36] I just, you know, I've spent so much in the jacket.

[01:38] He's like, as you should be.

[01:39] She walked at the door, I turned him in here, he was like, and he said, there could only

[01:43] be one person in the angry boat.

[01:45] So whenever someone comes in the angry boat, what most people try and do is they try and

[01:49] downplay them.

[01:51] And so they say, well, it's not that big of a deal.

[01:52] And what happens is the person doesn't feel validated.

[01:55] The person who's upset, then increases how angry they are because they want the person

[01:58] to validate why they're angry.

[02:00] And so what happens is they just keep getting angry and this person keeps trying to make

[02:02] them less angry.

[02:03] And then just creates more and more of a discrepancy between the two people.

[02:06] Now the flip side is, she got in the angry boat.

[02:08] And so she had to get out of the angry boat.

[02:10] And so whenever you're dealing with an upset customer, you need to validate their anger.

[02:13] And in a real way, if something was messed up and you have very high stance for your business,

[02:17] the moment you say it's not a big deal, means you're not actually taking responsibility.

[02:21] And if their complaint is ridiculous, it still is your responsibility.

[02:25] And so you have to take ownership of it because the alternative is you don't.

[02:29] And you never get better.

[02:30] The second lesson he taught me was about creating a new product.

[02:34] They realized that in the summer, they never had any demand because people aren't trying

[02:37] to buy fur coats in the summer.

[02:39] And they're like, huh, what can we sell to people during the summer?

[02:42] It's a came up with a genius idea.

[02:44] We'll store and condition the coats for them.

[02:46] As they sold every single customer coat, they said, hey, every year make sure during

[02:50] the summer when you're not using the coat, you bring it back here.

[02:52] We can repair any damages, we can sew things up, we can condition the fur and we can make

[02:56] it last two, three, five times longer so you can pass it on to the next of kin.

[03:01] And then you'd give this a little analogy.

[03:02] He's like, right, if you're going to buy a $50,000 car, you'd pay a $100 a month for insurance.

[03:06] It's the same thing here.

[03:08] So you created this analogy that compared for coats, which people didn't understand as well,

[03:11] to a car, which was something they did.

[03:13] And so what happened is overnight, he created what I would consider an insurance product.

[03:17] Insurance products don't actually have to be insurance.

[03:20] We can charge people for the safety that whatever they just bought will continue to provide

[03:24] value for a longer period of time.

[03:26] And the cost of deliver on this was so low because we had one 18 year old, two air conditioning,

[03:32] three storage facility.

[03:34] And the upsell was less than three, was getting people to say yes by saying no.

[03:38] When I first learned no-based selling, I actually learned it from this job when I was 18.

[03:43] Storage is the first court thing, which is I just hang your coat up and I keep it air

[03:46] condition.

[03:47] And the upsell is also a brush it and I'll fix it and I'll do these other things.

[03:50] And so when they would call up customers and they'd say, hey, do you want to turn in your

[03:54] coat for the summer?

[03:55] What they did was say, hey, we're going to store in condition the coat.

[03:58] You don't want anything else to you.

[04:00] And they would say, no, no, no, I don't want anything else.

[04:02] And so implied in that, they got them to say yes to storage and yes to condition the coat.

[04:07] Pretty slick.

[04:08] People want to just get the default option.

[04:10] We're so trained to say no to any kind of upsells that if you get someone to say no,

[04:15] but in so doing and get them to say yes, you actually click into their subconscious

[04:19] automated response.

[04:20] Most times when they say no to salesmen, they save money.

[04:22] You flip the script and you align it so that them say no actually gets them to say yes

[04:27] for you and to the purchase.

[04:28] So lesson four, when they wanted to get people to actually take them up on the upsell

[04:32] that they had, they gave them a little piece of bait.

[04:35] And it was what I call saw dust.

[04:36] And so saw dust is anything in a business that is created and access that you normally

[04:40] throw out.

[04:41] So a lot of famous things were actually made out of saw dust.

[04:43] Ikea pieces of furniture.

[04:45] They just glued together all the saw dust from lumber mills.

[04:48] Way protein used to get scraped off the bottom of dairy centers because it was waste product.

[04:53] And now is one of the most expensive products sold from dairy.

[04:56] What he did was he took the scraps from all the coats that they would make in the back.

[05:00] They made tiny little things that were made of fur.

[05:02] So I think like little purses, little ear muffs.

[05:04] And so they said anybody who would turn in their coat would get this as a bonus.

[05:09] They gave away something that cost them nothing that people still perceive value as

[05:13] bait to get people to come in and actually take the upsell.

[05:16] What's even more, when people did come to turn the thing in, they would actually say,

[05:19] well, you want to store that too, right?

[05:21] And they would say yes.

[05:22] And then they would charge them for that.

[05:24] Even though they got the product for free, the storage can come fresh.

[05:26] And if people were listening to this, if you're listening to this in your consumer,

[05:29] you have to get around the like someone selling me something makes them evil.

[05:32] Capitalism is the only system where both people say thank you after an exchange.

[05:36] It means both parties are better.

[05:37] If someone threatens you, that's different.

[05:39] That's not.

[05:40] That's just a form of robbery.

[05:41] But if I say, would you like this thing?

[05:43] And the other person says yes, and they give me money, and I give them the thing,

[05:46] no harm was done.

[05:47] If someone didn't want to store the ear muffs, then they didn't have to.

[05:50] And they just got it for free, which is a benefit.

[05:52] And for the business, just a cost of doing business to get the person in the door.

[05:54] How are we able to double the amount of coats people would buy?

[05:58] The first, who's he said, no dealers.

[06:00] Everyone who's a consumer thinks, oh,

[06:02] these must be great deals.

[06:03] That's why dealers on a loud.

[06:04] Once they got in, there was a sign on the door that said limit to proxpercustomers.

[06:08] They're like, oh, there's a limit.

[06:09] I have to use up the scarce resource.

[06:11] On top of that, they would have multiple strike downs on the price.

[06:14] It said final price, all sales are final.

[06:16] And he purposely let people in on a single file line and a fixed amount of people in the

[06:20] store at the same time.

[06:21] They created this huge perception of demand.

[06:24] And you feel like you gotta go get yours by creating this continuity product where

[06:29] people would come every year to get their forcoat, insured, and fixed.

[06:32] You become the dealer for life.

[06:34] And so what happens is instead of them price shopping you are going all over town,

[06:37] what they'll do instead is they go to you first.

[06:40] Instead of being that one salesman, it sells one car one time, you become the car salesman

[06:43] for the rest of your life because of what you do between the sales.

[06:46] So in your business, if you have a one time product, especially that's a little bit bigger

[06:50] and purchase, having little things that you can do even if you didn't make money on them.

[06:55] And then you know that on average you get customers to buy two more products from you,

[06:59] it more than makes up for the effort and cost of time that you put into it.

[07:02] And this leads me to my final lesson.

[07:03] This fur coat dealer was able to withstand all of the pita pressures and all of the,

[07:09] you know, people being upset about animals even though they wear leather and they eat

[07:12] meat every day.

[07:13] He was able to weather that for five generations because he never stopped doing the board

[07:17] work.

[07:18] What they do has not changed fundamentally in years.

[07:21] All they did was get better and better and better at it.

[07:24] One of the things that I found through all the portfolio companies that we work with,

[07:26] we own actors and not cons to portfolio is $200 million a year.

[07:29] The difference between small business owners and the big business owners is that the big

[07:32] business owners do the same thing for a very long period of time.

[07:35] They do all the things that right now you probably know you should be doing but aren't in your

[07:38] business.

[07:39] They just do those.

[07:40] They just do all the basics every time every day.

[07:42] And if you're like, man, but it's going to take me time to set up plug and take me time

[07:45] to do email fall up consistently.

[07:46] It's going to take me time to create content.

[07:48] It's going to take me time to build a sales team.

[07:50] Yeah, there's all the things that you probably know you should do and they take time, which is

[07:53] why building a business that's big takes big time.

[07:56] But it also creates even bigger outcomes.

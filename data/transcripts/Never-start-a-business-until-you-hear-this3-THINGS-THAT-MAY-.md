[00:00] Me, quitting my job, was the single hardest decision that I've ever made in my entire life.

[00:06] So, rewind and fully years ago, I was sitting on my balcony. I was 22 years old and I was staring

[00:12] out over this condo that I had purchased because of the job that I had, you know, paid me well.

[00:17] And I was looking over the city of Baltimore and I thought to myself, is this it.

[00:21] And this was a rock top and rock bottom moment for me specifically because at that time, I had

[00:28] graduated in three years from Vanderbilt, Madcome Laude, I was president of all these things

[00:33] while I was at school, I got a good consulting job and I had saved almost $50,000 at that point

[00:38] and I had this condo that was increasing in value and I saved pretty much everything minus my mortgage.

[00:44] And as I was looking out there, all I could think to myself was how I hated my life and how I hated my job

[00:51] and I just didn't, I felt so empty inside and I was so depressed that I really

[00:57] every day I would consider as I was driving like what if I wanted to the other lane and just like things

[01:02] would end and so that was like my actual reality and so that's called passive ideation which is like

[01:06] I'm not saying that I would want to, you know, kill myself but if I died and didn't wake up tomorrow

[01:11] I wouldn't be upset and that was kind of the existence that I lived for two years of my life and it was very

[01:16] hard time for me and so I don't know if we're you're at a New York entrepreneurial journey but I kind of

[01:20] wanted to answer one of the questions that I get most frequently which is you know, when should I quit and start my

[01:26] business and so I think a lot of it depends on you specifically in self-awareness and I'm going to talk about

[01:30] skill set in a second but I want to talk about the mindset first. Me quitting my job was the single

[01:36] hardest decision that I've ever made in my entire life and I mean that genuinely it was the hardest decision

[01:41] that I've made it took me six months to do it and I listened to Arnold's rules of success speech

[01:46] every morning when I wake up about you know it's okay to fail and I had to keep saying this stuff

[01:51] because I was so outrely driven I was so status driven that I didn't want to take the risk of being

[01:56] seen as a failure and so it only was when I was literally confronted with my own you know the fact

[02:02] that I was really not even willing to be alive anymore is one that was kind of my jogging to a

[02:06] wake-in-ness moment where I was like you know if I don't even want to be alive anymore then what's

[02:11] worse than that and so that was what ultimately shot me on the trajectory to you know quit that job

[02:17] cell the condo put everything that I had in my car and I drove across the country in 36 hours

[02:21] to California which is where I thought the land of fitness opportunity would be and I mind you I was

[02:25] a management consultant we did space cyber intelligence for the military at a subcontractor

[02:30] of Booz Allen if you familiar with that consulting firm and that's what I did for two years and it

[02:34] sounds really you know cool and sexy but it was not at all for me and I really did not enjoy it

[02:38] but I learned some valuable lessons like how to learn while I was there and so I think that what

[02:43] most people you know it really depends on who you are and understanding your skill set and honestly

[02:48] and how much pain you're in and so there's also different ways to satisfy that pain I think true

[02:53] to my core if I had been in a different company or I was working on different projects at that

[02:59] time of my life I probably would have never quit it was so hard for me and I didn't have a wife

[03:05] I didn't have kids I had zero dependence and I lived on nothing and it was still one of the hardest

[03:10] decisions in my life because I'm very risk-averse so believe it or not most entrepreneurs you know

[03:14] a lot of people talk about how they you know they didn't do well in school and you know teachers never

[03:17] understood them they always knew they had to go out on their own I never had any of that I worked

[03:21] really hard in school I did really well in school the teachers liked me for the most part and you know

[03:25] I got a good job afterwards and so I did not have the traditional entrepreneur journey and it was

[03:30] only because I was so sad deeply depressed in that time my life and felt so empty that I actually made

[03:34] the job and so I think the first thing is like one are you are you incredibly

[03:39] are you incredibly dissatisfied with your life so much that you'd be willing to upper it and change

[03:44] number one number two entrepreneurship is not easy and so if you need I think Elon must have this on a

[03:49] clubhouse meeting and I just think it's so true people are like what words of motivation would you

[03:53] get for a new entrepreneur if you need motivational quotes or motivational words the non-sponorship

[03:57] isn't for you and I tend to agree with him like if you need that motivation like it is one of

[04:03] the lonely as paths period you know at least in co-workers you have other people who are around you

[04:08] you can but when you start on your own you're starting at zero with no one and basically no one's

[04:12] rooting for you like for me when I left like no one really supported me my parents thought I was

[04:18] stupid and that there's just a stupid idea how I was throwing my education away and I was risking

[04:22] everything to go start a gym right which is really not even that good of return on investment you know

[04:26] I mean but I was so committed to the fact that I was so miserable that I was like at least I can

[04:30] just live my life doing something that I enjoy I don't even care if I make money and that was

[04:34] literally the the mindset that I was able to to quit with and so I took again I don't know where you're

[04:39] at but the first piece of this is understanding short and long term payoffs I did not make a

[04:45] significant amount of money four years after I quit my job all right so I'd say for the first

[04:51] four years I essentially broke even and made less money than I did as gets home all right so like

[04:56] think about that for a second right and there's a lot of mistakes I made too and you're going

[05:00] to make them as well because none of us is perfect there's so many skills that you have to like

[05:04] you have to acquire so many skills to run a business right and so you may have a single job right

[05:09] now and you are you were doing one specific function of one specific sub-department of a business but

[05:14] in order to be an entrepreneur you have to understand all of it right in order to be a successful entrepreneur

[05:18] so you have to understand how to generate demand you have to generate understand how to generate

[05:22] you have to understand how to work lead you have to understand how to sell you have to send

[05:24] how to fulfill and deliver and how to manage people how to communicate how to relay expectations

[05:30] how to recruit how to hire how to interview like there's so many things that you have to learn

[05:34] and I don't want that to be overwhelming I just want to confront you with reality because honestly

[05:38] if I knew how hard it was going to be when I started my first business I don't know if I would have

[05:44] done it I just I forced myself into a hole and I always like to say this is you'd be surprised

[05:49] what you're going to accomplish when you have no choice as dark and morbidism and as what I'm

[05:52] going to say is and don't get triggered by this but like the fact that an entire race in our country

[05:58] was enslaved for hundreds of years and was still able to do that every day shows the strength of

[06:03] the human spirit and what is possible and you have no choice and so I think that to juxtapose

[06:09] what I said about how hard it is if you can put yourself in a position where you have no choice

[06:13] you will be successful right if you want to succeed as bad as you can breathe you will be successful

[06:17] and so I think that was the situation where I was in where I knew that the alternative to what I was

[06:22] doing was death for me and so it was just anything is better than this and honestly the next

[06:29] year of my life even after that was still incredibly hard but it was different but it was still

[06:33] incredibly hard and so just to give you a couple of stats on this that I think everyone should have

[06:38] data to make decisions it's proper expectations right so the average so this is according to

[06:44] small business administration the median excuse me the median income of a small business owner

[06:51] $49,000 a year so I don't know what you're making right now but this is with the middle

[06:56] of the small business under ship makes now you might be making more than that there are people who are

[07:00] number 30 at Google who make way more than this right and so you have to understand kind of where you

[07:05] sit on the hierarchy and there are some people who would be so much better served there are

[07:10] so many of my ex employees who ended up going out on their own and I don't think many of them make

[07:15] more than they did when they were with us and they probably have more stress and that's okay that was

[07:18] their choice and there are tradeoffs you make for freedom right there are tradeoffs right risk and

[07:24] reward there are both of those things in the aspect of this decision now that's supposed to say average sorry

[07:29] now if you're curious what's the average small business owner make according the SBA?

[07:33] $73,000 a year now averages are skewed because there's top end people that move that average up

[07:38] such as say average sorry but median's 49 that means that the most likely most repeated outcome

[07:43] is 49,000 a year which is pretty much the median householding come of the United States kind of

[07:48] interesting and then the average is 73,000 so it depends on where you're at and how to satisfy you are

[07:53] and so the first thing is are you to satisfy because you don't like the company you work for

[07:58] are you to satisfy because you don't like the work you do now both of those have solutions that are

[08:02] outside of starting your own business right you can just go and find a different position

[08:06] and learn on someone else's dollar which is I think is so wildly under appreciated like

[08:12] go to a company that you like and learn and get paid to learn that's amazing right like

[08:17] because you're not going to learn anything at school that's going to be useful for business right

[08:21] so if you want to be an entrepreneur you're going to have to learn these things in the real world

[08:24] and so going in getting paid to learn is one of the best things you can possibly imagine

[08:28] you just have to understand that what you're getting paid for is not going to be your income for

[08:31] life it's literally you getting paid to learn how to do something which is amazing I did not have that

[08:37] I literally went from making money to starting to learn everything from scratch and I

[08:42] was very difficult for me now the the piece here about short term versus long term if you make this decision

[08:48] expect a three four maybe five year decrease in income right you're not going to make as much money

[08:54] for the first few years right and then maybe if you were successful when you reinvest in yourself

[08:59] and you grow new acquire skills and beliefs and attitudes and character traits then you will be

[09:02] able to have the long term pay off but entrepreneurship is the ultimate value investment in yourself

[09:08] and so again there are lots of people who don't have the risk tolerance for that and that is okay

[09:11] the vast majority people should not be entrepreneurs the second thing in terms of the choices right

[09:15] in the beginning it's do I need a switch companies that's if I don't like what I'm doing

[09:19] sorry if I don't like the company I'm working for number two is do I need a switch what I'm

[09:23] doing and get paid to learn which is a second alternative to quitting your position number three is

[09:29] if I if I like what I'm doing and I like the company and my just not getting paid enough

[09:33] well then talk to them and see how you can provide more value do not ask I would like to get paid

[09:38] more say how can I provide more value if you ask that question any any smart business or

[09:44] be able to tell you exactly how to provide more value so that you can make more in a low risk environment

[09:48] and then the fourth way you can do this if you're considering quitting is start investing all of

[09:53] your extra time in acquiring the other skills and start actually doing it spend some money on

[09:59] marketing do some outreach do those types of things to generate demand for your business now in the

[10:04] beginning it's going to be a side hustle but over time it can grow and then at a certain point

[10:08] it will grow and access of what you were currently making and then you can make the jump I did not do

[10:12] that what I did was candidly very stupid I got lucky I got very lucky I got extraordinarily lucky

[10:17] that I had people who were able to speak into my life at an early time point I was able to learn

[10:21] from experts very very quickly which candidly I invested in that I paid all of my savings that I'd

[10:26] saved up the $50,000 was gone within the first three months of me starting entrepreneurship gone

[10:32] because I paid for a mentorship I paid for coaching programs and I bought and I reinvested

[10:35] an adjim which I shouldn't have done I shouldn't have opened it the way I did because I didn't

[10:39] know any better right and so the biggest issue you're biggest risk when you start on your own

[10:43] is that you don't know what you're doing right and so the idea is if you can decrease your downside

[10:46] risk by learning more skills getting paid to learn them asking your business how you can provide

[10:51] more value which will allow you to learn more skills and get paid more as you do it right if you do

[10:55] all of those things and after doing all those steps you still are not satisfied then be willing

[11:01] to make the risk and make the short term trade off that you're going to make less for a period

[11:04] of time and so this is why I'm so such a big believer in living cheap right live cheap

[11:11] and keep your expectations at cheap so that if your income does drop you're still not losing money

[11:17] and then long term you can keep reinvesting in yourself so that you as the valuable asset

[11:20] can become more valuable and then increase in your earning potential and by extension because of

[11:25] the skills you learn are your business so to answer the question when do you when you quit

[11:29] in start a business it depends on who you are and where you're at in your life there are lots of

[11:33] other steps you can do before that like switch a company switch the job ask if you can do things

[11:38] that are making more valuable start the side hustle first then start making sure that it works

[11:43] if you like it before we're betting everything on it and then finally if none of those things

[11:48] work for you then at that point I would say okay if you have reasonable means that you've

[11:53] that you've saved up you have a vehicle that you know is tested you know other people who are doing

[11:57] that specific thing and you can do it then I would say by all means but I think that I made a

[12:02] lot of stupid decisions and can't really I think I got really lucky and so that is that is the

[12:07] long way to answer this question which is when when do you when do you quit start your own business

[12:11] it depends on you I can't give you a perfect answer because I don't know who you are but those are

[12:16] the frameworks that I'd be thinking of and these are the expectations that I would set in

[12:19] understanding the average 18 year old a senior in high school when surveyed believes that they will

[12:24] be a millionaire by age 25 how ridiculously unreasonable is that they believe this is the average

[12:30] right believes that third going to be in the top one percent within seven years of graduating high school

[12:37] well let's be real here do we think that that is a reasonable expectation no so if you believe that

[12:43] the stats are against you doesn't mean I'm saying I don't believe in you I believe in you 100 percent

[12:48] I'm your biggest fan but understand that these are the actual expectations of what this means

[12:54] all right I remember when I quit my job and I found out with the top gym owners for making

[12:59] and I remember literally my first thought was that's it and so you have to understand that there's

[13:05] there's the hullablu of revenue which I made in another video about measuring value lots of people

[13:10] talk big numbers not a lot of people make big numbers most people are broke and the reason I have

[13:15] this channel is to make sure that you are not one of them and so hope you enjoyed this click

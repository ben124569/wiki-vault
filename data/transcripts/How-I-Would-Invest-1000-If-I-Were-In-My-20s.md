[00:00] I'm getting tue that you will be making more than people who have four year degrees.

[00:05] You'll probably start making money by the end of the first year.

[00:07] I was at Brooks House and she had 7, 20 to 23 year olds at her house.

[00:12] No cat one morning, one of the guys was up early and he was like, hey, right now I've got a thousand

[00:17] extra dollars like where do you think I should invest it?

[00:18] You know, I've got my four of them.

[00:19] Okay, and I've got, you know, whatever stuff and it was cute.

[00:22] It was so interesting to me because like he was looking for an investment vehicle that was going

[00:27] to yield him a return.

[00:28] I want to be very clear about this.

[00:29] If you invest in the S&P 500, you know real estate things like that and you start really early

[00:34] and you do it for a long period of time, you absolutely will make money.

[00:37] It is a very safe way to live life.

[00:41] But the moment you start investing in kind of the asset side of stuff, which is like the S&P

[00:47] stocks in general and you're not day trading or doing that stuff because that's stupid.

[00:51] The moment you do that is actually the moment in my belief that you're actually

[00:54] ceasing to want to make more income.

[00:57] Hear me out.

[00:58] If you're 18 years old and you graduate high school tomorrow, you are now eligible on the market

[01:03] place because you have no skills besides your high school diploma.

[01:06] You did no job, fucked off the whole time.

[01:07] Don't watch you two to learn stuff, which is not you, but just a match.

[01:10] In two days, you could go and become certified as a full bottomist and go from making

[01:14] 750 year whatever the minimum wage is to a full bottomist make at $25.00 now.

[01:19] You would triple your earning capacity after two days and spending $500.

[01:24] If you can triple your income for the rest of your life, the $500 certification and two days,

[01:29] do you think it's worth the investment?

[01:32] Probably.

[01:33] And so the problem is that people think about the biggest investment as the stuff that they take

[01:37] their money and they put it into.

[01:39] And I'm going to be over.

[01:40] I'm going to be right right now.

[01:41] Your ability to earn money to provide value to the marketplace and solve problems for

[01:46] other people is how you will be able to make money.

[01:49] There's the value of the problem that you solve and what you charge for it.

[01:52] The bigger that number is, the more you can charge.

[01:55] That gap between their old problem and the solution that value is the percentage that you can take

[02:00] and put in your pocket as something that you have now created in this.

[02:03] And it could be a service, it could be products, it could be whatever.

[02:05] Your earning capacity is going to be the thing that generates you wealth.

[02:09] Do you want to be smart with your money and save it?

[02:11] Absolutely, because that gives you way more that you can play with.

[02:13] But when you're 20, even when you're 30 and in my belief, whatever age you are,

[02:17] I believe that you should take all of the excess money.

[02:20] Live as cheap as you can, take 100% of that excess money and invest it in education that increases

[02:26] your earning capacity.

[02:27] Because what happens is when you take that money, like that full bottom of course, right?

[02:30] And you take $25.00 per time, $2,000 a year.

[02:33] You're not a $50,000 a year in time.

[02:35] Cool, if I can live on 20, because I'm 20 years old and I can live with buddies and we can eat

[02:40] ramen soup and whatever.

[02:41] And I got 30 left over after taxes, 25, whatever.

[02:44] 25 grand can buy you a lot of education.

[02:46] I would rather you or I would rather me or somebody who's 20 or somebody who's 30, take $2,000

[02:52] a month, because that's with 25 grand is.

[02:53] And invest it in courses, coaching, mentorships, workshops and seminars every month.

[03:00] I'm putting that to K.

[03:01] Now you could put 2K into one opportunity and you're like, dude, I think real estate is cool.

[03:04] Cool.

[03:05] We're not doing real estate as my passive income.

[03:06] We're doing real estate is I'm going to get into the real estate game and I'm going to

[03:10] make it my active income and by the way, everybody who builds their wealth and real estate

[03:13] are actively spending their time in real estate.

[03:14] Don't believe what they're saying.

[03:15] They're like, dude, I did this deal and I made X amount of money.

[03:17] It's like, what was the process of finding deals?

[03:19] How many deals did you look at?

[03:20] How many conversations did you have?

[03:21] How many buildings did you walk?

[03:22] How many different general contractors?

[03:24] Oh, there is another stuff that has to happen.

[03:26] Right.

[03:26] Back to the point.

[03:27] Let's say that you take that $2,000 a month and you do that for four years.

[03:30] And I'm not saying do the four year degree.

[03:32] I think that is a play if you want to.

[03:33] I don't necessarily agree with it anymore in the marketplace that currently exists.

[03:36] Four years later, I fucking guarantee you that you will be making more than people who have

[03:41] four year degrees.

[03:42] You'll probably start making money by then first year.

[03:45] The amount of like copywriting courses and books and programs, mentorships and even one-on-one coaching.

[03:50] Like I think one-on-one coaching is in a phenomenal way to learn a new skill.

[03:53] If you're like, hey, I need to know how to buy media.

[03:56] I need to know how to run and add.

[03:57] Go pay someone who runs ads or teach people how to run ads.

[04:00] When you make that payment, you're seeing it as one class in your entrepreneurial degree.

[04:05] Rather than this $1,000 12,000 investment has to make me rich.

[04:10] You can make that shift is like, this is my course.

[04:12] Like when you get your degree in college, you're not like,

[04:14] oh, I'm going to take one class in Spanish.

[04:17] Graduate and get whatever job I want.

[04:19] No one thinks that way.

[04:20] But for some reason, to think about that when it comes to entrepreneurial stuff,

[04:23] you're not paying someone to think that they're going to be your savior.

[04:26] They're not going to save you from your life, do everything for you.

[04:29] No one person is going to teach you everything.

[04:30] I'll do my best on this channel, teach it stuff I know.

[04:32] But you have something to learn from everyone.

[04:35] Well, you know, like, that wasn't the value that I thought I was.

[04:38] It's like, you can still learn from that.

[04:39] You want to go to the person who's providing the most value for free.

[04:42] It's the easiest way for you to decrease your risk of purchase.

[04:45] If you follow someone's Instagram father YouTube,

[04:47] you see this stuff they put out and you're like, dude, this is really good.

[04:49] Like, this is a lot of new information that I didn't know and it's like very

[04:52] practical and I understand, like, hey, you already know that you like the person.

[04:55] Be, you already know that you're getting value from the person from the

[04:58] content they have.

[04:58] And so the likelihood that the thing that they have that's paid is going to be worse than that

[05:03] is low, you know, hopefully.

[05:04] Follow lots of people in a particular space.

[05:06] See the one that you drive with the most, you like their teaching style.

[05:09] You don't need to follow this stuff for forever to like,

[05:12] belabor the decision.

[05:12] Give yourself seven days because you know what's really even cooler than buying one

[05:15] person's, buy them all.

[05:17] And then you'll know what everyone knows.

[05:19] And then guess what happens?

[05:20] You become just as good or bad.

[05:21] Now you're making 80,000 dollars a year.

[05:23] Well, now we've got $4,000 a month that we can spend on coaching and mentorships and

[05:28] learnings and courses in one night.

[05:29] I always sing to myself like, I'm going to be the number one student.

[05:31] I'll just do whatever they say.

[05:33] I'll see what happens.

[05:33] And I'll do whatever they say.

[05:34] I'll see what happens.

[05:35] You want to replicate before you iterate.

[05:36] Before you say, I'm going to put my Alex sauce on it.

[05:38] Before you do that, just make sure that you can duplicate what they're doing.

[05:41] Because then you earn the right to make the iterations.

[05:43] Even if it's not perfectly your style, copy it first before you make the iterations.

[05:47] If you see it as a bridge that has many bricks on it, you have to lay all the bricks.

[05:51] And here's the bad part.

[05:52] Let's say you've got 30 bricks on this bridge to make your first dollar.

[05:54] The first dollar has to walk across the bridge.

[05:56] When you're 28 bricks in, you might not have made the first dollar yet.

[05:59] But you're 90% of the way there.

[06:01] And the speed with which people are able to traverse or cross that bridge is how well they

[06:05] identify which brick is missing and where they put their attention.

[06:08] That's where a lot of people get disheartened is that they will start building new bridges

[06:12] and get two three bricks and then they'll start building a new bridge, two three bricks.

[06:15] And they have lots of half built bridges and they never make it all the way across.

[06:18] Let's see your videographer.

[06:19] Are you like video stuff?

[06:20] Skills stack exponentially.

[06:22] You got a video skill.

[06:23] Now you got an editing skill.

[06:24] Now you understand social media, messaging, copyright and branding.

[06:28] Ooh, management, operations and leadership.

[06:31] See how that person starts to expand.

[06:33] You can imagine how their pay is going to dramatically increase.

[06:36] Because now you're a CM up, broadening your horizon and going deep in these other

[06:40] silos in all of a sudden, you're not entrepreneur.

[06:42] One is you have to make that decision that you're not going to spend all your money on stupid stuff.

[06:45] The second is that you are going to spend your money not on the S&P, but on the S&M.

[06:52] What?

[06:53] That's that you're going to spend it on you.

[06:55] Because that thing is going to compound a hell of a lot faster than 10% of your year.

[06:58] You can double triple 10x your earning capacity.

[07:00] The people with richest people in the world, they make a thousand times more.

[07:04] Jeff Bezos made $40 million in our last year.

[07:07] It's a lot.

[00:00] I started in Soto Software Company, started in Soto.

[00:02] Jim Weissensy, business started in Soto,

[00:04] a self-ememem company, and six other businesses

[00:06] over the last 13 years.

[00:07] The vast majority businesses that I talk to,

[00:09] the entrepreneurs think they're in one business,

[00:11] but they're actually in another.

[00:12] By only being able to solve one set of problems,

[00:15] they continue to jump from business to business to business.

[00:17] Rather than realize that there's one big problem,

[00:19] the business they're actually in,

[00:21] that unlocks all the enterprise value

[00:23] that gets into the next level.

[00:24] But if you want to make a big business,

[00:26] you want to build an asset,

[00:27] that makes you generationally wealthy, this is for you.

[00:29] I have made the mistake,

[00:31] and almost every business that I've been in,

[00:33] in thinking I was getting into one business,

[00:35] when in reality, I was getting into a very different business.

[00:37] And discovering the real business that you're actually in

[00:41] is what will unlock the amount of growth

[00:44] and money making that you really want to get into.

[00:46] It's usually the second and third level

[00:48] of entrepreneurship within whatever opportunity

[00:50] you're pursuing.

[00:51] So let me give you example kind of make this real.

[00:53] When I got into the Jim business, I liked fitness.

[00:56] And so I thought that the business was gonna be about,

[00:59] like Macros and results and workouts.

[01:03] And all of that, that's why I thought the business

[01:05] was gonna be about.

[01:06] But once I got into the business,

[01:08] I realized it was actually just about marketing and sales.

[01:11] That specific business is about marketing and sales overall.

[01:14] Now, what I make these generalizations,

[01:17] all businesses are like cars.

[01:19] Like if you don't have wheels,

[01:20] the car's not gonna move,

[01:20] if you don't gas, the car's not gonna move.

[01:22] If you don't have an engine, the car's not gonna move.

[01:23] But the question is, what is the biggest limiter?

[01:25] What's the biggest thing that gives you

[01:26] the most return in that specific

[01:29] vehicle or that specific business?

[01:31] And so I'm gonna walk you through four, five different businesses

[01:34] that I've been where what I thought it was,

[01:35] versus what it really was.

[01:37] And then I'll turn it back to you and thinking about how

[01:39] you can apply that same methodology.

[01:41] And I'll bet you many of you.

[01:42] And I get this because I have a lot of conversations

[01:44] with business owners today.

[01:45] They don't know what business they're really in.

[01:47] All right.

[01:48] So I thought it was about fitness,

[01:50] but it was actually about sales marketing.

[01:51] And if you look at the biggest fitness companies

[01:53] in the world, like especially in the Jim space,

[01:55] their acquisition machines.

[01:57] That's what they are very, very good at.

[02:00] The actual fitness component of it is actually pretty minor.

[02:05] Right?

[02:05] And I'll tell you this from talking to the franchise,

[02:07] or is you in many, many, many locations

[02:09] or privately, you know, in one's half thousand plus locations

[02:11] that the fitness stuff is almost an afterthought.

[02:13] They're like, yeah, yeah, get people to sweat, move around, whatever.

[02:16] Because the reality is that within fitness, for example,

[02:19] the biggest problem is that people don't show up

[02:20] because of other reasons.

[02:22] And so you have to always get more customers.

[02:25] The good news is that everyone's trying to lose weight

[02:27] three times a year.

[02:28] And so there are plenty of people.

[02:30] So that was the first business that I misunderstood

[02:32] what business I was really in.

[02:33] Now thankfully, quickly I learned that

[02:35] and then that became the skill set that I, you know,

[02:37] double down on.

[02:38] Now with that, I then was like, okay, well,

[02:41] I'm gonna start a sub-encode, which was to your labs.

[02:43] Now again, I thought that business was gonna be all about

[02:47] the product.

[02:48] I thought it was all gonna be about the stuff that's inside of it.

[02:51] And so I got Dr. Cash, you my good friend,

[02:53] who's bioheased PhD, biochemist,

[02:54] one of the smartest people being on earth.

[02:56] And I said, hey, man, can you make the best products?

[02:58] I said, make a sandwich you would actually,

[02:59] because he made all these things for Olympians

[03:02] and he would put together these trash bags full of

[03:05] like specific ingredients and specific compounds.

[03:07] And he's like, dude, these are gonna be way too expensive.

[03:09] Like, it's not gonna be commercially viable

[03:11] based on the quality of the ingredients.

[03:12] And I was like, dude, just make the best product,

[03:14] I'll figure out how to sell it.

[03:15] And so that was the focus that I had in pursue supplies.

[03:19] But guess what?

[03:20] Well, once I got into that business,

[03:21] I realized that it actually had very little

[03:24] to do with what was in the bottle.

[03:25] Because basically anything, anything that's in a bottle

[03:30] that you don't taste, the vast majority of products

[03:33] that are out there benefit off of placebo and no placebo.

[03:36] Basically, people taking something

[03:38] and then they feel better because it takes them.

[03:39] And I wanna be, I wanna be clear,

[03:40] placebo affects a real effect.

[03:42] So like, I'm about the effect.

[03:43] Whatever works for you, works for you.

[03:45] And that's not really the point of this talk.

[03:47] But more so that I got into the business thinking

[03:49] that what was inside the bottle was the thing that mattered.

[03:51] But the reality was what was on the outside

[03:52] of the thing that bottle and the thing that the bottle was next to.

[03:55] Meaning it became what I realized almost too late

[03:58] was that it's a business that's based on brand.

[04:00] It's based on branding and it's based on media

[04:03] in terms of having tons and tons of traffic.

[04:05] And so I thought I was building a product-based company

[04:08] that was gonna be based on what's inside the bottle.

[04:10] When everything that was limiting the business

[04:12] was on the outside of the bottle.

[04:13] And I saw the guys who were the biggest in the space

[04:15] and this is the little telltale sign, by the way,

[04:17] if you wanna hack this.

[04:18] As you look at the people who are the biggest

[04:19] in your space to take your model,

[04:21] take it to a national extreme and look.

[04:23] And I think there's a lot of wisdom

[04:24] that can be found from that and trying to reverse engineer,

[04:26] like what are the things that make this different?

[04:28] Now you might be like, and here's what I used to do.

[04:30] All right, so like, don't make this mistake.

[04:32] When I was in the gym industry,

[04:33] I would look like when I started out,

[04:34] like, oh my God, I can make way better work out

[04:36] than those guys.

[04:37] That's because those guys don't give a shit

[04:38] about their workouts because that's not the main thing

[04:40] in the business.

[04:41] I got into the sub- and business, oh my God.

[04:43] Like these guys are making hundreds of millions of dollars

[04:46] on this product that's just mediocre.

[04:47] Like the thing is that most of the customers

[04:49] that are buying it don't even know the difference anyways,

[04:51] which means that your differentiator

[04:54] isn't actually making it different.

[04:56] You're the only one who knows your differentiator,

[04:57] which is not good, your customer has to realize

[05:00] what the differentiator is.

[05:01] And so the thing is is that for most supplements,

[05:03] the differentiator is LeBron takes it or so and so takes it

[05:07] or I think this is cool or my friend Sally likes it, right?

[05:11] Or, and I'll be clear on a consumable perspective,

[05:13] if it has a flavor, then the flavor becomes very important

[05:17] in the long run in terms of how good it tastes,

[05:18] because most people take Adewunks, they think it tastes good.

[05:20] And because they feel good about it,

[05:21] not because it was inside of it.

[05:23] All right, so just to be clear,

[05:24] I got into the gym business and I thought it was about fitness,

[05:25] but it was really about marketing sales.

[05:27] I got into prestige labs,

[05:28] to some of the business, and I thought it was about

[05:30] the stuff inside the bottle and really about bread

[05:32] and building a big media traffic machine.

[05:34] And then I was like, okay, I think I'm getting the hang of this,

[05:36] I've just making mistakes over and over again.

[05:38] So then I got into the software business, and I was like,

[05:41] okay, I get it.

[05:42] Everything's about marketing sales,

[05:44] I'll be able to sell the share of this,

[05:45] and guess what?

[05:46] We sure is how good, because I knew how to market in sell.

[05:49] And so then I got into the software business,

[05:51] and I realized by the way, side note,

[05:53] software tends to sell itself, you know why?

[05:55] Because if you can have technologies,

[05:57] I say, hey, there's that thing that you're doing,

[05:58] that this will do automatically, not a very hard pitch,

[06:02] but the problem with software is actually delivering

[06:04] on the promise.

[06:05] And so it actually is a very product driven business,

[06:08] because anyone can sell it.

[06:10] The software's not that difficult,

[06:12] so at least this is my experience with this.

[06:14] All right, so take that with my big Himalayan size

[06:17] grain of salt.

[06:17] For me, that's what I realized that product was the main thing,

[06:20] and guess what I don't wanna start it out?

[06:21] I outsource the product.

[06:23] I had it outsource dev team, make the product for me,

[06:26] which I then realized was the core part of the business.

[06:28] It's like starting a sell company,

[06:29] then trying to have an agency,

[06:30] build your sell company, come before you.

[06:32] If you're in the sell business,

[06:33] or you're in the consumer product goods business,

[06:35] outsourcing acquisition, outsourcing brand,

[06:38] outsourcing media, it's like,

[06:40] it's, that's the business,

[06:42] like that's the business you're in.

[06:44] It's not the stuff inside the bottle.

[06:45] All right, so give me another one.

[06:48] So I had a gym owner from a minute,

[06:52] from many, many years ago,

[06:53] he was in, he became a Julemard,

[06:55] he was a licensee, awesome guy.

[06:57] And he started, he had a couple of locations

[07:00] and his wife started a cleaning business,

[07:02] because they got into Airbnb's,

[07:03] because he started making money in the gym,

[07:04] so he started investing,

[07:05] and he realized he actually liked to really

[07:06] stay better than he liked the gym, which is awesome.

[07:07] Great.

[07:09] And so they started a cleaning company

[07:11] to clean houses for the Airbnb's,

[07:14] but then they realized they got in the Airbnb community,

[07:16] and they also got in just like that area,

[07:18] and they're like, you know what,

[07:18] we could probably just sell cleaning to other people.

[07:21] And so this was interesting.

[07:22] I had dinner with him, and he was saying,

[07:24] I was like, so what's your LTV to pack?

[07:25] He's like, oh, dude, cacks like $25.

[07:27] And I was like, what?

[07:28] He's like, oh, getting customers,

[07:30] including not a problem.

[07:31] And this is, and he was like,

[07:32] this is so different from the gym business,

[07:34] because the gym business is getting the customers,

[07:36] getting him to arm wrestle,

[07:38] Susie for an hour to get her to say,

[07:39] yes, she's gonna stop eating crap

[07:41] and start coming to the gym three times a week.

[07:43] But if you just say, hey, I'm gonna clean your stuff

[07:45] and you don't have to do anything,

[07:46] not a very hard sale.

[07:48] And so he said the real problem that I'm having right now

[07:50] is actually getting people to do the cleaning.

[07:53] Right?

[07:53] He's actually getting, you know,

[07:55] people who speak English,

[07:56] who don't steal, who show up on time,

[07:57] and do all that and like do a good job consistently,

[08:00] means that that's actually the problem of the business.

[08:03] And so I had this, it was a great moment

[08:04] for me because I love seeing the finding,

[08:06] found out, finding out what is the real business

[08:08] behind the business?

[08:09] And so if you're in the cleaning business,

[08:11] you're not in the cleaning business,

[08:13] you're in the recruiting and training business.

[08:15] You have to learn how to get low skill labor

[08:19] and in high volume to show up for you consistently,

[08:24] which is a cultural thing, it's a training thing,

[08:26] and part of that has to do with brand,

[08:27] but a lot of it is just having the incentive system

[08:30] structured such that that type of person can still succeed.

[08:34] And he had a cool little thing that he did.

[08:36] He did it, he had a setup where they got paid

[08:38] not by hour, but by clean.

[08:40] And so they were actually incentivized.

[08:42] And so basically, and this, by the way,

[08:44] a big pro tip on business,

[08:45] is you wanna have paired incentives.

[08:46] So it's like having quality and speed.

[08:50] And so it's like if you have a customer support team,

[08:52] you wanna measure them not just on percentage of tickets

[08:54] that are absolutely resolved.

[08:56] You also wanna have speed of completion.

[08:57] If you only have one, then you have lots of people

[09:00] responding as quickly as possible,

[09:01] but not getting it done.

[09:02] And on the flip side, if you just do on

[09:04] rather the tickets completely resolved,

[09:05] people won't move fast enough.

[09:07] And so it's having paired metrics.

[09:09] Andy Grove talks about this in high output management,

[09:12] really good book if you ever want to learn more about ops,

[09:15] pretty high level though, just to be really honest with you.

[09:17] But it's a great book.

[09:18] Anyhow.

[09:19] And so the paired mixture for him was you get,

[09:22] you can clean as many houses you can in a day,

[09:24] and I pay you per clean.

[09:26] And so that drove up as productivity per employee.

[09:29] And so the paired metric was that if you don't do a good job,

[09:32] you have to go back and do it again and no cost.

[09:35] And so that was the deal.

[09:36] And that was also part of his offer for the cleaning thing

[09:38] and it worked really great.

[09:39] And so like if you don't think we do a good job,

[09:40] we'll come back and clean your whole house again

[09:41] and we'll do it for free.

[09:42] And so that was the paired metric.

[09:44] Again, so he thought he was getting the acquisition

[09:46] businesses like dude, I can get customers all day long

[09:48] in this business.

[09:49] And he, it's because he came from the general

[09:50] and expected it to be the same.

[09:51] And so I've noticed this is this continued thing

[09:54] is that when I think I'm getting into

[09:55] is actually not the real constraint of the business.

[09:58] And I'm gonna, I don't wanna leapfrog ahead here,

[10:00] but like this is a little bit of foreshadowing

[10:02] for the woman in the red dress.

[10:03] All right, so I'll just leave that there.

[10:05] All right, so I'll give you one for anybody

[10:07] who's in like the consulting space

[10:08] or professional services space.

[10:10] If you sell to businesses, you sell how to market,

[10:12] how to, I mean, even accounting.

[10:14] You sell lawyer stuff, you do consulting in general.

[10:15] Any of that stuff, you think that you're in the marketing

[10:19] sales business, right?

[10:20] Because that's what people will tell you, right?

[10:21] But if you really wanna play this game at a high level.

[10:24] Now, again, it's a car.

[10:26] If you have no marketing in sales,

[10:27] you're not gonna have a business, right?

[10:28] Done.

[10:29] But which is the things is the thing

[10:31] that unlocks the biggest level of growth.

[10:33] It's actually, again, look at the biggest companies in the space.

[10:35] You look at EY or SNUANG, you look at KPMG,

[10:38] you look at McKinsey, you look at BAN,

[10:41] you look at BCG, some of these big public massive firms,

[10:43] multi-billion dollar, $100 billion companies.

[10:46] What is the thing, what is the business that really in?

[10:50] They're in the recruiting business as well.

[10:52] And specifically, the talent management business,

[10:54] because different than the cleaning business,

[10:57] now structurally it's recruiting for sure.

[10:59] But it's at a completely different level.

[11:01] They're trying to skim the cream of the crop,

[11:04] because how do you scale expertise?

[11:07] They're intelligence on demand.

[11:09] If you go to the, you go to Polsonale,

[11:11] you go to some big, big law firm, right?

[11:13] In Manhattan, right?

[11:14] Some big law firm, in the Manhattan address,

[11:16] they have to attract the absolute best and brightest people.

[11:18] Otherwise, the brand will digrate over time.

[11:21] But how do you attract the best and brightest people?

[11:23] Well, that's why a lot of these professional services

[11:25] businesses are based on partnerships,

[11:26] they're limited partnerships, they're LLP's.

[11:29] All right?

[11:29] And so that's because anybody, they have a track

[11:31] for eventually becoming an owner in the business.

[11:32] And most service-based businesses

[11:34] that rely on expertise have tracks

[11:38] for people to have small slices of ownership.

[11:40] And they're willing to have a small slice

[11:42] of a $200 billion pie rather than start out on their own.

[11:44] And they also have subspecialties underneath of that.

[11:46] You're an IP lawyer, you're a defense lawyer, whatever.

[11:50] They've all these different, you know,

[11:51] subtracts underneath of that.

[11:53] And so again, you get into the consulting business

[11:55] and people say, hey, it's about marketing and sales,

[11:57] but really if you want to scale.

[11:59] And again, this is the thing, if you want to scale,

[12:01] if you just want to make money, then sure,

[12:03] just market and sell and you can make a buck, right?

[12:05] That's not the problem.

[12:06] But if you want to get big, you want to build an asset,

[12:09] the business you get in there is on talent.

[12:12] And how do you retain talent?

[12:13] And how do you improve the value of that talent?

[12:16] And make them look.

[12:17] Because otherwise, what happens if you do a great job

[12:19] with talent in that business, but you don't retain them?

[12:21] They take your customers and they leave,

[12:23] they start their own shop, they hang in their own chandelop.

[12:25] That's the game there.

[12:27] And so the gig, the figure, what you have to figure out,

[12:29] this is the big billion dollar problem, is what you have to do.

[12:33] Now, I'll leave it at that, because I think I'll be the point.

[12:37] Now, here's why this is important,

[12:39] is that if you know the business that you're really in,

[12:42] you actually can get paid to solve the right problem.

[12:45] Now, the way that I like to think about this

[12:47] is that as entrepreneurs would get paid to solve props

[12:50] and the bigger the problem, the bigger the pay off.

[12:52] And so I like to match it like I've got this big,

[12:54] massive wall in front of me.

[12:56] And the thing is, I see the wall, but I don't know how thick it is.

[12:58] But I have an idea that it's pretty thick,

[13:01] because I'm like shoot.

[13:02] I don't know how I'm going to get through this wall.

[13:03] But I like to eventually envision myself

[13:05] that there's this big pile of money on the other side.

[13:07] And I remember having this conversation

[13:09] with the portfolio company, we're like,

[13:10] hey, we think that we need to build software into this business

[13:12] and actually transform this business

[13:14] from a media company into a software company.

[13:16] And it's like, this is a big strategic bet.

[13:18] Like, a lot of resources, a lot of time,

[13:20] basically a lot of, like, lost growth.

[13:22] Like, instead of us gasing it on this side,

[13:25] we're actually going to basically maintain here

[13:26] and then deploy a lot of resources

[13:28] in the growing software.

[13:30] And so I was talking to the founder,

[13:31] he was like, this is really hard.

[13:34] This is going to be really, really hard for us to do.

[13:36] And I was like, yeah, yeah, it's going to be really hard.

[13:39] And I said, but if we solve it,

[13:42] we get an extra $250 million.

[13:45] So it is that fuel worth it.

[13:47] And he was like, well, when you say like that,

[13:49] I was like, right.

[13:50] So for 250 million bucks, when I solve it, yeah,

[13:53] it feels a lot more approachable

[13:55] or at least it feels worth it.

[13:57] And so I'd encourage you to think like,

[13:59] what is the ultimate price tag

[14:00] of me solving this problem worth?

[14:02] And then all of a sudden you're like,

[14:03] okay, then you can actually appropriately allocate

[14:06] your personal resources to solving the problem.

[14:09] Because it really will make you a lot of money.

[14:11] Now, a lot of times we need to frame the problem

[14:16] for what we get by solving it.

[14:17] Otherwise we have what it's solving it.

[14:20] And so knowing the business that you're really in

[14:23] isn't really what you think it is,

[14:24] it's often the second or third order effect.

[14:27] And that's the big wall.

[14:29] And so you come in like my friend did.

[14:32] He starts a quarantine,

[14:33] he's like, I'm gonna make so much money here.

[14:34] And he's like, oh shoot, I got a higher in staff people.

[14:37] Boom, he sees this

[14:38] big wall and he's like, oh, I'm not equipped

[14:41] to solve this problem.

[14:42] And this, here it is.

[14:44] This is the meat.

[14:45] This is the part that I've been waiting to get you

[14:46] and hammer you guys on.

[14:48] Is, hey, and if you'd like to get personalized advice

[14:51] on how to scale your business and unlock the enterprise value,

[14:53] kind of like the stuff that we're talking about here today.

[14:55] Aquis is not calm, just started its new workshop division

[14:58] where we host one or two days a month

[15:01] at our headquarters here in Vegas for businesses

[15:04] that we're not necessarily invested in

[15:05] nor do you have to become a portfolio company.

[15:08] But it's a way for us to meet more companies

[15:09] for you to meet us, for us to help you solve some problems

[15:11] unlocks in big value.

[15:12] That sounds a little interesting.

[15:13] Go to Aquis is not calm, hit the scaling button.

[15:15] And our team will see if you qualify.

[15:16] Hope to see you soon.

[15:18] The woman in the red dress appears now.

[15:22] As soon as you realize the business you're really in

[15:25] and you also realize that you're not equipped to solve it

[15:28] because you don't know what the hell you're doing

[15:30] and you don't know what you got into to begin with.

[15:33] That is when the woman in the red dress appears.

[15:35] Now if you're not familiar with my stuff,

[15:37] the one in the red dress is any shiny object.

[15:39] It's the distraction.

[15:40] And the interesting thing about the one in the red dress

[15:42] is that the better you get to the business, the hotter she is.

[15:44] And so you learn to say no to a two out of 10.

[15:48] Yeah, because you've got some crackhead lady on the side

[15:50] of the street.

[15:51] She's like, hey, let's go.

[15:52] I'm like, I'm good.

[15:53] I'd rather just not get climdia slash whatever you've got.

[15:56] It's all businesses have shit.

[15:59] They all have shit.

[16:00] They all have a big brick wall

[16:02] that you have to come in contact with.

[16:03] And guess what?

[16:04] That's why you get paid to solve the fucking problem.

[16:07] That's why you make outsized returns

[16:10] is because you have to be willing to current front

[16:12] with the sledgehammer in hand,

[16:13] not knowing how thick the wall is going to be

[16:16] and start hammering away at it.

[16:17] With the hope that when you get to the other side,

[16:20] it will have been worth it and often it is.

[16:22] Now, I wanna drive this point home.

[16:25] So if you have a roofing business,

[16:27] if you have a restaurant business,

[16:28] if you have a dry cleaning business,

[16:30] all you have to do is look at the world and see,

[16:32] is there any version of this business

[16:34] that is a billion dollar company?

[16:35] Or even a hundred billion dollar company?

[16:37] Whatever your goals are.

[16:38] And most times you'll find that there is that.

[16:41] But you'll also find that it just takes time to get there.

[16:43] Because the other times, let's say small businesses

[16:46] actually happens a lot, right?

[16:48] Is hey, I've got a roofing contracting business.

[16:51] Okay, cool.

[16:52] And they say, hey, should I jump into a different opportunity?

[16:54] You can be like, well, what are you doing?

[16:55] They're like, I'm doing four million top line.

[16:57] I'm doing a million bucks in bottom line.

[16:58] Okay, okay.

[16:59] Well, why don't you just 10 X the size of your company?

[17:04] And then they say, well, I've got this big concrete wall

[17:07] in front of me, right?

[17:08] What they describe next is the real problem of that business,

[17:12] the business that they're really in,

[17:14] that they didn't know they were getting into.

[17:16] And I want to be clear, this only happens at scale.

[17:18] All right, so once like all businesses,

[17:20] like if you're, if you're, if you're new to entrepreneurship,

[17:22] you gotta figure out the basics of everything.

[17:24] You gotta figure out that a wheel is round.

[17:26] You gotta make sure that gasoline is combustible.

[17:28] You gotta make sure that there's some sort of engine.

[17:29] It might be a selling machine in the beginning

[17:31] that's part of your car.

[17:32] It might be a remote control car.

[17:34] They can only go, you know, 10 miles an hour.

[17:36] But like there's gotta be some engine,

[17:37] otherwise you're not getting any movement, right?

[17:39] But when you start really one-two-achief scale,

[17:41] there's going to be a big, hairy problem.

[17:43] There's going to be a big concrete wall in front of you

[17:45] that you don't know how thick it is.

[17:47] And that is the work.

[17:50] That is where the enterprise values unlocked.

[17:52] And the vast majority of the time,

[17:54] when we're investing in a company,

[17:55] or we take over a company,

[17:57] we are just comfortable with the fact

[17:59] that there's a concrete wall and we're just gonna chip away at it.

[18:02] And so a lot of the work that I do

[18:03] is actually expectation management with the team is saying,

[18:06] yeah, this is gonna take two years.

[18:07] Yeah, this will take three years.

[18:09] And they're like, wait three years, I'm like, yeah.

[18:11] Well, I'm in this for, like, I mean, let me put it this way.

[18:14] If in five years, we had a hundred million dollars

[18:16] to enterprise to this business, is it worth it?

[18:18] They're like, well, yeah, I'm like, do you think we can solve it

[18:20] in five years?

[18:21] And like, well, yeah, then guess what they don't do?

[18:24] Be willing to wait five years.

[18:26] And so the thing is, is that sometimes it takes somebody

[18:28] from the outside, is they like, dude, let's zoom all the way out.

[18:30] If you solve this for a hundred million bucks, is it worth it?

[18:31] Yeah, okay, well, it's gonna take that long.

[18:34] Oh, huh.

[18:36] And then things start to settle.

[18:37] And then you get this, you get less frenetic energy.

[18:40] The amount of wasted effort for entrepreneurs

[18:42] that goes into this ideation of what else they could be

[18:46] doing with their time or with their skill sets.

[18:48] Honestly, it's like, oh, great analogy.

[18:51] It's like, it's like being single versus being married.

[18:54] All right, hear me out.

[18:56] Is that when you're single, at least for me,

[18:58] when I was a guy, I would say 30% of my time was,

[19:01] or I'm being generous, maybe 40% of my time.

[19:03] Might have been higher.

[19:04] Anyway, I'm not getting into.

[19:05] Was allocated to like the idea of chasing tail.

[19:08] So it was like, man, what if that worked out?

[19:10] What if that worked out?

[19:11] And I'm spending multiple plates.

[19:13] I'm doing lead nurture, right?

[19:14] I'm working the pipeline, I'm planning seeds.

[19:16] I'm making a quick e-common and responding to a story, whatever.

[19:19] And so I'm working leads.

[19:22] And so as I was doing this, right?

[19:24] All my attention was going to possibility

[19:27] was to potential was to what if, right?

[19:30] As soon as I got married, the biggest gift that marriage got me,

[19:34] was it got me 30% to 40% of my time back?

[19:36] Was I didn't have to think about this?

[19:38] Like this part of my life was not done, but like, solved.

[19:41] As in like, I'm gonna be with Layla.

[19:43] Cool, great.

[19:45] Now, all the extra tension that used to go to like,

[19:48] possibility in terms of who else could be,

[19:52] goes back into the main thing, which for me was business.

[19:55] Now, within the business it works the same way

[19:56] is that I think most of you guys are dating your business,

[20:00] but you need to get married to your business.

[20:02] You guys are trying to have friends with benefits with your business,

[20:04] trying to go on dates, maybe date a couple of the business

[20:07] on the side, have some side checks,

[20:08] and then you're wondering why your relationship

[20:10] with your businesses and that healthy.

[20:12] If you go all in on the business, the business will go all in on you.

[20:16] And I promise you, it's just that the guy who's beating you right now,

[20:19] he's just committed.

[20:20] He's just married.

[20:21] He's just married to the business.

[20:22] He's like, I mean, if it takes me five years,

[20:24] it takes me five years, but like, where am I going?

[20:26] Like, I'm in this.

[20:27] I'm in it for the long haul.

[20:29] And he sees with the value of a 30 year marriage would be,

[20:32] or a 50 year marriage would be with his business.

[20:36] And so, if you know the business you're really in,

[20:39] which you usually find out a couple of years into the business,

[20:42] which is once you solve the basics of business,

[20:44] you realize, oh, this is the big Harry problem.

[20:47] And then you don't know how long it will last,

[20:48] but I promise you that someone else has solved it,

[20:50] and I promise you that they weren't super geniuses.

[20:52] They just were willing to commit.

[20:54] They were willing to swing the hammer at the wall

[20:57] for a very long period of time, and willing to zoom out

[21:00] and say, I can think in five year increments.

[21:02] And do I think that if I put everything I have

[21:05] and not get distracted with the woman in the red dress,

[21:07] not have the side chick, not have these other businesses

[21:10] I'm flirting with that I'm keeping warm on the side.

[21:13] These networking lunches for this guy

[21:15] and might do a partnership with,

[21:16] even though it has nothing to do with this business,

[21:17] because he says, hey, you're good at this.

[21:19] I'm good at this.

[21:20] We could do this thing together.

[21:22] None of that.

[21:23] I mean, no, I'm just,

[21:24] I'm just gonna keep slamming at this wall

[21:25] because if I just get this one thing right,

[21:28] if I just break through this wall,

[21:30] I won't unlock all of the wealth that I've ever wanted.

[21:33] But there is a big, thick, massive, gray boring wall

[21:37] between there and where you wanna go.

[21:39] And it's just who's willing to keep

[21:40] swinging the hammer for a long period of time

[21:42] without getting distracted without thinking

[21:43] there's smarter than there.

[21:45] Keeping awesome, fucking slay, love you all.

[21:48] Bye.

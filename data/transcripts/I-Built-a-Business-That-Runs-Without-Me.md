[00:00] Poor people do the wrong things.

[00:02] Rich people do the right things.

[00:04] Well, I'll leave people own the right things.

[00:07] Hi, my name is Alex from Ozy,

[00:10] I'm the owner of Acquisition.com,

[00:12] it's portfolio companies,

[00:13] the $85 million a year.

[00:15] And so, what I do is make this video for you guys,

[00:17] most of the nation,

[00:18] to help you avoid some of the mistakes that I made along the way.

[00:21] And one of the things was understanding

[00:23] how to turn my active income into passive income,

[00:27] using a single mental model.

[00:28] That's what I'm going to share with you guys today.

[00:30] All right.

[00:31] And so, part of the difficulty of making this switch

[00:34] is understanding what you get paid on,

[00:38] versus where you get returns.

[00:40] All right, so a lot of people think that their business

[00:42] is actually really valuable and in fact,

[00:43] it isn't because it's really just a job that they surrounded

[00:46] some self-worth.

[00:47] They're still self-employed, they're not truly owners.

[00:49] Right? And a lot of people likes to say,

[00:50] I'm a business owner and it makes the feel good

[00:51] in search of your ego,

[00:52] but the reality is that you're really just,

[00:54] you do the job of probably four or five people.

[00:56] And that's okay, because that's how entrepreneurship

[00:58] works in the beginning, right?

[00:59] You have to work a lot to have

[01:00] in these slowly outsource and delegate pieces of responsibility.

[01:03] But what's key, and this is one of the things

[01:05] that what has been one of those valuable lessons for me,

[01:07] is understanding how to jump two steps forward.

[01:09] All right, so here we go.

[01:10] So the typical entrepreneurial path,

[01:11] and this was a huge aha moment I had,

[01:13] probably a year or two ago, was that, I was like,

[01:16] so this business continues to grow

[01:18] because I outsource what I'm doing,

[01:20] and then I start doing the next thing, right?

[01:21] That makes sense, right?

[01:22] You're like, you get rid of the stuff that you're doing

[01:23] this lower value, and you start doing the things

[01:24] that are high value, and you continue this process

[01:26] over and over again.

[01:27] And that's the entrepreneurial journey.

[01:29] But I was like, what if I delegated the stuff

[01:32] that I'm doing now, and then I got someone else

[01:34] to do the next thing that I'm supposed to be doing?

[01:36] I was like, then the business would still grow,

[01:39] and I would just own it.

[01:40] So I was like, so I just need to do,

[01:42] I just need to jump two steps, instead of just jumping one.

[01:46] So I've been doing this whole thing of just jumping

[01:47] one step ahead, pushing, delegating what I'm doing now

[01:51] to someone else, and then learning the new skill,

[01:54] when I should have been doing, which is saying,

[01:55] who here has the skill that I need to learn,

[01:57] and has already done it, and probably do it faster than me,

[02:00] and delegate what I'm doing now,

[02:01] and then find that other person have them

[02:03] do what I'm supposed to be doing,

[02:04] and then all of a sudden, this business continues

[02:06] to just grow, just like it did with me running it,

[02:08] except I'm not running it anymore.

[02:10] And so here's what's interesting.

[02:11] It's that a lot of people think their businesses

[02:13] make a lot more money than they really do,

[02:14] because they're getting returns on a very small amount

[02:17] of the actual business that they own the enterprise,

[02:20] versus with their making from being a high-skilled individual.

[02:24] Now, it's good to have lots of skills

[02:25] because it's the way that you gain perspective

[02:27] from which to make judgments on the talent

[02:29] that you're going to hire, and ultimately outsource

[02:31] the doing within the company, or the thinking,

[02:33] or the managing, or the leading within the company.

[02:35] You have to know how to do it in order to recognize

[02:37] and tell another people.

[02:38] And so a lot of people try and jump that step,

[02:39] and this is one of the things that I think,

[02:41] I do think it's true, I could be wrong,

[02:43] but I think it's true that the degree to which you've grown

[02:46] a business will cap, your business will cap

[02:49] at where you stop running it, I think.

[02:51] I could be wrong there.

[02:52] I don't know, but that's just what I'm saying,

[02:54] I get messages every day from guys who are like,

[02:56] hey man, you know, our business is doing 50-grant a month,

[02:58] they're really, really ready to delegate it.

[03:00] And I'm like, I mean, it's probably not gonna grow as fast

[03:03] as you want it to grow, if you're not really the one doing it.

[03:05] Now, again, that could be a belief that I have,

[03:06] because I mean, that's where people are better,

[03:08] growing things than I am.

[03:09] Let me pause there for a second,

[03:10] and give you an interesting tidbit.

[03:11] So in 2018, we did $17 million in profit

[03:16] from two of our businesses, right?

[03:18] Put together, it's in our fitness space.

[03:20] And now, this year we'll probably finish,

[03:22] those two businesses will do about 8.1 million.

[03:25] We're kind of running at that pace,

[03:26] I think that's what we'll finish this year.

[03:28] And that's still with COVID for half a year.

[03:29] So I think that business will go up and recover.

[03:32] But the point is, the difference between

[03:34] when we were making $17 million in the difference between now,

[03:37] it's making $8 million is that I don't do anything now.

[03:40] And so my business is believe it or not,

[03:42] more valuable now, those two businesses, particularly,

[03:44] are more valuable now, that I don't do anything

[03:47] within those businesses, and they were when I did everything

[03:49] in those businesses.

[03:50] And so I went from being very rich

[03:52] because of what I did to being wealthy

[03:54] because of what I own, right?

[03:55] Because I get returns on this business.

[03:57] And so for me to get 20% returns on this business,

[03:59] I have to go for $8 million this year to $9.6 million

[04:02] next year, which seems ridiculously easy to do.

[04:04] Given what we have now, because now I can see all the pieces,

[04:06] and I can assemble the business, rather than building

[04:09] the business, which is I think what ends up becoming

[04:11] the owner hat, right?

[04:13] If you go from employee to self-employed to owner,

[04:16] right, owners assemble businesses.

[04:18] This is why words matter, right?

[04:20] Dialectics matter.

[04:20] How you describe the thing that you do matters, right?

[04:23] So if you are self-employed, you're building the business.

[04:26] You're doing the building of the business,

[04:28] whereas if you're an owner, you assemble the people

[04:30] who are building the business for you.

[04:32] And the thing is, is it takes skills of knowing

[04:34] what each of those roles are supposed to do.

[04:35] So when someone comes in, says,

[04:36] hey, I'm going to be a really good director of marketing.

[04:37] You can talk to them, and then you can hear quickly,

[04:39] like, you don't know what you're talking about.

[04:41] I'm going to be a director of sales.

[04:42] Well, you don't know what you're talking about.

[04:43] I'm going to be director of customer success.

[04:45] Well, you don't know what you're talking about, right?

[04:46] And the idea is, and here's a really big nugget

[04:48] for you should write down right now,

[04:50] if you're not learning from your interview process.

[04:54] If you're not learning from the people

[04:56] who you were thinking about considering for this job

[04:58] or this opening or this need that needs to be solved

[05:00] with your business.

[05:01] If you talk to 20 people for a head of customer success,

[05:04] and you didn't learn anything, then you shouldn't hire any of them.

[05:07] The idea is, you should be able to quickly see

[05:09] throughout the interview process, all the things

[05:11] that you're not doing, because they should be able

[05:12] to take their experience and tell you what you're missing.

[05:15] And then when you see that, you actually learn more

[05:17] about the role as you talk to these people,

[05:20] and then that person who you ultimately do hire

[05:22] should know more than you, right?

[05:24] As you were like, wait a second, how can that person

[05:27] know more than me, but you still have to make a judgment, right?

[05:30] And so the idea is to have perspective

[05:32] in which to make a judgment, right?

[05:33] Like, if I know more than you do about customer success,

[05:36] then you're not going to be good enough, right?

[05:38] So the more you can set as your baseline level of knowledge,

[05:41] the more you can raise the bar.

[05:42] And so ultimately, that's what I think entrepreneurs should

[05:44] be able to do is, is that we have to learn about every aspect

[05:45] of the business, because we want somebody

[05:47] surpasses us in those ways when they come in.

[05:50] And the more we level up all of our skill sets,

[05:52] the more we can make better judgments

[05:54] about who's going to succeed in this role.

[05:55] And we can also set the tone of how excellent they should be.

[05:58] Because imagine you go into a business

[05:59] and the business owner doesn't know anything.

[06:01] You're like, god, I don't have to do anything here,

[06:03] because this guy doesn't know anything, right?

[06:05] Whereas if this guy knows so much about the role that you're

[06:07] trying to do, and you know just a little bit more

[06:09] than them, you're going to be on your toes at all

[06:10] times because you know that this guy's legit, right?

[06:12] Or this gals legit, right?

[06:14] And so that's the idea over time is that in the beginning,

[06:17] we're doing the things.

[06:18] So first, you're doing the wrong things, which is why you're

[06:19] poor, right?

[06:20] And then you start doing the right things, which is what makes you

[06:22] rich.

[06:22] And then you start transitioning from doing the right things

[06:24] to owning the right things, which is what makes you wealthy.

[06:26] And the way to own the right things is to learn how to assemble

[06:29] a business with all the players by taking two steps forward

[06:32] and seeing what you are about to start doing, identifying

[06:35] rather than me doing it, I think, who not how?

[06:39] And then I have the perspective

[06:40] for which to make a judgment on that person who can fill that gap.

[06:42] And then all of a sudden, I take this step back.

[06:44] I own the thing and the thing runs and grows without me.

[06:47] And that is how you transition from being an active

[06:49] to a passive owner, right?

[06:51] And so that's the goal.

[06:53] And so for me, it took me a long time

[06:54] to make that jump and understand.

[06:55] It's like, well, if I can delegate this now,

[06:57] I can also delegate the next thing by finding

[06:59] who has the skill by learning enough about it,

[07:01] to recognize who has the talent and give it to them.

[07:04] That's the idea.

[07:05] And so if you can do that within your business,

[07:06] that is how you can turn active to passive.

[07:08] That's how you can go from being rich to being wealthy.

[07:10] That's how you can transition from getting paid

[07:13] for what you do to getting returns on what you own.

[07:15] And that's the goal that I have for everyone

[07:17] here in Mose Nation and everyone else

[07:18] in the world who gives a damn bowl what they do.

[07:20] Anyways, I hope you're doing amazingly well

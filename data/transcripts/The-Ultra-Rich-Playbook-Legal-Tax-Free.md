[00:00] How the Ultra Rich get rich and avoid taxes legally.

[00:03] And if you don't know how I am, I have Zoxamosi.

[00:05] I got my first $100 million by age 32.

[00:09] And I did that by taking $42 million

[00:12] from distributions for my first big company Jim launch.

[00:15] And I ended up selling that company for $46.2 million.

[00:18] I reinvested that $42 million

[00:20] in distributions into a portfolio of companies

[00:23] that today at Acquisitor.com.

[00:25] Just over $200 million a year.

[00:26] And so that's my evidence to why I have

[00:29] something worth saying about this.

[00:31] Now, that being said, I'm going to split this video into two parts.

[00:34] One is the four strategies that the Ultra Rich use

[00:36] in order to get wealthy.

[00:37] And then the second half, I'm going to explain how you can use

[00:40] those same four strategies to reverse engineer a $10 million goal.

[00:44] And the reason I use $10 million as the net worth goal

[00:47] is because $10 million at $45 per year

[00:49] which would be basically a risk-free investment strategy.

[00:53] You'd be able to live like the top one percent

[00:55] into days market.

[00:56] So you could move these dollars up as dollars get inflated

[00:59] and all of that kind of stuff.

[01:01] But for now, these are the big four strategies.

[01:03] And so these developed over time as my understanding of money improved.

[01:07] And so for me, I now want to make a billion dollars

[01:11] or at least be worth a billion dollars.

[01:15] Ha, lots of zeros.

[01:16] OK.

[01:17] So the first version of this that I thought in order for me

[01:20] to be worth a billion dollars was to make $1.5 billion.

[01:29] I know a lot of zeros.

[01:30] In income, all right?

[01:34] Because after taxes, which would be 67% taxes in the US,

[01:38] which is the highest federal tax rate that you have to pay,

[01:41] you'd be left with $1 billion of raw post tax.

[01:46] OK, that's the zero leverage version of making money.

[01:50] So this is just income generation.

[01:53] The two of this is thinking, OK, well, if I make a billion dollars,

[01:58] if I make income every year, I'm going to invest a certain percentage

[02:01] of that income into making money, for me, passively.

[02:05] And so this feels harder than making $100 million per year

[02:12] and reinvesting that money at 9%.

[02:15] So the clear point here is I'm just saying,

[02:17] this is just the S&P.

[02:19] This is just the market.

[02:20] This is the doing anything fancy.

[02:21] You're just buying indexes of the S&P 500.

[02:24] Now, at $100 million a year, in 10 years, you would make $1 billion.

[02:32] Now, that's because this post taxes, you'd have 600 and $67 million

[02:39] post tax income that you then invest at that same 9%,

[02:44] which would get you your billion dollars after a decade.

[02:47] You're like, OK, well, making $100 million an income versus making $1.5

[02:52] billion an income over however long period of time, this feels a little easier

[02:56] because now I'm using two things.

[02:58] I'm generating income.

[03:00] Plus, I'm using public equities.

[03:03] All right, so I'm using passive investment strategies for things that are

[03:06] readily available to the public for everyone.

[03:09] The V3 version of this, it gets spicier and spicier every time,

[03:14] is that you make $100 million per year.

[03:19] And you own the asset, you own the business that makes this much money.

[03:23] And you sell it at $1.12.

[03:27] When I say 12x, I mean, 12 times earnings, which accompanied the size, it

[03:31] probably be fair that it would get that kind of multiple because it's so big,

[03:34] which means that you would make 1.2 billion, which would leave you post tax with

[03:39] around $1 billion.

[03:42] Now, what people don't talk about this as a total side note and as somebody who's

[03:45] sold multiple companies is that everyone has this big dream to sell a company

[03:49] and get the check, but they don't tell you that you then have a check and then you

[03:52] have to do something with the check.

[03:53] So now you have to translate that check back into equities, so you just sold

[03:57] equities and you get money and then you have to buy equities yet again.

[04:00] And so then you have to think to yourself, am I going to get a better return on

[04:03] this billion dollars than I do within the existing business or asset that I ended

[04:07] up selling?

[04:07] And I'm going to translate these zeros down to the $10 million goal that we're

[04:10] talking about in a second, but I just like to show it.

[04:12] It looks like it's scale so that this can just so you can see how the big,

[04:16] ultra rich stuff actually happens in the real world.

[04:19] Now, this is the V3 version.

[04:22] This is income, so that's the skill plus private equity.

[04:27] All right, so this was public equity.

[04:29] This is private equity.

[04:30] All right, so a little bit different.

[04:32] This business isn't available on the market.

[04:34] There's institutional buyers who raise funds and then they will give you a check for the

[04:37] business.

[04:38] That's V3 of this.

[04:40] Now, V4 of this is very sexy and has three different sub strategies.

[04:45] All right, and so in this instance, you have your business that makes $100 million per

[04:51] year.

[04:52] And so you choose one of three paths.

[04:55] Path 1s will go A, we'll go B, we'll go C.

[05:00] So at the top level, you can do something called an ESOP.

[05:04] ESOP is an employee stock ownership plan where you sell between 33 and 49%.

[05:11] Mind you, this is a minority stake in your business.

[05:14] And a bank will finance your employees backstopping that debt with the equity that you sell

[05:20] them.

[05:21] Employees get the equity here, bank is here and then there's you.

[05:24] And so the bank gives you money and lends it to the employees to pay you using the stock

[05:30] that you gave them as collateral.

[05:33] Now, what's interesting about this, at least in the United States, and I'm sure there's

[05:35] different functions like this internationally, is that this payment, at least in our tax

[05:39] laws, is tax-free.

[05:41] And so you get a smaller multiple because banks will always pay less because they have

[05:45] to think about risk and not upside than potentially a private equity buyer would.

[05:49] But this is tax-free to the owner, which is pretty sweet.

[05:52] Now one of the other nice things here is that you still maintain control of your business,

[05:56] because you still own majority.

[05:58] And so if you do it in this way, you can help your employees get wealthy, you get a tax-free

[06:02] check.

[06:03] They get to participate in the growth of the business.

[06:05] And oftentimes, e-Sops can go well because then now you have a huge team of people who

[06:09] are also incentivizing growing the business and quote act like owners.

[06:12] But they did need to come up with the money.

[06:13] It's like, here's your stock and then they go straight to the bank and then the bank

[06:17] gives them the loan to pay you for the stock you give them.

[06:20] It's kind of how it works.

[06:21] Okay?

[06:22] That's version A of this.

[06:24] Now the way this works though is that you just traded the equity and you get cash for

[06:28] what you gave the employees, but you still own the asset.

[06:32] And so the asset is still worth what it is in the private room.

[06:35] So as you add those two things together, you still have a billion dollars, but you get

[06:38] the liquidity and you keep the control.

[06:40] The version B of this is something called a dividend recap.

[06:47] So dividend recap is using the same bank structure that you'd have with an e-Sop except

[06:51] you just cut the employees out of it.

[06:53] You just go directly to the bank and say, hey, how much will you loan me using my entire

[06:57] business collateral?

[06:58] Now if you think, huh, that's weird.

[07:00] Think about it like buying a house.

[07:01] If you buy a house, you go to the bank, you put x percent down and they give you debt

[07:05] for the rest of it and then you pay that debt off.

[07:07] And so the business actually works the same way.

[07:09] So if you have no debt on the business or even if you do have debt on the business, you

[07:12] go and say, hey, we can reliably produce this much income.

[07:14] And so we could pay off this level of debt.

[07:17] And so then a bank would say, okay, we'll give you four times or five times your total

[07:21] e-bidda or your earnings for the year, roughly.

[07:24] And we'll give you that as debt.

[07:25] So if I make a hundred million dollars a year, they might give me a

[07:27] five hundred million dollar loan that they know that my business will be able to pay

[07:30] the interest off on, which for them makes sense because they're just getting paid to give

[07:34] money that they loaned out.

[07:37] And then you have terms associated with that debt.

[07:39] Right?

[07:40] Now, if your business is growing, that it makes a ton of sense.

[07:42] Did you do that?

[07:43] You do risk a little bit as an owner.

[07:44] And the key point here is that the business carries the debt, not you personally.

[07:49] And so you as a person, the owner of the business gets to take the $500 million

[07:53] dollars, but the business pays the debt off.

[07:55] And so let's say five years later, maybe the business pays all of the debt off, you

[07:58] got the $500 million dollars and you still own the business, just like owning a house

[08:02] at the end of paying it off, works the same way.

[08:05] Kind of cool.

[08:06] Now, the third version of this is one that people are a little bit more familiar with,

[08:11] which we kind of used earlier, which is public equities, meaning you go public with the

[08:16] company that you have.

[08:17] And so now, when you go public, you only have to sell a small percentage of shares in

[08:21] order to make them available to the public.

[08:23] And by doing that, the remainder of the stock that you have starts to have an actual market

[08:27] place value.

[08:28] And so the value of this and one of this is one of the biggest benefits of going public

[08:32] is that you don't have to sell 33 to 49% of your shares.

[08:36] You can sell 10% or 5% of your shares.

[08:39] And then the other 95% has a market value in real time.

[08:44] And so then you can still go to those same institutions, banks, et cetera, and say, hey,

[08:48] I want you to loan me and the thing is, is here you can do a piece meal.

[08:51] You don't have to go through a six month process or 12 month process to get one specific

[08:54] amount.

[08:55] You can say, hey, lend me a 5 million a day.

[08:59] Let me 20 million a maro.

[09:00] Let me, you know, a hundred million on this other day.

[09:03] And you can do that process in 24 hours because you have equities that are publicly available,

[09:08] which they can collateralize, meaning they can then take that if for whatever reason you

[09:12] don't sell.

[09:13] And so most of the times, banks will loan up to 50% of the value of the stock that you have.

[09:20] So if I have a billion dollars in stock, I can get a loan up to $5,500 million.

[09:26] And so this is exactly what Elon did when he went to go to buy X.

[09:31] He just took a loan out of his wallet and then just bought it and cash.

[09:34] Kind of cool.

[09:35] Right?

[09:36] And so the idea here is that these are three different ways that you can use.

[09:39] And you're like, okay, well, then what's the metastrategy for V4?

[09:42] V4 is you have an income producing thing plus you understand debt because all three

[09:48] of these strategies, use a bank or an institution to front the capital.

[09:52] And the main thing with all three of these is that you actually retain ownership and control.

[09:57] And so as my understanding of money and markets improve, I started to understand different

[10:00] ways that I could achieve my billion dollar goal.

[10:03] Now, if you're like, okay, Alex, that sounds great.

[10:05] But you said there was something about the ultra rich and avoiding taxes.

[10:08] Well, let's talk about the taxes unless translated to the $10 million goal.

[10:11] Okay, so here, this is tax free.

[10:14] Pretty nice.

[10:16] So that's the big thing.

[10:16] The dividend recap.

[10:18] Also, this isn't tax free because you have to take it as a payment, right?

[10:25] So that one you still have to pay taxes on.

[10:27] Here it's tax free because it's a loan against your public equities.

[10:32] Part of me feels like dividend recap might be tax free, not sure on this.

[10:34] But the public equities, absolutely the loans that you take against them are tax free.

[10:39] Because they're loans and you pay interest on them and then you have to pay loans back.

[10:42] And that's the big thing.

[10:44] Let's say a little bit of a misconception on this.

[10:45] It's like, oh, these rich people, they should be paying tax on unrealized gains.

[10:49] Well, until someone gets money for something, I think that it's like having someone

[10:53] pay income tax on a paycheck they haven't gotten yet.

[10:55] I feel like that's a little bit ridiculous.

[10:57] On the other hand, with the public equities, peace, you still have confidence that you

[11:04] have to be responsible for, to whoever gives you the money.

[11:08] And so it's not like you get the money and you can do it every one of it.

[11:11] You have to pay it back.

[11:12] That's how loans work.

[11:13] Now the only way that this works long term is that your business continues to grow.

[11:17] If the business goes down, then you're in deep shit.

[11:20] So you can lose it all.

[11:21] And so there's risk that's not being appropriately valued on people say, oh, these rich

[11:24] people just take loans off their stuff.

[11:26] But this is fundamentally how you can do it and get liquidity or cash from something that

[11:31] you own that's valuable.

[11:32] Okay.

[11:33] Now, if you're like, all right, Alex, that's fantastic.

[11:36] But I'm not trying to make a billion dollars right now.

[11:38] I'm trying to get to $10 million over the span of my life ideally as fast as possible

[11:44] in that worth.

[11:45] And the reason I use $10 million is that because at 5% you can make about 500,000 a year

[11:49] at least in the US, which would be about the top 1% in terms of earnings.

[11:54] Pretty sweet.

[11:55] Now as it's side note, this, you also pay less taxes on.

[11:59] So this is usually going to be something called qualified dividends.

[12:03] Meaning you only pay 20% on this rather than paying income tax.

[12:06] So you actually get more for your money when it's off of passive distributions.

[12:09] Okay.

[12:10] Cool.

[12:11] So if we're using these four strategies here, V1 of this is just the pure income method,

[12:17] which means that over the span of your life, you're going to need to make $15 million

[12:21] in income and then after your 67% tax rate, you'll be left with 10 million bucks.

[12:26] Okay.

[12:27] That's V1, not a lot of leverage, but you can do it that way.

[12:31] The V2 version of this is that you make your $1 million per year, per year.

[12:41] Oops.

[12:42] There we go.

[12:43] One million dollars per year.

[12:44] And you still pay your taxes on that.

[12:46] But you invest that post tax at 9%.

[12:52] And then after 10 years, you have $10 million.

[12:55] So a total interesting side note on this is that with 10 years then at 9% and given

[13:00] the tax rate that exists in the US, is that on a 10 year time horizon, you can measure

[13:05] how good someone is at investing their money.

[13:08] Based on what their value of their portfolio is 10 years later, relative to what their income

[13:12] would have been untouched.

[13:14] And so if I made a million dollars a year, in 10 years, I should have $10 million if I

[13:18] paid zero taxes.

[13:20] But since I pay 37% taxes or anybody who would make this would pay 37% taxes, then every

[13:25] year they're actually making $670,000.

[13:28] And so if you invested that $670 at 9%, then you'd make at the end of that period $10 million.

[13:33] So you'd actually be back where you started because you had to invest to make up the

[13:37] difference in taxes.

[13:39] And obviously the first year of that 10 is significantly more valuable because of compounding

[13:43] than the last year of that 10.

[13:44] I'm keeping this simple and not getting into living expenses and things like that, which

[13:49] obviously would complicate this.

[13:51] Okay.

[13:52] So that is income plus passive investing, income plus active investing.

[14:00] So V3 of this is that you make $1.2 million per year from an asset.

[14:07] Meaning you own a business that let's say it does $10 million in revenue and it does $1.2 million

[14:12] in distributions or owner earnings.

[14:14] All right.

[14:15] And let's say that you can sell this thing at 10x.

[14:18] All right.

[14:19] So less than the company over here.

[14:20] But the only way you'd be able to sell a company at this value, which you can at this

[14:23] size, reasonably, you know, if it's a business that truly is an asset.

[14:27] So right now there's HVAC companies that are selling at 10x1214x.

[14:31] There's dental offices.

[14:32] There's accounting firms.

[14:33] So these are real businesses that can be sold if you're in the right market.

[14:36] Again, I'm going to use simple illustrations here.

[14:39] So this would then give us $12 million that you would get pre-tax and then you pay your

[14:45] capital gains tax that you'd have to pay within the US, which would leave you with 10 million

[14:49] bucks.

[14:50] Again, same as before.

[14:52] Okay, I had this thing that was passively making me $1.2 million a year, $100,000 a month.

[14:58] Well, what am I going to buy with my $10 million that's going to replace this thing?

[15:02] Sometimes thinking the second step ahead can influence whether or not you want to sell this

[15:05] overall.

[15:06] But I do like to make the point.

[15:08] So this one is income plus our active or private equity.

[15:14] So we have public here.

[15:17] We have private here.

[15:19] And then V4 is going to look a little bit different because we have this $10 million

[15:22] goal.

[15:23] And so I want to tell you a different strategy that think is wildly underrated, which

[15:28] is you can go and become an employee at a company.

[15:33] We're partnered, depending on how you want to see this.

[15:35] Of a company that then goes public for a billion dollars that you own 1% of.

[15:42] And that you earned over five years.

[15:43] And what's cool about this particular path is that you get all the benefits of this path

[15:47] that we're here is that you can take loans against the stocks that you have that are

[15:51] worth 1% and you too can live like the ultra rich and take those loans tax free.

[15:55] Now you can't do an eSOT because you're not the owner of the business.

[15:59] But you can do, in my opinion, the most attractive of the three of these things, which

[16:02] is that you can have in real time access to liquidity or cash to buy the things that you

[16:06] need based on the value of the asset you have.

[16:09] And so let's say that you start working at business.

[16:12] They say we'll give you 0.2% per year times five years.

[16:15] And you do the five years.

[16:17] And over that time period, the company goes public for a billion dollars.

[16:21] That's a da.

[16:22] One billion.

[16:23] Well, you get the idea.

[16:24] Then you are stock is worth $10 million.

[16:27] But here's the nice part is that you paid probably a very, very, very,

[16:31] gracious tax amount to get this or these options associated with the shares.

[16:36] And then you have something that is worth $10 million that you can then take loans against.

[16:40] All right.

[16:41] So these are the four strategies from the ultra rich translated into

[16:45] normal income goals.

[16:46] Now, I want to zoom out for a second because I think this will be helpful for

[16:49] everyone.

[16:50] No matter which of these paths you choose or the versions of the past that you want,

[16:55] you'll notice some common themes.

[16:56] The first one is that you have to be valuable.

[16:59] Like you have to learn how to provide about it.

[17:01] The marketplace either as an employee or as a small business owner or as a larger

[17:05] business owner overall, but either way, you have to learn how to generate income.

[17:08] And the way you generate income is by solving problems for other people and learning

[17:11] skills.

[17:12] And so a lot of time, I see dedicated to content from people who don't talk about

[17:18] the most important thing, which is short, you can have all these passive investments

[17:22] strategies.

[17:23] But if you're working off of 35,000 dollars a year, it's never going to happen.

[17:27] Like we like to talk about the one lady who works in McDonald's for 50 years and

[17:31] saved every penny she ever had, so she can end up with a million dollars.

[17:34] But is that really the ideal strategy when maybe taking a weekend and getting a

[17:39] certification can bump you to 50 or 60,000 dollars a year?

[17:42] Or you just learn outbound sales, you bump yourself to 150,000 dollars a year.

[17:45] Five times the earning potential.

[17:47] And so I think that the investing stuff gets really sexy because it feels passive,

[17:51] but you live your whole life.

[17:52] And so you might as well get five times 10 times more for the time you are guaranteed

[17:56] to have to give.

[17:57] We all spend seconds every second we're alive and see might as well get more for them.

[18:02] The second one is what I want to talk about is the fallacy or the three fallacies

[18:05] of Warren Buffett.

[18:06] So Warren Buffett a lot of people like I just want to do a Warren Buffett.

[18:09] He just slowly invested, right?

[18:11] Well, let me walk you through with the fallacies of Warren Buffett R.

[18:16] So three fallacies of Warren Buffett.

[18:24] Number one, I'm going to be just like him.

[18:27] Well, did you buy your first docket age seven and did you do that weeks after

[18:35] Proharber?

[18:39] When there was literal blood in the streets,

[18:42] well, if you didn't buy your first docket age seven,

[18:45] literal weeks after Proharber, then maybe you don't already have the makeup of somebody

[18:49] who's going to be the greatest investor of all time.

[18:52] Something to consider.

[18:53] The second is, are you going to live through the greatest growth in American history?

[18:58] As you start, you're investing career, which is exactly what Warren Buffett was able to do.

[19:07] And the third one is one that I actually talk about that I don't hear talked about a lot,

[19:11] which is just luck.

[19:13] And so let me hear me out.

[19:14] I think Warren is brilliant.

[19:16] And I talk about him all the time.

[19:18] And I think there's a lot of things we can learn from it.

[19:20] But what I see when I look at the top,

[19:22] point one percent, whatever the top of the top of the top of the top is that you have all the skills

[19:28] all the traits, all the everything comma and luck.

[19:32] Because the only way, like if you were to think of the hypothetical, the number one person on earth in general

[19:37] would have all of the things plus luck.

[19:41] Because everyone's going, there is luck that goes around.

[19:44] And so the number one person's going to have everything that's required plus luck.

[19:47] There's plenty of investors that are brilliant investors that are worth $1 billion instead of $100 billion.

[19:52] They just didn't get the luck part, right?

[19:54] Or they've been only investing for 30 years instead of 70.

[19:57] Right? Or 75 or 85, or whatever, amount of years he's alive now.

[20:01] All right? And so I think these three things are things that are not considered when people are like,

[20:05] oh, I want to do the strategy.

[20:06] And I want to highlight this because the main theme of all of these is that you have to generate income.

[20:11] You have to make money.

[20:13] It's the only way you can even have the income.

[20:15] So like right now, I have a handful of investments that are doing exceptionally well.

[20:18] But the only reason that I would be able to make those investments is because I have excess capacity in terms of cash,

[20:23] capital, that I could deploy.

[20:26] If you don't, and this is where like living below your means to make more.

[20:29] So you have the Delta so you can kind of, you can get aggressive.

[20:32] It's so important.

[20:32] And I think it's really lost in the narrative today.

[20:34] And so the last thing I want to talk about is what rich parents give as the greatest gift to their kids.

[20:39] And so the number of predictor of success long term is the zip code your born in.

[20:44] All right?

[20:45] And I find that really interesting and also disparaging in some ways because it means that it controls for IQ,

[20:50] it controls for ethnicity, controls for gender.

[20:52] It's the zip code that you're born in.

[20:55] And I see that as mostly due to the associations of other people in that zip code.

[21:00] And so it's like, okay, that means that conditions can create our behavior or shape our behavior.

[21:03] So then what behavior changes happen in a rich environment versus a porn environment.

[21:07] And I think that it can really come down to one main thing,

[21:11] which is the leverage of the opportunity vehicles that you pursue.

[21:14] And so I remember this clear as day, I came from what I consider upper middle class.

[21:19] So my dad's a doctor.

[21:22] But when I went to Vanderbilt, I was exposed to an entirely different level of wealth that I didn't even really

[21:26] knew exist from Baltimore. There just wasn't any like New York money. Like it wasn't really a thing.

[21:30] Like if it was a concept that didn't understand.

[21:34] But for them, the opportunity vehicle that they wanted their kids to pursue had leverage, meaning they got more

[21:44] for what they put in. And so a middle class parent might say, hey, you're a salesman.

[21:50] Awesome. And you sell cars. Okay? Well, you sell cars and cars cost whatever.

[21:57] And the top top top car's middle salesman might make, you know, 300 to 400,000 year.

[22:03] Okay. Now some people were like, there's this one guy. Cool. Well, good for him. But for us,

[22:07] like, let's call it top one percent or making 300, 400,000 dollars a year.

[22:11] Now the upper class salesman or the upper class or the ultra rich, whatever you want to call it,

[22:16] ultra salesman sells companies. And guess what he makes? 4% on the deal. And so if he sells

[22:25] a 200 million dollar company, he makes 8 million bucks for one sale. And so same fundamental skills,

[22:33] obviously the little bit more now, it's just here, but fundamentally you're selling stuff.

[22:37] And all somebody who is wealthier does is tries to get more for what they put in.

[22:42] They try and add zeros to the price tag of the things they sell. If you sell a 500 million

[22:47] dollar building, you get a commission for that just like you get for selling a 50,000 dollar house.

[22:52] Same concept, you just add scale to it. And every one of these people has the same member of

[22:57] ours per day, which just means they get more for their time. And so thinking through this, what poor

[23:04] people or middle class people miss that rich people or rich kids, rich parents, past to their

[23:09] kids, is which opportunities to say no to. They don't even consider the equal lower class

[23:17] or middle class opportunity. And I think of this on something that I like to refer to as measuring

[23:22] sticks. And so I'll give you a little story to illustrate the point. So when I was a kid

[23:28] in high school, I worked, I started my first album on 15 and nine months, which is like the

[23:32] legal age that I could start working. I started working as a blender tender, it's music. And as I

[23:38] I leveled up and became a lead and then I think a manager at some point. And then eventually I

[23:43] shifted to catering, which I got 25 bucks an hour for, which was awesome back in my day. Anyways,

[23:48] I was hood rich. And the thing is, is that I measured how much money I had and how many Chipotle

[23:54] breeders I could buy. Because I knew that Chipotle breeders were about seven bucks. And so I was like

[23:59] man, I just got 200 bucks for the shift. That's like 28 breeders that I can buy now, which is

[24:04] awesome. Right? I was super excited about it. And so what happens is the measuring stick that you use

[24:09] to measure stuff, the wealthiest people in the world just have a larger stick in two ways. One is

[24:16] they measure over longer time horizons and they also use like they literally call by the way in

[24:21] Wall Street a stick is $1 million. So that's the slang among rich people. Like if you're like

[24:28] oh I didn't know that there was slang for $1 million. There is slang for $1 million when you have

[24:31] lots of millions of dollars. You're saying give them two sticks. It means two million bucks. And so when

[24:37] you hang around people who talk in increments of $1 million, imagine the opportunities that they're

[24:42] pursuing and more importantly for everybody who's listening to this, the many things they see

[24:47] and so this is where you lose years and decades of life is that you say yes to opportunities to

[24:52] the other why shouldn't. And so they're able to be patient or more selective because they know that

[24:56] they're going to get, they want to maximize how many dollars they get out for the effort and time they

[25:01] put in. And unless something is going to ladder up to, remember thinking longer time horizons,

[25:05] something where they can get sticks for their time, then they're not going to do it. They're

[25:11] willing to take a job for $50 or $60,000 or $80,000 a year as an analyst at

[25:16] you know, PWC, Ortson Young, Ormikinsey, or an investment begleagolment sex. They're willing to eat

[25:21] dog shit for that period of time because they know that that's not the plan. This is just the period

[25:27] that they're learning and gaining experience so that they can do the next thing. They see it in

[25:31] stepping stones and the vast majority of my opinion of people who stay stuck don't have a plan. They

[25:37] don't see where things ladder up to and they don't reverse their going to the present. And so no matter

[25:42] what, whichever of these paths you use, one, you have to focus on income generation in learning skills,

[25:48] two, you want to make sure that you actually say no to the things that don't matter and be very

[25:53] selective about the things that will give you the highest return, three, surround yourself with people

[25:57] who have bigger measuring sticks in terms of time and money the new because whatever opportunities

[26:03] they're discussing will likely be higher, leverage the opportunities that you're considering. And then

[26:07] finally, in with we're going to the fallacy of Warren Buffett, if you want to make

[26:14] obscene amounts of money, you will not make it the way that someone else has already made it. It will

[26:19] be made in a new way, which means the single greatest and most valuable skill that a human being can

[26:25] have is the ability to come to their own conclusion and have the confidence to act on it despite

[26:30] it being contrary to what other people are doing because if it's what everyone else is doing,

[26:35] then it's not an opportunity because the funny thing about opportunity is they look like risk

[26:40] while their opportunities and the moment they're no longer risky is when the opportunity has closed

[26:45] and that's how life works. You have to make bets and you want to make the bets that you feel

[26:49] like you have information in Ben and Jumber other people so that you can come to your own

[26:52] conclusion rather than listen to other people. Have an amazing day, hope you enjoyed this stuff,

[00:00] Business is making less than $10 million per year,

[00:03] cannot afford to make this mistake.

[00:05] And it's a problem that limited me,

[00:06] in my building to sell my company.

[00:08] But when I fixed it, I was able to sell it for $46.2 million.

[00:11] And there are four steps to solving this problem

[00:14] to avoid this calamity and lots of blood and death.

[00:17] And it all starts with number one, key man risk,

[00:20] a single person that is vital to the operations of the business.

[00:24] And if they were gone, the business would decrease

[00:28] materially in the amount of money that it makes or

[00:31] disappear altogether.

[00:32] And so think about it like this.

[00:34] You've got these functions that occur in the business

[00:36] on a regular basis.

[00:37] And there may be multiple people that can do these functions.

[00:41] And so the opposite of key man risk is redundancy.

[00:43] Meaning if one of these people disappear,

[00:46] we still have a flow for, let's say, dollars to go across the

[00:50] spreadsheet.

[00:50] You can still keep kind of make its way through.

[00:53] But all of a sudden, if you've got one here,

[00:55] and it doesn't matter how many different redundancies

[00:57] you have in the rest of the system, if this goes away,

[01:01] there's no way else for the dollars or the customers

[01:04] to move across and hopefully into your pocket.

[01:07] That's my little pocket for you.

[01:08] Why this matters is that if you have key man risk,

[01:11] you don't have an asset, you have a high paying job.

[01:14] And I don't say that to insult you.

[01:16] I say that so that you can be aware of it

[01:18] so that you can actually fix it.

[01:20] And to be clear, if you are fine, just working

[01:24] and not necessarily owning an asset, that's great.

[01:26] There's nothing wrong with trading time for money.

[01:29] Big fan.

[01:29] And so I'll give you an example.

[01:30] When I had Jim Lynch, I was kind of the innovator

[01:33] of the product and the service.

[01:35] And so I came up with the solutions for the gyms.

[01:39] And so for an acquireer or a private equity firm,

[01:42] who wants to buy this business, or whoever else

[01:45] you might want to sell a business to, having one person,

[01:47] especially if the person who's going to leave,

[01:50] when the business is sold, is a huge massive red flag

[01:54] for them because they're like, wait,

[01:56] we're buying this production, but it's with this key cog

[01:59] in the machine.

[01:59] And you want to have us buy this thing and remove the cog.

[02:03] Now, in a situation where you raise money, for example,

[02:06] it's not as much of an issue

[02:07] because those pieces, those cogs, are still in the machine.

[02:11] If you wanted to sell a company and you own the company

[02:15] and you leave and all the people who are still key men

[02:17] remain within the business, then what they're going to do

[02:20] is trying to incentivize those people to stay,

[02:21] but it still makes the company sellable.

[02:23] So this just counts double if it's the owner,

[02:26] or somebody who's going to leave as a result of a transaction,

[02:30] is the key man risking any of the functions of the business.

[02:33] So I was key man in the delivery.

[02:35] And so I did a couple things to solve the problem.

[02:39] So number one is that I created a department

[02:43] called the R&D department.

[02:45] And so the way it worked was simple.

[02:46] I thought about the process that I would go through

[02:48] when I wanted to innovate the product.

[02:50] So I'd say, okay, what can we do for our gym owners

[02:52] that will help them generate more leads, make more sales,

[02:56] whatever the issue was?

[02:57] And so the first thing that I did was that I would say,

[03:00] okay, I have a way of identifying problems.

[03:03] And so I would ask the customers,

[03:05] and the nice thing is if you listen to your customers,

[03:07] they will shout at you and they will tell you exactly

[03:08] what their problems are.

[03:09] And so I'd say, okay, number one is that I had these problems.

[03:12] No, I have to solve those problems.

[03:13] And so I'd have them rank the problems.

[03:15] They say, okay, this month, lead generation

[03:17] is the biggest issue.

[03:18] They want more leads.

[03:19] And I'd say, all right, now the next thing that I would do

[03:22] is I would deploy resources.

[03:23] So this would be time and money

[03:27] that ideally my customers couldn't deploy,

[03:29] but I could fractionize that cost

[03:32] between all of my customers to create a much bigger

[03:34] individual investment that any one of them could afford.

[03:37] And so let's say they pay three or four thousand dollars a month.

[03:41] I would spend $50,000 a month on this test.

[03:46] And so I'd say, okay, go hire a bunch of models,

[03:50] go out to a really good gym, film some great ads,

[03:53] then test those ads, so number three,

[03:56] I would test the ads in representative markets.

[04:00] So I'd have 20 markets or so,

[04:01] though represent demographic.

[04:03] So black, white, Asian, Hispanic, poor markets,

[04:06] rich markets, large markets, small markets,

[04:08] with good operators, with poor operators,

[04:10] with mediocre operators.

[04:11] That way I had a true sampling,

[04:13] rather than just saying, I'm just going to send this

[04:14] to my favorite customers because that's not going to work.

[04:16] And so we test it.

[04:17] And then what I would do is hand off winners.

[04:22] And so what that meant was I would say,

[04:24] okay, these ads of the 30 that we ran

[04:27] and we spent $50,000 on this whole thing,

[04:30] these two or three were the ones

[04:31] that generated the highest returns.

[04:33] And then I would give all of those to the gyms

[04:35] in our distribution base so that they could run those ads.

[04:38] They just wanted the inputs to feed the system

[04:41] and those inputs were required on a regular basis.

[04:43] In order for me to hand this off to someone,

[04:45] I said, this is fundamentally the way I do it.

[04:46] I look at the problems that they have

[04:48] in this instance, it was lead generation.

[04:49] I would dedicate time and money to solving this problem

[04:52] in a way that they couldn't do it,

[04:53] so that I could create a better solution

[04:55] that they could do it on their own.

[04:56] I would test to validate that the solution

[04:58] that I had was superior and then we rolled out.

[05:01] And I followed this process for my R&D

[05:04] so that I could replicate the person with a system.

[05:08] And so typically, key man risk will occur in three primary areas.

[05:14] So number one is that it can occur in marketing.

[05:18] So how do we get leads in the door?

[05:21] The second big place that it can occur is sales

[05:24] or conversion.

[05:25] How do we get prospects to hand us money

[05:28] for our goods and services?

[05:29] And then third is the actual goods and services themselves,

[05:33] which you can consider product, et cetera.

[05:35] This happens at any level.

[05:36] So if you're a service and you're just

[05:37] happened to be the best plumber or the best electrician

[05:39] or you're the best coder or the best advertised.

[05:42] Now, with marketing, for example,

[05:43] if you're in a marketing agency,

[05:45] you probably are key men on marketing for yourself

[05:47] and marketing for your customers.

[05:49] Like you can happen in multiple places,

[05:51] even if it's one person.

[05:51] And in the more places, one person is key man,

[05:55] the risk you're the businesses overall.

[05:57] Now I want to be clear.

[05:58] Key man risk is a double edged sword

[06:00] because the more valuable you become,

[06:03] more of a key man you are.

[06:05] And so the idea is that as soon as you learn

[06:08] a variable skill, the most valuable thing

[06:10] that you can do next is learn how to transfer

[06:12] that skill to another person.

[06:14] And I think this is a skill that I've spent

[06:15] a tremendous amount of time trying to hone

[06:18] so that I can build companies.

[06:20] And I think about it like this,

[06:21] assemble companies, assemble people.

[06:24] And then transfer the skills around whatever area

[06:27] has some sort of bottleneck where there's

[06:28] two few people who know how to do the thing.

[06:30] And this is so important because whether you want

[06:33] to sell a business or not, making a business

[06:36] that is sell a bull makes it better for anyone.

[06:39] Here's the best analogy I have.

[06:40] Say that you bought a house.

[06:42] And if you never bought a house before, then this may be news.

[06:44] But when you buy a house, what happens is that after a certain

[06:46] amount of time in the average Americans

[06:48] like three to five years, they change where they live.

[06:50] All right, so you buy a house.

[06:52] Now over time, you got some wear and tear on the house.

[06:54] And the house kind of degrades in your mind.

[06:56] Like you get a little crack on the front porch,

[06:58] this door kind of squeaks a little bit.

[07:01] And when you go to sell, what do you do?

[07:03] Well, you fix the little path in front of the house.

[07:07] You put some oil on the little hinges here.

[07:09] You're like, you know what, maybe I'll put a little patty

[07:11] you out back.

[07:11] I feel like that would increase our home value.

[07:14] And then all of a sudden, and this is the crazy thing.

[07:16] Right when you're about to sell the house

[07:18] and you fix to all the things that are wrong with it,

[07:20] you're like, you know, this is how it's so bad.

[07:23] And so the same exact thing happens with the business.

[07:26] If all of a sudden you remove yourself as keyman

[07:29] in marketing and sales and product, all of a sudden,

[07:32] you're like, huh, this business almost runs with that.

[07:37] This ain't so bad.

[07:38] Now the last area that you can have

[07:40] keyman risks that can occur.

[07:41] And this is kind of like the glue between all of these

[07:45] is operations.

[07:48] So if you have a key leader, for example,

[07:51] who has tremendous influence over the entire team,

[07:55] then the operations connects the people

[07:57] to their functions.

[07:58] And so think of that as kind of the glue

[08:00] that runs your organization.

[08:01] Like if Layla were to leave,

[08:03] she would leave a huge vacuum at acquisition.com.

[08:06] Now she's not specifically over marketing, sales or product.

[08:10] She just has all of these leaders that are rolling into her.

[08:13] And so if the leadership was gone,

[08:15] that in and of itself would also be somebody who's keyman.

[08:19] And to be clear, keyman is key human.

[08:22] So it doesn't have to be a founder.

[08:24] It can be an employee who can be keyman.

[08:26] And if you do have someone who's keyman in your business

[08:28] and it's your business and not theirs,

[08:31] then it would be who view if they're truly keyman

[08:34] to incentivize them in some material way to stay.

[08:37] So if you're thinking yourself,

[08:38] okay, this is me.

[08:39] I'm definitely keyman or there's somebody

[08:41] my business who's keyman or marketing sales,

[08:43] operations, product, then there are two major ways

[08:47] that you can solve this.

[08:49] So the first is through process and people.

[08:52] Just like I walked through earlier, where I said,

[08:54] okay, what are the actual steps that I do

[08:56] in order to solve this market?

[08:58] What are the actual steps that I use

[08:59] to think through creating new products?

[09:01] What are the actual steps that I use

[09:03] to think through creating sales process,

[09:05] driving sales results, et cetera?

[09:07] So it's process and the people who will then do

[09:10] those processes within the business.

[09:12] The second way and this really only applies

[09:14] if it's not you who is the person who's keyman

[09:19] is incentives.

[09:20] And so if it's you, you only have option one.

[09:25] If it's somebody else, other people,

[09:27] you have option one and option two to solve the problem.

[09:31] And so for example, if I said,

[09:33] hey, I will incentivize you to stay in this business

[09:36] by giving you some vesting of shares over a three or five

[09:40] of your period, then that would make it less likely

[09:43] that the person's going to leave and disrupt the business.

[09:45] I think through it in both of these.

[09:47] Now, which of these is the most valuable,

[09:49] like most valuable to the business to do?

[09:51] Well, the most valuable to do is this one.

[09:54] But the higher up the skill set is,

[09:56] the more unique the individual,

[09:58] like think about Elon Musk.

[09:59] He's keyman in almost all of his businesses.

[10:01] But the reason that it's okay

[10:03] is that he has no desire to sell them.

[10:06] And so people bet on Elon and the companies,

[10:09] they bet on Jeff Bezos and the businesses

[10:12] because they are inseparable entities.

[10:14] Like they go one together and no one's leaving.

[10:18] They go public and all of their shares are still there

[10:21] and they're still incentivized to continue to grow it.

[10:24] Now, if you're watching this in one,

[10:25] or you're, well, okay, process and people,

[10:27] what does that actually mean?

[10:28] So inside of $100 million leads, I break this down.

[10:31] So in the employee section,

[10:32] which is a chapter in the book in terms of how to help,

[10:34] how to get people to get you more customers.

[10:37] You have the functions that an employee would do.

[10:39] And so there's two aspects.

[10:40] One is like, how do I get these people?

[10:42] And so you can use one-mount reach to asker network.

[10:45] You can do cold outreach, which is basically recruiting.

[10:48] You can post content, which is basically posting job openings

[10:51] that you have available.

[10:52] Doing paid ads, so promoting job postings

[10:54] on like a Craigslist or an indeed,

[10:56] or a monster or a ladder.

[10:57] Getting employee referrals, right?

[10:59] So rather than customer referrals,

[11:00] you're getting employee referrals.

[11:01] Affiliates would be like associations, guilds,

[11:04] listsers that already have a huge amount of people

[11:07] who want this specific type of roller job.

[11:09] Agency, so I think like staffing firms.

[11:11] And then obviously employees themselves

[11:13] could be the solution.

[11:15] Now, how do you get them to actually do this?

[11:17] And so the step one is that you document,

[11:19] which is basically saying, hey,

[11:20] here's our checklist of things that must occur

[11:23] in order for this process to be deemed complete

[11:25] or sufficient.

[11:27] The second D here is demonstrate, which is that you do it

[11:30] in front of them.

[11:31] So you do it on your own and correctly checklist.

[11:33] Then you do that checklist in front of them.

[11:36] And you only stick with that checklist

[11:37] because if you do anything off the checklist

[11:39] then you have to add to it.

[11:41] And then finally, they do it in front of you.

[11:44] So they duplicate it.

[11:45] So you document checklist, you demonstrate it in front of them

[11:49] then they demonstrated in front of you,

[11:50] which is basically duplication.

[11:52] And so that three step process is fundamentally how you can teach

[11:55] anyone to do anything.

[11:57] And in order to make a process more teachable,

[12:01] you simply have to break it down to more and more steps

[12:04] based on the skill of the person you're teaching it to.

[12:06] If I wanted to teach an advanced marketer,

[12:09] how to do email marketing, for example,

[12:12] I wouldn't say, hey, turn on your computer.

[12:15] Step two, pull up internet explorer.

[12:18] Step three, sign up for a Gmail account.

[12:19] I wouldn't have to go through all those steps

[12:21] because there's an assumed level of proficiency.

[12:23] This is why when you go to college or whatever

[12:25] education system you went through,

[12:26] there are prerequisites for moving on to the next level.

[12:29] So that they don't have to teach you with arithmetic

[12:31] and then teach you calculus later.

[12:33] They just assume you know it.

[12:34] And so your checklist that you create is going to depend

[12:38] on the level of the person that you're teaching the skill too.

[12:40] And the lower the level, the more checks

[12:43] you're going to be on the list, the more you need to address it.

[12:45] And so let's say you brought on somebody for sales, right?

[12:48] Who's going to be a director of sales.

[12:49] This might be a higher level of world.

[12:51] You would still follow the same thing as, hey,

[12:52] these are the activities that I spend my time on.

[12:54] This is what I actually do.

[12:56] Then they're going to watch you do it.

[12:59] You probably are running teams.

[13:00] You're probably doing one on one.

[13:02] You're probably looking at data to look for key

[13:04] out points so that you can address them

[13:07] and solve them within the team.

[13:08] And then they are going to take over those responsibilities,

[13:12] do them in front of you.

[13:13] And then when they have done them to the satisfactory level,

[13:16] you can then delegate it.

[13:17] And so the easy let me test for good delegation

[13:20] is that after you've given the responsibility away

[13:23] and someone else is actually doing the actions,

[13:26] then the performance of the department or function

[13:29] either remains neutral or goes up.

[13:31] That is when you have successfully delegated.

[13:33] It's not that you give something to someone

[13:35] that makes it delegation.

[13:36] You can give something to someone in completely abdicate

[13:39] or basically get rid of responsibility

[13:41] but with no feedback loop to determine whether or not

[13:44] you did a good job or that they're doing a good job.

[13:46] And so it has to be the performance of the function

[13:49] after you've headed off that determines whether

[13:51] or not you have successfully delegated.

[13:53] And sometimes you have to repeat the cycle multiple times

[13:56] with the same person and that's okay

[13:57] because you need to learn to on how to teach better.

[14:00] And quick pro tip, if you're a smaller business

[14:02] and let's say that you do some sort of service

[14:05] and it's just you or just you and a couple people,

[14:07] there are three options that you can do

[14:10] when you have too much demand and very fixed amount of supply.

[14:13] Like you can't, you're completely maxed out.

[14:16] You can't take on any more customers

[14:17] you barely can't.

[14:18] So option one is that you can simply raise

[14:21] your prices and if you do that,

[14:23] you'll absolutely make more money.

[14:25] So you'll get paid more for the same thing,

[14:27] which is my favorite way of getting paid.

[14:29] Now the second thing that you can do

[14:30] is you can increase the service ratio.

[14:32] And so that means instead of doing one on one, for example,

[14:35] I would do one on five or one on ten.

[14:38] Now alternatively, you can't think of it with a team

[14:41] the same way which is let's say I have four people

[14:44] who work in my agency and they do different functions

[14:46] to serve one type of customer

[14:47] then if I can change it from those four people together

[14:50] can handle 20 clients, I can have those four people

[14:52] together handling 40 clients.

[14:54] And so the ratio still shifts towards us

[14:57] so you get more efficient, which is either process

[14:59] or some sort of technology or training

[15:01] that allows you to get more from your existing talent.

[15:04] The third and the most valuable one is that you do this.

[15:10] Processing people, is that you actually get somebody else

[15:13] to do the work for you, which typically means

[15:14] you have to organize this stuff, make sure they did it

[15:17] successfully and you can hand it off.

[15:19] Now these two things both make you more money.

[15:22] This one helps you eliminate the actual problem

[15:24] of key men risk.

[15:25] And if I had to do this in sequence,

[15:27] meaning in what order would I do this?

[15:29] First is I would raise prices

[15:31] because that requires the least amount of work

[15:33] and can immediately make money if I'm supply constraint.

[15:36] Second, I would say, okay, well, people are saying

[15:38] that these higher prices, well, I don't want to raise prices

[15:41] again, which you obviously still can.

[15:43] I can shift my service ratio at this current price

[15:46] to fundamentally dilute down the service that I have

[15:49] because it's so good.

[15:50] And as long as my value still exceeds my price

[15:52] without raising the price with this second implementation,

[15:55] I would still have people who want to give me money.

[15:57] Now, if I've done as much of these two things as I can,

[16:00] I can then say, you know what?

[16:02] I want to not have to do any of these things at all.

[16:04] I want someone else to do them.

[16:06] And then that transforms this particular job that you have

[16:09] because as an entrepreneur, you'll have more than one job.

[16:11] It takes this job, takes the hat off your head

[16:13] and puts it on someone else's.

[16:15] And then that shifts you towards owning an asset

[16:18] rather than owning a job.

[16:19] And to be clear, I'm all for maximizing the amount

[16:21] of money that you're making.

[16:22] And some businesses lend themselves more to kind of the people

[16:26] and process stuff than others do.

[16:28] Taylor Swift, for example, is going to have a hard time being like,

[16:31] hey, this is my blonde double.

[16:33] And she's going to sing for you guys today

[16:35] because look, I've delegated the responsibility.

[16:39] Now, it's very unlikely that that would happen.

[16:41] And so there are situations where you just have unicorns

[16:44] in a business.

[16:45] And so that's where you just have to align

[16:47] incentives like crazy and try and take it all the way.

[16:51] Which is either you're just getting a paid

[16:52] amount of money, which Taylor Swift does.

[16:54] Or you create liquidity, meaning you get paid

[16:59] for the equity shares that you have,

[17:00] via a different vehicle than selling.

[17:03] So when you go public, you sell a little bit of the company.

[17:06] But the vast majority of the wealth

[17:07] that most of those founders have is that they have shares

[17:10] that they can take loans against.

[17:11] Bigger of business gets if you don't have any desire

[17:13] to sell, you can take debt or other instruments

[17:16] where people will lend you and you can collateralize

[17:18] or back it up with the stock that you have in the business.

[17:21] And so if you don't pay them back,

[17:22] they get to own shares in the company.

[17:23] If you are key man in your business

[17:25] or someone else in your business is key man,

[17:27] how many spread the word with this?

[17:28] Because these mistakes cost me so dearly

[17:30] that I hope that it prevents everyone else

[17:31] from making them that way we can all ride

[17:33] into the sunset into our amazing businesses

[17:35] that are risk free and making all the money

[17:37] in the entire world.

[17:38] So if you could hit the share button and send it to you

[17:41] friends and family and even enemies

[17:42] for, you know, I mean like, hey, they need help to

[17:44] or friend of me's, maybe a little bit safer.

[17:46] Then it would mean the world.

[17:47] Otherwise enjoy the rest of it.

[17:48] So now that we come to a key man risk,

[17:50] the next mistake that business owners

[17:52] under $10 million make is single channel risk.

[17:56] Now that's just a fancy word,

[17:57] so let me tell you what it means.

[17:58] If more than half of your customers

[17:59] or leads come from one place you have single channel risk

[18:02] and the concept behind this is that

[18:04] if that were to stop, it would materially affect your business

[18:08] on a long time horizon.

[18:10] So quick illustration.

[18:11] One of our portfolio companies,

[18:12] which is the teeth wedding chain,

[18:13] got a lot of business from outbound.

[18:16] Almost all customers were coming from that specific source.

[18:20] All of a sudden, the rules on that platform changed

[18:23] based on the way that we could message.

[18:25] Almost overnight, we had 50 to 70% fewer sales

[18:29] coming in from that primary channel.

[18:31] That is single channel risk.

[18:33] Can you imagine as a business owner overnight?

[18:35] You're like, oh my god, this real change.

[18:37] If you're ads dependent, let's say,

[18:38] the way that you get customers is on meta ads.

[18:40] And then you lose your account, boom,

[18:42] all of a sudden your business almost goes to zero.

[18:44] Or if you have an organic content following

[18:47] and you're only on one platform, for example,

[18:49] and that platform bans you or restricts you

[18:52] or shadow bans, whatever.

[18:53] And then boom, all of your lead flow disappears.

[18:56] Or you have, let's say a domain or a server

[18:58] that you send your emails from.

[18:59] When you do outbound and all of a sudden,

[19:01] that gets whacked with some sort of,

[19:03] you go into the promotions tab on email.

[19:06] All of a sudden, all your response rates

[19:07] from your domain go to almost nothing.

[19:10] In each of those scenarios, you have single channel risk.

[19:13] Now thankfully for this particular business,

[19:16] I had spent the last six months or more

[19:18] building out a recurring revenue stream.

[19:20] And I detailed that in different video

[19:22] where we went from like 5% of revenue being,

[19:24] recurring revenue to over 60% of revenue being recurring revenue.

[19:28] Even though we decreased the amount of new sales

[19:31] coming in by over half, it didn't actually change

[19:34] overall revenue because we had so much compounding

[19:36] that had started to become unlocked,

[19:38] which is why there are multiple ways

[19:40] to stabilize a business.

[19:41] But for the purpose of this video,

[19:43] if you have only one way to get customers,

[19:46] then you have one way to lose them.

[19:47] So if you have Facebook ads that are running in this boat,

[19:52] and this is how you get your little fishies,

[19:54] there's our little fishy from Facebook.

[19:56] And then this thing breaks all of a sudden,

[19:59] you've got no fish, and then you would be very sad,

[20:02] and then you would jump overboard and die.

[20:04] Very sad for you and your family,

[20:06] and you know, peace and blessings be upon you.

[20:08] Now, let's say that you're this other guy,

[20:10] and you said, you know what, I have seen this happen before,

[20:13] because I've had a count shut down from organic,

[20:15] from paid or domains that don't work out anymore

[20:18] for cold outbound.

[20:20] But you know what, I've made YouTube organic.

[20:23] I've got ads, I've got email outbound.

[20:26] Let's say we also have Instagram content organic.

[20:29] Okay, so let's say that our same issue happens

[20:33] with Facebook.

[20:33] Boom.

[20:34] This guy loses the fish here.

[20:36] Now this fish is very happy,

[20:37] because he's not gonna die and get eaten.

[20:39] But we still have all these other fish

[20:43] that are coming in from the other channels.

[20:45] And so this guy is still like, you know what?

[20:48] I still do have a little bit of a tummy here

[20:50] from all the fish that I'm eating.

[20:51] Maybe it's good for me to tighten the belt a little bit,

[20:54] and then I can go home and feed my family,

[20:56] and they've been a little chunky as well lately.

[20:59] And so you know what, and farm fishing is bad,

[21:02] and let's talk about all sorts of political things.

[21:04] Anyways, back to it.

[21:06] You could see the problem here, Cliriz Day.

[21:08] If you have one source of getting customers,

[21:10] you've also only got one that needs to break in order to fail.

[21:13] And to show how these lessons stack together,

[21:15] if we only had one keyman, and then this guy dies,

[21:18] very sad right, he's a little double axis here.

[21:20] All right, the dead.

[21:22] All right, because he had no fish.

[21:23] If we had a second fisherman who was on the deck,

[21:26] he might say, you know what?

[21:27] I'm gonna throw another line out,

[21:29] and maybe I'm gonna catch some of these YouTube fishies

[21:31] over here, and at least you'd have a shot.

[21:34] But if you have single channel risk and keyman risk,

[21:37] your double fucked.

[21:38] If you wanted to buy this fisherman business,

[21:40] would you?

[21:41] Well, it's like, well, shoot.

[21:42] There's so many ways for this thing to fail.

[21:44] Versus this one, this guy's got a crew of people

[21:47] that are all manning each of the poles,

[21:50] and so even if they, that looks bad.

[21:54] But if any of these guys went down,

[21:57] so this guy jumps over board, right?

[21:59] Then these guys are so like, yeah,

[22:00] I'm gonna get a pay raise,

[22:01] hey can we get his pay off?

[22:03] There's greedy bastards, but this is fundamentally

[22:06] a fishing boat that I would have a much larger likelihood

[22:10] of buying because it has a larger likelihood

[22:13] of producing fish consistently.

[22:15] So first off, who needs to worry about this?

[22:17] Well, it's more important.

[22:19] The bigger your business gets,

[22:20] the more important this is,

[22:21] and let me explain tactically how this works,

[22:24] because let's say even volatility

[22:26] from a single channel is something that could rock

[22:28] the boat figuratively.

[22:29] If you have a small business,

[22:31] then let's say the channel goes down by 20%,

[22:34] then let's say you've got one sales guy

[22:35] and his calendar goes from 100% filled to 80% filled.

[22:38] Not a huge deal.

[22:40] If you have 100 sales guys,

[22:42] and their calendars go from 100%, right?

[22:46] To all of a sudden, 20 of the guys have completely empty calendars,

[22:49] that level of volatility that can occur

[22:52] when you only have one channel,

[22:54] makes it much more difficult to do business

[22:56] on a regular basis.

[22:57] There's a variety of solutions that I will walk you through.

[23:00] So number one is that if you're a tiny business,

[23:02] you don't need to worry about this yet.

[23:04] But my biggest advocate for being a small business

[23:09] is that you're gonna have one primary method

[23:11] for getting cold people,

[23:12] which is usually gonna be outbound.

[23:14] Number one, which is your reaching out to prospects

[23:16] who don't know who you are.

[23:18] Two is gonna be affiliates.

[23:20] So again, you've got third parties that are sending you traffic.

[23:24] Three, you've got ads that are ways that people

[23:27] are coming into the business, and you've got organic.

[23:30] So this is gonna be likely how you're going to be getting customers.

[23:33] Now, I would recommend that you do one of these three

[23:36] and then plus this.

[23:38] Now, this may seem like a little bit of a departure from

[23:41] some of the things that I've talked before,

[23:42] worth one channel, one avatar, one product,

[23:44] up to a million dollars a year.

[23:45] And that's true.

[23:46] It's just that I've seen like so many people be able to manage this.

[23:50] It's such high return for such low effort

[23:53] that the organic that you put here

[23:55] is not really to acquire customers.

[23:57] It actually functions more to amplify

[24:00] what you're doing with these other channels.

[24:02] And so if you are doing outbound

[24:04] and then people Google you,

[24:06] and then they can find a little bit of content,

[24:07] then it's like, oh, this guy has a pulse,

[24:09] so this is a real business.

[24:10] So as an affiliate or affiliates

[24:12] are sending you customers or you're trying to sell affiliates,

[24:14] then just knowing that if some sort of presence increases

[24:17] the likelihood they do business with you.

[24:18] And same thing with ads.

[24:19] And so if you're a small business,

[24:20] this is gonna be one of the big ones that you're probably

[24:22] gonna use, but the organic is just something that you can do

[24:25] even one post a week.

[24:26] It doesn't have to be a ton.

[24:27] Just to look like you have a pulse.

[24:29] Now, if you're a bigger business,

[24:32] then this becomes a much bigger deal for you.

[24:34] The way that we solve this is a standardized process

[24:37] that I've now had to jump through with a lot of companies.

[24:39] So the first thing we do is we shore up long-term nurture.

[24:43] So long-term nurture means a combination of making more content

[24:48] and email specifically follow up.

[24:51] Because a lot of people, a lot of businesses,

[24:53] don't do a good job following up the leads.

[24:55] And so they have this list of 10,000 or 20,000 or 1,000 people

[24:59] that have done business with them over a long period.

[25:01] It's not where at least given them their information.

[25:02] If we create a cadence or some sort of schedule

[25:05] around reaching out to those people, providing value

[25:07] and then occasionally presenting offers,

[25:09] we're going to have another stream of customers

[25:12] that's coming in.

[25:13] So think of this as in a way, another customer stream,

[25:17] but it's an incredibly low risk customer stream

[25:19] that is the most profitable of all streams.

[25:22] And so email marketing, for example,

[25:24] has depending on the source, a 42 to 1 to 36 to 1,

[25:27] return on dollars.

[25:29] It's like, oh my God, why would we not do that?

[25:31] So we do this to decrease our risk, increase our cash flow

[25:34] in the short term to get that engine going.

[25:37] The next engine that I like to make sure is very strong

[25:39] is my referral engine.

[25:41] And so if I haven't put a strong referral system in place

[25:44] to get customers to send me more customers,

[25:46] and make sure that I'm asking multiple times

[25:49] in different and creative ways throughout the customer journey,

[25:52] then I implement that next.

[25:53] Again, we're getting more for what we put in.

[25:55] And if we get more, that's going to increase our cash flow

[25:57] without adding cost basis to the business.

[25:59] So it's basically thinking about it as like decreasing risk

[26:01] and increasing our ability to make bets.

[26:03] After we've got the long term nurturing firing,

[26:05] and we've got the referral system going,

[26:07] this should give us a little bit of padding

[26:09] to then invest in the second channel.

[26:11] Now, when I say invest, the way that it typically works

[26:15] is that you will see no outcome for an extended period

[26:19] and then all of a sudden it will start working.

[26:21] And you may get frustrated in the short term

[26:23] that you're not seeing immediate results,

[26:25] but welcome to business.

[26:26] You have to think long term about the value

[26:28] of what a second acquisition channel

[26:29] or third acquisition channel means to you.

[26:31] So number one is that when you do the second acquisition channel,

[26:34] you can immediately double sales or more.

[26:37] And if you double revenue, you typically

[26:39] far more than double profit.

[26:41] So that's number one.

[26:42] Number two is that the business itself becomes less risky.

[26:46] So not only are we adding revenue and profit of the business,

[26:49] the revenue and profits itself

[26:50] is more likely to continue

[26:52] and so the business itself becomes more valuable

[26:54] and you can sleep much better at night

[26:55] knowing that if one of these things goes down,

[26:57] my team is still fed.

[26:59] And so when we make this investment,

[27:01] here's one of the big known as,

[27:02] is you don't do two news.

[27:04] So what does that mean?

[27:05] Well, if you're gonna start a new channel, that's one new.

[27:08] What you don't wanna do is put a new person

[27:10] on a new channel, because they don't know

[27:12] which new is the problem, because even if you take you

[27:15] and maybe you're really good or you're best person

[27:17] and you put them on the new channel,

[27:19] well, there's already the newness of the new channel

[27:21] and you won't know, but if it's somebody

[27:23] who knows who's really good,

[27:24] then at least we're working through the channel itself.

[27:27] Otherwise, you could be stuck paying lots of money

[27:29] for a long period of time not knowing

[27:32] if you're solving the right problem,

[27:33] which is why I'm such an advocate for founders

[27:35] to have deep understanding of the core processes

[27:37] of the business, which for me are understand

[27:40] how you get customers who can be marketing and sales

[27:42] and understand how you deliver value.

[27:44] Now, if you wanted to outsource IT,

[27:45] if you wanted outsource accounting,

[27:46] if you wanted outsource HR or payroll processing,

[27:49] those are things that I don't see as core to the business.

[27:50] You can of course bring them in house

[27:51] when it costs make sense.

[27:52] But in terms of the core economic engine of the business,

[27:56] those are the things that you, the founder,

[27:58] the entrepreneur want to understand intimately.

[28:00] If I am going to start a new channel,

[28:01] I do these two things first in order to give myself

[28:04] some breather room, I get a little more cash flow,

[28:06] I get a little bit more from what I'm already doing.

[28:08] And then I have one new, which is the new channel

[28:12] and then old person.

[28:14] Now, it doesn't actually have to be old,

[28:15] but it's somebody that I know.

[28:17] And so this can be tough because you're like,

[28:19] wait, wait, I don't want my original channel to go down,

[28:22] which is the most common thing that happens in the situation.

[28:25] And so my recommendation is transfer the skill

[28:29] on the first channel first to someone else,

[28:33] make sure that they can handle that

[28:35] without decreasing performance ideally it goes up.

[28:38] Then and only then, you can then make the investment

[28:42] into the second channel, where you're the old guy

[28:45] and the channels the new thing.

[28:46] Now, if you want to bring somebody in to help you with this,

[28:49] I think that's a great idea.

[28:50] Like if you're a larger business into like,

[28:52] I can't actually just like figure out,

[28:53] cold outbound, that's fine.

[28:55] But you basically have a thought partner

[28:56] and you guys are working through it together

[28:58] because you'll have more context on the business overall

[29:00] and maybe they have more context on the methodology

[29:03] that you're going to use for the second channel.

[29:05] But that merger, those things coming together

[29:06] where you learn a lot about the method,

[29:08] they learn a lot about the context of the business,

[29:10] both people get better.

[29:11] This is how I've been able to successfully

[29:14] use all of these different methods

[29:15] of getting customers in different companies.

[29:17] Now that we've covered single channel risk,

[29:19] the next mistake that business owners make,

[29:21] under 10 million, is key customer risk.

[29:24] And we're almost there.

[29:25] I mean, you can see this tiny little gap here.

[29:27] I guess we could fall down here to our deaths,

[29:29] but we're going to assume that we've got some pretty good

[29:31] ups here and we can make this little jump.

[29:33] So here's a visual to kind of make this sense for you.

[29:36] If any customer or associated customers,

[29:39] left tomorrow, would your revenue drop by 20% or more?

[29:42] Now, the reason 20% is kind of the number I choose

[29:44] is that most businesses run at 10, 20, 30, 40% margins.

[29:48] And so, if you had even a 40% margin,

[29:49] which would be a great margin,

[29:51] you lose half your profit.

[29:52] This would be material to the business itself

[29:55] and its value.

[29:56] So I'll give you a real business start.

[29:57] So I'm a business owner, come out to Acquisitor.com,

[30:00] who is an agent see owner.

[30:02] And he had 10 customers.

[30:04] And nine of his customers were small, like tech, SEO,

[30:10] agency customers.

[30:11] And then one customer was Google itself.

[30:14] And he was a massive percentage of his revenue.

[30:17] So for him, for this example, this was actually 70%

[30:21] of his revenue.

[30:22] So if you actually look at the meat of this fish

[30:24] and you added all these little pieces of meat

[30:25] in between together, this is definitely the fish

[30:28] that has all the money.

[30:29] If I'm this owner, I'm like, oh my god,

[30:31] if I lose this whale, it's going to kill my business.

[30:34] I'm going to, I won't be able to have to let go of half my staff.

[30:36] Certainly lose all my profit.

[30:38] And so this is a huge risk to the business.

[30:41] So there are four proven ways to solve this problem.

[30:44] So when this business owner came out,

[30:46] I said, we're going to go through all four

[30:47] and you're going to pick the one

[30:48] that you think you have the highest likelihood of achieving.

[30:50] And so this is you, this is how you solve it.

[30:53] So the first way you can do it is that you simply go get more.

[30:57] I got to draw these fish because I have to think about how

[31:00] to draw these little fishies here.

[31:02] All of a sudden, you get a bunch more minas

[31:04] and then all of a sudden, by percentage,

[31:07] man, these are ugly fish.

[31:08] By percentage, you know what?

[31:10] This whale isn't 70% of my business anymore.

[31:12] So you just keep adding minas to your boat.

[31:15] And then all of a sudden, you're like, you know what?

[31:16] My minas weigh out, weigh my whale.

[31:18] And so I don't have key customers anymore.

[31:20] The second way is that you lock this whale in

[31:23] to a long-term contract.

[31:25] So just think about this whale as signing his life away.

[31:27] But you get Google or whatever this customer is to sign

[31:30] a three year, a five year, a seven year commitment.

[31:33] And you can add some bonuses in there

[31:35] and say you're going to have some dedicated reps.

[31:37] So you're going to have some sort of discount

[31:39] that might be associated with that kind of commitment.

[31:41] But when they do that, then it makes it more stable

[31:43] because it's unlikely that they're going to leave.

[31:45] And if you want to be smart about this,

[31:47] just a little pro tip, add a little breakup fee,

[31:50] because some people are still going to back out

[31:52] on their agreement and you don't want to get into a legal battle.

[31:54] So you want to just give them some way in the future.

[31:57] But just knowing that there's this nut

[31:59] that they're going to have to pay, will prolong how long

[32:03] they'll stay with you.

[32:04] And so I would probably charge somewhere in the neighborhood

[32:07] of 10 to 20% of the contract,

[32:09] and all of the stuff's negotiable as a breakup fee.

[32:11] So if someone has a five year deal that I might say,

[32:14] you have to pay a year if you're going to break up beforehand.

[32:17] Another way of thinking about it is saying,

[32:19] whatever discount I gave you,

[32:20] you're going to have to pay to make up that discount

[32:22] for the entirety of the contract in order to leave the contract.

[32:26] Another one is that they have to give you six or 12 months

[32:28] of heads up.

[32:29] So there's a lot of ways that you can write terms around this

[32:32] with the whale to decrease the likelihood

[32:34] that they leave and disrupt the business.

[32:36] Now that's path number two.

[32:38] The third path is, and this is my preferred path,

[32:41] is you just get more damn whales.

[32:44] And then all of a sudden you realize, you know what?

[32:46] Dude, I'm in the whale business.

[32:48] Why was I hunting Minos?

[32:50] Look at the meat on these guys, right?

[32:52] And so all of a sudden you don't try to outnumber with Minos,

[32:55] you make all of a sudden you just go get five,

[32:58] six more whales, and this isn't 10% or 20% of your business.

[33:02] So path four is a nasty one,

[33:05] and for many of you, if this is your situation,

[33:08] it may actually be the right path.

[33:09] And I'll tell you story to illustrate it.

[33:11] So there was a recruiting firm that I was talking to,

[33:13] and they had grown a decent amount,

[33:14] and they had this Mando contract

[33:16] that was on the horizon.

[33:17] And so they staff for very specific types of engineering

[33:20] roles that were difficult to find.

[33:21] So they definitely had a niche that they had found.

[33:23] And they had some big whale come to them and say,

[33:25] hey, we want you to staff us with 20 new employees a month,

[33:29] which was a big contract for this firm.

[33:31] So this firm was probably doing six, 700,000 dollars a month,

[33:33] and so this would be like an additional

[33:35] 200,000 dollars a month that they were going to be able

[33:36] to contract through this new whale.

[33:40] When they were asking,

[33:41] how should we negotiate this deal?

[33:43] What pricing should we put in there?

[33:45] I thought about it for a long time,

[33:46] and I was like, you know what, guys,

[33:47] I think the actual best move is to not do this deal.

[33:51] Because they were going to have to basically change

[33:54] the fundamentals of their business,

[33:55] their pricing, their delivery,

[33:57] the whale demanded so many custom things

[34:00] that were only going to be a use case for them,

[34:02] and we're not going to service the rest of their customers.

[34:04] And they had no way of reliably acquiring the whale.

[34:07] So I'll explain the difference.

[34:08] So if the whale comes in through a tried and true channel,

[34:13] then this might make a ton of sense.

[34:15] But if you just get a random referral,

[34:17] or you just meet somebody,

[34:18] you work from your network, building your entire business

[34:20] around an unsustainable or unpredictable way

[34:23] of getting this type of customer is probably not smart.

[34:26] Now, if that recruiting firm, it said,

[34:28] hey, we just got our first whale,

[34:30] but we have a new way of getting whales, then I say,

[34:33] oh, this is the first whale of many.

[34:35] This makes sense.

[34:36] But if this is just a random lottery ticket

[34:38] that falls into your lap,

[34:40] you have to make the decision of what business

[34:42] so I really want to be in,

[34:43] and what customer do I really want to serve?

[34:45] I think that this entrepreneur just saw dollar science

[34:47] in his eyes, but didn't calculate the cost

[34:50] of what it would mean to his business

[34:51] and the disruption of the main economic engine

[34:54] that he had spent years putting together.

[34:56] And so path 4 is you just realize that this whale

[35:00] might be someone else's customer, and you let it swim

[35:03] on by.

[35:04] And the fourth one, and this one is a crazy one

[35:06] that I've got a story for you, is single vendor risk.

[35:11] So this is where one vendor, so think about any person

[35:14] that's a business that you pay to help you do business

[35:18] is responsible for key function of the business.

[35:21] And so there's a ton of examples of this.

[35:23] If you have all your customers from SEO, for example,

[35:26] and you have an SEO agency who does it for you,

[35:28] if you have all your leads from PPC or Metaats,

[35:32] and somebody else has all of that taken care of,

[35:34] but they're an outside company, that is key vendor risk.

[35:38] Unfortunately, I've had this happen a lot.

[35:40] All right, so with prestige labs, I had one manufacturer

[35:44] who made our products.

[35:45] We found out that he ended up stealing about $400,000 in cash

[35:49] that I had sent.

[35:50] So he kept asking for early and early repayment on stuff

[35:54] to locking greater discounts.

[35:55] And in general, if I have cash,

[35:57] and I can guarantee a 10 or 20% return on that money,

[36:00] then it's almost like I could put it in the stock market

[36:02] but I know for sure I'm going to get 20% discount for sure

[36:05] that it's like getting a 20% return on the money guarantee.

[36:08] So I'll take those deals when they come,

[36:11] but kept asking for early and early and early and early.

[36:13] And when we just said, hey, you know what?

[36:15] It had been enough times.

[36:16] I were like, why don't you just send us what you owe us

[36:19] in terms of product?

[36:20] All of a sudden, he couldn't.

[36:22] Because what he had used is he was using R cash

[36:25] to run his business rather than use it as an account

[36:28] for the products and raw materials

[36:30] that he needed to purchase for our account.

[36:32] Obviously, that was a big no-no.

[36:34] And we were able to thankfully bridge to another provider

[36:38] and not really create a disruption.

[36:39] But for probably a period of six months,

[36:41] we were running out of product on a regular basis

[36:44] and had like three month lead times

[36:47] where we had to basically make this transition

[36:49] and we lost a serious amount of revenue.

[36:50] And that was a big hit both to the revenue,

[36:52] but also just reputation.

[36:54] Because prestige labs sold through affiliates.

[36:56] It still does sell through affiliates.

[36:57] And during that period of affiliates were like,

[36:59] do we can't sell half the products we normally do

[37:00] because you don't have a stock.

[37:02] And so that was very tough and I learned that lesson.

[37:04] Prestige Labs, which was a sub-in company

[37:05] that I owned it about 20 million bucks a year.

[37:07] And I ended up selling that in that $42 million sale

[37:11] to American Pacific Group in 2021.

[37:13] Allen was a third company that I started and sold in 2021,

[37:17] which was a company that helped brick-and-mortar businesses

[37:20] work their leads through automated messaging.

[37:24] And I didn't understand how software worked at the time.

[37:27] And so I just said, cool, I know this problem.

[37:30] I'm gonna go hire an outsource dev team

[37:32] to go build me the software stack and they did.

[37:35] And Loan behold, here's the crazy thing.

[37:37] No one on my team was any bit technological

[37:40] or a developer.

[37:41] And so 100% of the development was happening

[37:43] in this outside shop.

[37:45] What do you think the outside shop owner did?

[37:48] When all of a sudden, this thing that he built

[37:50] is doing 500,800,000, 800,000, a million, 1.2, 1.5,

[37:55] 1.7 million dollars in sales.

[37:58] All of a sudden, magically, what was once 100,000 dollars

[38:01] a month in development became 200, 300, 500,000 dollars

[38:05] a month in development because he could see

[38:07] how much money we were making.

[38:08] Which is why I'm such an advocate

[38:09] if you are gonna start a software company,

[38:11] you want that person to be in house,

[38:12] at least it'd be key man-risk that you can control, right?

[38:15] But instead, I had a key vendor who literally

[38:18] designed and built the entire product that I was selling.

[38:21] And so this guy had me buy the boss.

[38:23] There was nothing I could do.

[38:25] And so I had to start building an in-house team

[38:27] in parallel without trying to let him know

[38:31] that I'm doing this because obviously he could see

[38:33] the writing on the wall.

[38:34] And then he was difficult to work with the transfer

[38:36] in the knowledge over it.

[38:37] It was a nightmare.

[38:38] That was my second big experience with this.

[38:40] The third, you're like, you should learn this lesson.

[38:42] You know what?

[38:43] Sometimes it takes me a while.

[38:45] Another one was, and I've had multiple with this,

[38:47] but payment processor.

[38:48] So in my first book, $100 million offers,

[38:51] I talk about high loss my payment processor.

[38:54] And it was this terrible experience for me

[38:56] because it was the only problem I'd ever encountered

[38:58] in my life that I couldn't save with sales,

[39:00] because no one would process the money.

[39:02] Tiled the R, I was running a national business

[39:06] out of a brick and mortar store that I had in Southern California.

[39:09] So I'm processing payments out of Canada,

[39:11] I'm processing payments out of Mexico,

[39:13] I'm processing payments out of the United States,

[39:15] all over the country.

[39:16] And they're like, wait, how is this happening?

[39:18] Out of a little brick and mortar store in California.

[39:20] I didn't know how this worked.

[39:21] I was 25 years old.

[39:22] And so I broke the rules and was unaware of it.

[39:25] And so they held my processing.

[39:26] After that happened, and you only need to tap in once,

[39:29] for every single business that I've had afterwards,

[39:31] I always have redundancies in processing.

[39:34] Meaning I have multiple processors that are approved,

[39:37] spun up, and can handle the entirety of my monthly volume,

[39:40] at a moment's notice.

[39:41] This is also important from a negotiating perspective.

[39:44] Because I only had one payment processor,

[39:46] I had no ability to negotiate anything

[39:49] in terms of my fees as well.

[39:51] And so having multiple there that are approved

[39:53] gave me leverage with the relationship,

[39:54] I got better service.

[39:56] And if for whatever reason something goes down,

[39:58] I can switch it over in a heartbeat

[39:59] and not even miss anything.

[40:01] Now, I had a second occurrence with this later on in my career,

[40:06] where we did have redundancies.

[40:08] And here was the issue.

[40:09] I had a recurring revenue business

[40:11] and the payment processor acted a little bit shady,

[40:14] which is why I decided to shift away

[40:15] from that specific processor.

[40:17] And they said, oh, if you want to transfer away

[40:20] from us, that's going to cost $150,000.

[40:23] And I was like, what?

[40:24] And they're like, yeah, it's just a lot of work

[40:26] to transfer all those things over.

[40:27] I was like, I'm pretty sure it's a button

[40:28] that you click export.

[40:30] The thing is, is what was I going to do?

[40:31] I had multiple millions a month

[40:33] in recurring revenue across thousands of customers.

[40:36] There was nothing I could do.

[40:37] It was basically extortion.

[40:39] I paid the bill.

[40:40] And then I got all my customer information

[40:42] and I transferred it to a more ethical provider.

[40:44] And so I bring these stories up because I hope that you

[40:47] don't have to live through each of these.

[40:49] Let's get to the tactics for how to actually

[40:51] solve against key vendor risk.

[40:53] And I think this one can be so nasty

[40:55] because it's one of the only times

[40:57] where like the person on the other side of the table

[40:59] has leverage.

[41:00] And if you don't have a good personal on the other side,

[41:03] like they may use it and they may try to put you out of business

[41:06] or put you just as close to getting out of business

[41:09] as they, I mean, they basically can just blackmail you

[41:11] for your own business.

[41:12] And the amount they can blackmail you for is proportional

[41:15] to how much money you got, at least how much money

[41:17] they think you got.

[41:18] So number one, rule, always have backups

[41:21] for just about everything that's important.

[41:23] So you want to think about this in terms of acquisition,

[41:25] conversion, product, and then the layer on top of this

[41:28] obviously is processing banking, anything that you do

[41:32] that facilitates transactions with customers.

[41:34] And so the big solution, and we're going to put this

[41:36] in big green letters.

[41:37] So solution number one is redundancy.

[41:41] Right?

[41:42] Now, I want to be clear about redundancy.

[41:44] Sometimes redundancy looks like waste,

[41:47] but is actually insurance, the day you need it.

[41:50] Think about it this way.

[41:51] If I pay for fire insurance, and my house never catches on fire,

[41:55] if I knew for a fact that my house would never catch on fire,

[41:58] then 100% of that money is completely wasted.

[42:00] I literally just flushed the money down the toilet

[42:02] because I didn't get anything for it.

[42:03] If my house does catch on fire, the day it catches on fire,

[42:07] every one of those payments was 100% worth it.

[42:11] I see redundancy the same way, which is that it is insurance

[42:14] against existential threats to the business.

[42:17] And these are the things that I'm telling you,

[42:19] we're now that I have these things in place.

[42:22] It's like one, I have leverage negotiations,

[42:24] which is probably the more reasonable thing

[42:26] that you get in terms of short-term benefits

[42:27] of having redundancy.

[42:28] The second is that you sleep great at night knowing

[42:30] that your business can't get taken down

[42:32] at least from the things that you know about.

[42:34] Like listen, you can't control the unknown at nones,

[42:36] but at least control the knowns.

[42:38] If the chickens do come home to roost,

[42:41] and you do have that bad day,

[42:42] and the bill is due, then you will be grateful

[42:45] that you had this redundancy in place.

[42:46] The second way of doing this

[42:49] is having mutually disinterest structure.

[42:51] So what does that even mean?

[42:52] It basically means that if the bigger you get,

[42:55] the bigger you are as a percentage of their business,

[42:58] the more they need to keep your business,

[43:00] and not let you go.

[43:02] Because basically, you shift from them being key vendor risk

[43:06] to you becoming key customer risk for them.

[43:08] And so the shift in power, basically, the bigger you get,

[43:11] the more important you are to them.

[43:13] And so there's this saying in the finance world,

[43:15] where it's like, if you owe a bank a million dollars,

[43:17] they own you.

[43:18] If you owe a bank a billion dollars, you own them.

[43:20] Now obviously depends on the size of the bank

[43:22] and things like that,

[43:23] but the saying kind of carries.

[43:26] And so you wanna understand what percentage of the business

[43:28] their business you are,

[43:30] and that way, if they fuck you, they get fucked too.

[43:33] So this is where the size of the person that you're working with

[43:36] can be kind of a double edged sword.

[43:38] The small guys are probably the guys

[43:39] and they're the most likely to do the shady stuff.

[43:41] And then on the other hand,

[43:42] if you become a huge percentage of their business,

[43:43] you have some leverage back towards them.

[43:46] And so redundancy number one,

[43:48] mutually into your destruction number two,

[43:49] and here's a big one,

[43:50] Covenant in terms, all right, so I'll just say,

[43:54] which are just fancy ways of saying, what do we agree to?

[43:56] Kind of like key customers,

[43:57] because key customer key vendor

[43:59] kind of upsets sides at the same point.

[44:01] All the terms that we asked from our customers before

[44:03] in the last section from mistakes,

[44:05] we also can ask now as the customer of the vendor.

[44:08] So we say, hey, if you wanna stop doing business with us,

[44:10] you have to give us a six or 12 month lead time

[44:13] to letting us know that that's gonna occur

[44:14] so that we can find another vendor.

[44:16] So this number one is lead time.

[44:18] Number two is you can have a breakup fee associated.

[44:20] Now you can imagine on the other side of the vendor,

[44:22] you're like, this guy wants to put a breakup fee on me.

[44:24] My god, this guy's gonna be sticky.

[44:25] But at this point, when you have key components of the business

[44:29] that are out of the rest,

[44:29] which I fundamentally don't do this anymore,

[44:32] because I have been screwed so many times,

[44:34] which is why I think that marketing, sales, delivery,

[44:37] should be in house to a business,

[44:38] because it's just too important.

[44:40] But like payment processing,

[44:42] it's unlikely you can start a payment process

[44:43] and it's just to be able to process your own payments.

[44:45] Right, there are some things that are gonna be outsourced.

[44:46] You have to have trust.

[44:47] One is give that up.

[44:50] Two is the breakup fee.

[44:51] Third is that you have fees or fines associated

[44:55] with service level agreements meeting.

[44:56] You're going to respond to us on this timeline.

[45:00] You're going to ship to us products

[45:02] or raw materials on this schedule.

[45:03] You're going to get us leisure on this amount of ads

[45:06] on this cadence.

[45:07] And when we think about it that way,

[45:08] that allows to say if you don't do those things,

[45:11] then you hedge the amount of money

[45:12] that you would have lost as a result

[45:14] of them not doing the work with the fine associates.

[45:17] There's basically a hedge.

[45:18] Now, if you have a vendor,

[45:20] they're gonna try and decrease with that amount of money is.

[45:22] But them also having transparency

[45:25] into understanding how important their role is

[45:27] is again, a double ed sword.

[45:29] One is the understand leverage.

[45:30] On the other hand, if you get the term inside the deal,

[45:33] in terms of the cash required from them

[45:35] to make sure that they're doing their job,

[45:37] you cover your downside.

[45:38] Finally, and this is a bit of like an advanced move,

[45:41] if you become significantly bigger than they are

[45:43] or your huge percentage of their business

[45:45] and they're still important to you,

[45:47] that's where things like aqua hire

[45:49] as an acquisitions can be very strategic.

[45:52] So you say, hey, 100 West Circumstances

[45:54] would you like to do what you do inside of our company?

[45:56] Is there a way that we could work together more permanently?

[45:59] And then you permanently align the incentives

[46:01] if they're doing a good job.

[46:02] Now, if they're doing a terrible job,

[46:03] then you have to do what I do that.

[46:04] But this is how I think through reducing

[46:06] risk with key vendors who are core to how we make money

[46:12] and if they were to disappear, so to what our business.

[46:15] And so once this happens, you get your Superman cape.

[46:19] And then all of a sudden, this becomes a fist,

[46:24] a fist of fury, if you will.

[46:25] And then you can, this is a dotted line

[46:27] because you can fly and you realize

[46:29] that you didn't even need the bridge to begin with

[46:31] because you're such a good business owner.

[46:33] And then you go take the money and save the world

[46:37] or do whatever Superman would do with $46, $200,

[46:40] which would probably be, you know,

[46:41] try to double-down and make a lot more.

[46:43] So that you could actually make a difference in the world

[46:45] rather than just as old life.

[46:47] I've talked to over a thousand business owners

[46:49] in person this year.

[46:51] I compiled the six most common mistakes

[46:54] that prevent small businesses from becoming big businesses.

[46:58] And I made a whole video about it.

[46:59] So if you're stuck, this is for you.

[00:00] 5,000 people.

[00:02] That's the amount of people who registered for my last book launch for 10000 dollars leads.

[00:06] But that's something that the crazy part is that almost a third of those people didn't

[00:10] even know what it was.

[00:11] They were actually referred to the launch by other people for free.

[00:15] Most businesses don't know how to use this advertising method.

[00:17] And so I'm going to show you not just the theory, but the tactics of how I'm setting up

[00:22] the affiliate structure for my 100-millimeter money models launch so that you can take

[00:26] every single tactic because you're going to understand how in depth it really is if you

[00:29] want to use this as your advertising strategy for your business or whatever it is yourself.

[00:33] So first things first, what the hell is an affiliate?

[00:35] So we're opening up our fun leads book and an affiliate is a lead geter.

[00:38] Somebody gets your leads.

[00:39] They're an independent business that tells their audience to buy your stuff.

[00:43] Affiliates seem like referrals on the outside, but are much different under the hood.

[00:46] First, they own their own businesses and do their own advertising.

[00:48] Second, they agreed to offer your stuff to their engaged leads and exchange for money,

[00:52] free stuff, or both.

[00:53] So just like any business should always start with the offer, which is what are you going to

[00:57] sell?

[00:58] What are you going to give away?

[00:59] This is the same thing.

[01:00] They're a new customer that you have to think about.

[01:02] What's the offer going to make the affiliate?

[01:03] Again, it's money, free stuff for both.

[01:05] Now, you can use whatever one you want.

[01:07] You can do combinations for my $100 million leads and $100 million.

[01:11] Money models launch, I'm using free stuff.

[01:13] Number one reason for that is because paper requires it's an absolute pain in the ass to

[01:16] pay a gazillion people with 1099s and it's a nightmare.

[01:20] But beyond that, I can also still provide value that probably be better than maybe just

[01:24] some sort of kickback.

[01:25] And that's the thing is that sometimes the non-monitorial value can be significantly higher than

[01:28] just trying to pay someone 10% back or something like that.

[01:31] And especially if you have something like a book, which is not super expensive, these

[01:34] other things can make it worth it for an audience.

[01:37] But let's get into the offer.

[01:38] So whenever I set up an affiliate structure, I want to have a two tier structure.

[01:42] So what that means is I want to have something for all the killers at the top who are going

[01:45] to send me a bunch of people with big audiences and whatnot.

[01:48] And I want to have something so that the every man can still get something.

[01:52] Because I still want the long tail.

[01:53] I still want all the people who are going to bring three friends, five friends, 10

[01:55] friends.

[01:56] And I also want the people who want to bring 10,000.

[01:57] So you don't want to have something that's only for one or the other you want both.

[01:59] I think about it like this.

[02:01] If we draw this, what are the big players getting?

[02:03] So for us, we're doing top 10 people get a fire side in person, one on one Q&A session.

[02:11] Now, there's some thinking behind this.

[02:12] Why do we do this?

[02:13] We do this because the prices you want to give an affiliate has to not only benefit the

[02:17] affiliate, it also has to benefit their audience.

[02:20] This is something that like so many people don't get.

[02:23] You can get significantly higher engagement from affiliates.

[02:25] If they don't feel like they're hard closing their audience on your thing, because at

[02:30] the end of the day they're like, I got to save my goodwill, my whatever for my own stuff.

[02:33] And that makes sense.

[02:34] Of course they do.

[02:35] So it's like, how can we make the thing that we're going to give them something

[02:38] that's a give to their audience?

[02:40] So it doesn't detract from the goodwill they have.

[02:42] And ideally, it adds to the goodwill so that you ultimately benefit them and their audience.

[02:46] So you want a win-win win, win for you and for the affiliate and their people.

[02:50] With the fires side chat, the key is their audience is going to want to click through

[02:53] their link.

[02:54] So that they can submit their questions so that the person who represents them can then

[02:58] ask those questions on their behalf.

[03:00] So this becomes very valuable.

[03:01] Like, oh, we're in the ATM niche.

[03:03] It's like, okay, well then how do we apply some of this Alex big business stuff to an ATM

[03:07] niche?

[03:08] Well, they wouldn't probably get that answer answered.

[03:09] Otherwise, unless it's like that guy's in front of me and that's what we're talking

[03:11] about for 30 minutes in person.

[03:13] Now, the next year is like, okay, well, some people are going to be like, well, top 10

[03:16] that might be tough, but I think I could hit the top 50.

[03:18] Okay, well, the top 50 can be their in person.

[03:20] So there are approximations of this thing.

[03:22] There's still in person, and then I'm basically taking three hours.

[03:25] This is in person all of this at my headquarters, where I'm going to do Q&A.

[03:29] I'll be able to answer maybe a question from them, but they're going to be there.

[03:32] They're going to meet one another.

[03:33] Still super valuable, great experience.

[03:34] Okay, that's the top 50 on top of this.

[03:37] There's also a dinner that I'm taking all the top 10 guys out to.

[03:41] So it's even cool.

[03:42] Now, what about the bottom guys?

[03:43] So 10 plus.

[03:44] So first we have to decide, what is the thing that is the kind of bottom?

[03:47] What's the minimum activation point for somebody to become an affiliate or a fur that gets

[03:50] something?

[03:51] It depends on how difficult it is to do.

[03:53] So if I said, like, you have to bring someone in person to my facility, like a gym or

[03:56] something, then it might be two people.

[03:58] Because that's a lot of work.

[03:59] Now, if it's just like, can you make me a text introduction?

[04:01] It's like that might be, you know, a four or five.

[04:04] Now, if it's just, can you get someone to opt into something?

[04:06] I have to make that higher because the friction solo.

[04:08] I mean, it's 10 plus.

[04:10] That's what I did last year.

[04:11] It worked great.

[04:12] So I'm doing it again.

[04:13] If somebody can get 10 plus opt-ins into my thing for us as the book launch, then they're

[04:17] going to get multiple things.

[04:18] So number one, is they're going to get an audio book that's not the book for the launch.

[04:22] It's actually a separate book I recorded specifically for my affiliates.

[04:26] 70 plus one minute tactics that drive profit in businesses.

[04:30] So it's like, it's just super bite size, very tactical, really cool.

[04:35] And I made something really sexy because I want that long tell this people who just want

[04:38] to bite their 10, their 10 friends or their Slack group or their WhatsApp group or their

[04:41] school community, whatever is.

[04:42] They're like, I don't think I'm going to get top 50.

[04:44] But if you think you're going to bite 20 to 30 people, then get credit for it.

[04:47] You don't get some free stuff.

[04:48] But on top of that, what else can I do?

[04:50] Well, there's also these 50 other seats on this day over here.

[04:54] Well, I could just say top 100, but wouldn't it be more valuable to say, hey, I'll

[04:57] raffle these off to 50 of the people who get this?

[05:00] So that's what we're doing.

[05:01] So this is the offer.

[05:02] This is the thing that we give away.

[05:04] The stuff that we want to do is number one, you want it to be big and sexy.

[05:07] Number two, I like things that are unscalable, especially at the top.

[05:10] Of course, I can't do a fire search.

[05:11] I would have thousand people.

[05:12] It wouldn't work for them.

[05:13] It wouldn't work for me.

[05:14] But how can I create something great that many people would want and then create varying

[05:18] levels of approximation to this?

[05:20] Which then adds in the last piece here, which is everybody who's over that head gets a recording.

[05:25] Top 10 guys gets to be in person with their questions answered and a dinner.

[05:29] The top 50 get three hours on a shot at getting their question, but they're still in person

[05:33] and they still get the experience.

[05:35] If you're in the just 10 plus options, you're going to get an audio book, you're going

[05:38] to get a shot at getting in the room and you're still going to get a recording, which

[05:41] isn't a proximation of that.

[05:43] So I try to think, how could this be something that would benefit their audience and benefit

[05:46] them and later our way up to performance?

[05:49] I'll spend two days on just coming up with this stuff.

[05:53] The amount of different permutations we came up with to try and make this clear and simple

[05:59] and compelling and beneficial to every party with stuff.

[06:03] But now we fit it in and you're like, oh, well, it seems obvious now.

[06:05] It always seems obvious in retrospect.

[06:08] And so when you're thinking about yours, like this is the highest leverage thing you can

[06:11] do.

[06:12] If you offer good enough, you can get, you can move mountains.

[06:14] So now that we have our offer, the next thing that comes up, how are we going to tell

[06:19] people about this offer so that they sign up for it?

[06:22] So that brings the next thing up.

[06:24] Now that you have the offer, you have to put a place that people can find out about it.

[06:27] And so what we did is we built an affiliate sales page.

[06:30] All right.

[06:31] So it is exactly what it sounds like, which is we have to sell people on why they should

[06:34] become an affiliate or why they should refer their friends to our thing.

[06:38] An affiliate sales page is fairly straightforward.

[06:40] It's just explaining each of the prizes and exactly what they have to do and how we're

[06:44] going to help them do it.

[06:45] For us, already, whatever the prizes, what they have to do is they have to opt in.

[06:49] So they just put their name and email, et cetera.

[06:52] And then they submit this.

[06:54] And what happens is they then get a little link that they use to then rank on the leader

[06:59] board and send all their traffic through.

[07:01] It's like, OK, that's the how.

[07:03] Now what else am I going to do?

[07:05] Well, one is I'm going to support them.

[07:07] And the other thing is that once I know how I'm going to support them, then what's

[07:09] I have this whole machine together, then I'm going to start promoting it.

[07:11] So the way that we're going to support the affiliates is that we actually write them emails

[07:15] and posts and ads that we have already pre-approved and ridden that we already know work

[07:21] because we did it last year.

[07:23] And so we give them all of these ads posts and emails to send to their lists that they

[07:28] don't have to do any work.

[07:29] You don't want to have to be like, OK, go make a campaign for them.

[07:31] It's like, that's a big ask, right?

[07:33] But if I said, hey, here's some post-weird and work.

[07:34] Here's the ads that we work.

[07:35] Here's the emails that I work for.

[07:36] We're like, OK, cool.

[07:37] I'll just copy and paste these and maybe change a couple of things.

[07:39] I want to make it easy to become and affiliate to get the benefits.

[07:43] So we give this.

[07:44] Now on top of this, because I'm a maniac, what else do affiliates want?

[07:48] At least in my audience.

[07:49] A lot of them want to know what's happening behind the scenes.

[07:52] While the actual launch is going, one of the exclusive benefits we give to our affiliates,

[07:55] so this is like, maybe you could say it's related to this offer, but it's kind of like

[07:59] a dotted line.

[08:01] Is that behind the scenes we're actually sharing how each email is doing, what ads are

[08:06] performing, and so they can actually kind of fall along so that when they want to promote

[08:09] whatever it is that they sell, they can actually learn the process from the outside

[08:12] end, which I think is really cool.

[08:14] And probably one of the most underrated components of becoming affiliate.

[08:17] Now, once we have that, plus our BTS breakdowns.

[08:20] Now we have our machine.

[08:22] And so now what do we have to do?

[08:23] We've got to promote the hell out of this thing.

[08:26] And so we're not just going to promote it in one place.

[08:28] We're going to promote it in many.

[08:29] So the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to email my list.

[08:32] And you don't want to do this a ton because, hey, I mean, I want to promote the book,

[08:36] not promoting the book.

[08:38] And so I do this two times just one saying, hey, FYI, we have this and by the way, in

[08:43] case you missed it.

[08:44] That's it.

[08:45] After that, I'm not going to talk about it again.

[08:47] All my focus is going to be on the actual launch itself.

[08:50] That's number one.

[08:51] The second place that I'm going to look is last year's affiliates.

[08:54] Now, some of you guys might not have this, but I just want to be transparent and complete

[08:58] here is that I want to say, okay, well, we had 30 something thousand affiliates last year

[09:02] who promoted our stuff.

[09:03] I'm going to say, hey, you did this.

[09:05] Want to do it again.

[09:06] If you liked how it was last time and you liked having the behind the scenes, you liked

[09:09] the bonuses, you liked competing for stuff, which automatically just makes the whole event

[09:13] more fun because you know that you're in the drawing.

[09:14] Do you want to do it again?

[09:15] Let's run it back.

[09:16] And so there's going to be people that I'm going to email here.

[09:19] Wanted to, time separately as well.

[09:21] I feel okay emailing them, actually, because they already opted into the unifiliate before.

[09:24] So I'm not emailing the whole list just this very small segment.

[09:27] Now, what else are we going to do?

[09:30] Every single person who opt in for the book, this guy, our product service, is going to

[09:35] then have the option to, at the bottom, if they say, you know what, I just pre-ordered

[09:40] the book.

[09:41] And now I've got the thing you page where it gives me the reminder sequence to make sure

[09:44] that I show up for the event.

[09:46] If it's, hey, do you want to send anybody else or you have an audience?

[09:50] Would you like to get more free prizes?

[09:52] If they clicked the button there, it takes them to the affiliate sales page.

[09:55] And so all of these traffic sources are going to one place that then feeds into the

[09:59] machine where they get the behind the scenes training of what we're doing, plus the actual

[10:03] deliverables that they can get all so they can win these prizes.

[10:07] Now on top of this to make this the most metafing ever, this video is also something that

[10:13] is for affiliates.

[10:14] So this is the affiliate YouTube video, which is both me explaining how it works, but also showing

[10:19] how the machine is being put together as in putting it together.

[10:22] Which, by the way, when you pre-order for the book, if you already have on the thing

[10:26] you page, there's a button at the bottom, you can hit it and go to the affiliate sales

[10:29] page and I'll probably put the link somewhere here or here somewhere, magic, that you

[10:34] can go to sign up.

[10:36] All right, very simple.

[10:37] By the way, if you're thinking about this, it's like, okay, what are all the advertising

[10:41] methods that we're using?

[10:42] We are using warm and cold outreach via us reaching out to our existing affiliates, see

[10:48] if we can bring the high-level speech people on, emails also the same thing there.

[10:52] Posting free content, that's what this is, that's what this video is.

[10:55] I'm not running ads to get affiliates because I'd rather just focus on the book and let

[11:00] that flow come in through here.

[11:02] So I guess technically I am running ads to get pre-orders for the book and registrations

[11:06] for the book, but then it ultimately still leads to promoting the book itself if you were

[11:09] going to do it anyways.

[11:11] We use all of these core four in order to get the affiliates.

[11:15] And then the affiliates, we then spin the same things for them.

[11:18] How do you make posts?

[11:19] How do you make emails?

[11:20] How do you make ads so that they can do the same thing for us?

[11:22] So that is the cycle of the core four and the lead getters being done together.

[11:27] You tell people about your stuff and then other people tell people about your stuff.

[11:31] That's the game.

[11:32] Now that we know what our offer is and we know how we're going to build the machine and

[11:36] we know how we're going to promote the affiliates.

[11:38] Well we can't just expect that they're just going to be like, oh great, I'm just going to

[11:40] match the criminal your stuff, of course not.

[11:43] And again this is another place where business is follow up.

[11:45] So if any of the three steps I went over you weren't doing for your stuff, well you can

[11:48] just stop right there, it's not going to work.

[11:49] You have to have every one of these pieces for you expect people to actually promote your

[11:53] stuff.

[11:54] You got to make it worth it for me, we got to let them know about it and you got to make it easy.

[11:55] So what do we do?

[11:57] So number one is we want to have some sort of onboarding plus activation.

[12:02] The simple thing is obviously, well you got to opt in fine.

[12:05] That's the first thing you do.

[12:06] The next thing is if we can get any other data on the affiliates that helps us out so we

[12:10] can help them out, we'll do that too.

[12:12] The next is we want to have some sort of fast reward.

[12:15] And so the way that we do that is they get their custom link.

[12:18] And if they don't believe that you have good attribution tracking, they're like, wait, why am I

[12:21] going to send all this track?

[12:22] If I don't know that you're actually going to count it for me.

[12:24] So we have to have a custom link that they know and we have to demonstrate that we have

[12:28] good attribution.

[12:29] Now the way that we do that is through a leaderboard.

[12:32] So we want to show in real time that their stuff is getting tracked and they can know how

[12:37] they stack up compared to everybody else.

[12:39] So the next thing after we give them the onboarding they get their custom link, they get

[12:42] attributions, they're like, okay, they're all set up is we give the collateral.

[12:45] So I talked about this briefly before, but I want to make this like a very big point because

[12:48] this is where a lot of people fall off again is that if you expect them to make an entire

[12:54] campaign to launch your thing good luck, it's not going to happen.

[12:58] So it's like you have to make it fast and easy.

[13:00] And so what we do is one is there's the regular communication.

[13:04] Now part of that is just awesome and fun because anybody who markets or sells stuff like,

[13:07] I mean, I might myself include it.

[13:09] I love to know what are the winners, what's working and what are the stats, that's the

[13:13] stuff that we share behind the scenes and I think that generates a ton of interest or

[13:17] at least it did last year.

[13:18] People really loved it.

[13:19] And honestly, we enjoy doing it because it's like, we can't share any of this stuff.

[13:22] So it's like cool to least share with some people who dig this thing.

[13:25] So regular communication is one of them.

[13:27] But the other is knowing the winners.

[13:28] All right.

[13:29] And so this is where we create the black books.

[13:31] This is all the collateral that you will use, plug and play that you can use into your

[13:36] marketing.

[13:37] Again, and it's going to be all of the different ways to market.

[13:39] Content adds outreach the email typically.

[13:43] And when we have all those things, including test messages, which we also give, so that

[13:46] people can messes their threads, their slacks at work, so that people just don't have to

[13:50] think about it.

[13:51] This is another thing that makes them more successful.

[13:53] And one of the other benefits here is that if we write the collateral, then we know that

[13:57] everything is being represented properly.

[13:59] So it's not like, this is going to be a get rich quick, like, no, of course not.

[14:03] But we want to make sure that we're just, you know, that the messaging is aligned, that

[14:06] everyone who comes in is expecting the same things that we can deliver on expectation.

[14:09] And included within that is some obvious, like compliance guidelines.

[14:13] Don't promote anything, like, don't, don't, don't why.

[14:15] That's basically all it comes down to.

[14:16] Don't lie, don't exaggerate.

[14:18] Just state the facts, deletruth, and never going to be fine.

[14:20] We actually break the collateral into two pieces.

[14:22] So basically, we have, this is what we're starting with.

[14:25] Then as time goes on, we say, hey, here are the winners.

[14:28] And so that means either new ads that we're doing, or we can at least take, here's all

[14:32] the stuff that we're starting with, and then here's the stuff that's really converting.

[14:35] And then that way the affiliates can double down on what's working.

[14:37] And then you use your data to win for their audience.

[14:40] And then if you're like, well, what's the regular communication?

[14:42] Well, there's two components to the communication.

[14:44] One is cool stuff, right?

[14:46] Which is, here's the need stuff.

[14:48] Here's the data, all that jazz, right?

[14:50] That's the, that's kind of thing one that we announced.

[14:52] The next is we have the leaderboard, which you absolutely need to send out as frequently as

[14:57] possible.

[14:58] Because believe or not, people want to check that thing daily.

[15:00] Anybody who's actually competing wants to know, you know, where they're at, right?

[15:03] They want to know if they're doing okay.

[15:05] And so this gives them that way of giving a feedback loop of you're doing a good job,

[15:08] keep doing what you're doing.

[15:09] And then as people move up the leaderboard, typically my director of my team will actually

[15:14] talk to the top ones as they kind of move up and filter the board so that we can help them

[15:18] do even more.

[15:19] So it's like kind of almost an additional, unstated incentive is that if you crush it,

[15:23] we want to help you crush it even more.

[15:24] So one of the really important things that we, that we like to think of is who are

[15:28] quote affiliates.

[15:29] Because affiliates, it like, there's different words and different industries for the same

[15:32] thing.

[15:33] Anybody who promotes your stuff is a promoter.

[15:37] Now, some people like in the physical products were they call them influence advertising.

[15:42] If it's customer driven, then it's UGC.

[15:45] It's user-generated content.

[15:46] If it's in the kind of direct response world, they call them affiliates.

[15:50] What the hell?

[15:51] And the brick and mortar world, they just call them referrals.

[15:54] And the finance world that comes centers of influence, COIs, and other places that

[15:59] come joint ventures.

[16:00] It's like the number of names for the exact same thing is exhausting.

[16:04] But all they fundamentally are people who tell other people about your stuff for some reason,

[16:08] money, free stuff, or just because they love the product.

[16:10] When I'm thinking through this, it's like, I want to make sure that for every type or genre,

[16:15] I can speak their language.

[16:16] I want to make posts, frame my stuff for people who have warm audiences on Instagram or

[16:21] YouTube, or that in terms of how they're communicating in a specific way so they can use it.

[16:27] If you're somebody who has an email list in your book where text based in for you've

[16:30] got a sub stack, you've got an extra on LinkedIn, you do more blog style stuff.

[16:35] It's like that I want to make sure that I can set you up.

[16:37] If you're somebody who's just a really good advertiser, some guys just, it's funny because

[16:40] last year, some of the top guys were just, they didn't even have any of this stuff.

[16:44] They're just like, oh, I'll just take the ads.

[16:46] I'll run them.

[16:47] I know I can just make my way into the top 50.

[16:48] It's exactly what they did.

[16:50] It's like, I want to make sure that those guys are taking care of by giving them the ads that

[16:53] I know that are working, that are pre-approved enough to have zero friction.

[16:56] You just take them, run them.

[16:58] As you're building this for your business, it's like you want to make sure that you're

[17:00] taken care of every single type of feel because as soon as there's friction, they'll stop.

[17:05] And so it's like you want to make it easy, you want to make it fast, and you want to

[17:08] make it personalized to them.

[17:10] If you want to sell something, using other people's audience, which is free with the

[17:15] caveat that you give them some strong incentive to do so, then the first thing that we

[17:19] start with is why the hell should they do this, which is you have to make the offer for

[17:25] the affiliates.

[17:26] And you want to make the offer beneficial for you, beneficial for them, and beneficial for

[17:29] their audience, so that it doesn't feel like an ask from them to their people because

[17:33] you don't want to take away from them.

[17:34] The next is, okay, once you build that offer, it's like, how do you, how are you going

[17:38] to tell people about it?

[17:39] Well, you got to have some place that exists.

[17:41] You have some sound of promotion, and then you have some sort of follow up.

[17:44] All right?

[17:45] And so the place that exists, I like having an affiliate sales page in influencer sales page,

[17:49] a partner page, a center of influence page, a JV page, whatever you want to say or call

[17:54] it.

[17:55] Other people know, you sell them on why it's a good idea for them to do it.

[17:58] Now beyond that, it's like, okay, now we got to let people know about this thing.

[18:01] So for me, I use the same ones.

[18:02] I use my outreach, which is talking to people already, know me.

[18:06] I make my posts for content like this video, and I'm going to be running ads, which I'm

[18:10] actually just flowing through our existing funnel that's going to be to preorder and

[18:13] register for the book.

[18:14] All of that then ends up here so that it spins the loop of getting other people to

[18:17] ideally, and hopefully promote the book.

[18:19] It's going to be awesome, just totally do it.

[18:21] Once we have that, we can't just leave them to flounder.

[18:23] We have to make sure that they actually succeed.

[18:25] And so we have onboarding an activation with fast feedback groups, they immediately get their

[18:29] custom link, they know it's going to work, they see regular leader boards, so that they

[18:33] know that they're moving up with it, they're doing well.

[18:36] And then beyond having the feedback group, we want to give them the stuff, right?

[18:39] We want to give them regular communication, which is going to be the data and the cool stuff

[18:43] that's happening behind them seeing plus the leader board, obviously.

[18:45] And then the winners is going to be like the ads or the posts or the angles or hooks that

[18:50] are outperforming.

[18:51] So by doing this, we set as many people up as seemingly possible for success, and that

[18:56] at the very top end for the people who are in that top hundred or top fifty, my team

[19:00] actually reaches out to them and says, hey, how can we help you promote it and crush

[19:03] it even more?

[19:04] We want you to win because of you win and your audience wins, we all win.

[19:06] And so fundamentally, that's how you advertise the free.

[19:09] It's also one of the most scalable ways to advertise in any niche.

[19:12] It's been one of the core pillars of our advertising.

[19:16] I mean, like school, the majority of the traffic is from people telling people about it.

[19:20] I mean, I don't know what I'm telling, it's almost entirely my software company that we

[19:23] sold.

[19:24] It's almost entirely off of fillets.

[19:25] First of all, it's almost 100% of fillet sales, meaning the brick and mortar, distributors

[19:28] who are actually selling the stuff at their brick and mortars.

[19:31] And so it doesn't matter also whether the people who, like for example, for me, it's like,

[19:35] I probably do have some gym owners who have a hundred members at their gym.

[19:39] Will they win the top fifty?

[19:41] Probably not.

[19:42] Can they make sure that they get all the ten plus and get a shot at getting in?

[19:46] Absolutely.

[19:47] I want to make sure that somebody at the bottom and at the top can still win.

[19:51] And if you follow this stuff, you'll probably do pretty good.

[19:54] And if you want more details about this, I have a monster chapter on a fillet, which

[19:59] I actually had to cut in half to even fit in the book, because there's so much stuff

[20:02] to really do it right.

[20:03] That's inside of the leads book in the affiliates chapter.

[20:06] You can go check that out.

[20:08] With that being said, if you aren't affiliate, you can click this link and you can

[20:11] become one, or if you just want to send your friends, just want to send your employees,

[20:15] just want to send your gym, you want to send your pickle ball buddies, you want to send

[20:19] human beings who like business to the event.

[20:22] I would love to give you free stuff to do it, because I'd rather help you out rather

[20:25] than give a king's ransom to the social media platforms.

[20:29] So maybe that's our way of being in the other.

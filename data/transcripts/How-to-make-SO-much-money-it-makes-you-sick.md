[00:00] My goal here is to make you guys as much money as you can possibly.

[00:02] If you're a lazy month, you better have a total average.

[00:06] Now you have a $300 million dollar, you're exit, rather than a $25 million dollar.

[00:09] It's like that sounds better. Here's the crazy.

[00:11] You can't actually buy the company.

[00:12] You just added $10 million to his net worth.

[00:15] So we're going to start with a little exercise.

[00:17] I'm going to call it the magic wand.

[00:18] All right.

[00:19] So right now, if I have a magic wand or you have a magic wand,

[00:23] you wave it and you get to make as much money as you want.

[00:26] All right.

[00:27] So write down or put at least think about it in your head.

[00:30] What number that would be per month?

[00:32] Okay?

[00:33] How much money are you making per month?

[00:36] Okay.

[00:37] Hopefully it doesn't take too long to think of a number.

[00:40] Now, who here currently is making that amount of money?

[00:44] Please raise your head.

[00:46] Wonderful.

[00:47] So we have just done a step of the gap between where you are

[00:49] and where you'd like to go.

[00:50] Fantastic.

[00:51] So here's you.

[00:54] Here's goal.

[00:57] We all just established.

[00:59] Now, in scenario one, you have these goals, right?

[01:07] And there's all of these different ways of getting there, right?

[01:12] And the problem is you're like which one do I do?

[01:16] Before I explain more on that, scenario two is I don't know what to do

[01:22] to get to there.

[01:23] Let me tell you how these feel.

[01:26] This one feels like anxiety.

[01:29] So if you feel stressed or you weren't overwhelmed

[01:32] about which thing you should do, that's this.

[01:42] If you don't know what to do, you're at a loss.

[01:46] You feel hopeless.

[01:48] Because you're like, I don't know the fuck to do.

[01:50] Like I don't know.

[01:50] I don't know what to do.

[01:51] And it's not about picking.

[01:53] It's like you don't even know where to start.

[01:55] And this has been really important for me to identify

[01:59] if I feel anxiety, it's because I don't know which thing to pick.

[02:02] If I'm feeling sad, it's because I feel hopeless.

[02:05] I'm like, okay, hopelessness means I have a lack of choices.

[02:07] So I have a lack of choices means I have ignorance around this topic.

[02:10] Okay, this makes it solvable.

[02:12] So then I can start solving for I need a path

[02:15] so that I know what to do.

[02:17] It's the only thing I know me personally.

[02:18] That's what makes me sad.

[02:19] I don't know what to do.

[02:20] I get sad.

[02:22] Is this resonating with anyone here?

[02:24] Okay.

[02:25] So when you're deciding which thing to do,

[02:28] this is a clear case of lack of strategy.

[02:32] All right.

[02:33] Now, strategies a big fluffy, amorphous word

[02:37] that gets tossed around a lot and no notes of the fucking means,

[02:40] but it's probably important.

[02:42] And in my opinion is the most important.

[02:44] But I'm going to give you a different definition for this

[02:47] to make it a little bit more useful.

[02:48] Okay.

[02:51] Strategy is just prioritizing.

[02:55] It's all this.

[02:55] Like whenever you hear someone say,

[02:56] we have to figure out our strategy.

[02:58] It just means we have to figure out our priorities.

[02:59] It's all means.

[03:00] And in layman's terms,

[03:02] it's what's going to get us the most bang for the buck.

[03:06] If you want the fancy definition that I have,

[03:08] it's how you choose to allocate resources

[03:11] that are limited against unlimited options.

[03:15] That is strategy.

[03:17] And the tough part about this, about strategy in general,

[03:20] is that when you're looking here, you have all these options.

[03:27] Strategy is figuring out, actually,

[03:29] there's one that's right here that takes us off the page.

[03:34] Because the most costly thing in business

[03:35] isn't just the unknowns, but it's the unknown unknowns.

[03:38] As in the things that you didn't even know, you could pick from.

[03:40] I show this to say that right now, if my goal here

[03:43] is to make you guys as much money as soonly possible

[03:45] at the time I am done my 46 minutes,

[03:50] then if I can just get you to make the one chess move

[03:53] that will make you the most money,

[03:54] then it will ROI everything you do this year

[03:56] or maybe the next five years.

[03:58] Because fundamentally, people don't actually move

[04:00] faster than other people.

[04:02] Like you see me walk, it's not like I'm hyperactive.

[04:05] It's just you get more for each step

[04:07] when you are more strategic.

[04:09] When you have better priorities

[04:11] and you allocate your resources, time money energy,

[04:15] into the fewest moves that get you the most bang for the buck,

[04:18] you make the most money.

[04:21] So, back to this.

[04:23] You guys want to hear a different example?

[04:27] So, we have a PR company that we bought.

[04:31] We dove into the data and it looked like 85%

[04:34] of the businesses turned out within two or three months,

[04:37] which is horrendous.

[04:39] 15% of the customers paid the most and stayed the longest

[04:43] and they were different.

[04:44] I was like, wow that did.

[04:47] What if we stop selling these 85%

[04:49] and only sell these 15 and cater our stuff to only them?

[04:53] And he was like, that would kill my business.

[04:55] Mind you, recurring theme of the first one,

[04:57] when I told him to shut his agency down,

[04:59] he had to go to zero and then built the next thing.

[05:02] And for nine months, he was basically at zeroish.

[05:06] Hard.

[05:07] Like tough, very simple to say, very hard to do.

[05:09] Good, you guys imagine if two locations

[05:11] I was like, hey, I can have to get there

[05:13] for a year, you're going to have to make no money.

[05:14] Cool?

[05:16] What do you do?

[05:18] Play along it, right?

[05:19] And he was willing to do that.

[05:20] And that was me talking to him off the cliff

[05:21] every week and like, hey man, we're going to get there.

[05:24] And so with this individual with the PR,

[05:29] we cut 85%, we catered the messaging

[05:32] and we made it way more niche down to this specific avatar

[05:35] and we ten X the price.

[05:37] And now we sell more units than we did before.

[05:40] We ten X the company.

[05:42] Strategy, rather than thinking, OK, what am I going to do

[05:45] to just get more?

[05:46] Now, there's always a time for more.

[05:48] Believe me, violence is the answer.

[05:49] Big fan.

[05:49] A brutal, relentless effort.

[05:52] But we want to make sure that we're capturing

[05:54] the most per unit of effort.

[05:56] And so the equation for this is volume times leverage equals

[06:07] output, which means the more times you do something

[06:09] and the more you get for each time you do it,

[06:12] the more you get ultimately.

[06:13] Now, if you're a lazy motherfucker, guess what?

[06:17] You better have a shitload of leverage.

[06:19] Now, you can be lazy and still make tons of money.

[06:22] You just have to have lots of leverage.

[06:23] You got to be really strategic in the moves you make.

[06:26] The more activity you have, the more you can let a little

[06:28] bit of that violence work for you.

[06:32] But it ends up becoming a cap soon enough.

[06:35] Because at the end of the day, we only have X amount of hours.

[06:38] And if you want to do a big shit, you

[06:39] need a lot of other people's hours to work for you,

[06:41] which is a form of leverage.

[06:43] I'll give you a third one.

[06:44] So we had a company that is an association

[06:48] of trying to keep it big.

[06:51] Let's call dentists.

[06:52] Association of dentists.

[06:54] They had a business that like they glob all the savings together

[06:58] of all the dentists so that they would charge less

[07:01] than all of them saved with the conglomerate of buying power.

[07:05] So if you save $30,000 a year as a dentist,

[07:07] they would charge 10 super sticky model, great business.

[07:10] And so I think I could sell this thing for 20 or $30 million.

[07:14] And I was like, how many dentists you have there?

[07:18] It's like, I don't know, 500.

[07:20] And they all run the same systems.

[07:22] I was like, yeah.

[07:24] It's like, what's the average dentist make per unit?

[07:27] It's like, 500,000?

[07:29] I was like, wild idea.

[07:33] What if we take 10 every year on the llama

[07:38] and sell them for 100 million every year?

[07:43] Get 20%, give 80% to them.

[07:45] I'd be chill, right?

[07:46] I was like, then you get your exit every single year.

[07:48] And then if you want to sell it,

[07:50] we exit the machine that does roll-ups.

[07:53] Because in that, you have roll-up machine

[07:55] that does 20 or 30 million year in profit.

[07:57] And we get 10x on that.

[07:58] Now you have a $300 million dollar exit rather than a $25 million

[08:01] dollar year.

[08:01] And you're like, that sounds better.

[08:02] I'm with you.

[08:03] I agree.

[08:04] Strategy.

[08:06] Prioritizing.

[08:07] What move will get me the most for the effort I put in?

[08:11] All right.

[08:12] Now, this is a perfect transition to you're like, okay,

[08:15] that sounds very fine this guy.

[08:17] So, next TikTok.

[08:21] Thear of constraint.

[08:23] So everything that we do at acquisition.com

[08:25] and the approach that we have with growing any business

[08:27] is spending a lot of effort to try

[08:29] and identify the constraint of the business.

[08:31] Because every single business is constraint.

[08:32] There's one thing that is limiting its growth.

[08:35] So right now, and here's the fucked up part.

[08:38] Many of who here works all the hours of the day,

[08:41] like most of the hours of your awake.

[08:43] Okay, half of you.

[08:45] If your business is not growing as fast as you want it to,

[08:49] you are working on the wrong stuff.

[08:55] If it has stayed the same and you were spending all your time

[08:57] working on it, you're not going to get more

[09:00] hours.

[09:02] So you're doing the wrong shit.

[09:04] So it means that you have not properly identified

[09:07] the constraint of the business.

[09:09] So I'll give you an example of this.

[09:12] We had a media company that came to us.

[09:14] Big YouTubers, 40 million plus subscribers,

[09:16] and they were like, hey, I was like, what's the goal?

[09:18] They're like, we want to make money.

[09:19] I like, cool, love it, great goal.

[09:22] So they're like, we think that we need to create

[09:27] a better media machine.

[09:28] Okay, we need to really systematize this

[09:31] and do it better.

[09:33] It's like, how are you monetizing?

[09:35] Ad sense.

[09:36] By the way, very inefficient way to monetize.

[09:39] Okay.

[09:40] And so they're like, I think these are all the things

[09:43] that we need to do to eliminate our constraint

[09:45] for our production.

[09:46] Cool.

[09:48] It's like, have you thought of?

[09:50] Well, all idea.

[09:52] Maybe we just like, the constraint of the business

[09:54] is that you don't have something to sell.

[09:56] I was like, you're like a 97 out of 100 on media,

[09:59] and you're a zero out of 100 on shit to sell.

[10:03] And you're trying to talk about how to get to a 99,

[10:05] rather than like, if we just went from zero to 20,

[10:08] we would probably make you 10 times more money

[10:10] than you're currently making.

[10:12] And so that is an idea of the theory of the constraint,

[10:15] like the constraint of that business was not media.

[10:17] And many of you, the constraint of your business

[10:19] is not making better fucking workouts.

[10:23] That's not the constraint.

[10:25] That's not the constraint.

[10:27] That's not the constraint.

[10:28] And so right now, if you spend all your day working on shit,

[10:30] that doesn't move the ball, working on the wrong shit.

[10:35] So let me tell you how we do it, so that hopefully you can too.

[10:41] So one of the questions I like to ask is,

[10:42] why can't we 10x this business?

[10:45] Like, why can't we?

[10:47] And sometimes I'm asking that question,

[10:48] and then it becomes really apparent what the problem is.

[10:51] And the answer is sometimes,

[10:53] well, we just need to hire all these people.

[10:54] It's like, well, let's fucking do that, right?

[10:57] And so here's how we transition into the tactics

[11:03] around this.

[11:13] So this is the actual first part of my planning process,

[11:18] prioritizing process, strategy process, whatever shoe

[11:21] fits you.

[11:22] For figuring out what we're going to do with a company

[11:24] that we're going to grow.

[11:25] So when we're thinking about all the objectives,

[11:28] all the things we could potentially do,

[11:30] it has to map to one of these three objectives,

[11:34] which is, what?

[11:36] How is this thing that we're going to spend time

[11:37] on money effort on?

[11:38] Going to get us more customers?

[11:41] Two, how is this thing going to spend time money

[11:44] and effort on?

[11:45] Get us increased LTGP, make them worth more.

[11:48] Or three, how is the time energy, et cetera,

[11:52] going to decrease the risk that this does not continue

[11:55] to happen in the future, which is another way of translating

[11:58] how do we increase the enterprise value overall?

[12:00] So for example, if you do all of this stuff,

[12:04] that's great.

[12:05] Still really risky, because if you die, the business dies.

[12:09] Now, if we have to hire someone to do the same thing as you,

[12:12] is it going to get more of either of these probably not?

[12:15] Will it make the thing more valuable?

[12:16] Absolutely.

[12:18] Does that make sense?

[12:19] So I'm going to segue briefly.

[12:22] We're going to side-quest.

[12:24] Imagine two people, five million top line,

[12:28] five million top line, two million, bottom line,

[12:31] two million, bottom line.

[12:33] This guy is a single owner, runs every all the day to day,

[12:38] has lots of minions, known with real brains,

[12:40] and they just do what he says.

[12:42] OK, if this person dies, the business dies.

[12:46] This guy has a team that runs the whole thing,

[12:50] and he makes $2 million, and he

[12:51] can come from the business, but it doesn't require him.

[12:56] Who's richer?

[12:58] This guy, question is how much richer?

[13:01] A lot.

[13:02] This guy, because he doesn't have to do anything,

[13:04] means that somebody else could also not have to do anything,

[13:06] and also collect that $2 million a year, which means

[13:08] his thing is probably worth depending on what type of

[13:10] industry it's in, 10, 15, sometimes $20 million.

[13:14] And so when this guy, here's where the leverage comes in,

[13:17] big El, if you go from $2 million a year to $3 million a year

[13:21] in income, he just added $10 million to his net worth.

[13:25] This guy is concerned about all of the tax evasion strategies,

[13:27] because he's trying to maximize his income,

[13:29] and forgetting the fact that the asset is the thing

[13:31] that's going to build his net worth.

[13:33] This took me a really long time to learn.

[13:36] Like an absurdly long time.

[13:37] Everything I did was all about how do I take the income I

[13:39] have, be more efficient with it, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[13:42] When it's really like you become wealthy from the shit you own,

[13:44] not the shit you do.

[13:48] So everybody here has a business.

[13:50] And right now, many of the businesses in this room are not

[13:52] valuable, known with Biden, because it's really just you

[13:56] with some helpers.

[13:58] And so the idea is that we have to transition,

[14:00] and this is a skill that is worth getting,

[14:01] because no matter what you do for the rest of your entrepreneur

[14:03] career, you're going to need people.

[14:05] You need to have the skill of hiring recruiting, training

[14:07] onboarding, managing talent.

[14:10] Who here has one amazing superstar, a person who works for you?

[14:15] Cool.

[14:16] Imagine if you had four of them at your one location.

[14:19] How easy would life be?

[14:21] Right?

[14:22] You make a ton of money.

[14:23] Here's what's fucking crazy.

[14:25] The difference is small businesses, and big businesses,

[14:28] is how many players they have.

[14:31] And so what happens is, most small business owners

[14:34] hire a lot of people, get lucky, one sticks,

[14:37] actually works their ass off at a fair rate,

[14:40] and you're like, oh, man, if I had six more

[14:41] sandrists, right?

[14:43] I'd be good to go.

[14:44] The thing is, is that big business owners

[14:47] maintain a higher level where a lower tolerance for mediocrity.

[14:54] And so they actually do keep looking

[14:56] until they find six sandrists, and then it does become too

[14:58] easy for them to kill it.

[15:00] Because I got six sandrists, how can I lose?

[15:03] That's the idea.

[15:04] Make sense?

[15:05] OK.

[15:06] This took me a long time to learn.

[15:08] Like I would just put up with people who are mediocre.

[15:10] And right now, many of you have a think of somebody who's

[15:13] mediocre on your team.

[15:14] Actually, I'm making it easier.

[15:15] Think about that person that you thought about today,

[15:17] who you shouldn't have thought about.

[15:18] Because if they're not making you money, you're not

[15:19] sleeping with them.

[15:20] Don't think about them first thing in the morning.

[15:21] All right.

[15:22] So anybody have somebody in mind?

[15:28] So if you have that person in mind, that person

[15:31] is taking up 25% of your bandwidth.

[15:34] What a cost.

[15:36] Right?

[15:37] And probably many of you, the biggest lever of growth

[15:40] is on the other side of a few hard conversations.

[15:45] I now talk to portfolio CEOs all the time.

[15:48] And it is incredibly clear that people who will win

[15:52] and that people who will not is simply based on their ability

[15:54] to confront discomfort.

[15:56] And it's interesting because it's a mostly, eh,

[15:59] it's kind of 50, 50, actually, audits.

[16:01] Between male and female.

[16:02] But a lot of guys beat their chest.

[16:06] I can cold-plunge.

[16:07] I can run a long time without stopping.

[16:10] Ooh, lift lots of weight.

[16:12] But you can't just say, hey, man, I think you suck a little

[16:15] bit.

[16:18] Real?

[16:19] Can't do it.

[16:20] And for that reason, they suffer for fucking decades

[16:23] because they can't fire Sarah.

[16:26] Not Sandra.

[16:27] Sandra is stud.

[16:28] Right?

[16:29] Can't fire Sarah.

[16:30] It's like, yeah, no, she's left with one of the clients.

[16:32] But like, I mean, I think her hearts in the right place.

[16:34] It's like, whenever you're, whenever you're qualifying

[16:37] that someone's hearts in the right place

[16:38] and deep down their good person,

[16:40] it's because it's obvious that they suck.

[16:41] Right?

[16:42] Right?

[16:43] Right?

[16:44] Right?

[16:45] Right?

[16:46] Right?

[16:47] Right?

[16:48] Right?

[16:49] Right?

[16:50] Right?

[16:51] Right?

[16:52] Right?

[16:53] Right?

[16:54] Right?

[16:55] Right?

[16:56] Right?

[16:57] Right down the name of the person that you know you need to get back to

[17:01] and start what we call a performance improvement plan.

[17:04] Which is you got 14 days to fix your shit or get out.

[17:08] And many of you can't even have the conversation

[17:10] because you're too much of a fucking pansy.

[17:14] Real talk.

[17:16] And this will keep you poor.

[17:19] Seriously.

[17:20] Like, you got to grow up.

[17:23] Got to be able to have hard conversations.

[17:25] Like, hey, my biggest, my biggest piece of advice for this

[17:30] is you know the shit you say about Sarah

[17:33] while you're here behind Sarah's back?

[17:36] God, she's just like she's been slipping lately.

[17:38] You know what I mean?

[17:38] She's not sure about one time.

[17:40] She's not clean up after the class is.

[17:41] She's short with the clients.

[17:43] I do people complain about her.

[17:45] Right?

[17:46] Say that to her.

[17:48] That's it.

[17:49] Just think about what you'd shit talk

[17:50] and just say it to them.

[17:53] It's just the truth.

[17:54] Just say it to them.

[17:55] See what happens?

[17:57] One of two things.

[17:58] Either they're like fuck, I've had my head up my ass.

[18:00] That's why I've been so dark.

[18:01] Um, right?

[18:03] Right?

[18:05] You're totally right.

[18:06] Thank you.

[18:07] Pull it out.

[18:08] Right?

[18:09] And all of a sudden they have a total 180.

[18:11] That happens like one out of five times.

[18:14] Four out of five times.

[18:16] You say these are the things that you have to do.

[18:17] They either say I won't do that or they say sure I'll try.

[18:21] And we both know they're not going to.

[18:22] And then you elegantly exit them from the business.

[18:25] The problem is that right now Sarah teaches like six classes.

[18:29] Lock.

[18:31] Now what?

[18:35] Gotta find somebody else.

[18:39] She's killing your business.

[18:41] So get rid of Sarah.

[18:42] All right?

[18:43] So that was a side quest but hopefully we found some treasure there.

[18:45] And right the name of the person need to have that hard conversation with.

[18:48] I'd be like, there's this fucking speech in this guy.

[18:51] I was talking shit about you and I should have talked to your face.

[18:53] And so this is me talking shit to your face so that I feel better about it.

[18:57] You kind of suck.

[18:59] Okay.

[19:00] Thank you.

[19:02] So right now there's a lot of shit that you guys probably learned so far.

[19:18] You're going to learn tomorrow and the rest of the day, et cetera.

[19:21] If it doesn't do one of these three things, toss it.

[19:25] Number one.

[19:27] Number two, you might only be able to do one of them or two of them.

[19:31] And so then you got to pick, okay, of all of these things, which of these has the highest

[19:37] likelihood of working with the least amount of effort.

[19:40] You do that one first.

[19:43] And as silly as this sounds, many of you won't do this.

[19:47] And the reason I say this is because I talked to people who were making a million a month,

[19:51] a million a week and they sometimes forget to.

[19:54] So like when you have the same conversation over and over again, you start to develop frameworks

[19:59] around it.

[20:00] All right.

[20:01] And the first framework that I wanted to give you around strategy is how does this get us

[20:04] more customers?

[20:05] How does this make them worth more?

[20:07] And how does this increase the likelihood that those two first things don't stop happening?

[20:11] If it doesn't map to that, forget about it.

[20:13] Just cut it.

[20:14] Because there are other things that will do that that we should be doing instead.

[20:19] Cool.

[20:20] Now, the second framework is going to go one level down.

[20:33] What do you have?

[20:35] So usually when you do this whole thing, you get a big list of what's.

[20:40] These are all the things I got to do.

[20:41] What?

[20:42] What?

[20:43] You're like fucked.

[20:44] There's a lot of what's.

[20:46] Who's going to do it?

[20:48] Well, I'm like me.

[20:52] The difference between the guys who become bigger business owners and the ones who don't

[20:56] is they have to think how can I get my team to do this for me?

[20:59] Now, this is not a team team talk.

[21:02] But I am telling you that the reason that Jim launch went from 3 million year or whatever

[21:06] it was to 37 and still cranks was because of Leila.

[21:12] Because I was like, we're going to make it the Alex show.

[21:15] She's like, that's a terrible idea.

[21:18] And so she built a team and started empowering the team.

[21:21] She's like, you can't do that.

[21:22] She started taking things off my counter.

[21:23] I was like, hey, I like that.

[21:24] She's like, no, not for you.

[21:26] That's for Sandra.

[21:28] Look, I got six Andrews.

[21:29] They all want to work.

[21:31] And so what ended up happening is, has anyone given a task to someone on your team?

[21:37] And they actually just did a great job with it and you're like, oh, thank God.

[21:41] That was awesome.

[21:41] Anyone have that happened?

[21:43] OK.

[21:44] So big businesses do that all the time.

[21:49] And you just do it lots of Sandra's.

[21:51] And if you can't give shit to any Sandra's, then you're the problem.

[21:56] Because you have really low standards.

[21:58] And you're pushing.

[22:01] You can't have hard combos.

[22:03] That's what it is.

[22:03] Like literally it comes down to that big monster guys.

[22:06] Can't tell the female trainer that she sucks.

[22:10] Kid do it.

[22:12] We can't do it.

[22:15] And so what happens is we have this big list of watts.

[22:18] And then we put Santana on the first two.

[22:21] They're like, man, it'd be cool if we could do some of these other ones.

[22:25] Who should we give it to?

[22:27] And then we start assigning the hooves.

[22:29] But here's a fun trick.

[22:30] If you've given the same thing, 12 weeks in a row, like each quarter, and the what's

[22:37] not done, the who's the problem.

[22:41] Winners win.

[22:43] And I'm sure that the best people that you have on your team hit the ground running.

[22:46] Sorry, it's taking shit off your plate of meaty lees, start executing everybody love

[22:49] them.

[22:50] Remember what that felt like?

[22:52] That blueprint is what talent looks like.

[22:55] And you just have to do more of that.

[22:57] Get more of those people.

[22:59] Which then opens up the next thing, which is, I'm not the type of leader, who will

[23:03] track that type of talent.

[23:07] I don't have time to get into fixing you right now.

[23:09] But that is what the next thing that happens is.

[23:12] OK, fantastic.

[23:13] So, tick.gov over for this strategy session.

[23:17] Go to the next one.

[23:20] All right.

[23:21] I'll get them great impression on the time.

[23:23] Next, very much for you.

[23:40] More better, no.

[23:42] So as soon as we figure out that we have the highest strategic leverage activity that we

[23:48] can in a business, we then are our ourselves, can we just do more?

[23:55] Why can't we do more?

[23:57] I want to do more.

[23:58] More money.

[23:59] Let's do that.

[24:00] More more.

[24:01] Or we say, can we do it better?

[24:04] We don't have to invest any resources.

[24:06] Just do it better.

[24:07] We're going to go from calling leads in 30 minutes to calling leads in

[24:09] under five.

[24:11] Deal?

[24:12] Fantastic.

[24:14] Once we do all the more is and all the better, then and only then do we do new.

[24:18] Now, here's how, most small business owners decide what they're going to do.

[24:24] Oh, there we go.

[24:25] All right.

[24:26] Now, the thing is, as a lot of you guys are going to come back from here with lots of

[24:43] new.

[24:44] You're going to be like, hey, team, I'm going to vomit all over you.

[24:46] I'm going to make no plan.

[24:47] It's going to be awesome and they're just going to be like, let's give it a week.

[24:49] I'll forget about all the things he said.

[24:51] And we'll go back to normal.

[24:52] Real talk.

[24:53] It's going to happen.

[24:56] Jim launch since we sold it to whatever it was, it's years ago, whatever the time was.

[25:03] 2020 won.

[25:05] I'm so proud of Kale and the team because they consistently asked, thank you.

[25:12] How can we do more of what we're doing?

[25:14] How can we do it better?

[25:15] Jim launch has gone 40% since Alex and Leila exited the majority share.

[25:20] We still own 30% percent of it.

[25:22] And I think in a lot of ways, Kale is a better CEO than I am because I also like new

[25:27] shiny things too.

[25:29] But Kale is super disciplined.

[25:30] He's an exceptional CEO.

[25:31] There's lots of learn from him.

[25:34] How can I do more?

[25:35] How can I do it better?

[25:36] So it's like, hey, dude, I think we should be getting on TikTok.

[25:38] He's like, you know, we couldn't also do.

[25:40] If I can double our Cole call team.

[25:41] Do that.

[25:42] What do we do that?

[25:43] What's the likelihood that if we double our Cole call team, we'll make more sales.

[25:46] Hi.

[25:49] We already have a Trot and Path there.

[25:50] Let's just do more of that.

[25:51] But what about TikTok?

[25:52] It's like, Jim, likely that we're going to get sales.

[25:56] I don't know.

[25:57] We've never done it before.

[25:58] I don't know.

[25:59] But what about this kid?

[26:00] I saw in the internet he's making millions.

[26:03] Let's just double our Cole call team.

[26:05] And then let's look at our better and say, like, do you think we can clean the numbers

[26:10] more?

[26:11] Do you think we can improve the script?

[26:13] Do you think we can follow up faster?

[26:15] Do you think we can personalize the reach outs more?

[26:17] Probably.

[26:19] And so right now, this is real real.

[26:25] The thing that is killing most of you guys is the desire to 10x in 90 days.

[26:32] And then not doing it and trying something new and hoping for a silver bullet that never

[26:35] comes.

[26:37] It's just 100 Golden Babies.

[26:40] The big businesses, it's just Golden Babies.

[26:42] It's just improving lots of little things over and over again.

[26:45] There's a 40% improvement that Jim Wiches had since we sold our majority share has there's

[26:49] been no one thing.

[26:50] And man wouldn't I love to make that short video.

[26:53] There isn't one thing.

[26:54] We just improved a lot of little things.

[26:57] And that creates the big outcome.

[26:59] And so right now, you probably have this big list of should-dos.

[27:07] Like I should do that.

[27:09] I should probably email my list sometime.

[27:11] Right?

[27:12] That's some point.

[27:13] I should do that.

[27:14] I should probably do more cold DMs or do more reachouts.

[27:19] I should probably make more ads to run.

[27:22] I should probably do that.

[27:24] I should probably figure out our pricing and optimize it.

[27:27] I should probably create that sales training program or get my team to go through that

[27:30] sales training program.

[27:30] I should probably set up a role-playing cadence for my team so they sell better.

[27:39] But you know what's new?

[27:42] That sounds cool.

[27:44] The should-dos, if you actually just wrote all the things that you need to do down and

[27:50] then you tick them off and you realize that it takes two years to build an exceptional business

[27:54] and you did nothing but just actually do all the shit you know you should be doing,

[27:57] usually build a pretty exceptional business.

[28:01] It's the rush that kills everyone.

[28:03] It's the hope that this new thing is somehow going to shortcut the work that needs to

[28:07] be done.

[28:09] And like this has just been true and true because the thing is is that that list for a $10

[28:12] million company is longer and bigger.

[28:15] That list for a $100 million company is longer and bigger.

[28:19] And it's just shit that needs to get done.

[28:21] And so the faster you can confront the work that has to get done, the faster you start

[28:25] getting to getting to the getting.

[28:27] There you go.

[28:28] This is making sense.

[28:29] All right.

[28:30] Thanks, man.

[28:31] Appreciate it.

[28:32] All right.

[28:33] Now, you're going to have a lot of different things.

[28:43] You have a lot of different things that they could do.

[28:48] Right.

[28:49] And you've noticed this is the central theme.

[28:50] It's like you've got a lot of decisions to make and I just want you to make the right

[28:54] one.

[28:55] I want you to make the one that makes the most bang for the buck.

[28:57] And an easy way to order this is impact.

[29:02] Ease.

[29:06] There you go.

[29:10] So when you have your big list of shit, just put it as one, two, three, four.

[29:18] Just put a number next to it.

[29:20] Really easy.

[29:23] Lots of impact.

[29:24] Really easy.

[29:26] Do these first.

[29:29] Then once you've done all of those.

[29:32] Hey, don't consume any more information.

[29:35] Once you've done leap, I've, once you do all of these.

[29:40] Then start working on these.

[29:44] Then start working on these.

[29:46] Then fuck these.

[29:49] I really want to rebrand the logo.

[29:53] Why?

[29:55] No one knows that you exist to be in with.

[29:56] What are we talking about?

[29:59] You're like, I want to rebrand.

[30:00] It's like, what?

[30:01] You have a name list of, no one has any association with your first thing.

[30:05] Like Xerox is just made up letters.

[30:08] Right?

[30:09] The brand, because branding is the consistent action of associating the unknown with the

[30:13] known.

[30:15] I know it's what's to talk about social media branding.

[30:17] I didn't think it was going to be super important for you guys because you don't need

[30:21] to.

[30:22] For now, in my opinion.

[30:24] Not because it wouldn't benefit you, but because there are other things that I think

[30:27] would benefit you more just to be clear.

[30:30] Okay.

[30:31] Now, I'm going to give you this little, this little tie-raid.

[30:37] And then I may, I may have time, but I may not have time at the infrecurney.

[30:41] We'll see.

[30:42] So, oftentimes, the things that is limiting the business is the big obvious thing.

[30:48] So we have really big egos about our business.

[30:52] We assume that it's exceptional.

[30:53] We assume that it's excellent.

[30:56] But in your heart of hearts, you probably know that if you were actually fucking

[31:01] exceptional, you would not be asking questions about how to get more leads.

[31:07] Because you would have people referring their friends.

[31:10] And referrals, by the way, are non-linear in that they are exponential in nature

[31:14] to bring four, four, bring eight, et cetera.

[31:17] So the book, the hundred-and-a-half-offers book, was probably my first big experience

[31:22] with that because I spent like a very long time writing it.

[31:24] And then I gave away for nine and aint sense.

[31:27] And I made one post.

[31:28] And I think this one had like 20,000 Instagram followers in total.

[31:30] And I didn't have really any of the platforms.

[31:33] And that book to this day sells more copies every month than it did the month before.

[31:38] And like last month, this old 25,000 copies.

[31:40] It's like almost a thousand books a day, a thousand customers every day.

[31:45] No marketing spend.

[31:47] Just word of mouth, right?

[31:49] And 14,000, five stars.

[31:52] And so, like it's the big obvious thing.

[31:55] And from being in the room with millionaires and decabillionaires, the thing that has

[32:01] become so clear to me is that the people who are obsessed with their product are the ones

[32:07] that get the compounding.

[32:09] And so every business needs to have some sort of compounding vehicle within it.

[32:12] Otherwise, you're going to spend the rest of your life trying to promote it.

[32:15] So think about this way.

[32:17] If I spend two years trying to write a book and at the end of the two years, it's

[32:20] exceptional.

[32:21] I'm going to give the alternative example first.

[32:24] If I spend two months writing a book, and I publish it, and then I have to spend the rest

[32:28] of my life trying to promote it to get people to buy it, to tough life, low leverage.

[32:34] On the flip side, if I spent two years trying to build something fucking incredible.

[32:39] And then let my customers market it forward for the rest of my life.

[32:42] More work upfront, less work long term.

[32:46] It's just that being willing to delay satisfaction or gratification is, in my opinion, the

[32:51] single greatest skill that you can develop.

[32:53] And what's wild is that a lot of you guys think you have that skill.

[32:56] You only do when it comes to cookies.

[33:00] But not when it comes to money.

[33:03] And so you give your clients all these lectures about self-discipline and being hard and

[33:07] believing in your better self.

[33:10] But you will take actions that are in direct contradiction, that same thing.

[33:15] It's just we're switching calories for dollars, same thing.

[33:19] And so when I see a lot of the business, the gym owners, that struggle, it's just the big

[33:24] obvious thing.

[33:25] Which sucks.

[33:26] Like dude, what's the new marketing thing for like gyms and like have you tried your

[33:30] sandwiches?

[33:31] They are terrible.

[33:33] Why would you want more people to know?

[33:38] Right?

[33:39] Like it's it's real though, right?

[33:41] Like imagine I had a mediocre book which is what most people would have.

[33:44] And then I spent tons of money trying to market it.

[33:46] Why would I do that?

[33:48] It sounds ridiculous when you think about it.

[33:49] You're like, I'm just going to let everyone know I'm mediocre.

[33:52] That would suck.

[33:54] But that's when a lot of people in this room do every day.

[33:59] And so the thing is is that in my opinion, if I were to start a gym over today, I would

[34:05] consistently work on the actual product, the experience, the way people get greeted, the

[34:10] trainings for all of the teams into the world's simplest model.

[34:16] And until people were not leaving, I would not be worried about bringing more customers

[34:20] in.

[34:22] Once you get that right, then when you're pouring all this gas in, you can catch it.

[34:27] Because if you got to hold out the other side, you're constrained.

[34:31] Is the fact that people don't stay.

[34:34] And so the biggest thing that you have to solve for, because now we buy into a lot of brick

[34:37] and mortar chains, it's one of my favorites, unsurprisingly, is LTV or Lifetime Gross

[34:43] Profit or for everything.

[34:46] The guys who can spend the most money on marketing are the ones who make the most money

[34:52] from ads.

[34:54] So when you see these massive marketing companies or these massive campaigns that are out there,

[34:58] it's not because they're better at marketing.

[35:00] It's because they're LTV enables them to spend as much as you can really possible on the

[35:06] marketing.

[35:07] If you print cash on the back end, you can get silly on the front end.

[35:12] This has to sink in.

[35:14] This has to sink in.

[35:15] And I keep being repetitive about this because I continue to get the same questions whenever

[35:19] I go and it's like, what's the new marketing trick, what's the new hack?

[35:22] It's like, you have to solve the root issue.

[35:25] And it's kind of like the, it's like, it's like the gal who's like, hey, is it keto?

[35:28] Is it intermittent fasting?

[35:30] Is it, you know what, like, I'm trying to give the parallel here?

[35:32] Like that's what you sound like.

[35:34] You don't get it.

[35:36] You got to understand how to count your macros.

[35:38] It is what it is.

[35:39] Done.

[35:41] And so like in the business, it's like you have to figure out how to get the mouse trap

[35:45] to work even at its simplest level so that people actually like the thing you have.

[35:50] And I just feel like so many of the gyms that I see and I go to, it's obvious, like,

[35:56] takes five seconds to see why they're not successful.

[35:58] And the gym owner, because they're in it, can't see it because their ego, their identity

[36:03] is attached to it.

[36:05] Because you think that if your gym sucks, it means you suck.

[36:08] And that's not true.

[36:09] She have to break that.

[36:10] You should be like, oh yeah, we suck in that.

[36:11] On boarding, not existing.

[36:14] Turn for the roof.

[36:17] You should see my trainers.

[36:20] Slay the mooch other, it's terrible.

[36:23] Place absolute pig stock, right?

[36:26] So what's your plan?

[36:27] I'm going to market it.

[36:29] I'm going to market it.

[36:42] So to give a quick recap.

[36:48] And if I have time for Q&A, well, one, brand is making associations

[36:55] between things that are intangible with things that are tangible and unknown.

[36:59] So things that people like, if I hold a bunch of bricks of gold on stage or I hold a bunch

[37:04] of stacks of cash, you will make associations of money with me.

[37:08] And if you didn't know who I was, you would assume that I have something to do with

[37:10] money.

[37:11] That would be your assumption.

[37:12] That would be the association.

[37:13] If I stand next to a porn star, you would assume other things, right?

[37:18] Associations.

[37:19] And so if you want to build a brand, associate the service that you have with the intangible

[37:26] ideas you want the prospect to believe about you.

[37:28] So if you want them to think that you are clean and you are friendly and that you care

[37:32] and start there.

[37:36] That's a good question.

[37:37] If you feel sad, immediately translate that into, I do not know what to do next.

[37:43] It massively simplifies this very hard, painful experience.

[37:46] It's been really helpful for me.

[37:48] So if you feel hopeless, you don't know what to do, it means you just don't have options.

[37:53] You don't perceive that you have options.

[37:55] It's a lack of options.

[37:56] So you just have to become informed.

[37:58] So whenever I think sadness, I think ignorance.

[38:01] It's like, oh, that's solvable.

[38:02] And then I can start attacking it.

[38:06] On the flip side, if you have lots of options and you feel anxiety, it's because you

[38:10] don't know how to pick, which means you have to prioritize.

[38:12] It means you have a lack of strategy.

[38:17] Strategy is getting the most bang for the buck.

[38:19] It is allocating finite resources against infinite options.

[38:28] And some of the biggest strategic moves are outside the board.

[38:33] And that's where sometimes having gym launch, other people, etc., is helpful because you

[38:37] have outside eyes.

[38:38] So your mouth, inch below your nose, but you still need somebody else to tell you a bad

[38:43] breath.

[38:44] I heard that the other day I really liked it.

[38:49] Right now there's a constraint in your business.

[38:51] If you do not know what the constraint in your business is, you will not solve it.

[38:54] You'll continue to do this shit you have been doing and that has not been getting

[38:57] you what you want.

[38:58] So right now, unless you change the activities you do, you will not change the getting

[39:01] that you are getting.

[39:04] So if you go back, it's going to give you a different one.

[39:08] So intelligence and learning.

[39:14] This will be fun.

[39:21] So the definition of intelligence is rate of learning.

[39:26] It's a speed.

[39:27] Someone learns fast, they're smart.

[39:30] Someone learns slow, they're little slow.

[39:33] Right?

[39:34] Rate of learning.

[39:35] Okay.

[39:36] What does learning mean?

[39:39] This is how you can remember it.

[39:42] Same condition, new behavior.

[39:47] Which means the phone rings and I trained you and you answer it one way before I train

[39:55] you and then I have the same condition.

[39:57] The phone rings again and then after I trained you, you behave differently.

[40:01] You have learned.

[40:04] If you come to this event and you do things and then you leave this event and you do the same

[40:10] things, you have learned nothing.

[40:14] Which means that change in behavior is the way that you can measure intelligence.

[40:20] The speed at which you change behavior within the same conditions is your rate of learning.

[40:26] The faster you do that, the smarter you are.

[40:28] So some of y'all are, hold on, I gotta figure out the political one, dumb.

[40:38] But again, when I define words or operationalize them, it becomes a lot more under my control.

[40:42] So I'm like, man, I don't want to be stupid.

[40:44] It's like, they gotta do this thing.

[40:47] I went to this marriage seminar and they say that when my wife walks in the door, I should say something nice to it.

[40:53] Damn.

[40:55] Walks in the door.

[40:56] You went to the seminar and you're like, nice, blast.

[41:01] She's like, is that the top one or the bottom?

[41:02] I don't know.

[41:04] One of them, right?

[41:07] And so, same condition, new behavior.

[41:09] It's also a great way to teach your team, which is like, I'm going to present this condition.

[41:13] We're going to train.

[41:14] When I present this condition again, I need you to change your behavior.

[41:17] That's what learning is.

[41:19] And so everybody here, if you don't know what to do, then you're not going to be able to change your behavior,

[41:23] if you're not going to get in for an outcome.

[41:25] So, most of the success that I've had is my effort to try and boil everything down into an input

[41:36] to output a equation.

[41:39] I remember when I was studying for the GMAT back in the day, I found this

[41:44] research study that showed that the number of problems that you solved was in direct correlation

[41:48] with the score you got on the test.

[41:50] And I was like, oh yeah.

[41:53] Okay, this is a clear input output.

[41:55] Life isn't always this clean, but I was like, fantastic.

[41:59] So I did about a stack of phone books, this high.

[42:01] It had four hours a day for 16 weeks of problems.

[42:03] And then I scored above a Harvard's mid score.

[42:05] I didn't start there, but I had the graph.

[42:07] And I was like, a more problem than I do, the higher my score is.

[42:11] And by the time I got to the actual test, I was like, I've literally seen everyone in

[42:13] the results of the score and I've done all of them 100 times.

[42:15] So we can really easy.

[42:17] And so if you don't have the inputs out of the equation, which will be the last thing

[42:21] I do, because CalSmin and I talk about leads, then you're not going to get there.

[42:27] All right.

[42:28] So I'm going to give you guys a sneak peek.

[42:30] You can write it down.

[42:31] You can't take pictures.

[42:32] We're talking about it.

[42:37] There's only eight ways to get customers.

[42:41] You got warm outreach.

[42:46] You've got cold outreach.

[42:50] You got paid ads.

[42:55] You got content.

[42:59] There's only four things that you can do.

[43:02] So if you claim that you're constrained, because everything's amazing about your gym

[43:06] and your trainer's honestly going to be the other.

[43:08] The gym's really clean and people don't turn and your price to appropriately.

[43:12] And you have a really good onboarding experience and people get reached out on a regular basis

[43:16] to check in on them to show that you actually give a shit.

[43:18] You do all that stuff, right?

[43:20] And you think that your constraint is more marketing, which by the way, everyone thinks

[43:22] that's what it is.

[43:24] And if you keep thinking that, nothing changes.

[43:27] Maybe wrong.

[43:28] Anyways, let's talk about leads.

[43:30] So these are the only four things you can do.

[43:32] You can either post content, do warm reachouts, do cold reachouts or run pay debts.

[43:38] Simple.

[43:41] I like to quantify this by the rule of 100, which means you either spend 100 bucks a down

[43:47] ads.

[43:48] You do 100 cold outreach, you do 100 warm outreach or you do 100 minutes of content.

[43:51] You do it every day.

[43:53] And if you want to get their faster, do more.

[43:56] You'll also get better, because you did more.

[43:59] Just like the problems on the GMAT test.

[44:01] If you're not doing this stuff, what are you doing?

[44:06] You might be thinking about marketing or advertising.

[44:09] Maybe a strategizing planning.

[44:12] We're not doing any of it.

[44:14] And the amount that you get will be directly proportional to how much of this stuff

[44:17] you do.

[44:17] This is how you let other people know about stuff.

[44:20] That's it.

[44:20] It's all there is.

[44:21] Now,

[44:24] oh, OP is other people.

[44:27] You've got your customers who can refer you people.

[44:29] You've got affiliates who can send you people.

[44:32] You've got employees who work for you.

[44:35] And then you've got agencies.

[44:40] Those are the other four types of people who can get you the stuff.

[44:46] If you think about it, any of these four do these on your behalf.

[44:52] This, by the way, is leverage.

[44:55] If I can go get my customers to tell everybody about my book,

[44:58] then I won't have to.

[45:00] If I can get affiliates, all the copyright

[45:03] replaces in five maredias from my gym and all the massage

[45:06] duties in a five maredia race from my gym,

[45:09] to just give a free month with any new customer they have,

[45:13] because they know that I will treat them right.

[45:14] Then I can just have 200 different businesses that come to me.

[45:18] Now, do those 200 businesses coming out of this guy?

[45:20] Nope.

[45:21] What would you do?

[45:23] Want to reach out?

[45:24] Cold reach out, run ads, or make content targeting those people.

[45:27] Then they'd come, and then they do those things on your behalf.

[45:31] Agency will do those things on your behalf.

[45:34] Or if you do all that stuff, then you cold out reach,

[45:38] cold out reach, or my reach paid ads, make content to get employees.

[45:42] And then the employees will do those things on your behalf.

[45:44] Is this simplifying some shit?

[45:48] Right now, business can feel confusing.

[45:51] And usually it's because we have not defined terms.

[45:54] If you define the terms, then you can know you're actually talking

[45:56] about rather than making noise with your face.

[46:00] If you don't make noise with your face, and just know what you're talking about,

[46:02] it becomes a lot easier because the variables become defined.

[46:05] And so if you want to get more leads, you have to do these things.

[46:08] If you want to get even more leads, you get other people to do these things for you,

[46:11] which starts with you doing these things to get those people.

[46:14] That's it.

[46:18] I have three minutes.

[46:20] So I'm going to see if I missed anything.

[46:25] By the way, giving away really good free stuff,

[46:28] great way to get more people to opt into your thing.

[46:32] Just in case anybody needed to be convinced about doing free stuff.

[46:36] Who here wants to know what it looks like when it's all the way right?

[46:40] Yeah?

[46:40] Talk about scaling it?

[46:41] OK.

[46:41] So let's give you a little bit of vision for the future.

[46:43] So we love local brands.

[46:46] They're great.

[46:47] They're wonderful capital compounding vehicles.

[46:49] What you need to know is how much does it cost to open a facility?

[46:51] All right?

[46:52] Cost to open.

[46:56] Then you got to know your top line revenue, or more specifically,

[46:58] your bottom line profit, per facility.

[47:02] The ratio between these things, let's say it's cost me a hundred k

[47:04] to open a facility, and let's say I make a hundred k per year,

[47:08] then I have a 100% cash and cash return.

[47:11] Who here remembers what the stock market is?

[47:13] Less than that, right?

[47:15] Which is why I like it.

[47:16] Now, this would not be that interesting to me.

[47:20] Why?

[47:20] Because I know there's a lot of operational drag associated

[47:22] with opening facilities to make honor grant.

[47:24] And so the idea is, how can I, is there a way that I can get

[47:30] up more leverage models so I can make maybe like 250 to 500,000

[47:34] per facility, and then maybe even if it cost me 500 to make 500,

[47:39] then I only have to open one fifth as many facilities in order

[47:44] to compound my cash.

[47:46] Now, the way to do this, and this is one of the things

[47:50] that I've observed with some of the most successful franchizers

[47:52] in the space, is you have your facility.

[47:55] Now, it has been your special child, you have lots of due dads,

[47:58] lots of whiz bangs that you've attached to it,

[48:00] specialized sessions, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[48:04] The franchise, the franchise is that are the most successful,

[48:08] simplify it.

[48:09] Even if they're corporate or headquarters has like all this stuff,

[48:12] when they want to scale, they massively simplify.

[48:15] They think how little square footage can I possibly use,

[48:17] because I'm not using this to fill my ego,

[48:18] I'm using it to fill my bank account, big difference.

[48:21] How little can I make this so that I'm really

[48:24] efficient with capital?

[48:26] And then how can I make it as little operational drag as possible?

[48:30] I can do it with six people, but can I do it with three?

[48:33] How would I incentivize those people?

[48:37] I know I went from like super dirt, I'm sorry,

[48:39] clouds to dirt here, but that is how you unlock

[48:44] going from five locations to 50 locations.

[48:47] And then you start building the machine that builds the locations.

[48:49] So then you have launch teams that fill it up before it opens.

[48:52] You turn it over to management, they keep running it.

[48:55] And the big key of making all of these work is that it

[49:01] can't just be based off some unique acquisition channel,

[49:05] because those all eventually go away.

[49:08] All advertising platforms will eventually become too expensive

[49:11] and they will eventually die because attention always moves.

[49:14] And so the only way to become enduring with your business,

[49:17] if you really want to sleep well at night,

[49:20] you have to fix the back end.

[49:22] If you know that if you don't sell any new customers,

[49:25] you're still going to be fine next month.

[49:26] And you do that for three or four more months.

[49:28] And you'll still be fine.

[49:29] That's the perfect business to then go market.

[49:32] But that's the boring work that no one wants to do.

[49:35] I'm going to end with this one thing.

[49:38] A franchise or a really popular, not really popular.

[49:42] They had 20 locations.

[49:44] A franchise came to me.

[49:47] And my franchise isn't working.

[49:53] And they had, I think, six corporate stores, 14 franchise.

[49:57] And the average store cost about a million bucks to open.

[50:01] And they made about 150,000 dollars in profit per year.

[50:05] It's like you might as well just invest in a stock

[50:07] and just not bother.

[50:09] That's what you have to think with.

[50:12] And when I saw that they were doing,

[50:15] I think the average was like 1.3 in top line

[50:18] in 150 in bottom line.

[50:20] And I think they were running like a very small margin.

[50:24] I thought to myself, I think it's actually less than 150,

[50:28] point is shitty margins.

[50:32] He was trying to figure out how to market his franchise better.

[50:36] How ridiculous is that?

[50:38] But the thing is, is that like many people who are in this room

[50:40] are thinking the exact same way.

[50:43] And so instead, what I said was, hey, man,

[50:45] I actually think your margins blow.

[50:46] And I think you have a lot of interest,

[50:48] because that's why I took the call.

[50:49] I knew the brand.

[50:50] And I was like, I think you have really good products.

[50:52] I think you just have to get the ops right.

[50:55] So get your margins in check.

[50:56] You've got this menu that has 500 items on it.

[50:59] Boyle it down to the top 15 that everyone usually does.

[51:02] Look at all the ingredients, buy type, see if we can

[51:04] negotiate better deals with vendors,

[51:06] because we're going to consolidate all over demand.

[51:07] We'll get more volume, et cetera, et cetera.

[51:09] And so what I did was I said, hey, we've got 12 months.

[51:13] I want you to spend one month, 12 months in a row,

[51:18] to get 1% profit back.

[51:21] One, 20 get 1% back.

[51:23] All you have to do is my only thing is 1% back.

[51:25] And next month, you're going to find another 1%.

[51:28] Next month, you're going to find another 1%.

[51:29] So all you have to do is, hey, if you find three, three months ahead.

[51:32] Next month, another 1%.

[51:34] And 12 months from now, you would have a business

[51:37] that would be sellable would be investable

[51:39] and would have already tripled or whatever was the profit of that

[51:42] and made it a scalable enterprise.

[51:44] But he had spent 10 years, 10, trying to scale the franchise.

[51:50] When it was the big obvious thing, the Sanctuary just

[51:52] wasn't that good.

[51:54] The Sanctuary in the literal sense was OK for the customer,

[51:57] but it was terrible for the investor.

[51:59] So he had to fix the model.

[52:00] And so I think right now, a lot of everyone here

[52:03] as much as everybody loves to come for leads.

[52:05] That's great.

[52:07] A lot of you guys are just serving media per sandwiches.

[52:09] And I think if you spent a year eating your own sandwich,

[52:12] you would immediately see all the things that are wrong with it.

[52:15] You'd fix that.

[52:15] And then the rest of your life, you'd be able to scale this thing.

[52:19] Thank you.

[00:00] The one thing that limits every business

[00:01] to the entrepreneur, not the opportunity,

[00:03] not the business vehicle, not anything else

[00:05] is the entrepreneur.

[00:06] Everything stems from them.

[00:07] Is there's three things?

[00:08] You've got the skills of the entrepreneur,

[00:10] the character traits of the entrepreneur,

[00:11] and then you have what I would call the beliefs

[00:13] of the entrepreneur,

[00:14] is what do they believe about the world to be true?

[00:15] And what do they believe about the world to be true?

[00:17] That isn't.

[00:18] We have so many of these beliefs,

[00:19] David's that quote society or things that we inherit,

[00:22] but we just choose to say that this is how life is.

[00:24] The easiest way to think about this is an analogy,

[00:26] which is if you imagine a ladder, right?

[00:28] Which you've got the ladder of success.

[00:29] Skills on one side,

[00:30] believe some on the other side,

[00:31] and then you've got character traits in the middle,

[00:33] as the rugs.

[00:34] You might have a tremendous amount of skills

[00:36] and great character, but your beliefs are limited.

[00:38] If all of a sudden you see somebody

[00:40] having overnight success,

[00:41] it's usually because they had two of the three

[00:43] already very, very high level,

[00:45] but they were missing some huge part,

[00:47] some belief was wrong.

[00:48] So for example, for me,

[00:49] when I went from two million to seven to just under 30,

[00:52] in a matter of like three years,

[00:53] I believe things that were true

[00:54] but the world that weren't.

[00:55] And I didn't know that licensing was a model.

[00:57] I didn't know I could expand that way.

[00:58] And so doing, I was able to explode.

[00:59] Because I got into the right vehicle.

[01:01] The vehicle wasn't limited.

[01:02] It was me and my beliefs about it.

[01:04] And then as soon as I changed the way up,

[01:05] it's all the world,

[01:06] I was able to get into a much better vehicle

[01:07] and exploit from there.

[01:08] The skills we learn through education,

[01:11] education comes from repeatedly doing things

[01:14] and learning from that experience.

[01:15] The information that we acquire

[01:17] to learn things comes in a lot of different forms now.

[01:20] The things that I actually invested in,

[01:22] workshops, books, seminars, coaching programs,

[01:26] 101 tutors, one-on-one mentorships,

[01:29] and Google.

[01:30] And I would say if I had to allocate

[01:33] a amount of time spent learning things,

[01:34] Google was still by far the biggest one.

[01:36] It's funny.

[01:37] The other day I had to just set up this new widget

[01:39] for our site, I Googled it.

[01:41] And I did it in two hours.

[01:42] And so I think that the amount of time

[01:43] that elapses between wanting to figure something out

[01:45] and doing something, the more advanced you get,

[01:48] shortens.

[01:49] I'm afraid it took me three years

[01:50] to figure out how to build a landing page

[01:51] and the day I decided to do it, it took me four hours.

[01:53] So it took me three years

[01:54] and then four hours to actually figure it out

[01:56] because I was avoiding the feeling of sucking.

[01:58] And so if you can confront sucking faster

[02:00] and just get over that idea that sucking is a bad thing,

[02:02] then I think you can press the time

[02:03] between you and the skills you want.

[02:04] The highest value I've gotten from is from 101 mentorship.

[02:06] It's from people who are far ahead of me

[02:08] that we're willing to speak strategically into my life.

[02:10] And that's usually because those people

[02:11] can identify all three of those things.

[02:12] They can identify skill deficiencies.

[02:14] They can identify character trade deficiencies

[02:16] and they can identify things that you believe

[02:17] that are true that aren't.

[02:18] So that is where I've gotten the most leverage

[02:20] in my life is on.

[02:20] And I've paid $20,000 to many, many different people

[02:24] just to have them speak into my life.

[02:26] Right underneath of that, as I was coming up,

[02:28] was joining masterminds.

[02:30] It was the getting around other people,

[02:31] because for me it was very lonely.

[02:32] And so just being around other people doing things,

[02:34] it ain't got my competitive drive up

[02:36] because I was willing to be the best.

[02:37] And seeing people that I didn't think were like

[02:39] better than me do something better than me,

[02:42] gave me hope that I too could do it.

[02:44] I'd see somebody be like,

[02:45] I don't think they're worth heart of them.

[02:46] I don't think they've got like some genius brain.

[02:47] If they can do it, I can do it too.

[02:49] Also, when I was in those communities,

[02:50] they would also already have sifted through information

[02:52] for me because there's lots of information out there.

[02:54] The problem is that we have limited time.

[02:55] So it was no longer about,

[02:56] oh, information's free.

[02:57] You can find anywhere, not free.

[02:59] It costs time to go find where it is.

[03:00] And so the idea is when you pay someone for information,

[03:03] it's not your paying for the info.

[03:04] You're paying for the time to come to the sort

[03:06] through it to hand it for you.

[03:07] So you're cutting time.

[03:07] That's what you're saving when you exchange the money.

[03:09] That's the idea.

[03:10] And I think a lot of people don't get that.

[03:11] This is the actual order that I bought things.

[03:13] So the first thing that I did, I did free interviews.

[03:15] So I tried to reach out to people.

[03:16] So I just said, hey, I'll show you the stuff that I've got.

[03:18] You want to share notes with me.

[03:19] I can drive out there.

[03:20] We can meet up.

[03:21] And that's how I learned a lot of my initial stuff.

[03:23] Usually it was older guys who were willing to take a young,

[03:26] buck under their wing.

[03:27] If you're young, the advantage you have is that you're young.

[03:29] You can get a little bit of that goodwill

[03:31] for older guys that you might not normally get

[03:32] if they're the same age.

[03:33] You're like, well, the millionaire won't let me pick his brain.

[03:35] It's like, well, no shit.

[03:35] His times more valuable than yours.

[03:37] Either pay them or you have to go down a run.

[03:39] You have to keep going down until there's somebody

[03:41] that's either a peer or just slightly ahead of you

[03:43] who you can provide value to any very narrow way.

[03:45] The next one I did is I joined a mastermind

[03:47] those $10,000.

[03:48] And I was saying back to yours mastermind, rest in peace.

[03:50] And he actually took enough of a liking to me

[03:52] that he said, once you just become my apprentice

[03:54] and then he started paying.

[03:54] So it was kind of weird.

[03:55] So I paid him and they paid me back.

[03:56] So I worked from 4am to 4pm every day

[03:58] with him basically as his secretary.

[04:00] And I learned a ton.

[04:00] Three months just like learning all these new terms

[04:02] sales, cooperating, affiliate market.

[04:04] I learned all this stuff just for him

[04:05] because he was in that world.

[04:06] From there, I started my first gym.

[04:07] And I stayed in that gym mastermind.

[04:09] During the time I also bought a weekend workshop

[04:11] for Facebook ads.

[04:13] I learned Facebook ads in a small group of 10 people.

[04:15] On two days, it was really valuable for me.

[04:16] Then I didn't really do anything for a couple of years.

[04:18] And then I went to traffic and conversion summit.

[04:20] So that was an event.

[04:21] And I just learned more about marketing in general.

[04:23] I got introduced to different software

[04:24] that I then started using.

[04:25] And then from there, I kind of got more into the digital marketing

[04:28] world.

[04:28] So I joined some masterminds.

[04:30] In that world, I didn't do coaching programs myself.

[04:32] I actually did a buying them for teammates.

[04:34] I think the coaching programs are really effective

[04:35] to teach methods.

[04:36] So if there's a method of acquisition you would learn

[04:38] whether it's like YouTube ads or Twitter ads

[04:40] or cold calling, whatever it is,

[04:42] joining a coaching program

[04:43] about other people trying to learn the same thing

[04:44] from to use good is a great way to fast track your success.

[04:47] It just gives you the accountability.

[04:48] It helps you resolve problems faster.

[04:50] What you're buying is speed.

[04:51] It's not that you can't do it on your own.

[04:52] It's that you can do it faster with help.

[04:54] If you're trying to solve a specific problem,

[04:56] finding specific coaching programs is really good.

[04:58] If you've been stuck for a long time,

[04:59] I think that's where like masterminds

[05:01] and 101 mentorship is more valuable

[05:03] because you probably have a strategic issue

[05:05] more than a tactical problem.

[05:06] Now, the beliefs kind of get solved concurrently

[05:09] when you're in communities.

[05:10] Because the best way to break a belief

[05:11] is to see someone doing what you thought was not real

[05:13] and then have it happen.

[05:14] A lot of people have heard of the Roger Banner story,

[05:16] first man to break a four minute mile

[05:17] and then the next year, 28 people,

[05:19] or whatever it was, broke the four minute mile.

[05:20] And so the nice things that when you join these communities,

[05:22] the biggest benefit is not even the coaching.

[05:24] It's the beliefs that are broken

[05:25] and the things that you thought were false about the world

[05:27] that aren't.

[05:28] And I remember there was a moment where I was in a mastermind

[05:30] and there was a guy making,

[05:31] I think 350,000 dollars a month.

[05:33] And he got up there and he sounded like an idiot.

[05:35] And Lailon, I looked at each other afterwards

[05:37] and like if he can do it, we can do it.

[05:38] That was when we weren't even doing that much money.

[05:40] We were probably doing, I don't know,

[05:41] 20, 30,000 dollars a month.

[05:42] Like it was not a lot of money.

[05:43] So when I joined one of the first masterminds,

[05:45] I wanted to get my money's worth.

[05:46] I wanted to get as much out of this as I possibly could.

[05:47] Number, be everyone's number one student.

[05:49] I talked to every single person in the match,

[05:50] I set up a call with everybody.

[05:51] And I was like, hey, I'm new, I'm good at sales.

[05:54] That was my first skill that I had.

[05:55] I didn't have any, I didn't have any, I didn't have an old market.

[05:57] I didn't know ads, I didn't know webinars,

[05:58] I didn't know landing, I didn't know any of that stuff.

[05:59] But I was like, I know how to sell.

[06:00] What I did was I just offered every single person

[06:03] to go over their salescript, edit it,

[06:05] the way that I would structure it

[06:06] and then rewrite the messel script my way for free.

[06:08] And I did that with everyone.

[06:09] And then what happened is I had all these big stack of IOUs.

[06:12] And then I was like, I wanna get in it and I'm marketing.

[06:14] And I was like, Johnny was good at landing pages.

[06:17] Hey Johnny, remember I have to do that sales thing?

[06:19] You think you could help me with landing pages?

[06:20] Sure, man.

[06:21] Of course.

[06:22] Okay, what else do I need?

[06:23] I don't know how to run ads.

[06:25] Hey Sarah, you were really good at running ads.

[06:27] Remember that sales thing I helped you?

[06:28] Sure, of course.

[06:29] And I get one-on-one tutoring from everybody.

[06:31] On the things that they're best at because I just gave

[06:32] everyone what I was best at.

[06:33] That's how I did it.

[06:34] You wanna become the most valuable person in your network

[06:36] and then in so doing, you can't access to everyone's network.

[06:38] Like, Joe Rogan doesn't need to network.

[06:40] He just is Joe Rogan.

[06:41] And so if he wants access to somebody,

[06:43] he gets access to them because he's valuable.

[06:45] I've never been a fan of like the networking hacks.

[06:47] It just provide value to people for nothing.

[06:49] And then you will have people who, oh, you stop it.

[06:51] You've got your skills, you got your beliefs,

[06:52] and then you got your character traits.

[06:54] If there's one that is the most important

[06:55] I do think it's character traits,

[06:56] because the character traits are the wellspring

[06:58] that the other things are found at point.

[07:00] If you don't have discipline,

[07:00] you'll never be able to actually study anything

[07:02] that's just in lead to gain the skill.

[07:04] If you don't have focus and you're always building a new bridge

[07:06] every week about the new business that you're gonna do,

[07:08] it doesn't matter how many skills you have

[07:09] and the belief you have about the world,

[07:11] Zuckerberg couldn't start 17 Facebook,

[07:12] so you only start one and you have to stick with it.

[07:14] And so that takes focus.

[07:15] This is a really important point.

[07:17] If you have a trait, and this is where

[07:19] it's helpful to have communities of other people

[07:20] and ideally mentors and set of who can speak in your life.

[07:22] And there's not even that many mentors who have the social awareness

[07:24] to say, I don't think you have integrity.

[07:26] I don't think you have focus.

[07:27] I don't think you have discipline.

[07:28] I don't think you have work ethic.

[07:29] I don't think you have drive.

[07:30] I don't think you have empathy.

[07:31] I don't think you have patience.

[07:32] Like these are virtues, these are character traits

[07:34] that people want to embody.

[07:36] That's like how do you develop these traits?

[07:39] You don't develop the character trait.

[07:42] You act in accordance to what someone with that character trait

[07:44] would do.

[07:45] And you do it despite being uncomfortable doing it.

[07:48] So I'll give you an example.

[07:49] I was walking the other day with Leila.

[07:50] I was like, God, I'm so impatient.

[07:52] I was labeling myself as impatient.

[07:53] And I've probably, that's been something

[07:55] that I've believed in my whole life.

[07:56] I was like, yeah, I'm impatient.

[07:57] I'm impatient person.

[07:57] Go, go, go, go, go.

[07:58] But I also want to be a more patient person.

[08:01] I want to be wise to be more alone-term thinking.

[08:03] And she said, you're not impatient.

[08:05] And I was like, what do you mean?

[08:06] I was like, all I want is for all this stuff to go faster.

[08:09] And she's like, yeah, but you're not changing direction.

[08:12] All your actions are one of somebody who is patient.

[08:15] So the fact that you're uncomfortable being patient

[08:17] does not mean you're impatient.

[08:18] It means you're just patient.

[08:20] And so your internal feelings about what you're doing

[08:22] have nothing to do with the trait.

[08:24] And so you think about the reverse of that

[08:25] where someone's like, I'm super disciplined.

[08:27] Except they don't do anything that's disciplined.

[08:28] You're like, no, you're not.

[08:29] They're like, no, but I feel good.

[08:31] Like, yeah, but you're not disciplined.

[08:32] You have no evidence to support that you were disciplined.

[08:34] The idea of building a character trait

[08:36] is not do I have the character trait

[08:37] or do I not have the character trait?

[08:39] It's to what extent do I have the trait.

[08:40] And so if you can think about character traits that way,

[08:43] then you can start reverse engineering

[08:44] the character trait that you act.

[08:45] And this is really hard because one of the things

[08:47] that I see with entrepreneurs all the time

[08:49] is it will happen is that they will feel bad about something.

[08:52] And then they will want to change something

[08:53] in their business to make themselves feel better.

[08:55] They take those emotions and then they try and feel better

[08:58] by a radical behavior that's non-directional

[09:00] and then they break their original strategy.

[09:02] The more willing you are to endure discomfort

[09:04] for an extended period of time based on a decision

[09:06] that you made in the past because you know

[09:07] it's better for your future means you are more patient.

[09:09] Character traits even more than any of them

[09:11] are a pursuit of perfection that we will never attain.

[09:13] But in understanding it that way

[09:14] you can see it as a journey of trying to stack up wins

[09:17] in your favor.

[09:18] You do the thing and you do it so many times

[09:20] that at some point you look back and you realize

[09:21] you know what?

[09:22] I do do this most of the time.

[09:23] I guess I do own this trait

[09:25] and then you can label yourself as a patient man,

[09:27] a wise man, a kind man.

[09:28] And I think in doing that you'll ultimately

[09:30] tap into the wall spring that allows you to grow beyond your groups.

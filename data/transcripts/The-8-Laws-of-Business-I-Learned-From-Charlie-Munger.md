[00:00] What's going on everyone? My name is Alex Ramosi and the CEO and founder of Alan prestige labs Jim launch and we own a portfolio of other companies

[00:07] We've done 120 plus million last four years in this video when I want to do is show you the eight principles

[00:12] Charlie Munger taught me to succeed in business life and

[00:16] By no means am I saying that I have completely executed all these things in my life these are just aspirational things that I think

[00:23] Then if it most humans, right those are you who know me. I'm a huge a huge fan

[00:28] I've consumed a lot of his materials and so I wanted to consolidate his speeches and his

[00:35] his work into these principles for anyone who's got a new to Charlie Munger and so I'm not gonna do these in order

[00:42] I'm gonna do these in the order that I think he makes the most into present them

[00:45] The first one is invert always invert and so he references Johnny Carson in one of his speeches to always try and solve problems in reverse

[00:55] And this has been something that's been immensely powerful

[00:57] I think because for us using thinking frameworks in order to make decisions in order to solve problems as both you know

[01:03] entrepreneurs business people and then just just in daily life

[01:06] So many times we try and solve it logically going forward towards it and it gives you the

[01:11] It's entirely fresh perspective to start at what you don't want and then try and solve from that direction and that'll kind of lead way into the other

[01:20] eight

[01:21] Excuse me the other seven of the lessons and at the very end I'll give you the one the one thing that I if just from the the things that we've done that I would add

[01:30] to the list that has been really helpful for us or rather things to avoid

[01:35] So his first thing that you hear him talk about all the time is just don't ingest chemicals to alter your state

[01:41] Right, he's like I've never heard of someone like if I wanted to be really poor or really

[01:45] unsuccessful in life what would I do he's like well I would definitely get addicted to chemicals right and so this sounds so logical

[01:51] Like obvious to us but and instead so many of us

[01:54] Still use that stuff on a regular basis to alter our mood because we can't cope with some of the issues that are coming up in our lives

[02:00] He's like I can't imagine anyone who's thought to themselves man my life is so much better

[02:06] Now that because I because I do drugs and because I drink and I'm not saying that you know

[02:11] That's a judgment in an o a it's just one of the principles that he's found to be a successful trait for himself and others

[02:18] Number three envy so one of the things that's been a gift for more buffet and Charlie Munger together

[02:24] Is the statement that they made both of them being you know super billionaires and they said every single year

[02:30] Someone is doing better than us and

[02:32] For me that was so like

[02:34] Like I don't got runging the wrong word, but like that hit me because I think I'm so I am

[02:40] Innately so competitive that I suffer from comparison all the time

[02:45] I was actually texting a friend this morning who's also a you know

[02:48] Multi-blater decabelioner and he was saying

[02:50] He's like I feel like the more money I make the poor I feel and

[02:54] It's totally true because what ends up happening is that you're you're measuring stick changes

[02:58] I remember you know when I when I was really really young my measuring stick for money was Chipotle burritos

[03:03] It was just how many Chipotle burritos is this amount of money it quite to and so I actually think that we have like a sticker or unit

[03:09] That becomes our base unit

[03:11] When we're measuring wealth for ourselves and that's why when I think I had a hundred thousand dollars my big count

[03:15] That was probably the wealthiest I have ever felt because I had proportional to what my measuring stick was which at that time was still meals

[03:23] Hundred thousand dollars was so much so much money so many of those units at this point in my life

[03:29] A million dollars is kind of my measuring unit that I use as a base unit for how many how many of these do I have in this how many how many you know how many sticks do I have?

[03:37] In you know real estate how many sticks do I have in in my portfolio how much do I have in equity in these companies?

[03:42] etc

[03:43] And so that stick changes but someone is always doing better

[03:46] But I think it's so much more about not thinking about them because the way that they roll the dice and play the game is no effect on us

[03:53] And so simply it's an imaginary way to make yourself suffer

[03:56] So if you want to suffer definitely be envious of people the fourth one was

[04:01] Definitely resent people like really hold on to resentment if you want to be miserable and so

[04:07] One of the stories that Charlie tells us of a king

[04:10] Who committing trying to not be resentful of people what he would do is every time he'd want to resent someone

[04:14] He'd write their name down and he'd put it on a silver paper and a drawer and

[04:18] Periodically he'd go to that drawer open it up and read the names and realize how life had dealt with those people without him having to do anything

[04:25] And so I think it's one of those long-term mydeness that like

[04:30] Most people live in comic balance independent of whether or not you believe in you know that kind of woo us stuff

[04:34] But simply like people who do bad things eventually that catches up to them and it is worse for them

[04:40] And so you like someone who exists in that state is already dealing with the suffering of being who they are and so

[04:46] You know if you want to be miserable definitely resent people

[04:50] The next one is be unreliable

[04:52] Right like if you want to definitely be miserable like be unreliable

[04:56] Say you're gonna do something and don't do it say you're gonna be somewhere and be late

[05:01] Be flaky make commitments that you don't keep and

[05:03] This one is one of those ones that he references a lot of times is he's like if you just get this one

[05:09] Right and you are reliable. It's very difficult to be miserable. It's very difficult to be unsuccessful and

[05:14] There was a guy that I was that I knew in high school and this is when I had a you know a bigger ego than I have now

[05:21] And I was such a so I was such a dick. I honestly I was just there's no other way to say it. I just was and

[05:27] This kid was

[05:30] Just like he stayed he went to all the extra credit for for teachers. He worked so hard

[05:36] And he had nothing going for him like he wasn't like the best looking kid. He wasn't athletic

[05:40] Like he didn't have like this natural processing parry wasn't quick like that

[05:44] But I remember and I was such a mean guy to this kid and I remember one time

[05:49] We got in some sort of spat and I was like in what world were you ever be better than me at anything

[05:53] And I remember saying that and you can you can feel it's so dripped and ego and it's just kind of disgusting

[05:58] But anyways, I said this to him and

[06:00] He ended up getting into a better college than me. I ended up going to Vanderbilt hand up going to Duke

[06:05] And I just remember that moment because it was such a deep lesson for me that like

[06:09] He was more reliable than I was he was more long-suffering than I was he was more consistent than I was he showed up to every

[06:15] Teachers thing he showed up. He did all the extra credit. He did all the homework

[06:19] He like he did all those things and he just showed up and

[06:22] That was a huge lesson for me that I was like if I could just shop like back I does like man

[06:27] Things will open up for me, but if you want to fail

[06:30] Definitely be unreliable the next one is over spend your income

[06:33] You know definitely if you want to get if you want to if you want to put yourself in a heart

[06:37] Horrible situation on a regular basis and consistently have stress

[06:40] Definitely spend more than you make which you know America is doing right now with their own GDP

[06:44] But we want to even get into that but definitely over someone which you make like don't save

[06:49] You know spend more than what you have always have bigger aspirations than you have the ability to fill on and

[06:53] Definitely always live in debt and the wrong kind of debt the bad debt and so if you've any followed any my stuff

[07:00] My I'm a huge proponent of living broke all the time and it's because I believe wealth is a ratio between

[07:07] Income and expenses it's not a number right if you can live on one person on what you make as a hypothetical example

[07:14] Then you are in you are infinitely wealthy because you already have a hundred times more your income is a hundred times more

[07:20] Then your expenses between you could live veritably for a hundred years and so just on one

[07:24] Years income so that's an extreme example just to illustrate the point but if you like for me

[07:29] I feel less and less anxiety the the greater the percentages of access I have in my

[07:35] Expendantures versus how I live and so there's two ways to get there one is you can increase how much you make the other

[07:39] way so you can decrease how much you spend but the thing is is no matter where you are right now

[07:42] The one that you can immediately change is how much you spend over time

[07:45] You can use those that those extra funds invest in yourself

[07:48] Bro the the top line so that you can even make that discrepancy crazier so that your wealth can increase that ratio

[07:54] Being your wealth can increase and so for me

[07:57] I try and live on 10% that that hundred thousand dollar story that I gave you earlier

[08:02] Once I was I had a million dollars in my bank account

[08:04] I still lived on 30 thousand dollars a year and so I was you know

[08:08] I was living on three percent at that point of my wealth but my income was was already

[08:12] surpassing a million dollars a year at that point and so

[08:16] I was living on three percent on what I was taking home and honestly I felt so free because I just

[08:21] knew that I had way more money than I would ever need that's very freeing

[08:24] So but if you want to fail definitely over spend during come the next one is learn only from your own mistakes

[08:30] Right don't learn from the stakes of others don't learn from other people's successes and

[08:34] What I want to add is a wrinkle to this is that

[08:37] Depending on where you're at near journey this is something that I've observed is

[08:43] You in the very very beginning you have no value to offer I get messages frequently if people be in like hey

[08:49] Let's start a business together. I'll give you half and I'm like well you're providing no value

[08:52] I'm the one who would know how to run this business so this is not a good trade for me

[08:55] You know

[08:56] Return of my time is not very good another one is I'll work with you. You know I'll work for you for free

[09:00] You know if you if you teach me everything and I was like yeah that's so I'm getting someone who has no skills in no value

[09:06] And exchange you're getting an education from someone you know like that's not a fair

[09:10] That's not a good exchange for me, right? And so what you have to do is find ways where even that you can trade your base level

[09:17] Which is time for someone who has a need for that level of skill who's ahead of you and that's where like small businesses

[09:23] Like if someone's making a hundred thousand one or two hundred thousand dollars a year in a business

[09:27] That's not a very big business but if you if you say I will work for free for you

[09:32] Then someone like that can still use for lack of a better term just hands

[09:36] Right someone who can just help and just be there as a body and I know that may sound diminutive towards you

[09:41] But if you have no base skills that is that is your base skill that you have as you have your time in your hands

[09:45] Right, and so you use that and then you can learn some more skills and then from that point

[09:50] You develop the next level which is where you can start a foreign coaches, right?

[09:54] From the level above that when I say learning only from your own mistakes first is you learn from

[09:58] People for free by exchanging your time then you learn from coaches

[10:02] Then you can learn from masterminds which is people where you are now at this point equal with other people in the room who are good

[10:08] And what I will tell you is this if you're at eight figures

[10:10] Some shit switching gears in terms of who I'm talking to but as you go up this journey

[10:14] How you network and learn from others changes it evolves and you know

[10:18] I went the coach route for the first you know three four years of my entrepreneurial journey and then it was much more towards the mastermind route

[10:26] Later on but things is once we pass eight figures for us in terms of your early revenue and your lean come

[10:33] It's shifted to being much more about networking and advisors

[10:37] So that's kind of two different things networking is like other people who are at that level

[10:40] That you just network with and you meet at things and you don't need to seem charities that kind of thing and the other aspect is like well

[10:46] If you want someone ahead of you at that point

[10:48] It a lot of times A you can still get it from the network sometimes

[10:51] But if you really want to get a lot from someone you need to make sure that there's some sort of exchange that's fair

[10:56] And that's where kind of advisory relationships work really well and so I have an advisor

[11:01] And that means they you know they get a minority percentage and something that you guys are working on and so they have an incentive to teach you some of these elements

[11:08] And you at this point you're already proven as an effective person you have the character traits of being reliable

[11:14] You know a big advantage having long suffering having the abilities to execute

[11:18] So they know that they can just drop the information and then it will be incorporated and then they can succeed with you

[11:24] And then the final aspect is what I would say the highest level is heroes because a lot of people

[11:29] We don't have access to you don't even in even this video right now like I don't know Charlie Munger

[11:33] I have not met Charlie Munger, but Charlie Munger is a hero of mine

[11:36] And so I feel like I've been directly mentored by Charlie despite the fact that I've never met the man and so I'm

[11:43] Turnily grateful for me because he's you know significantly change my life for the better

[11:47] Which will naturally lead me to the his last point and then I'll give you the one that I would add

[11:52] Just from my own experience in my life

[11:54] So his last point would be quit when you have your third or fourth big failure in life

[11:58] Is it so if you want to if you want to fail and you want to be miserable

[12:01] You should definitely quit soon quit early

[12:03] Right he's like because no matter who you are you're going to fail

[12:06] Not just once or twice or three times or four times but you will fail many times and

[12:10] If you if you quit early, then you can guarantee that you will be you know miserable for a very long time

[12:17] After that because then you have given up hope and you'll have nothing to strive towards you know

[12:20] I have no purpose and so if you want to be miserable definitely quit early

[12:24] Right and even count crout the amount of times you failed because because for some reason that means something

[12:28] Right, it doesn't mean anything and so to wrap this up I'll give you Alex's one

[12:34] That's been tremendously helpful for me

[12:36] Which is this is kind of started from a speech I heard one of the prisons say

[12:42] From the past but was the the way to

[12:46] Be successful is to be able to handle pressure

[12:50] Right so if you want to if you want to if you want to fail

[12:53] Definitely crack under pressure like no matter what happens just crack under pressure crack what people need you and so

[13:00] My my candid solution for this to the things that have helped me

[13:04] Is understanding a what it is which is most of us just create arbitrary

[13:08] Expectations and then crumble under pressures that we put on our self that don't actually exist in the world

[13:13] We literally create things to away ourselves down

[13:16] Which I feel like the further along you get in the entrepreneurial game it becomes headier and headier

[13:21] Because it you realize it's so much just about the limits that you've been playing you place on yourself

[13:25] And so here's three strategies that I have used that are mentally

[13:29] Have that have mentally made me much more resilient the first and I got this from from Trevor who got it from Epictetus

[13:35] Which is a H philosopher is negative visualization and so let me give you a tactically example of that

[13:40] This is a simple example so I just spent a couple hundred dollars on a shirt

[13:45] I really like the shirt and I don't really spend money a lot on unclothing and

[13:49] After I watched the shirt it was like messed up. I'll just put it simply right this is a simple example to illustrate

[13:57] And then I he had just told me about this negative visualization the day before and

[14:02] He said take something that happens negative and then imagine it happening a thousand more times in a row

[14:08] How would you feel in the thousandth time and I thought to myself if every time I watched a shirt

[14:13] You know it shrunk like this or something or it became rougher around the edges and I got it because it was soft

[14:18] I probably

[14:20] Wouldn't care that much it would just be like oh, that's just how these things are and

[14:23] So what means is that my expectations would change in my mind to what they to match reality and then at that point

[14:29] My misery would disappear and so this literally would I did in the moment and I felt myself just stop caring about this thing

[14:35] That actually bugged me a little bit because I was like man, that's annoying

[14:38] But you can use that same concept with any of the things that occur in your life when it's like man my my my

[14:43] My wife said this thing well, what if she said that thing a thousand times in a row?

[14:47] We'd be like well, I guess that's just kind of how how she is or that's just kind of how things are and then all of a sudden

[14:52] You would acclimate it, but you can rapidly force the acclamation to stress by visualizing it happening thousands of times and

[14:59] Then skipping to the end because if you can feel that way after a thousand times

[15:02] Then you might as well feel that way after the first time and that has been so powerful for me

[15:06] Because we have so many stressors that come in our lives and we set expectations that we're even not aware that we're setting and then get underperformed on

[15:12] The second thing that's been really helpful for me is that if I want to start a new behavior or I'm trying to do something that is difficult

[15:19] Then what I want to do is go into it and expect it the worst and let me give you a real that that sounds obvious

[15:25] But let me give you a realistic reasoning for this so let's say that you want to start working out

[15:31] Mentally prepare yourself for the fact that every time I work out

[15:35] I'm gonna be tired every time I work out

[15:37] I'm gonna not be motivated and that's just going to be my base reality if I happen to be motivated or

[15:43] Happened and not be exhausted or I happen to not have a lot of work to do then then that's just a bonus

[15:48] It's serb it is serbidipitous. It's it's just a happy

[15:51] Coincidence but I expect that every time I work out

[15:54] I will be tired. I'll have more things to do and I will not you know be motivated to do so and

[15:59] If I come in with that expectation and I set that as my baseline

[16:02] Then I am not surprised when I go to work out and I feel that way because then it is in alignment with the expectations that I have in my mind

[16:09] the third of

[16:11] Of the subtext of you know creating false expectations and crumbling under pressures that we create for ourselves

[16:17] Is one that is it will probably be controversial for some of you

[16:21] But this is a belief that I hold and it has been immensely powerful for me in terms of

[16:26] Increasing my joy in life which is Elon Musk I heard him talk a while back about how

[16:33] He's said eventually the universal expand infinitely until everything becomes a fine mist

[16:38] Everything just becomes a fine mist if you extend the time rise and long enough and

[16:43] For me

[16:44] That means that everything that we create on earth and as humanity will eventually disappear

[16:50] So the skyscrapers the books that I write the people that we help people who remember us the legacy that we are trying to have after we die

[16:58] Even that will eventually turn into a fine mist and not matter and

[17:03] For me that is so immensely powerful because

[17:06] It means that nothing matters and at the same time it means that we get to choose what things we we create meaning with and

[17:14] So I believe our brains are simply meaning making machines and I love that term

[17:18] So I'm giving it to you is that just I have this meaning making machine in my mind

[17:22] Which everything has no meaning and then I can choose to highlight aspects that I I will create meaning for and

[17:29] So understanding that the millions that I have

[17:33] Maybe the billions that I'll make in my lifetime and the wealth that I accumulate the reputation the books

[17:39] The impact all of that stuff will eventually disappear truly

[17:42] They will eventually be gone there will be a day where no one knows that I existed or anything like that

[17:48] In some ways it frees me in the present knowing that everything that I do will eventually mean nothing and so

[17:54] All of us are essentially in my mind, you know, there's the the Nazi concentration camps

[18:00] People would dig holes and then they'd fill holes back up again and it was it was basically meaningless work

[18:05] But it was only meaningless because they believed that it was meaningless

[18:09] Right, but essentially all of us in my own mind and my understanding of reality are

[18:14] Simply just digging holes every day that will eventually when the time horizon is long enough

[18:18] Get filled back with dirt and so what that means is

[18:22] Imagine I was in that same concentration camp for example, which might be an analogy for life and

[18:28] Instead of being given a shovel to dig holes they said you can do whatever you want

[18:34] But at the end of your life you have to undo it all right

[18:37] Well then I could probably have I could probably engineer fairly joyful experience for myself because I would do things that are simulating for me

[18:43] And that I find enjoyable right and so by doing that

[18:48] It's just removed all of the expectations and a lot of the envy that I have for other people because I know that all of us in the end

[18:55] There's no box that we take with us right and so that's just been

[19:00] Just wildly impactful for me as human being and in terms of decreasing pressure in my life in business

[19:08] There's just nothing that's that big of a deal right because eventually all of it's gonna disappear anyway

[19:12] So if someone's upset with you, it's like well, you know

[19:15] We're all gonna become a fine mist in the future eventually you know like ah, you know

[19:19] We've got this competitor who's who's do's talk stealing our stuff

[19:22] You know

[19:24] We're all gonna disappear into a fine mist eventually and that has been so calming for me and has relieved so much pressure

[19:30] For me mentally that may be depressing for some people for me. It's wildly for me and

[19:35] So I guess if it's depressing for you that don't think about it

[19:38] But if it if if that resonates with you then then maybe you can use that as a weapon in your arsenal to defend against the pressures that

[19:44] We inevitably put on ourselves that we can deconstruct and deflate and so anyways

[19:49] Those are the lessons that I have learned from Charlie Munger as my hero and mentor from consuming so much of his content

[19:54] I hope you found value in that if you were you know if you're a business owner

[19:58] I make a lot of more tactical things about how to make money and all this stuff on this channel if you like this stuff

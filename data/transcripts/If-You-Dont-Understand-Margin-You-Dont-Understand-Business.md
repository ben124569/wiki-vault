[00:00] If you've ever struggled at the end of the month and worked all the way there to only to look at the bank account and find that there was nothing there

[00:06] There was too little for you to take out and then been like I literally just worked for an entire month for nothing

[00:11] The this video is for you

[00:13] All right, so one of the number one issues that I see when I talk to small business owners

[00:17] You're medium sized business owners is that they don't have an adequate grasp on the different swing gross and that margin and the reason I'm coloring the background green

[00:25] And I'm using my green pen is that margin is about the money

[00:27] So this is a topic that people do not talk about it is also probably the number one thing that I look at in a business to determine itself and

[00:35] Whether I would be interested in investing or any of those types of things

[00:38] So let me break down the difference between gross margin and net margin and then I'm going to tell you the functional ways that I use to fix a business all right, so

[00:46] gross margin

[00:49] gross margin is

[00:51] what the

[00:53] Direct cost of filling your goods or services are and so the equation for it

[00:58] Don't get everyone's like I don't like met it's subtraction all right

[01:01] It's not math that you be you're confused about if you like zone out at this moment

[01:05] It's because you don't want to do the thinking to understand the words on

[01:08] We really clear. I'm literally going to use subtraction here. All right. It's the revenue how much money you're making

[01:13] Minus the cost of good salt all right. That's the cogs now the thing is if you're going to service business

[01:19] Your cost of good salt isn't the physical products that you're selling those

[01:23] You're selling people you're selling payroll hours, all right, and so the cost of good salt for a service business

[01:30] Which is what the majority people were listening to this are using is the incremental cost of the additional unit

[01:36] Which means that that doesn't count your front desk girl that doesn't count your HR director. It doesn't count your rent none of that stuff counts

[01:42] It's just the cost of one additional unit all right

[01:46] very important

[01:48] You are net margin and I'm going to give you examples in a second you're net margin

[01:53] Is is your chop right that's which it's the juice at the end of the month

[01:57] It's what you get after everything is paid what's left over

[02:01] That's what you end up taking home all right

[02:03] But the gross margin in my opinion while they're both obviously very important

[02:06] But the gross margin is the one that be gets that creates the net margin and this is the one where I always focus

[02:12] And this is the thing that I fix and this is what I help people fix and this is the game all right

[02:17] So my revenue minus cost so let's say we're selling a service

[02:22] for $60 per

[02:24] per hour

[02:26] That's what that's what it let's just say you know your hair stylist or your trainers man, right?

[02:29] You're you're selling $60 right in your business and your cost of good salt

[02:34] Let's say is 20 bucks right you're paying somebody $20 for the $60 thing

[02:38] You're like that sounds good. There's $40 left over for me this makes sense, right

[02:44] Wrong all right and I'll get to wine a second and what number I use

[02:49] But let's just do this so you can understand what the gross margin is here

[02:52] So the gross margin on this and that's assuming we're not using any product to like work on this if you were like a hair stylist for example

[02:57] But let's just say simply here

[02:59] $60 is what your charging $20 is what it costs in $40 left over right now

[03:04] What you do to figure out your margins?

[03:06] You take that $40 right what's left over divided by the $60 of revenue which is what you got gross

[03:13] And what that does is it gets $66% that's the gross margin

[03:17] You're like all that that sounds reasonable. That's not that much you know, that's not that bad the thing is is each

[03:23] incremental gross margin point

[03:25] It's enormous and so let me show you the difference so let's say at the end of the year

[03:29] You're running a business at runs on 66% gross margins and let's say at the very end of the year now

[03:34] We're in the net margin category you are you end up with 12% margins all right now

[03:38] Most brick and mortar businesses run around there crazy, right, but that's what most brick and mortar businesses run around

[03:45] So if you're at 12% margins and I say listen you got to be at 80 people like well 80 and 66 is not that different if you bunch your margins to 80%

[03:56] What happens at the end of the year? That's 14 all right, so that does this you now have

[04:02] 26%

[04:05] Net margins at the end here we more than doubled we 2.2x

[04:10] How much you make?

[04:13] So do you think this is important can I double how much you make simply by changing this one number?

[04:18] Yes, all right, so let's use the 80% example which by the way is my rule of thumb

[04:22] This is the number that I get any service based business over all right doesn't matter what you're selling

[04:27] This is what you have to get over all right now. I'll show you difference in 80 90 and any 500 in a second

[04:32] But this is important all right so

[04:35] If 80%

[04:37] Gross margins what I need there's two ways I can do it one

[04:41] I can decrease this cost right I could say that I get this to 12

[04:47] 12 dollars right this becomes 12 bucks across that out and now my my new

[04:53] Take home on this is 48 dollars all right and so 48 dollars

[05:00] Over 60

[05:03] equals 80% so one way you can increase your margins decrease your cost gross margin the cost of actually doing the thing right the second way

[05:11] Is by increasing how much you charge this guy right and so let's say instead of 60 and we have this 20 so what is?

[05:19] How do we get 80% loafed over if we have a 20 dollar cost?

[05:23] Well, it's easy with this number because 20 is 20% right and so that means that you'd have to charge $100

[05:29] for your 20 dollar thing to have

[05:33] an 80% margin and so way number one you decrease the cost of fulfilling the thing

[05:38] Way number two you increase the price right now. This is why this is so important

[05:47] Obviously I showed you at the end of the year you'd have a lot of money but besides that

[05:51] If you were making a hundred dollar or you're charging a hundred dollars or something right and it cost you 20

[05:57] You got $80 left over all right now from that 80 dollars and here's what's important

[06:02] You have to pay for everything else in the business and have enough money to market to acquire more customers and

[06:09] You have to have enough money

[06:12] To have a profit right and so it seems like you're like 80% Alex that's crazy and so by the way

[06:17] All successful business that the biggest business in the world

[06:20] They're not running 80% margins. They're running 99%

[06:24] Gross margins all right and you're like well, they're only that's only 19% more

[06:28] It's actually not it's so much more than that

[06:30] So let me break down this difference real quick and then I'll finish this example so the difference between 80% margins

[06:37] 90% margins

[06:40] 95% margins right I

[06:44] Just go all the way to 100 right and 100 let's do this is that difference between 80 and 90 is that this is twice as

[06:51] As profitable as this why because it's half the cost right it means I took that 20 and made it 10

[06:57] Right that's the difference you're looking at this side of the equation not all of this all right

[07:02] They're just at the 90 and 95% gross margins again twice as profitable and what I mean by that is that you can sell twice as many people for the same cost

[07:12] That is the magic and that is how you scale that is how you get something that's

[07:16] enormously profitable allows you to acquire customers and has tons of profit kicking off every single month and so this is where a lot of entrepreneurs get messed up

[07:24] Because they feel bad about charging a lot for their services or a lot for their products or whatever right

[07:30] The thing is is that if you do not do this you will make no profit and you will not be able to scale

[07:35] You will not help more people unless you get this price you got to get over this mental barrier that you have around

[07:40] What you're able to charge for things that don't cost you out of money

[07:45] Right, right, okay, so back to this example. So if I have $80 left over

[07:51] That means that it depends on what my cost of acquisition is so let's say

[07:56] You know there's a certain percentage of my revenue that I'm willing to give for cost of acquisition

[08:00] Let's say it's 20% right so if 20% this I'm willing to give

[08:04] That means that

[08:05] $16 is what I have left to market this right

[08:10] Because you see like you can only use it off of what's left here and you still after you pay your marketing right

[08:17] You still have the rest of your cost you still have rent you still have payroll you still have you know

[08:22] A payroll for all the non-essential stuff you still have software stuff all these other costs of doing business

[08:28] All right, they have to come out of just the remainder between here and here all right

[08:33] This is the game and so in some total here if I'm looking at a business

[08:39] The big number that I'm looking at is 80% and that's what I I target I target any business

[08:48] Especially for service

[08:50] That's over 80% and so if I'm trying to invest in something or I'm trying like this is the game that we get to and so you can do this for any brick and

[08:58] Order business for your business for anything you gotta be over 80 and ideally

[09:02] pushing from 80 to 90 or 90 to 95 at each of these increments

[09:07] doubles

[09:08] The productivity of a business again, right and that's where it gets magical and so the two ways you can do it

[09:14] Just as a quick recap to increase your gross margin is number one you can decrease the cost

[09:22] And number two you can increase the price and

[09:26] That is how you can increase your gross margin percentage all right

[09:31] So I hope that was before you hope that made sense

[09:33] I hope if you look at your own services and you're like well like what's my gross margin?

[09:38] Break it down. What's the additional cost for one more person right?

[09:43] If I like I said earlier if I was selling something for $60 and if you don't know

[09:47] Let's say you've got one person. I'll give you one more example for this. Let's say

[09:52] You've got the type of business where one person fulfills for many people because you're like

[09:56] I don't know what my cost would be so I actually had this example not that long ago

[09:59] I was at a mastermind and a guy said he's got coaches and they coach people right and so I said

[10:04] We'll what are you know what are your gross margins and see so I got you have no idea

[10:07] I was like well, let's walk through it together

[10:08] So he was paying his coach $4,000 a month all right that's what he was paying his coach

[10:13] And I said cool how many clients can your coach handle?

[10:17] You said well my my coach can handle 40 people right 40 clients

[10:23] I was like okay, what do you charge your clients for a month?

[10:26] He's a why sell packages and I was like all right?

[10:28] What are your packages cost you like at their $1200 packages?

[10:31] I was like okay, what is $1200 get me?

[10:33] He said it gets you three months

[10:36] I'm gonna give you a real word example here so please you die stick this all right?

[10:39] Which means that it's $400 per month if you spread it out right?

[10:44] So you just got 40 clients

[10:47] $400 a month is what is what they're what they're charging all right?

[10:51] Which means 40 times 400 hopefully my math is right here is 160,000

[10:57] Hopefully my missing something in here. I think it's 160,000

[11:00] Did the 0 4 times 4,000 now 16,000

[11:06] Is 16,000 dollars per month right?

[11:11] That's cool right that's neat so 16,000 dollars per month and the cost to the coaches 4,000

[11:17] Right everyone following with me so means that there's 12,000 leftover

[11:24] So that's what's left over after the cost and then we're just dividing it by the total revenue right?

[11:28] Which is this guy just bring it back down so it's just 12 divided by 16 right which in this instance

[11:34] We 75%

[11:37] So he's close to 80 but he's like well, you know, I don't want to change anything because I'm already a 75

[11:43] But remember at the end of the year the end of the year

[11:47] Let's say you've you've got 15% margins right?

[11:49] Let's just say the end of the year you got 15% bumping the extra five

[11:53] Takes you to 20 right?

[11:55] You're like oh wow that doesn't seem like a big difference

[11:58] 15 to 20% net margins at the end of the year is a 25%

[12:04] Increase in how much money you make that is how important this is and so anyways

[12:10] So what do you need to do he there's just to pay the sky less or he's got a charge

[12:14] Charge more money year and so the way to figure this out backwards if you wanted to

[12:20] If you didn't want to change

[12:22] Excuse me if you did want to change your your price to get it over 80% then you simply

[12:28] Basically increase with this number needs to be until it's 80% so

[12:32] gosh, what's the it's 1.6 times eight whatever

[12:38] eight and then

[12:41] God it's

[12:43] 12.8 yeah, so that would mean that he if to get to 12,800

[12:48] If you wanted to get over 80% which means he either needs to charge the the extra

[12:54] 40 clients and extra

[12:56] $200 now

[12:57] $20 yeah, you need to charge an extra 20 bucks here right per month or he could pay this coach

[13:06] per month and that is how he would get from 75

[13:10] to 80% and

[13:11] That my friends is the game

[13:14] So hope you found this useful hopefully you like this hopefully you thought this was awesome

[13:18] If you didn't well, please tell me

[13:20] I just want to make stuff that you guys find valuable this is the game this is the stuff that I'd actually

[13:24] Forgive into I'm trying to fix a business model

[13:26] Or I'm consulting with somebody and I hope you find it valuable too

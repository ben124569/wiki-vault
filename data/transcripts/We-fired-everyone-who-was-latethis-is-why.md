[00:00] I've had a massive shift in how I view business and it has fundamentally transformed everything

[00:06] that I'm doing.

[00:07] Hi, my name is Alex Mozi.

[00:10] I own a portfolio of companies that is $85 million a year in revenue and this is purely

[00:14] because I just want to help more people not be broke.

[00:17] So that's the goal.

[00:18] All right, so one of the things I want to tell you two stories that significantly changed

[00:21] my career.

[00:23] All right, hopefully you'll be able to take the message from the story because I think

[00:27] they're really, really good.

[00:28] So when I was just starting out in my gym lunch business, I had a gym owner who said,

[00:34] hey, let's partner on this.

[00:35] Like you keep filling these gyms up your full capacity.

[00:37] Why don't you just fill them and I'll come behind you and operate them.

[00:40] And I had a gym that was doing $4.2 million a year.

[00:43] This is what he was telling me.

[00:44] And I really know how to operate the business.

[00:46] You know all the acquisition stuff.

[00:47] So let's just partner up on this.

[00:48] And I said, sure, sounds very enough.

[00:50] It ended up being a horrible partnership, but that's not the point in the video.

[00:52] The point is what I learned.

[00:54] All right, and so we had two locations and the newest location had a whole new staff.

[00:58] And they were just lack of days ago, right?

[00:59] They weren't caring.

[01:01] They weren't really doing a good job.

[01:03] And he said, we need to have a meeting.

[01:07] And I was like, OK, and so he said, what have a meeting at the first location?

[01:10] Call everyone there.

[01:12] Tell them to show up at 4 o'clock.

[01:13] And the first location was probably like 45 minutes away from the second location.

[01:18] And at 4 o'clock.

[01:19] So everyone's coming in.

[01:21] Everyone's sitting down.

[01:22] It's kind of awkward at its silent.

[01:23] There's clearly like some tension, right?

[01:25] And so at 4 o'clock, he looks at his assistant.

[01:27] And he says, hey, go down to the front, block the door, right?

[01:30] Of the gym.

[01:31] And she's like, OK, so she goes and locks the door.

[01:34] Mind you, some people hadn't shown up to the meeting yet.

[01:37] There were a couple minutes late, whatever.

[01:39] And so all of a sudden, as they lock the door, like 30 seconds later, someone's

[01:42] like banging on the door and it's like, hey, open the door.

[01:45] And he's like, ignore him.

[01:46] And they were like, why aren't you letting me in?

[01:49] Because obviously, there's a meeting going on, right?

[01:50] And then another person comes, knocks on the door.

[01:52] Another person comes, knocks on the door.

[01:53] And then there's like three or four people, and they're like, what the hell?

[01:55] Why aren't you letting the door, whatever?

[01:56] So he tells his assistant, he says, go outside and tell him they're all fired.

[02:00] And he says this before he starts the meeting.

[02:02] And so I'm sitting there, right?

[02:03] And everyone in the room is like, oh shit, right?

[02:08] He just set the tone, right?

[02:12] And he reset the bar.

[02:14] And I remember witnessing this and being like, wow.

[02:17] So what he did was he reset the bar of this is how we perform.

[02:20] When we say we're going to be somewhere, we're going to be somewhere at that time.

[02:23] If we say we're going to clean up after the session, we're going to clean up after

[02:25] the session.

[02:26] We say we're going to fall up with leads, we fall up with leads.

[02:29] And what I have figured, and I'm going to tell you one more story, and then I'm going to

[02:32] tell you the moral above them.

[02:33] So pause on that for a second.

[02:35] Now, when I had my first job, I was actually, I think it was my first job.

[02:40] I was a blender tender at Smith-The-King.

[02:43] And so I learned a lot about what to do and not to do when I was at the business.

[02:46] I said it was a small business owner.

[02:47] And I think he had two locations, three locations at the time.

[02:49] His name was Dave.

[02:50] Really nice guy.

[02:51] It's up to him.

[02:52] And I was trained personally by Dave.

[02:53] So Dave trained me.

[02:55] And I was enterprising young man.

[02:57] I wanted to do a good job.

[02:58] And so I showed my first day at work at one of his new locations.

[03:02] After between people walking in, you were supposed to like mop the floor, clean the counters,

[03:06] like just make it look good, restock the shelves.

[03:09] And so I started doing that.

[03:10] I went someone to walk out the door.

[03:11] It's my first shift.

[03:12] And the manager was like, what are you doing?

[03:14] I was like, I was like, I was worried.

[03:15] I was in trouble.

[03:16] So I was like, I thought I was supposed to restock the shelves.

[03:19] I thought I was supposed to do that right now because there's no one here.

[03:22] And he was like, oh, yeah.

[03:24] He only knew worried about that.

[03:25] He's like, we don't do any of that stuff.

[03:26] And I was like, oh, okay, boom, new cultural norm.

[03:31] All right.

[03:31] So what I was supposed to do and what the owner had trained me to do.

[03:35] And then was always complaining about how no one ever did what was supposed to do.

[03:38] The manager was telling me that I didn't need to do that stuff.

[03:40] What I learned from this, right?

[03:42] And I'll just call that manager John, right?

[03:44] Actually, I'll call that manager Vince.

[03:46] This is the name I'll use.

[03:47] So I said, so do you, in your business, have events?

[03:52] Are you the Vince in your business?

[03:54] Do you have someone in your business that's the Vince that's secretly destroying your business?

[03:58] All right?

[03:59] So let's rewind to the original story about the first year mode that I was talking about.

[04:02] So think about the difference between both those styles of management.

[04:06] I'm not saying the first is right or the second is right, whatever.

[04:08] The second is definitely wrong, right?

[04:10] But when you look at that, what it was was setting the tone.

[04:15] And the reason that my views on business have dramatically shifted is that I have always had

[04:20] a tendency to lean towards strategy, acquisition, monetization, pricing structures, and all

[04:24] of that stuff is important.

[04:26] But I think within a business, there are two components to it.

[04:29] You've got the smarts, and you've got the hearts, and you have to have both.

[04:34] And I think that most people overestimate the importance of smarts, myself included.

[04:38] And I think that there's a lot to do with the hearts.

[04:41] Because business strategy overarachingly is not that complex.

[04:44] But I like you really think about, right?

[04:45] It's like, you gotta find something that's good that people want.

[04:49] And you sell it for a lot more than it costs you to do it.

[04:51] And you do as much of that as you possibly can.

[04:53] Like that's kind of the idea, right?

[04:55] And the thing is, is it gets lost in the execution.

[04:59] It gets lost in the doing, right?

[05:01] As soon as you hire your first employees, like, no, I'm slowly scanning.

[05:03] Boys can't do what I can do.

[05:05] It's like, well, that's a horrible belief.

[05:06] She probably changed that before we tried them before.

[05:07] That's a limiting belief, right?

[05:08] If you want to have a big business.

[05:10] And so when I think about this from a cultural standpoint, and this is what has shifted for

[05:13] me, is that it's become so much more about the soft skills.

[05:17] It's so much more about coaching and developing the leaders of the company.

[05:21] It's so much more about addressing behavioral dynamics of someone that are limiting them.

[05:26] More so than it is about tinkering.

[05:28] And I can't help but think that so many entrepreneurs, myself included, I spent so much

[05:32] time tinkering and tweaking things.

[05:35] And what if we change this in our sense process?

[05:37] What if we change this on this page?

[05:38] What if we change the offer like this?

[05:39] What if we change this on the price?

[05:40] What if the payment turns blah blah blah blah.

[05:41] All these different things, right?

[05:43] And think about this for a second for yourself.

[05:44] How many things have you tinkered with in your business over the last half of the year?

[05:47] How many months?

[05:48] And your business hasn't changed at all, right?

[05:51] Because the real problem is not the strategy.

[05:54] The problem is not the smarts, right?

[05:56] The problem is the heart, right?

[05:57] The people are not doing what you want them to do because they don't understand why they

[06:00] need to do it and why it's important, right?

[06:02] And that's the soft stuff.

[06:03] And you've got people who don't want to talk to each other because they don't like each

[06:06] other because one guy's really annoying.

[06:08] And so it's like it would be a better serve you to fix that problem than to try and come

[06:12] up with some new strategy, right?

[06:14] The problem I'm realizing that has been one of the biggest breakthroughs that I've had in

[06:16] my career, those two stories should illustrate the difference between having a championship

[06:21] mentality and having a lose mentality and what might be going on in your business.

[06:24] And I'll leave you with one more story real quickly.

[06:26] So if any of you has ever been on a championship team, right?

[06:31] If you've ever played in a sports arena or whatever and you've been on a winning team, you've

[06:36] been on a losing team, right?

[06:37] And you've probably been on a losing event a lot of good players, but you guys were

[06:40] not connected, you weren't concerted, you weren't aligned, right?

[06:42] On the flip side, you had a winning team and it was like everyone tried up to practice.

[06:46] Everyone tried their hardest.

[06:47] It was the effort and the consistency and the alignment of the team that accomplished the

[06:51] goal.

[06:52] The rules are the same.

[06:53] Everyone was trying to do the exact same thing.

[06:55] And so when you think about the entire business landscape, right, your competitors have

[06:59] access more or less to the same talent pool that you do.

[07:03] They can see what your strategy is overall and most people are not that dumb, right?

[07:07] And so as long as you have a relatively sound strategy, like you're not selling things

[07:10] that are lost, right?

[07:12] Then the difference between the two is going to be your ability to execute and have people

[07:15] execute on your behalf.

[07:17] And so that's going to be come down like for us to see, we do shift towards becoming

[07:20] championship team coaches, which is why John Wood and if he had run a business would have

[07:24] had a championship business because he focused on the fundamentals.

[07:27] And one of my favorite things all time is, advance people never don't do the basics.

[07:32] Advanced people never don't do the basics.

[07:34] I would go to these stages and I would watch guys get on stage and they say, you know, we

[07:38] follow up with all of our leads, you know, within five minutes.

[07:41] You know, when we get on sales calls, we always ask them why they're there, we label them

[07:43] a problem, you know, we overview some of the past things they've done and then they

[07:46] they follow a clear framework.

[07:48] Then as soon as someone buys, we, you know, we have a good onboarding process.

[07:51] And nothing they say is revolutionary.

[07:53] It's just that they actually do it and the people are actually only behalf.

[07:57] They're not the Vince or don't have a manager like Vince who's telling them they don't

[08:01] that they shouldn't have to do that work, right?

[08:02] Who's sabotaging the business.

[08:04] Well, they did as they set the tone and then they carry the bar.

[08:09] And so their job is to be intolerant of anything with excellence and to reinforce that

[08:13] in the culture so that it's consistently executed across the company because that between

[08:17] two companies with the same strategy will make the difference to somebody who use disproportionate

[08:21] returns and advertising crazy profits.

[08:24] Good growth.

[08:25] Great retention on employees, low turnover from a company that doesn't have that, right?

[08:30] Even though they both have the same strategy or even if the smaller company has the

[08:34] better strategy, this guy will win.

[08:36] And this has been one of the most profound shifts that I've had as a CEO now owner of

[08:40] companies is when I'm looking for is I'm looking for just as much soft, if not more,

[08:44] soft skills, interpersonal dynamics, self awareness than I look for skill in particular, you

[08:51] know, like this guys really get a finance, which is a really good product.

[08:53] This person's really got it marking sales.

[08:55] Like I'm looking way more for character traits now and now that if think about it, when you,

[08:59] if you're thinking about yourself, right, then I would look in the mirror and say like,

[09:03] am I really, are we always doing the basics?

[09:06] Because if we always do the basics, we will be advanced because that is what advanced people

[09:10] do is they never don't do them and they have a culture that reinforces that standard.

[09:14] So I hope you enjoy the first story.

[09:15] I hope you enjoy the vent story.

[09:16] Make sure you don't have any ventzis in your business.

[09:18] My name is Alex Shmozi.

[09:19] I'm a portfolio company that is like a set earlier that does 85 million revenue.

[09:22] Lots of broke people in this channel to make sure that you are not one of them.

[09:25] Keeping awesome clicks of travel and I'll see you in the next video.

[09:27] Bye.

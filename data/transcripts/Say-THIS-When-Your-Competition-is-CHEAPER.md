[00:00] Yeah, so we lost like we lost like a couple deals the past couple weeks

[00:04] to companies that are charging like $200 a month. You know, a retainer and we're like

[00:11] we're fucking better than these. We're so much better than these companies. We give more

[00:16] or we code better. Everybody can make them more money and they're like, you can go with this company

[00:22] and it goes $200 a month. So I would so so teach it. So if you were if you were on the phone

[00:26] and you were like, hey Alex, there's this guy down the street for $200 a month. I'd be like,

[00:31] hey man, I was like, what are you so personal training for? $200 a month.

[00:37] Right. We're a personal training for, right?

[00:40] I mean, you the guy would tell me you'd be like, I don't know, 80 bucks an hour.

[00:43] My cool. I got a kid down the street. I'll do it for 10 bucks.

[00:47] Who's training? Do you think it's better?

[00:50] Why do you think he's got a charge 10?

[00:52] Right.

[00:54] Go to pay for it. And so that being said, if you want to go there, the thing is, if you spend $200 again,

[00:59] nothing is that a better investment than spending a thousand and getting 10x on it.

[01:04] So is it really a cost if we're looking at how much money we're going to make?

[01:07] When you invest in a stock or you're like, well, Amazon's more expensive than than Bank of America,

[01:13] it's priced at value. It's like prices what you pay values what you get, right?

[01:19] If you're getting shit for $200, it's still a bad investment.

[01:24] That's how you break. Right. Well, pricing comparison.

[01:28] Yeah, one of my favorites is like, well, shit, man, why didn't you go with them?

[01:31] Yeah. Like, they're only like shit, man, when you, but like, yeah, one case in areas, like,

[01:37] we did the call with the guy first in the next day. He's like, I got another company I'm talking with.

[01:42] So, uh, you know what? Then we followed up with me. He's like, yeah, I want with them.

[01:47] Because they're like, you know, $100 a month, we're like, that's fine. And it happens. The thing is,

[01:51] this hillby back, right? Yeah. But the other side of it is, uh, because here's candidly, they have

[01:56] no way to acquire customers. You know the reality, but do to keep them for a fucking year,

[02:02] it's $2400. Right. He's not competition. That's kind of my point here. But yeah, even if it were,

[02:09] and this did come up, right? One of my favorite clothes is called the comparison clothes, right?

[02:13] Which I say, all right, let's pretend prices in an option. All right. Let's say we're both

[02:17] price of the exact same amount. Which one did you rather do? They're going to say you, right? I'd be like,

[02:23] why? And then they're going to be like, well, you know, I like the fact that you guys got the coaching

[02:27] thing, uh, I mean, I like some higher ticket that's that kind of makes more sense to me. They'll start telling

[02:32] you why. And you're like, right, you're like anything else, you keep going. Anything else? Any other reasons?

[02:36] Anything I'm like, I'm like, ROI, what about risk? What about like track record? Any of those things,

[02:41] well, yeah, I guess that's where they're like, right. And for that reason, you can understand why we're

[02:44] not $20. It's you let them sell you on the reason of why they would rather do you. They spend three

[02:51] minutes telling you about why you're better. You're like, right, you can understand why we're not

[02:54] $20. Yeah. But I like the stock example because it's like the price of the stock is a relevant.

[03:00] It's what you get for what you pay. If you pay $20, you flush it down the toilet. Is that a good deal?

[03:06] You pay $1,000, you get 10 back. Is that a good deal? Of course. So the price is nothing to do with

[03:14] our discussion, but everything you do with how likely you are to hit your goal. That's good. I like

[03:20] you do you think you are to hit your goal and how important is your time? Do you want to waste three

[03:25] more months not hitting your goal, trying another Mickey Mouse thing? Do you think if he was really

[03:29] the best in the industry? Like, let's be real for a second. Do you think if he was the best in the

[03:33] industry? The most likely to help you hit your goal, he would charge you the same amount as a

[03:37] fucking boot camp client? Yes or no?

[03:44] Of course not. So then why do you think it would be reasonable that he'd be better?

[03:50] Of course he's not. So the question is, are you going to get burned twice today, right?

[03:55] Or do you want to buy nice, you can buy nice or buy twice, right? It's up to you.

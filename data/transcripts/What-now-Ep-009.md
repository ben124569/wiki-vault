## Full Transcript
[00:00] You just spent two years of your life dedicated in this book and blew the watch out of the water.

[00:04] So what now?

[00:09] Today we're gonna be going to four different podcasts to talk about what's next for the brand and beyond.

[00:15] Thank you.

[00:18] Can I have a piece of gum?

[00:19] I'll let you last one. I'm not gonna do that too.

[00:21] No? No? No?

[00:23] I will never take a man's last piece of gum.

[00:25] No, it's crude and unusual.

[00:26] Thank you.

[00:27] Hello.

[00:27] The last piece is always a holy piece.

[00:29] I would have done this with them and like, just what it.

[00:33] Lady in the trim stop.

[00:36] Man.

[00:36] That's wrong.

[00:37] You're letting ring his rubber.

[00:38] Yeah.

[00:39] The other ring you'd like you'd get a little tight while I was sleeping and I would end up taking off while I'm asleep.

[00:43] And I'd be like, where is it?

[00:44] Mark, you are ridiculously good at writing instruction manuals for how to make money.

[00:49] But if people don't know how to think and they've got a life structure that doesn't make any sense and they're wasting time on the social media or even just a friend group that is going nowhere fast.

[00:58] What advice do you have for them to get back to the fact of that?

[01:02] One of my favorite quotes from BF Skinner, who was at BF Psychologist from Way back in the day, was,

[01:06] you can lead in a horse to water but you can't make a drink.

[01:08] He said, well, if you bleed it out enough and you starve it and you leave it in the sun and you put the water right in front of it,

[01:13] it's mouth, he said, I can very deeply guarantee that I can make a drink.

[01:16] And so, if you were to think about yourself as that horse, then it's like, okay, well, what is the equivalent of the bloodletting, the dehydration, the starving,

[01:24] that you can put yourself into, get the behavior you want.

[01:26] So, starving has a negative connotation but we can also starve out the negative things in your life.

[01:33] Like you can starve the alcohol, you can starve the friends and I think the easiest way to do that is to get out of the environment you're in.

[01:39] I think this was an atomic habits.

[01:41] In Vietnam, like I think there's like 10% of troops or something, we're taking heroin when they were over there in the 70s.

[01:47] And they thought there would be this massive problem when they came back to the States.

[01:50] But when they came back to the States, almost no one continued the heroin habit.

[01:54] And so, going from Vietnam, we were doing heroin to the US, we were not taking heroin, had a 90% success rate,

[02:00] whereas the inverse is true of recovery centers in the United States today.

[02:04] People go there and 90% of them relapse on the go back home.

[02:07] And so, the difference is that people were doing heroin in a different environment, and then they changed their environment,

[02:12] and then they never went back to the environment that they did heroin at.

[02:14] To be fair, I think the reason a lot of people kind of like some of the content that I put out from money making perspective is,

[02:19] how can an operationized this word?

[02:21] Like, patients, for example, is one of the people throughout a lot.

[02:23] But for me, defining patience was helpful, which is figuring out what to do in the meantime.

[02:28] Like, that's patience.

[02:30] Like, I'm not patient. It's like, no, you're going to figure out what to do in the meantime.

[02:33] I think these are like mental models around using emotions to fuel the behaviors that you want.

[02:40] So, me defining amorphous terms, like confidence, winning respect, loyalty, sadness, anxiety,

[02:48] have come from my own desire to understand the words, and reading the dictionary definitions and feeling like they don't provide much, and they can't help me.

[02:58] What is love?

[03:00] And, you know, people are like, it's a feeling that that doesn't help me.

[03:02] How do I operationalize this word?

[03:04] Love for me, how much are you willing to sacrifice to maintain a relationship?

[03:08] That is how you can measure love.

[03:10] You could use an example of like, man, that guy works on that piece of crap, Carl, the time.

[03:14] Who most really love it?

[03:15] Right? Like, he's willing to sacrifice a lot to maintain that thing.

[03:19] To the same degree, many people would sacrifice everything for their kids.

[03:22] Now, there's plenty of times where they don't like their kids, but they'd be willing to die for their children.

[03:26] You might be willing to die for your country.

[03:28] And so, when I define these terms, it has been out of my own self-interest to learn how to navigate life better.

[03:34] You just did a book launch.

[03:36] It was unreal.

[03:38] I mean, really, like, blue people's minds, set a standard, or what did you demonstrate in the way that you did that?

[03:43] That other people don't understand.

[03:46] With each book, I wanted to demonstrate the concept of the book with the book itself.

[03:50] Since the concept of the book was to advertise and to get lots of leads, then I thought it would be appropriate to advertise and get lots of leads.

[04:01] And I used every method in the book.

[04:03] I ran ads for it, even though I didn't need to run ads.

[04:06] We still got 137,000 people from ads.

[04:08] We had a fillet.

[04:09] We got 104,000 people there from affiliates.

[04:11] We had 27,000 affiliates from both the book.

[04:12] We had customer referrals.

[04:13] People sent their friends there.

[04:14] So I had an incentive that if you just get 10 people to come, you'll get two bonus chapters that aren't released with the book.

[04:19] And so, you know, the next book, I'll try and continue that meta theme of, I have concepts in this book.

[04:25] And I will show you that they work because I will use them to market promote them.

[04:29] Tell me, and the another strip, it says, the one of zero, what does that mean?

[04:33] So one of zero's a brand that I'm really passionate about.

[04:37] The concept, one of zero, actually, came from my media team.

[04:40] You know, we talked about content in general as one of one content.

[04:42] Like, we try to make content that only we can make.

[04:44] And that's actually one of my big marketing rules.

[04:46] So that, say what only you could say, show it only you can show.

[04:49] As we were approaching the event, the team learned more and more about what we were going to be giving away and how much we're putting into it.

[04:54] And they're like, dude, this isn't even one of one.

[04:56] This is one of zero.

[04:57] And that statement just clicked.

[05:00] And then everyone latched onto it because it wasn't about just doing what only we could do.

[05:04] It was doing what no one else would do.

[05:06] You'll get one of zero, one divided by zero from a mathematical perspective.

[05:09] And I think a lot of that is stuff that I resonate with, which is doing work that no one else will do is doing the things that other people will tell you not to do.

[05:17] And for going the should and the musts and the half-tos that people around you tell you to do,

[05:22] because they want to project their life and their exhibitions on yours,

[05:26] but you want to live in direct contrast to that because you want to be your own person.

[05:32] And be beyond definition and let your actions be the only thing that defined you.

[05:37] One of one is doing things that only you can do, but one of zero is doing things that you're not even sure you can do yet.

[05:43] Appreciate you, man.

[05:44] Let's take a look at the action.

[05:45] What is the Chick-Play order?

[05:47] I go 12 count, grilled nugs, 4 count, fried tenders, and then a spicy chicken to lock no cheese with Chick-fil-A sauce and ranch.

[05:58] That's to go too.

[06:00] You can only chew between one sauce.

[06:03] Out of every restaurant.

[06:05] It would be a must-tok here, the person you ever saw.

[06:10] It's a good one.

[06:11] It also has nutritional value.

[06:13] It's a good one.

[06:14] It's a good one.

[06:15] It's a good one.

[06:16] What's the sign of a good podcast interview for you?

[06:20] Number one is my rapport with the host.

[06:23] If work comfortable, then automatically the conversation is going to be better.

[06:27] The second thing is how much they know about me and our stuff.

[06:31] If I'm doing like recaps, it's less interesting.

[06:34] If I were to do a third and fourth thing, it is quality of the follow-on questions.

[06:38] Because there are some people who have like these are 12 questions that I will ask Alex.

[06:41] They ask a question.

[06:42] I answer the question then they say question two.

[06:44] And they don't dive deeper into it, which to me makes it seem like they're not listening.

[06:49] Because then it's not a conversation.

[06:51] It's really just like 12 short clips.

[06:52] The last one is really their ability to let silence exist.

[06:58] I will say that I have noticed this about the best podcast host.

[07:01] Is that like they will ask a question.

[07:03] And then I might answer.

[07:05] And they will just sit at the end of that and then give me another second or two.

[07:10] And then I might add something to it.

[07:11] That might be the real nugget or crystallization of thinking.

[07:15] And if you have a really rushed cadence in terms of how that conversation is going,

[07:19] it becomes more difficult to have thoughtful responses.

[07:22] Oh wow.

[07:27] It's actually stuck.

[07:29] How's it going, man?

[07:30] It's me, man.

[07:31] What are you learning about last year?

[07:33] The hardest work I have done has been my redefining winning.

[07:36] I think for me that is like that has been my big unlock for how much effort I could put in to make better and keep pushing.

[07:41] So I think one of the hardest things as an entrepreneur or just an individual is shifting how you define winning for yourself.

[07:48] And it's easy to say it.

[07:49] And so of course I'm in the game.

[07:50] I'm winning.

[07:51] It's much harder to actually believe that.

[07:54] And so it's easy to make the Instagram quote but it's hard to live it.

[07:57] And what's been interesting for me is that I feel like it's unlocked at different level of work ethic.

[08:01] I thought that the fear of the gun to your head still the strongest motivator and it is in the short term.

[08:06] But if you need to run a marathon, then you need to have something that is going to sustain for a longer period of time.

[08:12] Like punishment is always stronger the short term.

[08:14] The word is always longer in the long term.

[08:15] And so we have to redefine how we reward ourselves for the work we do.

[08:21] And so since I don't believe in legacy and I don't believe that in 5,000 years, people are going to remember who I am.

[08:27] I had to make winning working as hard as I could on something.

[08:32] How do you measure working as hard as you can tough?

[08:34] I think about a future version of myself who has all the context of my current situation, my skills, the information available to me, the resources I have.

[08:42] And that man, that feature man knows what perfect work looks like, which is how much effort can I put into this thing and not be distracted and continue to choose a way at this project.

[08:56] It's very hard because it means there's very few projects that I can do if I have that level of work as my new standard.

[09:03] And so if that level of work is the standard and that is what winning is, then I can only do it for a few things.

[09:09] And a lot of things I'm not going to be able to do, which is sad in some ways.

[09:12] But I think it necessary trade-off because like we have one human life.

[09:15] Here, band.

[09:17] No strip.

[09:19] Ready.

[09:20] I tested a different bag to get the bag that I have.

[09:23] I wear one pair of shorts and one beater.

[09:26] If I want to conserve space, I can do two to one.

[09:28] So I can do two beaters per one pair of shorts.

[09:30] I can wear shorts twice.

[09:31] I don't know.

[09:32] I'm risk A like that.

[09:33] I bring those strips.

[09:34] And I usually have one flannel or button down that I bring with me.

[09:37] And I wear the same shoes that are appropriate in all venues.

[09:40] I can wear them the gym.

[09:41] I can wear them to a restaurant.

[09:42] I can wear them on stage.

[09:43] That makes packing take less than a minute for me.

[09:46] And that's how I like it.

[09:47] And so I can pretty much work until the moment we have to leave.

[09:49] And I just throw my two beaters in and my shorts.

[09:52] And I'm good to go.

[09:53] The first time you put them on, you're like, this is not going to make it better.

[09:56] If you ever have breathing problems, whenever you've got like a good line of air, you're like,

[10:00] don't fuck with it.

[10:01] You're like, just let it go.

[10:03] So you go here and just destroy all of the good stuff.

[10:06] And then you see your first breath and you're like, I didn't know I could breathe so well.

[10:11] I didn't know Ant the air could be so sweet.

[10:15] This studs.

[10:16] It's not man.

[10:17] What up, council.

[10:19] We need to do something about billionaires.

[10:22] I am proposing that the city of Los Angeles,

[10:25] banned billionaires from the beach.

[10:28] What do you think is the biggest mistake content creators make today?

[10:31] Not being them.

[10:32] Basically getting taken over by the algorithm and then like talking about blue trees when they don't

[10:37] actually fuck with blue trees.

[10:38] Right.

[10:39] But they did it because they did one blue tree post and people.

[10:41] Right.

[10:42] So it had to.

[10:43] And so they got a lot of likes and they're like, maybe I'll start making more stuff on blue trees.

[10:46] But like then they go down that alleyway for six months or a year and then I'm like the blue tree channel.

[10:51] Like I can care about trees.

[10:52] Like that's not even the stuff I like talking about.

[10:54] I can actually sustain it because the biggest brands are built over decades not days or weeks or months.

[10:58] A secret confession.

[10:59] The majority of my newsfeed almost all of it is comedians.

[11:03] And that's because I like comedy and I think comedy and philosophy are probably one of two great interests in terms of the things that I consume.

[11:10] Because they are the two the two truth tellers of society is philosophers and comedians.

[11:15] I love what they do.

[11:16] And I also think like what more philanthropic line of work can you have then to just bring joy to people.

[11:25] And I think that's really cool.

[11:26] And I have a lot of admiration for the craft.

[11:28] And so I'd like to do more stuff in that arena if the comedic world will be happy.

[11:32] As of this morning both 100 dollar offers and 100 dollar leads are on Amazon charts.

[11:37] So top 20 books on all Amazon.

[11:39] We have two of them.

[11:40] We beat Harry Potter.

[11:41] Take that JK.

[11:46] I'm kidding you're amazing and I'm a huge fan of your work.

[11:48] I'll say American chicken rice is like man.

[11:50] I got to go off the sword.

[11:52] Got to go in the least in style.

[11:54] Some JJ Kabbab.

[11:55] You know you know.

[11:59] Hello.

[12:00] Hello.

[12:01] You're good.

[12:02] You need to get back in the gym.

[12:03] I know.

[12:04] I can leave out a little bit of the challenge for you is going to be you continue to grow and experience and deep deeper into not becoming a repetitive asshole.

[12:13] Yeah.

[12:14] Yeah.

[12:15] You know exactly what I mean.

[12:16] Because you are the best friend.

[12:18] And you've taken that title.

[12:20] It took you a while.

[12:21] You were like a rising dude coming up from like he's going to do it.

[12:23] He's going to do it.

[12:24] Now you've done it.

[12:25] And by the way, when I talk to other people this is kind of a consensus.

[12:28] It's not like I'm giving you some compliment.

[12:29] That one else is told you.

[12:30] I've taken you the best right now.

[12:32] Thanks.

[12:33] And I say right now because that's not a title that you can keep long term.

[12:35] Yeah.

[12:36] You keep arguing and fighting for it in the scratch.

[12:38] But you're the best right.

[12:39] You just spent two years of your life dedicated to this book.

[12:42] We spent six hours every day writing in and do the launch out of the water.

[12:45] So what now?

[12:50] More better.

[12:51] We will do more of what we were doing before.

[12:53] We will do it better.

[12:54] I do have my project.

[12:56] You know, one of zero that I'm working on in the background.

[12:59] At the same time, I still have my third book.

[13:00] And I think a lot of a lot of people are going to make a lot of money from it.

[13:03] Which I'm very excited about.

[13:04] And we'll, you know, get more companies and acquisition.com.

[13:06] But I have two big projects that I'm working on.

[13:09] One is the third book.

[13:11] The other is one of zero.

[13:12] And those are kind of the two big projects that I have.

[13:14] The next two years.

[00:00] DUI, Moms in the hospital, I just lost everything.

[00:03] Holy shit, I had nothing.

[00:05] How the fuck am I gonna get out of those?

[00:06] So I was hanging out with my team and they asked me

[00:08] some of the biggest struggles that I had gone through

[00:10] in building the companies that we have now in the walk that we have now.

[00:13] Opening my gym, I thought it was gonna be really cool beyond

[00:15] getting out of sleep and on the floor.

[00:16] I'm like hustling because that's what I thought.

[00:18] Like sound of cool.

[00:18] It was incredibly lonely.

[00:19] I was in a state that I didn't know anyone.

[00:21] In a city I didn't know anyone.

[00:22] In a warehouse that there was cars that would drive over

[00:25] or all night long and it was like a gunshot.

[00:27] It was like, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[00:28] And it was all concrete walls.

[00:30] And there was no AC.

[00:31] And so I was just like, sweat and be awake.

[00:34] And I was working the other hours the next,

[00:36] my first client would get there four o'clock.

[00:37] And my last person would leave at 9 PM.

[00:39] I was just like incredibly sleepless.

[00:40] I lived there.

[00:41] My clients would do my laundry for me.

[00:43] And then I would shower at any fitness.

[00:45] That was hard.

[00:45] That was very hard.

[00:46] After I like built all the gyms up, I got out of that.

[00:49] And then I sold them, put all the money into this new venture

[00:51] and money was gone.

[00:52] The processor got shut down so that I couldn't get the new money

[00:54] that I had made.

[00:55] Just felt like it was quicksand.

[00:56] It was like every time it took a couple steps,

[00:58] I would just sink again.

[00:58] That was very frustrating.

[01:00] This was like the worst six months of my life.

[01:02] It started in October.

[01:03] Mom got sick, went to the hospital.

[01:06] I flew out while I was there to keep myself occupied.

[01:08] I started launching gyms.

[01:09] That's when gyms went to actually start it.

[01:10] Because I left my own gyms.

[01:11] I was like, I got to keep myself occupied.

[01:13] Reach out some people in my hometown.

[01:14] I was like, hey, you ain't anybody.

[01:15] And they're like, yeah, I know a guy.

[01:16] That's how I was like the first big gyms.

[01:19] So I had the mom think.

[01:21] And then I got into DUI.

[01:22] And then the money that I put into the business

[01:25] got taken after I sold all my money.

[01:26] And then the gyms took a whole little,

[01:27] and this new thing because it was working.

[01:29] So now I have like DUI, mom's in the hospital.

[01:32] I just lost everything.

[01:33] We had to do this launch to cover the refunds

[01:35] from the last gym that I had to shut down.

[01:36] And so we got the 100 grand from the first launch.

[01:39] We was able to pay all of the refunds

[01:40] that I was back in zero.

[01:41] I got another launch.

[01:42] Had a 100 grand.

[01:43] That was what got taken by the processors.

[01:45] Because they saw it was like a regular activity.

[01:47] I had six guys selling eight thousand a day

[01:49] and sales that I can't collect on.

[01:50] And I had no money.

[01:52] And so I put it on a credit card.

[01:53] Like this good fucking goal.

[01:54] That was that whole month.

[01:55] The last day of the month I got a processor for 50k.

[01:58] I ran 50.

[01:59] The next day was to be in next month or another 50.

[02:01] So it was a hundred.

[02:02] We did 30 or 40k in profit.

[02:03] And I was like, did I just escaped death.

[02:06] And then the next month, the gyms from January, February,

[02:10] started refining the clients and telling them to sign up with them.

[02:13] It's to then all of that money that I had made

[02:15] and profit the last month.

[02:16] We went back in and we were 150 negative.

[02:18] And I was like, how the fuck am I going to get out of this?

[02:20] Because the thing is, the more I sold,

[02:21] the more I'd have to refund.

[02:22] What is there on the way in that line

[02:24] where you were like, maybe I'm not cut for this?

[02:26] And think about it.

[02:27] I had too many other problems.

[02:29] I was just in so much pain.

[02:30] I just wanted to like get out of it.

[02:31] I just had to pull like something out of my ass.

[02:34] I was why I had this big belief that like,

[02:35] some of the best businesses get made out of desperation.

[02:37] I was a hundred percent backed up.

[02:39] I had nothing.

[02:40] And so that's when we were like, you know what?

[02:42] Jim has been a good run.

[02:43] It was that was when I called the guys up for the next month.

[02:46] And was like, hey, we're out.

[02:47] Sorry.

[02:48] And they were like, can you show us how?

[02:49] I remember saying this to the first guy.

[02:50] I was like, call up my, my getting out of the gym business sale.

[02:54] Selling my secrets.

[02:55] That's how I sell.

[02:56] Selling my secrets of everything I've learned

[02:58] from all my gyms and all my locations

[02:59] and filling up 30 plus gyms and doing turn rounds.

[03:02] I'll give it to you.

[03:02] He was like, how much and I said six grand.

[03:04] I'm still a salesman.

[03:05] I mean, I can recognize what something goes easy.

[03:07] And I was like, fuck.

[03:09] Six, okay?

[03:10] Chef.

[03:11] Done.

[03:11] It was so fast.

[03:12] I was like eight.

[03:13] And it was like, get 10.

[03:15] Yeah, that works.

[03:16] I did 60 grand a day.

[03:17] So I was like, holy shit.

[03:19] I made a hundred K in like four days.

[03:21] And that day was one like we switched to licensing.

[03:24] That was the lead up.

[03:25] And I remember like putting the money into my bank

[03:27] hooks.

[03:27] I didn't have like another location to open or like more equipment to buy.

[03:31] Like that's mine.

[03:32] I'd repaid the processors, employees.

[03:35] I'd pay back the refunds from the close gym.

[03:37] I was clear of everything.

[03:38] And then there was like a hundred grand left.

[03:40] And I was like, a rich.

[03:42] I mean, I remember a buddy of mine calling me

[03:45] because I'd like checked in one of them a couple times.

[03:47] And he knew that was like, just going through a lot.

[03:49] And he called me like a month apart.

[03:51] He's like, how you hold enough?

[03:52] And I was like, bro.

[03:53] I was like, I just made four in a grand last month.

[03:55] And he was like, what?

[03:56] I thought you like had the, he's,

[03:57] is it selling the membership thing?

[03:59] I was like, no, no, no, no, like,

[04:00] selling the membership system.

[04:01] And he was like, dude, running as hard as a can.

[04:03] And we went 480, a million, 1, 2, 1, 5, 1, E, 2.

[04:09] It was nuts.

[04:10] It was literally me, Laila.

[04:11] And we had a, we had an assistant.

[04:12] I was in over the kitchen table.

[04:14] My rent was 1200 bucks.

[04:15] And I told Laila, I was like, I don't know how long

[04:16] it's in the last.

[04:17] That's why I kept our expenses so I was trying to make money.

[04:19] Like, that was it.

[04:20] I'm not trying to build a company.

[04:21] I don't want to make some that's going to change the world.

[04:22] I was like, I'm trying to get rich.

[04:24] I was gasing the shit out of it.

[04:26] Sure, getting away from paying.

[04:28] I had feelings that I didn't want to feel.

[04:30] And so it's just like anything that would make me

[04:32] not feel that way was what I wanted to do.

[04:34] Business became my feel better drug.

[04:35] I really didn't want to be poor again.

[04:37] And I really was getting reinforced heavily

[04:39] by the marketplace that I was good at this thing.

[04:41] And so it just would give me like the plea alignment

[04:43] of just like rocket fuel that way.

[04:45] And then man get this way.

[04:46] We didn't take a vacation.

[04:47] We didn't take weekends.

[04:48] We didn't see friends.

[04:49] We didn't go out.

[04:50] We didn't drink.

[04:51] I drink and fuck this up.

[04:53] I will hate myself.

[04:54] We can go get friends later.

[04:55] I just took everything out of my life that was not this.

[04:58] Like, what about work like bounce?

[04:59] I'm like, people understand how little I gave a fuck.

[05:02] This, just like feeling horrible.

[05:04] And then finally seeing some success.

[05:06] I was like, fuck anything that's not this.

[05:08] Like if every person ever met me at that point

[05:10] was like, fuck you Alex die.

[05:12] I would have been like, fuck him.

[05:13] Like whatever.

[05:14] Like I'm doing this thing.

[05:15] We blew past wealth numbers four, 10, 14, 20.

[05:19] And then the kind of came up frayer past 20

[05:21] when I was like, oh, we have 120 employees.

[05:24] And we have like a company.

[05:25] And then somebody was like, you're company's worth $200,

[05:27] and I was like, really?

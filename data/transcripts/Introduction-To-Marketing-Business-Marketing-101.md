[00:00] What's going on everyone if you've ever struggled to figure out all the different numbers in marketing and figure out what's important?

[00:05] What's not important? What's good? What's bad?

[00:07] And you just can't get your stuff to convert or you can't make you can't make sense of all the stuff.

[00:12] Then this video is for you. Alright? So when I got into marketing there were so many different numbers.

[00:18] KPI, CPL, CPC, like CTRs. I like I was like I was I had no idea my head was spinning. I was trying to figure it out.

[00:25] And over time it's kind of like you start to distill down what are the big buckets of things that matter?

[00:31] And then once you discover those three are then you can open up the drawer and look for more details than one not.

[00:36] And so what I want to do is outline the three numbers that I'm looking at at a high level in any business that I'm looking to invest in or I'm looking to partner with or whatever.

[00:43] Alright? And I'll show you the relationship between them that I am looking for and hopefully that will help you for your own business.

[00:50] So the first number is what my cost of acquisition is, which I call a KAK, alright? It's not my call that's what people call it, right?

[00:57] Cost of acquisition or KAK, right? So how much does it cost me to a core customer? Now this number should include everything.

[01:04] So that means your sales commission that means your ad spend means the marketing team that created the increase whatever.

[01:09] Your software that's associated with it. It's all of the costs of acquisition put together. That is KAK, alright?

[01:16] Number two is LTV. Now I define this a little bit differently because I think it's important.

[01:24] So LTV is not the total revenue that I'm going to get over the life spent of a customer.

[01:29] But for me it's the total gross profit that I'm going to get over the life spent of a customer.

[01:33] So let me give you a simple example. So if I were selling meals for example or selling food, and my cost of delivering food let's say was nine bucks, alright?

[01:44] And I know that someone's going to order $700 a month of food and it cost me nine dollars and I'm selling it for ten.

[01:50] All right? That means only of a 10% margin on gross profit, right? Gross profit on the meal sold.

[01:57] And so $700 of food over the life spent of a customer might sound like a huge LTV.

[02:03] But the reality is it's actually only 70, which is what I'm going to make on that customer, right?

[02:10] And so the reason I use gross profit is that if I were doing marketing for food for example, and you know my marketing was like, hey man, we're spending $200 to a car customer who's going to pay a $700.

[02:21] I would be like, that's horrible because we only make $70 on the 700, which means that we're spending 200 to make 70.

[02:27] Right? And that's why it's so important to understand the gross margin of your business, right?

[02:33] Because this is where all of your decisions should be based off of, alright? It's on that margin.

[02:38] The third number is what I call 30-day cash, all right? Now in the formal business world, the fancy world, they call this, they use a different metric.

[02:51] They call it payback period, which is how long does it take you to payback? You're cost-to-back position, right?

[02:56] Because inherently, whenever you're getting a customer, there's usually a cost that's put into it.

[03:00] And that cost might, there's always a cost, either paying in time or paying in money or you're paying in someone else's time, which is in payroll,

[03:06] but there's always a cost, right? There's a cost of acquiring a customer, and then you have the payback period.

[03:13] I use 30-day cash for this reason. I think that virtually every business can gain access to a credit line,

[03:22] which means a credit card or an MX or even a bank can do loan you, whatever, where over 30 days they can use that money and then pay it back,

[03:31] virtually interest-free credit cards are all interest-free for the first 30 days, all right, at least all the ones I'm aware of, right?

[03:37] And so what that means is that if I can, if I can know what my 30-day cash value is, and if I can get that to be, at least equal to my cac,

[03:44] then it means that I can use other people's money to acquire customers.

[03:49] And this is why we've had such big growth in the companies that I've had is that I don't actually need to use my own money to acquire customers.

[03:54] I can use someone else's money, acquire them, get the money in the first 30 days to pay back the debt,

[04:00] and now I'm left over with customers, and ideally customers and profit that I can still continually upsell into continuity.

[04:06] If you can understand the words that I'm saying right now, you'll understand how big a deal this is.

[04:11] All right, so what are the relationships that I'm looking for?

[04:15] So for me, for LTV, like, from looking at it, because there's different relationships that I need to draw here,

[04:21] and when I'm looking about how the marketing's working.

[04:24] All right, so my LTV to cac ratio, I want to always have greater, greater than 3-to-1.

[04:34] All right, 3-to-1 is the number that I am looking for, which means that I need to be able to generate more than three times the cost of acquisition in gross profit.

[04:47] All right, so that means let's say my gross profit, I'll get a number another number.

[04:51] Let's say that my gross profit on a service that I sell is 80%.

[04:57] All right, we use that as number.

[04:58] And so it's 80% is my gross profit, and I have a thousand dollar lifetime.

[05:05] All right, that's how much they're going to spend with me over the lifetime, which means $800 is what I am going to use as my number.

[05:13] Now, if $800 is what I make, then I have to, 3-to-1, be able to acquire customers for less than $270 or $165.

[05:24] $66, right?

[05:26] So my cost of acquisition has to be less than $266, all right?

[05:32] That's the total thing.

[05:34] Now, that's the first relationship that I'm going to look at.

[05:39] The next relationship that I'm going to look at is the 30-day cash requirement compared to my cash.

[05:47] And so for me, if I have a 1-to-1 relationship between my 30-day cash and my cash,

[05:59] then that means that I am breaking even on getting customers, all right?

[06:06] And I'm breaking even within a window that I can use other people's money to finance the acquisition.

[06:11] And that's where this gets super cool, all right?

[06:14] And so using the example that we just had, if $260 is what it has to be under, right?

[06:21] For me to get 3-to-1, then let's say that if I can just get my, ah, if I can get my 30-day cash to be greater than $260,

[06:32] then it means that in the first 30 days, I'm breaking even in my acquisition for free,

[06:38] and then I'm still going to collect the other $500 in whatever dollars.

[06:43] That's remaining from this process.

[06:46] And so those are the two biggest relationships that I'm looking at,

[06:49] which my LCVDCAC ratio and what's my 30-day cash to CAC ratio.

[06:55] All right?

[06:56] I want this to be greater than 3 times what it cost me to acquire a customer,

[07:00] and that is how I know I'll have sufficient profit to grow the business.

[07:03] I want my 30-day cash in my CAC to be at least greater than 1,

[07:08] so that I know that I can use other people's money, OPM, two-quire customers.

[07:15] All right? This is what it looks like visually.

[07:18] The person comes in the business, let's say I pay $200 in CAC, right?

[07:31] So I'm now negative $200.

[07:34] This person now comes into my business.

[07:36] Did to do, you know, they've got their little money, they come into my business.

[07:41] They decide to give me money, right?

[07:45] Now, at this point, this could be, you know, day one,

[07:49] and this could be day seven, whatever, because it depends how long it takes them to give me money, right?

[07:56] And so maybe they first time to give me money, they only give me 50 bucks, right?

[07:59] I'm still negative.

[08:01] But by day 30, let's say I have another upsell, or two,

[08:07] and at this point now I've made $200 on this customer.

[08:14] What this means is that now, I've covered my cost of acquisition,

[08:23] and then at the end of this point, I'm going to continue to sell them,

[08:28] or they continue to buy, let's say it's on recurring, day 60, day 90, day 120, et cetera,

[08:34] and I was able to break even to then get all of this money that happens on the back end for free.

[08:41] That is the power of this concept.

[08:43] And so to summarize this, the three numbers that you need to always know when you're marketing is going to be your cac,

[08:49] it's going to be your LTV, important point is that it's the gross profit, not the total revenue,

[08:55] and the 30-day cash that you can make per customer.

[09:00] And you need to break even on 30-day cash to cac, and you want this to be at least three times greater than your cost of acquisition

[09:07] for you to have a viable business, and that is the game that I try to play.

[09:13] So I hope that was valuable for you. I hope when you're looking at your business money,

[09:15] you're looking at your marketing, and you have these metrics, you can make decisions empirically quantitatively,

[09:20] and the nice thing is if something's below these metrics, then you just know that you have to fix it.

[09:25] Is there an upsell? Is there some sort of liquidation thing? Can we give them some sort of special offer in their first week or two?

[09:31] Can we sell them ancillary products, and we have an affiliate relation, can we refer stuff out in order to increase this 30-day cash?

[09:36] The reason this is important is if I can make this really, really big, then it means I can spend more to acquire on customers,

[09:43] which means I can even open up further my acquisition net, and still make more money.

[09:48] Obviously the amount that you've had your 30-day cash is still going to add into your total lifetime value of the cash to them.

[09:54] So I hope that was all for you. Hope this makes sense for your business.

[09:57] This is how I think through these things, and I hope you do too. Have an amazing day, enjoy, and I'll see you in the next video.

[00:00] If I'm an entrepreneur and I'm growing my business month over month,

[00:03] when should I, one start taking money, and two,

[00:07] when should I start actively investing?

[00:10] These are the questions I get most frequently with the entrepreneurs that I speak with,

[00:14] who, depending on where their app they might have,

[00:17] 500,000, a million, two million dollars in the bank,

[00:19] and they're like, I'm not really sure what I should do.

[00:21] And so what I wanted to do is walk you through the thought process that I had around investing,

[00:26] to give you a little bit of some framework to think through that,

[00:29] help me make the system make your process a lot easier.

[00:31] So first off, I'm a big believer in continuing to take dividends out of a business,

[00:35] as a continues to grow.

[00:36] And that's because you want to decrease your downside risk, right?

[00:39] Because for some reason, and the statistics are very likely that the business will not succeed in the long term.

[00:44] You know, 90, whatever, it's 90% or 95% of businesses fell within five years.

[00:48] And so it's much better in my opinion to consistently take money out of the business as you're growing it,

[00:54] because there's a very high likelihood that it will not stick around.

[00:57] A and b, many entrepreneurs have this idea that they're going to sell their business for some magical number.

[01:01] Sometime in the future, when in reality only one percent of businesses ever sell.

[01:05] And so if that is the case, again, while I would rather not stack the chips on a 91 to one,

[01:09] but it does happen, but the likelihood is low.

[01:11] And so I would like to take chips off the table on a regular basis.

[01:15] So that is first part, which is making sure that we're taking money out.

[01:18] But the second question is, okay, well now that I have this money,

[01:20] this 500, this million, this whatever, what should I do with it, right?

[01:24] And so one of the big things is I just like to think about this through the lens of opportunity cost,

[01:28] which is if I'm currently making, let's say, a 500,000 year, right, from my business in

[01:34] in Nefri Catholic owner earnings, I get to take out of the business after reinvesting it in the growth

[01:39] and competitive advantage that we need to continue to maintain to grow, right?

[01:42] So if I have 500,000 orders of Nefri Catholics coming to me, and let's say I've got a million

[01:47] dollars saved up, if I were to passively invest that, I should get about 10%

[01:52] ish a year, right?

[01:54] That's just going to be investing through indexes like the S&P 500 etc, right?

[01:58] If I'm doing that, then the advantage of actively investing might be the marginal difference,

[02:03] but it might be an extra 5 or 10%.

[02:05] So that would be a 50% to 100% increase, because 10 to 15% is a 50% increase, right?

[02:11] But if I look at it in terms of real terms, just purely on how much money that worth

[02:15] is going to increase, which is the length of we have to look at this through, which is the

[02:18] opportunity cost, if I were to spend half of my time thinking about actively investing,

[02:23] because it will take up half of your mind space and promises have done this mistake before,

[02:27] I made this mistake before.

[02:29] Then what happens is your active income will fall at a disproportionate rate compared to

[02:34] what your money is making you.

[02:36] So let me walk you through a numbers example.

[02:38] So let's say you've got that million dollars, and you can get 10% of your year, which is 100%

[02:43] a hundred percent passable, right?

[02:45] But the additional 50% or 100,000 dollars a year, 50,000 dollars a year, which would be 5 to 10%

[02:50] of that million, right?

[02:51] You could get through actively investing.

[02:53] Well, if you're currently making 500,000 dollars a year from your business, do you think it would

[02:57] be reasonable to take half or 25% of your time to go chase that when you could probably

[03:02] get your income from 500 to 750,000 in the next year, 500 to a million?

[03:08] And so for me, that was always the opportunity cost of actively investing,

[03:12] which until my wealth became so large that I felt like it was the opportunity cost of the

[03:16] money that I should be making by paying more attention to my money, it was going to outpace my income,

[03:21] which is still almost not there.

[03:22] And so for me, that is why as for entrepreneurs, it's my belief that A, you should be ripping

[03:27] out cash on a regular basis because that's downside risk protection.

[03:30] It's not your upside.

[03:31] It is downside protection.

[03:32] It's the fact that what if my business does not succeed?

[03:35] As much as I'm a big believer in being optimistic, you also have to face reality in

[03:39] confront facts, which is the likelihood that this particular business you're on.

[03:43] I've had 13 businesses that I've started up to this point and now I would eat more.

[03:46] The likelihood that the business that you start is going to be the one that you finish with

[03:49] is extremely extremely low, extremely low.

[03:53] And the likelihood that you're running solid business for a big number is extremely extremely

[03:57] low.

[03:58] And so you take this money out and you put it into the S&P or you put it into an index because

[04:01] it is passive and you can put it there and the ideas that you never have to think about it again.

[04:05] Now, the amount of money that you should keep in cash in my belief is you should have about

[04:10] six months to a year's worth of normal living that's saved up in cash.

[04:14] And that's just so that you can sleep well at night and that's it.

[04:17] The other thing is that when you invest that into your indexes and whatnot, you can always take

[04:20] a loan against those assets if you want to start something big.

[04:22] So it's not like it's illiquid when it's there.

[04:24] You can take loans against those assets at 60 or 70 percent low-end of value meaning if you have

[04:29] a million dollars in assets in the S&P most banks will keep you 60 or 70 percent of that

[04:35] or at least 50 depending on the stocks and your history with them etc.

[04:39] That will give you basically a free.

[04:41] It will give you at 1 percent or 2 percent money that you can go and reinvest this or any

[04:46] other business or buy a piece of real estate or whatever.

[04:48] And so for entrepreneurs, it is my belief that you should be investing most of your time in

[04:53] energy or almost 100 percent of your time in energy and growing your income, growing the main vehicle

[04:58] you have but extracting the money and putting it into a low-brain vehicle that's not active

[05:03] that's passive, that's truly passive, not real estate flipping, that's not passive, right?

[05:07] Truly passive. If you're in crypto, you have some speculative stuff that you want to get into.

[05:13] It's probably taking a way more of your attention than it should be and it's actually going

[05:16] to make your main income suffer, which means your network will grow more slowly than otherwise would.

[05:21] So it's all about the opportunity cost of your attention.

[05:23] All right, now I'm going to put this special note down here for employees.

[05:27] If the primary objective of the employee in my opinion is to increase how much your income is.

[05:32] And so all of yours in this goes for entrepreneurs too, the initial parts of your investment

[05:36] should be growing to increase your skills because that increases your basis. That increases your

[05:40] basic income that you can continue to yield from the marketplace based on your skillset.

[05:43] And so this is where I think people step over dollars to pick up pennies.

[05:48] If you were saving 500 dollars a month, then something wrong with that.

[05:51] But I would be actively investing that 500 or the thousand or two thousand dollars a month

[05:55] in the beginning into making my skills more valuable because I know that if I do that

[05:59] in two years, I might quite troubleman income because that's the thing you said.

[06:02] Your ability to earn is one of the greatest investments that's not just a billionaire saying.

[06:08] It really is like you can like if you develop the skill of selling, which might take you two years,

[06:13] you can go from making 60,000 dollars a year to 250,000 dollars a year or 500,000 dollars a year,

[06:18] which puts you in the top one percent just by earning that one skill.

[06:22] And so if you can develop that skill, it is worth the investment in most investments in self-approvement

[06:26] or so disproportionately low that is worth the investment.

[06:30] Even if there are courses that you only get a handful of things from, you are still as yourself

[06:34] and asset more valuable.

[06:36] At the end of the day, you are the source.

[06:37] You're the source where all the money comes from.

[06:39] So it's like when people don't invest in themselves, it makes no sense to me.

[06:43] I've spent every dollar I possibly could getting access, getting mentorship, getting coaching,

[06:48] getting programs buying courses, buying books and doing that stuff because I'm the source.

[06:53] If I can improve me as the machine that generates all the flow of income,

[06:57] then the rest of the stuff becomes easy.

[06:59] So first and foremost, you have to invest in that.

[07:02] After you have an access of that, then start pulling the dividends out of the business that you have,

[07:06] investing those things that are passive not active.

[07:09] And then at the point where you're networked from your investable assets,

[07:12] what 10 percent of that network growth would be is in access of what you make per year,

[07:16] then at that point it makes sense to start shifting your perspective towards managing wealth

[07:20] and growing wealth rather than growing income.

[07:22] Now, like I said, two employees.

[07:24] Number one is increase your skill basis, meaning continue to invest in gaining skills so that you

[07:28] can be a more valuable company.

[07:29] The way you do that is by tying yourself to revenue streams.

[07:32] That means you find ways to generate the company more money, period.

[07:36] And that can be through a variety of ways.

[07:37] If you're a customer success or customer service or a firmman,

[07:40] then it's going to be, how can I ascend this many customers' response?

[07:42] How can I retain these customers?

[07:44] How can I track these metrics and show to the people who are deciding my competition?

[07:48] How I'm directly making a company more money.

[07:50] Right? And how losing me would cost me a lot more than what it would cost to be keeping.

[07:55] Right? If I'm on the front end side so it's going to be sales,

[07:58] it's going to be marketing, it's be acquisition based.

[08:00] How can I show them what how I can become more valuable?

[08:02] How can I close twice as many deals?

[08:04] How can I close it a higher percent?

[08:05] How can I get more leaflet by working my pipeline better?

[08:08] How can I generate leaves on my own and it's tended from the leaves that they're generating for me?

[08:11] Right? All of those things are things that you can do to increase how much you make.

[08:16] Right? Now, like I said, if you're an employee,

[08:18] there's going to be a certain cap most of the time on what you're earning.

[08:21] And if that is the case in your rubbing against that cap,

[08:23] you should keep your bases for living as low-sumably possible and plow as much that one is possible

[08:29] into a highly liquid asset. Again, if you're in the situation where you're wealth,

[08:35] right, the network that you have is 10% of that amount is still less than you make.

[08:39] Then all of your attention should still be going to your primary and that worth increase

[08:44] certain which will be your income. And so, if I can consolidate this video into a single statement,

[08:48] you should, it's my opinion, spend the majority of your time on the vehicle that will increase

[08:54] your network the fastest. And for most people, it is going to be increasing their income

[09:01] until the point where they have saved sufficient amount of assets that they put in passive,

[09:06] highly liquid things like S&P, S&P, and indexes, etc. And at that point, when the potential

[09:11] to earn an increase here in that worth is faster or greater through the assets that you have,

[09:18] at that point, it makes sense to switch your attention towards growing those assets,

[09:23] because now the opportunity cost is shifted away from where your income is generated first

[09:27] where your wealth is growing. And so, that is my, at what point should you start investing?

[09:33] That is how I break down first investing you increase your skill basis so that you can

[09:38] generate more income. It is the highest return genuinely. I'm not saying that for jargon,

[09:42] it is the highest return that you can get. The second is that you continue to put things into

[09:47] passive, truly passive, not what people claim is passive that are really side hustles,

[09:51] but truly passive businesses so that you can continue to focus on your main income generation.

[09:55] And then, when 10% of your network growth exceeds your income capacity currently,

[10:02] at that point, it makes sense for you to shift your perspective into growing your wealth

[10:06] in rather than your income. So, I hope you found this video valuable, click subscribe and I'll see you

[10:10] in the next video. Bye!

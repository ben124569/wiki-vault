[00:00] The bigger the monster, the greater the hero, the things that we go through work on us more than we work on them.

[00:05] And in this video what I want to write down is the things and how we call the traumatic events that happen

[00:10] and how we view them can change how they affect us and how they create us and shape us as people.

[00:16] And I was recently interviewed in a two-hour podcast with Gramps Def and if you don't know how I am,

[00:19] I'm Alex Ramozi, I'm an acquisition.com. We're going to portfolio companies says about $85 million a year.

[00:23] And so on this podcast, probably the most shared and retweeted and cut section.

[00:27] I'm just a section about to show you. It was where I got into it with one of the other

[00:31] that the interviewer or interviewer of the podcast, talking about trauma specifically and it gets us

[00:36] really deep stuff and I think that you get a lot of value from it. If you've never watched any of our

[00:41] videos, welcome to Most Ignation. Lots of love and I'll see you guys in the next couple seconds.

[00:44] Would you consider yourself emotional? Yeah. I mean, probably. So do I have emotions?

[00:49] God, because a lot of the times at least in my experience like and what I've seen,

[00:53] people that are nihilists, it's easy to, that's like an easy out. If something bad happens,

[00:57] if something good happens, it's just like, oh yeah, that's fine. So we've done the rug. It's

[01:00] not, it's not going to matter. It's any way. So bad happens. And it's not like you actually

[01:03] deal with their process, whatever, you know, event or action occurred that make you felt that emotion.

[01:08] If we believe that we have to, like, why should we? Why should you feel that emotion? Like, why

[01:11] should we process a traumatic event? What does that mean? Well, I do believe that there are,

[01:16] you know, things in your brain biologically, but if they are deprived of something or there's like

[01:22] some bad traumatic event or something like that will affect your biological...

[01:26] romantic versus non-traumatic. I mean, I feel like the definition of the word trauma would probably.

[01:30] But what would be the line between, like, okay, in, like, let's, let's give an example of

[01:36] something terrible. Actually not, because it's a podcast and people might hate a rap. So let's just

[01:39] say something bad happens, that we describe as bad in this culture. And another culture that might

[01:43] not be bad. It's trauma in this culture. It's not trauma in this culture. So if the circumsence is

[01:47] the same, why was it traumatic? Circumsence is more the same. Why not? Because the culture? The

[01:51] facts were the same. Well, we describe the facts as changed, which means that we can choose to

[01:55] call something trauma. But wouldn't, isn't it, doesn't it make sense that people would be

[02:00] built up and due to a culture environment? 40-year-old guy sleeps with a 15-year-old girl.

[02:04] Terrible. We want 200 years. 40-year-old guy sleeps with a 15-year-old girl. 100% normal. How is

[02:08] it trauma now and not trauma that? And mind you. Like, this is not my state. I'm just,

[02:12] you have to pull an extreme example if we're going to talk about trauma to illustrate the concept.

[02:17] So if it's traumatic in one instance and not traumatic in another, then it means that we can

[02:21] basically change the cultural narrative that we're describing to our context and make it not traumatic.

[02:26] That makes sense. Which means it didn't matter. Which means the only thing that matters

[02:28] that you chose to make it meaningful. But let's say like, like, the passing of a parent.

[02:33] Yeah, a love. 100% something like that. If we think we feel like, we have a narrative that says,

[02:38] if I don't mourn, it means I didn't care about them. Right? That's a statement of belief. I could

[02:43] say that if I don't mourn about them, it means I totally cared about them. Like, why does my

[02:47] mourning have any indication of how much I cared? They're non-correlates. Right? But it's just because

[02:51] we have so many of these belief statements that quote society or things that we inherit. But we just

[02:55] choose to say that this is how life is. And so it's, I think it's just like monitoring what those statements

[02:59] are. And so like one of my favorite things probably like if I had one thing on my tombstone,

[03:03] it would be a permutation of a quote by Orson Scott Card, which is, we question all of our beliefs

[03:08] except for those that we truly believe. And those we never think to question. That's a good quote.

[03:13] Right. So it's like, we like, of course, I'm opening to question my beliefs. It's like,

[03:17] what's trauma? Like when someone's like, I was traumatized. It's like, where are you?

[03:20] Or do you just choose to label this trauma? And then I've dealt the rest of your life because

[03:23] you call it trauma. When 200 years ago it was life. And a thousand years ago having your parent

[03:27] code in front of you was just nature. If you want to go biology. And so we're just like, we just

[03:31] choose to create meaning around things. And so like at the end of the day, like end to end and

[03:35] bottom bottom bottom root. Yeah. All our brains do is just create and disruminating. And so we say,

[03:39] this is a threat. This is not a threat. We make like we need to reinforce this favor. We don't need

[03:42] to reinforce this favor all through meaning. And so if you can control what you do,

[03:45] you're demining for, you can massively shift the odds in your favor because you don't need to

[03:49] ascribe meaning to the top. Well, could that be, let's say like like 500 years ago you see like a

[03:53] parent killed in front of you. Yeah. So that because all you have in your mind is like food shelter

[03:58] water. Sure. And now that we have this thing taken care of our minds go to other places.

[04:02] Sure. I just don't think it changes the actual facts. So it's like we have, we have, there's

[04:07] stimulus response. Right. And so like we get control of response. We can control the stimulus.

[04:11] Was it either Seneca or Epictetus who's like, no one yells at a rock. Right. It's like, if you

[04:17] are the rock, then like just doesn't matter. Right. Like you just like eventually like people just

[04:22] rough and just leave you alone. And so like, and if you see stimulus of life that way in terms of like

[04:27] how you deem things or label things traumatic or not traumatic or good or bad, you know what I mean?

[04:30] It's the same thing if I'm sure of like the hate comments and whatnot. It's like if you deem the

[04:33] comments of the fans as meaningful, then you will both care about them being positive and you will

[04:38] care about them being negative. But if they're not meaningful at all to begin with, and like I

[04:42] don't think you can do either. I think you just either have to participate in both sides or you

[04:45] remove. That is also a belief statement. Right. So like maybe you can. So you know, interesting thoughts.

[04:49] So how did you transition from a assume I'm assuming you used to care a little bit more about belief

[04:55] and stuff like that? How did you transition from that to now not caring? And did you have to

[05:00] completely change your mindset to where you're automatic response to things was just like,

[05:05] where do these chains of emotions and like the cultural constraints and stuff like that?

[05:08] That are making me feel this way. Yeah. Did you just switch that lights? Which are do you still

[05:12] on occasion catch yourself slipping? I just did right now. I was like I just said that as a belief.

[05:16] Right. That's right. I figured 100%. Yeah. I mean, I think you systematically, you hear like that's

[05:20] why the talking is so important. Like what words are we using? What are those words mean? Like you

[05:24] say trauma like to find that? What do you mean by that? Which is why like when you hear really

[05:28] good writing that's a happy dynamic? Like the first few pages will be like, we're going to talk

[05:31] about this and this is how we define this and this is how we define this. It's like we're

[05:34] putting constraints around the words that we're using because they mean they they equate to thoughts

[05:37] that are just buckets, right? That we like say a word like trauma and like it means something different

[05:40] to all three of us. That's like we have to real the definition before we can talk about it. Does that make sense?

[05:45] And so no, I had so I I definitely made a conscious effort. So when I was like 19 or 20,

[05:50] I became a born again Christian. The dunk, the whole thing was like, oh my god,

[05:55] life's amazing. Jesus is great. And then I ended up falling away from that because I was like,

[05:59] I don't know if this is true. And then I spent the next five years dedicated to apologetics,

[06:03] which is defensive faith of the Christian faith. So just learning the arguments around like,

[06:07] why Christianity is true, right? I ended up not believing in it and I can give a variety of reasons.

[06:15] But I'll give you the simplest one. Hopefully I'm not insulting you. This is just my belief

[06:18] that I'm sharing, which is a lot of one of the biggest, one of the strongest arguments for Christianity

[06:23] against other road religions is that other road religions say like, if you go to the good place,

[06:27] so if you do a good job, you go to the good place, right? And fundamentally it's it's a it's a hard

[06:30] paradigm because it means that like at what point are you 51% good versus 49%. So I've just

[06:34] held one more to open and I would have gone to the good place forever. Not even talking about like,

[06:37] finite circumstances and creating infinite outcomes, but like whatever. And so if you can draw that line,

[06:42] then it makes it kind of makes it ridiculous, right? It's like kind of breaks down on the like

[06:46] be a good person system. And so that's all world views with the exception of Buddhism and Christianity.

[06:51] With Christianity, they're like, you don't have to be good. You just have to faith. If you have faith

[06:55] in Jesus and you go to the good place, right? And so the reason that for me, fundamentally, I didn't

[07:00] believe in that was because you actually create another false binary, which is belief or not belief.

[07:04] When in reality is to what extent do you believe? It's how hard you believe. And again, you create

[07:07] another 50% line, which is should I believe one percent more? And then I would go into the good place forever.

[07:11] So anyways, the point is is that I studied a politics for a long period of time and then I was

[07:16] really sad and I was just like, I think sad, I was like for cabinets. I was like, I'm just going

[07:21] to do stuff that I think is cool. And that was like the first break in the chain for me.

[07:26] My slogan to myself was actually just walk happiness. And that was wildly freeing because I stopped

[07:30] judging myself for not being happy. And then I was just like, oh, I'm like, I'm unhappy. I'm like,

[07:34] cool, whatever. Then I just kept going. And all of a sudden, just like stop mattering to me. Like, I don't

[07:38] think about it. I genuinely don't think like does this make me happy? Like, I don't think about it.

[07:41] You just do what you want to do in the mountains. Do whatever you want to do. And it's not like it's

[07:44] like all short term, like all pleasure seeking whatever I still have a long term perspective of like this is

[07:48] what I want to build. Yeah, like I want to write these books. I want to build these courses.

[07:51] I want to do this stuff. But it's like, those are things that I enjoy. So that's what I do.

[07:55] I love it. That's great. All right. I mean, I had questions, but now I know the answers to them.

[08:01] I'm just listening. I can rather just listen and not say anything. I know it's all like I don't

[08:06] want to mess it up. But then I created a belief that now I've got to mess up. Oh, God.

[08:12] What is a matter man? Even matter that I mess up. In a way. Doesn't it? And you can't mess it up.

[08:16] In the comments you're going to be. Oh, it's not. Why does that matter? I know it's crazy stuff.

[08:22] But I think that if you want to, you can't do what 99% of people are doing if you want to be in the

[08:26] one percent fundamentally. And so like you have to have like what I would consider like maybe

[08:30] uncoffordable conversations is be like, that's okay. Like cool. Like I just, I'm going to do my thing.

[08:34] And then they're like, and the thing is, a lot of times, if you just even just make your statements

[08:38] of like, this is how I believe, like people feel like you're attacking them. Especially if you are

[08:41] particular to well. Because they're like, why? I don't like cool. I don't get like do everyone.

[08:46] It's all good to me. So which is why I don't talk about it as much publicly. How about this?

[08:50] Yeah. What bothers you? There's got to be something out there that like, I also have a way

[08:54] question. I only think I don't have a lot of this. This may seem like a silly question. But if you go

[08:59] to a restaurant and you order something, let's say you order a steak and you order it medium well.

[09:03] And it comes back medium rare. Do you say something? Not worth this time? No, I don't actually.

[09:07] You don't. No. I don't care. But at the same time, I was like, well, a lot of people would be

[09:12] anxious to say something and I figured you probably wouldn't care about those emotions, right?

[09:15] I wouldn't even have an emotion first. I mean, that's such a non-ya. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, maybe like

[09:19] in a, like, we have a big ad campaign that's supposed to go out and like, I get all the

[09:23] creatives that before and it's supposed to launch with that annoying me. I'd be like, yes,

[09:27] but let's fix it. You know, like, this is bad. We can't run this. Let's try again.

[09:31] You know, and in the end of what matter, because we're all going to die and this money is going to

[09:33] go back to the game. I'll give you this one analogy. This might be a good wrap up. So this is like my

[09:38] mental analogy that I make sense to me, which is like, if if life were a game and all of us are

[09:44] given a token to like enter like a casino because we're in Vegas, right? It's real, get a, you know,

[09:48] a token. We enter the casino and we sit down at the table to play poker, right? And everybody's

[09:51] playing, everybody's got cards and all of, you know, we're dealt cards, everybody's dealt

[09:54] different cards. And we got to play the hand word out. And depending on our level of skill, we

[09:58] amass more and more chips throughout the game. And at the end of the game, the difference between

[10:02] the real world and the, the game of life in the real world, you just, you go and you can cash out

[10:08] your chips and you walk out with money and there you go. There's your deck. But I feel like in the casino

[10:12] life, you get tapped on the shoulder by the green reaper and he says, your times up and then all your

[10:16] chips get pushed right back to the middle of the table. And then you leave the casino empty handed

[10:19] because it was a fake game with fake rules that didn't matter. And so like we accumulate these chips

[10:24] that I'm just going to push back in the middle again that other people are going to play on. And like

[10:27] the reason that that analogy came real for me is like, I bought this piece of land in Austin. And I was

[10:31] like, that's neat. And then I was like, how many people have owned this piece of land? It's like the

[10:35] guy, you know, the guy before me owned it and the guy before him owned it and the guy before him

[10:39] don't hit. And I was like, and they were like, this is mine. And they die or they sell it. And someone

[10:43] was like, this is mine. It's like, just chips that just get played with and they just get a mast and

[10:47] then they get redistributed. It just doesn't matter. Like death taxes everybody 100%. So like everyone's

[10:51] like a state planning. It's like, dude, 500 generations from now. A, your, your offspring are, you know,

[10:55] 500 to the, you know, 0.5 or, you know, 1 half to the 500th power of like diluted. They're basically

[11:01] just humans at that point. So if, if you're, well, somehow is a big enough that it can be diluted

[11:05] that that much and last that long, the people who own it are just humans. So to like, they're so,

[11:10] they're just as close to me as you are. You know what I mean? It's a matter. And then the alternative

[11:14] is the people that I'm giving this to are just the ones that I care about are the immediate family.

[11:18] But then when people get resources that they didn't learn how to use or manage, then it destroys them.

[11:23] Because it's too much potential energy. They can't handle it. And so it's like, it's really for nothing.

[11:26] And so like, if you want, you can build something that you think is cool. But like at the end of the day,

[11:30] like we're just going to cast the chips in. So anyways, how does this will be used? But,

[11:35] it's a great analogy. Just lots of things to think about this one. Yeah, I don't have to rewind this.

[11:40] But you know, you know, it's funny. I was actually thinking I would, yeah, I remember listening to podcast.

[11:45] No, but this segment, I would actually listen to this. Yeah, money and gum, no worth.

[11:52] Investing in the savings accounts, what credit cards?

[11:56] That's good. Thank you so much. Thank you Alex. This is coming on. This has been an incredible podcast. Yeah, really.

[12:03] So I appreciate. I appreciate having me and into the audience, like, I know that a lot of the stuff that I say can be triggering.

[12:10] And I know that at different points of my life if I had heard someone say what I'm saying in the position that I am, I would be offended.

[12:16] And I want to make clear that it's not my intention to do that at all. It's just me sharing beliefs that as I understand the world.

[12:25] And that is no way projection on you or how you see the world, et cetera. It's just this is how I see the world.

[12:30] These are beliefs that serve me well that helped me overcome a lot of things that I thought mattered.

[12:36] You thought there we go. That was it. That should be our intro. That could be our intro. That's a good segment to put right there in the beginning.

[12:44] It's going to catch people's attention. They were like, what's offensive? What would I get a disagree with? Perfect.

[12:49] That's do that. Thank you so much. Thanks for coming on, man. It was nice meeting you too. Thank you. Good luck when you're tender to it.

[12:54] Thank you. Thanks. She grew the stash up by that. You think so? I mean if you want to say that. That's why I shaved her last night by the way.

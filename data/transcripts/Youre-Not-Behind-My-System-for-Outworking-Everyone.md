[00:00] If you're a business owner or a work for one,

[00:02] this presentation may be the most tactical thing

[00:04] that I can do to make you money.

[00:05] I think this one's going to be a really big header,

[00:08] which is why I wanted to do it live for you guys.

[00:10] So let me ask you guys a question.

[00:12] Who believes that you have to work hard to make money?

[00:15] Rural question.

[00:15] OK.

[00:17] I believe that no one can outwork them.

[00:20] OK, good.

[00:21] I've at least some honest people in this room.

[00:23] Well, I'm in attempt to prove some of you wrong,

[00:25] who believe that you can never be outwork,

[00:27] because I see that on the internet all the time.

[00:29] And it drives me bananas.

[00:30] And the reason this is so important to finding work

[00:33] is that all of us claim to work every day.

[00:36] And yet most of us can't even define the word.

[00:39] And so how do you define work?

[00:41] So we can use the science definition, which

[00:42] is work equals four-type distance.

[00:45] Problem is that that's never useful for knowledge workers

[00:47] for what we do.

[00:48] Do we use the time on clock definition?

[00:50] Time spent working is our inputs.

[00:52] Probably, you know, work 16, 18 hours a day.

[00:55] And so if everyone is already doing that,

[00:57] then how can one person work harder than another?

[00:59] OK.

[01:01] So then do we define it by how hard you try to do it?

[01:03] So the effort that you expend is the work that you do.

[01:07] Well, do you want participation trophies?

[01:09] And people just saying, yes, you tried your hardest.

[01:11] Is this how you want your employees to get themselves?

[01:13] Well, I tried really hard, even though I suck.

[01:15] It's like, well, OK.

[01:18] And so if it's, if work is in four times distance,

[01:21] if it's just the time you put in,

[01:23] if it's not just how hard you try, then what is work?

[01:27] And so we better be clear on what it is we're

[01:29] trying to do to make money, right?

[01:31] If we're going to do more of it to make more money.

[01:33] And so this is my definition, which is work equals outputs.

[01:37] And outputs, we'll volume time leverage.

[01:39] So some of you guys have seen this for me before.

[01:41] And the plane speak is the number of times you do something

[01:43] times how much you get out of each time you do it.

[01:46] Fundamentally, that's what it is.

[01:48] And so the next question that follows is, well,

[01:50] then how do we work faster?

[01:51] How do we do more work per unit of time?

[01:53] And so that's volume time's leverage divided by time.

[01:55] And so the plane speak is output per unit.

[01:58] OK.

[01:59] And so if you want to produce the most per unit of time,

[02:03] please pay attention because I do think that this will help you.

[02:06] And so how can we get more out of the time we put in,

[02:09] which in the game of business is money?

[02:11] And so now everyone's like attention per,

[02:13] perks up there like, oh, that, that stuff.

[02:15] I would like that.

[02:16] And so, a visual for you.

[02:18] So volume is the number of times you do the thing,

[02:21] leverage is how much you get out of each time you do it,

[02:24] equals your output.

[02:25] Sometimes you do it, times how much time you get,

[02:27] equals your output.

[02:28] And so some quick examples and you guys can tell me

[02:30] whether it's higher or low.

[02:32] All right, this is higher putter low output.

[02:35] This is low.

[02:36] It's very hard to do that with very low leverage.

[02:39] Higher low.

[02:40] High.

[02:41] Great.

[02:42] Higher low.

[02:44] Higher, exactly.

[02:46] Higher low.

[02:48] Highest.

[02:50] Because we have a lot of volume on good leverage.

[02:53] And so now I understand what work is.

[02:55] You can either do more activity, do more stuff,

[02:58] or get more for it to get higher output.

[03:01] And so normally I spend the vast majority of my career

[03:03] talking about leverage.

[03:04] But today, I actually want to talk about volume.

[03:08] And the reason for that is because talking about

[03:10] too a lot of businesses.

[03:11] And I have taken for granted that people do all the volume stuff.

[03:17] And it turns out after talking to many of you,

[03:19] that is just not true.

[03:20] And so here I am talking about leverage

[03:22] because I just assume you work your ass off.

[03:24] And that's fundamentally false for most of you.

[03:27] And I'm bathled by how little people actually work

[03:30] when they think they are working.

[03:33] It's for you.

[03:35] And so I'm going to cover two things today.

[03:37] Number one, they're on the input that grows your business

[03:40] the most.

[03:41] Two is removing everything that isn't that from your life.

[03:46] My disclaimer is that this is for business owners

[03:48] and specifically your high-level employees.

[03:50] And so if you're like taking notes,

[03:52] and you're like, hey, I want to send this to my team,

[03:54] I'd recommend because my team saw these slides beforehand.

[03:57] And I had like two guys being like,

[03:58] I'm going to change a whole bunch of stuff.

[03:59] And I was like, great.

[04:00] And that's my sign for good presentation.

[04:02] So figuring out the right input.

[04:04] Let's say that you want to grow your business.

[04:06] You can either get more customers, or you can make the worth more.

[04:10] That's it.

[04:10] You either sell more units, increase your LTV, done.

[04:14] So breaking this into actions for customers,

[04:16] you either get more traffic or you convert

[04:18] a higher percentage of them of the traffic you have.

[04:20] That's the action.

[04:22] Making them worth more, you raise prices,

[04:24] decrease your cost of good sold,

[04:26] buy more, get people to buy more stuff, more times.

[04:28] Those are the things.

[04:30] That's all you got.

[04:31] And if you look at the four things, what do you actually do?

[04:35] Well, to get more traffic, you have to advertise more

[04:37] or better.

[04:38] To increase your conversion, you have to practice sales

[04:40] or you have to improve your offer.

[04:42] If you want to raise your prices,

[04:43] you have to grow go-nads in the side,

[04:45] by the way, go-nads are both sexist stuff.

[04:47] There you go.

[04:48] There's one at PC for the day.

[04:49] Buy more times, which will be decreasing turn.

[04:51] You have reach out, you have exit interviews,

[04:53] you do prepayments, you improve your onboarding,

[04:55] you get faster results, you hold events

[04:57] to appreciate members or clients.

[05:00] But if you look at your time, you do almost none of these things.

[05:07] You're not doing this stuff now,

[05:10] and that's why you're probably not making money,

[05:13] or as much as you want.

[05:14] And so if you don't do this stuff,

[05:17] all the time that you spend, quote, working,

[05:19] has the same impact as doing nothing.

[05:23] And it's kind of like spending your entire week thinking

[05:26] about how you're going to build and redesign your website,

[05:29] and then ultimately deciding not to do it.

[05:31] Except it's just more tiresome

[05:32] than just watching Netflix and relaxing.

[05:35] And so you'd literally be better off doing nothing,

[05:37] than doing the work that you claim to be work

[05:40] that actually isn't.

[05:42] And so that's why most of the businesses here are stuck.

[05:47] And why many people watching this at home

[05:48] aren't growing as fast as they want.

[05:49] And so for most of you, especially the small businesses,

[05:53] your effort should be disproportionately here

[05:55] on getting more traffic, advertising more,

[05:58] advertising better, and higher conversion,

[05:59] meaning your actual activities, daily basis,

[06:01] is letting more people know about your stuff,

[06:03] and practicing getting them to give you money

[06:05] when they find out about it.

[06:06] That is what you do on a regular basis

[06:08] with a vast majority of your time.

[06:09] After all, if you do not have customers,

[06:12] then there is no one that you can raise this price on,

[06:15] and that you can get to buy more times

[06:17] and increase their lifetime value.

[06:20] And so let's pick apart this first one first.

[06:22] Advertising more and better.

[06:23] So you advertise better by advertising more.

[06:26] Excellence comes from repetition.

[06:28] When we even use volume as a measure for skill,

[06:31] like I've taken 4,000 sales consoles,

[06:33] we even say that.

[06:34] We use it as a proxy,

[06:35] and yet we don't think about that

[06:36] for our own skill and business.

[06:38] And so if you want to get unreasonably good at advertising,

[06:41] do so much advertising that it would be unreasonable

[06:43] for you to suck after doing that much of it.

[06:46] Again, we're just defining inputs here.

[06:48] So if you run ads, it means you commit

[06:50] to spending 4 hours a day scripting,

[06:52] analyzing, writing, copy, and recording ads,

[06:54] which may mean what I use at the software or an iPhone.

[06:58] If you use outreach, it means spending 4 hours a day,

[07:00] reaching out to people across social media platforms.

[07:02] If you use content as your primary advertising,

[07:05] then you make content for 4 hours a day, every day,

[07:07] and you make it on every platform.

[07:10] If you use partners in affiliates,

[07:11] it means spending 4 hours a day doing outreach

[07:14] ads or making content to help your affiliates

[07:15] send you more customers.

[07:18] So these actions become the volume that create the outputs,

[07:23] which for many of you is more leads.

[07:27] And if you're hearing 4 hours a day in thinking,

[07:28] what do I have time to do everything else?

[07:32] Remember that doing everything else is what's new.

[07:37] This is what your time looks like when your business is solved.

[07:41] This is what your time looks like when your business is growing.

[07:45] And so too many of you,

[07:46] if you're honest with yourself, your days look like this.

[07:50] And expect results that look like this.

[07:53] Told you, I'll just give you a really thorough answer.

[07:56] And so before you say,

[07:57] but I need to keep doing insert whatever thing

[07:59] that isn't growing your business.

[08:02] Remember, you guys can do it every one.

[08:04] But if you keep doing the same stuff in your business,

[08:05] isn't growing, then the stuff that you're doing is wrong.

[08:08] It is not the right stuff.

[08:09] And you have to learn how to let some fires burn.

[08:13] Some problems are problems,

[08:14] but I don't the problem of the business today.

[08:19] And this is the essence of strategy.

[08:21] You learn to prioritize.

[08:22] Some things are more important than others,

[08:24] which means yes, you can neglect them for a season.

[08:29] Then when they actually become the true limiter

[08:31] of the business, the true constraint,

[08:32] then you focus on them for hours a day until you solve it.

[08:36] And so if you use these four things as our guide,

[08:39] let's say you master traffic

[08:40] and you're getting loads of leads.

[08:42] But you can't close a barn door

[08:43] if the wind was behind you.

[08:45] Then conversion becomes perimeter.

[08:47] And so then you train someone else

[08:49] in the averaging stuff you do because you mastered it.

[08:51] And then you have four hours a day

[08:52] trying to optimize your conversion.

[08:55] Which might look like this.

[08:57] You might actually track your clothes rate for a change.

[09:00] You might actually report all your shels or actions

[09:02] and do them from behind the person.

[09:04] You can actually see their identity.

[09:05] This is for brick and mortar people.

[09:07] And if a sign in your door that says that you record,

[09:09] so you can do it legally.

[09:10] Watch game tape of sales that actually worked

[09:13] every single morning.

[09:15] You practice your script out loud every single day.

[09:18] You hire someone who can give you feedback,

[09:19] ideally, daily, on how well you sell.

[09:22] You have a two minute mental prep

[09:23] before you take consults every single time.

[09:27] You can have pre-sale questionnaire

[09:28] to every person who walks in the door

[09:30] if you're brick and mortar

[09:31] or you have some sort of thing online

[09:32] to get them ready for the sale.

[09:34] You qualify people in the phone better to pre-sale them.

[09:38] And then you actually do that every time.

[09:46] There we go.

[09:47] You guys get in this?

[09:48] Go?

[09:49] Okay.

[09:50] So all problems are solvable with skills.

[09:52] And all skills are attainable for repetition and feedback.

[09:56] And once you have a skill,

[09:57] you can do it in less time, which gives you leverage.

[09:59] So you get more for what you do.

[10:00] The better you get at it, the less time,

[10:02] it takes for you to do it, so you get more time back.

[10:05] In other words, once you get great at saying,

[10:07] you don't need to stretch as much time on it

[10:09] and you'll still close the same percentage.

[10:11] You go from growing a skill to maintaining a skill.

[10:15] And it's much easier to maintain a skill

[10:18] and continue to stay at that same level

[10:19] than it is to gain a skill.

[10:21] And so it's not like maintaining weight.

[10:22] If you're like lost weight or gained weight,

[10:25] like once you get to that level,

[10:26] it's much easier to stay in maintaining

[10:28] that it's to break the whatever the word.

[10:32] It's home your status and same thing for gaining muscle.

[10:35] And everything you spend your time on

[10:36] has to clearly ladder up to one of these things.

[10:39] And so right now, if you look at your schedule

[10:41] and you're not laddering up these four things,

[10:43] you're not doing the stuff that makes money.

[10:46] Otherwise, you're just doing this rather than this.

[10:50] But still, some of you guys are gonna be thinking

[10:52] yourselves, well, with what timeout

[10:54] I can barely keep the water as is,

[10:56] I'm very busy, understandable.

[10:58] And if you have a special snowflake excuse,

[11:01] I'm special, you're totally right.

[11:03] It's literally impossible for you to do what I'm saying,

[11:05] and that's why your business will never grow.

[11:07] Cool?

[11:08] And that is my talk for today.

[11:09] No.

[11:10] If you've had enough, of course, you're right.

[11:12] Just whenever you're out, right?

[11:13] Happy now.

[11:14] You're totally justified as not achieving your goals.

[11:16] Consider yourself excuse.

[11:18] All right.

[11:18] So for everyone else, right?

[11:22] We just have to face reality.

[11:23] Success, the marketplace, your customers,

[11:25] they don't care about whatever your excuse is.

[11:27] And it may be entirely justified.

[11:29] It also doesn't matter.

[11:31] And they also don't care.

[11:33] They just care about how they care about what they can get from you.

[11:36] What's in it may?

[11:38] And so if you're open to the idea

[11:39] that might a little bit about making money and growing

[11:41] businesses, I want to get to the second part of my presentation,

[11:44] which was that was my 11 year transformation

[11:46] that's my before and after.

[11:49] How to make this easier for you?

[11:50] So I said I was gonna cover two things.

[11:52] The first is to how to get very clear

[11:53] on the inputs that grow your business.

[11:55] I mean, if you're very clear in the four things

[11:56] that you need to do and how they ladder up

[11:57] tech activities that you spend for hours a day.

[12:00] And you're like, great, but I don't have four hours a day.

[12:01] Well, that's why we're gonna do the second part.

[12:03] Which is removing everything else that isn't that

[12:06] from your life.

[12:07] And so the nice part about this second half of the presentation

[12:10] is that there's nothing to you about.

[12:12] It's just facts.

[12:14] We all have 20 hours a day.

[12:16] I'm good there.

[12:17] So far I've just dated facts.

[12:18] Okay, people who move faster just do better things

[12:21] with their time.

[12:23] You can cut grass with scissors and it will take a day

[12:26] where you can make one call and have someone else do it.

[12:29] In either scenario, both people get their grass cut.

[12:32] And so we all line that need to spend your time

[12:34] working on those four levers in your business,

[12:36] at least four hours a day.

[12:38] And so I'm gonna show you how to find the time

[12:39] with the combination of habits and buying time.

[12:41] This may be one of the more tactical things

[12:42] that I give you guys that will probably change your life

[12:44] from this whole experience.

[12:46] So first we have to find time and second we will buy time.

[12:50] So let's start with finding time.

[12:51] So there's two types of work that every entrepreneur has.

[12:53] You've got maker time, you've got manager time.

[12:55] Maker time is long blocks of uninterrupted time

[12:58] for the six hours.

[12:59] You only have 14 work blocks per week of this

[13:01] maker time is very, very valuable.

[13:03] It's low urgency, I importance work.

[13:05] That's the stuff that moves the business forward.

[13:07] A productive maker calendar is an empty calendar.

[13:10] An interruption always destroys an entire time block.

[13:12] Who here has had a time block where you're like really excited

[13:15] and then a one hour call comes in at 10 a.m.

[13:17] and you're like, well there it goes, my morning.

[13:19] Yes, we've all been there and you hate that person.

[13:21] And this is what maker time looks like.

[13:24] Looks great.

[13:25] Look at that beautiful blue space.

[13:27] So much work, so much money to be made.

[13:30] On the other hand, you've got manager time

[13:32] and we manage both of these things.

[13:34] These are time blocks as well as five to 15 minutes.

[13:36] You've a hundred of these plus week.

[13:38] The goal is to fill your calendar with these slots

[13:40] if you're in your manager time.

[13:41] And you are a max-lipped manager when you have no gaps.

[13:46] And this is usually when you're having time training teams,

[13:48] coordinating, communicating, putting out fires.

[13:51] And this is what it looks like when you're on manager time.

[13:53] This is also my calendar when I'm on a manager day.

[13:56] And both of these work styles are important.

[13:58] Everyone here has worn both of these hats, right?

[14:01] OK.

[14:02] But the moment these two hats meets,

[14:04] is when does that happen?

[14:05] And so if you're trying to make tiny slices of management

[14:08] into your making time, you'll have a day.

[14:10] It doesn't work.

[14:12] And if you have lots of empty slots between your managing time,

[14:16] it's also inefficient there too,

[14:17] because you're not doing anything with that time.

[14:19] You might as well fill it with more meetings.

[14:21] And so you have to understand what type of work you're doing

[14:22] when you start the day and explain your team

[14:24] the difference between these types of work

[14:26] in the importance of those time periods

[14:29] and why you have to prioritize them

[14:31] so that the entire business can grow.

[14:33] And so beyond explaining the difference

[14:35] in the most of work, I don't know why I keep going out there,

[14:38] here's what I did to facilitate maker time,

[14:40] because manager time always happens.

[14:43] So here are the maker habits that I have.

[14:44] So one is I decide the one project I need to work on

[14:46] that's most important.

[14:47] And yes, it can be the same thing for a while.

[14:50] I woke up at 4am.

[14:51] I worked in sonnetam on that work.

[14:53] Five hours.

[14:54] That's how I work.

[14:55] I turned off all my notifications.

[14:57] I have a dark room.

[14:58] My office now still has no windows.

[15:01] No sound, earplugs.

[15:03] I keep it very, very simple.

[15:04] I would put everything out of my world besides the work.

[15:07] And I realized that there are no emergencies.

[15:09] So this is something that for entrepreneurs

[15:11] we have to understand.

[15:12] Is that there are no emergencies.

[15:15] There's 911, someone's dying in which case

[15:18] call them not me.

[15:19] And then there's the emergency that your business

[15:21] is in a girlfriend third year in a row,

[15:23] which you need to solve now.

[15:26] Which also means going to bed at the same time

[15:28] every single night, which is a habit

[15:29] that serve me very well.

[15:30] And that also includes weekend.

[15:32] And if you're like, how do I do that?

[15:33] I always go to sleep late.

[15:34] Just wake up early once and be tired.

[15:37] That's how it works.

[15:40] That's my brilliant idea.

[15:42] Treat weekends in weekdays to sleep.

[15:44] And realize that drinking costs you two days.

[15:46] The day you drink, the day you recover.

[15:50] And some makers work late at night

[15:51] after their kids have gone asleep.

[15:52] Anyone here who have that?

[15:54] Is that your time slot for making?

[15:55] OK, cool.

[15:56] It doesn't matter what your time slot is,

[15:58] as long as you make time for it.

[16:00] Just find the four to five hours

[16:01] that you can turn everything off.

[16:03] And working weekends is also a hack

[16:04] that you can move forward.

[16:05] It's 104 days a year.

[16:06] The amount of entrepreneurs that are like,

[16:07] I take weekends off like 104 days of uninterrupted time.

[16:12] OK, got it.

[16:14] Understood.

[16:15] Well, I'd love to compete against you.

[16:16] Anyways, so those are some of the habits

[16:18] that help me find time to do the things that matter most.

[16:22] The second is buying time.

[16:23] So let's talk about that.

[16:25] So you are the most valuable person in your business.

[16:28] You produce the most value for the company.

[16:30] And if you had a star employee,

[16:31] you'd want to maximize their every week in movement.

[16:33] Right?

[16:33] If you've got, everybody here have some peers

[16:34] and you're like, man, I just want to clear the way for them.

[16:36] I just want them to just keep working, working, working.

[16:38] OK.

[16:41] And we often do this with our teams.

[16:43] We try and empower them.

[16:44] We try and clear their calendars, try and give them help.

[16:46] But we don't do this for ourselves.

[16:50] And so there's the myth of work life and personal life,

[16:54] so integration or whatever.

[16:55] And this isn't that talk.

[16:56] Believe me, I don't care about that talk.

[16:58] What I mean is that we all have one battery.

[17:01] And the problem with your spouse, a kid, and your chores,

[17:05] and your employees is they all drain from the same source.

[17:08] And see, become more productive by eliminating the things

[17:11] that make you unproductive, more than you have some

[17:13] palmit or time hack.

[17:15] And like, this is what I really want to have sink in.

[17:17] You will become more productive through elimination

[17:19] than by adding optimization.

[17:22] Just by taking away all the things that are not

[17:24] the things that grow the business.

[17:27] And so I also bring this up because no one ever

[17:30] sticks with that stuff anyways.

[17:31] We all see the TikTok hack of like, put a timer

[17:33] and then take a walk, like, no one does it.

[17:35] No one does it.

[17:36] No one does it.

[17:38] So let's just forget about it.

[17:39] Why bother?

[17:42] But cutting things out, they are permanent reductions

[17:44] in energy drainage that you can reallocate

[17:47] making more money, doing the stuff that matters.

[17:50] And so if we all have 24 hours a day,

[17:52] someone who works on the most important stuff,

[17:53] for 16 hours, six days a week is going to move way faster

[17:56] than someone who's two does it, three hours per week.

[18:00] In real, real work time.

[18:01] Somebody, if you guys view, look back on your last week.

[18:03] You're like, how much real maker time did I make for myself

[18:06] to work on the stuff that grows the business?

[18:08] Many times, if you're really honest with yourself,

[18:10] it's like four hours.

[18:12] And so there's a reason that someone can actually move

[18:14] 30 times faster than you.

[18:17] And that's the difference.

[18:20] If you're doing three hours of productive

[18:21] with your 96 productive hours, just the math.

[18:24] And so it's not even close.

[18:25] That's how you move 30 times faster than somebody else,

[18:28] even though both people work all day.

[18:31] And so hopefully they convinced you about how important this is

[18:33] and maybe why other people you know move faster than you.

[18:37] And so let's get really tactical.

[18:39] The average American spends 50 hours per month on food,

[18:43] groceries, eating, prepping, cleaning.

[18:46] The replacement cost for that is $800 a month.

[18:50] The average American spends 25 hours per month cleaning their home.

[18:54] The replacement cost for that is $500 a month.

[18:57] The average American spends 16 hours per month doing laundry,

[19:00] washing, drying, folding, organizing,

[19:02] dry cleaning, driving to laundry.

[19:04] $200 a month to replace that.

[19:07] Which means that for $1500 a month,

[19:10] you can get 96 hours per month back, that two full workweeks

[19:14] every single month.

[19:17] And that means that if you can make more than $15 per hour

[19:19] a few times, you should make that trade seven days a week,

[19:23] twice on Sunday and once for your mom.

[19:27] And this is very much a form of reinvesting in yourself.

[19:31] But you have to use the time that you buy to work to make even more.

[19:34] So this isn't the, I will spend $1500 a month,

[19:37] and then I will get 96 hours back,

[19:39] and I will watch 96 more hours of Netflix.

[19:41] This is not that plan.

[19:43] And I bring this up again.

[19:44] Well, it may be said how many people feel like they're being irresponsible

[19:49] by spending this money.

[19:50] Like the amount of entrepreneurs that I talk to that are like,

[19:53] that will happily hire somebody for $50,000 a year,

[19:56] and are unwilling to think about the idea of spending $1500 a month

[19:59] on things that make them feel fancy or freely,

[20:02] or like access expenses is ridiculous.

[20:06] I'll say that.

[20:08] Is silly.

[20:10] But if you could spend $1500 a month on your most valuable employee,

[20:13] forget about you for a second.

[20:14] Your most valuable lady, a 50% more out of them,

[20:16] wouldn't you do that every day of the week

[20:18] and twice on Sunday?

[20:19] Of course.

[20:21] But you are that more valuable employee.

[20:23] You are that person in the business.

[20:24] By far, not even close, it's you.

[20:30] And I didn't even get into the free 40 hours a week

[20:32] that people spend.

[20:33] All right, so following sports teams for us,

[20:35] a week replacement cost of not falling sports teams,

[20:37] $0.

[20:38] Watching TV, 21 hours a week on average,

[20:40] replacing us literally nothing.

[20:42] Scrolling social media, 17 hours a week,

[20:44] also literally nothing.

[20:46] Driving tune from work and refilling gas

[20:48] for a half hours a week for placement costs

[20:50] is $700 a month for Uber.

[20:52] You have somebody else driving you.

[20:53] I tweet on my way to work.

[20:55] And I tweet on my back.

[20:56] So I get my content.

[20:58] And it's a $1,500 a month.

[21:01] You can still do those fun things.

[21:02] I'm not even taking those out,

[21:04] because you're not going to do it anyways.

[21:05] You're still going to watch TV.

[21:06] You're still going to scroll social media.

[21:07] You're going to do all this stuff.

[21:08] I'm going to try.

[21:10] You can still do that stuff.

[21:12] And spend $1,500 a month and get 96 hours a month back.

[21:16] And so I want to be clear, this is a one time investment.

[21:20] You will never get this back.

[21:21] I can't respend the $1,500 and get another 96 hours back.

[21:25] You only get to pull this trigger once.

[21:26] And I'm still amazed at the businesses

[21:28] that are doing $50,500, $500 a month.

[21:31] And they still are analyzing this bill

[21:35] as something that they have even hesitated

[21:37] to spend money on.

[21:38] Because of what we're in there if they have

[21:40] around why it's good to clean your own laundry.

[21:45] We put your own food.

[21:46] Now, sure, if you like cooking and it's recreational, then fine.

[21:48] But you and I both know that's not what we're talking about.

[21:51] It's lunch on Tuesday.

[21:53] That's what I'm talking about.

[21:55] And so there are so few things that you can spend $1,500 a month

[21:58] on, you get 96 hours per month back.

[22:02] And you can only pull the trigger once.

[22:04] And so this is so simple.

[22:07] And yet when I see rooms like this,

[22:09] with the same problems again and again, again,

[22:11] I had to make this incredibly obvious presentation.

[22:15] Because the only thing that's easier than doing this

[22:17] is not doing it, which is what most of you will probably do.

[22:22] Is you will nod and you will think about it

[22:24] and then you will do nothing.

[22:27] And you will still cook your fucking food

[22:29] and you will still drive yourself to work

[22:31] and you will still clean your house.

[22:33] You're like, why do I like my clothes

[22:34] folded a certain way?

[22:36] Who cares?

[22:39] Like, is it worth the business not growing by 50% this year?

[22:46] And somehow, those of you who do nothing

[22:48] will be amazed why you're later,

[22:49] you're still in the exact same position,

[22:50] while someone else who took these simple steps, 30x their output.

[22:56] And this is how you can actually do your day job as the manager.

[22:59] While also giving yourself the time to do it matters most

[23:02] as a maker.

[23:03] Those 96 hours, you can take those four hours a day

[23:05] and it's there.

[23:06] That's just from stats.

[23:07] That's right there.

[23:08] You can have it.

[23:11] And so this trading up for time is buying time

[23:15] and it's less valuable work that you trade money for,

[23:21] for more free time to do more valuable work,

[23:24] that you then trade to get more money.

[23:25] And you just never stop.

[23:26] This whole process never ends.

[23:30] And so bringing this all together,

[23:32] that's the stuff that actually grows your business.

[23:35] If you work on the right stuff, your business will grow.

[23:38] Like getting more customers, making them more th more.

[23:41] And if you wanna do as much,

[23:43] and you wanna do as much of that as you can

[23:44] to your career business as fast as you can.

[23:46] And make sure your day looks like this, not like that.

[23:50] And to do that in the real world,

[23:53] you eliminate everything else that's not that.

[23:56] Which you do by understanding and explaining

[23:58] the difference between maker and manager yourself

[23:59] and your teams.

[24:01] And giving yourself time every single day

[24:03] to decide the project that matters most,

[24:05] wake up a little bit earlier,

[24:06] turn off your notifications,

[24:07] get a zone that you can actually work.

[24:10] Investing your most valuable employee

[24:13] by eliminating nine six hours per month of work

[24:15] for $1,500 a month.

[24:17] So that you can actually work not to two X

[24:22] or four X more effective, we say it again.

[24:26] So you can work not just two or four times more effective

[24:28] than your competition, but 30 times more effective than them.

[24:31] Because they're like you, super distracted,

[24:35] have their notifications turned on,

[24:36] are taking calls the middle of the day,

[24:38] and they too are only working

[24:40] through hours for productive hours a week.

[24:41] And you can absolutely murder them in their sleep

[24:44] by how much you crush them in business

[24:46] if you actually spend the time to do the things that matter,

[24:49] which almost no one does.

[24:51] And it's crazy, because I spent all this time

[24:53] making all this business content,

[24:54] but I'll see you to cat craze you,

[24:55] it's a decrease in turn,

[24:56] and make sure your onboarding is on board, is streamlined.

[24:58] And people are like,

[24:59] I don't have to find the fucking time,

[25:01] buy it, it's right there, it's for sale.

[25:05] And so you maximize your time

[25:07] and actually work on the things that matter,

[25:08] which everyone else will then wonder

[25:09] when you actually do this,

[25:11] how does he move so fast, how does she move so fast?

[25:14] But you will know the secret,

[25:16] just that there is no secret, you have one battery,

[25:18] and you just try and eliminate as many drains

[25:21] as you can that aren't aligned with your goal.

[25:25] And that's how you can compress multiple lifetimes

[25:27] of growth into one.

[25:29] Thank you.

[25:31] Thank you.

[25:31] Thank you.

[25:32] Thank you.

[25:33] Thank you.

[25:34] Thank you.

[25:35] Thank you.

[25:36] Thank you.

[25:37] Thank you.

[25:38] Any questions on this?

[25:40] Was there anything that was unclear

[25:43] about their presentation go for it?

[25:44] That's why I'm here to sleep.

[25:46] So I didn't bet it now, I go to sleep at 10.

[25:48] Can you get a phone?

[25:49] Uh, I'm probably up all today I was up at four,

[25:52] but most of the time, I'm up by like five.

[25:54] Yeah, 10 to five works fine.

[25:57] I haven't had an alarm in like five, seven years.

[26:00] I don't know, a long time.

[26:01] Um, I'm a big fan, so I probably should add this,

[26:04] is that I think you should have a sleep alarm,

[26:06] not a wake up alarm.

[26:08] I mean, I sleep as long as you can,

[26:10] because like if I don't bite you,

[26:12] but like if I get nine hours of sleep,

[26:13] I'm like I can cure cancer today.

[26:15] Like, like I, I so rarely get nine.

[26:18] Like if I get seven, you know, I'm fine.

[26:20] But nine, like I literally look at Laila,

[26:22] and like give me the hardest problems today.

[26:24] Like I'll just sit in discomfort.

[26:27] Go for it.

[26:27] Can you communicate the manager time?

[26:29] I can't answer your questions.

[26:31] Yeah.

[26:32] So I think, okay, so the question was,

[26:34] is it okay to make your goal

[26:36] eliminating manager time?

[26:38] I see it as a continuum rather than an absolute

[26:40] or a binary?

[26:41] So it's not like I am 100% maker,

[26:43] I'm 100% manager.

[26:45] I think it's just how much of that.

[26:46] So like Laila's calendar is flipped from mine.

[26:49] So I have four days a week of Maker Time

[26:51] and one manager day on Mondays,

[26:53] which I just stack the living hell out of.

[26:55] I'm just like just, I just tell the team

[26:56] I was like just destroying me.

[26:58] Just put everything in there.

[26:59] I expect to accomplish nothing,

[27:01] and I will just make all the decisions

[27:02] and talk to everybody about all the stuff.

[27:05] The other four days I work on things

[27:07] that I think matter most,

[27:08] and I also work the weekends.

[27:10] Her schedule is more like this,

[27:12] where she has four days a week,

[27:13] where she has that her manager time

[27:14] and one day a week that's Maker Time.

[27:16] She also spends the week or two weeks

[27:18] and doing Maker stuff.

[27:20] And so that's kind of how she balances it,

[27:22] because Laila actually runs everything in the business.

[27:24] I take credit for running everything in the business.

[27:26] That's kind of our division.

[27:28] It's worked well for us for years.

[27:30] So, recommend.

[27:32] Yeah.

[27:33] Shoot.

[27:34] How much time do you spend on the business

[27:35] and other activities like that?

[27:37] I just tweeted about this like 10 minutes ago,

[27:39] which is great.

[27:40] Yeah.

[27:41] So how much time do I spend on fitness stuff in general?

[27:43] So my big advice is get in shape between 18 and 24,

[27:47] and then after that, the maintenance of being in shape,

[27:50] it takes like 10% of your time,

[27:52] which I was alluding to in the presentation.

[27:53] And so, I takes me very little time to maintain this,

[27:58] but I now have a gym downstairs,

[27:59] and so it's super, super easy.

[28:02] But I work out when I can.

[28:03] I usually probably work out three, four days a week,

[28:07] and it's just downstairs, and I do it in the morning,

[28:09] I do the afternoon.

[28:10] So keep the relationship, not turn off,

[28:14] and make it more of a business relationship.

[28:17] So how do we, I'm repeating it because no one has a mic,

[28:20] to say no.

[28:21] So how do we manage being married

[28:24] and being co-managers of the business?

[28:27] I always talk about the business stuff.

[28:28] Oh, so we always talk about business.

[28:31] I think what we don't do is judge ourselves

[28:34] for talking about business.

[28:36] I think more people get stressed about what they think

[28:38] they should be doing, rather than just being like,

[28:39] this is our relationship.

[28:41] These are our rules, which we make,

[28:42] and we don't think they exist.

[28:44] It's worked fine so far.

[28:46] If one of us was in a business, it would suck.

[28:50] It's all I want to talk about.

[28:51] Shoot.

[28:53] With your battery, you can just sat in your dreams

[28:56] and present all this.

[28:57] This is for this, this is for a conversation.

[29:00] So the question was, do I have fun outside of work?

[29:04] The majority of my fun is in work.

[29:06] But let me take one or two vacations a year

[29:12] that are like three or four days.

[29:14] And we try to do it with friends of ours

[29:16] because most of the friends that we have don't live

[29:18] where we live.

[29:19] And so most of the friends that we have,

[29:21] not most, all the friends that we have

[29:22] are all pretty high-level entrepreneurs

[29:24] and they're really busy too.

[29:26] And so we try and have company there

[29:29] while we can all talk about business and talk about,

[29:32] what we're excited about.

[29:33] And that's what works for us.

[29:36] The first, I think, three years of our marriage.

[29:38] We didn't take any.

[29:40] I mean, we didn't take a week in a honeymoon.

[29:42] We worked a day, we got married, we worked the next day.

[29:46] We're like, but we do us though.

[29:48] And so I don't see this as prescription.

[29:51] We just do what we want to do.

[29:55] And so I always hesitate with those questions

[29:58] because people take it as gospel.

[29:59] And I just like, we really, really spend a long time

[30:03] trying to not care about anyone else.

[30:05] Thanks, Bob.

[30:08] OK.

[30:13] So how often do I review what the constraint is in the business?

[30:20] Your business constraint doesn't change that often.

[30:23] Once you get it right.

[30:24] And so once you know it's OK, I need to advertise more.

[30:27] You just keep doing that until you break something else.

[30:31] And sometimes you can do that for a very, very, very, very, very

[30:34] long time.

[30:35] And the constraint then goes one is chunked down.

[30:38] So it's like we need to, OK, so it's like you're advertising.

[30:41] And you're running ads, but you're like, I need a second channel.

[30:43] So you're still like the bigger constraint

[30:45] is still the same, many more leads.

[30:47] But you need to have the constraint of like,

[30:48] I need to solve this next acquisition channel.

[30:51] And so it'll move against the larger constraint of the business.

[30:54] But finally, all the constraints are going to chunk up to.

[30:56] I need to get more customers.

[30:57] I need to make the worth more.

[30:58] And I might need to make the worth more, so that I

[30:59] get more customers.

[31:00] And so those will oscillate back and forth on the business.

[31:03] The big thing that one is kind of benchmarks is understanding.

[31:07] I think we were talking earlier when the guys were there

[31:09] with the Medspot.

[31:11] He had a LCV issue.

[31:12] He didn't have a leads issue.

[31:14] And so it's making sure that we're solving the right problem.

[31:16] I see a lot of business owners really obsessing

[31:18] trying to drive down lead costs.

[31:21] And I find it to be more easy to just fix the sales process

[31:24] and add a zero to your price.

[31:26] And then all of a sudden all your lead problems go away.

[31:28] And so it's, I try to find the easiest way to solve problems,

[31:32] which oftentimes isn't the thing that's immediately

[31:36] apparent.

[31:37] So I'll tell you, I'll tell you a fun.

[31:39] So the book launch is going to come up at some point.

[31:43] And so I was thinking about some of the goodies

[31:45] that I was going to be giving away.

[31:46] And one of the goodies I had was like,

[31:49] legit like 400 more hours of work.

[31:51] And so I started the project.

[31:53] And I stopped after an hour.

[31:55] And I was like, OK, can I use my second brain cell here

[31:59] and think of something else that I can give away

[32:01] that's more valuable than this that doesn't take me

[32:03] for 100 hours.

[32:05] And it took me like an hour to think of something else

[32:08] that was better and took less time.

[32:10] And so I think sometimes the pendulum swing

[32:14] on the other side of this is if you have

[32:16] tremendous work ethic, then sometimes you

[32:19] want to solve problems the hard way.

[32:21] But this is something that I feel like I found more and more

[32:24] as I've gotten doggy years aged in business.

[32:27] There's usually a more elegant solution if you just take a second.

[32:31] And you're like, and I like asking hypotheticals

[32:33] of like what would it take to?

[32:36] Or if I had to make something more valuable in a tenth

[32:40] of the time, what would I do?

[32:41] If someone ten times smarter than me had the same problem

[32:44] what would they do?

[32:45] And like cycling through those frames

[32:48] helped me attack the problem differently.

[32:51] And that helps me a lot.

[32:52] Like I use those frames a lot when I'm trying to solve things.

[32:55] Guys, I appreciate you all.

[32:57] I hope you enjoyed the YouTube video.

[33:00] Thank you, Mike.

[33:01] Appreciate it.

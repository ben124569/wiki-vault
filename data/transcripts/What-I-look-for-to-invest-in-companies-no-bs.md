[00:00] My wife and I, Leila, talked to 10 to 20 service information,

[00:03] e-learning, coaching businesses per week that we're looking to invest in.

[00:07] And that's, you know, after they've gone through, you know,

[00:10] several screening processes. And what I wanted to talk about today is,

[00:13] what are the ways that we think through in terms of the value of the business?

[00:16] And not from a dollars perspective, but like, what is the opportunity?

[00:19] And I want to give you kind of the three step checklist that I think through and how you

[00:24] can apply it to your own business and think like, how could I take what I'm currently

[00:27] doing and make it more of an opportunity for me?

[00:29] And if you don't know who I am, I'm Alex from OZOEONECquisition.com,

[00:32] it's portfolio business, it does right now, $110 million a year.

[00:35] So I make this video just because I was once broke and I don't want you to be broke.

[00:39] So that is why we do this. Anyways, so let's rock and roll.

[00:42] When you've heard people say opportunity or opportunity vehicle,

[00:46] you need to get into a better monetization structure.

[00:48] There's different ways of kind of saying the same thing,

[00:49] which is like, how much money can we possibly make that from this core thing?

[00:52] And so when I'm thinking through this, there are three pieces that I think through and at the end of

[00:58] the video, I'm going to kind of walk through kind of the downstring impacts of these things

[01:01] and how you can apply them. But this is the big picture.

[01:04] And you have to make these, I have to make lots of decisions really quickly.

[01:07] So I have to use frameworks in order to make those decisions, right?

[01:09] And makes nap judgments on like, do I think this is interesting?

[01:11] Should we pursue this further? Or should we just give some advice and, you know,

[01:15] wish them well and maybe see them in the future if they implement it, right?

[01:18] There's three things that I, that I've kind of boiled down to an opportunity vehicle.

[01:22] Is this something, is this something a business or opportunity that I want to pursue?

[01:25] It's a lot of you guys were starting out.

[01:27] This will be very valuable for you because hopefully you can just set this up right.

[01:29] And if you're already in the process of building your business,

[01:32] then maybe you can make alterations to the business and incorporate this.

[01:35] So there's three things that I'm looking at in terms of like what I think

[01:38] it makes something much more interesting.

[01:39] Number one is the number of potentially unit sold.

[01:42] So a lot of times people talk about Tam, told her just what market,

[01:44] and I'll talk about why I think that that the longer I do this is somewhat of a misnomer.

[01:49] So I'll talk about that at the end.

[01:50] But just how many people could potentially buy this thing, right?

[01:54] Or buy this service or buy this, you know, whatever this thing is.

[01:57] How many people do I think would be a fit to be purchasers of the thing?

[02:00] So that's number one.

[02:01] And that's just going to show me how big, how long we can run this game is this indefinite?

[02:06] Is this like, you know, I mean, if you're selling weight loss, like,

[02:08] do I believe that people are going to continue?

[02:10] Is food going to keep tasting better?

[02:11] And are people going to be able to change their genetics in terms of how they, how they rely on it?

[02:14] No, I think those things are things that are going to change overall.

[02:18] And so there are assumptions that I'm willing to base the fact that there's a

[02:20] lot of people going to buy this thing.

[02:21] This is just a simple way of thinking through like, what are the assumptions that we can

[02:24] continue to make this trip?

[02:24] So number one is how many people could potentially buy this service?

[02:28] Number two is going to be what is the potential profit I can make from the service?

[02:32] All right, and that's a function of two things, which is what is the value that people are

[02:35] are getting from this outcome and then how much is it cost us to deliver it?

[02:39] And so those are two very important components.

[02:40] Is there some elements that are extremely valuable, but also very costly to deliver?

[02:45] So that's something that would be less interested in.

[02:46] It might be very valuable, but like there's not a lot of opportunity for profit.

[02:49] On the flip side, sometimes it's a very, very small amount of value, but it costs nothing.

[02:53] Right? And the thing is is there the gross profit is actually kind of

[02:56] enticing and depending on what that first one was, which is how many people are

[02:59] wanting willing to buy this thing, then it's like, ah, this becomes a little bit more

[03:02] interesting, right? And so the potential for profit and the gross margin of the unit of

[03:06] thing that we are selling becomes more interesting, which is why Lailandai in general, like

[03:11] course, e-learning, you know, guru coaching type businesses to work with because we can transition

[03:16] them from a not valuable model into a much more valuable enterprise model that has something

[03:19] that they could sell in the future if they wanted to. The third piece is the competitive,

[03:24] the supply demand or competitive dynamics of the landscape. And so I'll give you a counter

[03:27] example and a good example. So if I wanted to get into wireless cell phones, right? Like

[03:32] our cell phone service. Well, lots of people need it. Okay, that's good.

[03:36] Good, how much does it cost me to add one more user to my phone, phone network, pennies,

[03:41] right? And what do I charge them? Hundreds of dollars a month.

[03:44] But then the third one is competitive dynamics. Well, I'd have to beat out Verizon and AT&T

[03:49] and all the other big conglomerations of phone service that exist to be very difficult for me to break

[03:54] into that. And so that's an example of it checks two of the three boxes, but not the third one.

[03:58] And so a different example of that, I'll tell you like a hypothetical crazy good example,

[04:03] would be if someone had figured out a way to create hardware that does crypto mining, right? And

[04:08] let's say that that crypto mining, you know, could make people, let's say, $50,000 a year. All right,

[04:13] this is a music and an extreme example to illustrate the point. Well, if they had figured that out,

[04:17] then one, just about everybody wants, you know, passive or close to passive, side income. So

[04:23] total number of people that we could sell this to a lot amount of value that someone's getting,

[04:27] a lot, 50,000 dollars in this case, it's actually quite a viable. How much does it cost us?

[04:31] In this instance, we have to figure out what the cost of the rig would be, but let's say it was,

[04:34] you know, small. Let's say it was $500. Well, then this business becomes incredibly interesting as an

[04:40] opportunity. And then the fourth, or so the third is, what are the competitive dynamics? Well,

[04:45] if there's no one else who can offer this, then we're off the races, right? But on top of that,

[04:49] how new is the space? Are there a lot of new people coming into it? Are there established?

[04:53] People who are killing it that would try and price us out, et cetera. And in this space, for

[04:58] example, everything's brand new, instead of the competitive dynamics are great, and it's massive,

[05:01] you know, it's very quickly growing, and we'll continue to grow probably for the first year.

[05:04] So in this instance, if you're like, wow, this is a very interesting business that I would want to

[05:09] participate in or learn more about. And so if you're thinking through these lenses, and I'll talk

[05:13] about the tam thing in a second about why I don't think it's necessarily as good as people use to think,

[05:17] in terms of assessing the value of the business, I'll talk about that in a second. But if you're using

[05:21] these three lenses to think about your own business, you can ask yourself, okay, is there a way

[05:26] that I could make this, you know, applicable to potentially more people, so that I could have a

[05:30] total higher number of units or bigger audience that I could sell to number one. Number two,

[05:35] is is there a way that I can reconfigure this thing so that it either makes the customer a more

[05:39] valuable outcome, and or it costs us less to fill that outcome. So it increased the gross profit

[05:46] per unit salt. Is there a way that I can reconfigure what I'm doing? Right? And I'll give you a

[05:50] couple of rules of thumb here that I like, which is if I'm doing any kind of service business,

[05:55] I like to have 80% or higher gross margins. All right. So what that means is, if I'm selling

[06:00] something for $1,000 a month, it has to cost me less than $200 a month. If for those of you who

[06:04] are new to making money, people will get their panties in a lot about that, but like profit is

[06:09] would drive's business. All right. It's not that all of that gross profit that's before cost of doing

[06:14] business goes to the owner. That's just everything that you have to chip down away from. So you're

[06:19] starting at 80 and let's say you want to run a business that runs 50% margins. Well, that means you've

[06:24] got 30% there. Right? If in that $1,000 month example, I got 300 bucks a month to cover everything else

[06:30] that I do in the business that covers that covers marketing, that covers admin costs, that covers payroll,

[06:35] that covers that covers, you know, HR, finance, all of these other fun legal, whatever, all the other

[06:40] funs to the business. So the thing is 80% is minimum and the thing is especially smaller businesses

[06:45] think for some reason that that's like charging more is bad, right? And you got to get out of that

[06:49] because if you want to help more people, you need to have gross profit in order to scale. If you look at

[06:53] the biggest companies that exist out there, they sell something that's very valuable that cost them

[06:57] almost nothing. So they think about Google, right? They sell ads based across some of them.

[07:01] It's nothing besides the actual, like their incremental cost running it at is virtually zero.

[07:06] Right? And they charge a King's ransom for it, right? Facebook. Same thing, right? They charge

[07:10] for eyeballs that cost that like they've one time cost building that after that the incremental

[07:13] cost of of showing ads more eyeballs is almost nothing. So it's all margin. Look at the phone

[07:18] company that I was explaining earlier. They have their one time cost of building the thing, but

[07:21] then the additional cost of adding one more user is almost insignificant, right? But they can still

[07:26] charge a greater amount of money for it. This is the recent software, something that people

[07:29] finding incredibly valuable. It costs one time to build it. And then after that, the incremental

[07:33] user is almost all profit. Now the only other type of business that's like this with a close to 100

[07:38] percent gross margin is information and education businesses, which is why Leyla and I like these

[07:42] types of businesses because they have they have the same margin as software businesses except

[07:47] you don't have the cost of development. The downside is that those types of businesses tend to

[07:52] have higher churn because the increased value or the value declines over time when someone

[07:58] learns a skill from this type of business. That being said, there are ways of reconfiguring the

[08:02] business to increase the stick of the client with by pulling out the things that are consumable versus

[08:06] not versus one times consumable. And I'm going into the weeds here, but hopefully you'll enjoy it.

[08:11] So something that's a one time consumption would be something where I have now gotten the skill

[08:16] from the thing or I've learned the learn the process and this is especially true with

[08:19] learning or e-learning type businesses. If someone comes for a skill, they learn the skill and the

[08:22] value of training for the skill decreases because they already have it. That makes sense.

[08:26] But the thing is, a lot of times when people are learning something, there are other components

[08:30] that surround them that are consumable on an ongoing basis. So the information is one time

[08:35] consumable as long as they learn the skill. But then there become other things that are consistently

[08:39] consumable. So community is consumable. As in like that one access to it this month, I want to

[08:44] access to it next month. Accountability is consumable. I consumed it this month to get to point

[08:48] B. But now I want to consume it again to get to point C. In additional piece would be if the type of

[08:54] skill that you're teaching someone creates new problems, which most times if you're good at teaching

[08:58] something, all problems create solutions or all solutions create more problems. Right? And so when we

[09:03] solve the the old problems, we get new ones. And that's why we as business owners should always

[09:07] just see problems with this blank checks for us to cash in at our own desire. Right? There are

[09:11] problems everywhere. And they just have a dollar amount attached to them and the question is,

[09:14] do we want to go and cash that check in and solve that problem? Right? Like that's how you can

[09:19] you can perceive problems in the world in terms of opportunity. For these types of business,

[09:23] which is why we like them is that we can pull these pieces out and then create something that

[09:27] has really high margin and has high LTV and continues to build enterprise value over time

[09:32] by selecting and peeling these pieces apart. And so finally, I want to talk about why I think

[09:36] Tam is not as good of a indicator for the potential size of a company. Well, look at some of

[09:42] these original companies. So look at Facebook. When they started out, it was like,

[09:46] supposed to just be a college, you know, network thing. Right? It was supposed to be, you know,

[09:50] Facebook, I think is what the actual term was way back in the day for like a yearbook. Right?

[09:56] And so that's literally what the name of the thing was, right? And so somebody might look at that

[10:00] initially. Obviously people could see where it potentially go. But they saw that and be like,

[10:03] well, maybe the the Tam, the total just market is just constitutes. The reason that I think

[10:07] it's interesting is that businesses and founders expand envision over time. And the the time when

[10:13] when a vision is a visionary or founder has run out of vision or run out of futures the moment that

[10:18] the business dies or they sell it because they just don't know what else to do to grow it. Right?

[10:21] What happens a lot of times is that if we can, if we can continue to increase and eat up the

[10:26] the total just market that we have defined for ourselves in our business, a lot of times a

[10:30] Jason's, you know, are Jason markets or silos all of a sudden become more and more attractive. We find

[10:34] out that there's a lot of similarities or that we find that there's another need. And then we can

[10:37] branch into yet another silo. Now, if you're like, that's the exact decision I did and I went

[10:42] from 100,000 to 200,000 years. No, that was dumb. Like, that's not that's not the point of this.

[10:47] Like, you could just scale one avatar to probably, you know, a hundred million a year before doing

[10:52] that. That's not the point. The point is that, you know, on a long enough time horizon,

[10:56] businesses also through emergency and acquisition things like that, they can buy up other companies

[10:59] that are adjacent close to them. It's said, right, and expand the total is market they have,

[11:03] which is why I don't necessarily think of it on a long term time horizon. But I do think about

[11:08] it on a short term time horizon. So if I'm looking at like the next three to five years,

[11:11] then I may be like, okay, we're not going to change advertising next three to five years. But do I

[11:14] think that this thing over the next 20 years could eat up more and more of the pie by expanding

[11:18] who were potentially serving? If the answer is yes, then the original tamer, the current tamer,

[11:23] is not necessarily the future tamer is going to be. And so that's why I don't see tamers as valuable as

[11:28] I think it is, it is purported to be. If you're new to the channel, welcome. You hopefully can think

[11:33] through those three different opportunity kind of vehicle frames in terms of like, how can I look at

[11:37] my tam in a way that potentially could sell more customers? How can I increase the value versus the

[11:42] cost of what it is that I'm delivering? And is there a way that I can enter a space that is more

[11:47] unique or newer, which I can either do by going into the clearly new spaces, or by trying to

[11:53] redefine what I'm doing in a new way? Right? And if we can do those things, then we increase what I would

[11:57] consider the opportunity size of what we are pursuing and then ultimately make more money.

[12:01] All right, and so that's what I'm thinking about when I'm looking into these companies that we're

[12:03] potentially investing time in money into. Otherwise, hope you have an amazing day and I'll see you

[12:07] guys next video. Bye.

[00:00] What's going on guys? I'm going to show you a quick video of how right now I can build out my house for $10,000 a day and how you can do the exact same thing.

[00:08] So by the end of this video you'll know step by step how you can get tax free income by understanding the relationship between your home and your business.

[00:15] So check this out. So right now I've got my team at my house. So this is my physical house. You can say hey, what's up dudes?

[00:21] What's up?

[00:22] Recording stuff and you can use something called the Augusta rule which I'll break down in a couple seconds

[00:30] On the on the screens you can understand how it works, but the cool thing is is you can use your home and

[00:35] Generate tax-free income for you and a tax deduction for your business

[00:40] So you're basically double dipping twice and it's with assets you already have so by the end of this video

[00:43] You're gonna have that stuff and you're gonna be able to use it in your own business. So if your business owner listen up

[00:47] Watch this video to the end you're gonna love it and in the meantime click subscribe before I switch up in the other video

[00:53] All right, welcome back my name is Alex Shmozi. I'm the owner of prestige labs Jim launch Allen and five other portfolio companies

[00:59] We do about $85 billion a year and so the reason I made this channel is to help people who are broke and don't want to be anymore

[01:06] Or people who have lots of money and want more of it and so that is the entire point of this and so let's rock and roll

[01:11] So one of the important pieces of you know making and increasing your net worth is making sure that you keep as much as you possibly can

[01:17] While you're generating income and I'm not saying you should be one of those people's obsessed about it because a lot of times

[01:21] You should put more of your attention on your business creating value etc

[01:24] But there's obviously like ways that you can decrease your tax drag right you're your tax inefficiencies

[01:29] I'd like to help them a lot of times this is just my overarching strategy that I would say with taxes is that unless you're moving to Puerto Rico

[01:36] It's not gonna be a silver bullet. There's lots of golden babies lots of little ways

[01:40] So you can save here and there and so right now

[01:42] I want to give you one of the easiest tax strategies that you can use if you're a small business owner pretty much of any kind

[01:48] Like I said earlier in the video, it's called the Augusta rule, okay?

[01:51] And so I'm gonna try and explain this in 60 seconds it'll probably be a little bit longer

[01:55] But it will be worth every second of it all right so if you have your house

[01:59] You can rent your house to your business for employee meetings

[02:03] You can rent your house to your business for a member event

[02:06] So if you have clients or customers who are flying in a town or you want to hold an event or a small mastermind or a workshop

[02:12] Or anything like that at your home you can lease it to your business on top of that if you do recording

[02:18] Like I have I've built out I put some capital expense into my home which a increase the value of my house

[02:23] So I get increase in value two I can use that value to lease to my business at a higher rate than I normally would because a professional studio ran out per day

[02:32] It would be five to ten thousand dollars a day and it cost me all in to make the studio

[02:36] 30,000 for this room and 50,000 for the other which you'll probably see in other videos and so all in a cost me about 80,000

[02:42] But here's the cool part the industrial states that we can lease our home to our business for up to 14 days

[02:48] All right, and so whatever my day rate is that would be fair market

[02:51] I can multiply that by 14 and I can write myself a check for that provided I've used my home for that period of time

[02:57] Now the reason and the when I heard about this I think it was two or three years ago

[03:01] I went to a mastermind and a guy was like hey, I'm gonna save everybody the entire cost is mastermind in the next five seconds

[03:07] And I was like okay, I'm taking notes and I took the notes and I was like that was awesome

[03:10] And so in an effort to disseminate information to the masses for perspective if you're even making a hundred thousand dollars a year

[03:17] And you can lease your home to yourself at a fair market rate of let's say five hundred dollars a day

[03:21] Maybe a thousand dollars a day that's 14 thousand dollars that you can write yourself to the tax recheck and take a deduction off of your income from the business

[03:28] All right easy strategy and if you have a CPA which hopefully do just tell them it's the

[03:32] Agustural and what you plan to do with it and they should be able to walk you through it from there and so I hope you found a video a value in this video

[03:37] Hopefully I can make you 10,000, 20,000,000,000

[03:39] 100,000 dollars tax free just from watching

[03:42] And I've got other videos other strategies about increasing how much you may growing your business

[03:47] Increasing your network and ultimately getting the freedom you want so check out those videos clicks of pride if you liked it

[03:52] And if you didn't like it you can tell me that I suck and that's cool. I'll be okay. All right. Let's love keeping awesome seeing this video

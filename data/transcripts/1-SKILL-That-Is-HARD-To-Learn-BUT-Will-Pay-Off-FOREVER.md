[00:00] What's going on everyone? It is Alex from us here from Jim launch Alan prestige labs

[00:04] you to $110 million from revenue. So if you right now you were in a vehicle or a business

[00:08] and it's not growing the way you want it to grow you're looking at the people who are doing the same thing as you and you want to do better

[00:13] or better than them or as good as them then I'd like to share kind of the nuggets from a

[00:18] conversation idea today with an agency owner who was kind of struggling with the same thing. So they they're they were an agency owner

[00:24] they're in the real estate space and he'd been doing this for a year and a half

[00:27] each and he's like a what point to throw in the talent switch industries right and this was an awesome

[00:33] conversation because the honest truth is you're not that good that's why you're not making money

[00:42] like just like let that sit for a quick second like the reason you're not making money

[00:48] is because you're not that good and that's okay because it wouldn't be reasonable for you to be good

[00:54] because you just started right and started is in the business like not 30 years in the business you've been there for a year

[01:00] right and so like is it reasonable to believe that you're going to have a top one

[01:02] percent income only having been in a game where other people have been doing for 20 20 years

[01:06] were the top one percent probably not right and so the question is then how do you how do you how do you

[01:11] skip through that so the first is asking do I think that the vehicle that I am in is viable and so the easiest way to do that is look around

[01:17] and see if there are other people in the industry that are doing what you're doing and if they are succeeding in the

[01:21] means that it is possible and therefore it is possible for you so the next piece is

[01:27] understanding the depth of the value and the skills that are required to be successful and so let me give you a quick example of

[01:35] this I'll give you a theoretical example and then I'll drive it home with the real estate thing so

[01:41] for those of us in the you know the US we have one word for snow it's snow right

[01:46] um ascamos this is from what I heard they anybody any of you guys are ascamos you can let me know if this is true

[01:52] false but from what I understand they have seven different words for snow all right it's because of the different types of snow

[01:58] and you could reason that ascamos understand snow better than we do because it's literally all they have

[02:06] and so the nuance that they have for what snow is is more delineated right

[02:14] and so when I was talking to this um real estate agent agency I was like so why are your clients

[02:22] not staying on the obvious answers do not make in money but he's like but he's like some clients we

[02:27] killed with some clients we don't kill it for he's like I got one guy is doing 250 thousand dollars a month

[02:32] just using a lead that we send him and I was like right that's because of him and not you

[02:38] think about it that's like all right so what is that person doing that's different than the rest of your clients right

[02:46] because like from what I understand I mean he's just it's just he's just calling him up

[02:50] and I was like that would be the same thing is looking at what I do all day and just saying yeah I mean Alex just makes money just

[02:56] hops on meetings there's a little bit more to it than that right it's the death of the understanding it's looking at the

[03:03] sky and saying oh it's white it's snowing right when in reality an expert says oh there's seven different

[03:08] types of snow and this is subtype A right if you were to ask me how do I make you know like there's only

[03:13] free offers and non-free offers I'd be like no there's 19 types of ways to monetize the word free

[03:19] like oh Alex might know more about that right it's because I have more volume the guys who were

[03:23] the Eskimos he snow every day and so they've been doing it their whole lives and of course they

[03:27] have more delineation for what types of snow there are and so the solution for this particular owner was

[03:33] this is what I would recommend to him he may or may not do this but it will be the thing that

[03:37] I'll make him successful is I was like fly out to the guys you've turned 50,000 month off of your

[03:43] leads and soak up everything how many times does he call in what intervals what's the first thing

[03:51] he says on the phone what's the intonation how does he follow up right after the phone call

[03:56] where where does he meet them how soon does he meet them is the meeting in person is it a zoom call or is it

[04:02] is it a phone call is he setting up for someone else when they do show up what's the contract

[04:07] look like what is that conversation look like how does he walk around the room when he positions

[04:11] themselves and presents the contract when he orders the houses for the showing how does he order

[04:15] them does he order the most expensive one first then something else second and then the one he wants

[04:18] to sell them like what's the process look at and then after the person says yes how does he

[04:23] close the deal out of make sure that he's getting paid is it going to know any of that stuff

[04:27] and it's like right and that's why you're not making money I was like if you were the top

[04:30] absolutely if you knew more about how to make real estate agents money we wouldn't be having this

[04:35] conversation because you'd be making them money right and so everyone's unwilling to do the thing

[04:40] which is to to plant the roots right you got to plant the roots deep and the only way to have

[04:46] that level of certainty because if someone says to him these leads are crap right for example

[04:52] he could look back and then it's saying no they're not you're doing it wrong because he has

[04:56] the certainty in the conviction that he has done it and he knows that and that there's only

[05:00] two ways to have that level of conviction you can either be a sociopath and lie or you can have

[05:05] done it there is no other trick right like I could speak with confidence in saying that I know

[05:10] that Jim launches better at serving Jim's because we have more seven figure Jim's the most

[05:13] people that have in their entire freaking franchises right I have 15 hundred success stories I know

[05:20] our stuff works right and so I can have that conviction like there's just there's no question about it

[05:25] I did 33 turn around for two years right two years I spent in motel rooms everyone forgets

[05:32] about that stuff like how do we learn how to self-suffinments so well because I would stand in front

[05:37] of a room of complete strangers and day after day after day I would close these rooms full of people

[05:43] to buy supplements right and the first six months I did it I didn't close anyone because I

[05:48] couldn't figure out how to sell them and then I stumbled into one success and then another success

[05:53] and then it became a system and then it became so repeatable I could do it in my sleep right

[05:57] but you were like well what's the hack right now you can learn from somebody who's already learned

[06:01] that that's how you fast-track success I was on the same call and there was um a lady on there who said

[06:08] um I didn't want to have been been heard but it was the point is if you can't learn from other

[06:15] people's failures then it means that you are literally going to have to make every single mistake

[06:21] yourself which is possibly the stupidest thing you can do like you obviously should learn from your

[06:27] own mistakes but why is people learn from other people's mistakes and even better they learn from

[06:31] other people's successes right I someone yesterday who was on that same call say like well I don't know

[06:36] if like what you're saying is is right for XYZ and I'm like who do you think has more perspective

[06:40] about snow this is your first winter I've been living in Alaska for the last 20 years like

[06:48] as I give you absolutely want to go make the mistake you can absolutely go make it I was like

[06:53] but it's stupidest shit right think about it and so to wrap this up in terms of like if you were

[07:00] not seeing the success that you believe that you were quote owed which you're not owed anything

[07:03] right then you have to you you are you aren't you earn the success and you get it through doing

[07:11] and it like I was talking to another guy yesterday who's an entrepreneur they're doing a few

[07:15] million bucks a month right and it was funny because hearing his story is the same story it's the

[07:22] same story that every successful entrepreneur has the same story so listen to it and if it's not

[07:29] your story then it's why you're not where you want to be every single successful entrepreneur has a

[07:36] rocky cutscene they have a two year four year six year period of time where no one talks about it and

[07:42] they did the same thing over and over and over and over again and then finally they have mastery

[07:50] and then at that point they transfer that skill to a new opportunity a new vehicle and then they blow

[07:55] up overnight that's how it happens all right the guy that I was speaking with yesterday has an amazing

[08:01] selling system he's very good at building sail seems that are both outbound and inbound right great guy

[08:07] how did he learn how to do it he saw all these leads that were happening online all these

[08:12] options that no one was calling for for digital products and he's like and he was a good salesperson

[08:18] to that point he said I'll bet you I can figure out a way to get these people to buy and what it

[08:22] you do he started picking up the phone and every day he would do hundreds of dials hundreds of dials

[08:28] to these lists that were just plowing through that no one was talking to and then he finally figured

[08:32] out how to get him to say yes to the first phone call and then he figured out how to set them for the

[08:36] second call and then he figured out how to make the offer on the on the next call on close them right

[08:41] but it took a all the time of learning how to sell with certain years and then he applied it to a

[08:47] new vehicle and then did more reps with his initial skill and then he learned a system and then once

[08:52] he applied that system you was able to show the people etc right he blew up for me I did four

[08:58] thousand sales consultations four thousand thousand thousand thousand all right sales consults in person

[09:09] it's a lot it's so so it's like when we talk about sales stuff the new wants is are evident

[09:15] the difference between somebody who just talks about sales that you've seen in a video right

[09:20] and somebody that you can that someone's who's providing excessive value is because of the new

[09:24] wants that you only learn through repetition right from actually putting time under the bar

[09:30] which is the word that I use from the fitness space like you have to put your time under the bar

[09:35] there is no shortcut I was on a podcast where they were asking me they're like it seems like you've

[09:39] you've you know you've had this this great success really quickly quick is relative right but

[09:44] he was like and if if the people who were listening want to shortcut that success what do they do and I was like

[09:48] you're not that's the answer you're not going to because the the skill is the base of the

[09:54] pyramids the foundation right if your foundations this small because you only spent six months

[09:58] doing Iraqi cutscene then the peak of that pyramid is small but you give me a base that's like this

[10:04] and it's hundreds of feet deep you can build a skyscraper taller than anything you've ever seen

[10:09] right but the foundation is the piece that no one can take from you no one can take my experiences from

[10:14] right and the skills that were shaped from them and so right now if you're not seeing what you want to see

[10:18] it's because you haven't put the time and you haven't put the time under the bar you haven't gotten

[10:21] the reps and you haven't done the volume right and so if you see someone that is doing something

[10:25] better than you then go and observe and then execute right iterate sorry uh replicate before you

[10:33] iterate go do it and then until you can do it as well as them don't change anything once you can do it

[10:40] as well as them or better than them then you've earned the right to iterate on someone else's system

[10:47] that is my advice so this is a passionate one for you it was just because it's them from so many

[10:53] conversations have culminated this if you want to figure out how to how a carpractors doing well go to

[11:00] carpractors are doing well and offer work for free all right now you're not going to work for free

[11:05] for me I get a DM I get 2 DMs a day like hey man I'll work for free if I can just spend time with you

[11:10] no you have no value to provide to me don't ask right but there are other people who are probably closer

[11:18] you don't have me like go message bill gates and say hey bill you know I'll work really hard

[11:23] and I'll I'll stand next to you he's not going to accept that like no person who's who's like

[11:27] really really making money is ever like because you're just going to literally take from them you've

[11:31] no value to provide right instead have value can provide which might be like working the friend

[11:38] desk it might be cleaning the facility might be doing anything so that you can be a roundy

[11:42] business owner and then you can learn skills that you can then apply all right like when I when we

[11:47] did the gym turn around I worked the front desk for 33 different gyms it's a lot of gyms right

[11:54] and so I got a feeling for how how the floors later how the lobby needs to be layout how you can

[11:58] maximize yourself hey you can have more guy selling in the same space right all those things happen

[12:03] because it's time under the bar so I'm spending 20 years in Alaska looking it's snowfall after snow

[12:07] snowfall and saying that's the detail oh when you pick up the phone say like this right because I

[12:12] tried that it didn't work right and if you have to go ram your head in the wall not learn from

[12:16] other people's mistakes that's done so yes more of the story is put the time in you will you will

[12:24] achieve your success faster by taking the year or two of Rocky cutscene and then blowing up

[12:29] look at everyone else's successes they didn't blow up like they didn't they didn't just blow up

[12:35] right there's there's the Rocky cutscene period if and if you haven't had that period you

[12:40] probably won't blow up so just start putting the time in now to get your Rocky cutscene done to

[12:46] have the skill that you can then apply to the new opportunity that arises the sales guys

[12:51] opportunities you figured out out bound calls where there's a huge gold mine right for me

[12:56] figured out there apparently there's a lot of gyms you wanted to learn how to get customers right

[13:00] profitably I didn't know I figured everyone was opening their gyms with full capacity I didn't know

[13:04] right and then it turns out a lot of people wanted to have that right um Billy Jean who I

[13:08] I talked about all the time he did code calling for three years or two years before he ever started

[13:12] marketing right that was the Rocky cutscene period where he sharpened his sword that's where he learned

[13:16] how to sell right and so all of these things right look at your path look at the Rocky cutscene

[13:23] that you have or haven't done and just get it done and then after that you'll build the base of

[13:28] the pyramids you can have the peak that you want rather than consistently building off of the

[13:32] foundation that's this big and never being able to pass five or ten thousand dollars a month

[13:36] right because you haven't earned it right and the marketplace knows that they can delineate

[13:40] between who really has trench knowledge and who is pretending and that's pretty much it so

[13:46] it's all I got for you happy ones day keeping awesome kids soon bye

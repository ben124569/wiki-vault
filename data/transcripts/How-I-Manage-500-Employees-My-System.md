[00:00] The single most valuable skill that you can have is getting other people to do things for you because fundamentally if you know how to do that

[00:05] Then you can get somebody else to do every other portion of the business and they can build it on your behalf and so in this video

[00:10] I'll walk through an in-depth process of how I think about

[00:13] Managing people to get the desired outcome on a consistent basis and how to have some of the hardest conversations you have to have and make it feel easy

[00:21] So let me show you something that I haven't done in any other school days, but I'll walk you through it

[00:24] So I just call this like my management diamond

[00:26] So fundamentally if you ask someone to do something you want them to do it if they're not doing it

[00:33] Then comes into the problem solving right which is what how

[00:40] When

[00:42] Okay, so if someone doesn't do what you want them to do the first and obvious reason that they didn't know what you wanted them to do

[00:58] And see fix this one through communication

[01:00] This is by the way a really good framework for having hard conversations when someone's not doing a good job

[01:05] Let's you say hey Carly I

[01:07] Wanted you to do this and you haven't done it so I just want to figure out what the reason was so we can solve it

[01:12] Or make it less likely to have in the future so I figured the first was that you didn't know that I wanted to do that

[01:16] Did you know that I wanted to do that if they say no, I didn't know and you're like great now you know

[01:23] Now if they're like I did know that you want to be do that then you're like oh, did you not know how to do it?

[01:28] Which you solve with training?

[01:31] Which will dovetail into the whole teaching thing in a second

[01:35] But okay, yes, I did know that you want to be to do it and I know how to do it

[01:41] But I didn't know you wanted it by now or by tomorrow and so I didn't have a deadline here

[01:45] So we assign deadlines when we tell people to do things

[01:49] And that's just again to hold them responsible now if someone knows what you want them to do

[01:52] They know how to do it and there's a deadline associated and they still don't do it

[01:55] Then the question is

[01:56] Did they need some sort of incentive where they not motivated to do it or

[02:00] Was something blocking them?

[02:01] I can have the best chef in the world is the most motivated know that I want to make an

[02:03] Hommel it knows how to do it knows that one in the next five minutes. He's like brought on the eggs

[02:08] Doesn't matter how much I do it like sometimes people don't like like we actually had this issue

[02:13] With my editing scene

[02:14] Was I was like why don't you all fucking edit in the building and they were like the upload speed?

[02:18] They're like my upload speed at home is faster than here and so it actually just takes me more time

[02:22] And so we paid Google fiber to drill a hole into the fucking wall and here we are now they're gonna faster here now

[02:27] All right, but it's fundamental like if there are blockers then it's like okay

[02:31] Well, can I just solve whatever that blocker is gonna remove that impediment and so walking through this

[02:37] Has helped me have a lot of hard conversations with people and not make them hard

[02:41] It's like there's five reasons that you didn't do it

[02:43] You didn't know what it was how to do it when I wanted it you weren't incentivizer or someone's blocking you

[02:48] Any of these sound familiar and if there's more than one then you got to fix more than one

[02:51] And oftentimes if you delegate

[02:54] If you basically you hand something off to somebody and it gets worse after you hand it off

[02:58] Because you didn't delegate you advocated it you just said here you go good luck

[03:03] And so that's a very easy limit test if you hand it off and it gets better or it's neutral then you actually

[03:08] Deligated it and so it happens as most entrepreneurs just find a human being that has a pulse say they have a meeting like this

[03:14] And just say a lot of things at them expect the person to have 100% retention and know exactly what to do when they want to do it how they want it done

[03:21] With no blockages the person's not aware of and then

[03:26] Be done be like I already I told him once

[03:29] It's like yeah once not in a written format in no structure for it like and then you're just yelling at them on a zoom call and then two

[03:36] Ex later your surprise that they're not doing as well as you after having done it for fucking years

[03:41] You don't even so

[03:43] We we think through this that this is how I think through trying to figure out

[03:47] Employee issues so this one's fairly straightforward. I might opinion

[03:52] This one's fairly straightforward the two hard ones are these guys

[03:57] So from a training perspective I'll give you I'll give you an example. I had to do recently with a team man or employee here

[04:04] I'll just give uh

[04:07] So let's say there's somebody in your team is a dick

[04:10] Right you're like hey

[04:11] Carolina you're being a dick

[04:14] Um

[04:15] The thing is is that

[04:17] Stop being a dick is actually a pretty terrible directive and the reason is because they don't know what they're doing because they're dex

[04:23] They're like you just want me to not be me. You're like kind of

[04:26] And so what we have to do is so I call a bundling and unbundling terms and this is fundamentally why I think my content is better than most people

[04:34] Is that

[04:36] Like you've heard me to find terms. It's like okay patience is figuring out to do in the meantime

[04:40] So I told some of be patient

[04:42] It doesn't mean anything if I say be charismatic

[04:46] How do I be charismatic? It's like okay. I need you to have more

[04:50] Volk arranges when you're talking. I need you to pause

[04:53] For emphasis. I need to say people's name. I need you to look them in the eyes

[04:56] And you do not when they're talking like these are serious activities that when someone does all of them

[05:01] We bundle them together and say this person's charismatic and so rather than saying be charismatic

[05:06] I need you do these six things

[05:09] Or stop doing these six things that you are doing

[05:12] And by doing that then people will stop to try to be using the deck and so we had

[05:18] I said a teammate who was really high potential like really smart hardworking did all that stuff

[05:22] But somebody started happening and they started acting a little bit dickish and

[05:26] We had four leaders in my company have like sit down talks which normally wouldn't do but the person was really good at their job

[05:32] I was like I probably want to lose the productivity and so I was the last stop

[05:36] I was like it's me or your app

[05:39] So we got to figure something out here and you'd already been given a lot of

[05:42] Instructs a lot of don't be a dick be nicer things like that

[05:46] But that doesn't help anyone change their behavior and so fundamentally giving someone a frame of

[05:50] What I want to have happened is result of this conversation helps filter what you're actually talking about

[05:55] And so like me insulting them were making them feel bad doesn't actually do anything for

[05:59] Increasing the likelihood that they behave in a certain way most of the time it's just clarity

[06:03] Just like when you hop on the call and you tell people to do this stuff immediately

[06:07] They will not like you and if they don't like you they'll complain more

[06:10] Which makes it more like you get fired you don't want to get fired great

[06:13] So all you have to do is not do that at the beginning of the calls people stop describing that way

[06:17] He's like this is so eye-opening I didn't even know

[06:19] There was like four or five other items that I asked for specific examples so that I could say like stop doing these things and people stop calling you deck

[06:26] And within a month people are people like duties completely turned around it's like he just actually had specific instructions

[06:32] And so much of it's not only to do the hard work of saying like

[06:36] What is this person doing or what is this person need to do which is why I'm a big fan of checklist because it's like

[06:41] This is what you have to do when you onboard someone like check your hair make sure that there's not a bed in the background like

[06:49] Like yeah

[06:50] You're on boarding a customer and it's got like you know a pink bunny poster behind you and it's like that's probably not the first

[06:55] Impression I'm really looking for right so it's like these are the checklist that you go through

[06:58] It's like first you greed them by name second you look at the notes and you tell them about the goal and then when you took a recording of the onboarding calls like

[07:05] Why does Sarah suck and Caroline's great just they will Sarah?

[07:08] Here's the checklist you did three there's 11 items

[07:12] Sarah consistently or Caroline does you know nine out of 11 and hers consistently get higher scores

[07:17] Now if she if Sarah follows the checklist and she does all 11 and her

[07:23] Scores are way below the other girls

[07:26] Then it means the checklist is wrong which means that's on you not on her and so means that you're incomplete in terms of what you're trying to train them on and so sometimes

[07:32] It's useful to know that so both people are the checklist and they've objectively meet things and there's other things that you don't know go and so fundamentally

[07:40] Soft skills and hard skills are all just skills is just that

[07:44] Soft skills people just have a harder time teaching because it's bundled language

[07:49] And I think that's why so many people struggle teaching them

[07:53] So in training the team

[07:55] If you look back to your question

[07:57] I want to figure out what the problem is with the person so I can try and loop to these things if it's a training issue

[08:02] I try and break it down as much as I can really can if it's a motivation issue

[08:07] It really comes down to reinforcing stimuli so either people do things that

[08:12] Because they get stuff that they like or they avoid things they hate getting fired is usually a pretty

[08:16] Averse of stimulus so a lot of people will do things to just not get fired so it's fairly strong

[08:21] But the best performers do it do things because they just like doing them like the best employees the best teammates

[08:27] They just work all the time because the actual conditions of work are more reinforcing than an boss can be

[08:32] Right, which is why a lot of people like on my team for example with like a lot of editors and whatnot

[08:36] They just edit in the free time they picked up editing because editing itself is a reinforcing thing

[08:40] No one called cold calls in their free time

[08:43] Oh, yeah, I just picked up cold calling on the side

[08:45] Yeah, I just cold call like on my days off just because I just like it like no one says that

[08:50] But the thing is that sales and editing have very fast feedback loops and so you can immediately get off the call and get a reward

[08:56] You immediately get you see it edit and you catch a moment and there's this a lot of feedback loops that are really tight and good

[09:02] other roles have

[09:03] slower and longer feedback cycles and so as a manager you have to basically artificially input

[09:10] More feedback loops into longer project timelines or jobs that require more complex tasks

[09:16] um

[09:18] That motivate people through reinforcement and so a lot of people I think in the culture say oh so

[09:24] And did something crazy and so what we do is we say what happened that caused them to do it

[09:30] But we actually invert how behavior works

[09:32] Which is people do things because of what happens after they do them not because what happened before

[09:38] And so

[09:39] That's like what happens after you do stuff is the latency of training and that's how you train people and so

[09:45] I I get you out on human behavior stuff a lot but

[09:48] Motivation fundamentally comes from deprivation which is what are you most deprived

[09:53] So if somebody is very deprived of

[09:55] Praise which many people are giving praise motivate

[09:59] If someone gets praise all the time

[10:01] Praise my not motivate them

[10:03] Just depends on the person and so this is figuring out what are the reinforcing stimuli from someone's past

[10:09] That's getting to know your employees better so you can do the things that motivate them

[10:13] Money by the way has been conditioned is it universal

[10:17] Reinforcer we've learned in early age that this thing equals whatever we want

[10:21] So it's just a generalized reinforcement but there are more specific reinforce that you can give the individual people

[10:28] So yeah, that's that and then block you just unblocked the thing if you can afford it whatever the problem is

[10:33] So that's my little manifest on management

[10:37] Okay, great

[10:43] Find like more information to better understand these concepts because we're in a very in like human capital intensive industry

[10:50] Management is the the big piece that's missing for like every company and that's why so many people fail

[10:57] Where would I find like

[10:58] This in more depth and in more volumes so that I can understand these concepts better

[11:03] So I've got a special CTA for you today

[11:06] This excerpt was from a school day so this is from the school winners who came out

[11:11] They were the top 10 and they asked me about managing team and so I answered that question

[11:15] But if you don't have a business then none of that matters and so to start a business

[11:20] You can go to school.com we run the school games. It's for people who are just getting started in business

[11:25] And that's what that's for if you already have a business and you have a big team and you want to scale your team

[11:30] We run workshops occasionally at acquisition.com at our headquarters here in Vegas and so if you'd like to partake in one of our workshops

[11:37] You can go there and click the scale button and hopefully we'll see you soon

[11:40] So most of these concepts were derived from the ground up from just like rat studies with Dr. Cassie who you same Sam knows my good buddy

[11:48] And so I think most people

[11:51] Just do a lot of things and just like see what happens like it's very haphazard. I think almost no knows how to train

[11:58] Period. I said oh I feel like understanding human psychology like that was always my phone to even ignore psychology really

[12:05] I completely ignore it. I saw I would say that you talk a lot about it like

[12:09] Probably never heard me say the words like holiday not the words psychology, but what you're like maybe I'm blanking it

[12:14] Right so so to get no I don't want to get too far into that because I will go there

[12:19] So this is this is like for everyone like if you want to basically have your bullshitometer always turned on

[12:26] it's separating out

[12:28] When people give reasons because statements or just blank statements of like

[12:33] As the other day as someone is like there's only three ways so you can you know make the customer worth more and then they send them then they continue to send since I was like that's just false

[12:40] They just started the statement that way and a lot of people make statements that are just false. They have no idea what they're saying and so

[12:46] We walk through a framework when we're trying to basically detect bullshit

[12:56] Which is logic evidence utility which is what does this mean?

[12:59] How do you know?

[13:06] And so what?

[13:09] So I'll give an example. So I had um I had so many other days say I'm stressed because I'm lonely

[13:18] And I was like okay I was like

[13:23] What does lonely mean to you? It's a bucket of term, right? It's a bundle term

[13:27] There's like well I was like that on Friday night you have no detects or that people don't respond back to you or like what what is the

[13:35] What what is that mean to you because it's there's a thing there's an activity that occurred and then they describe that they chunk it up as loneliness

[13:42] But when you get two steps below that up to like what occurred?

[13:45] What was the action that got stunted or something that you wanted that you didn't get then you can get a lot more specific

[13:50] We're like okay, so then I say all right, so that was the lonely occurrence

[13:55] Now have you been stressed before when that wasn't happening?

[14:01] Yes

[14:02] Okay, so then how do you know that that thing has anything to do with your stress?

[14:06] They're completely decoupled right and it's like all right and

[14:12] Who cares your stressed have you been stressed when things are going well? Yes

[14:16] Have you been stressed when things are not going well? Yes, so in general you're stressed when you're alive

[14:21] Noted what's your point

[14:23] Right and so we like breaking this down allows you to just be less confused about other people say and so the reason I'm going here is because

[14:31] Most people are full of shit

[14:33] Not purposefully not maliciously they just don't know any better and so they just like parry out other things

[14:39] They talk about pop psychology

[14:41] Whatever and I for the most part have just erased feelings intentions

[14:46] Beliefs all of these words from my vocabular in terms of what influences behavior because I just only focus on what can we observe?

[14:53] Because if I would say this guy is really motivated I'd say how do you know what is motivation?

[14:57] Me, Deo I'd say can you motivate me? I was like to find motivation and she just likes to their melted

[15:02] And I was like right so you want me to answer a question that you can't define the word for

[15:05] So what's the likelihood you get what you want really low?

[15:09] And so the thing is is we ask questions about stuff all the time we can't define

[15:12] Which means maybe we need to ask better questions or at least know what the fuck we're talking about

[15:16] And so

[15:17] Anyways, I bring this up because

[15:20] If you go back to the motivation thing

[15:23] If I say this person's really motivated you'd say how do you know it's like while they do all the stuff

[15:27] It's like great then forget about the concept or label of motivation and just say this person does these things

[15:32] Great and so

[15:34] I don't care if you feel motivated or not if you do these activities people describe you that way

[15:39] And if you do these activities when I had the conversation with the the dick in particular right I said I want to be clear

[15:45] I don't care if you're a dick. I don't care if you hate everyone

[15:49] As long as you behave this way, it doesn't matter to me and so a lot of people spend all this time to be like

[15:54] There's the seven stages of awareness. I'm like how do you know

[15:59] How do you know that what's your evidence for that and so what?

[16:02] Like what are the activities someone has to do okay they have to see your ad great

[16:07] Then they have to

[16:08] Interact with it in some way they have to take an action so if you go through the leads book

[16:11] I walk through the lead stages in the book and it's only based on the observable

[16:15] They took a step then they give you their information they give you means to contact them

[16:19] Then after you have means to contact like you these are the things that like no one can like fight me

[16:23] Like these are the things they have to occur and so if you if you reason up from

[16:27] What can I observe with my eyes it makes life a lot easier

[16:31] Even when you're talking to like a

[16:33] spouse

[16:35] You're like okay, I'm really upset like okay

[16:38] What does that mean right now? How do you know here I'm just that and so what

[16:43] What do you want me to do about it and so think you're like when you say this

[16:48] What do you want me to do when you say like if someone says like you should know it's I'll play that game

[16:55] I'm hungry either means you would like me to go get you food

[16:59] You would like us to go get food together

[17:00] It could mean that you want space it could mean you're in a bad mood. I was like but I won't take one cue for six behaviors

[17:07] pick and then it makes things a lot easier

[17:10] And so you can start training really realistically like anyone in your company to behave a certain way

[17:16] I just saying when you say this what do you want to have happened

[17:19] And also when you're having the conversation with staff or employees or whatever

[17:23] Like sometimes we in the in the moment like someone disrespects you you want to like immediately insult them or whatever

[17:27] Right, but you're like okay well what I want to have happened well if I insult them

[17:33] They're going to be more resistant to me in the future

[17:35] But I need to have more influence over them not less so me counter punishing

[17:40] To prevent their they're they're thing in the future. It's probably going to be kind of productive

[17:44] And so what can I say that increases the likelihood that what I want to have happened happens and so it's like taking a second step forward

[17:50] I mean, I'm back to think what's to the second order of magnitude affect on their behavior or then when I feel like doing in the moment

[17:57] And so

[17:59] When you're trying to look for look at how do I manage people better or how do I train people better

[18:05] Most training is just not chunk down far enough

[18:09] And so the people who are successful and whatever your education thing is

[18:14] Come in more qualified than other people like if you ever had a student or a customer who you're like this guy's gonna win no matter what

[18:21] Right, it's not you because then

[18:23] Because they have a history of skills so they have a larger skill set

[18:26] That they bring to the table and so fundamentally

[18:29] The people who are successful with your program are lacking the things you teach the people were not successful

[18:35] Like those things and other things and so to have the most comprehensive training you would have to start with

[18:42] Here's how you write words

[18:44] Here's how you type here's how the internet works

[18:46] Of course you're not gonna do that because there's a base assumption which is what qualifies someone to be a customer of a certain level of skills

[18:52] It also works the same way with an employee

[18:54] There's certain level of skills that are required to work for this role

[18:58] And so if someone does have a deficiency then the question is what's the return on effort?

[19:02] I think I could teach someone who has Downsender to be an nearest a neurosurgeon

[19:05] Black with somebody good

[19:06] Right, it just might take 30 years and it's probably not worth it because for the same resources we get

[19:11] 2000 other neurosurgeons who don't have Downsender right and so

[19:16] If you think of your customers that way it's like in just simply thinking about things like take out character traits take out

[19:21] Believe whatever it's just I need them to behave this way

[19:25] That's it just break it down to the activities and it makes a lot easier and so fundamentally it's like I wish I were more

[19:31] Here's my biggest one more patient. I wish we're more confident if you just debundle those things and just say

[19:38] How do I break this down to the smallest level and how do I just do those activities? It makes it a lot easier

[19:42] And so usually when training does not work it's because we made an assumption of a skill set that they didn't have and so the more advanced

[19:50] Someone is the bigger the instruction convey so I can say

[19:54] Or say hey man you think you just market school and say sure

[19:58] That's it that's the directive. It's not like okay. Do you think you can make this many pieces of content?

[20:02] You think you we're on this many pieces of ad or like whatever it is right and if I'm like hey

[20:07] You can make an amazing product. He's making you so sure

[20:09] Like it's like do you think you'd have an activation sequence on boarding and we're gonna do these things

[20:14] Are returns I like I trust that he's do it because he has the skillset

[20:16] You trust that I can do it because I have the skill set and so fundamentally the more skill the person is the bigger the instruction can be

[20:22] And so if you have low level people you don't have a lot of room for vagueness

[20:26] You have to be more specifically instruction as people get hired higher up in your organization

[20:30] You can be vaguen vaguen vaguen with the instructions. They have more skills

[20:34] And so experts fundamentally just have more ways to be rewarded within the same context

[20:41] Like if you're really good at editing video then you have many things that reward you because you have more skills

[20:46] To really bad at it. There's very few things that reward you and so that's what mastery development is

[00:00] In this video, I want to talk to you about the growth that I had to go through as an entrepreneur

[00:03] going from 0 to 85 million dollars a year.

[00:06] And one of the things that I decided to stop doing, which is going home for the holidays.

[00:09] And I want to explain the decision making process around this.

[00:12] And this comes from, this is an older video that I did, released into a smaller community.

[00:17] And in that group, I can see the best performing videos.

[00:21] And now, out of 300 plus videos, this is among the top performing.

[00:25] And so people seem to very much like this.

[00:27] And as we're going into the holidays, at least the time of being posting this, I thought

[00:30] it would be timely.

[00:32] But it really doesn't matter what holiday you're celebrating.

[00:35] It's really a video about how to navigate our pasts and use them to walk with strength

[00:42] and conviction into the future that we choose to create.

[00:46] And a lot of time it comes from shedding old identities and learning how to unspeak the things

[00:51] that were spoken over us in our childhood, from our parents, from our friends, those who

[00:56] do not understand the path that you're trying to go on as an entrepreneur, those who think

[01:00] that what you're doing is stupid, those who just don't believe.

[01:05] And the thing of the day we need to believe, and we also need to create conditions that are

[01:08] conducive to the goals that we have in our lives.

[01:11] And so this video gives you the most tactical raw breakdown of how I did it.

[01:16] And I got so many people who told me that the video changed the lives in terms of how they

[01:19] approached their pasts and the people and the relationships that they maintain there and

[01:24] how to protect their space tactically in a way that will give you the attention back to

[01:31] allocate towards the things that matter.

[01:33] So, most of the nation, I hope you enjoy the video.

[01:36] This is just because a lot of entrepreneurs and I want you to crush it and there's a lot

[01:39] of people who are broken on what you're doing with them.

[01:41] See you in the end.

[01:42] Good morning.

[01:43] Happy Saturday.

[01:45] I'm really excited for this because I've actually had this concept on my mind.

[01:50] As peace, I'll be for the last two and a half weeks.

[01:52] I feel like it's been like in the back of my mind like percolating and whatnot.

[01:56] And it's combining with like four or five other ones and I like felt that this morning

[01:59] as I was eating breakfast, I was like all right.

[02:00] Today's the day when we make it.

[02:01] A reason I wanted to call this why I don't go home for the holidays.

[02:04] There's probably going to be some things that I say that are a little bit controversial, but

[02:07] there are things that have absolutely been some of the keys to our continued growth and success.

[02:13] And I thought you might want to hear them.

[02:16] And so I put the title as this for at least for right now.

[02:18] The success equals in great importance.

[02:20] So one of the reasons that I don't go home for the holidays is that a lot of people haven't

[02:27] grown since I left, right.

[02:30] They haven't had 10 years of growth.

[02:31] They've lived the same six months, 20 times, right, since I was gone.

[02:36] And when I go back, they want to meet me in my past.

[02:39] And so they want to speak things over me that aren't who I am anymore.

[02:44] And then because it's difficult for them to connect, right, their perception of who I

[02:50] used to be and who the person is standing in front of them, how they're reconciled.

[02:54] Thank you.

[02:56] Reconciling those two things is really difficult for a lot of people because it's breaking

[03:01] the box they want to put you in.

[03:03] But the reality is that most people don't change entrepreneurs do because we have to,

[03:09] right.

[03:10] We call it growth instead of change for the outside world, for the non entrepreneurs who stay

[03:13] in their same box every day, it's hard to calculate.

[03:18] And so I'll go home and they'll say, like my dad says that, so I'll say, you have

[03:22] the shortest views out of anyone.

[03:24] You just have such a short temper, anyone who is in our company, my wife, like, I mean, anyone

[03:30] who knows me and spends time with me would probably not say that.

[03:33] And so I will be very aggressive in combating that immediately because I'll be like, don't

[03:39] speak that over me.

[03:40] That's not true.

[03:41] That's not who I am.

[03:43] And it makes people really uncomfortable.

[03:46] And so there's a lot of times if I go see an uncle in order to meet if I'm at a holiday

[03:50] event.

[03:51] And then they're like, oh, Alexander, you've always been a little bit loose with the

[03:54] aqua, but I don't even drink anymore.

[03:57] You know what I mean?

[03:58] You're speaking about my past.

[04:00] And it makes people really uncomfortable.

[04:03] And I would implore you to meet those things head on.

[04:06] And the reason that I don't like going home for the holidays because I have to be on guard

[04:12] because when I when I leave, I feel like I have to like wash myself of the things that

[04:16] people were trying to speak over me.

[04:18] And it's constant.

[04:20] It's unending.

[04:21] It's incest.

[04:22] Right?

[04:23] They're constantly trying to put me back in the box that makes sense to them.

[04:28] I refuse to have that happen.

[04:30] And so when I have these conversations, it's passing comments.

[04:33] It's little things.

[04:34] It's never because most people aren't computational.

[04:37] Right?

[04:38] And so it's never, oh, like, you are like, you don't even like, it's not like that.

[04:42] But it's just like, oh, you know how you always are.

[04:44] And they'll say it even with like a smile, like it's like it's a good thing.

[04:48] But like you have to catch it because you know how it makes you feel when you hear it

[04:51] because you're like, that's not true.

[04:54] That's not me.

[04:55] Right?

[04:56] I'm done with that.

[04:57] That's in my past.

[04:58] Right?

[04:59] And so like this is why I am, I have to take like a week to detangle.

[05:02] And then basically, we speak over the things that I am or that I choose to be.

[05:07] It's one of the main reasons that I don't go back for the holidays.

[05:10] And I really, really don't like it.

[05:12] And I definitely don't like spending any portion of extended time there is because it feels

[05:16] like I'm going backwards.

[05:17] You know, what we are all as a community trying to accomplish is not normal.

[05:21] And we just have to come to terms with the fact that it is normal.

[05:25] It's okay that it's not normal.

[05:26] But it also means that normal people aren't going to like it.

[05:29] The higher up we go in business, I think, at least this is just my subjective understanding

[05:33] or how I'm perceiving it as I go through it.

[05:36] The more intolerant we become of people who try and it's even tones.

[05:44] Like I'll be like don't speak to me in that tone.

[05:46] Even if they're saying they're like, it seems disrespectful.

[05:48] It bothers me.

[05:50] And like you become more and more aware because you're like, let me teach you how to treat

[05:54] me.

[05:55] Right?

[05:56] And sometimes you have to do that.

[05:57] And especially when it's been a long period of time, you have to teach people how

[06:00] you like to be treated narrow.

[06:02] And a lot of times it's a lot different than it was when they first met you.

[06:06] And it's the hardest with family because I'll be really real with you.

[06:10] There's a lot of people that I'm connected with that I probably would never see again if

[06:14] I didn't have a blood relation.

[06:15] I manage our space very well.

[06:17] If we go back, it's only going to be for a short period of time because there's no other

[06:21] recent but that's the fact that we share a biological bond that I would ever see you.

[06:25] Because you don't have the same goals.

[06:26] You don't have the same values.

[06:28] You don't want to do the things I want to do.

[06:29] When we see each other, you make me feel worse.

[06:33] Why would I see you?

[06:34] Right?

[06:35] Everywhere with you guys.

[06:36] And maybe this is something that I'll look back at this video five years from now

[06:39] and I'll have grown more and I'll have more perspective.

[06:42] But that's where we are now.

[06:44] Being so intolerant of this stuff is so key to being able to grow.

[06:48] I'm telling you because that's why there's this, we keep such quiet space.

[06:53] Because it's the only place that you don't have to have your guard at constantly.

[06:57] Fending off what other people are trying to tell you about yourself.

[07:02] And so you can kind of build it while it's in its infancy and you're not a strong

[07:06] unit in these new attributes that you're trying to have.

[07:09] I was talking to a high level entrepreneur yesterday.

[07:12] Who's like, ah, I mean, I'm just horrible at details and I was like, don't speak that

[07:16] over your softhouse like because your business might need you to be good at details when

[07:19] you go from 10 to 20 minutes.

[07:20] Don't say that.

[07:21] And he was like, you're right.

[07:23] I was like, yeah, you choose, you're choosing an apigut at details.

[07:26] Do you really think that if your kids were going to die like because you need to learn

[07:29] to remember things you'd be able to do it?

[07:30] Like, oh, yeah, I'm like, all right, then you're choosing not to get out of it.

[07:33] That's your choice.

[07:34] That's your belief.

[07:35] And so like if you identify these things like, man, I'm getting really deep on this.

[07:39] I know.

[07:40] But like the identity is so fluid.

[07:43] We can change in an instant.

[07:45] Like Tony Robbins talks about this stuff all the time.

[07:47] Like the only moment that we're actually able to live in is right now.

[07:50] And so all of the things that we had before us are only stories that we can either choose

[07:54] to replay because they're positive attributes or choose to ignore if they're negative attributes.

[07:59] And a lot of us just stay in these loops of speaking these things over ourselves that

[08:03] don't even serve us.

[08:05] Right?

[08:06] One of my favorite things in the world, probably one of my favorites, like one of my profound

[08:09] things is we question all of our beliefs except for those that we truly believe.

[08:15] And those we never question at all.

[08:17] And I always, I love that because it just makes you aware of like I love catching

[08:22] myself on a belief that I've always had that I believe so thrown that I never actually thought

[08:28] to question because that's how much I believe them.

[08:31] It's just been there.

[08:32] And so like the higher we go the more we kind of uncover these beliefs about what's possible,

[08:38] what can we do, how can we grow, how quickly can change happen?

[08:42] You look at our business, right?

[08:43] Like we pivoted from a done 40 model to the done with you model that we have now in April

[08:49] of 2017.

[08:52] And so from April of 2017 until today, right?

[08:56] That's like 19 months.

[08:57] I think.

[08:58] We've gone from zero to arguably the biggest company in the brick and mortar chain

[09:04] fit as well.

[09:05] And we're like two or three times the size of anyone else who's like the second runner

[09:09] up 2019, we're going to probably three to four acts that I can say that pretty with

[09:13] along the certainty.

[09:14] And so like how quickly are you able to achieve what you want to achieve?

[09:18] Is it supposed to take a year because you're choosing to believe that it's supposed to

[09:22] take a year?

[09:23] How quickly can you onboard someone?

[09:25] Let me give you another story.

[09:26] We're about to do a very big launch for our legacy group, I can't tell you what it is.

[09:30] But a friend of mine launched a new service category in his business and it blew up overnight.

[09:35] He had a huge explosion of traffic, he was running like some ads and they just took off.

[09:38] Right?

[09:39] He couldn't do anything about it.

[09:40] And so he hired 30 people in 14 days first customer service team, 30 people in 14 days.

[09:47] And so when we had our Q4 planning, right, our Q4 planning, we had our customer service

[09:52] director and literally I love you to death.

[09:54] That has nothing to do up.

[09:55] But like this was what happened during the actual meeting.

[09:57] She was like, I feel comfortable saying that I can bring four people on every month between

[10:01] now and actually launch date, right, which would get us to probably 16 or so people, 16 to

[10:08] 20, right, by the launch date, which is going to be like three or four months away.

[10:10] And so then I told that story about my friend who had just done this, he hired 30 people

[10:14] in 14 days because he had to.

[10:17] And so a lot of times the necessity is one of the biggest things that allows us to break

[10:21] our beliefs because we have to, we have no other choice.

[10:24] And that's why we only have scripts and whatnot and the show rates double based on the

[10:28] fact that you know you actually are going to leave a location and you're not going

[10:31] to be able to sell that person, the tonality of how you're speaking to the prospect even

[10:35] though the words are the same.

[10:37] The fact that it's just what you believe that changes the outcome and the influence

[10:41] on the other person is like so cool to me.

[10:43] And so the question is like, how can we trick ourselves into believing what we need to

[10:48] believe in order to grow faster?

[10:50] I did this experiment three years ago where I put on like 35 pounds of muscle in six weeks.

[10:54] And I started and they asked me to write an article as muscle in strength.

[10:57] And I did it natural if you can choose to believe you're not.

[10:59] But I did.

[11:00] It was 35 pounds of muscle, but it was 35 pounds and there a lot of it was muscle within

[11:05] six weeks.

[11:06] And I started the article off, I saying like what if you actually had to gain 35 pounds

[11:11] in six weeks and get and add a hundred pounds to your, your bad 12 you do.

[11:14] And so I tried to put this could like these confines on myself.

[11:17] And I was like, I probably wouldn't just lift you know twice a week right for that lift.

[11:22] I probably lifted like once or twice a day.

[11:24] And then that's what I did.

[11:26] And then I got really, really strong, really fast.

[11:28] I added a hundred pounds to my pension six weeks and I was natural right.

[11:32] And I did that because of the confine like the confines that we put ourselves under.

[11:35] And so sometimes I wonder like what things are we allowing to be spoken over ourselves

[11:40] by others first.

[11:43] And then second, what things are we speaking over ourselves that we don't even know

[11:46] that we're doing.

[11:47] Concentrating, questioning like those things that we speak over ourselves has been honestly

[11:52] one of the biggest things that has allowed us to grow.

[11:54] I know that I haven't been as taxable in the last few content videos I would be

[11:58] going to film mine.

[11:59] I'm just just doing what's on my mind.

[12:01] We had Chris and Rob and Marna who flew out here because they want a competition that

[12:04] we were holding in secret.

[12:06] Anyway, so Chris and Rob and Marna came out.

[12:09] And they were like, we feel like we're stuck, right?

[12:11] We feel like we're in a bottleneck and like we just can't.

[12:14] We're just trying to break through.

[12:17] When I talked to them about it, the whole time they were here for the whole day, I didn't

[12:23] tell them a single tactical thing to do differently with their business, not one.

[12:27] But what we identified was the things that they were speaking over themselves and the things

[12:31] that they were choosing to believe about how quickly things can happen.

[12:35] And so I'll give you an example.

[12:36] I hope they don't mind Rob and Chris's wife didn't want to be in the gym anymore.

[12:40] She's like, it's not my passion.

[12:41] You know, like I kind of like now we're comfortable.

[12:43] Like I kind of want to do my own thing.

[12:45] So it was causing some strife in their relationship.

[12:48] Mostly because like, you know, she felt, you know, but true to him that she had to keep

[12:54] doing it, but then he felt guilty that you know, I mean, there's this kind of both sides

[12:57] of it, right?

[12:59] And so they were like, what we're going to let Rob and go, you know, she's going to leave

[13:02] in four months, right?

[13:03] So we're going to get four months.

[13:05] And then she'll get out of the business and I was like, why does she just get out

[13:07] to that?

[13:09] Like she doesn't want to do it.

[13:10] You don't want her there.

[13:12] Like why don't you just get out today?

[13:14] Like why are you choosing to believe that it needs to take four months?

[13:16] You know, like I guess it doesn't.

[13:18] It was like right.

[13:20] And so a lot of times like, I've just, this has just been recently for me.

[13:23] I've had a lot of conversations with guys who are doing five to 12 million a year in their

[13:30] businesses and a lot of them have been doing this a lot longer than me.

[13:33] And they're like, how have you freaking grown?

[13:35] So like, how are you hitting the numbers?

[13:37] You're hitting, how is the growth rate that you guys are having?

[13:39] Like how is it possible, right?

[13:41] And like we've really just like, I've just kind of not to be worried about this.

[13:45] But like we've just chosen to believe it's possible.

[13:47] We've really just chosen to believe it's possible.

[13:50] And a lot of times like if you talk to them and it's like, you see these guys who are really,

[13:54] really, really high up in the business world a lot of times, they do talk very non-to-act

[13:58] to go very much mind-tests stuff.

[14:00] And I think it's, and I used to really not appreciate it.

[14:03] But now I think I'm appreciating a little bit more because the reason that a lot of people

[14:06] are in success was because of the beliefs that they have because if you're going to remove

[14:09] and break those beliefs a lot of times, they will go find the tactics that are necessary

[14:13] to win.

[14:14] And the higher up you go, the cleaner people keep their space.

[14:18] And the reason they do that, the reason they keep it so quiet is so that they can pinpoint

[14:23] anything that comes in their area, right?

[14:26] Anything that's going to break or chip at them or just like, bother them in any way

[14:31] to keep this bubble around them.

[14:33] And then what that does though is that it gives them such clean perspective and

[14:37] vision on what's going on because a lot of times when I had these guys, like I said,

[14:41] about two or two, doing you know, five, six, 10 million a year and they're like, what's

[14:44] going on?

[14:45] It becomes really obvious.

[14:46] It's really, it's really apparent.

[14:48] I'll give you another example I had yesterday, I talked to a guy who's doing, he's

[14:53] going half a million a month right now.

[14:55] And he has a split between two businesses.

[14:56] He's got one business, it does like 400,000 a month.

[14:58] He's got one that does a hundred thousand a month.

[15:01] And he's like, well, the big, you know, the 400,000 a month business is my old business.

[15:05] It's the one that it's got all the complexity and I hate the customer.

[15:09] Just all this stuff, right?

[15:12] And then he's like, and then this business is really simple.

[15:15] It's super profitable.

[15:16] I'm running like three times the margin I run in that business.

[15:19] And he's like, so I just, I just can't figure out a group.

[15:24] And I was like, do you really can't figure out a group?

[15:27] He's like, yeah, I just, I get so much stuff going on.

[15:30] I was like, yeah, you should probably get rid of the thing that is a big headache for you

[15:34] and do the thing that you really like doing.

[15:36] I was like, do you think if you got rid of all of the attention that that 400,000 a month

[15:39] thing is sucking up, you'd be able to double the 100,000 a month thing.

[15:43] He's like, yeah, like easy.

[15:45] And I was like, cool.

[15:46] And why do you do that?

[15:47] Right?

[15:48] And it becomes really apparent and obvious to you on that outside.

[15:51] Like, I mean, these guys aren't dumb.

[15:52] You know what I mean?

[15:53] He's doing six million a year.

[15:54] He's not stupid.

[15:55] It's just the beliefs that we truly believe are the ones that we don't see.

[16:00] And so it's really interesting.

[16:01] And like, I think all the time, but I want to be riser.

[16:04] I want to have more discernment.

[16:06] And if you really, if you start to dissect, like, what is wisdom?

[16:09] Right?

[16:10] Wisdom is being able to see is two people are looking at the same situation.

[16:15] The riser person sees things that the other person does it.

[16:19] And so it's it's vision.

[16:21] It's being able to see what other people's going to see.

[16:24] And a lot of times they're just unseen chains that people have already chosen to tie

[16:28] themselves up with.

[16:29] And we're having a lot of jimminers.

[16:32] I've had just recently a string of jimminers who used up in like, man, if we're just stuck

[16:35] at 60,000 months, like, I don't know what this bottleneck is.

[16:38] And I always respond to them like, it's not the business model.

[16:40] Right?

[16:41] It's here.

[16:42] And it's, and it's, and I should probably respond more specifically.

[16:45] It's a belief that you have an identity that's holding you back.

[16:49] A lot of times, it's just because you're choosing your main plus money.

[16:52] Like no joke.

[16:53] A lot of people choose to make less money.

[16:55] So people, like, we have jimminers right now who asked, like, hey, like,

[17:00] I've got this campaign.

[17:01] It's crushing it.

[17:02] I think I'm going to turn it off for next month, right?

[17:04] Because it's like, we have a lot going on.

[17:06] But I'm like, if you want to choose to make less money, that's your choice.

[17:09] You know?

[17:10] And so we make these choices.

[17:12] If you, if you, if you order articulate them differently, you probably think they were ridiculous.

[17:15] And I had every conversation I've had just in the last two, I've talked to four entrepreneurs

[17:20] last two weeks that are doing five million or more per year.

[17:24] And each one of the conversations ended with, like, well, when you put it like that,

[17:27] I sound like an idiot.

[17:28] And I was like, well, are you?

[17:29] It's like, well, no, I was like, then you should probably change the way you're doing it.

[17:33] And so it's just these emotions and these beliefs that get in our way of like, what's

[17:36] is seem so obvious.

[17:38] And it's just because some, we are emotional bit.

[17:39] Right?

[17:40] We are.

[17:41] We make decisions for the motions when we try to logic it later.

[17:42] But when you look at things logically a lot of times, some of the answers are obvious.

[17:46] Well, I've got this trainer that I've had for two years, but they're such a pain.

[17:49] They never want to do anything of anything that's new.

[17:52] But I have some clients that that's still like them.

[17:54] Okay.

[17:55] Do you think that if you had a new trainer that was like,

[17:57] bought in that you would be able to grow more?

[18:00] So what it is is the fear of losing these few clients that are attached to this one trainer

[18:05] is outweigh the potential growth you would have from the key player that you know you

[18:09] need in order to make them all aware.

[18:10] And then when it's phrased that way, it becomes obvious.

[18:13] Yeah, I've got to let them go.

[18:14] But you don't have to perspective it until sometimes you just need something on the outside.

[18:19] Anyways, guys, thank you for spending Saturday morning with me.

[18:21] This was just something that was on my mind.

[18:23] And I just like, it was like, stirring in me.

[18:25] But being mindful of the things that people speak over you and the tone that they do it

[18:29] and just like, if you feel weird after someone says something, stop the conversation, catch

[18:35] it and then address it and be like, please don't speak to me like that.

[18:38] Please don't say those things about me.

[18:40] It really bothers me.

[18:41] I'm really working on this or I've worked a lot on this and I don't, I don't appreciate

[18:45] it.

[18:46] It really bothers me.

[18:48] And if that person cares about you, they will say, it's you if they don't get him out

[18:51] of your life.

[18:52] You don't need that.

[18:53] And the most important person to make sure that you're doing that with you.

[18:57] If you're the one who's saying, man, I'm just not good at details.

[19:00] I'm just, I hate employees.

[19:02] Good luck running a business.

[19:04] These are things I overhear, even in our group, like, please, you're idiots.

[19:07] Like, do you really think that that is a good belief to grow and repeat inside of yourself

[19:13] if you want to grow and scale a business?

[19:16] Probably not.

[19:17] Right.

[19:18] But being mindful of the things that you're saying because and then ask yourself, like, does

[19:22] this belief certain?

[19:23] And if it doesn't, you're going to go.

[19:25] So anyways, I hope you guys have an amazing weekend.

[19:28] I love you all.

[19:29] Thank you guys for giving me your attention.

[19:32] I know it's your most valuable resource.

[19:33] Thank you.

[19:34] I hope I gave you a good return on it.

[19:35] And I hope you guys have an amazing, amazing day.

[19:38] All right.

[19:39] That's a love.

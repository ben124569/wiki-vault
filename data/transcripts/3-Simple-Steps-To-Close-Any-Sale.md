[00:00] What's going on everyone? I want to make a quick video for you guys about the only three things to say when closing or selling and the reason this came up was

[00:08] Recently I was on I was coaching our sales team

[00:11] Just just going over game tape footage which is like hey house, you know, let's let's watch a sale from yesterday

[00:16] You know what we could what was done well?

[00:18] What was great? What was bad? What could have been proved et cetera and

[00:22] One of the the habits that some of our team gets in because our our sales team is really knowledgeable

[00:27] We call them business consultants because they really are I mean they really are business consultants

[00:31] You know what I mean and that's why it's sometimes it's harder to find good sales people because they have to have

[00:37] a really high level of understanding if you're going to like the higher level of the business that you're gonna be selling the higher level of X

[00:42] Retese the person talking them must have if they have no context that's why like low level transactional sales like if you're doing B to see

[00:48] You know, a supplement sales or the phone you really don't know need to have an ex and exquisitely

[00:53] You know knowledgeable

[00:56] Rep it's more about a very transactional process that's going to be very highly scripted minimal variability right whereas if you're talking about a complex business deal right

[01:06] Then you need to have a very good understanding of their business where there's potential opportunities et cetera

[01:11] Right and so sometimes it can be difficult because you may want to switch and this is especially true when it's

[01:18] If you were the owner of the business or you're you know

[01:20] Inter really involved in just a couple of sales people you may get into the mode of trying to teach which is one of the biggest

[01:27] Amestics but be

[01:29] One of the biggest hard things to not do

[01:33] There's some good words

[01:35] As a sales person right because if you're trying to close the deal you want to educate the person but the reality is

[01:40] That's not they're not going to listen to you until they buy and so there's no actual point in quote teaching

[01:45] But you do want to coach and that's something that I was talking about with my team yesterday is the difference between

[01:51] Teaching and coaching and so fundamentally there's only three types of statements that you come out of your mouth when you're selling

[01:57] Number one and most likely to be coming out is questions all right so if you don't know what types of questions

[02:05] Like for us I prefer question-based frameworks for more complex sales and the reason for that is these are the types of questions that we would need to know the answer to in order to work with someone

[02:15] It's also the only way that you can get someone to change their beliefs about something because ultimately the person

[02:20] Especially the more complex the higher level of the sale the the more the person has to come to the conclusion on their own that they should work with you and less feel

[02:27] Forster suggested hopefully that makes sense and so we should ask leading questions that lead them to the conclusion that they should work with you and you can solve their problems

[02:36] the second

[02:38] type of thing is a

[02:40] Restatement which means

[02:42] After they say something you say it back to them

[02:46] Which means that you understand and you are listening all right?

[02:50] So it's like so what I'm hearing is this is the primary issue that you've been trying to solve

[02:53] This is what you've done so far and this is why it hasn't worked. Is that sound about right? So that would be an example of a restatement notice

[03:00] none of these things

[03:02] Art arts are declarative statements of fact. I'm not teaching them anything

[03:06] All right, which is the same reason that people get in trouble and they do presentations to try and pitch they try and teach

[03:11] The thing is is person has to have their beliefs broken in order to take action and you're not providing value in a real way

[03:18] Because the reality is they're not going to execute on anything you teach them

[03:21] They will only execute if they have their beliefs broke it and believe you can help them and then that they can trust what you are saying

[03:26] This is like this was so hard for me to learn because in the very beginning when I started doing lunch

[03:31] I just wanted to go in and get on the phone and Jim's oh no, no, your pricing is all wrong. Gotta do this. You gotta do this. Gotta do this

[03:36] And they were just like take lots of notes and then end up getting off the call not buying and then be like well

[03:41] I don't even know this guy is I'm just gonna ignore it and so I didn't actually help them. I thought I was helping them

[03:46] But I was not actually helping them and I actually heard this from talking more a good friend of mine

[03:50] He said

[03:51] Everyone gets benefits from breaking beliefs only 10% of people get benefits from tactics and so you actually are providing more value on the call

[04:01] By questioning their beliefs because you're actually servicing a hundred percent of the people providing value

[04:07] Compared to trying to give tactical advice that only one out of 10 people may or may not use and likely the people who will use it are not buying for me

[04:13] So either way you're you're not benefiting your business and you're also not benefiting theirs

[04:17] That was a huge thing that I had to break with my own beliefs and so then you might be wondering well if I'm only asking questions and restating things

[04:23] How do I close the deal great great question glad you asked all right?

[04:28] And so what I like are short stories and so the reason we do this is that so we'd ask a question

[04:36] Ask a serious question. Hey, why are you here? What are you struggling with where you are right now?

[04:40] Are we trying to go what if you tried so far? How's it working for you?

[04:43] Why is this important? Does it matter like within the bigger context of of your life and what you're trying to do?

[04:48] Okay great. This is what I'm hearing. I think this is why you haven't been successful. Would you agree with that? Does that make sense?

[04:53] Fantastic. Do you want to hear our program works right?

[04:56] So at that point you'd enter quote the pitch right?

[04:58] Which is where you're gonna explain how the services work. This is where most guys and gals will just

[05:03] Blab right they'll just talk and talk and try and teach and about how they have the secret system and they and really

[05:10] I think Russell Brunzel calls it techno babble is like you talk about your

[05:13] Periodization you talk about your plan or you talk about your programs. We'll talk about the software is or whatever right and the round is they don't care

[05:19] And so all we have to do realistically is tell a story that illustrates what they're going to experience as a result

[05:27] all right and so

[05:29] if I were trying to sell

[05:31] You know, I'll just use Jim wants to simply example so I'm like listen fundamentally until you learn how to market your business

[05:38] You're never going to be free and

[05:41] Earlier you said that the goal when we asked for context is that you want to you want to be free you want this business to be able to run on its own

[05:47] Is that sound about right? Yes, okay cool. Well, then then do you see a world in which you're gonna be able to outsource the most important part of your business

[05:55] Which is acquisition lead generation Lee Nurtian sales. Do you feel like there's a world where you can just off load that

[06:00] Responsibility and then some of how I have a reliable business because what if that business goes out of business?

[06:04] Which is likely happens all the time then what right you're never actually going to be free until you learn this

[06:09] Which means you have to confront this either today tomorrow or 10 years from now

[06:13] But you're going to have to do it does that sound fair to use that makes sense

[06:16] Right and so here when I'm doing some trying to I'm telling I'm telling a story to break a belief

[06:20] I'm not saying let me show you how we're gonna teach you how to market

[06:26] Instead I'm saying we have to at least come to an agreement that you need to learn this skill does that sound fair?

[06:31] Yes, and then the next kind of mini story and if I if they didn't understand it

[06:35] Then it would be like well, this is the difference between given a fish and teaching a man to fish right now

[06:39] You need to learn how to fish for yourself right in order for this business to be sustainable for you right right?

[06:43] Right and so these are little analogies that you've already pre-packaged if I was selling

[06:49] Weight loss. I would say something like all right

[06:51] Well fundamentally you know fitness nutrition accountability need these three things fitness wise

[06:55] You're gonna have to come and work out here. We agree that you need to work out right right

[06:59] Why haven't you been working out so far? I don't know how fair enough is it also because you're not motivated to do it

[07:04] Yes, what if you actually what something that you like doing why like doing?

[07:08] I like watching TV cool what if what if working out with something that you look forward to as much as or more than watching TV

[07:15] If you liked working out more than watching television, which one would you think you would do?

[07:18] Why probably work out right?

[07:19] So our goal is not to get you to work out but learn to like working out more than watching television

[07:25] If we can accomplish that then we're gonna solve this problem for good. Does that make sense? Yes?

[07:29] Notice I told them they're going to have to work out. I did not talk about the the the exercise

[07:35] Saution we're gonna do the programming how we're gonna ramp up their volume

[07:38] They're underlating periodization the fancy exercise like none of that stuff we talked about because it doesn't matter

[07:44] We have to just come to an agreement that this is what we're going to be doing to solve the problem

[07:48] Does that make sense?

[07:49] Yes, they're intastically moving forward right and so you'll have these prepackaged ideas another example is a

[07:55] If I if I had somebody who was in I'm giving these examples to hopefully drive the point home if someone said

[07:59] You know you're gonna have to change the way you eat for example and I say okay, what you probably tried stuff in the past right

[08:04] I'm not gonna talk from the fucking meal plant right doesn't matter right?

[08:07] It does matter but not in this conversation. It does not matter

[08:10] Fundamentally you're going to change the way you eat because what you got

[08:14] Like why you are here is because of something you are currently doing does that sound fair?

[08:18] Right okay cool so again with this example

[08:21] I'd be like well, do you like cake do you like cookies? Yes, okay?

[08:24] So then the key do you think you could not let eat cookies for those your life?

[08:27] Do you think you can not eat cake or not eat ice for thrift or like do you think that's reasonable?

[08:30] No, I don't think that's reasonable cool so then we have to figure out a way for you to eat the things that you enjoy

[08:35] And still lose weight and do it in a way so that you look forward to it because if the end of the day if you like the food

[08:41] More than your currently eating you will stick with it does that sound fair?

[08:44] Yes because do you think that you can sustainably give yourself willpower for the rest of your life?

[08:48] No, okay, well then can we agree that all we have to do is just simply figure out the foods that you will like and that's an

[08:54] Interative process for us. We'll walk through it but the end goal is that you will like this more than your currently eating and as a result of that

[09:00] We'll stick with it which means that over the long haul you'll get to where you want to go. Does that sound fair?

[09:04] Yes, notice again. This is an explanation. This is a this is a mini story. This is an analogy

[09:10] That will use and you should have multiple of these so you can drive the point home if you feel like the prospect

[09:14] Does not understand what you are saying right and so this is where we are we are coaching based on beliefs

[09:20] We are not explaining or

[09:23] Tacticalizing or techno babbling about our program because fundamentally it does not matter

[09:29] They don't care normal. They listen. They're not even paying it whenever you have a monitor

[09:34] You can see it in gone recordings if you don't record this you can see talk time you can see where it engagement goes down and

[09:40] In invariably it's when a salesman gets to this part of the pitch and then they talk for five minutes straight

[09:47] No one cares

[09:48] I'm sure like I'm sure that when you've been if you've ever been sold something you feel like the person isn't listening to you

[09:54] right and so what I can say is the best way to sell is to have the person feel like you understand

[10:03] And the best way for someone to feel understood is for you to actually give a shit if you actually give a shit

[10:09] You will know what questions to ask in what order because those are the questions that you would actually ask the reason

[10:14] Scripts were even invented is to mimic or structure a

[10:18] Conversation between somebody who cares and someone that they can help

[10:22] That is what a sale is is we're we're breaking their beliefs

[10:26] We're coaching them to the conclusion that they have not been able to make up at this point

[10:29] Which is that they need to work with us in order to solve their problem and we should be okay with the fact that I would like to provide

[10:34] Vow to this person so that I can break their beliefs around this whether they work with me or not

[10:37] This is still the type of solution that they're going to need and if you can approach it like that

[10:42] You stop having your ego tied up in your closing percentages in your numbers and instead you start helping people on the phone and by extension

[10:47] You will sell more deals, right?

[10:50] And it's not by proving your

[10:52] expertise and and ego ego babbling about how smart you are right instead

[10:57] It's asking them questions make sure they understand that you're that you're tracking what they're saying

[11:03] asking more leading questions

[11:05] restating what they said and then when they ask you about how they could potentially work for you then and only then

[11:10] You give them the stories to explain how it works

[11:14] That's the deal and one of the big rules that I was hitting on with our sales team yesterday is

[11:19] You do not pitch the program and so you believe the person will say yes

[11:25] Lawyers do not ask questions. They do not already already know the answers to no guy

[11:29] Most guys don't propose to someone without already know the person's gonna say yes

[11:33] The the take rate on proposals is very high, right?

[11:36] Let's be real most you know girls say yes to a proposal most right?

[11:40] I'm not saying all but most do and sales should be the same way if you feel like you don't think you're gonna close this person

[11:48] Do not pitch them continue to stay in this circle where you are asking questions and

[11:53] Reinstating and clarify until you can eventually find that that piece that thread that was

[11:59] Unexposed that you need to pull to then get them to say that aha that's the issue right and so from this

[12:05] The three things that you should be using when you're closing is you should be asking questions

[12:09] Should be restating what they said and then once you've exhausted these pieces where it becomes obvious that they need to move on the sale

[12:16] Only at that point they'll say well, how do I how do I work with you? How does the program mark they should be asking you or you can at the very least say

[12:22] Would you like to know the program works? I think it might be a good fit for you at that point

[12:25] They can give you permission to say yes now if someone says yeah, hey hey hey

[12:29] Tell me how the program works. That's like no, I don't think we're ready for that right now

[12:32] I need to understand more about your business otherwise. It's not gonna it's not gonna make any sense

[12:36] I don't have enough context right and again when you do that you can retake the frame in the conversation

[12:41] If someone's commanding you around you're not gonna close the deal right and so a lot of times

[12:45] Usually within the first five to ten minutes you can tell whether you're not gonna close the deal most people most experienced sales people

[12:50] No by how the first five to ten minutes go whether this person's really even five minutes

[12:56] You can tell whether you're gonna be able to close this person or not and if you don't feel like you're gonna be able to close this person

[13:01] It means you need a state shift you need to shift the frame and the only way to do that is to ask questions

[13:06] That are challenging one of the things that my team say is closures ask hard questions

[13:10] Right is ask questions that are gonna challenge their current paradigm if they're gonna current paradigm that they're getting on the phone

[13:15] Because they want to prove to themselves that nothing's gonna work for them. Then you need to say it sounds like

[13:20] It sounds like you're out of luck. It sounds like your business is kind of there's no way for you to succeed

[13:25] Does that sound about right?

[13:27] And then they're gonna sell you on why you're wrong

[13:29] But by selling you on why they're wrong they're taking a contrarian stance which then first you that there is a way rather than saying no

[13:34] I think you can be successful

[13:35] They're like no, I can't be successful right and so understanding that before you get into your pitch

[13:40] The person must already be sold and working with you is one of the biggest things I can give you right now

[13:44] So if your script has too many paragraphs and too much explanation and all of that stuff then it's off

[13:50] It just needs to be questions and restating for clarification that you are hearing what they're saying and

[13:55] Assing the next national question that will lead logically to them working with you and asking the question at the end

[13:59] Which is well how do I do this that sounds amazing? It's exactly what one like how do I move forward with details?

[14:03] Etc. And then at that point you say cool. This is how it works ready rock roll. All right very enough

[14:09] Hope to make sense keep being awesome lots of love and I'll see you guys on folks like bye

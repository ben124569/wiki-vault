[00:00] One of here's something insane, every six seconds acquisition.com,

[00:04] hopefully your companies get a new lead.

[00:06] So I'm going to teach you how to get new customers so fast,

[00:09] it feels illegal.

[00:10] And as I've done this, we've gotten three leads,

[00:13] one of the first seconds, one of the six seconds,

[00:14] one of the 12 seconds, and right now,

[00:16] we just got another lead.

[00:18] And so the first way to do this,

[00:20] every business wants more leads,

[00:22] but none of them want to give good stuff away for free.

[00:25] And so my favorite marketing strategy

[00:28] for getting tons of leads is step one,

[00:32] look at what other people are charging for.

[00:34] Step two, look at the hard costs

[00:37] of what it would cost for you to deliver it.

[00:39] Step three, give that thing away for free.

[00:43] Step four, see how many leads you get.

[00:46] Step five, see how many you convert.

[00:49] So this is the idea, is that you can give something

[00:51] significantly better away for free than everyone else does.

[00:54] Ideally, something that other people actually charge for.

[00:58] And when you really want to be a savage about it,

[01:00] which why wouldn't you want to be a savage about it,

[01:02] you make it even better than what they have.

[01:05] Now, number two, these kind of bets are hard for an employee

[01:09] to make, because if you are somebody who's an awesome marketer,

[01:15] or that's your primary skills,

[01:16] your good at promotion, good at advertising,

[01:18] then I have made this mistake before,

[01:21] and I've gotten too far away.

[01:23] So this is where everyone's working,

[01:25] everyone's doing this, I don't know why it's a hashtag,

[01:26] but this is what work looks like,

[01:28] and this is me over here, not doing the work.

[01:31] What happens is this distance basically delutes down

[01:34] in my marketing skills,

[01:36] and I end up basically having a department

[01:39] of people that are using their best skill set rather than mine.

[01:44] And so the business loses the biggest asset it has,

[01:47] which is me or you.

[01:49] And so, like Mr. Beast is still involved

[01:52] in the creation of his videos.

[01:54] Steve Jobs still approved every final ad

[01:57] that went out for Apple, so legend says.

[01:59] And so I think that the traditional setup

[02:02] is for the most part, made by corporates,

[02:05] who aren't founders, who aren't driving output,

[02:08] they're just like meeting quarterly earnings,

[02:11] they're not really changing the world.

[02:13] And so I have put my big, kind of, words on this.

[02:18] And what that means is that you're gonna have to back up.

[02:25] Your investment in talent with finances.

[02:28] And so what I mean by that is if you were to build

[02:32] a department and say, okay, I need to hire a few people

[02:36] for 75,000 dollars a year, okay, just use it as simple math.

[02:40] Well, those may be a player's, be players, see players who knows.

[02:49] But an A player may be able to do quite literally

[02:53] five times, 10 times the output, 25 times the output

[02:58] of a B player.

[02:59] And so marketing is one of these roles

[03:01] that has tremendous leverage.

[03:03] And so in thinking about this,

[03:04] I think I've changed the way that I see building marketing

[03:07] departments phenomenally, which is

[03:11] most similar role in a business that I can think of

[03:14] that we have in the portfolio is actually a developer.

[03:16] So here me out.

[03:18] Developers typically have technical career paths,

[03:21] which means that you can be a level one, level two,

[03:23] level three, level four, and five, all the way up.

[03:25] And as they go up, they make more money.

[03:27] And the reason for that is because one amazing developer

[03:30] can make something that millions of people see.

[03:33] So one of the old legends of Google is that there is a

[03:35] particularly amazing coder.

[03:37] They had bought some old version of Google Maps

[03:39] as an acquisition.

[03:41] They kept trying to do what the code.

[03:42] And then one really high leverage coder

[03:45] remade the entire product over a weekend.

[03:48] And then that is ultimately what became the code base

[03:51] that we still use today as Google Maps.

[03:53] And so one man made that.

[03:55] That's how much skill he was able to bring to the table.

[03:59] Now, here's where it makes sense for a business perspective.

[04:02] That one guy, maybe you have to pay him 10 times more

[04:06] than a traditional coder.

[04:08] But if that guy can make a million times the output

[04:11] of one guy, then it's still an amazing deal.

[04:15] And so the thing is that there is outside returns

[04:17] on talent at the top end.

[04:19] And there's a reason that the biggest technology

[04:22] companies, the biggest companies in the world,

[04:24] are in a war for talent.

[04:26] I was thinking about this as it relates to marketing

[04:28] because in many of the businesses that I've started,

[04:31] marketing has been traditionally understaffed

[04:33] or overstaffed rarely appropriately staffed.

[04:37] It's understaffed when it's really just me

[04:39] and like a couple people.

[04:40] And when we do that, it's because I have a ton of skills

[04:44] in marketing.

[04:45] And so we can get away with very few people.

[04:48] On the flip side, when I get too far away,

[04:49] I usually bring someone in and they just bring a lot of bodies.

[04:52] But what ends up happening is that the output goes down a lot.

[04:55] And so at Jim launch, there was a period of time

[04:57] where we had 17 people in marketing.

[04:59] And once I got rid of the leader, I moved in

[05:02] and I took the team from 17 to five

[05:05] and then output tripled.

[05:07] And so I say this because the people who have skills

[05:10] are the ones that are moving the needle.

[05:11] And so if I have three guys for 75K

[05:17] and they create three X output,

[05:20] one of the really interesting things about knowledge works,

[05:23] specifically marketing, coding is one of these.

[05:25] Is that the difference between the best guy

[05:28] and the worst guy in marketing

[05:30] isn't like the best guy who can cut a lawn

[05:34] and the worst guy who can cut a lawn.

[05:35] The worst guy who can cut a lawn

[05:36] maybe you take some an entire day.

[05:37] And the best guy, maybe you take some,

[05:39] you know, a third of a day

[05:41] because you're spreading the whole time.

[05:42] So maybe you get a three X increase

[05:44] because somebody is better.

[05:46] And so you'd be limited by how much you'd be able

[05:48] to pay someone more for that quality and that speed.

[05:52] Whereas with somebody in marketing,

[05:55] somebody who's a zero marketer versus a 10 marketer,

[05:58] the 10 marketer might literally be able to do

[06:00] 100 million times more of the output.

[06:03] Because one guy with skill and an iPhone

[06:05] can get a 100 million view video.

[06:07] And that kind of leverage is why it pays to pay better.

[06:11] And so this is something that I've been obsessed with

[06:14] of late and I'm trying to relay this

[06:17] to each of the portfolio founders

[06:18] in making sure that we're keeping the marketing divisions tight

[06:22] so that we have the highest leverage people

[06:25] in the highest leverage positions

[06:26] with incentivized performance

[06:29] so that they access their discretionary effort

[06:31] to maximize their skill sets.

[06:33] The most important thing that you can take away from this

[06:37] is that the best advertisers don't need many people.

[06:41] And if you have no one who's in your,

[06:43] quote, marketing department, that means you.

[06:46] And it's a game that you have to learn.

[06:48] There are a few things that every founder has to learn

[06:50] at a basic level.

[06:52] You have to know the core business.

[06:53] You have to know how to get customers.

[06:55] You have to know how to deliver customers.

[06:56] Just about everything else you can outsource.

[06:58] But those two things are core to every business.

[07:01] And so if you don't know how to get new customers,

[07:03] you need to fix that.

[07:04] So the next big one that can get you

[07:07] more outsized customers than anything else

[07:08] is answering a specific question,

[07:11] which I ask is a great thought exercise with our team.

[07:14] Is what would it take to be number one?

[07:26] And another way of asking this question

[07:28] is what else would have to be true

[07:31] for us to be number one in our market?

[07:33] And so when we actually hypothesize about this, we think,

[07:36] OK, what would it look like for us to be number one?

[07:39] What else would have to be true?

[07:41] What else would have to have occurred?

[07:42] What's interesting about this question is that it circumvents

[07:46] the traditional incremental thinking.

[07:48] Meaning, instead of saying, OK, we're just going to do 10% more.

[07:50] We're going to do 10% better.

[07:51] We're going to do 20% better.

[07:52] When you start with the end in mind for me,

[07:55] what would it take for us to be number one?

[07:57] We assume the goal outcome.

[07:59] And the craziest thing about this question is that you

[08:02] might be one 100th size of the number one player in the market.

[08:05] But it assumes what it would take to be a hundred times bigger.

[08:09] And then it gets reverse engineered into the present.

[08:12] And so what happens oftentimes when I ask this question

[08:15] is they usually state one or two key big things

[08:19] that would have to happen for the business to be number one.

[08:22] And then I ask, what would it cost for us to do that?

[08:26] Do we have the resources in order to make that happen?

[08:29] And more times than not,

[08:30] we actually have the resources to make that happen.

[08:33] Then the next actual question is,

[08:35] then why are we not putting every one of the resources we have right now

[08:38] towards making that come true rather than just continuing on the path that we're on?

[08:43] And so this is an order of magnitude increase in terms of business growth

[08:48] and ultimately what generates the most leads and customers.

[08:51] And so when I asked myself this question years ago,

[08:55] it was, what would it take for me to be the number one business channel?

[08:59] Right? What would it take for that to happen?

[09:01] The question beyond that was, what would it take for us

[09:03] to be able to have one of the best investment firms in the world?

[09:06] And I was like, well, I would have to have many, many, many,

[09:08] many more years of experiences.

[09:09] I don't know if I can do that.

[09:11] I can't make time happen faster.

[09:12] So then I followed with, okay, so for me to be the best investor,

[09:16] then what I would want is the most deal flow.

[09:18] So what are the different ways of creating deal flow?

[09:20] One of them is you can just go to broker networks.

[09:22] So you go to investment bankers, you get them to send you deals,

[09:26] and then you bid on those deals.

[09:27] But if I want to be the best investor in the world,

[09:29] then I need deals that only come to me.

[09:31] And so I was like, okay, well, thankfully,

[09:33] I'm pretty good at marketing.

[09:34] And so I was like, why don't I, like,

[09:36] what would have to be true for me to get lots of inbound deal flow?

[09:40] And I was like, okay, well, probably building a massive brand

[09:42] around business.

[09:43] And so then the question was, how do I build the number one brand

[09:48] business online?

[09:50] And so it's the series of questions that I asked,

[09:52] and then it was, okay, well, I should probably start making

[09:55] content around this.

[09:56] And I should probably write a book or something that would

[09:59] do really well, that is in the business space,

[10:02] that business owners would read.

[10:04] And then think, wow, this guy knows what he's talking about.

[10:06] And so by doing those things, by publishing the books,

[10:09] by making the content consistently.

[10:11] And the moment I realized that that was what it would take,

[10:13] I basically put all of my resources to work doing that,

[10:16] despite the fact that in the moment,

[10:17] it basically meant nothing.

[10:18] It meant that I had to go write a book,

[10:20] it meant that I had to start making content.

[10:22] But I did all of those things because I thought,

[10:24] for me to be number one, I need to have proprietary Diffla.

[10:27] For me to have proprietary Diffla,

[10:28] I need to have a big business brand.

[10:30] For me to have a big business brand,

[10:31] I need to make more content that's better than everybody else.

[10:33] And so that's what I'll start doing now.

[10:35] And that's why I allocate my resources.

[10:37] Even though I could have done a lot of different things,

[10:38] that was the one that I felt at the time,

[10:40] we could be the most leverage.

[10:41] And so far, it has worked out.

[10:43] But asking that type of question,

[10:44] you don't get to that type of solution

[10:46] unless you ask the what would it take to be number one.

[10:49] And then sometimes the answer surprised you,

[10:51] because you do have the resources to do it,

[10:53] you just haven't yet.

[10:54] And the reason this question is so powerful

[10:56] is actually from Stephen Schwartzman.

[10:58] So in his book or his autobiography,

[11:01] I think it's what it takes, I think it's what it's called.

[11:03] He has this really amazing opening couple of chapters.

[11:06] And he talks about this idea of thinking big.

[11:09] And he says, building a really big business is hard.

[11:12] Building a small business is hard.

[11:13] So basically, it's just about as hard to do anything

[11:16] because hard is a constant.

[11:18] See, you might as well go after something really big

[11:20] with the equivalent amounts of hardness.

[11:22] Now, we can get into difficulty levels or whatever.

[11:25] But basically, the upside of the incremental increase

[11:29] in hardness is outsized.

[11:32] And so if you want to build a really successful restaurant,

[11:35] it's going to take you a really long time

[11:37] if the man has lots of people.

[11:38] And it's a tough business.

[11:40] And if you want to build one of the top software companies

[11:42] in the world, it's also going to take a long time

[11:44] and be really hard.

[11:46] But one of those could get you into the many billions.

[11:48] And one of them will probably cap it a million dollars

[11:50] or two million dollars a year.

[11:52] And so in thinking about that, both of them

[11:55] require the same internal resources from you,

[11:57] but very different external resources.

[11:59] And so it's like you might as well solve for the biggest thing.

[12:01] And this is about resourcefulness and resources.

[12:04] If we wanted to be number one in the market,

[12:06] part of having proprietary DIFLO comes with two big advantages.

[12:10] And this works to say if you're selling customers,

[12:12] the same idea, selling a vacuum.

[12:13] But there's two different ways that you can sell to vacuum.

[12:16] And the reason selling to vacuum is so important

[12:18] is because when you sell to vacuum,

[12:19] you no longer have to compete on price

[12:21] or in mind since terms.

[12:23] And so the first is you sell where no one else is selling.

[12:28] So that's you find the little pond where there are no other fishermen

[12:31] and then you fish there.

[12:32] And you get all the fish you want.

[12:33] The second way is to sell something that no one else sells.

[12:38] And so one is a where thing and the other is a what thing.

[12:44] So either you create something unique

[12:46] that you have some sort of feature or service

[12:48] that no one else can do because you have some sort

[12:50] of technological advantage.

[12:52] Fundamentally, this is what Elon does

[12:53] and everyone of his businesses.

[12:54] He's happy to go where it's super competitive,

[12:56] but he just sells something that no one else can sell.

[12:58] And then he can command premium price for it.

[13:01] The alternative is to be good at providing value at scale.

[13:06] Two people show you get inbound demand.

[13:08] And then at that point, they're not chosen between you

[13:10] and six other people.

[13:11] They're saying, I'm either working with you

[13:13] or I'm not doing it.

[13:14] All right, this next one is huge,

[13:16] which is pre is greater than post or an ounce of pre is

[13:23] where the pound of post.

[13:25] All right, so as I've advertised in many different ways

[13:29] and many different channels for different industries,

[13:31] I have seen this consistently be reinforced to me.

[13:35] What happens for most people is they forget to advertise

[13:38] and then they try and play catch up

[13:39] and they hop in front of the camera,

[13:40] they sit in front of the computer

[13:41] and they start typing things into the doubt.

[13:43] And then they hit post, they hit submit,

[13:44] they run the ad, they post content.

[13:46] This then gets propagated as the process.

[13:50] And so they hire more people

[13:51] and then they more or less do the same thing.

[13:53] And then when the stuff sucks,

[13:54] they say it will fix it in post.

[13:57] But the problem is is that post has very low leverage

[14:00] and very high cost, whereas pre has incredibly high leverage

[14:04] in very low cost, but it just takes more mental work.

[14:07] So let me break this down.

[14:08] An idea for a video, for example, has tremendous leverage,

[14:13] more leverage than just about everything else.

[14:16] If there is a video concept that more people would click

[14:20] and watch to see that idea itself even poorly executed,

[14:24] we'll get an order of magnitude,

[14:27] greater amounts of people to watch the content

[14:29] or watch the ad than otherwise.

[14:32] And so putting more time into pre

[14:34] is the highest leverage activity that you can do.

[14:37] And so more of my time now, when I make ads, for example,

[14:42] for school, I will spend on the pre-production.

[14:45] That will be looking at past ads that performed well,

[14:48] looking at the hooks that continue to do well,

[14:51] making sure that we have some props and things like that

[14:54] that we can use as visual aids.

[14:55] And then when we actually do the recording,

[14:57] it's very short.

[14:58] And the post production, because all of the work

[15:00] is already in the video, there is very little

[15:03] that must be done afterwards.

[15:04] And so what happens is the rate of progress

[15:07] and output increases to use a big word tremendously.

[15:13] And so the only reason for post production,

[15:16] especially in education, is to enhance comprehension,

[15:21] meaning to make it easier for people to get with the video

[15:24] is about.

[15:25] And this is different than an entertainment

[15:28] where a lot of the emphasis is on post,

[15:31] but for the vast majority of businesses,

[15:33] they're advertising and marketing

[15:35] comes down to educating the customer, or potential customer.

[15:38] And if education is the type of advertising you do,

[15:41] which is what most businesses do,

[15:43] then you need to put more into,

[15:46] do people find this interesting,

[15:48] can I make it simple, rather than,

[15:50] I'm just gonna hit record and see what happens.

[15:52] Yeah, and the thing that shifted my perspective on this

[15:55] was, I think it's called Calculus Walla,

[15:57] but it's this Indian channel

[15:59] where there's a guy who's like 20 million subscribers,

[16:02] and he teaches like physics walla and like calculus

[16:05] and these different classes.

[16:06] And his videos get like 10, 20 million views,

[16:09] just like crazy, crazy numbers,

[16:11] and it's just a dude and a whiteboard.

[16:13] And when I saw that, I was like,

[16:15] I am missing the boat here,

[16:17] like I am doing it all wrong.

[16:19] And so we have consistently stripped back

[16:21] more and more of this post-production,

[16:23] put more and more of it into pre.

[16:25] So this video, for example, like I have notes,

[16:28] rather than just kind of like winging it

[16:30] and then having the team just like cut everything

[16:33] that was not as good up, right?

[16:35] Instead, it's like, okay, let me be more purposeful

[16:37] about the points that I wanna hit,

[16:38] make sure that they actually make sense in sequence.

[16:41] So that afterwards, they don't have to reorder the video

[16:43] and then cut out this thing and then say,

[16:45] could you recate this part, it was unclear.

[16:47] It's like I have examples, I have clear language

[16:50] that I've already thought about ahead of time

[16:51] so that I can ultimately make a better video for you

[16:54] and also an easier video for my team

[16:56] to be able to produce so that we can make more faster.

[16:59] Adding razzle dazzle and whiz bangs

[17:01] is not gonna make a video more educational.

[17:05] So this next one is a really high leverage concept,

[17:08] which I overheard this for the first time

[17:10] from a marketer named Perry Belcher

[17:12] and it was, I don't think you even use this term,

[17:15] but need to believe, all right?

[17:17] And so need to believe are basically like,

[17:20] you want the fused amount of need to believe

[17:23] for a customer to make a purchasing decision.

[17:25] And so I'll give you a bad example of a business

[17:27] that I had and then I'll give you a good example.

[17:29] So with prestige labs, one of the difficulties

[17:32] that I had was that I had to convince someone of two things.

[17:35] I had to convince gym owners that they should sell supplements.

[17:38] Not all gym owners want to sell supplements.

[17:40] Some gym owners are against supplements,

[17:41] but I had to convince them that selling supplements

[17:43] was not a bad thing.

[17:45] Then I had a second thing that I had to convince them of,

[17:47] which is that prestige labs was a supplement

[17:49] that they should use.

[17:50] And so I had two need to believe.

[17:52] And so it made it a very difficult sale

[17:55] to get some of cause it was just too much

[17:56] basically education and too short a period of time.

[17:59] Now, over the long haul, could you do something like that?

[18:02] Yes, knowing what I know now,

[18:03] I'd probably have a multi-layered campaign,

[18:05] and one that basically gets the first big decision.

[18:07] And then a second kind of campaign later

[18:09] for warmer audience, kind of like middle of funnel,

[18:11] that would then convert people into specifically

[18:13] prestige labs, affiliates or sellers, retailers.

[18:17] But that's a lot of work,

[18:18] and you're definitely not going to make sales quickly.

[18:20] And alternative to that is that if you look at

[18:23] most of the real estate investment space, right?

[18:27] So anybody who has funds,

[18:29] who invest in real estate, who flip real estate,

[18:32] who help people flip real estate,

[18:33] find their first properties, whatever.

[18:35] There's this need to believe that doesn't really exist

[18:38] that real estate helps you make money.

[18:40] Most people generally agree that real estate is an asset class,

[18:44] but any people have made money in real estate.

[18:45] And so there's just not a lot that has to be believed

[18:48] for someone to say, okay, well, you are good at real estate.

[18:51] I will buy your thing to help me get good at real estate.

[18:54] And by buying it, it means either I give money

[18:57] to your fund and then you do it on one behalf

[18:58] or you help me source deals or whatever it is.

[19:02] And when we think about the ultimate business opportunity

[19:04] of all time, which I think is Amazon, Amazon itself,

[19:08] fundamentally had the proposition to anybody

[19:11] who wanted to sell anything.

[19:13] All you have to do is upload your product onto our site

[19:16] and you can make money.

[19:18] There's almost no, like you don't need to know how to market.

[19:21] You don't need to know how to sell.

[19:23] You don't need to handle customer service or customer support.

[19:26] They took away every conceivable reason for someone

[19:29] that they would have to believe in order to be successful.

[19:31] They were like, you just need to follow this tutorial

[19:34] and then just upload your product.

[19:36] Like, that's it.

[19:38] And so as a result, Amazon has made a tremendous amount of money.

[19:41] And so the only real need to believe

[19:43] is that someone else might buy my product on Amazon.

[19:46] And so people believe that and then they buy.

[19:48] So it's like, they barely even have any to believe.

[19:50] It's like a half belief, right?

[19:52] And so when I think about products and offers,

[19:56] I think what must a customer believe in order

[19:59] to make this purchase?

[20:00] And do I have multiple hums or hills that I have to get over?

[20:03] And ideally, I want to reposition or repackage the product

[20:07] and offer in such a way that there's either no beliefs

[20:09] they have to believe or only one.

[20:11] And so if you're struggling to get more customers

[20:14] and you want to get crazy amounts of customers quickly,

[20:16] you will not limit the amount of things

[20:17] that they need to learn or need to believe in order to buy.

[20:20] And the reason that giving away tons of free stuff,

[20:23] like I mentioned at the very beginning,

[20:25] is powerful is that it will basically move more people

[20:28] from someone who needs more information,

[20:30] to someone who needs less information.

[20:32] And so fundamentally, this is what branding is on a large scale,

[20:34] is that you're educating a large percentage of the audience

[20:37] and conquering some of the need to believe

[20:39] before they make the purchase.

[20:40] If you try to go create an old grave in one move,

[20:42] you will usually sell a smaller percentage of the marketplace,

[20:44] unless you have figured out how to make that six inch put,

[20:47] a six inch put for everyone, like Amazon has.

[20:50] Same thing with Uber.

[20:51] It's like, what do you have to believe

[20:53] in order to make money on Uber?

[20:55] You just have to be able to download an app,

[20:57] upload your driver's license, not have DUIs,

[20:59] or whatever the requirements are,

[21:00] and you have to have a car.

[21:01] And so as long as you believe that, when you're phone dings,

[21:04] that you will get paid, it's not a huge hill

[21:08] that you have to get over in order to make money.

[21:09] This next one is nasty.

[21:11] So I am a big fan of split testing, right?

[21:15] And you've probably seen it with my thumbnails on these YouTube videos.

[21:20] Because fundamentally, why would you not want to get more

[21:22] for what you put in?

[21:23] You take all this time to put together some notes,

[21:25] think about examples, make sure

[21:27] that it's easy to understand, put together a thumbnail.

[21:30] It's like, why would we not just test the thumbnail image

[21:33] when we could have two things, and one of the thumbnails

[21:35] could like three X, the views in the video.

[21:37] Like that's a high-level jacked activity.

[21:39] And so within the business that you have,

[21:41] in terms of getting more customers,

[21:43] I am all about thinking in terms of orders of magnitude.

[21:46] But when you can get 10, 20, 30% boost,

[21:50] and you can do it in three or four parts of the funnel,

[21:51] you can double your triple the amount

[21:53] that you're getting from what you're already doing.

[21:55] And when that happens, or your profit will increase

[21:57] just proportionally to your revenue.

[21:59] So if you double revenue and you keep your costs the same,

[22:01] you could very well, three or four X profit,

[22:04] because that additional revenue

[22:05] might not have nearly the cost of the first set of revenue

[22:08] that you had to incur with your fixed costs.

[22:11] I want to rank for you the most important split tests

[22:14] that I do with the business.

[22:16] The first is going to be offers.

[22:19] All right, that's the big obvious thing.

[22:21] Like, what's the thing that you're giving away

[22:22] or that you're giving them?

[22:24] The second is going to be the packaging,

[22:25] which is going to be the headlines and sub headlines.

[22:28] The third is going to be the images associated.

[22:31] All right, with that headline and that packaging.

[22:34] Now, the fourth one, and this one's really,

[22:37] the biggest split test winners I've had

[22:39] have come from one and four.

[22:40] Now, the reason for his fourth is because it's actually

[22:43] really hard to do.

[22:44] But the biggest personal gains that I've had

[22:47] have come from this, which is third party,

[22:53] integrations.

[22:54] You're like, what does that even mean?

[22:56] Well, a lot of businesses use other technology.

[22:59] You have a software stack.

[23:00] You have a CRM.

[23:03] You have a scheduler.

[23:05] You have a form thing on your site.

[23:09] Like, all of these different pieces typically exist.

[23:11] But what those third party apps and tools

[23:14] don't typically report on is what the conversion rate is

[23:17] of their UX or their user experience.

[23:20] And so I have found some unbelievable unlocks.

[23:25] Some of the biggest absolute split test winners

[23:27] have come from just saying, oh, we're not going to use

[23:29] this software to capture the stuff, we're going to use this software.

[23:32] And even though the aesthetics were basically the same

[23:35] outside of the third party integration,

[23:38] I have had this happen four times in my career

[23:42] where this test was like a company explosion in terms

[23:45] of increase in sales and profit.

[23:47] Like, really big.

[23:49] The reason most people don't do this, though,

[23:51] is that it's hard.

[23:52] So if you have to split this different tools,

[23:55] it's like, OK, well, we got some customers here.

[23:56] And this system, some customer share, it's kind of messy.

[23:59] But it's one of the most viable things you can do.

[24:01] And what's interesting to me is that in almost

[24:03] no third party provider ever reports on conversion rate

[24:07] data, because honestly, how could that?

[24:08] Because everybody's different.

[24:09] But by having that and testing it for yourself,

[24:12] you'll see some of the biggest gains that you've ever had.

[24:14] One of the cool things with all of these is that when

[24:18] you implement these things, you get permanent lifts

[24:20] for the most part.

[24:21] So meaning, if you change the offer and everything crushes,

[24:25] it's like, great, that's the offer.

[24:26] If you change the headline, you find out that's the headline.

[24:28] And it's like, cool.

[24:29] This just keeps converting for us.

[24:30] So it's one time effort for ongoing gains.

[24:34] And those are my favorite types of things

[24:35] that do in the world.

[24:36] Like, build once, sell 1,000 times.

[24:38] Like, that's a fundamentally, like, a book, same idea.

[24:41] You write a book once, it's a lot of effort once.

[24:43] But then after that, you can just keep selling

[24:44] the book over and over and over again.

[24:46] And same thing when you give away free products.

[24:48] It's like, you build it once, and then that

[24:50] can get you unlimited amounts of leads.

[24:51] Last week for Black Friday, I spent 200 plus hours, not on that day.

[24:57] But leading up to it, to come up with a scaling roadmap,

[25:00] basically taking company from 0 to 100 million.

[25:02] It's 14 hours that breaks 10 stages of growth for any company.

[25:07] And it divides it across eight different functions of the business.

[25:11] So marketing sales, customer success, product, IT, HR,

[25:15] recruiting finance.

[25:17] And so all of the functions of the business, what

[25:19] the problem that you're dealing with right now,

[25:20] and what you need to do to graduate.

[25:22] That whole thing took me a really long time to put together.

[25:26] But now that it's there, and everyone can just

[25:28] like fill out questions and get a personalized solution for them.

[25:31] And it's free, and it's better than other people charged for,

[25:34] than that can just consistently get more businesses

[25:36] into my world.

[25:37] So the next big way of getting customers so fast

[25:41] it should feel legal is spend more weight.

[25:44] That's not what it is.

[25:47] It's be able to spend more.

[25:50] So let me explain the difference.

[25:52] So spending more is just cool.

[25:53] You increase your budget.

[25:54] Sure, and that can work.

[25:56] But most businesses, like if you ask businesses why they fail.

[26:00] So they do surveys in the Census Bureau.

[26:02] And I think the number one reason that small businesses

[26:04] say that they can't succeed is because they have a lack of customers.

[26:08] They have a lack of leads.

[26:09] They have a lack of demand.

[26:11] And the reality, most of the time,

[26:13] is not that they have a lack of leads,

[26:15] but that they don't have a good enough business

[26:16] to be able to afford them.

[26:19] And so this is where you have to solve the business

[26:21] from back to front.

[26:22] And so there was a company, not that long ago,

[26:25] that came out here to the headquarters.

[26:27] And we need help scaling, and I said,

[26:30] so what do you think your country is?

[26:31] And their constraint was leads cost too much.

[26:34] By the way, leads costing too much is rarely ever an issue.

[26:39] The issue is usually that you don't make enough money

[26:42] per customer.

[26:43] And here's a fun fact to it for you that I can share.

[26:46] I look at a lot of different companies every single day.

[26:50] And that's because we sift through deals,

[26:51] and we look for patterns between markets.

[26:54] And so right now, for example,

[26:55] I'm really interested in the Met's boss base,

[26:57] and I would really like to get into a chain there.

[26:59] So if you are a Met's partner,

[27:00] and you have, you know, call it five-ish million in EBITDA,

[27:03] hit us up anyways.

[27:05] One of the things that's not unique

[27:06] between different Met's boss chains

[27:08] is their cost to acquire customers.

[27:09] So the range of the cost of getting people in the door

[27:12] is usually actually not that different.

[27:14] So the benchmarks are usually maybe one X2X of one another,

[27:18] not huge, but where the major difference is that exist

[27:21] between chains in terms of their success

[27:23] is their LTV, which is how much customers

[27:26] are worth to that business over the long term.

[27:28] And this is usually where the rich get richer.

[27:31] This is why the biggest companies in the world

[27:33] are the biggest companies in the world.

[27:35] Starbucks has a $14,000 LTV.

[27:38] Now for Starbucks to acquire a coffee customer,

[27:41] it's probably not going to cost that much more.

[27:43] If anything, they're probably wildly inefficient

[27:44] because this massive corporate behemoth, right?

[27:48] Compared to the local coffee shop down the street.

[27:50] But if they're going to head to head

[27:51] from an actual per dollar per customer basis,

[27:53] usually the small local guy could

[27:55] should be able to out-compete the big national guy,

[27:57] where the big national guy gets him,

[27:58] is that they've got 40 or 50 years

[28:00] of optimizing lifetime value per customer.

[28:02] So they know every single thing that gets customers

[28:05] to come back, will get to the middictive,

[28:07] what types of products, on what seasons,

[28:09] what pumps of flavors to give,

[28:11] what options to provide which ones to cut,

[28:13] they know all of these things.

[28:15] And that is how they outcompete.

[28:17] And so right now, if your cost to acquire customer

[28:21] is about the same as your industry,

[28:23] which by the way, you can totally just Google this.

[28:25] It's not that hard.

[28:26] You just say like average cost to acquire customer

[28:28] insert industry, right?

[28:29] And you can find it very quickly in a couple Google searches.

[28:31] That will then tell you, oh, maybe I'm not that far off.

[28:34] Oh my, business is broken.

[28:36] And so this often happens a lot too,

[28:39] where a small business owner will be like,

[28:40] if you guys overcharge,

[28:41] I'm gonna come into the market and charge less.

[28:43] It's like, well, there's a reason that they charge more

[28:45] and why they're bigger than you.

[28:47] Because they make more money, so they can charge more,

[28:48] because they've already figured this out.

[28:50] And so in my opinion, the ability to spend more

[28:54] is LTV.

[28:55] And LTV is the arms race of advertising.

[28:58] And if you can spend more than anyone else can,

[29:01] you can outlast them.

[29:03] Because here's a fact that we'll make a lot of you

[29:06] uncomfortable.

[29:07] Advertising only becomes more expensive over time.

[29:10] The cost you get a customer literally only goes up.

[29:12] The cost of impressions, the cost of eyeballs,

[29:14] only goes up over time.

[29:16] And so you need to have a force in your business

[29:19] that also concurrently goes up over time,

[29:22] which is your LTV.

[29:24] Customer should continue to pay for the services

[29:26] for me, continue to buy your products.

[29:27] And you should be continually expanding LTV,

[29:30] so that as you go to colder and colder markets,

[29:32] on more and more expensive media channels,

[29:34] that you can continue to outspend and earn a profit.

[29:38] And you might be wondering, why doesn't anyone do this?

[29:40] Well, it's usually an entirely different skill set.

[29:42] And there's usually fear associated with the actions

[29:45] that most strongly increase LTV.

[29:48] So changing or raising prices,

[29:50] something that most business owners are terrified of,

[29:52] it's one of the strongest levers on lifetime value,

[29:55] and yet no one does it.

[29:56] And so they instead are like, how can I get cheaper leads?

[29:58] Because they had this one campaign, this one time,

[30:00] that kind of worked.

[30:01] And then they're like, I wish it was like that time.

[30:03] It's kind of like their heroin addicts

[30:04] for like the first time, they're chasing the first high.

[30:06] And every marketing came made after that.

[30:09] They're trying to get lead costs to that low.

[30:10] It's never gonna happen again.

[30:12] Just get over it.

[30:12] The first time you send any kind of ad in a new market

[30:15] or you've got a new offer, it's always gonna do the best.

[30:17] That's not gonna be your stabilization point.

[30:19] It's gonna get worse.

[30:20] And so you have to build the business to accommodate that

[30:23] rather than stomp your feet and wish that leads were cheaper.

[30:27] Oh, yeah.

[30:28] I love this one.

[30:29] All right.

[30:30] So affiliate models, that work.

[30:33] All right.

[30:34] So we're talking about getting customers stupid fast.

[30:36] All right.

[30:37] One of the highest leverage things you can do

[30:39] is go to somebody who's already spent years developing

[30:42] your audience and then just ask to be promoted in front of it.

[30:45] Now, there's a number of ways of doing this.

[30:48] Of course you can go for the mega influencers

[30:49] and things like that.

[30:50] The way that I have built every affiliate business

[30:52] that I have run has been not going after the super affiliates.

[30:56] But instead trying to aggregate many smaller businesses

[31:01] or nodes of new revenue.

[31:03] So there is a business right now

[31:04] that already has all the customers that you want

[31:07] and they don't have your product

[31:08] and you would both benefit from collaborating

[31:10] rather than competing.

[31:11] And so here's the issue.

[31:14] If I were to get on stage in front of a thousand business owners

[31:17] and say, raise your hand if you have a deal

[31:21] or if someone refers to you, customer, you give them 20%.

[31:24] Half the road raise the hand.

[31:25] They'd be like, oh yeah, I do that.

[31:27] And be like, okay, everybody's raising your hands.

[31:29] Why don't you go over for a customer to one another

[31:32] and then the hands go down?

[31:34] Because no one cares.

[31:35] No one's gonna say, okay, I spent all this effort,

[31:38] all this time to build trust,

[31:40] advertise sell, create a relationship

[31:42] and I'm just gonna hand them to you

[31:43] for 20% of your ticket.

[31:45] What do I care?

[31:46] I'd rather just not even introduce the variable

[31:48] just keep living my life.

[31:50] And so if you really wanna fill it to work,

[31:52] you have to make it so good that it hurts.

[31:55] And when I say that, I mean,

[31:57] you gotta give the affiliate so much

[31:59] that you're like, man, they're gonna make a killing on this.

[32:02] And this is how I like to do it.

[32:04] So let's say that you've got a product, right?

[32:07] That has, let's see if this drawing actually work out.

[32:10] I don't know, this is why I draw it in my pen normally.

[32:13] Okay, so let's say that we've got your product

[32:18] and you've got kind of four components to it, right?

[32:21] Or I guess this is more than four.

[32:22] Is it four?

[32:23] No, it's eight, whatever, you get the idea.

[32:25] All right, and you sell this thing for whatever,

[32:29] $1,000.

[32:30] Okay, so what we wanna do is we're gonna say,

[32:33] we wanna take this corner and we're gonna peel this thing off.

[32:37] All right, so this is just gonna be a little side project

[32:39] that we have here.

[32:40] Just pretend that's cute, this is still a.

[32:43] And instead of saying, hey, man, I'll give you 20%,

[32:47] give them 20% of your product and give them 100%.

[32:52] Here what I'm saying.

[32:54] If I were a masseuse and what are all the things that I do?

[32:59] Okay, I might do sports massage,

[33:00] I might have the the oils,

[33:03] I might do the the hot stone thing, right?

[33:06] Or I might be selling, you know, 10, 10 massage packages

[33:09] or 20 massage packages, whatever.

[33:12] I would go to a business cylinder and instead of saying,

[33:15] hey, I'll give you 20% if you send me somebody

[33:18] who gets some massage, I would say, hey, man,

[33:21] why don't you sell all your customers three massageers?

[33:26] And you can sell it for whatever you want from me

[33:29] and you can keep all the money.

[33:32] Oh, wait, so this is like a, well, how much can I charge?

[33:36] Whatever you want, but it's gotta be at least this.

[33:38] So that minimum is whatever your price is

[33:40] because you don't wanna get cheap customers in.

[33:42] So let's say that your price is a is a hundred dollars.

[33:45] So you say you have to be able to sell those three

[33:48] and you can sell it for at least 300.

[33:50] You can sell for 500, you can sell for 300.

[33:52] You'll keep the whole 300.

[33:53] I just need to make sure the price is right.

[33:55] So it's the right people.

[33:56] So let's say these guys are like, oh my god,

[33:57] these guys are nuts.

[33:58] I'm gonna sell these three massage packages for $500.

[34:01] And I'm gonna keep all that.

[34:03] You know what, I would think to myself,

[34:05] what's my cost?

[34:07] So the cost of a massage, let's say that you you pay your

[34:10] your your massage may be to you, right?

[34:13] Let's say you pay $30 per massage and hard cost

[34:16] in terms of labor.

[34:17] So would I pay $90 to get somebody to do three sessions

[34:23] with me that paid $500 for those three sessions.

[34:28] Well, that sounds like an incredibly qualified lead to me.

[34:31] And not only is it $90, it's $90 and no other work.

[34:35] I'm not making ads.

[34:37] I'm not running them in buying media.

[34:39] I'm not building landing pages.

[34:40] I'm not working leads, calling them,

[34:43] sending them or I don't have any of that.

[34:44] They already paid, they're gonna show.

[34:46] And so all I have to do is just have an easy handoff

[34:49] where they can just schedule them on to my calendar

[34:51] and then they've already paid.

[34:52] So the likely they show is fine and the rest of it's automated.

[34:55] When that happens and then you make this offer,

[34:58] hey man, and you do that to 100 businesses,

[35:01] there's a lot of businesses are like, oh,

[35:03] I'm down to sell some for $500 and do no work.

[35:07] And there's something mental about,

[35:09] you don't split it with me.

[35:11] Just take all the money.

[35:12] It's very different vibe.

[35:14] And so what ends up happening is they either use it

[35:16] as an upsell or they include it in their $1,000 thing

[35:22] and they put your thing in

[35:24] and they charge the $1,000 and give them the three massages.

[35:27] You don't care.

[35:28] Either way, you have a $90 cost of getting somebody

[35:32] who spent a lot of money and is perfectly qualified

[35:35] for whatever your next thing is.

[35:37] And so then you just do the math and say,

[35:39] okay, well, I know that I convert one out of three

[35:41] these people, one of three, into my $2,000 thing.

[35:47] Which means that my cost to get a customer here

[35:49] would be three times 90, which is $270.

[35:53] So what I pay $270 to get $2,000, hell yeah, I would.

[35:59] And without any of the work, of course,

[36:02] and this is how you build an affiliate model

[36:04] that gets you customers stupid fast

[36:07] and gets you affiliates who are trying to fill up your calendars

[36:10] because it actually makes sense for them now.

[36:12] So if you're gonna have affiliates, do it like you mean it.

[36:15] It has to be incentivizing enough

[36:17] to change their behavior or it's useless.

[36:20] It's kind of like these coupon codes that I see people

[36:23] give out to like influencers.

[36:25] It's like 10% off.

[36:26] It's like who cares?

[36:29] Like either I'm gonna buy the jacket or I'm not.

[36:31] 10% is probably not gonna move the needle for me at all.

[36:33] Now, for me, discounts have to be 50% or higher

[36:36] for in my opinion, for a real change in behavior.

[36:39] We get a massive increase into man.

[36:41] And so I don't wanna take that off my main thing,

[36:44] I wanna peel my main thing

[36:46] and then give 100% of that.

[36:48] And so this next one is truth.

[36:50] And you're like, what does that even mean?

[36:51] How's this gonna get me customer really fast?

[36:54] Well, well, lies will certainly get your customers

[36:56] pretty quickly, but it also ruin your reputation.

[36:59] So you want truth to be your greatest ally,

[37:02] not your greatest liability.

[37:04] Because I will tell you a secret about advertising.

[37:07] Nothing sells like the truth.

[37:09] And so one, people talk about being authentic.

[37:13] Well, if you want your advertising to be authentic,

[37:15] just say what's true.

[37:17] And what's interesting is that a lot of people

[37:19] will tell the truth about the things

[37:21] that actually could help them.

[37:23] So like if you're a small business

[37:24] and you're getting started, say so.

[37:26] If you don't have a huge amount of capacity

[37:31] because you're small, say so.

[37:33] Not having a lot of capacity increases scarcity.

[37:35] It means that there's fewer spots available.

[37:37] Not having a lot of capacity indicates

[37:39] that there's probably a high level of personalization

[37:41] and personal touch.

[37:42] Being a small business for many people is a pro.

[37:45] There aren't as many people were like,

[37:46] buy big corporate, buy big corporate.

[37:48] No, people were like buy local, buy small business, right?

[37:50] This is a poor small business.

[37:51] And so like a lot of what people think our negatives

[37:55] are actually things that make their offer

[37:58] or their business more compelling,

[37:59] especially to the right audience.

[38:02] And so you want to arm yourself with truth

[38:06] and think about how many different things are true.

[38:08] And if you want to get really nasty with it,

[38:11] you want to tell the truth that also is an as exciting

[38:15] upfront so that when you sell your second piece of truth,

[38:19] they will then you believe you that much more.

[38:20] So I'll give you an example.

[38:22] So I remember we had a location that had bad parking.

[38:27] And so we would say stuff like, listen,

[38:30] we have, we don't have the biggest parking lot

[38:33] or we're not the biggest gym in the neighborhood.

[38:35] We don't have more equipment than the guys down the street.

[38:37] But you know what, when you walk in this door,

[38:39] you're going to forget about all of that

[38:41] because you're going to have so much fun,

[38:43] you're not even going to care.

[38:45] Because this is a damage you can mission.

[38:47] It's X bad thing.

[38:50] You're also the equation for this.

[38:53] I'll show you the formula for this.

[38:54] So it's bad, bad, bad, bad.

[39:01] But good.

[39:05] So, but is an amplifier for this word?

[39:09] So if I said, I have an incredibly short temper,

[39:13] I am impatient and I don't shower very much.

[39:19] But I will be able to, now you want this to be relevant

[39:23] to the damage you can missions.

[39:24] So, but I will make your lap,

[39:28] but I will make you laugh your ass off all night

[39:31] for the price of a couple beers.

[39:34] If you say that, those negatives then are diminished

[39:40] and the good thing is amplified.

[39:42] And so, if you know that you're going to tell the truth

[39:45] and that people are going to find out about this anyways,

[39:48] you might as well be the one who controls the narrative

[39:50] and you can frame it in a way that that bad truth

[39:54] helps amplify your good truth.

[39:57] I obviously come from the fitness space

[39:59] and to the examples that I think of are there,

[40:02] which is sometimes, you know, like one of the gym owners

[40:05] who are not like super in shape.

[40:06] They'd be like, hey, I'm not the most in shape guy,

[40:09] but we have more fun at our gym

[40:11] and people get great results, even though I like donuts

[40:14] a lot still.

[40:15] And so, what happens is people are like, man,

[40:17] this guy's so authentic.

[40:18] And if you don't say it, they're going to think it.

[40:22] See, you might as well account for it up front.

[40:25] Answer the why should I listen to you

[40:26] or what about this big flaring problem

[40:29] that I can obviously see?

[40:31] You want to control the narrative

[40:32] and make that thing into a weapon for you,

[40:34] make it into an asset that serves your purpose

[40:37] rather than something that casts doubt in the prospect.

[40:39] Because if you claim it, they, they like,

[40:43] I don't know why this works this way,

[40:44] but it's kind of like Eminem when he said all the negative things

[40:47] in eight miles that anyone else could say about him

[40:49] so no one else could say anything bad.

[40:51] It's like if you claim them

[40:52] that people can't hold it against you

[40:53] and the hardest thing in all of marketing

[40:56] is getting someone to believe you.

[40:58] And so, everything that you can do

[41:00] to increase trust is one of the best investments

[41:03] you can make in an advertising campaign in general

[41:05] and ultimately in building a brand.

[41:07] The truth isn't just a good strategy,

[41:09] it's the only long-term strategy.

[41:12] And it just takes people a different amount of time

[41:14] to realize it.

[41:16] And once you've activated affiliates,

[41:17] once you've given away crazy amounts of stuff for free,

[41:20] once you've doubled down on the right people

[41:22] who are high leverage in the position,

[41:23] once you've made the truth, your ally,

[41:26] and you put your negatives out in the marketing,

[41:28] so that people believe the good stuff that you say.

[41:30] And you focused on doing more and doing better.

[41:33] You're gonna start getting more customers

[41:35] than you can handle.

[41:35] And at that point, you're gonna want to have a playbook

[41:38] for making so much money that it should feel illegal.

[41:41] And if that's you, watch the next video.

[00:00] In this video, I'm going to show you how to raise your prices.

[00:02] It's one of the best ways you can increase profitability of your business,

[00:05] and also make more money and give you more spending power, pay people better,

[00:08] provide better experience, all of the many benefits it go with raising your prices.

[00:11] But one of the fears of raising your prices is what I don't sell,

[00:14] anyone with my sales team does have conviction.

[00:16] What if my market will bear that price?

[00:18] 99 times out of 100, it's purely in your head and in your sales team's head.

[00:23] But having now raised my prices in a number of different businesses,

[00:26] a number of different industries across different sales teams,

[00:28] I'm a process that has worked very, very well for me,

[00:31] and I'd like to share it with you.

[00:32] Okay, so what I've written here on the board here,

[00:34] different prices that I might be increasing going from 1,000 to 2,000 to 3,000,

[00:39] 3,000 to 4,000 to 4,000 to 5,

[00:40] 6 to 8, 10 to 12, these are common price increases that happen.

[00:44] And what I want to do is kind of walk you through the strategy

[00:47] in a real way so that you can see what this equates to in a real business.

[00:51] Okay, so if we're going, right, I'm trying to increase from, let's say,

[00:56] 2K to 3K. The way that I do it is I actually bump my top price up by an additional

[01:03] percent. All right, and so I actually make the new price $4,000,

[01:08] which is the price acre. This is what the sales people are going to say on the phone.

[01:11] Right, and here's what's cool. It's that I say,

[01:14] cool, you can pay this $4,000 in 2K, you know, and 2K, right, you can make that,

[01:20] that pay with that way. And the reason we do that is because 2K is their,

[01:23] their emotional anchor. They're used to getting $2,000. And so I'm going to say,

[01:27] cool, you still have that in your back pocket. You're totally fine. It's safe. It's going to be okay.

[01:31] Right, so we're going to say it's $4,000, which they can either pay 2K to you get or they can get

[01:36] some same day savings in pay 3K today. All right, and so by doing this, it allows them

[01:41] emotionally to have home base where they feel comfortable and safe asking for $2,000.

[01:46] Right, it's a cool in the extra payment you can make in 30 days. Or if you want, you can just

[01:49] prepay it and pay 3K. So it actually gives the salespeople a discount to get the price that is now

[01:55] higher for us. All right, so let's walk through another one because I think this is a,

[01:58] this is something that's good to walk through together. So let's do this 4K one. So your $4,000,

[02:03] you want to bump to $5,000. All right, well, again, we're going to bump over, do, do, do, do, do,

[02:06] we're going to skip over that 5K and we're going to jump straight to 6K. This is going to be our

[02:11] new price anchor and we're going to say, cool, what I want to do is you can either pay 4K today

[02:16] and then 2K in 30 days. Now notice that this is a disproportionate slip. I prefer to do

[02:21] uneven splits personally because I want to still keep more cash upfront. Right, and the reason

[02:26] it's also is cool. Now check this out, right. Remember, this person where we said 2K

[02:30] will look like we'll shoot. I can either pay 2K now in 2K and a month or so, or just an extra

[02:34] thousand to get to the 3000. See how much each of this has to sell. Same thing happens here.

[02:39] Right, you're at $6,000. You say, cool, 4K. Remember, this is home base. This is what our sales

[02:44] teams used to selling. So they have conviction around this number. They're comfortable saying

[02:47] this number. They don't get tongue died around saying this number. Right. It's like, or, so you can

[02:51] pay 4K today and then 2K in 30 days, or, you can just pay an extra 1000 and get it all taken care

[02:57] of today. Right. And so all of a sudden, you're downselling this upsell. You're downselling and

[03:01] make it a discount compared to a price anchor which we introduced on the call. So it actually makes

[03:05] it easier for your sales team to sell. Now this process that I just outlined is exactly how

[03:10] I raised prices because I've tried to, you know, I've tried to just say, okay, guys, you just

[03:14] got to deal with it. It's just in your heads. But, you know, as time is well run on and like I've

[03:18] become more weathered in this, it's good to have a process. And so a couple of the takeaways that

[03:23] I want you to see from this is one is that they're going to have an emotional comfort selling

[03:27] around a certain price. You have to accept that. Right. And there's a reason that you're the entrepreneur

[03:30] because you tend to be a little bit more adaptable, a little bit more flexible, a little bit more growth

[03:33] rates and that's okay. Right. But you have to meet people where they're at. And so if this is what they're

[03:37] comfortable, then we still need to give that to them. So they still have that and that's so they're

[03:40] going to always ask for a front. Right. And then the second thing that I want you to take from

[03:44] this. So first is that you give them there. So I'll write numbers on this. Right. First is that you

[03:49] give them their home based. Number one. All right. Number two is that the price that we are going to

[03:54] be anchoring is not the price that we're actually trying to get to. So if we want to get to

[03:58] 3,000 from 2,000, we're actually talking about a $4,000 price point which anchors high and then

[04:04] when we introduced number three, which is the prepayment discount, that is actually the number that

[04:09] we're looking for. All right. The fourth tidbit that I want you to take from this is noticing

[04:13] the discrepancy between what they can pay today. First of all, they're going to pay over time. All

[04:16] right. I prefer to have an uneven split because I am going to have more cost of onboarding. I prefer

[04:21] to make more cash flow upfront. And the beautiful benefit of just the tiny incremental increase from

[04:27] that one payment from 4, a 4K 2K split compared to just I just pay 5K to the day of the down

[04:31] of that. Crazy, very compelling offer. All right. Now, if I were to jump from let's say 10K to 12K,

[04:37] this is going to be a really, really minor difference. Right. I could do a couple of different ways.

[04:42] I could say, you know, me three times 4K, right. Or what I would probably prefer is something like

[04:49] 6 plus 3 plus 3. Right. So I get a little bit more upfront for the payment and then more of

[04:55] time. Now notice, if I do 6th Bill Super 3, then it's going to automatically encourage people far more

[05:01] to take this upfront prepayment discount. Right. So for only an extra one more thousand,

[05:06] then when I would make on my second payment, I don't have to make any more payments. Right. And so

[05:09] you're noticing the four points that are that are going to be consistently used here. Right.

[05:13] Is that one, we're going to try and give them home base as much as we can. Right. Number two,

[05:19] we're going to jump over the number that we're planning on trying to price it at so that we have

[05:23] a higher price anchor so that we can downs all the prepayment discount, which is number three.

[05:28] And noticing that the comfort price compared to the prepayment discount should only be marginal.

[05:33] Right. And the reason we do that is because they're like, oh man, it's just a little bit extra.

[05:36] And I can pay that now. But what we accomplished through doing this and like that 4K that uneven split

[05:41] is that now we've successfully raised the price. We've gotten more people to prepay because of the

[05:46] way that we structure the pricing. And we've done it in such a way that sales team can feel confident

[05:51] and convicted about it so they can suck consistently without any issues. And I'll give you one more

[05:54] prototype before we go. So if you're ever going to raise your prices, always, always, always,

[06:00] clear the pipe. All right. So clear the pipeline. So announce it. Always own your pricing

[06:06] creases. It's one of the easiest ways to create true scarcity and urgency. All right. So if your team

[06:11] knows that this is going to happen, then it gives them urgency to close more deals faster and clear

[06:15] out the pipeline. So give them a heads up. So hey, we're going to increase in the price next month.

[06:18] Hey, we're going to increase in the price in the next two weeks. So it gives people this motivation

[06:23] to take action and not sit on the sidelines. It allows your team to squeeze their pipeline to get

[06:28] some extra cash. Now here's another side benefit of when you clear the pipeline. When you do this,

[06:32] it also gets around, you know, some of those future people are like, I heard a different price,

[06:35] et cetera. Well, it's like, well, we already gave you heads up about it. We told you we're going to

[06:38] we're adding more, we're adding more features, more benefits, blah blah blah to the thing. We have

[06:43] more successes, we're making easier and faster for you. And so as a result, the price is going to

[06:47] reflect that. So get in now, right. And then you as the business owner get a nice boost of cash flow

[06:52] before you make the change so that you can weather maybe a dipping cash flow during the adjustment period

[06:56] which sometimes happens. It's just natural. It's part of the business. All right. So this is how you

[07:00] raise prices in a tactical format. This is how I have learned to do it. It has worked very well for me.

[07:05] I hope it works well for you. The point in this channel is there's a lot of people who are

[07:09] broke and I make these videos so that you are not one of them. Keep being awesome. Hit this

[00:00] How to sell the same thing for more money by making offer so good people feel stupid saying now the agenda number one

[00:06] Why nailing your offer will make you more money than anything else?

[00:10] Number two

[00:13] Why selling to the right people makes you more money?

[00:16] More than almost anything else, too

[00:19] Number three why should charge lots of money for the stuff you sell?

[00:22] Number four how to reverse engineer value and number five

[00:26] I've a pretty sweet demonstration. I'll do for you guys how do you scare see birds and carrots used to make people want even more

[00:32] And charge more more more double more more money good all right

[00:36] So let's start here

[00:38] Well, I nailing your offer will make you more money than anything else

[00:40] So this is my

[00:42] My big a home moment. So this is me when I was 23

[00:47] Just sign my lease super excited

[00:49] I'm so glad they do now, but it's all good

[00:52] And

[00:54] Had no idea what I was doing. I'd never sold anything I'd never marketed never gotten leads. I had no

[01:00] No clue what I was doing and so I spent $3,000 of money that I didn't have only a $10,000

[01:05] The time so it's been a third of my net worth on a workshop

[01:08] That's supposed to be a two-day workshop that was going to teach me how to get leads and it was this brand new thing

[01:13] It was on the internet. It was called Facebook ads. It was 2013. I was super early

[01:17] This is where locked place plays a role. So into this workshop and I was there

[01:22] I didn't have a real business yet because I wasn't open and

[01:26] The guy pulls me aside and he could see that I had no fucking clue what I was doing

[01:30] I was like trying to take notes, but didn't even have context to take notes with and

[01:35] He's like hey, you know the secret to sales. That's my

[01:40] faint Australian accent

[01:43] He said

[01:45] He said

[01:46] Make people want offer so good. They feel stupid saying no and

[01:49] That was actually the first thing that anyone ever told me about selling

[01:54] And so it changed my life and so I tried to tell as many people as I can

[01:58] Because if you get that part right

[02:01] Everything else is easy and

[02:03] I was very fortunate in that I had somebody very early on who told me that and so I tried to tell to as many people as I can as

[02:08] I was like, I just can't it don't fucking book about it

[02:10] And so I realized in that moment that it any of you good at sales get a marketing really good at anything

[02:16] Because I wasn't at the time I just had to make my offer good enough and that was one the greatest game of my life again

[02:21] And so for those of you don't know in offers what you literally give someone an exchange for money

[02:26] All right, there's the product. That's the stuff

[02:29] The market is the peoples and the offers they think that bridges those two, right?

[02:34] And so it packages and communicates what you do in exchange for the dollars a shitty offer weekly connects to the market

[02:41] Very little flow very shitty

[02:44] Or for some of you if you haven't made sales yet that might be your problem as well

[02:49] So here's the you know if it's shitty offer number one, it's hard to get leads number two

[02:53] Let's people don't want to buy number three if they do want to buy they compare your prices to someone else

[02:57] No, what up and here's why what many people do is they try and just

[03:03] What many people do is they try and create another

[03:06] Another

[03:08] And also ran right and what ends of happening is that the prospect

[03:12] Makes a price driven decision rather than a value driven decision and so they think to themselves

[03:17] These two things are the same I will therefore take the lower price right and so we have to fight very hard

[03:23] Very intelligently on how to break that that cycle all right and so this is what it looks like

[03:28] When it's wrong these two are close enough. I think I'll get the cheaper one very sad for all of us

[03:35] A strong offer connects to the big part of the market so they make more monies

[03:39] So here if you make and I'm gonna show you cool demonstration at the end of this but if you can make an offer the entire

[03:47] Nitch that you're going after it's like I fucking need this

[03:52] Then you're gonna have a lot easier time getting leads a lot of your time selling a lot of times is doing more work

[03:56] Then your competitors are willing to do

[03:59] And

[04:00] That is what's going to shift people to a value driven decision which is I really want this thing gosh, it's expensive

[04:05] But I don't think anyone else could do it

[04:08] That's where you want to be because then you can make up your prices

[04:12] Great place to be it and the reason it's so important for making money is that when you get this right

[04:17] Number one you increase response rates on all of your advertisements and whatever way you advertise

[04:21] And when I say advertise I mean to make things known number two

[04:26] Increased conversions of things sales so more people that you talk to will say yes to you if the offer is right

[04:31] Number three

[04:33] Premium pricing which means not only we have more people respond to your ads and more people say yes, but they'll say yes at higher prices and when you have more more

[04:41] You make more more more money

[04:44] So

[04:45] Right now my current return my advertising my career is 36 to one. That's not a typo our portfolio is a whole generates over $200 million a year and a big part of that is nailing the offer

[04:55] And so nailing the offer is the single strongest lever on your business success

[05:00] So let me just show you how much so this was a traditional agency offer that we worked on ages ago

[05:06] But we just changed one thing about the business model just the offer

[05:10] We didn't change any of the mechanics in the business what they actually did nothing we just changed the offer

[05:16] So what they used to do is they were generic Facebook ads agency who here knows what I'm talking about with that anybody

[05:22] Yes, okay

[05:23] You know these ones everybody has one your mom has one your mom's basement has a kid in it. It also does it too

[05:30] Right

[05:31] Thousand down thousand a month I'll run your ads for you right

[05:36] There you up we were to make Facebook ads you get leads maybe maybe you don't you pay us just the same pretty generic pretty shitty offer

[05:44] And so this is what their actual return on advertising was for their advertising spent so there's been in 10,000 dollars a month

[05:50] They reached 300,000 people were sponsored right between impressions to people who click

[05:56] They got 40 book calls from that short of 75% appointments who showed a 30 closing with 16% close five price points

[06:03] 1000 so they spent 10 the mid five so they're making 0.5 to one kind of shitty

[06:08] But 30 days later they're at one to one and then so forth right it's pretty normal and this is actually pretty common a lot of businesses

[06:15] Some of you guys may have numbers like this right now

[06:18] So let me show you new way

[06:20] So this is the offer that we changed it to so rather than a thousand down a thousand month

[06:24] We said it's 4k down one time set up no monthly fee and only pay me when people show up

[06:32] We're on the ads for you and we had an implied guarantee because if no one shut up

[06:36] You wouldn't have to pay us ever again. Obviously we're invested in getting paid again

[06:40] We prefer to get paid and so we all try and get as many people to show up as you really possible

[06:44] cool

[06:45] simple

[06:46] So same initial stuff spend 10 thousand dollars same number of impressions during thousand

[06:51] but

[06:53] 2.5 times the response rate that's more number one

[06:58] Say now because of that response rate the actual percentage say the same now

[07:01] We got a hundred though a point to book rather than 40 and our show here remain the same

[07:05] So now we have 75 appointments versus 30 we would already call this a win would you not?

[07:10] There's to be a win in your business 2.5x

[07:12] Cool, but then we got more more because we closed

[07:17] 2.3 times more people who got on the phone

[07:20] Then we were before but we already had 2.5 times more people. Ah more more second more

[07:26] So we went from five sales

[07:29] for ten thousand dollars to 28 sales for ten thousand dollars more money good

[07:34] And the price point up front went from one thousand dollars to four thousand dollars

[07:39] So we have two and a half times the response rate 2.3x the close rate at four times the price

[07:47] Which resulted in a hundred and twelve thousand dollars in cash collected up front from that ten thousand dollars

[07:52] Which is 11.2 to one which from a comparison standpoint was 22 times as effective

[08:01] Just the offer didn't change anything else and so I say this to demonstrate one thing

[08:06] Which is that right now most of you could dramatically improve your offer and make a fuckload more money

[08:11] Cool, fantastic

[08:13] So if you went from whatever you convinced your stuff you're okay with to ten times better row as would that be interesting to you

[08:19] Fantastic all right, so this is what you will get from this presentation

[08:22] This is the stuff you will learn if you actually do something as a result

[08:25] Number one more leads for the same price two more sales for the same call volume three more money for the same stuff

[08:32] So natural question is how so I'll spend the rest of this preso doing my best damn dist to explain it all right

[08:38] So number one number two why selling to the right people makes you more money

[08:43] So you want to see you want to sell to people who are valuable because of who they are

[08:49] Rather than who you are all right, so leave you a little example

[08:52] So who here is familiar with conversion or optimization CRR anyone heard that term?

[08:56] It's basically people who look at your website and say we'll change a bunch of due dads and the more people are gonna click more people not done

[09:02] Okay, very simple in the e-commerce world

[09:05] It's more common than in the coaching world

[09:08] 90 y when I say curchamming services, et cetera

[09:12] No, you're wide as that way, but it is all right now. So let's say you own that and you work

[09:17] On an e-commerce business is doing a million dollars here and you have a 10% increase in throughput

[09:21] Which is very common, it's actually on the low end for most of your agencies

[09:24] So you increase that business by a hundred thousand dollars a year that's value right and you charge

[09:30] 36 thousand dollars a year to do that all right

[09:33] Cool, you got a 36% of the value that you added neat

[09:38] Now let's say that you did the same exact work

[09:40] On a business is doing a hundred million dollars a year and you commerce get the same 10% increase

[09:45] You make them ten million dollars more

[09:48] Now you can charge the same percentage of the increase and you make

[09:53] 33.6 million dollars for that one job

[09:56] same work 100 times the pay who would like it 100 times pay increase?

[10:01] Yes, me too. I'm with you all right and so the big point here is that

[10:09] a lot of people think even the

[10:11] Offer itself has to be amazing which it does

[10:14] But the next piece of this is to make sure that we're presenting to the right people

[10:18] So the same work occurred in both of those scenarios

[10:21] But because this person inherently was more valuable

[10:24] We get paid more because we created more value for them for the same work

[10:29] That is leverage by the way the definition of leverages you get more for what you put in high leverage

[10:34] Put a little in get a lot out low leverage, but a lot in get a little out this is a higher leverage play

[10:39] Having a better offer is higher leverage you do the same work

[10:42] We get more responses you get more sales higher prices making sense cool

[10:46] So this is a story that I like a lot to drive this point home

[10:49] So dad buys this kid a car. It's a clunker looks like this can imagine it right and

[10:56] The kids like I don't know if I want the car is like well you can scrap it take the cash and you can put it towards whatever part

[11:01] You want it's okay

[11:02] It's like we'll where should I go? He's like well

[11:05] Once you go to the go to the deal shit see what they'll give me goes to the dealership

[11:10] Says hey, you know we'll give you will give you five grand for the car

[11:14] He's like okay, so it goes back to his dad. He's like hey, they said they'll give me five panties like okay

[11:17] Well, she goes to the punch up down the street the scrap your it's you will give you maybe the metals worth more

[11:22] Just go to scrap your has same conversation with sell the car

[11:25] They said we'll give you 500 bucks

[11:28] 500 bucks goes back to his dad solks and he's like the only gonna be $500 for the car

[11:34] So I go okay, he said won't you go to that that collector thing down the street

[11:38] You're doing with this guy goes to the collector thing down the street. So I gave him something about some of my car

[11:43] And they're like dude you have a historic blah, blah, blah, blah

[11:48] This is a hundred thousand dollar car. There's only 20 of these left

[11:52] Comes back to his dad is dad's smile. He knows what happened and the less than you wanted to see his son

[11:57] Is if you're not being

[12:05] Hello

[12:06] It's not a more dramatic that way if you're not being valued it's because of the people that are placing the value on you

[12:12] And so a lot of times I've like we do with this with a lot like I get a customer segmentation

[12:16] It's beyond the scope of this this

[12:19] Presentation but if you look at all the customers you have there are customers that pay you five ten times more than your other customers

[12:26] If you just had those

[12:28] Right, it's a lot easier to make that person more value because of who they are not even because of who you are

[12:34] Right, and so the person on the other side of the table matters just as much as thing your tone of sometimes more

[12:41] There the value to arrive is often about who you find not necessarily what you provide

[12:45] And so this is a final little one on dry the sum with so there was a guy who's broke down on the side of the street

[12:52] Super upset big red car there lots of you don't know I have two car examples but go with it

[12:57] And

[12:59] Guy's driving by stops on the side of the road. It starts pushing as anyone's seen this before in their lives

[13:05] Okay, what's interesting is that this guy who decided to be the good somerra in for the day

[13:09] Help the other guy out nothing crazy normal thing when he got back home he found out

[13:15] That the man on the side of the road was a billionaire and

[13:18] He had paid off is mortgage. I think he's really good. It's a real story and so

[13:24] It wasn't a function of what he did

[13:26] It was a function of who he helped

[13:29] So most people could push a car and probably not get anything besides a thank you

[13:32] Which is fine, and that's cool because they didn't do it for that

[13:36] But in this particular instance, he guys entire house paid off because of who he chose to serve and so right now

[13:41] You probably opinion the ass clients who fucking suck and you got a couple of them are pretty cool

[13:46] Get more of them

[13:47] And one of the hardest things in business is being able to say no, but I promise you that if you're able to say no to people who suck

[13:53] You'll make room for people who don't suck and those people will pay you a lot more money

[13:59] Thank you

[14:01] Facts

[14:03] So

[14:05] Who do I decide to go after?

[14:07] If this is what I'm gonna decide to do awesome. I'll give you a little framework for this

[14:11] So when we look at markets that we want to go after and this is at a market level

[14:14] You can actually drill a close to this in terms of customer self-huntation

[14:17] There's four characteristics we look for number one is pain number two is personaging power

[14:22] So do they have the problem to solve?

[14:24] Do they got the money to spend can we find them easily and are they gonna be bigger to Mara than they are today?

[14:29] Right because you can reverse this and say how do I find somebody who doesn't give a shit can't afford the thing?

[14:34] I can't find them is actually shrinking right?

[14:37] So let's not do that. Let's do the opposite of that all right so

[14:41] Anyone heard this

[14:43] Might have heard this example so if you have a hot dog stand right and you're trying to sell the most hot dogs

[14:48] So this is gonna be a we're gonna do this live today

[14:51] If you can just shout them out as loud as you can because you have no mic and I do

[14:56] If you wanted to sell the most hot dogs and we're in a contest and I saw give a 100 grand of the person who sells the most hot dogs

[15:02] Will be the one advantage that you would want

[15:06] Well fuckers remind about

[15:08] So

[15:10] Normally I would go through this they'd be like the best hot dogs the best packaging the best

[15:15] Whatever right the best marketing

[15:18] The answer is you want to be right outside the stadium when the drunk crowd gets out you want to start a crowd

[15:22] You can sell bullshit inside of a bun as long as even resembles a hot dog and you will sell out

[15:27] And so the idea here is that we want to find the starving crowd and the thing is is that within markets

[15:32] There are sub-segments that are starving and they're wildly underserved and they have lots of money

[15:37] And just no one has done a good job by presenting the right offer to them

[15:43] Number two purchasing power

[15:46] So a friend of mine actually read this book

[15:49] And like was going through this process and

[15:52] He was like I think I've got my perfect audience

[15:54] It's unemployed people. I help them with the resumes to get jobs. This is a huge marketplace. It's growing right

[16:02] Um

[16:04] It's a fun with me after like a month of this like crazy great idea

[16:07] You're like you wouldn't believe it. I was like tell me it's like they can afford a $300

[16:13] consultation

[16:14] It's like I I can't believe it

[16:18] And I was like what's the main reason they're giving you say they're saying they don't have any income right now. I was like wild thought

[16:26] And so when you're selling something you want to make sure that the person you have is person power

[16:30] I will tell you something that I anecdotally found is that the more I really I reveal about how expensive something is earlier on the process

[16:36] The more money out to make a lot of people like to hide that and then try like you know

[16:40] I'm fused. You know trying to like pull that back and not tell people I don't want to scare people off

[16:47] People usually have an idea of a range of what something is and if someone is like so shock value that they won't get on the phone

[16:52] They're probably not gonna close so I have been I've made more money. It has cost me more money per call

[16:58] But I've made higher return on my advertising by having that stuff

[17:03] But most people are afraid of that because they only look at the front end metrics rather than the back end metrics

[17:08] So number three is want to find find people are easy right and so

[17:12] If they're not aggregated somewhere it becomes very difficult to advertise to them right we can't make our shit known to them if we can't find them

[17:18] right if you're trying to reach rich doctors it's much easier to do that then

[17:24] I don't know something that some of you guys are going after

[17:27] Like you got to be able to find this this is really tactical, but like this is why I love niches when you have like associations and Facebook groups and

[17:34] Professional services around this particular audience

[17:37] becomes very easy to target them and not only that because easy to target them across all platforms and it becomes easy to do

[17:42] I'm about to them because you can find those lists like there's so many different ways to advertise them

[17:45] They get easy rather than thinking of

[17:48] Creative innovative ways to do it

[17:50] Again, there are other ways but why not make it easier?

[17:55] Like if we're gonna do it when I was just pick the the the the deck staffs in our favor

[18:00] Right and so the last one is one that I learned from Uncle Warren right which is

[18:06] He tells the story that that has always stuck with me

[18:09] Said when I was a Columbia business school

[18:11] He and it he had as closest friend at Columbia

[18:14] And they were kind of like pavilion in every way super smart really hard working at cetera

[18:18] And when they graduated they went their separate ways he went to

[18:22] Get into you know private equity investing et cetera and it's friend went into the steel business and

[18:27] Worked really hard et cetera et cetera fast for 30 years his friend did

[18:33] Decently well you know rose up in the company steals a hard business. They can't pay as well et cetera

[18:37] This was an American steel was kind of in turmoil et cetera and

[18:42] Two guys

[18:44] same like you

[18:45] Is same

[18:46] same work ethic

[18:48] Warren becomes an ultra billionaire the other guy he's just

[18:52] A normal dude and he said that's when I learned how important it was that it wasn't about

[18:57] How hard you row but the boat you're in

[19:00] And so a lot of us are are rowing in the wrong boat we're rowing as hard as we can

[19:05] But we're actually in the wrong vehicle and so

[19:08] When we're when we're trying to pick the market that we're going after you don't want to pick steel in the

[19:13] US when he was graduating from college

[19:16] Good friend of mine had a newspaper business

[19:19] He was a sastude from YC

[19:21] slick back hair the whole thing looks fancy and

[19:25] He was like dude

[19:26] We're not growing anymore. He's like I've changed the the offer. I've got the you know I've got my sales team

[19:31] He's doing all this stuff

[19:33] I was like bro

[19:34] Do you want me to say it and he's like what do you mean?

[19:37] I was like newspaper string and 25% a year

[19:40] Compounded against you not even like neutral like negative compounding people

[19:45] Like 25% a year returns like do that for 10 years the other way very bad

[19:50] And so he's like even though we're gaining market share

[19:52] I was like yeah, but the market's this big right and so the thing is there's an old VC saying

[19:57] Venture gapless thing

[19:58] You said when a great manager means a bad market the market wins

[20:02] Right and so a lot of us are trying we're we're rowing in the wrong boat you're pursuing people who suck

[20:08] If you go to places you go to markets that are growing

[20:11] You grow by default. There are some people. This is the nice thing that we have is that we all just went through COVID

[20:15] Whatever time ago it was

[20:17] Who here saw a big increase in their business?

[20:21] Who here saw a big decrease in their business?

[20:23] Well good for you guys for everybody else

[20:27] The point is is that you actually got to see in real time the difference between markets

[20:32] Like the market was actually behind you and it got so much easier and so if we have the

[20:38] Ability to decide what we're gonna sell into whom we might as well stack the deck right

[20:44] So number one why nailing your offer is the most important thing that you can do to make more money number two

[20:49] Why suddenly the right people makes more money then I make that point?

[20:51] Cool all right number three here's why it's charged a lot of money for it. AK the right price

[20:56] One of my favorite customer day in Kennedy charges much as you came without cracking a smile

[21:03] And so there's three little frameworks I'm gonna give you as quickly as I can because I want to get to some of the

[21:06] Cool other stuff

[21:09] There's price the value discrepancy so price what you pay values which you get this is also a warm buff a quote

[21:15] You can imagine the top line is the value the middle line is the price and when your value declines the point where

[21:22] The price sorry the value dives below the price is where people cancel if you ever are carrying revenue business or people don't buy

[21:27] Right and so

[21:30] Every single person wants a bargain

[21:32] This is an important point you could sell something for a hundred million dollars and it could be a bargain

[21:37] So price is nothing to do the discrepancy between price and value. There's both variables

[21:42] Right and the problem is most business owners focus on the wrong side and so there's two ways you can increase that discrepancy

[21:49] Number one the hard way is it you can lower your prices right if you lower your prices you increase the discrepancy make sense

[21:57] Right

[21:58] It also sucks because it's a great way to compete on prices commodity remember the apples and oranges

[22:03] We're doing the apples to apples shitty life

[22:06] Right and what happens is you end up losing most of your money

[22:09] All right this nice of visual didn't come up. Okay. It's all good

[22:13] The other way to do this is the easy way right is that you can compete on value and create a value

[22:18] Driven decision rather than a price driven decision and so this is where we start stacking is many things as we can on this rubber band

[22:25] A value to keep driving in his highs. We fucking can imagine

[22:29] So that the price just follows as resolve and so we want to charge

[22:34] 10 times more than we are now for something a hundred times as valuable

[22:38] I showed you an example if I we could do a hundred times more value just by serving a better customer

[22:42] But does that make sense

[22:45] This is how you make tons of money

[22:47] Is by jacking the shit out of the value so much to the people are like this is not the same as everything else

[22:53] I have nothing to compare this to I have to take whatever number they give me is the only data point

[22:57] I have to compare to a day Kennedy said you want to sell in a vacuum

[23:02] No one else is in the room. You're like it's just you and me baby

[23:05] I'm all you got

[23:07] And so that's what we want to do in our sales conversations where they have no alternative

[23:11] There's nothing else that they can do or know where else to go or no one else who can solve this problem

[23:16] All right, and remember this is one that's always useful to remind people up

[23:20] You can only go down to zero

[23:22] Like you can only go so love on the price but you can go infinitely high in the other direction on value

[23:29] So I would want to time myself to the thing that I can infinitely go up on rather than the one that I can only compress to zero

[23:36] So the goals that they buy a tremendous amount of value at a discount

[23:40] We still want them to get a deal but we do it by pushing the other side

[23:46] The nice thing that happens when you do this and this is what most people do when they're picking their price

[23:50] So who here has picked a price for something they're selling recently and I can hand

[23:54] Thank you by the way means the world to me that when you raise your hands when I do that because it gives me feedback

[23:58] Okay, so

[24:00] This is what most people do they look at the marketplace they look at everyone else is doing

[24:04] Number two

[24:05] They see what everyone else offers in terms of what they're actually providing number three

[24:10] They take the average number four they go slightly below to remain competitive of course

[24:15] And then they provide with their competitor offers

[24:18] a little bit more for a little bit less right great value

[24:24] What's interesting about that is that they're looking competitors and the funny thing is everyone's broke

[24:31] You might know this motion better is broke

[24:34] I see a ton of penal statements every single day they come in track with their not calm so many businesses broke as fuck

[24:43] Don't look at that they don't know what they're doing why would you take the average of the mediocre

[24:48] Right don't look at them

[24:51] They're poor forget about right there. Yeah, that was the that was a lot I wanted to show you

[24:56] What happens is when you have a commodity driven or price driven

[25:00] Market or offering

[25:02] You continue to compete on price and so what happens is everyone offers a little bit more for a little bit less and the keep going until

[25:08] Basically everyone's a non-profit everyone keeps their head barely above water

[25:12] One month's profitable one month's not one month's profitable. Is this in my town anybody their life story right now anyone?

[25:17] Okay, and it's because you're playing the wrong game

[25:20] It's a wrong game

[25:22] You have to be in a place where it doesn't matter what anyone else is charging because why would you want to compete with them?

[25:28] Then you have to be compared

[25:30] Ah, socks no fun right so we want to have a

[25:35] Virtuous cycle of price rather than a vicious cycle of price because everyone's doing a little bit more for a little bit less

[25:38] A little bit more for a little bit less than everyone can't do any more for any less

[25:42] Which sucks?

[25:43] So this is the better way call this the virtuous cycle of price

[25:47] When you increase your price

[25:50] Your prospects

[25:52] Increase their emotional investment

[25:54] They increase their perceived value when you increase your price

[25:58] Their results increase as a consequence of their emotional investment

[26:03] Their demandingness goes down

[26:06] When you charge more anyone had the rich client who just says oh, yeah, I sent the wire this morning and then somebody's fighting you over fifty dollars

[26:12] Anyone else?

[26:13] Yes, of course

[26:15] I'm a great client

[26:17] I just said money. I just don't be an ass. Thank you, right?

[26:21] When you increase the price I

[26:23] Can't even ruin it says revenue for fulfillment progress rate you make more money so you can actually do better shit for them

[26:29] So you actually in a very real way get better

[26:31] And the more you do this the more your price goes up the more their invest emotional investment goes up the more they value it the better the results get the less demanding

[26:39] They are and the more you have left over to continue to reinvest in the value can provide them

[26:44] Because of virtuous cycle

[26:45] Right, and the flip side of that is that you decrease your price they decrease their emotional investment

[26:50] They decrease the perceived value because they see you as a cheap alternative

[26:52] They decrease their results because they don't give a fuck about it

[26:55] They become more demanding because their cheap skates and then finally you have less money left over to provide value is this making sense?

[27:01] Okay

[27:03] And

[27:03] Boat there's more your business when you increase your price you make way more profit

[27:08] Right you feel better because you're like I'm a good business person

[27:12] I'm a good at this game right so you increase your you increase your profit you increase how much you feel about yourself

[27:19] Your perception of impact because of the results goes up because you're like I'm doing good in the world not only am I making more money

[27:24] Am I good at business? I'm actually helping people because I have profit left over to actually invest in the value

[27:29] Right

[27:30] Now our service level increases because the people that I can attract as a result

[27:35] Right because you can pay more people like from a laylist thing and

[27:38] We have sales team conviction and this is actually a really underrated one

[27:43] I've trained a lot of sales teams of my life

[27:47] The one thing that Trump's all training is

[27:50] belief

[27:51] And if they believe the heart of the founder of the heart of the CEO is to actually help the people that you were selling to

[27:59] They will sell with a completely different frame

[28:02] The best sales person that we had in our and our company at Jim Lodge, we still have

[28:06] I have heard his calls

[28:09] The man is a savage like board like sacrifice

[28:15] Love you

[28:16] I've heard him on calls after like the third or fourth objection and he'll just take his

[28:21] Dig his head off and he'll rub his eyes and he's like

[28:25] I'm not giving up on you dad

[28:29] He's like I know you need this and I you got a lot of stuff that's that's preventing

[28:34] He's like but I know that this is the thing that you need to get to where you want to go

[28:37] He's like so let's let's keep talking through it. Let's figure this out man

[28:40] It's like there's only one way that your life's gonna change is through us like I know everyone else is stuff

[28:46] I know you got no other options like I'm here guys. Let's make this work and like I have seen you do this again

[28:52] And again now how many people on your sales team after they get one objection?

[28:59] Right

[29:01] Because they don't believe because if they really believed

[29:05] This is this is a really good example

[29:08] So let's say that you could go back in time to yourself and give yourself one investing tip

[29:13] Just one 10 years ago

[29:16] There's probably a stock or a thing or whatever that was really small then would be really big now probably change your life

[29:22] Right think of that thing in your head now imagine you go now, but you don't look like you

[29:27] But you're seeing your old self 10 years ago and you're like you have to do this thing and you can't say that it's you

[29:36] How convicted would you be to get them to do the thing?

[29:39] They'd be like nah, I'm not really I don't really know any of that stuff. You're like dude

[29:43] You need to do this

[29:46] Like

[29:47] Come on man

[29:50] The thing is is that that frame is the frame of what good salesman saw with

[29:54] Because they genuinely want the person to do the thing to benefit

[29:58] If you are the cheapest price and that's not what you built your business strategy around so I want to be very clear

[30:04] There is a strategy to be the low cost later

[30:06] Virtually every person who I've heard say that they're cutting their prices to get more customers

[30:10] That was not the strategy to start their business with the only way you can start that is your strategy is that from day one

[30:16] You have a cost-driven culture you build a tech tool that automates a ton of

[30:20] Manual labor you take labor from overseas exclusively

[30:24] You have a culture of cost cutting budgeting like Walmart that's their strategy

[30:29] For virtually everyone else there is no benefit to trying to keep cutting your prices

[30:33] But there's a very big one for being the most valuable

[30:36] You dig all

[30:40] Quick one so they did this science experiment

[30:44] I think it's really cool and they presented three wines to blind taste testers and they said they didn't say this

[30:50] They're like there's a cheap line. There's a middle price wine and expensive one

[30:53] So those are three wines that people try them right and then after they tried them

[30:57] They had them rate them so they said the the cheap one tasted like cheap wine the middle one tastes like medium wine and the expensive one tastes like great one right

[31:05] Here's what's wild

[31:07] They're the exact same fucking wine

[31:12] There is a bi-directional relationship with price and value

[31:16] People if you want to in a very real way increase the value that people perceive about your product

[31:23] You can make it more expensive and they will value it more

[31:28] How nuts is that it also makes you more money

[31:33] Right, there's my head right blown up

[31:37] Which means price itself is a component of value?

[31:40] So the goal is to be so much more expensive that a consumer must pause and think this can't be the same category of solutions everyone else

[31:49] It's so much works. My eyes have this can be the same thing right and then it pulls you into another category

[31:55] She make a decision or you force them to make a decision in a vacuum all right

[31:59] No, if you have any kind of service this is more for services if you have a service where a client has to perform something in order to be successful

[32:09] Then it would follow that the more invested they are the more invested they'll be which in turn creates better students and better outcomes

[32:15] So like if you want to help someone you have to charge them enough that it would hurt them so that they actually do it

[32:22] The most successful weight loss offer I think of all time

[32:28] I am a little bit biased was the one that we ran for gym lunch

[32:32] It's called the six-week challenge. Here's the stick if you would come in

[32:36] We would say hey you can wish 20 pounds six weeks you put $500 down if you lose the weight

[32:42] You get the money back

[32:44] Everyone had real skin in the game. There's a number one offer for the entire industry from its five years

[32:49] Because it was so compelling compared to like a membership whatever bullshit thing that was out there and

[32:56] When we did that we had 78% of people succeed and

[33:02] Hit the goal people are like oh, it's the stick that you like no one hit it. I was like no people want to get their money back

[33:07] The stick was that most people need to lose more than 20 pounds

[33:10] Right, or when you lose 20 pounds you look yourself in the mirror like I look pretty flat

[33:13] And you're like right you should turn up we should do the rest of this stuff right so that was the thing

[33:16] But they believed that we could help them because we did and we got them invested more than a traditional gym membership

[33:22] Plus remember we're competing in $29 membership so 500 is very very expensive that makes sense

[33:28] Think about how you can apply this within your own business to separate and create another category

[33:33] right so

[33:35] When you charge more you also as a side note increase the quality of your prospects

[33:40] Which increases the quality of your product like I said earlier with the CRO example

[33:46] If you increase the prices it takes all the shitty people out and then by doing that you only get people who are smarter

[33:51] More able etc and then all of a sudden your percentage results go up because you're dealing with the right people right don't have to sell to everybody

[33:58] So we actually did this with one this is a different way lost print one of our portfolio companies

[34:02] They were doing 450,000 a month

[34:04] 5 to 1 row as closer it was 30%

[34:08] Profit was about 150,000 a month and so we made one change to the business

[34:14] I looked at everything and I was like we're just gonna raise your price by 50% change nothing else

[34:20] It was like what about all the other like let's just do that

[34:24] It's like really like that's that's it that's what we're gonna do like of all the levers we have

[34:30] In percentage like I already done a bunch of research on other people that are competitors etc. I was like I think the price

[34:35] The market gets in stays sustained this here's what's crazy

[34:40] Went to a million a month with the eight weeks

[34:43] And to 10 to one row as they're closed right went up

[34:50] And they're profit almost tripled in eight weeks

[34:56] Because people believe that the thing was going to be worth more and they got better results as a consequence and they got better people to buy

[35:07] There you go, so 2.7 to 6.6

[35:09] Okay, that's why charge law for it so making it making offers will make you more money than anything else

[35:14] Number two while making why selling to the right people will make you more money

[35:18] Number three why charge a lot of money for it number four

[35:21] How to reverse engineer value. I'm gonna do it on time. Okay, so

[35:26] I'm gonna go over

[35:29] Is that cool? All right, okay?

[35:33] So if you're gonna charge a lot of money for it. You might as well make it remarkable

[35:38] So this was our gym lord's event

[35:44] There's 700 people on this room

[35:46] 42,000 year each

[35:49] Wild right so my dad saw this picture on Facebook cost me a

[35:53] And he's like hey I saw that event. I thought I was supposed to be like for your really expensive highest paying people

[35:59] I was like it was he's like not the one that was like 40,000 year. I was like yeah, it was

[36:05] It's like do they know

[36:10] That you're that you're charging them that money. I was like yeah, they're aware. I'm not magically sci-fiening money from their account. They're aware

[36:19] What like blue is like couldn't couldn't fathom it right it's 28 million dollars right there and so

[36:25] It's like okay

[36:26] So I could this is like a teaching moment, right so it was like all right well

[36:31] I bet you that you would pay me that amount of money too

[36:36] He's like what it's like okay

[36:38] So let's say that I could triple the profit of your business because he's a small business

[36:43] I was like okay, there's like and I

[36:48] Would and I could do that he's like well

[36:52] What would I have to do?

[36:54] Like you'd have to show up 10 hours a week more than you currently do. I was like okay

[36:58] I could do that so like well

[37:02] Headed anyone like would anybody else have already done this thing too and I was like yeah

[37:06] 4,000 people would already have gone through the same process as what I would be taking you through

[37:10] It's like how long would I have to wait?

[37:14] It's like about a year for you to get I was like it would be eight weeks free to ROI and then 12 months. Yes

[37:22] Okay, well, then you know what we're gonna do value equations awesome fucking rocks. There's four variables

[37:27] You got a jar of something that's a have a dream outcome that's amazing

[37:31] You have to increase the perceived likelihood of achievement which is the questions my father was asking me

[37:35] You have to do it as fast as you can you have to make it as easy as possible

[37:38] If you think about those four things within the value that you're charging you will make something more valuable

[37:42] So good fast cheap easy

[37:45] So how can you make it easier how can you deliver it faster?

[37:48] How can make sure it's something they actually want and how can you increase or decrease the risk that they associate with the purchase to make sense

[37:55] Okay, so lots of variables lots of da very fun. There's no process to this exciting cool

[38:04] Everyone understand how to reverse into your value

[38:08] Fantastic so we got two left so this is the one left

[38:11] So here's my quick recap. I've been understand why making better off of the strongest level you have to figure business. Yes

[38:18] Number two and you can say yes back does everyone understand that a big component of values picking the right people say yes

[38:25] Does everyone understand the direct link between price and value and that increasing it both increases the perceived value and your profits?

[38:31] Say yes

[38:33] Number four is everyone understand that value isn't in a more-fist word, but a formula that can be repeated over and over again

[38:38] Say yes

[38:39] All right last piece is a demonstration

[38:43] So I said five minutes there we got we're good

[38:47] There

[38:49] So how do you scarcity urgency guarantees bonuses in name

[38:53] There's a lot of other things you can do to enhance the value get more people by your shit

[38:57] I obviously can't do it in the next three minutes, but I'm gonna do my best to give you a demonstration. All right

[39:03] So we're gonna do an exercise to wrap this up and I think we'll do more any we'll do more for you

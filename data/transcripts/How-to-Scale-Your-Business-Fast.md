[00:00] What's going on everyone?

[00:00] I've got a super special podcast

[00:02] that's for you today.

[00:04] What I wanna talk to you about is how

[00:07] to answer the hardest questions in business

[00:09] using one math equation that only has three variables.

[00:12] All right, and don't worry, it'll be worth it.

[00:15] This is the number one thing.

[00:16] This is the number one equation

[00:17] that I use in my entire life, all right?

[00:19] Four businesses, the one that I use most frequently.

[00:22] And where this all started for me was,

[00:25] I remember when I had my gyms,

[00:27] which is a recurring revenue business, obviously.

[00:30] I just, I wanted to know how we were doing,

[00:33] but my data tracking wasn't great

[00:35] and I, you know, it just like,

[00:37] stuff was all over the place.

[00:38] And I just didn't know how what we were doing

[00:40] and what we were on track for.

[00:42] And I just didn't know how it worked.

[00:43] And I was like, man, I wish I could just like

[00:45] see into the future,

[00:45] I wish I knew what this would end up like, right?

[00:49] And so I was playing around with math stuff.

[00:52] And this is actually at a time

[00:53] when I was trying to get better at math

[00:54] because I'm not, I wasn't naturally good at math.

[00:57] And so I was just like trying like right out

[00:59] of what like how I would try to calculate this

[01:01] and I really struggled with it.

[01:03] And one day I was driving,

[01:05] and it actually just hit me and I was like,

[01:07] what if I just divided it by this?

[01:09] And that would just tell me the number.

[01:10] And it turns out I was right.

[01:12] And so what I would explain to you

[01:14] is the number one equation that I use the most

[01:17] in all of business, I call it the pie equation.

[01:21] All right?

[01:21] Now it has nothing to do with pie, PI, right?

[01:25] And it has everything to do with any kind of,

[01:28] just I mean really just all business.

[01:30] It is the sweetest equation ever, I love it.

[01:33] I use it all the time.

[01:34] All right.

[01:35] So what is the pie equation?

[01:36] Why is it called pie?

[01:37] I actually think I was dieting at the time,

[01:39] so I call it pie because it looks like a pie

[01:40] when I drew it out, pie like the pie you eat.

[01:43] No actual real reason.

[01:45] I call it this and for some reason it has stock.

[01:48] All right?

[01:49] And so it is a simple equation,

[01:50] it is a division equation.

[01:52] All right, very simple draw a big line here.

[01:54] All right?

[01:55] And what it essentially is,

[01:56] I'll draw a smaller one here so you can see it.

[01:58] Is inflow divided by outflow.

[02:04] All right?

[02:05] So why is this useful?

[02:07] So for me, I like to have a very good idea

[02:10] of where my business is at,

[02:11] where we're growing, where we're shrinking,

[02:13] what if we just did this for the rest of a year,

[02:16] or forever, what we'd end up at?

[02:18] And that is exactly what this question answers.

[02:21] What's important about this is that the inflow

[02:24] is actually a rate thing.

[02:28] So basically you're dividing rates to get an outcome.

[02:30] All right, I'm not gonna get like super into it

[02:32] because that's not what's important.

[02:34] What's important is understanding what it will give you,

[02:37] which is your hypothetical max, right?

[02:39] And it gives you three different hypothetical maxes

[02:42] so that you can calculate stuff for your business, all right?

[02:44] So for example, let's say I have an inflow

[02:49] of five new customers per month, all right?

[02:52] I get five new customers a month.

[02:53] And let's say that my churn on my membership

[02:56] and my current, my service, whatever, right?

[02:59] As let's say it's 10%.

[03:01] All right, so that's 0.1, 10%.

[03:03] All right?

[03:04] So if I wanna know what the maximum of customers

[03:08] I will be able to have given this inflow,

[03:11] I can project that.

[03:12] So right now, if I have, let's say 30 clients,

[03:16] if I'm doing this and getting five new clients a month

[03:19] and losing 10%, it means that I will be growing

[03:22] because 10% of 30 would be three and I'm getting five, right?

[03:27] But at some point in the future, right, as I go on,

[03:31] there will be a point where 10% is equivalent to five

[03:33] and at that point I'd reach equilibrium.

[03:36] And so that is when I would have reached my hypothetical max.

[03:39] And so why this is so important is that when I do this

[03:42] little equation, let's say it's five divided by point one,

[03:45] which is 50, right?

[03:48] Which means 50 is gonna be my hypothetical max.

[03:51] So I know that if I'm signing up five people every month

[03:54] and I'm losing 10% of my clients every month

[03:57] that I will reach a business that has 50 clients on average

[04:00] and I will not be able to increase that number ever

[04:04] unless I either increase the amount of people I set up,

[04:07] the rate at which I set them up, or I decrease the rate

[04:11] at which people leave.

[04:12] And that's it.

[04:14] Pretty cool, right?

[04:15] This equation has changed my life.

[04:17] So what it does is it allows me to make very quick

[04:20] calculations to understand where I'm at

[04:22] with a really well, with a reshrinking, et cetera.

[04:25] So for example, if we had the same equation where I said,

[04:28] I had 30 people right now and I said,

[04:30] I'm signing up two people a month, right?

[04:33] And I've got 10% churn.

[04:35] Then I know that the hypothetical max of that is 20, right?

[04:39] Is 20, which means that I'm gonna be shrinking

[04:43] from 30 to 20 over the next half of many months

[04:44] unless I fix this.

[04:46] And so it gives me very clear snapshot

[04:48] of whatever I'm currently doing extrapolates

[04:52] to the future.

[04:53] Now, you probably already have some ideas

[04:55] of how you could use this in your business, right?

[04:57] This gives you a hypothetical max

[04:58] of projects out your current rate

[05:00] so you can understand where you're going.

[05:02] That's the point, all right?

[05:04] Now, let me draw a little dotted line here.

[05:07] That is the first use of this equation.

[05:10] The second use is understanding lifetime value, all right?

[05:13] So let's say that we have a client

[05:15] in the average revenue per client that we have per month,

[05:19] let's say is $500.

[05:21] All right?

[05:22] So let's say it's, let's use a different number.

[05:24] I'll say $1,000, all right?

[05:25] That's a little simple, all right?

[05:26] So $1,000 per month is my average revenue per client.

[05:31] Now, let's say that I can keep a $1,000 per month client

[05:36] for five months.

[05:37] So my churn, right?

[05:38] The percentage that would leave every month

[05:40] would be 20%.

[05:42] So 20% which would be 0.2, right?

[05:45] Is my rate of people leaving?

[05:46] 20% of my customers.

[05:47] So if I have 10 customers, two leave every month.

[05:49] It's 20%.

[05:50] All right, it's churn.

[05:51] Now, when I phrase the equation or whatever,

[05:55] when I frame it this way, I can now extrapolate

[05:58] how much this person is worth to me.

[06:00] So if I know that my average person pays me $1,000 a month

[06:03] and I know that on average 20% of my customers leave every month,

[06:06] then I know that my customers are an average worth $5,000.

[06:12] Which is $1,000 divided by 0.2.

[06:15] Pretty sweet, right?

[06:16] So now I know that if all customers that come to me,

[06:19] if I change nothing or worth $5,000,

[06:21] then that gives me a number that I can go on market with.

[06:24] I know that I can spend at least $1,000 to go

[06:27] to go acquire this customer, right?

[06:28] I'm using Rough Math, it'd be less than 2,000.

[06:30] You want to be a 3-to-1.

[06:32] I'm not going to give me that right now.

[06:33] But that's the point here is that this would give me Rough Math

[06:35] to know how much I could spend to acquire a customer.

[06:38] That's super useful.

[06:39] Now, with these two things together,

[06:44] I can know where my business is going to stall.

[06:47] I can also see how I can manipulate these variables

[06:51] in order to know where my business is going to reach.

[06:55] Now, I can also see if I'm increasing,

[06:57] if I'm growing my business or if I'm my business is shrinking,

[07:01] simply by knowing what my inflow of customers

[07:03] in versus my outflow.

[07:05] Now, you can also do this on a bigger scale.

[07:10] I said, it's three variations of the same concept.

[07:13] Now, let's say I'm sending up $10,000

[07:15] of new business.

[07:17] So this is the same concept as this.

[07:19] What I was talking about over here

[07:20] where you know I'm sending up five customers a month.

[07:22] But this is just basically combining the first two things

[07:25] into one overall number.

[07:26] So I'm sending up $10,000 a month of new business.

[07:30] That's what I'm sending up in new business per month.

[07:34] Now, if I know that I'm losing, again, 10%

[07:38] of my revenue per month, then I know, as 10%,

[07:43] which is point one, right?

[07:45] Or point one.

[07:47] Then I know that this business is going to cap out

[07:52] at $100,000 per month.

[07:55] Now, again, the reason that that's important

[07:57] and the reason that I use all three of these variations

[07:59] of this equation is because I can see

[08:01] if I'm shrinking or I'm getting bigger.

[08:03] If I know that we signed up $10,000 in a month

[08:06] and we're doing 10% turn and where I know

[08:09] we're gonna extrapolate out to $100,000 a month.

[08:11] But if we're currently at $200, I'm like,

[08:13] that's not good, we need to fix something.

[08:15] Or if we're at $50, I'll be like,

[08:16] that's awesome, we're gonna double.

[08:18] But the thing is, is that you're gonna double

[08:20] and then you're going to cap and what's more

[08:24] is that as you do this,

[08:28] unless you have negative turn,

[08:29] which most people do not have in service based businesses,

[08:32] what's gonna happen is that your rate of growth

[08:34] is going to slow, all right?

[08:35] So it looks like this.

[08:38] All right?

[08:39] So this is gonna be your hypothetical max, right at the top here.

[08:43] All right?

[08:44] And so what happens is you quickly,

[08:45] like when you have zero clients,

[08:46] when you sign up 10 people,

[08:48] right?

[08:49] Boom, you have a huge explosion in growth, right?

[08:50] Percentage wise, it's like a vertical line, right?

[08:53] But the next month when you have 10 and you lose two,

[08:55] now you have eight, but then you gain another 10,

[08:57] but you only gain eight, right?

[08:59] But then now you lose 10% again, right?

[09:02] So you lose, or is there 20% again?

[09:03] But then you lose three because 10% is bigger of 18, right?

[09:07] So now you drop down to 15,

[09:08] if you add another 10, right?

[09:09] But now you're 25, but you notice how the rate goes from 10 to eight

[09:14] to seven, right?

[09:16] The growth continues to slow down over time

[09:20] because churn eats out of bigger and bigger percentage, right?

[09:23] And so with this,

[09:26] you can know that this is gonna be your hypothetical max,

[09:28] realistically the most business seven of volatility,

[09:31] that once you're at about 80, 90% of your max,

[09:33] which would be like right here, right?

[09:35] It's realistically where you'll usually end up

[09:37] having up because your fluctuations in business are such that,

[09:41] that's around where you're gonna be.

[09:43] Now I'm gonna add in a bonus thing for you,

[09:46] which is called the building ratio.

[09:48] And so the golden ratio is the way to beat this equation.

[09:50] So that you actually never end your growth.

[09:52] Here's how it works.

[09:56] We're gonna have two rates.

[09:57] So you have the rate of people leaving, right?

[10:00] Leaving percentage.

[10:02] You can put that as whatever you want,

[10:03] fancy word is churn,

[10:05] leaving percentage, excess percentage,

[10:06] cancel percentage, whatever.

[10:08] And then here, you have your referral percentage.

[10:13] This is where things get magical.

[10:15] So, if 10% of your customers were to refer a new customer,

[10:19] everyone, and 5% of your customers leave every month,

[10:23] then you have 10% or 5%.

[10:29] And it means that your business will double every growth pair.

[10:33] Sorry, it will continue to unendingly grow

[10:37] because the more people who come in,

[10:39] from referrals, a smaller percentage leave every month.

[10:41] And this is called an negative churn.

[10:43] This is where you have a business

[10:45] that grows faster than it turns on its own

[10:48] without paid advertising because your product is so good.

[10:52] That is where we all want to go.

[10:54] This is the promised land.

[10:55] This is the golden ratio, just what I call it.

[10:59] And when you can achieve this,

[11:02] you can grow forever.

[11:04] Now, realistically, you don't grow forever

[11:07] because you'll get big enough and you'll mess up

[11:08] something up in the novel,

[11:09] said in your referral, percentage will go down

[11:10] and your churn percentage will go up.

[11:11] One of those things happen.

[11:12] But when you can achieve this for a period of time,

[11:15] that is when you have a crazy growth.

[11:17] Because not only are you getting customers

[11:19] from your normal acquisition channels,

[11:20] but you're actually the percentage of customers

[11:23] who refer, which is why it's important,

[11:26] is it's stays fixed and it's greater

[11:28] than your percentage churn.

[11:28] And so it just continues to grow and grow.

[11:31] Well, which is awesome.

[11:33] So as a quick recap for you,

[11:35] the pie equation is the most used equation

[11:36] that I use in all of business,

[11:38] especially if you have a recurring revenue base business.

[11:40] But even if you do not,

[11:42] it's still an awesome equation.

[11:44] And I use it in three specific ways.

[11:46] One is so that I can know whether I'm growing or shrinking.

[11:49] Number one, number two,

[11:50] I used to extrapolate out what my current acquisition

[11:54] versus my outflow rate.

[11:56] How much I'm going to level out at?

[11:59] This equation gives me the answer.

[12:01] To the same degree, it also gives me

[12:03] my hypothetical lifetime value per client.

[12:06] So I can know that how much I can spend

[12:08] to a car customer, because I can know exactly

[12:11] what they're going to be worth to me,

[12:12] given their churn with a payment on average per month.

[12:15] And again, I can put all those things together

[12:17] into one number where I say,

[12:18] I'm starting up this much new business per month

[12:19] and this much business is leaving.

[12:22] And this is going to be my overall number.

[12:24] This top number is going to be the overall number

[12:26] that I'm going to be able to generate per month in my business.

[12:32] And so putting all these things together

[12:33] is I use this equation five times a day.

[12:37] I use it all the time.

[12:38] I use it when I'm coaching people,

[12:39] I use it when I'm thinking about how we're doing.

[12:42] And this is the type of back-and-out in math

[12:44] that I feel like every entrepreneur needs to have

[12:47] in order to be able to understand

[12:48] where their business is and how it's doing.

[12:51] And let me show you one more way to use this,

[12:52] because like I said, I use this question

[12:54] literally every day all the time.

[12:57] And it's by combining two of those pieces.

[13:00] So if I had, like I said earlier,

[13:03] let's say I had $5,000 was the lifetime value,

[13:06] that I calculated, which was based off of $1,000 per month

[13:12] divided by 20% turn, right?

[13:15] That gives me my $5,000.

[13:17] Now, let's say that I know that I'm signing up,

[13:21] 20 clients a month, I can know that simply by these two numbers,

[13:26] I know what my inflow is, 20 clients a month,

[13:29] and I know that they're going to be worth $5,000 total,

[13:32] then I know that my business is going to level out

[13:34] at $100,000 per month, all right?

[13:38] This is like the biggest thing ever.

[13:41] This is how this, like the whole game works.

[13:43] Like this is the equation,

[13:44] this is how everything that I extrapolate

[13:46] is off of this thing, all right?

[13:48] And so 20, right, per month.

[13:51] Now here's where it gets tricky,

[13:52] because you're like, well that makes sense, it's math, yeah,

[13:54] but it doesn't look like that when you're in it.

[13:56] Because when you're in it, you sign up 20 customers

[13:59] and you're at $1,000 a month per customer,

[14:00] you're doing $20,000 a month.

[14:02] And you don't know if you're doing well or not,

[14:04] because you don't can't see into the future

[14:06] to see that if you just keep doing what you're doing

[14:08] and you don't break it and you don't get entrepreneur,

[14:10] ADD and you don't get shiny objects, you're just

[14:12] keep doing what you're doing every month,

[14:15] you drop another 20 in, right?

[14:17] You drop another 20 in, you drop another 20 in,

[14:19] then you're going to get to $100,000 a month, right?

[14:22] It takes time for recurring revenue businesses

[14:24] to get interaction.

[14:25] And so if you understand this, it can give you

[14:27] kind of this piece of mind and understanding

[14:29] where you're going, where you're at,

[14:30] whether you're growing, whether you're shrinking,

[14:32] and what you need to do to fix it.

[14:34] Because with these equations, you can say,

[14:36] either I have to increase the lifetime value,

[14:38] I have to buy either increasing the price

[14:40] or decreasing the turn, which is one of those two things,

[14:43] or I have to increase my inflow.

[14:45] And simply by understanding those three pieces,

[14:47] piece number one, which is mere price,

[14:49] piece number two, which is your turn,

[14:50] piece number three, which is your inflow.

[14:52] If you understand those three pieces,

[14:53] then you can understand exactly.

[14:56] How to make your business however big you want.

[14:58] So that is the pie equation.

[15:00] This is the most used equation that I use.

[15:02] I wish I could have a sexier title for this,

[15:04] because everyone needs to watch it

[15:05] and understand it in absolute depth,

[15:06] because this is everything when I talk to a business owner

[15:10] when they're struggling, when they don't know what to do,

[15:12] this is what I use.

[15:14] This is it.

[15:15] This is what I use.

[15:16] When I'm trying to figure out what their business

[15:18] is, I'm like, what's your inflow?

[15:19] What's your turn?

[15:20] What's your average price per user?

[15:22] It's the first thing I'm asking.

[15:23] Literally, it's the first two questions of last.

[15:24] And then I'm like, what's your revenue right now?

[15:26] And just by knowing that, I can know whether they're growing,

[15:28] whether they're shrinking, how fast they're growing,

[15:30] I can know where they're going to level out.

[15:32] I can know how many customers they're going to level out.

[15:34] At, I can know all of these things,

[15:37] simply by asking those four pieces of data

[15:41] and having this equation in my back pocket.

[15:44] And so I use this every day.

[15:46] It's like I breathe this equation

[15:48] and the more you play with it,

[15:49] the more you understand it,

[15:50] the more powerful you be as an entrepreneur

[15:52] and I promise you it will be worth mastering.

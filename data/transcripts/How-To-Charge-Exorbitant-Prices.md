[00:00] What's going on everyone? In today's video, I'm going to show you how to charge

[00:02] an exorbitant prices for your goods and services.

[00:06] So, not that long ago, my wife and I were at a charity event for after school all

[00:09] stars at Arnold Schwarzenegger's house. And I saw some of the most beautiful displays

[00:15] of understanding market economics that I've ever seen.

[00:19] And so at the end of that night, I had my hand raised and I donated a million dollars

[00:23] alone that evening based on the way that they had many ability to the event.

[00:27] And so to rewind this story for you briefly, right as I was coming into the event,

[00:32] right as people are meeting each other, they want to introduce me to some of the other

[00:35] board members of the charities, the CEO of the charity, Ben, was talking to one of the

[00:40] gentlemen there who's a big donor. And he said, ah, what he did and when his recommendation

[00:45] was, was brilliant and I was so free to do it, but I'm so glad we did. And I was like,

[00:49] what did he say to do? And he said, well, last year we sold the tickets for $10,000 a

[00:54] head just to attend the event in PlayPoker. He said, but this year it was $25,000.

[00:59] And we actually sold more people. But I was like, that's crazy. And gentlemen, I found out

[01:04] later, had made all of his fortune in the ultra high-end jewelry business. And so that

[01:10] is a business of purely understanding the demand curve, supplying demand in how to raise

[01:14] prices. And so he said something to me and he said it so smuggly and so like, can

[01:18] tell with himself in this moment that I just, it's just like, edge into my brain. He said,

[01:22] we said to remember when demand increases, he said, you cut supply. And he said it just

[01:27] like, it's a cut supply. And what that does is it jacks prices through the roof because

[01:31] now you have more people who wanted it than before. And there are a few were items for sale.

[01:37] And so by doing that, you get these massively-inflated prices, which plenty of us probably

[01:41] sold during the whole pandemic and things like that that happened on some goods that

[01:46] were theirs. All of all of a sudden demand increased, right? And so as it has the extension

[01:50] and supply went down and then that is what jacks up prices. And the thing is, you can

[01:54] harness that in your own business. All right? So if you've ever looked at Chanel, for example,

[02:00] if you want to buy Chanel bag, and these are the best people to look at. The people have

[02:03] been doing this for hundreds of years, you know, at least a hundred years, like Chanel,

[02:07] they don't quite know that. But long time, right? Louis Vuitton, they have figured out,

[02:12] they have hacked how to generate and stimulate demand. All right? So, in a Chanel store,

[02:17] for example, they have one-two bags that are available. Corporate doesn't let the stores know

[02:23] how many end of what bags they're going to receive. It's a complete mystery, complete surprise.

[02:28] And they don't tell them when they're going to stop producing stuff and they do it all the time.

[02:31] And so what happens is they create this experience where when you walk in the door, there's absolute

[02:36] scarcity there because every bag is limited edition. There's only one of a kind. They're

[02:40] like, that one can the only bag you receive. You can't even buy these things online and they do that

[02:44] by design so they can stimulate higher prices. And so, just as a quick point of this, I don't

[02:51] really want to buy something. And you, you know, right as they were about to tell you the price

[02:57] of the thing, you've got kind of scary, you know your exposed because you're like, I really

[03:00] want this thing, right? And obviously, they tell you the price and you're like, thank God,

[03:05] I would have paid so much more than that. That is a missed opportunity because you would

[03:09] have paid so much more. And as the business owner, you need to know how to stimulate that.

[03:13] And so I'll tell you one final example and then I'll get into this price curve behind you.

[03:16] If I were to sell a day of my time for five people, right? I can probably say tomorrow,

[03:23] hey, it's $20,000 for a day, there's five of you in the room, it'll be intimate, click

[03:28] here to buy, right? Short. But what I'm missing is the number one and number two people

[03:34] of those five might have been willing to pay $200,000 for that day. And so the thing is

[03:40] as you cut units, so this is supply, this is diminished, this is my correctonomics, what

[03:46] I want to want. As you cut supply, right? As supply goes down, then what happens is you

[03:52] can look all around this demand per person, right? Supply goes down, you can raise the price

[03:55] here. What ends up happening most times is that people will cut their supply, but then

[03:59] they will keep their price at a lower price, right? So they'll cut the supply to here, but

[04:03] they'll price here rather than pricing all the way here. And the thing is, there's so

[04:08] much extra juice in the squeeze that's available for you if you just know this. And so

[04:14] my first recommendation for you is if you can create a limited or very scarce service

[04:21] or service level or product that you can release, I guarantee you that you will make

[04:26] more money. This is the reason and one of the things that isn't taught about this

[04:30] micro-ponomics demand curve is that they assume a static condition, meaning perfect

[04:34] marketplace, all people have perfect information. And as you shift the price, you

[04:40] try to find the sweet spot. But what they don't take into account is that this demand

[04:46] curve can shift based on marketing. So if you think about marketing is an a general

[04:51] perspective, marketing is artificially stimulating demand. You're purposely letting

[04:55] more people know about what you do so that you can generate demand inwards so you can

[04:59] shift your way this way on this on this graph, right? Sorry, this way this graph, excuse

[05:03] it. And so what we can do here is that if we have stimulated demand, demand goes this way,

[05:10] right? Boom. It goes all the way down to here, which means that our prices, we actually

[05:16] can go even further along this curve to increase the price. And here's one of the magic

[05:20] things about when you control, supply. If I were to sell three people, that $100,000 a

[05:26] day for example. I made a more money than I did selling five people in 20K a day. But not

[05:30] only that, it's easier for me to fulfill for three people. So I create less operational

[05:36] drag. I have way more profit, right? And I created an air of premium and I could also

[05:42] deliver to those clients even more than I could before. All right? And so if you have a

[05:47] fundamental understanding of how this works, the supply demand curve that you can work

[05:51] in your favor. And one of the biggest mistakes that I see is most entrepreneurs is that

[05:55] they spend too much time trying to supply and not enough time trying to generate demand.

[06:01] The demand is the power that's coming towards you. It's you satisfying. And so you want

[06:05] to think about it like a seductive dance, right? Where someone has this desire, right?

[06:11] But you want to delay. You don't want to satisfy me. You want to delay. You want to delay.

[06:14] Right? Now there is a snapping point where someone eventually feels rejected, but it is far,

[06:18] far, far longer, and further away the most people think. Right? And so what you can do

[06:23] is you tease things. You you you you flood with them. You whisper things that are coming

[06:27] up. You drop these little hints, drop these little hints. Right? You create a waiting list,

[06:31] right? If you had a service and you said, hey, to work with me, I'm all the way over here

[06:35] because I can only take five clients. Period. Period. And you cap it. And you cap it, right?

[06:41] You're five clients. Period. Well, I can I can I can I can set your for the waiting list.

[06:44] And I'll let you know when when we have more thoughts. You will generate more demand

[06:48] because they'll also be alert around what you do. He must be good or she must be good

[06:53] because they have a waiting list because they get they are no longer at capacity. And so what

[06:58] of the interesting things about being at full capacity is it's completely up to you what full capacity

[07:02] means. You can say today that you are full. Think about that. You could say, oh, we're completely

[07:07] capped out. You could cut off your supply to zero, right? And so as soon as you cut your

[07:12] supply to zero, you're probably shoots that way, right? And so you cut your supply to zero,

[07:16] saying, I don't take anyone. And then what happens is this pressure builds. And it looks like

[07:21] a pop, right? And then you want to periodically let off the steam. You don't want to be letting

[07:26] off the steam on top because of the pressure never builds. And then pressure is your pricing power.

[07:32] And so to wrap this all for you, the reason it was such a tremendous experience for me to see

[07:37] this happen in the world is I saw them go from $10,000 to $25,000 to $25,000. And I saw them sell more,

[07:43] right? And so by understanding this, when you have a limited edition t-shirt and you drop it,

[07:48] you will actually sell more units, not because this curve is wrong, but because the way you market

[07:53] it by creating scarce, you shifted the demand to curve in your favor. People who would my

[07:58] other, otherwise buyers say, I'll buy later, now feel forced to buy and by extension we can

[08:03] jack our prices and actually end up selling more units overall. And so to wrap this up for you,

[08:10] one, if you can create an ultra high, very, very, very scarce, very, very small supply,

[08:15] type service for good or product, I guarantee you'll sell for more money and you'll get more people to buy it.

[08:20] And I think that if you just do that in your business in some way, you will see this power harness

[08:25] to your advantage and you'll see the pricing and profit around these things and you'll never want to go back.

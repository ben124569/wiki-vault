[00:00] I have 13 portfolio companies and I just doubled one of them in 60 days by solving five key problems.

[00:05] And what I'm going to do is show you the data of what it was before, why it was wrong,

[00:09] what we fixed, and what happened after it can join.

[00:11] Three young founders who are all sad because they were not making the amount of money that they wanted to make.

[00:19] So before I show you the data, let me explain what each of these terms actually mean.

[00:22] So show rate is the percentage of people who have an employment who show up for their appointment.

[00:27] So in any business, if you deal with people, you will have sessions or appointments,

[00:31] do you have a time slot that someone says they're going to show up, right?

[00:34] If it's a sales consult and they are prospect and they're going to show up to get sold.

[00:37] So if 500 people have an appointment and 70 show up, that would be a 70% show rate.

[00:42] The second one here is offer rate, which we forgot to put in the rate.

[00:45] So let me just put that in for you.

[00:47] There you go.

[00:47] Offer rate, which is the percentage of people that we actually make an offer too.

[00:51] You might be like, well, why would I not offer everybody?

[00:53] Well, not everyone's qualified.

[00:54] And so for example, if I work with only gym owners and somebody comes on it's like, oh,

[00:58] I'm a personal trainer, well, you shouldn't be here.

[00:59] We had all these other things that said don't be here, but you still can't.

[01:02] Why are you here?

[01:02] That means that you don't offer the money.

[01:04] And that's it. Now if 100% of people who showed up, show right?

[01:06] You were able to offer to.

[01:07] Then that means that your offer rate would be 100%.

[01:09] And that is an indicator of the quality of the lead flow that you have.

[01:12] The third is close rate.

[01:13] This depends on how you can track this.

[01:15] So you can either do a based on percentage of people who show or you can do it on percentage of people

[01:20] who are offered.

[01:21] What I normally do is I'll just track both.

[01:22] I'm going to guess that this one is off of offer rate because it's what we have here.

[01:25] It's good to have both stats here because let's say a salesman wants to artificially increase his

[01:30] close rate. Well, then he will just say, well, I'm not going to offer anyone unless I know they're

[01:34] going to say yes. And so then they're close rates high. And then they'll show that there's a really

[01:38] low quality score. But if that salesman, this is why having team stats is so important and

[01:42] individually is because if the team is all saying that they're offered at 70 and one guy

[01:45] saying is operates 30, but he has 100% close rate and they all have 30% close rates.

[01:49] We know where the data went. And this is why having high quality data allows you to see what the

[01:53] problems are. If I didn't have this percentage, then I wouldn't know it's because we have low quality

[01:57] leads or because my salesman saw this data allows me to identify the problem and then fix it.

[02:01] So the fourth set here is percentage of cash collected up front meaning. If we're selling $1,000

[02:06] widgets and the average cash we collect today is $500 because people do payment plans.

[02:11] Then we would know our cash collected percentage would be 50%. If I have a low

[02:15] close rate of a high cash collected percentage, that would tell me a different story then

[02:19] a really high close rate and really low cash collected percentage. I would be like, oh, so they're

[02:23] just getting anyone to say yes and taking $10 down if they can versus somebody saying we have a

[02:28] hard line. And so it's really trying to find the magic between these two and saying how can I get as many

[02:31] people will say yes and get as much cash collected at front. The final one here is just unit sold.

[02:35] And this is really just the output of these four. If we multiple of these things together,

[02:38] how many we end up closing? And that's the result. So beforehand, bam. We get a 49% show rate.

[02:45] So let's say we have 100 appointments. Now we have 49 who actually show for their

[02:49] appointment. And then of the 49, we're able to offer 83% of them beforehand. So 80% of that is 40.

[02:55] 40 people now are getting offered out of our original 100 appointments. Of the people get offered

[03:00] 27% of them, which is 10 people roughly are actually buying in that closing percentage. And then

[03:07] our cash collected from those 10 people is we're getting a little less than half of the cash that we

[03:11] closed down. Now I gave you 100 as a number, but the actual number of units sold for this business

[03:16] in the prior month was 56 units. All right. So this is current state. If you don't know these numbers

[03:22] in your business, you should so that you can improve them. Let's say I invested in your business today.

[03:26] The first thing we do is get the data so that we can see what baseline is. So we can see where the

[03:30] discrepancies are and where we think the biggest opportunities for improvement are. And you're going

[03:34] to have to wait till the end of the video. I'm going to show you what happened after. So let's

[03:37] start with problem number one or opportunity for improvement number one. We had a low show rate.

[03:42] As in based on our benchmarks of 70% for any kind of appointment type business, we think that we should

[03:46] have at least 70 there. Allen, which is a company that I had, all we did was show rates. We were doing

[03:51] 4,000 appointments a day. We experimented, we had a machine learning team to think like what was the

[03:56] number of communications that we had to have with a prospect? What was the delay between responses

[04:00] that got the most people? Or the total number of exchanges? How far apart with the exchanges?

[04:05] There is lots of data that we were able to collect. So their number was 49% of appointments were

[04:09] showing up. We wanted them to be out with 70%. This is our benchmark where we'd say, okay, this isn't

[04:14] a problem anymore. Now, do we want to improve things? Absolutely. But where are we going to allocate our

[04:18] effort at the constraint? This was a constraint. Now, to give context here, this Delta is a 40% difference.

[04:25] 40% is a lot. Think about the S&P 500. They're like, we're trying to grow 9% here. It's like boom,

[04:29] I unlocked that. I get 40% growth. I don't have to do anything else with 4 years in the S&P.

[04:33] Big wins. That's what we look for. Lots of things can affect show rate. By the way, the number one

[04:38] one that affects show rate is number of total times that's available. Take that to the bank.

[04:41] But one of the other ones is the targeting and the offer itself. So targeting is who's actually seeing

[04:46] this promotion? If I'm targeting teeny boppers, for example, I might get people to schedule,

[04:52] but then realize that they're not here for a laser hair removal point. So the targeting there

[04:57] would be off. And so that would affect our show rate. And that has nothing to do with our lead

[05:01] nurture sequence or a salesman or anything like that. It's just the wrong people we're seeing.

[05:04] So that was issue number one. For context for us, just to mention that Thundernith was 25 to 35

[05:10] worlds who were gainfully employed and loved their job. And this, when we came in to look at it,

[05:14] it was actually targeting 18 to 24 worlds. The reason that this was far off for us is that the

[05:19] ad objective, now I'm going to get a little bit tactile with you, ad acquisition not comment,

[05:22] hold code. We have media buyers. We have pros who do this for a living. And so when they zoomed in on

[05:27] how their media buyer was optimizing the traffic, they were optimizing it's what a lot of people

[05:31] would initially think they should do, which is optimizing for the lowest cost leads and the lowest

[05:35] cost deployments. What we had to do was switch to optimize around cost per sale. If we can optimize

[05:40] around who we actually sell to, we will shift where the sales come from. And just to give you how big

[05:45] of a problem this was, they had to cancel 75% of their deployments before the 49% show rate. The

[05:50] sales guy's just spending most of the time just looking at their deployment, looking up the

[05:53] person canceling to get their 49% show rate. And that's about the closest thing to literally

[05:57] burning money. So the second big problem was multitasking. And this really goes for any role, but

[06:02] especially like sales driven roles, they had a setting team and a closing team. And the setters were

[06:07] both trying to call leads to get appointments and then also nurturing and doing the follow-up to

[06:12] remind them of the appointment. And as similar as that may sound in your mind, it's too completely

[06:15] different activities. You're banging phones, calling people up, you're in that flow, and then

[06:19] you're like, oh wait, Sarah, has an appointment today. Let me go over mine, Sarah,

[06:22] just Sarah going to shut up and they're like, wait, I'm calling, and then you start like,

[06:24] it is you go back and forth, right? So they had three big issues. Number one is that they weren't

[06:29] double dialect, right? Which is one of the most common things that you can do by the way for

[06:32] doing phone calls because a lot of initial screens will stop the first call, but if you dial twice,

[06:36] you'll get through. Number two is that the time to contact was too slow. So lead would come in

[06:43] and they would just sit there for 30 minutes, 60 minutes. And now two hours, three hours.

[06:48] Right? And they weren't getting contacted. It's like, what did this person do? They're like,

[06:50] oh, I'd like to find out more information. Nothing. And the third thing is that they didn't

[06:54] have the right time to set appointments and they weren't nurturing correctly. So we go same day next

[06:58] day. I'm just giving you some secrets. And they didn't have morning of nurture meeting. If you

[07:03] have an appointment today and you book this appointment three days ago, if I don't remind you that

[07:07] day that you have an appointment, the likelihood that you show is lower. And so these are the problems that

[07:11] they have. No double dial, slow speed to contact, and they did have any morning of nurture. But wait,

[07:16] there's more. The second problem they had were opportunity for improvement,

[07:20] was that they had a low close rate. And this is based on our benchmark. I would normally give you a

[07:24] KPI, but it has so many different variables in terms of what percentage close rate is. Because

[07:28] if you're selling in person, for example, for a low ticket thing, you might be able to sell 80%

[07:33] plus people walk in the door. On the flip side, if you're selling an investment opportunity over the phone

[07:38] on, you know, a first or second contact, you might sell 5%. But for this particular type of cell

[07:43] that they had, which was a two-call close for like, I would say a mid-priced consumer service.

[07:47] In my opinion, they should have been about 40%. So 40% is what I wanted them to be at.

[07:51] And then current was 27%. So this is where they were. This is where we wanted them to be. And again,

[07:57] for context here, this is about a 50% improvement. So problem number one is that they had service

[08:01] level discovery. If you're not familiar with that terminology, in a cell script, there's different

[08:05] kind of phases that you go through in a conversation. And the opening part is often a little bit of

[08:09] rapport, and then right after that you get into discovery. And discovery is where you're discovering

[08:13] what the problem is that the person is going through. You're trying to understand why they are

[08:17] where they are, why they're on the phone with you, why they decided to take time out of the

[08:20] day, why this problem is important to them, what they've tried in the past, etc, etc. Right? This is

[08:24] the discovery. This gives you all the ammunition that you're going to use at the end of the sale to close

[08:29] it. So the way that they were doing it was simply saying, how much money do you want to make? Just asking

[08:33] the one question, which is the big obvious question. It's surface level. But the big thing that you always

[08:37] want to ask when you're selling is intention. Why do they want this? Like, what changes as a result

[08:42] of this? How will your life look different? What can you not do now that you would be able to do as a

[08:46] result of this change? Who else in that in your life with that effect? Why does that matter to you?

[08:50] Right? And so these are all why questions, and it's to dig up their intentions. Because if you can

[08:55] understand why someone's there, it's much easier to get them to agree, to getting them there.

[09:00] Right? But if you don't know that someone's trying to, let's say, replace their income,

[09:04] versus quit their job, versus just have side hustle money, those are very different intentions.

[09:10] If I want to talk to side hustle money, I'm probably not going to be like, this is going to

[09:13] take a ton of time on the flip side if someone's like, I hate my job. I just want to do something

[09:18] that's not this, then I might talk about what the day-to-day looks like in this scenario and

[09:23] ask them if that sounds better to them. So if you think about sales process, what they were doing

[09:29] is they were asking questions that were here, surface level. But this is where all the meat is.

[09:35] And that's where all the money is, is the questions that are below the surface. Is understanding

[09:38] why someone's even doing this to be end with? You know that iceberg. Killer iceberg. And so the second

[09:43] issue is that they had a lot of objections coming up on the call. I'll say objections, but I also

[09:47] mean obstacles for those of you who are sales, sales sensees. Objections happen after you talk about

[09:52] the number, obstacles happen before you talk about the number. If you come on the phone and I say,

[09:56] hey, why are you here? And you're like, I just want to find out more information. That's actually

[09:58] an obstacle. Like you already have to confront that because like, no, you're not hopping on phone

[10:01] calls on you trying to find information. We'll probably try to solve. And then they're like, well,

[10:05] and then you get into it. Right? But if you don't address that upfront, it'll blow up on you in the

[10:09] close. So objections and obstacles is what they were encountering a lot of. And part of that

[10:12] it because they're discovery was wrong. Right? They were talking to a service level. So then lots of

[10:16] shit was blowing up on them in the close. Common objections that happen after you present price is,

[10:21] uh, this is too much. I need to think about it. I have to talk to my spouse. I'm not sure if this is

[10:25] for me. I'd like to get more data. Can you send me a brochure? Like, these are all just the make

[10:29] believe things that people will say in order to not buy from you. Interestingly, a lot of times,

[10:33] if you stay in the surface level, they'll even give you what we call smokescreen. So basically,

[10:37] like, they'll just come up with a reason that they're not going to do it. It's not even the reason.

[10:41] They just throw a smoke bomb up and they're like, I don't like English, you know, walk away, right?

[10:46] It's not thing to do with it. They just want to get off the phone. So those are the two issues that we

[10:48] had on the sales. And that was getting us to this 27% close rate. And what this looks like is lots of

[10:55] argumentation and like hard closing. And it's because the sales and positioned properly. And they were

[11:01] basically talking at people and not listing. If the sales person is talking more than the prospect

[11:06] in your sales, like these are a likely issues that are coming up. I'm going to give you two examples

[11:10] real quick to show you how important delivery of a message is. So if I say I have to think about it,

[11:16] and I say, oh, what do your main concerns? What are the main variables that you're considering?

[11:20] You're not thinking, wow, this guy's a douchebag. I sound like I just genuinely want to know.

[11:25] I call it childlike curiosity. I always cue it by tilting my head. But I'm like, huh, what are the

[11:29] main things? And I would increase my voice at the end there. And improperly train sales person

[11:33] might be like, well, what are the main concerns you have? And all of a sudden, that sounds like a very

[11:36] different thing. So they're saying the script, but they're not, but the prospect isn't here in the same

[11:40] message. And these are little details that actually can make a huge difference in ultimately how you close.

[11:44] There's a lot of things in tone, but I'll just say, one is how you raise your lower voice. And the

[11:48] second is where you choose to emphasize. If I say, I didn't say he hit his wife. If I say like that,

[11:54] I have neutral tone. If I say, I didn't say he hit his wife, then it's like, I'm not saying that.

[11:59] I didn't say he hit his wife is now saying that like, those weren't my words. I didn't say he

[12:03] hit his wife. He's the one to question. I didn't say he hit his wife. It means like he might

[12:07] did on something else, but he did something to his wife. I didn't say he hit his wife. It could have

[12:11] been somebody else's. I didn't say he hit his wife. It might have been his kid. Right? And so it's the same

[12:15] sentence, but simply emphasizing different parts of it, communicate different things. And so the tone

[12:20] and emphasis create a altogether package of how we communicate. And for them, their tonality was way

[12:25] off as a team because they were missing the first five minutes of discovering and setting the

[12:29] frame properly. And so I'll give you the last set of problems, opportunities for improvement.

[12:33] And then we'll dive into what we did to solve them and what happened. Sales problem three,

[12:36] opportunity for improvement. People in orc structure issues. So issue number one is that CEO was the sales

[12:45] manager. And that was because he was the best closer. He had a significantly higher close rate

[12:50] than the rest of the team, but he wasn't a very good sales manager. Even though he was a good

[12:55] closer, by the way, that's one of the main issues that a lot of sales teams have. They promote

[12:58] their best closer as a sales manager. And oftentimes those are two very different skills. And we could

[13:02] see this because the churn on their sales team was through the roof. Just to be clear, like they were

[13:07] a group of young founders. It's not uncommon. It's actually probably very common because usually

[13:12] when you start a business, learning how to promote and sell the product is usually the job of

[13:15] the founders. Like how do I get people to want to buy the thing? And so they end up getting the most

[13:19] reps early on. And also understanding the prospect better than just about anyone. And so one of the

[13:23] big things, you guys are a little mini sales lesson today, is that companies will over-educate on the

[13:27] product and under-educate on the prospect. The first thing that you should be educating your sales

[13:31] stuff on is who we're talking to more than what we're selling. Because for me, if I know someone

[13:36] deep in their core, what their intentions are, I can tell them anything. I know someone inside and

[13:40] now, and then someone says, sell this thing. And I know nothing about it. I could probably get

[13:44] them to buy. On the flip side, I know everything about this thing and I don't know who I'm talking

[13:48] to. Talk to a child, a man, a woman, old, young, different language. And so a lot of people

[13:52] talk like, hey, sell me this pen. When in reality, what we want to do is like talk to John, the majority

[13:57] of good sales trainers who try to do that gimmick. What they want the person to do is ask them a question.

[14:03] It actually has nothing to do with the pen. And so if they say, sell me this pen, what you do is you

[14:06] take the pen and you put it in your pocket and you say, how's it going? We'll brush in today,

[14:11] right? Because I got to go from where they're at to wanting a pen, I'm not going to just be like,

[14:15] hey, buy this pen. Give me money. Like it doesn't work that way. But that salesman did. So the second

[14:19] issue was the setting team expectations. One of the benefits of working with someone has more experience

[14:23] is that we know what the benchmark should be. And so a lot of times we can reset someone's minimum

[14:28] standard. And they're like, well, they're setting two a day where like they should all be minimum

[14:32] setting three. And that sounds tiny, but again, two to three is a 50% increase in sets. And that's

[14:37] across the whole team. So that means a lot of productivity. But if you set the bar low, people will just

[14:42] naturally shrink down to that level. All right. So you understand the problems? And here is the data.

[14:46] This is before they'd a low-shower rate issue, they'd low-closed rate and multiple issues around that.

[14:50] And they'd people in organizational issues. Don't you have a pause real quick in the video in the

[14:54] comments, do you like, what would you do? How would you attack these issue if this was your business?

[14:58] And then I'll tell you what we did. Now, there's two elements of solutions.

[15:05] Element one is, what would you do to attempt to solve the problem? And the second is,

[15:09] which one do we do in order? The third problem, that was actually the first thing we decided to fix.

[15:13] We said we hired a sales director. The reason for that was because the CEO was overly involved,

[15:17] he was mock-remandaging, he wasn't a good manager, and he also wasn't doing CEO stuff. And so we

[15:21] had to hire an experienced sales director who in this instance had been a sales trainer for a similar

[15:25] type of sale and a consumer good. This guy ended up being exceptional in being able to implement

[15:30] the rest of the changes that we outlined. So this was in terms of order of importance. I think if we

[15:34] hadn't done this and had tried to do the rest of them, it would have fallen flat. This is like one of the

[15:38] most common errors that business owners and founders make is that they see the what and not the

[15:43] who. Or they focus on the how and not the who. And if you have the same problem that is required,

[15:48] multiple quarters in a row, in the same department underneath of the same who, it might not be a

[15:53] what issue, it might be a who issue. One of the reasons having experience is helpful is because

[15:58] you know what it looks like when it's right. Some of the biggest costs in the business are hiring

[16:02] incorrectly. You waste the time trying to find them, you waste the time onboarding them and training them.

[16:06] And then you waste the time of all the time it takes you to figure out that they're not the right fit.

[16:10] And all the loss growth that you would have had to then start that process over again, that's tough.

[16:15] But a lot of businesses have to do with that, which is why picking personnel is so important.

[16:18] With this instance, we looked at culture fit, which is like, do we think that this caliphid in,

[16:22] which we usually the founders picked out part out like, hey, does this guy fit in cool? And then we're

[16:25] going to hardcore drill on usually experience and tax going knowledge. And so we have such a matter of

[16:30] experts at Holtco, media buying, CROW experts, sales experts, finance, etc. And we will then do

[16:36] taxical interviews. We talked about earlier, you can know that someone is good based on the quality

[16:41] and quantity of the data that they collect. I would ask somebody, what data do you plan on collecting

[16:45] and how do you plan on fixing those things? Based on how vague they are and how high level they go

[16:49] in terms of their solutions, it'll tell you how nuanced they can be in their thinking and ultimately

[16:53] executing solutions. Sales director specifically, in my experience, when I have guys who are like,

[16:59] I just want to build up people, I want to give these guys skills and they marry that with like

[17:03] in these are the metrics that I track to know X, Y, and Z. That's a good sales director. The next thing we

[17:07] decided to solve boom was fixing the ad targeting. And the reason we did the sales director first was

[17:13] because we're like, well, how do we know if anything else is going to happen afterwards if we fix this?

[17:17] So what we ended up doing here, it turns out is that we also had another personnel issue. The media

[17:21] buyer, I was asleep at the wheel, they were optimizing around the wrong stuff, they were trying

[17:25] to split their attention and start their own side us whole. It was clear that they were negligent.

[17:28] They actually were doing the right thing and then they stopped doing the right thing and it was

[17:32] clear that that type of behavior the founders felt was not going to correct itself. So they let

[17:36] go of that person, hired a new person and boom, fixed the ad targeting problem. We were back to 25 or 35

[17:41] real people who loved their job. What did we fix next? Boom! We reduced the sales team. What? And we

[17:47] reset expectations for the setting team. What we looked at is sales team utilization. If we know that

[17:50] guys can take 10 sales a day and they're actually only taking 4, then we have too many sales people.

[17:55] In this instance it gives you an opportunity to cut the fat for like a bit of shame and reward

[17:59] the people who are actually doing their jobs and closing well. If you cut the lowest percent of

[18:04] the team and you have utilization like you have space, you lose the lowest closing percentage,

[18:09] people and you gain more. Closes just by shifting the closing rate overall of the team. When you make

[18:14] those changes in my experience, sales people get into a rhythm. If you don't take enough sales calls,

[18:20] you're too desperate to close the deal and then you start being too hard and not listening

[18:25] enough because it's about you, not them. When sales people have more and more consults, they

[18:28] sell from the back of their heel, they're open-minded, they're asking questions that are feeling good

[18:32] and they get in a rhythm. The setting team, we both downsized and increased expectations.

[18:37] How are they? They're all these sales increase by having fewer people. We had better people. That's

[18:40] how. And that also helps recreate the culture of the team so that we can have a new standard set of

[18:46] because there's nothing that demotivates a high performer like a local performer who's still on the

[18:50] team. And so we went from two to four in terms of our expectation per day for the team in terms of

[18:55] sets. Sales fix, Numerano Quattrole, I'm missing all my columns up now. It's going to have to deal with it.

[19:01] We promoted one setter to lead nurture specialists. I was saying earlier that they were multitasking.

[19:05] So they're doing some setting and they're doing some lead nurture. And that gets really hard for

[19:09] a team of six guys to split those things. We took one of the setters who was really good and made

[19:13] that person the lead nurture specialist was basically acted as the bridge for both the setting team

[19:18] and the closing team. To basically coordinate and remind the people of their points. And we equip

[19:21] that lead nurture specialist with one of our checklist for what that role needs to do to get the most

[19:26] people to show up. And I'm not going to give you all because of long checklist. I'll give you two

[19:29] quick examples. One of them is doing a three-way intro once you have the set of appointment between

[19:33] the setter and the closer and doing it via iPhone if you can. Because now you have a known person

[19:38] and an unknown person and a person that bridges the two. They might know show on Johnny over here,

[19:42] but not on the guy that they just spoke with. And so the idea is how can I bridge that gap and kind of

[19:47] make the association for them, add some trust. The other thing is that the closers,

[19:50] morning up, would remind them with either a voice memo or a video text personalized to them. He

[19:56] like, hey, John, really excited for our appointment today. I saw your profile XYZ personalized to you.

[20:01] Really pumped for I think I'm going to put a help you out. So that's just a couple of things

[20:03] that we have on that list that we had them implement and all do consistently. And sales team fixed number five

[20:08] boom is we optimized the sales scripts. I said earlier that the discovery was too

[20:13] surface level. So we rescripted the discovery. Make sure we were asking deeper,

[20:16] more meaningful questions. And a part of that is also bringing some of the objections to the front.

[20:20] It's much easier and this is the terminology that our team uses, which is killing zombies.

[20:25] Right? It's a lot easier to kill zombie once far away than when it's on top of you.

[20:28] If somebody's trying to bring up a zombie in the close, another way of saying it is like,

[20:32] you want to diffuse the bomb before it goes off in the closing your face. So we solved the problem

[20:36] before we bring it up. Now, this is actually something that we added to this part of the script,

[20:39] which is prior to the appointment. We say, hey, is there anyone else who'd be required to make

[20:43] a decision about this thing? If they say yes, then you say, cool, well, let's push back the

[20:47] appointment. Let's get that person on that way. You have all the decision makers present. So these

[20:51] are just little things, but like little 1% improvements over and over, over again, is what yield

[20:56] these 50% boosts. And the third main change we did was that we drilled the team on looping. And

[21:01] looping is just a sales terminology for basically when you encounter an objection, handling the

[21:08] objection, and then asking again, handle the objection, ask again. Right? Because a lot of sales people

[21:13] are afraid to ask if someone says no, and they don't want to ask again. Right? And I can tell you this

[21:16] is that the number of sales you make is direct proportional to how many times you ask. There's ways

[21:20] to do it wrong, and there's ways to do it right. The idea is that you should be able to resolve

[21:23] the concern. Right? So if someone says, I need to think about it, and you say, well, what do

[21:27] your main concerns? And they say, well, it seems really complicated. You say, oh, what parts

[21:31] specifically feels more complicated? They're like, it's the whole tech thing. And we're like, oh,

[21:34] we also have a vendor that can actually fill that in. I think it's a couple of bucks extra,

[21:38] but like we can just handle that for you. Does that solve the problem? And they're like, oh, okay.

[21:42] So you guys, you guys just handed that one part of it. Like, yeah, we handed that part of for you.

[21:46] Cool. Now, this is where the salesman says, great. You want to move forward? Do you have your

[21:49] idea on you? Hey, well, card you want to, like, you can just make the ask right after that. And so

[21:53] then at that point, you might say, ready to move forward then? And they might say, this feels like

[21:56] a fast decision. And it's like, oh, well, what makes it fast? How long you've been thinking about this?

[22:01] And they're like, why, I mean, I just made you. And you say, well, how long have you wanted to solve

[22:04] this problem? And then they would say, well, I mean a long time. And it's like, well, then it's

[22:07] not like a fast decision at all. If something's already made that decision a long time,

[22:10] I really wanted to change. Now, we're just acting on it. So now do you want to move forward? Right?

[22:13] It's heap looping and continuing to resolve the concern, ask you again, resolve the concern, ask you

[22:17] get drum roll, please. What happened in the real world? So let's go to the data. All right. So

[22:25] in our first column, we had 49% show rates after we implemented sales fixed two, fixing the ad

[22:30] targeting. Sales fixed four, perverted one lead center to lead nurse specialist. And sales fixed three

[22:35] reduced the team size and reset expectations. Survey says, be at a 70% boost, which is almost exactly

[22:43] the KPI. And that's because when you do things that work, they work. So that was a 40% improvement

[22:48] in sales. And to be clear, this was just over two months. All right. So some of these changes can

[22:52] happen real quick if you know what you're doing. The second change we have is our offer rate. And so

[22:56] here's what happened. Survey says 80% we actually offered just about the same amount of people.

[23:01] Realistically, what they were doing is offering people who weren't qualified because the sales

[23:04] seem wanted to eat. And I get that. Like, there's a human component here. They were offering

[23:07] people who were not qualified. The deal because they needed commissions, right? Which is what we

[23:10] were trying to fix with the targeted. Close rates. We went from 27% and 60 days later we were at

[23:16] 41%. So 1% above our benchmark. All right. This is a 50% improvement in sales. So 40 and 50.

[23:23] Because they are next up, we have percentage of cash collected. A really good metric for knowing

[23:27] how strong the sales team in it. And this is especially important for that early discovery portion.

[23:31] And how good they are at looping and closing. Because the deeper you get the discovery,

[23:36] the more convicted, the buyer will be about the solution. And the more likely they are to pay

[23:41] up front as a measure of their conviction in the solution. The survey says we went from 47 to 82%.

[23:48] So we almost doubled the amount of cash that we were collecting up front per sale in 60 days.

[23:54] We had a 40% improvement and we had a 50% improvement. And we had a almost doubling of cash collected.

[23:59] So if we almost doubled the amount of sales that happened and we almost doubled the cash up front

[24:06] collected, what do we do to the cash for the business? Forexed it. Much more enticing. After we added

[24:11] all these four changes together and we waited 60 days, what happened? Survey says we went from 56

[24:17] to 93 sales a month. And that was just from a few of these fixes on one particular part of the

[24:24] organization. And you might think after we made all of these changes that we're done, we ride off

[24:28] into the sunset. But wait, there's more. There were even more problems in the business on the product

[24:32] and customer success side. We'll get to in the next video.

## Full Transcript
[00:00] This is Cody, you are the custom trophy and Pac's business doing $1.7 million per year.

[00:04] It's a family business that's been passed down for four generations.

[00:07] But the business only makes 6.4% profit, barely a hundred thousand dollars.

[00:11] And after taxes, it's even less.

[00:12] So if Cody wants to pass this down to his kids one day, they're not going to hear it

[00:15] of thriving business, just a low paying job with long hours and a lot of risk.

[00:19] I'm Alex Ramazzi, I own Acquis as a knock-on, a portfolio of companies that generates hundreds of millions of year.

[00:23] And I also sold and built a physical products company,

[00:26] some bare familiar with some of the problems that Cody's dealing with.

[00:28] My suspicion is the key things that are going to catava his business are.

[00:32] Fixing his pricing, scaling is advertising, and figuring out how to generate

[00:35] repeat business from his existing customers.

[00:37] And so first, I'm going to dive deep into the business, then we're going to break down all the tactics

[00:41] that he and you can use to scale your business.

[00:44] What's up?

[00:45] What's up?

[00:46] We're doing.

[00:47] Let's talk about trophies.

[00:48] Yeah.

[00:49] So my name's Cody.

[00:50] Cody Shilsson, I own trophy outlet.

[00:51] We last year we did about $1.7 million in revenue, mainly trophies and awards personalization.

[00:57] About $110,000 in profit, 6.4% net margin.

[01:01] And I'm third generation owner of the company with a business from almost 40 years.

[01:04] That's amazing.

[01:05] So when I saw his low profit margins, I immediately think, is it a per unit thing that he doesn't have good economics on which get indicate a pricing issue?

[01:12] Or he just needs to sell way more volume based on his fixed cost.

[01:15] And so anyways, I needed to dig to find out more.

[01:17] So what's the goal?

[01:18] Yeah.

[01:19] The goal is 3.5 million in revenue.

[01:21] I really want to double revenue.

[01:23] The reason this goal is so important to me is it's the legacy to me.

[01:26] Black and creative business that's profitable and can sustain itself.

[01:29] That's a fourth generation, maybe fifth generation business.

[01:32] So who do you hope?

[01:33] So mainly coaches, event organizers, as well as businesses and organizations, as well as

[01:38] get gift purchases.

[01:39] Yeah.

[01:40] I got that far.

[01:41] Yeah.

[01:42] Okay.

[01:43] So how do you help them?

[01:44] And that's so we have a free and gravy.

[01:45] Fast shipping, everything we do is personalize to the business or the individual.

[01:48] They go to the website to our platform, purchase, you know, add the personalization info,

[01:53] their logo, things like that.

[01:54] And then we fill it.

[01:55] If it's needs approval, anything like that.

[01:58] But most things ship in one to two days.

[01:59] No.

[02:00] That's weird.

[02:01] How do you make money?

[02:02] How do we make money?

[02:03] All right.

[02:04] So on our website, direct on our website, most of our products kind of land in the $150

[02:08] price point.

[02:09] We have products that range from $4 dollars.

[02:11] So all we have to $900.

[02:12] So that's a wide range.

[02:14] Most popular item is a $4.56 foot trophy, which kind of lands about $89 to $130.

[02:19] Okay.

[02:20] And then dashplacks, which are like little car show, things that guys collect when they

[02:24] go to car shows.

[02:25] Oh, interesting.

[02:26] So it's kind of a sell for $1.25.

[02:27] We sold minimum 50, but we sold a thousand.

[02:29] I've never even heard of that.

[02:31] So how do you get customers?

[02:33] Trovial started in 1985.

[02:34] Oh, you know, this is our 40th year.

[02:36] And we launched our Etsy business in 2019.

[02:40] And we had about $70,000 the first year.

[02:43] And then in 2013, our 2023, we launched Amazon and did about $300,000.

[02:47] And then last year, we launched TikTok Shop.

[02:50] And we did about $270,000 in revenue.

[02:53] But 250 of that came in December alone.

[02:56] So we had a video go viral with 20 plus million views.

[02:59] That's always, so it went crazy.

[03:00] So 250 of that came in one month.

[03:02] So that was kind of fun.

[03:03] You guys are blowing these up on the TikTok Shop.

[03:05] And since I'm a little bit of a little bit of a charge, I got to be here today to make

[03:07] sure these all get shipped out.

[03:09] If you can keep it going, maybe next week I'll make the fuck fuck come in and they can take

[03:13] care of it.

[03:14] Have a good Sunday.

[03:15] And you sold those.

[03:16] We sold those.

[03:17] Yeah.

[03:18] And not quite family-proof.

[03:19] Yeah.

[03:20] And you were able to fulfill on the amount of orders that came in?

[03:22] Yeah.

[03:23] Yeah.

[03:24] We did about 13,000 of those.

[03:25] So do you have any factories that are?

[03:27] Yeah.

[03:28] Yeah.

[03:29] We produce everything and how it is.

[03:30] So we can grab and go on it.

[03:31] So what I found really interesting about these gifts is they're very shareable.

[03:34] Both in that, like, they're funny and you could share like a video about it on social

[03:37] media.

[03:38] But also, because whenever you gift, you literally send a product to somebody else.

[03:43] And so I'm trying to think through other ways that we can harness that or at least lubricate

[03:46] that process.

[03:47] So we can get more shares, more referrals, more return customers.

[03:50] Cross four different channels.

[03:52] Most of our clients come through online and internal and is through SEO and Facebook ads.

[03:56] Uh-huh.

[03:57] We just launched Facebook ads in Meta, October, November with an agency.

[04:01] Yeah.

[04:02] And then Amazon has been about $7,100 a month between the agency and ads and then Etsy.

[04:06] And then TikTok still kind of figured that one out a little bit of a little bit of a sense

[04:08] that all happened in December.

[04:09] But about $2,000 so far.

[04:11] God.

[04:12] And ads there.

[04:13] So the channels get super overwhelming because we're spending so much money on ads and

[04:16] agencies and what's working and what's not working.

[04:19] And also just getting clarity from Alex on that piece alone is super helpful.

[04:23] Well, how many customers have you sold so far?

[04:26] In 2024, uh, direct on our website and I have this broken out per channel in a couple slides.

[04:31] But total visits is about 90,000 visits to our site, about 2,500 orders.

[04:35] There's just a 2.8% conversion rate and about 780 one products.

[04:39] So that's a lot of products.

[04:41] Is everything, everything made to order?

[04:42] Yeah.

[04:43] Okay.

[04:44] So it's not like you're carrying a ton of inventory.

[04:46] You've got raw materials.

[04:47] Raw materials.

[04:48] Most of it we bring in from our vendors.

[04:49] Oh, yeah.

[04:50] We kind of as we need it.

[04:51] We don't carry a huge huge.

[04:52] So when I asked, is it made to order?

[04:54] That was an important question because inventory can be one of the biggest costs in a business.

[04:58] And especially with somebody that had that many skews, I got really worried about it.

[05:02] But because it's made to order, then it's really just like optionality.

[05:05] So then you just look at operational efficiency of like how difficult it is to make all these

[05:08] different things.

[05:09] And I bring this just from my own physical product experience with prestige labs.

[05:13] There's my self-improvement company.

[05:14] You know, you've got to be looking out, you know, eight weeks, 12 weeks, sometimes,

[05:17] 16 weeks ahead of time to make your orders.

[05:19] And that can be a huge cash drag on the business.

[05:22] What's been holding you back?

[05:23] So I think it's marketing.

[05:24] We've got fulfillment-wise.

[05:26] We've proved that in December, we can handle about double fulfillment.

[05:29] I mean, with limited complexity.

[05:30] So I just need more people to the site, more people behind.

[05:34] And we can fill it.

[05:35] And also we're very proud of heavy with large amounts.

[05:37] So we're going on the margin piece getting profits up a little bit.

[05:41] Do you want to sell this company eventually or like,

[05:44] would you have a really handy thoughts of selling?

[05:46] But I want to treat business that is sellable.

[05:49] Yeah.

[05:49] So I have the option.

[05:50] If I want to sell it, but I would love for it to be a fourth generation business someday.

[05:53] All right.

[05:53] So how many locations do you have?

[05:54] Because you're brick and mortar, correct?

[05:56] Well, we have one retail location now.

[05:58] We have two locations total.

[06:00] We close the other retail location down in this production only facility.

[06:03] Okay.

[06:04] So the other retail location, you know, does maybe $150,000 in revenue, how do that location?

[06:10] So just like walk in traffic and whatever.

[06:12] Yeah, walk in emails though.

[06:13] Does it break you?

[06:13] And I really.

[06:14] Okay.

[06:15] So you have a manufacturer of facility in one retail?

[06:17] Yeah.

[06:18] Which also does some manufacturing as well.

[06:20] Is there any downside to just like consolidating to the one?

[06:23] It's something that we're actually looking at.

[06:24] Okay.

[06:25] And go more e-commerce and kind of cut in the retail business.

[06:29] The fact that he has two physical locations is a bit odd given the nature of retail in

[06:35] 2025.

[06:36] The vast majority, you know, and it's continuing to grow as people are doing online sales.

[06:40] And especially with the amount of customization that he offers, it makes more and more sense

[06:42] for him to sell to a national base, which he's already doing.

[06:45] So these are the issues.

[06:47] What are the metrics you got?

[06:48] So numbers, 1.72 million in revenue, about 110,000 in profit, 40% gross margin.

[06:53] What if expect to gross margins to be higher for this business?

[06:56] And it varies per product.

[06:57] Who are tons of, you know, like certain acrylics?

[07:00] I was expecting like, you know, one dollar, like, you buy these trophies and they're like,

[07:03] you know, a dollar and you're like, there's no, like, this is made of rubber.

[07:06] You know, but, yeah.

[07:07] Okay.

[07:08] So certain, it is very widely between the products and the platform and stuff like that.

[07:12] But in that margin, about 6.4% LTV, 133, and then KAC, 1190, LTV to KAC, right

[07:19] show, 11 to 1.

[07:20] And that's blended across all channels.

[07:22] How do you come up with price?

[07:23] Guessing, for the most part, or I'll look at some competitors, but there's not really good

[07:28] apples to apples comparison necessarily.

[07:30] Do you like the cost plus or like, yeah.

[07:33] So I have massive spreadsheets of all of our costs, yeah.

[07:36] It's things like that, factored labor, and then I just kind of add my margins to it.

[07:40] Mmm, you know.

[07:41] That's what we've been trying to bring that up over the years.

[07:43] Yeah.

[07:44] When Alex has pointed out the margins and they're really low and I agree, I just don't quite

[07:48] know what to do yet, but it's a problem we've been looking to solve for quite a while.

[07:52] What percentage of customers are our new versus return?

[07:56] I don't have a percentage for that.

[07:59] Got.

[08:00] Got.

[08:01] I would say probably.

[08:02] Just on our website and internal customers probably 50, 50.

[08:06] Okay, because it's pretty old business.

[08:08] So you think they'd be a decent amount of return?

[08:10] Yeah, a lot of our business.

[08:11] I mean, $530 at dollars and revenue comes just internal.

[08:14] So emails calls, things like that, most of that is repeat business.

[08:19] In fact, that he's getting $500,000 per year and return customers, I'm going to be poking

[08:24] on that to see if there's any un-mixed opportunities there that we can squeeze the hell out

[08:28] of that and maybe double triple that if we do it on purpose rather than on accident.

[08:32] Do you very high fixed costs in this business?

[08:34] Not too bad now.

[08:36] Because if you have half the business comes in from the word of mouth, I would expect the

[08:39] margins to be higher, like the net margins.

[08:42] I think if this is big hypothetical, it's like if we got rid of all of the new customers.

[08:47] And we just sold the 500 and something thousand from return customers.

[08:51] That should be free customer acquisition and then we should make money.

[08:57] Right?

[08:58] But looking at this, I would be like, I don't know if we would make money.

[09:00] In real quick, for those of you who are new, fixed costs are basically costs that stay

[09:04] in the business independent of how much you sell.

[09:06] So rent is a fixed cost.

[09:08] Some kinds of laborers fix costs, or internet connections fix costs.

[09:11] These things you have to pay every single month.

[09:12] Verbal costs are cost as a result of sales.

[09:15] So if I sell more products, I have more cost of goods, right?

[09:17] I have more maybe labor in creating this product.

[09:20] The costs basically work by their name.

[09:21] They're fixed or they're variable.

[09:23] Yeah.

[09:24] Our costs are pretty high.

[09:25] I do think there's a pricing issue.

[09:26] Yeah.

[09:27] Which will good, so.

[09:28] Okay.

[09:29] So if you tax pretty strong.

[09:30] Yeah, it's pretty decent.

[09:32] And I learned that a few months ago coming here at first time.

[09:35] So it's an increase in.

[09:36] And that's not lifetime revenue.

[09:37] That's life time.

[09:38] That's gross profit.

[09:39] That's profit.

[09:40] Okay.

[09:41] Interesting.

[09:42] So what I'm zeroing in on is, is there pricing issue and to what extent is there one?

[09:47] Because this is a great limit, this test.

[09:48] Because if you get free sales, which return customers are free sales, the cost you nothing,

[09:52] somebody else tells them about it and then they come in.

[09:54] Right?

[09:55] You should be the most profitable on those customers.

[09:57] And so if that level of volume, you're still not profitable, either of high fixed

[10:01] costs, which are asked in the beginning, or we might dingling a link, have a pricing issue.

[10:06] It's 40-year-old business.

[10:07] Who is in charge of pricing that helps out like you took it over from your, I guess he took

[10:10] it from his old men.

[10:11] So like your third generation.

[10:12] Yeah.

[10:13] Yeah, my parents ran the company.

[10:14] They didn't have a price structure.

[10:15] They just kind of.

[10:16] Yeah.

[10:17] You know, then on an annual basis, do you review all prices every year?

[10:21] Yep.

[10:22] Just said about February, March of every year is when our vendors were age prices.

[10:25] So then I adjust accordingly.

[10:27] God, was there margins the same when they were running it?

[10:30] Much less.

[10:31] Lower.

[10:32] Oh, wait, like not making money at all.

[10:34] So my mom was running it.

[10:36] I remember very distinctly looking at a product and the cobs on that were like $50 in

[10:41] your sell-in for like $45.

[10:43] I mean, this is not working.

[10:45] Yeah.

[10:46] So I immediately raised prices.

[10:47] Yeah.

[10:48] Double the moment.

[10:49] Okay.

[10:50] And constantly just continually up.

[10:51] Yeah, I think I have some ideas there.

[10:52] All right.

[10:53] What else you got?

[10:54] So direct traffic and internal is our biggest 13 to 1.

[10:59] LTV to Kak ratio.

[11:01] Amazon, our highest conversion rate.

[11:03] And 9.6% conversion.

[11:05] And of course the blended 11 to 11 LTV to Kak.

[11:08] So interesting.

[11:09] Hey, so you don't have LTV venture to take talk?

[11:11] No, couldn't quite figure that out.

[11:13] Yeah.

[11:14] Okay.

[11:15] The easiest way to do it is just go to a revenue divide by its own number of customers.

[11:19] Okay.

[11:20] So you're 262.

[11:21] Do you want to meet the customers yourself?

[11:22] I think that's about almost 13.

[11:23] Almost 13,000.

[11:25] Michael, 262 divided by 13,000.

[11:27] So let's 262 divided 13.

[11:30] Yeah.

[11:31] Clean.

[11:32] Okay.

[11:33] So 20 bucks.

[11:34] That's on my right.

[11:35] Yeah.

[11:36] So let's say I've drawn a value.

[11:37] We don't know how many times they've purchased.

[11:39] Right.

[11:40] Which is one.

[11:41] That's, you know.

[11:42] So A.O.V.

[11:43] is typically used in e-commerce or retail, which is average order value.

[11:47] He's saying that he has a low average order value on TikTok.

[11:50] But it's very different for different customers or different channels.

[11:53] And so it's valuable to understand what the A.O.V. is buy customer and buy channel.

[11:57] Now this is a little bit of data, but at the end of the day, if you want to win, you got to know your numbers.

[12:00] If we're thinking about the business, zooming all the way out, we have the cost of getting a customer.

[12:03] And then we have what customers are worth.

[12:05] And the first transaction you get is going to be the average cart, right?

[12:09] The first transaction.

[12:10] But then after that, you want repeat purchases as well.

[12:12] And so I'm going to probably be pruning into like, okay, how many people buy again?

[12:15] Or is it a one-time purchase and things like that?

[12:17] So, uh.

[12:18] The bonus for you is not been falling your content for quite a while.

[12:21] And, you know, obviously, you have the caps of God.

[12:26] So, of course.

[12:27] The caps go.

[12:28] I'm going to order.

[12:29] I'm going to order.

[12:30] I wish.

[12:32] Is it a cow?

[12:35] Is it a cow?

[12:36] Oh, it's a goat.

[12:37] Oh, it's a goat.

[12:38] For a second, I like, because I could have been a calf, like a little baby cow.

[12:41] I could have done that.

[12:42] So you got anything like that.

[12:43] This is great.

[12:44] There's one more top zone brother transaction.

[12:45] Is it really?

[12:46] Oh, that makes sense.

[12:47] That makes sense.

[12:48] It's a trendy thing.

[12:49] Well, thank you so much.

[12:50] I appreciate it.

[12:51] I will put it on my desk.

[12:52] And I'll show the way, like, this reminder of my calf excellence.

[12:55] Yes, and we actually have a gift for Leyla, also, which is in the back.

[12:59] Oh, is it?

[13:00] Is it for me to give you?

[13:01] It's like, I can get your husband's point.

[13:02] You can see my husband's point.

[13:03] You love this.

[13:04] Ah, I sure love this.

[13:06] This is great.

[13:08] I love this.

[13:09] I love these.

[13:10] These are really good.

[13:11] Yeah.

[13:12] So, you want to don't rub, no?

[13:13] Yep.

[13:14] God.

[13:15] What's this on here about you wanting to buy another business?

[13:16] Yes, so I had a business reach out to me.

[13:19] It's in the same industry in the St. Louis market that we're already in.

[13:22] So, he's getting old once a retire.

[13:25] So, what's he doing in road doing profit?

[13:27] He does about double what we do about 3 million in revenue.

[13:30] Don't know profit, Shader.

[13:31] We haven't even got to that point yet.

[13:33] But he's got it.

[13:35] From what I understand, he does pretty decent on his margin.

[13:38] He does a lot more custom stuff, so which is a lot higher margin on some of that stuff.

[13:41] The biggest concern with him is 70% of his revenue comes through one customer.

[13:45] Yeah.

[13:46] So, that's a pretty big, uh, I wouldn't buy that.

[13:49] Wouldn't buy that.

[13:50] I would try and find out if I could, who the vendors were that he hasn't

[13:54] China for his connections for his raw materials.

[13:56] Yeah.

[13:57] So that I could try and use the vendors.

[13:59] That was actually one resource I thought was well, I could buy this and it's cheap enough.

[14:03] It's a monster is customer risk and especially if you have somebody retiring that one customer might be.

[14:08] So, at acquisition.com, we have a scorecard called the Value Acceleration method,

[14:12] which essentially how can you both maximize value and then also minimize risk, which ultimately makes a company more valuable.

[14:18] In this one, he says there's two big red flags here.

[14:22] First is you've got key men risk, which is when you have a small business, you've got a owner that's retiring oftentimes.

[14:27] They are key men in the business.

[14:29] They've been working for a many years.

[14:30] And there's so many things that they're unconsciously competent of.

[14:32] A unconsciously, you're doing to keep the wheels going and it's often not documented or at least well documented.

[14:37] So that's a big concern number one.

[14:39] But by far, the biggest concern number two is that 70% of the revenues coming from one customer.

[14:44] So if that customer leaves because maybe the guy retires and he has a relationship with them, then I'm so out on this deal.

[14:51] Now, the third thing here is we have to answer the question, why bother?

[14:55] Right, like why are we even doing this? What problem are we solving?

[14:58] Now, he did bring up that this guy has some better connections for raw materials, which can improve his margins,

[15:02] which I do think is valuable.

[15:03] But do I want to buy a business to get a connection?

[15:05] I'll zoom out from the back forward, which is like, what do we want to be when we grow up?

[15:09] Basically, this is going to become a media slash marketing business that monetizes through trophies.

[15:15] Or you can go to the B2B wholesale route, which is probably like outbound sales team that's calling wholesalers and whatnot.

[15:23] Yeah, from what it sounds like it sounds like you're better suited for the commerce, direct to consumer side.

[15:30] That's what it sounds like. I don't know, currently that's what we're at.

[15:33] Because I think you could do more than that.

[15:35] So, currently, it's just easier.

[15:38] But that just kind of came naturally. It wasn't anything we've purchased.

[15:41] Yeah, it was just really, but yeah, the majority of it's all you've accomplished.

[15:44] Okay, you might have one of the simpler plans that I have.

[15:49] Yeah, which is, I mean, simple doesn't mean bad.

[15:52] Simple is good. You know, if sometimes you have like 10 things to do, it's better to have three that move the new a lot.

[15:56] And I think you're kind of in that situation.

[15:58] There's three big things, but I think we'll, we'll once you come over here and then we'll, we'll net it out.

[16:02] So, Cody is actually at stage five product ties in the $100 million scaling roadmap.

[16:08] So, if you look at marketing, he needs to spend more on niche down marketing.

[16:12] And so, the issue here is that he has two different avatars and we have to get him to pick pick and commit.

[16:17] The nice thing is that I can probably tell you what the other problems he's going to be having at this level are

[16:21] And what he needs to do to graduate to get to the next level.

[16:24] We broke down the stages of scaling a business into 10 steps.

[16:27] And we did it across all eight functions of the business.

[16:30] So, product marketing sales, customer service, IT recruiting finance, NHR.

[16:33] And the nice thing is that business is behaving patterns.

[16:36] And so, if you want to know where you're at and what you need to do to get the next level,

[16:40] this scaling roadmap is absolutely free.

[16:42] And it comes personalized to you. So, we built this bot.

[16:44] You plug in your business information and we'll send it right over to you.

[16:47] Now, if you like the interaction that I'm having with Cody and you're like, man, I would love it if

[16:51] Acquisitor.com would take a look at my business and see if they could help me kind of move the pieces around and make it

[16:55] significantly more valuable. We run scaling workshops under our advisory practice throughout the year.

[17:00] And if you want that on the thinking page, you can schedule call, talk to my team and see if it's a fit.

[17:05] Otherwise, get the scaling roadmap. It's absolutely free and enjoy the rest of the video.

[17:09] What percentage of customers are gagg-gifts?

[17:12] So, that's the Amazon Etsy TikTok TikTok.

[17:15] That's all that.

[17:16] So, that's like, what's that?

[17:18] What do you want to do with Amazon?

[17:19] Yeah.

[17:20] Roughly.

[17:21] And that's kind of been the fastest growing since 2019.

[17:24] That's true.

[17:25] When we launch that, which is all under a different brand technically.

[17:28] Okay.

[17:29] We started a different brand back then because we don't want explicit vulgar to be under triopeal.

[17:33] Sure.

[17:34] You know, church moms and stuff get.

[17:35] Yeah.

[17:36] It's easy.

[17:37] Okay.

[17:38] With this business, like fundamentally, you just have, it's, you've traffic in a conversion page.

[17:42] Like, and then if you already have, let's call it, for right now, not a constraint on many facturing anything like that.

[17:48] The three big kind of levers that I want to go off on is no one.

[17:53] These consolidation, which instantly adds to profit.

[17:56] Yep.

[17:57] All right.

[17:58] Same, which also instantly adds to profit.

[17:59] Absolutely.

[18:00] And then media.

[18:01] These are the big ones.

[18:03] Okay.

[18:04] So, from a current solidation perspective, we have the skews, right?

[18:09] Yep.

[18:10] And then we also have the Ergonauter locations.

[18:12] And then we kind of have like model.

[18:14] So, like, in terms of like how and thinking through this.

[18:16] So, from a skews perspective, if you're not carrying that, like, normally, it'd be like we need to massively cut down on skews.

[18:22] But like, if you're not, if you're like this warehouse flow of stuff, and it's just like more options for people to purchase,

[18:26] I don't think we need to like get rid of anything.

[18:29] And a lot of the skews, too, it's the same product just maybe for the ball versus the smaller ones.

[18:34] Yeah.

[18:35] You know, they're similar product.

[18:36] Right.

[18:37] It's a, it's a goat trophy.

[18:38] And you just put a different plaque on it, and anything.

[18:40] That doesn't bug me.

[18:41] And if you're like, man, it's, it's super hard for my team to build all these different things that I'd be like, all right.

[18:45] Well, then we should, we should look at that.

[18:47] But if it, it doesn't seem like you're stressed on the manufacturing side.

[18:49] No.

[18:50] But that's where my skills that lies, too.

[18:51] Oh, God.

[18:52] Oh, God.

[18:53] How is operations?

[18:54] What am I good at?

[18:55] So the second is the brick and mortar.

[18:56] If you have this retail location, and it's basically breaking even or losing money, and that's not even the future of the business.

[19:00] Right.

[19:01] Then to me, I would say let's just save our 50,000 year in rent, and then just add that to the bottom one.

[19:06] Right.

[19:07] I feel like that would be a good idea, because I would increase profit by 50%.

[19:09] Yeah.

[19:10] Just like show.

[19:11] Pretty much interesting.

[19:12] Yeah.

[19:13] And also, there's just like the headache of like, it's this thing over here.

[19:15] Yeah.

[19:16] And you've got, and you probably just take the couple of good people from there, bringing them to

[19:19] bring them home.

[19:20] Right.

[19:21] Yeah.

[19:22] So that feels good.

[19:23] So the next one is model.

[19:24] This is arguably the most important decision that he has to make in this entire kind of interaction with me.

[19:30] Because this is the strategy or the vision of the business.

[19:33] Like, what kind of business do you want to be when you grow up?

[19:36] And I think a lot of entrepreneurs get stuck in no man's land, and they just can't decide.

[19:40] And so if you think about the definition of decide is it actually comes from Latin, which is decadera, which means to cut off.

[19:45] And which means we have to figure out what path we're going to cut off by making a decision.

[19:48] But like, if you wanted to have an exit of some kind, then the revenue retention is going to be a really important thing.

[19:53] If he just wants to make money and grow, then it would probably be faster for him to just go the consumer route,

[19:59] and simply arbitrage media and make the spread, which tons of people are doing right now.

[20:03] And I think we totally work for him.

[20:05] But what won't work is trying to pursue both masters and ultimately serve neither.

[20:09] So in some ways, you have two businesses.

[20:12] Let alone, like, if you were to, like, forget about the third one you're thinking about buying.

[20:15] Like, you already have two.

[20:16] And I'd rather have one.

[20:17] I'm not saying cut the one that you have.

[20:18] It's not going to see you for your own business.

[20:20] But like, it really have to make that decision.

[20:22] And that's actually not a media decision.

[20:24] It's a U decision.

[20:25] So if I'll say it the way that I think Leila loves framing opportunities.

[20:29] So I always think about upside and Javascript on upside.

[20:31] And so it's like, what problem would you rather solve?

[20:34] So in the gag gift path, the problem that you're going to have to solve is you're always going to have to find new, cheap forms of media.

[20:41] So it's going to be like, tick touch off is what it is today.

[20:44] So you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[20:45] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[20:46] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[20:47] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[20:48] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[20:50] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[20:52] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[20:53] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[20:54] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[20:55] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[20:56] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[20:57] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[20:58] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[20:59] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[21:00] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[21:01] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[21:02] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[21:03] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[21:05] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[21:07] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[21:08] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[21:09] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[21:11] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[21:12] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[21:13] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[21:14] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[21:15] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[21:18] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[21:19] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[21:21] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[21:23] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[21:25] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[21:27] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[21:29] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[21:31] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[21:33] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[21:35] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[21:37] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[21:39] And then you're going to have to do a lot of things.

[21:41] The life you want to live.

[21:43] That's.

[21:44] That's tough.

[21:45] Only because media for me has always been a hurdle.

[21:48] Okay.

[21:49] Someone locally great at it.

[21:50] Do you like it?

[21:51] Hmm.

[21:52] Okay.

[21:53] There.

[21:54] I will do it.

[21:55] Yeah.

[21:56] Yeah.

[21:57] But I don't know that I love it per se.

[21:59] It's a tough one.

[22:02] Yeah.

[22:03] I'm trying to think of it.

[22:05] Because if you wanted to hit 3 million next year, I was like, we could do 10 million

[22:08] next year.

[22:09] We're going to take all of our resources.

[22:10] We're going to go all in on TikTok, viral organic.

[22:13] And you're going to deploy everything into TikTok shop and get influences to do lives

[22:17] for you, showing all these funny gag gifts.

[22:19] Because the turf users are so built for shareability.

[22:23] Yeah.

[22:24] And so that's, I mean, 20 million views is a monster video.

[22:27] But I'll bet you you could probably get you probably crack off a million views all the time

[22:30] with these types of these types of things.

[22:31] Yeah.

[22:32] I figured that out.

[22:33] Yeah.

[22:34] But you know, it all just.

[22:35] I think if that was all you focused on, you would be able to figure it up.

[22:37] Because these are funny.

[22:38] Right.

[22:39] And I think having little skit scenarios where people, you know, walk in and they see the boss

[22:45] this thing, or they change their their plate or, you know, someone loses and then it just says like

[22:50] biggest loser, you know, like that cut like the negative versions.

[22:53] We still need to make this decision.

[22:55] Here and you talk like going to hear to 10 million.

[22:58] I'm like that better.

[22:59] Even if you have to do, like I'll be used to videos and content.

[23:02] Yeah.

[23:03] The leeks thing is like that's the, that's the very stable version of this business.

[23:08] And if you did ultimately want to sell in the future, you being able to go to a potential buyer

[23:12] and saying like, I have 5000 leeks that buyer trophies from this every year.

[23:17] And leeks on average, stay for 12 years.

[23:19] You know, like guys who do fan is here, whatever it is.

[23:22] It's like, that's that's fairly, you know, that's pretty, that's a pretty real current business.

[23:27] You know, that's a, that's a, that's a pretty good business.

[23:30] Yeah.

[23:31] Harder to build though and slower.

[23:33] Much harder to build.

[23:34] Right.

[23:35] That's also why it has more value.

[23:36] Yeah.

[23:37] So if, if between those two paths, the like, I would like to just make more profit now and potentially scale faster, then we can talk about the media version of this.

[23:44] I think that's probably where I would.

[23:46] Okay.

[23:47] Cool.

[23:48] Yeah.

[23:49] I chose the tick talk route because of the scalability of it versus sticking on the path we're on.

[23:54] Yeah.

[23:55] It can be come a big business, but I look at the competitors that have been in the business for 40 years.

[23:59] And that's a long road and a long life versus the scalability that I can then turn around and put people in place that I don't have.

[24:05] People in place that I don't have to be there like that's more appealing to me than just just creating a big business.

[24:10] So first things first is we're going to consolidate attention.

[24:13] So we're going to shut down losing location.

[24:18] So that should write off the bat.

[24:20] BA, plus 50% improvement to profit.

[24:24] Yep.

[24:25] Which is great.

[24:26] Cody cutting down that extra location is going to cost basically no revenue because he's getting so little foot traffic that I'm not worried about the loss and sales because he's going to more than make up with that.

[24:34] In two ways.

[24:35] One, he's going to have the 50,000-dollar month cost basically drop straight to the bottom line and for his business given the low margins he has that significant.

[24:42] The second thing is that he's going to consolidate his attention.

[24:45] So he can take the best people from there bring him to home base.

[24:48] You know, get rid of the people that aren't necessarily as good or eyes.

[24:51] I like to say release to free agencies that they have better opportunities somewhere else.

[24:54] And then this way you can kind of like make the dream team at home base and really double down to what matters.

[24:59] I can't really emphasize this enough.

[25:01] The amount of return you get on focus is an entrepreneur is higher than any resource.

[25:05] And fundamentally, this is strategy.

[25:07] It's prioritization.

[25:08] And that means that if it's not a priority, you don't do it.

[25:11] The second thing.

[25:12] Pricing.

[25:13] So what I want you to do is I want you to switch from and you're probably familiar with this.

[25:17] So there's a lot of different pricing models, but you have basically something called a cost-class model.

[25:23] You look at your costs and then you add a margin in whatever.

[25:27] The problem is every business owner that does a cost-class model doesn't make a lot of money.

[25:30] And so you want to switch to value base pricing, which is purely based on what someone's willing is the pay is.

[25:36] And that could be unlimited.

[25:38] And it doesn't matter what your stuff costs because why do they care what it costs?

[25:41] Right?

[25:42] Basically, like as your vendors increase their costs to you.

[25:45] In some ways, it shouldn't have any effect on the price of what you sell because the price of what you sell is completely divorced of that.

[25:53] And based on what somebody's willing to pay.

[25:55] So in terms of how we can do this.

[25:57] So A, which I'll see in a little bit less scary, is I would consider this is sound crazy, but like monthly like 5% pricing increases.

[26:06] Like just keep going and just keep going.

[26:09] That is like path one.

[26:11] And the thing is that every time you raise the price by 5%, you double your profit or I'll say 6%.

[26:16] If you want to be like, hey, I doubled my profit this month.

[26:18] And then next month you can raise by 6% and then more than double because it's 6% times 6%.

[26:22] Right?

[26:23] So that is that is one way.

[26:25] The other way is that you just start immediately split testing kind of like 8020 on your highest sales velocity items.

[26:33] This is simple.

[26:35] Right?

[26:36] This is simple to do.

[26:37] You have to do anything you just add it.

[26:38] Right?

[26:39] That's what it is.

[26:40] This one will probably get you more profit faster.

[26:41] It just takes a little bit more thought.

[26:42] So you'll take those 4 foot 5 foot 6 foot trophies.

[26:45] Yeah.

[26:46] And just start like just keep bumping the price and just seeing what conversion it looks like.

[26:50] What you're trying to optimize for is gross profit times unit sold.

[26:56] And so if you think about it's like, where is the sweet spot where I get the most amount of unit sold at the highest gross profit?

[27:02] Oftentimes it's higher than you think it is because we're I think a lot of entrepreneurs get stuck is like sales velocity goes down and then they get afraid.

[27:11] But the thing is that you would usually make more money before you make less money.

[27:15] Let's say the velocity drops.

[27:16] Usually.

[27:17] I'm referencing something called price elasticity meaning if we make the price go up how much do the sales go down.

[27:22] In general when you raise a price fewer people buy but the question is buy how many so for example if I were to double the price of something and that might triple my margins or quadruple my margins.

[27:33] And 25% fewer people buy I should absolutely do that even though fewer people ultimately say yes.

[27:39] And so he's in one of these situations where he's selling barely enough to say profitability selling a decent amount of volume.

[27:45] And so I'm just saying I wonder if there's a way that we can bump this price even by 6% would double his profit.

[27:50] That's why I'm testing like how sensitive is this market.

[27:52] Now he did indicate that the customer that he decided he wasn't going to pursue which is the the car show guys, the B to B sales, the people were kind of not the gag gift thing.

[28:01] Those people are very sensitive.

[28:03] And so it's like okay if they're the sensitive ones and we're going away from them are the ones that we're going towards less sensitive.

[28:09] And it seems like the answer is yes.

[28:10] And to me that's a big profit opportunity.

[28:13] In terms of k days for price tests would you do it on the site and what do you think you would be doing it on the phone?

[28:19] It'd be on the site.

[28:20] Okay.

[28:21] Because that's worth customer seed of pricing even if they call or anything like that.

[28:24] Yeah.

[28:25] I'll bet you right now because I don't know how many people like buy is it a super price sensitive market?

[28:30] Trovis?

[28:31] Yeah.

[28:32] Okay.

[28:33] Especially certain app stars like car show guys are cheap.

[28:36] Which ones?

[28:37] Car show guys.

[28:38] Car show.

[28:39] I'll bet you which is interesting about this is that you're recurring revenue businesses very price sensitive and you're gag price.

[28:45] Your gag businesses not at all right.

[28:48] I mean it makes me lean more towards the the gag gift side anyways because it's like we can get customers for free and we have a far more pricing power because they're in the moment they think it's funny.

[28:57] Whether it's $8 or it's $12 or $16 like I kind of just want to buy it.

[29:02] You're at the difference between 18 and 16.

[29:04] It's monstrous right for the business.

[29:06] So psych price test and I would probably start with the gag.

[29:10] Gifts here and then I'll make three.

[29:13] We try one six percent on boring side.

[29:18] Boring trophies.

[29:20] At the end of the day you shouldn't take anyone's advice including your own.

[29:24] You should just take the customer's advice.

[29:26] And the way the customer gives you advice is by running a test.

[29:29] And just actually seeing will you buy it or not?

[29:32] And the nice thing is if you raise the price and you go to high and you ultimately have people you know sales decrease then you can always lower it again not a big deal.

[29:39] But not testing your price is the most expensive thing that you can do in a business from the profit that you should be making but are.

[29:46] Now this is the major part is if your focus is going to be media and that's going to be the direction that you're going to get.

[29:52] Was there an influencer or something you made the video that had the trophy in it?

[29:56] No.

[29:57] This is my operation.

[29:58] You guys did it.

[29:59] Yeah, we did it.

[30:00] And it just happened.

[30:01] It just crushed.

[30:02] It got tagged or product on TikTok shop got tagged and we sold 70 to 100 off of that.

[30:07] And we got to follow a video and that's the one that had 16 million views.

[30:10] Okay.

[30:11] How many TikToks you're making a month?

[30:13] Right now we're doing about one a day and we're trying to rampet up to three a day.

[30:19] Okay.

[30:20] The gifts that he has the gag gifts the head mofo in charge.

[30:24] Just types of gag gifts lend themselves really well to being shared and going viral.

[30:29] And so him doubling down on all the different permutations of that as different hooks and different are going to content.

[30:34] That makes complete sense and he should just do as much of it as he possibly can.

[30:37] And for anyone who's listening to this and is like, okay, he's going to go from one to three.

[30:40] I want to just break a belief for you.

[30:42] You can post a hundred times a day.

[30:43] The platform is incentivized to distribute your content to as many people as possible to retain attention.

[30:48] And so there's a lot of mythology on all platforms of people who say, don't post more than X times.

[30:54] I think it absolutely just comes down to a quality metric, which is how many times can you post good stuff.

[30:59] But there's an Instagram page that's in Bali with that post a hundred times a day and gets like nine billion views.

[31:06] And so the thing is is that not the same people are going to see every post.

[31:10] And so right now when you make a post only one or two percent your audience likely see it.

[31:13] And so if you make ten more posts, they might just show to other people in your audience that aren't the first people who saw it.

[31:18] So the direct site traffic right now comes predominantly from SEO.

[31:21] So it's talking about that.

[31:23] Do you have an SEO firm or negative thoughts on SEO for agency?

[31:27] How long you would work with them?

[31:28] This one by eight months.

[31:31] Traditionally, I've always had pretty good success with SEO.

[31:35] Okay.

[31:36] And we stopped SEO because the company was previously going to be performing.

[31:40] And then when these guys came in and started going back up again, what stops you from doing more SEO?

[31:48] Or rather what stops that like if you were to say, hey, because I mean when I see 13 to one, right?

[31:53] I'm like that sounds interesting.

[31:54] If you're to say, hey, I want you to give me like three clients worth of focus so that you can give me three times the backlinks and three times the articles or whatever it is that they're turning out for you.

[32:04] Is there anything that's because if you get 13 to one, it's like we should spend as much as possible.

[32:08] And that's why I started meta is.

[32:12] But it's different though.

[32:13] Yeah.

[32:14] Because the introduction based ad versus SEO where it's intended based.

[32:16] Do you think you go to the SEO agency and just say like, how do you max me out?

[32:20] I can absolutely do that.

[32:22] Okay.

[32:23] Because it's also like these things are not taking your time.

[32:25] Right.

[32:26] Right.

[32:27] So the SEO was interesting to me because he had an outsource agency that was handling the vast majority of it.

[32:31] So it wasn't actually a big time drain for him and it had really good returns.

[32:34] And so again, allocation of resources.

[32:36] Think about this way.

[32:37] If you have a machine that you could put a dollar and you get $13 out, what do you limit your dollars in with?

[32:41] You don't.

[32:42] You just put as many dollars in as you possibly can, which is why I asked the question, like, how do we do 10 times more of this?

[32:47] So this is like media one is SEO max out.

[32:52] The SEO company wants me to do Google ads.

[32:55] Yeah.

[32:56] Is that something you kind of throw into that mix?

[32:58] Okay.

[32:59] Mm-hmm.

[33:00] Yeah, especially like.

[33:01] These are both in 10 based, right?

[33:03] Yeah.

[33:04] And so very least you should own your own terms, which is like all your names and derivatives of your names.

[33:09] Like I've rarely seen anyone in any business, just own their own terms and not make money off of it.

[33:15] Yeah.

[33:16] And so people like why don't want to pay for it?

[33:17] Like I was going to get the things is like, you're not always going to get the click.

[33:19] And so having it there, I'm like, you're going to make the money.

[33:22] Like just, you know what I mean?

[33:23] But then the second version of that is associated terms, like the long tail keywords.

[33:28] Now, yeah, it gives a hundred percent.

[33:30] No one's like, hey, you know, fucking move all the plan.

[33:33] I'm going to throw a trophy right here.

[33:34] Right here.

[33:35] You probably not to throw on a face, but yeah, I'm really looking for it.

[33:38] Yeah, I've been looking for a gold cast trophy.

[33:41] Right.

[33:42] Okay.

[33:43] So this is the, like if we're looking at this, these are all, but I would consider like black and white.

[33:49] Very low lift.

[33:50] Almost guaranteed to make you more money moves.

[33:53] Almost all of these will just make you more money.

[33:55] This is 13 to 1.

[33:56] This is probably going to be high return.

[33:57] This could double the profit.

[33:59] This takes at $50,000 to the bottom line.

[34:01] The priceess for sure are going to increase on the gag gifts.

[34:04] So now we can talk about the media side.

[34:06] So we're going to go from one to three a day.

[34:09] And I think that you should focus on trends and memes.

[34:14] Because this is a gag gift brand.

[34:15] So it's okay for you to just like be silly and ridiculous.

[34:19] And so like there are so many memes.

[34:21] Mike, where do we find our like TikTok memes stuff?

[34:25] Just hire a 17 year old.

[34:27] It's a 13-year-old.

[34:28] Yeah, I just be like, what's trending right now?

[34:30] You don't even need to be like, if you're a little bit on the older side.

[34:33] Perhaps you're a millennial.

[34:34] And you have a graying beard and you're ultimately going to be taking out

[34:37] to pasturn in the next five years.

[34:39] And put to rest as I am.

[34:41] You have to get people who are younger than you who are in the game of social media

[34:46] who know what's hot right now and can make contextually relevant or native media

[34:51] that ultimately gets way more shares, way more views, and then ultimately more conversion.

[34:54] Plus 1,000 aura to Cody.

[34:58] So what's interesting is that a lot of these TikTok ones also do well on Instagram.

[35:01] So you could re-purpose there.

[35:02] Do you post on Instagram?

[35:03] Yeah.

[35:04] Okay.

[35:05] Yeah.

[35:06] It's just starting.

[35:07] Yeah.

[35:08] You'll get a double, you know, you'll get W.

[35:09] But TikTok is like the perfect platform for you.

[35:11] It makes complete sense to me.

[35:13] They did 250,000 in a month.

[35:15] And so when I, the reason I said the 10 million is like, okay, well that happened on accident.

[35:18] Let's do it on purpose.

[35:19] And if you can do 250 a month just from that, it's like, well there's 3 million.

[35:23] Yeah.

[35:24] I think you getting really ridiculous with the volume.

[35:26] I think it gets you a lot better.

[35:27] And I think this is one of those things that you should live close to.

[35:29] Okay.

[35:30] Like you.

[35:31] Like these things are all things that you could do probably the week you get back.

[35:34] You know what I mean?

[35:35] This one is going to be the, this is like the, the big commitment of what's the

[35:38] that we're making, the bet we're making is that mastering TikTok, live selling, etc.

[35:43] It's going to be the way.

[35:44] It's definitely a new scale to a little intimidating to know like, okay, this is

[35:48] worth 80% of my time is going to go now for a new task that I've never done.

[35:51] But very innovative, which I love innovation.

[35:53] I love thinking about like, oh, hey, how can we be

[35:55] different than the industry?

[35:57] And this is definitely different.

[35:59] Now the second part of kind of like TikTok mastery is going to be influencers.

[36:04] Okay.

[36:05] And so what's nice with TikTok shot is that your stuff is automatically going to be listed

[36:10] there and other people can make videos for it.

[36:13] And you're in the price point.

[36:15] That's perfect for TikTok shot.

[36:17] Like 20, 30, 50, like it crashes for that stuff.

[36:20] And it's such easy videos for people to make.

[36:23] And that lines up with what TikTok has been telling us to do.

[36:26] Wait, have you been reaching out to them or, yeah, we haven't account right now.

[36:29] Oh cool, great way I can see this is 50.

[36:31] Yeah, yeah, yeah, I feel like it's hard to take touch.

[36:36] And I mean, fundamentally like, these are basically one time work.

[36:41] This is the only ongoing work that you do.

[36:44] Trends and I'd be posting one to three times a day there,

[36:47] repurposed on IG, right?

[36:50] That's just free traffic.

[36:52] So influencers will also kind of, this will, it'll be like a loop here.

[36:56] So it's like, they'll do something that works well.

[36:59] And then that will feed, like, it'll just be this nice loop where they're also creating content for you.

[37:04] Real quick, this type of content, I've gotten a ton of positive feedback on.

[37:08] And so I'm going to continue to make it.

[37:10] But what I need your help on is helping it distribute because this isn't why to algorithm stuff.

[37:15] A lot of people aren't going to see it because it's narrower and it is four business owners.

[37:19] So if you know a business owner or you have kids and you want them to learn business,

[37:22] where if people were business interested, it would mean the world to me and my team who put so many hours into making this stuff for you.

[37:27] It would just mean the world if you send it to them. It would mean a lot.

[37:30] And then I'll put, I'm going to put number seven on here because I think this is worth it.

[37:37] The TikTok ads, which you said you just started, basically the process is going to look like this.

[37:42] You made the ad, right?

[37:43] Or sorry, you made the content.

[37:45] You're making content, right?

[37:48] You're making TikTok content.

[37:49] That's a TikTok content.

[37:51] You know, 10% go viral, whatever.

[37:54] And then 90% go viral.

[37:56] Right?

[37:57] Then this, you put ad money behind it.

[38:01] You send this to influencers and say, make stuff like this because this is what's converting.

[38:08] And then don't make versions of this that will also inform your content.

[38:12] But you'll then try to make iterations of what they're doing.

[38:15] And so like you're kind of your source, like you're starting.

[38:18] Here's the TikTok content.

[38:19] Some does well.

[38:20] Great.

[38:21] Push ads behind it.

[38:22] By the way, guys, here's the ones that are working well.

[38:24] They make stuff.

[38:25] You can take theirs, push money behind it as well.

[38:27] And model it and make for permutations of it.

[38:30] And so for this stuff, I would be kind of hook centric, meaning for, for most

[38:35] short form platforms like the hook is everything.

[38:37] And once you have a winning hook, I would like reuse, reuse it over and over again.

[38:43] The reason I'm recommending he doubled down on TikTok is you want to go with the fish art, right?

[38:47] You want to go where the getting is good.

[38:49] And so right now, TikTok shop is crushing it.

[38:51] It's blowing up.

[38:52] Lots of people are doing very, very well on the platform.

[38:55] And he already has seen some success.

[38:57] And so as soon as I get that little inkling of success, there's that little blood in the water.

[39:00] That's when I want to just like go go ham on it.

[39:03] So one is how do we increase volume?

[39:04] Secondarily, how do we increase quality of output?

[39:07] Basically, once we do these easy fixes, this is really the long term strategy that

[39:11] he needs to get really good at is that he's got to get really good at media.

[39:14] You actually have a really simple one.

[39:15] The nice thing is that I have a lot of confidence.

[39:18] And there's basically no like, not really sure.

[39:22] Like site price test could easily like two x profits.

[39:25] Yeah.

[39:26] Like on its own because the margins are so similar right now, right?

[39:29] Six x, this is a two x on profit for sure.

[39:32] SEO max out.

[39:33] Well right now, it's 50% of revenue is coming from that.

[39:37] Like if maybe we get a 50% boost from them doing a better job on it,

[39:42] PPC will just get you good returns.

[39:44] This might give you like a 10 to 20% boost.

[39:46] So I don't think it'll be huge, but it's like it's free.

[39:48] And it's a one time site.

[39:49] So it's not hard to do.

[39:50] TikToks can be the big lever of like how do we go from one million to 10 million.

[39:54] It's like if you if you did nothing else, but just like a year from now,

[39:58] if all we did was master TikTok and TikTok shopping,

[40:02] we would win.

[40:04] Like if you did nothing else, this is just going to take all of your

[40:06] existing business and make it more profitable so that you can take all of this cash and

[40:10] float into your.

[40:12] Yeah, but actually fairly straightforward.

[40:14] That's a good thing.

[40:15] That's a good thing.

[40:16] Right?

[40:17] Then like we have to bet the farm on something which sometimes has to happen.

[40:19] Yeah, that's awesome.

[40:20] Way simpler than I was thinking.

[40:21] Oh good.

[40:22] Yeah.

[40:23] Yeah.

[40:24] They would just do more more works.

[40:25] And the fact that you have such low margins,

[40:27] excites me because when you make five or 10% improvements, you double a

[40:31] triple.

[40:32] Right?

[40:33] Yeah.

[40:34] That you haven't like that there was no pricing discipline.

[40:36] Like there's no there's no like process to pricing besides like,

[40:39] we'll just keep raising it when our Costco out.

[40:41] Yeah.

[40:42] Usually there's just like when I see a business like that,

[40:44] there's like massive unlocks.

[40:45] Like I'm saying six percent on foreign trophies, but like you might be able to push

[40:49] 25.

[40:50] Yeah.

[40:51] And that four X is five X is profit of it.

[40:52] Whenever I see a business that's misprice or extremely misprice,

[40:56] I get really excited because I know it's one of the lowest operational

[41:00] drag moves that you can do.

[41:01] Functionally, everything else you have to do in a business.

[41:03] If you got to do something with pricing, you literally change a number.

[41:05] Are you say different word at the end of a phone call?

[41:07] Like it's that easy to change, but it has such a dramatic impact on how

[41:11] profitable businesses.

[41:12] And what's crazy about that is that entrepreneurs tend to be the most

[41:15] afraid of pricing changes.

[41:16] So it's all between your ears and it's like,

[41:18] how else you can fear just having the courage to just say a bigger number.

[41:21] The fear is that you're somehow going to lose your business.

[41:23] You just if it doesn't work, you just lower it back again, not a big deal.

[41:26] But this could change his life.

[41:27] And so I'm very interested to find out more there.

[41:29] What's the offer that you have in the box?

[41:31] Usually it's a little code that says like 10% something to order here, order again.

[41:36] Why don't you give something much better than that?

[41:38] Okay.

[41:39] So we have to come up with a really compelling offer to get people who are bikes.

[41:44] The nice thing, the important thing is are you doing fulfillment for Amazon?

[41:47] We have some FBA, but most of it's FBM.

[41:50] Okay.

[41:51] We're fulfilling most of it.

[41:52] Okay, great.

[41:53] So you're fulfilling most of it.

[41:54] That's wonderful.

[41:55] Okay.

[41:56] So, and at C, same thing.

[41:57] At C, we fulfill everything.

[41:58] Great.

[41:59] Okay. So that means that we can put something in the box to be really compelling to get them to buy something.

[42:04] So if now Amazon Etsy, the purchasers are buying there.

[42:08] Are they more written about our people?

[42:10] Are they more gay people?

[42:11] I would say more gag.

[42:12] More gag.

[42:13] Okay.

[42:14] Because they're more like funny, designs, funny things.

[42:17] Mm-hmm.

[42:18] Okay.

[42:19] I would put a buggo offer in or a, sorry.

[42:25] Okay.

[42:26] Okay.

[42:28] Okay.

[42:29] And then just fix the pricing of the one so that it makes sense.

[42:32] Yeah.

[42:33] I would basically have this little thing here.

[42:35] So that would be the headline on the top of my little.

[42:38] My little, my little dude at, you got your QR code.

[42:42] And then I would have my top one, two, and three gag gifts.

[42:48] Okay.

[42:49] Because they just bought one.

[42:50] So it's like, let me tell you the other gag gifts that people buy the most of.

[42:52] Gotcha.

[42:53] And I would put that into every one of the boxes.

[42:55] Okay.

[42:56] And the framework that I'm talking to about right now, which is, you know, we're going

[42:59] to buy one, get to free, buy one, get free free, like, what are we going to do?

[43:02] That actually is a little, a little easter egg for what's coming out in my next book.

[43:07] What do you, how big's your email list?

[43:09] For trophy side?

[43:10] Yeah.

[43:11] I think we have like 10,000 contacts.

[43:13] What do you do for long term nurture?

[43:15] Not much.

[43:16] Okay.

[43:17] Well, guess what?

[43:18] We just found ourselves another couple hundred grand.

[43:20] So let me tell you a stat that'll blow your mind.

[43:23] I'm sure e-commerce businesses get between 30 and 50% of revenue from email.

[43:30] Uh, we're missing out a lot.

[43:34] Yeah.

[43:35] So there's probably like one and a half million sitting there.

[43:38] Yeah.

[43:39] And that's all profit because there's no answer.

[43:41] Right.

[43:42] Most e-commerce businesses basically break even or lose money on spending at sea

[43:46] at customers and they make it up with their email follow up.

[43:49] Gotcha.

[43:50] We just found a big bag of money.

[43:52] How about that?

[43:52] So this was a late nugget, but I'm glad we found it.

[43:55] I assumed because anybody who's in e-commerce or at least if you're any

[43:59] commerce or in physical products or retail email marketing is just massive.

[44:02] And the difference in small companies and big companies is oftentimes just what percentage

[44:07] of customers are return customers and one of the primary vehicles for doing that is email

[44:11] and SMS.

[44:12] And so he's not doing really any at all.

[44:14] And so this was just a massive profit opportunity because he's getting all these customers

[44:18] in the door and then just never talking to them again.

[44:20] And so if you're a business owner right now and you have this big list of customers and you

[44:24] haven't like email them in a while, it's the closest thing to free money.

[44:27] You just send the email out with some sort of offer and you can get money immediately

[44:33] for basically no cost because you already incurred the cost.

[44:35] Now the structure that I talk about with emails is that obviously you can't do that forever

[44:39] because then you just fatigue the list and people would be like, well I don't want to listen to this thing.

[44:42] All this guy does is try and hawk stuff.

[44:44] I like to try and have some sort of value if possible.

[44:46] Now value can be described in different ways.

[44:48] If you have gag gifts then it's probably going to be in the form of entertainment more than it's education.

[44:51] Right, like people aren't going to like, oh, let me, let me six ways to use trophies.

[44:54] I don't know if I'm really into that.

[44:55] But if I see funny versions and maybe even emailing some of his content that's that really does well,

[45:01] might be a great strategy for him to get people to continue to click and basically reinforce that loop so that they want to open it.

[45:07] Because the end of the day, people buy newspapers because they want to be educated.

[45:10] But what they read is they flipped the back and often read the funnies.

[45:13] And so it's like, how can we take that old school human behavior from an old-school

[45:17] environment and how can we mirror it on a newer platform?

[45:20] So it was our offer which we added in.

[45:22] Nine.

[45:23] It's going to be email.

[45:26] Okay.

[45:27] There's me two different types of email that you need to do.

[45:30] So number one is going to be flows.

[45:32] So these are based on user behavior.

[45:34] So when someone visits a specific product, they should get like a five email sequence.

[45:40] I'd be like, hey, saw that you were looking at the go whatever.

[45:44] And that should just that should happen for anybody who obssander does a two-step or a band in cards.

[45:49] Right?

[45:50] Do you have a band in card?

[45:51] We have a band in card.

[45:52] Okay.

[45:53] The other pieces we need the long term archer.

[45:54] All right.

[45:55] So what I'd recommend is three times per week.

[45:58] It feels like a lot for trophies.

[46:00] The trophies of less frequent purchase.

[46:03] The gag I feel like is like, if you buy one gag, give to you, you will only to buy them for many people because you just think they're funny.

[46:10] They are separate brands though.

[46:12] Correct?

[46:13] Because you have like, okay.

[46:14] So I would say this I'm cool with on the gag gift side.

[46:17] Okay.

[46:18] Because right now you're not making any of the return sales anyways.

[46:20] Right?

[46:21] See, my phone gets me.

[46:22] We don't really have any mail lists for the gag side because it's all three.

[46:24] Oh, because it's easy.

[46:25] It's easy.

[46:26] It's not take touch.

[46:27] So they just take touch not give you email.

[46:28] So I think we'll go one time a week.

[46:32] And we're not worried about the gag gift.

[46:34] Okay.

[46:35] I think just one time a week of.

[46:37] And if you were basically domain school, you're domain, how through domain authority,

[46:40] stays healthy in your open rates day.

[46:42] Okay.

[46:43] Click through it.

[46:44] Okay.

[46:45] How would increase frequency?

[46:46] Okay.

[46:47] So you start with one a week and you're probably thinking, okay, what am I going to, what am I going to email about?

[46:50] Right?

[46:51] So when you have customer stories, cool trophies.

[46:53] Because I'm sure there's every week there's like one trophy or something that's just like interesting that you have had.

[46:58] Right?

[46:59] Probably stuff about recognition status and cheapest compensation.

[47:03] So I think if I were to, if I own your company, right?

[47:06] So I'd be like, okay.

[47:07] Are we in the trophy business?

[47:09] No trophies, what we sell.

[47:11] Right?

[47:12] But it's really just the vehicle for giving people recognition status and compensation.

[47:17] Right?

[47:18] And so my, the things that I would email would probably be about how you could either give your team a pay raise,

[47:24] or you could give them a trophy.

[47:26] And believe it or not, here's this research.

[47:28] The trophy's actually even more meaningful.

[47:30] Right?

[47:31] So they like it more.

[47:32] And you like it more as a business owner.

[47:33] Right?

[47:34] So it would be that kind of stuff that I'd be, you only have to write 52.

[47:36] It's not that many.

[47:37] Yes.

[47:38] You literally probably do it in like a day and a day.

[47:40] Okay.

[47:41] So keep it low in the beginning just to like get a feel for it.

[47:45] See how, like the first couple of those are going to shake out because you're going to a super responsive list.

[47:49] And we want to keep these all text.

[47:52] All text.

[47:53] Yeah.

[47:54] All text.

[47:55] I would say link to the image.

[47:57] Because then carry out the, like, and also image based,

[48:00] to tend to get lower, deliverability rates then, like full text one.

[48:04] And when people opt in, or if certain when people purchase,

[48:07] or opt in, a band and car, the first one, I would have is replyback, or

[48:14] on a East trophy, all the time.

[48:18] And so as soon as someone opt in, it's a double opt in.

[48:21] So don't increase your deliverability.

[48:22] Right?

[48:23] And so they'll reply back and then it's an automation of the do anything.

[48:26] And then you'll send them the link for the clickable picture.

[48:29] Yeah.

[48:30] And they're like, this is ridiculous.

[48:31] And then underneath of that, so when you have a clickable link,

[48:33] you want it to take them.

[48:35] You want to have it take them to a page.

[48:37] It looks like this.

[48:38] Whatever.

[48:39] And then here you have, by.

[48:41] So like you can have the funniest thing, but it's also,

[48:45] CTating gets them to buy something.

[48:47] Got you.

[48:48] One through five plus nine.

[48:51] Yeah.

[48:52] Are all like bread and butter, do these zero thought.

[48:56] And so in terms of order here.

[48:58] All right.

[48:59] So this is number one.

[49:00] This is just going to give you time back.

[49:02] First, this is probably second.

[49:05] Is it the same agency that does this in this?

[49:10] Yeah.

[49:11] Okay.

[49:12] So that's for both of these.

[49:13] That's one call.

[49:15] This is fourth.

[49:18] Fifth.

[49:19] Six.

[49:21] With the email file, the place, because we're basically going to optimize other things.

[49:28] And then we'll basically file whatever one.

[49:31] And then this is going to be seventh.

[49:36] Fifth.

[49:38] Awesome.

[49:40] Cool.

[49:41] Yeah.

[49:42] Super cool.

[49:43] Well, I think we found a few doubles in the business.

[49:46] Absolutely.

[49:47] I love it.

[49:48] Feel all right.

[49:49] Yeah.

[49:50] I feel really good.

[49:51] All right.

[49:52] Yeah.

[49:53] You've had it.

[49:54] It's gonna be great.

[49:55] And you're much cleaner and simpler than I thought.

[49:56] Oh good.

[49:57] I just got done filming with Alex.

[49:59] I'm super excited after this.

[50:01] I mean, to have a 9.0 bullet point of here's a tactical of what to do to grow 2x 5x 10x.

[50:08] It's pretty cool.

[50:09] So whether you have a trophy company or not, all of the fundamentals that we're walking through here is one.

[50:14] We're consolidating costs because there wasn't a strategic advantage to having a larger footprint.

[50:18] Number two is that we're running pricing tests regularly so that we can optimize how much money we get per customer.

[50:23] And see how much, how much higher we can drive it.

[50:26] Especially with older businesses they often don't change the prices is frequently enough.

[50:30] And especially with the amount of inflation has happened over the last 3, 4 years.

[50:33] If you haven't really adjusted prices in a big way like 50% plus, then you're making significantly less money.

[50:38] The next one is doubling down to what works.

[50:40] So in two senses, one is he had good returns on SEO.

[50:42] But also we know that his organic with TikTok is working.

[50:45] So on a double down on those things.

[50:47] But if you look at how these things are ordered, so I tend to order them using ice, which is impact confidence ease.

[50:52] So how big of a difference is it gonna make?

[50:54] How likely is it to occur and how hard is it?

[50:55] And so if you have something that's really likely, big impact and easy, you start with those first and then you just work your way down.

[51:01] And number four, and this is a big one, we make sales to get customers.

[51:05] We don't get customers to make sales.

[51:07] And so the point of the first transaction that I'd like to shift Cody's perspective on or anybody's perspective on is you get the gag gift sale,

[51:13] but then you do everything else to turn it into a lifelong or at least repeat customer.

[51:17] And so we're doing this through multiple paths.

[51:19] One is that we're creating the offer to get them to come back, so we can own the data.

[51:21] On top of that, then we have the remarketing in place that's going to happen in terms of email follow up.

[51:26] On top of that, we can just have remarketing across all social media for anyone who hits a site.

[51:30] Each of these things have one clear intention, which is how do we get somebody to buy again?

[51:34] So if you liked this video, you're going to love this video.

[51:37] I did with Raymond, who's a multi-location car factor.

[51:40] I break down tons of stuff that applies to many businesses.

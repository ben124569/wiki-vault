## Full Transcript
[00:00] I want to talk about the secrets of scaling paid ads no matter what business level you're at.

[00:03] Biggest obstacle is just throw out of the going down.

[00:06] We spend four money.

[00:07] 10 million pounds per week.

[00:08] No.

[00:09] Very low trust.

[00:10] And that's it.

[00:12] So I said a bunch of businesses at different sizes, ask me questions about their pay

[00:16] dads and I'm going to do my very best to answer them.

[00:19] So from 10 million dollars a year all the way down to $600,000 a year in terms of size,

[00:24] some people are trying to start running paid ads, some people are trying to expand or

[00:28] scale their ads and are running into particular issues.

[00:30] 650 dental recruiting, how do I start marketing?

[00:35] So you currently run ads for job boards where you add.

[00:37] Here you go.

[00:38] So you run ads on job boards.

[00:41] So you already know how to run ads.

[00:43] This is me trying to break a belief for you.

[00:44] So you're already doing it.

[00:45] You're just doing it on another platform.

[00:47] So you're doing it in order to get dentists.

[00:50] But you're also trying to attract dentists who have clinics.

[00:55] I don't think it's, you just happen to me on job boards.

[00:57] But fundamentally, you can run the, I mean dentists are also in meta, same thing.

[01:03] They're probably older, more boring.

[01:05] I said that with love to dentists.

[01:07] So I was like, yeah, Instagram Facebook will probably do really, really well for you and

[01:11] just saying, hey, I have a tired of taking all these calls yourself, like talk to the

[01:16] pain point of that dentist.

[01:18] So it's like, they don't want to work weekends.

[01:20] They don't want to work early hours.

[01:21] They don't want to take cases.

[01:22] They want to take, well, or they don't want to eventually retire someday, but they

[01:26] don't want to let down all their patients.

[01:28] And they don't want to sell us some private equity because they're going to force them

[01:30] to work for five years in servitude and control their lives.

[01:33] So these are the pain points, right?

[01:35] Layle is cousins at dentists.

[01:36] So that's fresh in one moment.

[01:38] And so these are all the pains.

[01:39] That's my hook for the ads.

[01:41] And then targeting, take your customer list, make a look like audience off that list.

[01:44] If dentists isn't the copy, dentists isn't the video, the AI, Facebook will also notice

[01:47] our dividendists.

[01:48] And it'll be pretty straightforward.

[01:49] Bingo.

[01:50] All right.

[01:52] 600K, acupuncture.

[01:54] Start.

[01:55] So if you want to run, so this is local, right?

[01:58] OK.

[01:59] So the nice thing is that local businesses are the easiest business run ads for.

[02:02] OK, because trust is sky high.

[02:03] And you're like, they don't trust me.

[02:05] Like, try and sell beauty to people in the internet.

[02:09] It's much harder.

[02:10] So all you need to do is run lead gen ads.

[02:12] So I'm going to give you the simplest strategy for getting this, are you guys technically

[02:16] proficient?

[02:17] You are.

[02:18] OK, fantastic.

[02:19] Well, I was going to assume you weren't going to give you an easy way.

[02:21] But all you want to do is you can just run lead ads.

[02:24] For some sort of free thing.

[02:26] And you're like, I want really high quality people.

[02:28] Well, welcome to call traffic.

[02:29] So they won't be.

[02:32] But what you will need to create is the sales process

[02:35] that creates qualified customers.

[02:37] And so when I say creates, it's really just filters for good ones.

[02:40] Just think about it like that.

[02:41] It's just like I'm adding filters.

[02:43] And the more filters you add, the more expensive the leads will be,

[02:45] if they're good filters.

[02:47] And if they're more expensive, they'll be good, if they're good filters.

[02:49] If you add bad filters, they'll be more expensive, but they won't be better.

[02:53] So if I make it really hard for my page load, it adds friction,

[02:55] but it's not good friction.

[02:56] If I had a VSL, so a video sales letter to a page,

[02:59] it'll create friction, but it'll be good friction.

[03:01] So I'll increase the quality of the lead by doing that.

[03:03] And so with a local business, you're going to want to have

[03:06] like in larger national companies, this is where brand

[03:09] adding the building trust, adding value first matters.

[03:12] In local, it matters significantly less.

[03:14] It is very offered driven on a local basis.

[03:17] Because people know what acupuncture is.

[03:19] So you can say free thing, or $19 thing,

[03:23] since you probably, your time costs a little bit more

[03:25] than maybe a low-skilled labor job.

[03:28] I'd probably go for the $19-99 thing.

[03:31] Maybe somewhere in there, if I had to bet $19-29,

[03:33] would be where I'd start.

[03:35] And what you do is you sell people on that,

[03:38] they opt in for it, thank you page, they can purchase it.

[03:41] You still call all the leads yourself.

[03:43] You close them on the $19 thing to get a card on file.

[03:46] When you schedule, you'll confirm that appointment

[03:50] and that that cards attach to that person.

[03:53] And so then you'll do the treatment that you're going to do.

[03:56] And then you're going to sell them the plan afterwards.

[03:59] Now, my preference here would be that you sell before you treat.

[04:04] If that doesn't work out for you, you can treat first.

[04:07] I just prefer to have someone in pain.

[04:09] Sell them the much longer thing that's going to permanently

[04:12] sell that, give them short-term relief afterwards,

[04:14] and set their next visit.

[04:16] And then when you do your actual sales appointment,

[04:19] the nice thing is you already have the card,

[04:21] and so you can say awesome.

[04:22] So this is this.

[04:22] You want to use the card you have in file.

[04:24] Great.

[04:24] And that's the sale.

[04:25] Does that make sense?

[04:26] OK.

[04:27] That's the Acupuncture Process.

[04:29] All right.

[04:29] Three million CrossFit Coach, Business Coach,

[04:32] Brand Conchist.

[04:33] So you guys are doing, what kind of conch you guys making?

[04:37] Apocass is the only thing.

[04:39] OK.

[04:39] So you guys are even Apocass and that's it.

[04:42] We have some longer forms of content, but it's really

[04:45] OK.

[04:46] Got it.

[04:47] OK.

[04:47] Um.

[04:49] The business started from Apocass.

[04:50] The Apocass was worth it.

[04:51] Yeah, understood.

[04:52] And we have unique personality.

[04:55] Yeah.

[04:56] Are you guys, um, Barbell, uh, shrugged?

[04:58] That was yours.

[05:00] OK.

[05:00] Got it.

[05:01] OK.

[05:02] OK.

[05:02] I hear you.

[05:04] I never had a name to a face, but I need the Apocass.

[05:06] OK.

[05:07] So where would I start?

[05:09] OK.

[05:09] First thing I would do, same thing earlier,

[05:11] is I would do a retargeting campaign across all platforms.

[05:13] And the nice things that platforms are not super hard

[05:15] to figure out.

[05:16] They're made, zealings of dollars to make them easy to click.

[05:18] If you already have traffic, so you install a pixel for each

[05:21] of the platforms on your page, you'll start collecting data

[05:24] from every single visit that's already coming from your podcast.

[05:26] You can start retargeting.

[05:27] So that's layer one.

[05:28] You should probably also earn your PPC terms.

[05:30] It'll immediately make money.

[05:32] Like there's no PPC campaign for your own terms that

[05:34] doesn't make money.

[05:35] I haven't seen it ever have my entire life.

[05:37] It's just number one and two.

[05:38] So on your own terms, do the retargeting.

[05:41] Third thing is you have to come up with

[05:43] something that's really banger and super, super valuable

[05:46] that you can get away for free.

[05:48] Like you've seen my stuff.

[05:48] So the money models books, the framework,

[05:53] the 11 frameworks for profitable gems, all that stuff.

[05:55] So really put time into it.

[05:56] Because I think people really skimp on this.

[05:58] And that's why people opt in.

[06:00] They see it.

[06:00] They're like, oh, this is shit.

[06:01] Why would I continue to book with this person?

[06:03] And so they opt in.

[06:05] Thank you, Bades schedule.

[06:07] It still works.

[06:08] Now the thing is, is that you guys do have a brand.

[06:11] If you're worried about being brand conscious,

[06:12] all you do is just be true to you and the ads.

[06:15] And my recommendation is, let your clients talk.

[06:19] So just let proof through the talking.

[06:21] That's how I would approach it.

[06:23] When I look at all the ads that we've done over the years,

[06:26] like I said earlier, 80% of them are about proof.

[06:28] And so as much as we want to think it's all about us,

[06:31] like no one cares.

[06:32] Like Alex had the big gym, I would still do,

[06:35] right, the big gym company.

[06:37] One, I'm not in the ads anymore at all.

[06:38] And I wasn't for the last two years.

[06:41] And it was because we just focused on the customers

[06:42] because gym owners don't really care about me.

[06:44] I mean, they care about making money.

[06:46] And they're like, I'm glad he helped.

[06:47] But really, they just want to make more and see other people

[06:49] like them that they can say, oh, this is a good approximation

[06:51] of my gym.

[06:53] And so the idea there is, you want to create the most compelling

[06:56] proof is possible, which is the type of proof that would

[06:59] be the least likely to be fixed.

[07:00] So on this extreme, you'd have a faceless anonymous 10 year

[07:04] outdated text-based testimonial.

[07:08] On this extreme, I would have someone walk up on stage

[07:10] who looks just like you owns a crossfit business

[07:14] coaching business and says, Alex,

[07:16] how many go from 3 million to 30 million.

[07:18] You'd be like fuck.

[07:19] And I'd be like, cool.

[07:20] So you'd be like, that's a really good approximation.

[07:21] Really hard to juk right here, live in front of me,

[07:24] not recorded in person specific to me.

[07:27] And so that's kind of the continuum when you're showing proof.

[07:30] And every approach, every take away.

[07:32] It's like, OK, in person's better than virtual.

[07:36] Live is better than recorded.

[07:38] The like me is better than doesn't look like me.

[07:41] The result that I want is better than a result

[07:42] that's close to what I want.

[07:43] And so you just look at all of the factors that make

[07:45] something super compelling.

[07:47] And when you're looking at your proof, kind of think

[07:48] through it that checklist.

[07:49] And that'll make more compelling proofs that make more

[07:51] compelling ads that you only lose trust in the marketplace

[07:54] when you say something that isn't true.

[07:57] And if you're not saying it, and it's their fact of life,

[08:00] how can anyone fault you?

[08:02] Yep.

[08:04] 800K, vacation rentals B2B.

[08:06] So you're trying to get people who have properties

[08:11] to list with you so that you can make more money

[08:14] with their properties for them.

[08:16] OK.

[08:17] So this will be really, really easy to advertise.

[08:20] Because you're fondament.

[08:22] So do you want people who already, OK,

[08:24] you don't want the extra room people.

[08:26] You want the people who have properties that are being

[08:27] mismanaged?

[08:28] We target homeowners who have a secondary home

[08:31] that they only use a few weeks.

[08:33] OK, and don't do anything in the meantime.

[08:36] OK.

[08:36] So I would start with, so one, I would probably

[08:42] still use meta as my first bet, just because the targeting

[08:45] there is going to be easier to figure out.

[08:49] The ads themselves are going to be the same thing,

[08:51] lead with pain, like I was saying with the dentist.

[08:53] Is what is the pain of that person?

[08:55] Which is, do you feel like you're wasting money

[09:00] by having your house sit empty every year

[09:04] or every month, as you keep paying a mortgage on something

[09:07] that doesn't get you returned?

[09:09] It would be something to that career.

[09:10] You would know the pain better than me,

[09:11] but that's what I would imagine the pain would look like.

[09:15] And so what I would then do is, I would send probably

[09:19] five case studies of different representative houses

[09:21] and different representative avatars.

[09:23] So kind of the point I was making there

[09:24] with the cross-fit gem owners.

[09:25] It's that in the thing that I want to send

[09:28] is we're going to give you an estimate.

[09:29] In the meantime, I'm going to show you 10 representative types

[09:32] of homes that you can probably find one that's close to yours.

[09:36] You can have some reasonable expectation

[09:37] of what you could potentially earn

[09:39] switching to short term in the meantime.

[09:41] And at the bottom, I have the commonly asked questions,

[09:43] which is, are these people going to trash my place?

[09:46] What's my security going to look like?

[09:48] What if they don't leave cleaning?

[09:51] Above all the questions that are going to be there?

[09:52] And I answered that in the bottom,

[09:53] because we already solved this.

[09:54] We do this with this many homes proof.

[09:57] And so we've been doing this for this long, more proof.

[10:00] And so if you'd like, we can give you an estimation

[10:02] of what we think best in your neighborhood years of code,

[10:03] and we can personalize our process to you.

[10:05] Great.

[10:06] OK.

[10:06] That's the ad.

[10:07] And the case study that you give them.

[10:09] So free download, thank you page, schedule,

[10:10] or very simple.

[10:11] If you want, you can add an application.

[10:13] If you get too many opt-ins that aren't qualified,

[10:16] you can add more friction.

[10:17] So just for everyone, it's like, what's the perfect funnel?

[10:20] If you get too many that are bad, add friction.

[10:22] If you don't get enough, remove friction.

[10:24] And if you have almost no friction,

[10:25] and there's still bad leads, the target is off.

[10:29] OK.

[10:30] 2 million beauty 4.6-roads meta.

[10:33] OK.

[10:33] You guys are in Columbia.

[10:34] You're shutting down the other two countries

[10:35] that aren't working as well.

[10:36] You're 30%.

[10:37] You're 40.6.

[10:39] Why aren't you scaling?

[10:41] It's the question.

[10:41] So what is the actual question here?

[10:44] We really want to scale like 5 to the next derivative.

[10:49] OK.

[10:49] And we want to increase our L2V.

[10:51] OK.

[10:53] So how will you land this strategy to do that?

[10:56] We're currently making 100% EEC.

[10:59] Only in meta.

[11:00] Great.

[11:01] Maybe test new creatives, new platforms,

[11:03] but how will we just refer to this strategy?

[11:05] The teams in the data, the content creation.

[11:08] Because that's like a female level that we're in.

[11:11] Yeah.

[11:12] So two ways that you can scale the row as.

[11:14] So one is spend more obviously.

[11:16] So I'm not even including that.

[11:17] But in terms of improving your row as itself,

[11:20] it means you either have to drive down

[11:21] cac or increase L2V, right, or average car value.

[11:25] So in terms of driving down cac, what I would do is I would look at the top.

[11:28] You probably run 1,000 ads over the last year.

[11:31] Look at the top 10% or 5% of ads.

[11:34] Look at the first three seconds of each of those ads.

[11:37] And see if you can model those three seconds

[11:40] with all of the remaining ads that you have.

[11:42] You can even slice that first three seconds off of the best

[11:45] winners and pace it onto another 100 plus ad.

[11:48] So that'll get you 10, 50 times more ad-creative,

[11:51] per good winner that you get.

[11:53] So you can squeeze more out of it.

[11:54] So that's from the creatives strategy.

[11:55] You drive down ad costs.

[11:57] From the LTV perspective, are you guys selling,

[12:03] are you guys selling subscriptions?

[12:04] Are you just selling?

[12:05] We sell like devices and also those metrics.

[12:07] So we have the idea here in the world of advice.

[12:10] We have an ADMS.

[12:11] We have an AD like it's integrated devices.

[12:13] Uh-huh.

[12:14] And you sell bundles.

[12:15] Comments are either because my ex,

[12:17] who does devices.

[12:18] Okay.

[12:18] And you sell, so you sell the devices.

[12:20] And then the recurring goal is that people buy the.

[12:22] All our devices because those are almost like a once

[12:25] and versus something.

[12:26] So they one time purchase on the devices.

[12:29] But the gels or L potions and potions go to honor recurring

[12:34] basis.

[12:35] Right.

[12:36] I mean, does that never make bulbous because they're like

[12:40] little tickets?

[12:40] Yeah.

[12:41] I got you.

[12:42] Yeah.

[12:43] The nice thing is that when it's low ticket,

[12:44] when someone buys a high ticket,

[12:45] the likely that they buy the low ticket thing,

[12:46] if you bundle it up is pretty high.

[12:48] So if someone buys a thousand dollars,

[12:49] I don't know, what's the cost?

[12:50] Like $80 that is high ticket for a blanket.

[12:53] That's fine.

[12:54] Okay.

[12:54] So if you have an $80 thing,

[12:56] then you could still sell a $40 annual for 12 packs of the creams

[13:02] or whatever that go with it,

[13:03] you can just sell a whole bundle of that.

[13:05] Because think about it from the consumer.

[13:06] If I'm buying it's because I believe that I'm going to do this.

[13:10] And if I am going to do it,

[13:11] then I might as well get the savings on the stuff that goes with it.

[13:14] Like if I buy a printer and someone says,

[13:16] hey, buy a year's worth of ink.

[13:17] And in the moment you're like, well,

[13:18] I am going to print stuff.

[13:19] That's why I'm buying it.

[13:21] Then, and not everyone's going to take it.

[13:23] But if 30% of people take it,

[13:25] you add 12 bucks to your ACV and right there,

[13:28] you've got whatever that is, 15% that you add.

[13:31] So that's one thing.

[13:33] In terms of payment plans and financing set up,

[13:35] oh, yes.

[13:36] Okay, so that's good.

[13:38] The big thing with, I mean,

[13:40] I would still, I would lean harder on that thing

[13:42] that I'm talking about with the creeps.

[13:43] Like think about the other thing,

[13:44] about the other things that someone who purchases this machine

[13:48] is going to want to buy.

[13:49] And still offer it.

[13:50] Like there's no point.

[13:51] And then just think about doing it in bundles rather than one off.

[13:53] Because one off so I'm going to make a difference.

[13:55] But bundling for the year,

[13:57] we'll multiply this with any of those small nick necks by a lot.

[14:01] So you might even be able to double, for like the max cart,

[14:03] might be able to double how much someone spends,

[14:06] and you'll feel those pops.

[14:08] So I think between those two things,

[14:09] but I think as a quick word of advice,

[14:12] you guys are in the beauty,

[14:13] direct consumer business.

[14:15] You are a marketing company.

[14:17] And so doubling down on creative as a discipline

[14:20] is what's going to separate you from,

[14:23] like if you want to get to 20 million a year,

[14:25] it's going to be you doing 10 times or 50 times more creative

[14:30] in terms of what you're putting out for output.

[14:32] And so that means having a better system for both capturing

[14:34] UGC and then repurposing UGC.

[14:37] And so for us, for context,

[14:39] we spend 80% of our resources taking winners

[14:41] and just rescinding them.

[14:43] 80%.

[14:44] And so you're getting all these new ads.

[14:46] But the real money is,

[14:48] okay, I have this one winner.

[14:50] And I'll give you a story.

[14:52] I'll try to add that we call the KLA.

[14:53] So KLA was our GM, right?

[14:56] And he made this ad before you as the GM.

[14:59] And it was this beautiful, this perfect testimonial.

[15:02] And it couldn't have planted any better.

[15:03] He had like the gym behind him.

[15:05] It is wife with him.

[15:06] He's like, we're two months from shutting our doors.

[15:08] You can see the gym full.

[15:10] He's like him with four months.

[15:11] He was completely full.

[15:12] 18 months, I had it.

[15:13] And six months had it completely outsourced

[15:14] by 18 months, I sold the whole gym.

[15:16] And I was losing money.

[15:17] And I was working a full-time job

[15:18] just to pay the bills of the gym.

[15:20] And this many months later, it was all great.

[15:23] Now, when we had that ad,

[15:24] I made about a hundred versions of that ad.

[15:27] So I made a black and white version.

[15:29] I did a Sepia filter version.

[15:30] I reorder the back end.

[15:33] We swapped out hooks.

[15:35] I put different headlines.

[15:36] I put different subheads.

[15:37] I changed the fonts.

[15:38] I did a bit of a reddit with different ad copy.

[15:40] I will use and abuse it until it doesn't work at all.

[15:45] And so when you have your winners,

[15:46] you usually just need to run them way longer, way harder.

[15:49] In a lot of different variations.

[15:50] So you can squeeze way more out of it.

[15:53] OK.

[15:54] OK.

[15:54] OK.

[15:55] Cool.

[15:56] All right.

[15:57] 1.8 private practice.

[15:59] OK.

[16:01] So what was the question on this?

[16:03] You want to scale it?

[16:04] Oh, the lead man?

[16:05] OK.

[16:05] Yes.

[16:06] So right now, you've ran your ads to application.

[16:10] So opt-in application.

[16:12] And that didn't work.

[16:14] And then you go freebies to book a call.

[16:17] And that's not working because your call team sucks.

[16:20] We're running freebies with people inside of the book room.

[16:23] OK.

[16:24] And then having a set of calls from the group.

[16:26] OK.

[16:27] But we're not like now a lot of capacity for the set of two

[16:31] set more calls in the book.

[16:32] Yeah.

[16:32] So one is something that was more than that.

[16:35] Could you book a call?

[16:36] Mm-hmm.

[16:37] Thank you.

[16:37] So skip the process.

[16:38] Sure.

[16:39] And every time you do it, you get breaks.

[16:40] You don't know how to book it.

[16:42] So it works.

[16:43] It's just expensive.

[16:44] Yeah.

[16:44] You just want to do it.

[16:46] OK.

[16:47] So I'll give you what I know from group funnels that run on school

[16:50] all the time.

[16:51] And so there is four conversion processes from a group.

[16:54] So one is that you add a free onboarding call to the free group.

[16:57] So every single person gets added to the group,

[16:59] gets an onboarding call as a bonus for joining the group.

[17:02] On the onboarding call, you then clarify where they're there.

[17:04] Well, the problem over their past experiences,

[17:06] oh, I think you might be a good fit.

[17:07] Can I tell you about it?

[17:07] OK.

[17:08] Cool.

[17:08] Then you sell them into the other thing.

[17:10] The second way is that you put five video series inside of the group

[17:14] that functions as a VSL, but just broken up.

[17:17] And so you introduce the opportunity, your core story,

[17:20] the big idea, and then you do three stories, which

[17:22] are going to be their biggest belief breaking point.

[17:24] So big issue, one, biggest YouTube, biggest YouTube,

[17:26] is you three, which is typically universe other people

[17:28] in self.

[17:28] And you break down all three of those.

[17:30] And then on the end, you'll make your call to action, which

[17:32] is the fifth video, which is a little bit of stack,

[17:33] a little bit of sizzle.

[17:34] And you make the CTA.

[17:35] The third one is that inside of that group,

[17:37] you'll do a weekly webinar, where you provide value

[17:39] for the majority of the webinar.

[17:40] And you soft tossed the CTA.

[17:42] Your sales guys and sellers are on that.

[17:44] webinar.

[17:45] Anybody who chats in there, they can pull off them.

[17:47] Somebody's like, oh man, I got this question.

[17:48] Oh, that was so valuable.

[17:49] They immediately DM them and pull them off the call

[17:52] and then they can set them right there.

[17:53] The fourth way is that anybody who engages on recordings

[17:57] or posts inside the group likes, comments, or makes a post.

[18:00] The DM setters go in and then set the call.

[18:03] So it's four different ways you can set from the group.

[18:05] And if you're driving a lot of traffic there

[18:06] and it is working, you just probably need to train your seters

[18:09] better and maybe have more of them.

[18:11] Yep.

[18:13] All right.

[18:14] $1.2 million VAA.

[18:16] So you want to start running ads for your VA business

[18:19] to get business owners?

[18:21] Yeah, business owners.

[18:22] OK.

[18:24] What type of VA?

[18:25] Those are virtual systems.

[18:27] You know, primary secondary, to case A, 9, C,

[18:29] we can do estimates, credit cards, callbacks,

[18:34] and for service based companies.

[18:37] Estim, so like home services?

[18:39] Yeah, you know, service companies.

[18:40] OK.

[18:40] So you're looking for service business owners like roofing, right,

[18:45] to hire VA to do some of the legwork for their team.

[18:50] OK.

[18:51] So the good news is that home services

[18:52] is pretty easy to target.

[18:54] With ads, I would probably also start on meta there.

[18:58] Just because meta-starving is really

[18:59] is the probably the easiest.

[19:00] TikTok is pretty good targeting, too.

[19:01] It's getting much, much, much, much better.

[19:03] But I would start with meta, so Facebook and Instagram.

[19:07] And again, the funnels here are just really

[19:11] valuable thing for how many clients you have.

[19:15] OK, you have 70 clients.

[19:16] And so what I would want to do is show how much money they

[19:19] save and how much more profit they make, per roofer,

[19:22] and I would literally explain it.

[19:24] So a lot of people won't know.

[19:25] So be like the average roofer or the average home service

[19:28] person who has tradesmen who are going out

[19:30] are spending this much per hour to have the person do that,

[19:32] do estimates, do card checks, do whatever,

[19:34] the three main things that you do.

[19:35] And that means that per person, it's costing you $25,000

[19:39] a year in labor.

[19:40] Now the thing is that for $500 a month, we

[19:43] can replace this.

[19:44] So take $25,000, and instead pay six per year.

[19:48] So you get the spread.

[19:49] You get $19,000 back per person.

[19:51] And so if you'd like to see how we can help

[19:53] be implement this, we will guarantee this result.

[19:56] And by day 90, if you haven't made it least five times

[19:58] the money that we've done, we'll give you

[20:00] the rest of the year of the VAs for Fray.

[20:03] That would be my offer.

[20:05] The actual creative would be you breaking down the process.

[20:08] And what you want to do is have some sort of visual proof

[20:10] that's like, this is what John did.

[20:12] And John made this much, save this much money.

[20:15] Here's Stu and Stu save this much.

[20:16] And just say the size of the business.

[20:18] So he's doing about $10,000 a year.

[20:19] He's got 20 guys.

[20:21] And this is what he was able to save.

[20:22] So if these numbers sound at least interesting to you,

[20:24] we'd be happy to have one call.

[20:26] If you have a two-call close, you can say you can leave your

[20:28] credit card at home.

[20:29] It's just to make sure it's a fit for us as much as a fit for you.

[20:31] We only take roofers of buffer certain size.

[20:33] So if you are smaller, don't worry.

[20:35] We'll send you with some resources.

[20:36] I can help you out for Fray.

[20:38] But if you are by the size, we might be able to help you out.

[20:40] And either way, it would be another call for us to close.

[20:42] So you can relax, it's not a sales call.

[20:44] Cool.

[20:45] So add with that kind of copy and messaging.

[20:48] And then freebie thing that will also be a longer version

[20:52] of that with maybe some writing that gives some graphs

[20:53] and some visuals or whatever.

[20:55] And then you can have the thank you page scheduler

[20:57] for them to book a call.

[20:58] Still outbound dial.

[20:59] All the people.

[21:00] You have some VAs.

[21:01] I'm sure they can do that.

[21:02] Call all the leads that opt in no matter what.

[21:04] And the nice thing with that is if your VAs are good,

[21:07] then they can be like, I'm a VA.

[21:09] I can be doing this for you.

[21:10] That would be my script.

[21:12] OK.

[21:13] Yep.

[21:17] Do you have any email list?

[21:20] Yeah.

[21:20] So if you have any email list of over a thousand of them

[21:22] assume you do, you can take that list

[21:25] and then put a look like audience and start there

[21:27] as your targeting.

[21:28] Because that'll be the issue for you in the beginning.

[21:31] And make that the headline like home service providers.

[21:34] OK.

[21:35] 1.2 million in solar what now?

[21:39] 7 plus row as.

[21:41] Things are working.

[21:42] I'm going to tell you where are you?

[21:44] I'm going to tell you to spend more.

[21:45] All right.

[21:46] So what's the problem?

[21:48] We're expanding.

[21:49] But like you're attempting to set

[21:51] the new assets or just push the assets part

[21:54] that can.

[21:55] 8020.

[21:57] Maybe 0.7 about this has been 80%.

[22:01] Yeah.

[22:02] So Google already really experimented with this.

[22:04] So the technical one is the better one is 702010.

[22:08] So 70% is doing the main thing.

[22:10] So just the one ad that you have, 20% is adjacent to that.

[22:15] So as many different ways as you can think of versions of it,

[22:18] that's not that ad.

[22:19] So everything that I see as permutations of that,

[22:21] I see as the 70.

[22:22] A adjacent to that similar in style is the 20.

[22:26] 10 is just wild ass ideas of maybe this would work.

[22:29] And so that's how you allocate resources.

[22:30] And I'm being super real.

[22:31] So if you spend a whole day making ads,

[22:33] you spend eight hours.

[22:34] That means you're going to do one hour,

[22:36] 45 minutes on your one idea.

[22:38] And then you're going to spend two plus hours on adjacent ideas.

[22:42] And then the entire rest of the day

[22:44] is on how many different ways can I make the same ad per.

[22:48] And that's how you allocate times.

[22:49] The same way we allocate time when we make ads.

[22:51] We look up all the top winners.

[22:52] We start with all those.

[22:54] We hammer out all that stuff because that's our real work.

[22:56] That's the bread and butter.

[22:57] Then we move one.

[22:58] That way, I set it in reverse in terms of order for the day.

[23:01] But fundamentally, I want to get the 70 done first,

[23:04] the 20 done second.

[23:04] And if I've got time, I'm going to fail energy.

[23:06] I'll do the third.

[23:11] So $1.2 million in assisted living,

[23:13] Facebook and YouTube, they're getting 21 row ads.

[23:16] The thing that you guys should do is spend more money.

[23:19] Because you have eight spots left in your assisted living,

[23:21] and you're getting 21, and you should be OK with doing that.

[23:23] As long as you have capacity.

[23:25] If you know what you're rate of filling people up is,

[23:27] then you can dial the spend so that you can keep it so it's smooth.

[23:30] Now, if you're losing money every month

[23:32] that those things aren't full, then I would crank it

[23:34] and then turn it off.

[23:35] If you want the wait list thing,

[23:37] I would know that I only need three people or four people

[23:39] on the wait list that they have to pay in order to be on the wait list.

[23:43] Otherwise, it's not a wait list.

[23:45] It's just like telling someone to go away.

[23:46] And then assuming they're going to care about you

[23:48] when you call back, even though they've already solved the problem.

[23:52] Because they're probably in a market

[23:53] and one of you move within a certain number of months

[23:56] because someone's in pain when I say pain,

[23:57] it's a pain in the ass to do with somebody who's,

[23:59] you know, you're trying to put into that.

[24:01] And so that is what I would do if I were in your particular situation.

[24:05] And I would go get investors so you could open up more locations faster.

[24:09] Check.

[24:09] All right, ding ding ding.

[24:10] All right, so $10 million executive health,

[24:12] they're running YouTube ads, you're getting $10 to one.

[24:14] These guys are spending $1,000 a month to make $10,000 back.

[24:19] Even though they're doing a millionish a month,

[24:21] on their main business, that means 1% of their revenue comes from their YouTube ads.

[24:25] And the question is, how do we scale the main problem is compliance?

[24:28] And so they're in a health space.

[24:31] And so a lot of the issues in health, sometimes wealth,

[24:34] even relationships stuff, is the claims that you make

[24:36] and being able to support them.

[24:37] And so number one is there are firms that specialize in compliance audits.

[24:41] And so I go, like if we have an issue,

[24:44] like one of our companies happens all the time, right?

[24:45] Ads get chit-tanks, there's all these different automated things,

[24:48] even if you're doing nothing wrong.

[24:49] So you go to these firms and usually just ask them what their approval rating is,

[24:54] post-compliance.

[24:55] Usually it's 90% plus for the good ones.

[24:57] It doesn't cost that much.

[24:58] It's like five or six grand.

[24:59] And they'll go through the audit all the sites,

[25:01] the audit, all the videos and collateral that you use,

[25:04] so that then you can resubmit and they usually have some sort of internal Google kind of back door,

[25:09] where they say, hey, we will make sure these people are compliant.

[25:12] They relationship with Google.

[25:14] And they can make sure that you get pushed through.

[25:16] So usually, as long as you're not doing anything completely racy,

[25:18] which I'm guessing you're not, you should be fine.

[25:22] Great.

[25:23] $10 million roofing, PPC, so you want to expand.

[25:25] So you're spending $30,000 a month with ROS?

[25:28] $7,000.

[25:29] Okay, $71, ROS.

[25:30] $10 million a month roofing, doing PPC,

[25:33] wants to expand and you're in a local market?

[25:36] Okay.

[25:37] So if you were trying to expand there, first campaign I would run would be a retargeting,

[25:42] across all platforms.

[25:43] So I would be retargeting on GDN, so Google Display Network.

[25:47] I'd be retargeting on Instagram, a retarget on Facebook.

[25:51] I'd be retargeting on YouTube.

[25:53] Anyone who's done a site visit, that'll be the first and easiest

[25:56] ROS that you can get, because you've already paid for it.

[25:58] So we consider that like the shadow funnel, which is whenever you blow traffic

[26:01] through anything, you should always have global retargeting across all platforms,

[26:04] because then you can scoop up everything else.

[26:06] And it almost always is positive ROS.

[26:09] So number one.

[26:11] Number two, if I'd to pick another platform,

[26:15] I would actually give meta, because obviously PPC have super high intent.

[26:19] So the lead cloud is me lower on meta, because it's interruption based

[26:22] marketing rather than 10-based marketing, because people aren't looking for it

[26:25] when they're scrolling on Facebook.

[26:26] But a lot of older people are on meta.

[26:29] So Facebook, especially, but Instagram, too, Instagram,

[26:31] has got the whole gamut.

[26:34] And so people who have roofs, too, fix.

[26:37] And so I actually think it'll be fine that Facebook's aging up a little bit

[26:39] for you to run ads there, and since the average ticket so high in roofing,

[26:43] you'll probably good.

[26:44] In terms of the funnel, typically free audits are some sort of free thing

[26:49] is good enough.

[26:50] And you can talk to them about savings that they're going to make if they

[26:53] fix the roof.

[26:54] In terms of heating, cooling, all the other jazz that you guys do.

[26:58] And you can basically do that for free.

[26:59] You can sense them one out.

[27:00] You can do it virtually.

[27:01] And then probably two call close.

[27:03] So set close after the freebie.

[27:05] Freebie is the first page.

[27:08] Call thing is the second page.

[27:10] Call all people who opt in for the freebie to confirm the call

[27:14] that they did, and if they didn't book, set the call,

[27:16] and then close on the call that's actually booked.

[27:19] So if they book for Wednesday, call them anyway today, confirm

[27:23] qualify.

[27:24] If you don't have time to set it, well, you will have time

[27:27] because you're setting it, set it, and then close on the appointment

[27:30] on Wednesday.

[27:31] So it can speed up the sales cycle.

[27:33] Great.

[27:34] Real estate, long-term rentals, investment, interesting stuff.

[27:39] So row as is down, trust is down, unsurprising.

[27:47] And so the question that you have is how do you increase

[27:50] row as and build trust for this client?

[27:53] So there's two ways that I can think of.

[27:57] So one is making content long-term is what

[28:00] adds this what grows the organic audience.

[28:02] It's what allows a lot of people here to even have the business

[28:04] to have.

[28:05] And you'd be surprised.

[28:05] It is slower, but over time it does compound,

[28:08] and it becomes a pretty big stream.

[28:10] And if you know how to run ads and you can make content,

[28:12] that's what makes you a weapon.

[28:13] Because it's crazy when you can do both.

[28:16] Second thing.

[28:19] Focus more on proof, not on promise.

[28:22] Everyone makes promises, very people have proof.

[28:25] So if you think about this, this is a little sound

[28:27] bite for you.

[28:28] Your promise is not unique.

[28:30] Your proof is.

[28:31] Everyone in the marketplace promises the same thing.

[28:34] The question is whether they can back it up.

[28:35] And that is unique to you.

[28:37] And so if you want to have more unique place in the market,

[28:40] have more proof, not a different promise.

[28:42] Fundamentally, like all Jim owners want to make more money.

[28:44] Most business owners want to make more money,

[28:46] where they want to save time, or they want to save headache,

[28:48] or whatever it is.

[28:49] Like the promises aren't going to be that different.

[28:50] The thing that will differentiate you

[28:51] will be the mechanism, how believable it is,

[28:54] which will be a function of the proof,

[28:55] and the way that you're describing it.

[28:57] If you're like, oh, we have this brand new personal training model

[28:59] where you do six personal training sessions upfront.

[29:01] And then you get them into this and look at the economics

[29:03] behind people.

[29:04] Stay way longer.

[29:04] It's like, oh, that's a unique mechanism.

[29:06] And it's like, OK, that sounds like it's different than when I did.

[29:09] But how do I know it works?

[29:10] Cool.

[29:10] Here's 100 stores of people who are in your exact position that

[29:12] made it work.

[29:14] So proof is going to be the main thing.

[29:16] Now, the other way that you can build trust beyond the proof

[29:20] is I think group funnels right now work really, really well.

[29:24] I think that they're going to, I mean,

[29:26] the reason I invest in school, because I think that.

[29:29] But group funnels are routinely getting people

[29:31] from like $250, like $40, and I'm seeing this,

[29:34] like over and over again across industries.

[29:36] And so the way that these funnels work,

[29:38] already talked about the conversion mechanisms earlier,

[29:40] but you use the free group as a lead magnet.

[29:43] So that becomes the lead magnet.

[29:44] And the nice thing is that it functions basically

[29:46] like an email list with long-term nurture,

[29:47] but it's way more engaging than an email list is.

[29:50] And so people who use the group funnels right now

[29:53] just to give you a metric to this also for you for the groups.

[29:55] It's 10%.

[29:57] So the guys who do a good job convert 10% of people who opt in

[30:01] to the group into their next level thing.

[30:04] And so most people are able to close 30% to 50% of calls

[30:08] they get on.

[30:09] And so you can target getting on call with one-third of the people

[30:14] who opt in for the group and closing between 30 and 50%.

[30:17] So if you get on call with 30% and equal to 30,

[30:20] you get 10% of the group.

[30:21] Depending, obviously there's some flex on skill there.

[30:24] But that's kind of just some benchmarks

[30:25] that you can look at.

[30:27] But those are the three things.

[30:28] So add more proof, make more content, consider a group funnels.

[30:34] Boom.

[30:36] All right.

[30:40] Thank you.

[00:00] What's going on everyone?

[00:01] I want to share a one-on-one conversation

[00:03] they had with a buddy of mine from high school

[00:05] who just started his own business.

[00:07] And so he was texting me and he was saying,

[00:11] hey, you know, I've got this offer and my value ladder

[00:15] and I want to get your feedback on it.

[00:16] And before I looked at it, I said,

[00:18] you have a made a sale, right?

[00:19] And he was like, yeah, he said,

[00:20] I'm worried about being stuck with providing fulfillment

[00:23] because I'm just doing too much and I'm offering too much.

[00:26] And then, I was like, right,

[00:28] so you haven't made a sale yet and he was like, yeah,

[00:30] I was like, okay, you need to get over that.

[00:33] And I said, what's the price?

[00:34] And he said, 48, 110 weeks.

[00:35] And I said, listen, man, just give so much

[00:38] that you feel like the person would feel stupid saying, no.

[00:41] All right, don't try and fix your non-existent

[00:44] overwhelm fulfillment issue when you haven't even made a sale yet.

[00:48] All right, close a deal, then another and then another.

[00:51] And then once you are overwhelmed,

[00:53] you then have the, then you can start dealing with it.

[00:55] And the benefit is that once you've made sales,

[00:58] you will have the money from the sales

[01:00] do have resources to deal with the problem.

[01:02] And so this is something that I see all the time, right?

[01:04] People will, they'll try and solve issues

[01:06] that don't even exist.

[01:08] I have somebody like this example, right?

[01:09] He's like, I don't want to be overwhelmed

[01:11] with all this fulfillment.

[01:12] I'm like, dude, you haven't even made a sale yet, right?

[01:14] Sell the world, right?

[01:16] Sell everything you possibly can to get them to say yes.

[01:20] And then what happens is you're gonna start making money.

[01:23] And then at that point, you could start peeling back

[01:26] the things that take the most time

[01:27] that are not as valuable, but in the beginning,

[01:29] you just have to create flow.

[01:31] So one of the rules that I always have is create flow,

[01:33] monetize flow, then add friction, all right?

[01:36] In that order.

[01:37] So once you have demand,

[01:39] it means you're making a good offer of some kind.

[01:41] Then you are getting people to say yes,

[01:43] which means you make an offer that's so crazy

[01:45] that someone would be stupid to say no.

[01:47] And if that means selling your time,

[01:48] selling one-on-one stuff,

[01:50] doing the flying out to their house

[01:52] or driving over every day, whatever it is,

[01:54] even if it's unreasonable,

[01:55] stop thinking about scale before you've even had

[01:58] the ability to have a single sale, right?

[02:00] It drives me nuts.

[02:01] Because I'm like, dude, you're trying to solve a problem

[02:02] that doesn't even exist.

[02:03] It's like, it's like when I would have guys

[02:04] who come into the gym and they'd be like,

[02:05] hey, well, you know, I wanna get bigger,

[02:07] but I don't wanna get a big as you.

[02:08] And I was like, you're not gonna sneeze

[02:10] and fucking get jacked, all right?

[02:11] I was like, there's a million steps

[02:13] between where are you at and where I'm at?

[02:15] And believe me, it won't happen on accident, right?

[02:18] And so they're like, why don't you get,

[02:19] they're trying to solve problems that don't even exist yet.

[02:21] I was like, why don't you,

[02:22] why don't we start with making you look like you even work out?

[02:24] When we start there, fair enough, right?

[02:26] And the thing is, is like,

[02:27] why don't we start with you actually just getting a sale

[02:30] before we even talk about what you're fulfillment

[02:32] and optimizing for profit even looks like, right?

[02:35] And so, anyway, she sent me the big graph

[02:37] of like, what he's looking at,

[02:38] and I was like, it's fine, dude,

[02:40] just sell the world and deliver, right?

[02:42] None of it's gonna even matter

[02:44] because they're not gonna remember any of it.

[02:46] They'll just remember how they feel

[02:48] and how well you understood their problems, right?

[02:52] And if the solution felt unique,

[02:54] easy to understand and easy to believe

[02:56] that it would work for them, right?

[02:58] And so he was like, yeah, it makes sense.

[03:00] It's crazy how much of this has been like,

[03:02] just removing my own self-limbing belief

[03:04] and I was like, yeah, money's made in your mind first, right?

[03:07] Poor people have poor beliefs.

[03:09] You can't, if you're walking towards the door,

[03:11] right before you go and turn the knob,

[03:13] you envision yourself turning the knob.

[03:15] Everything happens in your mind

[03:17] before it happens in reality.

[03:18] And if you can envision yourself actually making money

[03:21] doing it, then there's no way it's going to happen.

[03:23] Poor people expect poor outcomes, right?

[03:25] Rich people expect rich outcomes

[03:27] and they don't accept outcomes beyond it.

[03:29] They don't make decisions

[03:30] unless they feel like that outcome is possible, right?

[03:32] And so what happens is, those poor beliefs keep people poor,

[03:36] all right?

[03:37] And so anyways, I was like, listen,

[03:38] stop obsessing over whether what you're gonna include

[03:40] or what the little offer stack is,

[03:42] I said, just give away the farm, right?

[03:44] Make some sales and then when you have money

[03:46] and a business, then you can worry about optimizing.

[03:49] But for now, you're solving around a made-up problem

[03:50] that doesn't even exist.

[03:51] You have no fulfillment issues

[03:53] because you have no clients.

[03:54] All right, self-first, over-deliver,

[03:56] and then optimize for profit, all right?

[03:58] And so this was just a process that I just see

[04:01] as a mistake that I see happen so many times.

[04:03] And if you were starting out, sell everything,

[04:08] sell the most insane offer you can possibly think of,

[04:11] get someone to say, yes, first, all right?

[04:13] And then get another person to say yes.

[04:15] And if you're like, man, I'm so overwhelmed,

[04:17] that's okay, you're supposed to be overwhelmed.

[04:19] It's normal, especially if you're starting out.

[04:21] All right, but you're gonna start learning

[04:23] how even to sell, right?

[04:25] And you're gonna start learning, okay,

[04:26] well, this is something that I'm offering

[04:28] that might have been really valuable in the sale,

[04:30] but is actually really easy to fulfill on.

[04:31] And something else that I promised I would fulfill on,

[04:33] they actually didn't care that much about it,

[04:35] but now it's taking you all my time.

[04:36] And over time, you can start peeling those people,

[04:38] pieces back and making it into an offer

[04:40] that's both profitable and attractive to the prospect.

[04:43] But when you're starting out, you don't know.

[04:45] And so the best thing in my opinion

[04:47] is to just stack as much valuable as possible

[04:50] to get them to say yes.

[04:51] All right, and so what that means is,

[04:52] you don't have to be exceptional at sales

[04:55] in the beginning, because what you do is you give something,

[04:57] you give an offer so good that someone feels stupid

[05:00] saying no.

[05:00] And so what I'll do is I'll wrap up with a story

[05:03] of how I learned this.

[05:04] And so when I was 23, I went to a conference

[05:11] and I paid $3,000 for a weekend conference,

[05:13] and it was $3,000 a money I didn't have.

[05:15] And it was run by a guy named Travis Jones.

[05:18] He went by TJ.

[05:18] And he was a business coach.

[05:19] And I remember when I was there,

[05:20] he'd offhandedly mentioned you made a million dollars a year.

[05:22] And I was like, man, I just want to be this guy.

[05:26] I'll do anything to be this guy.

[05:28] And everyone there was a business owner, except for me.

[05:30] And I was way over my head.

[05:32] They were talking about like CTRs, conversion rates,

[05:34] and cost for leads.

[05:35] And I was like, oh, no, what's going on?

[05:37] And so anyways, during one of the breaks,

[05:38] he came up to me.

[05:40] He saw that I was like way over my head.

[05:42] And he was like, hey man, do you want to know

[05:44] how the secret sales?

[05:45] And at this point, I was learning what the term sales meant.

[05:47] I didn't even know what it meant, really honestly.

[05:50] And I was like, yeah, yeah, like,

[05:51] tell me the secret sales.

[05:53] And so I like pull my notebook out.

[05:54] And I was like, I just like didn't want to like miss anything.

[05:57] And he said, make people an offer so good,

[05:59] they would feel stupid saying no.

[06:01] And for me, it was this huge moment.

[06:03] And I underlined it, I wrote down a circle of it.

[06:05] And it was at that point that I realized that I could still

[06:08] make money even if I wasn't good at sales.

[06:10] I just had to make an offer that was good enough

[06:12] that they would feel stupid saying no.

[06:14] And so I meant, if someone said no,

[06:15] I could keep adding things until eventually they said yes.

[06:19] And that was one of the biggest epiphanies

[06:20] that I had in my life was realizing that if I could just

[06:23] keep going and keep adding value eventually,

[06:25] they would say yes.

[06:27] And so instead of cutting prices, I would keep my price

[06:30] and just add more than anyone else could even imagine.

[06:33] So much so that it would be ridiculous.

[06:35] And I was willing to scale the unscalable

[06:37] in the beginning because I just needed people to say yes.

[06:39] And start the flow, get the flow monetize the flow,

[06:44] then add friction.

[06:45] And so it was one of the most important lessons

[06:47] in my life.

[06:47] It's one that stuck with me through my entire career.

[06:50] And in remembering this as I'm now getting,

[06:52] I'm having my friend from my school,

[06:54] I've got my neighbor who's starting their entrepreneurial journey.

[06:56] It's really reminding me of some of these lessons

[06:58] earlier on.

[06:58] And I just hope I hope you don't mind me just sharing them

[07:01] with you as we go.

[07:03] So anyways, keeping awesome, lots of love.

[07:04] I'll catch you guys soon.

[07:05] Bye.

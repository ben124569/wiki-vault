## Full Transcript
[00:00] I've eaten dessert virtually every night for 20 years.

[00:03] I have never skipped a dessert.

[00:04] And I've been able to maintain a six pack

[00:05] for that entire period of time.

[00:07] I have done a lot of different diet keto stuff.

[00:09] I've done high carb, done low carb, done high fat.

[00:11] I've done intermittent fasting,

[00:12] alternate day fasting,

[00:13] carnivore style, eating, whatever.

[00:15] The last 10 years, I pretty much eating the exact same way.

[00:18] Be able to have business dinners,

[00:19] be able to have drinks, many of the entrepreneurs

[00:21] that I know who've seen me eat

[00:22] and been around me a long time, end up adopting this

[00:25] and they never go back.

[00:26] What I'm not saying is this is the most scientifically

[00:28] researched, whatever.

[00:29] I'm just sharing what work for me.

[00:31] If something works for you, just keep doing that.

[00:32] Number one is you have to figure out what your goal is.

[00:35] You're trying to get bigger.

[00:36] You're trying to get smaller.

[00:36] From there, you start at number seven,

[00:38] all the way up to 21.

[00:39] My videoographers will put it right here,

[00:42] seven to 21.

[00:43] And every three, you go from extreme weight loss

[00:46] to moderate weight loss to maintenance,

[00:48] to moderate weight gain, to extreme weight gain.

[00:51] All you have to do is multiply your body weight.

[00:54] So I'm gonna use 200 pounds as my average

[00:55] cause it's easy with math.

[00:56] So let's say I'm a 200 pound guy

[00:58] and I wanna get leaner.

[00:59] I'm gonna go to moderate cut,

[01:00] which is the second from the bottom here of these three,

[01:03] which you've got 10, 11, 12.

[01:05] And I'm gonna stay 10 because it's easy math.

[01:06] And so I'm gonna multiply 200, which is my weight,

[01:08] times 10, which is this coefficient,

[01:10] which gives me, from a please, 2000 calories.

[01:13] All right, now if you're like,

[01:14] doesn't it change?

[01:15] What about my exercise and what if I have a physical job?

[01:18] Doesn't really matter.

[01:19] If you lose too much weight too fast, go to 11.

[01:21] You can adjust it.

[01:22] We've got 2000 calories.

[01:23] Great.

[01:24] Here's step three.

[01:25] You multiply your weight.

[01:27] 200 pounds again.

[01:28] You multiply it by one.

[01:30] Really hard math.

[01:31] Means 200 grams of protein.

[01:33] Some of the science and energy will be like,

[01:34] you can only metabolize 0.7 grams per,

[01:37] don't give it shit.

[01:37] Every pound of lean meat, white fish,

[01:40] ground turkey breast,

[01:41] 96, 4 ground beef, shrimp, whatever.

[01:44] A pound is 100 grams of protein.

[01:46] So if you need 200 grams, you need two pounds.

[01:48] And that's if you exclusively ate meat.

[01:50] I can eat over my one-gram per pound.

[01:53] I like eating protein.

[01:54] It fills me up.

[01:55] I feel good on it.

[01:55] That's why I do it.

[01:56] If you don't eat as much, don't.

[01:57] Now we're back to the math.

[01:58] This is the last math equation we're going to have to do.

[02:00] We have 2000 calories.

[02:01] And we know we have to 200 grams of protein.

[02:03] All you have to do is figure out what two pounds of meat

[02:06] you want to eat or where you want to get your 200 grams

[02:08] for protein from.

[02:09] And to figure out how many calories are in that thing.

[02:11] These two pounds of meat are both turkey.

[02:12] Eight turkey for both meals.

[02:13] Crazy.

[02:14] These are both five, 60.

[02:15] I know that that's 11, 20.

[02:16] That's how many calories I have of protein that I eat my day.

[02:20] So I subtract my calories associated with those meals

[02:22] from my 2000 in this example.

[02:24] And I would have 880 calories left over.

[02:27] Those 880 calories.

[02:29] Here's the magic of how this works.

[02:31] You can do whatever you want with them.

[02:33] If you need to go out to a business dinner,

[02:34] you want to have drinks.

[02:35] Cool.

[02:36] Well, cocktails are probably 150 calories.

[02:38] Have two of those and have a 500 calorie meal of whatever you want.

[02:42] Because again, you've already got your protein.

[02:43] You could just stay at home and have an entire point of ice cream

[02:46] that's 880 calories.

[02:47] Or you to these cookies is probably 400 calories.

[02:50] You can have two of them.

[02:51] And that could be your dinner.

[02:52] It doesn't matter.

[02:53] And why do?

[02:54] That's with a cut.

[02:55] That's with me trying to lose a pre-significant amount of weight.

[02:57] Now I actually maintain, because we're going to this third chunk, right?

[03:02] In this 13 to 15 chunk, if I multiply my body weight, I'm more than 200.

[03:07] But let's just stay 200 for a math sake.

[03:08] Time's 15.

[03:09] 3000 calories.

[03:10] So I would have an extra 1000 calories on top of that thousand

[03:13] if I did that same thing.

[03:14] Instead of having two of these cookies,

[03:16] I could have like five of these cookies for dinner.

[03:19] Or I could have two of these bites.

[03:20] And still have some food.

[03:22] I eat the same breakfast in lunch every day.

[03:23] I start my day with, let's call it a 200 calorie bar.

[03:26] You call it a brownie.

[03:27] It doesn't matter.

[03:28] If I'm traveling, I might not have this with me.

[03:30] And I'll grab up the quest bar at the airport, right?

[03:31] 200 calories and 20 grams of protein.

[03:33] One of those bars.

[03:34] And then I have a shake.

[03:35] And this is 30 grams of protein and 160 calories.

[03:37] I'm in for 360 calories for my breakfast.

[03:39] I got 50 grams of protein knocked out already.

[03:41] Then I go to my lunch.

[03:42] I have a pound of turkey, which we already know is five, 60.

[03:45] And I actually only have one of these guys.

[03:47] One cup of rice.

[03:48] I now have 150 grams of protein and 1140

[03:51] in terms of calories that I've eaten so far.

[03:53] I'm in for you.

[03:54] I have 3000 calories you just have to maintain.

[03:55] All right, not bad.

[03:56] So now I go to dinner.

[03:58] Dinner is the big flex meal for me.

[04:00] Now I also tend to eat a pound of protein and dinner.

[04:03] Do I need to?

[04:04] Absolutely not.

[04:05] Do I want to?

[04:06] Absolutely.

[04:07] I love eating protein.

[04:08] I feel good when I eat meat.

[04:09] If you did, let's say you were 150 pounds and you'd already eaten 150 grams of

[04:13] protein at this point, you're an entire dinner could be whatever you want.

[04:17] Pretty cool.

[04:18] All right.

[04:19] As long as it equaled out to the total amount of calories you want.

[04:20] And I do this also because then I'm full if I just eat cookies.

[04:24] This has worked for very long time.

[04:26] I actually had a couple of guys stop me and say,

[04:28] dude, you made this nutrition video and like I lost 50 pounds using it.

[04:31] Like, thanks so much.

[04:31] I get a bunch of DMs about this stuff.

[04:33] And so this is really what I eat every day.

[04:34] So if you're like, where is your greens?

[04:36] I have a multivit.

[04:38] And I continue to stay alive.

[04:39] And guys, I stayed away from fitness stuff most of

[04:41] because like there's all these armchair debates and like I just don't care.

[04:44] If you want, I can do a part two on how I train as an entrepreneur.

[04:48] It's different than if you were like a pro bodybuilder or a strong man or a

[04:51] par lifter or Olympic lifter or just a normal gym rat.

[04:53] I can make that a second video.

[04:54] Put in the comments.

[04:55] If not, just enjoy this one.

[00:00] This is brutally honest advice to my younger, less confident self.

[00:03] Having an epic story is about asking the girls about shooting the shot, about launching the business,

[00:08] about running the ad, about knocking on the door, quitting the job, taking the risk.

[00:12] When you're 85 years old and on your deathbed, you're not going to wish you a few

[00:15] of crazy stories. You're going to wish you a taking more shot. Don't build confidence,

[00:19] build evidence. Confidence comes as a result of evidence, not the other way around.

[00:23] Confidence without evidence is a delusion. It's you beating your chest, looking

[00:28] yourself in the mirror trying to pretend you're something you're not. Do it so you get the confidence,

[00:32] but don't think you need confidence to do it. To the whole idea, if they can until you make it,

[00:36] it should switch to walk it before you talk it. Prove it to yourself so you don't need to prove it to other

[00:42] people and let your path so you're talking for you. Until you win, effort always goes to notice.

[00:47] Get used to it. If you aren't willing to sucks, you're never going to get good. Losers, stay losers

[00:52] because they aren't willing to lose. Confidence is also domain specific. So you can be really good at

[00:58] public presentations and really bad at talking in girls. It takes a lot for a skill to transfer

[01:02] between domains. And so if you want to get good at the thing, don't try to do something to the

[01:06] last of it. Just do the thing. The first sales consult I ever took, I didn't close. And I say that

[01:12] because everyone just imagines that most of you just came in, just sling in credit cards and

[01:16] stacking bodies, right? It didn't work that way. I came in, it was five in a conversation. The

[01:21] girl was like, I need to go get my card from home and I said, oh yeah, okay, go do that.

[01:25] And she walked away and I went to my boss. He's like, how to go? I said, oh, I closed.

[01:29] And he was like, oh, that's awesome. He's like, you got the credit card. I said, oh no, she's going to

[01:32] come back with the card. And he literally, stop what he was doing with six other guys around him

[01:37] and they all nonstop laugh for a minute straight. Like they couldn't breathe because they thought

[01:43] how stupid would I have just said what? But I had no idea. And so that was my first ever experience

[01:48] in sales. I known for sales now and I wouldn't even say I'm confident in sales. It's just more like

[01:54] this is what works and has worked for me, take it or leave it. And so people perceive that as

[02:00] confidence, but it simply just based on experience. And confidence comes from experience.

[02:06] What it really is is a prediction what you think is going to happen will happen. And so even

[02:11] in statistics, what is your confidence metric? This is 0.7.08. It's literally just what the

[02:15] percentage likelihood that what you think is what it happens is going to happen. And so how do you

[02:19] increase the likelihood that what you think is going to happen is going to happen? Have it have happened already?

[02:23] I could have either spent 30 minutes every day looking at myself in the mirror and telling

[02:27] myself I was going to be a great sales guy or I could have reviewed the fucking script. Which one do you

[02:30] think would get make me a better sales person? Revealing the script. You can take all the time that you're

[02:35] trying to spend siking yourself up and you'll feel significantly more confident not having done

[02:39] that and simply knowing what you're going to say, which you get from practice. The world belongs to

[02:43] those who can keep doing without seeing the result of their doing. And the longer you can wait to see

[02:48] the result of your doing while still continuing to do is the extent to which you can win big in

[02:53] life. For example, to be a top 1% podcaster, you have to upload 21 podcasts. 21, top 1%

[03:00] 90% of people don't get past 1, 9% don't get past 20. And then 1% of podcasters of all of them

[03:08] make it to 21 plus. So when people say try harder, it usually just means don't give up. The price for

[03:14] excellence has never been so low. People give up so easily now that it's just so easy to win.

[03:21] By just being willing to post 20 times, you're in the top 1%, like I met the top 1%

[03:26] where I was on 10 to a top half. Top 1% people are so afraid of being humiliated. They get the

[03:34] long term humiliation of never amounting down anything. No one's going to watch you for 20 episodes

[03:39] anyways. And even if they do, it doesn't matter because that's not what you're building towards.

[03:44] Like you posting those 20 isn't what you judge yourself on. You should judging yourself on the

[03:47] difference between your first one and your 20th one. Are you better? Probably. And the difference

[03:52] between your 20th one and your hundredth one. Because the win is you. You were the asset you're building,

[03:57] not the downloads that you get on your first shot. Mozy immediately had a podcast with millions of

[04:03] downloads every single month. No, I said four and a half years, making two podcasts a week,

[04:09] straight. Didn't miss and guess how many podcasts downloads I was getting per month at the end of

[04:14] two to three thousand downloads a month. Not a lot. I used to think to myself, okay,

[04:19] well each one of these podcasts gets like 200 downloads. Well 200 downloads is like an auditorium of people.

[04:25] And so what I feel okay giving a speech to 200 people? Yeah. And even before that when

[04:29] they were getting like 10 or 15 downloads per episode, if I had a little lunch and learn that I would

[04:34] I used to have to do to like get leads for a business, I'd be fine talking to a group of 10 or 15

[04:39] people because the reality is that those people are doing me more of a favor than I'm doing them.

[04:42] They're literally giving me their ears so that I can practice my voice and how to talk and how to

[04:47] present. And it was only a year four and a half to five when things started taking off. And you

[04:51] were the two things that changed our one is I did call a change it from gym secrets to just the

[04:57] game, which was a business thing. So it made it more Apple, more people. And the second thing,

[05:01] here's the real one, is that I sold a company for $46 million. And so people were like, oh,

[05:06] what does this guy have to say? And the big thing that everyone misses is people trying to dissect

[05:10] my content. The message is 10% of how people consume it. 90% is the context around the message.

[05:17] So Elon Muskans can tweet on the toilet and be like, I'm on the throne taking a shit and it'll

[05:22] get a million likes. Why? Because it's Elon Musk's the richest man in the world and it's

[05:27] three of the biggest companies that are most innovative of all time. I don't kid myself and think

[05:30] they're like, my content is so much better than other people. There's plenty of people have

[05:34] better content than me. They don't get the same views. And the reason is because they don't have the

[05:37] context. They don't have the proof and solve for the proof and then the content will take care of

[05:41] itself. Because one, you will know what you're talking about because you have proof that you know what

[05:46] you're talking about and people will believe you, which is why you should solve for evidence

[05:51] above everything else. Like evidence gives you the confidence. If someone says, Alex, I don't think

[05:55] you know shit about business. I'd be like, okay, it doesn't really affect me. I do know we

[05:59] crossed $100 million dollars in that worth at 832. I know that. But if someone said that to you

[06:03] and you have an accomplice, you don't have anything to stand back on and it hurts you more. But I

[06:07] have proof. So it's like, you just deflect it towards the proof and keep living your life. The

[06:11] secret to longevity is especially in the content game, but really in any game that you're trying to

[06:15] at least help other people with is that if you've done the thing, you can be certain rather than

[06:20] confident. Be certain based on what you've done, not what's based on what you say other people should

[06:24] do. There used to be a too big defail and I think there's an alternative which is too good defail.

[06:28] If you make your stuff so fucking good that only one person gets exposed to it, sense it to somebody

[06:33] else, then you have nothing to worry about and you will eventually get discovered. It's a time game.

[06:38] And in the meanwhile, you just keep getting better, which is the point. Because the other day,

[06:43] you're going to die, everyone's going to forget about you anyways. And so you might as well just

[06:46] work on the one asset that you get to keep for the rest of your life, which is you. And rather than

[06:50] measuring yourself based on how many views he gets versus how many views you get, measure yourself

[06:55] by how much work he puts into one of his shorts versus what you put into one of your shorts.

[06:59] And then you might think the opposite is more reasonable. And if there's a top sales guy in your

[07:02] organization who's making more money than you, compare not what his commission check is to yours every month,

[07:08] compare how many calls he's making, how many times you practice the script, how many calls he's made

[07:12] before you, how many sales he's closed before you, what time a day he shows up at work, what time a

[07:17] day he leaves, whether he works weekends or not, whether he's willing to hop on the phone in

[07:21] a family context so they can still close the deal. If you're doing all the input, the math,

[07:26] the outputs will always match on a long enough time where I said. And if you are new to the game,

[07:30] then my recommendation is not only to match inputs, but to double or triple the inputs that someone

[07:35] ahead of you is doing. And the reason you do that is because if you just match your inputs,

[07:39] then you're always going to be behind them because they're already ahead of you because they're

[07:42] better than you. And so if you both do the same amount of work, they're going to keep getting

[07:44] better and so are you. So you have to do twice the work. You've got to be like Kobe, right?

[07:48] Where everyone else is doing one practice a day, you do two practices a day. And in the beginning,

[07:51] they'll be better than you. And then you'll match them. But because you're doing twice the work,

[07:54] eventually you'll get better and then that's how you win. And one of the biggest misnumbers in

[07:58] whatever endeavor you're trying to track is people track the wrong metrics. They track the lagging

[08:02] metrics rather than the leading metrics. Lagging metrics are what happened. Those are the outputs.

[08:06] And if you want to track those fine, but the real things to track are what you're doing to create

[08:11] the outputs. So I don't want to necessarily even track sales. I want to track how many calls

[08:15] I'm making. If I'm trying to get in shape, I'm not necessarily going to track the weight.

[08:19] I'm doing it. I'm going to track how many calories I'm eating. And so the more ways you measure,

[08:22] the more ways you can win. And so the idea, the ultimate win at life is where you can shift things

[08:29] that are out of your control that you're dealing with. To things that are under your control,

[08:32] which you can deal with. Because if you're measuring on whether you lost the fat or not,

[08:36] sometimes people take longer, some people don't, that's something that you actually can't control.

[08:40] Well, you can't control the inputs. And so if you say, based on this, if I do this one thing every

[08:46] day for a long enough period of time, I'll eventually get there, the real winners cut out the

[08:50] all eventually get there and say, if I do this every day, I have one. The thing that I try and

[08:54] focus on now is the delta between how hard I tried and how hard I can possibly try. And if I

[09:00] know that the gap between those two is zero, then I have one. And I've decided to spend an

[09:06] in order to amount of effort trying to make that my definition of winning is that there's nothing

[09:11] left in the tank. If you get into a harder career path or one that takes more reps to get good

[09:15] at or more reps to get into, then every day you can win based on saying like, everyone else does

[09:21] a hundred. I do 250 and I have nothing left to give. I won. And that should satisfy you. And if you

[09:27] are if you're obsessive on the external thing, that takes too long and you will give up too soon.

[09:33] One of the things that took me too long to learn was the difference in the finite and infinite

[09:36] frame. And so the finite frame is where you have known players, agreed upon rules, and away to win

[09:42] or lose at the end of the game is over. And infinite frame, you have known and unknown players,

[09:46] no agreed upon rules, and the point of the game is to keep the game going. And all the greatest

[09:50] games that I've ever participated in, marriage, health, business, you don't win at marriage. The point

[09:56] is to stay married. You don't win at health. The point is to stay in shape. You don't win at

[10:01] business. The point is to stay in business. And so by default, if you don't give up, you win.

[10:09] And so that's the big frame shift, which is why leaving everything on the field is the way you have

[10:13] to find winning. If you want to win in a long term, anything worth doing takes great time. If you stick

[10:19] with it and you make that the win, you'll notice that the external win will just happen on its own.

[10:24] And if you really commit to that perspective, it won't even mean much to you. Because if you make

[10:30] that everything, it's the same thing with the guys who win the gold and then kill themselves

[10:33] or win the championship and then go to these massive depressions, it's because they're playing the

[10:37] wrong game. When Kobe was asked, surely before he died, like, do you think that you're somebody who's

[10:42] afraid of losing or do you think your somebody who loves winning? He basically denied both frames.

[10:46] He said, I'm paraphrasing. I just love playing to the best of my ability. And that's what he measures

[10:51] himself off of. The fact that the world chooses to measure him on the fact that he's won so many

[10:55] games, that's the world's problem. Not ours. It's saying, I'm game master not a player and I choose

[11:03] to play by these rules and as long as I'm playing, I win by default. And it's because I'm not

[11:07] accepting the world's rules for winning, I make my own. And easier analogy here is, and this is

[11:12] a Navol-Ravicon quote. He said, what looks like work to other people should feel like play for you.

[11:16] If you look at an artist and he's painting, you're like, hey, how soon you're going to finish that

[11:20] painting? The point for the artist is to paint. He'll finish that piece and he'll start the

[11:25] next one. But the process of painting is the thing that they enjoy. And to the ideas that if you can

[11:31] commit and the broader you can generalize what you're committing to, the easier will be to stick with it.

[11:35] So you might be like, I love making calls, but I hate entering things from the CRM. Well,

[11:40] both of those are required for the role of sales. And so I prefer to chunk up a level and say,

[11:44] I prefer to do hard work because of what that work does to me. Then whether I'm putting shit into

[11:51] the CRM or adding a document or having a hard conversation, all of those things are difficult.

[11:55] And I see those is all contributing to the personally ultimately want to be,

[11:58] until eventually I die and it won't matter anyways. And so the only asset that you really get to

[12:02] keep with you is your character and that's the only thing you keep building. And so if you make the

[12:06] character, the W, at the end of the day, did or I did, I not contribute to the character of the

[12:11] person that I want to become. If that's the W every day, you can never lose. If you have your menu

[12:17] option of things that you can do in life, just remove quitting as one of them and then try your next

[12:21] idea. And if you are in that Rocky Cutscene and you are two months in, three months in. Remember

[12:27] that the Rocky Cutscene in the movie lasted a couple seconds and the Rocky Cutscene in real life

[12:32] my last few years. And so whenever I get to a low point where I think, why don't even bother doing this?

[12:37] I just like to remind myself, this is where most people stop and this is why they don't win.

[12:42] And as hard as this is going to sound, the best thing that I ever did was not listen to other

[12:46] people's opinions about my life. They don't want the best version of you. They want the

[12:51] version of you who best serves them. And unfortunately, the closer people are to you, the more

[12:57] similarly, they'll see themselves in you and the more your success will make them feel bad about

[13:02] themselves. And I can promise you this from somebody who might be a little further. I have more people

[13:07] who root for me now that I have already won than people who rooted for me along the way. No one is

[13:11] doing as well as you think they're doing. So buy comparison, everyone is better off than they think.

[13:18] Because the cumulative median visually is probably three times higher than what the actual median

[13:23] is. And so if you're like, oh, I'm average or slightly below average, compared to the perceived

[13:28] median of society, you're probably way above average. And that's okay. And being above or below

[13:34] average doesn't even matter anyways. Because you've got a lot of innings left. There's a lot of

[13:40] quarters left to play. And so like until the day you die, you still have hope, you still have a

[13:45] chance, you can still keep moving forward. Whenever someone gives you their opinion about what you should

[13:48] do with their your life, it's really them saying, this is my preference of how I want to live my life.

[13:53] And I say, great, live your life that way and all of my life, this way. Because me living my

[13:58] life has no effect on you. So live your life the way you want to live it. And I don't want your life

[14:03] either. They make those statements because they feel uncomfortable. And so they have to like release it.

[14:09] And so they say that to you to make themselves feel better. And that's their problem,

[14:13] right? You're worth. I think I've learned a lot of frames around not caring about other

[14:17] people's opinions, be out of necessity. Because I was so crippled by the opinions of other people

[14:22] for what felt like such a long time that I always had to face my death in order to get myself

[14:27] to move. And so I talk about death a lot because it has actually been one of the few things that

[14:31] actually motivates me to change my behavior. And so when I had done all the things that I thought

[14:36] would impress other people, one I realized that they didn't really care. And secondly, I realized

[14:41] that I deeply cared about how much I hated my life. When I was like, is this what winning feels like?

[14:46] Because if this is what winning is, then I don't want to play. By thinking I'd rather be dead,

[14:51] than continue to play this game, I was forced to change the game I was playing, which was like,

[14:55] well, what is a game that I would like to win it? Well, I'd like to win a game that is by rules

[15:00] that I set out and there are things that I can control. And then, those people, because you

[15:04] break their mold of what they're supposed to be doing and they might be miserable too,

[15:08] but they are not willing to take the risk that you're willing to take because they care about

[15:10] other people's opinions more than you do because they haven't gone through that little journey that

[15:13] you just went through. Fine. You do your way they do it there right? I mean, I went from

[15:18] prodigal son, my father super proud of me, graduating Vanderbilt and three years,

[15:21] president for attorney, vice president of powerlifting team, management consultant, to minimum wage

[15:27] employee. Like, that's a pretty significant drop in status. I have these frames because

[15:32] people will say whatever they want, but for me, that relative drop in status was a lot.

[15:36] I went from about as high status as you can get in a as a 22 year old to about as low status as you can

[15:42] get. I mean, I remember having people be like, so did you go to college? And I was like, yeah,

[15:47] I went to college and I fucking murdered it and I did everything and because the implied question is

[15:51] why are you here? And so that's what in the beginning hurt a ton, but then I just realized that they

[15:57] just didn't know and they were asking genuinely. And all of my judgment around that was just my own

[16:01] problem. How I'm perceiving this question is affecting my mood to such a great degree,

[16:06] what if I applied this to every question? All these people are asking me things and I mean,

[16:09] they're getting offended or getting complimented, but the statement doesn't change. So that sounds

[16:13] like a mean problem. And so the more I started diving into things like that, the less bothered

[16:18] I became by other one everyone else's opinion because they also have no context. Even if they

[16:22] did mean it as an insult. So why? If they're saying, well, I'm better than you. I'd be like,

[16:26] yes, you are. A lot of even really successful people frame their success around trying to prove

[16:31] someone wrong, right? But when you try and create your entire existence in opposition to someone,

[16:37] you actually give them complete control over your life. It means that because of the things that

[16:40] this person has said, I will choose to change all of my behavior, which basically means that the

[16:44] directors from that person have commanded you to do whatever you do. And if you'd like to be a

[16:48] free person and want to be somebody who acts of their own volition, then I choose to accept insults

[16:56] so that I can live my life rather than living in contrast to them and giving my control to the

[16:59] person who's all living. That would mean I put me changing your mind above my goals, which I don't

[17:06] know. My goals are more important to me than changing your mind. I'm super sensitive to I am

[17:10] statements labeling statements like this. Like I am a neat freak. I'm the type of person who. So whenever

[17:15] you're dating someone, you're getting to know someone people like to blank it. I am statements

[17:18] really early on to set the stage. Like I'm the type of person you like to drop early. I like to

[17:23] clean things. I'm a labeler. I'm a whatever. And then, and this is the insidious part, they then say

[17:27] becaus. And then they insert a reason that they made up or that sounded good in the past and people

[17:33] not in their heads and agreed with. Because my mom never loved me enough. Because I didn't get enough

[17:38] hugs. Because I give a speech once and everyone laughed at me. Because you don't know. And the reality

[17:44] is you will never know. All we know is that you do a certain type of behavior. That's it. By giving

[17:50] these because statements, all this power, you actually put all the power into something that is

[17:54] unchangeable in the past. And so you have to keep dealing with it. Whereas if you just said,

[17:59] I do these things. Period. Now if I want to change what I do, then I should just reward myself

[18:04] in the present for doing something different. And that makes it a lot more malleable. And it makes

[18:07] you your identity and what you do as a result or rather what you do and your identity as a result,

[18:12] something under your control. You don't want to blame the things in the past that you can't change.

[18:15] You want to blame things in the present that you can't. So if you said, I have trouble getting close

[18:20] to girls because my mom and I aren't close. One, you give your mother all the power in your love life.

[18:27] You give power to something that happened in the past that you can't change to things that are

[18:30] having the present that you can't change. And so would it be more useful to say, in the past,

[18:35] I have struggled to get close to girls. Period. Now that could be for a number of reasons.

[18:41] Thing is, is that you don't know what reason it is because I could say, let's say imagine all these

[18:45] things happen. You struggled with your mom. Let's say you had a bad breakup at someone in your life.

[18:50] You're not in shape. I could say, I struggled getting close to girls. And I could use any of those

[18:55] three as my reasons. But which of those serve me? None of them. All we know is that you struggled

[19:01] to get close to girls. Okay. We'll then just look at what it would take to get close to girls.

[19:06] And then do that rather than having this other thing that's attached to the behavior that you can't

[19:12] do anything about. It just makes changing who you are and what you do a lot easier. Sometimes,

[19:17] people are such douchebags. They will tell a young child you will never have a successful

[19:21] relationship with a woman because you don't respect your love thing. A mother or the reverse

[19:25] could be true of a father. They're a fucking douchebag for saying that because they are labeling

[19:30] you with something that you can't change. But that's their problem. It also is no basis in fact.

[19:36] When people are like, look at how the sun treats the mother. That's how he's going to treat

[19:40] his wife. Why the fuck would I treat my wife like I treat my mother? Dear God, look,

[19:45] that's just a statement that sounds good but has no basis in fact. You treat your wife like you

[19:50] treat your wife, you treat your mother like you treat your mother. They're different people. People want

[19:53] to have problems because it gives them a reason to suck and it be okay. It gives them ego padding

[19:59] so they can protect themselves for the reason why they're not successful. For the reason they

[20:03] haven't accomplished what they said they were going to accomplish and so they lean on their

[20:06] potential, comma and their trauma as the two reasons that people prop up. I've got lots of potential

[20:12] but I have all this trauma and neither of those matter. I've gone through three stages of like

[20:16] mental development in terms of how I see changing my behavior. In the beginning I attributed my

[20:20] behavior to my past traumas. The second phase was that I chose to change the story. What if

[20:26] my mother was just trying to feel better and it wasn't my fault? So then I changed my behavior

[20:30] in that sense. The third phase which is where I'm meant now, maybe there'll be a fourth phase but the

[20:34] third phase was I behaved this way period. The because statement in the second half is completely

[20:39] irrelevant. One because I don't know it too because I can't change it. So I might as well just choose

[20:43] to do the thing that I wanted to do. A relevant of my past. The single strongest predictor of my

[20:47] behavior is what will make the more epic story. I've thought about that frame a lot and it's

[20:52] still continued to win out and so when I'm forced to make a decision between two things,

[20:57] I prefer to choose the one that's the more epic story. Because either you have an epic story

[21:01] failure or you have an epic story of success but no 85 year olds were regretting their epic stories.

[21:06] They are regretting the story is the never told. Our minds are meaning making machines and they

[21:09] have to be because they create associations so many things we know and things we don't know and that's

[21:12] how we learn. The problem is that our brains will make wrong associations and then they will play

[21:17] us through the rest of our lives but we can just redefine what the association means for ourselves to

[21:21] make our lives easier. Because whether you miss the game-winning shot under the huge crowd or you

[21:25] miss it with no one else is there, the only reason it hurts more is because you choose to

[21:29] let it hurt anymore. Now there are things that you can do prior to the game-winning shot that

[21:32] can increase the likelihood that you make it, which is that you practice way more in-high-sticks

[21:35] conditions over and over and over again. If you do that increases the likelihood your confidence

[21:40] that you'll be able to make it why because you made them more. And if you're like why missed my

[21:43] first ever game-winning shot, now what do I do? When you practice in every other condition that's

[21:48] as close to that as you can until eventually you make one and then when you do make one you'll

[21:51] have evidence that you've made one and you try and make one again. What you probably don't know is that

[21:54] Michael Jordan has missed more game-winning shots than he has made. But he's remembered for the

[21:58] ones that he made, but how is he able to make them? I miss it and being willing to shoot again.

[22:02] On that basis of story, the many excuses that we give ourselves in reverse can make

[22:07] a more epic story. And so rather than say like these are all the reasons that I can't succeed,

[22:12] I think reframing that is these are all the reasons that when I succeed it'll even even better

[22:16] story and it'll be more inspiring to other people as much more powerful frame. The more

[22:20] disadvantage you have when you start the more epic story you have when you win. Donald Miller

[22:24] has one of the most powerful frames of Heroes and Villains I've ever heard of. Heroes and Villains

[22:28] always have the same backstory. It's pain. They're always an orphan, right? Or the villain has some

[22:34] sort of disfigurement to show that they went through hard times. The difference is what the character

[22:39] chooses to do about it. Villains say, the world hurt me, I'm gonna hurt it back. Heroes say, the world

[22:46] hurt me, I'm not gonna let anyone else hurt this man. So Heroes use pain, villains are used by it.

[22:52] And so I think all of us have the choice to become our own heroes, our own villains, our own life.

[22:56] Simply by how we choose to do with the pain that we all inevitably experience. So pain is a constant.

[23:02] The choice about how we react to it is the thing that dictates the path of our lives. You know,

[23:06] there are certain rules of playing the game that have served me really well. One of them is,

[23:13] and that's okay. And I probably use that frame more than anything else, which is,

[23:19] I'm not close with XYZ relative, your parent, your mom, your sister, your brother.

[23:25] And that's okay. I spent a lot of my mental effort trying to untangle stories that I told in the past

[23:31] about things that were my fault or were a problem. And the easiest way that I found a soft

[23:35] problem is to decide they're not problems to be able. I have a handful of pictures that I took for the

[23:40] first five years of sucking during business. And I use those pictures all the time every day.

[23:48] And the zillions of pictures, after I became successful, I barely use any of them. The time to

[23:53] document your life is when it sucks, not when it's great, because those are the stories that you're

[23:59] going to tell. And those are going to be the reminders that you use in the present day of things that

[24:04] you have been through and prove as to who you really are. Because my favorite line in the matrix is

[24:09] in the second or third matrix. When Morpheus is standing on the hill and he's looking at

[24:14] towards everyone and he said, I stand here truthfully unafraid, not because of the path that lies

[24:19] performing, but because of the path that lies behind me. And so the struggle period that you may be

[24:24] in right now is the path behind your future self that you are building so that that man or that

[24:30] woman can stand on the pulpit and look at you straight dead in the eyes in the mirror and say,

[24:35] I'm confident and I stand truthfully here unafraid, not because of what I said my goal is going to be

[24:40] but because what I've been through to get here. And so here's my advice to my younger self.

[24:44] Document your life more. Otherwise you'll forget the details and the details are what make it worth

[24:49] remembering. It's the time you're sleeping on the floor. It's the time the person walks out and you

[24:53] miss the seventh sale that day. It's the time when you're bank accounts at its absolute lowest.

[24:57] It's when your car breaks down on the side of the road and you're like, what am I going to do now?

[25:00] I can barely afford this. Right? Those are the moments, the ones that you want to ignore,

[25:04] the ones that you want to look away from that other ones that you need to capture because those are the

[25:07] moments that you will tell in the future of things you got through because no heroes are heroes

[25:12] without epic monsters and the bigger the monster, the greater the hero.

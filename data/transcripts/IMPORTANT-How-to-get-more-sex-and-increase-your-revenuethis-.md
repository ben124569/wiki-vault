[00:00] Most of the nation, what is going on in this video, what I want to talk to you about is a hot take that I had on people who complain that their business is not growing enough and yet see everything as though people owe them something.

[00:15] And so I did two videos or three videos a week for three years and you know, everyone, you know, you have some bombs, you have some great videos and this is a among the top 1% of videos that I made in terms of the number of people who shared it like to comments and all that stuff.

[00:29] And it was in a private community and I want to make a public to you guys. And so this video truly will show you the frame of mind and the perspective from which to see customers success increasing lifetime value.

[00:39] How to ultimately provide more value than everyone else does from a framing perspective and it applies to sex, it applies to business and it applies to life.

[00:48] And this is one of the hottest take videos you see if I share any numbers in the video, it's because it was in the past, that's why if you see a discrepancy, that's the difference.

[00:55] So anyways, most of the nation, there's a lot of people broke, I don't want you to be able to vote. That's why I make these videos keep being awesome. I'll see you guys in it. Enjoy.

[01:02] What's up everybody? Happy Saturday. Oh man, I've got a good one for you today.

[01:07] I am, this is even one where I looked at Leyla and I was like, oh, I'm gonna have to take a walk on this one.

[01:12] It's kind of came to me and I was thinking about it and it's just like, man, it's this one kind of philosophy.

[01:19] So we have five court tenants at Jim Lunch rather than go through all of them. I'll tell you one of them is and it's own it.

[01:26] That's one of the five court tenants that we have and if you are curious about what, why you have those, you make court tenants so that you can always reference them back for yourself.

[01:35] And for the employees that you have, so you can say like, this is how we make decisions, right? And you can always look back at that and be like, this is who we are, right?

[01:42] So, own it is one of them and this is so good.

[01:46] A lot of people get really upset about their customers who signed for a 12 month membership and then quit after three months, right?

[01:54] And I'll hear the same people trying to get out of franchise agreements that are five years long, right?

[01:59] And saying, this is BS I haven't gotten the value, they didn't give me what they promised they would give me, right?

[02:05] We're being real talk. And so one of the things and one of the ways that we've, so we have, on a ridiculously ridiculously, like almost zero,

[02:13] turn on our highest level groups. Our most expensive group, we basically zero turn. And if you were to tell, like, if you were to ask anyone, or somewhere ask us like, how are you growing this fast?

[02:24] All this stuff is that honestly, I think it's just because I'm incredibly insecure, deep down, and I have this huge fear of rejection.

[02:33] So I don't want anyone to not like me and I don't want anyone to feel like I'm not giving them what I, what I said I was going to give them.

[02:39] And it's like, it's a serious fear of mine, probably rooted in security. If you can shift your perspective from thinking from, well, I just got the contract, we're done to like, we just got the contract, oh shit.

[02:52] Now we have to fulfill on this, right? The way I see my relationship with the gym lords group, I see it as a week to week.

[03:00] Like, you guys are on week to week with me, unless I perform, unless I provide value, like everyone's gonna leave, right?

[03:07] Now obviously you need to be discerning, you need to be wise, you need to protect yourself with the contract, that goes without saying obviously, right?

[03:13] And you have agreements that are there. But if you ever rely on your business because of contracts, you will lose, always.

[03:20] Because at the end of the day, people will do what they want to do. If you rely on contract, your life will be living hell.

[03:26] Because then people are like, well, if you like, you trick me and all it, like, if you live on contracts, your life is gonna be about contracts.

[03:33] And all about you, I don't want my life to be about contracts, right? You can go even deeper with this, okay?

[03:38] So when, like, I married Leyla, I honestly had this feeling, we both had the conversation like literally the day, like the night of our marriage, and I was like,

[03:46] I was like, I was like, we can't mess this up. I was like, this is it. I was like, you're the one I committed to.

[03:52] If anything, I was like, I was like, I just don't, I was like, if we ever have issues, I was like, we got to confront her immediately, it's like, because we're in this, right?

[03:59] If you treat your marriage, right, you've got that contract, you're like, I got a contract, you gotta be with me, right?

[04:05] And you treat your marriage, like you treat your customers, I got a contract, you have to stay here, you have to pay me, you will lose, and it's life will suck.

[04:12] But if you consider it as week to week, like, I consider us day to day, and I used to make that joke when we were dating, people were like, are you guys committed?

[04:19] Like, in a relationship, this is right before we were married, I was like, we're month to month.

[04:23] She hated it, but the joke for me, served the fact that like, you're only as good as your last paycheck, right? You're only as good as your last day, and the moment you rest on your laurels, the moment you get lazy is the moment someone else who's hungrier will take you, right?

[04:36] And that could be someone who's hungrier who takes your wife. Now obviously we have commitments, we have sheer principles that we never want it like, we believe in the, I don't get biblical on you, but like, we believe when you get married, you stay married, right?

[04:47] That's the goal and that you can always make it work with anyone, right? That's our belief and those are one things that we checked on each other before we got married, right?

[04:54] But that being said, if you look at what the Bible says, right, and this is disparage, but the marriage and business are so similar, because you have to do the stuff sometimes you don't want to do and you got to be consistent, you got to do it every day.

[05:05] You can't just say, hey, great job this week, and then not say anything for two months to your customers, right?

[05:10] Same thing with the marriage. I can't just be like, hey, babe, thanks for making dinner, once a month, and she makes dinner every single day, right?

[05:16] She crashes it, she's awesome, ladies are free, she's amazing. If I could run our business away, well, she kind of runs her business, but the point is, if you're losing customers and you're like, all these people are flaky, no one commit, no one ought, like, and you want to get into victim mindset of like lamenting customers, right?

[05:35] They're people, and people will always be self-serving, you can always count on it.

[05:41] I'd have meant to tell me that, is like, if you always predict that people will act in their own self-interest, he's like, you'll always be right.

[05:49] And I've always thought about that, I was like, wow, is it going to predict the future, predict them, predict that they will act in their own self-interest, forget what they say about principles, forget what they say about anything.

[05:58] And so what you want to do, if you like, which is why you should always align relationships, so that how their best interest is with you, right?

[06:06] So like, I have to make legacy, so freaking good, that their best interest is staying in paying me, right?

[06:13] I'm being super real with you. And so if you're customers, right, at your gym, keep leaving, and you keep saying, no one's like, no one honors their word anymore, no one doesn't even like, be asked, man, like, you probably didn't honor your word, right?

[06:27] Because you're no longer in their best interest anymore, and they tell you that by leaving, right, by having high turn rates. That's how they tell you that, that's how the market tells you that you're not being good enough, right?

[06:37] And so despite signing the 12 month contract, it's not signing the 18 month contract, whatever it is, live week to week.

[06:45] Live workout to work out because the real contract that they have with you is for today. And the moment that one of your employees gives them lip, or says something, or says something rude, or doesn't show up on time, or the bathroom looks like shit, or their music is the same playlist they've heard every single time they go to your gym, they're gonna leave.

[07:03] That's it, they'll come up with their reason, they'll say they got busy, they'll, you know, like, work, or they're moving, they'll come up, their friends, a doctor, or nurse, they'll get the fake note, it doesn't matter.

[07:15] Someone wants to leave the relationship to leave. If your wife wants to cheat on you, she'll find a way, so you don't want that. So it's like, I gotta make this so good that you don't want to look anywhere else.

[07:26] You think that you'd be crazy to look anywhere else, right? And they've, like, I want my wife to go out and be like, someone's like, if some guys like, hey, like, you know, come on, you know, she's like, do you know what I have at home? Like, you're a fool.

[07:39] You know what I mean? If you think that that's gonna get me, right? Like, your game is so low, you have no idea what I have, right? So they see a gym advertising for something else.

[07:48] They're like, you have no idea of my gym. Like, you have no idea how my trainer's treat me. You have no idea how I feel when I walk into that gym every day, right?

[07:57] How those people can make me feel. And so if you think about your relationship with your customers as you're only as good as yesterday, you're only as good as today.

[08:09] That's it. That's all you've got. And so every time you have to resell them, like, I sell Leyla every single day on being with me every single day, because I love her to death.

[08:19] And I want, I want this to be awesome forever. I do. And I know that, I know that in order for that to happen, I can't just appreciate her once a week. I can't even appreciate her once a day.

[08:30] I tell her every, like, every moment on, baby, I love you. I'm like, you're awesome. You're so good. I was like, you managed our team so well. I could never do this without you.

[08:37] And it's true, right? And so if you look, no, here's another one. Ready for it? You've got your employees. Everybody's got their employees. Everybody's got their employees. Everybody's complaints about their employees. My employees don't work hard enough. They don't care about my customers. They don't care. Well, how are you showing up as a leader? How investors are you and them? Do they feel like my trainer left with all my customers? They left with them. They left with them. Because it was so bad with you that they had to look somewhere else. It was so bad that they had to leave.

[09:06] And so it's like, how can I make this exchange? Fair exchange. How can I make this exchange even abundant exchange? As in they get more than what they get from, I give more than I get, right? How can I make this an unfair advantage?

[09:19] That's how you have a value discrepancy. That your script needs to keep people. People are like, people don't go to Chipotle because it's worth $7. People go to Chipotle because they pay $7 and they get a $20 meal. That's why they go to Chipotle. That's the secret.

[09:33] I'm all about raising prices. But I'm all about being 10 times more valuable than my price, which is three times more expensive than everyone else.

[09:40] And never, ever, ever, ever, ever taking it for granted. I don't take your attention for granted.

[09:46] I don't take the fact that you pay us every week for granted because I know that there's always somebody who's going to come after me and try and be better than us.

[09:54] And I have crazy insecurity in thinking that like tomorrow could all be over. And I never want that to happen.

[10:02] And so if you think about that with your customers, you will always be ahead of your competition.

[10:08] Like we're constantly innovating because I'm like, shit, everyone's going to copy my stuff. Everyone's going to copy the stuff I came up with last month.

[10:14] I got to make new stuff. I got to make new stuff, right? And when I'm concentrating on my customers and on my competition, right?

[10:21] Then I make shit, right? Because I want them to stay. And I'm thinking I'm only as good as my last paycheck, right?

[10:29] I can only provide for Lila if I provide for you stuff that makes you money for real.

[10:34] Anyways, so this is a walk and talker. I thought I would just give you a little Saturday morning love as I get some fresh air and so-called enjoy so-called weather.

[10:47] But I love you guys. So if you guys don't have amazing marriage, amazing business, amazing relationship with your customers, amazing relationship with your employees,

[10:55] don't ever think about what you've done. Because they don't. People don't. Humans don't. Right? We don't remember what we did.

[11:02] We don't remember all those things like every time I can't tell you how many times my life is taking the trash out. I always remember when I take it out, right?

[11:09] We always remember what we do, but we forget what everyone else does, and we forget that they forget what we did. And we think that it's wrong that they forgot.

[11:17] When in fact, we just have to do more again today, right? Because you can't change anything else and I can't change how they're going to think.

[11:23] And so you can either lament how human beings are, or you can react and win. And just adjust, right? You can just adjust. So all you gotta do is just know that everyone's going to forget.

[11:35] No one will honor their vows. And if you think about life that way, you will never be surprised in business. If people leave you, then take it as a sign. I'm doing something wrong.

[11:44] Right? If there's some discontent in the marriage, take it as a sign. So it'd be like, she doesn't appreciate me. Think about how I can appreciate her more.

[11:51] Right? How can I make things better for her? So she wants to stay. Right? So she gets excited. She doesn't want to like, she's no energy anymore. Like, okay, cool. We want to we have energy.

[12:00] Why don't I make her dinner once? You don't know what I mean? Or whatever, whatever that person's lovelang, which is, I might get too deep in it like on the marriage side. But like, you gotta fill their needs.

[12:10] Customers and employees too, like, especially, especially since we're selling service. Most of us are selling service.

[12:17] And if you're selling service, you need to fill the person's needs otherwise. They're not going to fill the needs of your customers. Right?

[12:24] Are you investing in them? Do you want them to grow? Are you giving them the things that they need to move on and become rock stars? So anyways, I love you guys. I hope you guys are having an amazing, amazing day. And we can't hope you found this valuable.

[12:36] As always, thank you very much for your attention. I know that you have many things to spend your attention and eyeballs on. And I'm honored that you decided to spend the last few minutes with me on Saturday morning.

[12:45] Lots of love guys. If you're a gym owner and you haven't joined, I promise we can help make you a bunch of money to make this business a lot easier for you. So lots of love guys. Talk to you soon.

[00:00] There are four big levers in your business that could be messed up.

[00:03] I'll show you how to figure out which one it is and how to fix it so you can scale your business.

[00:07] We had those four levers that I had earlier.

[00:08] We've got traffic.

[00:09] We've got conversion.

[00:10] We've got price and then we've got churn.

[00:12] So there's the big four things.

[00:13] And so if we want to grow the business,

[00:15] those levers have to change or the business will not grow.

[00:18] And so for many of you, it might just be you need more traffic.

[00:24] Like the business model is fine,

[00:26] the economics are fine, and you need more traffic.

[00:29] And so basically, at least my thought process that I have with this is I try and scale

[00:34] as much as I possibly can until something breaks.

[00:37] And then when it breaks, we fix that thing and then go back to scaling the shit out of the

[00:42] again.

[00:43] I mean, fundamentally, that's what we do.

[00:45] And I mean, I teach this for businesses, but I'll walk you through it.

[00:50] What is going to go to these four levers that we talked about earlier, right?

[00:54] Which is going to be your traffic.

[00:58] Your two F's there, whatever conversion, which is you tweaking your bout page,

[01:02] making a VSL that's better adding carousel images, tweaking the bullets that you have

[01:06] in your landing page.

[01:07] You've got the price, which you can test.

[01:10] And then you've got churn, right?

[01:11] Which has a big list of things that you can do.

[01:13] So these are the four levers.

[01:14] So the things that you're doing have to ladder up to one of these four.

[01:17] If it doesn't ladder up to one of these four things, why are you doing it?

[01:19] All right.

[01:19] So like, if we were to translate your objective with the free group,

[01:22] you would have to say, okay, I think that the us reactivating the free group will increase

[01:27] traffic.

[01:28] That's fundamentally what you do.

[01:29] You want this traffic source to make you more money from your to towards your ticket

[01:33] or high ticket thing.

[01:34] And you say, okay, how much work will take me to reactivate this group?

[01:39] Okay, is there anything else that could get me more traffic than reactivating the group?

[01:43] Of the things that I have available.

[01:44] So right now, could me just spending more money on ads or making better ads make us more

[01:49] than me spending the time to reactivate the group.

[01:51] If so, forget reactivating the group, make better ads.

[01:54] We're spending more money on ads.

[01:56] So make sense.

[01:57] So once you figure out, and when we're picking which of these three things or four things

[02:00] that you're doing, the thought process is which of these is the biggest constraint in the business.

[02:05] And so if conversion rate, let's say, for example, on the landing page is super low,

[02:09] then it might mean like, hey, before getting more traffic, I'm going to, I think I can double

[02:14] my conversion on this page because I haven't really spent any time on it at all.

[02:17] Okay, well, then it makes sense to spend a day or two.

[02:19] Like, can I really clean this up and make it as Chris, especially possible with the language

[02:23] that I use?

[02:24] Can I grab screenshots that are more meaningful?

[02:26] That, like, you probably had more testimonials, things like that.

[02:29] You haven't updated.

[02:30] Can I put that on there?

[02:31] Can I make an actual three minute VSL that is more compelling than the one that I just

[02:35] like tossed up there?

[02:36] Okay.

[02:37] That's probably a day of work.

[02:38] Well, it's probably high leverage because I can double the growth of the business by just

[02:41] improving the conversion metric.

[02:42] Pricing, like, well, if everybody just pays you more, we already went through that example

[02:46] over here.

[02:47] This guy obviously making more money.

[02:49] And then you have your big list of things that you're doing for churn.

[02:51] And so, cool.

[02:53] Which of these is the biggest thing that's going to train in the business?

[02:55] You pick the one that you're working on.

[02:56] And then, for me, I tend to think through this.

[03:02] More, better, new.

[03:06] And I tend to do it in this order, most of the time.

[03:10] So, like, I will just ask when we're portfolio is like, why can we not just do more

[03:15] of what we're currently doing?

[03:16] Like, whatever we're doing, why can't we just do more?

[03:18] So you'd have to make an argument to me that we should react to be the spirit

[03:21] rather than just spending more money on that.

[03:23] And you have to make an argument that it's easier and it will make us more money

[03:25] than spending more money on that.

[03:27] And if you can't make the argument that we're like, well, then forget about it.

[03:30] If we can't do any more for whatever reason, we have some limitation.

[03:33] We can't post more than twice a day on Instagram.

[03:35] Like, we just can't.

[03:36] Or we can.

[03:37] And just like, if we've seen that when we post three times, it doesn't, doesn't

[03:39] need to do the same performance.

[03:40] So, too is kind of the sweet spot.

[03:41] Fine.

[03:42] All right.

[03:43] Then, what can we do to make it better?

[03:44] Right?

[03:45] Okay.

[03:46] Because if we can make this two posts just higher quality overall, can we like really think

[03:48] through the hooks?

[03:49] Can we make sure that they're tied that they appeal ideally to the audience?

[03:52] That we're looking for.

[03:53] If we do better, then the quality of the traffic will go up.

[03:56] The more views will go up.

[03:57] To make sense.

[03:58] Now, if we can't do any more any better, then we need to try something new.

[04:01] And you notice that most of the times you can do more of what you're doing, you can do

[04:05] what you're doing better, which is why I so rarely do new things.

[04:08] Once you have something that works, that's the hard part.

[04:10] Once it works, it's like, how do we scale the living crap out of it?

[04:12] And the reason that most not for me to do my opinion, especially small ones, gets stuck

[04:14] is that they find something that works and then they stop doing it.

[04:18] And then they get distracted by six other new things.

[04:21] Then they get completely spread then.

[04:23] And it's been like, what's ironic is that the small business owner is the one who has

[04:27] the least amount of leverage.

[04:28] And you have the basically your contribution, your time, contribution to the income of the

[04:33] business is more direct than anybody else is, especially at this level.

[04:37] And so like you're like saying, okay, I'm going to take a third of my time.

[04:40] That might just be like decreasing your business by a third.

[04:42] So you have to have a very sharp, which for why that's going to make sense.

[04:46] And then for who once you have a team, then that becomes the next thing.

[04:49] It's like, okay, we know we aren't increased traffic.

[04:51] The way that we're going to do that is like we can't do more posts on Instagram.

[04:53] So we're going to make them better.

[04:54] And this is the process that we're going to focus on getting better, which means that once

[04:57] a week I'm going to take three hours and I'm going to script out.

[05:00] I'm going to look at other people's content that have really good hooks.

[05:03] When I write down all the hooks.

[05:04] And then I'm going to make content that I think is going to appeal to my demographic

[05:08] and a better way.

[05:09] Cool.

[05:10] Now, who's going to be, if it's you, then you're the who in a lot of these, if the business

[05:15] is bigger, then it's like, okay, Jeremy, you're running this.

[05:18] And then we just measure to make sure Jeremy does a job.

[05:21] That makes sense in terms of thinking through this.

[05:23] And so we just want to make sure that what you are doing is going to map to what's going

[05:27] to drive growth within the business.

[05:29] And I swear to God, so many times, people are just doing shit that does not map to this.

[05:35] Okay, reds over.

[05:38] One more question on that.

[05:40] The first four is there like a certain priority that you would recommend for like, I'm

[05:44] a solo operator.

[05:45] I'm doing like 50 a month.

[05:46] Yeah.

[05:47] He is the offer.

[05:48] Is there like one of those big four that you would recommend prioritizing first?

[05:51] Start here.

[05:53] Because this is how you have life-load in the business.

[05:56] So you have to promote.

[05:57] You have to acquire customers.

[05:58] Once this is relatively consistent, even at a low level, I then, this is me how I think

[06:02] through this.

[06:03] Now, not when I was younger.

[06:05] Normally, I would just be like, just do as much of this as you can for get everything else.

[06:09] Now, it's doing enough of this so that we can keep working on how do we, how do we find

[06:15] the things that people actually want versus what we think they want?

[06:18] And then there's a thing that we can remove.

[06:19] Like, how can we delete things?

[06:20] How can we make this simpler?

[06:21] How can we make it more elegant?

[06:22] How can we shorten the models that we have?

[06:25] I mean, we're hiding classroom for new people.

[06:27] Like, think about this.

[06:28] Like, we remove three calls a week.

[06:30] Like, we're trying to take things away.

[06:31] Not because we don't want to add about it's easy for us to add the value.

[06:34] It's, but we want them to consume it.

[06:36] And so consumption should be the highest priority for everybody here.

[06:39] In terms of making, like, how do they get value?

[06:41] They have to consume value, right?

[06:42] To consumption should be the highest priority.

[06:44] And so we start here until you have enough flow going through the system that we can see

[06:51] what they really want.

[06:52] And a lot of times these simple things, like the last mastermind, I think we went through

[06:55] a ton of depth of all the things that you can do to reduce chart, right?

[06:59] It's like, so you experiment with that.

[07:01] And this might be months while you're doing this.

[07:02] I mean, for context, school didn't hit like a, like, let's go hyperscale until, like,

[07:07] recently, in this was years, right, of getting the product right.

[07:10] Like, obviously, like, there's people coming in every day.

[07:13] And there was enough promotion that we basically, we could test and keep learning.

[07:17] But it wasn't like, we don't want the world to find out about it yet because we want

[07:20] to get all these pieces right.

[07:22] Once these pieces are ready enough, then you go back here and you scale a little bit.

[07:27] Boom.

[07:28] Yeah.

[07:29] That's great.

[07:31] So right now, the question for you is, if you have really low turn, I don't know if you do,

[07:36] but from what you were saying, it sounds like you have to return, then, then yeah, do more traffic.

[07:41] Yeah.

[07:42] Do more.

[07:43] Do better.

[07:44] I want your currently doing.

[07:45] So you're running ads?

[07:46] Yeah.

[07:47] Do you spend more?

[07:48] It's been more making better.

[07:49] Top 20% of my best customers targeted towards them.

[07:51] Now, they'll have that insight and then just keep making that better and then just more.

[07:55] More better.

[07:56] And then just spend 400 grand a month on that.

[07:58] Yeah.

[07:59] Sure.

[08:00] I mean, it's like an inside joke in my business.

[08:03] Like, he's going to just say more better.

[08:05] So yeah.

[08:06] That's just quarter.

[08:07] Just like we did last quarter.

[08:08] Just like we did the quarter before.

[08:09] We're going to do more.

[08:10] We're going to do better.

[08:11] And if we do this, things will probably make more money.

[08:12] And then if there's something that prevents us from doing more better, then we fix that,

[08:14] and then we go back to more better.

[08:16] Does anyone have questions about what they need to do for this?

[08:20] Like, you need your like, okay, am I?

[08:22] Should I be spending more money?

[08:23] Well, if your out TV is good in terms of your and your, and your cat is low, then yeah,

[08:27] I just keep spending.

[08:28] I guess for like low ticket communities, you know, recently we had a video where we went

[08:33] to like seven things like go hand riddle letters on boarding, ex-again reviews.

[08:37] Yeah, for communities on school, like which one of these would you go after in the

[08:40] first career field, like you have even more insight?

[08:44] With you, the price sounds like the thing that's moving at them.

[08:47] Say, girl, the price, okay?

[08:50] Because you've already experienced what that's doing.

[08:52] All right, you know the average is around 20.

[08:54] You probably want to be on the good side of that.

[08:57] So figure out why you're not like, now I would talk to your customers first.

[09:02] Like, why did you cancel?

[09:03] Do you want to talk to the people that can't, so do you want to talk to the people

[09:06] that stayed and you want to figure out what differences they have?

[09:10] And then if you find the people that stayed, did these things emphasize those things?

[09:15] If you find the people that left to do other things, remove those.

[09:19] And so it might not be price.

[09:20] I'm just, yeah, it about you told us.

[09:22] So maybe it's price.

[09:26] So like balance that.

[09:29] And then, you know, with your traffic, you can drive more of that.

[09:35] And then you can play with about page conversion, you can play with that.

[09:39] And then when your board of those go back to retention, I know I can drive like easily

[09:44] way more traffic is just that I have a leaky bucket.

[09:46] So I want to fix it.

[09:47] So I'm like, wondering if I should add onboarding or, you know, onboarding, I think for sure

[09:52] is a good idea.

[09:53] And how would you, because you got for a little to get you do a group onboarding and

[09:56] everybody who signs up gets one group onboarding, then you will tally do it once a week?

[10:03] Yeah, I think people throw a lot of shit in the community and then they just keep adding.

[10:07] And then they think they need to keep adding to make it better.

[10:10] But it's not true.

[10:11] Like, overwhelming is the main cause of churn.

[10:13] Think about the experience.

[10:15] So how many things into classroom would you say is like the sweet spot?

[10:18] Because I've read not like eight maybe.

[10:23] But honestly, the hardest part I found when improving anything is to figure out what's

[10:26] actually wrong with it.

[10:28] That, well, I've been working on the school games fun, or recently, by the way, almost

[10:32] would be happy about this.

[10:36] I figured out like what the problem, to try to figure out what the problem was was actually

[10:40] quite difficult.

[10:42] But in that was my, it was this guy I knew from New Zealand, who's a complete stoner,

[10:48] that had text me when home mostly, when homozy launched the games, he couldn't understand

[10:54] what it was.

[10:55] And I was not going to try to explain it to him.

[10:58] But when we came back to making this, improving it, I was like, they turned out that

[11:03] he was the best signal for it, actually.

[11:06] What the fuck is the school games?

[11:09] I wrote it down.

[11:10] There was the problem.

[11:11] If you didn't know what school was, you have, and you see an ant from home, I was in

[11:14] a police home at the school games and some leaderboards and coming to face, people don't

[11:18] know what the fuck that is.

[11:21] So I wrote down what the fuck is the school games, and I was like, that is the problem.

[11:25] So, but that took me a lot of research to like find, right?

[11:31] I was talking to a lot of people, I was doing this with Kirby.

[11:34] It's quite an interesting process, right?

[11:36] And then we will, okay, well, how do we describe this damn thing in a way that is

[11:41] make scenes to like, stone a dude?

[11:44] Because it helps to use extreme cases, like Steve Jobs tested products on children, because

[11:51] like if they could understand it, anyone could understand it, right?

[11:55] So like defining the problem and then coming up with different ways you could solve it,

[12:01] I've been doing this with Goose and Kirby in the office all week.

[12:04] We probably designed, we came out with many different ways to describe what it is, many different

[12:09] landing pages, many different bullets, and we just kept talking to users, getting feedback

[12:15] and kept iterating it.

[12:17] We probably made 30 versions.

[12:20] Some of them were so wrong, I wondered what kind of tangent.

[12:25] You'll never see it.

[12:28] But you know, we actually, at the end of about one week, we landed on something, and now

[12:34] everyone we show it to instantly gets it.

[12:36] And so like we don't actually have to fully launch to find out, when you learn how

[12:42] you can use everyone to get feedback and talk to people and show it to people and get

[12:46] the reactions, you can do a lot of fast iteration cycles without the harshness of like reality.

[12:53] Then when you launch it into reality, you have a way better chance, right?

[12:59] So that's how you improve anything.

[13:01] Like that's not the games, but that's what we were doing to the games recently.

[13:06] Kirby was doing interviews with all of the winners.

[13:10] That was overwhelming, not many people were showing up.

[13:12] So we cut there.

[13:13] We just did one Kulmoziku and A-Wik.

[13:16] Right?

[13:17] Attendance is up, viewing is up, people are now saying that it's way more valuable.

[13:25] And you know, so it's, we were unlocking the one day recordings after you got three

[13:31] customers.

[13:33] Well, like, why are we making it hard to get the most valuable thing?

[13:37] Now you just need three members.

[13:39] They can be free.

[13:41] Right?

[13:42] So like, what do people value?

[13:43] How do we make more people experience that?

[13:46] What do people not value?

[13:47] Take it out?

[13:48] What do people not understand?

[13:49] Reward it?

[13:50] Do you see?

[13:51] It's all the same.

[13:53] But I will emphasize what Sam is saying is that there's a, it's so much more work than

[13:58] you expected to be.

[13:59] And everyone wants like the one silver board that you're going to magically fall on it.

[14:02] And if it were obvious, you would have already done it.

[14:05] And so it's like, it's disguised.

[14:07] And that's what, I mean, this is literally what makes business hard.

[14:10] And so I'll have a business owner on a Q&A call say, like, what should my price be?

[14:14] And I'm like, I don't know.

[14:15] I'll walk you through the process of how I'd figured out.

[14:17] But I don't know your avatar.

[14:18] I don't know your traffic scores.

[14:19] I don't know the value, proper community.

[14:21] And even if I did, I would say I'll start here.

[14:24] And I'm going to do the math and I'll move it.

[14:26] And I'll do the math.

[14:27] I mean, with a portfolio game, the same thing I'll start.

[14:29] It was like, we tested 50, 35, 25, 15.

[14:32] And just tested it.

[14:33] I was like, I don't know.

[14:34] We'll find out.

[14:35] And then they were all the same.

[14:38] And then I was like, OK, well, which business would I prefer?

[14:40] And then we go into that.

[14:41] And so just in terms of thinking through things, like the amount of effort that goes into it,

[14:46] that most, I would say that, like, as I've gone, as I've gone, moved up in business, my understanding

[14:50] of the level of effort that you're required to solve complex problems has gone up

[14:53] 100x.

[14:54] It's just to significantly harder to solve more complex problems.

[14:58] And that's also why the biggest pay days are on the other side of this problem.

[15:03] Because if they're really easy to solve, they're going to worry solved it.

[15:06] So it's like four hours in a cup of coffee and a bunch of data, and you're like, let's try

[15:10] this.

[15:12] There's a quote I learned from the software engineers at school.

[15:15] They say you have to make every detailed perfect.

[15:19] But the only way you can do that is to limit the amount of details that you have.

[15:23] So inside of the school games, we have eight videos.

[15:26] All of them together are less than 45 minutes.

[15:28] One course.

[15:30] We do one cool per week, and that's it.

[15:32] Then once in a month, you get it down from here.

[15:36] The mastermind.

[15:37] That's it.

[15:38] Very easy to explain to someone.

[15:41] One call.

[15:42] One course, one mastermind and a month.

[15:45] And there's 13,000 people in that, each paying 99 out of up.

[15:50] And they get the school software.

[15:52] That's a question.

[15:55] So there's a fine balance between, because if you're a leader of a big community,

[16:00] right, if you're showing up too much, you kind of almost lose your power, right?

[16:05] And if you do Q and A's every single day, nobody will want it.

[16:10] It's not special.

[16:11] So how would you balance Q and A calls, making polls inside of the community, and just

[16:16] showing up and like giving people attention like that?

[16:20] Sure, there's a data answer for this rather than me just guessing.

[16:23] We could probably find it out and like what the best, you know, cadence is.

[16:27] I'll tell you, I personally, I think post twice a month in school.

[16:30] That's not planned.

[16:31] I just, I just kind of poke around and I see what people are talking with.

[16:35] I made that niche post because I was really tired of people like, what's mine?

[16:38] niche going to be about.

[16:39] And I was like, here's how you find your niche.

[16:42] And so it's just like, I just listened to what was the, like, there's, you probably

[16:46] noticed this in your community.

[16:47] It's probably like a problem to your.

[16:49] It's like people just kind of globble into a single problem all of a sudden.

[16:52] And like, I feel like I was seeing more and more of that.

[16:54] So I was like, all right, I'm going to try and answer this.

[16:57] And so then you make that and then it's like, hopefully.

[16:59] And if it does, if you put the thing in and then that problem still exists, then you

[17:03] didn't do it right.

[17:03] So it's like you have to do it again.

[17:04] You have to make it simply, you have to make it easier whatever it is.

[17:07] You keep doing it until that one goes away.

[17:08] And then like the next problem will occur.

[17:10] And the good news is that your customers will always have problems.

[17:13] Yeah.

[17:13] And so you just solve them.

[17:15] I can tell you a good thing that works for me.

[17:19] So I spend a lot of my time reading what people are saying like, I'm trying to

[17:24] understand what things people are struggling with.

[17:27] So I'm not in there just posting a lot.

[17:29] I mean, they're listening the most more than anything else.

[17:33] Most would be like 90, it would be like a lot of time has been listening.

[17:38] Trying to figure out what is going on.

[17:41] What should I improve?

[17:42] What problems is the community facing, right?

[17:45] Then when I'm pretty sure I've got those problems,

[17:49] I'll even talk to some values as an old validate.

[17:51] Do you think these are actually problems, right?

[17:55] And then I'll make sure I'm clear on the problems first.

[17:57] Okay, now if I spend now prioritise them, what is the most,

[18:01] what is the most pressing problem?

[18:03] Okay, number one, now I'll just focus on that.

[18:05] At least I know if I just fix that, I'll add some value, right?

[18:08] Yeah.

[18:09] So now I'll try to fix that.

[18:12] And I will try to fix that by research, experimentation, etc.

[18:17] And then I'll come back to my community and say, hey,

[18:19] I sorely, you guys will face seeing this.

[18:22] It sucks.

[18:24] I fixed it.

[18:26] Here you go.

[18:29] And then it's how I like that.

[18:30] That's how you add value.

[18:32] There's no like I have this little template on my wall for emails,

[18:35] which is, uh, have made this thing for you.

[18:38] Here's what it does.

[18:41] Enjoy.

[18:42] Like CT.

[18:43] Like that's like, that's why you're not to play.

[18:45] Like this makes it really simple.

[18:47] Like, yeah, you guys were struggling with this thing.

[18:48] I made this for you.

[18:49] Here's why it's important.

[18:50] Goodbye.

[18:51] The hard part is finding the thing.

[18:53] Yeah.

[18:53] Like I said, how do we make the school games funnel better?

[18:57] Well, what's the problem with it?

[18:59] That's the real question.

[19:02] And it was some stone adude who had the answer.

[19:04] Little fact.

[19:05] Yeah.

[19:06] So you wouldn't have a schedule of like posting daily or second,

[19:10] like every second day or definitely not.

[19:12] Yeah.

[19:13] That's like a Henry Ford production line for community.

[19:17] Like, we're not trying to pump out posts fast.

[19:20] That's not what makes it.

[19:23] But it's not that it's not a good community.

[19:25] A good community is something that

[19:28] understands your pain and experience and delivers solutions and is fun.

[19:35] Yeah.

[19:35] Yeah.

[19:36] Yeah.

[19:37] And isn't overwhelming.

[19:39] And doesn't make me read five articles a day.

[19:43] Right.

[19:43] Like, they're loom posts.

[19:44] Yeah.

[19:46] Because I don't want to read a buddy article that's

[19:47] some pain in the ass.

[19:49] Like, I want a solution.

[19:52] Or I want to laugh.

[19:54] What have them?

[19:55] Yeah.

[19:56] I'm doing 17 lives a week in my page at the moment.

[20:00] So yeah.

[20:02] But my feeling is telling me to put it in the free community.

[20:05] But I mean, that might be stupid because I'm trying to list

[20:06] or you guys saying, you're saying no, we're just doing one now.

[20:09] And it's like, some of it, the fuck.

[20:11] Yeah.

[20:12] I think if you want to use all that like all that.

[20:14] So last game's a ton of people, I think it was last games.

[20:19] That was like, it was like the live game.

[20:20] So it was like, everybody was doing like Instagram lives.

[20:23] Might have been a lot, maybe two ago.

[20:26] And the thing is, is like, we have to separate promotion from delivery.

[20:29] So from a promotion perspective, you're doing lots and lots of lives.

[20:32] You're making lots of posts.

[20:33] You're making all the stuff.

[20:34] Lives in the air.

[20:35] I don't understand.

[20:36] I got shit.

[20:36] And so my point is, is like, I would take all that energy

[20:39] and put it into promotion.

[20:42] So you get way more people into your community.

[20:44] And then the thing is, is that if you do 17 lives a week,

[20:48] externally, it's okay that people don't consume all of them,

[20:52] because if they consume one of them, then they might buy.

[20:54] Whereas if you're inside of the community, you're doing 17,

[20:57] they might be like, oh, I'm missing out on 16 out of the 17.

[21:01] I'm not getting the value.

[21:02] If it's free, your cost is time.

[21:05] And so as long as you deliver a return on the time that they spend

[21:08] consuming your content, then they got they have a positive exchange with you.

[21:12] And so you basically, it's like, you can never promote too much.

[21:15] You can't put too much inside of the community.

[21:17] And so I would take some of that juju and put an extra and I'll let you drive more through the box.

[21:21] I think Hums actually did like the opposite, like when he increased the daily coffee

[21:26] to like, new every day, his channel like reduced massively.

[21:30] So I have no idea.

[21:32] I used me to do me like every day.

[21:35] And trying to figure out all kinds of things around the

[21:39] channel at the moment.

[21:42] I might answer to him when he kept coming up with ideas.

[21:44] My answer to him was talk to your customers.

[21:46] I've recently just pretty public about this.

[21:48] Is that like, I widened my content for I think either three or six months.

[21:52] I like started sprinkling in some other other pieces.

[21:54] I talked about how I eat and like,

[21:57] like, you know, how late when I run, you know, being married and things like that.

[22:00] And the the the problem is that you do get positive reinforcement from it.

[22:05] And so it's like he made some stuff on relationships and then people were like,

[22:07] oh, this is awesome.

[22:08] But the thing is is like the wrong people were saying it was awesome.

[22:11] And so what's happening is my audience was growing what it was growing with the wrong people.

[22:15] And so I had, I mean, I had this moment where like sometimes you have these like,

[22:19] I had a friend of mine coming to, I don't know, friend of Quaid and so I'd say flu and

[22:24] and it was like, um, he probably does 10 million bucks a year.

[22:27] And uh, and he was like, yeah, you know, um,

[22:30] yeah, I don't, I don't listen to too much of your stuff anymore and he's like, yeah, I was hardcore for like six years.

[22:34] Um, and then I, I just kind of, um, I guess I didn't really apply to many more.

[22:37] He's like, I guess I'm not really like your avatar.

[22:39] And I was like, you're 100 most fucking avatar.

[22:42] Like you are exactly who I'm going after.

[22:45] And then I was like, oh, I'm a moron.

[22:48] And I just basically it's like you, you get, you get,

[22:52] it's a balance.

[22:52] Like you want to listen to customers, but you also want to make sure you're listening to the right customer.

[22:55] And so, um, I reoriented all my, my content,

[22:59] which maybe some of you guys have seen.

[23:00] Um, and it's been a hundred percent back to business.

[23:03] Has been the theme that we have internally.

[23:04] My guys now.

[23:05] Um, is that if it's not business, we don't make it.

[23:07] Just very straightforward.

[23:08] Like it can be business adjacent.

[23:09] So like if I talk about, you know,

[23:11] prioritizing the like tasks in my day that can have some element of productivity into it.

[23:14] But it's like, all my examples are going to be business related.

[23:16] And so, but by doing that,

[23:19] when I looked objectively across metrics for

[23:22] psych conversion, opt-in, book sales, applications that portfolio,

[23:26] all of those metrics went up.

[23:28] Even though the average view per video went down.

[23:32] And so it's like, I'm not in this to get famous.

[23:34] I'm in this to make money.

[23:35] I have a question.

[23:36] Um, I wonder if anybody has, I have this might be for everybody, but like, has anybody

[23:40] done anything to when they do have a turned customer to get them back into being a customer?

[23:46] Or you do.

[23:46] See the funny gift.

[23:48] Or just like, send a funny go.

[23:49] In a deem, ask credit penner, you have you seen him?

[23:53] Yeah.

[23:53] Ask him for his message.

[23:55] He's apparently got some message.

[23:57] He deems people with the funny gift.

[23:59] And it gets people to react to for it.

[24:01] He says it's something like weaving so soon.

[24:03] He's kind of like the vibe is kind of...

[24:04] Yeah, but you want to get the funny gift.

[24:06] Of course.

[24:06] Okay.

[24:07] And it's just within school.

[24:08] Yeah.

[24:09] Okay. So no email, I'll ask him to ask or even like,

[24:11] are still steam has that for ghosted leads?

[24:14] They have a Kevin Hart.

[24:15] I mean, that's like...

[24:16] I think that might be it.

[24:18] Yeah.

[24:18] I think that it's what he's used.

[24:19] Yeah.

[24:21] And yeah, it like it gets high response rates than any message.

[24:25] This is kind of for both the probably you've sampled with,

[24:28] definitely.

[24:29] But I guess like when you're building, you know, a startup.

[24:33] Obviously, you know, you might have, sometimes I might have a little bit

[24:36] lack of capital, a little lack of resources.

[24:38] I guess how do you get aid players to work for you and with you?

[24:43] And how do you like structure,

[24:45] constructures and all that?

[24:46] So they like.

[24:47] The vision for the business has to be big enough that smart people can fit their

[24:50] dreams inside of it.

[24:52] And so if you want brains, then you need people who

[24:56] like they need to be able to believe that their dreams can come true within your

[24:59] vision.

[24:59] If it's again, if it's like, yeah, we just got a couple of groups that were running

[25:02] and were making money that it's like, that doesn't like really get me motivated.

[25:07] If I'm intelligent, I'm like, the best people have,

[25:09] there's no lack of opportunity for best people.

[25:11] They have tons, like, you have to think about this.

[25:13] It's a totally different game.

[25:15] Like, if you're accustomed to taking people, like, I really want to job.

[25:18] All of those people are irrelevant.

[25:20] You have to be people who are like, in some ways, you're competing for them.

[25:24] So the more you're competing for a prospect, like, selling them.

[25:27] And so if you feel like, like, I'll tell you the funny one,

[25:29] is like, if you're interviewing people where you're like,

[25:32] sell me on why I should take you.

[25:34] If you say that to somebody who's actually really talented, they'll be like, I'm good.

[25:41] They just like, they just don't risk like, I, you have to respond to this offer within 12 hours.

[25:46] It's like, okay.

[25:47] I think you have to nail right there for me.

[25:50] Like, their vision has to be part of his needs to be big enough.

[25:53] You have to be able to say, like, what we want to do is we want to make music money into

[25:56] these standard for this.

[25:58] And then they have to believe with a decent amount of certainty that it's possible.

[26:02] And so like, how you guys present, like, you are absolutely selling them.

[26:07] And so like, I think I can drew this about on a past one, but

[26:09] everybody here understands, you know, lead generation, lead nurture, sales,

[26:15] onboarding, and then, you know, retention ascension.

[26:18] Right? That's the, how you do with customers, right?

[26:21] This is the exact same process for an employer.

[26:23] You generate applications, you nurture applications, the sale is the interview, you onboard the

[26:28] employee, and then either retain them or send them.

[26:31] It's the same thing. And so you basically have to understand the act,

[26:34] it's like, this is when we get into scaling, because everyone's like, two or three people are like,

[26:37] what's scaling? It's just where the inflow of talented the business matches the inflow of

[26:42] customers into the business. And you have to have an acceptable conversion process for attracting talent.

[26:48] This is where brand counts double accounts, once on the front end for customers, and again,

[26:53] on the back end for talent, it becomes either a virtuous cycle or a vicious cycle.

[26:57] Either destroys your business, you have a bad brand, because what do you think,

[27:01] what, like, what, um, like, great talent will look at your reviews and be like,

[27:05] oh, yeah, never mind.

[27:08] And what are we going to get to?

[27:09] So I guess in the last question, I guess what will be the best way to like a choir talent

[27:14] as a just building a personal brand, like in our field of work, because I don't think it's necessarily,

[27:20] I can't, I don't feel like I can find the right people on LinkedIn or something like that.

[27:23] You know, for what we're trying to do, and these are the people who are kind of like,

[27:25] all we're already kind of entrepreneurs or people who are in where like the cells or manage it,

[27:30] manage your field.

[27:31] If you really depends on what role you're looking for, but I can promise you that various smart people are all

[27:35] like done.

[27:36] Do you know how I, um, I looked, I got invited to speak at something.

[27:42] I looked at who I was speaking there and I saw how Mozi was speaking there.

[27:45] And I was like, there's my opportunity.

[27:49] As a first time we met in person.

[27:51] Yeah.

[27:51] Honestly, so good.

[27:52] How long ago was that?

[27:54] One year before I spoke about doing a deal, but you have to like be strategic sometimes.

[28:02] Yeah.

[28:03] And then so you have to kind of do this old school networking thing, which I fucking hate because

[28:11] they're like the only time I've ever done that.

[28:13] The whole thing was like the one deal to never do that again.

[28:18] But yeah, you kind of have to do that.

[28:21] I had to start going to like these software things.

[28:24] I had to start to meet some software engineers.

[28:27] I had to learn about their world.

[28:30] Ask people about why does what to hate is a software engineer.

[28:34] What do you like?

[28:35] What makes a good company?

[28:36] What makes a bear company?

[28:37] You have to like learn everything about it and network and do that.

[28:43] It really sucks, honestly.

[28:45] But if you're serious about it, I knew there was no way I could build school without this person.

[28:49] So I delayed starting it by a year just to find the person.

[28:55] Yeah.

[28:56] So I'm not even going to start until I find them.

[28:59] Like that's how a scene should line you.

[29:01] They win.

[29:01] That's why it's all everyone does not do software.

[29:04] It's just because the scale of how difficult it is to actually do it right is so hard that like

[29:10] no basically no one does it right.

[29:12] Even if you know what you're doing, most people can't do it.

[29:15] And most people who are quote in the info word are like, oh,

[29:18] my info thing is insoluble.

[29:20] So I'm going to build software and they just think that like white lately

[29:22] and go high level means they had a software company.

[29:25] Like, but I mean,

[29:28] right, or they create some widget that someone else can duplicate in five seconds

[29:32] that they did off with an off-shore developer that like if it actually did work

[29:36] then that developer would hold you around some of them then why?

[29:38] Like they just don't play it out two steps.

[29:40] And the code should anyways and it's all that all sucks.

[29:44] Like it don't do it.

[29:45] Yeah.

[29:47] And so when we're like, you're just, you don't want us to succeed.

[29:49] That's what because you're doing stuff.

[29:50] I was like, no man, I saw that.

[29:52] Same with put five years and I was like, great.

[29:53] Okay, I saw the metrics.

[29:55] I was like, okay, this is legit.

[29:56] I mean, all my money and it still wasn't enough.

[30:01] I had to spend like twice that again.

[30:04] Yeah.

[30:05] Yeah, that's for that too.

[30:05] By the way, that's going to help a lot.

[30:07] Yeah.

[30:07] I'm good this for real.

[30:08] Yeah.

[30:09] I mean, the personal brand thing is just good for recruit.

[30:11] Like if you have one, it's great.

[30:12] It helps a lot.

[30:13] Yeah.

[30:13] Yeah.

[30:14] But at the end of the day, if the, if the, if the business that you're trying to build

[30:18] solves a real problem and you really genuinely care about the problem

[30:21] if you find someone else who also cares about that problem they will be more likely to work

[30:25] with you like that's fundamentally it.

[30:26] And what do you, sorry last question.

[30:30] Fun.

[30:31] Well, you think about creating an offer to train people to do what you are trying to

[30:38] eventually staff for like, I'm growing.

[30:41] Yeah, like, you know, like in, yeah, you know, like there was a point.

[30:45] There was a point in time I had a closer program with training closures and all staff in them.

[30:47] You know what I mean?

[30:48] And then I was, I stopped the net because there's so many closer training programs.

[30:51] But right now, I really need growth partners.

[30:53] People who can lead and manage our clients and kind of oversee everything.

[30:57] What do you think about like, I know there's a growth operator thing, but they're not, you know, like,

[31:01] in my mind like they don't have all the skillsets.

[31:04] That's certainly what if someone, you know, created a program to train people.

[31:07] I don't think you can create another business to solve a rule.

[31:10] Okay.

[31:10] Depends if it's like, I know with a software engineer,

[31:15] no one's going to be any decent in 10 years.

[31:18] Maybe a prodigy in six or seven, but like, there's just no shortcut in it.

[31:23] Like, I mean, my co-founders done 20.

[31:27] So the years matter and the same is true with a lot of things like,

[31:33] there's just years.

[31:34] So like, but some other things might be different, like sitting, okay, here you can teach them.

[31:39] Closing you can probably teach that.

[31:41] But these more high-level strategic things,

[31:46] yeah, they don't happen in like, it took me fucking 10 years.

[31:50] So are you going to wait 10 years?

[31:53] No.

[31:54] Yeah, it's just like fundamentally every skill is trainable.

[31:57] The question is whether it's worth a return on effort,

[31:59] the resources to train someone with it.

[32:00] If you break things down enough, you can train someone to do anything.

[32:04] It's just that if someone has zero meta skills, they don't know how to read.

[32:08] They don't know how to write.

[32:09] They know how to talk.

[32:09] You could teach someone to do all that stuff.

[32:11] It's just why bother.

[32:15] So I'd rather take someone who's already here and then just nudge them if I can with,

[32:19] you know, proper training, but just bridges the gap between all of the skills they come in with

[32:22] and then applying that to my business.

[32:24] You got it.

[32:26] Oh, appreciate it.

[32:27] Yeah, always.

[32:28] I mean, the people is the reason that most internet marketers in general can't make money.

[32:33] I'm sorry, they make money, but they don't make like,

[32:34] like, big money.

[32:35] Is that they just can't, they can't, they don't know how to operate people.

[32:39] And that's usually because they need like a right hand, a true right hand, who can,

[32:43] who's as good as them.

[32:45] And like, Laila will never get the credit that she deserves and that's fine.

[32:49] But like, the reason that all of our stuff is so big is because she's so good at building.

[32:57] Like, she's an unbelievable builder.

[32:59] And so like, the culture of the team is rock solid.

[33:01] I mean, the guys will tell you, like, Laila really runs the, like, Laila runs at

[33:05] with their stock.

[33:05] Like, I really, like, she really does, she does.

[33:10] Like, Laila runs everything.

[33:11] Like, I mean, I told you I'm an empty calendar.

[33:14] I can't have an empty calendar and and also have a business that's running

[33:17] unless someone else is actually doing it.

[33:18] Laila had to take 15 meetings a day.

[33:21] She operates.

[33:22] She's, she's coordinating things between different departments.

[33:24] She's checking on portfolio companies.

[33:26] She's having, you know, one of one of the people who have been

[33:28] some sort of emotional breakdown about some craziness, whatever.

[33:33] She handles all that with a smile, internet, and so.

[33:36] But like, I, I was, when we're talking earlier, like, I kept it $3 million a year.

[33:42] And then when Laila came in, 24 months later, I took home 17 million in income.

[33:45] That. And so the difference was that she liked people.

[33:50] And I tried to avoid them.

[33:54] And that was the problem.

[33:56] And so she heard, like, Laila's genuine vision in life is to build a company that

[34:01] people love working at.

[34:02] That's her whole, like, the whole reason that she, like, she gets a, like, her internal

[34:06] mission is to build a company that people love being at every day.

[34:10] And so her vision just fits within my vision.

[34:14] I recruited her.

[34:16] To do it, but like, if we didn't do stuff that she liked, we'd like she wouldn't build it.

[34:20] So I very much, like, especially the more talented the people that you bring on, the more you, like,

[34:25] they don't need pushing. Like, they know what they're doing. You just need to make sure that

[34:31] they're doing it in the direction. And you kind of do this.

[34:34] Yeah, the amount of training that you have to give someone is inversely proportional to the

[34:37] skills that they come in with. So the more specifically the, the less skill, the person, the more

[34:41] specific the instructions. Sam could basically just be like, hey, can you just promote school a lot?

[34:47] And I'd be like, yeah, he's not like, hey, could you make these posts and write this copy and send

[34:52] these emails and run ads and make the hooks like this? Like, that exchange has literally never

[35:00] like, I don't even have same seeds the ads before.

[35:04] Almost he takes me there. He was like, when does the activation stuff come out? And I see it last

[35:08] Thursday. I was like, I already did it. And then you saw, I've seen this and I was like, yeah,

[35:17] I've already been thinking about that. We've got something coming. Like, we don't even,

[35:21] I've already thought about the next four things and we've got things really. So by the time

[35:27] almost the idea, I'm like, yeah, we've got it. Don't worry. Do your thing.

[35:31] And then I'm like, cool, let me tell you what I'm doing on the media side. It's like, I'm

[35:35] great. Like, draw the things that I'm wrapping up. The system we're putting in place. Like,

[35:39] we change our cadence. Like, things like that. It's like, oh, don't. I don't even want to think about

[35:42] your YouTube. It's like, if I had to tell him stuff, oh my god. Like, yeah, but it's good to divide

[35:51] it like that. Because I can just focus on this stuff. He can focus on that stuff. Could we can focus on

[35:56] his stuff? We have very good, like, division like that. Yeah. The amount of direction you need to

[36:02] give someone's inverse and proportional to skill that you have. I guess someone could just be like,

[36:06] hey, can you build this company and be like, sure. People will complain like, if people,

[36:10] it's always a sign of notice when people complain there's no communication. Have you, has anyone

[36:16] had this? Is it an issue? Like with teams? Maybe a lot of you don't have teams here, but bad

[36:22] communication communication. Sometimes it's always the complaint. Yeah, I've found it's interesting

[36:28] that one because you don't really need to communicate a whole lot when you get the right people.

[36:35] Like, almost you said, like, a couple of words and I said, oh, I got it. Like, what have you

[36:39] happened? Like, right? But sometimes if you hire the wrong person, there's no amount of

[36:44] communication that can ever make it work. And it's exhausting. And it just still doesn't work.

[36:51] And I think I understood this. I think I told this at one of the previous ones, but how you know

[36:55] what a good culture is? Is this story of Google in the early days? So Larry Page searched for

[37:04] something in the ads that showed up will not relevant to the words he typed out. He took a

[37:09] screenshot, he printed it off, he got a red marker and he wrote these ads suck. He walked over to

[37:14] the engineers and he pended up on the wall and he tapped it. And one of them walked over and

[37:20] picked it off the wall, stayed up all night then, night and invented ad cents, which is there,

[37:29] which has made them hundreds of buildings. So he didn't sit down with him and be like, look,

[37:36] I think you need to do this in this and this and maybe this, he just said these ads suck.

[37:41] Right, is that clear communication? I mean, damn it was. No, but that's what good talent is.

[37:48] You can just be like this thing. Yeah, they be even after they do this. You can say this sucks

[37:55] sorted out like and then they'll be on it. Or they might have already preempted what sucks because

[38:01] they've already been thinking about it. So I always remember that when people say, oh, like you need

[38:06] more meetings or more communication, like there wasn't a meeting, first of all. Right, there was

[38:12] there was sloughing something on the wall. Yeah. One of the most difficult things, this is like

[38:18] I think this is from an entrepreneurship perspective in terms of development, is like,

[38:23] is anyone here had another business before this? Yes, okay. Did you achieve in this business?

[38:29] What you achieved in your last business? Like, from how long it took you to get to that level

[38:33] and your the business before versus how long it took you to get to that level with this business

[38:37] was it way faster? And so a lot of the reasons is because you already beat the bosses up to that

[38:43] level. So it's kind of like you're quickly retracing your steps and then you get to a level that

[38:46] you don't your to your level of incompetence. The difficulty, the thing that takes the longest in

[38:51] entrepreneurship is figuring out what good looks like at each level. And it's one of those things that's

[38:57] really hard to translate. Like you see the billionaires on stage and they're just like, I, you know,

[39:01] get great people and you're like, sure. But the thing is is that connecting what great people to

[39:08] them looks like in their mind and what you think great people are, that is an ocean apart. And so

[39:13] I mean, I tell this story in San Bernard's talking about this last time, but like, I, when we started

[39:18] meeting with private equity firms to to look at transaction with Jim launch, I, we'd have these

[39:24] super long tables that were these boardrooms. And I'd see their team all the way on this side. I saw my

[39:30] team all the way on this side. And I would just kind of sit there and listen to like the questions that they

[39:34] were asking and the responses that my team had. To be fair, the team that we had, it built $100

[39:38] plus company pre-COVID. Obviously, I sold during COVID, which actually hurt my valuation, but not the

[39:43] point. So they built $100 company, which is cool. But when I saw the town on this side, I was like,

[39:50] oh, that's why these guys are going to make $3 billion over the next five years. This team.

[39:55] And it was such a start contrast in terms of the level of town. Again, not disrespecting my team.

[39:59] It was just such a difference that it was literally like after that immediately. I was like, my whole

[40:05] bar, which is reset in terms of the caliber of the people that even existed in the world. And

[40:11] everything was like, how on earth I get those people to work for me. And so like, right now, some of

[40:18] you have like one person who's like, man, I couldn't live without that person. There's somebody who's

[40:22] literally 10 times better than that person that exists right now. And it's just trying to figure out

[40:26] what you need to do to get them on your team. But the problem that takes so long is looking at what

[40:33] good talent in general looks like. But even when it gets rural specific, like, say, I'm going to do

[40:36] all this research to figure out like, how do good software engineers talk? Like, what do they like?

[40:40] What do they want? And so so many of you guys are at a point where you need to like start hiring a sales

[40:44] director or something like that. Like, what happens is like, this is the entrepreneur and it

[40:48] will looks like you bring some around. You talk too much people and they're like, I think this guy's

[40:51] good. You bring him in and he sucks. And that takes six months away from the growth that you

[40:55] would have had because your sales team drops in this guy's sucked. You put bad processes and then

[40:59] you got to fix the process. You got to find the people that guy hired him. He sucked anyways. And then

[41:02] you're like, shoot, I'm going to try again. Even the next guy I had. And then sometimes it happens again.

[41:07] And you're like, wow, this sucked. And then the third time and sometimes it takes a year or two years.

[41:11] And then you're like, I now know and you get lucky and you get one who actually works and you're like,

[41:16] oh, this is what a great sales director looks like. And so the next time you go through your

[41:20] entrepreneur, you're like, you go right to there and then you're like, shoot, I don't know

[41:23] what a good customer success person looks like. And then you try again. And so it's like, however quickly

[41:27] you can work through that so you can start recognizing the pattern of A will good looks like in general.

[41:31] And then B will good looks like for a specific role. That's how quickly you move through the levels.

[41:37] That's been my experience with this. And I wish I try and do everything I can to try and translate

[41:41] that into the stories that I tell with the content. But sometimes it's really tough because they're

[41:46] like nod. But like that is that is the secret sauce. Like that is it is being able to recognize like,

[41:51] what a good growth partner looks like. What a good even a good agency. I've had a good

[41:56] good agency that we work with now. That's majority of them 95% of the dog shit.

[42:01] Some of you guys run them. So like that's that's that's that's that's that's the pattern

[42:08] recognition that's the highest value thing that you in a learning is an entrepreneurs. What what good looks like?

[00:00] What's going on everyone?

[00:01] I hope you're having a phenomenal weekend,

[00:03] restful time.

[00:05] This podcast is dedicated to all of the younger entrepreneurs

[00:09] out there.

[00:09] So this is a little departure from the normal business owner.

[00:11] But I think that you'll still find value.

[00:13] And if you know any younger entrepreneurs,

[00:14] or you have teenagers or kids or college,

[00:18] college aged people, slash maybe even people in their 20s, 30s.

[00:22] Who are getting into business?

[00:23] And so maybe you left your job

[00:24] and you're getting into business now, whatever.

[00:26] This would apply to you.

[00:27] And it's regarding expectations.

[00:31] And I think that expectations are literally

[00:34] the thing that will destroy your life,

[00:36] or will make your life.

[00:38] And many of us, I think many people in general

[00:41] have figured out a many world religions that figured it out,

[00:43] which is the secret to happiness,

[00:46] is have's over once, which is, let's say you have one thing,

[00:55] and you want nothing, you will be infinitely happy.

[00:59] The problem is where you might have a million things,

[01:00] but you want two million things, and you will not be happy.

[01:03] And so you can simply change how happy you are by expecting less.

[01:08] And so one of the things that I specifically wanted to

[01:11] address today was the expectations around education.

[01:15] And the reason this is a really meaningful topic for me

[01:17] is that I think I've talked to you about my neighbor,

[01:20] and watching him go through the crazy expectation city

[01:24] has as a young person that's been really valuable for me,

[01:27] because I've also seen a lot of those characteristics

[01:30] that he has in myself, just add zeros to it,

[01:33] but it's still fundamentally the same thing.

[01:35] And that's what's been meaningful for me.

[01:39] And so anyways, I have tried to frame things.

[01:44] So if you were trying to learn things,

[01:46] which is going to be the first step to any kind of entrepreneur

[01:48] endeavor, is I like to liken everything to a bridge,

[01:51] because I think it's a simple visual.

[01:53] So imagine where you are on one side of this valley,

[01:59] is where you are.

[02:00] And where you want to go is on the other side of this big valley.

[02:04] And you have a bridge that goes across the two sides.

[02:07] Now the problem is, is that people by things,

[02:11] they will buy courses, they will buy mentorships,

[02:14] they'll buy workshops, they'll buy seminars,

[02:15] they'll buy events, they'll buy whatever.

[02:17] In an effort, on some level, to get over this bridge,

[02:21] of where they are to where they want to go.

[02:22] And it could be from zero to 100,000 years.

[02:25] It could be from a million dollars a month to two million dollars a month.

[02:28] It could be from a hundred million dollars a year to a billion dollars a year.

[02:30] Whatever it is, there's a bridge, right?

[02:33] And along that bridge, our bricks.

[02:37] And I like to liken each skill as a brick on the way

[02:42] to where you're trying to go.

[02:44] And the problem with the expectations of somebody

[02:48] who's trying to learn a skill or achieve a goal

[02:50] is that they have a binary outcome.

[02:52] I either achieved it or I did not.

[02:54] I either am making $100,000 or I am not.

[02:57] And the problem is it can be incredibly frustrating

[02:59] because if you have a binary outcome,

[03:03] then it's very easy to get a zero out of one.

[03:07] Where the reality is, most things are exist on a continuum.

[03:11] And so this is the difference between a psychological binary

[03:15] and the biological continuum, which is,

[03:18] I'll give you a couple of examples.

[03:20] So it's not, are you diabetic or are you not diabetic?

[03:23] It's how diabetic are you?

[03:25] It's not, are you smart or are you dumb?

[03:28] But it's how smart are you, right?

[03:30] And so we like to psychologically bucket things

[03:33] into yes-nose because it's simpler for us.

[03:35] But it misses actual reality, right?

[03:39] And this can be especially dangerous

[03:40] as we're trying to acquire new skills.

[03:42] And so the reason I liken this

[03:44] and I think it's so dangerous in education

[03:47] because that's what we're doing, right?

[03:48] We're trying to educate ourselves

[03:49] for trying to acquire skills is that we think this

[03:51] we're trying to get across this bridge

[03:53] that let's say you buy a course on copyrighting, right?

[03:56] And so you're on one side of the bridge.

[03:58] You buy a course on copyrighting

[04:00] and then you still aren't a millionaire.

[04:01] Wow, right?

[04:03] The problem is you may have put another brick on your bridge.

[04:08] You may be closer to where you were,

[04:11] to getting to the other side of the bridge.

[04:12] You just haven't achieved it yet.

[04:13] And so this is one of the issues that I also see

[04:17] just in general.

[04:18] It's so funny because in the, I'll say,

[04:20] quote, guru world, people will take on a coach.

[04:24] That coach will move them forward to a certain degree.

[04:26] And then they'll take another coach

[04:28] and that coach will move them forward to a certain degree.

[04:29] And so forth and so on.

[04:31] And then the thing is that they're like,

[04:33] I'm working with so-and-so.

[04:34] I used to work with that person they suck, right?

[04:37] But the problem, and I used to do this, right?

[04:38] And this is why I think it's so ridiculous,

[04:41] is that if you were looking at your schooling, right?

[04:43] And you had a third grade math teacher.

[04:46] And then later you had a calculus teacher.

[04:48] You wouldn't be like, screw that third grade math teacher.

[04:53] The stuff that I'm learning from this guy

[04:54] is so much more advanced, whatever, right?

[04:57] And I've had a lot of our clients say that about their franchises

[04:59] that they work with and things like that.

[05:01] And it tries me nuts because it's stupid.

[05:06] It's for Lagerbert, it's stupid.

[05:08] Because a lot of times you need,

[05:11] you need step one to get to step two, right?

[05:13] And you don't have to, and it's because people

[05:15] have psychological issues.

[05:16] But like they can't say, I've learned from all of these people,

[05:21] right?

[05:21] And it doesn't decrease your status to say,

[05:24] I've learned from many teachers,

[05:25] look at all the richest people in the world.

[05:26] They say, like, I've had multiple mentors.

[05:28] I've had so many people hot me out over the years.

[05:30] And I think if you can shift that perspective,

[05:31] it will be incredibly valuable for you.

[05:33] But one of the other things that's so poisonous,

[05:35] about especially in the like the, quote, make money world,

[05:38] is that if everyone in the world viewed college,

[05:42] because I think about this a lot,

[05:42] I'm like, why is it that people will spend $200,000,

[05:46] four years of their lives, study, you know,

[05:50] as tech literature of the 1700s and get to the end,

[05:53] and not in any way be upset about the fact

[05:56] that they're not making money when they graduate.

[05:59] They're just came to me and get a job.

[06:00] Like, why is that?

[06:02] And the only reason that I can come up with

[06:04] is that they didn't expect to, right?

[06:06] And so that's it.

[06:08] Like that's the difference.

[06:09] Is that people come in and part of that

[06:11] is because of the marketing messaging

[06:12] and the sales and all that kind of stuff.

[06:13] So it don't even be wrong.

[06:14] Like the reason that the big academic powerhouse

[06:17] has been able to stay there,

[06:18] well one is because they got the government

[06:19] to get on board and give away free money.

[06:20] So that's obviously one part of it.

[06:22] But the other part of it is that when people are coming in,

[06:25] they expect nothing, like nothing.

[06:28] Literally, they're not expecting anything.

[06:29] They just expect to get a check mark next to the name

[06:31] that says you have a diploma of congratulations, right?

[06:33] And so if my request of everyone,

[06:40] and I've requested this of myself,

[06:41] is that when I go into trying to learn something

[06:44] that I do not have, give myself a binary outcome

[06:47] of did this work or did not work,

[06:50] but instead give myself the question,

[06:52] am I closer or further away from my goal?

[06:55] And I think that has been tremendously helpful.

[06:57] I've spent, I mean recently, I spent $50,000 on,

[07:01] I think eight hours with someone

[07:04] is different than the Grand Cardone one that I did.

[07:08] That was four hours for 120,000 of you curious.

[07:12] And honestly, I got enough value in the first hour

[07:14] that I was like, I don't want to do it the next day calls.

[07:18] With Grand, it was really good.

[07:19] But the point is, with the other one that I did,

[07:23] it was actually to have assistance on a higher-low

[07:24] project that I was working on.

[07:26] And about halfway through, I realized that it was not a priority

[07:30] for me.

[07:30] And so I could either say this got me,

[07:32] I'm not going to be like, hey, screw this guy, right?

[07:34] Or anything like that.

[07:35] It was just, for me, if I can get the perspective

[07:38] that something is not a priority, that is valuable in it

[07:39] of itself.

[07:40] Does that take me closer or further to my ultimate goal?

[07:42] Closeer.

[07:43] It's a why would I be satisfied?

[07:45] And so shifting our education expectations

[07:49] to is this another brick on the bridge

[07:53] to where I'm trying to go, or instead of, excuse me,

[07:57] instead of am I at my destination or not?

[08:00] And I think that this is probably one of the biggest things

[08:02] that you can do, or it's been useful for me.

[08:07] And this is what I've tried to shift my neighbor's perspective.

[08:10] For himself on, which is, it's kind of aligned with that

[08:13] kind of investor mindset, which is, if I were to look over

[08:16] a five-year time horizon, and I were to continue to acquire

[08:20] skills like this, and I put more and more bricks on my bridge

[08:23] by the end of that period, would I be better or worse off?

[08:26] And likely it'd be better.

[08:28] But you will be worse off if you keep trying to build a new bridge.

[08:31] And that's why when you jump from opportunity,

[08:33] I don't have to understand you can never get to where you're

[08:34] trying to go because you take two steps of progress

[08:36] and say, oh, I'm not there.

[08:37] By an area outcome, therefore I will start something else.

[08:40] And it's only after failing three, four, five, six things,

[08:43] then on the seventh thing, you had enough acquired skills

[08:46] from your first six failures that you are actually able to make

[08:49] it all the way across the bridge.

[08:50] And that's what's kind of interesting about this,

[08:52] is that there are plenty of people who have come to us

[08:57] and immediately start making a lot of money.

[08:59] And then they're like, oh my god, Jim, what's awesome.

[09:01] And the thing is that we don't honestly just

[09:05] to revolve all the credit because some of these people

[09:09] may have gone through three, four, five courses

[09:11] that they believe failed them.

[09:13] When in reality, there may be 38 skill sets

[09:15] that they need to create their business, core skills.

[09:19] And they may have acquired 24 of them from other people.

[09:23] And we just happen to be able to get them the last 14

[09:26] that gets them all the way across.

[09:27] But because they have a binary outcome expectation,

[09:30] they then attribute all the credit to us.

[09:32] And I don't think that's fair.

[09:35] To themselves in terms of their mental space,

[09:37] but also to everyone else that they've worked with.

[09:39] And so I think thinking about it this way has been really

[09:43] helpful.

[09:43] And especially, and this is, again,

[09:45] I mentioned the franchise or one earlier,

[09:46] but I'm gonna say it again.

[09:48] I can't tell you the amount of facility specifically

[09:51] that worked with the franchise or and then said,

[09:53] started working with us, started making more money.

[09:54] And we're like, I hate my franchise or you got,

[09:57] like screw them blah, blah, blah, blah.

[09:59] But the reality is that many times,

[10:01] they wouldn't have even survived long enough

[10:03] without the fundamental bricks that have been laid

[10:06] by the franchise or with their business model.

[10:08] There's so many fundamentals that they may not even

[10:10] been aware of, and mistakes that they would have made

[10:13] that were avoided because the franchise

[10:15] or got them 70% of the way across the bridge.

[10:19] And we just got them the last 30.

[10:22] And so another perspective on this as well

[10:25] is that let's say you've got two people

[10:27] who all have, who both have, all 38 bricks on this bridge,

[10:31] on the path of your opportunity vehicle,

[10:33] you're trying to pursue to get to the other side.

[10:36] Now let's say both of them have both 38 bricks.

[10:39] But with your learning style and their teaching style,

[10:43] you're only able to actually absorb 25 of the first guys.

[10:50] It's kind of the same thing.

[10:51] It's like for some reason, maybe the first

[10:55] which you worked with Touch Addis Albany,

[10:56] like it didn't absorb or it wasn't real for you.

[10:58] And then later on in your life, it was able to be real for you

[11:01] and then you attribute your success

[11:04] to the second person when reality,

[11:06] the first person helped you along the way.

[11:08] And so this has just been really valuable for me

[11:12] from a shift in perspective in my overall happiness.

[11:16] But also just in thinking about outcomes

[11:18] and what do I believe is reasonable?

[11:21] And I think I've been asking myself this question much more

[11:25] frequently, which is, do I believe my expectations are reasonable?

[11:28] And it is the other way that I can lower them.

[11:30] And there's different between lowering your expectations

[11:34] of the performance you want of people.

[11:36] I believe you should be absolutely intolerant.

[11:37] If people do not want to be more classed, something.

[11:40] Or you should be intolerant of any lack of effort.

[11:43] But if you can maintain absolute intolerance to anything

[11:47] but excellence, but then also decrease your expectations

[11:49] of the outcome, then that is going to be a winning formula.

[11:53] So increase expectations on activity and actions,

[11:57] decrease expectations on outcomes.

[11:59] And I think that that is a formula for business success

[12:02] just as halves over once is a formula for happiness in life.

[12:10] And so anyways, I figured I would share that with you

[12:12] just quick recap of takeaways.

[12:15] Try not to think about things.

[12:16] Or at least for me, this has been valuable.

[12:17] I have shifted to going from binary,

[12:20] is this good, is this bad, to how good is it?

[12:22] And instead of thinking, this is what needs to happen

[12:25] is a first, is that a reasonable expectation

[12:28] and b can I lower it?

[12:30] And b and c can I raise my expectations of the activities

[12:33] that I would be willing to take to make my very low expectation.

[12:37] So believeably reasonable to achieve that I should hopefully surpass it.

[12:42] And so I think when we go into expectations around education

[12:47] and skill acquisition and thinking about things

[12:49] on the continuum of MI closer or further

[12:53] from my goal as a result of this decision,

[12:56] many times we will think much more favorably

[12:58] about our experience and be significantly less frustrated

[13:01] with what might be perceived as a momentary quote,

[13:05] setback, which isn't even a setback.

[13:07] It's only a setback because we think it is,

[13:09] rather than I am 22 of my 38 steps along the way.

[13:12] And I just need to continue to identify

[13:14] which are the bricks that I am missing to get me to my goal,

[13:17] which is ultimately the role, which is why so many billionaires

[13:21] et cetera talk about having good mentors

[13:22] because they can look at your skills

[13:24] that they can look at your bridge and say,

[13:25] this is what's missing, this is what you need.

[13:27] And the thing is that when it's sometimes

[13:29] that last brick, it's that one thing that you need,

[13:32] that you didn't see and then all of a sudden you trip

[13:34] at all your success to that person when in reality,

[13:36] it was because you spent four years building the other bricks.

[13:39] So anyways, hope that was about before you,

[13:40] hope that made sense, keeping awesome

[13:43] and having a happy and productive life.

[13:45] All right, let's love, say real.

[13:47] Bye.

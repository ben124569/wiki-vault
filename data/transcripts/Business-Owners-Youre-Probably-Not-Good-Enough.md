[00:00] If you've ever not gotten the deal, or you've ever not had someone believe in you, you've

[00:04] been doubted because of the way you look, how old you are, how young you are, what gender

[00:08] you are, where you're born, where you're not born, the way you dress, the way you look,

[00:12] the way you talk. Then the question isn't whether that bias is true, because it may

[00:16] absolutely be true. But the question is, what do we do about it anyways? And how can we

[00:20] confront the other alternative reality that might be true, which is, what if you're just not good

[00:23] enough? Now what? There was a lady who made a post and she said, I quit my job to start doing this

[00:31] because my boss didn't respect me because I was a woman. And so because of that, I quit my job

[00:38] to start doing this. And I had this immediate thought in my head, what if you're just not good enough?

[00:47] That was the thought that came through my mind when I read that message. And it got me fired up

[00:56] because the amount of times in my life that I've seen this victimized mentality hurt people

[01:04] is far more than it has ever helped. And so the reason I want to talk about this is because it

[01:08] applies to employees and applies to business owners. And I have so many stories of this that I want

[01:14] to drive through this and then I want to drive to the two natural conclusions that end up coming

[01:19] from logic. And so this is the same thing as the kid who says, hey, I started this marketing agency

[01:25] and I've got these services and I'm trying to get these business owners and they're saying,

[01:29] well, they're not buying for me because I'm a kid, right? I'm too young, right? I had a family

[01:34] member who had a restaurant and he opened it up in the wrong part of town and he was like, well,

[01:38] my restaurant is not working because people don't want to come to this this out of the, this

[01:42] out of the neighbor, they buy us against this out of the neighborhood. And I'll give you another one,

[01:47] which was Jacob, who is my neighbor, my little 15 year old neighbor from way back when when I walked

[01:54] in on him trying to sell a wholesale deal. And he got off the phone and he'd been trying to sell

[01:59] wholesale deals for a month because he read some stuff on the internet, watching me two videos.

[02:04] And I was like, so, you know, how's it work and he was like, well, no one's really buying yet.

[02:09] And I could tell that on some level, it was because he thought that he was too young and people

[02:14] aren't taking him seriously. So one of our portfolio companies had two people who weren't a conflict.

[02:20] All right? So there was a white guy and a black guy and they were peers and they had to work together

[02:26] and they didn't like each other. And so finally, we had to be like, y'all need to get along,

[02:30] figure it out. And so the white guy sends the black guy a song and it's his way of trying to make

[02:36] a mens. And the song was a rap song and it had some lyrics that offended the black guy. And he said,

[02:45] you know, this is not racially sensitive, blah, blah, blah, blah. And he then asked for the white guy to

[02:52] go through racial sensitivity training. And here's where this gets interesting. The black guy is

[02:59] married to a white girl and has mixed kids. And the white guy is married to a black girl and has mixed

[03:06] kids. Do you think he fucking needs racial sensitivity training? No. He just doesn't like you for the

[03:12] content of your character. And so there's a very significant possibility that it might not be because

[03:17] you're too young. It might not be because you're black. It might not be because you're a woman.

[03:20] It might not be because you're a Republican. It might not be because you're a Democrat. It might not

[03:24] be because you're trans. You just might not be good enough. And the thing is, is that even if you're

[03:29] right, even if there is a fucking bias because biases will exist, I'm not even going to deny that

[03:34] the absolute exists. And they will always exist. And the reason they will always exist is because

[03:38] this is how human beings learn. You learn and you create judgments to to wish for a world that doesn't

[03:44] create bias, wishes for a world where humans don't learn. If you go and you're a waitress and you

[03:50] serve a table and it's all people with red faces and those red faces leave you zero tip. And then

[03:55] you go to a table with green faces and the green faces leave you a big tip. And then you do that

[04:00] again and again and the red faces leave you lower tips than the green faces and the green

[04:03] faces leave you big tips. What will you do? You will begin to expect that red faces leave you

[04:08] note tip and green faces leave you big tip. Now, we're a place red and green with tall white,

[04:12] Asian, woman, whatever. The point is that people will learn and as long as there are stereotypes

[04:17] that exist because people do behave in a certain way, then people will learn those things. Period.

[04:22] But the thing is, let's say you're a red face and you do tip well. And you hate the fact that when

[04:28] you walk to a place, they don't treat you a certain way. Right? And the thing is, is that biases

[04:34] exist everywhere. And I want to be clear here. When I got into the gym space, I was young. I was

[04:40] so young looking that I knew no one took me seriously. And so I lied about being the owner.

[04:46] I lied. So when people came in, I was just said, I'm the owner and I worked out a deal that I would

[04:51] potentially earn in my own ships. I had this whole backstory that I made up in the beginning.

[04:55] Because I looked so young that no one would believe that I was the owner on the gym. And so

[05:00] I'm saying this because I get it. And to be fair, I look the way I look. If I have a tank top

[05:06] on, like we moved into a very nice penthouse. My neighbors immediately complained about me. He

[05:11] literally sent to the email to the front desk of the building and said, is, what is this

[05:15] Beverly Hillbilly who moved in next to us? I'm not kidding. And so the thing is is that,

[05:21] I mean, I thought it was fucking hilarious. I died. I thought it was great. But the thing is,

[05:25] is it, what does that mean? He is a bias against people who look like me, right? Who wear wife

[05:29] beaters and walk around like that on a regular basis. And he thinks, wow, this guy, I've had

[05:36] negative experiences with the people like him. And so the thing is, I have a friend from college,

[05:41] way back when Black guy. And he hated that there was a stereotype that Black people don't tip.

[05:48] He hated it. And so rather than trying to say, this is unfair, the world is unfair, this bias

[05:55] exists. You know what he did? He was always really nice and he always overtipped. That was what he

[06:02] did. He overtipped. Because the thing is, is that let's, let's play out the scenarios. You

[06:07] bitch in moan and you say, you know what, this person didn't buy because of me on. This person

[06:11] didn't buy because I'm a woman. This person didn't buy because of whatever. And the thing is,

[06:15] let's say you, you do some empirical study and you prove it right. Now what? Great, you prove that

[06:22] you have a disadvantage. Okay. Again, now what? Hey, if you want to get around people who are actually

[06:27] winning, who look like you, who smell like you, who talk like you, and are doing what you want to do.

[06:32] I'd like to invite you to the school games community, it's school dot com for such games. I take

[06:36] calls in there. I put content that's like this and more personalized inside of that community.

[06:40] And I drop a huge amount once a month and eight hour training on how to actually take this

[06:45] stuff and win anyways. And so if that's interesting, school dot com for such games, see in there.

[06:49] The thing is, is that arguing for, for proving a bias is good for society, bad for the individual.

[06:56] And as far as we're concerned, this is a single player game. Life. And so we've got to go through

[07:02] with the assumption that nothing's going to change and what are we going to do about it anyways,

[07:05] because no one gets better by feeling sorry for themselves. No single person has ever gotten better.

[07:10] By proving that they were the victim of something. Ever. And so whether you're an employee and

[07:15] you're getting, you feel like you're getting passed up for the promotion. The amount of times

[07:20] that we get this to like, I'm a businessman. We have a lot of businesses. We have a lot of employees.

[07:23] And the thing is, is that if someone gets passed up, maybe there is a bias, because biases will

[07:30] always exist. But the only thing you can do is be better than the bias. You have to be better

[07:37] than the bias. You have to be so fucking good that you have to be, you have to overcompensate.

[07:42] He didn't tip normally. He tip more than normal so that he could be one, one light on the bad dots

[07:49] that he felt that the people who had served him in the past had experienced. And so to give you a

[07:55] story that I had with Jacob. So he was the young kid. He sounded like a child on the phone.

[07:59] And the reason they weren't buying the deals from him is because he sounded like a fucking child on

[08:03] the phone. And the thing is, is that what if they're right? And I think this is where people

[08:07] get even more offended. It's like, what if the bias that you have, what if what if the bias that you

[08:13] you've you've experienced against, what if it's true? And this is where people get, what if I do

[08:19] that, like a hillbill? Right, what if I do that? What if I did act immature? Because I was young.

[08:26] Now what? And so the thing is, is that one, if you prove that there's a bias again, so what?

[08:34] Now you've proved that there's a bias, your life's not any better.

[08:38] Version two, what if they're right? So when you're proving that there's a bias and you don't act

[08:42] that way, the next, the next vein of thinking is, what if, what if they're right about it? What if

[08:48] you just, you are exactly the stereotype? What if I am immature? What if I don't show up on time?

[08:53] What if I am emotional because I'm because I act like a child because I haven't matured yet because

[08:56] I haven't even experienced in life? Now what if I'm not consistent because I haven't learned that

[09:01] skill yet, which most more young people have that than old people? Old people are notoriously

[09:07] consistent. They love their routines. How many 80 year olds do you know don't have routines?

[09:12] Hard to not have one when you're 80, right? You have to break the spirits of old people by

[09:18] being spontaneous, right? And so the thing is, it's like, these stereotypes exist because bias

[09:23] is exist because we're going to always learn, we're always going to make judgments. But it comes

[09:27] down to whether you're restaurants on the wrong side of the street, whether you have a red face or

[09:32] a green face or your short and girls, girls don't like short guys. Okay, if you believe the bias,

[09:38] then you make it true. You make it real. You give it more power rather than less.

[09:43] And so I look like this. I look probably, in terms of like my look, I probably look right leaning.

[09:51] I probably look a little bit hillbillyish. If I put the wife feeder on, then I definitely look

[09:56] dumber in general. I mean, when I had my gym, people, I had many people ask me if I was

[10:01] literate, but as soon as I open my mouth, it became apparent that I was educated.

[10:06] And so the thing is, and here's my silver lining for this, is that if you have a bias,

[10:13] you actually have the opportunity to stand out even more by being against it.

[10:18] If if a green face tips more than a red like then a just tips a lot,

[10:22] then it's like, well, I expected a green face to tip more. But if a red face tips a lot,

[10:27] you're like, whoa, I noticed that. If a guy in a suit sounds literate and sounds educated,

[10:34] you're not really surprised there because it's what you expected. But if a jack guy in a

[10:39] beater who looks like a heck, and maybe he doesn't have hillbilly views of the world,

[10:45] isn't a racist, might have a more articulate way of expressing things, then all of a sudden you pause

[10:51] in that person because we're interesting. They start to break the bias. They start to be better

[10:57] than the bias. You start to create a category that's separate for that individual. So there are

[11:02] many red faces, but this one is John and John's cool. John tips, well,

[11:09] the thing is is that I think all of us have the opportunity to be John or Sarah, who is a red face

[11:14] suit. There are their arpices that exist. But we could be better than the bias. And I love this,

[11:20] I love this quote from Andy for sell it. So good. I fucking wish it were mine.

[11:24] I said, personal excellence is the ultimate rebellion, and I just fucking love that. And so the

[11:30] question is, what are you going to do about it? Proving that it exists does nothing. You just prove

[11:36] that there's you have a disadvantage. Okay, we all have disadvantages in some way to some person.

[11:42] Like if I go into a place that has had a lot of guys and flannels who said racist things to them,

[11:48] as soon as I walk in the room, there's going to be a bias against me. They're not going to like

[11:52] me. By right at the onset. And so what can I do? You can play into the bias. I can complain that

[11:59] there's a bias or I can overcompensate. I can tip more than anyone normally does. I can be more kind,

[12:05] more understanding, more literate. I can work harder. And so I'm going to wrap this to Jacob because

[12:12] I'll tell you the story. Obviously, I said, listen, I think you suck at sales. I think it has nothing

[12:16] to do with the fact that you're young. And so you got to learn. He's like, well, how do I learn?

[12:19] And it's like, well, you got to do more than everybody else. And I'm going to give you the advice that

[12:22] I told him that I would say that he says it's changed his life. And so I will share it with you. And this

[12:26] goes for the employees. This also goes for the business owners. It works for everyone. Which is,

[12:31] I said, volume negates luck. I said, if you want to be the best, find the best guy in my company.

[12:39] So I got him an interview. I said, I will not get you the job. I said, I can get you an interview

[12:42] because the guy who's going to be hiring you. I was like, it's got to him. And he's got 10 other

[12:45] guys he's been interviewing. And so he decided to give him the job. He had a shot. Right. That's,

[12:49] I mean, at Jim launch and says, like, getting a job is getting a shot. That's all it is.

[12:53] You still got to work your leads. You still got to go generate. You got to generate sales. And so he

[12:57] got on the phones. And I said, go find the best guy. Look at what he does and do twice as much because

[13:03] you have to do twice as much because he's better than you. You can't do as much as the best guy because

[13:06] he's always just going to get ahead. You have to do what he's doing and another full day's work

[13:10] so that you can start catching up. And so he started doing twice as much as what the best guy was doing.

[13:14] And so over time, he became the best guy on the outbound team. And then he became, and then he

[13:19] moved up to the middle sales team and became the best guy on the qualification team, which is the second

[13:24] the second highest level of sales guys that we have. And then from there being the best guy. And

[13:27] here's the thing, here's the fucking thing because he was so young. He's 18 years old, 18 years old.

[13:35] All the guys who were my closers were all men with families. Like, they were professionals. It was a

[13:40] strong team. Still a strong team. And the sales manager, a man with a family, said, he, he was

[13:46] hesitant. He had a bias against him because he was young. He said, listen, I'm not going to just

[13:52] let you on the team. Now he had objectively had better stats as a center and anybody who had been

[13:59] 30 years old or the family would have absolutely gotten put on the closure team. But he said,

[14:03] I want you to go self-generate end-to-end, click to close. You go find someone in the fucking world,

[14:08] bring them all the way and close them yourself before I let you on the closing team. He had never

[14:12] asked anyone else to do that. And so we did. After he did one, he was like, I need you to do another

[14:18] one to make sure it wasn't a fluke. So we did another one. And he said, you know what, just because

[14:23] I want the team to be really sure because you're young and he had the bias of, oh Alex knows you.

[14:30] So you're getting special treatment because Alex knows you. You're the, you're the friend of the

[14:34] bosses, right? And so he's like, you got to do another one. So he had to do another one. And then

[14:40] when he got on the team, what did it? Where did he start? Low man, low man on the toe. Well,

[14:44] he was young and he had the bias of all your, your boss's pet, right? He had to have both of these

[14:50] biases against him. Because nobody likes that guy, right? And I told him that. I said, they're going

[14:54] to not like it because you're young and they're not going to like you because they know you know

[14:58] me. And I was like, you need to leave no fucking room for doubt that you earned it. I was like,

[15:04] and so you're going to be left of center. You're going to start six feet underground before you

[15:08] can get your head over. I was like, that's what it is. And I was like, either you can pitch in

[15:11] mode about it and you can lose and be right and be right about the fact that you're going to have

[15:16] a bias against you or you can win. Win anyways. And so what did he do? He became the top

[15:25] performing sales rep with all the grown ass men and their families. Was there bias? Yes, did he have to

[15:31] do more to get on the team? Yes, did he have to prove himself in ways that no one else had to? Yes.

[15:38] And so if you're in that position and you feel like you have this bias against you,

[15:42] here's what I would ask if you're an employee and this is what I would encourage the business

[15:45] owners who are listening to this. Ask this question. What would it take? What would it take for

[15:52] me to get on the team? What would it take for me to be the manager? What would it take for me

[15:57] to be the director? What would it take for me to get a raise? What would it take for me to get a

[16:00] promotion if I'm the business owner trying to get the deal? What would it take for us to do

[16:04] business together? What would it take for you to say yes? What would I have to do? Objectively.

[16:10] I get that you've got some you've got hesitation. I understand that I'm young. I understand that

[16:14] I got in here because I had some other guy who tapped somebody else's shoulder and got me an

[16:17] interview day one. I get that. I understand that. So what would it take? Let me compensate. Let me not just

[16:23] tip normal. I'm not going to tip 20 percent because other people who look like me don't tip 20.

[16:28] I was like, I'll tip 100. Just tell me what would it take to change your mind?

[16:34] What would it take for me to not look like a heck or for you to not think that I'm completely

[16:38] illiterate or uneducated? What would it take? No one benefits from the excuse. You hurt you more

[16:44] by accepting that the excuse is real. Because what the excuse of the of saying that there is bias

[16:50] and that the bias is the reason that you have not moved forward is that it gives you an excuse for

[16:54] not succeeding. It's all it does. It gives you a nice warm blanket to say, I'm not winning,

[17:00] but this is the reason why. Because the alternative reason of saying, I'm just not good enough,

[17:06] hurts your ego. And to be clear, I'm not saying that bias doesn't it absolutely exists.

[17:13] But we have to live in a world that it does exist and win anyways. And so I'll show you. I'll show

[17:18] you a note that I leave myself because I get in the same, everybody has, everybody's got shit.

[17:26] And so I'll show you with the background of my phone is right now because this is the season of

[17:30] the moment. You can see that it says just win. That's it. This is just win.

[17:38] Two words. At the end of the day, winner is right history. And if you win in the end, if you become

[17:45] the top performing sales rep, that's all that matters. And the only people who care about the

[17:50] biases are the ones who lose. Because those are those biases are the things that soften their head

[17:56] when they when they put their head down on their pillow at night because it makes them feel okay,

[18:01] it doesn't hurt their ego as much. They say, you know, if I didn't have this bias, I would have won.

[18:06] But no one remembers them. How much stronger of a story is it that you win despite the bias?

[18:12] You win despite the disadvantage. Oprah will always have my eternal respect for being the first

[18:18] female black billionaire who builds up media fucking empire in the fucking 80s. No one else can do that.

[18:26] So that's the thing is that the number of biases that you have to act against you

[18:31] becomes the more compelling story that no one else who doesn't have those biases will ever be able to tell.

[18:38] And if there's if there's anything that gives me hope, it's that.

[18:42] It's that you get the opportunity. You have this one unique opportunity that you get to be an example.

[18:47] You get to be an inspiration to other people who have red faces, who have green faces, who are

[18:52] too young, who are too old because those biases like I didn't get hired for the tech jack

[18:56] with them too old, you're not going to fix bias because it's wishing that humans won't learn.

[19:01] And that's never going to happen. But you can still win by simply asking what would it take.

[19:07] And accepting the only thing that you can control, which is that there is bias and the reason I did

[19:12] not win is because I'm just not good enough yet. I'm just not undeniable enough yet. Now,

[19:18] I might be good enough if I had a green face, but I'm not good enough if I have a red face.

[19:23] So I got to get that much fucking better.

[19:26] It's the only thing that you can control. And so whether you're a business owner and that restaurant

[19:32] that's on the wrong side of the street, if you have the best pizza in the city, people will go to the

[19:38] hood where it's unsafe to get the pizza. Everybody knows a restaurant where you're like, it's kind of

[19:44] on the wrong side of town. It's a little bit CD, but man, that Indian curry is fucking off the hook.

[19:49] Everybody, you know that spot. Now, do they have to be better than other places that are in safer

[19:55] nicer parts of town? Yes, but it doesn't mean that it's impossible. It just means the bar is higher.

[20:02] And the only thing that we have control over is whether we're willing to make the fucking climb.

[20:07] And so I saw that post and I was feeling spicy about it because the thing is it's like she was

[20:13] using that as the catals for her quitting or job to start a business. And I'm all about that.

[20:18] That's fine. That's awesome. Take your life and your own control. But do not for a second because I know

[20:23] that that belief will not serve her. Her saying, I didn't get promoted because I was a woman.

[20:29] I didn't get respected because I was a woman. And believe me, I know Layla doesn't get nearly enough

[20:35] credit for all the stuff she doesn't act with her time. If she was a guy, if she was just a dude,

[20:39] and it was just Alex and Dan, and Dan was a 50 50 partner of mine, Dan would get shitloaded

[20:44] more credit than Layla. Layla's a woman and she's my wife. And so the bias that exists against her

[20:50] is that how many business guys have their wife? They say she's the CEO and really she's just

[20:56] she's just a secretary, right? She's just a helper. Really, she has to do some doing some

[21:00] admin tasks. So many people, to this day, we show up to business conference and other business

[21:05] treats her like that. So what she's going to do? She's just got to be that much fucking better.

[21:12] And if you knew Layla, which many of you guys don't, if you really knew Layla, she loves it.

[21:17] She loves it. She's like, we're going to fucking murder him. Layla's way more hardcore than I am.

[21:23] You guys just don't know that. Layla's got a fucking dark side. You guys just don't know.

[21:28] Which is great. I love it. I think letting some of that dark side out

[21:33] and beating the shit out of that victim mentality that you have that because we want to. We want to

[21:39] lean into it. We want it. We want to, we want to, it feels so much better to say I didn't win because of

[21:43] outside thing because it makes us feel better. I'm good. I'm good enough. Just but there's this thing.

[21:50] My restaurant is good enough. It's just on the wrong side of the street. Right? I really am good

[21:54] at sales. I'm just, but you know, they don't give me the advancement because I knew Alex or because

[21:58] I'm too young and I, you know, I'll just wait a couple of year. What would it take? What would it take

[22:03] for to me to become undeniable? For me to be bulletproof. I want to have no chunks in the armor.

[22:09] Nothing that anyone can hold against me to say that I am not the best for this thing. And if there

[22:16] is a deal that you need and there's a guy who, who like was beat the hell in high school from

[22:23] guys who had flannel, flannels and he hates those people. And I don't get the deal. Guess what?

[22:29] There's other people that will give me the deal. And you just keep moving forward.

[00:00] I'm about to teach you a rarely-used method that I use to grow my audience by 5 million people in under 24 months.

[00:07] And the crazy thing is that it's 24 months ago, I had less than 10,000 followers,

[00:11] and I knew nothing about YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, any of these other platforms.

[00:16] And the reason that I was able to catapult to, you know, a top 1% greater than 24-month period

[00:22] is using this method that for some reason no one really talks about.

[00:25] Whenever I enter a new space, whether it's trying to learn a new skill, a new platform,

[00:30] a new anything, I realize this is a massive amount of skill deficiency that I have to overcome as fast as

[00:35] extremely possible. And so I can either deploy time or I can deploy money to save myself time.

[00:41] So within the world of organic content, I was like, who can I pay to shortcut my path to getting to where they are?

[00:47] So on one hand, I could go to like celebrities and I did go to some of them and they would give me their

[00:51] strategies, but it was like very personalized and tailored to them and I didn't think you would apply to

[00:55] like how I run acquisition.com in my daily life. On the other hand, there was like the coaches,

[01:00] gurus, etc that I could go to and I didn't want to do that because they might be using something

[01:03] that worked like five years ago, which honestly I see all the time. They're like, guys,

[01:07] you've got to do hashtags on YouTube videos. I'm like, what are you talking about? Like, that's,

[01:11] that's not true. And the third option which I ultimately went with are advertising agencies. And

[01:16] what an agency is, it's just a business that sells services of advertising on your behalf.

[01:22] I can pay someone to run ads for me. I can pay someone to cut, edit, and distribute content.

[01:27] Oh my behalf. So what I want to do is help you decide whether or not you should use an agency.

[01:31] And avoid what I call the agency trap. There's different tiers of agencies. There's the guys who just

[01:36] make stuff and then there's the people who are real pros, contextual here for one brand on one platform.

[01:41] A small one might cost three-ish maybe five thousand a month. The more advanced ones are usually in the

[01:46] 15 to 30 thousand dollars a month. So it's significantly more money. So here's how I use agencies now

[01:52] and how you can too. Phase one is I get what I would consider a basic agency. So long from getting

[01:58] in YouTube, the first step I did was I hired three to five thousand one with agency. And they just

[02:02] got me to commit to doing three videos a week. They just trimmed it, which means you take out the oozing

[02:06] eyes, put an intro and a thumbnail. The main objective of that first phase was just to get the basic

[02:11] step. Forcing me to create content on a regular case. Once I have more context because I've spent

[02:15] three, six months working with them, seeing what the audience likes, then I'm like, okay,

[02:19] now I want to learn everything. So I go from beginner of learning the basics and doing the fundamentals

[02:25] to how to the top creators create on this platform. No business owners should change their business

[02:29] for one client. And so it makes sense for both me and the small agency or for you and a small agency

[02:36] to part ways at some point when your demands for what you want exceed their capacity. So then

[02:41] I work with the much better, more advanced agency works with the top creators to learn all of the

[02:46] more nuanced pieces of the platform. So rather than agree to their initial terms, which is basically

[02:51] past as long as you're really possible and we hope you pay it till you die. This is exactly what I say.

[02:56] Go the round. I want to do what you do in my business, but I don't know how. I'd like to work with you

[03:02] for six months so I can learn how you do it. Plus, I'll pay extra for you to break down

[03:07] why you make the decisions you do and the steps you take to make them. Then after I get a good idea

[03:11] of how it works, I'll start training my team on it. And once things can do it well enough,

[03:14] I'd like to change to a lower cost consulting agreement. This way, you can still help us if we run

[03:18] into problems. Are you opposed to this? When you start that way, I like it because you're starting with

[03:22] very clear intentions. And you're saying, hey, I'm going to commit to six months. This is what I want

[03:26] for you. And I'm also saying, I'm going to continue to pay you after the engagements over for a

[03:30] much higher leverage, much more profitable consulting engagement. So that's what a lot of agencies would

[03:35] ultimately want. And if I need to pay a little bit more than the agency fee, a product that I'm

[03:39] willing to do that, I also understand that as I start to train my team on it internally, there will

[03:43] be a period of time where I'm paying both them and my team. So you're paying twice. The thing is

[03:47] is that when you do that, you're actually building the enterprise value of your business

[03:51] and you're building the asset that you own, rather than being reliant on somebody else who

[03:56] eventually could if you wanted to cut you off and then you'd be dead in the water. Or what

[04:01] more realistically happens is they gouge you and they continue to raise their price because they

[04:04] can see how much money you're making from the thing. With that new agency, we ran the same play.

[04:08] Hey, we want to learn from you. We want to understand why you're picking these things. We want to

[04:12] understand understand that it's just making process, et cetera. I start documenting what they're

[04:16] doing into our processes internally. We want to start co-creating. So they're making stuff for us

[04:21] and we're making stuff for us. And eventually our stuff for us starts to be as good and eventually

[04:26] better than the stuff that they make for us. And it should be because I'm only one client of many

[04:31] to them and I'm basically renting them as fractional labor with expertise at a premium. Once your

[04:37] team has the same amount of expertise or more, they should be better because one, they have more

[04:41] time because they're going to fully allocate their time to you. And secondly, because they will

[04:45] always have more context on your brand than an agent. Well, for having more time and more context,

[04:51] all we have to fill is the gap of expertise. And so once we have the expertise gap, then the

[04:56] inhouse team should be better than the advanced team. And then at that point, you decouple and you let

[05:01] them go. Do you want to make sure that you have a clear deadline for when you want to make that transition?

[05:06] And this is good for a couple reasons. One is because it's set set expectations with them. They can

[05:09] also see the LTV and you can talk in terms of that. Let's say it's $6,000 a month. I'm committing

[05:13] to $36,000. All right. So like you're going to get that for me as long as you're not an idiot.

[05:16] But the real real is that your team also knows that you're like, hey, we're all in my town. We

[05:20] got to understand the stuff in five months. Hey, we're too much down. We got to understand the stuff in

[05:24] four months. And so it drives you towards the outcome of getting your team up to speed faster.

[05:29] Now you have that deadline. But what if your team's not as good as theirs by the time the deadline comes?

[05:32] Well, in my opinion, you either need to change the people or they're not teaching everything

[05:36] that needs to happen because if they're low skilled people are doing better than your team,

[05:40] some who is a problem. Either them or you. Let's assume that the people are right and let me

[05:44] just just a more complex platform. Whatever, I keep going until our team matches theirs. Once our

[05:48] team matches theirs, then I drop it off. We downgraded to a consulting agreement just for insurance.

[05:52] One or two months later, if we feel like we're not learning anything on the calls that we have

[05:55] from a consulting perspective, we cut it. And we do so amicably because we set that as the expectation.

[06:00] That's how I grew my YouTube. So now let's approach the same concept but on different platform.

[06:04] I didn't understand TikTok at all. I didn't use it. I was on it. I actually had an HD reach out to me.

[06:09] Hop down, which is not common for me to accept that. But they said, listen, you do know work.

[06:14] So from a value perspective, the offer was, you're even enough content out there. I can repurposed

[06:18] and make sure that it was like, okay, sure. If you want to do all the work and involve me

[06:22] at nothing and just make content for me, it sounds good. And so that's what they did. And they

[06:26] started getting traction with the short videos and we're like, okay, this stuff works. And then for

[06:30] me, my director of brand actually had a super deep history on short-form content. And so

[06:37] normally I would have had that second phase where I would go for that premium agency. But that individual

[06:42] worked at a premium agency. And so I actually bought the SOPs automatically and we were able to

[06:48] massively scale our output on short content within six or so months of working with that original agency.

[06:54] And again, we're on good terms with the person in the agency. If you set the expectation of front,

[06:58] which is, I want to learn from you and I want to be transparent about my intentions.

[07:02] And I want to eventually bring this in house because it's my belief that my team will be able to

[07:05] out the more time than my thing and understand my brand better. And if they had your skills,

[07:08] they will be able to do more output at higher quality than you could ever do. You have to make

[07:12] a margin. I don't. I'm going to cover cost and get five times more output. This is what I believe

[07:16] has married the best parts of agency and the best part of building an enterprise and making

[07:21] you've had with business. And avoided the HTTRAP. So many people fall into it myself included.

[07:27] So the first agency experience I ever had was actually really good. I then worked with like

[07:31] 10 more agencies and all of them were terrible. And this is the exact process what happened.

[07:36] So reading directly from $100 a.l. leads. Step one, they got me excited about all the new

[07:40] leads they would break. Step two, I'd go through an onboarding process that felt valuable.

[07:45] And sometimes was, step three, they assigned their best senior rep to my account. Step four,

[07:50] I saw some results. Step five, they moved my senior rep to the newest customer. Step six,

[07:55] a junior rep starts managing my account. My results suffer. Step seven, I complain.

[07:59] Step eight, the senior rep would come back once in a while to make me feel better. Step nine,

[08:03] the results still never got back to where they were before. And I eventually canceled.

[08:07] Step 10, I'd search for another agency and repeat the cycle of insanity. Step 11,

[08:11] for the zillionth time, start wondering why wasn't it results like the first time?

[08:15] So how do you decide if using the agencies right for you? First off, do you have more money or

[08:19] more time? If you don't have any money, then you gotta learn it. And it's gonna take time. And you know what?

[08:23] That's part of life. Usually you master one platform, you get some success, you get a little bit

[08:27] cash flow, and then you can more quickly pay to learn the other ones. You pay down your

[08:30] ignorance as fast as faster. If you have the money, then for me, it's always worth paying none

[08:34] that debt. And that process is how we approached LinkedIn, how we approached podcasts, how we approached

[08:39] pay debts, all of them, I run the same playbook.

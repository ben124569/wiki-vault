[00:00] What's going on everyone?

[00:01] What I want to talk to you about today is a question

[00:03] that I get all the time, which is, how do I

[00:06] know I have a good market, right?

[00:08] Which is, what are the things I should be looking for

[00:10] to know I have a market that I should go after?

[00:13] And the first thing I want to address here is,

[00:15] I had this conversation yesterday, and so it's like,

[00:18] hey, I'm between dentists and hearing

[00:22] a specialist and pharmacists, right?

[00:24] For what market I want to go after and serve, right?

[00:26] And I was like, OK, cool.

[00:28] Well, what are the considerations, right?

[00:30] And they didn't know how to actually analyze each

[00:32] of those businesses.

[00:33] And so the first rule of thumb that I'll give anyone

[00:36] is, as long as the market is not dying and is either

[00:39] normal or growing, then which of the markets

[00:42] can you provide the most value to?

[00:44] So most value.

[00:46] And that's given your skill set.

[00:48] So if you have an advantage inherently or you have

[00:50] experience working with people in a specific marketplace,

[00:54] or especially if it's personal experience,

[00:56] then I would usually recommend going after that market first,

[00:59] because you know their pains, you know what it feels like.

[01:02] You will empathize with them and you ultimately

[01:03] create a better product that will provide more value to them,

[01:05] and you'll be able to win.

[01:06] Now, that's a great scenario.

[01:08] But many people I talk to you have basically no experience

[01:10] in any market.

[01:11] And I'm like, OK, well, then these are the four things

[01:14] that I look for, all right?

[01:16] So there is follows.

[01:18] The first thing that I'm going to look for is

[01:20] is the market in pain, all right?

[01:23] So do they have a desperate need for my product or services?

[01:28] A nice to have is not something people are going to take their money out

[01:30] and buy, especially in a bad economic condition, right?

[01:34] If we're in a good economic time when you're watching this,

[01:35] and that's awesome.

[01:36] And if we're in a bad one, then you'll know.

[01:39] So the first thing I'm looking for is do they have a desperate need?

[01:42] Are they starving for the thing that I'm looking for?

[01:45] There are some things that are timeless, right?

[01:47] Health, wealth, and relationships

[01:48] are the timeless needs of humanity, right?

[01:51] Are they sad and lonely?

[01:53] That's relationships.

[01:54] Are they broke?

[01:55] That's always pain.

[01:56] And health are they, are they feel bad about how they look

[02:00] and are they unhealthy, right?

[02:01] And so there's three big ones, right?

[02:03] But is there key pain that I'm solving?

[02:06] The second is the market growing, right?

[02:13] So I'll give you an example of this.

[02:15] I think I've told the story of my buddy

[02:17] who owned the newspaper company.

[02:18] He could not figure out why his company

[02:21] was not growing.

[02:22] And he called me up and I was like, dude, like, you're much smarter

[02:25] than I am.

[02:26] It's probably because you're selling a newspaper.

[02:28] He was like, no, no, no, I can't be that.

[02:29] And I was like, no, I think it's that.

[02:31] And as soon as he switched from selling newspapers

[02:33] to selling masks in manufacturing,

[02:36] he went from a few million dollars a year to $5 million a week.

[02:40] Same entrepreneur, simply applied it to a growing marketplace.

[02:46] The next thing that I'm looking for

[02:48] in terms of marketplace is,

[02:53] are they easy to find?

[02:55] All right, and this is important.

[02:59] Because if you're a marketing,

[03:03] and you can't find your prospects,

[03:05] if I'm marketing to plastic surgeons, for example,

[03:07] and the only people seeing my ads or nurses,

[03:10] then I'm not going to be able to get my product,

[03:12] my service in front of them,

[03:14] or even get my offer to them

[03:15] if they're impossible to find.

[03:17] And so whenever I'm picking a market,

[03:18] I'm going to try and find one

[03:20] that I can easily target that has associations.

[03:23] They have groups, they have channels,

[03:25] they all watch, they're all congregated in one place.

[03:27] And so that way I can cast my fishing line there,

[03:30] and then I can hook the clients

[03:32] that can take a step towards me.

[03:33] Because if you can't find them, they'll never find you.

[03:36] And so one, they have to be in pain,

[03:39] two, they have to be growing, three,

[03:41] they have to be easy to find.

[03:43] Now the fourth one is purchasing power.

[03:45] All right, which is, do they have the monies, right?

[03:48] Now a quick example of this is out of friend of mine

[03:50] who was looking at this and he was like,

[03:52] gee, I've got the perfect market.

[03:53] I'm going after unemployed people,

[03:55] and I want to coach them on how to do their resumes, right?

[03:58] Tons of pain, I'm not having a job.

[04:00] He said, it's definitely growing,

[04:01] because people are coming in out of the market,

[04:02] so there's tons of people that are coming in out.

[04:04] So my ads won't get fatigued, and I was like,

[04:06] okay, they're super easy to find,

[04:08] and I was like, that's great.

[04:09] But then, he was like, no one wants to buy my stuff

[04:12] because they all say they don't have jobs.

[04:15] And so he wasn't able to have the purchasing power

[04:18] from this target, right?

[04:20] And so let me give you an example of two different ways

[04:23] that you could use this framework, right?

[04:25] So let's say if I were a relationship coach,

[04:27] I was somebody who serves couples,

[04:29] or I'm good at helping people find love, right?

[04:31] Well, I'm going to look for a market

[04:33] that has all four of these things,

[04:35] which means instead of saying,

[04:36] I'm going to help college kids, right?

[04:40] For me, in my service business, find love,

[04:44] all right?

[04:44] Instead of having, that's a heart.

[04:46] College kids find love, what I would probably do

[04:48] is instead go after seniors, right?

[04:53] And maybe their second half of life

[04:55] to find their next partner,

[04:58] that would probably be where I'd focus in.

[05:00] And what happens there is seniors have tons of pain

[05:03] because they're alone.

[05:04] It's growing because people dying get older every day, right?

[05:07] They're easy to find, and I know that senior citizens

[05:10] in general have far more money than college kids do.

[05:13] Right?

[05:13] And so even though I have the same core value proposition,

[05:17] I'm choosing to serve a better market

[05:19] that I will ultimately probably make more money with, right?

[05:23] And so this is kind of the process that I look at.

[05:25] It's number one above all else,

[05:27] which market can I provide the most value to?

[05:29] If I have personal experience,

[05:30] that's going to trump everything.

[05:32] Now, if I don't have personal experience

[05:34] and I just have a skill of being able to market or sell

[05:36] or whatever, then I'm going to look at my market

[05:39] and in this four-piece pop system,

[05:43] whatever you want to say, checklist.

[05:45] And the thing is, is you can't just have three of them, right?

[05:48] In the newspaper example, they were in tons of pain,

[05:51] they were easy to find, and they had purchasing power.

[05:54] The problem is they weren't growing.

[05:55] They were shrinking every year, right?

[05:59] The unemployment example, they were growing, they were in pain,

[06:02] but they didn't have the purchasing power.

[06:04] So that's the problem there.

[06:06] The nurses and plastic surgeons example,

[06:09] that would be one where if I can't find them,

[06:11] then I can't just play the ads to them.

[06:12] And then obviously, if people don't want your product at all,

[06:16] it's just a nice to have, then they will not buy it.

[06:18] And so you want to make sure that you do not have one, two,

[06:21] three of these, you want to have all four in any market.

[06:23] You pick an ideally, pick a market that you already know

[06:26] you can provide value to, and solve a problem

[06:28] that meets these four criteria,

[06:30] and you'll have the recipe for success.

[06:32] So, both them made sense.

[06:33] That's how I look at markets.

[06:34] That's what I look at when I'm trying to invest in companies.

[06:36] I look at the founder, I see if they already have experience in this,

[06:39] and then I see if the problem that we're solving matches these things,

[06:42] and then at that point, I say, you know what?

[06:44] I think this is a good opportunity.

[06:45] Let's do it.

[06:46] I'll be enjoyed that, and see you in the next vid.

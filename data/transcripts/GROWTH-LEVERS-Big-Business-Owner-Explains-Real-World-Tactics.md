[00:00] I was able to take home more in a year than the CEO of McDonald's IKEA Ford Motorola and Yahoo combined as a kid in his 20s.

[00:11] So you guys want to hear something totally insane like completely out there while I was able to take home more in a year than the CEO of McDonald's IKEA Ford Motorola and Yahoo combined.

[00:29] As a kid in his 20s, that equated to $1.2 million per month in dividends for nearly the last half decade.

[00:38] Honestly, no one is more surprised than I have about that.

[00:43] And so me expressing this fact early on in this presentation in some people will create envy.

[00:48] It'll create anger and other people.

[00:50] It'll create skepticism in most and confusion in old folks.

[00:55] And hopefully it shouldn't inspire selects you.

[00:59] And so if that was you, then you were the people that I'm making this presentation for.

[01:04] I know exactly where you're at because I have been there and I will walk you through that.

[01:10] So I was talking at an event not that long ago and they had like levels to entrepreneurship and level seven was what they called me, which is like the highest level, which is kind of silly for me because I you'll see in a second why.

[01:24] And so I think that's the reason why I'm doing this is because I'm doing this.

[01:28] And so I think that's the reason why I'm doing this is because I'm doing this.

[01:33] And so I think that's the reason why I'm doing this is because I'm doing this.

[01:38] And so I think that's the reason why I'm doing this is because I'm doing this.

[01:43] And so I think that's the reason why I'm doing this is because I'm doing this.

[01:47] And so I want to actually want you to be rich except for you.

[01:51] And so it's only going to be up to you to get there and the nice thing about success habits and wealth and business is that even if you don't deserve it in terms of your character et cetera.

[02:03] If you still do the actions success does not care.

[02:06] So success is color blind success only cares about the work that is done third point that I've kind of found in my in my time.

[02:13] Money only solves money problems and then you're left with problems that money can't solve.

[02:18] And so I know a lot of you maybe maybe in a situation where like another you know more money feels like it will solve all your problems and I can tell you.

[02:26] It will it will just solve the ones that money can solve you will realize which is point four is that you don't actually arrive ever.

[02:34] You just enter a new club is the smallest member and so in the building that I live in it's almost exclusively eight nine and ten figure entrepreneurs.

[02:41] So eight is ten million nine is hundred million and ten is a billion the guy who lives directly above me so literally the unit directly above me he actually owns the entire building.

[02:51] And last year he did three point eight billion in sales top line he took home nine hundred and thirty million dollars in income.

[02:58] And so all that ends up happening is you you just get into a new club as the smallest member there's just levels to the game.

[03:06] And I'll just leave you with this one last thing for those you who see what I see on the internet world and the Instagram flexes is that everyone talks about the laptop lifestyle having a business that's been to cash flow for you pass a big kind of blah blah blah blah.

[03:19] This last year I did almost nothing.

[03:21] Workwise and our businesses generate a tremendous amount of cash flow.

[03:25] I can tell you that I was very miserable.

[03:27] I think that we need as a community to make work.

[03:31] Cool again because we kind of I see it all over the place especially in the entrepreneur's team of demonizing the grind demonizing the hustle demonizing putting the hours in and saying that like if you're business requires you that it's not a real business.

[03:45] And I think that it's a load of BS because after having now exited the business.

[03:50] I have a bit multiple businesses now.

[03:53] I can tell you it's not fun and I feel like what my end result of this entire process for me is that I start out freedom thinking that freedom and I didn't I had all my time when what I should have been pursuing was options.

[04:08] And so if you enjoy the work you do you have arrived.

[04:12] And so I can tell you right now and what I'm doing in 2022 is basically repositioning myself to get back 100% into the grind because I choose to and so anyways I wanted to just give you guys that because I know a lot of people are different different places but I just wanted to share some things that I wish I heard earlier on.

[04:27] So who wants to hear about some stuff that can shortcut your path to material success so you can ponder the purpose of achieving it to begin with let's rock and roll.

[04:33] All right, so here's a quick framework that I have for making offers.

[04:36] All right, and the reason that we're going to focus on offers is because I believe that they are the fastest shortcut to material success in a business.

[04:42] If I'm going to take a business over, I'm going to take a chunk of a business as an investor.

[04:46] The first thing I'm going to do is look at the offer stack, which is what are the things what are the sequence of offers we're going to make to the customers and prospects over there journey with the business.

[04:55] Now there's a lot of things that I covered in the book and I like I said earlier I could have covered every single one of them, but instead I'm going to cover four main ones.

[05:01] So these are the main things that I look at in the business and some of the issues that most business owners do with one is the commodity problem so the goal is to decommodate it.

[05:09] The second is making sure that we're actually talking the right avatar, who we think is going to be able to generate us the most long term lifetime revenue.

[05:16] All right, the third is that we're going to make sure that we can charge a premium price for the services and products that we sell.

[05:22] And so the fourth, I'm going to cover the value equation. All right, because it's probably the biggest takeaway of the book and it is probably is the concept that the book is based around.

[05:29] All right, scarcity urgency bonuses guarantees in naming are all things that will enhance the effectiveness of your offer.

[05:35] And I'll tell you at the end some some easy resources that I can give you guys for those.

[05:40] All right, cool. So we're going to cover these for and so let's rock and roll.

[05:44] So here's the problem right now if your ads are not converting well, so clicks and opt-ins.

[05:49] And or your sales team has trouble scaling so it means it takes too long to ramp up new reps.

[05:54] Then adjusting your offer is usually the issue. It's usually the core problem that most people don't say.

[05:59] All right, and so to catch fish you need bait or an offer.

[06:03] All right, and offer is the starting port of native trends that are passed from there.

[06:09] Let from putting them in exchange for their money. That is what an offer is.

[06:12] The reason I define is because it's good to have shared terminology.

[06:15] In offer is going to be the number one driver of success of any campaign and I'll prove it to you in a second.

[06:20] So what does it actually do? It will allow you to sell in a vacuum or category of one and forces customers to make a value space decision instead of a price based decision.

[06:29] All right, let's say that again, it will force your customers if done successfully to make a value based decision instead of a price based decision.

[06:39] All right, if someone makes a price based decision means they hold up two things. They say these are close enough. I will make a decision based on the price and I will choose the cheaper one because these two are comparable.

[06:49] If I make a values based decision, I say this is the only thing I have nothing else I can compare to and therefore I must accept the price that is being charged if I deem value sufficient.

[07:00] And so the goal is to decommodate the offer that we are selling so that we can sell in a category of one and you can do this in any type of business that you have.

[07:10] And so when you do this successfully, you will increase the click the rates on your offers on any platform you're doing, whether it's cold outbound, whether it's cold emails, whether it's ads, whether it's earns media, whether it's to your list.

[07:23] It doesn't matter where you're presenting the actual offer, where those that offer sits with eyeballs, wherever the eyeballs are, if you make a decommodatized offer that is value based rather than price driven, you will increase the number of clicks that you get.

[07:36] You'll increase the percentage of those clicks that convert and you'll increase the price at which those people purchase.

[07:43] All right, and so the simple translation for that for those who are hopefully not bored at your mind with the concept or with the marketing jargon is you get more leads.

[07:53] You get more sales and higher prices and each of those multiply.

[07:57] So if you could two extra leads, two X the conversion on those leads which is now a 4X and then you can increase your price by two X that is an 8X increase in business.

[08:07] That is why the offer is still important and so strong.

[08:11] So I'm going to give you guys a real life example. So the B2C weight loss right now is $99 a month. If we're going to try and sell that, right, for $99 a month, I could not do it. I failed miserable.

[08:22] And so what I had to do when I was trying to I couldn't even give this away for create. We transformed this offer into a free six week challenge by doing that. What ended up happening is we changed a not even break even offer.

[08:36] So we're going to do it.

[08:38] So we're going to do it.

[08:40] So we're going to do it.

[08:42] So we're going to do it.

[08:44] So we're going to do it.

[08:46] So we're going to do it.

[08:48] So we're going to do it.

[08:50] So we're going to do it.

[08:52] So we're going to do it.

[08:54] So we're going to do it.

[08:56] So we're going to do it.

[08:58] So we're going to do it.

[09:00] So we're going to do it.

[09:02] So we're going to do it.

[09:04] So we're going to do it.

[09:06] So we're going to do it.

[09:08] So we're going to do it.

[09:10] So we're going to do it.

[09:12] So we're going to do it.

[09:14] So we're going to do it.

[09:16] So we're going to do it.

[09:18] So we're going to do it.

[09:20] So we're going to do it.

[09:22] So we're going to do it.

[09:24] So we're going to do it.

[09:26] So we're going to do it.

[09:28] So we're going to do it.

[09:30] So we're going to do it.

[09:32] So you could 22x the difference that you got.

[09:34] And it did the same thing in the first one, same thing in the second.

[09:36] We're talking 20x 30x increased the return on ads.

[09:38] Been with that people for you guys.

[09:40] This is what happened before with the agency offer.

[09:42] OK.

[09:44] If you look here, I have this chart.

[09:46] And this is these are the actual numbers.

[09:48] So when the guys were spending $10,000 a month, they reached $300,000.

[09:52] People, the response rate was 0.001.3.

[09:54] The number of employment said book was 40.

[09:56] The show rate was 75.

[09:58] The point of the show, 30, you know, closing percentage was 16%.

[10:02] When the show was five prices of $1,000, right?

[10:04] So they'd make $5,000 off $10,000.

[10:06] These are the real numbers.

[10:08] OK.

[10:09] Now when we introduced the new grant-same offer.

[10:12] And the new offer that we gave them was pay us one time.

[10:15] And we will work all of your leads for you.

[10:17] And then you only pay us again after this first payment.

[10:20] After someone shows up.

[10:22] So only pay us when someone shows up after you sign up with us.

[10:26] That's it.

[10:27] You pay me once a day.

[10:28] I said everything up.

[10:29] And from that point going forward, you never have to pay me again unless someone walks

[10:31] in your dream.

[10:32] So check out the difference here.

[10:33] So the advertising spend was equivalent between day one.

[10:35] It says 10,000, 10,000.

[10:37] Impressions are the same because, you know, add still cost the same amount.

[10:40] But here's what's crazy.

[10:42] Two and a half-sex increase in response rate.

[10:44] OK.

[10:45] Two and a half-sex.

[10:47] But that's just step one.

[10:48] Now the changing result is we go from 40 points to 100

[10:51] appointments for that $10,000.

[10:53] That's fine.

[10:54] Show rate was the same.

[10:55] Nothing changed there.

[10:56] But now we have 75 people showed up rather than 30.

[10:59] And here's the next crazy part.

[11:01] Is that rather than closing 16% which is what they were doing with their

[11:04] commoditized offer at a lower price.

[11:06] They were now closing 37%.

[11:08] That's 2.3x.

[11:09] All right.

[11:10] So more people were now buying more.

[11:13] OK.

[11:14] And so now look at the difference in appointments closed.

[11:16] You have five appointments closed versus 28.

[11:18] That's the result.

[11:19] And here's the saving crazy.

[11:21] They were closing 16% of the $1,000 price point.

[11:23] But with the new offer, the grand slam offer, they were closing that at four times

[11:28] the price.

[11:29] Four times the price.

[11:31] And so this was the end result.

[11:32] For that same $10,000 that's been used to get them five clients at $5,000

[11:37] month and there's their $5,000.

[11:39] Instead now they got 28 customers at $4,000 upfront with a continuity program that

[11:45] had, well, I call an implied guarantee.

[11:47] But you don't want to get into today.

[11:48] But basically any kind of performance offer that you can make is always an implied guarantee.

[11:52] And so they were making $112,000 simply by changing the offer, which is a 22.4x increase in cash collected

[11:59] upfront.

[12:00] And that doesn't even include the lifetime value on the back.

[12:03] So you guys get in how powerful this is.

[12:05] The difference between 0.5 and 11.2.

[12:07] They didn't even change the creative.

[12:09] They just changed the offer.

[12:10] They didn't change their funnels.

[12:11] They didn't change their nurture sequence.

[12:13] They didn't change any of that stuff.

[12:15] They just changed what they were offering to them marketplace.

[12:18] All right.

[12:19] So right now, can you think about your business?

[12:20] How if you could change that core thing?

[12:22] How different the outcomes could be?

[12:24] Cool.

[12:25] So everyone feel good about that in terms of understanding why it's so important and why the goal

[12:28] should to not be a commodity, but actually sell in a category of one with an offer that's so good

[12:34] that people feel stupid saying, no.

[12:35] Does that make sense?

[12:36] That is why this is so important because otherwise you're going to be price compared.

[12:40] You're going to have lower conversions.

[12:41] You're going to have lower people show up.

[12:43] You're going to be able to only sell low prices and you're ultimately just going to be like everybody else.

[12:47] And everybody else is broken.

[12:48] So don't be like that.

[12:49] So step number two is make sure that we find the right market.

[12:52] All right.

[12:53] So this is kind of an interesting concept.

[12:56] So I was at a and if the picture is blurry, it's because my picture is actually blurry.

[13:00] I couldn't find a sharp one.

[13:02] So I went to this mastermind.

[13:05] And in the room, the entire group was doing actually was 600 million in top line revenue.

[13:10] So the highest guy was doing 250 million.

[13:12] Small sky was doing seven second smallest guy at the time was doing 35.

[13:16] And everybody else was in between.

[13:19] And so I was sitting there and you know, I was watching this guy's due to their presentations.

[13:23] And I just I was left with this feeling.

[13:25] I was like, why these guys make you more money.

[13:27] I was like, I couldn't get it.

[13:28] Like I was just like, I was losing my mind to try to figure this out.

[13:31] Right.

[13:32] And then it dawned on me.

[13:33] I thought it was just like going on these blocks.

[13:35] I was like, they're just going after better markets.

[13:37] That's all like that was it.

[13:39] Like it wasn't there better at sales.

[13:41] Wasn't there better at marketing?

[13:42] Wasn't like there better at effedome.

[13:44] And I was like, I know that we're now in these things.

[13:46] Because when I was talking to them, I didn't feel like they I lack something.

[13:49] It was just because they were running after the right market.

[13:51] All right.

[13:52] And so there you go.

[13:54] It's almost like I made this presentation.

[13:56] And that was the conclusion.

[13:57] I did pick better markets.

[13:58] And so what I want to do is because this is probably the number one question I get from people who are new

[14:02] or in the entrepreneurial space.

[14:03] And so here's the quick answer that I give most people.

[14:06] If you're trying to figure out who you're going to serve right in your early or on in your journey.

[14:10] The way to pick that person is select the after you can provide much value to your period.

[14:14] So if you have like two or three people we're trying to decide between.

[14:17] Pick the guy you can provide much value to.

[14:19] That's the game.

[14:20] Number two.

[14:21] The medium answer.

[14:22] You want to make sure that you pick a single avatar so that you can productize your service and

[14:26] provide that value with low operational drag.

[14:28] So let me give you an example.

[14:29] So if you were to help one hire a tractor do something right and generate leads or whatever.

[14:35] Then you would probably it would take you a lot of work to get that first guy going right.

[14:39] But if you had a hundred car practice your hundredth car practice you probably have a lot of that stuff pre built and pre made right.

[14:46] Which means the amount of time and effort that it would take you to do that hundredth one is very low.

[14:50] And on top of that through that hundred iterations you probably get better and better and better.

[14:55] And so here's what happens.

[14:56] The value that you provide actually increases and the cost to you actually decreases which means it's a big

[15:02] discrepancy between what that person is now getting and how much it costs you and we call that profit which is the point right.

[15:09] And so the reason that we niche down when we're picking our markets is so that we can ultimately make more money.

[15:15] And I don't have this example in the presentation but right now if I would say hey guys I have a time management product right and.

[15:23] If I if I was selling it and you go to Barnes and Noble's or whatever you probably find it for nineteen bucks right it's just time.

[15:28] Cool.

[15:29] If I were to say hey.

[15:31] Same product.

[15:32] But now it's time management for sales people.

[15:35] Can you all of a sudden imagine that product being like a ninety nine dollar product like.

[15:39] Oh, okay, I could imagine that being a ninety nine dollar product.

[15:42] All right.

[15:43] Now let's niche down a little further and say well of the people that kids you know make the most money with time.

[15:48] Just sales people definitely will will make more money with save time but what about outbound sales people.

[15:52] We can make it even more specific to talk about their pain points et cetera.

[15:55] And so we now make it an outbound sales rep time management course or book right and now this is probably like can you imagine that's more probably more like a 500 or.

[16:05] Right, so you're not bound sales rep time management for outbound sales reps.

[16:09] Ah, so what if we niche down even further and we said.

[16:13] Outbound power tools and gardening sales reps time management.

[16:20] All of a sudden this product goes from 500 to a two thousand dollar product right now here's what's crazy about this.

[16:27] The product remains virtually unchanged.

[16:30] The only thing we did is we defined to the opportunity.

[16:33] And we got narrower and narrower and narrower and so right now if you're thinking like the goal is that that prospect when they reach your persuasion they reach your copy.

[16:41] The goal is not for them for for them to understand what you are writing the goal is for them to feel understood.

[16:49] And that is the goal of great persuasion is that they feel understood.

[16:53] That's the point and so the better we can articulate their problems and their reality to them the more they will be willing to purchase our product right and the more what we want them to feel is this is just for me.

[17:04] And that's the goal right and so when we're picking that market right.

[17:08] Let's go back to our presentation.

[17:10] This is my live speech answer which is what you guys see again.

[17:12] So I give you the quick answer which is provide go go pick the guy you can provide them as value to the media mancer is.

[17:18] Zero win on that niche and go really hard on it so that you can eventually productize your service and decrease your operational drag.

[17:25] But here's my live speech answer all right.

[17:27] So right now let's pretend we're in class right and there's a marketing professor that's that's in front of the in front of in front of us right and he says.

[17:35] Everybody here is now been gifted a hot dog stand and you're now forced to be in the hot dog stand business.

[17:40] If you had one competitive advantage for your hot dog stand.

[17:44] What would it be? Well, I'll tell you in this I think this may actually be a real story so I'm not sure.

[17:48] And so in the classroom all these people started charting shouting out all those things right you know better in pretty and so like stuff right and after everyone died down he said.

[17:57] The secret is that you want to start and cry.

[18:00] Because when the football game lets out at three o'clock in the afternoon and everyone's starting and drunk.

[18:06] You want to be the guy on the hot dog stand decor and you could have the worst hot dogs that were wildly overpriced and you would still sell out because when you have starving crowd when the supply demand curve is in your favor.

[18:16] It's hard to not make money and not make lots of it.

[18:19] Okay, and so when we're looking at the market.

[18:22] These are the four attributes that I look for when I'm looking to pursue a market.

[18:26] Okay.

[18:27] Good right these down.

[18:28] Number one is I want them to not just desire but be in desperate need of the solution that I have.

[18:34] All right, I don't want people who are merely aroused. I want people who are a ravenous for a solution.

[18:40] Number two, they must have the ability to purchase the product that I want at the price that I want to charge.

[18:46] Number three, they must be easy to target.

[18:49] I can't target them. I can't put my offer in front of them. I also believe not be able to reach them in self.

[18:54] And then number four, I want to make sure that it's growing market.

[18:57] All right, so let's dive in.

[18:59] So one of the things that I have in my sales team is the pain is the pitch, right. And like I said earlier, the point of good writing is for the reader to understand the point of good persuasion is for the prospect of you understood.

[19:09] All right, and so the goal here is that we want them to feel understood in the copy, which is why niche and down is so important.

[19:15] Right, it's very difficult to make someone feel unique and single doubt if you're talking to the masses, right, which is why it's so amazing that some of these mass market brands that do exist.

[19:24] But most of them start small and then continue to scale in adjacent markets, all right. So we want to make sure that they're in desperate need. Number two.

[19:32] So a friend of mine had a really good process for improving people's resumes so they could get more job interviews like you had a really dialed in process.

[19:40] And he looked at these four things and he was like, well, this is I think this will absolutely crush.

[19:45] And as you guys might even imagine,

[19:49] his improving people's resumes that he could get more interviews, it actually takes.

[19:54] And the reason was, the pitch, it was a growing market. It was easy to find the unemployed people. They weren't desperate pain, but they had no money.

[20:03] Right, so you had a really hard time charging the amount that he wanted for the service that he had.

[20:08] Right, and so we got to make sure that whatever market you're zeroing in on, they can afford you.

[20:13] And the thing is, there is a market out there that is a desperate need of the solution that you have.

[20:17] Find them, right, and they will pay you what you're worth.

[20:20] Life's too short to do what people don't appreciate you, all right.

[20:24] So number three, this one is very tactical, right.

[20:28] But if you're trying to sell to rich doctors and your ads or your offers are only being displayed to nurses,

[20:35] it's going to fall in debt fears, no matter how good the offer is, no matter how good your funnels are, no matter how good your sales team is, no matter how the product is, you're just not reaching it.

[20:42] Right, and so if your people are not activated somewhere in association, spruits, list channels, etc., then just don't pick it.

[20:47] Because at the end of the day, like business is hard enough on its own, myis will just make the things have as many tailwinds behind you as you possibly can, because the thing is, it's ultimately our choice.

[20:55] Right, whatever business or market place we choose to get into, it's our choice.

[20:58] So myis will pick one that's going to be easy to work on.

[21:01] This is a little bit of a tactical point, but this is just through my experience of dealing with lots of companies and having owned scale lots of companies,

[21:06] it's much easier to deal with ones that are easy to target.

[21:09] All right, and so here's the fourth one, and this probably one of my favorite stories.

[21:12] So Warren Buffett was doing an interview and he was talking about his best friend at Columbia, and so this is before he was more above, but he was just a nerdy kid who liked finance at this point, right?

[21:23] And he said there was a young gentleman who he had maritalot who he thought was, you know, incredibly sharp,

[21:29] and tremendous work ethic, high integrity, and he was somebody that he's proud to be associated with, and ultimately when they graduated Columbia, they split, they split ways, right?

[21:37] One person went into steel, and that he obviously went into his partnership that eventually became her traveling, right?

[21:44] And what's interesting is he said when he looks back on his life, one of the most important lessons that happened is that that individual, that man, that friend of his, he said he would achieve some material success, he said, but nothing, you know, nothing really remarkable.

[21:55] And he said that that lesson from that man was singular and it's important because what it taught him was, it is far more important, what boat you are in, rather than how hard you are.

[22:05] It is far more important, what boat you are in, rather than how hard you are.

[22:10] And so a lot of you, a lot of us as entrepreneurs, we pick these huge challenges that, and we're just rolling and rolling and rolling and trying to outpace the current that's going in the other direction.

[22:19] And so there's an old VC saying that's a venture capital saying where it's great entrepreneur in bad market market wins, bad entrepreneur, and great market market wins, right?

[22:32] And so the point is is that the market matters more than anything when people are actually investing in businesses, they actually look, they're like, what markets don't want to get exposed to, because they know that even if we're mediocre and the market quadruples, then we will quadruple even if we're average.

[22:45] And so we might as well have the tailwind and I'll tell you one final story about this. So good friend of mine Lloyd really sharp entrepreneur, he had a software company and it grew and then all of a sudden he started stagnating, right?

[22:57] This is probably like six or seven years ago and he's and for six or seven years I saw him really struggle right to grow the business and he was he was in the newspaper business, right?

[23:07] So he was selling an ad product to newspapers and one time we're having dinner he's like, I just don't know it's going on, he's like, I'm even in my office, a revshare model, like it's they only get, you know, I only get paid if they make money.

[23:17] You know, we've got a great outpand team, we've got a great sales team, like I just I don't know what the problem is and I'm looking at him from across the table and I was like, you serious?

[23:25] Yeah, I was like, dude, you're selling an newspapers they're dying they're losing 25% per year compounding 25% of newspapers better business every year and they have for the last eight years and so that's how big the market was that's how much the market was shrinking annually compounded against him.

[23:40] And this is probably of the four factors the biggest one that we have to look at when we're trying to pick our market is we might as well pick the right boat.

[23:47] One that has a tie that's behind it with a heavy you know with a good wind going in the right direction because no matter what business is going to be hard we might as well have one that's going in the right direction.

[23:55] So those are the four components picking the right market was that useful for you guys in terms of making sure that you're niching down.

[24:01] picking people who have have pain have purchasing power are easy to find and are growing.

[24:07] All right, we want to market that is growing there's more of them every year right if you're getting into silver sneakers and retirement homes.

[24:14] There are 10,000 people retiring a day and there's not nearly 10,000 units of retirement homes available right which means that that's probably going to be something that if you're in that space you're going to make a lot of money simply because of supply to man.

[24:25] And we're either have this chip stack in our favor so I want to play money game and this is not in the book so you guys pay attention to this and this is actually on my favorite money games of all time okay.

[24:33] So.

[24:34] Let's say that this is your business you can see the stats on the left there and hopefully it's clear for you.

[24:39] Let's say that you have a business to get 30 new clients a month.

[24:42] Let's say you're churn meaning the percentage customers at least every month were active is 33% that means that the average customer stays for three months okay.

[24:49] Let's say the price of your service whatever it is the hundred dollars a month I'm using simple math here okay and so that would mean that you're total number of clients that you can actively manage is 100 because every time you send up 30 30 more leave and it's just around and around and it maintains it on.

[25:02] All right, let's see your net margins are 20%.

[25:05] So that would mean that your revenue is 10,000 dollars a month and your profits do 1000 bucks.

[25:09] All right, is everyone with me so far, everyone good with this.

[25:12] So let's say we rub a magic water bottle right and this magic water bottle is a very specific niche water bottle because this niche water water bottle creates a niche to genie okay and so the little niche genie comes out of the the the the bottle and says I am a business gin.

[25:29] You're like oh wow, it's got some tons right this is I can double one aspect of your business and you must pick which of the three you wish me to do right so it's a very niche genie are very particular about his about his wish selection but you know we're like hey I'll take a wish if I can get one right and so these are the three doors that he offers us okay.

[25:48] 

[26:18] So the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's

[26:48] the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the one thing that's the

[27:18] one because that customer is now worth twice as much to you, but you only have to spend this amount of amount of money that it costs you to acquire that same 30 right so now you're you're still spending the same amount you're still acquiring 30 customers but now they're worth twice as much right and so by doing that you actually make a little bit more than twice the profit door one is the quote worst door.

[27:38] The second runner up or the first runner up rather is doubling the number of purchases or decreasing turn in half and as you can imagine the best choice was choice two which is doubling the price of your product of service and here's why this is so crazy.

[27:53] So I'm going to walk you through this and I'm going to use my hands, all right, so if we rent ten thousand dollars a month with a 20% margin then means we're making 2000.

[28:03] Now all of a sudden we doubled our price now we're at 20,000 dollars a month but we changed nothing about what we were selling and providing which means that additional 10,000 dollars a month is pure profit.

[28:16] Which means we took our profit from 2000 dollars a month to 12,000 dollars a month which means we six acts our income.

[28:26] People talk about making 20% increases this is a 600% increase.

[28:31] That my friends is the power of price which I wanted to use that story to introduce the pricing section which is why it's called the charge what it's worth.

[28:40] And right now many of you are under charging and ultimately under providing value because you are not charging the right amount of money.

[28:46] All right, so I'm going to give you a few frameworks that have served me well here.

[28:49] So this one is called the price of the dollar discrepancy.

[28:52] The goal of any business is to have a price.

[28:56] It means it's.

[28:58] I've heard you, uh, you know a dollar for something.

[29:02] I want you to get $10 for the value right which is why you want to continue to business makes every time you give me a dollar if you get $10 a per se value back.

[29:09] You're going to want to do that trade as much as you know as many times you possibly can right right.

[29:13] So many of you probably pay more than you currently do if you're an Netflix subscription you might pay $20 a month if they raised it and be okay with it they might pay $30 a month.

[29:21] But the amount of access they leave there is the customer surplus.

[29:24] So, right, and so you can see there there's the value and the price and we always want to make sure that the price is below the value.

[29:29] Here's what happens with most businesses though most businesses charge their their their price is actually above their value which is why they never get repeat customer because their product is shit right.

[29:40] If you charge at your value someone will purchase they will be negative they will be positive to the move right.

[29:45] And so there's two real options here.

[29:48] We can either increase that discrepancy by lowering our price so let's say our values fixed right if we lower our price we have a discrepancy right the other option is to raise our value right and I can tell you one of those is going to make you a lot more money.

[30:01] All right and I'm sure you already know which one it is which is increasing your value all right so.

[30:06] This is what most people do and why you should charge so much that it hurts most business owners are not competing on price or value.

[30:13] In fact, they're not actually competing on anything at all they're pricing process typically look something like this and this may be some of your guys this process you look at the marketplace.

[30:21] You see what out whatever one else is offering you take the average you go slightly below to remain competitive.

[30:27] Provide with the competitions offering with a little bit more and then end up with a value proposition of a little more for little less.

[30:34] So losing proposition you're not going to win that way and so what I want to do is introduce you to a very different framework to think through this all right and this is called the vicious the virtuous versus vicious cycle of price all right.

[30:46] So this is what happens when you raise your prices all right so if you have any type of business where someone is required to do something right like on exposition right you guys are required to do something.

[30:58] In order to succeed right we have to work now if we raise our prices this is what happens if you raise your price you increase the emotional investment of the person if you pay ten thousand dollars for a book versus a dollar for a book.

[31:14] What do you think the likelihood is that you're going to read and finish the book if you pay ten thousand dollars very high so same book because we increase the price we increase the like do the person actually doesn't.

[31:23] Which if we're saying that we're trying to help people then it is ethically our prerogative to get them as emotionally invested as possible which means we should use one of the tools we have our availability which is price.

[31:35] The second is that if you buy a ten thousand dollar book versus a one dollar book what is your perceived value.

[31:40] You will probably believe that the value is going to be far superior even if you change nothing.

[31:45] I'll give you a quick story on this so right now they did a they did a research study with this but they had.

[31:52] Tasters drink wine all right and so they gave them three wines they had cheap wine.

[31:57] A mid to your wine and a high to your wine and they told them the price and everything on the bottles and they had them trying and they had them wrinkled right and they could see the prices area.

[32:05] And so unsurprisingly they rang the best on the best the middle on the middle and the cheapest one the the worst right.

[32:11] But here was what's crazy.

[32:13] All three bottles to the exact same wine.

[32:18] So in a very real way price confers value to the product of service that you provide.

[32:24] The reason the Louis Vuitton person person means more to you is partially because it is so expensive.

[32:31] Because it costs as so much time and effort to save the money to make the purchase it partially gets it it imprints that value on to the product so why not use that to our advantage.

[32:42] And especially if we're going to make a lot more money doing.

[32:45] The third piece is that if someone's more emotionally invested and they perceive it as more valuable they're going to get better results of the prices higher right.

[32:52] The demanding is the customer and some of you guys will probably know this have you guys noticed that your cheapest customers are the worst people and the ones who pay you the most are the easiest to do it.

[33:01] Right so when you raise your price you get more of the good people and fewer of the bad people right hey fifty dollars a month you should be on call for me twenty four hours a day.

[33:11] And I don't know if I like you more than my wife and then finally and this is one of the key points that drives me drives the decision home for me is that the revenue for fulfillment for customer.

[33:21] So if you triple you know the profit that you make on a sale then you have three times the amount of resources compared to your competitor to provide the value that you promised.

[33:30] And ultimately in doing that you actually provide a better product and so that is why this played a virtual cycle because the more increased price the more increased their emotional investment.

[33:38] The more increased their perceived value of the product that you're getting better results they get the less demanding they are just the less operational drag you have to do with.

[33:45] And ultimately the better product that you'll be able to fill because you can keep your promises because you have profit left over.

[33:52] And then it's what all the.

[33:54] And the world is.

[33:55] It's.

[33:56] People care less they they value at less they get worse results they're more demanding and you have even less resources left over to hire amazing people.

[34:03] To give them amazing experience because they're so little profit left over right would that would be a vicious cycle.

[34:08] And then for you is the business owner so that which is from the client's perspective for you is a business owner if you increase your price you increase your profit.

[34:16] If you increase your price you increase your perceived value of self because who here would rather sell a hundred thousand or think than a ten thousand.

[34:23] It's a ten thousand right your own perceived value of what I am worth because of the value I know I can drive those up.

[34:31] All right and your perception of impact because I'll balance with you like businesses can get hard.

[34:35] But if you're not reminded constantly on a daily basis of the good you were doing the impact or making the customers that you have that are seeing amazing results and success from whatever experience or transformation you provide.

[34:44] If you don't have that you're going to be lost eventually you're going to burn out but if you do have that because you raised your price and you had profit to give every investment business and create amazing experiences then you'll feel better right your service level will go up.

[34:58] And then finally and this is a key one.

[35:00] If you have a sales team or if you're the sales team because of the emotional investment for she value results and and the amount of extra profit you left over for the experience that you want to build.

[35:09] You will be convicted that you can fulfill the promises that you made and the number one thing that converts prospects into customers is their belief that you will actually be able to help them and that belief starts with you because the end of the day sales is a transfer of some conviction from you to them for a bridge of trust right that is the point that is how it works and so if you don't have the conviction to start with even if you have the trust you'll never be able to transfer it because you don't actually have the conviction yourself and so when we think in this way.

[35:38] We realize that raising our prices having increased profits is not only a good thing to do business wise but also the ethical thing to do.

[35:46] If you want to provide your customers with the true result that you promise them all right and so the goal here which I wrote here on the right is to be so much higher that a consumer thinks to themselves.

[35:55] This is so much more expensive there must be something entirely different going on here and it forces them to pull you out of that commoditized category and to a category of one so they consider you on your own and your own merits of the offer itself.

[36:07] And then making values based decision you guys dig in this is this cool interesting sweet okay that is framework number three which is charging what it's worth I'm doing okay on time so all we're going into the fourth fourth fourth quarter okay which is the value creation and this is the concept that this book is really centered around all right which is this value equation so until you quick story so.

[36:30] I did this I did this presentation this was a two-day event that we held and this is actually a fulfillment event this is not a sales event for for my company and so every single picture every single head that you see in this in this room paid forty two thousand dollars to be there.

[36:47] And if you're keeping track from home and you're trying to count forty two thousand started the bottom and go to the left.

[36:53] There's seven hundred people all right it's a very big room is very deep and I remember the morning after I thought kind of hungover because I've been speaking for two straight days.

[37:03] And my dad called me up and he sounded really concerned so I like rolled out a bed and I was like I hold on I like put a hoodie on a start walking the whole way he was like hey I thought I thought that event that you had was only for your high-slip of comments and I was like yeah, it was like no I mean the forty two thousand dollar people and I was like yeah it was.

[37:21] And he was like you had so many people there how could how could you have them all pay forty two thousand dollars to be there is like do they do they know you're charging them that much money this is my dad right I was like.

[37:34] Yeah, they're aware that I'm charging I'm not magically siphoning money from their bank I was like they're aware.

[37:39] And he's like I mean I hope what you're selling is worth it. It's my father my own father sells me this right.

[37:46] And so you know as much as that might have stung in the moment right I realized that it was just a lack of understanding he didn't get how value worked.

[37:54] And so I said well let me walk you through anything.

[37:57] I said if right now because he is a small business and I said hey if I were able to increase your top line revenue by 239 thousand dollars a year.

[38:06] Would you pay me 42 grand he's like well it depends he said what would I have to do.

[38:13] And I was like well you'd have to work 15 hours a week more to do the system he was like okay.

[38:20] He's like how do I how do I like like do I know is a guarantee like how do I know that that's what I'm going to get and I was like that's just the average means half of people do better than if you think you're above average than you did more than.

[38:31] And so I was like okay.

[38:34] And how long would it take for me to get that result and I was like 11 months on average.

[38:41] And he was like so it took me 11 months that's the app.

[38:46] And I was like yeah he's like yeah then I would pay 42 thousand dollars a year for that and I was like exactly and that's why they did too.

[38:57] And so ultimately that is a premium price experience that I have lived through all right so that's 700 people at our highest level in our gym Lord business which is licensing business who paid as 28 million a year just from the highest level okay.

[39:09] And the reason that is important is that you can absolutely charge a very large amount of money.

[39:15] If you can provide value for an access of that who here would pay you know 40 thousand dollars to make an extra 200 and 40 thousand dollars on average.

[39:23] And so that's the reason that is why I was with the terms yes and that is why these people do too and so if you want to raise your prices you must ultimately raise your value and the reason I part of the reason I wrote this book is because I hear the term value thrown around in the entrepreneurial community.

[39:37] All day long provide value give value blah blah blah blah right.

[39:41] But no one actually defines what the term means so this is my best effort to defining it so there's four variables to the value equation.

[39:49] You've got a numerator and a denominator you guys can remember from grade school all right the numerator's the top denominator's the bottom.

[39:55] All right, and so if you're trying to make a bigger value or bigger number here the goal is to maximize the top and minimize the bottom right right so let's go through the first one.

[40:03] The first one here is whoops there we go dream outcome all right so the dream outcome is simply to demonstrate that the person must desperately desire what it is you are selling.

[40:14] Sometimes you guys are selling things that no one actually wants which is why no one buys the dream outcome doesn't even match right you're trying to sell you know automation a doctor's or something like they don't care whatever right.

[40:24] You don't actually want to be selling ice-sat's because I like I got plenty of ice and I don't know that right so as much as that saying is cute it's also not very business that right and so dream outcome is is number one and so the reason that this is so important is that.

[40:37] If let's say for men for example most men get more status from having money than being you know thin right and so if I were to survey guys would you rather be a millionaire would you rather be thin most guys would choose million right right and so that means that as a category overall.

[40:55] Men will value money more than their appearances which is why you know you see I don't even get into this more than that but hopefully you should understand that which is why the entire category of making making people make more money return on investment etc has higher price tags in general.

[41:10] Okay and that is what differentiates if you have two different things one is helps guys make more money and the other one helps them lose weight but one that helps guys make more money in general be priced higher now.

[41:19] What happens if you have two products that are in the same category and one sells for fifty thousand one sells for five dollars.

[41:25] Well the reason that you have the other.

[41:27] You have that price discrepancy to do two things in the same dream outcome is the other three variables right how come life of section is fifty thousand dollars and a weight loss of the five bucks even though the dream outcome of weight loss is the same right right so that brings us to the second part of this equation.

[41:42] That which is perceived like a legitimate if I'm buying a five dollar ebook what do I really think my perceived like good is that I'm actually going to lose weight and look amazingly down the company for five bucks for any book probably pretty long I'm not even not even reading right I'm going to even check my email right now on the flip side if I pay fifty thousand one for life was actually what's the likely that I think it's actually going to happen really freaking high right.

[42:04] I think if you have a different version to illustrate this concept of how increasing the perceived like the achievement actually increases the value in charge right this is the front end.

[42:12] So let's say in that life of section eight simply got two doctors you can pick from you got a doctor his fresh out of medical school is never cut into a person you're going to be his first patient.

[42:20] And then the second doctor has done this procedure specifically for you ten thousand times for people just like you which guy are you going to pick.

[42:29] Doctor two with ten thousand successful surgeries or doctor one with zero.

[42:34] This guy not only that you would probably be way more willing to pay way more money for this guy even though the actual surgery dream outcome time under the knife would remain the same.

[42:45] And that's because you we can for value based on our perception of the likelihood that the person is going to be provide us the service that we have.

[42:52] I had a different price point for my business when I had a hundred testimonials versus two thousand.

[42:58] Because that was the that was and so if or any by the way if any guys ever have the racist did you get better over time.

[43:03] You say that was the hundred testimonial price because there was lower perceived like the achievement now got two thousand you know it's going to work the goal of the top is to increase it.

[43:10] Now most starter marketers only focus on the top half the equation when you look at the biggest businesses in the world.

[43:16] They actually put all their attention on the bottom half which is actually where the competitive moke from operations occurs okay.

[43:23] So the third variable here is time to light which is how long between when I purchase and when I get so if I were to click a button on the internet for a weight loss product and all of a sudden I pulled my shirt up and I had a six pack.

[43:34] Imagine how infinitely valuable that product would be and to give a different twist on the example imagine I had a marketing agency and I signed some one up and most are getting a community interested in.

[43:44] I'm not going to take to use a right.

[43:46] You know do all these things whereas the one that I just signed up for the agency that I created as soon as I signed the paper my phone rings the qualified appointment and say hey I just saw your ad imagine the difference in value.

[43:58] The difference there even though that might have happened 60 days later in the in the second example is time to light fast beats free the easiest way to provide value in any marketplaces look whatever one else is doing it do it in half the time.

[44:10] All right, so that is an element and the third component of value goes to decrease it and then finally.

[44:16] We have effort in sacrifice right and effort in sacrifice or two sides at the same point effort is things that you must now start doing that you do not want to do that you must do as a result of a purchase.

[44:28] So for example, I'm you I'll use weight loss because we can keep it in consistent.

[44:40] If if I have to start waking up earlier in the morning then that is effort if I have to endure being sore that is effort if I have to give up drinks with the girls on Saturdays and margarita Mondays then those are sacrifices right.

[44:56] And I like putting both of those in there because when you're writing copy it's good to think of both both sides because you have to give up sleeping in but you have to start waking up early right so just gives you two sides to think about it from a messaging perspective.

[45:08] And so when we're creating a product the ultimately valuable product will be a product that.

[45:12] I didn't have to do anything for that the moment I clicked purchase I knew it was going to work and it happened immediately and so think about the difference between let's say meditation right meditation is the dream outcome is to feel relaxed right perceive like an event you may.

[45:28] Time delay might take this months of meditation actually get that kind of subjective well being boost right and then the effort is sacrifice is I'm going to have to sit cross I get my legs going on I have to feel like an idiot because I'm not staying focused.

[45:39] I have to do this for 30 minutes every single day to eventually you look results which is why you know there's not a lot of huge meditation distances right flip side.

[45:49] What if I give you a pill called Sanx.

[45:53] You feel chill your perceived like blue is 100% the time delay is 15 minutes the F and sacrifice is you swallow some water and that is why you have a multi-billing off of it.

[46:03] These are just the rules of value right they don't care about who you are or what you sell.

[46:08] These values sorry these pillars to create value can apply so if you can think about your own business in the offers you have how can I increase the dream outcome I can increase the perceived like the achievement how can I decrease the time delay for my prospect and decrease what they have to do in order to be successful.

[46:22] Does that make sense? Is that cool? Is that a cool process for envisioning value you can apply that framework is once you see it you really can't unsee it.

[46:31] And that's how I think through any of the products that we're ultimately going to sell in any of the companies that we own.

[46:36] All right and so 56789s of scarcity how to build that into your offer to just urgency.

[46:41] Scare sees a function of units urgency is a function of time people usually lock them together but they are different bonuses are one of the things you're going to offer in access of your of your core offer.

[46:51] What are the guarantees we're going to offer to reverse the risk there's four you have unconditional conditional implied and anti guarantees.

[46:58] All right there's lots of stuff that I wish I could talk to you more about in terms of creating offer.

[47:02] And so what I want to do is give you guys something cool all right at acquisition.com I have this entire course outlined this book is 99 cents you don't have to opt in for it.

[47:11] So I'm not trying to build my list or anything like that I just want you guys to have this stuff so you can just win them I just want more people to win.

[47:17] All right so if you if you want a deep dive on each of these comes with checklists and swipe miles and downloads it's all free you don't have to give me anything.

[47:25] And then if you like the digital version of the kinkles 99 cents so hopefully anywhere you are in the world no matter what the economic climate is you can ground up 99 cents to get the you know to get all all the stuff right so.

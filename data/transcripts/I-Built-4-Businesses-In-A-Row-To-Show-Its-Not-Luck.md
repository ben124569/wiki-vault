## Full Transcript
[00:00] I started four businesses that cracked 10 million in a row.

[00:03] I want to share the frameworks and lessons I learned from the many mistakes that led to those

[00:06] foreigner row, so the hopefully the next business you have or the current business you're on,

[00:10] then achieve that level and beyond.

[00:11] So the first big company I built was called Jim Watch.

[00:14] It was a licensing business for Jim owners as an eye-hat of model and I was licensed that model to them.

[00:18] They would use this thing.

[00:19] They'd make more money.

[00:20] The average human bank can extra $100,000 a year in profits.

[00:23] And its peak was worth about $150 million.

[00:25] And then COVID hurt that business and I ended up selling it for $46.2 million to American

[00:31] Pacific Group, which is a private equity firm out of San Francisco.

[00:34] The first 10 customers I got from Jim Watch, I got somebody to pay a VA in the Philippines to

[00:39] scrape cross-fits database and then send me the list of emails.

[00:43] I then uploaded them to Facebook, made a look like audience off of those, marketed to get a webinar

[00:47] which no one watched.

[00:48] And then I had 80 leads for people who had opted in and none of them bought or scheduled a call.

[00:54] And so I looked up every one of the emails manually and I like friend of them on Facebook.

[00:59] I messaged them and then I got a few of them on the phone to pay me $500 bucks to go out to fly to

[01:04] their Jim and actually do the turnaround.

[01:06] Once I started the licensing version of the model, which is the one that really gave me the

[01:09] scale, I was able to sell something that had virtually 100% margins.

[01:13] The first month I think I did like 120,000 in sales and the next month I did like 300-ish

[01:17] and then high-fours and then 780 and all I was doing was just selling more units and then we

[01:22] had a million in the next month.

[01:23] We'd look at whatever problems the Jim owners that we were with were currently suffering from.

[01:26] So it could be they're suffering from churn and they could be suffering from margin issues.

[01:29] They could be suffering from, they're not getting enough leads.

[01:31] Closerates aren't as high as we want them to be.

[01:32] We would then create a hypothesis around what we thought might work.

[01:35] We would survey the community and say, who has the best conversion rates if that's what we want to

[01:39] to fix and then we'd invite 20 of them onto a call.

[01:42] We would take all the notes to figure out what things they were all doing and here's the important point.

[01:47] We didn't say, great, we're going to do all these things.

[01:49] We try to see the few things that they were all doing.

[01:51] Then we'd say, hey guys, this is big deal.

[01:53] This is like worth the cost of change.

[01:54] You're going to have a demonstrated long-term benefit to the business.

[01:57] For context, my best Jim did about $600,000 a year.

[02:00] Our average Jim, who's a Jim Lord, made 600,000 a year.

[02:04] Big picture is that the product has to be exceptional.

[02:06] If your customers are in love with your product, which takes more time.

[02:10] Because people are like, oh, you threw this thing together.

[02:11] It took six years to put all those pieces together and then finally be able to monetize that

[02:16] deliverable.

[02:17] That little inch between good and great is years.

[02:20] But the return you get on it from the word of mouth that compounds is hard to fat.

[02:24] One of the other big secrets of Jim lunch was that we had a very different approach to acquiring

[02:29] customers.

[02:30] The traditional model of most businesses in general is lost leader.

[02:35] You get someone in for some sort of free thing.

[02:36] You lose money on the acquisition.

[02:38] You make it up an LTV.

[02:39] I came with a different model and I've since done that every single business I have.

[02:41] So this is one of the important frameworks that I want to pass to you.

[02:44] It's something called Remind Findest Acquisitions.

[02:46] So client findest acquisition basically means you get the customers to finance the acquisition

[02:49] of the next customer.

[02:50] So all you have to do is have enough money to get the first sale.

[02:53] And if you make more in the first sale than the cost to acquire the customer and the cost

[02:57] to fill that customer, plus the cost to fill the next customer and the cost to acquire the

[03:01] next customer, you eliminate capital as a constraint in the business.

[03:04] You can put a dollar in and get two customers back.

[03:06] Then that next customer buys you two more and two more and two more and all my Jim's were able

[03:10] to just crush everyone else because we get out to spend.

[03:12] I've taken that aggressive acquisition perspective to every one of the businesses that

[03:15] I've had.

[03:16] Many, many terrible things that happened during the month.

[03:18] I mean, one we had COVID, which was tough, you know, four Jim owners in general, a third

[03:23] of all our clients went out of business.

[03:24] Another thing that we did that was really bad was we overheard for our support.

[03:28] I had hired an inexperienced director of customer service.

[03:31] She was a front line rep that we just promoted all the way through.

[03:33] I work at the economic but no experience.

[03:34] And so she hired 35 reps and we only needed five.

[03:37] So we had to lay off 30 people.

[03:38] And then that became a thorn on our side for the next two, three years because our last

[03:43] The biggest reason Jim went for successful one is that it was timing.

[03:46] We identified arbitrage on Facebook ads before anyone else did and we created a turn key system

[03:52] around how to monetize it.

[03:54] I was running ads on Facebook in 2013.

[03:56] You could put a girl with a bikini and say click here now.

[03:58] Like it was the wild west.

[04:00] The second thing because of that arbitrage, the average Jim was taking home an additional $30,000

[04:05] in cash in their first 30 days.

[04:07] That was the average.

[04:08] If you take a business where the average business owner is making $36,000

[04:12] in profit and then you add $30,000 in the first month of working with them.

[04:17] You don't need to worry about marketing.

[04:18] Technically my return on marketing was 101 for the first 18 months in business.

[04:22] But it's because I probably could have just not marketed it all and I would have had the amount of people that came in.

[04:26] So like who knows if the ads were doing anything.

[04:28] But everybody from the outside was like, this guy's ads are everywhere.

[04:31] Like he's killing it.

[04:32] So many people who were copycats, Mickey Mouse,

[04:34] given a cool shit.

[04:35] People who just used old versions of our stuff to try and sell out of it.

[04:38] Like all the stuff you would imagine.

[04:40] All those guys went out of business because they didn't have the depth.

[04:42] For Steve's Labs was my second big company which actually is really a sister company to Jim wants.

[04:46] You built the whole thing of an affiliate base that we acquired through Jim launch.

[04:50] And so like the first month of being fully operational did 1.7 million.

[04:53] I didn't want to sell supplements for a very long time because I was like supplements.

[04:57] You just need to eat, eat, right?

[04:58] And work out.

[04:59] This woman would have leave my office.

[05:00] She's like my friend says I need supplements.

[05:02] Like fine.

[05:03] So I wrote her list and they go get this stuff.

[05:04] Go ahead.

[05:04] She came back the next day with the things and she was like,

[05:07] I just want to make sure I got the right stuff and I saw the receipt and it's $700.

[05:10] receipt and the thing that I had sold her was $400.

[05:12] And I was like fuck that.

[05:13] I'm a sell supplements.

[05:14] So I would recruit a Jim owner and I would say hey,

[05:16] we're teaching all this marketing and sell stuff over here.

[05:18] If you just sell every person's supplements,

[05:20] it will cover the cost to acquire a customer just from the physical products.

[05:24] And the beautiful thing with selling physical products is that there's no added fulfillment.

[05:27] One of the problems is the more you sell, the more you have to deliver, right?

[05:30] And so it's kind of this double-edged store where the moment you swipe the credit card

[05:33] you're like, oh shit, now I have to deliver on this, right?

[05:35] They didn't have to do anything.

[05:36] They literally just swipe the credit card and then we

[05:38] made it centrally, we would ship a direct to the consumer.

[05:41] I wanted to create a brand only Jim owner sold.

[05:43] No one else could sell it.

[05:44] We priced it on our home site higher.

[05:46] We priced at 30% higher on the main set so there were significant savings.

[05:49] On top of that, we gave him a very good selling system because I learned a lot about selling

[05:53] supplements. I made it a recurring subscription.

[05:55] So now they got to have two recurring subscriptions per customer.

[05:57] I picked the first ten customers from our distribution base already.

[06:00] I rolled out ten locations and then the next month I rolled out 20 or 30,

[06:04] next month I rolled out another 20 or 30,

[06:05] and then we did the big launch to everyone.

[06:07] There's lots of little things that we did that were Jim specific.

[06:09] That no other supplement company could do, which is given us a nice

[06:11] note in that space.

[06:13] Cost me four million bucks to star prestige labs.

[06:15] About a million of that went to the tech.

[06:17] So we created our an entire point of sale for supplements that was specifically made for Jim.

[06:22] So every Jim would get a retail kit so they have a full wall of products.

[06:25] They would have a kiosk which is a stand with an iPad type thing on it.

[06:29] The555 didn't really exist.

[06:30] We had to build this all the time.

[06:31] And then the other three is $3 million when it's just product.

[06:34] Biggest difficulties with it in supply chain.

[06:36] So like if you run out of one ingredient on one product,

[06:38] like you can't sell a product.

[06:39] There are also legal firms that will buy all your products and try and test to find something that's

[06:45] offer on a represented or whatever.

[06:47] There's predatory law firms that as soon as you have a patent,

[06:50] they'll just try and find people to see it and they'll just like basically grab share on the amount of money.

[06:53] I think the end consumer is just not stickiness because people don't stick with fit and stuff in general for a long time.

[06:57] So the biggest lesson I have for you guys' imagination,

[06:59] Brown Prestige Labs, is that I probably shouldn't have done it.

[07:02] That's the real real.

[07:02] It is a good business, but I think that if I had allocated more time to just making gym lunch better,

[07:09] gym lunch would have been bigger.

[07:10] And because gym lunch stopped growing, the year I launched for these labs.

[07:13] I just became CEO of two companies, rather than CEO of one.

[07:15] The third business I started, use Allen.com,

[07:18] Still around a day, doing great.

[07:19] I saw where chat was going and I saw where AI and machine learning were going a few years ago.

[07:23] And I figured if I were able to aggregate all of the data from every single type of small business,

[07:29] all scheduling brick and mortar in person appointments,

[07:32] I'd be able to predictably show what days of the week, what times of day,

[07:36] what kind of follow-up sequences got the most amount of trouble shop.

[07:39] And since we were compensating on percentage of people that showed up,

[07:41] we were highly incentivized to solve that problem.

[07:43] And I learned a ton about how to get the most throughput for leads.

[07:47] And I've used that in every one of the portfolio companies that we have.

[07:49] And you can usually add 20, 30, 40 percent to the throughput on ads,

[07:53] simply your scheduling process.

[07:55] I first started it to solve the problem for gym lunch because one of the biggest constraints is that people don't work their leads.

[07:59] Amazing. I know.

[08:00] But the average gym was getting 9 percent of leads in the door when they had to work them manually.

[08:04] We were able to get just under 20 percent of leads in the door without them doing anything.

[08:09] And the average front desk person costs 2000 plus a month, and we could do it for a fraction of that.

[08:15] So the first concussion customers have Alan by going to our distribution base and saying,

[08:19] hey, what I'm trying to say was interesting is that we very quickly realized that we couldn't expand

[08:24] outside of our distribution base.

[08:25] The breakthrough was that I realized that we needed to get agencies on board rather than getting

[08:30] small businesses on board because they'd be like, great, I can work my leads.

[08:33] How do I get leads? And then we're like, oh shit, they don't know how to get leads.

[08:35] So then we started selling agencies which had another degree of leverage because

[08:39] if you saw an agency they could have 50 small business owners or anything.

[08:42] I did two webinars with people who had big agency audiences.

[08:45] So now you go up another level.

[08:46] I could make one pitch and in one pitch get a thousand customers.

[08:49] That was when this thing really took off.

[08:50] I did two pitches and within six months we were doing one point seven also.

[08:54] Ironically her month through the software company.

[08:56] Alan was the business that I probably learned the most lessons from.

[08:59] I ended up selling that business as well.

[09:01] 75% of it through strategic buyer who's still running it and doing good job with it and hopefully

[09:05] they'll have a big exit in a few years and that was an all stock deal.

[09:07] So under NDA can't tell you, but I can tell you we did 12 million in the trailing 12 months before

[09:11] this out. Depping said, lesson one is that you need to have an in-house CTO if you're going to

[09:15] get in the software.

[09:16] I developed software for prestige labs.

[09:18] I used the exact same development shop to make the software for Alan.

[09:23] I regret that.

[09:23] Development shops honestly.

[09:24] They're my close to complete scams as you can come to.

[09:26] Because if you really are going to be a software company, you need to be a software company.

[09:29] Like that's it.

[09:29] Like you need to be a software company.

[09:30] It's like having a marketing agency and having a white label and marketing agency doing

[09:34] your delivery.

[09:35] It doesn't make any sense.

[09:36] Number two is that you want to run pricing surveys early because we unlocked four times

[09:41] the pricing power by simply repackaging how we charge.

[09:43] Exploring different ways to charge based on usage, ways to work current fees, different

[09:46] APIs. This is especially true of software because there's so many different ways you can charge

[09:50] compared to maybe traditional service.

[09:51] The third thing is having a line incentives with your customers,

[09:54] often just makes you more money.

[09:56] And so that business had a tremendous month scale because we had so much alignment with

[10:00] every single stakeholder.

[10:01] The small business owner want people to show up.

[10:03] The agency owner want people to show up.

[10:04] We got paid based on shop.

[10:06] So everybody was a line top down.

[10:07] The fourth thing through put on appointments when you're scheduling for sales calls or

[10:13] in-person appointments.

[10:14] The amount of days per week that you're open,

[10:16] the hours that you are open,

[10:18] and the increments of time,

[10:20] matter a lot.

[10:21] Like 50 to 200 percent would be like marketing is a work for me.

[10:25] And they had one time slot for an hour per week that they were willing to take your customers.

[10:28] That's just stupid.

[10:30] There's no other way to say it.

[10:31] The people who made the most money who had the most throughput of the ones who gave the most

[10:33] availability, gave the most flexibility, their customers were open the most days.

[10:37] And they unsurprisingly got more people to show up.

[10:39] There's a reason small business owner stay small.

[10:41] They make small business owners decision.

[10:43] So acquisition.com.

[10:44] So this is the fourth business.

[10:45] This is portfolio companies that right now.

[10:46] There's over $200 million a year.

[10:48] And I make these videos so that you can hopefully pass $3 million,

[10:50] $10 million, et cetera.

[10:51] And then we can invest your business in health and growth.

[10:53] I started with the question, what can I do forever?

[10:55] And then the work backwards from there.

[10:56] So it's like there has to have a lot of leverage.

[10:58] I need to have a capital compounding vehicle.

[10:59] So the first 10 investments that we found,

[11:01] some people I knew from beforehand,

[11:03] and I would say that the relationship had shifted more and more to,

[11:06] like basically an advisory role anyways.

[11:08] And the rest of it has been people who read the book,

[11:10] who watch videos, who listen to podcasts,

[11:11] who come in, you already are aligned with our values.

[11:13] We'll always look at anything as three or more,

[11:15] but most of the businesses are above the average business

[11:17] right now is doing 17 million.

[11:19] So Aquaculture's not common is the first business

[11:21] that was really built on a personal brand in bound with content.

[11:24] So that's been the biggest change compared to the other businesses.

[11:26] There's pros and cons to it.

[11:28] Like it's a slower business overall.

[11:29] If you are used to doing a transactional business,

[11:32] where you're doing multiple sales a day,

[11:33] going to a business model where you have one every month,

[11:37] is very different.

[11:38] And there's a lot of conversations that happen.

[11:39] They don't amount to anything.

[11:40] The thing that excites me most about Aquaculture's not common is

[11:43] I learn more now than I ever have,

[11:45] because I'm exposed to more businesses at a higher level.

[11:47] I believe that the purpose of life is to learn.

[11:49] That is my purpose of life.

[11:50] Then enabling myself to learn in as many ways as

[11:53] it's evenly possible, maximize that.

[11:54] So we co-own all these businesses,

[11:56] because I want to learn how solar sales work.

[11:58] I want to learn how more New Sales work.

[12:00] Like knowing a lot about a lot of things allows you to cross-pollinate

[12:04] ideas that work well in one industry,

[12:06] and then apply them to another one and then get outsized returns.

[12:09] As we saw how quickly and how easily Aquaculture's not

[12:12] come grew, the biggest part of that was because we

[12:14] hired from the top down.

[12:15] There was so much that we could automatically

[12:17] delegate to be more of the better of then us at their respective

[12:20] things.

[12:20] The director of sales, director of marketing,

[12:22] director of people, director of IT, director of fully

[12:25] operations.

[12:26] I as good as, but better than us who are teaching us.

[12:28] Every other business I've had, I hired from the bottom up.

[12:30] This one I went from top down, and I will always do that from here

[12:33] and out.

[12:34] You can really only do that if you're well-capitalized.

[12:36] That's why venture people raise money,

[12:38] because you can get more talent before the business can really

[12:41] afford the talent.

[12:42] Because at the end of the day, every business occurs

[12:43] that it's just what kind of debt.

[12:45] So are you incurring financial debt?

[12:46] Are you incurring management debt?

[12:47] Cultural debt?

[12:48] Technical debt?

[12:49] And the question is which one do you want to pick and

[12:50] have to pay down later?

[12:51] And so for us, being the bank was willing to pay down

[12:54] financial debt to not have to pay any of the other debt down in the future

[12:57] because ultimately on a longer time horizon, we move fast.

[12:59] And the other thing is that we have made recruiting talent,

[13:02] the single core competency of the business.

[13:04] Most of the companies that were bringing on,

[13:05] the entrepreneur needs more talent.

[13:07] And we have the ability to recruit talent

[13:10] better than most people because one, we have so much inbound

[13:12] that comes in too.

[13:13] We, as a private equity firm, have more prestige than most of the companies

[13:17] that are in our portfolio.

[13:19] And so we can recruit a people who are respond to a private equity firm,

[13:22] who is more focused on companies more than they respond to,

[13:24] Joe Strichling.

[13:25] And then we have some of the at-holdcoat

[13:27] who will help train them on our way of doing business

[13:29] so they get it right the first time.

[13:31] A portfolio company, when their managers are getting stocked

[13:33] or their directors are getting stocked, they talk to our director of sales.

[13:36] And if you're a business owner,

[13:37] and you'd like to scale to 50, 100 and beyond,

[13:40] we'd love to partner with you on it.

[13:42] If we have the track record that we have,

[13:44] we could be done at multiple times,

[13:45] and the biggest cost that you have in the business is what you do not know.

[13:48] And so if we can help you pay down ignorance debt

[13:50] and we can drag what you might already do in 10 years and 3 years,

[13:53] then for us that's a win for our group.

[13:55] So if that's interesting, you can always go to Acquisites.com.

[13:58] Go there, apply through the site,

[13:59] and look forward to hopefully working with one of you guys.

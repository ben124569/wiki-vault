[00:00] Two out of three businesses fail.

[00:02] And so that means within 10 years,

[00:04] if we were to look back at these business owners,

[00:06] two out of three are out of the game.

[00:09] Every business that I've started since 2016

[00:11] still continues to make money to this day.

[00:13] So here's how to make your business unstoppable.

[00:15] There's three steps.

[00:16] It starts with stop selling small customers.

[00:19] Your business may fail, not because you are a failure,

[00:23] but maybe because the customers you serve are failures.

[00:25] Let me tell you a story to explain this.

[00:28] So there is a small gym CRM back in the day

[00:31] that approached me about investing.

[00:33] I asked them what their turn was.

[00:34] So what percentage of customers were leaving between last month

[00:37] and this month?

[00:37] And their answer surprised me.

[00:39] It was a much higher percentage than I expected

[00:41] because I thought a CRM they're processing.

[00:43] Their payments through here, they've all their members.

[00:44] And they're like, this should be a very sticky product.

[00:46] And I said, so where is the turn coming from?

[00:48] And they said, oh, well, about a third of the gyms

[00:51] got a business every year.

[00:52] And I was like, wow, wait a second.

[00:54] So this has nothing to do with how good your product

[00:57] to service was.

[00:58] These businesses in and of themselves

[01:00] just stopped being in business.

[01:02] The formal language for that is called structural turn.

[01:05] It means it's like, it's baked into the structure

[01:08] of the market that you serve.

[01:10] Now the question is, is that your choice to pursue that market

[01:13] in the answer is yes.

[01:14] A lot of business owners struggle in the business

[01:16] and they look at everything except for the most important thing

[01:19] which is they messed up the pick.

[01:21] Chick-fil-A's had a people who gives a great example of this

[01:23] when they talk about actually talent selection,

[01:25] but I think the parallel holds.

[01:27] They said, most people lose in the NBA in the championships

[01:32] and wonder what they did wrong in the game

[01:34] when in reality they lost in the draft

[01:36] as they didn't have the right people in the team.

[01:38] And so if you think about your business as an ecosystem,

[01:40] the right people in the team has to be all the stakeholders

[01:42] including the customers.

[01:44] And so if you're thinking about your own business,

[01:47] there are many business models that simply aren't fit

[01:50] for smaller customers.

[01:52] And so I'll give you a different example.

[01:53] In the agency world where you do some sort of advertising

[01:56] for any type of business,

[01:57] if you look at some of the biggest ad agencies in the world,

[02:00] you'll notice a common theme.

[02:01] They all serve the biggest customers in the world.

[02:03] Whereas if it were true that agencies would be best served

[02:07] serving small customers,

[02:09] then some of the biggest agencies would serve

[02:11] some of the smallest customers.

[02:12] But that's not reality.

[02:14] In looking at this, it means that just like the CRM business

[02:17] and that's arguably one of the stickiest businesses

[02:20] you could possibly imagine,

[02:21] the agencies could not keep turn down

[02:26] with small business owners

[02:28] because small business owners in and of themselves

[02:31] are volatile.

[02:32] Let me give you a visual.

[02:32] So let's imagine this is kind of representing

[02:35] the EBSAN flows of the revenue of a small business.

[02:38] Now let's say that aside to work with you here,

[02:41] they say, you know what?

[02:42] We're gonna sign up with you and you get paid.

[02:45] Now maybe you start advertising the business

[02:47] and then the next month they make a little bit more money.

[02:48] Hurray, everyone's happy.

[02:50] Now the next month, the normal volatility occurs

[02:53] or maybe because you sent them more customers

[02:55] than they could handle.

[02:56] They say, hey, maybe we need to ease off a little bit.

[02:57] And all of a sudden, they think to themselves

[02:59] wait a second.

[03:00] I'm back in the same position I was before.

[03:02] But now I've got still more customers than I had before that.

[03:05] And now you know what?

[03:07] I'm actually making less money the next month.

[03:09] And so what happens here?

[03:11] They become one of these for you.

[03:16] They cancel, right?

[03:17] This is the point of cancellation.

[03:19] And so what happens is that there's many businesses

[03:21] like small agencies that do lead generation

[03:23] for small customers

[03:25] and continue to wonder, what do I need to do

[03:27] in order to make my business sticky?

[03:30] And they kill themselves trying to figure it out

[03:32] when the problem is inherent to who they serve.

[03:35] Is that they are volatile

[03:36] and as a result, your business will be volatile too.

[03:39] It reflects onto you.

[03:41] Now to give you an absolute hypothetical extreme here,

[03:43] to give an example, Shopify is what most would consider

[03:48] world-class or best in class for customer retention.

[03:51] But they serve by and large, pro-sumers,

[03:55] meaning consumers who want to start a business

[03:57] and let me give you a stat that might blow you away.

[04:00] 60% of their customer's day of year,

[04:04] but 40% leave.

[04:05] And that's the best in the world.

[04:09] And so in thinking about this,

[04:11] you'll typically need to have a business

[04:13] that has almost a zero cost of servicing

[04:16] the smallest business owners

[04:18] if that's the game you want to play.

[04:20] If you want to be Walmart,

[04:22] then you have to orient your entire strategy

[04:24] on basically a zero cost basis for providing value,

[04:28] which works in software companies,

[04:30] or like Walmart where the entire model is structured

[04:34] such that it creates the smallest cost to them.

[04:37] So their alternative is really not having it at all.

[04:40] Right?

[04:41] Now, there was one agency that did really well with this,

[04:44] mutual acquaintance of mine.

[04:45] What he did was that he basically provided marketing services

[04:50] but for about $299 per month.

[04:53] Now, what he realized was this wallet,

[04:56] and this was the guy who used to charge a lot more than that,

[04:58] what he realized is that with this volatility,

[05:01] he had to price to their worst month.

[05:04] And so it's like, okay, what's the lowest part

[05:07] of this volatile range, this wave of revenue

[05:10] that these small businesses are going to encounter?

[05:12] Okay, well then I'll just put my price here.

[05:14] In that way, I'm so cheap that they'll never cancel.

[05:18] And the cost of them doing the services that he rendered,

[05:21] which was actually far less than the guys who are charging

[05:24] call $1,500 a month, which is probably like the industry

[05:27] standard for small business or local business lead gen.

[05:30] All of a sudden, he's won fifth the price.

[05:33] But he just provided still more value than the $300,

[05:37] and so it still felt like a good deal here.

[05:39] Because all you would do is you'd optimize their Google stuff,

[05:42] get them a few leads a few phone calls a month,

[05:44] and for them they're like, okay,

[05:45] if I get a couple of customers, it's worth it.

[05:47] This, it's so expensive relative to what they made,

[05:50] that if you weren't saving the day, every single month,

[05:53] the question they'll always ask is what have you done for me lately.

[05:55] This is one of the big misconceptions

[05:57] that business owners have.

[05:58] And I've made this myself, which is you see this, right?

[06:01] You see this delta that you create your, like look,

[06:03] you went from $1 a $2 sign to $2 signs.

[06:05] All of this extra money was because of me, right?

[06:08] But the thing is is that if you make someone $10,000,

[06:11] right, in the first month you work with them,

[06:13] and let's say you charge them a thousand.

[06:14] In your mind you say, oh, well, this nine K is because of me,

[06:19] which means I just bought another nine months of service with you,

[06:22] right, because I've made you $9,000,

[06:24] I charge $1,000 a month,

[06:25] so I could basically just break even for the next nine months.

[06:27] But try actually having that conversation in reality.

[06:30] It doesn't work that way.

[06:31] What happens in reality is this.

[06:33] They pay $1,000.

[06:35] They make $10, they make the extra nine,

[06:38] and they say, oh, that $1,000 was worth it this month.

[06:41] And guess what happens next month?

[06:43] You start at zero.

[06:44] Actually, you start at negative $1,000,

[06:46] because they've already paid you $1,000,

[06:48] and they haven't made any money yet.

[06:50] And so again, it's always going to be relative

[06:52] to when they pay and what they get relative to that.

[06:55] And so this is where this volatility ends

[06:58] at becoming a trap for most business owners.

[07:00] And when you're starting a business,

[07:01] or even when you're in a few years in the business,

[07:03] you'll often sell the people that you relate to.

[07:06] And so you'll sell out of your own wallet

[07:07] to solve your own problems.

[07:09] But the problem there is that those people

[07:13] will never become reliable.

[07:14] It's like building your business on a foundation of sand.

[07:18] It doesn't matter how beautiful of a castle

[07:20] you can imagine in your mind.

[07:21] One bad storm on a foundation of sand

[07:24] and it's going to topple over.

[07:25] And so you end up just getting in this endless cycle

[07:27] of trying to iterate your products,

[07:28] create different offers, all the stuff,

[07:30] but the fundamental issues,

[07:31] you're serving somebody who's never going to stay in pay,

[07:35] because of them, not you.

[07:36] So for example, if you have a supplement business,

[07:39] it's unlikely that you're going to get very high stick

[07:41] if you're super expensive.

[07:43] And your product suite is only geared towards beginners

[07:48] and beginners turn out.

[07:49] As in they go to the gym, they stop going to the gym,

[07:51] they go to the gym, they stop going to gym.

[07:52] Now if you had a business that was geared around

[07:54] the regular user or somebody who already

[07:56] let's say takes protein every day,

[07:58] and you truly have a superior product,

[08:00] and then that entire base of people

[08:02] who takes protein shakes every day

[08:03] is willing to take your ors and stuff.

[08:04] So when else is, then you have a customer

[08:06] that is already a qualified customer

[08:07] who's going to continue to take the product

[08:08] over and over again.

[08:09] But when you target beginners, whether it's B2C or B2B,

[08:12] obviously the price differences

[08:14] are significant between businesses and consumers,

[08:16] but they are still beginners within that continuum.

[08:20] And so you will have the turn in relation

[08:22] to how much of a beginner they are.

[08:24] And so my preferred way to think about this

[08:26] is if you think about this pyramid

[08:28] as representation of the marketplace,

[08:29] based on their spending power,

[08:31] right?

[08:31] At the base you're always going to have the most people

[08:33] that have the least amount of money to spend.

[08:35] And so whether it's B2B or B2C, like B2C,

[08:37] it's going to be base beginners for whatever it is that you sell.

[08:40] If it's B2B, it's going to be the smallest business owners.

[08:42] So it could be consumers becoming consumers,

[08:45] or consumers becoming BSNBs, which is a very small business,

[08:48] and then BSNBs becoming SMBs, which is small business owners.

[08:50] And then you have limit market,

[08:52] mid market, and then you all do equal to up to,

[08:53] you know, Fortune 100 companies, right?

[08:55] My preferred way to structure a business model

[08:57] is to actually start at the top.

[08:59] And the reason for this is that

[09:00] because there's little operational drag,

[09:02] because you have fewer customers you need to take care of,

[09:04] they're able to spend significantly more.

[09:06] They are going to be around a while,

[09:08] and they know their numbers, and they can stick with their commitment.

[09:10] So if you have a contract, for example,

[09:12] and they say they'll pay you million dollars a year,

[09:13] they'll likely they pay you significantly higher,

[09:15] then it beginner saying he's going to pay you $10,000 over 10 months.

[09:18] Very unlikely.

[09:19] I would make that bet so much so that corporate debt

[09:22] is an entire investible asset class based on the promises

[09:24] that business make to repay things.

[09:26] The cool part about this from a branding perspective

[09:28] is that you learn how to service these much higher in customers.

[09:30] And with that reputation, then there are customers

[09:33] who are going to be underneath,

[09:35] who are then going to say, you know what?

[09:36] I would love to be able to work with somebody who works with the Fortune 100.

[09:39] I can't afford that.

[09:40] You say, you know what?

[09:41] I can make it a little bit more affordable for you,

[09:43] but you're going to get a little less service for them.

[09:45] And you can work your way down.

[09:46] Now, here's where it gets really clever.

[09:48] Is that as you work your way down,

[09:50] you're consistently making more money.

[09:51] And at this point, when you go further and further down this rabbit hole,

[09:56] you're going to be able to spend the money,

[09:58] it takes to create the automated solution,

[10:01] or the software-based or technological-based solution.

[10:05] That's going to have a near-zero cost basis for you as a business owner,

[10:09] so that you can profitably serve this 80-pitty, these 80-pitty.

[10:14] Dollar signs here, without the headache associated with beginners.

[10:17] Fundamentally, if you sell to beginners,

[10:19] you're going to have to either sell a really big ticket one time

[10:22] that's based on an emotional purchase.

[10:24] And you're doing what I would consider a smashing grab business.

[10:26] Solar, for example, is kind of what I would consider

[10:28] a smashing grab business.

[10:30] People go in, they sell the cell solar,

[10:33] and then it's on the roof, and then that's kind of it.

[10:35] And so it's really just massively just trying to sell

[10:37] a single person that exists, and that's all there is to it.

[10:40] Or you have to create something that the price-to-vide-descrabment

[10:43] see is so absurd, because what's crazy about this

[10:46] is that the price-to-value for poor people actually

[10:48] has to be higher than it is for the people at the top.

[10:52] Because here's the part that people miss.

[10:54] Think about this.

[10:55] There are people who cancel the $12 per month, Netflix charge.

[10:59] Like, what else could Netflix offer?

[11:01] They give you every movie you can imagine, every new shows.

[11:05] They do everything, and still, so people are like,

[11:06] you know, I'm not really sure if it's worth it for me.

[11:09] And so if you take that as type of digital trim,

[11:11] you can take the same thing for Spotify.

[11:13] How about I give you every song that is possible

[11:16] in the universe, you give access to it,

[11:17] whenever you want on your phone, in your pocket.

[11:20] Ah, a box is a lot.

[11:22] A box is a lot for that, right?

[11:24] I don't know Mr. Spotify.

[11:26] And so the thing is, I know many of you

[11:29] have these businesses and are wondering,

[11:30] looking at yourself and you're like, what more can I offer?

[11:32] It's not about you.

[11:33] You have the wrong model serving the wrong customer.

[11:35] And so you have to have a cost basis as low as possible

[11:38] with a crazy high price-to-value discrepancy.

[11:41] So values up here, prices down here, this huge delta,

[11:45] so that even on their bad months, they're like,

[11:48] you know what, even though I lost my job, structural turn,

[11:52] I'm still willing to pay the $12 for Netflix.

[11:54] And so I talk about this at length in the $100,000 offer's book.

[11:59] And I have this really good visual that I want to show you.

[12:01] This is how crazy it is.

[12:02] The thing you sell doesn't even need to materially change

[12:06] in order to make it ready and available

[12:08] for the highest end customers.

[12:09] All right?

[12:10] So let's say that you sell time management, all right?

[12:13] And you sell to all these people.

[12:14] Well, you're going to have to have a probably a $19 price point.

[12:18] See, very mass market, 19 bucks, maybe.

[12:21] The next level is like, okay, well,

[12:23] I want to do time management for sales professionals.

[12:25] Well, for sales people, maybe you'd be able to charge $99.

[12:28] Okay?

[12:28] More, because sales people are like, all right, well,

[12:30] one sale might pay for this.

[12:32] Now, what if you then go up to time management

[12:35] for outbound B2B sales?

[12:37] So this isn't just people selling memberships or car washes

[12:39] or cleaning services.

[12:40] This is now people selling, let's say, enterprise software.

[12:43] Where they're making $2,000 a sale in commissions or whatever.

[12:47] So for them to pay $500, basically it's a quarter of one sale.

[12:50] So they're willing to do that.

[12:52] Now, let's go all the way up.

[12:54] Now, we've got time management for outbound B2B power tools

[12:56] and gardening sales reps.

[12:57] So super specific and high ticket.

[12:59] You get super niche down and you could sell for $2,000.

[13:03] But fundamentally, time management is time management.

[13:05] And so the likelihood that the product that you're selling

[13:07] is really materially different

[13:09] between these, these different avatars is unlikely.

[13:13] But we're choosing to purposefully narrow down

[13:17] who we sell to so that we can make more money

[13:20] and have less operational drag and have less structural turn

[13:25] as in people canceling for reasons outside of what we've delivered.

[13:28] And as a result, have a much more stable business

[13:32] that can compound year over year.

[13:33] Either way, I do have an entire extra chapter on this

[13:36] that I wrote between my offers book and my leads book

[13:38] called Your First Avatar.

[13:40] And it was kind of like a single that I produced

[13:42] between the books.

[13:43] I think you can get it for free at acquisition.com

[13:45] for slash avatar.

[13:46] I think that's what it is.

[13:47] And if not, you probably could go ahead and you probably find it.

[13:49] But it's free, just pop in your email,

[13:50] we'll tell you what, and we'll send it over to you.

[13:52] So step two is to ask, not tell your customers.

[13:56] Now, what do I mean by ask?

[13:58] So I'll tell you a quick story.

[14:00] So Paul Graham said this and I remember hearing it

[14:02] and it just like got cinched into my brain.

[14:04] He said, you can solve every business problem

[14:09] by simply talking to your customers.

[14:12] And I thought that was such an elegant answer

[14:14] and also true.

[14:15] It's easy to make a pitty response.

[14:17] It's hard to make it useful and valuable all the time.

[14:20] And this is one of those rants, it's just where it's both.

[14:23] And so I'll tell you a story.

[14:24] So when I had Allen, which was our software company,

[14:27] which is the third company that started after 2016,

[14:29] I originally made in my mind two serve gym owners.

[14:33] Once we spent a million plus dollars

[14:35] on developing this thing and actually rolled it out to gym owners,

[14:39] we had this big obvious problem that came up,

[14:42] which is they said, oh, this is so great.

[14:44] This will work on my leads.

[14:45] By the way, can you help me get more leads?

[14:48] And I was like, oh, no, we completely missed the mark.

[14:51] And so what ended up happening is that in my mind,

[14:53] I could see that they had this problem

[14:54] that they weren't working their leads.

[14:56] But what I didn't realize is that there was only

[14:57] a very specific amount of customers that had that problem.

[15:00] And so then I had to think, oh gosh, okay,

[15:02] so I have two possible scenarios.

[15:04] I can either only go after gym owners

[15:05] who already know how to generate leads consistently,

[15:08] which we're talking like a tiny, tiny, tiny marketplace

[15:12] and here's the caveat, that marketplace still can't pay that much.

[15:15] So bad market to go after.

[15:17] Small and has not a lot of money and shrinking.

[15:19] Yee, right?

[15:21] Not a good market.

[15:21] So I thought to myself, okay, well, what businesses

[15:25] always have lead gym?

[15:27] Well, the solution came to me when an agency owner

[15:31] actually reached out to me and said, hey, could I use this

[15:34] for my business to work the leads that I'm generating

[15:37] for my small business owner customers?

[15:38] And I was like, oh wait a second, small business owners

[15:41] will turn in and out of the agency services,

[15:43] but the agency will stay because they will bring new customers

[15:46] in, use our software, and even if they turn out with them,

[15:50] the agency will stay with me.

[15:52] And so the agencies had much more reliable revenue

[15:54] than their base customers did,

[15:56] because they could reliably sell 10 new customers a month

[16:00] to offset the 10 customers they lose.

[16:02] Or whatever, and so many of them were still stable businesses

[16:04] even though they had lots of churn,

[16:05] which the fact that they couldn't necessarily

[16:08] have the skill set to grow their business

[16:09] wasn't necessarily a problem for me.

[16:12] So to the same degree with the CRM,

[16:14] there are some CRMs that are very successful,

[16:16] even that serve small business owners,

[16:18] but they have to match the pricing

[16:19] to the spending power of that small business.

[16:22] And Shopify, for example,

[16:24] probably makes more than almost any e-commerce company

[16:27] on the platform.

[16:28] We have to fact check it, but it's probably pretty close.

[16:30] And so the platform itself actually makes more

[16:32] than the opportunity seekers in enables.

[16:34] So this is definitely one of the situations

[16:36] of selling the shovels rather than painting for gold.

[16:39] And so once I realized that Jim owners were not the customer

[16:43] and agencies were the customer,

[16:45] I was able to start asking agencies

[16:47] for the correct feedback,

[16:48] and that is when we were able to continue

[16:50] to iterate the product in a way

[16:51] that actually served the right customer.

[16:53] So fundamentally, when it comes to product

[16:57] or service base businesses,

[16:59] there's, I would say, two schools of thought

[17:02] around product iteration.

[17:04] One is kind of the rank and build

[17:09] model, which is basically,

[17:12] you ask your customer's to just vote,

[17:14] up vote and down vote,

[17:15] the potential things that all of them have asked for.

[17:18] And then the one that gets to the top that month,

[17:20] you then say, this is the one that we're gonna build,

[17:22] and then you do the build cycle,

[17:24] and then you ask it again.

[17:25] And this is not a bad way to do it.

[17:27] It's a different way to do it,

[17:28] and what ends up happening when you have a business like this

[17:30] is that you keep building more and more things.

[17:32] And so this can result in kind of these Frankenstein type businesses.

[17:36] But some customers are okay and want to have all the features.

[17:41] And so this is kind of like a PC versus Mac,

[17:46] kind of product strategy difference.

[17:48] So the PC is like, you have all the customization,

[17:50] all the different add-ons, all the features

[17:52] that has all these different ways you can use it,

[17:55] but can sometimes be more arduous

[17:57] in terms of UX or user experience, user design,

[18:00] than a Mac.

[18:01] Now if you're like, how does this apply for a service business?

[18:03] It's literally the same.

[18:04] It's just that the features that you're building

[18:06] are going to be around the services that you provide,

[18:08] rather than the actual physical product or software that you're building.

[18:10] But it works the same way.

[18:11] The Mac style of this is trying to take every single thing

[18:15] that people want, right up and down, up and down.

[18:18] And then trying to go from the ultimate experience at the end,

[18:23] and then reverse engineer it into a elegant solution

[18:28] that purposely removes some things

[18:30] because it interferes with the other experiences.

[18:34] And so when you do the kind of rank-in-build model,

[18:36] there's lots of kind of conflicting contingencies,

[18:39] like different customers want different things.

[18:40] And some of the things you built for one customer

[18:42] might actually impact negatively another customer.

[18:44] And so when you do that, all of a sudden, you can lose.

[18:48] Now here, the downside is you're not going to be able to serve

[18:51] all the needs of every customer

[18:53] because some of those specific,

[18:54] if you're really specific about stuff,

[18:56] then you might want to have one of these solutions.

[18:58] And so basically the customer base that buys Mac stuff

[19:01] is unsurprisingly different than the customer base

[19:03] that buys PC stuff.

[19:04] And so for example, at school, our product strategy

[19:08] is much more based on this, which is how do we create

[19:10] the most elegant, simplest solution

[19:13] so that we can help people who are starting out,

[19:16] build a business online.

[19:17] And so if we have all of this customization

[19:19] and things like that, you might serve somebody who's like,

[19:22] I want a white label, I want to whatever, right?

[19:24] Now to be clear, these businesses can obviously

[19:27] still get wildly big and successful.

[19:29] Apple is a $3.8 trillion company,

[19:33] Amazon, which also kind of follows this model,

[19:35] is a, you know, also a trillion dollar plus business.

[19:38] And so they are different strategies

[19:40] that you need to decide which one you want to pursue,

[19:43] but both of them work.

[19:44] You just can't do both.

[19:46] So there's two questions that I fundamentally like to ask

[19:48] when I'm trying to go through this product iteration cycle.

[19:51] So the first one is, if there is only one thing

[19:54] that was left after I deleted every other component

[19:57] of my service or product, what one thing would you want me to keep?

[20:01] The second version of that question is the equal opposite.

[20:04] If I kept everything except for one thing,

[20:07] what thing would you not care at all about?

[20:09] And then you delete that thing.

[20:11] And you see who complains.

[20:14] And to be clear, you don't announce that you deleted.

[20:16] You just delete it and then see what happens.

[20:17] And then if you get complaints,

[20:18] you ask yourself the question,

[20:20] are these the types of customers that I want to keep?

[20:22] Because sometimes the people who complain

[20:23] are the ones that you don't want, in which case,

[20:25] win, win, win.

[20:26] For more info on this, I cover this,

[20:28] I'd lengthen the referral section of $100 million leads.

[20:31] And so in the referral section, I talk about,

[20:33] how do you get more people better results?

[20:34] So this is fundamentally product iteration.

[20:36] And so the idea here is how do we increase

[20:38] the perceived likelihood of achievement?

[20:39] The process that I like to follow here,

[20:41] so I have our action steps.

[20:42] So you survey customers to find the ones

[20:45] who get the best results.

[20:46] Step one.

[20:46] Step two is you interview them to find out

[20:48] what they did differently.

[20:50] All right, so this is a behavior thing.

[20:51] So we're on one level, you want to look at demographics.

[20:54] Do they look different?

[20:55] The second is, do they have a different user path

[20:57] that they come in in a different way?

[20:58] Do they have a different promise?

[20:59] Number three, and this is the one that we're referencing here,

[21:01] is did they take actions that not everyone

[21:03] necessarily took?

[21:04] We look at those actions that only those people

[21:06] had in common.

[21:07] And then what we do is we take those actions,

[21:09] and we force new customers to repeat those actions

[21:11] on purpose that the best customers did by accident.

[21:14] And then we measure the improvement of the average customer

[21:17] based on those new behaviors that we're incentivizing

[21:20] towards, or at least pushing them towards.

[21:22] And then what we do, if you want to get really fancy with it,

[21:25] is you can match the conditions of your guarantee

[21:27] to the actions that get the best results

[21:28] to get more people to do them.

[21:29] Said differently, if you realize that the best customers,

[21:33] for example, import all of their contacts

[21:35] into your CRM when you're starting the CRM,

[21:37] you would then try and create the onboarding experience,

[21:40] and a guarantee says, hey, we will guarantee

[21:42] that you'll have some improvement using our software service

[21:45] product, as long as you export an import

[21:49] all of your contacts into our CRM within the first 30 days.

[21:52] And so now we have shown our hand to say,

[21:55] this is very valuable to us, and it will be valuable to you.

[21:58] This ask process can fix any department.

[22:02] That's customer-facing, obviously, can't fix IT.

[22:05] But it can fix marketing.

[22:06] So if all of us in your ads are doing well,

[22:08] show your ads the customers and ask them what's missing,

[22:12] or what's not working, why would they not respond to this?

[22:14] What ads did you find that resonated the most with you?

[22:17] Because I want more people like you.

[22:19] Product, you're saying, okay, what's wrong with this picture?

[22:22] What show me what's difficult?

[22:23] Watch users actually interface with your product

[22:26] or services so that you can understand the friction points

[22:29] before, during and after.

[22:30] And so I like to use the three term contingency

[22:32] before, during after, to think through any kind of change

[22:35] that I have for our customer.

[22:37] What's gonna happen immediately before they buy my product?

[22:39] What's gonna happen immediately before they use my product?

[22:41] What's gonna happen during the time that they use the product?

[22:43] Like, what are the interactions they have?

[22:44] And then what happens immediately after?

[22:46] And those are the places that we have,

[22:47] that the closest and strongest leverage

[22:49] over the ultimate customer results

[22:51] and the value that we provide.

[22:52] And the same thing with sales,

[22:53] like if people are getting on the sales calls

[22:54] and they're not buying,

[22:55] then you ask customers, what about my offer,

[22:57] what about the way that we're presenting it,

[22:58] is not compelling to you.

[23:00] And just as valuable, sometimes more, if you can get them,

[23:02] is interviewing the people who said no and say, why not?

[23:05] One of the best things you could do is just pay them.

[23:06] Like I'll pay $100 to output a phone call with me

[23:08] and just tell me what we could have done better.

[23:10] Anyhow, it's crazy, is that a lot of times,

[23:11] you just even doing that,

[23:13] does give you second shot at the set,

[23:14] which is by no means the objective.

[23:17] You just wanna get the information

[23:18] because that information is so much more valuable

[23:20] than the $100 and maybe the hour that you'd give.

[23:22] So number one, once we've picked the right customers

[23:26] who aren't going to have structural turn,

[23:28] based on the business model that we have.

[23:29] Two, we have the thing that that type of customer wants,

[23:33] what we need to keep improving that product

[23:35] so we don't get out-competed in the marketplace

[23:37] by new entrants, our new businesses who are trying to

[23:39] take our slice of the pie.

[23:40] The third thing that we have to do

[23:42] to make your business unsoppable

[23:44] is don't pretend to be something you're not.

[23:46] And you're like, what does that even mean?

[23:48] So let me tell you this quote that I love

[23:49] and then I'll get into the story.

[23:50] This is by Shane Parrish.

[23:51] Success comes down to doing the obvious thing

[23:53] for an extraordinary period of time

[23:55] without convincing yourself that you're smart

[23:57] and then you actually are.

[23:57] And I love this quote for a number of reasons.

[23:59] First off, because it's so true,

[24:01] here's my easiest visual for you.

[24:03] Actually, I must see if I can get the right

[24:04] right colors for the markers.

[24:06] So this is gonna be a tough one.

[24:07] Let's see if I can draw this.

[24:09] I've never drawn this before.

[24:10] So forgive me if this sucks.

[24:21] Oops, fuck that up.

[24:27] Looks like a dog with a curly cue.

[24:29] So this is a pig.

[24:32] Not a dog.

[24:33] And so,

[24:36] and so here's the saying that I love about this.

[24:38] Oh, it's because I put a dog news on it.

[24:40] I should have put a little, little front snap.

[24:43] Okay, well whatever, you get the idea.

[24:45] So if you put lipstick on a pig,

[24:50] it's still a pig.

[24:52] And so if you put a little bit,

[24:54] you sprinkle a little bit of software

[24:55] into your service business.

[24:57] It's still a service business.

[24:58] Right, and so if like 90% of your revenue

[25:00] comes from service and here's the tricky part.

[25:02] If 90% of the value comes from the service,

[25:04] they will still determine that it's a service based business.

[25:07] And arguably the likelihood that you will get the economics

[25:12] that a software company has with the service business as low.

[25:16] Let me tell you a story that illustrate the point.

[25:18] So there was a solar company that I was talking to

[25:20] that a 400 sales guy.

[25:21] So a big solar company that did very well.

[25:24] And the founders were young,

[25:26] enterprise and guys, super ambitious.

[25:28] They came to me and said, hey,

[25:29] we want to have a monstrous valuation for my company.

[25:32] And I said, I think you're doing have a monstrous valuation

[25:34] for a company.

[25:35] They said, well, we know that software companies

[25:37] get valued significantly higher than kind of the transactional

[25:40] sales nature of solar.

[25:42] And I said, you're right.

[25:43] And so what?

[25:45] And so they were like, well, we have this software

[25:47] that we have that we use to recruit sales people

[25:50] and make them more productive.

[25:51] And that's why we have such a big and productive sales team.

[25:54] And so we're thinking about was taking that software

[25:56] and then licensing it to other solar companies.

[26:00] And I told them that I thought that was a terrible idea.

[26:03] Now, why would I say something like that?

[26:04] Well, in theory, if you had a software company

[26:07] that had the same revenue metrics as your solar sales

[26:11] company, then you would have a significantly more valuable

[26:13] company.

[26:14] But number one is for you to get those same economics,

[26:17] you're not selling $30,000 things.

[26:19] The likelihood that you'd be able to get even closely

[26:21] amount of revenue per customer would be significantly lower.

[26:23] Number two is the amount of people that can buy

[26:25] solar roofs versus the amount of solar companies

[26:27] is way smaller.

[26:28] Third, neither of these founders were software people.

[26:32] And so what they wanted to do is kind of like pretend

[26:34] to be software and just say, oh, we'll just sell some people

[26:37] into this thing.

[26:37] And then we're going to get a software multiple

[26:39] in the entirety of our revenue.

[26:40] That's not how it works.

[26:41] You have to remember that the person who's writing a $100, $200, $500,

[26:45] billion check is smart enough to have a $100, $200, or a billion

[26:50] dollars to spend.

[26:51] They know the difference between a solar company

[26:53] and a software company, software companies,

[26:56] and companies that get extraordinarily high multiples.

[26:58] Don't get high multiples because of the name or the label

[27:02] that's associated with them.

[27:03] They get those extraordinarily high multiples

[27:05] because of the nature of the revenue and the quality of the revenue

[27:09] that they have and the potential for growth profit

[27:11] in the future.

[27:12] And so if you have a service-based business that has the exact same

[27:16] economics as a software company, you will get software

[27:19] like multiples in enterprise value.

[27:22] You want to solve for the things that matter,

[27:24] which is you want to solve for revenue retention.

[27:26] You want to solve for incremental margin.

[27:28] You want to solve for logo retention,

[27:30] over your meaning, number of businesses

[27:31] that are staying on your platform or on your inside of your business.

[27:34] You want to solve for being able to onboard low value

[27:38] people to be able to provide high value services.

[27:41] So this is where a tech-enabled service can be more valuable

[27:45] than a traditional service because a tech-enabled service

[27:47] might be able to take one person to have them

[27:49] serve 50 customers rather than one person

[27:51] and have them serve five.

[27:52] But it's not because it's tech-enabled.

[27:54] It's because you have now 10x the value that any individual employee

[27:59] can provide and lowered the skill barrier for somebody

[28:03] to provide that value.

[28:05] And so that translates into higher-growth margins,

[28:08] lower cost of acquiring talent,

[28:09] and higher percentage of customers that stay over year,

[28:12] which means that the business will compound you over year

[28:13] over year.

[28:14] And so you can wash away all of the labels

[28:18] that people describe to business and simply boil it down

[28:21] to the metrics and the unit economics of the business

[28:23] to then ascertain fancy word, figure out what the enterprise

[28:28] value multiple of the businesses

[28:29] because it's only going to be a discount off of how big

[28:33] and how likely that bigness is to occur in the future for an investor.

[28:37] A lot of small business owners entrepreneurs

[28:39] want to get the maximum amount of money for their business in the future.

[28:42] And that makes sense.

[28:43] You should do that.

[28:43] But the way you do that is not by trying to pretend

[28:45] to be a different type of business.

[28:47] It's not by taking your long-care business

[28:49] and trying to say actually we're a software business.

[28:52] It's not trying to take your e-commerce business

[28:54] and saying actually we're a platform.

[28:56] It doesn't work that way.

[28:57] It all boils down to the actual math.

[28:59] And so the easiest analogy is if you think about your business as a pig

[29:03] and this is the world's ugly as pig,

[29:04] if you put lipstick on the pig, it's still a pig.

[29:07] And so if you put lipstick or you sprinkle some software on your long-care

[29:11] business, your local service business, it's still a local service business.

[29:14] And one of the mistakes that I honestly see all the time is

[29:17] where people will take their service, say I'll give you the service for free

[29:21] if you use the software.

[29:22] But here's the problem.

[29:24] The revenue will look just like service revenue.

[29:28] And so just because you bill through a software system,

[29:31] if you still have the same turn as a service business

[29:34] and the same margins as a service business,

[29:37] then they will still value you like a service business.

[29:39] You'll get valued based on a multiple of bottom line, which is fine.

[29:42] It's just not going to be a top line multiple or some big number

[29:45] of top that because that's not the nature of the business you're in.

[29:49] And that's okay.

[29:50] So I think just leaning into who you are and what your business really is,

[29:55] rather than wasting a tremendous amount of time trying to be something you're not,

[29:58] would serve a huge percentage of business owners.

[30:00] They think because the grass is greener on the software side, man,

[30:03] they're getting 10x value multiples.

[30:05] Well, do you know how hard it is to get 80% of people to stick on a software

[30:10] and do it in a way where you're making that kind of money?

[30:14] But it's at $50 a month, it's at $5,000 a month.

[30:17] Well, in some ways, it's like they kind of deserve it.

[30:21] Right?

[30:22] All of a sudden, it's really hard to get $5,000 customers to pay $1,000 a month

[30:27] for being a be software, really tough.

[30:29] But is it nearly as hard to do some sort of service at that level?

[30:34] Probably not.

[30:36] And so when we think about it from that perspective, the differences between valuations

[30:40] actually equalize.

[30:41] I'll tell you one more story around this.

[30:42] So I recently invested in a treatment center and we were talking about the business model.

[30:47] And so basically there's two more permutations, but this is said simply.

[30:51] There's two kind of models in the treatment world.

[30:53] So model one is you stick with primarily insurance and you get people to, you know,

[30:59] the insurance companies send you people who need to, you know, come off addictions, detox, etc.

[31:03] And then you get paid to fix kind of rate per day based on the insurance that the person

[31:06] comes in with.

[31:07] The second type of company is more, you know, private insurance and cash pay, where people

[31:11] are just paying out of pocket or they're paying with, you know, I was a premium insurance

[31:15] says where they could pay somewhere in the neighborhood of like $3,000 a day.

[31:18] So way more money per day than maybe the insurance based detox business, for example.

[31:25] Now, which business do you think gets higher multiples?

[31:28] The insurance based one, because the likely that the insurance pays is high and the likely

[31:31] that you're going to keep any customers from those insurance or Medicare companies, things like

[31:34] that is high.

[31:36] And so it becomes a reliable business, but the margins are lower and you have to do with

[31:40] more volume.

[31:41] Now on the alternative side, on the cash based side, you might have called it half the

[31:44] enterprise multiple value.

[31:45] So instead of getting a 10x, maybe get a five or sixx on the value of the business in

[31:49] terms of bottom line.

[31:50] But if you can charge two or three times more, return on effort might actually be the

[31:53] same or even better in the cash pack.

[31:55] I make this point to say, you don't want to try and build for some label that you think

[31:59] someone's going to ascribe to you, you just want to build for the ultimate enterprise

[32:03] value, which may just be doing better with the thing you have, which is more times the

[32:09] not the right move, which is why I'll reset this quote that I said at the beginning, which

[32:14] is success comes down to doing the obvious thing continuing to build your business for an extraordinary

[32:19] period of time, much longer than you think, without convincing yourself that you're

[32:22] smarter than you are.

[32:23] Without actually changing the label your business, trying to pretend to be a software company,

[32:26] trying to pretend to be a platform, trying to pretend to be tech-enable, just do what

[32:29] you do and do it well and do it for a long time.

[32:32] And it always takes longer, costs more, and it's harder than you expected to be.

[32:36] But it's the expectation that was the problem, not your plan.

[32:39] So now that we have the base, we have the right customers for the model that we're in,

[32:43] we have a way to iterate our products that we stay ahead of the market, and we have the discipline

[32:48] to continue to double down on the model we have, rather than trying to ascribe some crazy

[32:52] label, make some reinvestments into things that aren't going to actually serve us.

[32:55] Once we have that base, then you can watch this next video.

[32:58] I have to make so much money.

[32:59] It should feel legal.

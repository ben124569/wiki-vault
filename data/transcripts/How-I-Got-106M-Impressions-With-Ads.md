[00:00] What's going on everyone?

[00:00] I've got a special presentation for you today.

[00:03] This is going to be a little bit more advanced stuff.

[00:06] And it's because I'm partially making this for my team

[00:09] on the marketing side.

[00:09] So one of the things that I have found

[00:11] has been a consistent source of new marketing for us

[00:14] is understanding data.

[00:15] And so I think some people are much better

[00:16] until I'm stores annoying them.

[00:18] But I'm pretty decent at slicing data.

[00:21] And so the next thing is that there's always

[00:23] new inferences that you can derive from data

[00:25] that you can make the same thing mean different things.

[00:27] And so for example, I'll give you some statistics

[00:30] that we have that we've based entire campaigns around.

[00:33] So one campaign that was our most successful campaign

[00:36] that we've ever run was a one year later campaign.

[00:38] And so what that was was we took all of our clients

[00:41] that had been with us for over a year

[00:42] and measured all of their stats

[00:43] and measured their stats from before they were with us

[00:45] until now and you're later, and showed the difference.

[00:48] And the difference is we're crazy.

[00:49] 250,000, 500,000,000,000,000 dollars a year,

[00:52] actually are like there's massive differences.

[00:54] And so from that one measuring example,

[00:58] there's so many different sub divisions of data

[01:01] that you can use.

[01:02] You can just say, hey, when your later average client

[01:03] is up this, that would be one way to do the data.

[01:06] Another way to do that would be like one year later,

[01:09] or talk 20% of clients have added over $400,000 a year

[01:13] to their yearly revenue.

[01:14] Another one would be the bottom 80% at this.

[01:19] And so there's all these are like one in,

[01:22] here's another way of doing it.

[01:23] One in five gyms, I was doing it with us over a year,

[01:26] is over Z.

[01:29] And so there's different variables that you can play with.

[01:31] One is the percentage of people, the next is the goal

[01:35] and then the next is the duration piece.

[01:38] So you have these kind of three wheels that you can spin together

[01:42] to make really interesting statistics.

[01:43] And you can base so many campaigns around it.

[01:46] Like another campaign that we have that's launching soon is

[01:49] we just measured one in five point five gyms

[01:54] is over a million dollar year run rate for us.

[01:57] So for me, it's easy,

[01:59] because other people are like seven figure gym, blah blah blah.

[02:02] And so for me, I'm like, well, they're talking about it.

[02:04] We're doing it.

[02:05] And so I can always position myself

[02:06] because most people don't even capture their own data

[02:08] anyway so they don't even know.

[02:09] And it's usually because it's not good.

[02:11] They already know they don't have any million dollar gyms.

[02:12] They don't need to go measure that.

[02:14] We do know.

[02:15] So one in five point five sets 18%.

[02:17] Now if you're thinking about from marketing perspective,

[02:18] would you think 18% of gyms that we work with

[02:21] are some figure gyms?

[02:23] Maybe I don't think that sounds as compelling

[02:24] as one in five point five.

[02:26] Like really one in five, that's not that bad.

[02:29] And the thing is, is you can also invert that and say,

[02:31] all right, but four point five at a five point five gyms

[02:34] hit this, right?

[02:36] So it's like I can play on the desire

[02:40] that people have to win the lottery.

[02:41] It's a survivorship bias.

[02:42] Bit people think they're gonna be the one, right?

[02:44] But I can also play on the inverse,

[02:46] which is something that I like doing a lot,

[02:47] which is I love playing on averages.

[02:48] I love playing on medians with data because it's like,

[02:52] hey, this is just what the normal person does, right?

[02:54] Like, and here's what's cool.

[02:55] You can always say after you say now,

[02:56] average, that also means half of people are above this.

[02:59] We're like, wow, well, I consider myself above average.

[03:01] So I'm gonna be above that because everyone thinks

[03:03] they're above average, right?

[03:04] And so when you're clumping data together,

[03:07] you can use those three wheels, right?

[03:08] Wheel one is over what duration,

[03:10] wheel two is what is the outcome.

[03:15] And then I literally can't remember what,

[03:17] oh, and then the percentage of clients that achieve that.

[03:19] So it's percentage of clients, the outcome,

[03:21] and then the time duration.

[03:22] And so you have these wheels that you can make some match.

[03:23] And when you say percentage of clients,

[03:25] you can say percentage of clients.

[03:27] You can say the top percentage,

[03:28] the bottom percentage, the median, the average, right?

[03:32] And you can also say one in, right?

[03:34] So there's different ways.

[03:36] So you can also say the fractional version,

[03:37] like one fifth of, right?

[03:39] So all of these, that's just like,

[03:41] that was just on the one wheel of,

[03:44] what percentage of clients, right?

[03:46] What percentage, one fifth, one in however many,

[03:48] the fractional amount, the top percentage,

[03:50] the bottom percentage, so you can invert

[03:52] either one of those.

[03:53] So one in, five or four out of five, right?

[03:56] That would be the inversion of the same step.

[03:57] And so when I'm using all of that,

[03:59] like this is what I'm running through,

[04:00] and this is what I've had a really hard time teaching

[04:02] my team, which is why I'm making this right now.

[04:05] It's like this is what I'm running through,

[04:06] and I'm thinking when I'm looking at like the data

[04:08] that they get back from customer support,

[04:10] or excuse me, customer success,

[04:12] is like, here's all of the gyms that we have.

[04:14] I'm like, okay, how can we say this differently?

[04:16] How can we say this in a compelling way

[04:18] and make it a hook for our marketing, right?

[04:22] And so that was all the example

[04:23] I had for percentage of clients, right?

[04:25] Now, if we're talking time duration, right?

[04:28] So time duration, I'm gonna be thinking

[04:31] super long, long time away,

[04:34] and here's what's cool about when you use longer

[04:36] duration, so if someone's been with you for a year,

[04:37] the likely that they've succeeded is very high,

[04:39] especially in an education business.

[04:41] So I love pulling out the one year,

[04:43] two year later, a piece is because one,

[04:45] it shows that people stay with me for a long time,

[04:47] which means that I continually provide value, right?

[04:49] So that's social proof of continued value creation,

[04:52] which I like a lot.

[04:53] So boom, when you have the long term duration, it's great.

[04:55] And that's an advantage,

[04:56] especially if you're an older player in the space,

[04:58] having those one year, two year later,

[04:59] testimonials is something that no one else can show,

[05:02] that you can show to also demonstrate

[05:04] your long standingness in the space, right?

[05:06] But on top of that, somebody's been with you

[05:07] for that long, is gonna usually have a very good outcome.

[05:09] And so if I just say, hey, the people have been with me

[05:11] for over a year average this, that it's like,

[05:14] wow, that's crazy, right?

[05:15] And so the data will give a very positive impression

[05:20] of what you're marketing, right?

[05:22] Flipside is that you can cut it at different times, right?

[05:26] You can look at first week, you can look at first 30 days,

[05:28] you can look at first two months, right?

[05:30] And so the thing is, if you have this data

[05:32] on a regular basis, you can, you can time stamp this stuff,

[05:36] and really, you can slice it and find the slice

[05:38] that you're like, oh, this is really good.

[05:40] For us, our average gym in the first,

[05:43] I guess for us 15 days, the 15 days.

[05:46] Here's the first two weeks to 15,500, right?

[05:49] In addition to run, let's see average,

[05:50] which means half people get better than that, right?

[05:52] Crazy.

[05:53] And so, and I give you the other sted earlier,

[05:55] one in 5.5 gyms is a million dollar gym, right?

[05:58] And so, I can play with these numbers

[06:01] because I could have said 18%,

[06:03] where I could have said, with the 15,500,

[06:07] I could say that's, what's the outcome, right?

[06:09] The outcome, wheel could be, what's the increase, right?

[06:12] If it was the increase, it might be like the average person,

[06:15] doubles what they do in revenue in the first 14 days.

[06:18] That's the different way of saying it, right?

[06:21] I don't know what the actual number is,

[06:22] because I don't have that one off hand,

[06:24] but that would be something that I beat.

[06:25] That's something I would ask my team.

[06:26] I'd be like, hey, the figure out what the fraction is here,

[06:28] is it a doubling, is it a 1.5x, is it a 30% increase?

[06:32] Well, 30% increase doesn't sound as good as 1500, right?

[06:35] So I'm going to say that one instead.

[06:36] And so, when we're talking about increases,

[06:40] there's four ways you can show it.

[06:41] One is a percent increase,

[06:44] which is this one up by x percent, right?

[06:46] The next is an absolute increase,

[06:47] which is additional, 15,500, right?

[06:51] The next would be the actual total number made,

[06:56] which would be the revenue plus the increase, boom, right?

[07:00] Which would be different, but similar, right?

[07:03] So you've got the, just the increase,

[07:05] you've got the total amount made,

[07:06] you've got the percentage increase,

[07:08] you've got a relative increase,

[07:10] which is one that I like, which is,

[07:11] what is 15,500 by you, right?

[07:14] So 15,500 might be like,

[07:17] I would have to look up industry averages,

[07:18] but I'd say the, you know, maybe industry average

[07:20] for a micro gym rent might be,

[07:22] let's say $2,000 a month.

[07:24] So I'd say, in the first 30 days,

[07:26] the average gym in our program pays off three quarters

[07:30] are nine months of rent.

[07:31] Wow, that sounds kind of interesting, right?

[07:34] Like that's compelling, that's unique, right?

[07:37] So hopefully you're falling along with me,

[07:38] you're like, the three big wheels, right?

[07:40] Wheel number one, you've got is what's the outcome?

[07:43] Wheel number two is the time duration,

[07:46] and wheel number three is what percentage of clients,

[07:48] you know, achieve this outcome.

[07:49] And so when you're playing with these three wheels

[07:51] and you're slicing the data,

[07:52] all of these wheels have variables,

[07:54] which is why you can slice data in so many different directions.

[07:57] But for me, this is usually what I will search for.

[08:00] Like this is what I will hunt for.

[08:02] I will look for the piece of data

[08:05] that tells the story that the copy can't tell,

[08:10] or it can reinforce the story that the copy tells

[08:13] and makes it foam work compelling, right?

[08:14] Now mind you, you have to be absolutely compliant

[08:16] when you use numbers, right?

[08:17] Which is one of the things I also like doing it

[08:19] because we track our stuff, and most of our,

[08:21] you know, most people in our space don't,

[08:23] because they're, you know, still figuring out how to,

[08:25] you know, market and figure out their business.

[08:27] But the thing is, it's most people don't track their stuff.

[08:29] And so I have a huge bit of energy

[08:30] because I've been tracking this stuff for years, right?

[08:32] And on top of that, we have, we have pretty decent metrics

[08:35] around this stuff, especially around clients' success.

[08:38] And so with that, I can hunt and say, okay, let's look at

[08:43] new clients, you know, first, first, eight weeks, right?

[08:46] What's the increase in revenue?

[08:48] Okay, and the thing is, everything I just talked about

[08:51] was one stat, right?

[08:52] I just talked about revenue.

[08:54] I could use the same three wheels with time,

[08:57] the customer outcome, and then what percentage

[09:00] of them achieved it.

[09:01] I could use those same three wheels with any of the stats.

[09:04] I could use it with profit.

[09:05] I could use the revenue.

[09:05] I could use it with turn.

[09:06] I could use it with, I could even use it with growth percentage, right?

[09:11] I could use it with, like there's so many different ways I can,

[09:14] I can use those three wheels in my marketing.

[09:17] But usually this will be the central core concept

[09:20] that I will make an entire campaign around, right?

[09:22] Because at the end of the day, there's only so many ways

[09:24] for me to say we make just more money, right?

[09:27] I mean, and the thing is, at the end of the day,

[09:28] everyone promises that.

[09:29] So the question is, how can I make a different

[09:32] more unique promise, and how can I make it more compelling

[09:36] and believable that they will achieve it, right?

[09:39] And so that's kind of why I use data

[09:41] as most of the times the central selling point

[09:44] that I have for any program that I sell.

[09:47] Now, the good thing is, is that, and I've always done it

[09:50] that way because I'm usually way way of convicted

[09:52] because it's easy to have conviction in stats

[09:54] because those are what they are.

[09:55] So I can have absolute conviction that this is what it is.

[09:58] So take it or leave it, these are the stats, right?

[10:00] Like you can choose, if I said, I might,

[10:02] my weight loss program has an 87% success rate

[10:05] of people hitting over 15 pounds, then,

[10:10] like me even said, like, have a this.

[10:12] I'll say it differently.

[10:13] Let's say I had, let's say my success rate of people

[10:16] hitting over, I have a 70% success rate of people

[10:19] hitting over 12 pounds loss in their first six weeks with me, right?

[10:25] There's two variables that I'm playing actually three again,

[10:28] which is, what percentage of the customers achieve

[10:30] extra result, right?

[10:31] And I can change extra results,

[10:32] because that's a what percentage customers achieve

[10:34] over 30 pounds loss, it'd be much smaller,

[10:37] it won't be like 10%, right?

[10:39] And sometimes it's worth saying the top 10% of our clients

[10:41] hit X, I think it works better with this and stuff,

[10:43] but like in a way loss scenario, that would be,

[10:45] that would be an example, it's like I have this percentage

[10:48] of customers achieve this percent, and I can move these, right?

[10:51] And so I find a sweet spot where I look in the data

[10:53] and I'm like, huh, 70% of our clients hit over

[10:57] 16 pounds lost, that's pretty good, right?

[11:01] In this period of time, and so now I can start marketing that,

[11:03] because I have the data supported and substantiate it, right?

[11:06] And so when I'm thinking about new hooks, right?

[11:09] Here's a different one that I ran that crushed it for us,

[11:11] which is, I told you earlier about the 5.5 gyms,

[11:14] one of 5.5 gyms is a million dollar gym,

[11:17] here's another way you can do it with the time,

[11:18] I didn't even get into the time variation one yet,

[11:20] is that I can say one in every, excuse me,

[11:24] every X days, X minutes, X hours, X weeks, X months,

[11:29] we achieve a Y, right?

[11:31] And so I found out, because I looked at our stats

[11:34] and I think the last year we had done gosh,

[11:36] I don't know, it was like, I honestly can't remember the number,

[11:38] but I do remember the outcome, it was,

[11:42] I think we had created like 50 something,

[11:45] some figure gyms in 2019 or 2020, something like that, anyways.

[11:49] Point is, as we created that many,

[11:51] and I was like, well, there's 52 weeks in a year,

[11:53] that means that one in every 7.7 days,

[11:57] we create another 7 figure gym.

[12:00] So that means basically every week,

[12:02] we're cranking out another 7 figure gym.

[12:04] So it takes the idea of like,

[12:06] this is how many of these outcomes we've had, right?

[12:10] So again in that weight loss example,

[12:11] I could say, how many people have we had lose 20 pounds,

[12:15] over the last year, and they might say,

[12:18] we've had 200 people hit that.

[12:21] I'd be like, cool, so we can say,

[12:22] every two days, another person across this 20 pounds loss

[12:25] in my facility.

[12:27] Wow, is there a different way of saying,

[12:30] X percent of people hit this goal in X period, is that right?

[12:32] So there's these different ways of slicing it.

[12:35] And so I would implore you, and this is also for my team,

[12:37] that when we're looking at what our main hook,

[12:39] our main messaging that we're gonna wrap

[12:41] the whole campaign around, is let's look at the data,

[12:44] right?

[12:45] And let's think about the three wheels, what's the outcome?

[12:49] What percentage people hit it, over what time duration,

[12:51] and then play with all of them, right?

[12:54] With the time duration, it's one in every how many days,

[12:56] every how many minutes, every how many,

[12:57] whatever is it, is it over one year,

[12:59] is it in the first 30 days, in the first six weeks,

[13:01] whatever, like, is that, that's the time duration.

[13:04] The customer already said all the million ways

[13:07] of slicing the outcome and the percentage, right?

[13:10] And so hopefully that makes sense for you,

[13:11] I hope you find the valuable,

[13:13] that probably give you unlimited ways of slicing your own data,

[13:16] but I'm telling you it's one of the most compelling things

[13:18] in the world because it's just true.

[13:22] So I'll leave you with that, keep being awesome.

[13:25] That was a huge marketing hack

[13:27] that has made me a tremendous amount of money.

[13:28] So use it and be fruitful.

[13:31] Bye!

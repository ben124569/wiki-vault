[00:00] If you asked MJ, would you rather pre-sumined

[00:01] or seventh ring, you'd say a seventh-fucking-rock talking about?

[00:04] Different objectives.

[00:05] What is yours?

[00:06] You wish it possible?

[00:08] What?

[00:10] Trying to change some legs and I'm going to Mr. Alex Hermosy too.

[00:13] But bunch of old broken men, and need a lot of warm-up.

[00:17] So, we're doing legs.

[00:21] Supply.

[00:22] All right, you want to just alternate?

[00:23] Like we'll go, I'll go one direction, you go the other.

[00:30] So, you can just step the leaf heavy.

[00:31] I'll do whatever you do.

[00:32] I want to go one.

[00:33] Yeah, let's go.

[00:42] What's the heavy she had in the office season?

[00:43] She said, I need the heavy stuff I've ever been.

[00:44] I kind of stopped trying to push food right now,

[00:47] and I'm going to slowly bring it down from here.

[00:48] Because even for you to keep winning,

[00:51] it's like you don't even more size, right?

[00:53] I have a little room.

[00:54] Do you ever hear like two pounds?

[00:56] I don't.

[00:57] And I can always be leaner and I keep putting

[00:59] on weight and I keep making weight.

[01:00] So, yeah, we just keep working.

[01:10] Just, I could have worn you all now.

[01:12] It's a kind of a rush in my car.

[01:14] I'll get it.

[01:22] Come on, deep breath.

[01:23] Easy breath, come on.

[01:26] You go.

[01:28] Yep.

[01:30] Easy.

[01:31] It came out the top of there for some reason.

[01:33] Ha, ha, ha.

[01:34] This counter intuitive there.

[01:36] Once you succeed at bodybuilding,

[01:38] everything comes with this success, a bodybuilding.

[01:40] Revenge you from succeeding at bodybuilding.

[01:43] Yeah.

[01:43] You're like speaking and guess posing.

[01:45] Yeah.

[01:46] Traveling podcasts, whatever.

[01:48] Not wanting to wait till you retire to start a business

[01:50] and all this shit.

[01:51] Well, I don't think you should.

[01:52] No.

[01:53] Like, starting a business when you retire is like,

[01:57] no one cares anymore.

[01:57] We're just like four stress.

[02:00] We post, we get 450 posts a week.

[02:02] How often do you film?

[02:04] Like, it might read it out every day.

[02:06] Now, it's like, it's changed every time.

[02:09] Before, in the very beginning,

[02:10] it was once every 90 days, I once whole day.

[02:12] Really.

[02:13] And we do like a hundred of clips, just styles it.

[02:15] Yeah.

[02:16] And then it switched to every other week.

[02:17] And then it became Fridays.

[02:20] And then now it's like, you know,

[02:22] I think I'm better if I'm pressure

[02:23] and I do fewer more.

[02:25] Yeah.

[02:26] And so that's something like in the moment.

[02:28] It's exactly what it is.

[02:29] It's basically like, damn, as it's me,

[02:30] it's like, ready if you feel like stepping away at any time.

[02:34] So I'm doing my shit in the morning

[02:35] if I'm like lightning strike.

[02:37] I go down, and I talk about something that's

[02:39] how to mind.

[02:40] I got to ask.

[02:41] Done any.

[02:42] Then when I was in there with no one in the crowd

[02:44] and filmed it.

[02:44] Yeah, no, I did, because we lied to team there.

[02:46] But like, had this theory, I do better

[02:48] or lied at live things than I do in front of the camera.

[02:52] It's just more interesting.

[02:53] And so I was like, can I approximate that?

[02:55] So then we did the whole setup.

[02:56] We did the presentation, the stage.

[03:00] And then they set my team's out in the audience.

[03:03] And I gave the presentation, but it's not the same.

[03:05] We're not talking to empty chairs.

[03:07] What is?

[03:07] It's still mostly empty chairs.

[03:09] They're the same time.

[03:10] Can't feel a road, yeah.

[03:11] We opted out of doing that.

[03:13] We did it like four times.

[03:15] And then we closed out of doing it.

[03:16] And so then I started doing Instagram Lives.

[03:18] And that was way more like fun.

[03:20] Yeah.

[03:21] Also, it's like the room's got two thousand people in it.

[03:24] Or whatever.

[03:25] So that's nice.

[03:26] I mean, if you can pretend in front of a fucking empty chair,

[03:29] that's harder than a crowd.

[03:30] So, yeah, all right.

[03:31] It's just about the on light.

[03:32] Yeah.

[03:33] I had this tweet that went kind of, I was like,

[03:35] if you're like 16 to 25, I could just get in shape.

[03:38] Yeah.

[03:39] Like, because once you're in shape, you can say in shape.

[03:41] But like, you have the time.

[03:43] And you'll get different priorities later.

[03:44] Yeah.

[03:45] Since I just do it then.

[03:46] You have all the firm.

[03:47] Yeah, I'm grateful that I, I was obsessed from 15.

[03:51] I was early when I was 14 until I started

[03:54] being 25.

[03:54] This is right around when I started my job.

[03:56] Let's 23, but I guess it's starting.

[03:58] I stopped from being with my first.

[03:59] When you're 23.

[03:59] Yeah, when I stopped.

[04:00] Yeah.

[04:01] Got my state record.

[04:02] I think I got national.

[04:05] That's very, very nice.

[04:06] There's 50 states.

[04:08] I think 23 when I dropped, no, 22 is when I dropped

[04:10] at a university.

[04:11] And that's when I started doing a full time.

[04:12] Were you like a junior senior inside?

[04:14] Poud it.

[04:16] There for four years, but on my second year of school.

[04:19] So, see you, you lived.

[04:22] But I was jack.

[04:23] That's a lot of matter.

[04:25] Which, in your actual life, that is all the matter.

[04:26] Exactly.

[04:27] Yeah, pay the off.

[04:28] But we think you'd do lift weights for living.

[04:29] You're like, actually, yes.

[04:31] That sounds great.

[04:32] Yeah, literally would spend four hours in the way room

[04:34] and then like being the cafeteria all day.

[04:36] All right, that's life.

[04:37] All right.

[04:38] Yeah.

[04:39] Are you the only member of Roth, let it close?

[04:44] No, so they're a public gym.

[04:45] Oh, is it?

[04:46] We just opened it like six weeks ago.

[04:48] Oh.

[04:49] That's a task sure where it was.

[04:51] Where your private gym is.

[04:53] No, my private gym is a whole way from there.

[04:54] This is a Nashville Florida.

[04:56] It's a Florida.

[04:57] Why are our partners in Nashville?

[04:59] Who have carbon culture?

[05:00] Maybe that's who you have.

[05:01] Not a carbon culture.

[05:02] Yeah, yeah, we're together, Jim.

[05:02] Yeah.

[05:03] Oh, is he doing some of the formulation stuff?

[05:05] He's actually our partner in the color and the business.

[05:07] He used to own the manufacturer.

[05:09] And then we partnered with them, and together,

[05:12] pricing and help on our payment plan and all the bullshit.

[05:15] Yep, because I knew he did that.

[05:17] I remember I got connected his location operator

[05:20] when I went in, knew who I was.

[05:22] He was like, you should talk to our owner.

[05:23] I was like, all right, you know what I mean?

[05:25] He's like, no, he's just, you know, a bubble of a salesman point.

[05:27] So I think we had a phone call or something.

[05:29] Yeah.

[05:30] Yeah.

[05:31] He's a really good guy.

[05:32] He's smart.

[05:33] Yeah, I know he's selling business.

[05:34] He quoted us from a manufacturer.

[05:37] Oh, yeah.

[05:38] Yeah, he's one of the, I think he's a final three bits.

[05:39] We're going into the company, but probably should have gone with him.

[05:42] All right, we'll get our hands.

[05:43] Yeah.

[05:44] So we've got, I've got this thing.

[05:46] You got a proper pad.

[05:47] I do have a proper pad.

[05:49] Fancy.

[05:50] I used to set up next to this pole here.

[05:53] Just have something to balance on.

[05:55] He's a dumbbeller.

[05:57] Yeah, I used to grab a dumbbell.

[06:00] How do you do it?

[06:01] Yeah, well, I just never held on something.

[06:02] Oh, well, this I cheat, this I do it.

[06:05] That's it.

[06:06] Hey, I'm gonna put a little bit of music on.

[06:09] Cause we have a sound system, all here with silence.

[06:12] What does kind of nice hearing you pant?

[06:14] No one tried out.

[06:23] See your minestration.

[06:25] Sorry, your minestration.

[06:27] If they want motivates you, and I'll just be like, this guy right here.

[06:34] That's what comes in my gym and let's more than me.

[06:36] Yeah, that's a motivation.

[06:37] That is.

[06:38] I used to really like barbell lunges.

[06:48] Like they used to tear my glutes up more than anything.

[06:51] That one I hit glutes.

[06:52] They're great.

[06:53] Walking lunges are in fucking incredible but like, you know, you can load them.

[06:57] Just such a bitch to do.

[06:59] Like, I left this whole quarter empty for all that.

[07:03] That for walking on you.

[07:04] Cause lay that out.

[07:05] Cause lay was hardcore for two point locking lines.

[07:08] Yeah, that's the biggest idea.

[07:10] Two to 25.

[07:11] Two to 25.

[07:12] That was wrong and you know.

[07:14] And that's what I was using six thousand calories there.

[07:17] I just was like, I read this thing.

[07:18] It was like, instance the most ain't a bar core moon.

[07:21] That's like, done.

[07:23] And so more food.

[07:24] There's a lot of that I met.

[07:25] She used to make me a box of pancakes for breakfast.

[07:28] There's a cake.

[07:29] I do half a thing of syrup.

[07:31] And I passed out again.

[07:33] And then I wake up.

[07:35] I work out.

[07:36] I'd have a 1200 calorie shake.

[07:37] Then I'd have a burrito.

[07:38] Double-rated double-rises sour cream, chips on the side, quack.

[07:42] And then I'd get back home for dinner.

[07:44] And I'd have one box of pasta and one jar of tomato sauce.

[07:47] That's because the box of pasta, 70 grams of brutes.

[07:50] Yeah, I eat pasta a lot.

[07:51] Oh, I like that.

[07:52] Just a great thing.

[07:53] Yeah, me to enrice.

[07:54] I do really well with that.

[07:55] I'd buy some of your ice.

[07:56] I could just eat on limited amount.

[07:58] And you told me, you like that?

[08:00] No.

[08:01] I could talk about that.

[08:02] Yeah.

[08:03] I eat like, oh, like, I got like in the ice restaurant.

[08:05] I have a steak and then like chips and something.

[08:07] And I'm like, oh, my stomach.

[08:09] All right, you want to use that, Max?

[08:11] Oh, oh.

[08:13] Oh, so I'm gonna feel it like glutius.

[08:15] Yeah, I haven't done those in the long pan.

[08:18] I would this what's what's here.

[08:20] So usually when I do my warm up, I'll do this guy.

[08:23] This?

[08:24] Yeah.

[08:25] Now for this, I mean, I'll come work.

[08:26] But I'll do that guy and I'll do that.

[08:28] The hip flexure one.

[08:30] Like I'm multi-hitting.

[08:31] Glitter.

[08:32] I actually do this.

[08:34] Up. Like up here.

[08:35] But I think I need that mobility stuff more than the strength.

[08:38] I mean, we probably could argue that if you took 20 minutes of your workout.

[08:41] And I got a good, like, constructive mobility.

[08:44] You'd be better off.

[08:45] Well, I mean, I did way more weight than I normally do.

[08:47] So yeah.

[08:48] That'll learn it.

[08:49] Yeah, literally.

[08:50] Today, especially.

[08:51] So I put one rule for the whole gym.

[08:54] Is that this machine keeps four plates always?

[08:56] You're all five?

[08:57] Yeah, I think so.

[09:03] You're a plan on leaving the building or this, like, home.

[09:20] Yeah, it's just for the next three or five.

[09:22] Three to five.

[09:23] I like Vegas a lot.

[09:25] More than I think I've liked any city I've lived in as an adult.

[09:28] It's just like, it's a non-djudgmental city.

[09:32] Everyone pretends to be something.

[09:34] Then they come to Vegas and they let the real selves out.

[09:37] Yeah. And I just, like, being here.

[09:40] And so also it's not political, because it's for chores,

[09:43] and it has to be just neutral.

[09:45] So it's not political at all.

[09:46] Try like, it's great for traveling in and out.

[09:49] Everybody I know, it comes to Vegas once a year anyways.

[09:51] So I could see, honey pill.

[09:53] If I lived in Cincinnati, I wouldn't ever see you.

[09:55] Right.

[09:56] So I get to, like, I benefit from this.

[09:58] We have direct flights everywhere.

[09:59] Out four hours from the beach in the mountains.

[10:01] Yeah.

[10:02] 30 minutes in the lake.

[10:03] We've got the best food in dining and shows the world.

[10:05] It's tax-free.

[10:07] It's dry.

[10:08] Which I personally like.

[10:09] But UFC's here.

[10:10] Is there old building?

[10:11] I mean, it's a perfect setup for this.

[10:13] Yeah.

[10:14] I'd like to see you on the like warehouse space too.

[10:16] No, right.

[10:17] I'd like to deal with that bullshit.

[10:18] Right.

[10:22] Nice.

[10:32] Nice.

[10:46] There's a little quarter of that.

[10:47] Oh, yeah.

[10:48] Just your time on your attention is great of you.

[10:50] Because you can't skip for the week parts.

[10:53] But it's like that is the week part.

[10:55] Yeah.

[10:56] Well, yeah.

[10:57] It's interesting.

[10:58] It's just this balance of like I want to push, but like the risk or reward

[11:01] of pushing goes down a lot.

[11:03] Literally.

[11:04] Because like you really just want to maintain on as little effort

[11:07] as possible or a little risk as possible.

[11:09] It's hard.

[11:10] Especially because they added weight cap to everybody and my weight

[11:13] cooked in my category except me.

[11:15] I got like two pounds and everyone else got six to eight.

[11:17] Why?

[11:19] Just because I was unfair.

[11:21] People were complaining that people at the height of six one had

[11:24] an unfair advantage.

[11:25] Like statistically or something?

[11:27] No, people were just complaining.

[11:29] I was the only one in that category.

[11:31] So that happened and then now everyone got better.

[11:34] So I actually have to improve and like fine tuna.

[11:37] But I'm also like the most old broken guy in the category.

[11:40] So I also have to be the safest.

[11:42] Yeah.

[11:43] What is interesting from like a best retrospective?

[11:45] That's like risk adjusted return.

[11:48] Yeah.

[11:49] Like the same thing.

[11:50] If you're at fifth place, you can take all the risks you can because

[11:54] if you fail you lost nothing because no one cares.

[11:56] So if you win it makes all the difference.

[11:58] Exactly.

[11:59] I've always found it so interesting with repeat champions.

[12:02] Uh-huh.

[12:03] Like a most of them are like, I mean Michael Jones over him.

[12:06] I was like, I counted.

[12:07] But he's not happy.

[12:08] He's a miserable motherfucker.

[12:09] He just found some way to continuously drive his way in a miserable fashion.

[12:12] Yeah.

[12:13] And people look up to that and they want to be that.

[12:15] And I'm like, he didn't do it right.

[12:16] Yeah.

[12:17] What he did, but he did it.

[12:18] Right.

[12:19] It's just like my goal is your goal.

[12:20] My goal would have to be happy and have peace with mine.

[12:23] Yeah.

[12:25] And I think if you asked MJ, would you rather pre-sumined or a seventh ring?

[12:29] You'd say a seventh fucking ring.

[12:30] So I think, yeah, running goal mode,

[12:32] together we'll be able to walk or have nine pedals.

[12:34] You'd say nine pedals.

[12:35] Yeah.

[12:36] And that's where you zoom all the way.

[12:37] And it's like making a judgeman on anyone else's goals in general.

[12:40] It's stupid because they're going to have to same George.

[12:42] Yeah.

[12:43] So I would do a different, no shit.

[12:44] You're different.

[12:45] Like, I had somebody a family member tell me.

[12:48] They were like, I would never live my life like you.

[12:50] And I was like, no shit.

[12:53] And I would never live my life like you, which is why you have your life and I live my life.

[12:56] And good thing is you don't have to live mine and I don't have to live yours.

[12:59] It's interesting about how you define champion too.

[13:01] Like, I had to think about it like a year ago.

[13:04] It's like, do I want to be the richest man in the world?

[13:06] And I was like, no, I don't think that's my goal.

[13:09] So that was just gonna ask you that.

[13:11] What were you talking about?

[13:13] Different objectives.

[13:14] What is yours?

[13:16] Honestly, I want to, is it just be rich and possible?

[13:19] No, no, no, no.

[13:20] It's not.

[13:21] I see wealth as a measure of my personal growth.

[13:24] Yeah.

[13:25] Because I see entrepreneurship as the most quantitative path of personal development.

[13:28] It's more, I want to be the richest man to out to me come.

[13:31] Not for the richest man in the world.

[13:33] Now that happens to become the richest man in the world, cool.

[13:35] I'm not against it.

[13:36] Yeah.

[13:37] But me measuring my wealth against other people is not the right game for me.

[13:42] But me measuring my wealth against what I believe I can create is a game that I can compute in and we'll always try to copy it.

[13:49] And so me seeing a really hard thing for me was when we sold Jim Lach, my monthly cash flow because I was no owner went to zero.

[13:56] And I was like, that's a mine, fuck.

[13:58] Yeah.

[13:59] So I was like, all of a sudden, even though I had a bunch of cash in the bank account, I felt poorer.

[14:03] So I was like, okay, this is weird.

[14:06] Ooh, each.

[14:08] And so I'd like recalibrate.

[14:10] And that's why I had this year where I started making content about like the meaning of money and like all this stuff.

[14:15] Yeah.

[14:16] That's when I had to redefine like what?

[14:18] Where am I the most? Where do I grow the most?

[14:21] I grew the most when I work hard on things worth doing.

[14:24] And so then it was like, how do I orient my life in a way that I maximize the amount of hard work I do on things worth doing?

[14:30] And then once I saw what those days looked like, I had an immense worth of mine, my first boss ever.

[14:35] I'd have like a really good week.

[14:37] And I was like, that was like, probably one of the best weeks I've had in my life.

[14:39] And she was like, not a profound person.

[14:41] And she was like, I'm pretty sure the secret of life is living as many of those days in a row as you can.

[14:45] And she and for such a tactical, like, I was like, so that's what I'll do.

[14:49] Oh, I think what are the days that I do my best?

[14:52] And how do I live that day as many times in a row as I can?

[14:55] And that's pretty much just the path that I've been on in the day.

[14:57] A step that has occurred has occurred.

[15:00] But that's the least how I think about it.

[15:02] And your path of feeling like best days are wealth building.

[15:06] For our personal wealth building, not like for yourself, but your own goals.

[15:10] It's usually me creating stuff.

[15:12] And so like my arc happens to the business related.

[15:15] So like I draw like my books are picture buzz.

[15:18] I draw pics about business.

[15:20] I write books about business.

[15:22] I make videos about business.

[15:23] I'm like, podcast about business.

[15:24] Like that's just all I think about.

[15:26] And so like if I happen to do that about like electric cars,

[15:29] no one would care.

[15:30] They'd be like, oh, he's passionate about it.

[15:32] It's shit that I happen to be passionate about something that makes money.

[15:34] Yeah.

[15:35] But it's all I think about.

[15:36] I almost have more interested in business than I am doing business.

[15:39] Like my days, I only do do business hardcore.

[15:42] One or two days a week.

[15:44] The rest of my days are making things that help other people do business.

[15:47] But like me, like doing this, is this doing business?

[15:50] I mean, we make media.

[15:52] Yeah.

[15:53] You know?

[15:54] But like also me working out with people that I care about, that I enjoy.

[15:57] Is all my list of things that I do on my best days.

[16:00] I enjoy it.

[16:01] And so I respect that.

[16:02] I feel like a lot of people now are almost like,

[16:04] they just show many opinions out there.

[16:06] Like what's right to the world rather than to themselves?

[16:09] I mean, like you said, wouldn't what's like a champion?

[16:12] I had this thing when I was young.

[16:13] I said, I always talk with champion mentality and I had no idea what a man.

[16:16] And I'd begin to define it.

[16:18] Now I need to consistently reiterate that it's my definition of what a champion is.

[16:22] What's a champion to me?

[16:23] Is that the true only thing that a champion does is they make their own rules?

[16:27] Yeah.

[16:28] Because they don't get fuck what other people think they do whatever they want.

[16:30] Doesn't mean I'm winning, doesn't mean that.

[16:31] And it just means I'm doing whatever the fuck I want and I'm doing it the best I can.

[16:34] So like for example, if they change the rules of the game for you that in order to win,

[16:38] you had to, I don't know, fucking kill your liver, something.

[16:42] No, I'm just making it like whatever.

[16:44] Then you would have to make the decision, do I want to win by their rules or do I want to win my mind?

[16:48] Exactly.

[16:49] And I would leave.

[16:50] Right.

[16:51] I think that is the difference between a champion who wins for the approval and a champion who wins for themselves.

[16:57] Yeah.

[16:58] Is that if they change the rules, if you're vision of what a champion is no overlines with the third party approval?

[17:03] Then you don't do it.

[17:04] You don't play.

[17:05] And I think there's a lot of ways to be choosing what games to play.

[17:08] For sure.

[17:09] Not a feeling like you have to.

[17:11] I never want to feel like I have to.

[17:13] Oh dude, my number one rule in life.

[17:15] I'll do everything in the world to not have to do anything.

[17:19] So fun story about cabs, so you don't know this about me.

[17:22] But I train cabs every single day for more than 10 years.

[17:26] And I developed 10 in I use my foot from doing so many sense of cabs.

[17:30] So I did 7 sets of 20 in a new cab show.

[17:33] No, I just don't play.

[17:35] But they were, they were, I had a girl that I did.

[17:38] It was like, why don't you train your cabs?

[17:39] And I was like, I fucking train.

[17:41] Come fall the top.

[17:42] It's so that I went from three days a week doing them at the end.

[17:47] To doing them 7 sets at the beginning.

[17:50] As in my cabs.

[17:51] But this, I have in train cabs right now.

[17:54] Like me doing this with you.

[17:55] There's a first time I train cabs in like probably a year.

[17:58] We're literally like literally haven't done any reps.

[18:00] And there's because I got 10 to 90s.

[18:02] I was like, I was strolling walking because of the,

[18:04] There's some muscle in like the base of my foot.

[18:07] It's like under my big toe.

[18:08] But I'll do this because I had the champ and talent.

[18:10] Of course.

[18:11] Maybe now you'll stretch and train cabs again.

[18:13] Yeah, I was all I have to do is I have to stretch my cabs out.

[18:16] Oh yeah.

[18:21] This is a really good cab machine.

[18:23] So that's the thing is like, I hate the load,

[18:26] I love the way that the lever is perfect.

[18:28] Yeah.

[18:29] See how it's able to lie on either.

[18:30] No, they're in your motion.

[18:31] Moose so much.

[18:32] Yeah.

[18:33] My cabs are going to be crippled.

[18:35] Just for doing like three sets.

[18:36] They're going to be fucking smokes.

[18:37] Yeah.

[18:38] If you don't train cabs, they get fucked.

[18:39] Oh, you're just right.

[18:40] Yeah.

[18:41] The donkey calf over there is what built my cabs.

[18:44] And standing single leg off a box.

[18:49] Oh.

[18:50] Is he bodyweight?

[18:52] Yep.

[18:53] Yeah.

[18:54] I started doing, I did a few years ago.

[18:56] One of the things that like broke to my calf like growing.

[18:59] Sists my knees like, I don't train chest anything.

[19:02] It's what you thought last time because I just always had a decent enough child.

[19:05] Yeah.

[19:06] But like if someone doesn't want to grow a cabs, I can fucking tell you how to grow a cabs.

[19:09] The biggest thing was super deep curting out of this.

[19:12] But like super deep stretch.

[19:13] Yeah.

[19:14] And so what I would do is I do like 20 or 30 reps bodyweight on one leg off a box.

[19:18] Underneath of a pillow bar.

[19:20] And then once I reached failure, I would start counting.

[19:22] And so now would you assist at negatives?

[19:24] Yeah.

[19:25] Or like assisted positives.

[19:26] And like the level of pain that like of like pulling yourself to the full flex.

[19:31] Yeah.

[19:32] When you're just lower.

[19:33] Oh yeah.

[19:34] And then you like let it down.

[19:35] And you really make sure that you got that last little.

[19:37] Yeah.

[19:38] That last little bit.

[19:39] I was like, I did it with clients once.

[19:41] And because I just discovered this technique for myself.

[19:44] And I like it barely walk.

[19:45] And I did it with these ladies who I was training.

[19:47] They came in on suicide Friday.

[19:49] They came on a Monday.

[19:51] And they were like, they're like, couldn't.

[19:53] They're like, I couldn't go to the dance this weekend because I couldn't put heels on.

[19:57] They're like literally could not walk.

[19:59] Could like, and so I felt a conflict.

[20:02] You can jump all done.

[20:03] Yeah.

[20:04] I felt like I did something.

[20:05] Yeah.

[20:06] Fucking just like controlled negatives.

[20:08] Yeah.

[20:09] I such a secret to making anything grow.

[20:11] I'll do that.

[20:12] I was like, I'll go up with two feet.

[20:13] Yeah.

[20:14] And then lift one foot and then lower down.

[20:15] Like same concept.

[20:16] Yeah.

[20:17] And so I'm going to give you a cue that was trying to get your shoelaces perpendicular.

[20:20] Just like that.

[20:21] Yeah.

[20:22] Just because you're there, you're like perpendicular like, like it.

[20:25] You can't really do it, but like, maybe you're all around this can.

[20:28] But like, it's like, ah, ah.

[20:30] So how's being a dad?

[20:31] Did.

[20:32] That's good.

[20:33] It's chaos.

[20:34] It's good.

[20:35] It's chaos.

[20:36] It's after bodybuilding, right?

[20:37] It's so horrible for a lot of people to learn.

[20:38] But now we've got to help at night now, which is like,

[20:41] Oh, good.

[20:42] The biggest cheat code man, like my wife is the saint.

[20:44] So she handles like the hard part of all of that competing anymore.

[20:47] No.

[20:48] She stops in 2016.

[20:49] She can't really let me in 2016.

[20:51] And she can't have some health issues.

[20:53] And then just, with like, Mark, it's her champion breeding sock.

[20:56] Yeah.

[20:57] There.

[20:58] It's like she used to be.

[20:59] Lay it up.

[21:00] Got to let you pre-poutine for reps in an audience.

[21:02] I'm just kidding.

[21:03] I'm just putting it out there.

[21:04] Yeah.

[21:05] You get on this.

[21:06] Do one more.

[21:07] You're normal.

[21:08] I'm in a, my cats are getting already now.

[21:09] They're going to be too cut.

[21:10] Okay.

[21:11] Don't worry Daniel.

[21:12] I know you wanted the shot.

[21:13] There's the shot.

[21:14] So God, I'll give you a lefty.

[21:16] Or.

[21:17] You're gonna get out.

[21:19] Not anymore.

[21:20] I've 10 or 90s in my fucking toenail.

[21:23] The old man.

[21:24] Execute the old man.

[21:26] I'm gonna do the hip thing.

[21:28] Because I, that was the first time I've done licks in a while that I was not with no pain.

[21:32] Yeah.

[21:33] Because I, you do my warm-up to get to like a two out of ten pain and like whatever.

[21:36] Yeah.

[21:37] But that was like a one out of ten.

[21:39] Like I had some more.

[21:40] How many warm-ups that you normally do?

[21:42] Of the actual day.

[21:43] This recently started doing like three-hopper.

[21:45] Yes.

[21:46] And then I helped a lot.

[21:47] I was going straight.

[21:48] And I was like, this is for fuck.

[21:50] Yeah, that's brutal.

[21:51] I feel like it was like my muscles are just tearing off like you just know a four-volt.

[21:54] Yeah, no.

[21:55] There was like a lot of actual science behind even just your nervous system turning out with

[21:59] proper warm-up to them being.

[22:00] Your muscles are literally already even activating until then.

[22:02] Yeah.

[22:03] There we go.

[22:04] Yeah.

[22:05] But you're just like, what's going on?

[22:06] Yeah.

[22:07] Please don't do this.

[22:12] Nice.

[22:18] That's so cute.

[22:19] Oh, shit.

[22:20] It's so sweet.

[22:21] It's the best cap of Shimaru.

[22:23] It's good.

[22:24] This one's sweet because you can have the full stack.

[22:27] This is why I built this in the and standing single leg or the two things that like

[22:32] built my calves.

[22:33] But like this guy like all the way up.

[22:36] And just like, yeah.

[22:38] To make this.

[22:39] This is Nebula.

[22:40] Nebula?

[22:41] Yeah.

[22:42] What are you fun this?

[22:44] We're not only hard to fly.

[22:45] I said all these dealers that I have on speeddaw.

[22:48] They're like kind of serious.

[22:50] I don't know.

[22:51] I like the way this feels.

[22:52] And I feel really good.

[22:53] If you create these drafts you've been to over.

[22:55] Yeah.

[22:56] Yeah.

[22:57] It's one of those ones where when you put weight on it like feels even better.

[22:59] And I think you do 400 pounds of the M weights on top.

[23:01] I did when I was at my peak.

[23:03] And you were a big boy.

[23:04] Yeah, when I was a big boy.

[23:06] Yeah.

[23:07] Yeah.

[23:08] Yeah.

[23:09] I had this 100 pound plate that I had.

[23:11] But I haven't done calves any year.

[23:12] So we'll see.

[23:13] See what my calf strength is to it.

[23:15] Probably bad.

[23:16] I'm telling you I'm going to make a Machiavelli motivation video.

[23:27] You have to do this.

[23:35] Nice.

[23:36] Yep.

[23:37] Yeah.

[23:38] That's where I like smoke goes.

[23:40] Yeah.

[23:41] This also goes up to you.

[23:42] So you're going to just this.

[23:43] Yeah.

[23:44] So you can go up a little higher for it.

[23:45] Because that was on Layla's son.

[23:46] Go on.

[23:47] Good luck that.

[23:48] Yeah.

[23:49] I like, I mean, it's a big piece.

[23:51] But I try, I mean, I try it on this everyday for real.

[23:54] That in the single leg.

[23:55] Or the two things that I did for my calf.

[23:57] Did you have all the equipment somewhere else before you moved here?

[23:59] Yeah.

[24:00] My house in Austin.

[24:01] I had like half the.

[24:04] Everything.

[24:05] I had about half these pieces.

[24:06] Do you want to do something else?

[24:07] I'm my like zircuck.

[24:08] But I can do whatever.

[24:09] And with the champs.

[24:10] So I mean, we do a little quick, Clark's intention to go over there.

[24:14] All right.

[24:15] I'm not there.

[24:16] Cook.

[24:17] No, thank you, Clark.

[24:18] It's like zero rest back and forth.

[24:19] Mm.

[24:39] People are like, you're taller than I expected.

[24:46] So thanks.

[24:47] Because Trevor, you doctor, catch you.

[24:50] Anyway, anyways, no.

[24:51] He's like, you have short-eyed proportions.

[24:53] He's like so camera.

[24:54] He's like, you look like you're 55.

[24:56] Yeah.

[24:57] So much.

[24:58] My laser actually super short, which is good for like leg moves.

[25:02] Like I have super short femures.

[25:03] Really long torsion.

[25:04] Did they get this?

[25:05] Yeah.

[25:06] Did you pull through more?

[25:07] I'll see you more, conventional.

[25:08] Assume.

[25:09] Oh God.

[25:10] Let's go.

[25:11] I pull a conventional turn on my back and that's which is zoom on.

[25:14] I don't hurt my hips.

[25:15] Yeah.

[25:16] Yeah, I was a hundred pounds weaker on zoomer than conventional.

[25:22] I could do so much more volume on zoomer.

[25:24] Yeah.

[25:25] And so that kind of made up for it.

[25:27] But weirdly, my deadlift made its biggest gains.

[25:31] Dude, this isn't going to sound insane.

[25:33] Doing one set of 20 a week.

[25:34] Like you'd want to be a maxed-ed?

[25:37] Because I did the same.

[25:38] I did like the fucking pilot pin chart and you know like five three.

[25:43] What like I did all of the low rap like three sets of four.

[25:47] All the tradition and like my deadlift didn't move like three years.

[25:50] And I was like competing and like character.

[25:52] Yeah.

[25:53] I was like so upset about it.

[25:54] And so they didn't have like fuck it.

[25:56] And so, I don't know if you know, joggernaught.

[25:59] GTS, Chad, Wesley Smith.

[26:01] Okay.

[26:02] Well, he was the pilot of the world.

[26:03] Yeah.

[26:04] So he was, yeah, he was being the pilot thing.

[26:05] We're all like football training and stuff.

[26:07] And so yeah, this thing called the jog, jog method.

[26:09] This is like 10 years ago.

[26:10] And it was all this super high rap stuff.

[26:12] He basically took one layer five three one, which is a parallel thing.

[26:15] Quargram.

[26:16] And just like triple the boy.

[26:18] So this set of like sets of five three and one.

[26:20] It was sets of like 2015 cat.

[26:23] Yeah.

[26:24] But like, amrax.

[26:25] I basically ignored everything in the program.

[26:27] But the deadlift was like 20s.

[26:28] And I was like, well, I'll do that.

[26:29] I'll see how that goes.

[26:30] And I just, I just did sets of 20.

[26:33] And I added 10 pounds a week.

[26:35] And I did it for like 16 weeks.

[26:37] And it like 160 pounds in my 20 pet bed.

[26:41] And I was like, so do you want to have a max go up?

[26:43] Oh yeah.

[26:44] Why I mean, I'm guessing because I was close to my one right max on my 20.

[26:48] I expanded to yeah.

[26:49] Yeah.

[26:50] So hopefully.

[26:51] Yeah.

[26:52] So like the end of it I did like, I think I did.

[26:54] I have a video of doing like four.

[26:56] 65 for 20 Jesus.

[26:58] And then I was like, this is super.

[27:01] That's enough.

[27:02] Oh yeah.

[27:03] And this is when I was eating like the 6000 calories a day thing.

[27:05] The burritos.

[27:06] Oh, dude.

[27:07] I was like, you know, me, luscious one.

[27:08] You said like there's no system is overtraining on the under eating.

[27:11] And like, I will say as a natural guy who did that,

[27:14] I feel like I can kind of attest to it.

[27:16] Like I trained a lot of weight.

[27:18] Heldery 25.

[27:20] Yeah.

[27:21] I mean, I feel like when you're 25 and I do around there.

[27:23] You can do it every weekend.

[27:24] I could like, I live through that gym.

[27:25] I was a gym owner.

[27:26] I lived the gym.

[27:27] Yeah.

[27:28] And I trained.

[27:29] That was all I did.

[27:30] I did.

[27:31] It was eight hours of food and training.

[27:33] Yeah.

[27:34] I've decreased my lowening and increased my warmups.

[27:36] Everything morally.

[27:37] Proper and I'm just in more pain.

[27:39] I'm up to it.

[27:44] You said you do more warm-up less volume in your and more pain.

[27:47] Is that what you said?

[27:48] Yeah.

[27:49] That sounds right.

[27:50] Yeah.

[27:51] So that's what I was doing.

[27:52] I did the 20 reps that's for deadlift.

[27:54] And I was doing three sets of 20 on squat.

[27:58] And I got up to four or five for 20.

[28:00] One bar roll backswats with squatting.

[28:03] I was 235 natural.

[28:05] That's big.

[28:06] I mean, that's a fucking for natural.

[28:08] That's a lot of fucking around.

[28:10] And then I benched.

[28:13] So bench has been my biggest natural lift.

[28:15] Like built to bench every time I touch the bench it blows up.

[28:19] And so I don't bench, which is why I'm doing it.

[28:22] But for the six, I only did it for six weeks.

[28:24] But 35 pounds on natural.

[28:26] I have the pictures.

[28:27] Well, the 20 reps max were bench.

[28:29] So I hadn't benched him like a year or two.

[28:31] Yeah.

[28:32] But I did it for this little cycle.

[28:33] And so I was doing seven sets of everything.

[28:36] Seven sets of bench.

[28:37] Seven sets of not deadlift and squat.

[28:39] But seven sets of rows like press.

[28:42] It's been like press seven sets of 20.

[28:44] That's high-growth.

[28:45] I started it.

[28:46] It's 245.

[28:47] For seven sets of five.

[28:48] And six weeks later, I benched.

[28:50] Three ninety five for one.

[28:53] And I never like, I didn't put a, yeah, anything like that.

[28:57] I think the week of I did like three 35 for seven sets of five.

[29:03] Like six weeks, yeah.

[29:05] But I only had that in that one lift.

[29:09] And then I just knew that there are guys who had that in all their lifts.

[29:12] It's just like, that's my worst lift.

[29:14] So it's your band that is horrible bench.

[29:16] One rep max ever was four 15.

[29:19] You were probably body building benching.

[29:21] I was like powerlifting benching, which is six inches.

[29:26] So when you train, I mean, do you have programming that you follow?

[29:30] This year is the first year I had to ever follow in the program.

[29:33] I love that.

[29:34] Like that.

[29:35] Shouldn't for like, it's so kind of programming.

[29:39] I mean, you know in your field, there's an art to being good.

[29:44] Yeah.

[29:45] In view, it's, if you think you need to follow a perfect program.

[29:49] Yeah.

[29:50] If someone took everything, I did it.

[29:51] I was someone who took everything you didn't did it yet.

[29:53] You were following a plan instead of just doing naturally.

[29:55] And it wouldn't be here.

[29:56] Yeah, it's really interesting.

[29:58] Because the hardest thing to develop is intuition.

[30:01] It's like, how can, like, when you're like, I've got it today.

[30:04] I'm going to, I'm going to gas it.

[30:06] Like can someone teach you that?

[30:07] I don't know.

[30:08] I mean, I definitely know, like, for work, I have seasons where, like,

[30:12] I gas it.

[30:13] You know, everyone, like, I'm working 16 hours.

[30:17] I'm taking every single day I know.

[30:20] And like, and I'm like, not getting as much sleep as I should

[30:23] back in just keep pushing.

[30:24] Yeah.

[30:25] And then there's some days where I like wake up and I'm like,

[30:27] No, that's an answer there.

[30:29] Yeah.

[30:30] And so I was, I was putting on my, my profiles like,

[30:33] I don't have like, I work like weekdays weekends all the same.

[30:37] For me.

[30:38] So basically, I wake up and if I feel good, I work.

[30:42] And if I wake up and I feel like shit,

[30:44] I change the nature of the work I do.

[30:47] Yeah.

[30:48] Like, if I don't feel good, I'll play more meetings.

[30:51] I'll take more calls because I'm not,

[30:53] like, I'm not going to be doing deep work.

[30:55] Yeah.

[30:56] But if I wake up and I'm like,

[30:57] Dude, I keep your cancer today.

[30:59] They're like, all right, let me write a book chapter.

[31:01] Like, let me script out like a presentation or something that's, like,

[31:05] really deep.

[31:06] And I'll just tell this evening like,

[31:07] cancel some of my calls or move them.

[31:09] Like, I'm going to be in this end.

[31:10] Yeah.

[31:11] But I also imagine over time whether consciously sub-country,

[31:14] that like, when you wake up on those shitty days,

[31:16] doing certain things that you cannot least do,

[31:19] huh?

[31:20] At the break of past see,

[31:21] well, what you back into a place where you feel good to.

[31:23] Oh, yeah.

[31:24] Where are the most people are like,

[31:25] I'm going to take that out for them.

[31:26] Feel good. And then the next thing you know,

[31:27] it's been a year and they've taken a whole year off.

[31:29] What's up, Julio?

[31:30] I'm glad you came for likes because likes is what,

[31:34] like, I could push on our body, but like,

[31:36] I had the data. I was like,

[31:38] hmm, I want to ask someone to change legs to me and I was like,

[31:40] I fucking, I'm just right with you.

[31:42] Oh, I got the hot spot. Okay.

[31:45] You guys know, see, Bob? He's tired of it.

[31:47] I'm so, we had some of the drinks, the,

[31:49] see, Bob, Kinser, his, his, uh,

[31:51] I think you try, and then you get this probably even more than I do,

[31:54] but like, the generic, a big guy, like, hey,

[31:56] Jim's that way or whatever, I'm like, no matter what someone says,

[31:59] and, you know, half the time,

[32:01] it's some sort of, left hand and compliment or whatever.

[32:03] I just say, like, just trying to catch up to you, bro.

[32:05] And so, it doesn't matter what they still, like,

[32:07] I've had so many people who like,

[32:08] sit something mean and I'm like,

[32:10] just trying to catch up to you, bro.

[32:11] And then they're like, ah, bye.

[32:13] Yeah, I was being deaf, you know,

[32:15] and that's always been like, my big counter.

[32:18] Yeah, for some reason, I always get people like,

[32:20] are you like, that's you, I'm like,

[32:22] am I responsible to just, no, but I get that all the time.

[32:25] And then like, probably 50, 50,

[32:27] and time people like, oh, oh, and then I just walk away.

[32:30] That's it.

[32:31] I'm also equally awkward in anti-social,

[32:33] so someone comes up and like, do I know you from somewhere?

[32:35] I'm like, I don't know, probably not,

[32:37] and then I just leave,

[32:38] not from somewhere.

[32:40] So, with training wise, you just train my field

[32:42] and you just consistently add away when you can.

[32:44] I have a program now.

[32:45] Well, every year, but yeah, until now.

[32:47] I was pretty like consistent in what I would do,

[32:49] and we were moving this way.

[32:50] I just knew my brain.

[32:51] Yeah.

[32:52] And now like my top movements when I started

[32:53] if it's inclined chest, dumbbell press,

[32:55] it's if it's pendulum squat,

[32:56] if it's debent over rows.

[32:58] I'm like, glad you're doing it.

[32:59] You'd list much, so I'm gonna do this much this week.

[33:01] Yeah, yeah.

[33:02] And you just work to like,

[33:03] I'm gonna add 20 pounds, so it's 30 pounds right here.

[33:05] Yeah.

[33:06] So it was, for a while,

[33:07] it was like, I'm gonna do this for six,

[33:08] and then I get eight,

[33:09] and I got 10 of them.

[33:10] So it was 25 on that, and I'm back down to six,

[33:12] and then 10 of them.

[33:13] All the stuff that I know is like,

[33:15] stick to a handful of lifts.

[33:16] Don't do a lot of variations.

[33:18] Slowly, I'd progress it, you know, reps were weight, right?

[33:20] But then like, I just noticed

[33:22] that I had less motivation to train.

[33:24] And so like, I was more prone to skip days

[33:26] and things like that.

[33:27] And like, this was today was harder than I would normally train my legs.

[33:30] So I'll probably, like, it would probably fuck my,

[33:32] like, I'm supposed to train legs tomorrow.

[33:34] Yeah, massage was like, I'll struggle with this.

[33:36] I've been train legs tomorrow being pressed.

[33:37] Yeah.

[33:38] Yeah.

[33:39] So I'll just like, I'll skip bad,

[33:40] and maybe I'll skip a second.

[33:42] Like, because it's every other day.

[33:43] So I would have trained legs tomorrow and two days,

[33:45] so I'll probably just skip the next two,

[33:47] and then hit it again.

[33:48] You're like, if you don't have that flexibility,

[33:49] like, if you were in town,

[33:50] and like, oh, I'm falling, like,

[33:51] why bother?

[33:52] Like, give it to me.

[33:53] Like, I've had people.

[33:54] There's like three, you know,

[33:55] fitness dudes who have, you know,

[33:56] falling, sort of, they were in town.

[33:58] I saw this kid who's like, not a competitor.

[34:00] He's like, I'm falling a program,

[34:02] and so all the dudes who are lifting,

[34:03] all the big guys who are lifting together

[34:04] is throwing weights throughout,

[34:05] and he's like sitting in the instile and silent.

[34:07] Like, I'm falling, it's like, you're missing the point.

[34:10] Yeah.

[34:11] Like, you're not going to get to be like 40

[34:13] and be like, man, really glad I followed that progress

[34:15] for us, 22, and, you know,

[34:17] training with those guys,

[34:18] and then going home,

[34:19] you can fire it up about training with them.

[34:20] Well, we're always told to,

[34:21] you're less going up more, too.

[34:22] Right.

[34:23] The motivation to get up, and that will be more.

[34:24] Oh, so much more, yeah.

[34:25] Yeah.

[34:26] And in the memory, like,

[34:27] all the positive experience that come from

[34:28] at the newest New Music when you train?

[34:29] Yeah.

[34:30] What do you listen to?

[34:31] Yeah, there is.

[34:32] I'll turn to Brock.

[34:33] Yeah.

[34:34] I'm going to have Kanye West,

[34:35] 90s hip-hop.

[34:36] Yeah.

[34:37] I have this more or less the same stuff.

[34:38] I'm not a music person.

[34:39] See, the only time I listen to music is when I train.

[34:41] Yeah.

[34:42] And so, I like, so bad that a front of my from high school

[34:45] gave me this CD, it was rap CD 1 through 6.

[34:48] And I uploaded it on my iPod.

[34:50] And then, like, I went through all of college,

[34:52] and then we were hanging out a couple years later.

[34:54] It's like, so what do you listen to now on your train?

[34:56] I was like, the music that you made me,

[34:58] and you was like, what?

[35:00] And I was like, yeah, the only made me is like, in high school.

[35:02] That was like, yeah, rap CD 3 through 1 through 6.

[35:05] I still listen to, he's like, dear God.

[35:06] He's like, yeah, there's been things that have had.

[35:08] He's like, am I going to say two CD's in this thing?

[35:10] No, no, no, no.

[35:11] I'll make you a new mix and to Spotify.

[35:13] You just love an iPod.

[35:14] Yeah.

[35:15] Yeah.

[35:16] I'm going to do it.

[35:17] Yeah.

[35:18] I'm not even able to get weird because now I'm turning 35 in like a couple months.

[35:23] In August.

[35:24] And I was like, I am like, like, when I,

[35:27] before I turned 30, I was like, young and successful.

[35:30] Yeah.

[35:31] I'm just a white dude.

[35:32] Yeah.

[35:33] I thought that too.

[35:35] I was like, holy shit, you're only 25 and you won the Olympia.

[35:37] Yeah.

[35:38] And I was like, right, you're the old guy now.

[35:39] Yeah, so you're just, yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's just a guy.

[35:42] Yeah.

[35:43] Which is interesting with, like, with the Olympia in terms of like competitive landscape and whatnot,

[35:47] it's like, in the game of business, everyone is a competitor.

[35:50] Like, everyone's in the game.

[35:51] It's just some people don't know it.

[35:52] And that's what I find kind of interesting about like the business world.

[35:55] It's like, you can be against the world and it's global.

[35:58] Yeah.

[35:59] And you can be against guys that are 90.

[36:00] And like, like, like, you can't age out how old you can do, Janet.

[36:05] She became the youngest self-made billionaire and then they revoked it.

[36:10] They did.

[36:11] Like, as she wasn't actually here.

[36:12] Yeah, the numbers weren't what she overstated some of her numbers.

[36:16] Like, nine months later, after she got an all of the PR, after I,

[36:20] I got into a deep, seven-day depression because of how inadequate I felt.

[36:24] As a result of compared to this little way, girl.

[36:27] Yeah.

[36:28] And it was actually like, it was actually a weird late.

[36:30] It was a, it was a career defining moment for me.

[36:33] Really?

[36:34] It sounds ridiculous to say.

[36:35] When I saw her on the cover of Forbes, the 19 years old as a billionaire,

[36:38] I felt like it's earlier.

[36:39] I did.

[36:40] Yeah.

[36:41] I was, I was 20, I think of 26 or 27, and more or less.

[36:44] And I, I take it home, 17 million dollars an income that year.

[36:47] And I was like, I'm potting.

[36:49] I said, I'm cool.

[36:51] And then it was just like, 19 year old girl, billionaire.

[36:56] That's just like, I suck.

[36:58] And everything.

[36:59] And that was actually the moment where I was like,

[37:01] She understood, so I fundamentally think that if someone makes more money than me,

[37:04] then they know something about business that I don't.

[37:06] She was the one that got me on to brand.

[37:08] Was that she was able to make work, right?

[37:10] Then maybe because she had a brand.

[37:11] And I was like, maybe there's something to this.

[37:13] And I also encourage you a philosophy that I can pair to other people that.

[37:16] What top?

[37:17] I think it's a feeling against yourself.

[37:19] No, yeah.

[37:20] So there's a really good one there.

[37:21] Is that there's a difference between criticism and insults.

[37:25] So if you insult yourself and you make a judgment,

[37:28] if you criticize, you just point out a discrepancy.

[37:30] So she's bigger than I am in this way.

[37:32] Why?

[37:33] That's criticism.

[37:34] Like, I could do better.

[37:35] Judgment is, and because of that, you are bad.

[37:37] Yeah.

[37:38] All right.

[37:39] Be easy, my friend.

[37:40] This way.

[37:41] Appreciate you.

[37:42] Good.

[37:43] Good.

[37:44] Appreciate you.

[37:45] Good.

[37:46] Have a wonderful day, guys.

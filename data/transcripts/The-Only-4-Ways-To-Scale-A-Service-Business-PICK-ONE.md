[00:00] Most in Asian, the other day I was approached by a service-based brick and mortar business,

[00:03] and they have a very profitable single-ocation model, and they wanted to figure out a way

[00:09] or what path was going to be the best vehicle for them to make the most money.

[00:13] And so we had a really good conversation about this and they broke down the different paths to

[00:17] take a take, and for them it was really valuable and they were very happy about it.

[00:20] And so what I wanted to do was break down this exact same process for you.

[00:24] So if you have a service-based business or something where you have labor of some sort

[00:28] that you rent out at a profit to other people to provide value,

[00:33] then this video is for you. And if you want to figure out a way to package those services in a way that

[00:38] is that has a lot of enterprise value that has a lot of cash flow while you're growing,

[00:43] then this video is for you. So I'm going to break down the only four ways that I know of,

[00:48] they can package your service and the labor and knowledge that you have into a profitable business.

[00:54] Now, some of these have pros in terms they provide more cash flow via margin or lower operational

[00:58] drag. Others provide more enterprise value but a little bit more difficult to create.

[01:02] So I'm going to show you the pros and cons of each of them. I have businesses, I own businesses

[01:05] that have three in three of these four categories. So I feel like I can speak to these with a decent

[01:10] amount of knowledge and not with a bias towards one or the other. So the first is a privately held chain.

[01:17] So I'll put private chain. Everyone, keep your PG hats on. So a private chain is basically like

[01:22] you have one location and then you open a second and a third. And the specific business I was

[01:26] talking to was a person who had a salon concept. So they had a concept around here and it was doing

[01:31] very well and they were like, man, we're thinking about opening more locations and we're going to

[01:35] figure out the best way to do this or ultimately make money with this model. So the first is just you

[01:40] open another location, another location, another location you return, you retain all the ownership rights,

[01:45] you take all the risk, you front all the capital, you hire all the labor, you control the brand,

[01:49] but you own everything and to end. So this is a privately held chain. This is the first of the

[01:55] four vehicles that you can use to ultimately build your wealth. At the end, I'll show you the

[02:00] pros and cons of each of them. The second, some of you may be familiar with, hopefully, you've

[02:03] definitely frequented one of these businesses. This is a franchise to have subway, McDonald's,

[02:08] you know, Jiffy Lou, all of these are franchises. They are a single model that has been franchiseed

[02:14] out, people buy in investor specifically. So this is a different person here, an investor who's

[02:19] outside, you just want to find a good return of capital, will buy into a franchise model and typically

[02:23] because franchises have far lower failure rates than starting your own business. And so that's the

[02:29] advantage of this is that in theory, there's lower risk. Now, I could talk about the actual body

[02:33] behind that, which is very different. I could also tell you about the tons and tons and tons of

[02:37] franchises don't actually make money. I think it's like 90% or 95% of franchises never get past

[02:43] 100 locations, which candidly, if you're doing a franchise model, you need to get past 100

[02:46] to make any real money. And you're like, how is that even possible? I'll break it down in a second.

[02:50] All right, so that is the second vehicle that you can use in a service-based business to make a fortune.

[02:55] Now, number three, number three is a licensing model. And I'll tell you some of the pros of this one.

[03:00] A licensing model, you might not be asked familiar with the businesses that you've licensing because

[03:04] depending on how they structure the license, you have to differentiate from what a franchise is.

[03:09] A franchise has three components. You have name, business systems, and fee. All right, so if you have

[03:14] all three of those things and people are using your brand, your business systems and your fee,

[03:19] then you are a franchise. And if you're operating those a license and you're using those three components,

[03:22] then you are an illegal franchise. All right, that you can get tech, you can get find, and you can

[03:27] shut down, and all that kind of stuff to paint the butt. I'll talk about the pros and cons of licensing

[03:30] in a second, but that is the third vehicle. All right, so in a licensing vehicle, you're typically

[03:33] going to have two of those three things. So you could have, for example, CrossFit is a licensing,

[03:38] right, they give you the name, and they have a fee, but they don't have business systems. A different

[03:42] version would be, let's say you had a model that worked really well, you license all the stuff,

[03:47] but it's white labeled. All right, so you have a fee, and you have business systems, but you don't have

[03:51] a name or a brand that they have to adhere to. All right, that would be a licensing model. So there's

[03:55] different versions of this, but that is essentially a third way that you could package your existing

[04:00] knowledge or IP in a way that scales to multiple locations and ultimately make an enterprise that is

[04:06] very valuable. The fourth, and it's felt worth mentioning, is software. And I bring this up because

[04:12] it depends on the type of service you offer. Now, if you're cutting here, you probably can't

[04:15] replace it with software, right? But if you are providing some sort of service that software can do,

[04:21] then this would be software slash, a tech enabled service. All right, hopefully you can read that.

[04:25] Tech enabled service. All right, so I'd say number four is either of those. For most people who

[04:30] have a service-based business, it will probably be one through three, and the reason I bring that

[04:33] up is because if you're not already really good at software and have a software co-founder

[04:38] who knows how to code, knows user experience, knows how to build engineering teams,

[04:41] if you don't have someone like that, do not try and outsource it to a third-party team. I promise you,

[04:46] it will probably not work. All right, now you promise you more. All right, just please, just

[04:51] $2 million, $3 million of development later. I've made the mistakes. Let me give you a $3 million

[04:56] gift. Don't do it. I told you that I have three of these for. And so let's go through the advantages

[05:00] of disadvantages that I walk through with this particular business. All right, so a private chain

[05:05] is going to have the highest costs of opening each location. So there's incremental costs. Every

[05:10] new location you have to do the build out, you have to go shape, you have to find the location,

[05:13] you have to go shape the least as you have to, you have to build everything out, and then you have

[05:17] the risk of the least for the duration of the time. On top of that, you have to staff it, you control the

[05:21] employees, et cetera. Now, when is a private chain, something that is worthwhile? So I would say,

[05:27] I'm looking at too many things where a private chain would be worth considering. First is that they have

[05:32] low costs of build out, right? So if it doesn't cost a lot of money to build a new location,

[05:37] so let's say if it costs less than 40,000, you know, 40,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,

[05:40] now that's an absolute number, but relative to the income that it generates, let's say it generates

[05:44] 400,000 year in profit. If it costs you, I should probably put a percentage on this. But I would say

[05:48] if it costs you less than six months worth of profit in the first year to open it in location,

[05:53] then it would be, it would make sense to open a private chain. So in a great example, if this would be in

[05:57] Somnia cookies, all right, they these tiny little locations, they just had, I think they were like

[06:01] 800 square feet on average. They're tiny, they just have to put an oven in there and a front window,

[06:05] and they have lots of delivery. And for them, they had tons of margin because it was cookies,

[06:08] they were selling flour and sugar for big margins, and the amount that a location could make,

[06:12] it was tremendous compared to the cost. All right, and so here, it's very low-d build,

[06:17] very high profit, and so it's worth owning the entire thing. All right, that's a private chain. So

[06:21] some of the biggest brands in the world start as private chains, and then they go direct to consumer.

[06:25] So Chanel, Louis Vuitton, and Kristen Dior, you know, I mean, all of these are brands that had

[06:30] brick and mortar locations, they owned everything because the amount to build out a store compared to the

[06:33] amount of profit that it made was almost nothing. Now that is a product business on a service business,

[06:37] but I'm still at least explaining the point. The third piece is that it's low-service requirements.

[06:42] So the more specialized you are in terms of the types of skills that are required to do the business

[06:47] or provide the value, the more difficult it is to scale in a private setting. All right, and that is

[06:52] because it is inconsistency of service will be a problem. So if you're very good at your thing and you have

[06:57] your location and it works well, if you are required to make that level of value, provided to the

[07:03] end consumer, that it's not going to be a scalable model. All right, the reason that subway, for example,

[07:07] works is because anybody can make a sandwich that tastes the same way if you use the same recipes

[07:12] and use the same process. Right. Now, if you can productize your service in such a way that you minimize

[07:16] the variability and you can decrease the skill requirements of the labor that is required to work that

[07:20] system, then you have a very scalable model which is the goal. So private chain. So for example,

[07:27] for us to decide not, we have one of our businesses that is a private chain and they were actually

[07:31] they were in a licensing model, right, and one of the came in is acquisition.com for full-time company.

[07:36] I actually moved them over here because candidly, their licensees were making so much money using

[07:40] their system and it costs so little to open new locations that I was like, we should just be

[07:44] owning all this revenue. It's not worth just giving all the revenue away and giving all the

[07:48] trades he could's right. And so we transition the business over and in the last 14 months to get from

[07:53] a half a million dollar your business to a $12 million or your business. Pretty cool, right. So that is

[07:59] number one. The second is franchise, right. So pros and cons of franchises, cons very, very little

[08:05] to just very expensive to start. Usually, costs about $750,000 to start a franchise just in terms of

[08:11] the set-up fees and legal and and filings and all that kind of stuff that you have to do.

[08:15] In order, and that's just if that's just to get started, that's not even to get it going.

[08:18] And to really build a franchise the right way, most times it takes one to two years to really

[08:22] start seeing profits because you'll sell locations. But the cost of selling franchisees that franchise

[08:28] upfront fee will typically only cover the cost of acquisition. All right. So what it costs you

[08:34] to get franchise leads from franchise brokers, people who want to buy investments, it'll usually

[08:39] cost you almost the entire upfront fee, which is usually about 50 grand for many franchises.

[08:43] And so you're only going to make money once they open off of royalties from top line. All right.

[08:48] So it's a very slow model. But the enterprise value of franchise extremely high. So enterprise

[08:53] value, the EV on both of these is very good. All right. For private chain and franchise, both of them are

[08:58] very good. But the franchise multiple only comes off of the corporate franchise revenue because

[09:03] technically you're selling LLCs to other people. So other people are the owners of the vast majority

[09:08] of the profit of the business. Right. And so you're only making your money off of the royalties

[09:12] that are coming in. And then you still have all of your costs of running your actual franchise,

[09:16] helping the franchise easy to succeed, et cetera. Now, when you would start a franchise, it would be

[09:20] something where you have very, very high build up costs. Right. If a new location costs a ton of

[09:25] money like McDonald's, right, costs whatever million bucks to open McDonald's, that's a lot of capital.

[09:30] Right. And so you would want to give, you want to give that risk that capital risk to other people.

[09:35] You basically crowd source for lack of a return. The ownership of these new locations,

[09:39] and then you take a piece off the top. And I'm McDonald's obviously in the real estate too,

[09:42] because they're very smart cookies. That is the franchise model in a nutshell. Right. You're running

[09:47] on a very small percentage of top line. And you have to have lots and lots of locations. And if you

[09:51] guys want to rule of thumb, you usually need to have a hundred plus locations for a franchise

[09:56] really to make sense. And here's a fun fact for you. 90 to 95% of franchises don't hit over 100

[10:02] locations. All right. So as much as people have service based business and think that the

[10:05] ultimate goal is to build a franchise. So that someday they could franchise their business.

[10:09] The franchise is not the end goal. It is the beginning of the next journey. All right. You have not yet succeeded.

[10:14] You might impress your parents and your friends, but you will not impress your bank accounts

[10:17] or the players in the game who really understand how it works. All right. So number one, private chain.

[10:21] Number two, franchise opportunity. Number three, licensing. All right. The advantage here is that it,

[10:28] it's the lowest cost. So almost no cost to license out of model. Typically, you have super high margins,

[10:33] just like franchising does. The margins are high in franchising. It just costs a lot to start.

[10:37] So high margins. Now the problems with this is that it's not that defensible. It's very hard to

[10:43] defend. And there's very little enterprise value. So very low multiples when you sell,

[10:49] unless you have a ridiculously sticky licensing agreement. All right. So for you for an idea if anyone's

[10:54] curious, you would want to have 80% plus yearly retention on licensees for you to get a real,

[11:02] really attractive exit multiple. So we're talking six plus multiple on the exit. All right. And so

[11:09] now the advantage of licensing is that it doesn't cost you any money. It's very high cash flow

[11:13] throughout the process. And you can pretty much make money day one. And so when you're new or sometimes licensing

[11:17] makes the most sense. So Jim launch, that business is a licensing business. And it was my first business.

[11:23] I didn't have tons of money to get it going. And I wanted to start generating cash flow sooner.

[11:28] And so that was why I did that. The business that we have, I won't sure what it is because we

[11:33] try not to give people a copy of what we're doing. But in one of our niches, I think as I said earlier,

[11:39] we went from having a licensing model to owning a ton of locations right now. We have 12 locations.

[11:44] And we open a new location every month. It's pretty cool. Number four, software. So if you have a

[11:49] way, and this requires a ton of cost to build, lots of time, very low cash flow. You're like,

[11:54] why would I do software? It's because the enterprise value on the exit is usually the highest.

[11:59] But again, everyone likes to hear that. Oh, I heard you can exit software for a ton.

[12:03] Yeah, but the same requirement of turn is still 80% or higher yearly retention, right? And the

[12:10] higher you make that retention. It's got to be above 80% or no one's even going to consider you

[12:13] a software. They're just going to consider you a normal service that just has some tech element to it.

[12:18] And so each of these has pros and cons. And so if you're thinking about scaling your service

[12:23] based business, I'll think of which of these four buckets do you fit in and which of these strategies

[12:28] makes the most sense for you. All right. And so this is how I look at service based businesses.

[12:32] If I'm going to come in as an investor and I want to help them scale or triple or or or five

[12:37] x and you know, five year period, I'm going to say which of these vehicles is going to make

[12:41] most sense for the IP and the value that we're providing based on the model that exists,

[12:46] the cash flow that I require, the amount of upfront investment, the time to go and a lot of

[12:50] times just the appetite risk of the entrepreneur and how unbilt and how structurally sound

[12:56] the return is on the model. So if we know beyond a shout of a doubt that when we enter a market

[13:00] and freaking murder it and it costs us not a lot of money to open it, then we're going to own the

[13:04] whole thing privately. Now same thing, if we know we're going to kill it, but it costs a million

[13:07] bucks to open a location, then we might franchise, right? And if it costs no money, right? And we

[13:13] don't think that it's a really protectable IP, right? Let's say it's a more off-rebase to business,

[13:17] like Jim Lynch, for example, in the beginning was very off-redriven business.

[13:20] Offers very easy to copy, right? And so it was how quickly can we take as much market

[13:24] tourism as we possibly can? So for licensing it's speed, right? You can absolutely outpace anyone

[13:29] else in the market on speed and you make lots of cash flow, but you're going to sacrifice a lot

[13:33] of money on the exit, right? And so with licensing you make money throughout the process,

[13:38] rather than having a big lump at the end. And probably the exact opposite would that

[13:41] be like a software type thing. So if you take the time to develop the software, you put the cash

[13:45] up front to develop it, you figure out a way to do it, and then ultimately figure out a way to make it

[13:49] as valuable as you have to achieve this 80% or higher yearly retention on the customers that you

[13:55] are selling, or it will not be valuable at all, and it will be valued like the other ones except

[13:59] you just wasted a bunch of money in time. So I hope this provided value for you if you're thinking

[14:03] about how to ultimately create your enterprise in a way that has the most value, then I would think

[14:07] through each of these four different vehicles as monetization structures for the opportunity.

[14:12] Alright, so lots of most ination if you don't know who I am, I'm an intellectualmoseymaneposition.com,

[14:16] I'll put full it as about $85 million a year in revenue. So if you like this hit subscribe,

[14:20] and if you did, I love you either way. I'll catch you guys in the next video. Bye!

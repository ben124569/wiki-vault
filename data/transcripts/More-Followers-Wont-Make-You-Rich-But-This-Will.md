## Full Transcript
[00:00] I have zero desire to become famous for the sick thing.

[00:02] Things like none.

[00:03] There's actually just a lot of costs with that.

[00:05] What I wanted was business owners.

[00:07] And so we tested out actually the last 90 days,

[00:10] so leading them to two weeks ago,

[00:11] I made almost exclusively very wide content.

[00:14] So it was like relationships stuff,

[00:16] we made fitness stuff, like food, food video,

[00:20] we made advice to my younger self, things like that.

[00:24] And so we got more overall views,

[00:26] but in terms of throughput from those views

[00:29] to high quality, like applications into the business,

[00:32] or just even book sales, which I use as a kind of a

[00:34] loose-term metric for quality of eyeballs, went way down.

[00:39] And so we have completely, like so one of the big shifts I'm doing

[00:43] is I'm basically making almost exclusively business content now.

[00:46] So I mean, like I have no marriage to anything.

[00:48] Like if relationship videos is what we generated

[00:52] in the most business, I'm just going to say there's this theory

[00:55] in the content world that, like so there's two theories

[00:59] that I at least the data that we looked at,

[01:01] just completely didn't agree with, which was one is that

[01:04] shirts viewers become long viewers, and I just haven't seen that.

[01:07] Like I hear it all the time, but when I looked at it,

[01:10] that just wasn't the case.

[01:11] People who watch longs, want more longs,

[01:12] people want shorts, watch more shorts.

[01:14] Cavia, if you find me in shorts in one platform,

[01:18] but you're a YouTube's longs viewer,

[01:20] then you might watch my YouTube long-fut content.

[01:24] And so, but if you only watch YouTube shorts,

[01:26] you're not going to become a longs viewer.

[01:28] You will just keep watching whatever you normally can seem.

[01:30] So people have consumption preferences by platform.

[01:32] And so I kind of see them as, they're like in separate tracks

[01:36] in terms of bringing people in.

[01:38] For the CTA, like the gift to ask ratio, right?

[01:44] As soon as you start running ads, in my opinion,

[01:47] everything becomes gives, and then the ads do all the asking for you,

[01:50] which will help you out as a content creator.

[01:52] Because then it's like, I'm just trying to push as much values

[01:55] as I possibly can.

[01:56] In shorts, I do zero CTAs, stories.

[02:01] I do think is appropriate for CTAs.

[02:02] I don't think it hurts your reach.

[02:04] And so if you do one or two of those a week,

[02:06] I don't think that's going to hurt anything.

[02:09] Longs, I see as somewhat different in that.

[02:13] It depends on the CTA.

[02:15] And so if I was like, I see me providing free stuff

[02:19] as also gives.

[02:21] And so me having a CTA for free stuff,

[02:23] I don't see as a take from the audience.

[02:26] And so the reason that I have the books, for example,

[02:28] that are free on the site and free on my podcast and whatnot

[02:32] is so that it's like it's free.

[02:34] You can have it if you want to.

[02:35] And if there's alternative formats where they can do it,

[02:38] like for a fee, then that's because of their consumption

[02:40] preference.

[02:41] But if you're broke, then use whatever.

[02:43] And so the TLDR of this is that,

[02:46] I think you can absolutely have CTAs in content

[02:49] that drive to stuff that's, as long as it's relevant,

[02:51] and how you integrate it, I think it actually works fine.

[02:54] So like my number one YouTube video across my whole channel

[02:57] has a 14 minute CTA at the end.

[02:59] Mm-hmm.

[03:01] Number one video.

[03:02] What would you define as your CTA,

[03:04] though?

[03:05] Because I think CTA, something about this reception

[03:07] that I was like, go do this now, click my link.

[03:09] But what is, what does a CTA mean for you?

[03:12] So I say, if you're a business owner

[03:15] who's trying to scale, I've got books and courses

[03:17] that you can check at access.com.

[03:19] If you're someone who's trying to start a business

[03:20] or get started, I put all these resources together

[03:23] for you and you can start, you know,

[03:24] you start on school.

[03:25] And so I just do that.

[03:27] So you just point them towards your free stuff,

[03:29] not even just to buy.

[03:31] Yeah.

[03:31] Just from my organic.

[03:32] Now, ads then turn around and just scoop.

[03:36] So like, I mean, all ads are CTAs.

[03:39] So like, that's, so I basically, you chunk up a level

[03:43] and then you think about the give-ask ratio

[03:44] across everything people see.

[03:47] And so ads now take up a percentage

[03:48] of what people are going to see in the marketplace

[03:50] and so I have to compensate for that ask with give.

[03:55] So that makes sense.

[03:56] Now the gives that I have, I still have CTAs for free stuff

[03:58] so they can still, you know, join the email list

[04:00] and they still might buy books or whatever it is.

[04:02] But that's been the evolution of,

[04:05] now that we run ads with school all the way,

[04:06] so I have to compensate for that.

[04:09] You've seen almost these ads, right?

[04:11] Yeah.

[04:12] You want to win $1,000?

[04:14] I'm giving it to you for free.

[04:16] Yeah.

[04:17] I want to balance it all the way.

[04:18] That's how they go.

[04:19] Oh, right?

[04:20] Like you, you've engaged with something of homozy

[04:23] to the ads follow.

[04:25] Yeah.

[04:26] Yeah.

[04:26] So I see the purpose of organic

[04:28] as getting free, free facial recognition.

[04:31] And ideally, like at the coldest edges of this,

[04:34] it's how many people recognize my face.

[04:36] That in and of itself is going to create

[04:38] higher CTR's higher conversion rates

[04:39] and at higher prices.

[04:41] One level underneath of that is people

[04:42] who recognize my face and have gotten

[04:44] some sort of positive experience with the content

[04:45] that I had.

[04:46] Even if it's just one video, they're like,

[04:47] you know, I did like that video that I made.

[04:49] Cool.

[04:49] Like the next levels, like they also know my name.

[04:52] You know what I mean?

[04:53] And then believe that is like,

[04:54] oh, I watch a lot of his stuff,

[04:55] like all the time in a regular viewer, right?

[04:57] So there's these circles of awareness.

[04:59] And so the purpose of content as I see it is to like,

[05:01] shorts absolutely have ROI,

[05:03] just way more with ads than they do with like trying

[05:07] to take a short and then like provide value

[05:09] and have CTA really tough.

[05:12] Yeah, really really tough.

[05:12] And so I don't even do it.

[05:14] Because I think when you can't,

[05:15] I don't even mention the community.

[05:17] I don't know my in my shorts.

[05:18] I'll just like talk about a relevant subject in that's involved

[05:21] in the community.

[05:22] And then I'll be like a meals video.

[05:23] I do a grocery all if you want recipes for these meals

[05:25] and like the last three seconds.

[05:27] It's only 5% of the people who watch the video

[05:29] the way through get to there.

[05:30] But the conversion is still pretty good.

[05:32] I meet personally just because like this is how I think

[05:35] I put it in the description and I put it as like

[05:37] first comment and I have it in profile.

[05:40] And so I kind of see it as like,

[05:41] if someone wants to take the next step,

[05:42] they'll immediately be able to do that.

[05:45] And that way, like I might get 10 times the views

[05:47] by not having three or four more seconds

[05:49] where people wanna dip.

[05:51] So that makes sense?

[05:52] So that's the trade that I make

[05:53] in terms of short content.

[05:55] In terms of what we do on Instagram,

[05:57] we just do Reels right now for the most part

[06:00] because they just get the most views

[06:01] in terms of new audience.

[06:03] I do see like a picture on Instagram as like an email now.

[06:07] So if you've ever seen it like,

[06:09] you'll get way more likes and way more like

[06:12] and you'll almost like, at least for me,

[06:13] I get like guaranteed reach, but it goes to no one knew.

[06:17] And so it's like if there's a picture of me

[06:19] or doing something whatever or carousel,

[06:22] I basically almost like guaranteed way higher reach

[06:25] just within people who know who I am.

[06:28] And so I think those are like,

[06:29] you market with the Reels and what the platform is saying,

[06:32] like this is what we're gonna show to new people right now.

[06:34] But then I make you could make your kind of like CTAs

[06:36] with the images.

[06:38] So make sense.

[06:39] So it's like nurturing through the pictures

[06:41] more nurture your audience.

[06:42] And exactly what you do.

[06:44] Your tweets as Reels, like,

[06:47] that's not that bad.

[06:48] Yeah.

[06:49] Yeah.

[06:49] They bang too.

[06:50] They really good.

[06:51] Yeah, they crush.

[06:52] Yeah.

[06:53] Super high leverage.

[06:54] One thing we've seen a lot of,

[06:55] by the success with,

[06:56] are organic CTAs.

[06:58] Like if you have to do again,

[06:59] if you can't run, they'd have to,

[07:00] but you also will CTAs to make money.

[07:03] Isn't set of offering more.

[07:05] Like instead of,

[07:05] here's this one recipe,

[07:06] if you want more,

[07:07] go to my school group, offer custom.

[07:09] So like I came at custom recipes

[07:11] based on your macros,

[07:13] because like if you're on organic,

[07:15] there's an infinite amount of more concept.

[07:16] Like they just keep scrolling.

[07:18] Really good.

[07:19] To get custom, they have to go through,

[07:21] good.

[07:22] And if you offer like,

[07:23] one on one coaching and a group coaching order,

[07:25] like that's their option to get customer school.

[07:28] Because you over,

[07:29] the more is over you.

[07:30] So like everyone says you will get more.

[07:31] Yeah.

[07:33] Really good.

[07:34] How do you give something custom into Asian men,

[07:37] but if you really want to skydive,

[07:38] but like thousand and ploth men does.

[07:40] So you can do your course for some longer.

[07:42] So you can do your course for some longer.

[07:44] So you can do your course for some longer.

[07:46] So you can do your course for some longer.

[07:49] So you can do your course for some longer.

[07:50] So you can do your course for some longer.

[07:53] So you can do your course for some longer.

[07:55] So you can do your course for some longer.

[07:57] So you can do your course for some longer.

[07:59] So you can do your course for some longer.

[08:01] So you can do your course for some longer.

[08:04] So you can do your course for some longer.

[08:06] So you can do your course for some longer.

[08:07] So you can do your course for some longer.

[08:09] So you can do your course for some longer.

[08:12] So you can do your course for some longer.

[08:14] So you can do your course for some longer.

[08:16] So you can do your course for some longer.

[08:18] So you can do your course for some longer.

[08:20] So you can do your course for some longer.

[08:28] So you can do your course for some longer.

[08:30] So you can do your course for some longer.

[08:32] So you can do your course for some longer.

[08:33] So you can do your course for some longer.

[08:35] So you can do your course for some longer.

[08:36] So you can do your course for some longer.

[08:37] So you can do your course for some longer.

[08:38] So and then business owners also have relation.

[08:41] Like it's too many steps to get the right people.

[08:43] Because it's really just people who consume

[08:44] relationships stuff.

[08:46] Just more and more relationships stuff,

[08:48] which I have no desire to bring.

[08:49] The thing is what I struggle with the most of them

[08:51] is the M1 here probably doesn't cube gone through.

[08:53] It's like, that first kind of step to start when you,

[08:56] like who am I?

[08:57] Who's this guy?

[08:58] Why is he talking to me?

[08:59] Like so when you click on a profile that has zero

[09:02] followers and zero views, like is it just the

[09:05] content that you're saying the words,

[09:06] you need to carry your profile.

[09:07] And that's the only thing that's going to build that trust

[09:09] with you and the client to get them over to fill out

[09:12] a form of your evidence.

[09:13] Just so how do you, sorry, how do you use

[09:16] something that has business experience

[09:18] a background with results to then showcase that

[09:21] to get them back?

[09:21] You use that in the profile to verify who you are.

[09:24] It doesn't come across the area.

[09:25] And like.

[09:26] So there's, I mean, there's a different like,

[09:30] one of our big marketing laws, my team can tell you

[09:32] is state the facts and tell the truth.

[09:34] Just like it's just like that's the big bold thing.

[09:36] And underneath of that, it's say what no one else can say.

[09:38] And show it no one else can show from a marketing perspective.

[09:41] And I do that in ads.

[09:42] I do that in content.

[09:43] It's like state the facts and tell the truth.

[09:46] Say what no one else can say.

[09:48] Show it no one else can show it.

[09:50] Because there's always things that you have

[09:51] you need to your brand that only you can show.

[09:53] A lot of people just don't show it.

[09:55] And there's things that you can say that no one else

[09:58] is saying.

[09:59] So your unique, unique setting proposition.

[10:02] No, not even.

[10:03] This is just for just for proving who I am.

[10:06] So it's like, even when I had like, to your point,

[10:10] like, how's it?

[10:11] Like you see me now, but like when I started

[10:12] in the gym space, I was a very, very small fish.

[10:15] And there was like various,

[10:16] that was players who were like,

[10:17] gym groups were all older than me,

[10:19] who all like were just older than me.

[10:21] Just put it out there.

[10:23] Right, they're all way older.

[10:24] And so I just had to overcomposate

[10:26] by just being so much better than they were

[10:28] in terms of the content that I was putting out.

[10:30] And I was like, this is a model that everyone's teaching.

[10:32] Here's my model.

[10:33] Mine makes more money.

[10:35] I was like, it doesn't matter if he's been here forever.

[10:37] I was like, these gyms, I'll compete these gyms.

[10:40] And so I feel like the only thing that I've gotten

[10:42] is I feel like this platform,

[10:44] like just has this massive opportunity

[10:47] for business as agencies like Wifters and Pomey.

[10:49] But I feel like no one else is doing that.

[10:51] So now I finally have something

[10:52] that I feel like could bring to social media

[10:54] to showcase to be able to, I did this for myself

[10:56] with no following, you can't bring that forward.

[10:59] Yeah, I mean, you put the proof.

[11:01] So as far as I'm concerned, the content serves the audience

[11:04] as the give.

[11:05] If they're curious for more, they will then click your profile,

[11:08] which is what most people do.

[11:09] If you see something new, you click over,

[11:10] like at least for me, it's almost always what I'll do

[11:13] if I see something interesting.

[11:14] And then the profile tells me, in one snippet,

[11:17] who this person is and why I should listen to them.

[11:20] And then you have your link or your DM or your,

[11:23] whatever your CTA is that's in the profile.

[11:26] And again, you can put that as the first comment.

[11:28] You can put it in the description.

[11:29] Like you have three different places.

[11:30] You can put the CTA outside of the actual content itself

[11:32] that I think will carry the content a lot more further.

[11:35] They might.

[11:36] I think one thing as well that you mentioned

[11:38] where it's like, say what no one else is saying.

[11:40] I feel like that for me at first was something

[11:42] that was very overwhelming, because I'm talking about wellness

[11:44] and eating healthy and fitness,

[11:46] which is the most saturated information on the internet.

[11:49] And so in my head, I was like, okay,

[11:51] it's gonna be kind of hard to not see what arrows are saying,

[11:53] but how do I say it differently?

[11:54] Right?

[11:55] And so I think with whatever you're doing is like,

[11:56] you want to be able to explain things

[11:58] in the most digestible, foreign possible.

[12:01] At least it's something that's helped me a lot.

[12:03] So I speak faster than normal,

[12:05] just to like, you know, keep people engaged

[12:08] and stuff like that.

[12:08] And I really try and dump things down.

[12:11] Did you just find ways to distinguish

[12:13] like how did you, you know, create that separation

[12:16] between that saturation?

[12:18] So before I was making finance content,

[12:20] I had this one day I was having the epiphanyals I do.

[12:22] Like, how can you turn people's heads?

[12:25] Like, you need to like, I mean,

[12:26] unless you're like extremely professional

[12:27] and you're talking about like,

[12:28] you need to be able to turn people's heads

[12:29] and make them listen to you.

[12:30] And so I was just like, dude,

[12:31] I'm gonna start speaking faster

[12:32] like really bringing in enthusiasm and passion.

[12:33] And big shift is how to to how I say this a lot,

[12:38] but people still don't do it.

[12:40] Like if you say like, how to,

[12:43] three ways to blah, blah, kind of sucks.

[12:46] Like everyone says it like,

[12:47] the amount of people's profiles that I see

[12:49] that have like five followers,

[12:50] they're like six neat tricks that just like,

[12:52] no one gives a shit, right?

[12:54] It's six ways I helped this person do something,

[12:59] or six ways I,

[13:00] because the thing is, is like, how is it unique?

[13:01] Well, there's only one you.

[13:03] And you have the client see you've worked with.

[13:05] Like my case study stuff or videos

[13:07] that I make them like,

[13:08] no one else can make this content.

[13:10] Yeah, I've noticed it too.

[13:11] I noticed it in the school games.

[13:14] It's like opinion pieces versus like a story

[13:18] about something that happened.

[13:19] Right.

[13:20] Like the worst thing,

[13:21] I hate it when I see someone do a person.

[13:23] It's like how to be successful,

[13:25] I look at their profile,

[13:26] they've got one member in their group, which is them.

[13:28] Yeah.

[13:29] And they haven't even commented on anyone's stuff.

[13:33] So I'm like, shut up basically,

[13:36] like in my mind.

[13:39] But then you see Evelyn, for example,

[13:41] say, over the last 30 days,

[13:43] I spent the smatch money on ads

[13:45] and here's what I found.

[13:47] And she just lays out the facts.

[13:50] That's the difference, right?

[13:51] Yeah.

[13:52] State the facts and tell the truth.

[13:53] Because no one's doing anything.

[13:55] Everyone's just talking shit on the internet.

[13:59] So if you don't have evidence,

[14:00] this is just for everybody who's listening

[14:02] who's back home.

[14:03] So the best version of this is like,

[14:05] you know, I helped all these people just like you do this thing.

[14:09] One degree below that is like,

[14:10] I did this thing that you also want to do.

[14:12] And you just are like me.

[14:13] And so you want the same thing.

[14:15] A version before that is I did this work

[14:17] that you're not willing to do.

[14:19] And so I will show you the result of that work.

[14:20] And so I could just as easily have a title

[14:22] for the YouTube video that I have for the six pictures

[14:24] that we're making our content as like,

[14:28] I got eight million people across these platforms,

[14:31] like over the last three years,

[14:32] so what I learned.

[14:34] If I didn't have the proof from the eight million,

[14:37] I could just say, I made 35,000 posts.

[14:40] This is what I like.

[14:41] I'd be like, well, shit.

[14:42] I mean, he probably learned something.

[14:44] You know what I mean?

[14:45] And so like, that is the edification.

[14:47] And so like the action creates the proof.

[14:49] So the people at home that don't want to do the actual hard thing,

[14:52] like they're not the expert,

[14:53] they don't want to do the actual hard thing.

[14:55] You can make an observation of like how someone else did the hard thing

[14:59] and like back into their process.

[15:01] And then it's even believable, which is like ideally

[15:03] you're doing it about a big person

[15:04] who's like really successful.

[15:06] And the metrics are easy to prove.

[15:08] And you're just like connecting the dots for the audience.

[15:11] You know, when I started my channel,

[15:13] I had no credibility.

[15:14] So I talked about stoicism and what Marcus Riddier said.

[15:17] It's like no one cares what I say,

[15:18] but people care what he said.

[15:20] Because he has the credibility.

[15:21] Superstar.

[15:22] So with education content, everyone wants to deal on time.

[15:26] So if you think about fundamental education

[15:27] is it's like I spent all this time learning math

[15:31] and I'm going to teach it to you in less time

[15:33] than it took me to learn it.

[15:34] And so people are like, wow, I don't want to do all those 10,000

[15:36] problems show me the three step way that you do it

[15:39] from this big thing you did.

[15:40] And so I mean, I think this civilization was forward

[15:43] is that like it takes us all this time to learn this thing.

[15:46] We then distill it down.

[15:47] Someone starts one step further

[15:48] and then like that's how you put a brick in the wall.

[15:50] And so like if we are quote educators,

[15:52] which almost everybody here is, I think,

[15:53] because they want here an entertainer.

[15:55] No, okay, so if everybody here's an educator,

[15:57] then all we want to demonstrate is huge ROI on time

[16:01] for them.

[16:01] And so the more time you can show, the more cost you can show,

[16:04] the everyone did both.

[16:05] She's like, I spent all this time making these ads

[16:07] and I spent all this money doing it.

[16:08] And it's like, wow, I don't have to spend that time

[16:10] more than money and I can get the same lesson.

[16:12] This is a good deal.

[16:13] And then they listen, they buy,

[16:15] then they follow her, whatever.

[16:17] That was definitely one of my biggest takeaways

[16:20] in the last three years of making content.

[16:21] In the beginning, cherry picking facts

[16:25] and not wasting its damn second of anyone's time

[16:27] and just delivering the value.

[16:29] As quick as possible, is the only way

[16:31] is the fastest way to build that initial audience.

[16:32] Because once people know that you are,

[16:33] then you can kind of fluff it off a little bit more

[16:35] because you're gonna listen unconsciously.

[16:37] But it didn't mean like you were saying before.

[16:39] In the beginning, that portfolio,

[16:40] that garden of content that you're building,

[16:43] in the beginning, it's just straight delivery, cherry picking.

[16:46] And my theory is that you keep doing that

[16:49] and actually don't get fluffy.

[16:51] Watch out, yeah.

[16:52] That's like, this is what we saw in our stuff.

[16:55] You can because you have an audience.

[16:57] And so the idea there is if I, if by percent,

[17:00] I grew the most when I treated everyone

[17:02] like they didn't know who I was

[17:03] and I had to earn every single second,

[17:05] it's continued like the guy who dates his wife

[17:09] like it's at the first date on their 10 years,

[17:11] keeps the wife.

[17:13] The one who keeps the audience is the one who treats them

[17:15] like they don't know who he is

[17:16] and he has to keep earning it every day.

[17:18] And so like one of the six shifts that we have

[17:20] from the 35,000 years of content we put out

[17:22] is that we are no longer doing basically

[17:25] what I consider branded content, meaning

[17:27] that basically like Alex Ramozzi's diet,

[17:30] Alex Ramozzi's version of branding.

[17:32] Because if you don't know who I am, who gives a shit?

[17:35] And if the point of me making content

[17:36] is to get more people to find out about me,

[17:38] then I have to not say who I am,

[17:39] I have to say what I've done.

[17:41] And then that becomes the reference point

[17:42] for the content.

[17:43] Just to something, I mean, do it every one,

[17:45] but that's what I'm doing.

[17:46] So first off, I'll open up to you guys.

[17:48] What's been working well for you right now?

[17:50] In terms of getting members of school off organic.

[17:53] Man chat.

[17:54] What was that?

[17:55] Man chat.

[17:55] Many chat.

[17:56] So running, so you post and then have a many chat link.

[18:00] Yeah, just tap them, comment and then a main chat

[18:03] will automatically be the end of the link, so join.

[18:06] So comment, CCA.

[18:08] Is this on Instagram?

[18:10] You have heard many people using this successfully.

[18:13] Yeah.

[18:14] We actually have a fun build that.

[18:15] So I said, I said, I'm straight to school

[18:17] because some people can't really articulate

[18:19] and just see swallowing sense of fun on.

[18:22] Yeah, it just warms them up.

[18:23] You can send them like a lead magnet,

[18:24] like something free.

[18:25] For example, I've made this free guide for you,

[18:28] as well as why they see the free value.

[18:30] At the bottom, they'll be like the V-cell,

[18:32] the cells that are there.

[18:34] Then it'll like, oh wow, he really helped me.

[18:37] So I'll join the thing.

[18:38] So it warms them up for the school.

[18:42] I may wish it really,

[18:43] because I know this has worked well.

[18:44] Maybe we should really flesh the cells.

[18:47] It does really work.

[18:48] So first of all, you've got to have an Instagram page

[18:51] with a following, right?

[18:53] And then you post, you do a post.

[18:57] What are you saying?

[18:58] You'll put, what does this post look like?

[18:59] So we do direct DM, CTAs like San Discikey Word.

[19:04] You can also do a comment, I haven't done the comment before,

[19:06] but it's been the most effective strategy

[19:08] because you can pre-out of eight voice messages

[19:11] and then at the end, bringing the virtual sales letter,

[19:13] which is the offer.

[19:14] And so what is the actual post?

[19:17] So basically, it's like, you're giving free value at the start.

[19:20] Here's how to lose weight in three different ways.

[19:23] And then you say the free value,

[19:25] after that you'd be like, I've actually made a full guide

[19:27] if you want more on this.

[19:29] So because you're giving them value,

[19:31] you say DM me fat loss.

[19:35] Many chat will see that.

[19:36] And there was send that over to their DM.

[19:38] So when something's sent over to DM, it's more warm,

[19:41] because it seems like we sent it.

[19:44] So when you do that, they're like, wow,

[19:46] this guide message me, they'll click it.

[19:49] And they'll consume the free guide, allowing them

[19:53] to be more warm to get into your program.

[19:57] So you use the comment trigger.

[20:00] So I do, if I'm more alive, and they come and start

[20:04] with my lines, they'll be said for DM.

[20:07] If they come and assert word on my post,

[20:08] even if they can spell it will...

[20:10] But you get in the live, too.

[20:12] I'll bet you get a ton during the live.

[20:14] Yeah, there are no other things.

[20:15] And then also if they send me a DM, they'll be there.

[20:18] So I just had, I know my first post,

[20:20] it is when I viral.

[20:21] I actually liked this from Pose.

[20:23] We're all start to post off with a hook.

[20:25] So the first thing I've said was,

[20:28] this is what I will do if I had less than $100 in my name

[20:30] and I wanted to make $10,000, $20,000.

[20:32] So that right there's just wrap, people's attention,

[20:34] and then just throughout the post.

[20:36] It was like maybe a one minute or less post.

[20:37] I just gave a free, like, game one step by step

[20:40] to just that that they're made real simple.

[20:42] You want more information about this comment.

[20:44] The word deals under this post,

[20:46] I'm a DMU a link to my community.

[20:48] And then they'll get a set-sart funnel.

[20:50] We get their phone number, we get their email address,

[20:53] we get their name.

[20:54] So even if they don't sign up for a school community,

[20:57] we have their contact information.

[20:58] So now they're getting text messages

[20:59] and getting emails, so we're just constantly marketing to them.

[21:03] So you leave captioned that it's a school in the thank you page,

[21:05] like a school like read or act after the update.

[21:08] Things that we do, opt in,

[21:09] and then it'll take them to a second page,

[21:11] and they may just, it'll collect their payment,

[21:14] and then that'll send them over to the school.

[21:15] Okay, got it, understood.

[21:18] The title to what Rashida said,

[21:19] with Instagram, Lies and TikTok Lies,

[21:22] what you can do is you can automate the live as well.

[21:26] So what we did to actually really get ourselves in this position

[21:30] is to go live literally twice to three times a day.

[21:33] And what we did was we've given out profile reviews.

[21:38] So we're basically helping people grow their social media.

[21:42] So we said, we told them,

[21:43] come it down in the live guide,

[21:48] and they will get sent to the school.

[21:51] So we did profile reviews,

[21:53] so we're like holding their profile up

[21:56] and reviewing it, giving them personalized value,

[22:00] and people will be like, wow, I want that.

[22:02] And so if you want a full review,

[22:03] help out to my school,

[22:05] we have group calls like this every single week.

[22:07] Imagine if I gave you this every single week, right?

[22:11] And speaking actually one or one with you,

[22:13] and you can run that automation through live as well.

[22:18] I like that a lot.

[22:20] So either a common CTA, which you can do a live,

[22:22] I feel, I mean, me just shooting from the hip here.

[22:25] If you're alive with a lot of people,

[22:26] and you're saying comment this if you want it,

[22:28] you're going to get a ton of comments.

[22:30] And then all of them shot over to many chat,

[22:33] and then they get either a lead magnet,

[22:36] which is your method, or for your method,

[22:38] you just send them straight to the funnel to opt in,

[22:40] and then go to the school community after they collect,

[22:42] you collect a payment.

[22:43] The cool one about the comment is it probably

[22:45] boasts the reach of the post.

[22:47] Because the reason is they,

[22:49] then it'll automatically have me send a comment,

[22:53] and it'll post the answer to your DM.

[22:55] And it's a low-efection thing

[22:56] than seeing a DM I think.

[22:59] Have you tasted the comment one?

[23:00] We haven't done the comment one yet.

[23:01] They'll be interesting.

[23:02] Yeah, the follow-up comment,

[23:04] and I still don't know get two,

[23:05] because then you get double the comment.

[23:07] What's the follow-up comment I'm gonna say?

[23:09] So they're going,

[23:10] it'll just so little comment will work,

[23:11] it'll leave a follow-up comment saying,

[23:13] I just sent you with the,

[23:14] and we're checking the,

[23:15] who's like,

[23:16] buyer won't be in the end.

[23:17] Like you can say, like, in five minutes,

[23:20] like if they've seen it in like 10 minutes,

[23:23] they'll follow up,

[23:24] hey bro, how'd you go with the link?

[23:25] Or hey bro, how'd you go with this?

[23:27] Yeah.

[23:28] So then he's like,

[23:29] allows them to follow up.

[23:31] Yeah, so check your DM comment.

[23:33] You send the DM,

[23:34] and then if they haven't responded yet,

[23:35] five minutes later, it's like,

[23:36] hey, did you like it?

[23:37] Exactly.

[23:38] Exactly.

[23:39] Exactly.

[23:40] Yeah, yeah.

[23:41] And you just sent like a string,

[23:44] like a tight, like a board,

[23:45] and it just goes,

[23:47] yeah, it's quite seamless.

[23:51] Anyone else have any other strategies they did?

[23:52] We're getting it.

[23:53] Yeah, so me just pulling out my camera

[23:55] and just recording,

[23:56] like just very non-edited raw content.

[23:59] For I don't understand it.

[24:00] It's working very well.

[24:01] Two shorts a day.

[24:03] I used to do a long videos.

[24:05] That's how I started.

[24:06] And this is doing better.

[24:07] And just posting those same rules

[24:09] on every single social media

[24:11] is just doing everything I don't know why.

[24:14] Do I believe it?

[24:16] I posted a raw uncut one the other day.

[24:18] And it's done very, very well.

[24:19] I know, you know, raw and uncut.

[24:21] That's just, yeah, yeah.

[24:22] Bear, anyways.

[24:24] So the hang way, we grow.

[24:25] So we just talk our non-social media

[24:27] because we do have another work

[24:28] that the main way we grow our community

[24:30] is to free webinar.

[24:31] Yeah.

[24:32] So we do weekly webinars every week.

[24:35] You know your list?

[24:36] Say it again.

[24:37] You know your list?

[24:38] How do you get people to the webinar?

[24:38] Yeah, we'll send out emails and out text messages

[24:41] promoted on social media.

[24:42] My business partner has a huge following.

[24:45] So we'll do weekly webinars.

[24:47] And then at the end of the webinar,

[24:49] we offer them a bonus if they join our community.

[24:52] So if the end of the webinar

[24:54] we're up selling and so I read a five-day whole camp.

[24:57] Usually those boot camps are a few hundred dollars.

[24:59] But now we're telling a bit of you

[25:01] by a ticket to enter into our school community,

[25:04] you'll get a free ticket to the boot camp.

[25:08] As it has the biggest way of you

[25:09] to broaden a community, that's the multi-accessal.

[25:13] So the bonus is the free ticket bonus for joining school.

[25:16] Join school and you get a free ticket

[25:18] to a five-day boot camp.

[25:19] And the five-day boot camp is really still up selling

[25:21] to a high ticket and it's where it's shipped.

[25:23] The furls weren't in position for the high ticket.

[25:26] We can still keep them in the low ticket

[25:29] in the school and it ridges in the kitchen

[25:30] and then it's so it'll ever even a high ticket.

[25:32] So free virtual event, which is the webinar.

[25:35] And then from there, join my school.

[25:38] And if you do that, you can attend this other event

[25:41] that normally you'd have to pay for, but it's also free.

[25:43] Is that on virtual too?

[25:45] Yeah, it's virtual.

[25:46] The webinar is we're selling the boot camp.

[25:50] So you're selling a boot camp and then you get free actors

[25:53] and you're going to school.

[25:54] So you do the whole pitch of selling the boot camp and say,

[25:57] you could pay for it or just join it.

[25:59] It's cost of looking at your house by.

[26:01] One of my favorite pitch strategies.

[26:03] Yeah, so that's the benefit of the boot camp.

[26:05] I love what's the success.

[26:06] Love that strategy.

[26:06] So did you already have that boot camp

[26:08] to stop this before you use the launch of school?

[26:10] We did.

[26:11] It's the private and a lot of people

[26:13] have it and really don't go about it.

[26:15] But the private value below that region

[26:16] give us all week hacks, so much information in those five day.

[26:21] So that they don't want to miss that boot camp.

[26:23] We just make sure that we make sure that we've done,

[26:25] you know, it's a fire.

[26:26] So do you pay for the, like, do you pay for the,

[26:29] like, like, the place where they stay?

[26:30] Is virtual?

[26:31] It's a five day virtual boot camp.

[26:33] Oh, God, how's it?

[26:34] How's it built out in your school?

[26:35] Is it just like a couple of different sections

[26:37] of the model, saying boot camp.

[26:39] Hot one boot camp off to.

[26:40] We just put the link on the calendar.

[26:42] We just had the input and so many kinds of calendar.

[26:45] So you have to be in the school community to access the boot camp.

[26:48] Also, it's an interaction in colors or pay $10,000, which they.

[26:53] And then everybody has already in this community.

[26:56] They have access to every boot camp everyone.

[26:59] Because we're getting a shot at up seven set of hides to get.

[27:01] So you hold one thought that you can every month.

[27:04] The reading lab they see in.

[27:06] And so that's a huge part of the delivery from the school perspective.

[27:09] Is that they get?

[27:09] Do they only get one?

[27:10] Or they just get that free boot camp every time?

[27:12] If long as they're in a company,

[27:14] they can attend every time.

[27:16] Can you get 450 posts out in two days worth of effort?

[27:19] Like what's your process?

[27:22] Where's my guys?

[27:25] Work.

[27:27] A lot of work.

[27:28] I mean.

[27:30] Because it's like writing to like then shooting.

[27:32] They're the biggest secret, secret weapon that I have is Twitter or

[27:35] Max, whatever.

[27:37] That's actually like no one knows that.

[27:40] But like everything is.

[27:41] So I just I tweet all day long on X.

[27:44] And then the stuff that does well, we then use the crap out of.

[27:48] So that then obviously gets me people on X.

[27:51] I take that that turns into Instagram reels.

[27:55] From there, I will read the Instagram reels that I already know

[27:58] and perform into a camera.

[27:59] And then those become clips that also crush literally

[28:02] different format for the same thing.

[28:04] And then I'll take 20 of those and string them together

[28:07] and make them a YouTube video.

[28:10] And then when we caption all of the posts that we do,

[28:14] we use other high-performing tweets to caption the other tweets.

[28:17] Like my captions are just two tweets.

[28:19] It's tweet one which is the real tweet two,

[28:22] which is the caption is just another tweet.

[28:24] Because I, so if you ever see anything written from

[28:26] Act with this knock-out or me, I wrote it.

[28:29] Everything.

[28:30] It's just all on my Twitter.

[28:31] And so those search like friendship, loyalty, sales, whatever.

[28:35] And there's 50 tweets about it and they'll just grab one

[28:40] that goes, you know, is closest with the tweet

[28:42] that they made for the real and that becomes that.

[28:45] So you just like, it's spires like every year of tweet.

[28:47] Yeah.

[28:48] And then you just take the best one.

[28:49] Yeah.

[28:50] I would even say it's spired.

[28:51] There's just like stuff happens.

[28:52] And I'd be like, don't do rev shares for equity.

[28:55] Yeah.

[28:56] Like don't do advice for equity.

[28:58] It does not work unless you're doing

[28:59] imminous skill amounts and even then people hate you.

[29:01] That's super.

[29:02] She used Twitter as testing part.

[29:04] Smallest friction, just proof of concept, whatever tweets do the best.

[29:07] Use those to create reals, generate a question from that.

[29:10] And then you bulk those for the bigger higher value to be.

[29:13] And there's zero penalty for tweeting a lot at the platforms.

[29:15] Both for it.

[29:16] So what?

[29:17] So if you had, let's say you were to start your Twitter account from zero.

[29:21] Like how did you start?

[29:22] I did start.

[29:23] Yeah.

[29:24] Yeah.

[29:25] Yeah.

[29:26] Like, let's say right now, you basically had zero followers.

[29:29] Zero.

[29:31] So what you know is that your power towards your value towards scripting.

[29:35] How would you start a Twitter account?

[29:36] And would you even start a Twitter account if you already have Instagram?

[29:39] 100%.

[29:40] I would literally the core of everything I do.

[29:42] So yes.

[29:43] So I'm a writer first.

[29:44] People don't know this.

[29:45] The reason the book's too well is like I write them.

[29:47] Like no one else writes.

[29:48] I don't want to go this writer.

[29:49] I write them.

[29:50] That's why they're good.

[29:52] And so, well I'll say this.

[29:54] The reason they still sell two years later is because they're good.

[29:57] If I had a ghost writer, I could sell a million copies on one day because people will

[30:01] buy something that's associated with me, but not necessarily they won't tell their

[30:04] friends about it.

[30:05] And that's what I want the long tail.

[30:09] So from, if I started to start over from Twitter, I would have two proof points that

[30:13] I try.

[30:14] So one is going to be in the description, which is like who I am, what have I done?

[30:16] Now if you've done nothing, then everything has to be around documenting stuff that

[30:20] you're actively working on.

[30:22] Like the person who's like, here's how to like get yourself to be motivated.

[30:25] It's like, I hate this.

[30:27] I help people grow their Instagram following.

[30:30] And they have like 79 followers.

[30:32] I'm like, what are you doing?

[30:33] You don't have to pass the first check of proof.

[30:35] It's just odd like duh.

[30:36] You have a vague assignment that just says bullshit.

[30:39] Description.

[30:40] And then, because the way Twitter works, you can pin one tweet.

[30:42] And so that tweet would have as a long tweet that's like, here's why I am, by the way.

[30:47] And then the tweets, everything after that is going to be consumed within that context.

[30:51] You guys dial the base to your tweets in any way for graphics and all of you that are

[30:55] the search.

[30:56] You can search.

[30:57] I mean, it's searchable already.

[30:58] As is.

[30:59] Does a Chrome extension go tweet hunter?

[31:00] Yeah.

[31:01] Well, this Twitter ad bumps.

[31:02] It is all that stuff.

[31:03] I don't even use any.

[31:04] I literally like, like, I only have one thing that I use that just allows me to schedule

[31:08] tweets out because sometimes I'll think of like three or four and I'll just like, oh, well,

[31:12] I'm not going to do it with a row.

[31:13] So I'll just space them out of a bar.

[31:14] It's not it.

[31:15] And it clips.

[31:16] Where do you post the clips?

[31:20] They said you do the reels and then you just re-shoot a clip.

[31:22] So we do different.

[31:24] So our content is different across YouTube shorts.

[31:28] You don't need to do this.

[31:29] We do this.

[31:30] It's different on all platforms.

[31:32] And so YouTube shorts, Instagram, reels, TikTok are the three short form platforms

[31:38] that we're on right now.

[31:40] And so that's what we do.

[31:41] And then we have a couple of longs per week they go out on YouTube.

[31:45] I do podcasts as well, which a lot of the audio from YouTube turns into podcasts.

[31:52] And yeah, that's the content system.

[31:54] We just do like five or seven YouTube shorts a day.

[31:58] I do like five to seven times a day.

[32:01] We post just this is just my account.

[32:03] We do two or three Instagram reels a day.

[32:07] I think we do like four TikToks a day.

[32:09] And then we have whatever one I'm missing that one has it do.

[32:13] And then I have Layla.

[32:15] So times two.

[32:16] What's the, why do you guys have a different strategy for what you post on Instagram,

[32:21] what's your post on TikTok?

[32:23] Because Instagram penalizes you.

[32:25] You can't, it doesn't, like if I posted 11 times, we wouldn't get the same.

[32:29] We, I mean, I'm happy to do volume.

[32:31] But no, we saw two to three was where we kind of max out.

[32:35] That's what most people don't realize.

[32:36] Like you can't spam Instagram.

[32:38] Can I?

[32:39] Yeah, still functions more like an email list.

[32:42] Still compared to like Twitter and TikTok, which are,

[32:46] TikToks actually move more in the Instagram reaction.

[32:47] But where your stuff gets shown to followers, even if it's not as good of content.

[32:53] But the original TikTok was like, any week ago viral because they just prioritized

[32:57] the quality of the content.

[32:58] And basically followers had zero influence on who saw your stuff.

[33:04] And I think I think just based on what I'm saying, it's shifting a little bit more

[33:08] towards like some thought like they will put your stuff towards some followers.

[33:11] Do you ever, I'm sure you do, you A.B. test, let's say one tweet as well.

[33:16] You should, you should say it once or in a way for reals and then a different way for

[33:20] YouTube show or two.

[33:21] 100%.

[33:22] We remix and we purpose as much as we can.

[33:23] So same topic, different, different structure.

[33:25] If we see, if we see that a tweet does really well, then I know that that topic is

[33:29] interesting to people or at least that phrasing is interesting people.

[33:32] And so I'll say it directly camera, it'll go into an email, it'll be a caption,

[33:36] on a different platform like we use the crap out of it.

[33:38] Like tweets are my, my home base.

[33:40] That's where that's, that's the actual only direct content that I make.

[33:45] Everything else is multiplied from there.

[33:47] Yeah.

[33:48] We have a plan to repose the same exact content over a lot of that time.

[33:53] Where is it?

[33:54] Or do you?

[33:55] Yeah, like greatest hits, greatest hits.

[33:56] Yeah, I'm fine with greatest hits.

[33:57] We actually, I think we do a bad job of doing it right now.

[33:59] I would like something I was like, hey, we should, you know, maybe post this stuff again.

[34:05] But yeah, that's, that's actually something that we're working on.

[34:07] Up to this point, it's been almost entirely to know about.

[34:09] Yeah, so recycling like your top 10% of content and then just sprinkling that back out,

[34:15] even once or twice a week, your greatest hits from a year ago,

[34:17] because you have new followers to them, it's not, it's new.

[34:22] How long events would you post that?

[34:23] For example, I met a piece of content that banged.

[34:27] Depends on the platform.

[34:28] So I can take something that was a tweet from six months ago.

[34:31] And I could do it again today and it'll crush the same.

[34:35] If I think, I think basically the more,

[34:37] like Instagram, I think, has the longest, the longest memory and the least amount that you can post per day.

[34:43] Like YouTube, you just can't do it at all.

[34:44] Like you can't repost a video because the video is kind of live forever.

[34:48] So like, I guess YouTube would be the extreme on this on this side.

[34:51] And then Twitter is probably the shortest, shortest memory, most forgiving in terms of volume and reuse.

[34:59] I'd say TikTok's like here.

[35:01] Yeah, exactly.

[35:02] So the amount of time that that elapses between reusing the same thing,

[35:05] I think it also depends on how fast you're growing.

[35:07] I think your definition of repurposing is like, like, sometimes reshooting as well, right?

[35:12] And not just reposting.

[35:13] Yeah. So do you just have two or do you have more forms of reposting?

[35:17] I mean, so repurposing.

[35:19] Those are the, I mean, cross-platform,

[35:22] different format and then literally just redoing the same thing and just

[35:27] posting an old clip again.

[35:29] That's like four different ways you can remix the same thing.

[35:32] You do.

[35:33] It's content ID systems really, really good.

[35:35] Just they check the copyright.

[35:36] Right.

[35:36] I've got those processes built out.

[35:38] You can't repost like that.

[35:39] Right.

[35:40] And how long did you go from just you independently doing your content before you brought in the whole team and stuff?

[35:46] Because I like my screen time is just outrageous.

[35:49] Like between shooting on for reals, TikToks, YouTube shorts and long form YouTube,

[35:53] I thought about adding Twitter last week.

[35:55] Like at this point, it's like I need to out.

[35:56] How many out?

[35:58] How many out was the, you're getting?

[35:59] I'm curious.

[35:59] Like nine.

[36:00] Nine.

[36:01] Even then.

[36:02] The nine, and I was in school.

[36:03] So it was like all days just like stimulation and sick.

[36:06] Yeah.

[36:07] No, I mean, so if you've read the leads book, I talk about agencies.

[36:11] There's a chapter on agencies.

[36:12] I, that's the strategy I use.

[36:14] So day one, I had agencies for everything for content creation.

[36:19] And then I told them day one like my goal is to bring this in house over time.

[36:23] And so I'm going to learn whatever I can't.

[36:24] And a lot of those guys like they don't know as much as I know now,

[36:28] but they knew more than I did then.

[36:30] And so I just learned what I could way faster and just like,

[36:33] try to avoid like a lot of new new B mistakes.

[36:36] And then I just make an immediately mistakes.

[36:38] And just had to learn how to like not make those.

[36:40] You know what I mean?

[36:41] Um, but yeah, a lot for me though, like capital was an issue.

[36:45] And so it's just like I'm willing to pay to just almost like be accountable to making three

[36:49] YouTube videos a week or whatever it was.

[36:51] Yeah.

[36:52] And then they would like trim and cut them and put a pack, you know, put the,

[36:55] the headline of the thumbnail on it, which I hated half the time.

[36:58] And I was just like, whatever else we'll do with the later.

[37:02] And I want that same line.

[37:03] Do you ever get tired of it?

[37:05] I like having like, no, I'm in substance the 90's.

[37:08] It's so much balling and her so long consistent like,

[37:12] do you ever feel like I think it's as long as you talk to us stuff that you like.

[37:16] And so my team knows this and like there's some time.

[37:19] And they're really good about it.

[37:20] And I think setting that precedent with the team is like,

[37:22] hey, I need you to come with like 10 cool video ideas.

[37:24] And like honestly half the time.

[37:26] I'm like, I don't want to do any of this.

[37:28] I want to talk about this because it's top-mind.

[37:30] And so I talk about this stuff that I want to talk about.

[37:33] And I think so that also just kind of gives natural,

[37:35] like kind of variety to the content in general.

[37:37] Because I'll be like, really focused on LTV stuff for a while.

[37:40] And I'm like, you know what?

[37:42] Like I'll get into like there's a sales issue for one of the companies.

[37:44] And like, I'll just kind of like re-wash myself into sales stuff.

[37:47] And I get salesmen, I talk about sales and all my content for a little bit.

[37:49] And so I just kind of let that happen naturally rather than if you're like,

[37:53] I have to do one thing on family after do one thing.

[37:55] Like I have we've never had content buckets ever.

[37:59] If content buckets happen, it's because they have occurred more than because we

[38:03] plan them.

[38:04] Which you had the observation point, this is total side note.

[38:07] The amount of like, election-muzzy breakdowns that are just completely false.

[38:11] I find hilarious.

[38:12] I'm like, oh, is that my four pillars?

[38:14] I'm like, yeah, I don't do any of that.

[38:17] And so now it's way more.

[38:18] I talk about stuff that I enjoy talking about.

[38:20] And from a context strategy perspective, I had this roommate,

[38:23] brilliant.

[38:24] One of the two smart people I've remit in my life.

[38:27] And he had this, he read this book and it was called Two Good to Fail.

[38:31] And I was like, what's your marketing strategy?

[38:32] He was like that.

[38:34] He's like, if I just make the stuff that I have so fucking good,

[38:37] like if I just make it so that even if one person sees it, they will share it.

[38:41] Then eventually all win.

[38:42] And he now runs a $100 million company.

[38:45] And so like, and we were roommates back then.

[38:46] And so I very much have taken that perspective.

[38:48] Like if you're brand new, you just need to make this stuff as good as humanly possible.

[38:53] And the reality is that it will still suck.

[38:55] But you still have to have that bar because you'll look at what you did to you.

[38:57] It's going to be like, oh my god, that was a dark shit.

[38:59] Right?

[39:00] But just like holding nothing back.

[39:02] Like the reason I talk about that a lot is because somebody who's new,

[39:05] holding nothing back is still like barely valuable.

[39:08] Right?

[39:09] And so like people still will consume this stuff.

[39:11] See that you're really good.

[39:13] And then still pay you for help.

[39:15] They will.

[39:16] Like they will pay you for implementation.

[39:17] So just give away the secrets.

[39:18] It does not matter.

[39:19] Are you happy that your as famous as you are now?

[39:23] It's as pros and cons.

[39:24] Honestly, as pros and cons.

[39:26] What's one biggest, what's one biggest put?

[39:29] Biggest pro is that we can recruit anyone from anywhere.

[39:33] That's my one, but I don't want any attention.

[39:36] Privacy is the cost of fame.

[39:38] Like it's a price.

[39:40] The con is privacy.

[39:41] It just doesn't exist.

[39:43] So like every single time I go out to eat with Layla,

[39:45] I have 34 people interrupt us because it's the one time they're going to see me.

[39:50] And they want to take a picture.

[39:51] They want to tell me about their business.

[39:54] And like the first two times it's awesome.

[39:55] And then like the hundredth time it's like, you know, you still want to be really excited about it.

[40:00] Because the thing is, is like, I also don't want the reputation of like, yeah, I met him in person

[40:02] needs a day.

[40:03] And it's just because like it's my 10,000th of this.

[40:06] And it's the first time in the last time this level of having for you.

[40:08] And just trying to, and so I think on some level, it actually changes your behavior because

[40:12] if you basically realize that everyone is recording you at all times, like mentally or literally recording

[40:18] you, you just, you're like, okay, I just can't have bad days.

[40:22] Sorry, did you guys get that?

[40:24] Because you're obviously doing that with like, you guys are big, but like do you get recognized

[40:29] and corrupted?

[40:30] It's just stuff like that.

[40:31] I choose to live in Alaska.

[40:32] Please.

[40:33] I mean, for me, it's just been, I mean, it's been 10 months since I started and it's definitely like,

[40:39] it's like surreal at this point.

[40:40] Like now, you're like, I mean, college, if I go to like, I went to the college bar and I was just like,

[40:44] what the fuck?

[40:45] Walking around, like, yeah, it's weird.

[40:48] But I feel like it's that trade off.

[40:50] You have to kind of accept, especially if you, I mean, in my head, it's just like, I want

[40:54] to continue to grow on social media and leverage that to grow on my business.

[40:57] And like, if I want to do that, that's just, yeah, it was a choice.

[41:00] I did it on purpose.

[41:01] And it like it took me a long time to get there because I was like, I really don't know if

[41:04] I want to do this.

[41:05] But it was a choice.

[41:06] And the one thing about it is that it's like a tattoo.

[41:08] It's like having a kid.

[41:10] It is irreversible, which is why I took a really long time to like think about whether

[41:14] I wanted to do it or not.

[41:15] So like, if you have a skill and you don't really particularly care for it, then I would

[41:18] say, don't worry about it.

[41:20] Just go get the businesses the way you know how to get them and then just let them funnel

[41:23] the people into it and do the work that you know how to do.

[41:26] Okay.

[41:27] So we covered, I think we covered organic stuff.

[41:31] Let me see if there's any other, um, do you have to decide a value like a network

[41:36] to your social presence?

[41:37] What value do you have to get that right?

[41:39] It's probably worth about a billion dollars right now, honestly.

[41:42] Like that's not me, exactly.

[41:43] That's just from the amount.

[41:46] Like if I were to just quantify what we like the amount of media that we get in the conversion

[41:50] value of that media.

[41:51] So like if, if like if I had an elegant, like the most elegant conversion system would be

[41:55] like we go public.

[41:57] And I said, hey, do you guys want to invest in this?

[41:59] I've taken this thing from here to 250 million a year.

[42:04] I think a lot of my audience would be like, yeah, man.

[42:06] And then that was immediately, that was not common to be a multi-billion arc company.

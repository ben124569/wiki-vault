[00:00] In this video, I'm going to talk to you about Biden's new proposed tax plan.

[00:03] It what it means for us as entrepreneurs.

[00:06] And I'll try and break down all different levels of entrepreneurs and how these things

[00:09] may affect you.

[00:10] All right. And so I made a little list of the main bullets that I think everyone should know about.

[00:16] All right. So I'm going to give you a little example of what it is,

[00:18] what it means for us. And then at the end, what I'm going to do is I'm going to kind of summarize

[00:21] what I plan to do to kind of mitigate some of these things that are happening.

[00:25] All right. Now that being said, I've made other videos on taxes and taxation in general.

[00:29] There are a handful of things here that very, very deeply concern me and I'll express those when we get to them.

[00:34] All right. So let's rock and roll. And if you don't know how I'm going to

[00:37] aim to maximize the ion acquisition.com, it's more full of companies that does a hundred billion dollars.

[00:40] You're going to make these videos because I think they're fun and cool. And I think entrepreneurship is

[00:44] is awesome. All right. So lots of love. Let's see. Let's rock and roll.

[00:47] So number one, they're going to increase the top marginal tax rate to 39.6%

[00:52] after 2022. No big surprise there. They're just going to make the top bracket pay more. Okay.

[00:57] Number two, they're going to tax long term capital gains and qualify dividends with tax

[01:01] income over a million dollars at ordinary income tax rates. Okay. So if you make over a million bucks a year,

[01:06] all your capital gains are now being taxed it again 40% like I just said, which double blows. But,

[01:11] you know, note it, do we think that's going to affect how people invest? Not as much as I think

[01:16] you would think because if you have no alternative, you just have to continue to play the game because

[01:20] you're not going to not invest the money because of the tax. You're still going to invest and then

[01:23] you're just going to have to pay the taxes. Now what I do think it will do is it will get a lot of

[01:27] people do not realize their capital gains because they're going to hope for a change in leadership,

[01:31] which is exactly what I would definitely just not sell. Or we recently, you know, exit three of

[01:36] our companies this last year and it was because we anticipated a capital getting out because of this,

[01:41] but among one of the reasons was that we anticipated a big increase in capital gains tax. And so we thought

[01:45] it might be a good time to recognize some of our equity. All right. So next one is they're going to treat

[01:51] transfers of appreciated property by gift at death as taxable dispositions. Okay. So basically,

[01:58] normally you could, you could give that death and it wasn't taxed in this case. They will be now.

[02:03] They're going to raise the corporate income tax to 28%, you know, which basically bumps it back

[02:07] from when Trump cut it. There's going to be tax on stock, stock, buybacks, which most of you guys

[02:11] probably don't need to worry about. Impose a 20% minimum on income. And this is probably the biggest

[02:16] one. This is like, I mean, well, it'll affect me and might not affect a lot of people. But it's a 20%

[02:20] minimum tax on income. Okay. Including unregulized gains. All right. Which to me is one of the most

[02:26] insane concepts of all time. And I'm going to break down this one particularly at the end of

[02:30] this little bullet at least because like there's a lot of consequences that I think for lack of a

[02:34] genre of fucking insane. But I want to break it down so you can at least, you know, at your next

[02:38] cocktail party or whatever it is like talk intelligently about it. Okay. Next one is imposed minimum

[02:42] term and gift requirements. So it's affective on all all trusts created on after the date.

[02:47] Basically they're just decreasing right off there. I'll cover a couple more of the big ones.

[02:51] Carried interest. So the private equity guys are not going to finally pay income tax. I think it's

[02:54] probably a good thing overall. They're going to cap deferral of gain from 1031 exchanges for the real

[02:59] estate guys to $500,000 per taxpayer, which means like pretty much if you're a serious real estate

[03:04] investor, you're going to now not have that 1031 to like shelter all of your tax free gains. And if you

[03:10] don't know a 1031 is it's basically sell a house. You have the the profit that you have from the house.

[03:14] If you put it into something that's similar in nature, a similar type of building within a period

[03:18] of time, like I think it's a year, then you don't have to pay tax. You basically just transfer

[03:21] and into another building and it continues. And the reason they had those tax treatments is because,

[03:26] you know, the government likes to incentivize people to continue to rebuild infrastructure. And so

[03:29] real estate and buildings are a big part of that. And so if they make it incentivizing for investors

[03:34] to to invest in those places, then it means the country as a whole will continue to upkeep.

[03:39] It's real estate. It will continue to just overall infrastructure continues to build

[03:44] by private money, right? Which is a good thing for everybody. But they're eliminating that. We're

[03:47] clapping it for the vast majority of the people who do the most of the time. They're going to decrease

[03:50] a deductions for easement transactions. That's like kind of a tax loophole around donating land

[03:55] and things like that. And then limit the use of donor advice funds for private donations. So basically

[04:00] they're limit how much you're going to be able to write off off of donations. All right. There's

[04:04] a whole bunch of other stuff. And they also limit the duration of generation skipping transfer tax exemption.

[04:09] So it's effective to all trusts, which means that like for the whole concept of like I want to pass

[04:13] on my wealth to my generations, what are the rock and fellars do? They're going to cut that

[04:18] severely if they pass it. Okay. So this is the belt. I think that there's obviously plenty more

[04:23] than what you can say in five minutes. But I want to talk about one aspect in particular. I'll

[04:29] probably talk about two. One of them is going to be the income tax. The second will be the corporate

[04:33] tax increase. And the third will be the one that I'm most concerned about, which is the unrealized

[04:39] capital gains tax. All right. So first one, you know, if you're going from 37 or on your motor was

[04:43] 37 to 39.6, is it going to make a big difference for you? Probably not if you're in that bracket.

[04:49] But it is kind of like boiling frog, you know, at a certain point, there's only a hundred

[04:53] percent that someone can take. But you know, I've always made in my last video. I talked about how

[04:57] like the real wealth is always built in growth of equities, growth of the things that you're building,

[05:01] right, which is one of the things that they're going to threaten, which I'll get to last. The second

[05:05] one is corporate tax, right? And so if you have a seqorp and this is in the US, you can leave the

[05:09] money that you have in the seqorp and pay less taxes results. At this point, I think it's 23. Don't

[05:15] quote me. My account's done. Somewhere in there for seqorp and they're going to bump into 28. Where

[05:19] this becomes a real issue is that if you take dividends from your company, you pay income tax

[05:24] on the dividends like regular income tax. So you're going to pay 28 and then 40. So all of a sudden

[05:29] this starts to like not make as much sense. Now the seqorp structure makes the most sense. If you plan

[05:34] on continuing to redeploy capital within the business, all right? So if you are playing the game

[05:38] of I want to increase the value of the corporation that I own and I'm going to, so it's more efficient

[05:42] for me to have the corporation pay the 28% keep it in retain earnings and then redeploy it

[05:48] through M&A, capital expenses, investing in infrastructure, things like that they're going to

[05:52] increase the value of the business. And now the vast majority of the time, especially if you're

[05:55] just small business, you don't really have anything besides emergency neck positions and again,

[05:58] I said small business so this might not apply for a lot of people, but besides M&A, there's not a

[06:02] lot of stuff that you're going to redeploy that money for and which is why I think LLCs and whatnot

[06:05] work for most small businesses better. Now once you get a little bit more sophisticated, I think

[06:09] seqorp's can make more sense, but you have to do a cost analysis on both in terms of how you plan

[06:14] on redeploying the capital so that you can in most accounting firms will be able to do a side

[06:18] of my second pair of support you so you can see what your net tax implications are. Now I'm a big

[06:22] fan of not carrying the index we're going to die about about taxes on income, but if you're going

[06:28] to get taxed, you can still be smart about it and just do the normal work. I wouldn't

[06:33] encourage you to spend a tremendous amount of time wasting on this stuff rather than building

[06:37] your business because that's where we're going to build the most of your wealth. Now let's get the

[06:40] last one and then Alex will make two recommendations that I think are going to be highly

[06:43] controversial and unpopular, but I think would be way more beneficial. So the unrealized capital

[06:47] gains. So this is kind of complicated the way they set it up. All right, and a lot of people are

[06:52] being hanging and honing about how this works, but let's just say that your net worth is $100

[06:57] okay. Now a lot of people might be tuning up like, well if I'm not $100,000, I won't care,

[07:01] and you might, but you might not. Now tell you why and it's like right now. The reason you get

[07:05] to $100,000 is because you believe in the American dream and you believe in the American dream

[07:12] because you believe that opportunity is endless and what happens is and this is why I'm very

[07:17] afraid of this particular tax is that it makes it much more difficult to attain. And so what it will

[07:22] essentially do is massively massively, massively affect how much people can basically build their

[07:29] net worth to. And I would more or less be okay with that from a cognitive, you know, from a

[07:36] logical basis, excuse me, if the capital were being redeployed through an efficient system,

[07:41] but the private sector deploys capital 10 times more effectively than the government does.

[07:46] And so you're basically taking money out of people's hands who are very good at deploying capital

[07:50] and putting it into hand people's hands who are very bad at deploying capital, people who work

[07:54] for the government don't normally have the best capital deployment skills compared to people who

[07:59] do this for a living. And so that's like kind of like a systemic concern that I have. The other one is

[08:03] that I think it will kill innovation because I mean, I think this would be a kiss of death for the US

[08:07] economy. It would be really honest with you because we want to be at the cutting edge of innovation,

[08:11] starting new companies, etc. Where do you think so many of these, you know, really exciting,

[08:16] you know, startups, software companies, etc., get their initial funding from.

[08:20] Well, many people. And if wealthy people no longer are incentivized to do that or massively

[08:23] distance enough to do that, then they just won't do it or the best elsewhere. On top of that,

[08:28] US is a whole will be saving less money while all of our foreign competitors will be saving

[08:33] more money and will have the money going to people who are better at allocating capital than their

[08:36] governments. And so I think it's a really, really, really bad move just from an economic sample.

[08:41] Now I'm due and I just want to be really clear. I've only voted one time in my entire life and I

[08:45] regretted it because it was a waste time. So just I say this because I don't think that my vote matters

[08:50] and everyone's like if everyone thought that way, it's like don't worry, don't not everyone thinks

[08:54] that way. So it doesn't matter. I'm not going to like somehow make one YouTube video and everyone's going

[08:57] to suddenly stop voting because what happens is if you were people started voting, then the vote's

[09:00] better more and the more people start voting it, right? So it's a balancing act anyways. Here's how

[09:03] the unrealized capital gains tax work. This is me broad brushstrokes. Okay. The the armchair

[09:09] people who read every single word of the tax proposal, you're awesome. I love you and, you know,

[09:14] bio means put all of the all of the the corrections in the comments. But this is the general just.

[09:19] Okay. So let's say you have a $200 million net worth and the $200 million net worth is based on a

[09:26] a 10x multiple of a company that you own that does $20 million a year in EBITDA or earnings.

[09:33] All right. I'm trying to keep the simple as help. Okay. So you have a 10x multiple on 20,

[09:37] which gives you $200 million in value. Now how they're going to calculate this, I haven't even read

[09:42] into because I actually haven't been able to find it. I googled it all over and I couldn't find it.

[09:46] But let's just say that that's how it's being calculated. Okay. And if someone in the comments does

[09:49] know how it's being calculated, post the formula. I'm really curious. So you got $20 million that's

[09:53] that's coming in as EBITDA for the company that you own 100% off just for math sake. And that's worth

[09:59] $200 million. Now let's say that next year you grow the thing to $25 million in EBITDA. Okay. And

[10:05] with the 10x valuation, that means that your company goes to from $200 to $250 million. Okay. Value.

[10:11] Assuming you took all of the profit of your company as a dividend, which is not likely,

[10:15] but let's just assume again to make this simple. It means that you would make $25 million in income.

[10:20] Okay. That's category one. And then you would have taken your company from $200 to $250 million.

[10:25] So you've got $50 million here and $25 million here. So that was the net increase in your like

[10:29] net worth ish ish. Okay. Pre-tax ish. They want everybody to pay 20% on unrealized capital gains.

[10:40] And so that extra 50 million, 20% of that would be $10 million. Okay. So that's 10 right to the side.

[10:47] And then you've got your normal income tax of 40% on your 25. All right, which is going to be another

[10:53] 10. Okay. Which means keep in keep in math here. If you paid all your taxes up front, then you would pay

[11:00] 25 million. Sorry, 20 million of your 25 million in taxes. 20 out of 25 million in taxes. It's an 80%

[11:09] tax rate. That's really aggressive. Now, that's assuming that you don't have some sort of tech company

[11:13] that doesn't make any profit because if you did have that, then I don't even know what their plan is.

[11:17] For that situation, I think you'd have to sell stock of your own company to pay the tax on the increase

[11:22] like in somehow like it would be or you'd have to take loans against your equity to pay the taxes.

[11:28] It's really shitty. The thing that they're trying to do to soften the blow here. All right, because I mean,

[11:32] think about it. Literally be like overnight 80% tax rates. And that's that's with that example that I gave, right?

[11:37] It could be, it could be, that's it with a really high cash flow company. If you don't have a

[11:41] high cash flow company that's valued for other reasons, it would basically just drain you like you just

[11:46] drain you entirely from all your reserves. You have to go into debt to continue to own your company.

[11:50] Or you'd have to own less of your company to continue to run your company. So you literally be disincentivizing

[11:54] the founders and innovators from continuing to grow their company because if they grew, they get taxed

[11:58] more before they can pay for it. That being said, the little special caveat that they're trying to

[12:02] do to make it softer is that it's, it can be spread over nine years. All right. So that $10 million

[12:09] could be spread over nine years. So it'd be like 1.1 million or whatever on top of your normal income tax.

[12:14] But the thing is is that it was stack up. So it's like it's 1.1. So I might pay my normal,

[12:19] you know, $10 million on my 25 that I paid and income tax. And then I'd have 1.1 that I'd start

[12:23] paying towards the $10 million that I owe on the $50 million. The thing is is that it sounds,

[12:28] it sounds like, okay, that's not, that's not as bad. It's just because no one can think in time.

[12:32] Right? Because you just fast forward 10 years and then you're going to be paying that. It just,

[12:35] they're just they're just slowly bullying the frog to get to the point where where it

[12:40] where it stacks up on top itself. Because next year you're going to owe 1.1 and another probably

[12:44] more than that because if the company grew again, you'd have another, you know, tax belief,

[12:47] you have to pay on top of that. And so hopefully you're seeing it's like mountains of debt,

[12:51] basically in tax. They're going to have to start paying. And so nine years from now, that's when

[12:55] you're, you're, you're, you're getting smashed, right? Because it's going to take nine years for these

[12:58] payment plans to stack. Now, obviously, that's one assuming that they pass it to that they don't

[13:04] repeal it. I think the likelihood that it passes is low, but I will tell you this. I think it is one

[13:09] of the scariest tax bills I've ever seen. And it's because if you disincentivize the very people

[13:17] who are building the things that grow this economy, it makes the risk that a founder takes on

[13:23] virtually untenable. It's like when you start a company, you risk failure and you have the,

[13:27] the odds are stacked against you that you will fail. Like it's very likely that you're going to fail.

[13:31] And in the, in the off chance that you actually succeed, they will, unless you just have a very

[13:36] normal boring cash flow business, which many businesses are not that way that have tremendous value.

[13:40] They will basically just bankrupt you and let in stack so much tax debt on you for things that you

[13:46] haven't realized yet. And here's where it gets worse. What if you do that, you pay taxes on

[13:50] capital gains that are unrealized and then the company goes under, which is also very common.

[13:54] You basically just pay taxes to the government, and it's that you never got, ever. And those

[13:59] taxes might actually be the thing that destroy the business because you got settled with that and you

[14:03] could barely pay your own expenses. So the example I gave was a generous one because a lot of times

[14:10] you're not going to have, you know, $25 million a year that's coming in. Let's say you have,

[14:14] I'll give you a different example to really drive this home. Let's say you had an exit and you have

[14:18] a hundred million dollars. Okay. Let's just say that that's your current network. And you're probably

[14:23] pretty good at making money or allocating capital because you have that money. Right? And so let's say you

[14:27] get 15% on that. Your network goes up by 15 million. And let's say that because you had your, you know,

[14:34] exit, you know, you only make $2 million bucks doing consulting stuff. What? So you make $2 million

[14:39] and you get taxed 40% since 800,000. But then you make $15 million in increased appreciation on your

[14:46] assets. So the 20% minimum tax there would be $3 million on the 15. That's more

[14:53] than you make in total. And people were like, well, it's going to spread over nine years. It's like,

[14:56] yeah, but then next year you're also going to have to pay. And then the net, you're after that. So like,

[15:00] it's going to stack up and people just can't fucking do math. You have $3 million in taxes and you only

[15:04] made $2 million and you still have $800. So you have $1.2 million left and you still owe another

[15:09] three. So you're going to have to come up with $1.8 million every year just because you happen to

[15:14] own stuff and have a success flags it. And so then you start bleeding, you were 100 million that you

[15:19] risked everything to get in order to pay off tax for gains you haven't realized. So you have to sell

[15:25] stuff just you basically the government would just force you to sell your belongings or they put you

[15:30] in prison. So I think it's, I think it is, it is one of the scariest things I've ever seen. I think

[15:35] it destroys the American dream. I think it is against capitalism. I think that the government is a

[15:40] terrible allocator of capital in general and they're literally one tenth as efficient as the

[15:45] private sector is and so we're just going to take money out of the hands of people who are most

[15:48] effective with it. But that being said I understand, I understand the inequality that exists at the

[15:52] top, the difficulty that I have is the psychology around it which is it's just like every MLM,

[15:58] every MLM in the world, you know, they show the, they show the number one, you know person and because

[16:02] of survivorship bias people think that's going to be me. Staffs would show that is probably not going to be

[16:06] you. But just the hope, just the idea that you could someday get there is what inspires the vast majority

[16:12] of entrepreneurs. I think, I mean at least me and I think destroying that incentive and destroying that

[16:18] vision of what could happen would be a really big detriment. I don't have the best solution. I did

[16:23] say I have a couple of ideas and said these are Alex's very unpopular ideas around taxation.

[16:29] I think that and like people are going to come and crazy this. But here's two very radical ideas.

[16:34] Number one is decreasing context dramatically to zero percent and then have an enormous capital gains

[16:41] and the reason for that is because most people who are poor make money off of income, right?

[16:46] Most people who are wealthy make money off of their investment investments. And so that would be a

[16:51] I think more balanced way of helping, you know, then it would still help all of the,

[16:56] basically if you're working you should get, you'd be able to keep all the stuff that your hands

[17:00] are making for you, right? And I feel like that would be a really interesting balance to approach

[17:04] to the process, right? Because you're basically limiting how much people can make passively

[17:08] from their money and forcing more people to work. So that was, that's an idea. I'm sure there's

[17:13] plenty of holes that are always are but that was just one I was like, I can't that would be interesting.

[17:16] A different idea that I have is because most of you who know me know that I'm not a huge fan of the

[17:21] concept of legacy because you know, you multiply out your generations 5,000 years they won't know who you are,

[17:25] just like you don't know the people who you came from. And so the idea of legacy is kind of a myth when

[17:29] you expand it over a long time. And because I think that when he ruins people when you have no earned it,

[17:33] the alternative would be to have basically like 100% death tax. Decrease the taxes

[17:38] dramatically on income and capital gains throughout the entire life that someone has. But basically

[17:42] eliminate the transfers of wealth. And what that does is I think it will create a world where people

[17:48] become significantly more giving as they get older anyways because they know they can't take it with them.

[17:52] Both in the like we know we can't take it with us. But for some reason we have this deluded idea that

[17:57] we're going to be able to pass it on to people. And so I think it would force the people who know

[18:01] that the government is going to tax them. I don't think that they want all that money to go away.

[18:05] And so what will happen is that in the end of their lives they will start giving it all away and then

[18:09] privately allocating the money where they are more efficient than the government is and actually have a

[18:14] massive improvement in the well-being of society as a whole. And so think about that is like these

[18:20] these huge wealths get accumulated and then they just can't they can't just pass the generation

[18:24] to keep accumulating and accumulating it instead of just get boom back and then it helps everybody else out.

[18:28] And so that is that is actually my best is in my opinion, my best idea that I have to fix the tax

[18:35] which would be massively decreased, then come to tax, massively decreased capital, capital gains

[18:40] because I would encourage investment, it would encourage people to work, it would increase the amount of

[18:44] innovation, it would increase foreign money coming into the company, into the United States and the

[18:48] country, the death tax, the fact that you can't transfer the wealth to people with that, you can do

[18:55] 100% of your 90% whatever it is, right? Some big percentage in I'm sure you could write a little bit of

[18:59] your closet around like spouses directly or something like that. But basically not down generations,

[19:04] I think that would be a really cool way to incentivize everybody who accumulates a lot of wealth to

[19:08] end up giving it away. And the key part that I think makes it interesting is that because they will

[19:13] give it away rather than getting it taxed, they will privately allocate the money where it's

[19:18] more effectively spent than the government does. And I think that overall would flood the US with

[19:23] pretty probably all the social systems that it would need privately funded more efficiently and probably

[19:28] alternative education and the things that the people who make the most money are passionate about.

[19:32] And what's interesting here too is that the people who make lots and lots of money, first generation

[19:36] is very very different second and third generation wealth. They talk about the time, the first

[19:39] generation builds a second generation maintains that third generation destroys it. And the people who are

[19:44] builders most times, I think it's like 85%, like don't quote me, but I think it's like 85% of the

[19:49] the Forbes list are self made. And so people talk about these billionaires like they're these

[19:53] terrible people, but like they're one of us who just made it, right? And so giving those people

[19:58] typically I think start caring about everyone, the wider up you go, the higher up the, because

[20:03] you don't need to satisfy your needs anymore. You're really just trying to help humanity at this point.

[20:06] And so I think that you'd have the best, most innovative people trying to make an impact on humanity

[20:12] rather than even the legacy to their very concentrated family. Anyways, that's Alex's two cents on

[20:17] out on Joe Biden's plan. Welcome, Moseenation, if you're new, most of the times it's all about

[20:21] business stuff, this one was an exception. If you enjoyed it, let me know. If you hated it, also let me know.

[20:25] Keeping amazing. I'll see you guys next video. Bye!

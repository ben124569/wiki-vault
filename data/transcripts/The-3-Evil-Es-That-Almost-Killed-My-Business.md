[00:00] What's going on everyone? It's Alex Mozi, a CEO of Alan Prestige Labs gym launch,

[00:04] we've done $120 million in sales last four years.

[00:08] And so today what I want to talk about is the three entrepreneurial evil ease

[00:12] or a bunch of ownership.

[00:14] All right, so these are the three kind of ease that I see over and over again

[00:18] from the entrepreneurs that we work with directly in our portfolio companies,

[00:21] but also in the offers that I talk to in general.

[00:24] The biggest mistakes that are made stem from these three evil ease.

[00:28] And so what I want to do is I'm going to walk through all three of them.

[00:30] I'll tell you an easy way to try and at least attenuate the mistakes that you can make from them.

[00:35] And then at the end, I'll show you the one that I think is actually the most evil of them all.

[00:40] All right, so the first key is expectations.

[00:44] All right, and the reason that this one is so evil is that most of the time,

[00:50] us entrepreneurs, we think that everything has to happen immediately, right?

[00:54] I had an entrepreneur not that long ago reach out to me and say, hey,

[00:56] how can, if we work together, how can you guarantee that I'm going to get to a million dollars a month

[01:02] within the next six months?

[01:03] And they were currently, I think, doing a hundred thousand dollars a month.

[01:07] And that kind of expectation and mindset is literally what will destroy you in business.

[01:14] Because what happens is you set these arbitrary, because all those are arbitrary,

[01:18] for the most part, right?

[01:20] These numbers that in your mind make you feel good or make you feel accomplished.

[01:24] And you set these things up there with not a huge path of getting there.

[01:29] And you put an arbitrary timeline on it, and then you try and force yourself into it.

[01:33] And so what ends up happening is you take shortcuts, you make hasty, high-risk decisions,

[01:39] and most of the time, you end up destroying the business and taking 10 steps backwards.

[01:45] And so expectations that we set for ourselves and our teams,

[01:49] we want to be intolerant of anything other than excellence,

[01:52] but focused for more on the process than the outcome.

[01:55] So if you can shift the expectations from outcome-based expectations to process-based expectations,

[02:01] and then meet that with the intolerance of excellence, right?

[02:04] Or tolerating only excellence, this you use me, then you can help mitigate expectation evils,

[02:10] right, where you basically destroy your business as a result of thinking that you have to be

[02:16] a million dollars a month, or a hundred thousand dollars a month, or a ten thousand dollars a month,

[02:18] or whatever that number is for you by X-time, right?

[02:22] What I see again and again and again of the people who make way more money than I do

[02:26] is they have reasonable expectations that would be unreasonable to achieve

[02:32] based on process, right?

[02:34] I have a mentor right now who always represents the same thing.

[02:36] He says, good process drives good results, and I just, that's that's something I'm trying to

[02:41] be ingrained in my mind, good process drives good results.

[02:44] All right, so that's evil number one.

[02:46] The second evil is emotions, all right?

[02:51] The second thing that will kill your business, all right?

[02:53] If you look at the biggest CEOs in the world, you look at the basis, as you look at, you know,

[02:56] you look at, you look at, you look at munger, you look at buffet, you look at all these guys, right?

[03:01] And what you may notice is that they're very devoid of emotion, and it's not that they're like

[03:06] emotionless people, it's more so that they try and stay as even handed as possible with the decisions,

[03:13] and this is just something that I've observed, and so here's a telltale sign that you can tell for yourself

[03:17] if you're suffering from this, because sometimes it's hard, especially for guys,

[03:20] first to be like, I'm emotional right now, right?

[03:22] But like we're human, we have emotions.

[03:24] And so if you're, if you're looking, and you flip flop a lot on decisions, as in you're presented

[03:31] the same data, and one day you feel this way, and another way you feel another day you feel this way,

[03:35] and literally how you process decision flip flops all the time, it's because you're being subject to

[03:39] emotions. Now, if you look at the trajectory of a business and the hundreds and thousands of decisions

[03:44] that we have to make as an entrepreneur, you can see how quickly these thousands of decisions can

[03:48] spin this way or this way on this path based on your emotions, and it can be the right where the wrong way.

[03:54] And so I'll give you, here's two, two pieces to this. It's very difficult to eliminate emotions,

[04:02] right? But if you can detect when you are emotion all, then you can decrease the speed of your decision

[04:07] making, which is usually contrary to what most people do when they are emotional. They speed up

[04:11] their decision making process when they are in emotions, all right? And so if you feel urgency,

[04:16] so for me, these are these are things that are like red flags. If I feel like I have to make a decision

[04:22] by today or whatever, most times it's completely fictitious and made up in my mind. And so what I

[04:28] try and do is extend the time horizon between the feeling I have and when I actually decide to take action.

[04:34] I can't tell you the amount of huge mistakes that I was able to avoid simply by sleeping it off,

[04:40] right? Giving myself 24 hours to think on it, right? And a lot of times the entire world looks

[04:45] different when you wake up the morning. And so that should frighten you because it frightens me.

[04:49] How can the world looks so different only after nine hours of sleep, right? It's because our

[04:54] emotional state is different. And so this is a tactic that I do like a lot for managing emotions.

[05:02] So the best decisions that we make for ourselves, in my opinion, or that I have made for myself,

[05:09] have come from a state of contentment. And so there have probably been moments that's why when you

[05:14] go on vacation, you feel like you have a lot of clarity. It's because you're in the correct

[05:17] emotional state to make the right decisions because you're not operating from place of scarcity.

[05:21] Right? You're not operating from a place of half-two. You're not operating from a place of

[05:25] deficiency where I am not good enough. Right? When you're operating from a place of contentment,

[05:31] and I'm not saying you're always content. That's not my point. Right? The point is that you could

[05:35] probably recognize those times where you sit back and you're feeling grace, you know, you have a lot of

[05:39] gratitude for an experience where things that give you perspective. And so it's in those time periods

[05:46] where you should make big decisions for your life and then know that you made them in the proper

[05:53] emotional state. This is something that I'm actively focused a lot on for me because

[05:59] they're being in the correct, making the right call is basically my only job. Now it's really just

[06:05] proper decision-making. And so when I sense myself in a well-rested content, full of gratitude,

[06:12] mood, that is when I want to look at my most complex issues, my most complex multivariable

[06:17] you know decisions and say this is what I think the best course of action is. And then sticking

[06:23] with that even when the trials and tribulations that are never going to happen as a result of the

[06:28] decision later to the road. And so that's my hack. I can't get around a motion. I try and extend

[06:36] time horizons whenever I feel urgency. And then if I'm going to make emotions from an emotional

[06:42] state, I try and go from a place of contentment and gratitude and if I do not feel that state,

[06:46] I don't usually make the decision. So think about that. So if you have moments when you're playing

[06:52] with your kids and you look back and you're like, man, life's awesome, that's when you make the

[06:55] decisions that you need to make about your life. All right, because from there you'll be operating

[06:59] with a much longer time horizon. And that's I think my way, I think this this is doing it that way,

[07:05] we'll trick yourself into extending your time horizon, which ultimately will lead to better decision-making.

[07:11] And the third E of third Evol's Evaly, oops, I'm writing down Eval, is or R, excuse me,

[07:19] are expenses. All right, so the first two, one is what you think should happen,

[07:24] the emotions affect how you think it should happen. And the expenses are the, the, the,

[07:29] the, it's like the cloud and the dirt, right, are the things that that we incur along the way that

[07:33] increase the risk of it not occurring, right? So if you think about expenses in general, they are

[07:38] liabilities. They are risk that we take on. And so if our goal is entrepreneurs is to increase

[07:44] our upside and decrease our downside, right, that is kind of entrepreneurship and business in general,

[07:48] right, then actively thinking about decreasing our downside or liabilities is a way of increasing

[07:53] the likelihood that our expectations are met, right? And so one of the biggest mistakes and biggest

[08:01] evils that will destroy entrepreneurial businesses is because they set massive expectations when they

[08:07] are emotional and emotionally deficient because they need a satisfied, you know, emotional needs

[08:12] that their parents didn't meet when they were kids, they then incur expenses that they shouldn't

[08:16] otherwise have to meet these demands that are completely arbitrary and made up in their minds,

[08:21] right? And so I see this what happened all the time. It's like, hey, we want to scale,

[08:26] we just hired four more people so that we can scale. It doesn't work that way.

[08:32] Get the growth first and then the growth will pay for the people.

[08:37] Don't put the cart in front of the horse. The only exception to this is if you have like

[08:41] commission only, you know, reps, like sales reps, things like that. But most other times,

[08:48] 99% of other times, when you are incurring greater expenses, it's not like it's, it should not be

[08:58] to quote anticipate growth, right? Growth will pay the expenses and if you need to quote delay,

[09:06] something for a smaller period of time so that you can short up your infrastructure,

[09:10] then you can do that and you would be amazed at how much flexibility there is, right? It's much

[09:15] easier to solve problems with cash in the bank with with contract signed and you're an entrepreneur,

[09:23] like solving problems is what we do, right? And so if you're in that state, think about how much

[09:27] you eat like, if you need to, if you have the immediate demand, right, you will solve the problem

[09:33] and the people will come. I promise you, right? One of the biggest mistakes that I mean,

[09:38] I've made this one so many times. I hired 25 support reps and anticipation of growth

[09:45] for our supplement company, prestige labs two years ago and I currently now have four people

[09:51] that handle more business than the 25 did. Think about that. And so what happens is when you anticipate

[09:57] growth, you don't even know what the growth is going to look like and so you basically just put people

[10:02] there, the culture of the team decreases, the morale of the team decreases, they're being less

[10:06] efficient and when you have lots of people, you don't think about driving good process, right?

[10:11] You just think like we'll just throw more bodies at the problem and that's a horrible way to go

[10:15] about business. It's also not a good customer experience in the long run. And so if we can adjust

[10:21] our expectations to be reasonable and based on process, not outcome, by managing our emotions and

[10:27] making decisions from a place of contentment, right, so that we don't set these deficient

[10:32] expectations on ourselves and our business that we have to satisfy because we must

[10:36] be a certain way by this time, then we won't incur expenses in risk that is undue and

[10:41] unnecessary that will likely destroy our business when it was 100% based on our false made up

[10:49] expectations about what we thought should happen. And so when I look at the things that undo

[10:54] entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial businesses, these are the three evil ease. Expectations, emotions,

[11:00] and expenses. And I told you at the beginning that I would share the one that I think is the most

[11:04] deadly and it's this guy in my opinion, expectations. Because what we believe, because these are

[11:14] basically beliefs, just said differently, right? Another way to say this, and this is a really

[11:20] a really good way that I got from a different coach to reframe beliefs, is she said, if you just

[11:26] call all your beliefs assumptions, they will be far more malleable. And it's such a, it words matter,

[11:34] right? And if we call our beliefs assumptions, they become far more changeable for ourselves. And so

[11:39] if I say, this is my assumption, what do you guys think, rather than this is my expectation?

[11:45] What do you guys think? Yeah, different that feels, but they function the same way, right?

[11:50] But one of them is approachable. One of them is malleable. One of them can take new feedback

[11:54] and new inputs and new data. And the other one is, it must, it should, it have to. Right? And so,

[12:01] if we can readjust our expectations, right? And be focused on our product over delivering,

[12:08] delighting the customers, right? Being intolerant of anything but excellence in the process.

[12:13] And because of that, our emotions stay more stable because we're not missing goals that we have to hit,

[12:20] right? Which then create more scarcity, more deficiency, more, more gutteral feelings that then

[12:26] make us shorten our decision making loops that cause poorer decisions and then cause us to make

[12:31] poorer decisions that create expenses. All right? So this is a loop that self-reinforces and it can

[12:36] either be a virtuous or vicious cycle. And so it starts at the top and spins all the way around.

[12:41] And so those are the three evil ease of entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial mistakes that hopefully

[12:45] you can use some of these tactics to avoid. All right? Don't, don't hire before you need it,

[12:52] let the growth pay for the expenses. When you're making decisions, trying extend the space. This is

[12:59] what I found effective for me and trying make decisions from a point of gratitude and contentment.

[13:05] And then keep the expectations driven around process, not outcome. And if you can keep the

[13:10] high expectations, keep your high expectations, but keep them on process, not only has to happen

[13:15] because when you reverse it the other way, you'll start making terrible decisions. So anyways,

[13:20] I hope that was valuable for you. I hope that makes sense. Like, subscribe, all the all the

[13:25] dings and whistles that YouTube folks are supposed to say. So anyways, lots of love, keep being

[13:30] awesome. I'll catch you guys on the flip side. Bye!

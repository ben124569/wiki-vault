## Full Transcript
[00:00] In this video, I'm going to write down how I learned how to consistently generate leads,

[00:03] independent of platforms.

[00:04] And the key piece that I was missing in multiple different platforms,

[00:07] I'm going to tell you five key stories that my life that massively impacted how

[00:11] affected my marketing was as a result of the exchange.

[00:14] And if you don't know why I am my name is Ashmozi, my business investor and

[00:17] I have an acquisition.com.

[00:18] So portfolio companies does about $85 million a year.

[00:21] I make these videos have to document the lessons that I've had and hopefully make

[00:24] sure that the pain that I suffered on the way here was not in vain.

[00:28] So if you're new to Mozi Nation, welcome and enjoy the video.

[00:30] In this video, I'm going to walk you through why you are probably not getting the results that you wish you were from what you were doing.

[00:36] One of the most misunderstood concepts that create success in some people and

[00:40] failure without understanding why in most others.

[00:43] All right.

[00:44] And it really all underpins volume.

[00:45] So let's dive in.

[00:46] So a few high level observations provide to have into this.

[00:49] The first thing is there's a setting in our community called De the Boring work.

[00:52] And a lot of times we don't confront the work that we that must be done,

[00:55] because it's not exciting or sexy.

[00:57] And it feels somehow like it's beneath us.

[00:59] You know, prospecting and doing a hundred dollars a day can feel tedious.

[01:03] You know, posting and repurposing the same content across lots of community sources can feel tedious.

[01:08] You know, reaching out to people you know and asking that if they know someone who might be interested in your products or

[01:13] services might feel tedious or creating, you know,

[01:15] 100 different ad variations with different hooks and headlines can seem tedious.

[01:20] It's very easy to understand very hard to do.

[01:22] Most of us people don't have the discipline and the work ethic to go through the Boring work,

[01:26] which kind of leads the second one here,

[01:28] which is that there's a saying between my closest friend and I Dr. Cashe,

[01:32] violence is the answer.

[01:33] Sometimes when you have this outcome that you must achieve in your life,

[01:37] because of the goals and insecurities that we have set upon ourselves,

[01:40] that just being violent with the level of activity that we are doing,

[01:43] ultimately get as much closer than, you know,

[01:46] the nuances and the skill that sometimes we like to project and pretend,

[01:50] matter more than just physically doing a sheer higher volume of work.

[01:54] Number three is that if you do more than you are doing right now,

[01:57] you will get more than you currently have.

[01:58] And that is a promise that you can take that to the bank.

[02:00] And number four is do what matters most first.

[02:03] So right now you probably have lots of things that you know fill up your day in the morning,

[02:06] all that kind of stuff.

[02:07] But the things there are only four activities that will actually generate more business for you,

[02:11] period that is new.

[02:12] All right.

[02:13] Number one is reaching out to people you know.

[02:14] Number two is posting to an audience that you know.

[02:17] Number three is reaching out to people who you don't know what I want.

[02:20] And number four is advertising, right?

[02:22] There's the four only four ways that you can get new clients.

[02:24] And so if you're not doing one of those four things and you're struggling to get customers,

[02:28] you're not doing lots of those four things as your primary activities,

[02:30] then that is probably one of the reasons that you don't have the amount of customers that you wish you have.

[02:34] All right.

[02:34] And so what I want to do is take this quick moment to introduce an equation that I thought a lot about,

[02:39] but it's feed time's time state.

[02:41] So volume time skills times time.

[02:42] And this is kind of a flywheel that feeds itself and which,

[02:47] and I'll get to the actual like wording behind this,

[02:49] but essentially the more volume to do the better you are and longer you do it,

[02:53] the more throughput you will ultimately have.

[02:55] The more outcome, the more clients, the more sales, the more leads you will ultimately have from doing it.

[03:01] All right.

[03:01] So let's dive into this in a little bit more.

[03:03] So in other words,

[03:04] and this is based on just like pure foundational principles of logic, right?

[03:06] The more we do, the better we get,

[03:09] the better we did,

[03:10] the more we do because we like it because we're better at it, right?

[03:13] And the longer we do something, the better we get, the better we get,

[03:17] the longer we do it, right?

[03:19] And I'll show you a couple examples in some of the stories in examples I have today

[03:23] that will show you how compounding massively affects it in my life.

[03:26] And so in this way,

[03:27] each of these three variables volume,

[03:29] skill and time feed each other,

[03:30] but it all starts with doing.

[03:33] And so these three,

[03:35] we're going to focus just on volume today because I want to be mindful of your time.

[03:38] And so until you quick example of this.

[03:40] So I,

[03:41] when this is probably a decade ago,

[03:43] I'll start in my gym,

[03:44] I'm just the first business scientist,

[03:45] a real business scientist.

[03:47] Someone's like, oh, she wrote flyers and I was like,

[03:48] okay, cool.

[03:49] So I went out,

[03:50] I did a bunch of flyers,

[03:52] and it didn't really work for me.

[03:53] And so a few months later,

[03:55] I was talking to a friend of mine who had multiple successful locations,

[03:59] he was doing well.

[03:59] And I was like, hey,

[04:01] you know,

[04:02] he's like, you should do flyers and I was like,

[04:03] nah, I did that, it didn't work for me.

[04:05] He's like, well,

[04:06] what was your test size?

[04:08] And I was like,

[04:09] test size.

[04:10] What do you mean?

[04:11] He was like, well,

[04:11] how many did you test before you, you know,

[04:13] scale it up?

[04:13] And I was like, well,

[04:14] I mean, I put 300 out and he was like,

[04:16] 300,

[04:17] like total.

[04:18] And I was like, oh, yeah.

[04:19] He's like,

[04:20] I don't even,

[04:20] he's like,

[04:21] I don't even test for less than 5,000 flyers.

[04:23] And all of a sudden,

[04:24] I was like, whoa,

[04:25] he's like, yeah,

[04:26] he's like,

[04:26] I put out a hundred thousand flyers a month.

[04:28] He's like,

[04:29] and I'm going to half a percent

[04:30] or a percent back.

[04:31] He's like,

[04:32] who walked through the door.

[04:33] He's like,

[04:33] give it,

[04:34] 100,000 flyers a percent back.

[04:36] I get 30 people a day walking in my store.

[04:38] And I was like,

[04:38] holy cow,

[04:39] my understanding of the sheer volume

[04:42] for the activity that I thought

[04:44] wasn't working was just dramatically

[04:46] under what it really was supposed to be.

[04:48] And in that moment,

[04:49] I had a belief broken about what volume really means.

[04:52] This happens all the time.

[04:53] And we'll tell you a couple other examples in a second.

[04:56] But like,

[04:56] this happens all the time.

[04:57] You've been like fitness stuff.

[04:58] People were like,

[04:58] man,

[04:58] why can't I get jacked?

[04:59] And I'm like,

[05:00] you know,

[05:00] why can't I grow my arms?

[05:02] It's like,

[05:02] all right,

[05:02] well,

[05:02] I'm going to set some arms

[05:03] you doing every week.

[05:04] And they're like,

[05:04] well,

[05:04] I train our twice a week and like,

[05:06] what do you do?

[05:06] They're like,

[05:06] well,

[05:06] you know,

[05:07] like three sets 10.

[05:07] And I'm like,

[05:08] is that like per week?

[05:09] Like,

[05:09] so six total sets.

[05:11] And like,

[05:11] yeah,

[05:11] I'm like,

[05:12] well,

[05:12] try 12 sets,

[05:14] six days a week.

[05:14] And I guarantee your arms will grow.

[05:16] And they're like,

[05:16] seriously?

[05:17] I'm like,

[05:18] yeah,

[05:19] imagine that.

[05:20] The more you do,

[05:21] the more you look like you can do.

[05:22] So I'll give you a different one that I had.

[05:24] This isn't in a pain as example,

[05:26] which is similar to flyers

[05:27] as a different platform.

[05:28] I had an agency owner

[05:30] who was walking,

[05:31] who was talking to us within our software company.

[05:33] And he was like,

[05:33] hey,

[05:34] you know,

[05:34] my leaflist on you

[05:35] and I can't see the scale above a certain map.

[05:37] And I was like,

[05:37] okay,

[05:38] well,

[05:38] you know,

[05:38] how many pieces of creative

[05:39] are you putting out,

[05:40] you know,

[05:41] per week?

[05:42] And he was like,

[05:42] he's,

[05:43] he confidently answered.

[05:44] Right?

[05:45] So he was like,

[05:45] he was like,

[05:45] oh,

[05:46] he's like,

[05:46] that we have on point.

[05:47] He's like,

[05:47] we're putting out like five to 10 pieces of content a week.

[05:49] And I was like,

[05:50] per week.

[05:51] He was like,

[05:51] yeah,

[05:52] and I was like,

[05:52] dude,

[05:53] and I scrolled over,

[05:54] I shared my screen of my creative department.

[05:56] And I was like,

[05:57] we're testing 30 pieces every three days.

[06:00] He was like,

[06:01] what?

[06:02] I was like,

[06:02] yeah,

[06:03] it's level of output,

[06:05] quantity of output,

[06:06] the level,

[06:07] the most people dramatically underestimate how much work

[06:10] it takes to make money.

[06:11] Right?

[06:11] The thing is,

[06:12] is once you understand,

[06:13] and for most people,

[06:14] and this is the point that I've opened

[06:15] somebody who's like,

[06:16] has it got on their first customer,

[06:18] or wants to start on a new channel,

[06:19] if you already have one working,

[06:20] is you usually need to do a lot more

[06:23] because you're so s in that equation,

[06:24] your skill level is low,

[06:26] and you have no time that has compounded for you.

[06:28] So you must compensate with extraordinary volume,

[06:31] so that you can learn the skill,

[06:33] and then begin the compounding process

[06:35] that will give you the throughput

[06:36] or outcome that you desire.

[06:37] And so a lot of times,

[06:39] you gotta do a lot more in the beginning

[06:41] to get the ball rolling.

[06:42] All right?

[06:43] And when I was talking to Grant about his,

[06:45] his overarching constant strategy,

[06:47] I was like,

[06:47] hey, man,

[06:48] you know,

[06:48] how many pieces,

[06:49] what's the framework that you use?

[06:50] And he was like,

[06:51] bro,

[06:51] and this is actually,

[06:52] this was in a different call

[06:53] I had with him than that.

[06:54] It's not not on the channel.

[06:55] He's like, bro,

[06:55] if someone's trying to sell you a framework,

[06:57] he's like,

[06:57] but just trying to sell you something.

[06:58] He's like,

[06:59] it's about 10x,

[07:00] and he said that,

[07:01] and he wasn't saying it in a,

[07:03] in a pejorative way,

[07:04] he meant it genuinely,

[07:05] he's like,

[07:05] dude,

[07:05] he's like,

[07:06] we just take massive action.

[07:07] He's like,

[07:08] we just trying to be omnipresent.

[07:10] He's like,

[07:10] look at your Instagram,

[07:11] look at my Instagram,

[07:12] so we pull both of them up.

[07:13] And he's like,

[07:13] I'm posting six times a day.

[07:15] He's like,

[07:15] I'm posting 15 times a day on Twitter.

[07:18] And he's like,

[07:18] you just pull up every one of them

[07:20] compared to them to mind.

[07:21] He's like,

[07:21] he's like,

[07:21] I'm just doing way more than you.

[07:22] And I was like,

[07:23] man,

[07:24] and he's been doing it

[07:25] for 10 years longer.

[07:27] Right?

[07:27] And so that was a huge epiphany for me.

[07:29] And then for me,

[07:30] I switched from one time

[07:32] we told him in times of the day.

[07:33] And here's what's crazy.

[07:34] My growth organically,

[07:36] 40x from a 7x increase in effort.

[07:40] So there is a multiplicative effect here,

[07:42] because sure we did more,

[07:43] but we got better at the doing.

[07:45] And then the more we did,

[07:47] the more each of those other pieces

[07:48] fed one another.

[07:49] Right?

[07:50] And so again,

[07:50] all of this starts with the doing

[07:52] and taking a lot more,

[07:53] than most people anticipate

[07:55] to get the result and get going.

[07:56] And so this is a different nuance on volume.

[07:59] This is more level of effort.

[08:01] But I think it bears mentioning

[08:03] because for this concept

[08:05] to kind of sink in,

[08:06] I want to hit it from a couple different angles.

[08:08] So this is the number one video

[08:09] at this time is one of the number

[08:11] videos on the channel.

[08:12] And I made this like a month ago.

[08:13] And I realized that

[08:15] quality most times trumps quantity.

[08:18] Right?

[08:18] And the thing is,

[08:19] but quality and quantity

[08:21] trumps just quantity, right?

[08:23] Or just quality.

[08:24] And so this particular piece of content

[08:27] took me 20 hours to actually put the slide deck

[08:29] together.

[08:29] And then two days of travel to go film.

[08:31] And then go on low and behold,

[08:33] ends up being the number one thing on there.

[08:34] And to me,

[08:35] I was like,

[08:35] well,

[08:35] that's not really surprising.

[08:37] I spent a ton of time on this.

[08:38] And so it was just,

[08:39] and like,

[08:40] I'm just saying that I get reminded

[08:41] of this at all levels of the game.

[08:43] You know what I mean?

[08:44] And so I'm making these videos

[08:45] because like,

[08:46] as I'm learning it,

[08:47] I'm sharing it.

[08:48] So that hopefully it provides some values.

[08:50] You like,

[08:50] it just takes a lot more work

[08:52] than most people think.

[08:52] Like,

[08:53] Layla,

[08:53] this is four or five years ago

[08:54] when we were refilling an entire

[08:56] constant portal.

[08:57] So she had probably reported

[08:59] God,

[08:59] I don't know,

[09:00] 70 or so videos with,

[09:02] you know,

[09:02] training's in everything.

[09:03] And she got down and she was like,

[09:04] how do they think these are that good?

[09:06] And she was like,

[09:07] it was like,

[09:08] she's like,

[09:09] I just,

[09:09] I don't know,

[09:10] I don't know if they're like hitting the way.

[09:11] I want them to be.

[09:12] They're like,

[09:12] just not as crisp.

[09:13] And we sat at their,

[09:14] and I was like,

[09:16] doing again.

[09:17] She looked at me and she was like,

[09:18] yeah, you're right.

[09:19] Because the thing is is like,

[09:20] and I've said this before and I'll keep saying

[09:22] that like,

[09:22] your work work something you more

[09:24] than you work on it.

[09:24] The thing we're developing is our character.

[09:26] Because that's the ultimate prize

[09:28] that we get at the end of the race.

[09:29] Right?

[09:29] We can't keep the stuff that we have with us.

[09:31] And so we're doing this work

[09:33] to become better people.

[09:34] Right?

[09:34] And so if you do it again,

[09:36] it's no,

[09:36] it's nothing bad about it.

[09:38] You're just like,

[09:38] cool,

[09:38] I get more practice at doing

[09:40] the thing and my S is going to get better

[09:42] in the throughput equation.

[09:43] And so even if you did the same in terms

[09:45] of volume of output,

[09:46] the skill on the equation,

[09:48] the S is going to be higher.

[09:50] So you're still going to actually

[09:51] still get more throughput,

[09:52] even if you do the same effort again.

[09:53] Right?

[09:54] And so that's why the level of effort

[09:56] and giving a shit,

[09:58] for a lack of a retirement,

[09:59] really working like violence is the answer

[10:01] doing the boring work

[10:02] and putting the time under the bar end

[10:04] to use a fitness analogy,

[10:05] is what is required

[10:08] and most people dramatically underestimate

[10:10] the volume.

[10:10] All right?

[10:11] And so I'm going to tell you

[10:12] this last one to wrap this little piece up,

[10:17] which is I wrote this book, right?

[10:18] And it took me basically like a year

[10:20] and write it.

[10:21] It took me two weeks to write it,

[10:22] it took me a year to edit it.

[10:23] And right now,

[10:24] I get DMs every day like,

[10:25] what is the second book coming out?

[10:27] And so right now I'm on the fifth version

[10:28] of book two end to end.

[10:29] I had a completely copy,

[10:31] copy,

[10:31] right,

[10:32] edited from a professional editor

[10:34] and that was version one.

[10:35] And I've since made four more versions

[10:37] since then.

[10:38] But the thing is,

[10:38] is the difference between that level

[10:40] of effort is why

[10:41] many times I think things don't work out.

[10:44] Is that most people put like a seven

[10:46] out of 10 effort or an eight out of 10 effort

[10:48] and then look at somebody who put a 10 out of 10 effort in

[10:50] and think, well,

[10:51] I didn't put that much less effort in,

[10:52] but you don't realize the difference

[10:54] between an eight and a 10

[10:55] might be five times the work.

[10:56] But also the difference between an eight and a 10

[10:58] might be a hundred times the outcome.

[11:00] And so the actual net outcome

[11:02] on the incremental increase in work

[11:04] is still worth it.

[11:06] That's what's crazy.

[11:07] Is that if it takes five times the effort

[11:09] to go from an eight to a 10,

[11:10] you might get a hundred times

[11:12] even though you only did five times more work.

[11:14] And so this is one of these beliefs

[11:16] that I've even gained in myself within

[11:19] how we do business,

[11:20] but I'm sharing it with you

[11:21] because most things that most people make suck.

[11:23] Most products suck,

[11:24] most marketing sucks,

[11:26] most businesses suck.

[11:27] And most people suck at the things

[11:28] that they think they're good at.

[11:29] Right?

[11:30] And it's because they don't even know

[11:31] how to work.

[11:32] They don't even know how to do it.

[11:34] And I'll tell you this final story

[11:35] I grabbed this up.

[11:36] When I was a legal intern in a past lifetime

[11:39] at a chemical company called ArcMA in France,

[11:41] believe it or not.

[11:41] I work there in the legal department

[11:43] and this older more experienced senior lawyer

[11:46] at the firm,

[11:47] and the department,

[11:48] kind of like tap.

[11:49] I was like,

[11:50] oh, I'm gonna go back to work.

[11:51] And she like tap my shoulder.

[11:52] She was like,

[11:53] you don't even know how to work.

[11:54] And I was like,

[11:55] what do you mean?

[11:55] And she was like,

[11:56] you're so young.

[11:57] She's like,

[11:57] you don't even know what work really is.

[12:00] And it just hit me and it struck me

[12:03] like to my core because I was like,

[12:04] how can she tell me that I don't know how to work?

[12:06] But here I am 10 years 15 years later

[12:08] I think to myself like,

[12:09] man,

[12:09] I had no idea what work even looked like

[12:11] because I don't even know how to focus the way I do know.

[12:13] I didn't know how to eliminate distractions.

[12:14] I didn't know what it looked like to just put rep after rep

[12:17] after rep after rep in to just get that thing just right.

[12:21] The beautiful thing,

[12:22] especially when it comes to marketing stuff is that when you make

[12:24] those,

[12:25] each of those posts,

[12:26] each of those outreach is each of those calls,

[12:28] each of those ads that you run,

[12:30] make you better.

[12:31] They increase the S.

[12:32] And so in that way,

[12:34] the V,

[12:34] the S and the T,

[12:35] the volume,

[12:36] the skill and the time work on

[12:37] each other and then you do a higher

[12:39] throughput because they're a multiplicative,

[12:41] not additive.

[12:42] And that's like the one thing that if I can drive this home,

[12:45] is that most people just do so much last volume,

[12:47] then they think.

[12:48] Because,

[12:48] and then they look at the vehicle that they're using and think,

[12:51] why is it not working when the reality was that you weren't working?

[12:54] Because you did not know how much work really was required to get

[12:57] to where you wanted to go.

[12:58] And so with that,

[13:00] in other words,

[13:01] most times you just need to do more than what you're currently doing

[13:03] in a lot more of it.

[13:05] Okay,

[13:05] so if you don't know me,

[13:06] like I said,

[13:07] when it's auctionevolacy.

[13:08] I would actposition.com or business investors,

[13:10] our portfolio does about $85 million a year.

[13:12] If you enjoyed this video,

[13:13] watch another one and lots of love either way.

[13:15] Most of the nation,

[13:16] keep rocking.

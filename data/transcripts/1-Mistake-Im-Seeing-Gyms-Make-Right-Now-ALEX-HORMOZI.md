[00:00] I see so many Jimwiners make the exact same mistake again and again and it's forgetting how to position stuff to sell

[00:19] Big picture typically the biggest ones for service based facilities is actually like February and March

[00:24] But I think that's just kind of the compound effect of host near-solution for big box gyms

[00:31] Where they actually sell memberships January tends to be the biggest month because usually what happens to someone goes there

[00:36] They fail with in three or four weeks and they realize they need more help and that's when you know

[00:40] PT sales etc. pick up February and March now that being said does not mean you should not absolutely dominate January

[00:46] So what I want to go through is the number of states that I'm seeing just make right now

[00:51] And it's kind of

[00:53] I don't want to say it's cute because it's not cute but like

[00:57] I see so many Jimwiners make the exact same mistake again and again and it's forgetting how to position stuff to sell

[01:04] And so what I do is kind of give you a little bit of a countdown of how to

[01:08] Create hype that's going to

[01:10] Allow you to sell more people into your gym more people in your programs, etc

[01:15] It's kind of either the framework for how I've done it right and so the framework that I have is the same framework that I used last year

[01:22] And right after we did this kind of launch hype framework for prestige labs the Southern Company

[01:27] I would have 2.4 million in five weeks, right?

[01:31] And so and everyone that I was who is doing that with us all the gym works for doing it or modeling the exact same process, all right?

[01:37] So

[01:38] The big mistake that I see everyone make is they just post and they're like by my shit

[01:43] Hey, sign up for my shit. Hey, sign up for my shit

[01:46] And it's it's really ad hoc. It's not

[01:49] deliberate and there's no

[01:51] Questions or information or belief that are being addressed. It's just like hey by my shit

[01:56] Like hey by my shit like brain doesn't work

[01:59] So the process you have to go through I heard this recently. I don't know who it's from but

[02:05] Whisper T's shout and I actually just really liked the way that that sounded

[02:09] In terms of how to promote stuff, right and so like we just launched meals, right?

[02:15] And so if you were if you were trying to launch a new program

[02:18] 42 days you're at a new year new year you or whatever right

[02:22] You're gonna start a little further out and you're not gonna be marketing nearly as much

[02:26] It's just enough. It's a whisper right and so for me

[02:29] I think the best place to do that is in your warmer audience

[02:32] So that's like your free group or your gym, you know your your clients group, et cetera

[02:35] You can just make a post with a big countdown type or and like the logo of the challenge, right?

[02:39] It doesn't have to be more than that and mind you might not even have the thing already yet

[02:43] You don't need to you should have the freaking graphic right?

[02:46] So just post that you even need to put any any copy around it. It just be like it is coming and then everyone will get super excited about it

[02:53] Right a week later you can do the same things

[02:55] You know with last days on the countdown again, right? We're talking like a month out

[03:00] now the heavy marketing for me

[03:03] When I start anymore than a month out starting to heavily market it I think you kind of backfired

[03:07] I feel like a crescendo to early

[03:09] So I feel like I feel like 10 to 14 days is where like you crescendo into like max hype

[03:15] And so putting like the post out a month out and then nothing else maybe one email one post a week later

[03:22] One email one post and then now

[03:25] You're into the last kind of 14 day cycle and at that point then you can really start marketing

[03:30] I usually do it in a 10 day countdown because maybe I don't like writing as many emails or I just feel like

[03:36] People are people have so short of attention spans that like I don't think you need to keep something top of mine for a very long time

[03:41] I think it's just like keep it top of mine for 10 days and then lunch if they right?

[03:44] So

[03:46] What is the process

[03:48] In in that kind of 10 day window so

[03:51] There's kind of the five five or six emails that go out. I like every other day. We're fine for me

[03:56] And I probably do it that way because again. I don't like writing tons of emails

[04:00] But if you're starting 10 days out you're like email one, you know day off email two day off email three

[04:07] That tends to work very well and what you're trying to do is just try to adjust in ahead of like ahead of time

[04:12] What concerns someone might have right the things that they would get excited about what is in it for them?

[04:17] Right

[04:18] And typically you should be making a progress strategy to address certain pains that everyone experiences right?

[04:22] So it's like don't like if you're including meal prep for example

[04:26] It's like don't have time to cook don't have time to count your macros don't have time to go like so

[04:30] They're gonna basically exaggerate or aggravate the pain associated with just buying your own food with just you know

[04:38] Whatever, right and if you were selling something that was just like like short

[04:41] We lost our meal program that's why I was to talk with that but like if you were

[04:45] launching because you're training stuff right your your services

[04:48] So instead it's like

[04:50] Aggraating the pain around going to the gym figuring out what to do walk around aimlessly having people judge you and stare

[04:56] You wondering what you're gonna be doing next and then all the while giving up and then's going on the treadmill where you can board with

[05:02] In 10 minutes and then leave a shame to yourself right so like that's where we're talking about like

[05:07] Okay, we're gonna talk in terms of the customer and about the things that they're struggling with now

[05:10] If you're program addresses multiple of those facets then have each email address like the nutrition component

[05:17] I'm trying to figure out meal

[05:18] I'm all the ball right and then the fitness part about going along with Jim not knowing what you're doing and then like the accountability part of

[05:25] Like not wanting to not being motivated not having somebody to like help you out

[05:30] You know like all of that kind of stuff right so you hit into those emails and you basically can just recycle them through again and you know

[05:36] Lean in on one aspect because reality is that not everyone's gonna read all your emails

[05:40] And sometimes it's better to be reminded than talk right and so it's okay to recycle the same thing kind of hit the same points again

[05:45] Just say it in different ways

[05:47] All right, so that's kind of like if you had three points you could have like an intro email and then point one two three and then

[05:53] Point one and two and point two and three and then

[05:55] Kind of a beginning of the crescendo because at that point if you had six emails and you'd have like day 10 8 6 4 2

[06:02] And now you have one and zero zero being launched it right so

[06:06] Dig one is gonna be like hey 24 hours left

[06:09] You don't even need to put any copy in here. It's just like hey get ready to watch me sick super excited get ready to sign up right now

[06:15] On lunch day all right really important I

[06:18] If anybody saw for the meals I email like six times on that day, right?

[06:22] And I've got that from Frank Kern I got that from Russell. I got that from every big internet market

[06:26] I know is that on lunch day the email like six times and they're like the reason we do that is because we want it to be on the top of their inbox

[06:32] And they see it like it's just like you even have to have copy in it. You'd be like four hours left

[06:36] That's not and you're like your body copy can be like see subject

[06:40] Right like you just want them to see the inbox right now

[06:44] If you have

[06:45] Phone numbers for all these people you can also do this concurrently

[06:50] With tax messages right now if you're like I don't want to sell via webinar

[06:55] Which you probably should it and by probably I mean definitely don't fucking do that if you're in person business

[06:59] All right, so please god like oh, it doesn't have us do which he does because he's trying to hold something back from us

[07:03] No, if I had a fucking in person business I would sell in person

[07:07] duh

[07:08] I would use the biggest advantage ever of having trust face to face

[07:12] Anyways, sorry little side no

[07:15] Anyways, so you're doing your countdown right now you have your text going on top of that now the text need to be super short

[07:23] And you're basically trying to distill down like that entire email until like one bullet right now

[07:29] The last like 48 hours which you're trying to push is gonna be the link for them to like sign up for the thing

[07:37] Right now you don't need to buy the thing like if you're if you're like the easiest thing

[07:40] You just have them opt in and then schedule a time or just have them straight schedule a time if it's a if it's a warm list

[07:45] If it's like you were your client list it's that or you can have them to straight

[07:49] Schedule a time sign with you because they're probably not gonna know show you right and so at that point

[07:53] You can at everyone sign up for the thing so that you can have one on two consultations every 30 minutes

[08:00] And it's like men Alex it sounds like a lot of work. I'm telling you every single time like don't be cute

[08:06] Don't get fancy this is the best way to launch your facility have a huge

[08:11] Moments is starting and if you want to also include the referral part like which you definitely should

[08:17] Right like tell them to bring a friend with them to the orientation

[08:20] You can you can close the friend and get them signed up because like if they're coming with someone

[08:23] They're not gonna not buy unless you're absolutely idiot right so like have them bring people with them

[08:29] They can schedule for themselves and just bring their friend with them. It just makes it logistically very easy. All right

[08:33] So

[08:35] Big recap

[08:36] Here's what to do and what not to do all right

[08:39] So if you're trying to promote something new don't just feel like hey here's anything click the link

[08:43] Sign up hey here's anything click like new like having sequence whisper it

[08:49] Teas it build excitement right then in the 10 days leading up to like your

[08:55] Registration opening or were you open up your calendar at that point is where you go every other day email address their beliefs

[09:02] And then text if you are allowed to the same thing kind of on the off day

[09:06] So if you email on day 10 text on day nine email on the eight text on the seven and that way you have this nice cadence

[09:13] Inside of Facebook groups were I've seen in terms of posting cadence

[09:16] I really stick to the once a week because like it takes like two days for a post like I feel like it's seen by everyone

[09:23] And if I post like

[09:24] More than once a week it just feels like aggressive and people are still liking the old posts

[09:29] I just I've just done once a week and then with the exceptions the last week

[09:33] I'll do a I'll do a 24 hour

[09:36] Reminder on Thursday

[09:38] If I'm doing like a long-term fraud air something like that so that way it's like they'll get a four weeks out three weeks out two weeks out one week out

[09:45] And then 24 hour reminder

[09:47] In the post so if you're if you're keeping track at home here

[09:49] There's basically three channels on communicating on all right. I've got my texts. I've got my emails

[09:54] Then I've got my Facebook posts all right and the Facebook posts the first two are really just whispered

[09:59] I don't really say anything and then the last

[10:02] Two before the 24 hour countdown is me kind of doing a high level overview of how Google program is and all that kind of stuff

[10:09] Right and so that is how you want to promote stuff

[10:13] All right now I think the reason that people get hung up on this is especially if they're excited about something

[10:18] It seems like something that they want to do they're like I can't believe anyone wouldn't want to do this thing

[10:23] Right it's like I'm seeing it right now with meals right

[10:25] Which is funny because like every which you're being said about me

[10:28] But think it's just like the rules of selling don't change right and so I had a gym owner who came up to us

[10:34] I want to come up to me at one of my one of our masterminds recently is like hey man

[10:37] I just bought this 20 thousand copies of equipment

[10:40] It's this EMS body suit thing and he's like so how do I sell it?

[10:43] And I was like the exact same way you sell everything else clarify why they're there like we said no, no, but like how do I sell this thing?

[10:49] I was like you don't because no one cares

[10:51] There's literally like are they trying to lose weight?

[10:54] Yes cool

[10:55] So they're gonna need to exercise and you can work out the fact that you're using this thing makes no difference whether it's

[11:00] Cycle you know or it's spin or it's kickboxing or you know

[11:04] You know whatever we lifting crossfit whatever it doesn't matter just doesn't matter right and so

[11:11] Anyways, he was like really sure he's like how do I sell like he literally kept coming back to him like six times and I was like do

[11:16] Like it doesn't fucking matter and so finally I was like listen the only thing that this can do

[11:21] I was like the big selling point is that it only takes two two sessions for 20 minutes twice week right and he was like yeah

[11:26] I was like then the only thing that you're gonna set like that you can have an addition to this is a benefit is that it takes us time

[11:31] I was like that's it is not like that's all

[11:34] So it just takes less commitment on their side

[11:36] Which you can increase the value of what you're selling because they need to do less

[11:39] They need to be here for fewer hours of the week that's all right

[11:43] But he thought he had to have like a whole different pitch just like no man like it's the same game right

[11:48] So don't make that mistake when you're trying to market your new programs don't think because this thing is so awesome

[11:55] I think it's so awesome people are just going to be

[11:57] Considate because it's so awesome

[11:59] Unfortunately people don't think that way right and you still have to do and set this point

[12:04] I feel like it's the dance of sales because like honestly like I wish I didn't have to make big pitch decks

[12:10] You know, I mean that taking me like three days to make but I understand that like as humans we like being sold

[12:15] We want to be sold people like buying stuff think about it. Do you like buying stuff for your cell like do you enjoy going and buying stuff for yourself?

[12:25] Yes, and so what we have to do is just allow people to do that and just take them through the dance that they want us to take them through

[12:32] All right, so the little anticipation whisper it first then tease it then shout it

[12:39] Which is gonna be the last you know three days where you're just pumping it and making sure that everyone sees it and here's the reality

[12:45] I said a bunch of box the foods people that I that are just friends of mine who've been falling you know forever and

[12:51] One person I text I was like hey man. I was like how'd you like that food and

[12:56] He was like oh shit that was you and I was like

[12:58] Where the fuck have you been? I was like how did you not like what and so then I just realized it was just like a nice reminder of myself

[13:07] Is that like you can market your face off and still there will be people who don't see jack shit

[13:12] Right and so any

[13:14] He'll I hope you guys have an amazing Friday make sure now

[13:18] What the final warning with this is that if right now? You're like oh, I've got this thing

[13:22] That's gonna start in three days if you have done this wrong right? I

[13:26] Honestly would recommend you take 10 days from now and just make that a little bit of your hype and then follow that process at least the last 10 days

[13:33] All right

[13:34] If you don't you're gonna be really underwhelmed with how poorly it's gonna do and you're gonna be really disappointed

[13:39] Oh my god, I wasted you right right so don't do that

[13:43] Now in terms of I saw some questions in my own group so I was able to say them now

[13:47] If it's like what should I do externally versus internally?

[13:49] You can do both the same thing or you can do them different. It's up to you. It doesn't really matter

[13:53] Right like as on like you do a 42 day shred

[13:56] It's gonna work externally and it's only if you're doing a six week new you know new year new you

[14:01] Doesn't matter it's gonna work externally and interly and the other day the people who are your clients are gonna trust you

[14:06] No matter what and they're gonna want to do whatever the thing is like they're like

[14:10] Hey, Rosie you do you want to come like do this whole 30 with me and they'll be like no

[14:14] I'm like I'm at Alex's gym. I'm sure he's gonna have something. I'll just do it every other day

[14:18] Right like you have trust with your clients like just do the dance that they want you to do

[14:23] Make them feel excited about buying the thing that you're going to have them buy so that they get more bought into it

[14:28] And ultimately get better results so anyways, I hope you have an amazing Friday

[14:32] I hope you follow these things and don't make the mistakes that I just said like you have to promote

[14:37] You have to do it the right way and if you don't do it that way

[14:40] Then you will be really sad and less people who's wait and you'll be you know sat face the manager

[14:44] What you don't want to make all right because especially because it's easily avoidable all right?

[14:48] So tag people like this anybody who has to help you with this stuff do it

[14:54] They were a prestige labs or done for emails affiliate lucky for you

[14:58] We've already made all these emails and texts for you so you can just take them and use them

[15:02] And so anyways you're welcome to do that if you so desire which you can go to affiliate

[15:07] That prestige labs calm you can just steal everything for free. All right, so anyways have an amazing day

[15:12] And I'll catch you guys on the flip side. All right

[00:00] like why does life need to be meaningful?

[00:01] It doesn't.

[00:02] A lot of Olympians have huge depression after they get a gold

[00:05] because now what?

[00:07] Like of course if he doesn't make you happy, you suck at it.

[00:09] You know the day to day, what is that to make you feel happy?

[00:13] Yeah, well right off the bed,

[00:15] I don't optimize for subjective wellbeing.

[00:16] I do that more for the audience.

[00:18] That's never been a gold of mine.

[00:20] I think when I was 19 or 20, I said fuck happiness

[00:22] and I pretty much stuck with that.

[00:23] There's two concepts I'll bring up on this.

[00:29] So one is people who want to be happy, treat it like,

[00:35] I want to eat so good, I've never hungry again.

[00:39] Or I want to sleep so well, I never need to sleep again.

[00:43] But I think happiness is much more like that

[00:48] than it is, this achievement thing

[00:51] that you like check a box.

[00:52] So I've just really worked that way.

[00:54] Secondly, I think that all the people that I know

[00:57] who obsess about happiness are the least happy people.

[01:01] Outwardly sure, but they're the ones who are like committing suicide.

[01:05] I worry about that because that it's a goal

[01:07] that by having it as a goal, it automatically sits outside of you,

[01:11] which means they're space between you and the goal,

[01:13] which means you're not actually happy.

[01:15] My goal is to be happy, which means you aren't right now.

[01:18] So I have made meaning, which is ironic,

[01:27] that'll find things inherently meaningful.

[01:29] But I found meaningful work as I deem meaningful

[01:34] to be the thing that I derive the most joy from.

[01:38] And so I have it broken down to a more tactical level,

[01:42] which is what days have I enjoyed and looked back on

[01:44] and been proud of myself for that day.

[01:47] And over probably a three or four year period,

[01:50] I just looked at the good days in the bad days.

[01:52] And I looked at what the good days had in common.

[01:54] I looked at what the bad days had in common.

[01:56] I've just over time minimized the things

[01:57] that happened on the bad days and not

[01:59] to maximize the things happening on the good days.

[02:01] Even to big investments, like I am much happier

[02:05] when I work out.

[02:07] Like, rather, not even much happier when I work out.

[02:10] When I look back on my day, this was a good day,

[02:12] almost always has a workout in it.

[02:14] And usually with people I like.

[02:16] And so workouts take probably longer

[02:18] for me than most people.

[02:19] Because I'm not the, I'm in and out in 45 minutes.

[02:21] And I, you know, did my morning routine

[02:25] and I can do it, send out 40 emails from whatever.

[02:28] It's everyone's different.

[02:29] But for me, I work out for like two hours

[02:31] as cause I like to.

[02:34] And so I do it.

[02:35] And I do it with people that I like.

[02:37] And so I'm willing to invest the time

[02:39] because like what's the point anyways?

[02:41] Like why make all the money to what?

[02:44] Enjoy it like I enjoy doing that.

[02:47] So I do that every day.

[02:48] I like writing.

[02:50] So I write for, you know, four to six hours a day.

[02:54] And there was probably the two biggest activities

[02:56] that I do.

[02:57] And if I can write with somebody that I like,

[02:59] then I do something I like with people I like.

[03:01] And I think that that's probably been the,

[03:03] the single simplest formula is doing things you like

[03:06] with people you like and trying to maximize

[03:09] as much time as I can on the, on that bucket.

[03:12] And then everything else I try and minimize is overhead

[03:14] or outsource.

[03:16] Most people are like why am I not happy?

[03:18] They also see a problem with them not happy.

[03:19] They have it as an expectation of the world

[03:21] and the universe that they should be happy.

[03:23] And to the same degree, people have an expectation

[03:24] that life should be meaningful.

[03:26] Like why does life need to be meaningful?

[03:28] Why does the universe need to make you happy?

[03:30] It doesn't.

[03:31] You can choose that, but it's just like not a requirement.

[03:33] And so they think there's something wrong with it

[03:35] when reality like you're alive and you might procreate,

[03:37] you might not, but like that's the only reason

[03:39] that you're here.

[03:40] Right.

[03:40] Oh man, there we go.

[03:43] Broke my wedding ring.

[03:45] It's a sign.

[03:47] I don't know, Silicon.

[03:51] It's like my third one.

[03:53] I work in every like two years.

[03:55] As a sign note, this is fucking incredible.

[03:57] Oh cool.

[03:58] Oh, okay.

[03:59] What are you doing?

[04:00] Take that shit again on there.

[04:02] It smells like commitment.

[04:05] So like if I boil it down,

[04:09] like happiness is fleeting because you get hungry again,

[04:12] you get sleepy again.

[04:14] Meaning you can only really tell at the end.

[04:17] Like did I do something that contributed.

[04:20] But on the day to day perspective, I can know

[04:22] that what I'm doing is useful.

[04:24] And if what you're doing is not useful, then I think that's harder.

[04:28] And I also think I also think that men and women are different here.

[04:32] So we use like happy, I hate the term in general.

[04:34] But like I think men and women want different things out of life.

[04:38] And I think we should we bucket them together.

[04:40] It's also the same degree like why therapy with men

[04:44] doesn't work necessarily the same.

[04:47] We have to have a different approach.

[04:49] Like people think men need more love.

[04:51] And I just don't think that's true.

[04:53] I think we want more respect.

[04:56] And like you get respect from being useful.

[04:59] And so I make that the goal.

[05:03] Like no one casts aside a man who's useful.

[05:08] And being useful is an attractive trait.

[05:10] Like if you see someone who's really good at something,

[05:13] it's hard like for women.

[05:15] It's like that is a contributing number of society.

[05:18] They do stuff like that help other people.

[05:20] We want them here.

[05:21] Like you get status from that.

[05:23] And so that means that skill mastery in a very real way can help you attract the

[05:30] mate you want, which is why I indexed the ton of my life around getting better

[05:34] and stuff.

[05:35] And also from a stress perspective, people like I see sometimes these podcasts

[05:41] from successful entrepreneurs and they're like, man I'm still worried

[05:46] I could lose it all tomorrow.

[05:47] I don't have that.

[05:49] Like I'm genuinely not afraid of losing it all tomorrow.

[05:51] Because I have lost it before and I got it back.

[05:54] And if you have a, like if you were lucky, because there are guys who get lucky.

[05:58] And if you are lucky then absolutely you should be worried about it.

[06:00] Because if you do lose it you don't know how to get it back.

[06:02] But if you have skills like I know that I can go to any business and help grow it.

[06:07] Like that's valuable.

[06:08] That's useful.

[06:10] And so even reframing the word value as usefulness is probably also an easier way

[06:15] to do it for people to kind of like comprehend.

[06:17] But I think if you make that the goal, it also takes it away from you.

[06:23] So the reason I hate, so I would say I have a friend,ish.

[06:28] Well I'm a friend who's who's single and struggles because he's not happy.

[06:33] Successful but not happy.

[06:36] And so he obsesses on happiness.

[06:38] And I was like do you know that when you obsess on happiness all you do is think about you all day?

[06:42] Like it's all you're doing.

[06:44] You're just thinking about you all fucking day.

[06:47] And like how useless.

[06:51] And so the nice thing with being useful is that in order to be useful you have to be useful.

[06:56] You have to be useful to other people.

[06:58] Like no one can be useful in order to be useful to other people.

[07:01] So there's a service element but there's also self improvement element which is to be useful to other people.

[07:06] You need to improve yourself.

[07:08] And so that's why I think being useful is has been probably my day to day goal of what I need to do.

[07:14] And that's served me well.

[07:16] Not saying anyone should or should they can do whatever they want.

[07:19] But for me that's helped me.

[07:21] For sure offers clearly done brains, gaps people with depression.

[07:24] The areas of the brain that are responsible for self reflection and remanation are like overly active.

[07:29] Yeah they think about themselves too much.

[07:31] I mean this is a Tony Robbins quote we said if you stay in your head or dead.

[07:35] And because it rhymes it's true.

[07:37] And so.

[07:39] But yeah.

[07:41] But for real though like when I was 19 the reason I said fuck happiness is like I realize that I was in this cycle

[07:47] loop of trying like everything you analyze of like this make me happy.

[07:51] Does this piece of make me happy? Does this class make me happy?

[07:54] I mean I quit premed because I thought biology didn't make me happy.

[07:57] Now I'm very glad that I did because I like this a lot more now.

[08:00] But like that was the reason I did it. I studied really hard it did well.

[08:03] But I was like this doesn't make me happy.

[08:05] Like of course if fuck he doesn't make you happy you suck at it.

[08:08] You're learning something you're going to suck for a very long time.

[08:10] It's only when all these skills go together that you'll be good at something and you'll actually be useful to society.

[08:14] Of course you learning the fucking chromosomes doesn't do anything.

[08:18] But it's because of what it shows a school that you're willing to put up with so that you might be useful to society in the particular skill set.

[08:26] And so yeah I think being useful is a far better goal.

[08:30] And this is this is me just shouting on specificity to men.

[08:33] If you could just just try it try this on for a month.

[08:38] If you're happy do it on the fucking well I really just do it every one of you the right.

[08:41] But if what you're working isn't working for you or what you're doing isn't working for you.

[08:45] I would try this on for size one say that you're going to stop trying to be happy.

[08:51] Just give up on it. Just like just stop thinking about it.

[08:54] But like I'm not you know what I'm actually okay with being unhappy.

[08:57] I'm fine with it.

[08:59] I'm still here like it doesn't mean anything.

[09:02] Okay. And so then you can take action despite your lack of happiness and think okay how can I be useful to other people?

[09:09] And I think if you do that you'll actually start focusing on the tasks and on people outside of yourself and you'll be amazed at how much better you feel overall.

[09:19] And what happened to me when I went into my fuck happiness thing is that I stopped thinking about happiness altogether.

[09:26] And then like years later I was like you know what?

[09:28] Because I was so used because like I wanted to label myself that way and be okay with it people would ask me like hey XYZ I'd be like oh I'm not a happy person.

[09:36] I would just like say that up front that way I didn't have to and I remember catching myself probably like five years later.

[09:43] And I was like huh I say that I was like I actually really do like my life a lot.

[09:48] So I stopped saying I'm not a happy person because like I actually kind of do like my life.

[09:52] But I feel like I only got to liking my life by being willing to not like what I was doing for a long period of time.

[10:00] It's like also what time frame where you think about it.

[10:03] Totally.

[10:04] Like most things that feel good for you are what if it feel good or bad for you no longer and also like things that you've had.

[10:11] I actually I only disagree because it's so big because like I think people just only think of the things that quote feel good.

[10:18] But there's tons of things that feel good that are not bad for you like sex feels good.

[10:21] It's not bad for you.

[10:23] You know like it's just we immediately jump to like cigarettes, booze you know whatever.

[10:27] But it's really anything in excess is bad for you.

[10:31] Like if so much sex that you don't go to work in O'Neighb.

[10:33] It's bad for you.

[10:34] You know what I mean?

[10:35] If you like even cigarettes like if you have one cigarette or a week doesn't do anything for you.

[10:39] Probably if you smoke more than that just walking outside.

[10:42] You know what I mean for a week in terms of just you know CO2 from cars.

[10:45] So it's it's always you know it's always in the dose.

[10:49] Yeah is that you maybe the use for this kind of that.

[10:51] People want to buy an area when it's really a continuum.

[10:54] What do you mean by that?

[10:55] People say oh I like it therefore they want a simple rule but like.

[10:59] Life has we more continuums than bunners like good and bad like first off defined good defined bad.

[11:04] Second off like like like like it or not how much you know to what's agree how often like what is good like whatever.

[11:13] I mean a really fun one is that I think to Dr. Kashi and I've talked about this but like there's this whole thing on drinking glass of wine every day.

[11:21] Reserve a troll is one of the key ingredients that's like anti-cancer fighting whatever.

[11:27] But if you look at like centenarians people who live over 100 a disproportionate amount of them smoke.

[11:34] And so I find that interesting because I think that genetically means that that person probably has some sort of protection against long based carcinogens which then means they get all the benefits of cigarettes and none of the downsides.

[11:45] And so they're able to basically benefit from all the stress reducing components of nicotine and smoking but then just don't get cancer.

[11:54] And so I would argue that like drinking a glass of wine every night has less to do with the reserve of troll and more to do with the stress reduction on a continuous basis.

[12:02] So anyways.

[12:04] So.

[12:05] If the blue like the blues on these are correct where those people live.

[12:08] That's that's that's that's that stuff more so more died stuff yeah it's more died stuff.

[12:13] Where do you go somewhere.

[12:15] Everywhere but here.

[12:18] Yeah we started it spread it everywhere else and then said it wasn't cool anymore.

[12:23] Everyone else was like what the plan.

[12:25] China's like yeah.

[12:26] We still smoke nicotine men make good times.

[12:31] I have a question for you.

[12:33] Do you feel like you have a better descriptor of this subjective experience you're having when you're in quote unquote like the flow state like when you're writing.

[12:41] Sure.

[12:42] You wouldn't say you're happy but I know you like writing.

[12:45] Yeah.

[12:46] Yeah.

[12:47] I enjoy writing.

[12:48] Well I think one thing is isn't is the idea of learning how to enjoy the challenge.

[12:51] So I think like I think a lot of people can get there quickly like a lot of people play video games because.

[12:58] Okay.

[12:59] So video games are designed to increase in difficulty proportional to people's willingness to.

[13:06] Basically they extend intermittent reinforcement.

[13:08] So your first level is always easy and they extend it a little bit more.

[13:11] They extend a little more.

[13:12] And eventually believe it or not you'll have learned the behavior such that they can push it out so far they never need to reward you again which is why people stay in abusive relationships.

[13:19] Like in the beginning it's good.

[13:21] I fucked up.

[13:22] Oh everything's good again and then I fucked up more and then it's good again and then it's good again and then it's good again and then eventually it's never good again.

[13:29] But they got reinforced on enough spaces each time that they stay in it.

[13:35] And so I think the difference between a video game and life is that that interval isn't set.

[13:42] And so you're not necessarily going to have a quick win at level one because it's more like you basically get none until you're at level like 20 and then all of a sudden it all comes.

[13:51] And so that's I think that's the difficult part.

[13:54] And so I think being willing I think athletes do particularly well like college athletes do really well.

[14:02] Transitioning because they've learned a metaskill which is that you're going to suck for a long time at something before you become a master at it.

[14:09] And most people don't have the ability don't have any experience mastering anything in life early on.

[14:15] And so they have to learn how to work.

[14:18] And so I think learning's you work is the most useful thing that you can do.

[14:23] I mean I think for me.

[14:26] I love finding input output equations that equal like success of some kind.

[14:30] So it's like if you're giving public speaking I'm going to give this example because it's perfect.

[14:34] So Caleb is my team.

[14:38] He had said right you know years ago when we met like I'm not I don't really like public speaking I don't like presenting I don't like this stuff.

[14:45] Cool and I think he said somebody degree of like I don't like it or I bad at it whatever.

[14:50] And he did a presentation for the team and it was good.

[14:55] And then he had a bunch of things that he wanted to do better on the next one.

[15:00] So between those time periods I had done the book lunch and so he had seen me prepare for my presentation and so I did it a hundred times over 30 days I did three times a day before I gave the book lunch.

[15:13] And you know when there was 500,000 people or whatever they were the lunch when we had 500,000 people registered for the lunch and I was about to step on stage.

[15:24] The team that was doing it all said we've done we do this every day and I've never seen anyone so like relaxed.

[15:32] And it wasn't a front it was because I had done it so many times and so fast forward.

[15:40] Caleb had another presentation he had to give and this time he prepared three times as long.

[15:45] So he did instead of 10 hours of private 30 hours of prep and instead of having 80 slides yet 300 and 30 slides.

[15:51] And the presentation went way better and he noted that he wasn't nervous at all going into the second presentation compared to the first presentation.

[16:00] And so he messaged me afterwards and said I shoot.

[16:08] It wasn't that I was bad at speaking I was just lazy.

[16:13] I think that a lot of people mistakenly think they're bad at things they haven't even learned how to try.

[16:20] And I do think learning how to try is also domain specific.

[16:24] And so like Caleb's exceptional video editor and media strategist and great with building the team and those skills those have been skills that he knew how to work hard at.

[16:34] But this was a completely different skill and so it's like writing like I have a lot of entrepreneur friends who are writing books now.

[16:40] And I don't know that I come from background writing I got a full writing scholarship to Tufts University which is a good school.

[16:46] I got a personal letter from their writing cell.

[16:48] Like we love all your stuff we want you to be. I ended up going to the end of it.

[16:51] But like I was the vice editor of the newspaper I was at Edder and Chief of Literary Magazine when I was in high school like I like writing.

[16:57] And so I know what hard what hard work looks like in writing which is just editing and editing and editing.

[17:05] Which is basically like doing the speech again and doing the speech again and doing the speech again.

[17:10] And it's the same as ping pong which is 500 backhands, 500 forehands.

[17:14] It's just repetition right.

[17:17] And so right now if you're doing work or you feel like you're not as good at something you have to figure out the input output equation is.

[17:25] You have to figure out like what's the thing that I have to do a lot of because every skills like this is that there's a period we have to do a lot of something.

[17:31] And if you don't know what it is then you're not going to get better.

[17:34] Sales is like I have to do 100 calls a day.

[17:37] I have to do 10 conversations a day.

[17:40] Whatever it is you do that every single day and you do that for a year you get pretty fucking good.

[17:44] And so you have to learn what that input output equation is so that you can push as much as it is me.

[17:51] Once I know it then I just jam as much input as I possibly can to that thing.

[17:55] And then that's where the whole quote that you know when viral was.

[18:01] Confidence doesn't come from shouting affirmations in the mirror by having a stack of an animal proof that you are who you say you are.

[18:09] Outwork yourself out.

[18:10] And so like you become confident by giving yourself the stack of evidence the hundred times I went over the presentation.

[18:18] I felt confident going into that because I had a stack of proof that I'd already done it perfectly the last 20 times in a row that I'd done it.

[18:24] So why would 21 be different?

[18:27] And if you've had a thousand sales calls on your thousand first if people are watching they're like man you sound so confident.

[18:34] It's just how it is.

[18:36] It's not like I'm confident I just know what's going to happen next.

[18:39] And so I prefer to think about it as like do it so many times you get bored of doing it.

[18:44] And like that's when you look confident to everyone on the outside because you'll have no emotional affect to the outcome because you'll have recognized the patterns so many times.

[18:53] That there's nothing that's going to surprise you.

[18:55] And I think that most people just don't know how to work that hard.

[18:59] Like there is no way that anyone will know how hard I've worked on the books.

[19:03] They just imagine that there's a reason that they're all you know all time bestsellers reach the categories they're in and still.

[19:10] They're like it's because you're following it's like no you know I know that but get every other fucking person who has a following and their books don't fucking sell even though they have a big following.

[19:18] They launch it and then they stop selling why because the book sucked.

[19:21] They go to writer they've voiced it in whatever and they make their whatever 5 million bucks or whatever it is.

[19:29] They published on the second minute.

[19:30] Yeah I mean shit they literally they think the book is finished when it has reached the number of pages that creates a book.

[19:38] Like I can write a book in two weeks if I was just trying to write a certain number of pages.

[19:44] But like I've usually written five times the amount of pages as what actually comes out in the final draft and I've rewritten end to end the whole thing.

[19:53] Not once or twice but like 10 times end end.

[19:57] But you know what happens when you do that you get really fucking good at knowing what is what is important and what is it.

[20:02] And you also give yourself way more outside life exposures that trigger new thoughts over that period of time that remind you of things that can make it better.

[20:13] And so it's kind of like a like when you paint it's like it's like putting coats of paint and letting it dry.

[20:19] And so I kind of see editing drafts is like another coat of paint and then you think you're like you know what I just saw that like I was I was walking I went to a new area today and I saw this new yellow.

[20:28] I went in fact I thought they didn't if you had immediately shipped it you wouldn't have had the opportunity to see the yellow thing because time didn't transpired during the creation of the thing.

[20:36] And so I think there's a reason that books that take 10 years to write.

[20:40] And read like they took 10 years to write. There's just a depth to the quality.

[20:44] Do you then now to bring this back kind of like that happiness or whatever.

[20:49] I find happiness and figuring out what my input output equation is and doing as much as you really possible.

[20:53] Do you then engineer your environment to reinforce yourself to the more input?

[20:56] Absolutely.

[20:57] You want to make it easiest possible to work as hard as you can.

[21:01] And so everything that is not that input output equation is interference.

[21:06] And so like relationships.

[21:08] Like I mean I said this before but everything that you are not willing to sacrifice to be the best.

[21:15] The person who's best in the world is willing to and already has sacrificed.

[21:20] And so I'm not saying good or bad do whatever you want.

[21:24] But if you want to be number one and a lot of people say I want to be the best it's like Nate don't.

[21:28] You want to be better and you can be really good.

[21:31] You can be really good and not sacrifice plenty of things.

[21:33] But if you want to be the best then you just have to assume that the best person in the world has the genetic predisposition.

[21:40] Has all the environmental environmental cues aligned with their ultimate goal.

[21:44] And is willing to give up everything that is not achieving that goal.

[21:48] And if you're not in that boat then you're not going to be the best.

[21:52] People just like saying it makes it feel good but it's false.

[21:58] And so in terms of aligning the environment if you know the input out of quiz for me it's writing right now is the season that I'm in because writing kind of is the is the pillar of everything else we do content wise internal communications.

[22:11] The books everything comes from me taking time to write because I'm I organized my thoughts better that way and up because I've become skilled at writing.

[22:19] So it's the best way it's the most succinct way that I can communicate.

[22:22] And so there's a reason that the first six hours of my day when I'm freshest most well rested I have no meetings and I have only one thing that I do which is right there's nothing else.

[22:39] And so if you know what the input out of equation is find the time the four to six hours a day every day that you can do that and then allow nothing to interfere with it.

[22:51] And that's it like nothing interferes with it.

[22:55] And if you do that for five years you'll be really fucking good and you'll be useful and you'll feel good about it because the thing is that a certain point the work itself becomes reinforcing.

[23:05] Like when editors edit and then they make a change and then the the story goes or the video goes the way they want to it's like boom that was reinforcing.

[23:12] And if I like work really hard on a paragraph and I could just shrink it to one sentence and I'm like fuck yeah and that might take that literally might take two hours.

[23:20] To just keep beating it down until I get it to like the one most succinct thing.

[23:24] But that's satisfying and so the beginning you suck and you do the reps so that you can learn the skills so that eventually you do the work itself because the work itself is rewarding but that takes time to get to.

[23:34] Yeah it's like you are at this point writing the third book and it's like.

[23:39] My fourth book overall.

[23:41] Yes and you can get in those sentences is the wind a little wind which also makes it easier because I'm not waiting for the six thousand and of course.

[23:49] Where you get off the road to that.

[23:51] Well yeah I mean in the beginning you start the start the journey because you have this big ultimate payoff you want to have but that's way too far out to actually wait like you have to be an exceptional person who's been reinforced in the past four waiting for a very long period of time.

[24:03] So I say the athletes thing is kind of interesting because they've had to wait a long period of time and so they have to practice for a long period before they get the thing.

[24:11] But typically they get enough reinforces early on that that the act itself becomes reinforcing and that's that's what mastery is is you transition from having some sort of external motivator to external I believe all motivators external but.

[24:26] From the work itself being intrinsically rewarding versus having a carrot of some kind that's been artificially put there like status or an award or number one or ranking.

[24:38] And masters can.

[24:43] Masters enjoy the work more than novices do so it's actually easier for masters.

[24:49] Do you find ironically that hard work has less hard these things or is it still hard work because you're.

[24:59] It's still hard it's different in terms of the heart the I would say the hard thing that I have now is that my level of quality the standard that I have is only mine.

[25:10] Like I know that I could probably put out the first draft and it would probably be a mess of.

[25:15] It's just that I would know that it could have been better and that would be me alive and so the hard part is still maintain so it's actually the hard part for me now is that I mean teen.

[25:26] My standard as the number one standard that I optimize for and if the world so chooses to also like it great.

[25:33] But it also divorces me somewhat from the outcome because if it were just about getting the best selling book then I would publish on the first shot because at this point I do have enough skill that probably would be a best seller on some.

[25:45] But I also think there's different seem being a best seller for a season being best seller for a hundred years and so I'm trying to write these books to be best sellers when I'm dead.

[25:54] So they're still useful.

[25:56] How do you know when you met that like well how do you know what a sentence is like when there's nothing else I can do to it to make it better.

[26:03] And you sleep on it and do it again.

[26:05] There's nothing else I can do to make it better.

[26:07] Same thing for the presentation there's nothing else I can do to make this better.

[26:11] I can't practice it more.

[26:13] Because even at a certain point when you if you get past a certain point of practicing you start you start knowing it almost too well.

[26:19] You start cutting corn because you're like it gets too natural like I actually I borderline over compared to the GMats.

[26:27] I like peaked I like because I took tests every week and my math score.

[26:32] Sorry my English score peaked before my math score did so my math score peaked at the test my English score I had done it so many times real like shoot.

[26:40] And I've done you recognize so many patterns they're like man which patterns this one because like I'm so good at all about to remember like it it.

[26:49] You peek right so there is a point where it's not even diminishing returns actually start getting worse.

[26:53] At least in my opinion really some my experience and so.

[26:58] If you if you if you regress something down to a simple form and then I just cut the sentence at half I lose material I lose stuff that would that needs to be there and so you get it as simple as possible bonus.

[27:09] You talked about.

[27:10] If someone comes to you and you're like what would you do if you had six more hours on that.

[27:16] Oh yeah yeah so really a really fun thought exercise for somebody who's just like all of this is like wow that's so much work I'm not really prepared for that well I'll walk you through what it looks like in a micro example.

[27:27] So if a video editor comes to me and says hey do you like this clip and I say yeah I do like the clip.

[27:32] If you had another two hours to work on it what would you do and they're like well if I don't know the two hours I do this and this but okay go do that come back.

[27:39] They come back and like do you think it's better and they see yeah they showed to me and like it is better okay now if you had another two hours so what you do I like why do this this and this like okay cool.

[27:48] They go they come back same conversation like okay.

[27:51] If you had a week.

[27:53] Who would you do.

[27:54] Well then they're like well shoot I would I probably scrap this whole style of wrong actually make a totally new framework for how I approach the video.

[28:01] And I want to come at it from this angle altogether just take you know a lot more work but I think it would still make a better outcome.

[28:07] It's okay so that idea just do it on five years.

[28:13] And so.

[28:19] Everybody just wants to get it done rather than get it right.

[28:25] And getting it right is where all the money is.

[28:28] I bet you asked yourself like what would you do if you have 50 years to work on acquisition.

[28:32] 100% and I do it 50 years and I do what I'm doing.

[28:36] Yeah.

[28:37] And not kind of face the quick reinforcements.

[28:40] Sure.

[28:41] Well it's the quick external but I mean like at certain point you start you start to develop master even around pursuing goals.

[28:48] So like I have I've had enough.

[28:52] Past like this is book three from the hundred million dollar series.

[28:57] Every month I get thousands of reviews and DMs and people who say their life change from the first two books.

[29:07] The hard part was book one when I have none of that for a year and a half.

[29:11] But once that one's out leads I'm like well I'm getting reinforcement every day from my writing.

[29:16] And so I write and so now I've two books worth of that once the third book's out there will be three books worth of that.

[29:22] So maintaining that gets easier and easier just because I have regular enforcement for writing.

[29:26] Not necessarily this book but writing in general.

[29:30] And so that then means I can I can generalize past good experiences onto how I act and work now.

[29:40] That's why like you become you become an expert at pursuing goals because you have pursued goals in the past.

[29:45] I just use writings in the ampoule but I've pursued goals in the past and sticking it out has had big payoffs.

[29:51] And so when I feel like I'm sticking it out again I'm reminded of the past times I've stuck it out and it's been worth it.

[29:57] The hard part is for the people who haven't stuck anything out because they've never they've never seen it work.

[30:02] And so the first one's always the hard one is like you just have to have faith on some level.

[30:07] You just have to fucking believe that it'll work out.

[30:10] And the thing that carries you over the bridge and the short term is that you are getting better.

[30:14] And if you can just focus on that then even if the crowd doesn't hear when you give your presentation or you don't sell books or whatever it is.

[30:20] You'll know.

[30:22] And so it's funny because I look back at the presentation that I gave five years ago and I really am embarrassed.

[30:28] But I'm not embarrassed at the effort I put in then.

[30:32] Because the effort I put in then I really did think it was really good.

[30:36] I just didn't know what good could be because I also gave myself 20 hours rather than 200 hours.

[30:42] And so if I only had 20 hours maybe that is the best I can do.

[30:45] And maybe today that's still the best I could do.

[30:47] Just give myself way more time.

[30:48] But the problem with giving yourself way more time, what you see how much good good can be, is that you realize how few projects you can do.

[30:57] Which is why you just have to be that's why like the biggest guys and biggest business titans the world talks so much about focus because it's not.

[31:03] It's not that like focuses the thing.

[31:05] It's just that it takes so much fucking time to do something right.

[31:08] That you can't do more than one thing.

[31:12] So it might be almost part of that like I know we keep saying that what's happening is like having this equation to have less things that you're trying to optimize for and you're set of things that you're working on.

[31:22] If you want to be exceptional with something, you means you have to put a lot of input into it and you can't be exceptional at very many things because of how many inputs you have and how limited they are.

[31:30] So if time is an input, we all have the same amount of time.

[31:32] And if it takes a huge amount of that time to get good at one thing, then if you take that as the assumption we're basing this on, then there's just not many things you can get very good at.

[31:40] And so then to take some level of selection to be like what thing do I want to go good at.

[31:44] How does the one zero grant fit into this and how did you conceptualize?

[31:50] Well the one of your brands very much aligned with this.

[31:54] I should have my nester upon it took it off this morning.

[31:58] You just paste it on.

[32:01] The whole idea was you know so funny I saw the background of my gym.

[32:06] It said that picture that I posted it's like one of my first video content.

[32:11] Yeah.

[32:12] It said the back of the wall.

[32:14] I made this quote up.

[32:15] I painted it.

[32:16] You can see how ugly the thing is in the back wall.

[32:18] It says strength doesn't come from what strength doesn't come from doing what you think you can.

[32:30] Is what I think it says.

[32:33] Which I don't agree with the word strength that should be growth but anyways I like the idea.

[32:37] And so I think that one of zero is very much like that which is you know one of one is doing something that only you can do.

[32:43] One of zero is doing something that you've never done before and that ideally no one else could do.

[32:48] And so it's an amount of work that most people just don't comprehend.

[32:52] And it's really hard to even describe it because like I can say I spent six hours a day for 18 months on this one project.

[32:59] And people will nod their heads.

[33:01] But spend six fucking hours on one thing once.

[33:05] And then do it 500 times.

[33:08] And then like you'll start to see like the soul crushing amount of effort that it takes to stick with it.

[33:15] Now I've been able to extend how long I work on projects because just like the abusive husband thing or the abusive spouse thing.

[33:23] Like in the beginning you can have a short project you get a win.

[33:26] I can work a little longer the next time.

[33:27] Like a little longer the next time.

[33:29] Books really good books are one of the hard projects to do because you get almost zero reinforcement.

[33:33] It's very punishing for most of the time until quote the end.

[33:39] But the process itself there is some sort of joy in being the type of person who is able to endure that.

[33:47] Because I have a lot of entrepreneurs who are like, I just finished my book.

[33:51] I'm going to write book just like you did.

[33:53] I was like, no you won't.

[33:55] But you know that I want to put it in the tent.

[33:59] No.

[34:00] They're like a worthwhile for him. I'll do that too.

[34:02] His book was so good. I'll write one too.

[34:05] It doesn't work the way.

[34:07] They've never even written anything.

[34:09] So they're starting it like where I was when I was 15.

[34:13] And I would say the same degree is probably like people who look at Mr. Beast now.

[34:15] They're like, oh, I'll just go make you two videos.

[34:17] Like you start with 13.

[34:19] And he's been spending more than six hours a day trying to make videos since then.

[34:24] And so there's just like so much depth of knowledge that you can get that just takes time.

[34:29] But the thing is, is from the happiness perspective.

[34:31] I find a lot of joy and excellence.

[34:34] And I think that work well done provides dividends forever.

[34:40] So we would think about like subject to well being or like purpose or meaning or utility or usefulness.

[34:47] Any of those, whatever one you want to optimize for.

[34:50] Like I am proud of the first book I wrote.

[34:53] I'm proud of the second book I wrote. I'm proud of the third book I wrote.

[34:56] And I'm proud of the book that I'm writing right now.

[34:58] And when I look back on them, every time I see them and I see people benefit from them.

[35:02] I get a reward for one time and put even though it was a year.

[35:07] For the rest of my life, I will get rewarded for that effort.

[35:10] And so it just encourages me more and more to do things the right way.

[35:15] And I think people who build exceptional products think about products the same way.

[35:20] Which is like it has to be right.

[35:22] It just has to. It's all the 100 details.

[35:25] It's not the big idea.

[35:27] It's the 100 details that make the difference between like the Mr. Beast videos versus other people who try to be like Mr. Beast.

[35:33] It's 100 details that make his videos better.

[35:36] It's not like one caption.

[35:37] Yeah, it's not just the thumbnail, right? Like it's not that.

[35:40] It's a hundred things.

[35:42] I've heard you said it worked you a couple times.

[35:45] And I'm wondering if you have a distinction between happiness and joy and a blessing of the third or third.

[35:52] I see joy a lot is just being present in the moment because I think you can joyfully mourn.

[35:57] Like if someone's died, I think you can find joy in a morning experience if you're consoling someone else.

[36:07] I think it's just being present and being okay with experiencing life.

[36:12] So I mean, that's how I see joy.

[36:14] Now I haven't defined it and I'll probably spend more time defining the words.

[36:17] But I just see this being present.

[36:21] Like I am, I experienced joy when I am present.

[36:25] Like I'm enjoying this.

[36:27] I feel very present right now.

[36:29] As soon as you give up the goal of happiness or even meaning,

[36:35] then it stops being this thing that's outside of you.

[36:39] And so it allows you to be present in the moment and do what you want to do or do what you need to do.

[36:44] So if you always have this thing that you're measuring against, one, there's always a deltum between where you are and where it is.

[36:50] But I think oftentimes it'll optimize for the wrong path.

[36:56] And I think happiness for most people is pleasure seeking.

[36:59] So they call it happiness, but it's really hedonism.

[37:02] And most, I don't like to appeal to religion, but in terms of old ideologies,

[37:13] most people have found, and I'm sure there is some sign that I don't know.

[37:17] That people who pursue hedonistic lifestyles tend to be the most empty, and the least fulfilled.

[37:24] And so I think people have just swapped the word happy or hedonism for happiness.

[37:29] And they think they wouldn't want to say that, but if you look at the actual activities they're pursuing,

[37:35] they're almost purely pleasure seeking.

[37:38] What makes an activity only players in the person that will go long to the end?

[37:42] Well I think it's just time for time scale. It's short term long term.

[37:46] Like something that most pleasure-based activities are, they're pleasure now at the sacrifice of goal or something later.

[37:58] To be fair, I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

[38:01] I'm just saying like, no, what we're optimizing for it.

[38:04] Is that why that line that we talked about once of desires or contracts or what ourselves?

[38:12] Yeah, so there was this big philosophy website, and then the vault quoted that site.

[38:20] And it was a desire as a contract we make with ourselves to be unhappy until we get what we want.

[38:27] And I mean, I fundamentally agree whenever you want something, it means you don't have it.

[38:32] And you basically create deprivation within yourself to motivate behavior.

[38:39] So if you see motivations that you're opposite of deprivation, like you're horny as when you haven't fucked for a while,

[38:44] you are hungriest when you haven't eaten for a while.

[38:47] You have a huge motivation to sleep when you're exhausted, right?

[38:50] And so if we want something we create deprivation within ourselves to motivate ourselves to get it.

[38:58] But by creating deprivation, we basically create, you know, he calls it unhappiness.

[39:05] But I don't know if I necessarily agree with that, is the, I think we just create deprivation.

[39:11] Because what you still say there is a gap between what you have here.

[39:14] You want sure?

[39:16] Yeah.

[39:17] Like, you want something that you don't have.

[39:19] But I mean, I think the way to skirt that is in is wanting a challenge.

[39:29] And so if you just genuinely want to fight bigger and bigger bosses, then the fact that you get the gold at the end becomes,

[39:36] like if anything the gold at the end is like irrelevant, you just want to find the next boss.

[39:41] And most of the champions that are out there that I've seen, you live the Michael Jordan's,

[39:46] I mean, a lot of Olympians have huge depression after they get a gold because now what?

[39:52] And so it really, and I think you can see how people, how people react to victory, tells you what motivated them, or rather what they were deprived of.

[40:06] So if the gold was to be exceptional, then that person hits the gold, sees it as a foreground conclusion,

[40:13] and it's just excited to move on to the next thing.

[40:15] If they made their entire life about getting the gold, then they have no idea what to do.

[40:21] Because they were married to the outcome of the process.

[40:23] And again, I think that you can win either way.

[40:26] I absolutely think you can win either way.

[40:29] But it definitely changes how long you can play.

[40:32] Yeah.

[40:33] It's like, for the right thing that gap actually becomes an enjoyable cross-economic transit.

[40:39] Well, it's not even the gap.

[40:41] It's just that if you want the challenge, then you basically create goals to create challenges.

[40:46] You don't create goals to achieve goals.

[40:48] You set new goalposts just so that you can have the trial.

[40:52] And so like, Tim was like, what happens when he hit a billion?

[40:55] I was like, I'll make it 10.

[40:56] And I want to have 10, 100.

[40:58] Like, it doesn't matter, because I'll die, and I'll give it all the way.

[41:01] It's irrelevant.

[41:02] But it's just like, I want to be better.

[41:04] And the only way to be better is to do the work that I know I should do.

[41:09] And so that way every day I'm doing the work, and at least for me, that has worked.

[41:13] Do whatever you want.

[41:14] That has worked for me.

[41:15] Because I feel like some people talk about that like maybe the goalposts things and then they could do it like, oh, people,

[41:19] Yeah.

[41:20] Which one thing, man.

[41:21] But I guess if you take it from the frame of these are just more challenges that I'll enjoy.

[41:25] And it's not a problem if they go for this move.

[41:28] I don't think it's a problem.

[41:30] I mean, if you beat level one boss, then what?

[41:34] You, the game moves you up.

[41:36] You play harder monsters, and then you try and beat level two boss.

[41:39] It's this whole fallacy around being done.

[41:43] It's this whole idea that we can finish.

[41:45] We can work so hard.

[41:46] We never have to work again.

[41:47] We can fuck so good.

[41:48] We never have to fuck again.

[41:49] We can eat so big.

[41:50] We never have to eat again.

[41:51] We can sleep so well.

[41:52] We never have to sleep again.

[41:53] It's just a fallacy.

[41:54] It's not true.

[41:55] And people lose their lives trying to find that one meal or that one fuck or that one, you know, sleep or that one goal.

[42:03] That'll satisfy her then forget.

[42:06] And it never does.

[42:07] I think this story that we're really contextualized for the audiences like that period when

[42:12] you were getting ready to sell.

[42:13] Jim wants that you just, you felt a little lower.

[42:17] Oh yeah.

[42:18] So when I was selling Jim lunch, there was basically a year where I couldn't really work.

[42:22] Most of the things if I worked in the business, then it would look like I was a key man to the business.

[42:26] And if I, and I didn't know if we were going to sell, so I didn't want to start another company.

[42:31] So basically just to like, subsist.

[42:32] I could even start new endeavors or initiatives within the company.

[42:35] So I just had to do nothing basically.

[42:37] And so for me it was the most oppressed I've been.

[42:39] If you look at some of the videos during that time period, a lot of them are me being pretty sad

[42:43] and being like what the fuck is life about.

[42:45] But it's just that for me, like, you know, again, I'm not religious, but I do find it interesting that

[42:51] the first thing God gave Adam in the Bible before giving him a wife was giving him a job.

[42:58] Work.

[43:02] Ten to the garden before he gave him a wife.

[43:05] And I find that really interesting.

[43:07] I don't like religious religion aside.

[43:10] We're built to work.

[43:12] And so for me especially, I'm built to work.

[43:15] And so if I'm working, I'm good.

[43:19] And like the days that I enjoy the most of the days that I work the longest.

[43:23] And so I just try and remove everything that stops me from doing that.

[43:26] You just have the same name as my whole year.

[43:28] Or have the idea of having them potentially being kind of like a house, but not that.

[43:33] Oh, it sounds horrible.

[43:36] Well, I mean, if the idea, like, I think most people in vision, most people in vision have in like the one meal that's going to be so good, they're never going to need again.

[43:45] They're going to be so elated to just be singing with the angels.

[43:48] It's like, yeah, but play it out like then what?

[43:51] Like, okay, God, we sang with the angels from 9 to 10 and then from, you know, then I had a feast, you know what I mean?

[43:59] From 10 to 11.

[44:00] But I got to keep my idealized body, my, my, I don't know, Christian use for idealized body, glorified physical form.

[44:07] I got to keep that the whole time.

[44:09] It's like, okay, well, now it's noon.

[44:11] Now what do I do?

[44:12] Well, dogs are all there because all dogs go to heaven.

[44:14] Great.

[44:15] Good to know.

[44:16] But if your wife dies, then it's like you have three wives up there.

[44:18] You're like, yeah, but I mean, technically we were at different times.

[44:20] I was like, where do we, how do we do it that whenever God's figured it out?

[44:23] But again, I think it's just this fallacy of work life balance.

[44:28] Like, I think heaven is literally just an extrapolation of work life balance as a concept,

[44:32] which is I will just be able to do life and no work.

[44:36] But the first thing God fucking does in the Bible is give someone to work.

[44:41] And so I think so many people would be helped out if they just stopped labeling us a bad thing.

[44:48] And started seeing it as the way to get what they want.

[44:52] And then eventually to make it the thing they want.

[44:56] Because the, and this is like a little bit of an app shop idea, so it takes a little bit more processing part to conceptualize this.

[45:01] But there's goals, and then there's working to hit the goals.

[45:06] And then there's the idea of love the process, but there's the unsubscriptive so that you can hit the goal.

[45:17] But in my opinion, it's just work, not so that you can't.

[45:24] It's just work.

[45:26] And it's like, what do you mean?

[45:28] It means like, working is the goal.

[45:31] Like working as hard to can and learning how hard you can work and how well you can work and how right you can make things and how well you can do them.

[45:39] Like pushing that, expanding my capacity to work, not so that I can.

[45:45] Like expanding my capacity works so that I can work more.

[45:48] Like if you can do that, then you have the self-fulfilling loop.

[45:52] And then you also become completely divorced from the outcomes, which ironically when you do work that way, you do have outsized outcomes compared to everybody else.

[46:01] But you do it because you work so fucking hard because you're addicted to working and you like that game.

[46:06] And the goal is just happened as a consequence, but I don't even like saying the goal is just happened as a consequence because it still gives the idea to the listener or the watcher right now.

[46:13] That that's the point and it's not because even if you're going to be the richest man in the world, okay, let's say that's your goal for how long.

[46:23] Every rich man in the world is rich for the richest man in the world for they touch the top and then boom something changes the economy whatever it is and then another richest man in the world comes up.

[46:31] Like who is the richest man 20 years ago? Actually 30 years ago.

[46:36] A bunch of Japanese guys and then Japan's economy crashed.

[46:41] No one even knows their guy's names. And so it's like making the goal even as a judicious as those guys go elsewhere, right?

[46:49] And let's see your number two, but even let's see your number one for how long.

[46:54] And so that's why I think that the work is the goal.

[46:58] Not so that you can, just the work is the goal.

[47:01] And learning how hard you can work and being proud of yourself for how much harder you work today than you did yesterday.

[47:07] You have taught that perfectly ties us together. You hit the goals that you said you wanted to be happy long time ago.

[47:14] Yeah.

[47:15] Is that kind of you mean more?

[47:17] I mean your action.

[47:18] Well, it's, it's, you've already hit goals that you said would make you happy.

[47:28] And I might have put years ago or something like that in there, but it's just fun.

[47:31] I'm like years ago, you said goals that today you've hit and you said you would be happy and yeah you're not.

[47:35] And so it's because the concept of setting these goals presumed, like the ultimate unhappiness.

[47:44] Equation is if I get X I'll be happy, right? Like we all know that one.

[47:49] Because that's the guarantee of it not not happening.

[47:52] Because it automatically, the entirety of your resistance is outside of yourself and then the moment you hit it, that what?

[47:58] You said another one of the nuts outside yourself, right?

[48:01] And so if the goal doesn't change your entire life, then you can basically be achieving it every day.

[48:10] If the goal of the store is hard as you can't, every day you can work as hard as you can.

[48:14] You can be in the state that you're desiring if the goal is the state.

[48:18] Yeah. The goal is the state of being that you have when you work, exceptionally hard.

[48:22] When you do hard work we're doing.

[48:24] And you know, if you left some in the tank.

[48:28] And I love, I think this is Jesse, it's what it says this, but I really love it.

[48:31] There's a handful of like saying that I've gone from other homeowners that I really love.

[48:34] I'll give you three right now. I'm side-questing, but just deal with it.

[48:37] One is Michael Dell says, play nice but win. I just love that.

[48:43] The second one is Andy Forsell has 100 to 0, which I really, really like, which is basically like society when you're up, you know,

[48:54] in football, let's say you're up 30 to nothing and it's half time.

[48:58] Society says, put in your back-ups, put in your third strings, like take it easy and play.

[49:03] And he's like, no, fuck that. 100 is your own.

[49:07] Step on their throat and fucking kill everyone.

[49:09] And I like that from a from a perspective of like, don't let off the gas.

[49:16] Like, just because they lost doesn't mean that you now have to dilute yourself to lower yourself to their standard.

[49:23] And so it's like, yeah, so what if like it takes this much to win.

[49:29] I don't care if it takes this much to win. I want to be here.

[49:32] Because if you then change how you play because everybody else isn't as good, you lower yourself.

[49:39] You don't raise them up.

[49:41] That's the society trying to make it appear as though people are better than they are.

[49:44] And I'm a big fan of like, they should know they lost 100 is your own.

[49:48] They should know how much from they have to improve.

[49:50] And also the same degree, I should know how much further ahead I am.

[49:54] And the goal, shouldn't you be the way?

[49:57] I'm going to keep playing the way I play.

[49:59] If we happen to finish at 100 or 0, we happen to finish at 100 or 0.

[50:02] But I'm not going to let off because that's who I am.

[50:06] And the third one was Jesse Isler has this thing where he has with his kids, which I really like, was after they do a marathon,

[50:13] because he's really big and endurance sports.

[50:15] And so his kids are too.

[50:17] And so whenever they finish a lot of them pulled up a zero, which I really like, and it means nothing left in the tank.

[50:23] And he said, I just want you, I don't care if you win.

[50:27] I just want you to have nothing left.

[50:29] And I think about that as like the goal.

[50:33] So the goal is to have nothing left.

[50:35] And I think that on the micro level and on the macro level.

[50:38] Like if every day, like my favorite day is the day is that I get into bed and I'm fucking exhausted,

[50:43] but proud of the work that I've done.

[50:45] I have nothing left.

[50:46] I've left it all on the field.

[50:47] And so like that's the goal.

[50:50] The other stuff, society chooses to mission me by.

[50:53] But when I mission myself that way, it distracted me and I didn't enjoy my life.

[50:58] But just living that day as many times in a row as I can until I die is my plan.

[51:04] And at the end, on the macro, they want to hold this up and be like, I got nothing left.

[51:11] I'm used up.

[51:13] But until then, I will continue to try and be useful.

[51:16] And so I like all three of those statements.

[51:19] And to me kind of embody a lot of the values of one of zero, which is not just doing.

[51:24] Only what you can do if you're doing things that you didn't know you could.

[51:27] Let's say someone wants to take this frame of infinite games.

[51:30] But their thing isn't work.

[51:32] Like, perhaps someone like Mother Teresa was like, I just went ahead.

[51:35] Dude.

[51:36] I'd love to happily visit this.

[51:37] Yeah, so, okay.

[51:38] So, Alex, what if my goal isn't work?

[51:43] The goal is always work.

[51:44] It's just what you're working on.

[51:47] And so, whether you're like, I want to have the best marriage.

[51:50] The goal, it takes a fucking work.

[51:51] If the goal is to have the best kids, the parenting is not fucking working.

[51:54] If the goal is to have the best physique, it's fucking work.

[51:57] If the goal is to have the best career, it's work.

[51:59] If the goal is to just be the ultimate version of you, it's work in all those areas.

[52:02] And being mindful of what you went up to my sport.

[52:06] In terms of how many hours you went out of KTH.

[52:08] And so, like, most people live lives.

[52:13] I mean, I'm going to use Rogan's quote from somebody else, but of quiet desperation.

[52:20] Because they're hoping to find a way around work.

[52:30] A work is the way.

[52:32] It's the only way.

[52:35] Because everything else, if it didn't require work, then you'd already have it.

[52:42] Breathing doesn't really require work. Most people do it.

[52:46] There's plenty of things that we just don't think about because we have them automatically.

[52:50] And so, everything that you don't automatically have, you have to expend effort to get.

[52:57] And so, everyone just wants a way to get things without working, which I understand.

[53:01] Don't get me wrong.

[53:02] But the thing is, is that I remember actually this is a weird thought.

[53:05] So, I remember when I was graduating college, I had this.

[53:10] There was like, it was like a billion dollar powerball.

[53:13] Like I was like, you know, when it kind of goes over a billion dollars.

[53:16] And I bought a powerball ticket with my girlfriend.

[53:20] Just like a fun joke.

[53:22] And I was like hoping to win.

[53:24] And what's weird is that, I remember as the drawing was happening.

[53:28] I actually had this huge fear that I'd win.

[53:32] Because if I would win, then it would mean that I would never get a shot to prove myself.

[53:37] That I could have done it because literally from that point on, if you win, nothing you do matters.

[53:43] Like I could never prove that I had any metal whatsoever.

[53:47] Like, everyone would always say, it was because you won the fucking powerball did.

[53:53] And I think the big reason that I didn't become a physician was because my dad has a successful practice.

[53:58] And I knew that if I became a physician, it didn't matter how good of a physician I was.

[54:03] It would always be because people would say it was because of him.

[54:06] Now, that was then I cared a lot about what people think.

[54:09] I probably still do less though, but so on and some degree.

[54:14] But that was, and so just to give, I guess the audience an insight into like,

[54:20] how I think about things, if it's valuable for you.

[54:23] Like, if you are afraid of winning the lottery, because it won't give you a chance to prove to yourself who you want to be or who you want to become,

[54:31] then I think you're on the right path.

[54:34] I love the inverse of that, which is that everything that's right now, which is hard with the opposite of the lottery, is the biggest fucking blessing.

[54:41] Yeah, and if we were to take this in the equal operas for a perspective of,

[54:44] if winning the lottery is the ultimate way to not win,

[54:47] and because you never get the opportunity to prove yourself.

[54:50] Not necessarily prove to other people, but prove to yourself.

[54:53] And so maybe it's said differently, the reason the Powerball Terrified Music, I wouldn't be able to prove to me, independent of what other people said,

[54:59] but I would never know if I could do it because I had a billion dollars behind me.

[55:05] And so every hardship that you encounter, if you reframe it as the story that you will someday tell to yourself of the person that you've become,

[55:16] based on the dragons you've slain in the obstacles you've overcome,

[55:20] then I think that makes those obstacles a unique opportunity for self-improvement,

[55:27] because we can be grateful for these things.

[55:30] I think Jaco has a whole bit on this, where whenever something bad happens, he says good.

[55:37] And I think it's a great train response, because if something bad happens, my train response is a good,

[55:43] it's, I will tell the stories of that.

[55:46] And so I think if you have that frame, then everything serves you,

[55:53] because if if something good happens, cool, if something bad happens, it'll be a story that I will someday tell.

[55:59] Because it assumes that you will live through it, and it assumes that you will eventually figure it out.

[56:04] And so then you can't lose as long as you don't quit.

[56:10] If you're cool talking about these, at least some of the conversations you have with your lies or self-improvement.

[56:16] Yeah, I haven't actually had a song a conversation that's really, because I haven't had a lot of,

[56:21] so because of the wonderful therapist that a song is, I don't have to stick to a schedule.

[56:26] And so I would say that like there are times.

[56:29] Yeah, so there's a lot of research that suggests that we are better at giving advice than we are adhering to it.

[56:37] And so they've done, like, a simple example is they gave two white wash scenarios of somebody and told the reader to give advice to the person who's in the white wash scenarios.

[56:45] The thing is that the person in the white wash scenarios was them, and they don't adhere to the advice that they give.

[56:51] And so they did this to just demonstrate that people won't listen to their own advice,

[56:57] and two that the advice that people give tends to be better than what they do.

[57:00] And they postulate that the reason for that is because you can be non-emotional and detached,

[57:06] giving advice to somebody else, you can be more rational about the advice.

[57:09] Whereas when you're in it, you have more emotions, you make less rational decisions.

[57:13] And so extrapolating that out for me, I have a lot of relatively complex business dealings that happen on regular basis.

[57:21] Most of my stressors, anxieties come from decisions that I have to make with incomplete information.

[57:28] And so if I were to have a therapist, I would probably spend a huge amount of time trying to catch them up on all the relative information.

[57:36] And then I would hope that they somehow have the business acumen to help me navigate these decisions, which they probably wouldn't.

[57:43] And then even if they did, I would have to hope that their incentive was aligned with mine, which there's this billable hours, not me making them as money.

[57:52] And so there's just a lot of problems I think with the traditional model.

[57:55] And so, at least for me. And so I was like, okay, well how can I get somebody who's completely aligned incentives, who has all the same information as me?

[58:04] Who can give me good advice?

[58:06] And so the person who meets all of this qualifications is future me.

[58:11] And it's like, well yeah, wouldn't it be nice to talk to that person?

[58:14] Well, which interesting is if you switch your hat around and you're like, okay, I'm now future me, I'm going to give advice to younger me.

[58:23] It's a wild ride, but the dialogue is super powerful because you don't show me code it for you.

[58:31] And you don't need a waste time profiting and say, okay, take this away.

[58:36] Like you don't have to get it, you just be like, it's such direct communication.

[58:40] And the advice that I would get is often advice that I give.

[58:44] And I give really good business advice.

[58:47] Well, I only say that measured based on the companies growth that we have.

[58:51] And so taking that advice, oftentimes I too need to be more patient.

[58:56] Oftentimes I too need to keep doing what has been working.

[58:59] Oftentimes I too need to wait until we have enough data to make the next call.

[59:03] And I have to give time time.

[59:05] And so now some therapists could say this to me and I'd be like, what the fuck do you know?

[59:10] How's your business going? Right?

[59:12] Obviously not that well. You're talking to me for an hourly rate, whatever.

[59:15] Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I'm just saying that their goals for business and their level of aptitude for business is probably not the same as mine.

[59:22] And so it'd be really hard for me to even put any weight on their opinion.

[59:27] But future me is much smarter and wider than I am, of course.

[59:31] And so I do weigh their decisions.

[59:33] And so the other piece is that I don't have to have a generic it's 60 minutes.

[59:37] Like why does it there be a session need to be 60 minutes?

[59:40] It should be as long as it needs to be or as short as it needs to be to solve the problem.

[59:44] And so I've had times that it's been seven minutes.

[59:46] If I times when it's been 90, if I times when it's three times in one week and if I times where I don't have to have a quote session with Solomon for a month.

[59:56] And so it's usually one of that big decision points where I have more frequent communication to try and figure out an issue or problem.

[60:03] But once I'm kind of on a path, I usually stay on that groove for basically as long as I can.

[60:09] And so over the last two years I had a lot more big directional decisions that I needed to make with kind of the media stuff that we do.

[60:17] And then also the investments in acquisition.com.

[60:20] But a lot of the early feces that we had, we have enough data now that I could make decisions on them.

[60:27] And I have made decisions on them.

[60:29] And so now it's just about sticking to the plant.

[60:32] So what are that process that we have with the block and the new altering one?

[60:36] Yeah, I just literally pull up a Google Doc. I have set a date so that I have all my conversations and one doc.

[60:41] And I just hit enter. So just me, him, me, him.

[60:46] He asked the question I answer like, and it sounds silly to do this, but do it once and you realize that it's weird.

[60:54] It works for me at least.

[60:57] Have you looked at it all the time? What was the first during the first time you gave it?

[61:01] Yeah, I do. I do. We had an unfortunate event that had happened that had knocked on the way that I wanted it to.

[61:10] And I described these types of scenarios as, you're a rare baseball collector and you have an incredibly rare card.

[61:19] Like super, super valuable.

[61:22] And then you're a two-year-old when your away gets into the box and destroys it. What do you do?

[61:31] Do you hit the kid? They don't even know.

[61:34] Do you get upset at your wife? What do you do? You just got to take it.

[61:39] There's no action. You just take it.

[61:45] And so I had one of those incidences from a business perspective.

[61:53] And so I just talked to Solomon about it. He was like, you just take it. He's like, and you get to tell that story someday.

[61:59] About the skin that you have and things you've gone through.

[62:03] And then the next hard time something happens. You'll be able to compare it to that and be like, well, what's that as bad as that?

[62:08] And then you take measures to prepare for the next card.

[62:12] Do the best you can.

[62:14] But even when I thought about that, because in that particular situation, it was like, okay, what information should I have had?

[62:23] This is actually really common. This happens in investing a lot.

[62:26] But like, if you were like, oh, I shouldn't be that investment. I should have bought Bitcoin in 2013.

[62:31] Well, should you have?

[62:34] Because the thing is that if you have that decision making framework, that means that you would have invested 100 other bullshit things at that same time period.

[62:41] Which means that you might, like that decision making calculus probably would have led you to ruin more than the one time that it worked.

[62:48] And so in order for me to learn from the experience, I have to think about what, what do I change about my decision making framework to prevent something like that happening in the future?

[62:58] And if there wasn't anything that could really happen in the decision making framework, then sometimes you just get kicked in the nuts.

[63:05] Sometimes your kid just takes the baby roof thing and treads it and there's nothing you can do about it.

[63:14] Yeah, and to loop it back a little bit, it's like if the goal was for you to enjoy the process of even acquiring that card in the first place.

[63:21] Sure, the card collection.

[63:23] Yeah.

[63:24] A collection isn't really the goal.

[63:26] Yeah, I mean, you're going to die, doesn't matter.

[63:28] But yeah, I mean, I'm the same way, because I collect gym equipment.

[63:32] I got love gym equipment.

[63:34] And I'll give a different example.

[63:37] I had a house in Austin and we had this big, really nice infinity pool that had this nice view.

[63:42] And somebody came over and was like, hey, be honest with me.

[63:47] How many times do you even use this pool?

[63:49] And I was like, I use it five times a day and he was like, what?

[63:51] And I was like, every time I walk past that I look at it and I like it.

[63:57] It's just like somebody's saying, like, Alex, why don't you do more functional training with your body?

[64:01] I was like, my function is to look jacked.

[64:02] I use it every second of every day.

[64:03] What are you talking about?

[64:05] And so it's like, and this is probably a good kind of decision fallacy to look at because a lot of people will criticize your decisions because they use their way of valuing the decision and assume it's the same way you value the decision.

[64:20] And so to the gym equipment thing, I have a lot of gym equipment.

[64:25] And I enjoy spending time with you.

[64:29] Like I like walking in there.

[64:30] I like everything the way it is.

[64:32] I like the pieces.

[64:33] I remember how I got them.

[64:34] I remember the workouts I've done on them.

[64:35] I reminded of the people I did those sessions with when I did a brutal whatever.

[64:39] And so it's just a really positive.

[64:43] They're all basically totems of positive reinforcement.

[64:46] So they're kind of like the card collection.

[64:48] Like people go through their card collection.

[64:50] People go through their car collection because it reminds them of all the positive things that have happened.

[64:55] More so than they collect it because they want to sell it someday.

[64:57] I'm not going to sell it to them.

[64:58] Why would I?

[64:59] I like it.

[65:00] I use it.

[65:01] I think it falls along the same thing as like I enjoy obsessing about it.

[65:06] I enjoy getting everything right.

[65:08] I enjoy the pieces.

[65:09] I enjoy the layout.

[65:10] And like I spend way too much time on it.

[65:11] If I only was optimizing for money which I'm not.

[65:14] I mean it's a component but it's not the only thing.

[65:16] I actually love creating talk about it because I think it's like an interesting look.

[65:20] You know, at any time you hear someone talk about something they love.

[65:22] That's a good really great insight.

[65:23] What do you like?

[65:24] Like a huge talk about strength curves.

[65:26] Yeah.

[65:27] I feel like we'll do that with the equipment because it'll make more sense there.

[65:30] Yeah.

[65:31] But I think at least for me like everybody I think most people.

[65:35] Let's say this way.

[65:37] Regardless of culture.

[65:40] All cultures respect excellence.

[65:43] And excellence comes from nuance of understanding.

[65:47] And so people look at bodybuilders for example and they see the one stage and they're like

[65:52] Oh my god that's so gross.

[65:54] And it's because they don't have any level of appreciation for the

[65:59] many things that go into that.

[66:02] Not just the effort but even from a product perspective they're like, wow.

[66:06] Look at how look at his delts compared to his biceps.

[66:09] Look at where his muscle belly is tying.

[66:11] Look at his latsman.

[66:13] Look how small he was able to keep his waist while also building such a big back.

[66:16] Look at his vascularity compared to somebody else you might be more, you know,

[66:20] greeny, whatever.

[66:21] And so they usually even have the language to describe what they're seeing.

[66:27] And so it's like me trying different wines.

[66:30] It just tastes like wine.

[66:31] You don't even mean but for connoisseur they actually get to enjoy wine so much more because

[66:37] they have so many more ways to enjoy it.

[66:39] Like Eskimos have seven words for snow and we only have one because they have more

[66:43] experience with snow.

[66:44] So they have a deeper understanding of it.

[66:46] And so I think most people respect excellence and excellence only comes from depth.

[66:52] It comes from exposing yourself to the same thing for many, many, many, many periods of time.

[66:56] So that you can pick up those little nuances.

[66:58] If you know what actually if I move my my wrist this way when I do this one I get that little bit at the end.

[67:03] And if I change my my chair angle actually get this other really cool piece and you know what?

[67:08] If I put my thing on my you know if I put my dumbbells on my legs first before I put them over my head I actually get a different,

[67:14] you know, steam watch or whatever it is.

[67:16] And like that just comes from reps which is why there's a really great, I mean in the iron game there's a great

[67:22] culture of passing down these little nuances.

[67:26] And that's kind of like all apprenticeships even though it's not work for a job.

[67:30] Well I guess for the top body bonuses but for most people it's not a job.

[67:34] But there's a there's a craft to it.

[67:36] And I think just being a student of the craft is the goal.

[67:41] Maybe loss of that craftsmanship.

[67:43] Yeah I mean we it's just the crafts have changed you don't mean like developer wasn't a craft.

[67:51] You know before I mean shoot making media wasn't a craft.

[67:56] You know quote being an influencer making content wasn't a craft like these are all crafts there's just new crafts that replaced old crafts.

[68:03] But excellence is always respected across cultures and across times.

[68:08] Like if we go into the future and there's some new thing that I've ever heard of but I find out that this guy's exceptional at it.

[68:12] I will respect him for the effort.

[68:14] And so like chunk down one or chunked up one.

[68:18] I believe that effort is the universal currency of respect.

[68:21] And so this is also for the guys who are out there who want to be more respected.

[68:26] You will always get respect for work.

[68:29] Chinese, Mexican, black, white, Asian, gay, straight, whatever.

[68:36] You work your ass off.

[68:38] People will respect you for it.

[68:40] Now the problem comes when you think you're working your ass off.

[68:43] But you're really not working that hard.

[68:46] And that's where the disconnect is.

[68:48] It's been like I work so hard but it's kind of like the like the 10 hours of prep for presentation versus 30.

[68:54] It's like you think you're working hard until you see what hard looks like and then you're like fuck I was even working nearly as hard.

[69:01] But I see that is encouraging because it means that so many people have so much underutilized potential because they just haven't even learned how to work.

[69:07] I remember when I did my I did a legal internship in France.

[69:11] So I had to do translating legal documents from French English.

[69:15] Horrible.

[69:16] Honestly, it's terrible work.

[69:18] And I was because I thought because people were like you're good at writing.

[69:22] You're persuasive.

[69:23] You should be a lawyer.

[69:24] I'll try that.

[69:25] So I went to a company called ARKEMA.

[69:27] And I did my summer internship there in my junior.

[69:31] And there was this partner at that basically the quote it was corporate law but it was equivalent of a partner.

[69:38] And she walked by my office and she like I think she might have talked to me one other time.

[69:45] Like just to like welcome me to the office and this was the only other times you ever spoke to me.

[69:50] And so she like did one of these like peaked her head into my hole or wherever they were they kept me till they translate to documents.

[69:57] And she was like you know how's it coming or whatever.

[70:01] And I was like man, I'm just working really hard on this and just trying to just work really hard.

[70:07] And she just like looked at me and she just laughed and I was like what what?

[70:12] And she was like you don't even know how to work.

[70:17] And I just remember thinking that and then she just walked away.

[70:25] And I went to the guy who was like two years above me.

[70:29] I was like I was basically trying you know you'd get his job as like the lowest level I was like his peon right.

[70:35] And I was like what the fuck?

[70:37] And he's like yeah, she like they work so many more hours than we do.

[70:44] And like have so much higher stakes than we do.

[70:47] He's like you're just translating documents to like if you get something wrong it's on them not on you.

[70:53] And I remember thinking about that because like I thought I was working really hard but they had to go review everything to make sure I didn't mess up.

[71:00] And especially in a job like law where usually have billable hours like you literally.

[71:10] In order to get paid you have to spend time like just like it's just it's just so clearly connected that those people just kill themselves in terms of the amount of work that they put out.

[71:21] And now that I'm at my position now I 100% agree like I didn't know how to work.

[71:28] Like I was like the idea that I could work or I guess she's like you don't even know how to work yet.

[71:32] And and.

[71:35] And there's only later that I had a different guy was like you'll learn when you get older they're like it just takes time to learn the skill of effort.

[71:43] And so I really genuinely believe that succeeding is in hard.

[71:49] Learning how to try is hard.

[71:52] Once you learn how to try if you just try it anything compared to other people you'll win.

[71:57] You want the bars so low to win nowadays even like and I'll give the you know the objective stats for guys it's like if you're the average guy your $1,000 that you're overweight.

[72:08] And like that's the average and so like if you're just not in debt and not overweight you're already above average.

[72:16] That's it like that's the that's the bar it's just because no one knows how to try and known as how to like suck for a little bit.

[72:24] Once because then you learn that sucking for a little bit has a payoff and then you can just extrapolate that's you know over and over again.

[72:29] But you just have to make it through the first one.

[72:31] But no one's willing to do that because they care so much about everyone else thinks and they.

[72:36] Feel like they should immediately be good because that's what social media tells them.

[72:39] You're working there's kind of like bill hours and it's like there's work that actually counts and there's work that's kind of like bullshit work and the ability to distinguish between that.

[72:48] Mm-hmm.

[72:49] Um, I mean I measure myself on output.

[72:54] We have so how much of the work that I do is correct and done.

[72:59] And so I can usually see if my rate of work has slowed down because I've been doing this for a long enough period of time that I can tell when my.

[73:06] You know if I'm making slides for presentation that it's like my rate of work starts to really drop or my quality of work starts to drop or from writing my quality or my speed starts to drop.

[73:14] I know when that happens sometimes it takes longer to get there sometimes it takes less time.

[73:18] Um, I think that does take some time. I think in the beginning though, you should expect junk work as a junk volume where.

[73:25] This is a hard one but you have to get over it is that while you're still learning it, let's say you reached your point of maximum like production at, you know, hour or five.

[73:34] And then you sell like another five hours of work. I would say do the extra hours of work because you won't know what that limit is until you get there.

[73:41] And if the next five hours of work when you come back the next day you look at it with fresh eyes and you say like, this isn't good enough.

[73:48] I wouldn't see it as a loss. I would see that your ability to see that it wasn't good enough.

[73:54] You would only be able to do if you had already done the five hours of junk work and that still got you further ahead.

[73:59] Then if you hadn't done it at all.

[74:01] And so even if I delete everything, I still have everything in my head. So like for example, we've made videos before where we'll do the entire video in the very end.

[74:10] I feel like we could just do that one again and make it better.

[74:13] And then we do it again and it is way better. So it's not the first video is a waste. It was the first video set up the second video or the first and second set up the third.

[74:20] It's a leads had 19 drafts.

[74:23] Like the 18th set up the 19th and it's not that the first 18 were waste. It was just that they were steps.

[74:29] And so it's just that I mean, I'll go biblical on you again.

[74:33] But I can remember the proverb but it says in all work there is profit.

[74:39] Which I like the more rhetorical way of saying like the work works on you more than you work on it.

[74:45] Which is that you always benefit from work in all work.

[74:51] There is profit in all work there is benefit.

[74:54] And because like the five hours extra that you do editing and then you realize the next day,

[74:59] it's not that that wasn't profitable for you. It's not that you didn't benefit from it.

[75:03] You benefited from it. And then once you benefit from it, that comes back out again and the work benefits.

[75:09] And so I used to say this when I was growing business earlier.

[75:13] I said either the business grows or I grow.

[75:17] We're both. But like one of them is happening because if the business is growing, great.

[75:22] I might not be growing at all. Maybe I am, but the business growing for sure.

[75:25] The business stops growing. It's getting hard. So I start growing.

[75:28] And then when I grow enough, the business starts growing again.

[75:31] And so the growth is always happening. It's just where you're measuring it.

[75:34] Right.

[75:35] So let's say someone's a bonus video. It's like, step one. They broke the belief that it needs to be happy.

[75:40] It's useful. You know, step two.

[75:43] But in terms of value and the process of improving step three.

[75:47] But how, like for you was it going into environments where you learned,

[75:52] you saw people being useful, you saw people working hard.

[75:55] How did someone do that there? Young and.

[75:58] Everything comes down to find figuring out what the input out put equation is.

[76:01] If you don't know the input out of put equation of getting good at your skill,

[76:05] you will be lost until you find it.

[76:07] And so like if you want to be a good coder, it's 10,000 hours of coding.

[76:09] If you want to be a good editor, it's 10,000 hours of editing.

[76:11] You want to be a good salesman, it's 10,000 hours on the phone.

[76:13] If you want to be like, it just is.

[76:15] And so for me, as soon as I figure that out, then I just want to start chipping away at it.

[76:19] As fast as I can. And so if it's like, I can do 10,000 hours over 10 years,

[76:23] or I can do it over four years.

[76:25] And it's funny because people see a 2,000 hour work year,

[76:28] but there's like there's so many more hours than that.

[76:31] Like it's ridiculous. There's so many more hours than 2,000 hours.

[76:35] Like there's 104 days of the year that are weekends.

[76:40] And if you add in federal holidays and two weeks of paid vacation,

[76:45] you have 129 days a year out of 365.

[76:49] And of the remaining days that you quote work,

[76:52] you work eight of the 24.

[76:55] So like there's so many more hours that you can do stuff and get better

[77:00] than people give themselves credit for.

[77:02] And so it's just about, as he has like,

[77:05] I'm used to add a little tick for it where my ring is.

[77:09] Find the input output equation and then dump as much as you possibly can

[77:14] into the input side and get rid of everything that interferes with it.

[77:19] Which also means the people in your life who interfere with you do an input

[77:23] out of equation.

[77:25] The environment, tool cues, so as in like,

[77:28] if you like I work in as as close as I can in no windows,

[77:32] no sound, that's how I work.

[77:34] I don't want any distraction.

[77:36] Some people work better with whatever.

[77:38] I have a hard time believing that.

[77:40] Maybe they enjoy working more.

[77:42] I doubt they work better.

[77:43] Some people are like, I listen to music when I work.

[77:46] There's just a ton of research that shows that that's just like empirically you work less.

[77:50] Well, it's like you just don't.

[77:52] Now instrumental that doesn't have words, maybe,

[77:55] but like you're using horse power listening to words, period.

[77:58] And so I want all horse power, like even if you're bouncing on your chair,

[78:01] like you're using brain power.

[78:03] And so I want to use nothing.

[78:05] I want to use a hundred percent of my power on the task at hand.

[78:09] And that's it.

[78:10] And that means that if I've also stressors outside of my life,

[78:13] people who are bothering me,

[78:14] not just like, you know, people literally interrupting me,

[78:17] but just problems.

[78:18] It's like I want to resolve those so that I can put all my attention here.

[78:21] Because if I'm trying to type it, I'm thinking about, you know,

[78:24] this snafu I had with somebody, do with the snafu,

[78:28] and then you'll be able to work more clearly.

[78:31] What if someone doesn't know what they want to apply the input into,

[78:37] yeah, like they don't know that it's writing, they don't know that it's.

[78:40] Yeah.

[78:42] I think that it would be who you, so like everything is so, okay.

[78:50] It's the fallacy of the perfect pick.

[78:53] So people think when they're starting out one that they should find something

[78:58] they're passionate about, to that the first thing that pick is the last thing

[79:02] they're going to do for us their life.

[79:03] And I think both of those are false.

[79:04] So we'll start with the first one.

[79:06] So the fallacy of finding your purpose or finding your passion, excuse me,

[79:09] is that you're going to love something so much that you immediately fall off with it.

[79:13] Some people do.

[79:15] The vast majority don't.

[79:17] And real, real, I liked fitness.

[79:22] But as soon as I started my gym, which I thought was quite pursuing my passion,

[79:26] my life's stopping about fitness.

[79:27] It was about business.

[79:28] And then I had to learn that and I sucked at it.

[79:30] And so like even the idea that I'm just going to do my passion

[79:35] isn't even the reality of, quote, doing your passion.

[79:38] Because doing my passion became work and started hard trainers and

[79:41] systemizing onboarding and getting them trained up so they wouldn't suck on the floor because I had to do other things.

[79:45] And all of a sudden, I made my quote passion into work as other people define work.

[79:52] And so you create passion.

[79:59] You don't find it.

[80:01] And you create it by being willing to suck for a very long period of time until you get good.

[80:05] And then we get good stuff.

[80:06] You tend to like it.

[80:07] One.

[80:09] The second fallacy was that you, whatever you, is the perfect pick is that you're going to pick the perfect thing the first time.

[80:19] Life is long.

[80:20] People change career directories more now than ever before.

[80:24] And so I prefer the process of approximation, which is,

[80:29] can I just get directional and then iterate?

[80:33] And so it's like, okay, do you like words or do you like numbers?

[80:37] If you were like, I like numbers.

[80:39] Okay, all these careers probably not for you.

[80:43] Great.

[80:44] One directional change.

[80:45] All right.

[80:46] And then within there, it's like, okay, do I like money numbers?

[80:49] Or do I like data numbers?

[80:51] Or do I like computer numbers?

[80:53] It's like, okay, I like data numbers.

[80:56] Great.

[80:57] So now we're already in a like a zillion career paths in this direction.

[81:01] But the thing is that if you then start getting good at becoming a data analyst for an oil company,

[81:06] and then you decide that you want to pivot into media buying, there's going to be a lot of generalizable skills there because it was all about data,

[81:15] and you did have to learn a lot of stuff.

[81:17] And what I will say is that you get these unique carryovers that only you will have.

[81:22] And so Steve Jobs tells a story about how he took calligraphy.

[81:26] Right?

[81:27] And it seems useless at the time.

[81:30] And in fast-forward when they had the Mac, they started having different fonts.

[81:33] And they only have different fonts because Steve Jobs, that one time took calligraphy.

[81:36] And so the lessons you learn on the first thing you do don't become a parent,

[81:42] sometimes until the third, fourth or fifth thing you do.

[81:45] But that third, fourth or fifth thing you do, the fact that you did that first thing gives you unique advantage, compared to everyone else who didn't.

[81:51] And so following the tried and true path, there's nothing wrong with that.

[81:55] But there's also nothing wrong with learning, like there is never a downside to learning more skills, period.

[82:02] Because you are able to create more unique solutions to problems that you present in the future

[82:08] because of things you've done the past.

[82:10] And so I'm sure that right now there's not a lot of really jacked investors.

[82:16] But I'll bet you that there are things that I have taken from my body building a parallel thing past

[82:22] that I can see more uniquely than some of them can.

[82:25] And I know more about fitness industry investments than probably they do, both from a consumer and from an owner.

[82:31] I know I still get calls from many, many multi-billion dollar portfolios.

[82:36] They're like, hey, we're about to invest in this change in Fuddy thing.

[82:41] And I've swayed multi-billion dollars of decisions being like, I think they're a dog.

[82:44] I think they're going to go down and here's why.

[82:46] And they're like, fuck, we didn't see that in the data.

[82:48] Yeah, but if you were in, you'd know that.

[82:50] And so, but I wouldn't, if I was just another data analyst they'd never call me.

[82:54] And so, the idea of the perfect pit, perfect pick is just a fallacy.

[83:00] So, pick a direction.

[83:02] It's just closer further.

[83:03] This is closer.

[83:04] Okay, cool.

[83:05] Getting warm.

[83:06] Think about getting warm, getting hot, rather than this is it.

[83:09] And so then you can just start approximating.

[83:12] And the work that you did on a warm before it gets hot isn't wasted because you have a new lens that other people who just want straight there.

[83:17] Won't have.

[83:18] Even if it takes you longer because again, life's super long.

[83:21] And you're turned and Peggy turned who started to panic express their decadbillionaires now.

[83:26] They started their first location at 40 years ago.

[83:30] But he's 75 now.

[83:31] So he wasn't like, you know, he's 35.

[83:34] Start first location.

[83:36] First.

[83:37] Right?

[83:38] Like, and they're richer than most people are, well, ever bay.

[83:43] And so like, if it takes you 10 years or 20 years, it's fine.

[83:49] But I also bet you that they, now I have to learn this from them.

[83:52] But I'll bet you they did things before Panda Express.

[83:55] They had nothing to do with running Chinese chicken chops.

[83:58] Right?

[84:00] But those skills still translated over.

[84:02] I was a management consultant, space iron intelligence for the military before starting a gym.

[84:06] How does that translate?

[84:08] Well, I learned a consulting process.

[84:10] And the learning of consulting process is learning how to solve problems.

[84:13] And so I use that with my gyms because the consulting process you go to experts and you ask them what they do.

[84:19] So I started in for all these gym owners because they were willing to talk about the gyms.

[84:22] And I would drive out there every weekend because I had time.

[84:24] And I would just spend time with the gym and I'd be like, how do you onboard people?

[84:27] What are your contracts look like?

[84:28] What terms do you use?

[84:29] How do you do with cancellations?

[84:30] How do you do with turn?

[84:31] How do you do with the client cards?

[84:32] Now, I'd ask all of them.

[84:33] And everyone's so awesome.

[84:34] You're like, oh, I do that.

[84:35] That's good.

[84:36] I'll take that one down.

[84:38] I'll steal that for me.

[84:39] Then I would just do that over and over and over again.

[84:42] But I got that from consulting.

[84:43] Other gym owners didn't apply consulting for him because they weren't consultants first.

[84:46] So if I maybe started straight into gym ownership,

[84:48] right out of college rather than taking two years to be a consultant,

[84:50] I might not have gone as far.

[84:52] So like, what felt like a complete waste of time when I was in it, which it did,

[84:57] might have been the thing that made me succeed in the next thing.

[85:01] And so even if you're in it right now, the only thing that I can say is that you want to try as hard as you can and get as many skills as you can in that field.

[85:06] Even if you don't think you're going to use it later.

[85:08] And I'll wrap this with this.

[85:10] You guys haven't seen it.

[85:11] It's a worthwhile move.

[85:12] It's something called some dog minor.

[85:15] So the premise of the movie is this kidnyslam's in India.

[85:19] It basically just tells his story of just like trials and tribulations.

[85:24] He just says bad luck after bad luck after bad luck.

[85:26] The whole movie.

[85:28] And then by chance at the end of the movie, he gets on their equivalent of,

[85:32] who wants to be a minor.

[85:35] And so I think it's like 12 questions or something.

[85:37] There's 12 or 20, I don't remember.

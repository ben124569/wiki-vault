[00:00] 24 rules of investing. These are all structured as if then statements. If we learn a principle,

[00:05] then we can continue to use that winning principle over and over again. The reason some of the

[00:08] greatest investors publish books about their principles is because they know if people make the

[00:12] right decisions, they get the right outcomes over a long enough time horizon. My introduction was it,

[00:16] and I make these videos because I hope that if you have a 3 million to a hundred million dollar

[00:19] company, you'll ask us to invest in it and we can have a grab. If you can't buy it twice,

[00:24] don't buy it once, and realistically probably three, four, five, six times when I got into investing,

[00:29] I used to think, oh, I'm going to put like a third into this, and they're like, you know,

[00:32] your biggest allocation might be 10%. Oh, if you can't buy twice, don't buy once. If you're worried

[00:38] about it, you can buy insurance for it. You can get insurance on anything.

[00:45] For example, people like I'm afraid of running out of money. You can literally buy

[00:48] money for the rest of your life. You can literally give money and they will have a guaranteed income

[00:52] until you die with the affordability. So if you have a specific concern, just buy insurance for it and

[00:57] know that it's covered. If a deal feels like a grand slam, get a second opinion. Whenever I'm looking

[01:02] at something and something looks amazing, I automatically send it to other people, I must not be seeing

[01:06] something like I need someone else's eyes on this. It's a good easy decision making rule for

[01:10] yourself for investing. If you don't know how you can lose money, don't do it until you do. There's

[01:15] always a way to lose money in the deal, and you not only want to find a way to lose money, but you

[01:19] want to find all the ways you can lose money in the deal. Right? We're always controlling for the unknown,

[01:23] or the unknowable. We want to minimize that the highest degree possible. So if you don't know how you

[01:27] can lose money, don't do the deal until you do. If it feels rushed, don't do it. A lot of people

[01:33] will try to apply pressure to you. They're trying to say like, hey, do this deal with me, hey,

[01:36] give me this money, hey, can you let me this thing? If someone tries to pressure you, pause. If you

[01:40] feel rushed, don't do it. If you only have one deal in the table, don't do the deal. Always

[01:46] have backup deals. Imagine you're dating, and there's only one girl in the planet. You're going

[01:50] to find a way to think that that girl and if you're your gender's reverse flip, right? Right?

[01:54] Whatever. You don't upset. There's only one person on the planet, then you're going to find a way

[01:58] to make that work. And so it's kind of the same thing with deals. If you only have one deal in the

[02:02] table, you're going to keep telling yourself, maybe this is a good deal, because you have nothing

[02:05] else to compare it to. You always want to have a plethora of options to choose from. And until you

[02:09] get those many options to choose from, don't move forward because what happens is you artificially

[02:13] make that girl look a lot better, or that person, or that deal looks a lot better when there's nothing

[02:18] else to compare it to. If you buy with the intention of selling, you're not investing, you're trading.

[02:22] Best thing is about very very long time horizons. It's a whole different set of rules.

[02:26] Where you get in trouble is where you're trying to apply business stuff to investing, or investing

[02:31] stuff to business like they're different skills to master. If we don't agree, we don't do it.

[02:37] This comes into play when you have partnership. This has saved me so many mistakes. I'm usually the

[02:42] Yesman. I tend to see more upside-less downside. Most entrepreneurial people are that way, because we

[02:46] have to be. Because if we actually focused on the likelihood of success, which is usually low for most

[02:50] entrepreneurial things, you would never get started. It's good to have a partner who balances that.

[02:54] But be, they actually have to balance it. If they're just a Yesman and they always bend to your will,

[02:58] then they're not actually providing value. There's a recent Yending A or equally weighted in the symbol.

[03:05] If you don't agree, don't move forward. Even if I have decision making authority,

[03:10] I still won't move forward until we agree. As a tangent and to marriage stuff,

[03:13] we get asked this all the time. They're like, well, you know, push comes to shove. Somebody has the

[03:16] upper hand. Honestly, no, we keep talking about until we agree. We don't make the decision until we

[03:21] both agree. And it's been one of the earliest pieces of advice we got in it's one of the ones that

[03:25] paid us the most dividends. If it's complicated, past, if it feels above your head, it probably is.

[03:31] People want to feel fancy. They want to get into the room. They want to do these deals. But if you don't

[03:35] get it, you're going to get fought. If you have complete understanding of something, the risk goes

[03:39] down because you understand the variable. But you're barely catching on, you might as well be gambling,

[03:42] which is not the way to invest. FOMO means slow down. If you feel that emotional, like, I'm going

[03:49] to miss out on something slow down. This is a decision making variable. You feel that emotion

[03:53] slow down. These are principles. You start flexing these like muscles. If this, then that. If this,

[03:58] then that, it preserves your ability to make better decisions over time. And if you apply all of these

[04:02] things to all of the decisions you make, you will have outsized returns over a long time,

[04:06] if you don't get the information you need to make the decision, you don't make the decision.

[04:12] And I know this sounds ridiculous, but many of you do this. You just go off the hype. You go off

[04:16] from off an email or phone call. Get the information you need. No model, no deal. If someone

[04:22] doesn't send me their proposal for how something's going to grow or how something's going to

[04:26] improve or how they're going to add value. And there's no deal. I don't want to hear a story of it.

[04:31] I want to see the math find it. I want to see the projections. And then when I look at those things,

[04:34] I can make the decision like, is this reasonable? What assumptions are this based on? Do I think

[04:38] those assumptions are reasonable or probable? And what information can I bring to this decision?

[04:42] What are the things that need to believe that have to be true for this to occur?

[04:46] If someone's non-responsive, no deal. Communications are one of the most important things when you're

[04:50] doing any kind of business in general. And I judge someone very quickly on how meticulous they are

[04:55] in their responses and how quick they are to respond in general. Now if someone says, hey, I received

[05:00] your email. I'll get back to you in two days. And then they get back to me in two days. That's fine.

[05:03] This is about expectation setting and expectation meeting. I expect especially in this process where

[05:07] I'm just getting to know you. What you say is going to happen is going to happen. It's going to happen.

[05:11] It's one of the easiest ways to build a reputation is, do what you're going to say. So what you're

[05:14] going to do. And if someone's not doing that with you, don't do the deal. If it costs peace of mind,

[05:20] don't buy it. So if anything costs me my sleep or something that I'm worried about as a result of

[05:26] me making an investment or purchasing decision, I don't buy it because the cost is too high.

[05:31] If it doesn't build your reputation, don't do it. No neutral moves. Your brand, personally,

[05:37] your reputation is the one thing that you take with you forever. And you absolutely can lose it.

[05:42] And it can be irreparably damaged. I'd only do it if it builds my reputation. When we do that,

[05:48] we continue to reinvest in our reputation in our personal brand, which gives us compounding

[05:52] returns over our entire lifespan in terms of relationships in terms of literally financial

[05:57] return in all other aspects of life. Only invest if it builds your reputation. And if it doesn't

[06:02] build, don't do it. No track record, no deal. Performance over charisma. The best predictor of

[06:09] future performance is past performance. Sure, they have a model. Fantastic other logists who do deal

[06:14] just great. Oh, they're being very responsive. Phenomenal. If they have no track record,

[06:18] might they be successful? Yes. But if I invest in every deal that doesn't have track record,

[06:22] is that a good way to invest? Probably not. I'd like to Napoleon like to say,

[06:26] I'd rather have lucky generals. Someone's going to probably do their deal. Doesn't have to be you.

[06:30] If it's the same thing you've always done well with, do more of it. We as a human's

[06:34] entrepreneurs, we like having variety. The thing is, is that a lot of investing a lot of

[06:38] compounding comes from doing more of the same thing. So it's like, hey man, I've done three hard

[06:41] money loans. They've all been awesome and technical. Then you should probably consider doing a

[06:44] fourth rather than starting to get into crypto day trading. So what happens is you start to build

[06:48] your own track record. And so you can start looking back over your shoulder and be like, okay,

[06:51] let's look at all the things that I've done. These have been the things that have worked well. Maybe

[06:54] I'm better at this stuff. And so that's the idea. Once you find something that you start to

[06:57] get good at, you more of it. Because the thing is, is that your luck will improve the more you do.

[07:01] Always underbarer. Any number no matter how big it is, multiply by zero is still zero.

[07:05] I tend to be very risk of risk when it comes to debt. Debt introduces risk into any equation.

[07:10] If you are going to borrow, then underbarer. So even though you could juice your return by getting

[07:15] more, remember that there is a likelihood over a long enough time rise in that if you overdo so

[07:18] on a consistent basis, you will get zero. Always underbarer. Then you won't make as much money,

[07:22] but you won't lose it. Ask stupid questions, define terms, draw pictures, see examples. And if you

[07:29] can't draw it back, you don't get it. I start every single call when somebody's going to bring me something.

[07:34] I'll be like, pretend I'm a golden retriever that doesn't speak in, walk me through this. There's no

[07:38] advantage to somebody thinking you know more than you do. Not, but there is advantage just to

[07:42] you knowing more than they think you do. Always play the fool. If we're not in the GP, we're not in

[07:49] the deal. Once you have 10, 20, 30 million in investible assets, just say I want to part of the GP.

[07:54] I don't know what the GP is. It's general partner limited part of the people with general partners

[07:57] are basically the people who run the things that get an exercise to the pie versus limited part of

[08:00] she actually invest in money. We only do deals with the work part of the GP because I want to make sure

[08:03] that we have a part of the people who are really running this thing. If it's a bad person, it's a bad deal.

[08:08] Layla has any impeccable people, pick her. It's unbelievable. My entire relationship's never been wrong.

[08:14] And it's why I've been wrong all the time. I'm like, this guy's right. Layla's never been wrong.

[08:17] Bad partners doesn't matter what the paper says. Don't do it. There are so many reasons you should

[08:21] not do a deal. You'd be saying no way more you should be saying yes. No contract, no deal. This is a

[08:27] really important one for me. Got to have contracts for everything. Contracts serve the purpose of

[08:31] setting clear expectation. What happens if you lose all my shit? What happens if you don't do it?

[08:36] You said you're going to win. Whatever is if I don't do it, I said I was going to do it. What happens?

[08:39] You got to walk through that. If you can't walk through in the beginning, you're definitely not going to

[08:42] walk through it when it actually happens. And anyone who says, I only do handshake deals. I don't do

[08:46] contracts run the other way. Not once has someone approached me that way and they not be

[08:52] an unbelievably shady. If there's anything you give in this video, if someone says, I don't believe

[08:57] in contracts, be like, I don't believe in dealing dealing with that contracts. Sorry. Clear expectations.

[09:02] Good. If you're the one people are doing business with, I like to pretend like the contract doesn't

[09:07] exist. You actually would be clear when you're writing the contracts in the terms. But then as

[09:11] soon as that process is over, live as though the contract doesn't exist. You go shaded as

[09:15] those the only thing that matters. Let's say I have a service as relationships that's a year long.

[09:17] I want to mentally think even though they've committed to a year, I'm only weak to weak. They don't

[09:22] have to pay me next month. If you go on the defensive, when you're contracting, but you go on the

[09:25] offensive, when you're in delivery, you kind of get the best of both worlds.

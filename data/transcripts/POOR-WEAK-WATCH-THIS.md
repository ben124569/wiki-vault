[00:00] So I was having this conversation with a friend of mine who

[00:03] exited his business for 15 million and he was like,

[00:05] I think that you're so successful in business because of the principles that you learned from bodybuilding.

[00:09] We had like a 30-minute discussion about that one topic and I think it's really,

[00:14] really important some of the things that we talked about, or it's just very interesting.

[00:17] And so the nice thing about what I want to talk about today is if you're really good at business

[00:22] and you want to get Jack to shred it, everything that I'm about to tell you will apply.

[00:26] And if you're really good at being Jack's and shred it and really bad at making money,

[00:30] then everything about to tell you will apply because there's actually so many similarities,

[00:34] but not in the way that you would think.

[00:35] All right? And so as I was thinking about this, right?

[00:38] Between bodybuilding and business, one of the key things that matters is consistency, right?

[00:43] A lot of people think that intensity is what wins so they work really, really hard at business

[00:46] for a short period of time and then they stop and they look and they're like,

[00:49] I haven't made a lot of money, right? Or they work out really, really, really hard

[00:51] for a couple weeks or a couple months and then they're like, hey,

[00:54] I don't look like Arnold Schwarzenegger, like what gives and then they stop, right?

[00:57] And so I would always rather have somebody work out with a 70% intensity for 10 years, right?

[01:04] Then somebody work out with 120% intensity for one month, right?

[01:07] And the same degree happens within business, right?

[01:10] If you just consistently do something for a long period of time,

[01:12] you're going to be really good at it because the total volume of work performed will surpass

[01:18] the total effort from that guy who's being really intense for a short period of time.

[01:22] Because one of the things that happens I think over time is that you develop

[01:25] the skillset of consistency, like it in and of itself is a character trait that you develop

[01:31] through doing it, right? So if you're like, I'm not that good at sticking through things,

[01:34] then the best way to get better is sticking through things is to stick with things because then that

[01:38] just like a muscle becomes better for you, right? So here's another really cool similarity between

[01:42] bodybuilding and business. There are a lot of guys who are really good at one thing.

[01:47] So they're really good at, you know, entrepreneurs are really good at sales, right?

[01:50] Are they really good at marketing? Are they really good at product? Are they really good at

[01:53] whatever, right? And to the same degree in bodybuilding, there are people who have really good chests

[01:57] who are really good backs, they're really good legs, and then they have other weaknesses. And so in the

[02:01] world, you probably heard this before, which is you need to double down in your strengths. And I think

[02:05] that there's a certain degree of truth to that. There's also a big lie that's woven in. And so

[02:10] here's the similarity between the two of bodybuilding and business. Your weakest link in your business

[02:16] will be the constraint of the business. You don't necessarily have to be the person who fulfills

[02:20] that weak link. But the business must be balanced. So just like your physique must be balanced,

[02:27] so too must be the business. And so just like you have body parts, you have departments, right,

[02:31] within a business. So you've got marketing and sales, you've got your biceps and triceps, right?

[02:35] And so you have these similarities that are there, but you can't just be all sales and marketing,

[02:39] right? You have to have a back end. You have to have good culture. You have to have finance.

[02:43] You have to have good accounting. These are all things that must happen in order for the business

[02:47] to overall be successful over the long term. And to the same degree in bodybuilding, you can't just

[02:51] have all chest because over a long period of time, A, you'll be on balance and you'll probably

[02:54] into yourself. And you won't look good the whole time because the more you get that imbalance,

[02:57] the more unbalanced your body, look and it looks stupid and it doesn't work. Right? So over a long

[03:01] enough time horizon, you can be unbalanced in the beginning. It's natural for some people to have

[03:04] naturally better legs or be naturally better at sales and marketing, be naturally better at

[03:08] products and fulfillment. But over time, you have to develop those weaknesses because otherwise,

[03:12] those will be the things that can strain your business and your growth,

[03:15] and you overall physique or business that you build. So I thought that was a really interesting

[03:18] parallel between the two. Another one's really good. Hold on. Skill comes from volume, right?

[03:23] And it's high quality volume. So this is one that's really interesting. So I've worked out with

[03:29] friends of mine who are entrepreneurs. And I can't tell you how many times they've worked out with me

[03:33] and I'm like, hey man, change this, do this, move your elbows this way, you know, reposition your body.

[03:38] And for some reason, it's happened almost every time with back training. And they were like

[03:43] do I've been training for 10 years? And these aren't like fitness people. They're like business

[03:46] people who just were like, hey, I'll go work out here. And they're like, dude, I've never felt my back

[03:50] before. Like I did like today with you, I've realized that I've never felt my back when I trained.

[03:54] And so think about this for a second. For 10 years or five years, these guys have been training,

[03:59] they're consistent, right? For 10 years or five, they've been training and thinking that they were

[04:04] training their back, but they weren't. And so the question is, how many people are in business

[04:08] and thinking they're marketing, thinking they're selling when in fact they are not? And so what's

[04:14] interesting about this is, Navarrov Council this about specified or specific knowledge, right?

[04:18] Is a specific knowledge is knowledge that can be learned, but cannot be taught. And so the way that

[04:24] people learn it is through application and doing. If you can learn in school, it's not valuable, right?

[04:29] And so the way that it is learned is through apprenticeship and mentorship, right? And that's why

[04:34] I'm such a big proponent of finding people who have done what you want to do and then learning from them

[04:38] because there's so many nuances and whispers and details and how they execute that create the

[04:44] excellence. And so I'm going to go on this tangent for first seconds. I think it's really important.

[04:47] One, my good friend, Dr. Jerkashi, PhD, one of the top two smartest people I know my whole life.

[04:54] He looked at this big research study that they looked in academia, which was that people who have

[04:59] mentors in academia accomplish four times more than people with identical character traits,

[05:06] identical, degrees and pedigrees and all that stuff who did not have a mentor. Think about that.

[05:11] Four times the production because of the level of a specific knowledge that gets transferred from one

[05:17] person to another. For me, I think about that and like, man, so how much specific not like, what does

[05:21] it take to get specific knowledge? Because people ask me they're like, man, you sound so convicted.

[05:24] Like, you're content seems so different than some of the stuff that I see out there. And I was thinking

[05:27] about this for a second. I was having a conversation with Brooke Estia who runs a $50 million

[05:32] life coaching business. She's one of our really close friends. And she's like, I get the same

[05:35] feedback too. And she's like, I wish I could teach that thing. And so we're having discussion about it.

[05:39] And I was like, I think what it is is it's it's it's first principles like derivatives. Like

[05:46] most people that you see have not done the thing that they are teaching. What they do is they are

[05:52] they are spouting things that they have heard and just regurgitating them. And so they do not understand

[05:58] why it is that way. They are saying it is that way. But they lack the details. They lack the

[06:04] nuance of having done it and being able to troubleshoot it because they didn't actually build the

[06:09] thing. They observed it being built and then laid it to their audience. And most people haven't done it.

[06:14] And that is why things sound different. So it is back to the specific knowledge and the

[06:19] difference between bodybuilding and business. And so you have to do the thing well, like training

[06:25] your back well, do the sales well in order for your skill to improve. And the way to do that

[06:31] is a lot of times by having somebody who is much better than you, teach you how to do it.

[06:35] All right, because unfortunately the academic system that exists sucks. And so we have to pay or learn

[06:41] in other ways. And I think you can either go to a company and learn those skills specific knowledge

[06:45] from doing it or you can do it yourself. Like I like the idea of getting earning while you learn.

[06:50] Right? Go to a company. Get paid to learn. Right? I think it's like one of the best things in the

[06:53] entire world. My 18 year old are now 19 because he's graduated. He's grown up one year.

[06:57] My 19 year old neighbor really wanted to learn how to sell. And he was like, how do I learn how to sell?

[07:01] I was like, why don't you just start working on our sales team? And I'll like you learn how to sell.

[07:05] He was like, okay. And now a year later, he went through three ranks of sales people.

[07:10] A sales position in our companies got from one of twice. And now he's a really good salesman.

[07:14] And he couldn't sell for crap. Like a year ago. Right? And he learned the skill by doing it.

[07:18] Right? And now he can teach the skill because he's done it. Right? So a lot of people try and do

[07:23] things too fast. Right? You gotta feel it. Just like in bodybuilding. Like you have to,

[07:27] you have to do it with the specific intention behind it. So so many people go through the motions.

[07:33] And they think they're marketing. They think they're marketing. But really what they're doing is they're like,

[07:37] no, no, no, we do the marketing. We do that stuff. Right? No, I do some of that back stuff. I do some of

[07:42] that stuff. Right? So these similarities between the two because people think they're executing,

[07:47] but they're actually not. And then they wonder why they look the same or why their business

[07:50] is the same level as it was when they started. And so let me transition to one of the most

[07:55] important points that we hit on for bodybuilding and business. Nothing replaces hunger. Nothing replaces

[08:00] fanaticism. And I think this is really interesting because a lot of people think, this is a really

[08:05] good one because I've dealt with a lot of fitness professionals. They think that they are very

[08:10] disciplined. They think they're very disciplined. But I'll tell you what, they're not because they like

[08:15] fitness, which is why they do fitness. Right? And they've done it for a long time because they enjoy doing it.

[08:20] But when it comes to business, they don't enjoy doing it. And so they're not disciplined. Because

[08:24] if you were disciplined, you would do it even though you do not enjoy doing it. Right? So they think

[08:28] that they do this thing of fitness because they're disciplined. But it's because they enjoy it.

[08:32] And other people do not enjoy it. And so they assume because other people do not enjoy it,

[08:37] that because they do it, it means they are disciplined. And that is not the reality. They do it because

[08:41] they like it. The only people who went in the long term, the only people that in my observation

[08:45] who have become super fit, right? Or super successful in bodybuilding or business, are people who can

[08:50] do it for a long time. And the best way to do it for a long time is to be obsessed with it.

[08:54] It's to actually enjoy doing it. Right? Because most fitness professionals that I know have been fit

[08:57] for a long time, they spend their free time reading about fitness. They spend their free time reading

[09:01] books on nutrition. They spend their free time trying new exercise selections. Like a different training

[09:06] you know, philosophies. They try all these different things because they love it and they think about it

[09:10] all their free time. And so when I think one of the things that that takes to be successful in either

[09:14] there is the self-awareness of like, if you want to be an exceptional physique, right? The way to do it

[09:20] is to like it. And if you don't like it, then you may want to adjust your expectations because you're

[09:25] not going to beat someone who does like it and also works that long. And so to the same degree

[09:30] in business, if you're like, let's say, in fitness and you wanted to get in business and my

[09:35] duty, this is not a channel for fitness business stuff. If you were in that show and you wanted to be

[09:39] good at business, but you just don't spend your time reading about it. And you know, spend your

[09:43] waking time thinking about it. You're not always reinvesting because all you want to do is just

[09:47] consume more information on business than you're not going to beat someone who does. Right? Because

[09:51] they're beating you in their off time. They're working 16 hours a day. High quality effort because they

[09:56] love it and they're fanatical about it. And so if you were a technician of any kind and you don't

[10:00] love business, then the likely that you're going to be very good at business is very low. And so I think

[10:05] people need to adjust their expectations. You can be a technician to make 200,000 years and that's

[10:08] totally fine. That's totally okay. Just be really good at the thing that you do. You don't need to be

[10:12] good at business. Right? But you need to you need to adjust your expectations in thinking I've been

[10:17] in business for however long. I've been going to the gym working back for however long and not doing it.

[10:22] Right? Because you don't spend any time thinking about it. Right? But if you spend your time thinking

[10:25] about all day long, you will eventually correct your form. You will eventually do it right. You will

[10:30] seek out the mentors and people that you need who can actually get you unstuck. One of the last

[10:34] points that I figured out for myself is I actually have different working styles in business than I do

[10:42] in fitness. So that's going to interesting. So I'm going to be honest. So in fitness and this is

[10:45] taking me now 17 years to figure out, is that I actually like working out with people, not necessarily

[10:51] with them, but in an environment where there are other people. Because my whole life I was like,

[10:55] man, I want to have the sickest home gym of all time. And now that I have the sickest home gym of

[10:59] all time, for those of you who don't know if we have a ridiculous home gym, I'll just put that way.

[11:04] I actually realized that I enjoy going to a $24 a month, large box gym that has all the equipment,

[11:11] other people around me. I train harder. I train longer when there are other people around me.

[11:15] And I think that's just because I'm insecure or I have, you know, tendencies towards insecurities.

[11:20] And I like going to the gym and proving myself and proving in front of other people that I can

[11:24] still work hard. When I'm alone, I have significantly less motivation to do so. But here's what's

[11:28] interesting. The flip side is that in business, I work better alone. I work better in isolation,

[11:34] right, with no one around me. I think that it's important to figure out what your motivator is. Like,

[11:38] I love business. And I'm intrinsically motivated to do it because I love it. All I do, all they

[11:43] long is think about business. All they long. When I work out, I have an extrinsic motivator. So if you

[11:48] can think to yourself, like, what is my intrinsic motivation for, or what is, what is my motivator?

[11:52] And this is funny for me because I just figured this out. Like, I have this home gym. And since

[11:56] pretty much I opened my first gym in 2013, I was 21 now, right? Since then, I've always had a gym that I owned.

[12:03] That I would work out it and it was always alone. And my motivation for fitness pretty much

[12:07] dropped in 2013 till now. Now, I have discipline as a character trade and so I'll continue to work out.

[12:12] But not nearly as hard as I used to. And I used to, like, really look forward to it. And I haven't

[12:17] really looked forward to it for a long time, right? But now, as I'm traveling more, I'm working on

[12:23] another gym that I'm realizing that I actually look forward to going to other gyms more than I look

[12:27] forward to going to my own gym, which I thought was really interesting. So I figured I would just share that with you.

[12:30] So to bring to bring this home, I want to hammer, I want to hammer the big points that I think

[12:35] matter most. The first thing is, the people who like the thing are the ones who are going to

[12:38] succeed in the long term. If you don't like the thing, you're never going to win because you're not going to

[12:42] beat someone who does like the thing. Period. Two, if you want to advance faster, then find somebody who

[12:47] has specific knowledge in the thing, whether it's business or bodybuilding, you have to do it right in

[12:52] order to make progress. Number three, consistency will always beat intensity. So if you're really like,

[12:57] hey, man, I've done a hundred reach out. I got this one the other day. Someone was like, hey, man,

[13:00] I did your rule of 100 and over the last eight weeks that it 160 reach out. I was like, well,

[13:04] you were about 9,000 reach out short. So you didn't do the rule of 100. The rule 100 is 100 every

[13:09] day and not 160 over eight weeks. Hmm. Right. And so you can't just be intense for a tiny period

[13:16] and then expect to work. It's like you have to go to the gym every day. You have to go. You have to

[13:20] put the reps in for your app on calls or app on reach out. So making a hundred ads or whatever it is

[13:24] every single day and you have to do it for a long time because then you'll get better. Number four,

[13:29] the people who are intrinsically motivated, I think will work better on their own. People are

[13:33] extrinsically motivated, work better in areas where they can show off. So if you like that,

[13:38] then join the masterminds, join the groups where you can show off. I'm going to be real with you.

[13:43] Everybody cares about whatever else things. I don't care what anyone says. Right. And so if you have

[13:47] that deficiency like I do crippling insecurity, then try and try and harness the insecurity to help

[13:53] you help it help you, right? Rather than have it hurt you. Just like bodybuilding and business,

[13:57] there's always going to be weak links in your game. Right. weak links in your physique.

[14:02] You can be really good at sales. You can be really good at benching, right? You can be really

[14:06] good at one thing. But in order for the business overall to succeed, you have to fix the weak link.

[14:11] And it either means you need to learn how to do it or you need to define who already has that skill

[14:17] and can fix it within your business for you so that you're overall physique or overall business.

[14:22] itself is balanced. So I hope you found this valuable. Who found this interesting. I thought it was a

[14:25] great conversation. I was having a good friend of mine who's also really interested in fitness and

[14:29] we were talking about the similarities. And last one is that if you're a fitness professional

[14:34] and you are and you're not making money, it's not because you are so disciplined in fitness.

[14:41] You really get a fitness because you like fitness. And so the key is to figure out how to like

[14:44] business in order to be good at it. Because that's the only way you're going to do it for a long

[14:48] enough period of time and be consistent with it. Keeping awesome and the last thing, you know what?

[14:52] I'll add this last piece in last piece is that most people think in months when the people who

[14:59] win thinking years, if you want to have a champion physique, you want to look like you're absolutely

[15:03] ridiculously in shape. It doesn't take months. It takes years. If you want to have the business,

[15:08] this is my opinion that is what you want it to be. It's not going to take months. It takes years.

[15:13] And if you look up after six months or nine months or two years and you're like, I'm not where I want to be.

[15:18] First off, I'm not where I want to be either. So that's not going to change. But if you feel like

[15:23] you're not making the progress that's proportional, it's always a hockey stick. There's always the

[15:27] years of eating crap for a long period of time. And then everything starts taking off because you put

[15:32] all the pieces together. Unlike a physique because you have your body whether it's bad or not.

[15:38] In business, it works a lot like a pipeline. In that if you can get leads, but you can't sell,

[15:43] you don't have a business. If you can get leads and you can sell, but you can't fulfill,

[15:46] then it's very like you have to hit each one of the steps in the pipeline in order for the

[15:50] business to grow. And once all of the things are right, then you add more in the front and then the whole thing

[15:54] grows. And just like bodybuilding, once your whole body is balanced, now you add more volume and then the whole thing grows.

[16:00] Right. And so that's the thing that I'll wrap this up with. I hope you have an amazing day. I hope this

[16:04] was valuable. Hope this was interesting to you. At least stop provoking in terms of some of the beliefs around

[16:07] business that can help you shape your life. My name is Alex Shemozi. We own a portfolio company that

[16:12] is at your $85 million a year. And we're having to keep being awesome, catch you soon. Bye.

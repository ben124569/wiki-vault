[00:00] What's the theory behind starting a second comprises?

[00:03] So can I pick it up?

[00:04] Of course.

[00:05] How could I... How could I... How could I forget?

[00:07] Oh, yeah.

[00:15] I have started with calves for more than 10 years now.

[00:19] Straight.

[00:20] And the reason for that is because calves are my weakest body part.

[00:24] In terms of proportions.

[00:26] Isn't this nice?

[00:27] That's something... It's meant for two.

[00:29] It is kind of...

[00:29] It's body system.

[00:30] It is kind of cute.

[00:31] Yeah.

[00:32] That's great.

[00:32] So I actually train my body in reverse order of weakness.

[00:34] Like my reverse order of my worst body part to best body part.

[00:39] Okay.

[00:40] If you go ground up, legs wise, it's like...

[00:43] Your calves are nice and warm and then I do hamstrings next.

[00:46] Yep.

[00:47] And so our knee joints gonna be nice and long-to-toe.

[00:50] So that when I actually do a leg move, I feel pretty good.

[00:52] When I put them first and then I doubled the amount of volume,

[00:54] and I did them at every workout rather than like two times a week.

[00:58] That's when my calves started to really grow.

[01:00] I think that there's something definitely underrated

[01:04] about starting a session with a real low investment movement.

[01:08] Like no one's ever gonna say no to another set of carforases.

[01:11] Yeah, I really don't want to train today.

[01:13] Yeah.

[01:14] Well, start.

[01:14] I'm in the edge of this thing.

[01:16] You're actually converting me.

[01:18] You're actually converting me.

[01:20] I mean, like I've been doing this for 20 years.

[01:22] So like, I've done iterations.

[01:25] I've been doing this for 10.

[01:27] Like I haven't changed since it's like

[01:28] it's right.

[01:29] I've heard you say that you do just one body part each session

[01:33] and just consistently get volume in.

[01:35] Is that still the same?

[01:36] 100%.

[01:38] I don't think that many people have the same approach to training

[01:40] that Alex does.

[01:41] Not many people begin their workout with like 100 repetitions on calves

[01:47] and not many people do the exact same routine

[01:51] every single session full body.

[01:53] Have you ever had any temptation to do a different training modalities?

[01:58] A functional thing and presenting to you.

[02:00] Jitsuit thing, a crossfit thing.

[02:01] Nope, no design.

[02:03] None.

[02:04] I did my experimentation way earlier.

[02:07] I go down to my 20s.

[02:08] I was like, I'll try crossfit that I did all body weight for six months.

[02:12] I did only swimming.

[02:14] You know what I mean?

[02:16] I did only kettlebells.

[02:18] I did that for a year.

[02:19] I didn't know anything.

[02:20] So I started from absolute ignorance.

[02:22] And so I would read these sales letters for like kettlebells.

[02:25] And I'd be like, oh kettlebells are what I need to do.

[02:27] And then I read a new ebook about like how body weight training was like the new thing

[02:31] and then I would just do body weight stuff.

[02:32] And then I read about isometrics is actually where you can get the most strength

[02:35] and then I would do that.

[02:37] And so I did all sorts of programs and methodologies for a while before I kind of

[02:42] like actually learned the few things that matter.

[02:45] I wanted Max muscle.

[02:48] Least headache.

[02:50] I train full body every day.

[02:52] So like body composition wise fits the best.

[02:55] For me, I can do supersets so I don't have to do cardio.

[03:01] And you gain the most muscle.

[03:03] So like why would I want anything that's not the most muscle?

[03:06] Yep.

[03:07] And that works for me.

[03:09] Good.

[03:10] But hamstrings after this will feel great.

[03:11] Yeah.

[03:12] Because your calves always get involved in hamstrings.

[03:14] So it's like pre-fifthig the calves and then only be hamstrings.

[03:17] Yes.

[03:18] Pre-fifthig calves and hamstrings and only be, oh it's right.

[03:20] Yep.

[03:21] Very nice.

[03:23] Hamstrings.

[03:25] Chop.

[03:26] You're receded or lying?

[03:28] Well, do you see it?

[03:29] Chop.

[03:30] No, no, no.

[03:31] I would always, no.

[03:32] No, I was ever doing ceded hamstrings.

[03:35] I would always superset them with like extensions always because for me I'm like,

[03:40] why wouldn't I?

[03:41] Why wouldn't I?

[03:42] Why wouldn't you?

[03:43] Well, why wouldn't I?

[03:44] Because then I'll be out of breath.

[03:46] But I thought that the supersets, I thought supersets were cardio.

[03:49] I would.

[03:50] If I was trying in better today.

[03:51] Oh, that's not the idea.

[03:53] In between sets is, is, is camera time.

[03:56] And when camera's not here, it's rest time.

[03:58] Why lean forward?

[04:05] You'll see.

[04:08] So lock it down as much as hard as you can on your knees like extra.

[04:11] There you go.

[04:13] So lean forward and put your chest up.

[04:15] See the stretch?

[04:16] Now lean forward even more.

[04:18] Yeah.

[04:20] Stretch your, arch your chest more.

[04:22] So the stretch of your hamstring can catch you.

[04:24] There you go.

[04:26] It stretches the shit out of it like this.

[04:29] And then it also keeps attention the whole time on your hamstring.

[04:31] Yep.

[04:32] So you don't have any rest.

[04:33] Well, as if you're back here, you're now, yep.

[04:37] It's way of pumping your that way.

[04:38] But this may, this like got my hamstring so much better than leaning back.

[04:42] Yep.

[04:43] Big stretch, big, please.

[04:44] Big stretch, big, please.

[04:46] Oh.

[04:47] Multiple gym membership's been the same setting.

[04:50] So good because you get sick of training in one place.

[04:53] Are you in a different vibe?

[04:55] Kind of the same as the working thing at the desk.

[04:56] Two gym membership.

[04:57] Yep.

[04:59] So if I need to prep for a guest, I got a gold south central.

[05:02] Tonight's in quiet.

[05:04] No one ever hassles me.

[05:05] If you want to get session in with the boys, there's a spit and sod us to indoor outdoor

[05:08] thing, but that's really cool.

[05:10] And then if we want to do some functional classes on it, it's got a gym really good.

[05:16] Good man.

[05:23] Oh, Amy.

[05:25] Yeah, me.

[05:26] Do you really want to fuck with yourself?

[05:31] Point your toes forward.

[05:32] Now try it.

[05:33] Oh, that's awful.

[05:35] Oh, because it shows you how much your cap gets involved.

[05:40] Yeah.

[05:41] You flex your cap, can't you use it?

[05:43] Ha ha.

[05:44] Yeah.

[05:46] It's crazy how many variants that can be of one movement, where you think I'm totally

[05:49] fucking locked in.

[05:50] But then if I go here, I'll end if I go here.

[05:52] But then if I don't go here, totally different.

[05:54] Yeah, it's actually a cool mechanical drop set that way.

[05:57] So you start with your toes out.

[05:59] Yep.

[06:00] And then you basically go to my trunk.

[06:01] Yep.

[06:02] Yep.

[06:03] Yep.

[06:04] But I usually just go limp feet.

[06:06] So like not this way, which still helps you.

[06:09] Yep.

[06:10] This way, like, which takes it all out.

[06:11] I just go.

[06:12] Yeah.

[06:13] Newtroll.

[06:14] Thank you, David.

[06:15] I've always preferred training with a partner.

[06:17] I think, especially after a long time in the gym a decade and a bit, you end up just

[06:22] running out of juice.

[06:23] I just don't have all that much motivation.

[06:26] One of my own.

[06:27] I'll go in and I'll go through the motions.

[06:29] But if I'm going to push myself even remotely hard, I need someone else there.

[06:33] I also end up scrolling doom scrolling on your phone or getting distracted by emails or something.

[06:39] Yeah, boy.

[06:47] It's funny because people in the gym are going to think we're fitness influencers.

[06:50] Oh, no.

[06:51] Yeah.

[06:52] All of these videos have got nothing to do with fitness.

[06:55] In fact, the fitness is just a break from recording.

[06:58] Yeah.

[06:59] Shouldn't they be in better shape?

[07:02] Why are they bigger?

[07:04] I asked myself that every day.

[07:07] Why is he wearing a supplement company's a pair of?

[07:10] Well, let's see a acquiring.

[07:12] Yeah, what is he acquiring?

[07:14] This is the acquired any fucking muscle.

[07:17] Yeah, much.

[07:18] Why don't you acquire some games, bro?

[07:19] Yeah, it's like ideally you want to walk it like right above your kneecap.

[07:26] Yes.

[07:27] And then I stayed by the gym.

[07:29] Yeah.

[07:30] Yeah.

[07:31] Yeah.

[07:32] Yeah.

[07:33] Yeah.

[07:35] Yeah.

[07:36] Yeah.

[07:37] Yeah.

[07:38] Yeah.

[07:39] Yeah.

[07:40] Yeah.

[07:41] Yeah.

[07:42] Yeah.

[07:43] Yeah.

[07:44] Yeah.

[07:45] Yeah.

[07:46] Yeah.

[07:47] Yeah.

[07:48] Yeah.

[07:49] Yeah.

[07:50] Yeah.

[07:51] Yeah.

[07:52] Yeah.

[07:53] Yeah.

[07:54] Yeah.

[07:55] Yeah.

[07:56] Yeah.

[07:57] Yeah.

[07:58] Yeah.

[07:58] Yeah.

[07:59] It'll be between those two things.

[08:01] That's my promise.

[08:02] Ooh.

[08:03] You're trying to touch your hands, drink your butt now.

[08:07] There's a little bit of rain inside.

[08:10] Yeah.

[08:11] These little puffed up.

[08:12] Give me some time about this.

[08:14] So I'm trying to make coffee, I think.

[08:17] Yeah.

[08:18] Yeah.

[08:19] I'm all puffed up.

[08:20] Oh, my legs are all puffed right now.

[08:23] Yeah.

[08:24] Yeah.

[08:25] Yeah.

[08:26] Yeah.

[08:27] Yeah.

[08:28] Yeah.

[08:29] Yeah.

[08:30] Oh.

[08:31] How many best brands did you need to go through before you decided on the one that every acquisition.com thing is printed on?

[08:37] You mean this, uh, particular?

[08:39] Oh, the best?

[08:40] Yeah.

[08:41] Take that.

[08:42] Okay.

[08:43] Yeah.

[08:44] Yeah.

[08:45] Probably 30 or 40.

[08:46] Okay.

[08:47] Yeah.

[08:48] What were the most common problems that you encountered with other vests?

[08:50] If you get 10 mediums and they fit different, there's not consistency there.

[08:54] One.

[08:55] Two.

[08:56] They shrink differently.

[08:57] Where are my hand?

[08:58] Here.

[08:59] And then that out.

[09:00] Yeah.

[09:01] This turns out.

[09:02] And then it hits here.

[09:04] Different ones shrink at different sizes when you wash.

[09:07] Yep.

[09:08] Some of them were like two thin up top or two thick up top.

[09:11] Yep.

[09:12] Some of them would bunch so it kind of like float like this above.

[09:15] The actual softness of the shirt.

[09:18] Sometimes it's just like, it's just for paper.

[09:21] So it looks like softness.

[09:22] All too thick.

[09:23] Yeah.

[09:24] And then some of them don't stretch at all.

[09:25] So I need a little bit of elastic in it.

[09:27] So it shows all the good.

[09:28] It's all the bad.

[09:29] You know what I'm saying?

[09:31] Um, those are the big.

[09:33] I actually have a list on my phone for like all the things I was rating them on.

[09:37] But those are all the time I had.

[09:38] Got.

[09:39] Let's still not done my shoe test.

[09:41] How long like, shoe number, probably 50.

[09:44] And what is it that you, a lot?

[09:47] A lot of shoes are the toughest.

[09:49] By far.

[09:50] Do you think it has to be able to get me into a nice establishment.

[09:53] Yep.

[09:54] I have to be able to work out in it.

[09:55] Yep.

[09:56] It has to be able to get wet because I don't want to have like a different shoe when I'm traveling.

[09:59] It gets wet.

[10:00] Yeah.

[10:01] My feet can't sweat in it.

[10:02] And they can't smell over time.

[10:03] Yeah.

[10:04] That's hog.

[10:05] I think all this hogs.

[10:06] I don't worry.

[10:07] Yeah.

[10:08] That's difficult.

[10:09] I mean, that's a high-bought.

[10:11] Just that.

[10:12] Yep.

[10:13] And I've been working out with them like doing calf raises.

[10:15] They're like, I have to go to walking them with no like blisters anywhere.

[10:18] Yep.

[10:19] And I walk an hour a day.

[10:20] Are you puppy?

[10:21] Puffy.

[10:22] I'm very puppy.

[10:23] Okay.

[10:24] Would you be able to get into a nice establishment in those trainers do you think?

[10:28] Yeah.

[10:29] The only thing I've ever seen at the nicest places is no sandals.

[10:32] It's actually a rich guy's.

[10:34] We're normal.

[10:35] You heard of the red sneaker effect, right?

[10:37] What?

[10:38] It was a study done at a conference with businessmen.

[10:42] And they tried to quantify the objective metrics of how smart somebody dressed.

[10:47] And there was an inverse correlation between the smartness of dress and the network or the job title that this person had.

[10:56] There's the people who had dressed down the most that had the most wealth.

[11:00] Check out how to signalings a hell of a drug man.

[11:04] I mean usually I turn on rest as little as I can.

[11:12] Between sets.

[11:13] That's a strange thing about training with apartment.

[11:15] Even though you have to wait for someone else to finish that set.

[11:17] Yeah.

[11:18] You rest less.

[11:19] You rest less because you've got, uh, because you're not on your timer.

[11:22] Yeah.

[11:23] The timer is the other person's set.

[11:25] I'm about 50, 50 in terms of whether I turn with people or not.

[11:28] Uh, there are seasons where I like find somebody that like we have a times that work out for a season.

[11:34] And I work out with them.

[11:35] And then there's times when my schedule's kind of crazy and I get workouts when I can.

[11:40] I would say that I'm far prefer working out with other people whenever I can.

[11:44] Just because I train harder, I train longer, I do more sets.

[11:47] I probably do better form.

[11:49] Um, and I, and I, I just in general work out harder and longer when I have other people around me.

[11:53] Yeah.

[11:54] Yeah.

[11:55] Three is like a optimal say to one.

[11:56] Yeah.

[11:57] I would say that that's probably not far.

[11:58] And that's exactly what it is.

[11:59] It's two two parts rest for one part of the day.

[12:02] I would say there's two different types of training sessions.

[12:04] It's like a training session where you're like going in there to die and remove your own soul and look at it.

[12:08] Like deep into its own eyes and then put it back into yourself.

[12:11] Um, and then there's training sessions where it's like, I would say a more social training session.

[12:16] Uh, and to me that was like a more social training session.

[12:18] So I still got to work out in, but like I was in dying.

[12:21] If you want sneaky cardio 90 minutes it's pickable is a 1000 calories.

[12:27] It's fucking insane.

[12:28] And you don't even think you just like just chasing a ball.

[12:30] Yeah.

[12:31] You're not doing cardio, you're chasing a ball.

[12:33] A thousand calories on a concept to ski or roe or snow.

[12:37] It's a bit of a misery miserable.

[12:39] Yeah.

[12:40] Mind you, how?

[12:41] So that goes through what Trevor was talking about where the people who are who are the quote most disciplined aren't actually more disciplined.

[12:48] They figure out something to do in the meantime.

[12:51] So it's like, you did the same cardio as the guy in the skier.

[12:54] Yep.

[12:55] He gets off. He's like, who's so fucking disciplined.

[12:57] Yeah.

[12:58] And to you, it didn't feel like discipline.

[12:59] Yeah.

[13:00] I like the opposite.

[13:01] Right.

[13:02] So I think like there in lines are pretty big.

[13:04] Find you.

[13:05] Find your pickle ball.

[13:06] And then get puffy on it.

[13:07] I don't stop trying to make puffy a thing.

[13:10] Puffy's not going to be a thing.

[13:12] Oh, it's going to be huge.

[13:13] Big puff.

[13:14] Christian, I have a good dynamic.

[13:16] On the podcast and off the podcast, I think we, um,

[13:19] Very bro talk.

[13:21] So it, we keep it light, which is nice because, you know,

[13:24] life can be really serious all the time.

[13:26] And it's, it's ironic because he is a podcast on like wisdom and deep,

[13:30] philosophical things.

[13:32] And it'd be really easy to take yourself seriously.

[13:35] And he's going to be really easy to take yourself out that he doesn't,

[13:38] and, uh, and he can talk shit with me.

[13:42] We're sitting, well, we'll do one more just in case.

[13:46] You know the rule.

[13:48] If you have to ask, if you have another set last, you got to do another set.

[13:55] Why?

[13:56] It's a little bit more earless.

[13:58] You want me to do that?

[13:59] Yeah, because the machine is makes cool up.

[14:01] Yeah.

[14:02] If you repeat, there are some more 12 and up.

[14:04] You have to put some more up.

[14:05] So like, you go more and wide, just like this and more wide.

[14:08] You're going to be more of both to kill all of those parts.

[14:10] That doctor.

[14:11] He's made four.

[14:12] All right.

[14:13] That's what we're doing.

[14:14] Have a little more high.

[14:16] And you'll be more like two more.

[14:18] Or maybe this one, the corner.

[14:20] Yeah.

[14:21] All right.

[14:22] Here.

[14:23] Yeah.

[14:24] Oh.

[14:25] All right, doctor.

[14:26] All right.

[14:27] Let's put in this.

[14:28] Yeah.

[14:29] Oh.

[14:30] Yeah.

[14:31] How do you see it, more water?

[14:40] Yeah.

[14:42] Yep.

[14:43] Yeah.

[14:44] Yeah.

[14:45] Yep.

[14:46] Yeah.

[14:47] Yeah.

[14:48] Yeah.

[14:49] Yep.

[14:50] Oh.

[14:51] Yeah.

[14:52] Yeah.

[14:53] Hey.

[14:54] Hey.

[14:55] Oh, you got it.

[14:56] What's in the pros, baby?

[14:58] The greatest hack of all time, whether it's body building or business is getting with people

[15:02] who are far ahead of you.

[15:04] I mean, almost all of the periods of my life where I had huge changes or improvements in my physique,

[15:09] was when I had people who were better than me giving me insight.

[15:14] Because the thing is, it's like, you can learn a certain amount.

[15:16] But like, if someone has a decade of experience on something and then they can just immediately

[15:20] spot, like, even if you're a video editor, someone's like, oh, dude, you missed this.

[15:23] You know, like, they have more context to give you advice.

[15:27] And it's in vibe, which is why I've tried to buy any experience I can from anybody who's willing to sell it to me.

[15:33] I'd rather get the lesson without the scar.

[15:35] Oh, shoulders.

[15:37] Yeah.

[15:38] There are nights seated.

[15:40] Yes.

[15:41] Oh, yeah.

[15:43] The post-quad stretch for Max Pope.

[15:47] Roodle.

[15:49] Like, what's the key is here, any?

[15:54] Oh, so do this.

[15:56] Every start.

[15:57] Push your shoulders.

[15:58] Like, forward.

[15:59] Got back.

[16:00] Forward.

[16:01] So why do you want to have them sit?

[16:02] As far out as you can.

[16:03] Yep.

[16:04] Got you.

[16:05] Nice.

[16:10] Let's be able to score our media and weird else.

[16:13] So I pretty much just be exclusive to our media and we're even trying to print.

[16:17] Not my deficiency.

[16:19] Not my constraint.

[16:21] Not my problem.

[16:24] Oh, my goodness.

[16:25] Oh, my goodness.

[16:27] Come on.

[16:28] Yep.

[16:29] So, would like to enter into your shoe rotation.

[16:32] Vans old school comfy cush.

[16:34] But I think they fail on smell.

[16:36] Yeah.

[16:37] And I think that they fail on getting wet.

[16:39] So it depends on how wet they are.

[16:41] So it depends on how wet they are.

[16:43] So it depends on how wet they are.

[16:45] So it depends on how wet they are.

[16:47] So it depends on how wet they are.

[16:49] So it depends on how wet they are.

[16:51] So it depends on how wet wet from below fine wet from above.

[16:54] No good.

[16:55] So they have a new one that came out that has cork bottom.

[16:58] And it's mesh on top.

[17:00] So it's mesh like this.

[17:01] Oh, I've seen them that cold like the move.

[17:03] I was wearing them today underneath the table.

[17:05] I didn't.

[17:06] No, I didn't notice.

[17:07] Good.

[17:08] So far they haven't failed any task but these are better to work out.

[17:12] Got you.

[17:13] Slip on slip off.

[17:14] If you've got a shoe on shoe on.

[17:16] Yeah.

[17:17] You read billed on shoe on.

[17:18] Yeah.

[17:19] Come on.

[17:20] You have to fight to put your shoes on.

[17:21] These are stretchy.

[17:22] But what about the advance?

[17:24] That was the downside for them.

[17:26] I wasn't a shoe hon.

[17:27] And you bypassed that.

[17:28] That's expanded your choice.

[17:29] It has landscape.

[17:30] Yeah.

[17:31] Like having a shoe hon.

[17:32] I usually only do slip on slip off.

[17:33] How much do you value the skin on the back of your thumb?

[17:36] Probably quite highly.

[17:37] I would imagine.

[17:38] Yeah.

[17:39] Or you're the highest skin.

[17:40] Most valuables skin.

[17:41] Really?

[17:42] Oh yeah.

[17:43] Really think about that.

[17:44] A lot of people in America are circumcised.

[17:45] I forget.

[17:46] Yeah.

[17:48] I'm probably the only person in this building with a false skin.

[17:50] That's craggle's way.

[17:51] We'll cut that one from the real.

[17:53] Just like he got.

[17:54] Cute.

[17:55] Did it there.

[17:57] Ah.

[17:58] Question for you.

[17:59] Yes.

[18:00] Who's your favorite person interview?

[18:01] Who's your favorite interviewer?

[18:03] Who's your favorite person interviewer?

[18:04] Who's your favorite interviewer?

[18:05] Interviewers?

[18:06] Interviewers?

[18:07] You guys.

[18:08] You guys.

[18:09] So good.

[18:10] It's all about.

[18:11] People from the outside will see someone that's got a very successful platform.

[18:16] Right.

[18:17] But his use of cadence and silence in a carolation is unbelievable.

[18:23] I thought I'd work very hard at this.

[18:25] Been 600 episodes.

[18:26] I get to sit down with this guy and it's like being a black belt and go, I know I get to roll with the seventh dan.

[18:32] That's the how good he actually is.

[18:33] Yeah.

[18:34] And you'd like what the fuck was that?

[18:36] Very, very, very impressive.

[18:37] Like super impressive interviewer.

[18:39] So in terms of people to interview one person that I love consistently is Rory Sutherland.

[18:43] Okay.

[18:44] So fun.

[18:45] Super easy.

[18:46] Very knowledgeable.

[18:47] Very knowledgeable.

[18:49] Something about seeing guy double fisting vape throughout the entire episode.

[18:55] One of which is on a rope around his neck.

[18:57] So it'll have one on a rope around his neck.

[18:59] So it's never more than a foot and a half from his mouth at any one time.

[19:03] And a silver legendary.

[19:06] How does this feel shorter, was?

[19:08] Good.

[19:09] Yeah, that's good.

[19:10] It's a quite a weak angle.

[19:13] You know, if you were here, you'd be a way way way stronger.

[19:16] But it feels like it's for that.

[19:18] And given that you've done 3,500 hours of writing, what are the main principles that you rely on to remove friction from the writing process?

[19:32] What do the water dust set up?

[19:35] Time away.

[19:36] Yeah.

[19:37] Like, well, not everything.

[19:38] And in terms of like, I think we're the accurate writing today.

[19:40] Got it.

[19:42] Um, I mean, I have pretty much just write the same time every day, which is when I wake up.

[19:46] And then I write, tilting in.

[19:48] And that's basically the only thing.

[19:51] I don't do anything else.

[19:53] But you're using, I saw you use nicotine today during the podcast.

[19:56] I do that all the time though.

[19:58] That's not a good opportunity.

[20:00] Very good.

[20:01] It's task independent.

[20:02] Yeah.

[20:03] So I guess the lesson from that.

[20:05] Because nicotine a global reward.

[20:07] What's that?

[20:08] It's a global reward.

[20:09] You can use it to reward anything.

[20:11] Something tells me that you and Rory are aligned on this.

[20:13] Ugh.

[20:14] Come on.

[20:16] Oh, a cheeky little drop set.

[20:19] Go on then.

[20:20] Yeah.

[20:21] She get a little drop set.

[20:22] Oh, there it is.

[20:23] Hmm.

[20:25] Hmm.

[20:26] Hmm.

[20:27] Ah.

[20:28] Get lost.

[20:29] Ooh.

[20:30] So the rule is sit down and write.

[20:34] That's a rule.

[20:35] It's not even a rule.

[20:36] That's just like when I do it.

[20:37] That's your strategy.

[20:38] That's what Rory is sit down and write.

[20:40] I'll say this.

[20:41] My strategy is do the thing that's most important first.

[20:44] Okay.

[20:45] And for now it's writing and then it'll be something else later.

[20:47] Yep.

[20:48] So that's my, I would say the macro calendars, the bigger thing.

[20:51] I don't take meetings until noon or one.

[20:53] And then that first slot gets something that's not what ever the priority is.

[20:58] Oh.

[20:59] Understood.

[21:00] Do you take a break during writing during that six hour block?

[21:02] To have like a shake.

[21:03] Yep.

[21:04] After time I do it while I'm writing,

[21:06] I think I'll break up any of it.

[21:07] Yep.

[21:08] Okay.

[21:09] But not long.

[21:10] 15 minutes.

[21:11] Interesting.

[21:12] Was it more difficult before you were in the editing phase?

[21:14] In that there's a maximum number of ideas per minute that you can put out on to paper.

[21:18] So you have to kind of sit and think like what am I actually trying to do?

[21:22] I'll say he says more fees.

[21:24] So it's more like figuring out what I'm going to say first.

[21:27] That's what took the longest.

[21:28] Then was writing it.

[21:29] We took which was the easiest.

[21:31] Yep.

[21:32] And then basically taking.

[21:35] What I wrote cutting out half of it.

[21:39] Feeling in the other half cutting half of it again.

[21:42] Feeling in the next half cut it.

[21:44] Just basically just continue to just compact compact compact compact.

[21:49] The book's probably 270 pages.

[21:51] But it got compressed from a thousand posts.

[21:53] Yep.

[21:54] And just like the rule is always like if we read two sentences.

[21:57] And if we only read one of them.

[21:59] It's still at the same thing.

[22:00] One of them is not required.

[22:01] And we just do that over and over and over and over.

[22:03] Yep.

[22:04] So that my hope is that the whole book is literally.

[22:07] Tweet after tweet after tweet for three hundred pages.

[22:10] You had the album and I couldn't have all the revocants.

[22:12] Yeah.

[22:13] Yeah.

[22:14] It's like like that.

[22:15] Very dense.

[22:16] Yeah.

[22:17] Signal noise.

[22:18] This one's going to be a bear because it's basically like eight books in one,

[22:20] which sounds ridiculous to say.

[22:22] But like.

[22:23] It's just how to do warm outreach, cold outreach.

[22:25] Post content run ads, higher agencies, higher high recruit,

[22:30] training trained manager employees, build affiliate programs, build referral systems.

[22:37] In one book.

[22:39] And so like each one of those 25 to 30 pages was probably like 150 paid rather than book.

[22:46] Yes.

[22:47] They just got squeezed until there was nothing left to be cut.

[22:50] And it's like if you read this, you will not have to set up a fillet.

[22:52] If you read this, you know how to set up a referral system.

[22:54] If you read this, you know how to get your first five points more read ads.

[22:56] If you read this, you know how to post content to get customers.

[22:58] So was there anything that you had to write that you didn't know?

[23:01] Yeah.

[23:02] Oh, time.

[23:03] I have like my best ideas of this.

[23:05] It's usually I start with anecdote of like this is what we did.

[23:08] This is what worked well.

[23:10] And then that's what Trevor and I will beat up until we're like,

[23:12] what are the principles behind a good referral system and then one doesn't?

[23:15] And then we'll try and break and be like, all right, it was the one that worked.

[23:17] It didn't have those things.

[23:18] And we just that process is what takes the longest.

[23:21] Yep.

[23:22] Because we wanted to be valid.

[23:23] Yep.

[23:24] And that's the hard part.

[23:25] Yes.

[23:26] Every marketer has their system in their head and they write it down and they send it.

[23:29] But you're going to immediately break it, which is why it's not valid,

[23:31] which is why it doesn't get shared, why doesn't it become canon.

[23:34] So the goal is like if I can make something that no one can disprove,

[23:37] then it can become canon and people can use it.

[23:39] So first one was offers.

[23:41] Yep.

[23:42] Second one's leads.

[23:43] Leads.

[23:44] Third one is.

[23:45] Full of fun is.

[23:47] I have a couple ideas, but for now.

[23:49] I'm going to explore.

[23:50] Cool.

[23:51] Don't be more.

[23:52] Yep.

[23:53] All right.

[23:54] Blast that.

[23:55] Yeah.

[23:56] All right.

[23:57] We'll do a double drop.

[23:59] Okay.

[24:00] So go 10, 10, 10.

[24:02] Cool.

[24:03] Yeah.

[24:04] I think that was what I was trying to get out today with that bridge between the philosophy and the

[24:09] applicability.

[24:10] Yeah.

[24:11] And that because in the world of business, a great philosophy that doesn't make money.

[24:16] Doesn't matter.

[24:17] Yeah.

[24:18] The validity of the model is how much money you make.

[24:20] Correct.

[24:21] Which means that a beautifully sounding theory that isn't effective in the real world,

[24:25] is pointless.

[24:26] So everything that you're talking about is being stressed out.

[24:30] Yeah.

[24:31] But we just start with what worked.

[24:35] And then we try and figure out what makes it work always.

[24:39] Yeah.

[24:40] So it's like affiliates were like, how much do we pay them on what cadence and do we have tears?

[24:49] And what do they have to do to earn the tears?

[24:52] Yep.

[24:53] So we're going to activate them.

[24:54] How do we get them to keep marketing?

[24:56] Yeah.

[24:57] So this is just, by the way, all the fitness people.

[25:07] But I try and do as many perfect reps as I can.

[25:11] And then I try and do as many imperfect reps as I can.

[25:15] If you were like, isn't that going to only strengthen a certain range?

[25:21] How I see it is.

[25:22] I feat you all the stuff that I can at match range.

[25:25] And then I keep going until I feat the stuff that can do partial range.

[25:28] So just for me, it kills it more.

[25:30] And I get more volume and percent.

[25:32] I'm definitely not an expert.

[25:34] But for me, once I'm here, this is an immidal as I feel it.

[25:38] Everything above that for me is trapped.

[25:40] And I get these crazy pains of my next five.

[25:42] And I stop times I feel a shooting pain.

[25:45] But for me, I can just do this and know that that's the end of my doubt.

[25:48] And that's the range I train.

[25:52] But when you're people to see that, and they're probably right and smarter.

[25:59] I think this was like when I was training classes at Huntington Beach, this was a hot song.

[26:05] So I heard it like 40 times a day.

[26:08] I'm sure when you were clubbing, there's just songs like umbrella.

[26:11] All right, all right.

[26:13] I listen mostly to either like British rap or metal, neither of which get played in nightclubs or that much.

[26:21] I knew the words to every single song that was in the top 40 for a decade and a half.

[26:26] What kind of metal?

[26:28] Also, it's dude.

[26:29] Bring me the horizon.

[26:30] What about Sard?

[26:31] Sleak.

[26:32] For a dad metal.

[26:33] What?

[26:34] Hard or dad metal.

[26:35] Dad metal?

[26:36] No, not dad metal.

[26:37] Give me a break.

[26:38] So have I been says one arm?

[26:40] Yeah.

[26:41] One arm.

[26:42] I'm trying to lean my hip out so you get a bigger stretch.

[26:45] You'll see.

[26:46] You on unda?

[26:47] Yeah, I'm under.

[26:48] Unda?

[26:49] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[26:50] And then just wedge yourself.

[26:56] You didn't ask me earlier about, do I remember this name of the song that was playing?

[27:00] I don't know the name of any song.

[27:02] Like lyrics for sure.

[27:05] It's kind of a crazy claim.

[27:07] I don't know the name of any song.

[27:08] Let's say this way.

[27:09] Like me recognizing a song by name is very hard for me.

[27:14] And I listen that for.

[27:15] What do you think that says about you?

[27:17] I very about audio memory.

[27:19] My wife will attach to that.

[27:22] But then be great.

[27:23] If you have absolutely great audio memory and forgetting all of these song names is just one long word.

[27:29] You troll one round.

[27:31] Yeah, yeah.

[27:32] I really bought in.

[27:33] Keep same forgets the name of Rihanna.

[27:35] The only song that I know the full ears to was one that I had to write out in seventh grade.

[27:41] So they're trying to teach poetry.

[27:43] And they're basically saying, look, songs are poems like you know whatever.

[27:46] And so I remember the Eve 6 song that I wrote down.

[27:51] And that was it.

[27:52] There's like you have to find similarities and metaphors like in the thing.

[27:56] Wow.

[27:57] That's it.

[27:58] They're the only one I know the lyrics to.

[27:59] Because I could read it.

[28:00] Funny.

[28:01] What?

[28:02] I actually think that this bag is a very good physical representation of your life philosophy.

[28:31] So I think it's incredibly transactional.

[28:35] It's like just does the thing.

[28:38] Even if it's not what it was designed for, actually doesn't better than something else might do it.

[28:42] Again, just stinks of homozy, doesn't it?

[28:46] Absolutely wreaks of homozy.

[28:50] Zero aesthetics.

[28:53] Very functional.

[28:56] Odd.

[28:57] It completely disregards convention.

[29:00] How many things did you go through before you tried this?

[29:04] Oh, quite a.

[29:05] Yeah.

[29:06] Different types of bags.

[29:08] Different types of bags.

[29:09] Yeah.

[29:10] Rolly bag.

[29:11] And you settled on a workman's bag.

[29:13] Also, last forever.

[29:15] But it still had a bunch of issues with it.

[29:17] So I ended up modifying a bunch to the bag like cutting things off and like moving stuff around.

[29:22] But what I have now is the best, you know, gym bag that I know of and it kills.

[29:28] Yeah.

[29:29] Mid back.

[29:30] My smokes at it.

[29:32] Oh.

[29:35] Other things that I've had to learn since I've been in America.

[29:38] Biscuit?

[29:39] Uh-huh.

[29:40] Isn't a biscuit?

[29:41] No, not a thing.

[29:42] Biscuits of cookie.

[29:43] For dogs.

[29:44] Biscuit is like a scone that goes on the side of beef.

[29:47] Yeah.

[29:48] A crack of our all.

[29:49] Yeah.

[29:50] Pizzabred.

[29:51] Yeah.

[29:52] Biscuit.

[29:53] Chips.

[29:54] Or is it dog biscuit?

[29:55] Chips.

[29:56] It's a treat for a dog.

[29:58] Chips.

[29:59] Yeah.

[30:00] Me.

[30:01] Like thick french fries.

[30:02] Yeah.

[30:03] And then not.

[30:05] Very difficult.

[30:06] Simulating into this new culture is being incredibly difficult for me.

[30:09] And I spent fourth of July here, which was emotionally quite a tough day.

[30:12] Yeah.

[30:13] Anyone comment?

[30:15] Uh, I wore a t-shirt that said,

[30:17] Happy treason day and grateful colonists.

[30:20] Yeah.

[30:22] Was it?

[30:23] And then we were like,

[30:24] Winner's right history.

[30:26] Did you see any back-to-back World War Champs?

[30:29] Ha ha ha Ha ha ha ha ha

[30:59] ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

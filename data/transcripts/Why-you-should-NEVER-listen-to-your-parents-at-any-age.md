[00:00] In this video, I'm going to talk to you about why you never should listen to your parents at any age.

[00:04] Hi, my name is Alcimosi.

[00:06] I own a portfolio company that is $85 million a year in revenue.

[00:09] I make this channel because a lot of people are broken.

[00:10] I don't want to be one of them.

[00:11] And so one of the things that happens, and this is at any age.

[00:14] I know guys who are making millions of millions of dollars a year can still, you know,

[00:17] or insecure about what their parents tell them about XYZ.

[00:20] And so the reason I think this is interesting is that most people, unless your parents are

[00:24] exorbitantly wealthy and have achieved everything that you wish to achieve, I don't think

[00:27] you're listening to parents.

[00:28] And so one of my first rules of life is never listening to someone who's poor than you.

[00:31] Or poor than you want to be.

[00:33] All right, so that's two different, you know, cave-outs that because you might be younger and

[00:35] it's like, okay, well yeah, my parents have more money than me, but like, are they poor than you

[00:38] want to be?

[00:39] If so, then only listen to people who are wealthy or than you want to be, right?

[00:42] And the thing is is that they always will, and other people too, right?

[00:47] We'll always side on the side of being less risky, right?

[00:51] And here's why.

[00:52] Because when you naysay, right?

[00:54] It's like kind of like when you're, um, if someone's like, oh, I don't like your girlfriend.

[00:58] And the thing is is that if you date in general, right, and dating can

[01:02] can apply it like the concept of dating and apply to business concepts, it's really matter.

[01:05] But if you date, then fundamentally, every single person that you date, except for the one that you

[01:09] marry, is going to be someone who you're not going to be with.

[01:12] And if someone says, I don't think this person's good, I don't think this person's good,

[01:15] then they will be right, literally 99% of the time, except for the one time that matters, right?

[01:20] Kind of interesting.

[01:21] And so the thing is is most businesses fail, 95% of businesses fail within five years, right?

[01:26] And so most times they are correct.

[01:28] And so it's very easy for them to self reinforce that they are so smart, right?

[01:32] And they're always right, and they can tell you I told you so, right?

[01:35] But the reality is that they are wrong in the 1% of times that it matters, right, in your life.

[01:41] And so when I think about this, what's interesting is that like, the only way that is guaranteed

[01:46] to not get to success is to never take the risk to begin with, right?

[01:49] That's the guaranteed way of not achieving it.

[01:50] And I remember when I was quitting my job, that was the biggest conclusion that I came to.

[01:54] It was that I was not happy at my current earning level, and that the only job, because there was one position, one job that made enough money that I wanted,

[02:02] which was being an investment banker.

[02:03] So the best investment banker was going to make $10, $20 million a year.

[02:06] But I knew what it was required to get there in the amount of effort time and sacrifice.

[02:09] And I was like, the only people who will pay me that amount of money will be making so much more money off of me,

[02:15] and literally draining my life, that I don't think it's because like, usually if you become an investment banker,

[02:20] it's successful. You pretty much donate 20 years of your life in order to do that.

[02:24] And you're really never going to see your family and all that kind of stuff.

[02:27] And for me, that was not a trade-off I wanted to make.

[02:29] And so I figured there was no job that was going to pay me what I wanted to make, and a four-minute life-stall that I wanted.

[02:34] And so the path that I was on was guaranteed to not get me to where I wanted to go.

[02:41] And so even though it was micro-riskey, it was macro the only way I could do it, right?

[02:47] And so that's one of those things actually, from Gary Vee, they say,

[02:50] is micro-speed macro-patients, right? Money loves speed, while flow is time.

[02:54] And so if we're trying to build a wild, trying to build an asset, right, then we need to have time.

[02:58] What I'm either favored saying is that I'll share with you is, um, um, you get paid for what you do,

[03:04] you get returns on what you own, right? And so anyways, back to the reason why you shouldn't

[03:08] listen to other people is that they don't have an accurate understanding of risk, right?

[03:12] And the biggest risk is not doing anything at all. The biggest risk is never dating.

[03:16] Not that you're with this person, right? And so Warren Buffett said, and I like this, he said,

[03:21] most people only need to make four or five really good decisions in their life.

[03:24] So think about that for a second, because I think about, like, that one really shook me,

[03:27] because I think about all the decisions that I make every single day, right? And all the decisions

[03:30] that I've made in my life. And there's really not that many of them that have been the biggest

[03:35] levers, but the few that have been have been massive and enormous levers in my life.

[03:39] And most people don't take enough time to think about those decisions that are the massive

[03:42] force in the road. And am I going to keep going in this position? Do I want to live in this city?

[03:46] Am I going to marry this girl? Who am I going to go to, uh, who am I going to get into business with?

[03:50] Uh, what are we going to do, right? What are we actually going to do in this business? And so people don't

[03:54] give put enough thought into that stuff and spend all their time thinking about what next show they're

[03:57] going to watch on Netflix, right? Rather than thinking like, I'm going to take some time with this

[04:01] decision, because one of my other things is mistakes love a rushed decision, right? So micro-speed

[04:07] macro patients. If you're looking at long playing long, then you have to understand, or at least

[04:11] this is my, you know, my two cents on it, is that most people will oppose you at all times. And that is

[04:15] because it is safer for them to do so, because they will be right most of the times. But on the

[04:19] one percent of times that they are wrong, if that one percent decision, saying that you're going to

[04:24] buy seize candies for $25 million and ends of generating a billion dollars, right? In revenue,

[04:28] it's that one decision that they're going to miss out on. And that's the one decision that matters.

[04:32] And so they are 99 percent of the time right, but they're 100 percent wrong, right? And so that's

[04:37] the only message that I wanted to really drive home is that if you have parents who make less money,

[04:42] then you want to make, if you have friends who make less money, then you want to make. I had so many

[04:46] people who told me that everything I was doing was stupid. I was giving up a really good consulting job

[04:50] to open a gym, right? I took all my savings and sunk into a business. And you know what?

[04:54] That business wasn't the one that set me free. It was four or five businesses from there. But I learned

[04:58] the skills that, one by one, I was able to assemble and assemble on a belief standpoint of the

[05:03] world with the character traits to reinforce them to eventually yield the success that some people

[05:07] think is, you know, cool. So anyways, I made this video because I've had a lot of younger people

[05:12] who reached out to me recently about this particular issue. And it's just understanding MacroRise

[05:16] versus MacroRise. MacroRise, yes, you will fail, but failure is part of the game, right? But the

[05:21] MacroRise is that you'll never actually succeed. And that's the real game, right? And so you have to

[05:26] understand that you have to date in order to find the girl you're going to marry. You have to go

[05:29] on a lot of bad dates. You have to have a lot of small businesses that don't work, right? You don't

[05:33] have to. But it's common. And I don't know any entrepreneur who hasn't had a lot of businesses

[05:37] who eventually yield a success, right? Or even a lot of businesses within their main business. They

[05:40] pivoted a lot of times until they figured out what they were good at with the market needed.

[05:44] Oh, that makes sense to you. Hope I'm value this. I'm rooting for you. I'm your biggest fan.

[05:48] Keeping awesome, key-taking risks, micro speed, macro patience. And you get paid for what you do.

[05:54] You get returns on what you own. And what we're trying to build here is an asset that can

[05:58] pass over time because if we cannot, learn how to build that asset we will work until the day we

[06:02] die. So, keeping awesome wants to love and I'll catch you guys in the next video, hit

[06:09] to do it. All right. Bye.

[00:00] If you're stuck in your business right now, a lot of times you don't need to do it about

[00:04] to show you. But if you've reached a point and you were focused on a niche, right? And you're

[00:08] getting to the one million or three million or ten million dollar mark, there may be a time

[00:13] when it might be time for you to increase the size of your total adjustable market, which the

[00:18] short hand for that is 10. So in the investment banking world or the finance world, they call the

[00:22] 10, the total digital market. And that's one of the first questions that are going to ask you

[00:26] about your company if you wanted to sell some day. They're like, well, okay, you've grown,

[00:30] well, how big is the market that we're going after? Because if you're going after a tiny market,

[00:33] they realize that there's an invisible cap on the business that they, you know, they're going to say,

[00:38] okay, well, this doesn't, this isn't a massive opportunity. And so when you increase your

[00:42] time, you literally increase the size of your opportunity. But instead of doing, you also change the

[00:46] nature of your delivery and your prospect. So it's something you should do with a great amount of care.

[00:50] That being said, what I want to do is take you through the three ways to increase your total

[00:54] adjustable market and some of the considerations around that. All right. So the first way that you

[00:59] can increase your time, and this is one that a lot of people don't look at are more afraid of.

[01:03] And this is probably one of the most profitable ways to do it. At the end, I'll show you the,

[01:07] the ones that we've done and what I would have done differently, etc. All right. So the first way

[01:12] is to go up market. When the term up market, what that means is, is that if you're in a service

[01:17] business of some kind and you serve a specific avatar. So let's say I helped, you know, salon owners,

[01:22] generally customers, whatever, right. If I wanted to go up market, then I would say, okay, this is

[01:27] think about like a Christmas tree. Each one of these individual, like units has people below it and

[01:32] people above it. Above it would be the organizations or conglomerates of these people that I currently have.

[01:38] So can I go after associations? Can I go after franchises? Can I go after licenses or licensed

[01:44] doors of this type of business model? By doing that and serving those people, I now have changed the

[01:50] nature of my business. So if I'm serving somebody who serves salons, then I go up market. I get

[01:56] another degree of leverage. This typically happens when you have more experience in the field.

[02:01] You have demonstrated results. You have evidence of your efficacy or your systems or your

[02:06] process or whatever it is to add value. This is one of the best ways to gain leverage and instantly

[02:11] sell hundreds of clients at a time. All right. So that is the first way to increase your tam and also

[02:18] increase the quality and size of the contract that you're dealing with when you're selling. The second way

[02:25] to increase your tam is to go adjacent. All right. A adjacent would be if I'm a salonone or I'll just

[02:32] use that one as the or if I'm serving salonons or excuse me. If I wanted to go adjacent, there's a

[02:37] couple different ways I could do this. One is I could go for people who manufacture stuff for salonoters.

[02:44] Right? I might go after a pair of drying companies or a chair companies that do the little

[02:48] chairs that they have there or it might be the physical product side of the salon business.

[02:53] It could also be a business that's closely related to salons. So I might go after nail salon.

[02:59] Right? Or I could might go after a lash expert or whatever. Right? And so this is how I could go

[03:06] adjacent and do the same thing. Right? So I give you two different examples. Their one is

[03:11] changing the nature of the business. So if I started selling physical products within that same

[03:15] sphere, that would increase the size of my tam, but I also go directly to consumer. So there's

[03:18] multiple levels of that. The most direct adjacent jump would be going from helping salon owners

[03:24] to helping nail salons. Like so I hairstylawn to a nail salon to a lash salon or whatever.

[03:31] Right? So it's carving out these little vertical stripes that are close enough to one another

[03:36] that a lot of the best practices that you've already learned probably apply. All right? And so

[03:40] this is the second way that you can increase the total addressable market that you are serving.

[03:46] And by doing that, if you can triple the amount of customers that you can market to, then you can

[03:49] triple them people that you can sell. And this is especially important when you reach a bottleneck.

[03:55] Now, it's important to understand that you might have a bottleneck on your current channel.

[03:59] So let's say you're running Facebook guys to get these customers or you're running

[04:01] you know Google search ads, you're running or you have a great affiliate partner. Whatever it is,

[04:05] whatever way you're getting customers, you might have an artificial bottleneck. So you feel

[04:08] or you perceive like you can't grow any more within that space. But you realize that this is

[04:12] a $60 billion space in health and beauty and you're doing $4 million a year. Well, you probably

[04:17] should keep everything you have the same and add a different channel to it or increase how much

[04:21] you're making per customer, which is beyond the scope of this video. But just something to think

[04:24] about as you're going through this. All right? The third way that you can do this is to go down market.

[04:30] All right? This one I have personally tried and hated it. But I'll explain some of my personal

[04:37] experience with these things in a second. All right? So going down market is let's see

[04:41] use the salon owner example again. If I were going down market, then I would be serving

[04:46] hairstylists, right? So what's one level below the person that I'm currently serving? It would be

[04:51] hairstylists or actual nail polish people, right? And you absolutely can't do that. So if I had a

[04:56] certification or something that would help them, you know, be better or service more customers or

[05:02] allow them to charge higher rates because we had a proprietary system around it or whatever,

[05:07] then this would be something that I would be able to sell down market. Now, typically what happens

[05:12] if you're thinking about this from a pricing perspective. This is what you're normally charging.

[05:17] This is probably what you're charging times five to ten, all right? And this is what you're

[05:21] charging probably divided by five to ten, all right? And if you think about this, this is much more

[05:28] akin to a pyramid, right? Where you have where you're currently at, you have your down market,

[05:32] oops, and then you have your on market, right? On the top of that. And so making the decision about

[05:37] what to do here, I would say that most people are in this kind of number two bucket, right? They're

[05:41] where you are where you're at, you serve, and most times what you're encountering is an artificial

[05:47] bottleneck. You just have maxed out this particular stream of getting customers and there's

[05:51] lots of ways to solve that bottleneck. One is by adding another channel. The other way would be

[05:55] increasing the lifetime growth profit per customer, so that you can market twice as hard or

[05:59] spend twice as much or three times as much on that same channel to acquire more customers, right?

[06:03] And so one of those is back in solution, others a front-end solution, both of them are viable,

[06:07] it depends on where you're at, all right? And so me personally, I'll give you the the Jim example.

[06:12] So we serve Jim owners, and one of our portfolio companies, Jim launch. If we wanted to go down market,

[06:17] it would be helping personal trainers. If we want to go up market, it would be helping franchise

[06:22] stores, you know, make them one money with their franchise within that space, right? So that would be an

[06:26] example of all three of those things. If I wanted to go adjacent, it might be kind of like,

[06:32] I would say cross diagonal both adjacent and down market, but having the potential to go up market would

[06:36] be like having online fitness business, because some online fitness businesses can be bigger,

[06:41] some can be about the same as the Jim, and many, many, many of them are less than that,

[06:45] because most of those people are kind of more along lines of business opportunity seekers.

[06:49] Which leads me to kind of the fourth final point that I want to make here. If you are in some

[06:52] way involved with client acquisition, which many of the people who listen to this channel are,

[06:56] because there's just the nature of the world that I've been in, if you're in that world,

[07:01] one of the ways that you can make your opportunity appeal to more people is by transitioning from

[07:08] an improvement offer, which is where you help people do better when the thing that they are doing,

[07:12] to a new opportunity being a business opportunity. So it's helping people who do not have

[07:16] or who do not enjoy the job they're in or do not enjoy their current vehicle, and want to

[07:20] try something else as different. If you have a better way of doing it, that doesn't have a huge

[07:24] barrier to entry, then that can be a viable option, 3.5 is a bizzap. With each of these levels,

[07:32] as you go down this way, so too does the quality of the prospect. When you are selling somebody who's

[07:39] a hairstylist or a personal trainer or a real estate agent versus a real estate brokerage or

[07:47] a gym owner or a hailstallon owner versus a licensed a franchise store of any of those things,

[07:54] or a broker, if I was in the real estate space, hopefully you're seeing the parallels here,

[07:58] like all industries work this way, and the ultimate FU position to have, and this is what, you know,

[08:04] the banking world and what creates real, real tremendous enterprise value is something called

[08:10] vertical integration. Vertical integration. And what that means is actually owning all aspects

[08:16] of the supply chain. So for example, if I own a business that certified, you know, personal trainers

[08:23] and help them, you know, start their first gym, and then I help them grow their gym, and then I

[08:27] either had a franchise or I consulted with franchise owners and I made recommendations to these

[08:32] people to go into a franchise, then that would be a completely vertically integrated business. Now,

[08:35] I might also own adjacent portions of that. I might own the processing. I might own the CRMs. I might

[08:41] own the physical products that they are selling within that distribution base. And all of these are

[08:44] different ways that you can increase your total addressable market and ultimately the amount of things

[08:48] that you sell. Now, with each of these changes comes tremendous operational complexity. And so if you're

[08:52] going to make one of these switches, I would do so incredibly carefully and make sure that you're not

[08:57] doing the number one mistake that I see on entrepreneurs make, which is thinking that an artificial

[09:01] bottleneck on a channel is a reflection of the bottleneck of the size of their market. All right,

[09:07] it's one of the number one issues that I see. And so hopefully found value to this. Hopefully, if you

[09:11] are stuck at your current level of growth, think about increasing left-hand growth profit per customer,

[09:15] or it's just adding another channel, either of those things will likely be bottleneck you,

[09:20] but you may be in a situation where it might be better for you to go down market or go up market.

[09:24] And make sure that when you're doing that, you're addressing the pricing accordingly. You can't

[09:27] go up market and just charge twice as much because there's so much, so many fewer of those customers

[09:31] than they're going to expect a lot more. And to the same degree, and this is one of the biggest

[09:34] mistakes that I've made, I went down market, I trusted my price accordingly, but I actually kept

[09:39] my service the same. And so it was actually not viable for me because I was putting so much time

[09:43] and effort into people who didn't pay enough. And then it didn't work out. All right, and so hopefully

[09:48] this makes sense to you. Hopefully you found value in this. Click subscribe and I'll see you guys in the

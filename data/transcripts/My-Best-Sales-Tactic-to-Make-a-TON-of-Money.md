[00:00] I want to tell you about the most powerful sales tactic that I have learned.

[00:03] I never learned it from a book.

[00:04] I actually learned it by accident and it will be included in the 100-military

[00:07] OS sales book when it comes out and so you heard it your first.

[00:09] But it's a concept that you can do as a sales person to gain trust and I stumbled into this.

[00:14] I ended up selling 100% of people after I mean this one switch in how I sold.

[00:18] And I was able to teach it to people who would never sold before and they were able to close

[00:22] 80-90% of people who were coming in the door.

[00:24] Mind you, this is a retail environment selling physical products.

[00:27] So, re-wine the clock.

[00:28] I was selling stuff on my gym and the way that we would sell stuff on my own is that

[00:32] you would sell some sort of service package and then we'd do a nutrition orientation.

[00:35] And it came up the nutrition orientation.

[00:36] We'd actually set them up with their meal plans and then we'd make recommendations for products.

[00:40] Now normally I would sell pretty well but still I always wanted to sell more and get better.

[00:44] We'd killed this launch for like a new challenge or something and we had a hundred new customers,

[00:48] oursters come in and I ran out one of the key products.

[00:51] I had ladies come in the first half of the day and able to get the products and then some of their

[00:55] friends who signed up with them came in the second half the day and we're like hey my friend

[00:59] Sanie told me that I need X, X, Y and Z and I was like oh we don't have Z anymore and it was

[01:04] like really awkward.

[01:05] Now like a lady came in and so rather than me trying to screw around this clear item that was

[01:10] on the list that I didn't have I said hey by the way you can get this one for cheaper down

[01:17] the street at Costco.

[01:18] So like you don't need to get this one for me like this one's a little better but I think

[01:22] it'll get the job done.

[01:23] You can get this one after you've done the program and they were like oh thanks like that was cool.

[01:27] After I made that one cross out I was like but you do want this in this for us and they're like

[01:31] okay cool.

[01:32] As soon as I made that switch from saying hey you don't need to buy this when you can get that

[01:35] from over there everyone bought when I recommended afterwards and I was like whoa and so then

[01:41] I leaned into that and was like I wonder if I could do more of that so I could sell even more

[01:45] on the backside.

[01:46] So then I had two products that I was like hey you can get this and this over here get this brand

[01:52] it should be at this price you can go get it it'll save you 10 or 20 bucks and they were like

[01:56] wow even better and then I remember I looked at my list and there was you know a lady there

[01:59] and it was like a mask painter and she obviously wasn't trying to gain mass and so I was like

[02:02] you're not trying to gain mass sorry and she's like no it's like you can just cross that out go

[02:05] ahead you only worry about that and so I gave her a recommendation two things that you could

[02:08] get for cheaper and then I said you don't need to worry about this and then when I said hey

[02:12] like I needed to take two of these in the morning next to this take three of these take

[02:15] him next to this put this in your car so you always have it with you I closed everyone what that

[02:18] gave birth to was something that I used to call sacrificial lands but now I call ghost products

[02:23] because it sounds better but I ended up over time not even carrying the products that I had

[02:27] on there that I was recommending out because they were so powerful as a sales tool for me to gain

[02:34] trust from the other person this is an incredibly incredibly powerful tactic and like all

[02:40] persuasion the difference between manipulation and help is intention and so if you want to help

[02:45] someone you are manipulating them but you're just doing it in a positive intent now and if you change

[02:49] someone's behavior and you have negative intent you are manipulating them if you believe in the

[02:53] stuff that you sell you can create an environment where someone will trust you faster by giving them

[02:57] a reason to trust you and so that means that you acted in their self interest rather than your

[03:01] own so that they can feel like you're not trying to take advantage of them now if you know that they

[03:05] need the stuff but they don't yet know that they need the stuff then you can make a concession

[03:09] using a ghost product or using a sack of the film so that you can gain the trust faster and so

[03:13] if you feel uncomfortable about not having the product on your menu then you're feel free to carry

[03:20] a product and never sell it if you feel like it but I realized quickly that I was never selling

[03:23] it and I was always giving those ones away and so if you're going to use this tactic my recommendation

[03:27] is to make the products that you send across the street to be the ones that are the lowest

[03:32] margin product gain the trust by giving away the low margin stuff and then keep the high

[03:36] margin stuff for yourself so that people trust you and then they buy that stuff and so if you're

[03:41] in an environment where you sell multiple products this has been the most effective way that I've

[03:46] learned to sell what you want to do is give someone a vision of what their life's going to be like

[03:50] when they're experiencing the benefits and so you want to explain to them exactly how to take it

[03:56] before you make the ass what we would do is say hey this one is going to help you do benefit benefit

[04:02] the way that I need you to take it need you to take it is that you're going to take two of these

[04:07] in the morning then I ask a question and I'm like what do you do every day no matter what in the

[04:11] morning do you wake up in smoke and cigarette do you drink a cup of coffee do you take a shower like

[04:15] brush your teeth like what's something you do every morning and then they say well I brush my

[04:18] teeth every morning and I'm like cool so I want you to put this in your cupboard because you'll

[04:21] forget about it I want you to put the next year toothbrush so we don't have to make a new habit

[04:24] and they're like oh and what I want you to do piece of tape put a two on it I want you to take

[04:29] two of them or put an extra toothbrush got it that's number one I would go through that with

[04:33] each of the products that I have and I would say okay you can have all these you're good to go

[04:37] did you just want to use the card you have on file now they don't have to take their wallet out

[04:41] they don't have to make another purchase and they just have to say yes it's a one click upsell

[04:45] that is a combination of a prescriptive clothes and having ghost products to set up trust

[04:49] you're also being a good coach by showing them how they're going to make this happen in the

[04:54] ruin and this is obviously consumption based product any product that you want someone to use

[04:58] they have to use it at a certain point and so we want to figure out ways to associate the usage

[05:03] of the act of the product with something they're already doing getting someone to make a new habit

[05:07] it's incredibly difficult getting someone to break a habit is incredibly difficult and so we just

[05:10] want to piggyback on habits they already have and so that makes you both a better sales person and

[05:13] better coach like overall if you're trying to help someone and so that kind of selling process that

[05:18] set clothes gain the trust make the prescription works unbelievably well and then if for some

[05:23] reason the point person's like well how much does this cause blah blah blah blah they can say well

[05:27] are you want a budget and if they're like I'm on a budget that's like okay then would you like

[05:31] me to order these in order of importance and the things that I think you absolutely need to have

[05:35] versus things that'll just get you more benefit faster what I would then do is take off one and say

[05:40] this would be the lowest when I'd removed is this work for you and if they're like I can't do that

[05:43] be like we're really getting into the bare bones here I be like I could take this one out but like

[05:47] this is what I want you to add to your diet to replace this thing you don't want to show

[05:51] that what you took out is an important cause then it looks like your son still doesn't matter

[05:54] she's like these are increased but you're going to have to use a shit little broccoli now all right

[05:57] so you're okay that you know what I'll just get the thing okay cool now it's back in hopefully

[06:01] when you're showing something you're trying to solve a problem if they don't buy the thing

[06:04] then you reintroduce the problem that you were solving so it's like hey I don't want you have to

[06:08] eat a pound of broccoli which is why I had this they're trusting me to make the prescription

[06:12] because that's why they're paying you for expertise and then you can pause to say well are there

[06:15] things that are your old identity that you're going to stop doing is a result of doing this program

[06:19] are you going to go out unless you're going to drink class or you're going to smoke class or you

[06:23] going to whatever else and like cool well how much of that you do cool we just found some money

[06:27] don't worry about it let's associate with these new activities new identity if this sounds really

[06:31] smooth I've done this a lot of times you'll get used to it and I think one of the best gifts you can

[06:35] have is trying to tack yourself into an existing sales process of a big business so if you work

[06:41] at a business as well as lots of low ticket stuff like think car washes massage think nails think

[06:47] hair stuff where they just see lots of people every day at low tickets see if you can work with a

[06:51] business owner and incorporate some sort of inject yourself into their sales process so that you can

[06:56] get rep after rep after rep after rep after rep and it will teach you more about the skill of

[07:00] selling and dealing with people than any course ever will and it will equip you for whatever you

[07:04] want to sell for the rest of your life so when the best things I ever did was do tons and tons of

[07:08] transactions at low tickets so that when I got to selling higher ticket more expensive stuff I was like

[07:13] oh my god this is a breeze if you sold services let's say sold web design services and you had like

[07:17] a laundry list of stuff you could say hey we this is like we can do this but it's not necessarily

[07:22] our core capability and it would probably cost you more if we did it because we'd have to allocate

[07:25] more resources so there's guys in the Philippines that will do it for you I've got a connection I

[07:30] can that can talk to you to about after this call and if you really want to be sneaky about it if

[07:35] you're the owner it's harder if you're a sales person owners tell your sales people this you can

[07:39] have it seem like they're leaning on their side of the table to be like came in like you don't

[07:43] need to worry about this like just I'll hook you up with a number of a guy and then the sales person

[07:48] becomes incredibly trusted it becomes like they're on that side of the table but what the person doesn't

[07:52] know is that they're trying to sell the other stuff at the end of the day the goal is the sales

[07:55] person is to move to their side of the table if you start the conversation across the table the

[07:59] goal is to end shoulder to shoulder so that you're both looking to the decision together with the

[08:03] same information to make the best decision for the person and so if you can walk yourself around the

[08:07] table psychologically this is one of the fastest ways to do it

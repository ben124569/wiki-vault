[00:00] Going to everyone, welcome back.

[00:02] So I want to make this video because I, in our community, was talking yesterday about the

[00:06] math behind how to know how many sessions you should have as you're reopening to make

[00:11] sure that you are profitable.

[00:13] The issue that's going to come up is a lot of different states have different recommendations.

[00:17] Some of them are based on percentage of capacity, reopening through COVID.

[00:21] Some of them are limited to 10 people or it's the greater of the two or the lesser of the

[00:26] two excuse me.

[00:28] And so what that does is it creates a lot of issues for most gyms because the profit model

[00:36] is not built for large group training to not be able to do large group training.

[00:40] And so what I mean by that is if you're charging, let's say $5 a session or $10 a session

[00:46] for what it would work out to in terms of the attendance for your $100 a month clients,

[00:51] if you're only able to have 10 people per session at your facility, that would include

[00:56] you and probably one other person.

[00:57] So now you're down to eight.

[00:59] Now if you're providing one on eight service, it doesn't make monetary sense for you to be

[01:06] in business, right?

[01:07] So even though you get permission to open backup, it doesn't mean that you're necessarily

[01:11] going to have the profit to be able to do so.

[01:13] So if you were to come back to your full client schedule, when you come back, you probably

[01:18] won't be profitable.

[01:19] And so this is how you reopen the right way.

[01:22] So there's two main components of this and I'll go through each one as in depth of

[01:27] second.

[01:28] All right, the first is what I was mentioning just now.

[01:31] If you're only able to have 10 people per session, then you need to price your services

[01:36] at the price that that service would be normally offered.

[01:40] So if people are normally paying $129 a month at your facility or $150 a month or whatever

[01:46] for unlimited and you're only able to have 60 people a day, your gym if you had six sessions

[01:51] a day, for example, those sessions, you can't even have 60 because you're going to be included

[01:56] in that.

[01:57] So now you're talking 50 people a day that you can service, which means you can only service

[02:01] 50 customers.

[02:02] All right?

[02:03] So if you're having a one on eight scenario, then you need to charge $300 or $400 a month

[02:09] for that service as long as that happens.

[02:12] Now here's the good news.

[02:13] The people who will want to come back are going to be itching to come back.

[02:16] Not everyone is going to come back, but the people who do want to come back desperately

[02:19] want to come back.

[02:20] And so they'll likely, you'll have the supply demand curve in your favor, meaning there's

[02:24] more people who want you than there is availability of time for you to be able to train

[02:28] clients.

[02:29] All right?

[02:30] And so when you have supply demand in your favor, that means you can increase your price.

[02:33] And so those things work together for kind of scenario one, okay?

[02:38] If you are limited and can't do like that, many people per session, etc.

[02:41] Okay?

[02:42] You need to adjust your price to reflect the level of service being provided, not just letting

[02:47] people back in their old price because it doesn't make monetary sense, okay?

[02:52] Now what I'm going to do is talk about the second piece, which is how do I know what it

[02:55] makes monetary sense?

[02:57] So one of the things in the Jim one secrets book in section two, which is the profit

[03:01] levers, which I would highly encourage you to read before you reopen, because it'll

[03:05] allow you to fix everything that you did wrong in your gym.

[03:07] This is one of the biggest opportunities all time for people who own a gym, because

[03:11] right now society is giving you permission to change all these things in your gym at once

[03:16] and then restart the right way with the right price points, the right hours, the right

[03:21] enough amount of people per session, all of those things done right so that you can maximize

[03:26] the profit and capacity of facility.

[03:28] All right, so this is like never before we be able to get this opportunity, so take it.

[03:32] Please take 35 minutes and read section two of the Jim one secrets book.

[03:37] It's free plus shipping, go read it.

[03:39] All right, now here's the, here's one of the biggest pieces that I have to provide for

[03:45] you, okay?

[03:47] You want to make sure that you're making an 80% gross margin minimum on your services.

[03:51] All right, this is, this has been a rule of thumb that we've used to Jim lunch forever.

[03:54] If you are running on that, then you will be able to make a profit and have a good business

[03:58] if you do not and you're like, well, we're at 75.

[04:01] I'm telling you every percentage point makes an enormous difference.

[04:04] So let me give you an example.

[04:05] If the average gym is running on 12.5% margins per year, all right, that's the average gym.

[04:09] If you go from 75 to 83% margins, then you add an 8% to your bottom one.

[04:16] So if you have from 12 to 20, that would be a very big deal, right, if you're almost twice as much money.

[04:21] So these percentage points matter, all right.

[04:24] So for us, now mind you, you can set the number whatever you want.

[04:27] My rule of thumb is minimum 80.

[04:29] If you want to be an 85 or 90, by all means, go for it.

[04:32] All right, you could, it's your business.

[04:34] You can set it up the right way.

[04:35] But let me walk through a simple math example to explain you exactly how many sessions you

[04:39] can know by math that you can reopen at any given moment.

[04:43] Okay.

[04:44] So if you have, let's say 150 customers before this and then you reach out to all of them.

[04:48] And only 100 want to come back.

[04:50] Cool.

[04:50] So let's say those 100 who have said, yes, I want to come back.

[04:53] You can build my card now.

[04:54] All right, are billing it a hundred dollars a month.

[04:56] I don't recommend that price point, but I'm saying if that is what they are saying,

[05:00] then that's what we're going to work off for the money math, all right.

[05:03] So that's $10,000 a month of recurring revenue that you have built in.

[05:08] Now, if you're running an 80% gross margin, that means that on the cost of delivering the

[05:13] services that doesn't include rent, the doesn't include admin, it doesn't include marketing,

[05:17] just your hard cost of fulfilling a session, all right, is 20% or less of what you are paying

[05:25] or what you are making.

[05:26] Okay.

[05:26] So what that means is if you're making $10,000 a month for your services,

[05:31] then it should cost you $2,000 a month or less to fulfill those services.

[05:37] So if we know that we only have $2,000 that's earmarked for payroll,

[05:41] for fulfillment of those services, and you know it costs you $20 per session,

[05:46] that means you have 100 sessions that you are able to fill on per month.

[05:51] Now, if we're going to be smart about this, then we're going to divide our 100 sessions by 4.3,

[05:56] which is how many weeks there are per month on average, which means we have 23 sessions per

[06:02] week that you're going to be able to fulfill, right, given the number of people and the amount of

[06:07] revenue that's being brought in, that is already happening.

[06:10] I don't go off of promises.

[06:11] I'm begging you, go off of reality.

[06:14] All right, you're going to have like some people's cars don't go through, because things have

[06:16] changed over the last two months.

[06:18] Some people will say they're going to come back and then don't.

[06:19] Some people are like, actually, I got away from my kids blah, blah, blah, blah.

[06:22] All right, go only off of reality, go off of what goes through.

[06:26] So you get everyone in, you start their billing, and then you see what happens, and then you take

[06:30] the schedule, right, if you can do that.

[06:33] If you can't, then you're going to have to downgrade your estimation by how much you were making

[06:37] before with all the cancellations included, and then drop another 10% just in case, and then use that

[06:42] as the number to base this off of.

[06:44] So $10,000, $2,000 for payroll, that means if we're getting $20 session, that's 100 sessions.

[06:51] We divide that as per month by the number of weeks in a month, which is 4.3, so we have 23 sessions per week.

[07:00] So you can allocate those.

[07:01] Let's say that we've got five days a week, Monday through Friday, that might be normal hours.

[07:05] So on those days, let's say we did four sessions today, two in the morning, two in the afternoon.

[07:10] So now we've got 20, we've got three left over, and so we can go three on Saturday, right, in the morning.

[07:15] If that's what we wanted to do, right?

[07:18] And so just like that, you can get your payroll, and you can get your business to a point where you have an 80% gross margin for higher.

[07:25] Right? And so like I said, that is the minimum, but that is the way that you can know,

[07:30] in your gut, they're opening up in a position to be profitable.

[07:34] Now, if you've done the math, and you're like, you know what, I can only have $10,000 a month recurring,

[07:38] and my red is six. Well, then you're probably not going to start out profitable,

[07:43] anyways, and so at that point, you're going to have to make hard decisions of like, do I want to

[07:46] do I want to do a big pre-sale, and then get another, you know, 50 or 100 people pre-sold on a trial

[07:51] to be able to monetize this, and that's where cash is really important, right?

[07:58] But big picture, most of you don't have that situation, and if you did have that kind of red,

[08:02] then hopefully your revenue is higher than that, hopefully your price is higher than that, et cetera.

[08:06] But that's how you can figure it out, and most people do this wrong. Most people are like,

[08:11] I'm trying to open up as many available times, right? Or the worst scenario you can have is,

[08:16] and this is what I feel like is going to happen for a ton of people is,

[08:19] I'm going to be limited to 10 people per session. I've got a hundred clients. I'm going to increase

[08:23] my overhead so that I can have 10 sessions a day so I can see all my clients, and there goes your

[08:29] margin forever, and then how do you transition back and having to cut sessions, right? It's not a

[08:35] good way to do it. Start as little as you can, start with two sessions a, start with 90% margins,

[08:41] right? That's fine. It's okay. Start with 90% margin to work at two sessions a day and work

[08:46] your way back. Start at three sessions a day, whatever. Right? So from there,

[08:51] this is one of those beautiful opportunities that if you ever had that session that never really had

[08:54] good attendance, right? Cut it. Cut it. Get your margin back. Right? And I just want everyone

[09:00] like think, COVID, like sure. There are things that you probably wish didn't happen. Okay. But take

[09:06] what you can, right? Right now you can click reset on your business. These are the five things that

[09:11] you need to do right now. All right? I'm going to give you the cliff notes. What you need to do? One,

[09:16] you need to switch from unlimited to two or three times a week as you're main offer. All right? Because

[09:20] right away, that'll double or triple your capacity. Two, you need to switch your billing to a weekly

[09:25] cadence. Now, doesn't have to actually be weekly, but it has to be on a weekly, biweekly or four

[09:29] times, or every four week cadence. Why? Because if you do it on every 28 days, you're going to get

[09:34] 13 billions a year instead of 12, which means you get an extra almost 8% in top line revenue for

[09:39] the same amount of service. Right? What that means is if you have a 12% margin, you get an 8%

[09:45] now you're at 20. All right? Almost doubles how much you make just from that one change. All right?

[09:49] Each of these levers is like that. Okay? So, unlimited to two to three times a week, you're going to

[09:56] switch to a billing cadence of weekly, biweekly or 28 day cycles. You're going to change your

[10:02] pricing to match your service. All right? Which means when you make these adjustments typically

[10:08] when you limit people's sessions, fewer people show up, which then means that a number of people

[10:12] per session goes down, which means your value goes up. And so that means that you can build more

[10:17] believe it or not. Because people change, it changes the value proposition to the end user. So,

[10:21] just remember that you're not cutting sessions, you're adding value by making it more personalized

[10:25] because the sessions are going to be smaller and more controlled. Okay? And so, when you do that,

[10:30] my minimum recommendation is 167. All right? That's my minimum. Bare minimum. Bare, bare, bare minimum.

[10:37] Which works out to $39 a week. All right? Bare minimum. Most people will be at $49 a week or

[10:43] $59 a week or $69 a week. Okay? And that's what you can do for those. And that's what the overall

[10:48] pricing would be. So, if you did it at $49 a week, $49 a week, $49 a week, $49 a week, $99 a week,

[10:53] don't forget your $99 cents. All right? Which means you're going to be $1999 every 28 days.

[10:59] All right? Beyond that, if you typically have exercise, is that you use that you wanted to get rid of,

[11:06] because they take too much space up and they eat too much square footage. This is the time to get rid of

[11:11] those things and take them out of the program. In terms of your sessions, instead of being 60 minutes,

[11:17] cut under 45. All right? It'll also increase your capacity and decrease your payroll. So, all of these

[11:24] things are things that you can do right now doing it the right way, starting with the right price,

[11:29] with the right services, the right amount of sessions, the right margin, so that you can actually

[11:34] come out of this profitable or even more profitable than you did before. Every person who goes in and tries

[11:39] to increase the amount of sessions they're doing, keep the pricing the same and then have more

[11:43] individualized service that they're going to do is going to go out, right? The math doesn't support it.

[11:50] And so just like if I can give you one thing, just trust the math, right? You will be able to make a

[11:54] profit, build a provider value, your customers and actually get through this, you can grow your gym,

[11:59] which hopefully is your goal. So that's part one of how to reopen the right way is structure

[12:05] everything properly. I'll probably make another video on how to how to market and sell before that. But

[12:11] right now, make sure to get this stuff right. If you get the book, there's a letter inside the book

[12:15] on how to communicate the changes, you literally copy it, go for it. It's my gift to you.

[12:21] If you don't know where the book is, just go to AlexysBook.com. There's a free book there. I think it's on Amazon too.

[12:26] If you do, by the way, you review lots of love. Anyways, happy Wednesday. When it makes sure I got

[12:31] that out for you and keeping awesome. Bye!

[00:00] What's going on everyone? I think one of the best things about entrepreneurship is the lessons that we learn from failure, right?

[00:05] And I try and share as many as I can on this on this, you know, vlog, podcast, et cetera.

[00:10] Because I think that if I can help you not have the failure to learn the lesson then you can get the lesson without the scar.

[00:16] That being said, one of the hardest things is learning the right lesson from failure.

[00:22] And so let me unpack that because I think it's one of the most profound things that we as entrepreneurs are just we as people have to learn

[00:29] is making sure that we're getting the right takeaway. So let me give you a couple of different examples to show you the wrong takeaways

[00:34] and then kind of maybe walk through a framework that might be useful. So

[00:38] let's say, you know, you're in middle school and you're dancing with someone of the opposite sex or whatever you're trying to do, whatever.

[00:45] Right? Your dancing was something you like and I'll just use the guy girl example because that's what I've used to.

[00:50] So it's like let's say I'm dancing with the girl and she breaks my heart, whatever.

[00:56] If I said, ah, girls aren't for me, right? Girls don't work, right? That would be ridiculous, right?

[01:02] Of course it would be. It would just mean that that didn't work in that one instance.

[01:06] But if I took the wrong lesson from it, then I might swear off women altogether, right?

[01:10] And what's interesting is that that's an incredibly ridiculous example, but people do it every single day,

[01:16] right? It's like a business owner who hires an employee and the employee doesn't work out and says, ah,

[01:21] employees, they all suck. They're not for me, right? It's learning the wrong lesson from the failure.

[01:28] And so I think it's just as dangerous, maybe even more dangerous to learn the wrong lesson because

[01:33] now you have a story that you've told yourself that reinforces the incorrect lesson and then from that

[01:38] point going forward, you've you operate under this false guys, this false belief that you've told yourself that you

[01:44] believe is right because you've experienced, right? And just because you have experiences when we took the right

[01:48] lesson from it. And so I'll tell you one that's that's been really that's been really interesting for me to learn.

[01:56] Is over the last, you know, over how many years, right? I have succeeded a lot based on in-bound

[02:03] marketing, right? So that means paid advertising to generate demand in inwards, right?

[02:09] And what's interesting about that is a lot of my successes come from it, but what's interesting is that I think

[02:14] that I've had a really long-term perspective when it comes to my health, right? Health and fitness,

[02:20] like when I work out and how I eat, I've always tried to pick really sustainable things that I can do forever,

[02:25] right? And I've been in pretty good shape for almost almost 20 years. And so that's been a

[02:33] successful action that I've been able to repeat over and over again. To the same degree, my marriage is actually

[02:38] probably one of the better things that I've done. I pick that rationally, my partner, Leila,

[02:45] and we both said we want to go this way, we have this mission, we have these values, and we'll figure out

[02:49] the love stuff as we go. And we actually got married before we really in love. Mostly just because we

[02:54] thought we were so aligned. And we've learned the love in every year, it's actually gotten better.

[02:59] And that was a rational decision that was made by, you know, by both of us. And it was based on

[03:05] long-term thinking. But what's interesting is that I've like been able to observe my own actions

[03:10] over the last decade, you know, in business. And I actually even think that I've still been more

[03:16] short-term skewed in my thinking because of the thing that I got really good at, which is inbound.

[03:21] And inbound, you can immediately, you can snap your fingers and make money tomorrow. And you can

[03:26] make a tremendous amount of money in a very short period of time. And I think in some ways,

[03:31] I may have learned the wrong lesson from my early success, which is success should come big and

[03:38] should come fast, right? For me, right? Because that's my own, it's for my own belief. And as I look at

[03:44] the things that I've done, that I've done really well for a long period of time, none of them follow

[03:48] that path, right? And so I've been, you know, strategically or deliberately, kind of deconstructing

[03:56] my beliefs around what I think success should look like and what growth should look like. And I'm

[04:01] finding myself more and more trying to move in the direction of sustainable growth, which I remember

[04:06] hearing when I was younger and mean like, oh, it's TorchCap. But now, as, you know, I feel like I've

[04:11] gotten more scars and more experience, I actually think that if you're really looking on an endless

[04:16] horizon, which is what I try to shift myself towards, then you only do things that you think are worthwhile

[04:21] and your obsession, my own obsession with the hurry and the rush, you know, I would love to say

[04:27] disappears, but at least it decreases, right? Because if you're like, you get from the finite to the

[04:32] infinite, you go for the, can I do this until I die? I know that what I do in finesse, I can do

[04:37] until I die. I know that, you know, the way that Layla and I run our marriage, I can do until I die.

[04:41] Like, the way that we've done this, we can do until I die. Now you might be like, oh, you're

[04:45] only been married five years. Sure. Maybe, yeah, maybe, like, maybe, maybe, maybe I'll have to

[04:49] keep saying this, and then it's like, you've only been married 10 years, only been married 20 years.

[04:52] I don't know, we'll say, right? But it feels the same long term way the way the other one said,

[04:59] because we have, there's way less volatility, it's just a slow and steady progress. And so when I think

[05:04] about what I like, how I'm trying to build things now, it's different, right? In the beginning,

[05:09] it was just like, short, hard, fast, like, let's go, let's go, let's go. And I feel like now, as I've

[05:14] gotten more experience, more weathered, it's more like, okay, this is our current growth rate.

[05:20] Can we just sustain this, right? Because if we, if we can just sustain this for 10 years,

[05:25] we'll be at 100 million plus, we'll be at 200 million plus, if we just do this. And what that's

[05:32] force me to do is, is increase the time between my thoughts and my actions, which,

[05:39] the entrepreneur is so interesting, because you have to kind of unlearn some of the things

[05:42] that got you started in the beginning, you can't do anything because you're so paralyzed. So

[05:45] you do need to decrease some of the time because you start taking action, right? But at a certain

[05:48] point, you start becoming so good at taking action that you end up breaking things, right? So you actually

[05:52] have to start increasing that time, and what that does is it gives you more space to make decisions

[05:57] that are in a, that are rational instead of emotional. And so that's when you see a competitor run

[06:02] and add, or you see an employee leave with clients, or whatever happens, and you want to have some

[06:06] reaction, and most times no reaction is the best decision. And this is just like, it's been this

[06:12] repeated trend that I've had. And so my current, the current lesson that I'm trying to see is,

[06:19] is actually not from failure, but making sure that I learned the correct lesson from my success.

[06:24] And thinking it might have actually been bad for me that I was, that I was so successful,

[06:29] so early on, and it might have been that I took the wrong strategy from it. And so what I,

[06:36] the things that I'm trying to build now are far more enduring and more stable and do not require

[06:43] me or my skill at all. And by doing that, I feel like I'm getting closer to the first

[06:49] time my life or actually have businesses that truly run without me, like actually, not as in like,

[06:56] oh, I don't do the day today, that's definitely one level and one component of it. But when it

[07:01] can get to the point where it truly grows without me, and I'm really just there to guide direction

[07:06] and be a sounding board for the leadership team that's in place. I feel like that's that's where

[07:12] I should go. And I feel like the things that I'm building now are in alignment with that.

[07:17] And it's been, it's taken years to get here. And so, anyhow, my goal is if you are, if you are in

[07:24] it's, and you're not growing as fast as you want, but you are growing, then extrapolate that over

[07:31] 10 years, right? Extraplate over five years and say, can I just grow at 10% every, every quarter? That's

[07:38] huge growth, right? Can I just do this every quarter? Can I just make this sustainable? Can I make

[07:43] this consistent? Because what I'm seeing is the richest people in the world just look for reliability.

[07:49] If you look for low volatility, which means less of this. And so if I can decrease the volatility

[07:54] in the business by making things more consistent and not going for the big, the big win that's

[07:59] like right there, right? And I just stay patient, it continues to pay dividends. And so that's kind

[08:05] of the chapter that I'm in right now. And the lesson that I'm trying to learn or walk. And so

[08:10] I figured I would just share that with you. And also just the thought process around looking at

[08:16] your successes and your failures and making sure that you learn the right lessons from them.

[08:19] Because I've definitely taken lessons from my successes that were not, that were not correct.

[08:25] And I've taken lessons from my failures that were not correct. And each of them is equally

[08:30] dooming or damning, right? And a fun final thought that I'll leave you with is

[08:36] would if everything that you did when you were successful was not because of you, but because of

[08:41] outside forces. And everything that you've done to fail was your fault. I've taken this

[08:47] perspective and tried to apply it to my life. And I've had an amazing amount of inferences and thoughts

[08:52] that have gone around it that have been completely new. So it's like, what if when you were

[08:56] successful at one time, maybe it wasn't because of you at all, maybe it was just chance, right?

[09:01] Maybe it's just coincidence. And I think a lot of times we apply those frameworks to other people,

[09:06] but never to ourselves. So someone does something bad. We say it's their fault. Something good

[09:09] happens if we don't like them. We're like, oh, that was because they got lucky or only because of

[09:13] this outside circumstance that wasn't because of them. But we never apply that to ourselves. And I

[09:16] think that if we do, if you reverse it, because we always want to say we take credit for our

[09:20] for our wins and we say our losses or because of outside circumstances. But if we flip that,

[09:25] a lot of times I think you get some really interesting lessons that can come from it and just

[09:29] just walking through the thought process, what if this wasn't because of me? What other things

[09:33] happened that did align up for me that were not my doing? And by doing that, you'll start to,

[09:40] you'll start to see different trends and different patterns that maybe you cannot, you can,

[09:43] you can take advantage of opportunities when they aren't because of you, but you can still

[09:47] take advantage, right? And so anyways, I wanted to share this thought process with you. For me,

[09:52] it's been incredibly valuable and I hope it is valuable for you too. So,

[09:56] enjoy and I'll see you in the next video. Bye.

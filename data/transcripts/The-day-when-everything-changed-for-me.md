[00:00] I remember I was driving back home and I got this text and it said,

[00:05] hey, we closed two sales today and there had been four people who had walked into the business.

[00:10] And I had to pull over to the side of the road because I was, I got so emotional.

[00:14] I got teary because it was the first time that someone else had ever sold something besides me.

[00:18] And so that was the first moment when I realized that like this could become a business that did not require me.

[00:24] And if you don't know why I am my name is Alex Shamozi, I would act position.com.

[00:27] It's a portfolio of companies that now does about $85 million.

[00:29] And the reason for this video is I want to walk you through one of the most important steps,

[00:34] which is how do you hire excellent salespeople?

[00:37] And how do you recognize great salespeople?

[00:40] And so now I've built, I can't tell you the amount of team like sales teams that we've now built up.

[00:44] But I can tell you this video is going to be specifically about recognizing talent.

[00:48] And so a couple quick frameworks that I want to go through.

[00:51] Number one, when I started in this business, I took every single sale and it was because I was so

[00:56] afraid that somebody would waste the opportunity.

[00:58] So if you have that fear, I understand where you're coming from.

[01:01] Second, when I had my first sale that was not me, I just had this emotional breakdowns.

[01:07] And I was like, oh my god, this could actually happen.

[01:08] And I promise you if you haven't had it happen yet, you will when it does because you realize

[01:12] that this business can actually work without you and other people can make it rain too.

[01:15] Right?

[01:16] And then I'll tell you a quick story that illustrate the next point that would make.

[01:19] So as I hired some salespeople, now that first salesperson were they exceptional?

[01:24] No, but they were able to get the job done.

[01:25] Later on, I had my first kind of like killer.

[01:29] And his name was Maro Nigretty.

[01:31] And he came in, I don't know, a year or two into the business, a year into the business.

[01:38] And he so quickly was able to assume the sales role.

[01:42] And to show you how laughable this says, he started and I was about to start training him.

[01:49] And some lady walked in the door and I was like, hey man, like, I can take he's like,

[01:53] no, I'm good. He's like, go to your thing. He's like, finished your sushi account about it.

[01:56] I'll get off the grid out. And he ended up closing this first lady who walks in the door for a

[02:01] paid and full. And I remember walking in like completely dumbstruck. I was like, he didn't even know

[02:06] what the pitch was. But she walked out, giggling, happy, so excited to start. And would that moment

[02:13] taught me was that it is good to train salespeople, but it's better to take great salespeople

[02:20] and then just point them in a direction. And so this has informed a lot of the thinking that I have

[02:25] around talent in general. And I'll tell you a couple of frameworks that have informed this. But like,

[02:30] if you look at Harvard, Harvard doesn't produce the smartest people. They select the smartest

[02:36] people. And then they put some more professors in front of them. But like the base level of intelligence

[02:42] of everyone who's at Harvard is already exceptionally high. And so like even if the teachers at

[02:46] Harvard were not exceptional, the students are and they would be successful independent of that

[02:50] because their selection is so ridiculous. And so if we can think about our own companies that way,

[02:56] especially if you're in their service business, like look at the biggest service companies out there.

[02:59] Like look at McKinsey, look at Bain, look at BCG, look at basically a lot of the finance world

[03:04] is our service base businesses, a lot of times. And they're able to do that because they create such

[03:11] a pool to select from that they are able to skim for the best talent. Right. I heard this

[03:16] quote from Estra Academy, who's the founder of Chick-fil-A, you win the championship in the draft.

[03:22] And so it was such a belief that they had about picking the right people even more so than training.

[03:26] And I would say that I have moved in that direction of a little bit more nature than nurture when it

[03:32] comes to roles specifically sales especially. There are certain characteristics about building

[03:39] rapport, about having certain dynamics or energy, whatever you want to say, that like Marna Grady

[03:44] when he walked in, he had all of these things and he didn't even know the pitch but he won that

[03:50] sale off of just pure rapport. And so if I'm going to allocate the same level of time to training

[03:56] somebody, I might as well start with somebody who is a much higher base because I could spend

[04:02] 10 hours to take someone from a two to a four and a half or I could spend the same 10 hours

[04:07] taking someone from a six to a nine. And the things I'm also going to get more bang for my

[04:11] buck in terms of my hours of training with somebody who has not a natural productivity for selling,

[04:16] compared to somebody who does not. What's interesting about this and this is just like my observation

[04:20] is that you just have to be willing to talk to more people in the recruiting process. I will say

[04:25] like from a recruiting standpoint there's there's two kind of things to look out for. If you're

[04:29] if you're if you cannot pay super handsily based on your price points which you need to maybe

[04:34] fix later but like if you can't pay super well for the sales person then you need to look harder

[04:40] and you'll need to interview more people and you'll need to probably run ads and use your network.

[04:43] If you can pay well the best sales people are already employed and so it comes down to recruiting

[04:49] those sales people from other sales jobs ideally from companies just like yours so that they already

[04:55] know a lot of the things coming into it so decreases the ramp up time for them because all you

[04:59] were to really doing is swapping products and the actual sales cycle, the type of sales that it

[05:04] transactional sales and a long sales that a software sales, a coaching program set whatever it is right

[05:08] there's so few variables that were changing that they can immediately jump and go which also allows

[05:13] you to make a judgment on their proficiency faster and so as a quick sign note to this because this

[05:18] is something that I've given a lot of thought if you look at the top sales people and sales trainers

[05:22] and this is going to drive point drive home the point that I was making earlier about it being

[05:26] much of it being born. Is that if you look at the top people who are in the space you look at

[05:33] Jordan Belferer right you look at Bradley you look at and some people would would say me in term

[05:39] from a selling perspective all the guys that I know who have taught sales were exceptional sales people

[05:46] day one. Bradley started selling cars when he was 18 years old and was the top salesman at 18 years

[05:51] old when he started and he was like I just found something I was really good at. Jordan Belfer talks

[05:56] about how he didn't know how to train anybody in his book and then almost said and he for the first

[05:59] time ever wrote out a framework to explain the straight line sales system which became his book

[06:04] and all that kind of stuff but he up to that point it was just what he naturally did right and I

[06:08] could tell you in my instance as well I already closed thousands of deals before I even consume my

[06:13] first sales training and so like I do think that if we are selecting sales people I think it's

[06:20] much more about selection than it is about training the training is to remind them how good they are

[06:24] not necessarily to make them good. All right and this is something that has shifted over time

[06:27] for me specifically now if you're like well I suck at sales you can absolutely put way more time

[06:32] into yourself than a business would reasonably put into an employee. All right like you have you all the

[06:36] time so you can train you in all your off hours and you're spending your own time to invest in yourself

[06:41] but for return on investment perspective it's the cost of finding a good sales person compared to

[06:47] the cost of training a bad or mediocre sales person is significantly lower it's much easier to find

[06:52] the right people than it is to take somebody and then make such a crazy extensive training unless

[06:57] your entire model is we just take on every single person who walks in the door like 24

[07:01] often it has this model they take on anybody who has a pulse and then they put them through

[07:05] ridiculous calling process and then 10% of people make it in the first 90 days.

[07:10] I'd maybe all speak ever in your neighbor. Right that's their process and then those people know

[07:16] how to sell and so they just make ridiculous requirements that almost no one can meet except for

[07:20] exceptional sales people and they they let that they have obviously training systems or

[07:24] but for the most part it's teaching them about their process and just having old sales people explain

[07:29] a new sales people some of the tips and tricks that have just like made them better rather than

[07:33] teaching the fundamentals of selling and so back to you if you're somebody who's not good at sales that's

[07:38] okay you get there through practice and repetition but in terms of like you have to get good at it

[07:44] because it is it is like it is according to your running of business especially as small business

[07:48] is learning out of clothes right and so if you take time to learn it it's okay it's a skill that

[07:52] you're going to add in your arsenal and then it'll allow you to recognize good sales people in the

[07:56] future but you can't spend a year trying to train somebody who's not good you can spend a year

[08:02] trying to train you right and that's the difference when we're selecting for exceptional sales people

[08:07] which is what I'm saying selecting for exceptional sales people if you pay less you have to talk

[08:12] to more people to find them and then you have to have low tolerance in terms of how quickly they

[08:16] make a sale and I would say for us if somebody doesn't close a deal in the first sale cycle

[08:21] meaning like depending on the length of the transaction like some people you know there's all

[08:25] transactional sales some people might be a two-week sales cycle or a one-month sales cycle depending

[08:29] on what you're selling if someone has done a full sales cycle and they haven't closed the deal

[08:33] already know that they're not a killer because every single killer I've ever had close his deals in the

[08:37] first cycle just like more of a gritty like I said earlier the killers come in and start killing

[08:42] and then they just get better at killing with the tweaks and the trainings that we have the guys

[08:45] who don't do that are the ones that are like no get me in the shot I like I just got to learn like

[08:50] you know blah blah blah blah and the thing is it's like it just drag zones and inevitable

[08:53] consequence and so right now if you have somebody in your team and you've been in that drag

[08:57] get it on and they're like just barely good enough to stay on the team and every single quarter

[09:02] you're like are we gonna like oh this guy I don't know he's not like a winner but like I guess we kind

[09:06] of need him to keep putting some numbers up if you get rid of the people who are dragging the team

[09:10] down the culture of the team will improve and I promise you whenever you cut the bottom the top

[09:15] moves up right and then it also will set the new bar for the person who comes in it's like this is

[09:19] how a world-class team operates are you up for this and the thing is is the tighter and the higher that

[09:26] team is the faster they'll point the person out if they don't fit or they'll immediately accept

[09:31] and glob in the person they'll be part of the unit so if you're looking for salespeople and you're

[09:36] looking to scale the sales team the best salespeople are born in my opinion not made we can select

[09:41] for those people either through recruiting them directly from people who have very similar businesses to us

[09:46] or we have to interview many more people and the feeling you get in that tingle when you're like oh

[09:51] god I really have to have this guy that's when you hire not when you're like I mean I guess this guy

[09:55] could do the job can't do that it's not gonna work and then on the flip side once that person is in

[10:00] if they haven't closed the deal on that first cycle the longer I've been doing business the shorter

[10:05] my tolerance for somebody not being exceptional is because every person that has been exceptional

[10:09] I know immediately and so I just have less and less time where I think maybe they'll turn it around

[10:13] maybe some more training we'll get them there when it's when a lot of times you win the draft on the pick

[10:18] and so thank you guys appreciate it if you're new to most of your nation welcome and I'll see you guys

[10:22] the next video bye

[00:00] In this video, we will walk you to the exact anti-routine that took me from Broke to taking

[00:04] home over 7 figures a month in income, not revenue.

[00:07] Income by the time I was 28 years old.

[00:09] And then, it may sound totally unbelievable to you.

[00:11] That's okay.

[00:12] You can Google me.

[00:13] My name is Alex Ormozi, a business investor out at acquisition.com, which is a portfolio of

[00:16] companies that says about $85 million.

[00:18] And the reason I'm making this video is because I see stuff on the internet all the time

[00:21] with people talking about their $1 million routine and all the stuff.

[00:23] And all the guys that I know who are like me are like worth 9 figures and up don't do it

[00:27] that way.

[00:28] And so I'm going to walk you through what people actually do and the things that I had

[00:31] to go through in those seasons of building that are not commonly talked about.

[00:36] As additional note, there's, for some reason, there's like a half-second freeze that happens

[00:40] like every so often on the video.

[00:42] It's something we're fixing on our side.

[00:44] But my audio continues to go throughout, so don't sweat it and we are fixing it.

[00:48] Either way, walking in imagination and enjoy the video.

[00:51] All right, so what I want to do is actually walk you through the paradox of that happened

[00:55] in my life when I went from looking up bankruptcy lawyers to 18 months later, taking home

[00:59] over a million dollars a month when I was 27 years old.

[01:02] All right, this is half a decade ago.

[01:03] But there was a very distinct process that happened that, that transformed my life and it

[01:08] did have to do with a routine, which is like the most father thing ever that most people

[01:15] ask me for, which is like, hey Alex, what you're routine, but what I'm going to do in this

[01:18] video is break down to why the questions that people are asking are wrong because they're

[01:22] asking them the wrong way.

[01:23] The first thing here is that most people have the assumption that when they say hey Alex can

[01:28] tell me your routines, can you tell me your rituals that you do every day, they think that

[01:31] themselves, there's something that Alex is doing that I am not doing and therefore if

[01:34] I do those things, I will get that result.

[01:37] And I will tell you that you were wrong, here's why.

[01:39] Most people, most champions, do not have something that you do not have, they lack something

[01:45] that you have.

[01:46] For a champion in the physical realm a lot of times, if they don't have an off switch,

[01:50] they just keep going.

[01:51] You have an off switch, it is your lap, they're lack of it, which is what drives their

[01:55] success.

[01:56] Right?

[01:57] And so to the same degree, you probably do things every single day that you should not

[02:01] be doing.

[02:02] And so what I want to introduce to you is a concept of the anti-routine as the most productive

[02:06] routine that is humanly possible for you to accomplish what you want.

[02:10] And so during this 18 month period of time when I went from almost bankrupt to take you

[02:15] home a million dollars a month when I was 27 years old was the following change that ended

[02:19] up happening and mindset shifts.

[02:20] I'll walk through the mindset shifts and then I'll walk through the tactics that actually

[02:23] changed my life in a real way, the things that I stopped doing, rather than things that

[02:27] I started doing, that ended up yielding the results that were outside.

[02:31] So number one is, I absolutely do shifting the perspective of I need to do more things

[02:35] and I need to add more things to my routine.

[02:37] When in fact you need to stop doing things that you're currently doing, all that remains

[02:41] is the work to be done.

[02:42] And then you become very clear about why you're not being affected.

[02:45] So number one is that priorities mean two things cannot be equally important.

[02:50] And here's the mentally challenging thing about this.

[02:52] Is that when you work on something and let's say I spend 30 minutes on this thing and

[02:58] I spend 30 minutes on item B.

[03:00] If I spend 30 minutes on both things and I say this one's more important than this one,

[03:04] I can say that but that's not reality because I basically just said they were both important

[03:09] which means neither of them are which is why most people cannot get shit done because

[03:12] they cannot say no.

[03:15] And so the theme of this entire video is the word no.

[03:19] And so this is the word that I would give you that you can tell yourself you can

[03:23] plaster it on your wall is the season of no.

[03:26] And I'm not saying it's forever.

[03:28] I'm saying it's just for right now.

[03:29] A lot of people don't need a new thing to add to the routine.

[03:32] You need to have a routine of saying no and an anti-retain.

[03:36] And that is the thing that's going to yield those, those outsized returns are productivity.

[03:40] You can't say yes to everything and therefore it means that you have to do two things

[03:45] with different levels of importance.

[03:47] It's either important or it's not important.

[03:49] If it's important it means you say no to everything else.

[03:51] All right.

[03:52] So if you say this is the priority that it means you do not do other things besides that

[03:56] thing.

[03:57] That is how it is a priority that is how you literally prioritize.

[04:00] Number two is that from a communication perspective one of the things that I had to really

[04:04] understand and I'm a pretty people pleasing person.

[04:07] I enjoy a joy.

[04:08] I enjoy other people like I'm social.

[04:10] Is that when people communicate with you, when people reach out to you, when people text

[04:15] you, when people email you, they actually have an implied ask within the communication

[04:20] from you.

[04:21] It's actually a take and what that takes says is that there's a request to reply.

[04:26] Are there asking you to do something which is to reply to the message and to illustrate

[04:30] why you can't do this at scale is because let me imagine right now that 500,000 people

[04:36] text you.

[04:37] Do you owe them all a reply?

[04:39] The answer is no because you couldn't literally do anything else in your life besides

[04:42] reply to those people if that's what you did.

[04:45] And so here's what's crazy.

[04:46] Most people have the time to reply and conflate the fact that they have time with the fact

[04:51] that they are obliged, they are obligated to reply.

[04:54] And so when I show you that 500,000 text example, it's to show you that if I can remove

[04:58] the time from your brain that means it would be physically impossible for you to reply,

[05:02] you realize that the obligation to reply never existed to begin with.

[05:06] And so during this season of no, during this this anti-retain period of time, what I did

[05:12] during that 18 months was I stopped reclined to people and not only that, and I'll get

[05:17] to the taxes of how I did that in a second, but I just stopped reclined all together.

[05:21] And this was a huge thing for me.

[05:22] It was very, very difficult for me and I'll give you the extra taxes for what I said.

[05:26] The next thing I realized that all of the events and masterminds and coaching programs

[05:32] mostly served other social, they were mostly for social needs.

[05:35] They were not because I had a problem that needed to be solved.

[05:38] And so I ended up going to a mastermind, getting what I needed.

[05:42] And then I didn't show up to that same mastermind for the next 18 months.

[05:45] And then from there, 18 months later, that was like a huge success story in the mastermind.

[05:49] And it wasn't because I got what I needed.

[05:52] And then I spent the rest of that time executing and there was no point to me going back

[05:55] because I knew what needed to be done and it needed to do it.

[05:57] And that was it.

[05:58] Here are some of the tactics that I ended up implementing during this period of time

[06:03] that massively changed my life because it got me to stop doing everything that I was doing

[06:08] so that all that remained was the work to be done.

[06:11] All right.

[06:11] So number one is that I changed my phone number.

[06:14] I've changed my phone number because all these people were always asking me to reply.

[06:18] And so there's the actual time of communication of the the the

[06:21] constant texting back and forth, all the interruptions.

[06:23] But also the hey, you got a sex, hey, can we hop on a meeting?

[06:27] Hey, can I bend your ear?

[06:27] Hey, can we talk about this thing?

[06:29] Hey, do you want a jam on this topic?

[06:30] Right?

[06:31] And as somebody who likes to give, I was always literally when I looked at my schedule

[06:35] half my day was like one off calls that I was like, well, maybe this is an important thing.

[06:39] But you would be amazed at how much blank space appears in your calendar when you say no to everything.

[06:45] Like, like, I really want to like you would be amazed and how much blank space shows

[06:51] up on your calendar when you say no to everything.

[06:54] So number one is that changed my phone number.

[06:56] What I did is I actually gave my phone number to my EA and I got a new phone number.

[06:59] And the only people that I would choose to communicate with were people that I realized that I needed to.

[07:03] And then I would find their number rather than at being responsive to everything the person who had mine,

[07:08] whichever the years was a lot.

[07:09] So that's the first thing I did.

[07:10] The second, like I said, is I stopped going to all of these events because I knew what needed to be done.

[07:16] So I didn't need more information.

[07:17] I needed more execution.

[07:18] Right?

[07:19] So if you look at yourself, it's like doing more information or doing more execution.

[07:22] Now if you're ignorant in terms of knowing what you need to do to succeed, you need to go like what

[07:25] needs to be done is you need to find out the information.

[07:27] But once you know what needs to be done anything that is you not doing that thing is getting in the way

[07:32] of you accomplishing what you want.

[07:33] Number three is that I stopped taking meetings for 4 a.m. to noon every day.

[07:38] I worked for the first day, hours completely uninterrupted.

[07:40] And it was because during that first season when you're, you know, zero to one million,

[07:44] one million to three million, sometimes even at five million.

[07:47] Sometimes you're still you don't have enough leverage because of your team or maybe the number,

[07:52] the level of talent on your team, the you need to still be doing a lot of doing.

[07:55] Like you can't look at what like my routine might be now because I have teams of people that

[08:00] if I say hey, go do this and do this and do this and do this.

[08:03] I've 20 people who can execute and those 20 people are going to amount to more work that I can do

[08:08] possibly on my own and that's because I have leverage.

[08:11] But until you have leverage, leveraging your time appropriately is what is going to move the

[08:15] needle the most.

[08:16] And so from 4 a.m. to noon every single day, I accepted no meetings that only worked on the

[08:21] priority, which meant I did the thing and I said, note everything else.

[08:24] The next thing that I started saying no to, what does I said no to bed times that were different

[08:30] on weekends versus weekdays. I stopped treating weekends different than I treated weekdays.

[08:34] And I had the same bed time so I had the same wake up time so that every single day,

[08:39] I could say no to everything during 4 to 12. All right.

[08:43] Now, once you say no to weekends as a different day to weekdays,

[08:47] the next thing is like, well, what are the other things that you've changed about your life in

[08:51] terms of allocating your time? What about your half? Well, during this period of time,

[08:54] I only worked out about twice a week and that was because that was my minimum effective dose for

[08:57] working out, right? Because that was all I needed just to maintain. I wasn't trying to make progress

[09:02] on multiple fronts because it was not the priority. And I'm saying this again because people always

[09:07] want to make, you know, progress on 100 fronts. Sometimes like you have so much growth due to you.

[09:12] You only have so much and you have to allocate it to the things that are high as priority.

[09:16] And if it's a priority, then it means saying no to everything else. The next piece is like,

[09:21] what about food stuff? So for me, it was actually more productive for me to fast one or two days a week.

[09:26] Because then I could work and not be interrupted by the eating preparation, thinking, cleaning a

[09:31] food. Two days a week, I would just have caffeine and bone broth and that was what I did for the day.

[09:35] And it was super easy and that way I stopped, you know, I started starting losing a little bit of

[09:41] fat while I was at it. The next thing I did was I deleted all social media from my phone.

[09:45] And that is because I realized that I could have an accurate time on calendar which was just

[09:50] a post and I could do most of the apps from my computer. So if you're actually just going there

[09:55] to post, not to consume and interact, you can do most of the social media stuff from your computer.

[10:01] And that's what I ended up doing. So I deleted all that stuff from my phone and you'd be amazed

[10:05] at your like ghost thumb of how addicted you are because most people spend like three or five hours

[10:09] a day on their phone consuming social media. It's literally the new age of watching television.

[10:13] And we're like, I can't think about how to get stuff. It's like, if you got those three hours

[10:17] back, you would have so much more stuff done, which goes back to the entire routine. It's not

[10:21] what you are not doing, which is causing, uh, is something that there's some secret magic routine

[10:27] that's going to get you there. It's just that most of the stuff you are doing, you need to stop

[10:31] and you need to enter into a season of no. Those were the, the primary tactics that I changed

[10:36] during the 18 months of going from almost back up to taking home over my dog's month. When I was 27

[10:42] I knew I was just once straight into the rain here, but if you don't know why, and my name's Alex

[10:45] from Ozi out acquisition.com, it's a, I'm a business investor we do. We have about six portfolio companies

[10:50] at this point. We do about 85 million dollars a year. I make these videos because I, two was once broke

[10:55] and I don't want other people to go through the same stuff that I did and so if I can provide value

[10:59] and make sure that my pain was not in vain. All right, so, enjoy the videos. I appreciate you

[11:04] Mose Nation. If you're new, welcome and I'll see you in the next videos. Bye!

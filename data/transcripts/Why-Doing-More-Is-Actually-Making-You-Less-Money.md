[00:00] Remember that friend of yours who got rich dropped her being day trading, buying crypto,

[00:04] and wholesaling all the same time? Right, me neither.

[00:07] And so today, a watch, a single mama five, you could potentially be making much much more.

[00:12] But she keeps launching new businesses and she's incredibly spread thin and overwhelmed.

[00:15] But if you ever made a situation where you have constant foam mode,

[00:18] you keep chasing new opportunities, this video might save you years of your life.

[00:21] Let's just start with playing the clip.

[00:22] So last year, my company made a million, I've already made a million this year,

[00:27] but I think I'm on track for four, but I hope to hit 10.

[00:30] So here's the deal.

[00:32] Okay.

[00:32] Because I get really bored.

[00:34] Right.

[00:35] And so I'm also really amazing visionary.

[00:38] And so I've built a lot of different things.

[00:40] And what I'm needing right now is I need clarity.

[00:44] Okay?

[00:45] And I need you to, I would love for you to help me focus.

[00:49] Okay?

[00:50] I'm going to share with you what I've done.

[00:51] I'm going to share with you what I have.

[00:53] And then I would love for you to show me

[00:55] is how do I get clarity?

[00:56] Okay.

[00:56] We shall.

[00:57] Yeah.

[00:58] So I have a publishing house.

[00:59] Okay.

[01:00] But really what I've sold is that I take people on these five-day adventures,

[01:04] like luxury adventures, and I can help people channel their books in five days.

[01:08] And that's what's filled my pocket.

[01:10] Cool.

[01:10] But it's also just not scalable.

[01:12] And why is it not scalable?

[01:14] Well, because one week a month, I'm on these adventures.

[01:19] And I love it, but it's like, there's like a ceiling.

[01:22] And so then I like rented this island, the middle of the British Virgin Islands.

[01:26] I took 15 people there.

[01:27] We all write their books for five days.

[01:28] And so that was like scalable, which that landed me a TV show.

[01:32] So now I have this TV show, but then I have like,

[01:34] like by publishing house.

[01:36] And then like I have this business school for women.

[01:38] Yeah.

[01:39] And then like, I'm also like a single mom of five kids.

[01:43] Also I like write books on the corner.

[01:46] Also I did a live event in January and close 1.25 million.

[01:51] And five minutes to a crowd of 30.

[01:54] So I was like, I have all these things.

[01:56] I just like, I just need some.

[02:00] So she's got a lot going on as you can imagine.

[02:03] But the thing is, it's like, before I had kind of like my big entrepreneurial breakthrough,

[02:07] I had my six gyms.

[02:10] I had a car practice agency.

[02:13] I had a dental agency.

[02:14] And then I had the turnaround launch business, where I was flying out and doing

[02:17] done for you sales.

[02:18] So I had nine different businesses.

[02:21] And I was doing around the same revenue that Kira says here.

[02:23] I was doing, you know, a few million dollars a year.

[02:25] I was so spread then and silver-wild.

[02:28] And the thing is, is like, if you went on lock like super super success in my opinion,

[02:32] you have to concentrate your energy like you have a magnifying glass from the sun.

[02:35] Think about your potential or your intelligence or your work ethic is like the size of the magnifying glass,

[02:40] which is the more, you know, sun it captures.

[02:43] So you have potential.

[02:44] But it doesn't matter how big the magnifying glass is that's capturing the sun.

[02:47] If it's not focused on one point, it's not going to do anything.

[02:50] You got to pick.

[02:52] You got to pick one of your five kids.

[02:56] The 10 year old, all day.

[02:57] There you go.

[02:58] So you just got to think about which one's the 10 year old of your businesses.

[03:04] The thing is, is the more talented you are, the more opportune means you know you could crush.

[03:09] Which just means more things you have to say no to.

[03:12] And it's just like, it's the reality of it.

[03:14] I mean, the thing is, there's a price to that, which is, if you continue to do what you're currently doing,

[03:22] you pay a price on either side.

[03:23] On, if you continue, you pay the price of how big the impact you want to have and how big of a business

[03:28] you ultimately build.

[03:29] That's the price.

[03:30] When you get for that trade is you get to have the novelty and the excitement of new things happening all the time.

[03:37] On the other side, you build something really big that has teams and systems and it just, you know,

[03:42] grows really large, probably maybe, maybe not bigger than your vision, but large,

[03:46] much larger than what you have right now.

[03:48] And what you give up for that is all of the novelty that's associated with doing your things.

[03:55] Yeah.

[03:57] So which one?

[04:00] It sounds like you know which one you should do and you want to do something different.

[04:04] I feel like when I when I've been looking out like, hey, well, what has brought people to me,

[04:09] it's always the books and I keep trying to get out of it because there's so many people and there's so many things

[04:14] and all these systems in publishing and I'm like, but if I just ran the business school,

[04:19] like, I don't have to have all these like editors and formaters and book covers and, right?

[04:24] But then I look at like, well, what do people always come to me for? It's always books.

[04:32] Yeah.

[04:33] This is, you know, Alex just two sets.

[04:35] Really you're on my channel. So I guess, yes, yes, it's okay for me to share a much or so.

[04:39] There's big visionary stuff and then there's just kind of like real everyday business and

[04:42] so I'm going to give the real everyday business perspective on this. Go over the money's at.

[04:47] If everybody comes and says, hey, I want to give you money to do something or hey, I want to buy this thing from you.

[04:51] Over and over again, listen, that's feedback from the marketplace to use the, you know, fancy business

[04:58] jargon. If everybody comes to you and says, hey, please solve this big problem for me, you're really good at it.

[05:03] Not only also can do it, it's like, that's amazing. It means you can build a business around that.

[05:07] In my business career, every business I've had has not been like the thing that I thought it was going to be when I started.

[05:13] Almost every time. I have this idea of like, oh, wouldn't be cool if.

[05:17] Right? And then what happens is I end up going to the marketplace to be like, I actually want this and I'm like,

[05:21] really, huh, wild, okay? And so I have to sometimes it's massive pivots that end up happening.

[05:28] But it's like, you need to be a bloodhound for for for value. And the way that you are a bloodhound for value is you solve other people's problems,

[05:36] which they give you, which you know, you've solved them because they give you money to do it.

[05:39] If I have three different doors to people can come in and they keep knocking on one and I'm like,

[05:43] what, why don't you, why don't you buy two or three? Two or three are great. It's like, well, they're like, I just want one.

[05:49] Instead of just being like trying to get them into two and three, just crush one and then

[05:55] remove all the other doors and then go all in on that. So you run the business school, right?

[05:59] Yeah. So imagine I come to you and I'm saying, hey, I've got this business. Everybody wants to buy for me.

[06:04] It has good margins. I saw it like crazy. But I have like four other businesses that I want to start.

[06:09] They don't grow as quickly as this other one. Which should I do?

[06:15] Weird. Sounds so easy when you say it. Yeah. Obviously. Right, right, right.

[06:20] Yeah. Yeah, okay.

[06:25] What you're encountering is a problem. I think everybody in this room has dealt with, right?

[06:31] It sucks. It's like you have to realize it like you can't pursue every opportunity. Not only can you

[06:35] out for each opportunity, you basically have to say no to every opportunity to be able to make one

[06:39] opportunity worth pursuing. If my TV show is on Amazon Prime and I'm helping people write books

[06:46] and then I'm like, but I'm pushing my business school. That doesn't even make sense.

[06:50] Yeah, I wouldn't push the business school. Just have the media asset of Prime that pushes you

[06:55] writing books and then help people write more books and then have a second season of Amazon Prime

[07:00] helping you, but people writing books and then some more people writing books. Yeah. All right.

[07:06] That's my financial advisor of the French. We got this, Julia. Yeah, Julia's like, I've seen the

[07:11] financials on the book when we do more of that, right? I had these these massive multi-year

[07:17] plat toes where I just stayed stuck because I wanted to pursue every single thing. And so you

[07:24] have to trade novelty for loyalty. And since you become loyal to the business, I also think

[07:28] that occurs with relationships. Like you make the trade. The new person every month, every week,

[07:32] every month, every whatever for somebody that you know that you've built something meaningful,

[07:37] that's deeper. And I think that you, it's kind of like, I think business in a lot of ways is like

[07:41] a fine wine where like you understand it at a different level. As the years go by and you go

[07:46] through different seasons. And I think that you miss out on that opportunity if you're going

[07:50] after you know one night stands and flings from a business perspective. Do you know my life?

[07:57] Yeah, you have to. Like life will not give you what you want if you want everything.

[08:04] Damn. Like we, we have to make trades where we get nothing.

[08:10] And it's tough. And I think there's a big, a big realization. I want to say a few years back.

[08:14] Where once I realized how much work it takes to make something truly great and something big,

[08:20] I had this moment of like deep sadness where I realized that I could only do a few things throughout

[08:24] the rest of my life. I was like, oh, I only have like two maybe three entrepreneurial seasons left

[08:30] in me. Which is kind of like crazy to think about. It's like I only get two or three more big swings.

[08:34] That's it. And the real real is that if the swing just keeps going, which is what I plan on doing

[08:39] acquisition.com, it's like, this is it. I'm going to do this until I get too old to do it. And

[08:44] that's it. That's all it is. Now what I want to do is give you something tactical. All right,

[08:48] because this is we're all the way up here. You have to take your creative energy and I have a lot of that, too.

[08:53] And you have to channel it into something that is a creative to the business,

[08:56] something that adds value rather than something that attracts value. And so what are the components

[09:00] of the business that need novelty on a regular basis?

[09:07] I think. I can give you a hint.

[09:10] What marketing? Market actually has a sell market. Yeah. Like, so if you want to build and you

[09:15] want to create, I have the same itch. Yeah. I put all of my ADD into content. I've become a

[09:22] significantly better entrepreneur by making content because it distracts me from fucking up my business.

[09:27] No. This is legit. I just wrote a book about. I just wrote a book about when leaders get bored.

[09:35] They just fuck it all up for a new city. Yeah. And I just keep doing it over and over.

[09:39] So instead, just paint the city. Okay. Just paint it. Don't destroy it. Just paint it

[09:44] in a color. Got it. And so that, like, and that goes for everyone. Like my ADD, like I put it into

[09:50] ads, I put it into like the reason I write books is mostly for me. Like Layla, is it can you just write

[09:54] in another book? Because she's like, you're just getting into all of these things that you should

[09:58] just knock it into. Right? And so the thing is, is that when I am in writing,

[10:01] though, the business does exceptionally well because I do so little. Yeah. Right? Feel this.

[10:06] Yeah. I don't normally talk about this, but I think this feels incredibly relevant.

[10:12] So this is going to feel real for you. Yeah. And everyone else. So let's imagine the business.

[10:20] Like everyone's revenue here represents this like this line. You're revenue, not aggregate.

[10:25] But like this is that's your business that's normal business is happening.

[10:29] What I realized, this is me. So this is anecdotal. Is that whenever I decide to make a change in the

[10:34] business, I see about a 20% decrement or decrease in performance from whatever that changes.

[10:39] So I change a sales process. I change a leader to process the change in onboarding process.

[10:42] I change something that I have to train people up on something new. Now even if that change is

[10:46] something that I think is superior, I'm still going to have an immediate decrease in performance.

[10:51] Now, what if I assume this to be true, which in my experience it's been about 20%. So if you're

[10:57] like what's the data research behind it, it's Alex doing this. Now, if I think that this improvement

[11:05] is going to make let's say a 5% improvement in the business. I think so you know, improve our

[11:10] our closing rate by 5% or something like that, then I'm going to take a guaranteed 20% loss

[11:15] for a potential 5% increase. That's right. Now, how many months is it going to take me in order

[11:22] to make up for the 20%, it's going to take 4, 5 months, right? And it's going to now, here's

[11:27] that really fun thing is that on an alternate timeline you have this thing, but when you leave

[11:32] people alone, they tend to just get better at their jobs. So you'll get the 5% improvement.

[11:39] And so what's happened is that I've actually created this rule, which is that if I don't see

[11:48] an adjusted or risk adjusted 20% improvement. So let me explain what I mean by that,

[11:53] which is I need to see a 40% improvement that I think has a 50 50 shot at happening

[12:00] for me to make any change at all. Damn.

[12:03] Let's say that you are going to run a test of some sort. You want to change your sales process,

[12:08] change something on a landing page, you want to, I mean change anything, right? You have some belief

[12:14] that it's going to improve, right? You wouldn't do it unless you thought there was a chance that

[12:17] it would improve the business, right? Of course not. But the thing is, is that what is that

[12:21] chance? And so your ability to estimate, I think we have a 50 50 shot, I think we have an 80 20 shot,

[12:26] I think we have a 20 80 shot, that this actually works, then allows you to over time get better and

[12:31] better estimating what the potential upside is for given intervention. And so if I know something

[12:37] is going to go down by 20% no matter what, because I change something. And that 20% decrease comes

[12:41] from training team and people kind of dealing with change. That's the price tag of trying. So

[12:47] think it's like, you don't have unlimited shots. So people talk about testing all the time test,

[12:51] test, test, test, test. Yeah, but there's also a cost to test. And so if you think you can maybe

[12:56] run only one test, like, even on something that's automated, like landing pages, if you change

[13:01] multiple things at once, you don't know where the, the, the, the correct attribution is like what

[13:05] actually made the benefit word, the, the decrease, right? And so you really only have like 52 tests

[13:11] a year, you've got about one a week that you can maybe do with sufficient volume of traffic.

[13:15] Right now, maybe you have two or three different areas, you know, funnels that you could do

[13:18] it on, but even then there's actually significantly fewer tests that you can run. Now in the people

[13:22] side of the business, it is way less than one a week. You're talking, okay, maybe you think one

[13:27] a month? I don't know. It's like we just did this this month. Are we going to really change the

[13:31] process again? So maybe you've got like one a quarter. She's got like four shots. Maybe that you're

[13:38] going to change in an apartment in terms of a true change that's going to occur in terms of

[13:42] process. And the thing is, is most not as per the number one, don't think about it like they've

[13:46] got a punch card that only has four changes on it. And so I kind of like this from the warm

[13:50] buffets perspective of like picking stocks and investing. He said, if everybody just had a punch card

[13:55] where they can only make 20 investments or whole life, people would do it exceptionally well.

[13:58] Because it forces you to actually think am I really buying this company? Am I really doing it for

[14:01] the long term? I do what I really believe in this. And so to the same degree, you as an entrepreneur,

[14:06] we've got like one punch a quarter. And the bigger the company is sometimes it's even fewer than that.

[14:10] And so if you only had your like, all right, is this the is this the bet I'm going to make? Like this is

[14:15] the shot on goal that I want to take of all the different bets, all the different ideas that I have.

[14:20] This is the one that I think has the highest upside and high slightly of happening.

[14:24] And so by me shifting my perspective on this and when I when I have so I have this big

[14:28] massive list of ideas which we'll talk about in a second in the video, I put an estimated value

[14:33] next to it. I think how much do I believe this could improve and how likely is it? And so when I have

[14:39] that I can rank order these and then when we do have bandwidth I'm like, okay, I think it's time to

[14:44] try this one. But it's better be worth it because the price tag no matter what is that your business

[14:50] gets worse. And so I have a list right now. It's Alex's big list of ideas which I encourage you to have.

[14:58] And I have it. It's on my phone. Every time I think of something else that we could do to improve this

[15:02] business, instead of messaging the team and saying, hey guys, emergency meeting, we're going to do

[15:08] this just such a great idea. I just write it down and I just keep living my life.

[15:18] And every once in a while I'll have one where I'm like, this is actually a 40 50%

[15:24] you know, potential move. Then I'll go to the team and say, here's my reasoning behind this.

[15:30] And then they'll say, cool, you have four other 50% return moves that you've told us about in the

[15:35] last 30 days. Is this better than those ones? And then I'll look at it and be like,

[15:40] now it's not better than those ones. And so then I'll keep it on my list. And in the event that

[15:45] the entire team has been with and they're all breathing a little too easy, then I can go destroy

[15:49] their worlds. But what's ended up happening is that my businesses have improved so dramatically

[15:56] by me just saying, let's just let people do their jobs. And so I'm going to be crudied again

[16:02] just to emphasize this point, which is that I have grown to accept that some shit stays fucked.

[16:09] And so there are tons of things about the experience that you guys went through today. Hopefully it's

[16:13] been really positive between yesterday today. I hope it has been and the team was great. But there's

[16:17] probably a hundred things that I want to improve about it. But every time I want to go improve one of

[16:22] those things for others drop and it's not worth the cost of change. And so most of us just don't

[16:30] factor in the guaranteed 20% decrease for the potential, which we're usually overly optimistic on.

[16:36] I think this will be 40%. But then after it has all said and done, it's five. Was that worth it? No.

[16:42] And so hopefully this is not, you know, this is not I'm not just talking to you. I see a lot of

[16:47] head starting. This has been one of the most useful razors that I've used as an entrepreneur and it

[16:53] is made all of my business significantly better. I realize that there is this decrease in performance

[16:59] every time I change something because I have had enough fat fast feedback loops across different

[17:05] departments. And so like if we have something in sales and I want to change the sales process,

[17:12] I know that the first week we change something that's scripting, even if we think it's better,

[17:16] the team's going to take a second to adjust. They have muscle memory. They got to rebuild that

[17:19] muscle memory. When we would, you know, even change an onboarding process. Like I know that people

[17:25] are going to drop the ball. They're going to mess something up in the beginning. But then like

[17:27] they got to get the reps in and they can fix it. And the advisory practice has just been, you know,

[17:32] super successful at acquisition.com, helping businesses scale that aren't necessarily like,

[17:39] you know, ready for investment. We've been able to like, you know, tweak many things about the

[17:45] process. But I do know that every time we do make a change, I can see the decrease in performance

[17:50] before I see the increase. Now we do get to the increase. But every time I have to bear that cost,

[17:56] I'm like, I don't know if I want to change something again. And I think a lot of reasons that

[18:00] entrepreneurs don't realize it is because they don't track. And so we are, I will say like one of

[18:05] the things that we're pretty good at is like we're very good at tracking data at acquisition.com. And so

[18:10] we have a very, I very good metrics to get pumped to me. And so I can, I can, I can see the pain.

[18:16] And if you're too far away from it, you don't see the change in customer satisfaction, the change

[18:21] in NPS scores, the change in, you know, ascension rates, the change in turn, the change in,

[18:25] whatever it is, if you don't have real time metric, if you're looking at something on a monthly basis

[18:29] and you make a change and then the next week like, again, nothing happens, the next week, nothing

[18:34] happens. And you get, you know, numbers in reverse, you know, one month or three months later,

[18:38] and they're not even necessarily accurate or they're very vague or they're fudge and they're

[18:41] where there's multiple data streams that are conflicting, right? All those things make it very difficult

[18:45] for you to see clearly the cost of the things that you're doing. But the real real underneath of this

[18:51] is that the vast majority of entrepreneurs are changing so many things so often, that they never

[18:54] know what was the thing that broke besides them. And so tactical takeaway for you is number one,

[19:01] channel your ADD into the stuff that benefits the business by being creative. Number two, make a

[19:07] list of all your crazy ideas when they come up and don't tell anyone about them. And if it's season

[19:12] for two or four weeks and you still think about it, it's like maybe when you go to the store,

[19:16] you're like, maybe I'll buy this dress. I don't know, I'm just pretending to be a girlfriend for a second.

[19:19] And then you decide not to and it's like if you still think about the dress a month later,

[19:22] then go back and buy it. But in the moment, if you buy it, then it's usually a terrible decision.

[19:27] And so it's the same thing with this. Put the list down, sleep on it. If you're still thinking about

[19:31] that idea of month later, it probably has some legs. And then number three, if I am going to pull

[19:36] something off of my big list of crazy ideas, it better be worth it because I'm going to absolutely

[19:41] detonate a bomb on my business and to better be worth what's going to happen when the dust settles.

[19:45] Wow. This was hard for me to hear. And like everything I needed. Thank you.

[19:58] Thank you guys. So if you're seeing Kira who's the lovely lady in this video and you see

[20:06] kind of the people around, that's at our actual headquarters here in Vegas. And so if you're a business

[20:10] owner and you're feeling stuck or you're not sure what the next step is to maybe have to

[20:15] pivot the business or you're just scaling well. And you're like, I just want to make sure that I can

[20:19] pay down my ignorance tax and just keep this scaling going. We'd love to help. We'd love to meet

[20:23] you in person. And the reason that I even decided to do this in person thing at my office is that

[20:30] it's not scalable. And it's almost like purposely not scalable. And so it's just very cool for us.

[20:36] I think it's like it's deep. We get to actually meet you. All meet you. And really get to know the

[20:43] business. And get to know you and provide the highest value I possibly can. And so the reason I was

[20:50] willing to do that is because I think word of mouth travels faster than the amount of people that

[20:54] I can fit into a room. And so we try to make it absolutely exceptional experience and the reviews

[20:59] seems to indicate that people really like it a lot. And so yeah. So if you're a business owner

[21:05] and you have been like on the fan serendipating, a big decision that's coming up or like what the

[21:10] missing link is or where you need to focus in the business where you can get the most returns.

[21:15] That's our bread and butter. That's what we do every day. I knew we loved to have you out.

[21:18] So I'm sure there's a link somewhere. You can probably click it and get stuff.

[21:23] And book out with us and then maybe I'll see you out here in Vegas.

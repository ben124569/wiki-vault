[00:00] In the last 36 months, I've taken $37.9 million in dividends out of my business.

[00:06] All right, so that's not business sales, that's not anything else, that's $30.9 million

[00:12] in dividends, I've taken out in the last 36 months.

[00:15] And I wanted to lead with that mostly because I thought I would make the video a lot more interesting.

[00:21] For this, you don't know me when I'm Alex from OZI, I own acquisition.com.

[00:24] I wanted to talk to you because I had a really interesting conversation with a couple, as an entrepreneurial

[00:31] couple.

[00:32] And I caught myself in this tie-raight, this rant about passive income, and how it's not as cool as

[00:40] people think it is.

[00:41] And I wrote down some of the notes after the dinner, and I thought I would share it with you

[00:44] because I think that passive income is one of these things that people talk about all the

[00:48] time, it's the great headline for YouTube videos, and clickbait.

[00:53] And all this crap, and the thing is, is that number one, 99.9% of people will never have

[01:00] true passive income, or passive income as, you know, in an any material amount, if you own

[01:06] stocks and you get dividends from those stocks, then that is truly passive.

[01:10] But if all you do is actively manage your passive dividend stocks, then you have active

[01:17] income.

[01:18] And so what I want to do in this video, hopefully, is make active income great again.

[01:23] All right, active income is gotten a really ugly name.

[01:26] All right, let's be real.

[01:27] A lot of people are like, ah, you have a job.

[01:30] You know what's real?

[01:31] Everyone has a job.

[01:33] And everyone trades the exact same currency for the exact same output.

[01:36] We trade time for money.

[01:38] The only difference is that some of us have more leverage that we with which we trade that

[01:42] time for more money.

[01:44] But at the end of the day, we are always trading time for money.

[01:47] Period.

[01:48] I don't care what anyone says.

[01:50] The passive just means you trade a smaller percentage.

[01:53] And so rather than the, and if you've watched my billionaire mental models video, then

[01:58] you'll find this familiar, we like to speak in the binary of active versus passive when

[02:03] in reality is how passive or how active is this income stream?

[02:09] Ah, interesting.

[02:12] And what I want to do today is make an interesting argument for you about why I think

[02:15] passive income blows.

[02:16] All right.

[02:17] So, let us begin.

[02:20] Number one, I live in a building right now.

[02:22] If almost exclusively eight figure nine figure and 10 figure entrepreneurs.

[02:26] So that's 10 figures being billionaires, 100 millionaires and decimillators.

[02:31] And I will tell you this, having now seen especially lots of guys who are in that category

[02:36] who are 40, 50, sometimes 60 years old.

[02:39] Observation number one, we are not meant to not work.

[02:44] We are not meant to not work.

[02:46] We are meant to work.

[02:47] All right.

[02:48] One of these dudes pursue a pleasure filled life or a pleasure seeking life.

[02:55] It's one of the saddest things that you can possibly imagine.

[02:58] It is the weirdest thing.

[02:59] It's like seeing a tiger defamed, right?

[03:02] It's like it's, it's, it's not good.

[03:05] These guys are gladiators.

[03:07] These are guys who know how to win in the arena.

[03:10] And I'm not trying to project my desires onto their lives.

[03:12] It's their choice they can do it if they want.

[03:14] But me as a passive observer of looking at people that I believe have a lot of similar

[03:18] character traits to me.

[03:19] I see a different, different paths that I can go down in my life.

[03:23] And I can tell you, I do not like it.

[03:26] So number one, there is no off switch on a tiger.

[03:30] When you turn it off, it's not pretty.

[03:32] Number two, right now my wife and I probably make around 6 million issue year passively.

[03:41] In terms of like we have virtually, like on the, let's say zero is you're literally doing

[03:47] the thing.

[03:48] And 10 is you forgot that you do that, that there's anything to be done.

[03:53] And that would be completely passive versus completely active.

[03:56] I'd say there were probably like an 8.5.

[03:58] I'll tell you this, it's not fun.

[04:01] When we were actively involved in our businesses compared to now, I think honestly it was

[04:09] more fun.

[04:10] And I think a lot of people always want to portray that their current state is the most

[04:14] advanced state.

[04:16] And I can tell you over the last nine, maybe 12 months.

[04:20] Man, I've done almost nothing.

[04:21] I mean, the three videos a week I make on YouTube is probably like the most engaging work

[04:28] I do.

[04:29] It's like the only thing I'm like looking forward to every week because of how little

[04:32] that I'm doing in the business.

[04:33] And I'm bringing this up as this.

[04:35] All right.

[04:36] So make sure you hear the right message from this.

[04:38] I'm saying this in no way to flex.

[04:41] I'm saying this because I made that the goal.

[04:44] And I think that now that I am here, I regret it.

[04:50] I continue to solve problems in my business.

[04:52] And I had the perspective which was spoken to me as a younger entrepreneur, which is if

[04:56] you're doing something, if you're actively involved in the business, it means it can't run

[05:00] it without you, which means there is something wrong, which means you are not as good

[05:03] as an entrepreneur as you think you are because you are required to make this business work,

[05:07] which means it's not a real business.

[05:08] Right?

[05:09] I think that's horseshit.

[05:12] And I think that I can tell you right now truthfully because I've walked it.

[05:15] It's not just like a hypothetical idea.

[05:18] Like I truly do almost nothing in terms of what is on my calendar every day.

[05:22] And I can tell you I'm bored out of my mind.

[05:26] And so next, next season, so starting 2022, I'm going to be doing some big stuff.

[05:31] But the entire goal that I optimized around four years was passive income.

[05:37] It was, I want to build a business that can run without me.

[05:40] And from the dividends that I get from that business, I can do whatever I want.

[05:44] But here's what's crazy that they don't tell you.

[05:48] If you love the game, then why would you want to get yourself out of it?

[05:54] Huh?

[05:55] And that weird?

[05:57] It's like I love this thing.

[05:58] I'm so good at it that I'm going to play basketball so well that eventually I'm just

[06:03] going to stop playing and the team's going to win without me.

[06:08] And so I think what I've given myself permission to do as of late is I've given myself

[06:13] permission to work for the love of working because I choose to.

[06:19] And so I think that I had this idea when I was trying to scale my businesses that I wanted

[06:25] freedom to do whatever I wanted, right?

[06:27] We want the freedom to choose.

[06:29] But for some reason, over time, that got morphed into everything has to be passive.

[06:36] And I can tell, and I'm making this video so that hopefully you don't make the same mistake,

[06:40] which is like, it's okay to run your business.

[06:44] And it's okay to like, because I missed the shit out of it.

[06:49] I'm be honest with you, I do.

[06:51] But in an effort to create space so other people could rise up and they could have their

[06:55] own growth in development, I moved away so that they could have that opportunity.

[06:58] And the thing is, is now, I can't really jump back into business because otherwise I would

[07:02] displace people, right?

[07:04] I'm not needed.

[07:06] So it's been an interesting, interesting process for me to walk through this.

[07:10] We have this dream, we have this goal to have this thing that kicks off cash for every

[07:14] single month that's far and excess of what we need to live.

[07:17] But I am in a building where I get to see the outcome of what that looks like every day

[07:21] and it's not pretty.

[07:23] And I can tell you over the last nine months, 12 months of what my life has been, it's

[07:28] not pretty.

[07:30] It's not fun.

[07:31] It's boring.

[07:33] It's empty.

[07:34] There's nothing to do.

[07:36] And I got this quote from talking more and I really like it.

[07:39] He said, in the Bible, the first thing that God did and gave Adam was not Eve, it was

[07:46] a job.

[07:48] And I think that there's this, this, I don't know, a demon, a demon, a demon, a vacation,

[07:54] a demon, a person's a word there, something bad, right?

[07:58] People have been badding.

[08:00] Shaking their finger at work.

[08:04] Why?

[08:06] It's what we're supposed to do.

[08:08] And so I think that if we can focus on, and this is what I'm walking towards right

[08:13] now is now that you, at least for me, this is me talking to myself, is like, now that you've

[08:18] figured out that you can truly create something that can run without you.

[08:22] You've learned the skills of not just quote building a passive business, but truly a business

[08:27] that can run with value and grow, come up and grow.

[08:30] All right, there's one thing to create a business that can maintain with value and still

[08:33] continue to generate cash flow.

[08:35] It's a totally different thing to be able to put enough talent in place that a business

[08:39] can grow without you.

[08:41] That is when you actually have a business.

[08:43] I now know that I can do that.

[08:45] I can check that box off.

[08:47] But I feel like now I can be certain in that I can make the choice to say, I know that

[08:52] I can do that and I choose not to.

[08:55] Because I choose because it's my choice because I sought out freedom, right?

[09:00] I have the option, I know that I can build that.

[09:03] But now that I have experienced it, I've tasted that fruit.

[09:05] I know that of the different flavors of fruit, the one that I prefer, is I prefer the

[09:09] challenge.

[09:10] I prefer the game.

[09:11] I prefer being in the game rather than watch the team win without me.

[09:15] But I just think that passive income is not as cool as people think it is.

[09:18] I think we need to make active income cool again.

[09:20] We're meant to work.

[09:22] We have the freedom to choose, not the freedom to do nothing.

[09:25] Because we think that we want to have freedom to do all the shit that we want to do.

[09:28] But the thing is, is in the course of building the life that we have, there's nothing

[09:33] that gives you the rush of business.

[09:36] Nothing's as high as the acting is this.

[09:38] Right?

[09:39] And stuff that is as high acting as that.

[09:40] If done enough times, eventually you're going to die.

[09:42] You got into this game.

[09:43] You had these things in these hobbies that you enjoyed.

[09:45] You get rid of those hobbies to go double down on the game.

[09:49] You go and you continue to play the game.

[09:50] You eventually win the game.

[09:52] And then you look back.

[09:53] You now you have all this time because you continue to trade things to get more time

[09:58] back.

[09:59] Get more time back.

[10:00] And eventually you have all your time back.

[10:01] You have nothing to fucking do.

[10:04] And so then you're stuck in the position that I'm in right now, which is what do I

[10:09] enjoy?

[10:10] And I enjoy doing the things that got me here.

[10:12] And so that is what I'm going to be doing in the next chapter 2022.

[10:15] I'm going to be doubling down very aggressively.

[10:18] And you'll be seeing some moves from behind the sidelines behind the glass.

[10:22] I won't be doing.

[10:23] But I'll tell you that seeking pleasure is not the game.

[10:27] It's incredibly boring.

[10:29] And oh, yeah.

[10:32] This is something that no one ever shared with me.

[10:34] And I figured I would share it with you because most of the nation you guys fucking rock.

[10:37] Love you guys.

[10:38] And if you're new to this world, I think I said it at the beginning.

[10:42] But if I didn't, my name's Oximozioneacquisition.com.

[10:44] We did about 85 million dollars here.

[10:45] And if you enjoyed this video, I'm glad you did.

[10:49] And keep being awesome.

[10:50] And I'll see you guys in the next one.

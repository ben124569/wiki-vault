[00:00] I don't know portfolio of companies that does $85 million a year,

[00:02] and I was recently invited to Taki Moore's

[00:04] Mastermind of Keynote for his eight figure and up group.

[00:07] And it was a really fun discussion and presentation

[00:09] that I was able to give. I was very humbled to have been invited.

[00:12] And we talked about two main things that those business owners wanted to know.

[00:14] So if you're not at that level, this may not be for you.

[00:17] But we talked about two things. The first was how to scale a high performance sales team.

[00:20] So among our portfolio companies,

[00:21] I think the biggest team we have in those companies is a 26-person sales team.

[00:25] So we know what it looks like to recruit higher managed and

[00:28] incentivize and drive high performance sales.

[00:30] We've done that before with inbound and outbound sales,

[00:32] meaning cold calls versus taking phone funnel type type inbound leads

[00:35] through applications. So we've done both of those.

[00:37] And the other was more high level. So the conversation is kind of split into two pieces.

[00:40] One is focused very, very sales focused. And the second is focused on

[00:44] with I would consider high level observations of entrepreneurship of things that we've learned.

[00:48] Lessons beliefs that have served as well,

[00:50] and creating the portfolio company that we have. So if you don't know who I am, I'm Alex Mozi.

[00:54] I own acquisition.com. I hope you enjoy the video.

[00:56] So this is Alex and Layla, power team. They run a portfolio of companies.

[01:02] Probably many of you guys know them from there. Jim launch days and times.

[01:06] Team what I'd love to chat with you about is scaling lead gen with outbound.

[01:12] And then let's talk about scaling and exiting.

[01:15] Can we talk about outbound because a while ago,

[01:19] like when we first met, you were like the king of the ads, right?

[01:21] Yeah. And then you then you weren't. And the ads kind of disappeared.

[01:24] And I want to know kind of what? I don't want too many people to know that though.

[01:30] Are we allowed to know that? Oh, you don't want to know. No, no, no, no, no.

[01:33] Work, work, work cool. Everybody here run a friendier. That's my understanding, right? Friendier.

[01:38] Yes. 100% friendier. If you're cool with that, can you type friendier into the chat?

[01:42] I mean, everybody's officially signed. So I think it would, it would serve everyone to do a little

[01:47] bit of backstory in terms of why, like why would you even start something like this? Right?

[01:50] Because you're like, I'm already killing you know in Facebook and telling a TikTok, I've got YouTube

[01:53] guys going, et cetera. I will say that, I'll tell you why I started, which will probably

[01:59] lead into the second half of this story, which is what I, I told talk to you, like, I want to talk

[02:04] about this and I was like, I really want to talk about this and he was like, okay, well, have

[02:07] a talk about my thing first and then we got everything. Yeah. So two years ago,

[02:12] late in the night, you know, we were, you know, the, at that time only had two business to be a

[02:17] gym entrepreneur for a series of, one is the sub one company, one is the gym licensing company.

[02:21] And the company at that time was doing about a million a week. And we just finished our best

[02:25] month ever and we're walking outside and she looks at me and she's like, I don't want to

[02:29] fucking do this anymore. She's like, let's shut it down. And I was like, well, okay, maybe,

[02:39] but you know, let's see if we can get anything for this, right? And so I just immediately was like,

[02:43] I just agreed as cool as in tons of pain as an entrepreneur just, you know, doing all the things.

[02:47] And anyway, I called up a friend of mine who was in space and he was an investment degree.

[02:53] It sold similar companies and I was like, hey, these are numbers. Like, we think we can get for this.

[02:58] And he was like, holy shit. He's like, you can like 250 million if you just finished the next 12 months

[03:03] at this rate. And I was like 250 million with an M. He was like, yeah, you did 17 million profit

[03:12] you're second year. Like, yes, I can guess we could do that. So look at later. I was like, well,

[03:17] shit, you got 12 months in. She was like, I got 12 months for 250. I was like, okay, let's do this, right?

[03:23] And so that began what became a two and a half year journey that eventually

[03:28] resolved, you know, selling the business. And so I want to walk through kind of that process. And the

[03:33] first year of that was us realizing that we didn't actually have a business. We had a big group right?

[03:41] At the end of the day, I was at the events. I was one who made the products. I was the one who did the

[03:45] coaching calls every week. Probably something that's in a similar spot that somebody guys are in.

[03:50] And so the the biggest kind of weakness was that I was inextricably linked with the brand. So that was number one.

[03:57] Number two, and this is what I'm going to focus on first and this, I'll hopefully tie both these

[04:01] tours together is that we were, we were channel dependent. All right. And so we were selling

[04:05] gym owners, right? So business owners. So we're not in like the online fitness space. We're hard

[04:10] for brick and mortar. The talk to a couple of the bankers, a couple of private equity firms, people that

[04:14] I need to do the network, ask them for people. And I was like, what do you see as the weaknesses in our

[04:17] business? Like how can we make this better? And the two big, the three big things they said were

[04:21] churn. In terms of the how long customer stayed, they said, my name being the brand and the fact

[04:29] that we were channeled depend on Instagram and Facebook. And that was it. And that was 100% of our

[04:33] sales sales money. And so we kind of set out to fix that. And so I'll just talk about outbound

[04:40] since that was the channel that we chose to be our next thing. And it was because I could never get

[04:44] you to work in my niche. You know, if you're a little more mass, I think it's maybe I'm at a

[04:49] moron. It's very possible. And I couldn't get it to work. We have seen TikTok working as a side

[04:54] note, but for today we'll talk about outbound. So the outbound process takes significant longer

[04:59] than most people expect. That being said, it's part of the reason that private equity and

[05:05] potential acquires will value it is because it is the sturdy machine because if tomorrow Facebook

[05:11] got shut me down, it doesn't matter. Because if I literally have a phone, we can make money,

[05:17] like a phone, which is crazy to like the concept is still for an image. And so I want to tell you

[05:24] the sales numbers so that you can have perspective in terms of how long the start. So the first

[05:28] month we made one sale, the second month we made two sales. The third month we made four sales.

[05:35] I like whether you're the one. And mind you, this is months. So you're like 90 days in at this point.

[05:40] You're like, fuck, you've been putting effort towards this, etc. Right? And so one of the key

[05:45] differences to note with manual outbound, whether you're doing cold calls, cold emails,

[05:48] cold texts, whatever, doesn't matter which, like the primary way of doing it. We do a combo

[05:52] and get to that in a second. Is that every aspect of the funnel that we do digitally

[05:58] is the same except it's purely manual. So you have human variables that contribute to every step

[06:05] in the pipeline. Right? So we did two, we did four. The next month we did six or eight. And then we

[06:16] jumped to 12 and then we jumped to 16 and then we jumped to and you'll notice that this isn't quadratac.

[06:24] So it's not exponential. What you will see there is that it's more linear in nature and it's

[06:28] because we continue to add. So our price point is between right now is 20,000 is the cheapest

[06:33] thing we sell, which is a great point bill. So thank you for bringing this up. If you want to do

[06:38] outbound, your ticket has to be at least 15,000. The uneconomics don't really work. I guess they do.

[06:46] I just prefer to have lots of market. But in theory, it should be 15,000, a 15 K or more.

[06:53] And so for us, our LTV is $40,000 at current right now. It's going up. But when we started this,

[06:57] the LTV is $40 K because I started this in Corona for a brick and mortar jibs because we're brilliant.

[07:03] So if you continue this thing out, it took. So we're now we passed, we're at, we're at month 14

[07:10] from when we started. And now, 14 months in, it does about 45 sales a month.

[07:20] Which for us is roughly 60% of our sales volume. So we hit the halfway point and now we're a little more

[07:27] than half in that industry. Yeah, it's probably better than me pretending to draw. I'll get to my drawing

[07:32] thing a second or even do better. So I wanted to set this as a precedent because I had two different

[07:38] times where my leaders came to me where I'd do to continue to do this. And I just remember looking

[07:43] at them and I was like, this is why no one will remember your name. Okay, I did that.

[07:48] But I was like, guys, as long as we were seeing progress through the funnel, we have to continue

[07:52] because the end goal is I either have to own this thing for the rest of my life, which is okay,

[07:58] or, and I need to do it without it being dependent on a single channel, which actually do

[08:02] as it owner regardless. And then I'll feed into the second part of the story. Or we'll never be able

[08:08] to get out of this or exit it. Either way, because you have to exit, right? Every, you know, we have to sell

[08:14] and we're either selling it from our old self to our new self or selling it from our old self to a new

[08:17] employer. But either way, we have to get out of it at the channel dependency. Add a certain point.

[08:22] If you're below 10 million out of the new order, but once you're, once you're at 10 million,

[08:26] I think adding the second channel is important. In terms of the tactics around this,

[08:32] understanding the organizational chart, which creates the sale and the actual process of the sales

[08:37] kind of where we should start. So there are three different roles in our sales system.

[08:42] The first is we have, you know, different, there's SDR, BDR, the whole point is that it's the

[08:48] Colt, it's the first test points. They outbound person, SDRs and BDRs. I think we call them,

[08:52] what do we call them, BDRs? I don't remember. Whatever. How do we buy? Yeah, I think we call them BDRs.

[09:01] So, and this is an important point for our growth. It's good that you leave this, this three,

[09:05] the three lines because this is cool because there's going to be more detail in each of them.

[09:09] So we've got BDRs as level one. Level two, we've got SDS, which is sales development specialist.

[09:14] These guys qualify the leads and provide the value that the original person was promising.

[09:21] Third person is what we call BCs, so business consultants and these are the closets.

[09:27] We technically have a fourth for, we have another team that does all of our sanctions.

[09:31] That sells the 48-pronent, but this is, and it looks like a trismist tree if you were to look at the

[09:37] work chart like this. You got the base of BDRs who feed half as many SDS's, who then feed

[09:45] half as many BCs. In this model, if you replace a BDR mentally with what an advertisement used to do,

[09:54] that's exactly how this functions. The exception to this process compared to your

[10:00] inbound efforts are there's usually one additional call, typically. So, what we do is that we

[10:09] scrape lists off of Google. We have VAs in the Philippines enriched the data, which just

[10:14] means that they make sure that these are real, real gym owners that have actual facilities and

[10:19] these numbers work and these emails are verified. The actual like what's off of are they used,

[10:24] I honestly have no idea, because the person who manages that team is too special for me. But that's

[10:28] what they get. From there, our BDR team calls this list through phone murder. So, phone owners,

[10:35] it's what we use, we really like it. It's been exceptional. I highly recommend it.

[10:40] Those BDRs are required to make a hundred calls a day. The way that we structure this is that they get

[10:47] four hours to work per day. We purposely set it up that way so that we could have good sales

[10:54] people who want to move like. So, they've got extra hours and they do call blocks. The other

[10:59] reason is because the sales manager that I hired to build this entire team, his experience was that

[11:06] people cannot be productive for eight hours straight, cold calling. He said, if you give them

[11:09] eight hours of pay, he's like they'll do five and a half hours of calls. He's like, see,

[11:12] mine's will do four hours of paying at three and a half. And so, that was an efficiency thing.

[11:17] They are still expected to make a hundred calls a day. From those hundred calls, they're expected

[11:21] to have two appointments that show. Now, we have been doing this a long time now. And each of these

[11:27] steps took like each one of the things that I just mentioned, probably took two to four weeks to

[11:31] figure out where to rescript the data. How do we enrich it? Because we're calling out these bad

[11:37] numbers. Now that we're getting people to pick up, which by the way, phone burner wraps it with

[11:43] a local air code. If you don't have that feature, there's no point in using it. Like you need to wrap

[11:46] it in a little bit of your particular parts. Maybe shit. So, from there, you'll get your hundred

[11:51] dials. You'll get 20% to pick up. So, it's a hundred to 20. From the 20, we will have two

[11:57] who schedule and show. I only know the two because that's the only thing we compensate the one.

[12:01] All right. And so, the expectations that they get to in the beginning, it'll be one. Yes.

[12:06] All right. A hundred to twenty to two. What's the, uh, dumb question? What's the

[12:14] twenty, what's the two? Twenty is a pick-ups. So, a hundred dials, a hundred pick-ups, hello,

[12:20] of the twenty pick-ups. We get one to two to show. And that's to show for the SDS. Yep. Exactly.

[12:29] Now, this is a good thing for you guys, too. Is that everyone's in a while? You'll get, you'll get a

[12:33] savage and you'll know because they'll set five of that. Because if you guys picked up the phone

[12:37] and did it, you could set five of them. It's someone picked up, you could probably say. Right.

[12:40] But somebody who's newer, the nice thing with the BDRs is it takes two days to ram them up.

[12:44] It's not a hard position to teach. Yes. Here's the list. Here's the phone. Say these words.

[12:50] The phone calls are like five to ten minutes. Like they're not hard to train. And if you have

[12:53] a big repertoire of existing calls which you will, it's easy to just have them listen to those.

[12:58] So, uh, can we, can I be a gym for a second? Yeah. I've never done the calls. I've never done it.

[13:04] Do you have a rough idea? What they say? What it's about? Yeah. So, our, our whole pitch is basically,

[13:10] like, hang with them calling some gyms in the area. They've been struggling with XYZ, you know,

[13:13] a biggest concern, one, two and three. And so what we're doing is like, if gyms don't exist, our

[13:18] company doesn't exist. And so we'd like to just give you some of the stuff that's working well for them.

[13:22] Is that okay? This is from our private client thing, which normally we charge for, but we just want to

[13:26] help gyms out. Cool. Okay. So, what I'll do is I'll set you up with an appointment with Sean tomorrow

[13:32] and he'll run through each of these systems for your gym so that you can insert a dream outcome that you want.

[13:38] Which is get more leads, make more sales, charge more for it. Yeah. Awesome. I got that through

[13:43] the helpful. Yeah. And the, and the, and the BDRs, typically, uh, if they're good, they'll look

[13:49] up to gym before they make the call. Um, and so they can be like, hey, so that you post that thing.

[13:54] Yeah, I'm called, you know, from gym law and store, like, just want to help you guys out. We're talking

[13:57] a lot of gyms in the area. Like, tonality matters, right? Like, that's the stuff that the manager will

[14:02] see stuff. Um, but it's like, this is a good well play for us. It's like we just want to help you out.

[14:06] We're going to give you some stuff. No, no strings attached. They say cool. And then they show up for the

[14:11] SDS, right? Now, getting, getting them to show for the SDS, it's like you got to get into show sooner.

[14:16] We need to make sure that the thing that you were giving them, they truly perceive as valuable.

[14:20] And this is probably one of the biggest things that I can, that I can, if I can, if I can,

[14:24] this one took us longer to figure out is, and I don't think like lead magnets and stuff like that

[14:30] is valuable. Like, it's got to be like, it has to be something that people really want in your space.

[14:36] So even if it's something that's unscalable, do it unscalable and then figure out a system to

[14:41] scale it once you get the, once you get the flow go. Right? Because in the beginning, you're

[14:45] going to have one or two colors. It's not going to be a ton of volume. I promise you. And then you'll,

[14:50] you'll be able to figure out what's the thing that gets them to show up that they really want. Right?

[14:53] Can you get us back on the way? I see it was, sorry, but yeah, sorry. Can you give us an example of what

[14:58] valuable, not lead magnet, useful thing might be? I think we walked them through how to set up their sales

[15:05] room and the scripting that they use that we get, you know, double the amount of people who

[15:09] sign up or whatever. So it's a really valuable thing. Right? And then it's like, yeah, you're walking through

[15:13] and you're showing around Bob of all walks and then amazing. Yeah. The cool thing and they can sell the

[15:21] benefits. I can give you a twice as many people sign up and nothing else changing the light with

[15:23] that we go. Cool. All right. He's going to show you how we do it because this is the top one

[15:26] percent of Jim's doing. We should help you out. Okay. Love in the script. We just want to help you out.

[15:31] Hi, valuable thing. Old school telemarketing. Rub Nixon. You love this.

[15:35] Sure. Ron says, stud. So once we get them to the SDS, the SDS is full requirement

[15:44] is that they provide value. Crazy is shit. I know. Is that you actually deliver the thing that they

[15:49] think is really cool. Now here's the key point is that we want to show expertise. So the SDS

[15:54] for us almost exclusively is X clients. Now we may be in a situation where, you know, our clients

[16:01] are able to do that. You have to show some domain expertise, especially around this thing.

[16:06] And the idea is if we can show a couple of like really in depth nuggets that I like shit,

[16:10] I didn't think about that. While they're going through the process, they're like,

[16:12] fuck, these guys know what they're talking about. And so what happens is we terminate the

[16:18] the value delivery and we purposely leave about 15 minutes at the end of dead time that we

[16:24] would transition to getting them set up on another call. How long is this call?

[16:29] I think it's 45. So it's 30 to do the thing. 15 to set the next deal.

[16:35] The SDS is like, hey, you know, can I switch hats for a second? I know I'm just here to help you

[16:40] up. And we purposely make that to change the frame. We're trying to make a little frame shift,

[16:46] which is like, I couldn't help it here. When you were saying some of these things,

[16:50] I couldn't up like this, this studouts me, this studouts me, this, yeah, have you thought about these

[16:54] things? Because honestly, I just showed you this little thing, but that's like 1% of actually

[16:59] the amount of juice you could squeeze out your gym. It's like, if we just did the thing that we

[17:02] talked about, you double your business, but like what about orders of emergency? What we can get to like

[17:06] five X the business, because right now you're on 10% margins. And if we can get to the 35%,

[17:11] we just three and a half X to take on the income only by changing the way you produce. With that

[17:14] be valuable? Okay, cool. So do you know what we do? Because at this point, we haven't talked about

[17:20] us at all. So think about it. First call all about them value, second call,

[17:24] providing value, second half of that call, couldn't help it at XYZ. I don't normally do this.

[17:30] Bob, do you know what we actually do? And they're like, no, and it's like, oh, shoot. I feel so stupid.

[17:37] Yeah, so we literally help people just like you fix the thing that you just said you want with the

[17:41] thing, you know, by overcoming your biggest insecurity and fear. And they're like, oh my god,

[17:47] that's awesome. It's like, you know, we actually do this a hundred gyms a month. Like we can,

[17:50] we can walk like, this is our bread and butter. I didn't know you actually needed this. I just wanted

[17:54] to provide this for you to help you out. Oh, wow. Well, okay, let me see here. Hold on. Let me check

[18:00] with one of the one of our guys. You got 15, okay, cool. We're good. Your business owner, why don't we

[18:05] see if we can set this up for you right now, right? Let's be efficient with your time. Hold on one second.

[18:12] So then we call the closer, yeah, you call the closer live and then they have a dialogue that's

[18:18] scripted, but it's speaker phone. Yeah, the person who's on Zoom right now doesn't know that this

[18:23] conversation is scripted, but they can hear both sides. And this guy's like, dude, I'm super busy.

[18:28] I got so many gyms I got to talk to you. I got a hard stop in 15. I can maybe hop on.

[18:34] Okay, no, this guy's really awesome. He's he's a qualified gym. He's he's legit. He's big enough for us.

[18:38] Okay, okay, well, you got to make sure he's the right size and that he's got that he understands what we do.

[18:42] Yeah, no, no, it's all good, right? Okay, cool. Then I got I could hop on for 15 minutes.

[18:47] Guy drops into the Zoom, makes the introduction. And the goal here is not to sell them.

[18:54] The goal is just to connect them and build rapport. That's all it is. Because we could not get

[18:58] the S and this took us like two months to figure out. We could not get the SDS to show for the

[19:04] close calls. Like those the qualified appointments, we couldn't get them. They would set it. They

[19:07] wouldn't show up. And so we tried doing three way texts. We tried we tried a bunch of things. But if you

[19:13] do the face to face for they hop on the call, then they're like, yeah, perfect. Well, I got to go

[19:19] and in five, but I've got you down for tomorrow four, we're good to go and rock and roll, right? And just to be

[19:24] clear, like, this is no longer us giving you thing. I'm going to explain how our services work

[19:28] our pricing and see if it's good fit. Right? And so they clearly set the expectation that this is a sales call

[19:33] and that I will be trying to close them. And we're very clear about that. Yeah. And it's cool

[19:37] because we just had two calls we're about to go at this point. We transition and they shop the next day

[19:42] and it's just like you're in a close. Good. So here's the advantage of this. There's so much more.

[19:51] So here's the advantage of this model. So four callers, sorry, sorry, if you're looking at

[19:57] appointments, right? Yep. For us, we close 10% of scheduled SDS. So if there's two of these,

[20:07] right, two of those, we close 10% of those. Of showed set calls. We close 10%. So we close point two

[20:16] in that example, right? Yeah, exactly. And so for us, the cost to acquire customer from an

[20:25] advertising, I'll use cold calling is the advertising here. They get 50 bucks for every show.

[20:33] So it's $500. Right. So it's $500 in in BDR's per close, which for $40,000 LTV is pretty cool.

[20:44] And so that works out pretty well for us. And so the beautiful part about this model is that it takes,

[20:49] so the downsize are the upsides with this. It takes a long time to build and it also is impossible to break.

[20:57] Yeah, that can tell you. I sleep so much better as a business owner knowing that no matter what happens to

[21:02] tomorrow, we're going to close the else. So this is the part that I think everyone needs to,

[21:07] if you want to scroll up on. This is the, this is the more genius, a unit of fresh page. So I got you.

[21:15] So this is a key point that is sexiest fuck. All right. Who here would love to have a sales team system,

[21:24] a farm for building sales people? So we, so my CEO was an ex-pro baseball player. So we used the

[21:32] big, the pro baseball player analogy a lot. So right there in front of you, you've, and we even used

[21:38] the, we even used the terms, right. So we've got double A, we've got triple A and we've got the

[21:42] bigs, right. And so double A is the VDRs, triple A is the SDSs and then the bigs is like the big leagues,

[21:50] right. And so the key point here and this is like for those of you guys who are building 30 million,

[21:54] like this is where this gets interesting for everyone, right? Is that the, the human resource

[22:02] training system itself becomes an asset to the business. Because we know that when someone works

[22:08] their way up from being a BDR all the way to a BC, they know how to fucking close. Because these

[22:14] people were never spoiled with inbound leads. They got hung up on and cussed at. And so you guys want

[22:20] to know an interesting step. Our inbound closing percentage and we were considered pretty good

[22:25] at sales before this went from 20 to 25% to 60%. Yeah, wow. Because they got their teeth at the bottom.

[22:36] They're like, this person knows who we are asked for help and wants more information.

[22:42] They're like, for real? Yeah. And so here's why this is important with the titles. So BDR,

[22:50] there's four levels of BDRs. You've got junior BDRs, you've got associate BDRs, you've got BDR,

[22:57] and you've got senior BDR. And that same four step system applies to all of the levels.

[23:02] You mean junior? Yeah. associate? Yeah. The name. And then was the top thing I just said.

[23:10] Senior. Yeah. So think about your highest turn positions. Right? The reason that the positions are

[23:16] high-turn is because they cannot see progress. People who's hope when they run out of future, right?

[23:20] I think I damn what tells of that. I really like that. So they run out of future. So we need to do

[23:24] it. Yeah, we need to create future for them. And so it's my belief that a salesperson has like

[23:30] 68 weeks of steam in them before they start getting disheartened. And so what we did is that we

[23:36] created milestones, which are those qualifiers on the right, where if you hit an objective qualifier,

[23:44] you move up. And so as a junior, it would probably be 50 showed appointments, which will take you

[23:50] about eight weeks. After that, it'd be 100. And then at each one of these increases, and you'll

[23:56] know for your business, it might be a little different. But the point is that if you want to

[23:59] taste it, so it's about eight weeks of production between each one. Now, each one of these gives them

[24:06] a bump in title and a bump in peg. The pay bump is virtually in consequential. We go from 50 bucks

[24:12] to like 55 bucks, like it's not a huge deal. But to them, they feel like they're making progress in

[24:16] both status. And they have an objective measure of how well they're doing. Now, once they move their

[24:22] way through this, and then imagine as your new employee, you're getting trained up, and then boom,

[24:26] eight weeks in, you get a promotion. You're like, oh, nice. I'm doing a, wow, this is good. And then

[24:30] they gain some steam, and then boom, dude, eight weeks later, they're like, hey, I'm a full BDR,

[24:35] you know what I mean? Like, this is great. I got another raise. Once they get to the top of this

[24:38] ladder, this is the key nuance. You don't get promoted. You get the ability to pre-promote.

[24:45] Yeah, this is when you get to here. Senior. Yeah. Once you're a senior BDR,

[24:50] you now have the ability to be promoted. The benefit of this is also eliminates all the HR

[24:56] conversations for I want more money. We're like, here's the path. That's it. This is the grip

[25:00] path. It also helps people become career salespeople for you. So if you have issues of turn

[25:07] for your sales team, this gives them, I like, this is what my grip at this. And here's an important

[25:11] point. You probably heard what I said about the BDRs. They do not get paid very much. They don't.

[25:17] They're on target earnings if they hit all the commissions is 40 grand. Yeah, why? Now, how do you

[25:21] attract someone who can do this job well for $40,000? You don't. You attract them because they know

[25:29] that the guys who win the lottery make $200 a year. And they know because they have a clear career

[25:36] path in front of them that if they hit their metrics, they could get there in nine to 12 months.

[25:40] Yeah. So I'm like, what job in the world can you go from zero to $200,000 a year and nine to 12

[25:45] months with no degree? Here you can because we're pure meritocracy and the numbers don't lot.

[25:51] And so at the SDS level, it's the same exact thing. G or SDS, associate the just the word and

[26:00] then senior. Right. So we have each of these levels and there's tiny bumps in comfort each of those.

[26:05] And they really should just be almost symbolic more than they are significant because

[26:10] the toddler is more important than the cash, but the cash just goes, okay, and because you. Yeah.

[26:15] Exactly. You honestly, you could probably get away with this without even changing anything, but

[26:18] I like I like to give a little something and then they feel like there's there's no stuff.

[26:22] Ricky's got a question. If someone's level, if someone's results dropped to the level drop.

[26:26] Yes. Okay. So you never need to associate for whatever. You have to continue to earn your position.

[26:33] If you drop below qualifiers, you drop down. You go back to triple light, just like baseball.

[26:37] You go back down. Yeah. Yeah. I think it really is exactly that. It's exactly that.

[26:43] And the nice thing is because of this, everyone knows where they stand. So it cuts down some

[26:48] of the useless communication of like, pay and what am I doing and how well it's like,

[26:53] dude, it's right here. Everybody can see it. Right. And it's built like the Christopher

[26:56] Street because they see the top closing. They see their checks and the fuck that could be me.

[27:00] Right. And they know they get their counting the weeks until they can get there.

[27:04] Now, when we start scaling, because we add more BDRs, it trickles up the tree and we're going to need

[27:09] another closer. And so we look at the guys who are more qualified to be promoted.

[27:14] And we picked the one that we think's going to be the best fit and they get bumped. They get bumped

[27:17] up to the banks. And then it's, it's triored up. Like they've got two weeks to show us if they

[27:23] can close. If they can't close in two weeks, they drop back down. They get 10 deals.

[27:27] If everyone's curious. You get 10 deals to try. You don't close one at a time. You're out.

[27:31] Realistically, you should close more. But they're first 10, they got to close them.

[27:34] Yeah. And the reasoning behind that is I've, I've run and trained in scale of a lot of sales

[27:39] I have yet to find a killer who doesn't close in the first two weeks.

[27:43] Yeah. No one. Yeah.

[27:45] Sounds like guys who start hot and then visit. But no one who starts cold and then gets good.

[27:49] What do you all qualify for SDS and basically, you know, deals done? SDS is just BCC.

[27:59] It's, it's qualified shows. Yeah. So they have to, they have to qualify them. And they have to

[28:04] get them to show. That's, that's really it. Yeah. Because for example, in that call, if they can't

[28:09] get the person to be like, yeah, tell me more about that. And they're like, no, I'm not. But then

[28:13] they miss it. Right. And so that's why the domain expertise for the SDS, like lots of really cool

[28:19] little. Like if you have two or three really good nuggets that you always know are awesome,

[28:23] weave it into that conversation. And they're like, fuck, you know, like, dude, this is like this.

[28:26] This is like my fingernail of how big this is. Like, you should like the fact that you didn't know

[28:32] this, it both worries me and excites me for the opportunity that I think you haven't thrown it.

[28:37] And honestly, I'm not qualified to talk about it. But this guy who's got a dick bigger than the

[28:42] shack and, you know, cured cancer by six and help 5,000 people just like you be better than who you are,

[28:47] like he can help you. Let me see if he's available. He really never is. He's always

[28:50] but let me check. And then, and then he doesn't think. Yeah. I love it. So we've talked about,

[28:58] we've talked about this. We've talked about that. Yeah.

[29:02] Basically, call my hunches. It's closer.

[29:05] First of all, yeah. Can you just give us like the. Yeah. So yeah. So we use, I like to teach you

[29:14] really simple, simple, I can even most, most of you guys want to already know how to close. So,

[29:17] you know, I won't pour you with it. Yeah, you could use your own or if you don't have one,

[29:20] you could model from this. There might be something to steal. Yeah. So we make sure that every script

[29:25] follows close to a few points. It's always a question based framework. So we like questions

[29:30] because people can just like say, get off into Jupiter and just ask another question and bring

[29:33] some back. Each of these is kind of a milestone along the path. So C is clarified by

[29:39] there there, right? Sounds obvious, right? But it's like, hey, so I know you, you know, you wanted

[29:43] some help with the sales thing. I know that provided some value to you and I talked to John

[29:47] and he showed you a couple more things. So like, why do you say to take all this time? Like,

[29:51] what's, what's important to you about this? Like, why are you not getting what you want? Like,

[29:54] why should you be taking time to show up this fall? Right? And then they're like, well,

[29:57] and they're like, why do you want to go into information? It's like, you just get information

[30:00] on there. You're trying to solve something with the information. You know, because that would be

[30:02] it. Yeah, it's a luxury. Right? So as soon as we get it, then we nail them down and we label it,

[30:08] which is out. So it's like, okay, so I hear what you're saying, this is the reason you show up for the call.

[30:12] So I just want to be clear that if we achieve this outcome for you, you would be happy, right? You

[30:16] would be like, you guys rock. I'd love you. Awesome. You can imagine that. Okay, great. Okay. So you've

[30:21] wanted this. So we go to, oh, which is overview your past pain, right? We call this the pain cycle.

[30:26] So we're like, okay, so you've wanted this for however long. And what have you done so far to try?

[30:31] Because you seem like a pretty, you know, well-to-do person. You seem like you've got some work ethic.

[30:34] So I'm sure this is in the first thing, you know, first from probably of Hoptown. So like, what have you

[30:38] done so far? They go through it. We say, got it. How that worked for you. What was good? What was bad?

[30:43] Whenever they say something good, we say totally and we agree with it. If they say something was bad,

[30:47] we're like, oh, that's terrible. And we disagree unless there's a limiting belief that we need

[30:51] to pop before we get into the clothes. Yep. Then we go right back to the beginning. We say,

[30:55] what else have you done? And we keep going until there's nothing left for like, God, I can totally

[30:58] understand why you'd be frustrated at this point because it seems like you've done a lot. So I feel

[31:02] like you've got a lot of the pieces because the goal here is to make them feel like there's six

[31:05] inches away and then you one link to be successful. Totally. Right? Yeah. So you've got all these right

[31:10] things to place. You're so close. I mean, gosh, I feel like you've got your, this closer to

[31:14] hit your goal. So you've done all the stuff. This is what you want. This is why you're here. Do you want

[31:19] to hear it? Like, I think you'd be a good fit for the partner who works and they say, yes, we

[31:22] get permission. And then we go into ask which is solidification. So the reason we call a solidification

[31:27] is that a lot of most people here already know this, but a lot of salespeople will sell your program,

[31:33] right, which is the plain flight. They're selling TSA, airbags, take your shoes off,

[31:38] wear your mask, give vaccinated, don't get vaccinated. You know, Sid next to the person who

[31:42] far sexy on the plane, you're going to get your little peanuts. All of that. And they're like,

[31:46] yeah, but then you're going to get to mount people like, yeah, it's like, you got to sum

[31:49] out. You got to be talking about the trees and the wind and what's going to be like to feel

[31:53] and experience that, the status increase they will have amongst their peers as a result of this

[31:58] this decision. They're like, got it. Okay. And when we do the solidification, we typically will limit

[32:03] it to three main points. And I think it's just because human attention span isn't that good. So you

[32:07] probably do tons of stuff. We do tons of stuff. We're going to talk about three things, right?

[32:12] So I'm going to get more customers. I'm going to make it more and more. I'll get them by more times.

[32:15] That's it. Right. And these are the things that we're going to have to do. And we give a relevant

[32:19] analogy to those things. So, you know, we just, you want to have a quick anecdote that's 30 seconds

[32:26] or less. So if I was selling a coaching program for whatever accountability might be one of my

[32:32] three things. And I'll be like, okay, well, and this would tie to whatever the thing they struggle

[32:37] within the past is like, you know, I stopped for stuff, but I didn't really get going or I started

[32:39] to like do it whatever, like, total in a stand. It's reasonable. What do they do to a whole

[32:43] job? And they're like, well, nothing. It's like, well, then that's not your fault. They didn't

[32:45] want to take kind of. Of course, you weren't successful. That's not that's not it. You know, right? So

[32:49] let me ask you a question. When you were a kid, did you, did you love brushing your teeth at night?

[32:53] And they were like, no, like, did you go, you know, they dragged you out of bed, you brush your teeth,

[32:58] right? And they kept doing that over and over every night. I got to do that. Could you do that?

[33:01] Do you brush your teeth and I was in a doll? They're like, oh, I mean, yeah, I'm not a fucking disgusting

[33:06] greeting. You're like, yeah. So what that was an example of is you did external accountability

[33:10] that turned into internal motivation. And that's exactly what we're going to do with you here in this

[33:14] program. Does that make sense? Great. We don't talk about fucking Zoom calls. You don't talk about

[33:17] so homework. We don't talk about hour. Like, once I made that, because that doesn't matter,

[33:21] they just want to know that something external is going to get them to do something internal forever.

[33:25] Yeah. So we give them an anecdote about that. And so this is important because this is the only

[33:29] thing the sales guy has to memorize besides obstacle programs. The rest of this is questions that

[33:34] they can always refer back to. All right. So for ramping up sales guys faster, question-based

[33:39] framework, not scripting. This is just my experience. It's easier to teach people. I haven't found

[33:44] in my experience. The superscripted stuff is best for like 20 minute, super high transactional sales.

[33:49] Like $200 sales in the last, but that's probably not what anyone here is selling. So for everyone

[33:54] else, question-based framework, kind of a diagnostic approach. We follow this. E is explaining

[33:58] with their concerns, which is like, got it? This is the thing. So I make sense. Would you be,

[34:04] would you be opposed to moving forward today? Because it sounds like a good fit. Then they're like,

[34:07] well, I wouldn't be a pleasable before today. And I'm like, great. And if for some reason they say,

[34:11] yes, what we do is we do the exact same thing every time, which we make some sort of

[34:15] concession, which is a bonus. And then we say fair enough, because all we're doing is concession,

[34:19] reciprocity fair enough. And people don't like to feel like they're not being fair. It's a very

[34:24] human thing. It's reciprocity super deep in us. And so someone's like, I don't know if I can do this.

[34:28] I'm like, how about a third this in? Yeah, three times. It's like, okay, I'm just got to be fair enough

[34:32] by now. Right. And so we explain whether they're concerns, which you guys probably already know,

[34:37] we've got spouse, Slack decision maker. You've got price. And you've got, uh, delay, which is I need

[34:43] to think about it anymore information. I got a sleep one, it whatever. And so for each of those,

[34:47] rather than give you the things that we would drill our sales teams on, uh, a decision maker

[34:52] close is going to adhere to the principles behind getting someone to understand past agreements,

[34:57] which is, does your spouse or business partner know that you are struggling with this? Yes.

[35:02] Do they want you to continue to struggle with this? No. Why would they be against you fixing

[35:07] something they already know you're struggling with? And they don't want you to keep struggling.

[35:10] So we're relying on the past agreements to go into the present and then we, they're like,

[35:14] I guess you're right. And then we usually will tag in a, hey, sometimes a better ask for forgiveness

[35:18] information fair enough. Great. And then we will close them. Yeah. That would be for a decision maker.

[35:22] For a, um, for a, uh, if it's by the way, if it's be to see, you can usually get away with,

[35:28] uh, what if they say no? And honestly, you'd be fucking, I still blows my mind.

[35:33] You're like, I probably do it anyways. You're like, let's do it. So, yeah, let's rock and roll.

[35:37] Like, but if it's business, if it's me to be, you can probably go past your parents.

[35:42] And then, uh, and then usually if you have some sort of guarantee or some sort of outclass of like

[35:45] three days or five days, if you, you know, get back in your business partners and usually we'll make a joke

[35:49] here. Hey, you get back in your business partners says, hey, man, I want you to be poor. I want

[35:52] your kids not to have anything. I want you live in the worst neighborhoods. I don't want you to have

[35:55] generational wealth. I want you to have just to pass on a spirit of poverty to all of the things that's

[36:00] that's that's spring, you know, fruit from your lines. If that's, if that's what your business partner

[36:03] says, like, totally understand and we'll just tear this up. But if he's like, not man, that sounds

[36:08] good. Then we'll rock and roll. Right? And if you does say that first thing, you have him give me a call

[36:13] and I'll talk to him. Fair enough? Great. There we go. So decision maker, we've got price, which is

[36:18] always anchored around value. This is usually more that you actually have to close on the sales

[36:24] guys, not the prospect. So we really wrote a few. We don't drill price stuff that much. We drill

[36:29] the sales team on their conviction. So does anyone here ever had like a client event and had all

[36:35] these people there to test them on yours and like your sales team was there? Yesterday. Right. Well,

[36:40] I'll bet you for the next couple weeks. You're closing percentages is going to be fucking sky high.

[36:45] I could tell you that when I had my brick and mortar gyms, I would do way out days, which is like

[36:48] when challenges the stuff would end and people would be losing weight and crying and all that stuff.

[36:52] I would stack as many sales appointments as like possibly could, while the way I'll travel.

[36:56] Yeah. Because my sales team was just watching people just hit their goal and hit their goal.

[36:59] They're like, dude, just sign up. Like they would even go through a pitch. They're like,

[37:03] I mean, what do you have to like just sign up like it? Yeah. And they reak of conviction.

[37:07] And the funniest thing in the world for everybody here is like understanding the theory behind

[37:10] sales is that you have a person who has conviction and then you have another person who has no conviction.

[37:17] And everyone knows that sales is a transference of conviction. Right.

[37:20] As a transference of belief and the bridge of that is trust. Right. And so the real intention is that we must

[37:27] make sure that a sales person actually believes and you'd be amazed at how many times they don't really

[37:31] believe in the product. Yeah. And one of the things that is important to understand is that it's not

[37:35] a binary. It's not do my sales guys believe in my product. Yeah. It is not much. How much do they believe in my

[37:40] products? Hey Alex. Yeah. This is epic. Okay. And you know what I love?

[37:48] I said I was like in a talk about this and you said, now I want to talk about that and I said,

[37:50] well, let's do both. You've done a really good job of doing what I wanted to talk about. So

[37:55] I like talking to sales. No, I get it. In a minute, what I'd love to do, let's just do the third

[38:00] objection to kind of close the triangle here. And then let's do a quick Q&A and let's talk about

[38:05] scaling filling. Is that cool? Yeah. So last one's I need to think about it. And so for most people,

[38:11] they don't know how to make you a good decision. They're afraid of making mistakes. And so we like

[38:17] to be as direct as possible, which is like let's talk about the best case worst case. This is what

[38:21] happens. This is what happens. Because tell me what your deepest darkest period is, right? Is that I take

[38:25] your money and XYZ that you think is going to happen isn't going to happen. But not only that,

[38:30] let's be real. Your husband thinks you're a failure because you spent money again. Right? Your friends

[38:34] are like, oh, here she is again. In our here he is, make another fucking business program thing. He

[38:38] is going to make money. Right? That's what the real pain is. Right? It's not the money. He's sure.

[38:42] But the thing is, is the money is going to come back. Because you're not going to go home.

[38:45] Listen, even if you do go home, I've got guys who live in outside my building for 25 years. Not starving.

[38:49] It's still good. So you really have nothing to worry about. But the real thing here is that we need to

[38:54] make this decision. So do you know how to make the we have a decision making framework here. Can I share

[38:58] it with you? Sure. So first question yesterday, now, do you think that we can help you solve this problem?

[39:03] Yes. Yeah. Cool. Do you like me or do you want to work with us as a company? Yes. Cool. Do you have

[39:11] access to the amount of money that is required to start? Yes or no? If it's yes, yes, yes, let's rock and roll.

[39:16] Because the end of the day, you don't need more time. You need more information to make a decision.

[39:20] And I'm going to restore a certain information. And I can do this all day.

[39:22] It feels like you've done this once or twice. This is a, I'm making a business program.

[39:26] I understand. Okay, she'll just want to know the R in close up is.

[39:32] Is green force the decision? That's a great way. So close was actually my, my acronym for like two

[39:37] years when I was teaching. And then after really looking at it as the beginning of the customer journey,

[39:42] yeah, we transition to having instead of a hand off, it is a hand shake between sales and customer success.

[39:49] And so the point here is that the moment they close, the moment the card goes through,

[39:54] they're going to have immediate remorse. And so our goal is to totally reinforce the decision,

[39:59] personalize video from the next person. You're like, hey, just got off the phone's John. I

[40:03] hear it. And this is an important point from operational standpoint. It's like, hey, I heard you're trying

[40:06] to retire a wife. I think that's amazing. I hear that we're trying to get to $10,000 a month. I think

[40:10] you've been a blow that away from you. Such a good job. So just to give you heads up tomorrow,

[40:14] it's me, Tammy, forgot to introduce myself. And we're going to be walking to the xyz so that we

[40:18] can help you get your wife retired as fast as possible. Cool. Really excited to see you. I sent you an

[40:22] email with all the details to see you tomorrow. Right. And so now they're like, okay, this is a legit company.

[40:28] I just got, you know, I've just got off the phone, you know, the phone thing and an hour later I

[40:32] get this thing. I'm like, okay, this is cool. I feel good about this decision. And that's what we want

[40:35] them to say. I feel good about this decision. And we're like great. And then it decreases the the the

[40:40] cold feet and walk out some backups. I'm like, I should. It's a good job, Tammy. I'd love to know

[40:45] one thing you learned, one thing you loved any full lot of questions. Let's do it right now.

[40:48] And then we're going to switch gears. So one thing you want to kind of nugget you stole

[40:53] and any questions you've got lots of exploding head emojis. What's the comp at each level?

[40:59] Let's scroll up the emphasis. I wouldn't, I wouldn't give you hard and fast, but I'll give you

[41:03] a OTE which is on target earnings. Cool. And that's what, that's also what we present at the sales

[41:07] guys. So this is the number of opportunities you get in. If you're doing 100, and the nice thing is that

[41:12] here's the cool thing without them is that it's reliable. Adds you've got some days you got more,

[41:16] some just got less, maybe this campaign team maybe it's not, outbound. It starts with a constant.

[41:20] You make 100 calls. Yeah. And everything after that is, it's just four million. Right?

[41:25] 100 calls means means we should get two people to show, two people to show, we should get five of

[41:30] those iterations to get one deal and so forth. And so if you're getting this many appointments per week,

[41:36] this is relatively the amount that you should be closing by percentage. Right? If you close less

[41:40] than this, so if somebody's closing, let's say 25% or less, they get up, they get bumped down triple

[41:45] right? And so for us, the guys who were the bigs, they make the on the like if they're doing great,

[41:52] they make like 225. Yeah, do you know the R target earnings? A loose range, that's probably the one

[41:56] 50 to say one's going into 220 is the range there for for triple A or the SDS, they make 60-ish

[42:05] and that's a much tighter range. Probably like 55 to 70, you know I mean like, but I don't think

[42:09] anyone would say this, it's like 55 to 65, it's a 10-year range. And then the BDRs are like around four

[42:17] year. Helpful. So you can see how they're shooting for that. Yeah, what they are. Yeah, see it.

[42:22] And what they're like how long does it take? The answers right in front of them on the right. That's

[42:26] a long distance. Yeah, what I love about this is you're thinking in quick achievable wind levels and

[42:32] Maria just said love eight weeks probably the same for our clients. I don't know think about.

[42:40] Yeah, Jackson says where are you finding these people? The homeless guys out the back for the

[42:43] filter that before. Yeah, I can't believe one of the big bottlenecks in the business was finding that

[42:49] and I found out it took me I made a whole YouTube video about this, but basically my team was

[42:54] screening ways you hard for BDRs and my sales manager didn't know. And so we're like no no just

[43:03] let them all in and we'll see how they do because the cost because it takes two days to ramp them up

[43:09] and we don't really have any cost per lead. Yeah, besides the the data script which is not that hard.

[43:14] And so we just let them prove themselves because it doesn't really cost us anything to have them

[43:17] more pleased. Yeah, love it. Yuri's asking, did you consider called app and email instead of called

[43:23] Yeah, I'm pretty sure phone burner has follow up email and text thing that goes with it, but

[43:28] I'll be honest with you guys like the phones are the thing that that drive it 75% of the

[43:32] comes from the phones. Yeah, I love it. Okay, so Alex, when I said hey, could you do a thing about a thing

[43:38] and you said yes, you said I'd rather talk about what I thought I would share with you guys if

[43:44] that's okay with you is a couple of the kind of key lessons I've learned in this process.

[43:49] So I started this process because I was in a tremendous amount of pain, right? And I ran out of

[43:54] future. I couldn't see a world where I want to continue to do this for the long haul, right? And I

[43:59] think I heard this from Sharan and I love it. Is that operators get burned out? Business owners get rich.

[44:04] And I was still seeing you. And that was the thing. As much as I felt like I wasn't doing anything.

[44:09] Now two years ago, I was 100% doing things. But this year as we transitioned out,

[44:15] I went from just making decisions to not really make just to just reviewing decisions, which is kind of

[44:20] what we're doing now. So the reason that we got the offers that we did in my opinion is because we

[44:28] fixed the house and when you fixed the house that you're trying to sell, I went over try to sell

[44:32] house and like you fixed all the things that they're wrong with it and you looked at the house

[44:35] and were like why are we leaving this place? This place is awesome. They were done that. Yeah.

[44:40] Well, the biggest lesson that I feel like I've taken from this and I have two pages of lessons

[44:45] that I took, I documented through this process is that you only have one outcome. You have to sell

[44:52] the business. But it doesn't mean you have to have another requirement. And you can sell the business

[44:56] from yourself to yourself. Yeah, you're also off to your new self. And I also got a greater understanding

[45:03] of how the debt system works. So if someone's going to buy your business for a big amount of money,

[45:07] they're not actually going to pay for your business. Right. They're going to put 30% down like you

[45:11] do for a house and then they're going to get a bank to to to finance the rest. Right.

[45:17] You have a house that you own 100% cash. You can go to the bank and get the 70% mortgage on your house

[45:23] and just take the money in the US at least tax-free. Jackson's nodding. He would know the Aussie.

[45:29] He's nodding. He's like, yes, the firm is. Yeah. It's so the point is is that in my mind two and a

[45:36] half years ago, the only possible outcome that I could do to get out of pain was to sell. And the

[45:40] thing that I had to sell was unselable. And so the thing that we build has to be sellable. That's

[45:48] just my conclusion. It has to be sellable or you'll eventually burn out. And so if you make

[45:54] it sellable, then it actually sits as an asset on your personal network balance sheet. And it

[45:59] continues to provide cash flow. I had so many stories that the story of the sale for me was like,

[46:06] I need a big sale to be legit. So if you guys may laugh at that, you're like, you do an 85

[46:10] million year, but in my head I was like, well, and then I had a friend who's like, dude, you've already

[46:13] sold six companies. I was like, yeah, but they weren't like his biggest this. And he's like, you really think

[46:17] that matters. And I was like, huh. And then it was like, what about the story of the money, right,

[46:24] about the increase in that work? Well, here's an interesting one for you. So you have a hundred

[46:29] million dollar style, right? Everyone talks about it. It's so amazing. Well, most of the times is not

[46:36] a hundred million dollars, right? What it is is they'll probably give you, you know, 60 million

[46:41] upfront. And then you'll have a $10 million seller note that you find it for five years. And then

[46:49] you'll have, you'll have a urnout, right, for another 20 million that if you had x, y, and z over the

[46:55] next year or two, right, or it, urnout's going to be as long as they want, right? And you're going to

[47:01] roll another 10% in equity, right? And so almost done, that's 100, it becomes 60. But what if there's more?

[47:08] So now we've got 60 million. Well, you probably have some bonuses that you want to give to your staff.

[47:12] You're going to have a broker that you'll probably have to pay through a 4% too. So let's do it.

[47:16] So a 4% of 60 now we're now to to 57, right? And I'll just wrap in some of the bonuses on top of that,

[47:24] depending on how you're, your equity structure, your 100% whatever, then you have your capital

[47:29] gains tax, you have an escrow fee. So capital gains for us in the States, at least is 20.

[47:33] So now we have 20% off of the, you know, let's say 55 after the escrow, that would be,

[47:39] actually, to size that big, it'd probably be more like 50 after escrow. 20% of that would be 40 million.

[47:45] So now your $100 million sale is 40 million bucks. It's not as cool, right? At least for me,

[47:53] like hearing how it, how it would break down. And so I've tried to be as transparent as possible,

[47:57] because like there's the, there's the story of the sale that we tell ourselves.

[48:02] And there's the reality of the sale, because here's the second part of it. I talked about the money side,

[48:06] but what about the attention headspace energy sack? Because that was another story. I was like,

[48:11] well, if I sell, then I'll be able to go do stuff that I really, you know, I'll get on this,

[48:14] attention back and all the stuff, right? Well, one, the amount of stuff that wants you to do is

[48:20] going to be directly to work for how much stuff you're doing now. So if you want to sell the business,

[48:23] you got to do it in a way that you're not doing anything. And if you're not doing anything,

[48:26] then why sell the fucking business? Yeah. And so for me, I told myself the story,

[48:31] but the reality was, they wanted me to shout for quarterlys and be available for the occasional,

[48:36] like strategic, like, hey, can we touch base about something? Which is exactly what I currently do.

[48:42] Yeah. So then it's no longer, so it's not a question of money, because if you're selling for that amount

[48:47] of money, you've probably been making money for a while, right? So it's not going to material

[48:51] the change of net worth unless you're in software, which gets to different, you know,

[48:54] okay, but for most of us here in South service businesses, there's some kind, you're probably

[48:57] pretty high margin, pretty high cash flow, and you probably have a decent amount of money. After you get

[49:01] this kind of downstream impact of what's actually going to be added to your net worth, then the question

[49:06] is, what am I going to take with the 40 million and buy that's going to create me, because if you're

[49:11] selling for 100, you're probably doing 15 million in profit, right? So what am I going to go buy with

[49:16] 40 million that I can get $15 million of profit every year from that I don't have to do anything for

[49:22] right? And so I had the story of what the sale was going to mean to me in terms of my reputation,

[49:27] which was completely living in other people's eyes, which was useless, and a relevant and not true.

[49:31] I had the story of money, which is this is going to be a big change in my life, but when I looked

[49:37] at all the numbers, I was like, this will change nothing at all in other. And no, like, I have

[49:41] nothing, because unless you get into another stratosphere of wealth, like, it's nothing's going to change,

[49:47] right? So then it goes into the energy and headspace. I was like, okay, well, shit, I'm doing

[49:51] the same thing before as I am now. And so the story of what we think it is versus the reality of what it is.

[49:58] And so the biggest thing that I feel like has been my biggest takeaway from this is that when I've

[50:05] looked at and I have a big thing on private equity lessons that are really cool too, but it's probably

[50:10] running out of time. I learned from the guy who lives at Buckman. So the guy literally lives right here.

[50:16] He does 3.8 billion a year in revenue. He owns his company 100% outright.

[50:22] And he does 26% net margins. Probably hell. That means he took $935 million in income last year.

[50:30] The secret to his success, he said, I've been doing the same thing for four years. And what years?

[50:35] And so what I feel like I continue to witness is that the wealthiest people in the world,

[50:41] and I'm still into this from Sharon, is they buy in the bill, and then they refinance.

[50:46] So you don't need to sell. And the only reason that you would sell is because you think the

[50:50] party's over. You think that this thing is no longer going to be a thing anymore. Long-term.

[50:55] Yeah. But if I make a bet that gyms are going to be here in 10 years, which I do think gyms are

[51:00] going to be here in 10 years, right? Or your business, whatever that the space is going to be there in 10 years.

[51:05] Well, then what's the reason for selling? So and I got this from my closest friend because he was like,

[51:10] what problem were you solving? And I was like, well, when I started this process, I was in a ton of

[51:14] pain. He was like, okay, I really you're paying down. I was like, well, what do you think is going to

[51:18] happen wholesale? He's like, he's like, fuck the sale. He's like, match the conditions. He's like, what is

[51:24] your life look like after the sale? Taptically. Yeah. Is there a way that we can make your your life look

[51:31] this way before the sale and keep the damn thing? Yeah. And so then we started looking at everyone

[51:37] can we match the conditions? And so if you can do that, then we build the thing instead of a really

[51:43] high paying CEO job, we now have an asset that is sellable and can carry debt on our balance sheet,

[51:49] income tax free that we can then use to go invest in the other stuff that we want and ask the company

[51:54] grows, it pays off the debt and you have the thing that you're getting the debt, who's going to

[51:57] grow as well, if that's what you want. All right, dude. I got two thoughts in my head. I just want to

[52:05] throw them to you and you can do something with them or not. The two things I see happen a lot in

[52:12] boardroom is people hit their number. It's not 100 million often, but it's like the dream

[52:19] they've now hit it and they're like, well, talk what they hold away do now. So that's a really common

[52:24] thing. And then the other thing, talking about exit not exit is really interesting, but one of

[52:29] things you've done to get exitable is to take the name off the door. Yeah, totally. So the name

[52:38] off the door, I just want to prepare everyone is like a three year process. So it takes a lot more

[52:43] time than you think it will. This is I will just share the things I work for us. All right. So

[52:48] we just said we have no YouTube strategy, honestly. Alex just likes making videos in his great

[52:52] teacher. Yes, that's the big deal. Thank you, Lila, I'm packing this strategy. Yep, that is the strategy.

[52:59] So first thing is we edified customers into specialists and the bikini wants here is that we don't

[53:05] make generalists because generalists means they can replace you. And you actually either have the

[53:09] problem of having another face that's not yours or you have the risk of that face walking, but

[53:14] either way, it's either a face that doesn't make it sellable, which is the same weakness, or you

[53:17] face that becomes the threat to the business, right? Either way, it's not good. And so we make siloed

[53:22] experts, which we call subject matter experts, that specialized in specific things. So you might have

[53:26] somebody who's really get it sales. Somebody who's really good at lead nurtures. So we usually

[53:29] get an ad bonds. And we usually get it cages. Somebody who's whatever the thing is, so that you can

[53:34] have people tag those clients and they become kind of the the the customer support, but like with

[53:38] special specialization. Beyond that, you take some of the better customers you have. You want to

[53:43] exit their business and just love your brand and you say, hey, what did you cool if all you did was

[53:46] talk about this all day? And I like to do this is all I want to talk about anymore. I don't like

[53:48] dancing anymore. I want to talk about dance, right? See, Glenn. And what if we just helps you just help

[53:55] our clients better? And then they become the head of product, right? Because you think about the

[53:58] things that we're probably doing. You're probably an expert of some sort. Do you need to replace

[54:02] the product's expertise? So first you got to get a person and then you get the process. The process

[54:06] around this is called the beta process. Every single product I can be from that we talk to,

[54:10] love this process so you can write it down. I actually learned this from management consultant.

[54:14] The way that it works is that if we need to solve a problem. So there's always a problem to be solved.

[54:19] Right? All these, that's your customers. There's plenty of problems, right? So ask them for these

[54:24] have to solve these that problems your clients have. Problems. Yes. That we took them out. Yes.

[54:29] And then they can upvote the ones that are the most salons. Then you take the ones that are the

[54:33] most that are that are plaguing the most people. And then you say, hey, who here is doing really well with this?

[54:38] And then you get and you draw, draw a line. And ideally it's bending on the client's eyes. For us,

[54:43] we look at the top one percent. So you've got a thousand locations, top one percent is 10 people.

[54:48] So I want a group of 10 to 20 that are in the top echelons. So cut the percentage

[54:52] to everyone to get 10 to 20. And then we do a round table. And so the benefit to them is that they

[54:56] get to kind of get a bonus mastermind with you for free and exchange for sharing all their secrets.

[55:00] Yep. What we do then, and this is the qualitative process, is that you write down everything

[55:04] that each of them says. Step two is that you reorganize the notes and find the common

[55:10] commonalities. And the point here is not to do all of the things they do, but you do the things that

[55:15] all of them do. Okay. And so a lot like the list that I had for reducing turn was like 180 items

[55:20] between all the guys. But then one thing that the five things that all of them did is the only five

[55:25] that I took to make the solution. And so once you have that, you can solidate the solution.

[55:29] And then you take the guys where the bottom 10 percent and some middle guys. And you say, hey,

[55:34] I have now productized the solution. And you deliver it the same way you would to your customers,

[55:38] which is your portal. Well, you don't do anything as soon as you did that it would fuck up the results.

[55:42] You say, I need you to go through this and we're going to report back in 30 days.

[55:45] Right? And you can sit, you know, have a cadence with them. You know, once you're twice a week,

[55:47] whatever. You then measure the results. Here's what's cool about this. One is, if it works,

[55:54] you just have something that delivers tons of value. And you didn't have to generate it,

[55:57] a process generated it, which means it's not you. You're not the guru, you're not the face,

[56:01] a process drives the innovation. Yep. The second thing is if it doesn't work,

[56:06] you still report it because every entrepreneur would love to know failed tests. Yeah.

[56:10] I would love to know if this had line worked at this one. Even if it didn't, I want to know

[56:13] it's then I don't want to try it. And so it still provides value, even if it doesn't work,

[56:18] because you proved it didn't work. So I just want to share that with you because if somebody

[56:21] guys do experiments and they didn't work, it's fairly. So that's on the product side. Right?

[56:28] On the marketing side, we slowly introduced other people in the ads until eventually it was just

[56:36] that in the ads. Right? And then additionally, we obviously started the app out team so that

[56:41] we had multiple channels. So there was like name was the one issue which we saw by getting

[56:46] the out of the end bound and then channel dependence with the other issue which we saw through

[56:51] Apple. Right? And so those were the, you know, there's are the two solutions on that. Now,

[56:56] I want to share something that I think is more important than everything that I have said. So maybe

[57:00] you can unsure the thing for a moment. When, when, when, when, when, I'm sure the things that

[57:07] are working for the app on team, you can't do it. Like you can't do it. Like if you get to a certain

[57:14] point, if you're a 10 million or 15 million, like you can't do it. You need other people. And you,

[57:19] you can't hire people with the intention of training them to do the thing. It's not, hey, we need

[57:24] to build an outbound team together. It's, I know that you built two outbound teams for similar type

[57:30] products as many. I need you to do the same thing here. Here's some really favorable upside potential

[57:34] for you. And I need you to build it from here. And I'll give you all the leeway in the world.

[57:39] I mean, incredibly patient as, as long as I see progress. Yeah. So I have very low patients if I see no

[57:45] progress. If I see progress, you can go as long as you want, as long as you're making progress,

[57:49] because I know we will eventually get there. And so I think that if you use that as a frame of mind,

[57:54] that we're not looking for people who know how to run, but we're looking for people who have already

[57:57] run an Olympic goal and what to run another one. Yeah. And I'm telling you, if you find the players,

[58:03] you will be able to build something significantly bigger. And this was a breakthrough that took me way too

[58:07] long to learn. And it sounds stupid because it's so tried and overstated. But like you need to find

[58:12] champions. And you got to pay him well. And it will be worth it. And there's a book, I don't know if

[58:17] Layla put it in there, the mode. But there's a book called The Motive, which is a one-sit read. It's 130 pages

[58:24] with big text. And it fundamentally changed me as an entrepreneur. And I really think every one

[58:33] should read it because you can read it in an hour and a half. And it will change the way you see

[58:36] operating a business. Because at the end of the day, it's just an assembly of people. If you want it to

[58:41] be a business. If it's you with a thousand helpers, it's not a business. It's just a really high paying job.

[58:46] And so you got to get people who can do it. I know it sounds stupid and it's obvious, but like

[58:51] that's the belief is that I was stuck at mid 30 million for three years. And I had Mark Ford who wrote

[58:57] Ready Fire Aim, right his book. And he said the thing that you get stuck at 30, and I had like

[59:03] skipped the chapter where he had 30 million as a breakdown. And he said, if you're stuck here, it's

[59:07] because you're the only one that's you're the jujur. You're the steam. You're the fuel behind the

[59:12] growth of this thing. But at a certain point, there's only so much that one person can push.

[59:17] You get the fourth level of infrastructure in the business. And they don't know who you want.

[59:21] They don't know your vision. They don't know how you do things. Because they're so far,

[59:25] they're so far three levels. You're okay. Fourth, it's an organization. It's beyond trial.

[59:32] And so I was going somewhere with that. When we hit 30 and I read the book,

[59:38] he was like, you need to find other people who can own their own P&Ls and become

[59:42] entrepreneurs within your company. And what happens is it's become to shift from being a business

[59:47] to being a conglomeration. And so if you think about Amazon, they're not Amazon's on a business.

[59:52] It's a business of businesses. It's a collection of businesses that sort of purpose.

[59:56] And so I had to shift my thinking in terms of how mine worked to we have a number of business

[60:02] units that operate off of one shared spoke of shared services. We've got IT HR legal finance,

[60:08] all in the middle. And then we've got profit drivers that drive revenue across the business units.

[60:14] And the people who drive those are responsible and compensated based on the growth of their

[60:18] business line or their product line. And so then you get people who can start making 300 grand,

[60:23] 400 grand a year, 500 grand a year, if they crush it. And they should, because otherwise,

[60:28] they'll just start their own version of your business. And so if you can give them that,

[60:31] you can attract the entrepreneurs who want to drive growth are really good operators.

[60:36] They just have a little bit less risk, you know, tolerance. Yeah, that big.

[60:43] So that's that's that really goes for any of them. So like, outbound, if you're going

[60:46] outbound or you're like, man, no, can never mark it like me. There's somebody who's better than

[60:49] you. Yeah, there's totally is. It's bad for the ego and good for the business.

[60:57] So can we talk for a minute about about, I don't know what the would have. Post exit, post exit.

[61:04] Not even post exit, but like post, I've hit my number. What, your unboard, what's my new role?

[61:10] Yeah. Yeah, who am I? What do I do? That stuff? Just for a couple minutes. Yeah. So I mean,

[61:18] a video on YouTube about this, how passive income was overrated. And it was because we had completely

[61:22] replaced ourselves in the business. And it was still making a lot of money. And then we started

[61:28] acquiring other pieces of businesses and we're not in those to continue to cash flow on a

[61:31] like, what do we do? Like, we have nothing to do all day. And so I think what I messed up is that

[61:36] I continue to pursue freedom, right? Because that's what all of us here, at least I did,

[61:40] is freedom was the goal, right? And I thought that it was freedom from work when,

[61:48] when in reality what I should have done was freedom to do things that I wanted. And for me,

[61:53] I want to work. And it took me a year to give myself permission to work again.

[61:58] Because I always thought that if the business was not on me, it wasn't a business and I was doing

[62:02] something wrong. And that was a story that I was telling myself. And I love working. And I think that

[62:09] if all of us achieved the levels that we have right now, it's because we love working. We love doing this.

[62:14] And we still have this dream of this exit in our minds. But it's not, it's not true.

[62:23] And you wake up the next day and all you do is, you know, and there's just another

[62:28] blank of money there and you're like, well, fuck, I mean, you can only go out to so many

[62:32] nice dinners and nice restaurants and nice shows. And at some point, I got to do some shit. And so

[62:36] like, I would say that you don't need to go through it because I spent the last month, nine months

[62:40] doing nothing. You mean, go out on my mind and wondering why I even existed. And then it just

[62:44] eventually gave myself permission to just do the things that I like doing. And it just happens to be

[62:47] that it makes money great. And for me, and again, I got this from Shron because it's been,

[62:52] it was so good. But like, the things that light me up are buying and doing is it's expansion.

[62:58] And so, you know, if we end up selling, I don't know, again, it's the office morning, maybe, maybe not.

[63:05] But I do know that whatever it is, it's going to be, the decision will be aligned with what I am

[63:11] building next. And if I think that keeping this will help me build that better, faster stronger,

[63:17] then I will keep it. If I don't think that, and I'll tell you this is, when I was contemplating the sale,

[63:23] I could not see past the decision because it was an unmay decision. It was like black.

[63:28] It was like, I lost my vision. I couldn't see past this unmay decision because it was this variable,

[63:32] this huge fork in the road in my life. I immediately, and I shit you not. I immediately knew what

[63:38] we needed to do to grow the other company to 30 million in EBITDA. And what we're going to do for the

[63:42] new company because I'm still building the next company, I no matter what. And so, I think that the

[63:47] season that I just went through and I feel like it took me two and a half years, was transitioning

[63:52] from CEO to owner. And it took a lot longer and it was a lot more emotionally difficult,

[63:59] a lot more emotionally difficult than I expected. Why? Identity. You know, um, I mean,

[64:06] Laila had a conversation with our team, Mr. There, like it's so nice that you guys are going.

[64:11] No, I don't think I told that story. It's just like, did you say that to them? Well, they said that to you.

[64:15] No, they said it to us. They're like, I don't want to offend you guys. Sorry. I thought Laila was like,

[64:19] I'm sorry, I'm not having you guys in my life. Sorry. I just thought it was interesting because

[64:24] it's, you know, I think both Alex and I had always pride that ourselves on, you know, for me,

[64:28] it was like, I have to be the example. I have to be working my ass off doing more than everybody else

[64:33] so that they, you know, because they're all a players. And so I want them to see them doing the same.

[64:37] Yeah. And I was talking to one of our guys who's really stepped up and he's one of the, you know,

[64:42] one of the highest ranked people in the company. And a check in with him once a month, rather than,

[64:48] you know, the, because he's not the COO or CEO. And I said, like, how can I support you? How can

[64:54] me now? It's helped. You know, just want to know it didn't the call. He said, I've really honest with you. And I was like,

[64:58] yeah, he said, it's really nice not having you guys around. He's like, yeah, he's like, you know,

[65:06] everyone feels so much more creative. You know, they have to be way more self-reliant and all of

[65:12] some just little step up so much more since you guys stepped out. And so we're just growing so much

[65:16] as a team, we're so much stronger. And I was like, Hawk, man, like everything that you do to get to like 90

[65:22] percent of the finish line, the last 10 percent requires you to do the complete opposite. Yeah, that's

[65:27] fascinating. So everything about every entrepreneur, every level of entrepreneurship based on my

[65:32] object, my personal experience is been it's, it's relinquishing control or at least the perception of control.

[65:38] And so, you know, when you're, when you're at zero to a million, you're giving a huge post-pursac

[65:43] Alex says, he's what I'd love to do. And I think you're going there, but I just want to,

[65:46] yeah, I want to mind melt. So let's go. We've got this journey and we've got the, you know,

[65:52] the zero to one. And then we've got the one to what the next jump is it? 10. 10. Perfect.

[65:59] And I think it's like 30 to 50, it kind of depends on the other company. Perfect. And then we'll

[66:04] go up and there. A lot of the people on this, on this line right now are kind of in this space

[66:08] and we've got some in it in this space, but can you just do like top three for this space right here?

[66:17] Yeah, to give past the million you have to give up everything with the film.

[66:22] So a customer success for the film. Right. Yeah, exactly. Life for the film. You have to give up your film.

[66:28] Hey, hey, you're like, oh, I mean, that's the, that's the, the, the, the, the

[66:34] the keep art. You're also giving up if you're going to want to 10, you can't sell anymore, right? You need

[66:38] someone, you need a team of people who are selling maybe half so it's, you have to not only be able

[66:43] to sell, you have to teach people to sell, you have to know how to recruit salespeople, you have to know how to

[66:46] manage salespeople, you have to know how to send salespeople and continue to get them performing.

[66:53] Right. And that's a different skill, right? We know how to sell. How do you go, like, I close these

[66:57] people so easily and no one else can sell like me. It's like it feels good, but you're still

[67:01] way poor than somebody's got 20 sales guys close and bored. So like, just get over it. Like,

[67:06] there are people who are better than you are closing because all they're going to do all day,

[67:09] it's closed. You still run a business. Yeah. So you got to stop selling. It's my opinion that 10 to 10 to 30

[67:15] is you have to give up the marketing. You have to really have to get beyond that. And then

[67:21] at going 50 plus 30 to 50 plus it's like, you have to give up the leading, which is difficult.

[67:27] Hmm. Right. And the zero to one, I'm just off road in there for fun is like, you got to stop doing

[67:33] then you go to managing and then you go to leading and then you go to decision making.

[67:37] And so you can say leading and decision making, decision making is above leading.

[67:41] That's kind of the ultimate. I would say exit is that people are making decisions on your behalf.

[67:45] Oh, my bad. I got this no more. Alex, would you say for 50 plus? This is what I was thinking.

[67:49] I was being a representative like the Saturday and I think for 50 plus you go from being the leader

[67:55] of the company to you lead like the one sole leader, but you're actually just the resource.

[68:00] Yeah. So you're just a guy. You're the advisor. Yeah. You provide capital and you provide

[68:05] connections, network vendors. That's what like P does. That's what, you know, the big guys do.

[68:10] Yeah. This is great. So can I just say something to cap this, Ruffwick?

[68:14] Yeah. So if you're stuck right now, you have to think, what am I holding onto that? I need to give

[68:20] up. Right question. When you're giving away control, I'm not saying, okay, well, I'm not going to be involved

[68:26] in sales anymore. It's like, no, you have to learn how to put a good leader in there who knows training

[68:30] systems, who knows how to recruit, who knows how to hire, and who's that to send, you know,

[68:33] it's going to keep culture and build a team that can that can work together, right? Those are a lot of

[68:39] attributes. And you know, your skill is how to find that person because that's each one of the skills

[68:44] we get the next skill. You have to learn how to close. You got to learn how to teach other people

[68:47] right? Then once you have other people close, you got to learn how to teach lots of people

[68:50] to close and maintain them. Then you got to learn how to recruit a sales manager who knows how to do

[68:54] that. Right. And so each of those are kind of the levels and they also mirror if you think about it,

[68:58] they mirror the levels of organization in the chart. Right. If you're doing it, then there's,

[69:04] there's, it's just you. If you're managing it's one, right? If you're managing a manager, it's two.

[69:09] Right. If you're not leading, you're leading people who have business units, right? It's, it's, it's

[69:15] three, right? And so, and then finally, you know, you're, you're advising and you're letting

[69:19] other leaders lead directors who have managers and customers. And so right now, I think this is

[69:26] our fifth level of hierarchy within the organizations. And so they now function as assets that produce

[69:34] the many individuals. A million percent. This is so great.

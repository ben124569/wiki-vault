[00:00] I'm going to show you how to grow your business so fast this year that it makes your accountant nervous

[00:05] And maybe you're not growing as fast as you want right now and it's probably because you're trying to fix a problem that might not actually exist

[00:10] And so most businesses have one of two core problems and they don't know which one they have and so I'm going to show you how to identify which one of the two you have and how to fix it

[00:18] I'm Alex Ramosi, I'm an actress and com a portfolio of companies that generate north of 200 plus million a year as of 2024

[00:24] So whenever I look at a business I always want to understand this one triage question up front which is is this a business that is supply constraint or is this a business that's demand constraint

[00:34] So here's the big idea you can either have two few customers or two little capacity but never both at the same time

[00:40] And so how do you know which problem you have?

[00:42] So demand problem means that you have space but not enough customers like a restaurant without empty tables or a calendar with open slots or you know product sitting on shelves

[00:51] You build it but people aren't coming so supply problem would be different it means that you have customers but not enough capacity

[00:57] So you have waiting list you have to turn people away or you can't make products fast enough you can take on new clients

[01:02] They're coming in, but you can't serve them all

[01:05] So how do you know which problem you have and so here's the simple test if you double your ad budget tomorrow or you double your outreach or your double your content

[01:12] Would you be able to double your sales or would you just create a mess that you couldn't even handle?

[01:16] So if you create a mess then you have a supply problem if it would double your sales then you have a demand problem

[01:21] And so the difference between businesses that grow in those that don't isn't just the hard work but it's working hard on the right problem

[01:26] And so as Warren Buffett says there's nothing worse than doing well with something that shouldn't be done at all

[01:31] So I'm going to give you a number of businesses that are constrained and give you some examples and then you need to figure out which category you think it's in supply or demand

[01:40] So as we dive into these examples, I'm going to give you some obvious ones and I'm going to give you some that are a little bit trickier

[01:45] Now the good news is that even if it's an obvious constraint, it doesn't make the problem any less painful and the solutions any less applicable to your business

[01:53] Because if you're in a supply constraint or a demand constraint, it absolutely is taking up all your attention is where all the pain in your life is coming from

[01:59] And so I'm going to break down the different strategies we can use for different types of businesses that are in each of these situations

[02:03] So I'm even the first one

[02:04] So think about a consultant who's completely booked so full schedule three months ahead working 60 hours a week always stressed out

[02:10] You have to spite all the work his or her income has stopped growing

[02:14] Right, so what does he do with this little free time?

[02:16] Well, he makes more content he runs more ads and he tries to get more leads

[02:20] He's trying to fix the demand problem that he doesn't have

[02:23] So the truth of it is he doesn't have a marketing problem

[02:26] He has a supply problem that could also be a pricing problem

[02:30] So which is it? We'll dive in

[02:32] So you might think, wait, that's crazy

[02:34] I need more clients to make more money that consultant might think and this might be you too

[02:38] But what if he tries something different so he is three options?

[02:41] So number one is he can just raise his prices by a lot

[02:43] And so most people when they raise their prices to like I might add I literally had a phone call earlier today

[02:48] So when said they were going out a quarter like 25 cents to their shipping and they were like holding their breath

[02:52] I might throw at three dollars and see what happened

[02:55] Most people are so afraid of raising prices because they're afraid they're going to lose their customers

[02:59] But if you're in a supply constraint business, it is one of the primary pass fixing it

[03:03] So if you're going to do it raise your prices by a lot

[03:05] We're talking 50% 100% so singles doubles in terms of how much more you raise your prices

[03:10] The second thing he could do is create basically a change the service to delivery ratio

[03:14] So instead of having just one on one services that are being rendered he could do one to many

[03:18] Or one to small group right so he changes how many customers she can take on personally

[03:22] And the third is that he just hires and trains other consultants

[03:26] Right so he keeps the ratio the same but he just adds more head count to his business

[03:29] And so there's basically the three things that he can do to solve the supply constraint

[03:33] Now he might be afraid to raise prices that much and he might be like, oh my god, I'm losing my clients

[03:37] But what's actually going to happen? So let's play that so let's say about 30% of his clients leave

[03:42] But if he doubled his prices and 30% of his clients left he'd make more money while working with fewer people

[03:49] And so here's the double benefit of this is that number one he makes more and he services fewer

[03:56] So he also frees up time

[03:58] It literally kills two birds with one stone he literally makes more money and has more time

[04:02] Which is why if you want a supply constraint business pricing was one of the strongest levers that you should consider pulling

[04:06] And usually a lot more than you think you should and now here's the secondary the tertiary benefit of doing that

[04:11] Now that you have that extra time you actually have time to create even more capacity

[04:14] And so if you need to have time to say, okay, you know what I'm going to increase my service delivery ratio

[04:18] Right I'm going to figure out what tech I need to do so that I can expand how many people I can take on

[04:23] I'm going to create a training system so that I can bring on new consultants and I can bring them on faster so that they can start taking on clients for me

[04:29] And either those situations the net result would be he'd make more money per hour and bringing this extra leverage in would multiply that

[04:36] And so by doing this he's fixing the real problem which was supply not demand

[04:40] And so he could double his income working 15 fewer hours a week and then double it again after he has brought him more consultants or expanded the ratio

[04:48] And so the main lesson here is that sometimes the path the growth isn't more clients it might be better clients

[04:53] So if you have the opportunity instead of trying to work harder appropriately charged with the market is saying they want to pay you and you're the one getting in the way

[05:02] So that was a simple one. Let's rip it up a little bit. So second example think about a software company

[05:06] So if I just offer going to be that helps service businesses schedule appointments

[05:09] So CEO proudly shows off all the new features that they're building and they're like our products will be the best

[05:15] And they's like no one's can match us but looking at their numbers shows something very different right so people who try their product love it and customer stay a long time

[05:21] The product works great, but they're still not growing so what's the problem is it demand constraint or is a supply constraint?

[05:27] Well, it's demand constraint they spend only 5% of their money on marketing while their competitors spending 20 to 30%

[05:32] It's the amount of great product but almost nobody knows it exists their fighting against irrelevance and so they have a ding ding ding

[05:39] demand problem but they're putting all their money into the product and now this can be tricky because of course you need to continue doing for the product

[05:44] And if you keep improving the product you might get to a point where the word of mouth alone can bring you in more customers

[05:50] Now the big question mark on this one and I want to make a clear point here and this is something that I've it took me a long time to figure out

[05:56] Is that I've been on both polar extremes here where I'm like marketing is the only thing that matters everything else is wrong

[06:01] And on the other extreme it's like product is the only thing that matters and the product is good enough

[06:05] Then you shouldn't need marketing the asterisk is you need to have a product that the customers of that product have high surface area exposure to other people that could use that product

[06:17] So let me explain Facebook for example is for people and so if you talk to other people you have something that you can refer them to but if you're like I do IT consulting for Fortune 100 companies

[06:28] The likely that you're going to get like referrals from that I mean you can but it's not like you're going to get viral growth

[06:33] I mean for sure word of mouth is me a part of it, but you're probably going to have to go out and get business

[06:38] And so there is an element where at some point especially the more niche you are especially the more higher and you are the more you are going to likely be able to keep customers because your product's really good

[06:49] But it's not going to necessarily grow the business so if looking at the business from the constraints perspective we'd be like, okay

[06:55] Let's pull some resources cash flow talent from continuing to invest in the product where we currently have no one turning so like no one's leaving everyone loves it

[07:04] But the thing is is that we want more people in and so let's go get more customers again. I'm not saying make your product bad. I'm saying let that dog lie

[07:12] And then reallocate some resources so you can let more people know about the stuff because if the product is that good

[07:18] Then you might be able to just double the customers in just a few months without even changing the product and people continue to stay in pay

[07:24] And fundamentally we have this big misconception that the harder we work on something the better it necessarily is

[07:28] But oftentimes products get we worse through addition and so oftentimes you can improve a product a lot by just deleting things

[07:35] And from a service perspective you have a service business just letting the team work

[07:39] Right because the constant change oftentimes actually erodes the product quality and the service quality more than the incremental improvement

[07:46] You think this new change is going to create and so some of the best years of of different businesses that I've owned have been when I'm like not super involved with it because I've like hey I've already done the thing

[07:56] Let them just keep getting better at sales that the team get better at onboard. I think he may get better at customer success and just don't mess with it. Just let the natural improvement of humans improve the performance of the business

[08:06] So in this particular business the founder would likely take their free time and put all of it into getting more customers and they'd have to just figure out

[08:13] Am I going to run ads am I going to do outbound am I going to do affiliates am I going to make content?

[08:19] Which of these strategies am I going to use in order to get more people to the door?

[08:23] So let's walk through example number three. Let's say you're brick and mortar restaurant. You serve food. So imagine a two hour weights on Saturday

[08:29] But they're empty on a Tuesday afternoon same business different problems depending on how you look at it and more importantly when you look at it

[08:36] So this is a ply or demand constraint mmm a tricky one

[08:40] Honestly the answer is they're mispriced and because of that we actually they have enough capacity

[08:46] But it's not allocated to the right times and so in this business it's a little bit of both and the nice thing is is we can solve it

[08:52] So let's imagine the steak house. Let's just call the steak house loves marketing and it keeps saying we need more ads

[08:56] We need more specials we need more customers and so he's spending thousands on ads every single month

[09:00] But this is the twist on Saturday and Friday nights people are waiting 90 plus minutes for a table and they got to turn people away the door

[09:08] And so more marketing would just mean more angry people who got dressed up pulled up to the the restaurant they wanted to go to and can't get in

[09:15] So here's three different ways that we could solve this potential supply issue that only happens on certain days

[09:21] So number one is we could just raise prices on Friday and Saturday

[09:25] So you give a different menu for weekends than you do during weekdays and that extra increase could have a dramatic effect on the business

[09:32] Restaurants typically run lower margins than most businesses. Let's just say they run 10% margins a 20% price increase would triple the profit on those two days

[09:41] But here's where it gets kind of nasty. Well if those two days Friday and Saturday were half the revenue of the business is being generated

[09:47] Then you want in a half x the profit of the business just from increasing the prices in those two days

[09:51] But what are some of the downstream effects that happened from that?

[09:54] Well if people know that on the weekends it's a little bit more what happens to that demand he's good at marketing

[09:59] Some of them might not come but a certain percentage would be like I love this restaurant, but I don't want to pay extra for

[10:04] So all of a sudden I'm gonna spread during the week and so what we do is we actually spread out the demand to meet the capacity now

[10:10] What are some other things that the restaurant owner could do they could let people pay extra to skip the line?

[10:15] This wouldn't necessarily solve the constraint, but it would make the business more money or they could just stay open later

[10:19] Because they might find out they're like hey, you know what we close it nine, but we still have lines. It's like all right. Well let's close it 11 if you did all three of those things

[10:25] We're talking like a hundred percent increases in profit sometimes more just from three small changes

[10:30] And the real reason is that

[10:32] Originally he was like we need to market more because we're not busy during the week

[10:36] And all he was doing is just keep jamming more into Fridays and Saturdays where he was capacity constrained by solving the right problem

[10:42] He actually can't unlock the growth in the business

[10:44] And if you're in one of these positions, let me give you a little tip people hate getting prices raised on them

[10:49] Of course they do, but what can you do that actually has the same net effect to the business?

[10:53] Instead of saying weekends are 20 percent more

[10:55] You can say weekdays or 20 percent less people are happy to get a discount and then pay normal on Fridays and Saturdays

[11:02] So it's all you frame it and so if you're in one of those businesses and you're thinking about how you want to do it

[11:06] Think about it like that. Let's do an example for so online business

[11:09] So let's imagine this is an online fitness equipment store during COVID

[11:13] All right, so homework out boom all the stores are empty right so overnight their sales got four X right sounds amazing

[11:19] Well, for anybody who's in in some of these businesses that had disproportionate demand during that time you would prefer to sell out and have that pain than have no one buying

[11:27] So if I had to pick I'd rather be supply constraint than demand constraint but both suck back to the example

[11:32] They sell out of everything their suppliers can't keep up, but instead of focusing all their energy on getting more inventory and improving their supply

[11:39] They keep running ads right the keep marketing and think oh we just need to ride this wave

[11:42] Maybe we'll pre-sell we'll keep selling more and more

[11:44] Well the result is that shipping times ago from two weeks to eight weeks bad for you start pouring in customer service gets swamped and reemails and all they end up doing is making the problem worse

[11:52] We each knew sale because they aren't fixing their real issue supply constraint or demand constraint

[11:57] Well, this was a little easier after the last one's a little harder. It's supply constraint business

[12:02] This is a pure supply constraint and it's physical product

[12:05] So let's talk about how we can break through it now once they realized this if they were to actually tackle the problem

[12:09] There's basically two core things that this business owner could do. Number one is sell something different

[12:15] Number two is going to be increased the supply of the business so I'm going to break that down. So the sexy thing to do would be say, okay

[12:22] We have all these customers that just bought our products from us. Is there something that's intangible that we can sell them that we're not going to run out of

[12:28] To immediately generate more cash flow. I mean that cash flow could help us pay our vendors more aggressively to put us at the front of the line

[12:35] Now some of you might hear this and be like, what a vendor would would skip a line lines are as old as time

[12:41] Right there the only fair system in the world. Now of course you could pay to get it to the front of the line say hey if I paid to 20% more

[12:46] Do you think you put my stuff first? Of course right money talks and so how would you generate this?

[12:51] So I'd be like, okay, I've got this fitness equipment. Maybe I go reach back out and sell a warranty with it

[12:56] Maybe I talked to a couple of fitness app developers and I say hey you guys have a product. I have all these customers that just bought this thing

[13:04] Do you think I could white label your thing or just do some sort of affiliate deal right in sell your product to my audience right in each of these situations

[13:11] The affiliate deal. I'm tapping in a somebody else's supply say cool you've already got supply. Well, let me sell through my distribution

[13:16] Alternatively, I have my distribution and I could sell an insurance product something like that that doesn't really have there's no supply associated with it

[13:23] I could maybe sell some services on top of like hey are there other things that you're looking at are you think about getting flooring or you think about how you want to design the gym

[13:30] You want to decorate the gym like these are all different things that we could sell to that existing base rather than continuing with more people in

[13:35] Who even if they had the money we can't deliver on the core service

[13:38] So in all of the situations these are ways you could easily generate the cash to then have leverage with suppliers or reinvest in the supply chain so that you could get your stuff to you faster

[13:48] And if you look at some of the biggest e-commerce companies in the world or just physical product businesses they have very dialed supply chain

[13:54] They have multiple vendors they have multiple kind of points of failure or rather not they have redundancies to eliminate single points of failure within the system

[14:01] So I'll talk to your friend of mine who's looking at buying a very large company that you've heard of one of the big things that you was able to do is like one of his core competencies is that he has an amazing supply

[14:09] And so he gets his raw materials and he buys better than just about anybody else and so if you're like oh, I'm just it's supply chain issues

[14:15] It's like that's the core of the business

[14:17] Or like if you're at a physical product business supply chain is it's the constraint if you have a great product

[14:23] It will become the constraint or if you're good at marketing it will become the constraint and if you want to see it a product businesses that are physical you got to get good at both of those things

[14:29] So this is the business you're really in I want to be really clear this is definitely not me advocating for you having woman the red dress in this very hypothetical scenario of somebody is in COVID

[14:38] And they can't do anything else than you generate cash so that they can move things forward

[14:42] I'm okay with what I would consider like one time or short-term options that you can generate cash in the business. It's the reality of business

[14:48] Sometimes you got to make those plays rather than saying oh, we're going to start another business

[14:52] And that's why with each of those things the insurance product or white labeling someone else's thing both those things don't really require to do much more than just introduce it to your existing base

[15:00] Sell them take the split take the cash and then reinvest in the thing that actually is limiting the business. If you're hearing this you're like, well, that's nice for a consultant

[15:07] That's nice for a restaurant that's nice for an online store, but my business is special. I'm a home services business. This could possibly apply to me

[15:15] So let's say you're a pumper and you're running Google PBC and you're booking you know every slide out in your calendar and your vans are always on the road

[15:24] Right technicians are working overtime and even with the overtime because you got to pay time and a half or whatever your overtime rates are

[15:29] Prophets are starting to compress. So it's like wait a second. It's like we're fully booked and we're just not that profitable

[15:35] So this particular owner might think oh, I need to get more customers or I need to get more technicians

[15:39] But if we look under the hood a little bit and this is comment it actually isn't either of those things

[15:44] You're like wait, what is it? Well, let's walk through it

[15:47] So we might find out that their plumbers finish the jobs quickly

[15:51] But they rarely offer additional services or upgrades. They're not selling them into the membership on a long-term basis

[15:57] They're not looking for a repair schedule that they're going to come back. They're not looking or asking for the other units in the house

[16:03] If they need to dig a look at those two and so the thing is is that they have a supply problem with their sales skills

[16:10] Rather than how many jobs they can do and so if the exact same number of customers could get sold twice the services

[16:19] But they're already there. It only takes a little bit more time for them to do the delivery

[16:23] They can basically better utilize their existing supply to increase revenue and profit within the business

[16:29] And so what we're actually diving deeper into is that there's basically this mongo decision tree that ends up if you've seen any of my cash cows episodes

[16:35] The first thing I typically look for is this supplier demand once I'm in the okay, maybe it's a demand is your old

[16:40] Maybe it's a supply issue. We start diving deeper. It's like, okay, well, maybe they're mispriced or maybe they don't have enough talent or the existing talent there

[16:47] Isn't selling enough per job or basically average cart value isn't high enough and because of that

[16:53] This particular owner can't spend to get more customers. You can't spend to get more technicians

[16:56] So what are you doing that situation? I can't spend to get more of either because profits are a thin well we have to either raise the prices

[17:02] But if they're competitive then it's like well, then maybe we just sell more work and so fundamentally this is how you dive through

[17:06] It's our diagnosing some of the issues within a business

[17:08] But the actual constraint like what would this owner have to do? Well, they would start teaching their plumbers simple sales skills

[17:15] and give them a two three line script that says once you finish this ask them if they want this right?

[17:19] They'd roleplay back and forth every morning. They meet. They see what percentage people they upsell to second job

[17:23] And all of a sudden they're like wait

[17:25] We're up selling 50% now to another job. Well, guess what happens revenue goes up by 50% guess what else happens if cost remain just about the same

[17:33] A disproportionate amount of that revenue drops the bottom line and most businesses that run paper than margins

[17:38] What I would consider established industries are just missing a core part of the business and so they're doing like step one and not step two and because of that step two is what the profit is

[17:47] This particular instance a lot of times people think the only way to grow is to get more customers right?

[17:50] But sometimes the best move isn't getting more customers. It's making more from the customers you've got so this home service is company

[17:56] They are barely making enough money and they're fully allocated for their technicians

[18:01] Are they demand constrained or they supply constraint?

[18:04] Tough the technical answer is that they would be demand constrained in my opinion and explain why

[18:10] So if they had more money per customer they would be able to make more money and have more profit to then go out and hire more head count

[18:20] And so sometimes you're in a rock in a hard place where you're kind of like at this stalemate between supply and demand

[18:27] Right? It happened one of our earlier examples too

[18:29] We're like well, we're barely making enough money. We need more technicians

[18:33] But we can't afford my statisticians because we're not making enough money when you're one of those situations

[18:36] You have a strategic problem which is typically going to be around price or the actual products that you're offering like this instance

[18:42] Is that they to sales issue they're not upselling enough customers to other services while they're in the house

[18:47] Because it doesn't cost them much more once they send the guy out to the additional services

[18:50] And those additional services make all the difference in terms of the net profit for the business

[18:54] Once that occurs now that unlocks, okay, well, do we want you to become more efficient or other guys?

[19:00] Which would then be truly unlock the supply constraint, but they now have the cash flow to solve it

[19:04] So real quick, if you're in one of those rock and hard place scenarios

[19:07] We're like I can't grow enough, but I can't spend the money to grow or I I need this help

[19:11] But I need money to buy the help if I had more customers I could afford it, but I can't disturb more customers

[19:15] These are classic hard rock place scenarios and believe it or not I just want to make you feel better like two thirds of businesses when I ask them

[19:21] Like have you been at the same revenue for two years? A lot of them say yes, and so if that's you don't worry

[19:26] It's solvable, all right, and so I put together with my team this hundred million dollar scaling roadmap

[19:30] You can check it out. So it's basically all the stages of business that we've broken down four scaling a company from basically zero to 500 plus head count

[19:38] And it's all the stages that we found from our businesses and specifically more important you where we got stuck and how we got through it

[19:44] And so if you'd like a custom scaling roadmap for your business right now go to acquisition.com

[19:49] For slash road map you can get it's absolutely free just type in your business information

[19:53] It asks for a bunch of things just so we can personalize it for you and on the thank you page if you're like man

[19:57] I would love to make sure that what I'm going to do is the right move

[20:01] Book a call. I'd love to have our team take a look at the business and maybe have you fly out here to add quarters if it makes sense to be fair

[20:07] This is only for business owners if you're not there. Bile me. It's going to enjoy the scaling roadmap

[20:10] But otherwise let's go back to it. So I'll give you a different example. So I'd have business who came out that was doing some sort of enterprise software for like commercial building

[20:18] So something cleaning and efficiency related I came from but I do absolutely recall why the business was stuck now

[20:25] This founder had been stuck at the same revenue level for years like eight years. He could not crack the serving level

[20:30] And so what we did is we looked at basically all the metrics of the acquisition funnel

[20:34] And so he had an outbound method because he had lists of what commercial buildings were in the area that he could service

[20:39] And went through it. I was like, okay, how many of these are you know, re-touch your sitting a day with the messaging and all that stuff sounded good

[20:44] And it was like, okay, so how many demonstrations are you doing per week of your you know, broader service

[20:49] And he was doing like 10 demonstrations a week and you're closing to a year and it was like yeah

[20:56] And like so your closing to out of 500 demos is like when you say like that it kind of sucks. I'm like, well, yeah kind of sucks, right?

[21:02] But the thing is is that in this particular instance they weren't really even demand constraint

[21:08] They were basically I mean they are functionally demand constraint but the issue was not actually the amount of people who said they were interested in the product or the number reach out there

[21:15] Or even the scripting of the conversation that they just couldn't close

[21:18] And so the leaders were like when they came to talk to me, they were like, hey, I think we need to hire more sales people

[21:23] And the literal of the plan was to double the sales team

[21:25] All right, so they're going to double the sales team because like hey, we listen to your stuff do more like we're double sales teams

[21:29] We can double our sales house. I was like my god. Let's not do that. Let's just figure out how we can get 500 demonstrations turn into a hundred deals instead of two

[21:36] It's a 50 x right there and this is an unbelievably valuable business and the reason they've been able to stay at that level is because they like 98% revenue retention

[21:43] I mean you're like no one ever left the business because it was such a complex thing that they were establishing and setting up

[21:48] And so the thing is is that right now if you look at your process you might find that you're like, oh, actually we have plenty of leads and people are scheduling calls

[21:56] And they are showing up, but they're just not buying or they are scheduling and they're not showing or they're opting in but they're not scheduling

[22:02] And so you might have this massive leak in your existing demand process that creates the demand constraint and then people mistakenly think, oh, I think I'm going after the wrong market

[22:12] Or oh, I think my ad suck or oh, I think the target is off, but if people are the right type of people that are opting in

[22:18] We have a sales process problem. That's where the demand leak is happening and so rather than saying oh, this double our ad spend

[22:24] It was double our sales team like we got to fix the problem. So after I dug into the business a little bit more

[22:29] I'll tell you where the actual road nugget was was that they were presenting to the wrong people

[22:35] So the way this particular business worked is that they had people who owned the buildings who wanted to save money

[22:40] And then they had building managers the guys who actually like ran the buildings and those were not the same person

[22:46] And so they have something called the principal agent problem, which is basically the person who has to do the work for person who makes the decision or two different people

[22:51] And so all the owners are like, yeah, go save me money

[22:54] But then when it got to that the manager of the building, they were like, oh, I don't want to do anymore work

[22:58] Because all this meant for them, they're not going to get paid more and they had the decision making power

[23:03] Even though the owners were the ones who were writing the check

[23:06] And so basically what we did was we re-scripted the process to essentially elevate the status of the manager and make it all about them

[23:15] Just like what business were you really in?

[23:17] It's what customers really serve

[23:19] And so that was kind of the million in this instance, probably ten million dollar plus question that we got to answer with that business

[23:24] And so by simply redefining that sales process for that specific avatar, that is what unlocked growth

[23:31] So let's go completely other direction

[23:33] Let's say that you're an online course creator, you're a YouTuber, you sell some sort of digital product

[23:38] And let's say that you've got students, you've got high completion rates and you get great results and people who have great reviews

[23:43] Okay, here's the problem, they're breaking even

[23:46] How could this even happen when you have a product that costs you nothing?

[23:49] This particular guy thinks, oh, the problem is marketing

[23:52] So he's spending more on fancy funnels, paid ads

[23:54] But every time like a new customer comes in they barely make any profit after the group at cost

[23:58] So it's the real problem, well there's a number of things, so let's break down each of them

[24:01] So either he's price too low, right?

[24:04] So oftentimes you'll find that you can double price and maybe sales might go down by 15%

[24:08] If that happens then it's like boom, we fix the business just without one pricing issue

[24:12] Sometimes it could just be the ads suck, which is a real one, right?

[24:16] The ads suck or the ads are good, but they're outdated because they're not making sufficient ads

[24:20] So it's either quality of ads problem or quantity of ads problem or both

[24:23] So this is supplier to make constraint

[24:25] Well, we're talking about raising his prices, but isn't raising prices what we do when we have supply constraints

[24:30] So if you raise the prices then fewer people buy you create space and you also create profit

[24:33] Well, then why would we raise the prices when we have a demand constraint?

[24:36] Because we can't afford to get more customers

[24:38] And so we need to raise the prices so that we can spend more money in ads

[24:41] So that we can get more customers

[24:43] Because fundamentally if we're answering the question, could he two acts the number of customers handling?

[24:47] Well, yeah, it's a course, it's very easy to get a login

[24:49] The delivery is not the constraint of this particular problem

[24:51] Even though we have a demand constraint, we might have a similar solution to a supply constraint business

[24:56] So if you tried raising his prices from let's say $1,000 to $3,000 for his main course, people rounded my think he's crazy

[25:02] No one's going to pay that, you know, whatever, right?

[25:04] But what would actually happen?

[25:05] So sales might drop by 15 or 20% which we just revenue nearly triples overnight

[25:09] But then by creating a high-end version for $10,000, which another 10% of the market might happily purchase

[25:15] You might get another $1,000 per sale

[25:18] So you guys from a $1,000,000 total per sale, 10% times 10,000 is an extra 1,000

[25:23] We had $3,000 in the new change and that almost made up for the sales drop that he had in terms of number of units

[25:29] And so same content, same marketing, very different results, all because he found and fixed the actual problem of the business

[25:34] Now, let's say alternatively in his special stuff like marketing can't raise the price

[25:39] Fine, so in this instance we say, okay, well, what you see or what you usually generate in a content are you you're currently putting out

[25:44] He also makes his own content, we're like, okay, well, what are your best performers? These ones, okay, why are your ads not those?

[25:50] I did thought they had to be different

[25:52] Take your best organic content out of five seconds CTA at the end run it as a paid ad

[25:57] Especially if you know that some organic content is generated sales do more of that and put money behind it

[26:02] At the very least if you're looking at your process of how people are getting into your business

[26:07] For the love of God, make sure that when you're sending traffic to a page, it's actually structured to convert the traffic

[26:13] You sending people to a beautiful home page, have the beautiful home page, but that's not the first thing they're going to say

[26:19] Get their information and then give them the thing they want and then they can go and pick around the site look around the thing is is that they'll have time to look at it later

[26:27] But right now we need to convert because people have very large motivation for very short periods of time when they see marketing

[26:32] And in that very short windows, we need to maximize my website, acquisition.com, I think is hideous

[26:38] And I get people giving me every day, but like I read this, I just I for you, I'm like, thanks for that

[26:42] And the thing is is that could my site be improved, yes

[26:46] Resources required to redo the site, it's going to be such a pain in the ass because every single department's going to have their own two cents

[26:52] What they think it should look like, we're going to have to make hundreds of decisions on something that I then say, okay, with all of these decisions and all of these resources

[27:00] Is there something else we could do that or grow the business more and oftentimes the answer is yes

[27:06] And so for me, I've had notoriously ugly home pages because at the end of the day, they typically can work fine and even though I'm like, oh my God, this is so ugly

[27:15] I just deal with it because at the end of the day, it's not that constraint

[27:18] And so I would say more times than not and like you hear this and it seems obvious when you're looking at someone else's business

[27:24] But when you look at your own, what you end up doing is you spend all your time doing the stuff you love

[27:29] Because you love it, but the business might not need it

[27:33] And so you spend all your time solving problems that don't need to be solved

[27:36] And investing resources, the very limited resources you have as small business owner

[27:40] Towards problems that simply increase potential, but not throughput

[27:43] Let's say you've got four lanes, one lane and then four lanes, right on a highway

[27:46] Okay, well if I take this one from four lanes to five lanes, is the traffic you go faster?

[27:51] No, but this is what happens when you improve your website and you don't get any increase in throughput

[27:56] In terms of your front end optimization, like you don't have a higher conversion rate

[27:59] Because of that, you can't handle more customers because of that

[28:01] And so all you did was you spent time and money to increase potential

[28:04] So with this business, is it a supplier to man constraint?

[28:07] Well, this one is a demand constraint, but less so that they don't have strong enough marketing

[28:12] They didn't have strong enough sales, so the process itself and more specifically

[28:16] They're almost like avatar constraint

[28:18] They were trying to settle the wrong person

[28:20] They were convincing the business owners all day long

[28:22] But the problem was the business owners weren't the ones making the decision

[28:24] They got the form of the factory, the guy on the floor was the one who was making the call

[28:28] So he's the real customer

[28:30] So let's do the next example, let's say that you can vibe code because of cursor that came out

[28:34] You're like, I can make an app in two seconds, right?

[28:36] And so this made up mobile app company shows, you know, if you build it, they will come

[28:41] Right?

[28:42] It's the most dangerous myth in business, right?

[28:43] And so imagine that company has built an incredible product that's easy to use

[28:47] All right?

[28:48] The tech team is world class, the apps fast, it's beautiful, it does all the good stuff, right?

[28:51] But user growth is painfully slow, so they would only have a few thousand users

[28:54] When they really need millions in order to make this business model work

[28:56] Now you might be like thousands and millions of my god, I would just want my first ten customers

[29:00] Everything that I'm talking about right now applies just add or remove zeros

[29:03] But the same concepts apply, all right?

[29:05] So let's say the founders are blaming the product

[29:07] They're like, maybe we need more features, right?

[29:09] Maybe it's too hard to get started.

[29:11] So is this app demand or supply constraint?

[29:13] Obviously demand constraint.

[29:15] And so they're fixing the wrong stuff and so the app is in the issue, awareness is the problem.

[29:19] Right?

[29:20] They're spending almost nothing on marketing and relying instead on the word amount.

[29:23] And so they have the serious demand problem but they're putting all their effort into product.

[29:27] And so they've shifted that focus to the right part if they could change.

[29:30] So let's walk through it, they might consider.

[29:32] So number one is they can probably optimize their app's digital listing.

[29:34] So if you convert a higher percentage of traffic, then a couple things happen.

[29:38] One is that you get ranked higher because your sales velocity goes up.

[29:41] But also Apple, I should push you more traffic, right?

[29:43] Because they get a percentage.

[29:44] So they want the highest converting products to be on the store and the highest in most prevalent positions.

[29:49] So that they make the most money too.

[29:51] That's just organically.

[29:53] On top of that, they could pay for user acquisition.

[29:55] They could take some of that extra talent that they're focusing on the back end and say,

[29:58] Okay, well, how do we maximize downloads and activation?

[30:01] They could go from an affiliate play and say, okay, what apps already exist that service is

[30:05] exact market?

[30:06] Is there a way we could run a banner ad on somebody else's product, which absolutely exists?

[30:10] You could run into a marketplaces where you can buy those types of ads.

[30:13] Right?

[30:14] On top, they could just build some really strong referral product depending on the nature of the product.

[30:17] And so in each of these ways, these would be things that they could do to capture more demand on the front end.

[30:22] Rather than being like, okay, well, no one's leaving and everyone loves the product, we get it views,

[30:26] but it's still not growing fast enough.

[30:27] And so within a year, if you just shifted all that effort there, the user basically would go to a larger, right?

[30:33] There are a hundred times larger, whatever, because the product was good enough.

[30:36] They just need to solve their real problem, which at the times to bend.

[30:39] Now, again, so let's wrap this together.

[30:41] Is it always a supply or demand-cutrain issue?

[30:44] The answer is yes, but it's not always going to be the same one at the same time, meaning.

[30:49] As soon as you solve a demand-cutrain, guess what happens next?

[30:52] You have a supply-cutrain, right?

[30:55] And then you'll solve your supply-cutrain and be like, okay, finally, we got all of our inventory back in place.

[30:59] The warehouses are full.

[31:02] We're not running any ads. Oh my God, now that the fitness equipment is back in place, it's like, oh my God, we got to spin this up.

[31:07] Now that we just hired four more countens, now we can take on more clients. Oh wait, we don't have any more clients.

[31:13] Now we go to get them.

[31:14] And so it's this accordion, this back-and-forth that happens, it's the natural flow of business,

[31:19] but when people get stuck, it's because they stayed working on the demand-cutrain after the demands-contract went away

[31:25] and it became a supply-contract.

[31:26] This ping-ponging, this back-and-forth, and the lack of awareness of the founder, realizing that the constraint is moved in the business,

[31:34] is why businesses will get stuck for years.

[31:36] And so if you have been stuck for a long time, it's not that you're an idiot.

[31:40] It's not that you're doing something wrong.

[31:41] It's likely that you started solving a constraint.

[31:44] You solved it, and you solved it so well, you created another one, but you didn't switch where your attention was being allocated.

[31:50] And so if you're like, okay, well where am I at today?

[31:52] Here's an easy battery list that you can kind of walk through.

[31:55] So first, answer these questions honestly.

[31:57] If more customers showed up tomorrow, could you serve them?

[32:00] Well, at the standard that you want, yes or no.

[32:03] Two, are you turning away business or putting people on waiting lists?

[32:06] Yes or no? Are your most profitable time slots or products always sold out?

[32:10] Yes or no? Do you run out of indoor or having long shipping delays if you're in physical products?

[32:14] Yes or no?

[32:15] If you answered yes to any of those, you likely have a supply problem.

[32:18] And so if that's you, this is what you focus on.

[32:20] The easiest one first is raising prices, right?

[32:22] It's the fastest fixed for a supply problem.

[32:24] The second thing is that you get adcapacity, right?

[32:27] The next is that you could just clean up operations.

[32:29] This means you get leverage for the existing people.

[32:32] So it's like, how do I get my one person to be able to deliver for three people instead of one or one?

[32:35] Right? This then creates text systems behind that.

[32:38] There's three ways you can solve the constraint on a service business outside of pricing.

[32:42] Number one is technology.

[32:44] As in this tech allows one person to do five times the work.

[32:47] Great. The second is training.

[32:49] So I got this person who's a level B talent to become level A talent,

[32:52] and they can now do five times the work.

[32:54] The third is that you then just bring somebody else on at the same B talent,

[32:58] and you just have twice the B's.

[32:59] In each of these situations, beyond pricing, these are the doors that we would knock on

[33:03] to feel like, okay, which of these is right for our business right now.

[33:06] Once you do that, let's see you solve that supply constraint.

[33:09] So you know what? I got my onboarding and training system for forgetting new people up to speed.

[33:15] And now I can do twice as much per account rep.

[33:17] So whoops. Now we have a demand issue.

[33:20] And so if you answered no those questions that I have,

[33:23] the things that you'd be focusing on obviously fixing the acquisition channel.

[33:27] So be like, you're going to get either have to do some sort of outreach,

[33:31] some sort of affiliates, some sort of ads that you're going to have to run,

[33:34] or some sort of constant strategy or combination of those that then

[33:38] generates the first level of demand.

[33:40] But you still have to convert that to demand.

[33:41] If you're getting those people, but you're not turning them to sales,

[33:43] you have a sales constraint, right?

[33:45] This is all demand side, but you have to look at your own business,

[33:48] which one of these is it?

[33:49] To double-clicking into the advertising and sales side,

[33:51] there's the advertising of like how you're generating the demand.

[33:53] And then there's the technical component of like how we capturing leads, right?

[33:56] Now the way you capture leads and the sounds like a very small thing is huge,

[33:59] because the way you lack in landing page,

[34:02] the headlines you use, the images you use, the copy you use,

[34:04] the lead magnet, if you have a lead magnet, you give away something free,

[34:07] the assessment, the call, whatever it is that you're giving away,

[34:10] the benefit for them taking the next action, that might just not be good enough

[34:13] to convert a high percentage of the traffic.

[34:15] And then you're going to have a people problem, the people suck and they're not following the process you have.

[34:19] You have a process problem, which is the process itself sucks and is selling to the wrong person,

[34:23] the wrong thing at the wrong time.

[34:24] You have an offer issue, which is like, you're getting in front of the right people

[34:27] and you're getting in front of the right time, but the offer you give them is not compelling.

[34:30] Or price doubles on both of these constraints.

[34:33] You might be doing everything right, but you're just not charging enough.

[34:36] And because you're not charging enough, you can't spend enough on marketing

[34:38] to get their people in so you can be profitable.

[34:40] Because once you have that, let's say, finally fix the advertising

[34:43] and we fix the conversion rate. Well, now we have sales.

[34:45] So here's the trap. If you fix the wrong problem, it actually not only waste money in time,

[34:50] it often makes it worse.

[34:52] And this is why so many business owners are like working their faces off and in so much pain

[34:57] is that the constraint switched.

[35:00] You didn't switch what you were doing.

[35:02] And by succeeding really well at the thing that's no longer the constraint,

[35:06] you're actually further straining the system.

[35:08] And this is really hard. And this is me personally.

[35:10] I've always been able to out-avertize any business I've ever had.

[35:13] I've always had supply constraints in my life.

[35:16] And so the problem is like, sometimes, and I've had to learn this,

[35:19] and sometimes I just had to take a step back.

[35:21] And be like, we're just going to let marketing or mediocre marketing or mediocre

[35:24] conversion continue because even if I fix it, it will literally make my business worse.

[35:28] And even though breaks my heart to have leads not get followed up with sometimes.

[35:32] It's just like, we can't even take them on if we could.

[35:35] And that's ultimately going to hurt my reputation more than not falling over the lead.

[35:38] So if you have a supply problem, more marketing creates chaos and unhappy customers.

[35:41] If you have a demand problem, better operations is going to help much when there's no one to serve.

[35:45] Right? And so the most successful businesses I've ever worked with, I've invested in,

[35:49] keep finding and breaking through their current problem, their current constraint,

[35:52] and then moving on to the next one.

[35:53] Because this is not a one-time fix. It's a way of thinking.

[35:56] So if you want to see supplier domain-controlled thinking in action in a real business,

[36:00] because when it's real business, it's always hairy, and it's not always as clear as some of these examples,

[36:04] I have two examples I can give you.

[36:06] Ashley, she was the demand constrained business in services.

[36:09] So if you're service-busin's that would be for you.

[36:11] And Raymond also a service-busin brick and mortar was supply constrained.

[36:14] And so, pick which one you want, go watch him and join.

## Full Transcript
[00:00] Do you hear something absolutely insane?

[00:02] If nobody knows who you are, it's actually a good thing.

[00:05] And so imagine this is you and you're here

[00:09] because you have no followers and of course you're very sad

[00:11] by that or at least you think you are.

[00:13] Maybe you're crying very sad tears, right?

[00:15] And you don't have this massive audience

[00:17] like these big celebrities or influencers do.

[00:20] And I'm just going to explain three reasons

[00:22] why this will help you win.

[00:24] My name is Alex Hormozi.

[00:25] I'm the founder of Acquisition.com.

[00:26] We make huge sums of money that are unreasonable.

[00:29] So much so that I can have unnecessary extra camera angles

[00:33] like this one and this one and this one.

[00:37] But I will give you my quick disclaimer

[00:39] which is that everything that I'll share with you,

[00:42] I'm an experienced person and a marketer.

[00:44] And so these are no way promises

[00:46] that you will achieve anything at all

[00:48] mostly because most people do absolutely nothing.

[00:51] That being said, let's dive in.

[00:53] So number one is that you're an underdog.

[00:57] So the first and most important point of being unheard of

[01:01] is that every position actually has an advantage.

[01:04] And so for example, let me tell you a story.

[01:08] So I had a company called Alan

[01:10] who signed it up selling 75% of four years ago.

[01:14] 2021, however many years ago that was.

[01:15] While I was working inside of Alan,

[01:18] we had B2B customers, sweet agents, and theaters.

[01:20] And so an agents, you undergone a photo of me

[01:22] and he actually was serving Jim owners.

[01:23] Now at the time I still owned Jim launch

[01:25] the company that I ended up selling also in 2021.

[01:28] He said, I feel like it's not fair

[01:30] that I have to compete with you.

[01:32] Now mind you, I'm like here trying to help this guy

[01:33] to grow his business, even though he is technically

[01:35] a competitor of mine by selling to Jim owners.

[01:37] I made this point to him that I thought

[01:38] was worth making probably for you, which it doesn't really

[01:41] matter where you're at in business.

[01:42] Like I think one, you should always try and think

[01:45] like an underdog.

[01:45] If you're in the peril space, you're always competing

[01:47] with Nike and so you're an underdog compared to Nike.

[01:50] But I think the underdog mentality is a winning mentality

[01:53] because underdogs are the ones who win ultimately.

[01:55] And the people at the top of the mountain

[01:56] are the ones who are fat and happy

[01:57] and end up getting taken over by the underdog.

[02:00] And so I mean Jeff Basos talks about this.

[02:02] He says it's always day one and Amazon.

[02:03] It's that they want to keep them in telly

[02:05] and part of the reason is why they are so big

[02:07] is that they still maintain that flexibility.

[02:09] So I want to hit on some of these advantages.

[02:11] And talking to this agent's owner, he was struggling.

[02:16] And he said, everybody who gets on the phone with me

[02:19] says, well, you're not Jim launch.

[02:21] And give me your track record.

[02:23] How long you've been doing this, things like that.

[02:25] And he was like, I just don't really have a good response.

[02:27] And so I said, well, have you considered that one

[02:30] when I started, I was in your position?

[02:31] And so one is possible.

[02:33] Number two is that your advantage is that you're not me.

[02:37] So if we're the biggest person in the space

[02:39] which Jim launch is arguably the biggest

[02:41] of the market leader in that industry,

[02:43] the advantage that I have as Jim launch is,

[02:46] I'm going to say, hey, this guy Adrian

[02:49] is in his mom's basement and has no track record.

[02:53] And if you want Coca-Cola classic,

[02:55] and you want to know that you have success

[02:57] or is in there's tons of case studies

[02:58] and tons of proof of Jim's just like yours

[03:01] seeing this level of success, we know that our system works.

[03:04] You just have to run the system.

[03:06] And so that's fairly compelling.

[03:07] Now, what are you saying, response to that?

[03:09] Well, what you would say to the prospect is like, listen,

[03:11] well, you don't want to work with Jim launch

[03:13] because to them, you're just a number.

[03:15] You're never going to meet Alex.

[03:16] You're never going to even probably even talk to him.

[03:18] He's not going to know your name.

[03:19] You're going to get a signed sum account rep, right?

[03:21] That doesn't care either.

[03:23] And they're just going to be running through

[03:24] some like checklist with you.

[03:26] Whereas for me, you're going to have my cell phone number

[03:29] if you need anything you can call me whenever you want.

[03:31] And it's actually me.

[03:33] And so what you're really comparing is not my company

[03:36] versus Jim launch, it's me versus their rep

[03:39] who they would assign you to.

[03:40] And I can promise you I'm far more dedicated

[03:43] to seeing you succeed than they are.

[03:45] Compiling.

[03:45] Of course, both positions have advantages.

[03:48] And so you want to play the cards your dealt.

[03:50] Only a loser's perspective that their position in some way

[03:53] dictates how the end is going to happen, right?

[03:56] Because one of the beautiful things about having nothing

[03:58] to lose is that you also have everything to gain.

[04:01] And so what it means is that you also

[04:03] have unlimited shots on goal.

[04:04] Because if you miss, you're just back at zero,

[04:07] which is exactly where you are.

[04:08] So you have essentially risk free unlimited upside,

[04:11] which I think people wildly underestimate

[04:14] the advantage of the underdog, which is why,

[04:16] in terms of game theory,

[04:18] they're the most dangerous player on the board

[04:19] because they can't lose.

[04:21] And that perspective was ultimately what got me

[04:24] to even quit my job in the very beginning was,

[04:26] worst case scenario, I just get my job back.

[04:29] So that means that I have risk free shots.

[04:31] It's like life giving you a lottery ticket.

[04:33] The only thing you pay for is with time,

[04:35] but you still have unlimited upside every time

[04:37] you scratch it off.

[04:38] To me, not a bad gig.

[04:39] And to be clear, I have the portfolio that we have now

[04:41] and it's all the money and success, whatever.

[04:43] But like, I had nine businesses that

[04:45] come out to almost nothing before I had my first real big win.

[04:49] And unless you're Mark Zuckerberg or you're Jeff Basis,

[04:52] which is not common, most people fail the first time.

[04:56] In the second, in the third.

[04:58] And sometimes what happens is that the failures

[04:59] just become a less failure.

[05:01] Like, in the beginning, like, not knowing by is anything.

[05:03] But you do remember building the logo on the website

[05:05] and thinking that you had a business

[05:06] but like nothing happens, right?

[05:07] And then finally, you make your first sale

[05:09] but you're like, this isn't a real business.

[05:10] Like, what's going on here?

[05:11] Like, I exchanged money.

[05:12] So I guess I technically made business.

[05:14] So I have to pay taxes on this now.

[05:15] Like, what happens, right?

[05:16] And then eventually you get to one where you're like,

[05:18] okay, now I'm starting to sell stuff and make money

[05:20] but like, I'm not actually making money.

[05:21] I'm making revenue but I'm making a profit.

[05:23] And I'm like, occurring all this risk

[05:24] and all this debt in order to get it going.

[05:26] And you're like, still trying to figure it out.

[05:28] And then I'm like, your fourth trial, you're like,

[05:29] oh, what do you know?

[05:30] I made a profit in 2005 years to get here.

[05:32] Every entrepreneur that I know.

[05:33] So I don't know, Zuck and I don't know Jeff Basis.

[05:35] So unfortunately, I'm not there.

[05:37] But the guys that I know, almost all of us,

[05:40] like, failed for a while.

[05:42] Like, I don't know anybody who like crushed it

[05:43] in their first five years.

[05:44] Like most people like basically eight glass

[05:46] and stared into the abyss to quote Elon Musk,

[05:49] which is just existential dread at all points in time

[05:52] and the eating glass is the fact that all you do all day

[05:55] is deal with problems, which are mostly revolve around people.

[05:58] And somehow you're supposed to get worked on in between.

[06:00] So if you're in that kind of underdog position,

[06:02] you can pop up in the Leeds book

[06:04] and I have a chapter that I wrote on this,

[06:06] which is called More Better News.

[06:08] So it's 161 and I actually tell some of this story

[06:11] that I'm telling you right now.

[06:12] And one of the things that most smaller underdogs

[06:16] really no matter what size you are relatively,

[06:19] have this belief that's false.

[06:21] And so I want to kind of crush it for you.

[06:23] Real quick, the reason for this ad

[06:24] is I'm throwing the entrepreneur event of the season

[06:26] and you're invited.

[06:27] This is gonna be my biggest book ever.

[06:30] No, not like that.

[06:31] This is gonna be my biggest book.

[06:33] Well, not even like that.

[06:34] This is gonna be my biggest book ever.

[06:35] Actually, not even like that.

[06:37] This is gonna be my biggest book ever.

[06:39] $100 million money models.

[06:41] And I've been preparing to release this book

[06:43] to you for over two years.

[06:45] And at the launch of the August 16th,

[06:47] I'm gonna be showing you how to get more customers

[06:48] to spend more money with you in less time, over and over again.

[06:51] The most viable skill set I have.

[06:52] Now, on top of that, come check this out.

[06:55] I've got five mystery headlines

[06:57] that have all confirmed they're gonna be their live.

[06:58] And they've never before shared the same stage

[07:00] and most of these people don't speak publicly.

[07:02] Now on top of that, I have four amazing bonuses

[07:06] that are available to anyone who wants to prove it or both.

[07:07] You don't have to, because you can register for free for that,

[07:09] you can show up for free, you can enjoy all of that for nothing.

[07:12] But if you want a pre-order copy of the book,

[07:13] I've got four bonuses for you.

[07:14] Now on top of that, I've got one project

[07:17] that I've been working on for the last two years

[07:18] that I'll be unveiling life.

[07:21] And I can't say what it is,

[07:22] but I can tell you that it's better than NFC,

[07:24] it's less than a Bitcoin,

[07:25] and every single person shows up live gets one.

[07:28] So, if you want it, click, register,

[07:30] I'll see you there live, August 16th,

[07:32] pre-order book if you want, it's gonna be awesome.

[07:34] So, number one is that the volatility that you're experiencing

[07:41] is a result of inadequate volume.

[07:45] So, you're not doing enough

[07:46] which gives the appearance of volatility.

[07:49] So, let me say differently.

[07:51] If you were to sell one person every three to five weeks,

[07:56] and you're like, every month,

[07:57] they get one customer, sometimes they get two customers,

[08:01] what that really means is that there's a certain amount

[08:03] of advertising activity that is occurring,

[08:05] whether it's what you're doing it,

[08:06] or it's other people doing it on your behalf,

[08:08] or it's worth a mouth, any of those things are happening.

[08:11] And it takes that much volume for you to get one new customer.

[08:14] And so, the question we have to ask ourselves is,

[08:17] how can I take the amount of advertising

[08:18] that's occurring over four weeks to get me one customer,

[08:21] and crush it into one day

[08:22] so I get one new customer every day?

[08:24] That's all it is.

[08:25] The volume, increasing volume, negates luck,

[08:28] and will give you consistency.

[08:29] The second piece is understanding where you actually sit here.

[08:33] P268, the size of the pie fallacy.

[08:36] So, the issue is that most small businesses

[08:39] think that it's like this.

[08:40] They start advertising on one channel.

[08:42] They're really happy.

[08:43] Look at this big smiley face.

[08:44] Okay, then a competitor comes in.

[08:47] And they start advertising on the same channel.

[08:50] And then in their minds, they think,

[08:51] oh no, I have half of this market now.

[08:54] And then all of a sudden, two more competitors come in.

[08:56] And now you're like, oh no, I have a quarter of this market.

[08:59] It's shrinking fast, it's so saturated.

[09:01] But that's a fallacy.

[09:03] That's a lie.

[09:04] It's an illusion.

[09:05] This is what it looks like in reality.

[09:07] So, most people see their market as one method,

[09:09] one platform, one medium.

[09:10] They're like, well, I make Instagram reels,

[09:13] and that's how I get my customer.

[09:14] So, anybody else who makes Instagram reels,

[09:16] they are in my market and it's saturated.

[09:18] But the reality is that there's so many ways to get customers.

[09:21] You can do warm out,

[09:22] you can do cold out,

[09:23] which you can post content,

[09:24] you can run ads, you can have affiliates,

[09:26] you can have referral networks,

[09:27] you can have employees doing this

[09:28] on your rehab, you get if agencies

[09:30] and headhunters, you're bringing people in.

[09:31] All of these different vehicles for advertising.

[09:34] And then within those vehicles,

[09:36] now you have the platforms of all those things.

[09:38] So, it's like you're making content on LinkedIn,

[09:40] you're making content on Twitter,

[09:41] you're making content on podcast,

[09:42] you're making content on TikTok,

[09:44] Twitter, Twitter, TikTok, right for however long it lasts.

[09:49] So, all of these different platforms,

[09:50] it's like, so really,

[09:52] that little circle that you have

[09:53] is just this tiny, 80-bitty circle here.

[09:55] And all of these other circles

[09:57] and all of these other methods

[09:58] and all of these other mediums are basically empty.

[10:01] And so, the reality is,

[10:03] no one knows you exist.

[10:05] And so, the answer is you have to advertise more.

[10:08] You have to let more people know about your stuff.

[10:10] And so, the way that we do this

[10:12] is we do the rule of 100.

[10:14] All right, and so, by method, that means that's page 164.

[10:18] You either do 100 or reach out to day, colder warm.

[10:20] You do 100 minutes of making content

[10:22] and post something,

[10:23] which for some reason I didn't put that in the book.

[10:26] No, I said, release it one per day.

[10:27] Thank God.

[10:28] All right, but some people here that first line

[10:30] and they're like, I'm making hundreds of content a day

[10:32] and I'm like, I haven't seen you post.

[10:33] They're like, well, I'm still working on it.

[10:34] I'm like, what are you doing?

[10:35] Post.

[10:36] All right.

[10:37] And then, and then,

[10:39] pay dads is 100 minutes a day of making pay dads.

[10:41] So, that's doing the research, looking at other hooks,

[10:43] recording, editing, cutting it,

[10:45] and spending money.

[10:46] Right, you got to spend money.

[10:47] And the amount of money you spend

[10:48] I would say per month should be relative

[10:50] to what you're willing to pay per customer.

[10:52] Okay, now I have an update to this

[10:54] that I'll share with you,

[10:55] which we learned from the school games,

[10:56] because I help a lot of people who are starting out.

[10:58] No, it doesn't matter whether you're brand new

[10:59] or you're an experienced business owner.

[11:00] If you start a new channel, you're still starting at zero.

[11:02] Right.

[11:03] And one of the things that we added in

[11:05] for at least the content side was,

[11:07] most of the times you'll be limited by,

[11:09] you know, the amount that you can make

[11:10] and sometimes even the amount of DMs that you can do

[11:11] on a social platform,

[11:13] but one thing that's not really limited or less limited

[11:15] is the amount of comments that you can leave

[11:18] on other people's posts.

[11:19] And so, what you want to do,

[11:21] the goal is to have the best comment on a post

[11:24] that is relevant to your avatar.

[11:26] So basically, it's like, all of these posts exist

[11:28] and almost like free ads

[11:29] that you think are attracting the attention of your avatar.

[11:32] And so what you want to do is have the most thoughtful response

[11:34] to that post.

[11:36] And then you basically get a like,

[11:37] hit your ride on somebody else's views

[11:40] and it's totally legal.

[11:42] So like, do that on top of this.

[11:44] And this is for those of you who are like,

[11:45] I just don't know what to do.

[11:47] This is what you do.

[11:47] You reach out to people, you make content,

[11:49] you run ads, pick one.

[11:51] And to be clear, this is Alex's two cents.

[11:53] So this is a personal opinion.

[11:56] I don't really tear people down.

[11:57] That's just, I just don't do that.

[12:00] Some people like make their whole brands

[12:01] on dunking under their people.

[12:02] I just don't like that kind of negativity personally,

[12:05] like in my life or otherwise,

[12:07] you're walking to do whatever you want.

[12:08] My recommendation would be to give people flowers

[12:10] and basically give them props,

[12:13] which is what I think millennials say,

[12:15] for when they do a good job.

[12:17] So I'm dating myself here, flowers.

[12:20] Tell them they did a good job.

[12:22] And basically break down or add to it.

[12:23] Say, like, I love all this and I think it's a great way.

[12:27] So instead of saying, basically,

[12:28] this is an thinking instead of overthinking.

[12:30] So my first piece of homework is

[12:34] write what your advantage is in your current position.

[12:38] So if you're Nike and Nike,

[12:40] if you do want to respond to this video,

[12:41] I'm totally okay with it.

[12:43] But if you're not Nike,

[12:44] right, talk about the unique angle that you have,

[12:48] compare to the leader in your marketplace.

[12:50] Because let's be real, the vast majority of people

[12:51] who are watching this are not the leader.

[12:53] It's only one leader and everybody else is not the leader,

[12:54] is more people than the one.

[12:56] So the likely that you're not the leader is high.

[12:58] So talk about how you're different than they are

[13:01] in a way that is actually correct

[13:03] that they cannot argue with.

[13:04] And drop it in the comments.

[13:05] I love the same.

[13:06] And everything that I just talks to you about,

[13:08] those positions is what I would weave into my sales

[13:10] and my marketing.

[13:11] Because the nice thing there is it's also,

[13:13] it's not like claims based.

[13:14] It's just like these are the facts.

[13:16] And this is the reality of it.

[13:18] And if you ever want to make more compelling marketing,

[13:19] the thought that I would give you is just

[13:21] drill one level deeper.

[13:23] At the surface level, it's like it's David and Goliath.

[13:25] But like when you actually drill down,

[13:26] it's an unfair advantage.

[13:27] Because David isn't really competing in its Goliath.

[13:30] It's competing against Goliath's like NECAP.

[13:33] It's like it's the piece of the larger thing.

[13:35] There's this amorphous idea of Nike,

[13:37] but really all you're competing against

[13:39] is the person who's six levels down

[13:41] who got hired out of college to make their social media

[13:45] pose for one specific person or whatever.

[13:48] That's how you have to beat.

[13:49] And so the way that you beat the Roman Empire

[13:52] isn't by taking the Roman Empire on head on.

[13:54] It's by tiny little nibbles on the edge of their perimeter

[13:58] and just working your way in.

[13:59] And fundamentally, that's how the barbarians over time

[14:02] crunch down on Rome.

[14:03] And so in this instance, we are the barbarians.

[14:06] Now, part two, it's actually much easier

[14:10] to figure out a smaller business than a big one.

[14:12] And let me explain.

[14:13] So you've probably heard the idea that if you have a boat,

[14:16] it's much easier to turn a dinghy

[14:18] that it is to turn the Titanic.

[14:20] Well, obviously you can't turn the Titanic

[14:21] because they're good.

[14:22] Just kidding, the boat's dead, the people might still be alive.

[14:25] I have no idea.

[14:26] And I don't know if they had smoked stacks,

[14:28] but let's just pretend this is the Titanic

[14:29] before they had this big hole and everyone died.

[14:33] Okay, and so the idea is, it's much easier

[14:38] and more nimble to move a small boat.

[14:40] Now, let me give you the actual math.

[14:42] So this is cute.

[14:42] But let me tell you the actual business that might this.

[14:44] We use a term that we call nail it and scale it.

[14:47] And it's really nail it in order to scale it.

[14:49] And the problem is, most people learn how to advertise

[14:51] they learn how to sell a little bit

[14:52] and then take, oh, I just need to do more of that.

[14:54] But here's the problem with that.

[14:56] Until you find out the company vehicles

[14:58] within your business, you're bound to plateau.

[15:00] And so I've done this example before,

[15:01] but I think it's so powerful that it's worth repeating.

[15:04] So let's say that you have company A and company B.

[15:06] All right, and both of them sell 100 people per year.

[15:11] So 100 new customers per year, sorry, A,

[15:14] sell 100 per year, B sells 100 the first year,

[15:17] 200 the second year, 300 the third year.

[15:19] Well, which company would you rather have?

[15:21] At face value, you think, oh, I'd rather have B.

[15:24] But wait, there's more.

[15:26] Let's say company B loses 100 customers every year

[15:29] because they're not that good at what they do

[15:31] or they don't have a very good model.

[15:32] And so that means that next year they lose 200

[15:34] and next year it leaves 300.

[15:35] Now, let's say company A keeps 100% of their customers.

[15:38] So you're two, they actually have 200 customers.

[15:41] And you're three, they have 300 customers.

[15:44] They have the original 200 plus this 100.

[15:46] So now it's 300 and total.

[15:48] So both of these look like they're 300 sales per year

[15:52] businesses.

[15:53] But which of these would you now rather have?

[15:55] This guy, because the margins are going to be better

[15:58] because you don't have to pay to acquire

[16:00] all of these extra customers.

[16:01] They had to pay to acquire 600 customers, right?

[16:05] This one only had to pay to acquire 300.

[16:07] All of that added cost drop straight to the bottom line.

[16:09] But on top of that, this is a business

[16:11] that literally will always keep growing.

[16:14] If you think about every year,

[16:15] you can sell another 100 customers and you would just keep growing.

[16:17] This business next year, if you sell another 300,

[16:20] the only way to grow is to sell 400 customers next year

[16:23] just to keep up with that.

[16:24] And I can promise you, one of the laws of nature

[16:27] is that advertising new acquire customers

[16:29] only becomes more expensive in time.

[16:31] Because you are going out to colder and colder audiences

[16:33] that are less and less of a fit.

[16:34] You're not getting the early adopters.

[16:37] You're actually getting the laggards and the later adopters.

[16:39] And so it costs you more to reach them.

[16:41] They're hard to sell.

[16:42] They're more price sensitive.

[16:43] Like it has all the negative things.

[16:45] And so this is common when companies look

[16:46] that are bigger if they're looking to exit.

[16:48] The acquireers, and issues to investors,

[16:50] is going to look at this and say,

[16:51] how much runway is there that's left?

[16:53] And is there a way that we want

[16:55] at the very least can maintain the customers we have?

[16:57] And ideally have some sort of vehicle inside of it

[17:00] that allows those customers to bring us more customers.

[17:02] And so imagine that, let's say you're here.

[17:05] And then you watch this video.

[17:06] And unfortunately, I've had a lot of business owners

[17:08] who watched my stuff like realized this

[17:10] is that they're like, oh no, I'm this business.

[17:13] And I'm selling 300 people every year

[17:15] and I'm losing 300 people every year.

[17:16] What do I do now?

[17:18] It's tough because you're in a rock

[17:19] in a hard place in your area.

[17:20] And this is why it's so important to nail it, then scale it.

[17:23] And so you just want to advertise and sell enough

[17:25] so that you can figure out what is required

[17:27] in order to keep customers.

[17:29] Keep them happy, keep them referring, keep them paying.

[17:32] If you can't figure that out,

[17:33] there's basically no point to scaling.

[17:35] It's going to get more and more expensive.

[17:36] Your margins are going to get thinner.

[17:38] And it will feel more volatile

[17:39] because you probably rely almost exclusively on paid ads.

[17:42] That's tough.

[17:43] And so having a different way to think about it,

[17:46] which is you want to get the foundational unit right.

[17:48] Once you get that right, everything else gets much easier.

[17:51] You know, I'm a huge consumer software startup,

[17:54] founders.

[17:55] And one of the things that they talk about a lot

[17:57] is it's so much better to just build your product,

[18:00] or build your service for 100 people to absolutely love you,

[18:03] than to have a million people who kind of like you.

[18:05] I think part of this is that it's very difficult

[18:07] to build something for the amorphous

[18:09] for the faceless masses,

[18:11] but it's much easier to build something

[18:12] for a specific person of which

[18:13] there happen to be many and many of this people.

[18:16] And so I think getting really crystal clear.

[18:18] This is why having an ICP or customer avatar,

[18:21] we're going to call it some sort.

[18:23] And you can name them.

[18:23] It's like this is Jenny.

[18:24] This is our customer.

[18:25] She has three kids and she wants to lose weight

[18:27] or whatever it is.

[18:28] Would Jenny like this?

[18:30] Like what would Jenny think about this?

[18:32] And some of the best companies

[18:33] that I've seen from a product and branding perspective

[18:35] always basically have Jenny sitting at the table

[18:37] or their customer avatar.

[18:38] And they're like, what do you think Jenny thinks about this?

[18:41] And that's what allows them to make

[18:42] the best long-term decisions for the customer

[18:44] and the brand.

[18:45] For the love of God, if the economics that you have

[18:47] when you're small aren't amazing,

[18:49] they're not going to get better when you get bigger.

[18:50] And so if you're like, okay, that's great Alex,

[18:52] but how do I tactically improve my offer

[18:54] or like my offering to the marketplace?

[18:56] So inside the offer book, I talk about this,

[18:59] which is creating your grand slam offer part one and two,

[19:00] which is basically the problems and solutions.

[19:02] And so I think one of the best exercises

[19:05] that anyone can do with their team

[19:07] is, and if you're just the team that is just you, right?

[19:10] It's to sit down and say, let's write down

[19:12] what, here I walk through, I walk through.

[19:15] So the first thing we're gonna say is, what's the dream, right?

[19:19] What is Jenny want?

[19:20] What is her big outcome that she wants to have happen?

[19:22] Okay, now that we define that,

[19:24] we want to be as crystal clear about that as we possibly can.

[19:26] It also feeds in the messaging,

[19:27] sales scripts, copy, et cetera.

[19:29] The second thing is we're gonna talk about

[19:31] what are the problems?

[19:32] What are all the things that are getting in the way

[19:34] of her getting her dream of accomplishing

[19:36] what she wants to accomplish?

[19:37] And we wanna be, again, as specific as possible here.

[19:40] Now, typically, there's really one big dream, right?

[19:43] But there's many problems that get in the way of that dream, right?

[19:46] It's very simple to just say, oh, I just wanna six pack.

[19:48] That's a dream, right?

[19:49] But what are all the things that are preventing you

[19:51] from getting your six pack?

[19:53] It's probably like you don't know how to cook food.

[19:55] You don't know how to grocery shop.

[19:56] You don't know how to weigh yourself.

[19:57] You don't know how to count calories.

[19:58] You don't know how to lift weights.

[20:00] You don't have time to go to the gym.

[20:01] You don't have to make different food for you

[20:03] as you do for your spouse.

[20:04] Like there's almost unlimited problems

[20:06] that can manifest.

[20:07] And all you have to do is ask somebody who's given,

[20:08] just give, listen to their excuses.

[20:10] That's what the problem is, all right?

[20:12] Now, once you have the problems, what I want you to do

[20:15] and this is a mental exercise is you list them

[20:19] as solutions.

[20:22] So you take, so after you have all the problems,

[20:24] you're then gonna list them as solutions.

[20:26] So the solution is gonna have two parts to it.

[20:27] One is you wanna have some sort of name around it.

[20:29] That's like, okay, you don't know how to cook food.

[20:31] So we have our, you don't have to cook food system, all right?

[20:34] Now underneath of that, we're gonna have every possible way

[20:37] that we can think of.

[20:38] And this is probably the most creative fun part, right?

[20:40] You're gonna list every possible creative way

[20:43] that you could solve it.

[20:43] And I'm saying like, you can't think about cost,

[20:46] you have to be purely brainstorm.

[20:48] And so, by the way, fun rule for brainstorming

[20:50] is that you never say no, you just add to things.

[20:52] You say that's amazing and.

[20:54] So it's a lot of and thinking not worth thinking.

[20:57] There's a lot of good ideas

[20:58] around the third or fourth iteration, all right?

[20:59] And so for example with this meal thing,

[21:01] I could myself drive to their house

[21:04] and I could cook their food for them.

[21:05] I could do that, right?

[21:06] Like, let's write it down.

[21:07] What else could we do?

[21:08] We could hire a chef to do that.

[21:09] Okay, cool.

[21:09] What else could we?

[21:10] Maybe hire chef for lots of people.

[21:11] Okay, that's kind of interesting.

[21:12] Oh, what else could we do?

[21:13] We could do a grocery store

[21:13] where we actually take them shopping.

[21:15] Okay, what could we do?

[21:16] Of recorded version that?

[21:17] We could do recorded version that too, right?

[21:18] It's all the things you think about all the different ways

[21:20] you could solve it.

[21:21] When you think about this, you're like, wow,

[21:21] there's like 20 ways that could solve this problem.

[21:23] Right, which then leads you to step four,

[21:27] which is I call the trim and stack.

[21:30] And this is probably the most business oriented part

[21:32] of the five steps, all right?

[21:34] Which is, you have this big list and you say,

[21:36] okay, if we were to rate these on which of these

[21:39] are very high value and which of these are low cost,

[21:45] we want the ones that are super high value,

[21:47] super low cost to be our first priority.

[21:49] Now, the second bucket,

[21:50] and this is something that I've probably changed

[21:51] that might be a little different than what I have in the books.

[21:54] It's a little bit of an update.

[21:56] Is I am more okay with what about some things

[22:00] that are incredibly high value that have some cost?

[22:03] Because a lot of people immediately go to zero cost solutions

[22:05] because they want to just have something

[22:07] that cost nothing.

[22:07] The thing is, it's very crowded in the zero cost solution market.

[22:10] But you know what's not that crowded?

[22:12] The little bit of cost solution or the medium cost solution.

[22:14] But very high value.

[22:16] And so the thing is that this process

[22:18] is an unconstrained ideation process.

[22:21] And the reason for that is we have yet to determine our price.

[22:25] And so you might be like, why can't drive out of their house?

[22:28] Could you for a million dollars?

[22:30] Probably, well, then it's not off the board yet.

[22:33] So we just want to think, what is the most valuable combination

[22:36] of these things?

[22:37] Then we go to step five and we say,

[22:40] this is now our valuable thing, our valuable grand slam offer.

[22:47] For whatever amount of money that you want to charge,

[22:52] that makes sense relative to your trim and stack.

[22:54] And this process, I'm telling you,

[22:56] if you're like, man, my customers aren't in love

[22:58] with my product yet, then build this out.

[23:00] And here's the thing.

[23:02] Oh, and the next 60 seconds, I'm going to show you

[23:06] the system that's responsible for the vast majority

[23:08] of my material success.

[23:10] And inside this, I'm doing this at the live launch event.

[23:13] I'm going to show you how to get customers

[23:14] versus spend more money with you in less time over and over again.

[23:18] But that's not all.

[23:19] On top of that, there's going to be four amazing bonuses

[23:21] that are available to anyone who wants to pre-order

[23:22] before the event.

[23:23] And on top of that, I've got one secret project

[23:26] that I've been working on for over two years

[23:28] that would be releasing live at the event itself.

[23:31] Now, I can't tell you what it is yet,

[23:32] but I can tell you that it's better than an NFT

[23:34] and it's less than a Bitcoin and every single person

[23:36] shows a live gets one.

[23:37] But you got to be there, August 16th.

[23:39] So click, register, and I'll see you there, life.

[23:45] It's much easier, and this is unfortunate,

[23:47] but it's much easier to promise these things

[23:49] than it is to deliver them.

[23:50] And so the reason that I emphasize the nail and scale

[23:52] is that if you do have multiple components

[23:54] to your service, your product, the one

[23:56] that you deliver and have it this being credible valuable thing,

[23:58] this is very compelling when you present it to somebody,

[24:00] which is why you can raise your prices,

[24:02] you can make more profit, you can market better,

[24:03] can sell better when you fall this framework.

[24:06] But if you can't deliver, you don't want to scale it yet.

[24:10] You want to keep working on it.

[24:11] And the reality is that it's going to take a lot longer

[24:14] than you think.

[24:15] It's like this has just been a very hard lesson

[24:17] learned for me, is that what you think should take you

[24:20] six weeks, oftentimes, six, six months, sometimes a year.

[24:24] And so what you realize the longer you do businesses,

[24:27] that there are just far fewer things,

[24:28] fewer new things that you can take on,

[24:31] then you really think.

[24:32] And so there's always going to be an issue

[24:34] with translating these things to your team,

[24:36] so that they can actually execute,

[24:38] and forget about new people coming in,

[24:39] who haven't even gone through this process.

[24:41] They're just adopting this final solution,

[24:42] but they don't know how you've got here,

[24:43] and how you derived it.

[24:45] And so being more patient about the idea,

[24:48] and I'll give you a little side quest for you.

[24:51] So in any given function,

[24:53] let's say that this is your baseline of performance.

[24:57] Now, whenever you change anything,

[24:58] in my experience, you get about a 20% decrease

[25:00] in performance immediately.

[25:02] All right, so if you change your sales script,

[25:03] you get a decrease in performance.

[25:04] You change your ad copy, you're going to decrease in performance.

[25:06] Often, I mean, change your landing page most times,

[25:08] the page that you had probably was working,

[25:10] it's just something that's not that,

[25:11] has a lower likelihood of succeeding than something

[25:12] that is more of that.

[25:13] Right, so a lot of times, when you make a change,

[25:16] and this is especially operational changes,

[25:18] more so than anything else,

[25:19] oftentimes you get a decrease or a decryse or a decryse,

[25:20] or a decryse or a decryse or a decryse.

[25:21] And so if I know that I'm guaranteed

[25:23] to have this 20% decrease,

[25:25] then it means that I need to make changes

[25:27] that I have a very strong idea

[25:29] that they're going to have at least a 20% increase effect.

[25:32] And so the result of this line of thinking,

[25:34] which has made me a significantly better entrepreneur,

[25:36] this is a huge breakthrough for me,

[25:38] is that number one, some things will never get fixed.

[25:41] And that means that some things you're like,

[25:43] man, this could be 5% better.

[25:44] The cost of the change, if you are constantly changing,

[25:48] because here's the thing is you're like, well,

[25:49] I'd be willing to give the 20 to four months from now

[25:53] have that return to baseline

[25:54] and they get the 5% improvement.

[25:56] Yeah, but that assumes that you're going to change

[25:58] nothing else in that four month period,

[26:00] but you might be an 80-day entrepreneur

[26:02] and you might just change it.

[26:03] Which means that you're actually permanently kind of sitting

[26:05] at this 20% decryse and performance,

[26:07] because you've never given anyone a chance

[26:08] to get good at their job, you're always changing shit.

[26:11] And so I traditionally will over-index now

[26:16] on stability, because we get consistent improvements

[26:19] in performance across the team,

[26:20] because people just get better at their job.

[26:23] And then if I really think that something's worth changing,

[26:26] it better be north at 20%.

[26:28] And so it's like, man, I keep doing the math.

[26:30] I think this is like a 30 to 50% boost for us.

[26:33] If that's the case, then it's probably worth the bet.

[26:36] But most of the small changes that I used to mess around

[26:39] with my company were, I'm Steve Jobs, every detail has to be there.

[26:43] Like, if you're building a physical product,

[26:45] that is manufactured, that's different,

[26:47] if you're building software one time change, different,

[26:49] in a service business, if you're changing process,

[26:51] that people have to execute, very tough,

[26:54] make sure that it's worth it.

[26:55] And to bring this whole offer stack idea back

[27:00] to being an underdog, if you do this,

[27:02] when you have Zillian's at customers, way harder,

[27:05] then if you just have a handful,

[27:06] because you can change the bet, like you can be more nimble.

[27:09] And so the smaller your team is,

[27:10] the more agile they'll be,

[27:12] the less this decrement and performance

[27:14] will be as a result.

[27:15] If it's just you, I mean, you don't need to communicate

[27:16] as anyone, you can just change, right?

[27:18] And so, like, again, think about that as a natural extreme.

[27:20] On one side, it's just you,

[27:22] so there's basically no change in or decrease in performance

[27:25] that you have to learn stuff, but you'll learn it quickly.

[27:27] Right?

[27:27] But if you have to translate it to a 50% team,

[27:29] it's like you better be darn sure that it's good, more of it.

[27:31] And so this is another advantage that you have of being smaller.

[27:35] So nail it first so that you're not gonna have to change

[27:38] this later, because it's gonna be costly.

[27:40] And so the third big reason that there's a huge advantage

[27:42] is being an underdog is that your competition

[27:45] changes over time.

[27:46] Let me kind of break this down for you.

[27:47] So in the beginning, the big competition,

[27:49] you can maybe make the argument,

[27:50] this one's always there, right?

[27:53] Is you, you are the competitor, right?

[27:55] Like, you have to get yourself off the couch.

[27:57] Like, the person you can get,

[27:58] it's like lazy version of you,

[27:59] version of you that you think you need to be better than, right?

[28:02] Now, let's say that you're like, you know what?

[28:04] I finally believe that I could do this.

[28:05] Okay, well, who's the next big person

[28:08] that you're gonna have to face?

[28:10] It's gonna be your family and your friends.

[28:13] Because now some of you guys have amazingly supportive friends

[28:15] and family, and I am so grateful for you.

[28:18] But for everybody else, a lot of those people

[28:20] are gonna believe you.

[28:21] They're not gonna believe in you.

[28:22] They're not gonna believe you.

[28:23] They're not gonna believe in your idea.

[28:25] And they'll say sometimes tonight remarks,

[28:28] sometimes they'll scoff at the trade-offs that you're willing to make.

[28:31] Right?

[28:32] Like, you're like, well, I can't go to that event

[28:33] because I need to keep working on this.

[28:35] And then all of a sudden, now you're costing them, right?

[28:37] Because the thing is, it's that fundamentally,

[28:39] they have this relationship with you,

[28:40] and it's based on these expectations.

[28:41] And you're saying, you know what?

[28:43] I'm changing the expectations of our relationship.

[28:45] And most people don't like when things change.

[28:46] And the reality is that like,

[28:48] I'd say that in the earliest part of my career,

[28:50] this was by far the biggest part that was painful.

[28:52] Is the friends that you move on from?

[28:56] Because you say, hey, this is the terms of our new,

[28:58] new relationship if you wanna call it that way.

[28:59] And they'd be like, well, I don't agree to those terms

[29:01] and you're like, well, then I guess you can't really

[29:02] be hearing more.

[29:03] It's kind of tough because the thing is,

[29:04] I've seen a lot of entrepreneurs like,

[29:06] they will just say, you know what?

[29:07] I would rather have these friends than my dream.

[29:10] And if that's you, amazing.

[29:11] You won, you made a decision.

[29:13] But I would just advise you to say, like,

[29:15] is it really worth it?

[29:16] And I would say that a lot of people

[29:17] that I've had in my life have come and gone.

[29:20] And I've been very grateful for the work

[29:22] that I've been willing to do.

[29:23] That's a, you know, Alex, one thing.

[29:26] You can do it every one.

[29:27] And I don't know anything.

[29:28] I have three, I do have three cameras though.

[29:30] So, you know, just saying, all right.

[29:35] So what's the next competitor?

[29:36] So now the next one is going to be employees.

[29:38] Now it's not necessarily that you're going to be employees.

[29:40] So think of these more as like bosses,

[29:41] you have to face that you have to get over.

[29:43] And these never go away.

[29:44] So it's like they add on top each other.

[29:46] You're still going to have to conquer yourself at every level.

[29:48] You're still going to have new pressures from friends and family

[29:50] at every level.

[29:51] Now here, now you got to sell employees on your dream.

[29:53] You have to recruit really smart people

[29:55] because you want to do something good.

[29:56] You're going to need help.

[29:57] All right.

[29:58] Like, there's no African proverb that I love,

[29:59] which is if you want to go fast, go alone,

[30:01] if you want to go far, go together.

[30:02] And I think big things are accomplished with teams.

[30:04] Because fundamentally, anything that's really big and worth doing

[30:07] takes a tremendous amount of expertise

[30:09] and it takes time to learn all these different skills.

[30:11] And so you can't live 20 lifetimes.

[30:13] And so no matter how smart you are,

[30:15] you have a lot more leverage, finding people

[30:18] or exceptional at these things and just bringing them in.

[30:20] So I'm going to leverage this 20 years

[30:21] that they already spent there.

[30:22] I don't have to spend this 20 years.

[30:23] I have all that experience in skillset,

[30:24] I'll just bring them on it.

[30:26] Now the next level that ends up coming up

[30:28] and this is the bigger businesses will hear me in the room.

[30:31] You're going to have market place changes.

[30:33] Because now you're big enough

[30:36] where markets do move you.

[30:38] When you're really, really small,

[30:40] basically it doesn't matter how small the industry is.

[30:42] If you're trying to make $100,000 a year, you can do it.

[30:44] Because the industry is probably,

[30:45] if it is an actual industry,

[30:47] it's going to be significantly larger than $100,000,

[30:48] in terms of revenue.

[30:49] And so it's almost an inconsequential amount of money,

[30:52] not saying to a user person,

[30:53] but to like in general for a marketplace,

[30:55] it's not a lot of money.

[30:56] And so as you get bigger,

[30:58] like if a market treats by 20%

[31:00] and you're a huge part of that market,

[31:02] like that will affect you.

[31:04] And also the same degree,

[31:05] as you make more money,

[31:06] regulators begin to target you

[31:08] and try and find things that you are not being compliant for.

[31:10] Like Elon talks about this now.

[31:12] This is not a political comment.

[31:13] We're saying like, you look at Amazon, look at Fortnite,

[31:16] look at Reebok.

[31:17] Just in the last year, all of them had hit with

[31:19] FTC suits around something that's not compliant.

[31:22] And so I would just say one thing on this

[31:23] that I'm moving on, which is fundamentally

[31:26] when 100% of businesses are not

[31:30] being some law, then there's probably a deeper question,

[31:34] which is the law adjust.

[31:36] And who are the ones who are making these laws?

[31:38] And are these people who are qualified

[31:40] to make them based on their business experience?

[31:42] And so on to be clear, I think there's always,

[31:45] there's important, you know,

[31:46] it's important to have rules of the game

[31:47] in order to play in a game.

[31:49] But I do also subscribe to Elon's perspective

[31:51] of like if there are too many referees

[31:52] on the field, you can't play the game at all.

[31:54] And so, but these are facts of life.

[31:57] And so to loop this to what I was talking

[31:59] over the beginning, which is the advantage day

[32:00] of an underdog, is you don't need to worry

[32:02] about all these other things yet.

[32:03] And these things are coming,

[32:05] but you don't have to worry about it yet,

[32:06] because you're not big enough for regulated

[32:08] to give a shit about you, honestly.

[32:10] Right?

[32:10] Like your friends and family, like maybe you're just getting started.

[32:13] And so, these are things that are coming,

[32:16] the competitors will change in their sophistication

[32:18] and in the pressure that you're exposed to.

[32:20] And you just got a stand tall and deal with it.

[32:25] But as an underdog, you're like,

[32:27] not my problem right now.

[32:28] I just got to focus on what's in front of me.

[32:30] And so, that's the advantage that you have.

[32:31] And part of the difficulty with the friends and family

[32:34] and sometimes customers is,

[32:36] well, I'll just tell you a story that I think

[32:37] will illustrate it.

[32:38] So, I wrote this narrative when I was a gym owner,

[32:43] when I was probably 23, 24 years old.

[32:45] Now, I like writing, I was a,

[32:47] I got a creative writing scholarship back then,

[32:50] I ended up not taking it.

[32:52] But I like writing, I was head of the creative literary

[32:55] magazine in high school.

[32:57] It's something I enjoyed.

[32:57] So, I wrote this article basically, or essay,

[33:00] called, everyone believes in the American Dream

[33:03] and Telle comes true.

[33:04] I was struggling with this difficulty of my reality,

[33:07] which was that, you know, when I started out in the gym,

[33:09] which was my first business,

[33:11] I didn't have enough money for two rents.

[33:13] And so, I'd saved up all my money for two years

[33:15] to start the gym and I didn't have enough money for rents

[33:17] so I'd just slept at the gym, which I was fine with.

[33:20] And, you know, customers basically could figure out

[33:22] because they could see my pillow at the corner,

[33:23] like they kind of got what was going on.

[33:25] And they were like, good for you,

[33:27] for you know, pursuing your dream, like that's awesome,

[33:29] like keep at it.

[33:30] And then like the gym started to grow, right?

[33:33] It started to fill up, it started to,

[33:34] I started to be a little higher in employees.

[33:36] And, you know, probably nine months later,

[33:38] or you're later, you know, I'd come in.

[33:40] And at this point, I have a manager for location

[33:42] and it kind of runs not without me,

[33:43] but like I owned it more than me running,

[33:45] you know, working inside of it.

[33:47] And I'd show up and then like, you know,

[33:48] the clients would be like, ah, bossman, see, or, you know,

[33:52] and I remember being like, wait, I, like,

[33:56] you guys said that you were rooting for me

[33:58] to pursue my dream.

[33:59] And now that I have accomplished my dream,

[34:01] you guys make Snyder marks in me.

[34:03] And it was, you know, I've said this before,

[34:06] but it was the first time that I realized

[34:08] that people want you to do well,

[34:09] just not better than them.

[34:10] As you continue to achieve,

[34:12] you will see that in the vast majority of people.

[34:15] Now, I believe that special friends exist

[34:17] who truly want you to win.

[34:19] And if you have those people, like hold them close,

[34:22] because most people aren't like that.

[34:24] Most people will be happy either over or more likely,

[34:30] subconsciously or, you know, under the surface,

[34:35] when you lose their happy

[34:37] because it makes them feel better

[34:38] about the things they didn't take on,

[34:39] the risk they didn't take.

[34:40] And so it's tough.

[34:43] Business isn't for the faint of heart,

[34:45] but at the same time, neither is life.

[34:47] And so I think like everything is hard.

[34:50] And I think that the only real flaw in the system

[34:53] is that we have a belief that it shouldn't be.

[34:57] And that if we somehow change our conditions,

[34:58] it will get easier.

[34:59] And it basically just never does.

[35:01] And I think that's been something

[35:02] that's like helped me kind of get through my, like,

[35:06] woes me while I'm weighing moments that I have,

[35:09] which is like, if I had a job that I was in satisfied with,

[35:14] I would be unhappy.

[35:15] If I have, if I have, you know,

[35:18] stressors of day to day business that occur,

[35:20] like that also can make me unhappy.

[35:22] Now, of course, you can make your argument.

[35:23] Nothing makes you happy or unhappy.

[35:25] But I am human, probably like you.

[35:28] And I have things that definitely have better days

[35:30] in worst days.

[35:31] And I think that more or less across all of these situations,

[35:35] I have more or less day to say.

[35:38] Right? Like, I think there are things that

[35:41] money buys you that make life more convenient.

[35:43] And it's definitely one of those things

[35:44] that you never believe people until you have it.

[35:46] So I'm not gonna try and diswage you from doing it.

[35:48] My whole channel is about helping your very business.

[35:51] But I think that it helped me get over a lot of stress

[35:54] in thinking that this should not be this way.

[35:58] Like, just like, what demand of the universe am I making?

[36:01] That isn't true.

[36:03] This is should be easy.

[36:04] It should feel better.

[36:06] It shouldn't be this stressful.

[36:08] Like, it shouldn't have this many people problems.

[36:11] And also, comparing it to the alternative,

[36:14] which also has problems.

[36:15] And so I think a lot of times we get in this really

[36:18] negative spiral as business owners, which is we compare ourselves,

[36:21] we look at the grass and the other side of the field,

[36:23] but we don't know that it's lined with manure.

[36:25] Right? That's what makes it grow.

[36:27] And I think I try to remind myself of that.

[36:29] Whenever there's a green pasture, it's like,

[36:30] it's built on sh**.

[36:31] And so that helps me just say, okay,

[36:34] I just don't know what the sh** is on the other side,

[36:36] but it's there.

[36:37] And that kind of gets me kind of back in the saddle and focus.

[36:40] And so I will wrap with this, which is that,

[36:43] if you were an underdog, you have advantages.

[36:46] Every position has an advantage.

[36:48] You have to nail it and then you scale it.

[36:50] And be grateful that the competitor that you're competing

[36:53] against right now is smaller, because they only get

[36:55] bigger and stronger as you get bigger and stronger.

[36:58] So if you're a business owner,

[36:59] I just started doing these real business breakdowns

[37:03] of business owners that actually have come to our headquarters.

[37:06] And from the audience, some of you guys,

[37:08] and I'll spend an hour or two with them

[37:10] and basically break down what they need to do

[37:12] to scale their business at a super tactical level.

[37:15] I think it's some of the best stuff

[37:16] that we're putting out.

[37:17] I'm super proud of it.

[37:18] Very excited about it.

[37:19] Go check the video out, watch it, enjoy it.

[37:21] And let me know.

[00:00] Scientists have discovered a revolutionary new treatment that makes you live longer, it enhances

[00:03] your memory and makes you more creative.

[00:05] It makes you look more attractive, it makes you slim and lowers your food, craving to protect

[00:09] you from cancer and dementia.

[00:10] It wards off colds and the flu, it lowers your risk of heart attack stroke and not to

[00:14] mention diabetes.

[00:15] You'll feel happier, less depressed, less anxious, are you interested?

[00:19] If so, keep listening.

[00:21] Practically right now, the number one thing that actually does all this stuff is sleep.

[00:25] And sleep is a key to determine how good of safe you are physically, how much fat you

[00:28] store and where, how good you are, make you decisions how productive you are, how intelligent

[00:31] you are.

[00:32] And in other words, this isn't the kind of stress that makes you stronger, it's the kind

[00:35] of stress that makes you dumber, fatter, slower and with a smaller bank account.

[00:39] And if you don't know who I am, I am Alex Mozi, I am the owner, managing partner of acquisition.com.

[00:44] We have a portfolio of companies that is about 85 million dollars a year.

[00:46] And one of the key questions I get a lot is what do you do at night in order to have

[00:51] a nighttime routine?

[00:52] And so I have assembled a large amount of habits over my life.

[00:56] I think I counted them over 55 that I am going to go with you.

[01:00] And a lot of them are as tiny as, put, you know, take a piece of salt before you go

[01:04] to bed so that you don't pee at night.

[01:07] Like there's tiny little hacks that I've developed over time that I have acquired from

[01:10] learning.

[01:11] And I heavily ripped off this presentation from a presentation that I gave with Dr. Trevor

[01:15] Cache, my good friend at one of our licensee meetings.

[01:19] And so without further ado, I want to explain you why this is such an important part

[01:23] of making money.

[01:24] And that might sound crazy to you, but I will explain.

[01:27] And so the reasons for entrepreneurs in terms of why we need to have good sleep schedule,

[01:31] good sleep hygiene, good sleep routines, etc.

[01:33] Is really two main things.

[01:34] Number one is impulse control.

[01:35] Number two is intelligence.

[01:37] So from an impulse control perspective, I'm sure you guys have already heard a lot of

[01:40] self-development books and know about the lizard brain and all that kind of stuff.

[01:42] And as it turns out, a sleep deprived brain basically has us performing as the drunk

[01:47] person.

[01:48] And so it gives us the emotional stability of a drunk human being.

[01:51] And so the fancy connection between you being a lizard and the part of your brain that says,

[01:55] hey, maybe we shouldn't do that gets weaker.

[01:57] And so your ability to put on the brakes goes down.

[02:00] And so it doesn't inherently make you a negative person, but it makes you more reactive

[02:04] and more prone to be overreactive or emotional when you ideally shouldn't be in a business

[02:09] scenario.

[02:10] Second is intelligence.

[02:12] So our ability to learn new things.

[02:14] The more you sleep, the more your brain clears out useless information, from short-term

[02:17] and stirs it as useful information into the long term.

[02:19] So if you don't sleep as much, you have a goofy short-term memory while you're on

[02:23] wake on top of a terrible capacity of information from short-term to long-term while

[02:27] you sleep.

[02:28] Not only that, what you do to manage to learn during a subdibrary state, erodes away each

[02:32] night.

[02:33] So even if you greater, or get a regular time to sleep, your ability to store learned and

[02:36] reconformation is almost in half with this little two hours of sleep deprivation.

[02:39] All right.

[02:40] So to drive this home, your ability to learn is even apparent with fitful sleep.

[02:43] That is to say, sleeping enough.

[02:45] But if your sleep is poor quality, you are still doomed to be learning challenge in this

[02:48] community.

[02:49] Anything from the ghost.

[02:50] In other words, if you don't sleep as much, or as well as you could be your drummer because

[02:53] of it and as a result, you will make less money.

[02:55] That's my case.

[02:56] Now, I didn't really like any of this stuff in general because I'm not a big believer in

[03:01] superstitions and whatnot, and I will cover some of my beliefs around this topic.

[03:05] But my first wake-up call was when I actually had a client and my first business.

[03:09] I snapped at a customer and she was like, you can't do that.

[03:12] I realized what I had said, and the person had a very normal request and I just like,

[03:15] really bit their head off.

[03:16] She was like, you're not going to be able to run a business like this.

[03:19] And that was when I realized I needed to change some stuff.

[03:21] And so that kind of began the journey for me down this $100 million sleep.

[03:25] Compendium of little tips and tricks that have served me well.

[03:28] Over 55 that I will cover in this video.

[03:30] Now, that being said, I broke this down into kind of four major buckets.

[03:34] Belie√üe are on sleep that have served me well.

[03:36] The environment that is conducive to the best high quality sleep.

[03:40] Three intake in terms of all things you put into your body or directly apply to your body.

[03:44] That have improved my ability to sleep.

[03:46] And then finally, habits that surround sleep and activity in general that I generally do.

[03:52] And so I didn't really think that I had so many of these until I started to write them down

[03:55] for this video because there was a question that I was getting in my FAQs on the gram.

[03:59] And so without further ado, let's rock and roll.

[04:02] Okay.

[04:02] So here are my eight beliefs around sleep.

[04:05] Number one is do not create superstition.

[04:08] All right.

[04:09] So you have to remove the have to must need to should.

[04:13] From like, if I don't get eight hours of sleep, right?

[04:16] Like if you think that way, so as much as I just said everything is important, I'm now

[04:19] going to just contradict myself in saying that I think that these beliefs are more important

[04:22] than the rest of the stuff I'm going to cover this video.

[04:24] All right.

[04:25] Because the thing is, like, still think about this as an 80, 20.

[04:27] Like if 80% of the time you're good and 20% is high or not, it happens.

[04:30] Right.

[04:31] We're human and everyone wants to be perfect and known is.

[04:32] And then for the reason we get up some of ourselves, that being said, whenever you say

[04:35] things like I have to, I must, I should.

[04:38] You're actually creating a threat to yourself in the universe because the next thing is or what?

[04:42] Like I have to get this sleep come or what, right?

[04:44] Or I have to follow my routine come or what, right?

[04:47] And if you fill out that or what, all of a sudden you realize that some of the beliefs

[04:50] you have are kind of silly.

[04:51] And so one of the worst things you can do after this presentation is a disclaimer in a

[04:54] morning is take all of us, all the stuff I'm going to show you as doctrine and say, if I don't

[04:57] do all these 55 things, I am a terrible person, I will have terrible sleep, I will make

[05:01] less money and I will suck.

[05:02] Don't do that.

[05:03] All right.

[05:04] If you can take one or two of these things to improve your sleep on 10% of your night

[05:07] to sleep for the year, it's a win.

[05:08] Right.

[05:09] 365 nights.

[05:10] If we can buy the end of this video, increase your quality of sleep by 10 or 20% just

[05:14] from one 20 minute thing that you do one time in consumer, that is a amazing return on time

[05:20] and attention.

[05:21] All right.

[05:22] So just as a big disclaimer.

[05:23] Number two, as much as I just said that sleep is so important, I believe that is serving

[05:26] well is thinking I don't need a lot of sleep.

[05:28] Now in doing that, what it does is that my anxiety around sleep is not really present

[05:33] at all.

[05:34] Like I don't obsess about sleep.

[05:35] I have done all the things that I'm going to cover in this video and I do these

[05:37] things ahead of times that I don't have to think about it.

[05:40] But like I don't allocate a lot of time towards sleep stuff in general, especially a lot

[05:44] of mental efforts.

[05:45] A lot of people struggle with sleeping and I understand that and I am not one of them.

[05:47] But I think part of this is because of the 55 things I'm about to show you, which I have

[05:50] now covered two of them.

[05:51] Now the third point here is I like to have the belief that I can sleep anywhere.

[05:56] So we want to create our sleep dojo.

[05:58] Right?

[05:59] Our ideal scenarios where we want to sleep, but we want to have the capacity, the flexibility,

[06:03] the adaptability to be able to sleep on a floor with nothing.

[06:05] Right?

[06:06] And so it's balancing these two ideas of like I want to increase the likelihood of my

[06:10] success or ideal outcome while also in no way needing to having to musting this thing.

[06:15] Right?

[06:16] I don't have to do this thing.

[06:17] I prefer to do this thing.

[06:19] All right.

[06:20] Number four, this is a belief that is serving well.

[06:22] 90% of the benefit that you get of being asleep is from being just in a dark and with your

[06:26] eyes closed.

[06:27] And so the reason you might be like, well, I don't know if that's sciencey.

[06:30] Hold on.

[06:31] If you've ever been tired in the middle of the day and you just close your eyes for 10 minutes

[06:34] or 15 minutes, then you feel completely

[06:35] like regenerated or re-energized.

[06:38] It's because you get a lot of benefits just from being in a dark room with your eyes closed.

[06:42] And so I have taken that as a belief of mine because sometimes when you have this anxiety

[06:46] of like, I have to fall asleep quickly, I have to get more hours I have to count on

[06:49] the clock.

[06:50] Like all of those things decrease the likelihood of going to sleep.

[06:52] And so for me, that's why I say I don't need a lot of sleep.

[06:54] I just remember that's 80, 20.

[06:55] I don't have to be super-sicious about it.

[06:57] I am the type of person that can be successful and energized and succeed, even if I sleep,

[07:01] I don't see it at all because I have a history in a past, I've known that I can do that.

[07:04] So decreases my need for having to sleep, which then, and so doing actually allows me to sleep

[07:08] more.

[07:09] Number 5, working all day helps.

[07:11] So I never really had any issues sleeping, but I especially didn't have issues sleeping

[07:16] when I was starting my first businesses because I worked literally all day long and I could

[07:21] sleep standing up.

[07:22] And so if you ever in these situations where you are struggling, I do think that just literally

[07:26] working harder, doing more stuff, doing more thought-consuming work, doing more physical activity,

[07:30] helps.

[07:31] You're not doing that stuff, maybe you can take a real ego-less look at yourself and say,

[07:36] like, can I be working harder?

[07:37] Are the things that I'm doing right now, not engaging, and that could be in your work?

[07:40] That could mean whatever.

[07:41] And so doing is it impairing my sleep because I'm not getting enough of a spike during

[07:45] the day, which is not creating enough of a trough at night.

[07:47] Because the actual worst case scenario of what it looks like to not sleep well is that usually

[07:51] you're a grog eater in the day and then you're groggy at night.

[07:54] But you're never fully asleep and you're never fully awake.

[07:56] So what you want is the highest peak during the day and the lowest trough set night.

[08:00] And if you're not getting the high peaks, you need to create the high peaks so that you can

[08:03] give yourself the opportunity to crash.

[08:05] Number six, tracking.

[08:06] I stopped doing it.

[08:07] So I used to track, I had one of those rings or a band or whatever.

[08:10] I've tried to, I've tried to, I've tried to, different things.

[08:12] But what ended up happening in, and I'll tell you, I haven't solved this problem for

[08:15] me.

[08:16] I get, I'm too competitive.

[08:17] I'm competitive with myself and I see, and every day I wanted to break a new sleep record.

[08:22] But you don't hit sleep records, right?

[08:23] Like, but I am an incremental and prouver by nature.

[08:26] And so whenever I saw that stuff, I ended up thinking and obsessing and I would try not to move

[08:29] it all because I didn't want to move my phone, the which would fuck the app up.

[08:33] And so I basically threw out all the apps and I slept better as a result because they

[08:37] into the day, that's all it matters.

[08:38] All right.

[08:39] Number seven, don't judge yourself.

[08:40] Not good or bad as humans, animals don't need perfect sleep to survive.

[08:44] Think about the amount of times animals have to move in the middle of the night because

[08:46] the predator comes by.

[08:47] Like, all of these things are ideal.

[08:49] We don't have to be perfect and judging ourselves is usually the source of the vast majority

[08:54] of the anxiety that we have is that we say, we are bad.

[08:56] Sleepers, therefore, I'm a bad person.

[08:58] I don't have mental health.

[08:59] That's great.

[09:00] But what?

[09:01] Which then you can ask the question, why do I need to have great mental health?

[09:04] Why does it make me a bad person?

[09:06] And so you can ask other questions around the threats that you're implying with your

[09:10] must have to statements.

[09:12] And then finally, and this is a belief that has served me well.

[09:15] This is kind of on the border of habit, but it felt better in this bucket.

[09:18] Treating weekdays and weekdends as the same thing is one of the easiest and biggest things

[09:23] that you can do in the beginning of your entrepreneurial career because you probably

[09:26] work on weekends anyways.

[09:27] So they are probably your weekdays as much.

[09:29] They're just weekdays without meetings.

[09:31] And so you can actually just get more work done.

[09:32] And so for me, my most productive work actually happens in the weekends.

[09:35] And so that's when I want to get my best sleep.

[09:37] And so I definitely don't want to change the way I sleep and want to wake up during

[09:41] this time or treat them any differently.

[09:42] Okay.

[09:43] So without further ado, that is the first of the four buckets.

[09:46] So beliefs are now covered.

[09:48] Sorry, didn't put check marks in this thing.

[09:49] I figured you guys would care more that I just crank this out for you.

[09:52] Those are the beliefs.

[09:53] And that is my big disclaimer before I dive into this because people will love to say, oh,

[09:57] yeah, if I don't do all these 50 things, I'm going to suck and I don't want you to do

[10:00] that.

[10:01] Take one or two of them, take three or four of them, implement them over time.

[10:03] Maybe one of these things is like, oh, I didn't know I could do that.

[10:05] And awesome.

[10:06] We'll do it.

[10:07] Okay.

[10:08] Number one, make the room cool.

[10:09] And if it looks like it's small on the form or on the sheet here, it's because I have

[10:11] a lot of them on this list.

[10:12] So here's nine environment hacks.

[10:14] Are these the things that you can do.

[10:16] And then here's the next thing about the environment hacks.

[10:17] You can do it once and then never worry about it again.

[10:19] Like I love do it once and then get benefits forever.

[10:22] This is one of these things.

[10:23] So make sure that you have good ventilation.

[10:25] If you haven't fixed your AC unit and it's not strong enough.

[10:27] If you haven't fixed it, insulation the room, fix it.

[10:29] You'll sleep better.

[10:30] It is worth it no matter how much money you make for the life benefit you get.

[10:34] Because if you sleep better, you tend.

[10:36] I'll give you an interesting staff that I don't have in the presentation.

[10:39] One more hour of sleep creates more happiness for the average American than an extra 70,000

[10:43] dollars a year.

[10:44] Okay.

[10:45] Crazy.

[10:46] So think about that.

[10:47] Like you can try to make more money or you just sleep a little bit more, right?

[10:51] Or a little bit better.

[10:52] So number one, make the room cool.

[10:54] Typical is 68 to 72.

[10:56] We sleep at 67.

[10:58] I like it cold.

[10:58] I run hot and I tend to have like a sheet on and lay on like two blankets.

[11:02] So make sure that the room is cold enough for you.

[11:04] If it's not, it's just miserable.

[11:06] Number two, have a house plant in the sleeping room.

[11:08] Everyone needs a friend, right?

[11:09] Something alive is nice.

[11:10] Now I'll tell you at the very end of this little 9, 9 part section.

[11:13] All the things that I do.

[11:14] I do number one.

[11:15] I don't need number two and I'll explain at the end in a second.

[11:18] But number three, get rid of all the lights in the room.

[11:20] Aside from the other, it's obviously.

[11:21] So don't do the charging stuff, LEDs, anything of that nature.

[11:23] Not even your phone in the sleeping room.

[11:25] All right.

[11:26] So get out, the screens, TVs, computer, get it out of the room.

[11:28] All right, keep your phone in another room if you can.

[11:30] It will keep your anxiety levels also a tad bit lower

[11:32] because all of your anxiety comes from your phone.

[11:33] So if you can get it out of the room,

[11:35] getting out of the sleeping area will help you

[11:37] from a headspace perspective.

[11:38] Okay?

[11:39] Number four, get blackout curtains or I mask or better yet do both.

[11:43] And you want to be able to like, it should be able to be pitch black

[11:45] in the room in the middle of the day.

[11:47] Like that's how isolated it is.

[11:48] Like just having curtains isn't good enough

[11:50] because there's the things on the sides.

[11:51] And I'm telling you, I know this sounds minor,

[11:52] like the depth of your, like these are all,

[11:54] you do this one time and you just get better sleep forever.

[11:56] So like to me, one time fix for long-term benefit worth it.

[12:00] All right, number five.

[12:01] And you know what, as a side note,

[12:03] a lot of people don't do this stuff in their businesses either.

[12:04] It's like if you can, if you can front load the work

[12:06] and then just get enduring compounding returns on the back end,

[12:09] why not do it?

[12:10] Okay, so number five, get a way to blanket.

[12:12] And it doodle evidence suggests 10% of your body weights.

[12:14] If your 200 pounds get a 20 pound blanket, make sense.

[12:17] There's actually a ton of research that supports this,

[12:19] which is pretty cool.

[12:20] It's rare that like new stuff actually comes out

[12:21] that's useful.

[12:22] Way to blankets, pretty cool.

[12:23] Number six, get a nice mattress.

[12:25] All right, I can give you the stats,

[12:26] the mattress salesman pitch.

[12:28] But basically, you're spending eight hours of your day, right?

[12:30] In bed.

[12:31] It's like a 30-year day.

[12:32] It's like we spend millions of dollars on a house

[12:33] and we spend like a grand on a mattress.

[12:34] Like, come on.

[12:35] It just like, you don't even spend that much time

[12:37] in your car, like think about it.

[12:38] I agree with the pitch and I think it makes some

[12:40] plea sense like there's not many expenditures

[12:42] that will increase the quality of your life

[12:45] and your productivity so much as just getting a mattress

[12:47] that isn't shitty.

[12:48] Number seven, this is a great one.

[12:50] This is actually one that we started doing like six,

[12:53] six or seven years ago and it's just been really great

[12:55] and I used to make fun of Leila for it,

[12:57] but now I actually really like it.

[12:58] Having a white noise machine or a white noise app

[12:59] on your phone, there's a zillion free ones

[13:01] or getting used to ear plugs if you're used to that

[13:04] because we are right now like where I'm at right now

[13:05] we're on the strip.

[13:06] So like, I have plenty of noise and light around me

[13:08] so we have blackout curtains and we've got your plugs

[13:11] if we need them, which I only really have to do

[13:13] on like big concert nights

[13:14] because a white noise machine covers all that.

[13:16] And so like if you and you and your partner,

[13:18] you make noise or you have all the little creaks

[13:21] and things that wake you up in the middle of the night,

[13:23] all of that goes away with white noise machine.

[13:24] So like for me, this is one of those things like

[13:26] if you get used to them in the beginning

[13:27] because I didn't have it, Leila used to sleep with the one

[13:29] and I didn't and I started sleeping together

[13:30] and so I had to get used to sleeping with white noise

[13:33] but now that we do have it, it's actually awesome

[13:35] because when you go to hotels, when you're in different areas

[13:36] and you have this thing that you can't control

[13:38] from an environmental perspective,

[13:39] just having white noise just blocks everything up,

[13:41] which is great.

[13:42] All right, you can even have a fan

[13:43] and put in against the wall, it doesn't really matter.

[13:45] Eight, I have an orthotic pillow.

[13:47] So for me, I have like terrible neck shit

[13:49] and so I sleep with an orthotic go like wraps around

[13:52] on my back like a U, it's like a $200 pillow.

[13:54] I'll see if I can put links in the description

[13:56] from some of the stuff that I referenced

[13:58] but anyways, getting a good pillow is important

[14:00] so like try them out and like here's a fun one.

[14:03] Buy five, if you're like, I'm gonna spend five,

[14:06] I'm gonna buy five pillows, yes, buy five pillows

[14:08] figure out the one you like the most

[14:09] and then toss the rest.

[14:11] And you're like, what?

[14:11] Waste?

[14:12] Yes, life is short, sleep on a good pillow.

[14:15] All right, number nine, sleeping buddies.

[14:16] Consider separate rooms.

[14:17] I know this is crazy and absolutely against common

[14:20] common, whatever.

[14:22] Lailon, I actually didn't sleep in the same bedroom

[14:23] for like a year and a half

[14:24] and it and believe it or not, you can still have sex.

[14:27] If you don't sleep in the same bed,

[14:29] the same way you did before you were married.

[14:31] When you didn't sleep in the same bed, I know.

[14:33] Grazy, and so you'll also probably like each other

[14:35] more if you're basically a little bit better

[14:37] but I actually used to have terrible terrible terrible breathing

[14:39] I still kind of do, which is why I wear these patches

[14:40] which cover in a second.

[14:41] And so we did that for a while, I got my sleep thing fixed

[14:44] and this is one of those tradeoffs

[14:46] where like technically we should continue

[14:47] to sleep in separate bedrooms.

[14:49] But life wise, Lailon prefers me to be a better.

[14:51] And so that is what we do.

[14:53] So these are all, like I said,

[14:55] these are not half-tos, these are like,

[14:57] would be nice if you can do it as one time fix.

[14:59] All right, so those are the nine environmental hacks.

[15:02] Now, you might be like, well, what do I take from this?

[15:04] I do all the stuff I just mentioned except

[15:06] I don't have any plans because I don't like life.

[15:08] I want death to scare me in the face

[15:09] if I'm gonna have to forget about.

[15:10] I just haven't got around to it

[15:11] but there's plenty of research suggests

[15:14] I don't do the way to blank it right now.

[15:15] I think it's because we moved in,

[15:17] I just didn't take the blank with me.

[15:18] When I slept in my own bed, I had a way to blank it.

[15:21] It's just been kind of annoying with Lailons

[15:23] and it's like, it's just kind of a pain

[15:25] and I need a lever one that she does.

[15:26] And so like, logistically for me,

[15:28] it was a pain so that's why I don't do it.

[15:29] But I do, it is beneficial and it does help, I think.

[15:31] It also makes you move less because it's just heavy.

[15:34] And so it kind of keeps you more still

[15:36] which I think is helpful as well.

[15:37] We don't sleep in separate beds

[15:38] because a person or a surgery like I mentioned.

[15:41] And I do have my phone in the room.

[15:43] All right, but I don't have all the other lights.

[15:44] I do all the black-out stuff, all the cold stuff,

[15:45] all the other things I just said we do.

[15:47] I do have my phone in the room though.

[15:48] But there aren't like alarm clock lights or anything else

[15:51] and my phone is down against the thing.

[15:53] And I probably shouldn't do it,

[15:54] but I haven't had any sleep in.

[15:55] So that goes to show you that you can just get half the shit

[15:58] right and still be fine.

[15:59] Okay, so beliefs and environment.

[16:01] Check, check, one, two.

[16:02] Going to number three, which is intake.

[16:04] This one will be fun.

[16:05] These are all the things you get to do to your body

[16:07] and vibe yourself.

[16:08] All right, number one, if you have supplements

[16:10] and things like that that you want to take,

[16:11] but next to your bed or buy your toothbrush,

[16:13] it's the easiest way that I have found

[16:16] to not have to forget this stuff

[16:17] because I am inherently, I tend to be a forgetful person.

[16:19] All right, all right, I just don't remember

[16:21] what things are supposed to probably shit.

[16:22] Okay, so I use sleep multipliers,

[16:24] product-by-pusty labs.

[16:25] I probably should have a link below.

[16:26] I used to own majority of the company.

[16:28] I still continue to take the product.

[16:29] It's exceptional.

[16:30] If you are the type of person who tracks it,

[16:32] take it for 30 days and look at your sleep source

[16:33] before and after.

[16:34] And for everyone, it's not a sedative.

[16:36] All right, you're not gonna like immediately take

[16:37] and just like pass out.

[16:38] But what you will notice is that your average sleep

[16:41] scores on a 30-day rolling period will be better.

[16:44] I guarantee it, all right.

[16:45] I guess I don't know.

[16:46] I'm not the majority of the company, so I can say that,

[16:49] but it is expensive, but it is 100% worth it.

[16:52] It is so, so, so worth it.

[16:54] What do you pay for, like people buy courses,

[16:57] they buy all these things when you could spend three bucks a day

[17:00] and have 20% increased output because you sleep better.

[17:02] Like to me, it's not even a question.

[17:04] Let's get to the things that we're gonna try

[17:05] and how prevent from things that fragment sleep.

[17:07] So, peeing, a lot of people get up in the middle night,

[17:09] one, two, three times to pee.

[17:11] So, here is where we can actually nip this in the butt.

[17:13] I used to do this.

[17:14] So, like, let me help.

[17:15] Number one, you can take salt tabs before you go to bed.

[17:18] All right, so if you take, if you have salt tabs next to your bed,

[17:20] you can take them and I drink it with Gatorid Zero rather

[17:23] than water because they're salt in there as well.

[17:24] And what it happens is it constricts the amount of water.

[17:27] You like you blow it, right?

[17:28] But the thing is, is like, don't worry,

[17:29] like if you get on a cycle, you'll pee it out,

[17:31] you're not gonna look bloated.

[17:32] All right.

[17:33] But what happens is it will restrict the amount

[17:34] that you'll pee for a short period of time.

[17:36] All right, and so you might actually be able to make it

[17:37] through the night without having to pee

[17:38] if you take the extra salt.

[17:39] All right, that's kind of the idea.

[17:40] All right, so the Gatorid water.

[17:42] And as a side note, and this is something

[17:43] that I've just developed over time

[17:45] is like, I eat at the same time every day.

[17:46] So I eat my breakfast at the same time,

[17:47] I lunch at the same time, I eat dinner at the same time.

[17:49] And the more you can get in the habit,

[17:50] the more regular, your digestion gets,

[17:52] the more regular, bowel movements get.

[17:53] But also, as a result of that,

[17:54] you have less variety, which comes down to,

[17:59] you sleep better because there's less like,

[18:00] kind of variables that are affecting your sleep.

[18:02] Right?

[18:03] So if you have anyone's had like crazy in digestion

[18:04] because you had really hot tie one night,

[18:06] and you had it too hours later than you normally do,

[18:08] when you're not probably not gonna sleep as well.

[18:09] And that's just like, is this tie really worth that?

[18:11] I don't know, maybe it is, maybe it's not.

[18:13] But if it like sets you back like a dare to

[18:14] because you can sleep that well,

[18:15] then it's not really worth the tie food.

[18:17] All right, now breathing.

[18:19] And this one is a special section for me

[18:20] because I have struggled with this

[18:21] a ton my whole life since I was an eighth grade,

[18:23] I couldn't breathe that well.

[18:24] So there's three main things that come to breathing.

[18:26] So I'm gonna go a little bit on a tangent here

[18:28] because I've done a lot of work

[18:29] and it's been a lot of money on this stuff.

[18:30] There is your allergies, so your level of congestion,

[18:32] there's the shape of your nostrils, right?

[18:35] And there's the stuff that's inside of it.

[18:37] So you have like the shape of your nostrils,

[18:39] if you have things that are impeding it

[18:40] and then you have congestion, all right?

[18:42] So there's like the three variables.

[18:43] And so if you have, I'm forgetting the name.

[18:46] They're the things that, they're like these globules,

[18:48] I can't remember the name inside of your sinus

[18:51] and your nasal cavity.

[18:54] If you can get those removed surgically,

[18:55] which you can, it'll improve your breathing.

[18:57] I don't know why this got all zooming.

[18:59] Let's see if we can get back here we go.

[19:00] And the easiest thing like besides doing the surgeries

[19:02] and whatnot that you can do

[19:03] is of my cover and this little breathing thing.

[19:05] Okay, no strips.

[19:06] Number one, absolute life-saver, they're awesome.

[19:08] You can look on Amazon, go grab whatever.

[19:10] I'll have the links to the ones that I use.

[19:11] Like the reason I wear these is because I sleep in them

[19:13] and I continue to breathe great in them

[19:15] and that's why I do it.

[19:15] And when I couldn't breathe at all,

[19:17] this is the only way I could sleep.

[19:19] And when I, after the surgery,

[19:21] I went for me to go sleep.

[19:22] Okay, and finish without them

[19:24] and now I just sleep even better with it.

[19:25] Now give you a hack that I don't have listed here

[19:28] that if you don't have these or like,

[19:30] let's see you go out and travel

[19:31] and you forgot them or whatever.

[19:32] I'm telling, like, I've been doing this for years.

[19:34] So if you fall asleep, you can fall asleep

[19:36] on your hand like this.

[19:37] And so what happens is that you don't have,

[19:40] you're not actively pulling something,

[19:41] but your thumb is always gonna be straight, right?

[19:43] And so if you fall asleep like this,

[19:44] it actually will keep one of your nostrils out

[19:46] and like that's how I had to sleep

[19:47] for like 10 years before I found out about these strips.

[19:50] All right, highly recommend.

[19:51] Next thing, creams and sprays.

[19:52] So like there are nasal sprays,

[19:55] I think salt sprays work.

[19:56] I don't like doing any kind of drugs and medications stuff

[19:58] because I don't like to be dependent on anything.

[19:59] But if you have those things put those beside your bed,

[20:01] like I said, salt sprays work well

[20:03] and I actually put cream on my face when I remember two.

[20:06] So that hopefully I don't look old and gray in a year.

[20:10] Pepperment oil stuff.

[20:12] I think I just put it on top of my mustache.

[20:14] If you put it too close inside the rim, it starts to burn.

[20:16] So I just put it right on my, on my stash, on my upper lip

[20:19] and that seems to work okay for me.

[20:20] And now I only use that now

[20:22] and like extreme situations, I don't normally.

[20:24] And then netty pods for people who like that thing

[20:27] work well for people from a breathing perspective.

[20:29] But for me, the big one is the nasal strips

[20:32] and how I sleep for breathing.

[20:34] Okay, now those are the things that you can start doing.

[20:37] But you're like, man, Alex, this sounds like a lot of stuff

[20:38] to start doing.

[20:39] Well let me tell you things you can stop doing.

[20:40] Number one, and this is a huge one,

[20:42] especially with entrepreneurs.

[20:43] We love the stems, I get it.

[20:44] But try and cut it after 10 a.m.

[20:46] So like, don't drink them after 10.

[20:49] It will affect your sleep.

[20:50] We were like, oh, I can drink a zillion things

[20:52] of caffeine to pass right out.

[20:53] It means that you were completely like your,

[20:55] it means that you're not receptive to them anymore,

[20:57] which means you're like not getting the adrenal boost

[20:59] that you want from it and you have become sensitized to it.

[21:01] Because you have such rolling amounts of caffeine

[21:03] in your system at all times that you never even get it out.

[21:05] All right, so you have to, you have to,

[21:07] you have to pull the plug on this

[21:08] because the half life of caffeine is six hours.

[21:11] Half life.

[21:12] So let's say you take a gram of caffeine

[21:14] that's a thousand milligrams, it's a lot of caffeine.

[21:16] Six hours later, you have 500.

[21:17] That's still a lot of caffeine.

[21:19] Six hours later, you have 250.

[21:21] Still a lot of caffeine that's two coffee cups.

[21:23] Six hours later, right?

[21:24] You have 120, which is one cup of coffee.

[21:26] But now we've already done half life, six, six, six, six.

[21:28] So this is four, six is 24 hours.

[21:29] We already covered a day and you still have a cup of coffee

[21:31] in your system.

[21:32] So you have to think about the half life of the thing

[21:34] that you're drinking.

[21:35] So if you drink a cup of coffee in the morning,

[21:36] 12 hours later, it'll be at a quarter of what you were.

[21:39] So if you had 120, you have 30 milligrams of caffeine

[21:42] still in your system.

[21:42] All right, 12 hours later.

[21:44] And if you're sleeping 18 hours later,

[21:45] what you should be, right?

[21:47] Should using loosely here for ideal sleep scenarios.

[21:49] That means that you're now at 15 milligrams,

[21:51] which for most people would be okay.

[21:53] And so that's why how much you take throughout the day,

[21:56] even the timing thing, like if you take a gram in the morning,

[21:58] it will affect your sleep at night

[21:59] because the half life is still like taking 500 milligrams,

[22:03] six hours later.

[22:04] Think about this when you're thinking about stimulants altogether.

[22:07] If you're one of those people's troubles sleeping,

[22:09] I would say I would suggest trying not to do it

[22:11] and suffer for the five days

[22:13] and then restart, you know, reticulate your sleeping habits.

[22:16] All right, number two, have your last meal two hours before bed.

[22:19] I covered this with a peeing thing, but like just don't.

[22:21] The E-ripe before bed, you'll usually have to do

[22:23] some more bowel stuff, or P, or whatever,

[22:25] and it also can affect your digestion.

[22:26] It can increase your body temperature,

[22:28] all those things if you do it right before bed.

[22:30] Number three, stop drinking out with them four hours of bed.

[22:32] So ideally, if you're gonna drink,

[22:34] do it as a day party, rather than going late into the night.

[22:37] And as a side note, you actually end up being more hungover

[22:39] from the fact that you fucked up your sleep

[22:41] more than the alcohol anyways.

[22:42] But as a side note, there's tons of stuff on alcohol.

[22:44] You probably already know that, but just as a reminder.

[22:46] And then stop drinking a link with their alcohol

[22:48] going a bit, right?

[22:49] Like if you do that, then you can ideally,

[22:51] you front load all your drinking in the morning,

[22:52] so when you wake up, drink a bunch of water.

[22:54] And then that way, you drink less over the day

[22:56] and you pee more.

[22:57] So your balance between drinking and peeing,

[23:00] drink a lot more than you peeing the beginning of the day,

[23:02] and then you drink less and less and less

[23:04] and pee throughout the end of the day.

[23:05] So that overnight, you wake up, and then you're really thirsty,

[23:08] and then you do it again, right?

[23:09] You don't want to slip that habit, where you drink a ton

[23:11] right before you go to bed, and then you're peeing all

[23:12] while you're trying to sleep, and then you wake up,

[23:14] and then you don't drink right?

[23:15] So just flip the cycle in the night thing

[23:16] as you start, once you start doing this once,

[23:18] it's very easy to stick with,

[23:19] because your body will just do it naturally.

[23:20] Number five, avoid medicines that delay,

[23:22] we're disrupt your sleep.

[23:23] All right, so a lot of these different things

[23:25] can disrupt your sleep pattern.

[23:26] So like, that's why I don't like taking anti-stimming things,

[23:29] or things, I just don't like taking meds

[23:30] in general on a regular basis before bed.

[23:32] This is not medical advice, not a medical doctor,

[23:34] all the stuff you already know.

[23:36] I'm saying these are things that have worked well for me,

[23:38] and I try not to become dependent on anything.

[23:39] My two cents, I do everything that I just mentioned,

[23:42] except I only have the meds all for extremely circumstances,

[23:44] and I don't use a nutty pot, because I hate it,

[23:46] and it burns my nose, and I'm a bitch, okay.

[23:49] That's that.

[23:50] Co.

[23:51] So beliefs, environment, intake, check, check, check, check.

[23:54] Number four is the habits.

[23:56] So there are 13 habits that we're going to cover,

[23:59] and let's rock and roll with them.

[24:01] So number one, I should have made these as stepwise,

[24:04] but I guess I left the soul as step.

[24:05] And sleep at least 20 minutes, preferably 30 minutes,

[24:08] get in now of total sunlight during the day, if you can,

[24:10] and I think this is great for a work break thing,

[24:12] like after you eat lunch, go walk, right?

[24:14] It's an easy thing to do.

[24:15] Go walk and talk, take fun calls, whatever it works.

[24:18] Take short work before bed.

[24:19] I like this from, I usually walk after I eat.

[24:21] So just FYI, after I eat lunch and after I dinner,

[24:23] I walk, and that's kind of my jam.

[24:25] And so that's an easy way to implement this.

[24:27] From a workout perspective, don't work out two hours

[24:29] before you go to bed because your body temperature

[24:31] stays elevated for up to two hours.

[24:32] So don't do that, or you will mess up your sleep.

[24:35] Screen's off, this is just a general reminder,

[24:36] yet again, from a habit perspective.

[24:38] All right, two hours before bed.

[24:39] Now, I'll tell you the stuff that I do

[24:41] versus don't do in these habits,

[24:42] but these are the things that generally,

[24:43] I have collected over my years as things

[24:45] that have helped me sleep better, so I could make more dollars.

[24:47] Number five, go to bed between 9 and 11,

[24:49] and send a alarm.

[24:50] So here's a common one that people don't do.

[24:52] Is that people love to have wake up alarms,

[24:54] so they don't have to go to bed alarms.

[24:56] You should have a good bed alarm and not wake up alarm.

[24:58] If you have the right to go to bed alarm,

[24:59] you will wake up naturally at the time that you should wake up.

[25:01] I know, crazy.

[25:02] And so if you need more sleep,

[25:03] you'll sleep more, and then you'll be in less sleep,

[25:04] you'll sleep less, right?

[25:05] Beautiful thing about the body.

[25:07] All right, and as a side note with napping,

[25:08] and I'm a fan, I am somebody who likes to nap.

[25:10] It's fine, try not to nap after two o'clock,

[25:13] and try not to nap for longer than 30 minutes

[25:15] because we're messed up up.

[25:16] So for me, I set my timer at 20,

[25:18] and I know that I go into the thing with the mindset that,

[25:21] if I don't fall asleep at all,

[25:22] then I have my eyes closed in a dark room for 20 minutes.

[25:25] I get 90% of the benefits without even having to go to sleep,

[25:27] which actually ends up decreasing my anxiety

[25:29] on the sleeping overall,

[25:30] and then I end up actually falling asleep in like five seconds.

[25:32] The next seven, and I probably should have gotten the numbers

[25:34] to start at eight, but Soviet.

[25:36] If you can't sleep in your back,

[25:38] it's much better from like not messing up your shoulders

[25:41] and stuff, especially if you're a bigger guy,

[25:43] it's like side and back are better than front

[25:46] because you're all like, split out.

[25:48] So like I said, I try and use my hand to keep my nose up

[25:51] and if we're just talking about sleeping positions,

[25:52] and then slide the face off the side of the pillow,

[25:54] so you can tuck your pillow,

[25:56] so like smashes your face like this,

[25:57] and you can breathe better.

[25:58] Sleeping naked, for comfort and temperature,

[26:00] that should be soft.

[26:01] It also helps with number three,

[26:02] which is only sleep insects in the sleeping room.

[26:04] Each in the eating rooms, work in the working rooms.

[26:06] Ideally, you can separate the types of activities

[26:08] that you're doing in the room

[26:09] because you will carry over the anxiety of the activities

[26:12] that you do in that room, they will anchor the room for you.

[26:14] Now you're like, what if I go in a hotel

[26:15] and I work in a sleep and I eat all in the same hotel room?

[26:18] Short-term long-term, 8020.

[26:20] If you're doing it for the short-term,

[26:21] it's happens, it's okay, don't worry about it,

[26:23] but like long-term, we're gonna make it happen

[26:24] so that we can increase our overall effectiveness

[26:27] then it's worth doing.

[26:29] All right, or delineating, excuse me.

[26:31] If you can have an orgasm before bed,

[26:32] sleep in naked helps doing that, too,

[26:34] and it does improve your quality sleep,

[26:35] which is great, which for so have a partner with you, right?

[26:39] Go, orgasm together, play with friend.

[26:41] All right, number five, taking hot shower,

[26:43] or bathroom or bed, decreases in turn,

[26:45] a body temperature, when you get out of it,

[26:47] you're fall asleep faster

[26:47] because the decrease in core temperature induces sleep.

[26:49] Makes sense, right?

[26:50] Cool, meditate for a few minutes.

[26:52] I don't do this, I'm gonna cover all the stuff

[26:54] that I do in a second, but for some people,

[26:56] they like it a lot, so do it.

[26:57] And try and unwind before you sleep.

[26:58] If you got something you can do

[27:00] if you read a book, whatever,

[27:01] I don't think that working all the way

[27:02] until the moment you sleep is good for me personally.

[27:04] I pretty much stop working after dinner,

[27:06] so I work until dinner, then that's after I eat,

[27:09] I'm pretty much done.

[27:10] So just people last month of the time,

[27:11] so that's the answer.

[27:12] All right, and so everything that I just said,

[27:15] I do, except for the screen's off thing,

[27:17] I'm not perfect, and I don't do that.

[27:20] The hot shower before bed or the meditation, either.

[27:23] And that is because I haven't had any issues with sleeping,

[27:27] but if you are one of these people,

[27:28] like do more of that stuff,

[27:29] and then you can start removing things

[27:30] that are like have the lower input for you, right?

[27:32] Bottom line, if you're an entrepreneur,

[27:34] and you're trying to make more dollars,

[27:35] and you wanna have lower emotional reactivity,

[27:37] when you have a higher quality of decisions,

[27:39] higher intelligence, higher ability to learn less,

[27:41] more adaptability in general, sleeping is important.

[27:43] The beliefs that I can share to the beginning

[27:45] of the things that have served me well,

[27:46] these environmental traits, the intake differences,

[27:49] and the habits that I mentioned,

[27:50] are the things that have served me well,

[27:51] and I wanted to put them all in one video,

[27:53] so that I would never have to answer the question again,

[27:56] besides saying, watch this video,

[27:57] this covers everything that I know about sleeping

[27:59] that I do in my real life for everyone else,

[28:02] go to sleep, or watch the next video.

[28:04] And like I said,

[28:05] Moseenation, love you guys, and I'll see you soon.

[28:07] Bye.

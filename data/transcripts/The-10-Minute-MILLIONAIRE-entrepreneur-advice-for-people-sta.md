[00:00] In this video, I'm going to walk you through the best way in my opinion to pick the niche that you're going to focus on to start your business.

[00:06] So I asked my Instagram, you know, one of some of the questions that you have.

[00:09] And this one came up a lot, which was like, how do I pick my customer?

[00:12] How do I pick the niche? Like, what's the process, et cetera?

[00:14] And so I've seen my book this guy, it's 99 cents on Amazon.

[00:18] For those of you guys who don't know, like, it's not 99 cents.

[00:21] The Kindle is 99 cents because it digital the hard copy.

[00:24] Amazon changed the prices, but you can get a hardback where you can get the digital one for 99 cents.

[00:28] It's at the lowest they let me sell for. All right. Anyhow.

[00:30] So picking the niche, I think this is something that's like wildly misunderstood.

[00:34] And I'll tell you where most people get wrong is that they pick a niche and they have nothing

[00:38] idea about the niche. All right. And so why commentator, which is a venture, it's like an incubator type thing.

[00:44] And so it kind of value. They have their things that they look for when they're investing businesses

[00:48] and they're accepting them into YC. And one of the ones that was really interesting to me is that

[00:52] they look for past experience within the space. And because I think a big part of that is that a lot of times new businesses

[00:59] are not actually really new, they're slight iterations on things that are old.

[01:02] And candidly, within my own business experience, I don't even do anything now.

[01:06] I just try and do stuff better, which people somehow poo poo on.

[01:09] It's like you go into dry cleaning and do it better than everybody else and still win.

[01:13] Like you go to lawn care and do it better than everyone else, it's still win.

[01:16] And I think that's wildly underrated. You don't need anything new.

[01:19] And so like I think that is a wildly underestimated component of having strategy and businesses

[01:23] to like how am I going to use the value equation that both I combat and five more value

[01:27] of my customers than anyone else can. But like the actual industry itself that your serving

[01:31] doesn't need to be newer, different, right? So that being set, like servers with this mile,

[01:34] while they're underrated. But the the piece that I wanted to hit on here is that like,

[01:37] I'll tell you this story because I think it really drives this point home. So in Alan,

[01:41] our software company that we recently sold a majority stake in, one of the agency owners,

[01:45] you know, for nine months, it's just like never making progress. Right? Like it was always

[01:48] hopping on. It was always having issues and he was like, he's clients were getting results.

[01:51] He was like, how do I get around that? And I was like, you don't need to fix that. And

[01:54] um, the guys at the point where I just said, listen, man, like, you don't know what you're doing,

[01:58] which is why your clients are getting results. Period. He said, well, I've got this one guy who

[02:02] does, you make so this money using our, you know, using the leads that we get him. And I was like,

[02:06] okay, well, why is he getting making money? The other was aren't he's like, well, I don't know.

[02:10] And I was like, right. So that's not because of you. That's because of him. And so what I told him to do,

[02:15] which was wild at the time, I said, I need you. I think that you should close your agency.

[02:19] I was like, I don't think you know anything about real estate. I said, I think that if you know how

[02:23] to get real estate leads, then you should go get your reals or slices. Go generate your own leads

[02:28] and go build a real estate business and learn it. And then once you have succeeded in doing that,

[02:33] then if you want to, then go make the agency and show the people how to do it because you've actually

[02:37] done it. And so there's a tweet by Laila my wife, she said, like, stop listening to people,

[02:42] about like, sorry, so I've listed people about how to play the game who've never been anywhere

[02:46] with the sidelines. And the problem is too many of the people who were watching this right now, y'all

[02:50] are on the sidelines and have always been on the sidelines and are trying to pick a niche to get into

[02:55] to sell how to do the niche. Well, that's dumb. You've never done it. So a lot of times people are trying

[03:00] to skip to a higher-level job opportunity without having done the requisite work of understanding the

[03:04] niche, which is why the by-commonator people look for like, if you want to make a software in the

[03:08] payment space, we'd love to see that you have experience in the payment space because there's so much

[03:11] stuff that you don't know that you know when you actually spent three, five, you know, years

[03:15] doing something in an industry. You understand the lingo, you understand the avatar, you understand

[03:19] the problems. And you can see opportunities if you have an entrepreneurial hat on. There's always

[03:23] problems in every industry, which means there's always opportunity. And fundamentally, business is

[03:28] just solving problems that exist and making sure the math makes sense. Like, that's literally it.

[03:32] It's like, where is there a problem? How much do they think this is a problem? And is there

[03:36] a way that I can solve it? And charge for it? That's it. Like, that's really all the business is.

[03:40] And really, how about you solve the problem is going to dictate how much viability your business

[03:44] has because if you solve it really well, people will tell people and your business will grow.

[03:48] Right? I think the problem that a lot of people have is they didn't know how to make it

[03:50] off. Right? It's the fundamental thing that is the beginning of building a business as you

[03:54] got to know what you're selling. And so that was a problem for a lot of people. And then people

[03:57] got that problem. So I'll do it and then they told their friends and book so 100,000 copies and six

[04:00] months with no promotion. And so I'm only sharing this because I couldn't write a book on offers

[04:05] without having made it to the offers. And I feel like there's two often people who are trying to

[04:09] focus on a niche who've never actually done the thing in the niche. And this is really, really rampant

[04:13] in the internet space because everyone's trying to take a shortcut to get there when they real

[04:17] a lot like when I'm telling you right now you're never going to get there because you're not going to

[04:20] know. Like, you're never going to get there because you're not going to have to do the Rocky

[04:24] cut scene. You have to eat the shit for a period of time so that you can get the rep since so you can

[04:27] put your time into the bar in so that you can actually get good. And before you are good, you will suck.

[04:32] And you have to accept long-care of sucking and you do enough volume that eventually you'll

[04:35] suck so little that you'll actually be good. And then at that point, then you'll actually have a

[04:39] real decision to make, which is I'm actually really good at this thing now that I've learned.

[04:42] Do I want to teach it to other people or just want to do more of the thing that I'm doing?

[04:45] Right? Because like a real circuit and then just grow a team of 100 real servers and only entire

[04:49] thing which is what I'd recommend this guy do. Right? Rather than having agency, um, that doesn't.

[04:53] Right? And so this is kind of where I think the problem is is that like I had another question that

[04:58] was sent to me on Instagram, which is like, hey, how do I soft turn? There's a lot of my

[05:01] lot of my clients are getting results and I'm like, well duh. He said, how do I see

[05:06] up from 10,000,000 a month when I don't have a lot of testimonies? I was like, you're not good

[05:12] at the thing that you're supposed to be good at. I'm trying to have testimonials. Why are you not

[05:15] going to 100,000 a month? Like, these make in the goal 100,000 a month rather than being good.

[05:21] I have no words. I have no words. I don't get it. You know what I mean? Like,

[05:26] everyone's in such a fucking rush that you will never get there. It is the smallest path

[05:30] to getting there, is to fool yourself and the thing you're good, so you're not. You have to go

[05:34] and pull the thread and say, which and the thing is to like, well, do what you're passionate about.

[05:38] Whatever. You're not going to be passionate about stuff that you suck at. What you have to do is

[05:41] like, which of these opportunities seem like they have potentially a high leverage and I'm going to

[05:45] learn from the bottom. Right? It's like one of the best ways to learn stuff if you're starting

[05:48] the bottom, not because because it's the only opportunity, but because if you understand the entire

[05:52] pathway of a client journey or of an industry journey, then you will have more trench knowledge,

[05:58] more depth of experience that you will be then able to apply. People see my videos on personal finance,

[06:05] people see videos of mine on sales, people see videos of mine recruiting, people see videos of mine

[06:08] of marketing and it's like, how do you acquire these skills? It's because like, I just not

[06:12] like as I tried to jump to the spot that I'm at. You can't skip like there's a sequence.

[06:16] Buildings are built with foundations and your career is a pyramid and the peak of that pyramid is

[06:21] based on the depth of the foundation that you build. And so like I've said this before and I'll say it

[06:26] again, but your work works on you more than you work on it. And so even though you might not be

[06:29] getting paid in the period that you're at, just because you're struggling doesn't mean you're family.

[06:32] And it means, and the thing is, as long as you're getting better, you're making progress in the

[06:36] progress is the success is that you are getting better and like you will turn the corner. Like that's

[06:40] an inevitability if you put enough time in the period. I promise you that. If you don't stop

[06:44] doing something for 10 years, you'll be really good at it. Period. And if you're really good at it,

[06:47] you'll like doing it. And if you like doing it, then at that point you won't wonder why your

[06:51] business is making money because you actually should be good. And then you won't have these questions.

[06:55] But the questions that I get, I'll say a third of them come from a very short time run. It's like

[06:58] why I'm on out of millionaire. It's been, it's been 90 days in Alex. What the hell? It's like, well,

[07:03] you didn't put the five years in. So if you're trying to figure out what nature you're going to pick,

[07:07] the point is to just pick and then accept that you're not going to be overwhelmingly successful

[07:11] for like five years. Every entrepreneur, like that I know of, puts five years in before, before anything

[07:17] really happens. And you're like, fuck five years, probably shouldn't tell new entrepreneurs that. Yes,

[07:21] you're going to be very successful, very quickly. You should put your job in debt. It takes a long time

[07:25] to learn because there's a lot of stuff you got to know. You got to know how to generate things. You got

[07:29] to know how to work leads. You know, I got to know how to set up points. You got to learn how to close.

[07:32] You got to learn how to set up backgrounds. You got to learn how to translate. You got to learn how to

[07:36] do billing. You got to learn how to do payroll. You got to like, you got to learn how to actually

[07:39] fulfill a product. You'll know how to learn how to create a customer journey. You got to learn how to

[07:42] send people. You got to learn how to decrease your journey. You got to like, there's a lot of stuff. You got to

[07:45] get to learn how to recruit. You got to learn how to hire. You got to like, there's a lot of stuff that you

[07:48] got to learn. And so to think that it's somehow going to take 90 days, it's like, why do you think that you

[07:52] can get a chemistry degree in four years and think you can somehow become a masters in entrepreneurship

[07:57] in 90 days? It doesn't, it doesn't give respect to the game. You have to respect the game. Like a lot

[08:02] of people have been playing this for 40 years. No one's getting their masters degree for 40 years. Well,

[08:07] some PhDs are right and they're probably pretty good at whatever their thing is. Right? And so it's like

[08:10] to think that you're going to beat guys who can play in the same game for 40 years on your first

[08:14] try 90 days doesn't respect the game. And so like I was fortunate that I started young. I started

[08:19] one of 23. I mean, the only thing I could have done before that, dude, without doing that is just

[08:23] start instead of going to college. But you have to, you have to put your time into the bar. Your legs

[08:28] aren't going to grow until you like, you can't do four squat workouts and expect your legs to grow.

[08:32] You'll get better at squatting and then getting better at squatting is a requisite for having bigger

[08:35] legs but you still got up at the volume. There's a depth of understanding that happens with

[08:38] the volume that people cannot appreciate. You got to do the boring work and you got to love the

[08:42] boring work. And if you can do that, you won't lose because the only person who's injecting this

[08:47] artifice of time on you is you. And so anyways, it was like one of the more questions that I was

[08:51] getting in my comments and stuff is like how do you pick the nish, how do you know where to start?

[08:55] You don't know where to start. You just start and then you start accumulating knowledge and then

[08:58] you will learn. It's like reading books on sales before you've actually had a sales call. I'm actually

[09:03] very against it. I think you should start selling and then read books sales because then the books will

[09:07] actually make sense to you. Right? Like trying to read a hundred books on entrepreneurship before you've

[09:11] actually had a business is silly. Start a business. How do you start a business? You get a bank account,

[09:15] get an LLC and you figure out what you're going to stop. Like that's what that's what you do.

[09:19] Right? That's how you start a business. So it's going to start with promotion and selling because

[09:22] you can't even have the rest of the stuff until you learn how to do that. And if you don't know

[09:25] what you're selling, it's because you're probably regretting the thing yet so you gotta go like get some

[09:28] industry experience. Right? That's why it banks by the way. They don't loan to people who don't have

[09:32] industry experience. So if you're like, hey, I want to get a loan to this was actually a story

[09:36] I heard from Jim Lunder and I ended up working with this for a period of time. I didn't

[09:39] Jim Lunder was he wanted to start a gym and get a loan from the bank and he went to like 10 banks

[09:44] and they all said no. And they said he said the reason was because he did not experience. So what he did was

[09:48] he went to Bally's and worked at Bally's for like three or four years and worked his way up to

[09:54] you become the personal training manager and then at that point started his gym and he didn't even

[09:58] need the bank loan at that point because he'd save some money and he learned how the business worked

[10:02] and loan behold he was like now some of the best advice I ever had. So sometimes you just got to

[10:05] get the industry experience. People just want to skip to the last step when like there are pre-requisites

[10:10] to getting there which is probably pre-requisites exist. So this is hopefully the real answer to how to

[10:16] pick your niche which is like you just need to do something that is at least not, you know,

[10:20] repelled from that you see people making money and then stick with it for an in-ordinated amount of

[10:25] time without convincing yourself that you're smarter than you are which is a loose paraphrasing

[10:29] of a Twitter quote that can't remember who wrote it. So anyways if you're new I don't know if I said

[10:33] that at the beginning but my name is Oxamosae Onaakasishinaka. About 85 million dollars a year and

[10:37] this is your first video. Welcome to Mose Nation and I'll see you next vid. Bye!

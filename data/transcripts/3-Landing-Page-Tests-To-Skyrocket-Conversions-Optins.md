[00:00] What's going on everyone entrepreneurs and business owners, my name is Alex Ramosi,

[00:04] I'm a CEO of Allen, Prestige Labs, Jim launch and a number of other pro-photo companies that we own.

[00:10] What I want to give you today is one very, very simple hack that we've used to consistently improve our marketing.

[00:17] Neil Patel said in one of his keynote speeches that he believes that the future of marketing is going to exist in CRRR,

[00:23] so conversion rate optimization.

[00:25] And he said that because the prices are going to only consistently go up and it's most platforms are based on an auction,

[00:30] which means that it's just multiple businesses competing for the same eyeballs.

[00:33] And so the people who are better able to convert those eyeballs are only the ones who are going to be able to out-competient win.

[00:38] Obviously the model of price points are the other stuff matters, but the conversion rate and of itself matters a lot too.

[00:43] Now, there's a lot of parts in a pipeline that exists from acquisition,

[00:46] but what I want to do is just give you one thing from today's video that you can immediately implement and it's simple that has worked and made us a lot of money.

[00:54] All right, the process is simple. Every week, what we do is we have our marketing meeting and we do one split test.

[01:03] Just one.

[01:05] All right, and that's because everyone wants to test 100 things, but what it does is it forces us to be very, very focused on the one thing that we think is going to drive the highest result for us.

[01:16] And the thing is is that when you do this every single week for 52 weeks in a row and you do that for five years,

[01:21] your process just gets better and better and better. And those increases in conversion compound.

[01:27] All right, and so when we are running splits tests on marketing, especially for paid advertising, I'll give you the two biggest things that we look at.

[01:35] All right, the first thing that sounds obvious and simple, but people don't do it.

[01:39] If we simply split test the headlines on our lending pages, that's it. We simply split test the headlines.

[01:48] The next thing that we'll split test is going to be the image that is underneath of that line.

[01:54] All right, because what we've seen from the vast majority of all of the tests that we've done is that almost all of the juice that's going to come the biggest jumps in conversion rate,

[02:05] happened above the fold. And so when I say above the fold, it means like when you go on your desk, desktop and you go to a blinding page.

[02:10] Everything that you can see before scrolling is above the fold. When you go to your phone and you blend and you load a page, everything you see that's immediately available on the screen is above the fold.

[02:21] And so that is where you're selling them on whether they're going to stay on the page and continue to read more, and that's where the biggest returns will come from.

[02:29] All right, and so we will split test almost every week that the majority of our test will be, I would say 90% of our tests are either headline or image tests.

[02:39] And that's it. That's literally it. Sometimes, you know, we'll actually, because if we're changing a headline and the image doesn't make sense, we'll do, you know, a new headline and image against it against the old headline image and image.

[02:51] But that will be the entirety of the test. And so if you can implement this one process into your marketing cadence, so when you meet with your marketing team or if you're hopefully, you know, if you're just doing the marketing for yourself,

[03:01] if you set this cadence on your own calendar of every Monday, we meet and we say, what was last week's test? What was the winner? Great.

[03:08] Did we beat the control? If we didn't beat the control, then we tried to their test, right? And the thing is, when you do this on a continuous basis, the business will continually improve.

[03:17] And so there's a million things you can do, but what are the few things that you should do that are going to drive the biggest result?

[03:23] Because ultimately, all of us have the same amount of time every day. And so the people who make the best decisions to focus on the fewest variables that make the biggest difference, right?

[03:30] One of the biggest things that drives me nuts is when someone says, you know, I said we should do that ages ago, right?

[03:37] Which is one of the things, by the way, for my team, if anything, was listening, please don't do that. It drives me nuts.

[03:41] There's a million things that we should do, right? We should probably be better about our follow up. We should probably be doing more email marketing.

[03:48] We should probably be making more content. Well, obviously, but what of all of the things that we can do, given the resources, time, effort and human capital that we have in money, are going to drive the biggest result?

[03:59] And so when I think about all the different things that we can prove in our marketing standpoint, just doing this one thing will consistently yield better returns in terms of time and effort.

[04:08] And the amount of time it takes to do this and the amount of return we get from it is disproportionate.

[04:13] And I see even a lot of experienced marketers and business owners who don't do this, you know what I mean? And I'm like, that's crazy. You know, why would you not do that?

[04:22] And so, simple process you can outline, focus on everything above the fold, usually headlines, sub-headline image.

[04:28] Those are the things that are going to be the things that drive the biggest, to conversion optimization and, you know, use this in the business, see the results for yourself, and keep being awesome.

[04:37] And I'll catch you guys on flipside. Bye!

[00:00] Bernardarneau became the richest man in the world and what's crazy is he only sells to 1% of the population

[00:05] You may not have heard of Bernardarneau, but I guarantee you've heard of his companies

[00:08] Lou Vitante, Christian de York, Celine, Sephora, DKNY, Bulgaria, Juvence, Tiffany,

[00:14] Hennessey, Mark, Jacob, while the tech billionaires in everyone's network have plummeted

[00:19] Elon Musk lost $200 billion, based on his lost 70, he only lost 7. His business model is recession fruit

[00:27] The man who selling $10,000 per se is there are some lessons that we can learn from the richest

[00:31] man in the world to the first thing we have to understand is the psychology of the rich versus

[00:35] the psychology of the poor the first encounter I had with like super well I remember I was working

[00:40] it's moody king I was a blender tender one of my buddies, he's in the back with this

[00:43] feet up he's flipping through a magazine he's like dude check this out this guy bought a $50,000

[00:48] burger man that's crazy who it's been $50,000 on a burger I thought about it more and more if I

[00:53] go and get lunch the cost me 12 bucks to the burger and the fries and the cook whatever he had said

[00:57] it was some finance guy who had made like $100 million in a year if he made $100 million

[01:02] and he worked $2,000 he made $50,000 an hour I was making $7 an hour and my burger cost me 12 bucks

[01:10] his $50,000 burger was cheaper for him for his amount of money that he was making than my $12

[01:18] lunch was for me that was a huge shift for me where I realized I'm playing this game wrong

[01:23] and I'm not empathizing with the rich because she's got to be thinking differently than I am to be

[01:27] able to afford a $50,000 burger it also kind of makes sense for him the second is how we create

[01:32] products that specifically serve rich people they think differently and want different things the

[01:37] best thing to do is study luxury brands when you shop at a high-end store they'll offer you champagne

[01:43] money shop you're going to have somebody who's assigned to you moment you walk in the door what can I get for

[01:47] you they can have and deliver that better experience because of the premium and luxury prices they

[01:52] charge if you've ever been to a luxury mall and you see a purse for $10,000 you see a jacket for $50,000

[01:58] and I would urge you to not say those people are ridiculous I can't believe someone would spend

[02:03] money on that what I want you to do is actually empathize with the buyer what kind of person

[02:08] would spend $50,000 on a jacket if I can pick from all jackets and I have so many

[02:13] that the difference between $100 jacket and $50,000 jacket in relative terms is a $10 difference

[02:19] to me and my wealth then I just want the best jacket for an order no capitalized on this so there's

[02:24] four distinct positions you can have in any marketplace you can have bargain which is the absolute

[02:28] cheapest one poor quality poor experience the next is best value this is the difference between

[02:34] a Walmart and a Target target is better value it's got for interlights it's cleaner it's the best

[02:39] value for the buck the third position the marketplace is premium the high end lexis the BMW

[02:44] and then the fourth position the marketplace is luxury where the price has no cap part of the value

[02:51] of the product itself is the cost that people know you paid to get it the Bernardino lives in this

[02:58] luxury bubble it's where people associate their status with the purchase they made typically when

[03:03] you raise prices you decrease volume but in luxury goods when you raise prices you increase how many

[03:09] and that creates this unbelievable amount of profit which is what has now propelled him to be the

[03:13] single richest man in the world rich people have the same problems that poor people do they just want

[03:18] them solved differently the big thing we want is we want to deliver a big dream outcome number two

[03:23] we want them to believe with very high confidence that if they work with us they're going to get

[03:27] what we promised on the bottom side they want it to be incredibly fast as soon as they pay they want

[03:33] to get and then they want to have as little effort and sacrifice is usually possible and with the

[03:37] rich speed and convenience are paramount the money is never an issue it's how much you're going to

[03:43] ask of my time and how painful you're going to make this for me a buddy of mine only services

[03:48] fortune 100 companies and he manages right now $1.2 billion a year in advertising budget and here's

[03:55] what's crazy his advertising agency actually has to front the ad spend if they say hey for this

[04:00] month in December I need to drop 300 million on Facebook ads he has to front the 300 million but the

[04:05] thing is is that he has to do it that way because he needs to be as easy as humanly possible so he

[04:11] actually has to have a revolving credit line in the billions with a bank he charges 6% of all advertising

[04:18] dollars and so when they drop 300 million he gets 6% not bad he gets 18 million bucks just for

[04:24] fronting the cash rich people will always pay for speed the easiest way to appeal to the rich is just

[04:30] do the same thing in half the time whatever the services if it's dry cleaning return it by end of

[04:35] debt if you only have a phone number be the person that can accept anything if they email you

[04:39] shoot you a text if they what's at you if they phone call you can accept anything because you've made

[04:44] it convenient they just want it to be effortless the third is if we know what products in services they

[04:48] want how to price those things appropriately when you solve rich people problems you get to charge

[04:53] rich people prices when you deal with rich people you have unlimited upside which is why they are

[04:59] better customers there's five things you want to talk about from the customer perspective because

[05:03] if you increase the quality of your customers you increase the quality of your business number one

[05:07] when you charge more money for your products or services you get an increased emotional investment

[05:13] if you have a very low cost item people won't even give it the time of day and so when you

[05:18] raise the price you raise their emotional investment and in a real way you actually increase the

[05:23] likelihood of the get results the second way that it'll help your customers is that it will increase

[05:27] their perceived value there was a research study where they had three bottles of wine they had a cheap

[05:32] wine a mid-price wine an expensive one they had people try them out and they had them rank them

[05:37] based on what they thought people said I think the most expensive wine is the best the middle prices

[05:42] the middle and the cheapest wine was the worst and that's not that surprising except when the

[05:47] researchers explain that all three wines were the same when you raise your prices a more expensive

[05:53] thing is perceived in real terms as more valuable even if the actual products are the same the third

[05:59] is results for your customers if you increase their emotional investment you increase their

[06:04] perceived value what ends up happening they actually do get better results when they sound

[06:08] for the gym for personal training versus a $10 a month thing they get better results the

[06:12] fourth thing that happens when you raise your prices you actually attract less demanding customers

[06:18] have you ever seen this meme the customer says well what exactly am I going to be getting for

[06:22] $50 then it has the rich customers like wire set let me know what next steps are

[06:27] anybody who's ever been inclined surfaces can attest to this the higher the price tag the more expensive

[06:32] the contract the fewer payment plans you have to set up the easier the customers to deal with

[06:38] part of the reason that a $50 person is saying well what exactly am I getting if

[06:42] somebody's got a hundred dollars in their bank account you're asking for 50% of their net worth

[06:46] just because someone's willing to pay you doesn't mean that you should take it the fifth benefit

[06:50] that your customers will get as a result of raising your prices is that you actually have more money

[06:55] you can deliver on your promises for them imagine you've got a hard cost thing that costs five bucks

[07:00] and you charge eight bucks we only have three dollars left to run the rest of your business

[07:05] provide service you don't have a lot of room there now imagine you charge $50 for that same

[07:11] five dollar thing you have forty five dollars that you can now use to deliver two three four times

[07:16] the value the customer gets a better experience you can reinvest in your product you can attract

[07:22] higher level talent to your business if you have no margin the best people are going to work for you

[07:28] they're going to go to the real business owner who understands how margin is to work where it's

[07:30] you're sitting here dealing with fires all day because the people haggling over fifty dollars for the

[07:35] best way to sell is having the full conviction that your product is the best the best the best

[07:40] quality and the most elitists product in every line that's where selling roads are well

[07:48] and you can't say your product's the best if you're trying to do it on margin and you don't have

[07:51] the money to reinvest in good people you can't do it when you have all of these higher paying

[07:58] lower demanding happier customers your perception of the real impact you're actually making goes up

[08:04] it becomes this snowball that starts rolling and you have these testimonials and these reviews

[08:09] that start rolling in the momentum builds on the flip side if you don't have that and it becomes

[08:13] this vicious cycle in the other direction where you're not getting these testimonials or you're

[08:16] getting his charge backs and refunds from these demanding customers that had unrealistic expectations

[08:21] because it was such a high percentage of their network there was nothing that was going to save

[08:24] them from themselves there's no advantage to being the second cheapest person in the marketplace

[08:29] but there isn't advantage to being the most expensive

[00:00] Before I met my wife, I never cracked $3 million per year.

[00:03] And after I met my wife, 24 months later, I took over $17 million in personal income.

[00:09] And there are 17 lessons that she taught me.

[00:12] So the first one I learned from her was never stifled a generous impulse.

[00:16] Whether it's a gift or praise, as soon as you think it, send it.

[00:20] And so when I started, you know, my business is early on.

[00:24] I obviously, you know, I got up to about 30 employees between my gyms.

[00:27] Honestly, I was not that good at running it.

[00:28] And it was because I just ran everything off of fear and punishment.

[00:33] And it sounds more malicious than it probably was.

[00:35] That's just kind of how like most small business owners operate.

[00:38] It's kind of like, yell at people when they mess up.

[00:40] And if I'm not talking to you, it means you're doing everything fine.

[00:43] Which is kind of like the opposite of how you want to run a business.

[00:45] Because then that means that you just condition everyone to fear talking to you.

[00:48] Which means when you talk to them, you're only there to punish them.

[00:51] And so then you're employee started avoiding you.

[00:52] And they don't tell you what's going on in the business.

[00:54] And so when Layla came in and she had come from,

[00:57] had two really positive working environments that she worked at before and one really negative one.

[01:01] And she had seen the big contrast.

[01:03] The thing that really motivated her and just transparently has been one of the secret stars success.

[01:08] It's that she's always wanted to have an amazing place to work as in create and foster

[01:11] environment where people feel safe and comfortable and praised for the work they do.

[01:15] And the smart thing about that is that you have kind of two levels of effort that you can

[01:20] unlock in every person.

[01:21] So the first level which is what most people work at which is the minimum amount to not get punished.

[01:26] And so if you punished someone, if they do anything below this then they just go right above that.

[01:31] So they basically do the lawfully stuffer.

[01:33] So they just go right above that just enough to not get punished.

[01:35] And that's how most people live their lives.

[01:36] It's also really own fulfilling kind of sucks.

[01:39] And people don't live their potential in your business as you're only as much as you could.

[01:42] The second level is a completely different fuel that unlocks something that we call a discretionary effort.

[01:47] Which is all of the effort between what someone needs to do just to keep their job.

[01:52] And as much as they possibly could if they did their best.

[01:54] All of that upside is discretionary effort because you wouldn't fire them even at the bottom.

[01:58] But everything else on top of that is kind of like gravy.

[02:01] And so she has been so good at unlocking discretionary effort in all of our teammates because

[02:05] she really genuinely fosters people and coaches them and has very fast feedback loops.

[02:11] We run everything on a project management tool.

[02:14] And so she's in there all day long just being like awesome job.

[02:17] This is great.

[02:18] Keep completing that.

[02:18] This is awesome work.

[02:19] Hey, can you ask me it here.

[02:20] And she's just all day long.

[02:21] So people are getting really fast feedback loops from her constantly for little iterations of work.

[02:26] And so people want to do more things faster because they get more feedback faster from her.

[02:30] So that's number one.

[02:31] On the other level from a grander level, every single employee comes in, fills out a form.

[02:35] And we learn things they like.

[02:36] They don't like favorite food.

[02:38] That kind of stuff.

[02:38] And what's someone does something great.

[02:40] She will immediately find their employee profile.

[02:43] Remember the thing that they said they really liked.

[02:45] And then usually send a gift that's related to it.

[02:46] Whether it's a gift card or an animal or a jersey or whatever the thing is that they kind of like.

[02:51] And it shows people that you really listen to that you care.

[02:54] And the best way to make people think that you care about them is to actually care about them.

[03:01] And Laila does it better than just about anyone.

[03:03] And so I would say that is one of the biggest reasons that we were able to unlock much more

[03:08] operationally complex businesses because people wanted to work.

[03:11] I would say for us but we listened to it for her.

[03:14] And they felt they were being invested in.

[03:17] And so they were willing to invest back to the business.

[03:20] The second one is that you never regret taking a night to sleep on an emotional response.

[03:24] But you do regret the ones done in the moment.

[03:27] And so when I think back to before Laila, I would often have bad news or something about that would happen.

[03:32] And I almost got off on being angry.

[03:34] Like being in rage feels good.

[03:37] Like it feels like you're just like an absolute power mode.

[03:40] But then like afterwards you have like a anger hangover.

[03:43] And I definitely did that a lot in my earlier career and I regret it.

[03:48] And then you basically fostering abusive relationship.

[03:50] And I don't I use that lightly.

[03:51] But more so just that there's a cycle of anger and then a apology and the anger and apology.

[03:56] And it's just it's not good for either party.

[03:58] And so what she got me to do was basically slow down.

[04:01] She was like, hey, I got your upset.

[04:03] If you're still upset tomorrow, jiu-yur had a.

[04:05] And nine times out of ten I'd wake up the next day and be like, it's fine.

[04:09] They didn't mean it.

[04:10] There it was the malicious intent which is dumb and whatever.

[04:13] And then we asked the question, how many decreases like this happens again to the future?

[04:17] And then we can be productive about it rather than just insulting or assessing someone's character.

[04:21] And she honestly is almost a freak at this point of being able to like sit in the middle of like

[04:27] uncomfortable conversations.

[04:29] It has zero affect.

[04:30] It's been amazing for our marriage because like I can escalate.

[04:35] In terms of getting angry and more aggressive.

[04:37] And despite being a girl who's smaller than me.

[04:39] So I don't care what you say.

[04:41] If you were a bigger guy and there's a girl and you're alone and you get angry, they get scared.

[04:45] I don't care what they say.

[04:46] It just like gets a physical instinct.

[04:48] And she has been able to tame that in her mind.

[04:50] And even when I can get like more heated,

[04:53] she should just say like I totally understand where you're coming from.

[04:55] Like let's talk through it.

[04:56] Let's figure it out.

[04:57] And even just seeing her do that has helped me learn to just like regulate my own emotional responses

[05:04] to stimuli a lot better.

[05:06] Number three.

[05:07] Stress doesn't mean there's anything wrong.

[05:08] It means real life.

[05:10] And so one of the things Layla jokes about is like dead people problems.

[05:12] It's like if we want to not have stress about someone.

[05:15] She's like, ah, those are dead people problems.

[05:16] Like if we have zero stress, it means we're dead.

[05:19] Right?

[05:19] And so the converse of that or the inverse of that is that if we feel stress, it means we're doing things.

[05:25] And it means that we care.

[05:26] And so I think that reframing anxiety as just caring.

[05:30] And there being nothing wrong with that.

[05:33] Has basically stopped the second line of dialogue of self judgment around being stressed around stuff.

[05:39] And more times than not, I used to get more stressed about my stress than I was getting stressed

[05:45] about the thing I was getting stressed about.

[05:47] And so the amount of stress is the comment of business every single day are countless.

[05:51] And wherever you put your attention, everything else flows.

[05:55] And so being able to remove the judgment around caring as I now see it,

[06:00] basically released me from all of that wasted attention.

[06:03] And so the amount of productivity that increased as a result of not judging myself on those things was huge.

[06:09] The way that she saw stress and stuff just helped me just be even more chill.

[06:14] And all of these kind of ladder up to making better decisions.

[06:17] And you know, if you think back to the problems that you had 10 years ago, whatever they are,

[06:22] you probably laugh at the size of the problems you had then compared to now.

[06:25] And I try and forward cast that to 10 years from now, I will laugh at the problems that I have today.

[06:30] And so like as we get bigger we expand. And so hoping or wishing that we don't have problems is

[06:36] wishing that we don't win. Because if you really want to have no problems, that it means you're

[06:40] wishing that you fail. Number four, you can feel bad and do nothing about it.

[06:45] Man, this is like if Layla has a fucking Jedi power, it's this, is that she can sit in discomfort

[06:51] for a very long time. And I said she's like, oh, I feel terrible about this.

[06:56] And then most people are like, well, what are you going to do about it? She's like, oh, nothing.

[06:59] Yeah, nothing. I'm just going to feel terrible. And that's okay. And just the acceptance of like

[07:04] the fact that I feel terrible is an emotion, which has nothing to do with the actions that I'm choosing to take.

[07:09] Because every action that I would take as a result of failure to discomfort is only going to lead me

[07:13] further away from my goal or cause me to act in a way that's not conducive to what I want.

[07:17] And oftentimes when we go to new growth levels, there is discomfort. That's why it's called growing pains.

[07:21] Not growing gains, right? It's painful to grow because you have change. You have stretch marks.

[07:25] It's literally what you have when you grow. And so the discomfort is a requisite for growth.

[07:32] And so to try and then do something about it, expense effort where none is needed. And it

[07:39] actually detracts from the growth. You actually grow more slowly by trying to combat your discomfort

[07:45] rather than accepting it for what it is as a requisite for the success that you want to have.

[07:49] Number five, and this one's big. Long term over everything. I know what we're going to do by the

[07:55] time we're dead and it isn't worth treating that for anything today that can take away from that.

[08:00] And like Layla breaves this. Like she is so long term thinking, like I really have learned

[08:05] out, so I almost 100% of my long term thinking from her. Because she is just so unwilling to sacrifice

[08:10] anything in the short term that will take away from the long term rules that we have. And I tend to be

[08:15] like, and I think that's a little bit of our union yang. And so I tend to move faster, I tend to break things.

[08:19] I tend to be more okay with imperfect like MVP, you know, minimum product, like let's get it out

[08:23] there and see what the market wants, things like that. And on the flip side, she's so protective

[08:28] of our reputation and of making sure that customer has an exceptional experience and whatever we do.

[08:32] But I think we've learned of one another in that way. But if you're somebody who's more like me,

[08:36] and if you watch my content, maybe you do as a name or with that, if you don't have a Layla,

[08:41] then maybe taking some of these lessons that I have learned might help you the same way they help me.

[08:45] Which is like, you might want to take an extra second and make sure it really does what you say it does.

[08:51] Because the one thing that can guarantee that you don't get to where you want to go is that people think you're a liar.

[08:56] And a liar has a very strong connotation, but a lot of marketing from a lot of people is exaggeration to the point of like

[09:03] kidnapping trope. Number six, the quality of your business is directly proportional to the quality of the people you

[09:10] hire, which is directly proportional to your character and your ability to cast a clear vision

[09:15] and how they fit in it, not just how you accomplish your own goals.

[09:19] And so I would say early Alex was very much like they're like, what's the mission of the business?

[09:23] And I was like, to make lots of money. Now I was the mission of the business, make Alex rich.

[09:29] Even if that is the mission, don't say that. And so she was like, no one wants to work for that.

[09:34] And she would look at me like, I don't want to work for that. I'm like, fine.

[09:38] And so as I've tried to work on myself and very transparently, since Leila joined me, Leila has exceptional

[09:44] character. And honestly the internet will never know because only the people who work in our company can really know

[09:50] how great of a human being she is. But and unfortunately, no one will believe me because I'm

[09:56] or husband and people think that I'm floughing her. So whatever. But you can judge the validity of

[10:01] that statement based on the quality of the people that we bring in because really wonderful people

[10:04] wouldn't work for people who suck. And Leila is exceptional. And so because of that, I've been able to

[10:10] have people who work in my companies who are way above what I could probably attract in my own.

[10:14] And it's all been because of honestly her relentless drive in personal development. Like she actually

[10:21] has done more personal development work than I think like than anyone I know. And just continually

[10:26] trying to get better. I mean, one of the reasons that I married Leila early on, I said, and I told her

[10:31] this, it's like in a word, it's like you're just coachable. Like she takes feedback. Like she

[10:36] actually only requires one piece of feedback to make a permanent change. I haven't seen anyone like that

[10:42] in my life. Like I'll give you an example. Like when I, the very beginning of my relationship, like she

[10:47] would like she would laugh at a joke or something and she'd be like, oh, you're stupid. Like she'd say

[10:51] like that joke. And I think she did a couple of times and I was just like, hey, probably my own thing.

[10:56] I was like, but I don't like when you say that. From that day, she's never said it again.

[10:59] Things just like the world's a lot smaller than people think it is especially the higher up you go.

[11:03] And especially the more talent people you get because like winners hang around winners. And so it's

[11:07] funny because like all the guys on my media team who were like the high up dudes know the guys who were

[11:12] on high up media teams at all other places. And they all talk and I know who's an asshole.

[11:19] And it's a dick to their team. And guess what happens when that guy is dissatisfied for a day.

[11:24] He comes to my team because hopefully our guys are like, these guys are cool. Like

[11:30] we work hard, but we work hard because we want to. We want to do good job. And so that

[11:34] culture has been because of the relentless effort Lail has done to work on herself so that she can

[11:40] translate that into her team which then translate that outwards. Because if you think about building an

[11:45] asset, which is what a business says or what it should become if you want to create something

[11:48] a value, it's never about how much you can do. It's about how much you can organize everyone in a

[11:53] singular election, which is why I said cast declare vision. Because sure, like on one level, if you're

[11:58] a great person, great, then you can attract great people. But great people still only be there because

[12:02] there's an ambition component, which is okay, you're cool. Got it. That's checkbox one.

[12:07] Checkbox two. I've a dream from my life. It does my dream fit within yours. And so you have to

[12:12] cast a vision big enough that someone else's dream can fit inside of it. I genuinely think that

[12:16] Laila sees organization as a vehicle for personal development for everyone in the company.

[12:21] And the fact that we do business, I really genuinely think for her a second year. And so

[12:26] there's an exceptional book on this by Patrick Lennsey, only called the motive.

[12:30] And she asked me to read it for like two years and I just didn't because

[12:33] more wonderful husband. And so one day, it's like, it's like a hundred pages. I read it in 90

[12:39] minutes before she woke up one day. Like I literally sat down. I was like sitting on the counter

[12:42] Laila, I'm not reading it. And I just, I read it covered covered one sitting. And she came in

[12:47] to have coffee with me in the morning and I just looked at her, I was like, I get it. I'm really sorry.

[12:52] And if like I highly recommend it if you're a small business owner where you're an operator,

[12:56] you're somebody actually runs your business, read the motive. It I was the bad guy in the example.

[13:04] And it shows what it looks like to be a good operator of a business. And it was literally the exact

[13:11] opposite of everything I did. Number seven, be fast to extend trust and be even faster to take it back.

[13:18] And so I tend to be the more trusting of the two of us. Remember I'm the estimate. You know,

[13:22] someone's like, I'll do that. I'm like, Cherry, said he do it. Why wouldn't you do it? She's like,

[13:26] did you not see the flashing scam sign over his head? That's just biggest lighting to be like,

[13:30] I'm a scam. I was like, oh, shit. No, I didn't see that. And so the amount of mistakes one that

[13:36] she told me avoid. But secondly, that Laila will still extend trust. And she does that. And I would say that

[13:43] this particular kind of quarter is him is more about the team. So I was really fast to extend trust

[13:48] externally to vendors and partnerships and things like that, but really slow to extend internally.

[13:53] And I think she is that flipped is that she's really slow to extend trust to people outside. But on the

[13:59] inside, if she's like, okay, if you passed all these walls, you're in like you're in like you're in like

[14:03] you're on the team and we will treat you like you're on the team. But if you give us reason to not trust

[14:08] you, we will take that back. And so that is how I think she kind of like protected the kingdom if you

[14:13] want to say that way, that I've learned a lot from her. And so I think it's the internal external kind

[14:19] of dichotomy that was split between the two of us. And I think because she extend trust people trust us back.

[14:25] And that was something that I can in my organizations that was just remind me earlier. I didn't trust

[14:29] anyone and no trust in me. Number eight, don't require three strikes to get someone out of your life.

[14:33] If someone shows you their colors, believe them the first time. This one, I think Laila is

[14:37] fucking queen of. I tend to give second chances. Again, this is more externally partners. This guy

[14:42] did this thing in the past. You know, maybe he was indebted for fraud. It was a misunderstanding.

[14:46] Laila's been just very adamant that like if someone has a history of something,

[14:50] I don't want to be their come up story. Like let's someone else take that shot.

[14:55] I'll I'll be after that because there's enough people who have just crushed it and been

[15:02] awesome the whole time and haven't fucked anyone over. Let's just work with them. And

[15:07] we've avoided a lot of calamity because the amount of times that I have done that and been burned

[15:14] is honestly the majority of time. As ugly as that sounds and I I want to believe in redemption

[15:21] and I do I think but I think I want to believe in it in someone else's time.

[15:27] Number nine, punishment only gets short term obedience. Praise gets long term loyalty. This is

[15:32] really interesting that took me a long time to figure out. So from a human behavior perspective,

[15:37] punishment fades over time and so let me do an example. So if you ever like drag too much

[15:41] one weekend you wake up the next day and you're like hungover like I've never going to drag again.

[15:44] And then the next weekend you're out there partying what happened is the punishment,

[15:49] associated with the hangover, faded but the reward associated with getting drunk and partying stays the same.

[15:55] It's the same reason if you break up with somebody. Months later you think about the good times

[16:00] please forget about the bad times. You've ever seen them again and then all of a sudden it all comes rushing

[16:02] back and like oh my god this person sucks. Well I think right you remember it all because punishment fades

[16:07] ward stays over time and I'm gonna get really real. I think the reason that people speak really

[16:14] nicely about people who've been dead for a long time is that that person has never had the ability

[16:17] to punish them anymore for a very long time. And they only remember the good things. All that to say

[16:24] in an organization you can absolutely get someone to do whatever you want if you punish them.

[16:30] Like if I hold a gun to somebody's head that the threat of punishment you can get them to it here

[16:33] for the most part. But the moment you remove the punishment you remove the threat they behave exactly

[16:39] the way they were going to before. But if you reward they will always want to have that reward and it

[16:45] does not fade. And so if you want the team to continue to act the same way when you are not there

[16:51] then using the war rather than punishment is a better long-term strategy. The problem is and this is what

[16:56] confounds everything is that you can get way faster results with punishment. And so you have to be

[17:02] more patient and more willing to continue to invest in people when they myself knock it angry and continue

[17:07] to only reward the good things so that you orient their behavior in that way. But then you have a

[17:12] longer on ramp but then they are way more self-sufficient long-term so you get higher returns on an

[17:18] employee by investing longer in the short-term so you get better long-term rewards. Whereas punishment

[17:23] you can change their behavior quickly but you always have to keep punishment and you also have to

[17:28] increase your punishment. So if you're the type of boss who just always yells the same way eventually

[17:32] people get immune to it. And so you actually have to increase the intensity and variety of punishment

[17:37] in order to keep it effective. Just getting into behavior stuff. And that sounds like a terrible way to

[17:43] live. And so from her I have seen her disease reward. She just does outward reward in such a

[17:49] strategic like she's like a surgical in how she can pinpoint how to give reward at the right time

[17:56] for the right people for her activities and orient the organization so quickly towards the cookies

[18:01] or nuggets that she puts out that everyone just gets excited. And she does it to me too.

[18:07] Because hey I like being a word too. And so the thing about human behaviors that even if you

[18:12] understand it it still works. I'll give you a really micro example. So we had someone on our team

[18:18] who we always really enjoyed filming what. And we wanted to put that person in turn to the

[18:22] whole department and we're like okay well how do we get someone else to be just as good at filming with us.

[18:27] And so we were like okay well we can't just tell people like be good at filming. We're like what

[18:32] is it about that person that makes them so good to film with? And what we realized when we broke

[18:36] it down one of the things is that like when we were talking they would not along. Like they were

[18:41] listening to what we were saying. And so for you you're just a camera right now but you're

[18:45] watching this as a person. But for me I'm just looking at a camera. And so having someone behind who's

[18:49] like giving me feedback in real time created a short reinforcement or reward loop that made it

[18:54] more enjoyable to film with. And so for us identifying that little loop made the whole thing more

[19:01] enjoyable. And so in all aspects of business there are these little short reward loops that we can

[19:05] identify. And then get really tactical good about them and incentivize those things. And now

[19:11] when we bring someone in they know that there's three four five six activities that somebody

[19:15] people behind a camera has to do that makes them excellent behind a camera and then we can

[19:18] on-ramp people and reward them for those activities because those activities were more the

[19:22] person who's doing the recording and then that becomes the virtue of cycle reward and that becomes

[19:26] really fun and profitable. 10 you cannot ask anyone for things you don't already give them. Think

[19:32] patience, trust forgiveness. So I said earlier that Laila extends trust first. She extends forgiveness

[19:37] first. She is patient with others first. And so I would say earlier on in my career probably

[19:43] still a little bit now, I demand things from people that I might not have given them or demonstrated first.

[19:48] And so over time I've learned through her demonstration. I've learned from her that she just

[19:55] demonstrates whatever she wants. And as more people like to model behavior to how humans learn,

[20:03] if she does something, then people will do it too. And so kind of like the monkey seem monkey do

[20:09] thing. I learned that talk is really cheap from her and what your actions do through demonstration

[20:15] speaks volumes. And she can change the entire behavior of a team by just acting the way she acts

[20:22] and then people act in accordance with that. 11. Be fiercely competitive with yourself, ignore everyone else.

[20:28] I spent way too much of my earlier years in business before Laila looking at what my competition

[20:33] was to like, I would obsess over their ads over what they were saying, over what they were producing,

[20:38] or what their workouts were, remember that I was in fitness. And I was like they're sending

[20:42] people over to steal my workout. I swear to God, I was like I would like worry that they were

[20:46] stealing my workouts. It's just crazy stuff. And you know what some of them work, but like who cares?

[20:51] Like if they're stealing your workouts and means you're doing better than them,

[20:53] they're trying to copy you. And Laila was just so like Laila is fiercely competitive, only against

[21:00] herself. And it like truly is like she actually doesn't give me shit about anyone else is doing.

[21:04] And I definitely was really competitive with other people and then in so doing just wanted to do

[21:10] better because I wanted to beat them rather than because I wanted to get better. As long as I was

[21:13] better than them, I felt like I won. And she basically helped me see. She was like, I think you have

[21:19] a lot more potential than beating these people. So I think beating these people is a small goal.

[21:24] And so it only put the bar above my nearest competitor rather than what she believed. I was

[21:31] capable of and I think that when you have someone who believes and you like that, you start to believe

[21:35] into. Number 12, listen to feedback the first time, whether it's from friends, family,

[21:40] customers, employee, if it makes you better, change it now, no matter how bad it hurts. I definitely

[21:44] had the kind of little bit of a CEO bubble before Laila and I started working together. And so people

[21:51] never wanted to give me bad news because I would chew them out. And so they stop giving me bad news,

[21:55] but it also meant to stop giving me the truth. And so it becomes very difficult to win if you don't

[22:00] have the truth. And so you make decisions based on data and the quality of your decisions,

[22:04] based on the quality of the data. And so you cannot say that you want to make the best decisions and

[22:09] also not be willing to listen. And I definitely suffered that for a very long time.

[22:13] Because most times if you are presented with the data, you can make really good solutions. Like

[22:18] you ice the joke about this with our team. I was like, really good data makes you look like a genius.

[22:22] Because if the problems are obvious in the numbers, you can just solve them.

[22:27] Where you can trouble is where you don't have the data and you're basically operating blind.

[22:31] And a lot of people operate like that for years because their teams don't want to tell them anything.

[22:35] And so Laila won solicits feedback. Two, she encourages it. And I would say she encourages

[22:42] it even more. It's negative. And so and I'll be really real in the beginning.

[22:47] They will say something mean. Because you will solicit the feedback. And then you will have some sort

[22:52] of facial expression. And then you just have to power through it and be like, please do it again.

[22:57] I'm like, I'm working on this. And I'll give you the magic question that she's asked that I think

[23:01] is one of my favorite questions for feedback. Which is, what would you tell me if you knew I wouldn't

[23:07] be getting angry? Like, what would you tell me if you knew it wouldn't upset me? And it just opens up

[23:13] the form of like, because it gives people the frame because a lot of things people would tell you if they

[23:16] didn't think it would upset you. And so you say, what would you tell me if you didn't think it would

[23:18] upset me? And you get so much truthful feedback from people like, hey, you're really short.

[23:22] Or hey, you're telling what to communicate with. Or hey, you take really long to respond. Or hey,

[23:26] you tend to be late on meetings and it really pisses everyone off. Like, there's your things that

[23:29] people say, but if you don't solicit it that way. And so I would encourage you, even maybe even with

[23:33] your spouse to start. But your team, it's a really good exercise. And you get some really good answers.

[23:38] And a lot of times you get blind spots that you become a to where I've had, at least as far as I'm concerned,

[23:43] like I would rather people talk shit to my face. 13. This one's a medie one. All right. So I'm just

[23:48] going to read this directly. The best operators take action immediately on tasks. They don't let

[23:52] anything sit on their desk. They are delegation and accountability machines. Not quote systems people.

[23:58] They get mounts that worked on through leading others to think for themselves, only dumb people need rules.

[24:03] All right. Let's break this down. A lot of earlier on business owners want to

[24:07] SOP standard operating procedure every single component of a business. The problem with that is that

[24:12] the business environment changes rapidly. By the time you have SOPed everything, everything has changed.

[24:16] And so anything can be continually broken down into smaller, smaller skills. If I said,

[24:21] hey, I need you to write a marketing campaign that is different and can be broken all the way down

[24:24] to turn on a computer, navigate to Safari, go to this URL, here is how you type. Right? Like,

[24:31] everything can get broken down. But at a certain point, you expect a certain level of competence.

[24:36] And the way to move cookie within an organization is to extend trust and have people who you trust

[24:41] to make decisions on your behalf. In order for them to make decisions on every half, which means

[24:44] that they can move quickly without having to standardize every single operating procedure, is that they

[24:48] have shared values with you. Say, this is how we want things to be done. And then you demonstrate

[24:51] those things being done so they know that you are not full of shit. If people see you say, this is what

[24:56] we do. And then in the hard circumstances, you act in accordance with those values. And then you

[25:00] public reward the people who in hard circumstances also act in accordance with those values.

[25:04] Independent of your intervention. Of you interfering. More people will do it. This one is

[25:09] so prevalent. So everybody who's under 10 million, listen up. True operators are leaders.

[25:15] Like, it really took me a long time to figure this out. It's not about systems, like they

[25:20] feel like processes. They just weave their hands. And really what it means is they just like

[25:24] make everyone's life harder. In order for a process to put in place and stay within an organization,

[25:28] it has to make a net benefit on the organization. So there's something called local cost,

[25:32] and global cost or local benefits and global benefits. So I'll give you simple example. If I ask the sales

[25:37] team to write notes in the CRM, they will have a local cost. They will now have more work to do than

[25:42] they do before. If those notes then get used by customer support and onboarding and product and delivery

[25:48] and they're really integral to the rest of their client experience, there is going to be a global

[25:51] benefit. So more people benefit or it is a benefit from this small cost. That's a good return

[25:56] on an investment. Oftentimes, quote, systems people don't think that way. They just think everything

[26:00] has to be somewhere and we have to put systems around everything. And that oftentimes,

[26:05] slows people down and they cannot communicate with the global benefit is. Because if I don't

[26:09] use some of that information for example, then maybe I shouldn't ask myself, guys, to write that down.

[26:13] Because all I'm doing is incurring a local cost, but I don't have a clear benefit.

[26:17] And I'll give you a different example. Because I think this is such a prevalent issue in businesses.

[26:20] I had an accounting team in one of our companies who said, hey, can we have some software developers,

[26:24] write some code to automate this task that we do? And I was like, okay, well, how many hours

[26:28] a week has taken? Like, it takes us like four hours of manual input every week. And I was like,

[26:32] wow, that's tough. And so I went to software developers and I said, hey, you know, what would it take

[26:37] to do this? They're like, oh, we can do it in 14 days. And I was like, okay, the accounting team was like,

[26:41] great, can you sign off on this? I was like, okay, hold up. What is the cost of 14 days of a full-dev

[26:47] team doing this? It's 5,000 a day FYI for this particular team. And so 14 days times 5,000 or

[26:52] 70 grand. You work for four hours a week on this thing. So it's 52 times 4. All right, so it's $200.

[27:00] Now you make $70,000 a year. So 10% of your paycheck gets allocated towards this task. So $7,000.

[27:08] So in order for me to get a return on this 14-day quick automation system, it would take me 10 years.

[27:14] And that's a pretty shitty return. And that assumes that nothing changes over the next 10 years

[27:19] in our business that would cause us to have to update this thing. Break fix because we switch

[27:23] systems. And I think you can get where I'm going with this. Of course, it may no sense.

[27:27] But it's quote, systems people will systematize without considering the long-term consequences

[27:32] and the global benefits of why they're even doing it to begin with. They just get OCD about

[27:36] shit and they just want to system everything. But all they do is slow people down. But Layla

[27:40] has operated every business we were done and the reason they've gone big is because she delegates

[27:44] authority. As soon as things come on her desk, she shoots him out. She's just a delegation

[27:47] machine and she trusts the people. And so it's much more about empowering those people so that

[27:52] they can do the things the way they want them to be done as long as they still meet the objective.

[27:56] And she gives way more liberty because she chooses to hire more competent people, which ladders

[28:00] up to some of the things earlier, which is if you have really done people, you have to make really

[28:03] strict rules. And if you're already making strict rules, you lost. People will care about you and

[28:08] care about your business if you act like you care about them. And the easiest way to act like you

[28:13] care about them is to actually care about them. And so I would say prior to Layla, I'd say to

[28:20] to be much more like a utilitarian in terms of how I thought about people like people are

[28:25] clogs and a machine. We need to build a machine. We need to assemble the clogs in place.

[28:29] Put some carrots and sticks and they will act in accordance with that. And Layla with her much

[28:34] more nuanced and interesting of human nature was like that's probably not the best way to do it.

[28:39] And so I, for earlier on, I was like, how do you act like you care so much? It's just like,

[28:48] I do care. Layla will always prioritize the human above the role. And that's hard to do as a

[28:57] business owner. And so I'll give you a very clear example that happens all the time in business

[29:01] that's really tough. So let's say someone comes in and you invest a ton of time in it. Like

[29:05] you invest a lot of training a lot of real-man hours that you mentor, you coach the person up.

[29:10] And after six months of all this investment, you realize that the person is better fit doing

[29:16] something else not of the company. And not saying like you're fine, but more like, I think you can

[29:19] move on and do something bigger or doing something somewhere else or even doing something at a

[29:24] competitor's business because you have an opportunity there. Layla will genuinely say, I really think

[29:31] you should take. And I am like, fuck you die. But she doesn't think that. Layla really taught me

[29:39] how to just talk to the human and really put the human first. And when we do that, you get a huge

[29:45] global benefit. She has been so good at separating role from human that it's been into this long-term.

[29:52] And then also, here's the second order of magnitude come back, is that the person who does get a

[29:59] clause in the way out. And has it, let's say like a graceful exit. Those people feel like the OU-1

[30:07] because of how graceful the exit was. And they will send customers your way, they will send,

[30:11] they will oftentimes help you train up the next person, they will help recruit for you. And then

[30:16] long-term, if they do really well, you might do business together. And we've had every one of those

[30:21] incidents happen with people that have left our company. And all of those opportunities and all of

[30:26] those doors would have been slammed shut if I'd put their head on this mic. Number 15,

[30:31] do what you are most afraid of because it's usually the thing that you need to do most.

[30:34] This is like a classic Layla, you know, example or question for strategy.

[30:39] Is she's like, what are we most afraid of doing? And so I'll cross the fall question like,

[30:45] what do we do if we didn't think we could fail? And I think you get really interesting

[30:50] kind of thought for poking answers that come from that, especially when you're thinking about

[30:53] strategic direction, big vision for where you're trying to go. And most times we realize that we

[30:57] don't take the big moves and a lot of times it's because they're painful. And that's why we're afraid of them.

[31:02] Like, there's a hard conversation. Like, what do I, what do I need to do right now? There's this

[31:06] conversation I have to have. And so it's like, that's what I'm most afraid of right now. It's usually

[31:11] the thing I need to do. In the fitness world to give a completely different parallel, usually the

[31:16] exercises that you hate doing the most are the ones you usually need to do. Right? And so I feel,

[31:22] I feel like it's almost a perfect, a core Larry in business is at like a lot of the thing like,

[31:26] I don't like reading our customer reviews. It's like dude, you got to read them every day.

[31:30] Even though it's painful, you got to read them. Right? Because you got to know how you can get better.

[31:34] And that might be the thing that you're most afraid of. Man, I know our stuff's a little outdated.

[31:39] I'm not like, I don't want to like, to go through all the work of like making an entirely new product

[31:43] or a V2 or it's going to be so much like, what's the thing we're most afraid of doing?

[31:48] It's probably the thing that you need to do. And so she's again so good at embracing this comfort

[31:53] and saying like, what is required? Um, that I've just learned that from her. And so we've been

[31:58] able to basically what might have taken me six months to confront might make take me a week now to

[32:03] confront. And so we just move so much faster through obstacles because before I just put it off.

[32:07] And so number 16 is that networking matters if you have nothing to offer. But I don't

[32:12] sacrifice your goals in order to network because if you accomplish your goals, this is the big one.

[32:16] If you accomplish your goals, you have even more to offer and the network would be there for you.

[32:20] But the reverse is in true. Because if you don't, if you didn't accomplish the thing,

[32:24] in order to network more, go to these events and these, it is mastermind and these things and

[32:29] and network and podcast and whatever. The less success we become, the more you plateau, the more

[32:34] irrelevant you become, and the less the doors stay open for you. And the more you have to hustle and

[32:38] grift and shake hands and kiss babies and do all the business card hand out bullshit. But like the

[32:43] person who is the best network in the world is rug or Elon or Mr. Beast, like any of those people

[32:48] can call whoever they want up and they don't need to go into networking event because here's the

[32:53] conversation that. Imagine they had sacrificed, imagine Mr. Beast for example, let's say Elon,

[32:57] imagine Elon had sacrificed the goal city hat for the business so that he could attend more

[33:01] networking events and take more meetings and hey, God of seconds, hey, can I pick your brains? Hey,

[33:07] like hey, do hop on this podcast with me, even though this really makes sense. Just because someone

[33:11] asks for your time doesn't mean you owe it to them. Just because someone sends you a message doesn't

[33:15] mean you owe them a response. And this took me a very long time to learn. Layla's been so much better

[33:20] about that. She's so good at saying no, that we practice it. I'll see even tell you, like we don't really

[33:24] do like New Year's resolutions or anything like that, but one thing that we committed to this year

[33:27] was social obligations are not obligations. If we want to go, we will go. And if we don't want to go,

[33:33] we will not go. And if they no longer want to be friends with us, that's fine. Because if we didn't

[33:38] want to go anyways and they stop inviting us, great. Real talk played out. Well then it's like

[33:45] we'll even say bad things about us. So does everyone else. Everyone else you pass on are going

[33:50] to bad things to say bad things. It's just part of it. Number 17, you can not be CEO of more than one thing.

[33:55] No matter how much you want to or how good the opportunity is, saying no to everything means saying

[33:59] yes to one thing that matters. And so in another video I basically talked through the biggest

[34:03] mistakes I made in my life. And one of the recurring themes that happened before Layla and even

[34:08] as as Shamedez and I would say this even with Layla, being with me is that I would steam roll her

[34:13] in the earlier parts of our career before I respected her opinions as much as I do now.

[34:17] She's like don't you feel like we have enough going on that we shouldn't take off,

[34:21] you know take a bite at this other thing and I'd be like no we can add it, we can handle it.

[34:26] And I was wrong. And so I want to be really clear about something because I think there's a lot

[34:30] of confusion about this kind of my audience. I own equity in a lot of companies that is very different

[34:36] from being CEO or operator in a lot of companies. At an extreme example, if you buy stock in

[34:41] 10 companies on the stock exchange, you are an owner of all this company. You do not operate any of them.

[34:46] Ownership is very different from operating. In my opinion you can only operate one thing very well.

[34:52] If you operate two, you operate them at a huge decrement. So I'll give you an example here.

[34:57] If you can run two one million dollar businesses by being CEO of both, you have the potential to

[35:02] run a 10 million dollar business if you only pick one. There's a huge it's not one plus one and then

[35:07] it's really two million dollar business. It's really like you have five times the output if you just focus.

[35:11] Because the thing is is all of the wins come from the depth and the nuance. It comes from the

[35:16] the outsizer turns, come at the very end of the race. That's where you make the smallest individual

[35:21] improvements, but you get the biggest returns from it. And so a simple example is the difference

[35:26] between gold metal and silver metal and the Olympics is a fraction of a second. But the difference between

[35:33] gold and silver in real life implications is everything. You're either the best in the world or

[35:38] you're not. And who knows who the bronze metal is was last year? No, no, but everyone knows who

[35:43] is saying bolt is. So there's huge increment, there's huge real life returns for getting this

[35:51] little bit better that all of the focus centralized on one thing gets you that you lose out on.

[35:56] Because and the thing is is that because of your own ignorance because you're not close enough,

[36:00] you can't see the opportunities that you can't see. They're unknown unknowns from an opportunity

[36:05] perspective that you only become aware of if you cut off one another saying is killing your babies.

[36:12] Like you have to kill one of your babies so that you can let the other one grow up. And so I have been

[36:17] the king of wanting to keep all my children alive. But the amount of money that I made after cutting

[36:24] out all of these side projects and these side hustles and these gigs and these weird partnerships,

[36:29] like all of that happened in the first year of Lele and I being together because she was like

[36:34] dude, I think you could do so much more if you could actually focus. And like I tell these stories

[36:39] because I was that person. And so I was like if you were struggling with this stuff, I get it.

[36:45] I'm not like like like I did this and I fucked up and I'm trying to help you not fuck up and get

[36:49] their faster. I had a copractor agency, I had a dental agency, I had my gym lunch business where I was

[36:55] flying around in person doing different launches. I still owned my gyms from back home, five of them,

[37:02] five of those are individual businesses. I had one, two, three, at eight businesses that I was CEO of

[37:07] all of them and it was horrible. This is when I lost everything. This is when I had a DUI head on collision.

[37:13] This is one of my mother went to the hospital, also a terrible thing. My grandfather died,

[37:17] who was always really close with. All of those things happened in like a six month window.

[37:21] And Lele to point 15 was like what do you most afraid of right now? I was like I'm afraid of

[37:26] having this hard conversation with these partners because I don't think I should be in these partnerships anymore.

[37:30] Just like well, they're not going to end themselves and I'll be really honest with you. The

[37:36] only way that I was really able to do was I got in my head on collision in the DUI and I had a

[37:42] coach who told me they were like your stress is going to kill you. You said that like you got out of

[37:49] life. So what are you going to do now? And so I basically had to face my own death or more

[37:56] talented or just getting out alive. I had to get a head on collision, 60 miles an hour, and I walked away.

[38:02] Like nothing. Like I just walked out of the car and it wasn't with another thing. It was with

[38:07] an end. It was a stop-top, a different story. After that, in realizing that I could have just been

[38:14] dead because of how stressed I was, I just ripped the bandaid off of everything. I like in a row,

[38:22] I did it in one day. I just called the first one up and I was like hey, I can't do this anymore. So what

[38:26] do you mean? It's like, can't do this anymore. Not going to the partnership. And the second piece of advice

[38:32] that I was given, if you have to exit somebody's heart things, was do right by everyone. He's like

[38:37] exit everything and do right by everyone. It's like because if you screw one person over,

[38:42] you will regret it forever. And so that means all stakeholders, that meant employees, that meant

[38:47] customers, that meant landlords, that meant every partners, everything. And so it was an excruciating

[38:53] process for me. I had to write checks over and over again to refunds and partners and buyouts

[39:00] and vendor contracts outside and lease agreement that I was on the hook for. I mean everything.

[39:05] I just said it just like it just killed me. But I just had this big thing which was like the

[39:10] alternative this is I died. And so I hope that you don't have as extreme of circumstance, but I only

[39:17] say this because I understand how hard it can be. And I fortunate or not had a near-death experience,

[39:24] which then made everything shrink in comparison in terms of how important it seemed to me.

[39:29] I had a business owner friend that I know who was doing 10 million bucks a year and you had like

[39:33] 17 businesses and he was running all of them and it was absolute insanity. I was like how many

[39:38] business owners? He didn't even know he had a public associate. I was like this is absolute crazy.

[39:44] And so I said which one's the best one? He was like this one. I was like okay,

[39:48] hypothetical for you. I said if the only thing you had to do in your life was double this business

[39:54] and you had no other businesses to care of, take care of. Do you think you could do it? He was like oh

[39:58] I got it. He had fucking breathe. I'd be able to do that in my sleep. And I was like so why don't we?

[40:06] Guys, spend the next year getting rid of all of the extra companies. And that one company has grown.

[40:14] And so the thing is is like we want to not leave money on the table. We want to take the short term

[40:19] wins. But whenever you take those you actually take away from the big pot of gold which is the main

[40:24] focus that you started to go after to get away. And so I am more guilty of this than just about anyone

[40:30] I can I don't know if anyone has been worse about this than me. And so I just say this because like my

[40:35] income and my net worth skyrocketed directly proportional to my ability to say no. Before I met Lala,

[40:42] I couldn't crack $3 million a year. I'd lost a different businesses. I had a ton of stress.

[40:48] And I had a lot of bad partnerships. Not bad partners. Mostly bad structures because I didn't know

[40:54] that. And when she came in and I watched as she worked and I watched as she dealt with people and I watched

[40:58] as she operated a business, I learned so much. And 24 months later, I took over $17 million a

[41:04] personal income. So I'm from not cracking $3 million in revenue to take home $17 income. That was the

[41:10] difference that those lessons and watching her operate taught me. And if all of these stories of

[41:17] all the things that I learned from Lala have been helpful, I have a severed video where I break down

[41:21] high lost over $100 million in 11 different mistakes that I made in my life. And exactly what you

[41:27] can do to avoid them. And likely you might be actively making one of those mistakes right now. And I

[41:31] hope you don't. So watch this video.

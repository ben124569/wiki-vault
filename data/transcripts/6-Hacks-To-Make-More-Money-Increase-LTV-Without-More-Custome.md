[00:00] Good morning, everyone. It is Alex from Ozi here from Jim launch prestige Allen and the many other companies that we have in our portfolio

[00:07] They did for $110 million in sales and I am going to tell you how we did that that further do

[00:13] PURPS this video is to show you the six ways to increase lifetime value

[00:16] All right, and I'm gonna show you my favorite one at the end of this that I think is the most powerful of the six

[00:21] All right, and so first thing we have to do is to find lifetime value all right

[00:25] So there's two ways to grow a business from a fundamental standpoint number one is you get more customers number two

[00:29] You make those customers worth more that's it

[00:33] That's it so it would be who of us as business owners who are trying to make more and grow our businesses

[00:38] That we should know all of the different ways to a get more customers and be make them worth more

[00:41] All right now when I say make them worth more lifetime value is a very

[00:45] Loosely defined term you can look on the internet. There's lots of different definitions for it

[00:49] And what I'm going to do is redefine this as lifetime gross profit all right

[00:53] So L T

[00:55] GP which is what I care about all right because for example if I'm selling a meal for $10 and I make

[01:01] And it cost me nine dollars to deliver the meal. I means I make a dollar

[01:05] So if I sell someone and it cost me five dollars to get somebody to buy a $10 meal

[01:10] Is that a good business proposition for me?

[01:12] Well, you're making $10 dollars across you five you're getting two to one

[01:15] Well, my cost of delivering it's nine out of the ten dollars. This means I spend five dollars to make one dollar of gross profit

[01:20] All right, and so that is why it's GP all right

[01:23] That's why I don't like life to values and it's very amorphous term and so what we're looking for is how much juice how much gross profit is there?

[01:30] Over the lifetime of the customer for us all right now

[01:33] That's not net profit net profits after you've paid all of your every all the other expenses you're rent your payroll all the other things

[01:40] But this is just the gross margin that comes in if it costs you a two dollars to buy a thing and you sell it for six

[01:45] Then the gross margins for now you still got to pay you know your warehouse and whatever other things you have going on now

[01:52] Hopefully you understand lifetime gross profits. I can get into the goodies all right

[01:55] So there's six ways to increase LTV the first one is

[02:00] Increase the price

[02:02] Sounds crazy but believe it or not price in and of itself

[02:06] Is something that can actually draw alerts here your products?

[02:10] Do you think of a Chanel personal for $20 people would think they're as cool?

[02:13] No price in and of itself can create a lure around a product

[02:16] You can put you in another category so much other people say this is so much more expensive

[02:21] There must be something different about this. I'm gonna look at this more closely, right?

[02:25] number two

[02:27] Is it you can decrease the cost all right?

[02:29] So if I can find a cheaper way to do the thing I can invest in technology investing processes

[02:34] I can invest in outsourcing all these different ways that I can deliver the same thing

[02:38] For less I increase my gross profit so if I had that meal thing that I was talking about earlier and it cost me nine dollars to make the meal

[02:44] But I found this new automated robotic process that allows me to do the meals for two dollars that

[02:49] Very much increases the lifetime risk profit of my of my of my products and my business

[02:54] But I didn't change anything but sides decrease in the cost all right

[03:00] The next one is to increase purchase frequency all right

[03:03] So what this is

[03:05] Is getting people to buy again and again and again if I can get someone to come to my restaurant today and tomorrow and then continue to come forever

[03:12] Then that's gonna be a much more valuable

[03:14] Client right and so that increases if I can get all my clients to come in additional one time

[03:19] Right that would increase my lifetime gross profit per customer across my entire business all right

[03:23] So if you're tracking with me number one you can increase the price number two

[03:26] You can decrease how much it cost you to fulfill the thing right number three

[03:30] You get people to buy more times all right and then

[03:33] 4 5 and 6 are slightly related but different all right the first is that you can upsell people

[03:39] All right now upsells very important here

[03:42] I'm gonna define this for you

[03:45] Is selling the same thing

[03:49] But a more valuable version so if you upgrade right from from a Honda to Alexis

[03:54] Then you were getting upsold right important and I think it's important to define these terms

[03:58] She's there different types of sales and if you can be more nuanced than how you think you will think better

[04:03] All right, especially when it comes to your business so the next so that's that's by I'll give you a

[04:08] A food example so if I go from a you know 20 ounce soda to a 32 ounce soda that is an upsell

[04:14] It's more of the same it's either better of the same or more of the same but either way it's the same category of stuff

[04:21] I'm just I'm just buying a bigger better version of it all right the next is a cross sell

[04:26] All right across sell is an adjacent need

[04:30] That I am solving all right, so in the burger eggs are starting in the in the in the Coke example

[04:35] If I sell a burger with the Coke then that is a cross sell right so upsell is small Coke to big Coke or you know

[04:43] Normal lemonade to to organic whatever lemonade, you know, espresso

[04:48] Sun kissed lemonade for it's right that's an upsell across I would be

[04:53] What do you want with that lemon do you want to sandwich with that lemonade?

[04:55] What do you want with that so do you want a burger with that so do you want fries with that soda right that is a cross sell

[05:01] All right, that's a cross sell

[05:03] So you're selling an additional thing. This is usually the next natural need that the person's going to have as a result of their first person's decision

[05:09] Oftentimes these cross sells are actually where the majority of the profit happens

[05:13] So sometimes there are strategies and businesses that are called lost leaders everyone needs this one thing

[05:18] But the next thing they need is gonna be the thing it has all the margin in it if you know your numbers

[05:22] You can build a model around that very successfully all right and then finally this is one that's overlooked

[05:29] Is down-sales right so a lot of businesses that I'll talk to where they're

[05:32] Can talk with

[05:34] They don't have any down-sales and so that means that there's all this traffic that's coming to their side or getting one of the sales calls with them

[05:40] But those those people have needs to and it might not fit in your primary

[05:46] category this is especially true if you sell a higher higher level service or a more expensive service

[05:51] A lot of them were still paying for this traffic right this traffic these eyeballs

[05:55] Our still yours and I like to think of this is one person's trash is another person's treasure

[05:59] There's always a business that can do something with some of that kind of the sawdust the excess capacity that we have that exists within our business

[06:07] Right and so down-sales you can either down-sell to someone else's product and get affiliate commissions get a referral partner

[06:13] Commissions for for sending business their way or right and I like that a lot because you're you have a nice relationship with another business

[06:21] You think they have a good product. They specialize in serving that type of customer

[06:25] And you both benefit you make money they get free customers everybody wins the customer gets solved

[06:29] Right, and they're gonna thank you for making the introduction as long as you have good partners, which you obviously should the other way to do this is to have lesser

[06:37] You know lesser

[06:39] lesser cost of the filament but it's solving the same need so

[06:45] Trying to think an example of this so yeah if you had a good done for you service of some type

[06:49] Right, and the person couldn't afford your full suite of services

[06:53] You could downsell a kind of a done with you were do it yourself

[06:57] Version of that right and so making those products taking the one-time investment of making that product or making that

[07:03] You know done with you version of your your primary done for you service or whatever it is a lot of times

[07:09] You can serve as a really good

[07:10] Down-sell right if someone walks into a facility for personal training and they can't afford personal training

[07:15] Obviously there's groups and things like that they could do that would be a natural down-sell

[07:18] But maybe they want to stay at home and you give them the at home version right

[07:21] So there's all these different ways so you can you can slice and dice this but fundamentally

[07:25] If we have people that were normally not giving us money because they would say no

[07:29] But now we're able to monetize them in some way

[07:32] We have now made more money per customer all right and it's really per per person who walks into our business

[07:37] All right, so

[07:39] Six ways to increase lifetime value of a customer lifetime gross profit one is you can increase the price and

[07:45] Automatically make more money number two is you can decrease how much it costs you to fulfill the thing that you're promising

[07:50] Number three is you can increase purchase frequency or getting the amount of time someone buys from you get them to buy more right over time

[07:57] Number four is

[07:58] Upselling them that means having structured obsells where they can get by more of the same stuff or better versions of the same stuff

[08:04] All right

[08:05] Cross sells is selling the next adjacent needs they have to think just up someone buys my service with the next thing

[08:10] They're normally gonna need well, I'm gonna sell them that too, right and it also makes their life easier

[08:14] Because they can get all their stuff from one place makes you more money everyone wins and then finally

[08:19] What can I do with the saw dust? What are all these people who are coming to my business who can't meet necessarily afford my main thing and

[08:25] How can I how can I create something still gonna solve their need but doesn't cost me that much?

[08:29] So I can still make a good a good margin on this stuff or how can I refer to the business out to someone else and still get a kick back from it

[08:35] And so those are the six ways to increase lifetime gross profit now

[08:40] I told you the beginning I was gonna tell you the thing that I think is the most powerful

[08:43] It's this guy

[08:45] Understanding price

[08:47] Pricing is one of the most underutilized levers in the entirety of of business most people

[08:53] Figure out they're pricing by looking at the marketplace taking an average saying I guess all charged that the secret that they don't know is that everyone else is broke

[09:01] Think about

[09:02] Everyone else is broke and especially if you're entering the small business ownership the reason that small businesses are small

[09:08] It's because they think like small business owners not big business owners

[09:11] That's why they stay small and so don't model small businesses

[09:17] Look at the pricing models of big businesses now

[09:20] Strong word of caution here there are market penetration strategies that businesses can do because they have funding and things like that

[09:27] But if you look at mature businesses businesses that have gone through the rapid growth phase and then

[09:31] Have sustained look at the pricing model they have because what the model that they had they have already tested and

[09:37] Obviously is produced to efficient margins that they are able to continue to grow their company

[09:41] All right, and so don't look at the small guys

[09:44] Don't look at the person who's out of shape and try model what they're doing right

[09:48] It's a problem fitness is a horrible example because people are great genetics or bad genetics and anyways

[09:52] But point is don't look for the dentures to have bad teeth right look for somebody who's got nice teeth

[09:57] And I'm sure there's genetics there too these are horrible examples, but hopefully you get the point

[10:00] All right, is that pricing is the most important lever and I'll give you one quick example on this if something cost me $10 to fulfill right and I charge $20 for it

[10:11] Cool, I'm making you know 50% gross margin

[10:15] But if I say you know what I'm gonna charge $50 for this thing or you know what we'll say 30 so I go from 20 to 30 dollars

[10:21] Right I just doubled the lifetime gross profit of my business

[10:26] doubled right they're very few of these other mechanisms that can double or triple or quadruple the lifetime gross profit

[10:34] Of your business or per client rather than price right which is also why it's one of the ones that people have the biggest limiting beliefs around

[10:42] And the ones that most people struggle to increase and the good thing is if lots people struggle to do it

[10:47] It means that there's plenty of opportunity for all of us all right so

[10:51] Six ways to increase lifetime gross profit. There's two ways to grow business one of them gets is getting more customers the other one

[10:56] Is increasing how much this customers are worth and here are six strategies that you can think about within your business

[11:01] Of how you can apply these things

[11:03] To your client journey so that you can make those clients worth more without doing any extra work

[11:09] Lots of love keeping awesome kids you guys soon. Bye

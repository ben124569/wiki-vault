[00:00] What's going on everyone happy hump day Wednesday?

[00:03] I want to make this quick video for you because I'm gonna be sharing some of the lessons that I did from

[00:08] But I got from a

[00:10] $500 million mastermind, but it's basically eight people eight entrepreneurs who together were doing

[00:16] $500 million a year. I was the second smallest so we'll finish this year. I think at 32 million

[00:24] I think there was one guy at like seven

[00:26] And then but everybody and then another one was at around my

[00:30] 35 and then the rest of them were almost all above a hundred and we had one guy over 250

[00:35] and

[00:36] the biggest I'll tell you the two biggest takeaways that I have from that entire experience

[00:43] The big the first one was when I looked at the biggest of them

[00:48] They sold

[00:50] Simple right

[00:52] Simple scales and so the term that I've given myself to like remember this is scale zero

[00:58] Which is I have to get my business to a point where there's literally zero requirement of me

[01:04] zero not like eat like

[01:07] zero none as in like it just keeps going and growing and

[01:12] By getting to that point where it requires zero

[01:17] Then I can scale it without becoming the bottleneck and so

[01:22] Missy if I can unpack this in any useful way for everyone like right now

[01:26] If you're doing anything within the business if you were to double the business the question is are you going to have to double the amount of stuff that you do?

[01:32] Many times it's a yes and to be honest with you it takes a long time to get like you're gonna move up the skill set

[01:38] Like in the beginning you do everything and then you're gonna outsource some administrative work and then you're gonna outsource some you know

[01:43] Back end customer service work and then you're gonna outsource the sales and then and then you'll start outsourcing

[01:48] Maybe the marketing and then after that you'll you know, maybe outsource the messaging behind your overarching position in the marketplace

[01:55] But at some point there really the only thing that should be left for you to do is just make decisions and not all decisions

[02:02] But just the biggest and most important decisions, right and so if that is what is left for you to do then there's basically

[02:09] Little zero right and so scaling zero means that for me to get bigger

[02:15] I must get smaller within the company. I must become less and less and less important to the company success

[02:22] In order for the company to grow without me being the bottleneck of it and I think that

[02:27] This has just been such so incredibly telling

[02:30] For me going through this and watching each of them

[02:34] The people who are doing more than me how

[02:37] How little they were doing and that's by design that's deliberate. It's hard to do that

[02:41] And you fail a lot and you hire people and they mess up and you eat those cost if mistakes

[02:46] But that's why you know finding really good people's important

[02:48] But scaling zero has been my the the brand like the branding that I'm trying to send you into my brain

[02:55] It's like scale zero like get yourself down to zero

[02:59] Because only then I'll be able to scale otherwise if I'm doing 20 hours a week of work and we double that I'll be at 40 right and so

[03:05] That has been probably one of the biggest

[03:08] lessons

[03:10] The next lesson that I learned was that from just about everybody else there

[03:14] In mind you the lessons that I'm cheering with you now are the lessons that I'm learning my current chapter

[03:18] My current season you may not be in this season, but I want to be transparent with you that this is what I'm learning right now

[03:24] and

[03:26] The lesson that I learned

[03:28] Was that everybody else was going after bigger marketplace than I was and so they were all wildly impressed that we've been able to

[03:35] You know generate a hundred million dollars in a single niche, but they're like man, you know

[03:40] You're really good at this stuff you should be going after

[03:43] Multiple you just go after bigger market like you're in a pond and they're like or a lake you should be going after the ocean and so that was what I saw was

[03:51] Consistent between all of them

[03:53] Was that they were all in oceans and I was in a lake and so that was probably the biggest the second biggest takeaway

[04:01] That I had the third biggest takeaway here's a bonus one for you is that everything that everyone sold there was simple

[04:11] And I'm gonna say simple in two different ways one is that everyone there

[04:15] I was the only one who had three businesses terrible idea

[04:19] I mean we've I've learned my lessons and we've been able to build it

[04:23] But I had to take steps backwards and really work myself to death in order to get all three of them

[04:27] You know over eight and multi figures in order to to work right

[04:32] But I feel like I lost probably two years of development for myself as an entrepreneur because I split my attention and

[04:40] Every single other person there had one business that they were focused on and more specifically one customer and so

[04:47] That was a big lesson for me now

[04:50] You can have multiple businesses but for just about everybody who's listening to this you're probably not that at that level

[04:56] Like and I'm and I'm not saying that you know, docially, but like if you're buying a business

[05:02] That's very different than you starting multiple of them and being CEO of them all

[05:06] If you have multiple businesses and this is a mistake that I made early on and I'm a mistake that I've made again later on

[05:13] If you're CEO of all of them you do like you it's

[05:19] For just about every human besides Elon Musk it's not feasible and

[05:22] So every other person that I know makes who's made a tremendous amount of money made it in one vehicle and then they may own

[05:29] Pieces of other businesses right and if they're the main owner and in multiple businesses which is rare

[05:34] But if they are the main owner and those businesses they are not a partner. They're not an active partner in that business

[05:39] They've hired to CEO. They've hired an executive team that can run and grow that business without them

[05:45] But I remember hearing that when I was younger was like oh man this guy has all these companies

[05:49] He doesn't own all the companies that he's like he's not in it, right? He's not in any of them

[05:53] He's got teams of executives and high-level producers who are incentivized usually with some level of equity in that company and he advises for

[06:01] Chegically and

[06:03] So that was you know again one of the reminders when you'd be reminded more than we need to be taught by self included

[06:10] That one of the mistakes that I was making that everyone else that was not and so I'll recap before you

[06:15] So I'm doing it myself. There's the first was scaling zero. I have to get down to zero in order to scale

[06:19] Otherwise I'll be the bottleneck the second was going after oceans instead of lakes

[06:23] Again remember this is me at my season if you're if you're starting out going after a lake is not a bad idea

[06:28] Which is why me making the decision to just niche down through a single you know niche of gyms was not a bad decision

[06:34] Because it was the right call at that time now we've developed enough of skills that that we now now

[06:40] We've helped agencies and a hundred plus niches generate clients for their clients and so

[06:44] I feel very adapted that skill

[06:47] Third is focusing on one main business as your primary vehicle and

[06:53] Interesting thing that I found out recently was the word the the root of the word the etymology behind the word decide decision

[06:59] So C today like suicide patricide matchricide side is to kill homicide, right?

[07:03] It's kill and so a decision is where you choose to kill off all the other all other things

[07:09] So you you select by elimination right which I kind of like that so it's like when you decide

[07:14] You're actively choosing to kill off other things and so you need to decide what your business is going to be and kill off all of their options and so that is the

[07:24] The third lesson

[07:25] Then I got from all of those those people here that that we're at that mastermind and the fourth one

[07:33] Was every single one of them was selling a tremendously high margin gross gross margin

[07:39] Service and a product except for one of them and the two people who were selling the lowest

[07:45] March and stuff were the smaller businesses and so when I heard that it was really it was challenging for me in a good way of thinking like

[07:53] How can we provide value in bigger ways for less hard costs to assist business owners and risk and so as I think about

[08:02] You know the next moves that I'll do in my entrepreneurial career

[08:04] I'm taking those things in consideration so it's what am I gonna do?

[08:08] That is gonna go after an ocean since instead of a lake

[08:11] What am I going to do?

[08:13] That's gonna be just one thing so not lots of things attacking the ocean just one

[08:17] What thing is going to be you know very high margin but very high value which is difficult a lot of times that you can you can do high margin but love

[08:27] Hopefully you get what I'm saying here. I want to high a high margin thing that is high value

[08:32] And sometimes that's hard to find and then finally I want to structure in such a way that

[08:37] I can get it to the point where I am not the bottleneck of the business because I have

[08:43] Better better decision making leaders so not just not just like in the beginning you have doers and then you have managers

[08:49] And then you have leaders and then you have decision makers and leaders to a certain degree or getting in that it depends on what level of leadership

[08:56] But really find high level people who have the experience of doing this thing in the past

[09:00] They've already run and won the Olympic gold. I don't want to teach someone how to do it. I want someone's already done it and can just

[09:06] Plug right in and comes pre-loaded with the solutions they come batteries included as as Max Paul says and so

[09:14] Anyways, there's are the biggest findings that I had now looking back three months later after the dust is settled from that

[09:21] Half a billion dollar mastermind and there's are the lessons that I took away from it. So I hope that was valuable for you

[09:27] If you want the inner the inner secrets of what what's happening behind the scenes in those in those types of rooms

[09:32] Those are the types of conversations that we're having

[09:35] And I hope you find it valuable and I'll see you in the next vid

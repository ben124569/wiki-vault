## Full Transcript
[00:00] I spent over $500,000 on my own business education.

[00:03] And in every single course, mastermind coaching program workshop,

[00:06] I've become the number one student they had,

[00:08] and then eventually surpass the person who taught it.

[00:10] If you're in the game of entrepreneurship, the game of business,

[00:13] you have to grow in order to get better.

[00:15] And in order to grow, you need to learn.

[00:17] And if you're gonna learn, you might as well do it the right way and win.

[00:20] I had someone say this recently to me, they're like,

[00:23] you know, how do you know what programs to buy?

[00:27] How do you know what workshops to go to?

[00:30] How do you know what courses to listen to or what channels to watch in order to learn?

[00:34] And they're like, how do you know that it's gonna work?

[00:38] And I think that's the question that always gets asked.

[00:40] Is like, how do you know it's gonna work?

[00:42] And I think that fundamentally asking that question shows that it won't work

[00:47] because it is never going to be the thing that works.

[00:51] You are going to be the thing that makes it work.

[00:54] And so when I look back at my history as a student of a continue to be a student,

[00:59] but a student of the game of business,

[01:02] the I have yet to have a negative ROI on any purchase that I've made,

[01:07] whether it's tutoring, courses, workshops, and to be fair,

[01:10] I've bought from from bad people.

[01:12] I've brought from some scumbags of buff and bad teachers,

[01:15] but I have absolutely all-await every single purchase that I've made.

[01:19] And so whenever I hear someone say like, I bought something in it,

[01:21] and it didn't work, it kind of grinds my gears.

[01:25] And I think I've had it and heard it enough times the last month or so

[01:27] that I wanted to make this podcast about it.

[01:30] And so this is what I want to kind of zoom out on is that I want to give you a top down approach

[01:35] in terms of levels of competence and that a bottom up approach from a skills perspective.

[01:38] And I think if you combine both of the things together,

[01:40] you will make a lot more money and you will be more successful at the things

[01:46] that you try to learn.

[01:47] And so if you're like, try to learn how to make TikTok ads to start a second acquisition

[01:51] channel for your business and this will apply to you.

[01:52] If you're a customer of an agency, then this will apply to you.

[01:56] If you're trying to be a student and just get in the game, then this will apply to you.

[02:00] And so the first thing is understanding the levels of competence.

[02:04] And so at the top, the best and the highest level of competence is something

[02:08] that I will call positive active.

[02:11] All right, so you've got the inclination and you've got active repassive.

[02:14] And so there's five levels.

[02:15] All right, so the top is, and the characteristics of somebody who has this belief set

[02:20] is that no one has proven that it cannot be done.

[02:24] And they ask other people to prove to them why they can't do it.

[02:29] And they think I will be the best student that this person has ever had.

[02:34] No matter what, no matter how incompetent of a teacher they are,

[02:37] I will make it happen.

[02:39] I will win because that's who I am, not who they are.

[02:43] Basically, the idea that we make our success dependent on the quality of the teacher

[02:48] puts the power in their hands rather than ours.

[02:51] And so on the flip side of this, the reason that basically any single program in the world

[02:55] will still be able to get positive reviews of some sort is that no matter what,

[02:59] some percentage of real winners will always go into everything.

[03:03] You just look at the public school system.

[03:04] Like more or less a dog-shit system, but there are still winners that come out of it.

[03:09] And it's not because the quality of the teachers is because of the mindset of winners,

[03:12] because winners will win.

[03:15] And so the highest level of this is the example of like Elon,

[03:17] where he's like breaking down to physics.

[03:18] He's like, if you can't show me that it's physically impossible,

[03:21] based on the laws of physics that we know, that it is possible, I'm going to go do it.

[03:25] It's the same concept as Rad, Roger Bannister, running the first four minute mile.

[03:29] Like no one had done it before.

[03:30] And he's like, well, physically, it's not impossible.

[03:32] It's not breaking the laws of physics for me to run a four minute mile.

[03:36] And so that is positive, active.

[03:39] Now underneath of that, you've got the second class of competence,

[03:43] which I would consider positive passive.

[03:46] This is all the people who ran the four minute mile after Roger Bannister.

[03:50] They're the people who say, okay, he did it, so I can do it.

[03:53] And to be clear, this is still good.

[03:55] There's still winners, absolutely, that can do that.

[03:57] And when I look at the people that I've worked with, customers, employees, anything,

[04:02] I can identify.

[04:03] And these are honestly, these are, these are your A-Mightest players.

[04:06] Like they're like, okay, he did it, I can do it.

[04:08] And honestly, that's a great perspective.

[04:10] Like it's not impossible.

[04:12] I just need to do the same stuff they did.

[04:13] And that's awesome.

[04:14] That's the, that's the replicate before you iterate.

[04:17] They're like, I'm gonna just do what they did and get what they got.

[04:19] And that's an awesome perspective.

[04:21] Now, there's three more levels of this.

[04:24] And as we go down, some of you will start nodding your heads as even

[04:27] they're like, you are this person or you know someone who's this person.

[04:30] The third level of competence here is what I'll call neutral passive.

[04:34] And so this is somebody who just says, well, it's worked for other people.

[04:37] Let's see if it works for me.

[04:40] So it no longer goes from I will like prove to me why I can't make it work.

[04:45] Level one, level two, okay, someone has made it work.

[04:49] Therefore, I can make it work.

[04:50] To let's see if it works.

[04:52] You're passively accepting whatever happens and you're just open.

[04:56] Now, this is where the majority of people are.

[04:58] This is where most people just sit.

[05:00] They just live their life passively letting things quote happen to them.

[05:03] And they're sometimes mediocre customers for, for an agency or a vendor.

[05:08] mediocre customers for you.

[05:10] This is the person who goes into the gym and is like, we'll see if your program works

[05:13] for me.

[05:14] Like, I'm, you know, we'll see if it works.

[05:17] Now, underneath of that, you've got level four.

[05:20] All right, this is now we're going down.

[05:22] This is, it might work for other people, but it probably won't work for me.

[05:26] This is negative passive.

[05:28] So they're still in the passive seat, but they're negatively inclined.

[05:32] This is the person who half-ass is.

[05:33] And I'll give you a story about this that happened recently.

[05:35] So we'd have this disorder who came out.

[05:38] It was a salon owner.

[05:40] Okay, so a salon, hair salon owner.

[05:42] And the guy said, hey, I used your gift card campaign.

[05:46] And it didn't work.

[05:49] And I was like, I broke.

[05:50] Like, so I just went through it.

[05:52] I was like, did you get a referral from all the people?

[05:56] Did you write the name down of, he's like, well, I didn't, I mean, I asked them and I told

[06:01] them that they had to use the card on other people, but they came back and trying to

[06:04] use the card for themselves.

[06:05] I was like, well, that's not the play.

[06:07] He said, well, I told them that.

[06:09] And I was like, well, obviously, you didn't tell them well enough because that's not the

[06:12] play.

[06:13] So, and the thing is, I just, let's just stop.

[06:15] I was like, do you want me to take accountability for the fact that the gift card

[06:19] plays work for so many businesses and just not yours?

[06:23] I was like, do you want me to just say it's my fault?

[06:24] I was like, would that make you feel better?

[06:26] And he was like, well, no, I was like, that's what you're coming for.

[06:30] You want me to say that it's my fault.

[06:32] I was like, you didn't do it.

[06:35] You didn't do it right.

[06:36] So you just did something else.

[06:38] And yeah, that's something else didn't work because that's not what the program is.

[06:41] That's not how the gift card play works.

[06:44] If you don't want to talk about it, it's on my YouTube video to whole play.

[06:46] And so, eventually, it got up to be like, okay, I just didn't do it.

[06:49] I was like, cool.

[06:51] Guess what?

[06:52] Now you can do it again and you can do it right because you know what you messed up.

[06:54] You had to let them know is for somebody else and you had to get the referral and you had

[06:57] to get the three-way introduction.

[06:59] Otherwise, they're going to try and use it on themselves, not bringing people in and you're

[07:01] just giving away services for a discount.

[07:03] That sucks.

[07:04] Don't want to do that.

[07:05] He's like, okay, fine.

[07:06] And so we had a little moment and he got over it.

[07:08] Okay.

[07:09] But that's negative passive.

[07:10] That's like, it might work, but it probably won't work for me.

[07:13] And by the theme, if you want to be the best student ever out of all of Mozineation, I have

[07:18] two books.

[07:19] They actually audio books that are for free that I have here on this podcast starting at

[07:23] 5.79.

[07:24] It's my $100,000 offers and $100,000 leads.

[07:26] They have sold over a million copies, $26,000, $5,000 to review something Amazon.

[07:29] If you like hard copies.

[07:30] But if you actually follow the steps, I've got courses on the site that are also free

[07:34] acquisition.com for its last training.

[07:36] If you just follow the steps, prove why it will work for you and it will.

[07:41] Now here's the fifth level.

[07:42] This is the bottom of the barrel.

[07:44] All right, this is the, this is your one-star customers.

[07:47] This is, this is, this is the customer you sign on who just generally sucks at everything.

[07:52] And they take an active role.

[07:54] All right.

[07:55] So this is negative, active.

[07:57] I can prove that this will work for everyone, but me.

[08:01] I have bad luck.

[08:02] Nothing works out for me in the end.

[08:04] I am the special snowflake that nothing works for.

[08:07] My, my body is different.

[08:09] Calories don't affect me.

[08:10] I could starve to death and I am immune to death because I could not eat four years

[08:15] and my body would still hold on to fat because I am special.

[08:20] And so what's interesting about this is something you guys may be laughing about this

[08:23] right now.

[08:24] But some of you are this person.

[08:25] But you just might not be this person in business.

[08:28] You might be this person with your weight, but you're not this way in business.

[08:31] You might be this way in your marriage, but you're not that way in business.

[08:35] Or you are that way in business and you're not in your marriage.

[08:37] You're like, oh, but you know what?

[08:38] Oh, this, this way of communicating.

[08:41] It's not going to work for us, not in our relationship.

[08:44] But I'll prove it.

[08:45] I'll, I'll go to your fucking sessions.

[08:47] I'll follow your little framework for communicating with my wife or my husband.

[08:51] Then I'll prove to you that it won't work because we're so special.

[08:55] That nothing works for us.

[08:57] You want to prove it.

[08:58] And what's interesting about this is that it because underpins a whole set of belief behind

[09:02] this, that your identity is attached to.

[09:04] So it's so much harder to say, listen, I've been fat my whole life and and it's my fault.

[09:11] It's so much easier to just not have it be that way.

[09:14] It's so much easier to be like, you know, I've always struggled with women or art, you

[09:17] know, our marriage has kind of been on the rock, but that's kind of how it's always

[09:20] been that way.

[09:22] And so we, it's so much more difficult to accept that all of that pain and suffering

[09:26] that you've been through is 100% your fault.

[09:29] And so instead, it's easier to just try it actively prove that it won't work.

[09:34] Now, there's some good, there's some interesting stuff about number five.

[09:37] So actually, find number five people very, very interesting because they, in my opinion,

[09:42] have the highest potential to jump from five all the way to one.

[09:46] And I've had so many experiences in my life.

[09:47] This is the one star becomes the five star.

[09:49] This is the, the person that all of a sudden, like something switches and the things

[09:52] they go from negative active, they have the active.

[09:55] They're trying to prove it, but they're proven the wrong thing.

[09:59] They're trying to prove it wrong.

[10:00] But all of a sudden, sometimes if you can get it to swap, they just try to prove it right.

[10:04] And then they become absolute fucking animals.

[10:07] And so I'll tell you story.

[10:08] So there was a gym owner at gym lunch and he was, he was definitely one of these number

[10:13] five's right?

[10:14] He was like, it's not like my gyms in a different market.

[10:17] The people, the people here are different.

[10:19] My weight loss leads are different than everyone else's weight loss leads.

[10:23] My market's different.

[10:24] My zip coach, the corner that my gym is on is different.

[10:28] But all of a sudden he'd been on enough calls and I probably ran to didn't or something

[10:33] on some, on some live call.

[10:36] And he was like, you basically just called me a pussy.

[10:40] And I was like, yeah, probably one way or another.

[10:44] And so he said, I just decided, what if it did work?

[10:49] And what if I took the same energy that I'm doing to try and prove myself right and try and

[10:54] prove this system works?

[10:57] And what if I just did everything as though I, as though it was going to work and I assumed

[11:01] it was going to work?

[11:03] And so he did that.

[11:04] And he ended up becoming one of the top facilities out of the thousands that we had.

[11:08] And then we ended up hiring him because he completely outsourced his gym, made it profitable,

[11:12] made it make more money using the setup that we had.

[11:16] And the interesting part here, and this is what's crazy.

[11:19] Same system, same gift card play, same advertising, same gym model, different approach,

[11:26] different level of competence, showed up in an entirely different way.

[11:30] I'll give you a different example.

[11:32] I had a lady, this is one of my first probably 50 customers at my gym.

[11:36] Her name was Autumn.

[11:37] So Autumn came in and she had the nothing works for me.

[11:40] I have a special thyroid, whatever, you know, if calories, I could starve myself forever

[11:46] and I'd still live.

[11:47] I'd defy the laws of physics.

[11:49] And after like two, three, four weeks, all the people that she had started with started

[11:54] losing weight.

[11:56] And of course now normally in that level five, she'd be like, well that's of course,

[11:59] of course that's what I'm different than that.

[12:01] I'm special.

[12:02] I get my identity from being special.

[12:06] And I just just like, listen, I was like, do you want to be right and fat or do you want

[12:10] to do you want to get skinny?

[12:11] I was like, which one matters more to you?

[12:12] Being right or being thin?

[12:14] I was like, I just had to have a sit on with her.

[12:16] And I was like, just be real.

[12:17] If being right is more born to you, I was like, then you can be right.

[12:20] I was like, but which one's born to pour in you?

[12:22] Being right, being thin.

[12:24] And she was like, I want to be thin.

[12:26] And I was like, then fucking do this.

[12:29] And so she did.

[12:31] And of course, she lost a bunch of weight and then she became one of my top clients and then

[12:34] she started referring everyone.

[12:36] And the thing is, is that when you see a level five turning to a level one, you're like,

[12:39] oh my god, and the thing is they become absolute ambassadors, brand champions for you

[12:44] because you help them get over that.

[12:45] And so I say this from a business owner perspective, because don't lose hope on those people.

[12:49] Sometimes you just have to say, do you want to be right or do you want this outcome?

[12:53] I'm cool either way, but you're the one who has to live with it.

[12:59] And so she decided that she wanted to be thin, which is awesome.

[13:05] And so it's kind of one of those.

[13:06] It's interesting that in like neat, so matrix and star were probably two of my favorite kind

[13:11] of universes of movies.

[13:15] But like Morphees and Yoda sit in very similar positions in terms of the guide for the

[13:19] main character.

[13:20] And so there's a point in the dojo where Morphees looks at Neo and he says, stop trying to hit

[13:24] me and hit me.

[13:26] And so the point there is that when you, it's basically difference in going through the

[13:31] emotions acting as if versus actually trying to succeed.

[13:38] There's trying to do the things that looks like success versus actually trying to win.

[13:42] So we're placed up, trying to hit me and hit me with stop trying to win and win.

[13:46] Stop trying to make ads work and make ads work.

[13:48] Stop trying to hire the sales guy and hire the sales guy.

[13:52] And so it's the idea that like a no-fail situation where there's absolutely somebody.

[13:57] This is like the, the founder who says no one can sell like I can sell.

[14:01] Yeah, no shit.

[14:02] There's people who sell way better than you.

[14:03] You just haven't found them yet.

[14:05] Okay, that means that it's possible.

[14:07] So what are you complaining about?

[14:09] You just need to go do more.

[14:10] Stop trying to make your marketing work and make your marketing work.

[14:14] Stop trying to prove yourself right that you're special and win.

[14:18] It's the same reason that Yoda says there is no try.

[14:22] There's only fail or do and not do.

[14:25] And so it's the same concept because the reason that try such an insidious concept

[14:30] is because it allows the possibility of failure.

[14:33] It basically says that there is a way that this won't work.

[14:38] But if you fundamentally believe that if like even at level two, if someone else can do

[14:42] it so can I, then there is zero possibility of failure because if they can do it, I will

[14:47] do it.

[14:49] And obviously the level above that is even though no one has done it, it is not impossible.

[14:54] And therefore I will.

[14:57] And so that's the top down approach that I want to approach.

[15:00] I said there's two levels of this in terms of thinking through becoming the best student.

[15:05] Is that where are you on that pyramid?

[15:08] Are you level one?

[15:09] Are you level two?

[15:10] Level three, level four.

[15:11] And are you in different places in different domains?

[15:12] Are you some way in your fitness life or some way in your marriage or spouse life or

[15:16] some way in your business life?

[15:19] And notice how you approach it differently.

[15:22] And then look at the one that you're most successful because you're probably going to

[15:25] be better, hopefully better at one of those domains than the other.

[15:28] And think about the thought process you have when you approach it and use trying to think

[15:31] about using that set of beliefs and systems on the one that you fail at the most.

[15:36] And that has been helpful for me.

[15:39] Now the question that I always like to ask because obviously good I've been in the education

[15:44] world and I like education a lot is why, why do we have unequal outcomes?

[15:50] Why is it that you've got 100 people who start and you've got one guy who murders it,

[15:54] one guy who tanks and then you go all these people in the between.

[15:57] And so this is the bottom up approach in terms of thinking about this is the number of skills

[16:05] someone has going into an education process program, whatever, predicts their success.

[16:14] So let me explain.

[16:15] So if you, and this happens all the time, this is the I went through three different

[16:18] things and then I did this thing and then it finally worked.

[16:21] But what you didn't know is that you were building this bridge towards an outcome.

[16:24] And the first thing you did, give you the first five bricks and the second thing you

[16:28] did give you the second five bricks and the third thing you'd give the next five bricks.

[16:32] And then the last thing you did just give you the one last brick you needed to finish the

[16:35] bridge across from where you are to wherever you wanted to go.

[16:39] But the thing is that we attribute all of the success to the last brick just because it

[16:43] was the most recent, not because it was the most important.

[16:46] It's the same thing as like it's kind of weird in the world of like education and

[16:50] business education.

[16:51] It's like, oh man, I used to think this guy was good, now I learned from this guy.

[16:56] But it's like saying, yeah, my kindergarten teacher taught me a simple addition and then

[17:00] my algebra teacher, wow, he really taught me that guy who taught me, you know, simple

[17:04] additions in idiot is like, no, he taught you what you needed to get to where you're at now

[17:09] because skills and education builds on themselves.

[17:13] And so you were able to be successful the algebra teacher because you had the simple arithmetic

[17:17] teacher beforehand.

[17:19] And so we have this weird thing where you get to an advanced level and you think that

[17:22] the person who taught you the basics was somehow wrong.

[17:25] They were just at a different part in your process, in the stage, in building the bridge.

[17:30] And so the reason that some people are successful and you are the last brick, if you're

[17:36] a business owner, for that particular business is that they were able to assemble all those

[17:40] skills at a time.

[17:42] The more skills someone comes in with and also the more meta skills that someone comes in

[17:46] with, the more likely they're able to be successful.

[17:48] And the reason for that is the vigor the instructions can be.

[17:51] And so for example, someone can come to me and say, hey, Alex, can you build a nose strip

[17:56] company for me?

[17:57] And I would say, sure, because I have that skill set to build, I have all of them.

[18:01] Like I know how to market, I know to sell, I know to get product, I know to do logistics,

[18:05] all that stuff.

[18:06] They can just say that, vague of instructions and I can go do it because I have that skill,

[18:09] right?

[18:10] Now, that stack of skills rather.

[18:12] The meta skills you have allow you to bridge the gap where things are vague.

[18:16] And the vast majority of education basically has to meet people at some level, because

[18:20] if you truly start at zero, then it has to be like, here's how a computer works.

[18:24] Here is how a phone works.

[18:25] Here is how you use the internet, right?

[18:27] And of course, most things that you do in education aren't at that level.

[18:30] They're higher up than that.

[18:32] But the thing is is that you might be a level four of education here, but a level one at

[18:36] one of the steps.

[18:37] And then all of a sudden it, quote, doesn't work for you.

[18:39] But it's because you actually have a remedial level of education on that step.

[18:44] And that's where having the meta, meta skill of like, I mean, as simple as this is like,

[18:50] 30% of people can't read good.

[18:52] Like they're just, they're not even, they're not even literate.

[18:55] And so, so of course, they're going to have a harder time trying to learn anything,

[19:00] because they can't even have the ability to learn, right?

[19:04] And so I think about this.

[19:06] And so if something is filled for you in the past, rather than blaming the thing, blaming

[19:10] the fact that you did not have sufficient skills to make it work.

[19:14] And even in the most counter example, where something's absolutely just absolute touch

[19:18] it, because it does happen, right?

[19:20] I think you can still learn what not to do.

[19:23] Some of us had phenomenal examples of what not to do in a marriage from our parents.

[19:29] Some of us had exceptional examples of how not to parent from our parents.

[19:34] We've had exceptional examples of how not to boss from our bosses.

[19:38] We've had exceptional examples of how not to deliver a product from a business.

[19:43] And so sometimes it's using inversion thinking of like, okay, what are all the things

[19:46] that made this horrible?

[19:49] And then do the exact opposite of that.

[19:51] And I think that that's why you can always ROI every single experience you have, because

[19:56] you can always either benefit from it or benefit from the inverse of it.

[20:00] And I think both, like, if you have such a terrible experience, you're like new and innovative

[20:05] ways to ruin my experience.

[20:06] Wow, I didn't even know this existed.

[20:08] Well, if I can do the inverse of that, then that will still give me the benefit of learning

[20:13] from this experience.

[20:14] I still, as much as they wanted to make me fail, I still got better.

[20:19] Like I still will win.

[20:22] And so I'll wrap this with a scene that I like a lot from Invictus, which is a movie

[20:29] from 2006, it's Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon.

[20:32] And Morgan Freeman's Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon's like the head of the rugby team,

[20:36] and it's right during the apartheid when it's the whole racism is that it's, you know,

[20:40] Max or whatever.

[20:42] And he says, I'll read to the quote.

[20:45] He says, how is your ankle?

[20:47] Is it healed?

[20:48] It's one of the first questions he asked him, he was like, I heard that your ankle was hurt.

[20:51] Is it healed?

[20:52] He asked that guy and he said, the truth is sir, this is Matt Damon responding.

[20:55] He said, the truth is sir, you never played 100%.

[20:58] And Mandela responds as in sports as in life.

[21:02] And I liked that a lot.

[21:04] I remember hearing it and we were like, whoa, that like for whatever reason it's heavy when

[21:08] I heard that because we have so many times where we blame the conditions for the lack of success.

[21:14] But the reality is that the champions create success regardless of the conditions.

[21:20] And so they don't look at the education system.

[21:23] They don't look at the thing that the teacher gave.

[21:25] They don't look at what the vendor provided and think, well, I'm going to

[21:28] prove that they were bad so that I can be right.

[21:31] They just win no matter what.

[21:34] And so I think it's like kind of like Tom Brady of like, okay, well, he can go to a different

[21:38] team and still go to the championship, still change the conditions because he forces the

[21:42] winning to occur.

[21:44] And that's why like that is the like that is the quintessential thing that like if you look

[21:50] at your team, if you're a business owner, like who on my team is a level one?

[21:53] Who's a level two?

[21:54] Who's a level three?

[21:55] Who's a level four?

[21:56] Who's a level five?

[21:57] Who wants to just like prove that my thing's not going to work?

[22:00] Who's just like, we'll see if it works.

[22:01] Who's like, I think this can work.

[22:03] Other people have done it.

[22:04] We can do it too.

[22:05] And who's like, we will be the first to do it because there's no reason we can.

[22:10] And I think it's a great way to measure and assess your team.

[22:13] I think it's a great way for you to measure and assess yourself and apply it between different

[22:17] domains.

[22:18] And so I think, as I think about these things for myself, I think the biggest thing that I've

[22:25] been fortunate with is I hate the idea of someone making me worse.

[22:31] And I hate the idea of quote, not getting better from something I invest time to money

[22:35] into.

[22:36] And so I've always had the desire to be the number one person and anything that I ever

[22:41] try and learn.

[22:42] And so it's like, even if this guy's mediocre, I'm going to be the best student he's

[22:45] ever had.

[22:46] No matter what, which has come to bite me in the ass because every single person ever

[22:49] bought something from has claimed that they are the reason for my success.

[22:52] The thing is that I'm just going to get real nasty with you.

[22:58] I've been more successful than every one of their customers and them.

[23:04] So like, fuck you.

[23:06] And so I've always taken it from the approach of replicate before you iterate.

[23:11] So I don't try and get fancy.

[23:12] So this is I'm shifting gear so I'll because I just got a little passionate about this.

[23:16] But like I will do everything they said to the T to replicate what they've done.

[23:26] So if I want to learn something from them, they have been able to do it.

[23:28] And I will do exactly what they did.

[23:30] And then I can get the same result.

[23:32] And then once I've replicated it, then I'm like, all right, her seven ways I can do this

[23:35] better than them.

[23:37] And then I will iterate.

[23:38] But I think one of the other issues that happens is people try to iterate before they

[23:41] replicate.

[23:42] And the thing is, unless you've learned to replicate, you don't know why it worked

[23:45] to begin with.

[23:46] And so you have to retrace the steps.

[23:47] You have to pick up the bread crumbs and be like, OK, that's we did this because there's

[23:51] that hole there.

[23:52] OK, we did this because there's that problem there.

[23:53] OK, got to got to now have a good lay of the land.

[23:56] Now with the other skills that I have that the person who taught me doesn't have, I will

[24:00] make this better.

[24:01] And that's how I think you can stare step your way.

[24:04] Learn from as many people as you can.

[24:06] And when you learn from your third teacher, you can pull from your first and second

[24:10] teacher to try and make what you learn from the third teacher better.

[24:12] But the thing is, is that in any of these paths, you just have to start learning and

[24:16] be willing to know that no matter what happens, as long as you execute you will learn

[24:21] either what to do or what not to do, but you learn either way.

[24:24] And I think that gives you a no fail situation as a student because it means you become an

[24:28] inevitable.

[24:29] Like I will win.

[24:32] Whether it's who you, the next guy, the guy for that, I will win.

[24:36] I will figure this up because there's no way that this is impossible.

[24:39] There's no reason that Facebook ads can work for other people's businesses.

[24:43] No, there's no reason that doing a drug mail campaign, if I can get it into the right

[24:47] business owner's hands, then I cannot find a way to monetize that.

[24:51] There's no way that somebody else can be have a billion dollar roofing company and

[24:55] I have a roofing company that's only doing a million dollars a year.

[24:58] I don't need to change industries.

[25:00] If they can do it, I can do it.

[25:03] There's a way.

[25:04] And I just don't know how yet, but that's a me problem, not a universe problem.

[25:10] And the thing that everyone keeps messing up about this is that they're trying to think

[25:13] that they're proving the system right or they're proving the teacher right or proving

[25:17] the guru right.

[25:18] But you're not doing any of that.

[25:19] You're proving to yourself yet again that you can win no matter what.

[25:24] And I think that's the big difference because some people don't want to win because

[25:27] they want to prove that the teacher's bad.

[25:29] It's like that's like drinking poison and hoping the other person dies.

[25:33] And one of the dumbest things I can possibly imagine, like you want to sacrifice your

[25:37] outcome, your success because you want to show that someone else is bad.

[25:41] The best way to show that someone else is bad is to beat them.

[25:46] And then just keep winning and move on with your life and get them to shrink into a relevant

[25:49] since you grow into your potential.

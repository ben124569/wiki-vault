[00:00] This is brutally honest advice for poor people.

[00:02] I've been there.

[00:03] I had to fucking pay rent every night.

[00:04] I would think if I didn't wake up tomorrow,

[00:06] I'd be okay with it.

[00:07] And I don't want that for anybody.

[00:08] I get it.

[00:14] I was just going through all these old files yesterday,

[00:16] and I saw a goal that I'd written,

[00:18] which was to make $10,000 a month income.

[00:21] And so it was 13 years ago.

[00:24] And so I viscerly remember what that was like.

[00:29] And I know I was so much pain during that time

[00:34] that I get it.

[00:36] And so the reason we make this stuff

[00:37] is because I've been there,

[00:39] and I don't want that for anybody.

[00:41] I missed my 20s.

[00:45] I didn't have them as people traditionally say it.

[00:49] It's weird because in today's internet culture,

[00:53] I started my first brick and mortar business,

[00:56] like store front.

[00:58] It was 23.

[00:59] Like I didn't know shit about fuck.

[01:01] Like I knew nothing.

[01:03] And like I didn't know you could hire employees.

[01:06] Like it wasn't a thought.

[01:07] Like I didn't know anything.

[01:10] And so like I cleaned, I did the billing,

[01:14] I did the sales, I taught the sessions.

[01:17] Like I fixed the equipment.

[01:18] Like I did everything.

[01:20] Because I didn't know,

[01:21] and I didn't know, and I didn't have the money,

[01:23] frankly, to afford anything else.

[01:26] And so I get it.

[01:29] Like I get it.

[01:30] I get it.

[01:35] But to get out of that, you have to take steps.

[01:39] And the first step is saying that it's my fault.

[01:42] The second step is that you have to use what you have.

[01:46] And so in the beginning, I was reading the self-help books

[01:51] and all the stuff.

[01:52] And none of them really hit for me.

[01:56] Because a lot of it was like power positive thinking

[01:59] and like affirmations and like all the stuff.

[02:01] And the reason I make the content I do now,

[02:02] which is now almost become like a stick.

[02:06] Connering that is because it didn't work for me.

[02:09] And I'm not trying to speak to everybody.

[02:11] If that works for you, then like awesome.

[02:14] Like awesome.

[02:16] Like people mistake me saying,

[02:18] this is what work for me with this is what I think

[02:20] everyone should do.

[02:21] And it couldn't be for the furniture.

[02:23] I'm saying if what you have been doing has a

[02:25] moonworking, then consider this.

[02:28] Which is that like I remember because I just read this yesterday.

[02:31] The intro in the book, I say,

[02:35] I wish I could tell you that the reason I was able to make it

[02:38] out of the gym was because I was like really passionate

[02:42] about changing people's lives.

[02:43] And I loved fitness.

[02:44] And I loved my clients' faces when they would light up.

[02:46] And they'd step on the scale and they'd lose weight.

[02:48] They'd be able to fit in their high school clothes again.

[02:50] It was none of that.

[02:52] It was just the sheer anger that I had,

[02:54] but the idea of being wrong and having the people back home

[02:59] be right about everything.

[03:02] And I could, I mean, I still can barely tolerate it.

[03:05] And so I mean, I took in some ways,

[03:10] and this is an, I don't know if woe is me as the right term,

[03:13] but like I had an otherwise very successful career.

[03:17] Like I was in a white collar job.

[03:19] And sometimes it's hard, like, I mean, hey,

[03:22] I don't know, I haven't been the other situation.

[03:24] But taking a step down and humbling yourself

[03:27] to minimum wage after you've been in a white collar situation,

[03:29] not easy.

[03:31] And I remember I had clients who walk in and be like,

[03:33] oh, did you go to college?

[03:35] And they were saying that patronizingly.

[03:40] And mind you, everyone here at least

[03:42] did this channel knows that I don't give a shit.

[03:44] But they were saying it to basically, like,

[03:47] when I was going to write something down,

[03:48] like am I literate?

[03:51] And in those moments, again, it was like,

[03:54] I could be a writer be rich.

[03:55] Like I could try and humiliate them back

[03:56] because the pain and what they just said made me feel,

[03:59] they probably didn't even tend that.

[04:01] Or I can be like, yeah, yeah, I went to school.

[04:04] I'm very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

[04:05] you know, like, so what are your goals?

[04:06] I could just move right past it.

[04:08] And so you develop that skin because I had to,

[04:11] because I had to fucking pay rent.

[04:13] And so, I mean, I tell stories about having a kid

[04:16] drawn marker on the wall while I'm trying to close his mom.

[04:19] And he's writing in permanent marker.

[04:21] And I'm trying not to lose my shit over the fact

[04:22] that I'm having to repaint the wall

[04:24] because she doesn't have a parent a child.

[04:26] But I needed to close the car to pay for the pain.

[04:29] And so it's like, I can scold the kid and lose the sale

[04:32] or I can close the sale and keep my cool

[04:34] and then eventually clean the wall.

[04:36] And so like, you only get that stuff by doing it.

[04:40] And so if you're in, if you're in a place right now

[04:44] where you don't have a lot, you only have one thing which is time.

[04:49] And so you have lower leverage.

[04:51] So I'm not gonna lie to you and say that you're,

[04:53] there's this one play, this one secret.

[04:55] No, it's just, it's sheer brute force.

[04:58] Like you have to will yourself out of it.

[05:01] Like there's, you have to do, it's like,

[05:03] it's a huge amount of soul driving energy

[05:08] that you have to do outside of what you normally do.

[05:10] So it's like, you have to live one person's normal life.

[05:13] You have to do your normal work, your normal job.

[05:15] You have to eat, you have to sleep, you have to clean,

[05:17] you have to do whatever else.

[05:18] And then the work day starts.

[05:22] So that is how you eat today.

[05:23] But you're trying to get ahead and you have to eat tomorrow.

[05:26] And so you have to eat the glass

[05:29] so that you can take the pain today

[05:31] and you're trying to take as much of the pain from tomorrow

[05:34] as you can today so you can get ahead.

[05:37] And like, even the concept of getting ahead,

[05:40] I like, I think about this visually

[05:41] which is like if you have this timeline of life

[05:44] that you can pull towards you.

[05:46] And it's glass in the beginning

[05:48] and then it's slightly less course

[05:51] and then less course.

[05:52] And then it gets neutral.

[05:53] And then it starts to get a little bit sweeter

[05:54] and a little bit sweeter and a little bit sweeter.

[05:56] But you have to get through that glass period

[05:57] where you pull towards you.

[05:59] And I do have this theory that like,

[06:00] on a long enough time rise

[06:02] and if we could live a thousand years,

[06:04] everyone would eventually be successful.

[06:06] But people wait too long and they die too early.

[06:09] And I say die too early in a long, on a long time line.

[06:11] And so I want, I have to live today and tomorrow

[06:16] in the next day so I can live three days at a time

[06:18] so I can get to my second and third life benefits now.

[06:22] And so that was what like,

[06:25] I remember the only times that I took off

[06:27] when I was at the gym.

[06:28] And one of the biggest things that I was grateful for

[06:31] with the gyms is that I moved across the country.

[06:33] And so I knew no one.

[06:34] I was at hundreds of beachals from Baltimore, like no one.

[06:37] And what would happen?

[06:38] So one of the gifts of that was that,

[06:40] once the week was over,

[06:41] so my Saturday sessions were done at noon,

[06:44] my phone didn't ring.

[06:46] No, like in some ways, very sad

[06:49] because no one wanted to see Alex.

[06:51] You know what I mean?

[06:52] No one was inviting me out.

[06:53] But I was like, fuck, like I gotta make this work.

[06:56] And so I would just sit there

[06:59] and I'd be like, how do I sell my memberships?

[07:01] How do I market?

[07:01] How do I, everything, you know?

[07:04] But that was how I got ahead.

[07:06] And so I tell the stories of like,

[07:09] I remember when I stopped washing the ravens.

[07:11] And I was from Baltimore.

[07:12] So I was like, like a tie to home.

[07:21] And so yeah, it's fresh for me

[07:23] because I just read the story yesterday.

[07:24] But it's like, it's tough.

[07:36] Okay, so my breath.

[07:37] So all that to say,

[07:41] the sacrifices that I encourage people to take

[07:43] are not sacrificed, I say, I did not make.

[07:45] And I don't say that there's,

[07:49] there's no ways to get there.

[07:51] I'm just saying that this is the way I got there.

[07:55] And if this path works for you,

[07:58] then maybe it works better than what you're doing right now,

[08:01] which is I'd a lot of pain.

[08:03] And so I try to use it.

[08:07] I just used what I had.

[08:08] I just, you know, I was just angry.

[08:09] I didn't, I didn't want to fail.

[08:11] And so I just kept going.

[08:14] And so there was no like,

[08:17] there just wasn't another option.

[08:20] And so I think that's like,

[08:22] that's what I would encourage people to think about.

[08:24] It was like, they're just,

[08:26] I just didn't, I didn't allow another option

[08:30] because the other option was just worse than dying.

[08:34] Because I mean, I've told this story before

[08:37] and things get hyperboleased.

[08:39] I mean, you know, exaggerated,

[08:40] room-it-sized, whatever, but like,

[08:42] when I had my big consulting job,

[08:44] I was making good money.

[08:46] And I had the approval of my peers and all this stuff.

[08:50] And I just didn't want to wake up the next day every day.

[08:53] And it wasn't like I was trying to kill myself.

[08:54] It wasn't that, but I was, every night,

[08:56] I would think if I didn't wake up tomorrow,

[08:57] I'd be okay with it.

[08:59] And so when I knew that that was what I was going back to,

[09:05] if I didn't make this work,

[09:08] I just had, I had no plan,

[09:10] I mean, I plan B is that I would drive Uber

[09:12] and strip, I joke about that.

[09:13] But that was very much my plan B, if I didn't make it work.

[09:17] But,

[09:20] and I get, I get grown on social media for saying this

[09:23] because of like fucking race wars,

[09:26] but like, there have been slaves for thousands of years.

[09:31] There were slaves in Egyptian times.

[09:32] There were Jews who were slaves.

[09:34] There were Persians slaves.

[09:35] There were white slaves, there were black slaves.

[09:37] Humans have enslaved one another period.

[09:40] And I like to think of things in extremes

[09:42] because it allows me to think of what's possible.

[09:45] And so the idea that someone else at some other time

[09:48] in history has worked seven days a week,

[09:51] every hour of the Therawake,

[09:53] with the threat, not of their own death,

[09:54] but of their children's death.

[09:55] Because that's what I would do

[09:57] if I were trying to control somebody,

[09:58] I would take their kittens, they all kill them,

[09:59] if you don't work.

[10:00] And guess what?

[10:01] They'll probably work.

[10:03] That capacity exists.

[10:06] And so I would think to myself like,

[10:10] I would try and put myself in that frame

[10:13] so that I wouldn't get into the woes me cycle

[10:17] and think all these things I could blame

[10:19] for why I'm here right now,

[10:21] why isn't this working as fast?

[10:22] Like, how is it that these guys are making more money than me?

[10:26] Like why don't these people give me the respect I deserve,

[10:29] blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[10:32] And just say like, what can I do now?

[10:35] And then just every hour of every day,

[10:38] well, what can I do now?

[10:40] And so it was I have to learn how to market.

[10:42] I have to learn how to sell.

[10:44] I have to go to these groups

[10:47] that were other gym owners are,

[10:48] and I gotta learn their stuff.

[10:50] I gotta go to these seminars,

[10:51] and I gotta save up so I can learn some stuff.

[10:54] And that's what I did.

[10:57] And so that's how I got out of it.

[10:58] The visual of life is this bloody game of tug of war,

[11:02] where most people their hand just get too cut

[11:05] to keep holding onto the rope is like,

[11:08] it's stuck in my head.

[11:09] Yeah.

[11:10] It's actually powerful.

[11:12] Yeah, it was tough.

[11:14] So the first 100 grand is the hardest.

[11:20] And I know that that sounds like an unfathomable amount of money.

[11:22] It took me five years, like I get it.

[11:25] So like, you just have to save it one dollar at a time.

[11:31] Like that's what it is.

[11:32] Now obviously I talk about other things.

[11:35] There are smarter ways to make money for sure.

[11:37] Like if you can sell expensive stuff,

[11:39] you can just move the decimals.

[11:40] Like, I mean, like the thing is,

[11:44] it is factually true.

[11:46] It is spiritually false.

[11:47] And I don't even believe in spirituality in general,

[11:49] but like it is tough to sell at $10 million building

[11:56] and make a million dollar commission

[11:57] or a $500,000 commission when you are broke as fuck.

[12:02] It is very like, it is like you would have to become

[12:05] a different person, which is why most people's first sale

[12:07] is not that.

[12:08] But is it technically possible, yes?

[12:10] A lot of people watch YouTube in the internet

[12:14] for complex, money-making skills

[12:17] and they haven't even mastered showing up on time.

[12:20] And so it's like they want to go straight to calculus,

[12:23] but they don't know how to do simple addition.

[12:25] But the thing is, it's like,

[12:26] simple addition is foundational to that.

[12:29] And none of the other stuff will matter

[12:30] unless you can do the basics.

[12:32] But the basics doesn't make them less important,

[12:34] usually they're the foundation of building,

[12:36] which makes them arguably more important.

[12:38] They just are simpler to understand,

[12:41] but not simpler to do.

[12:42] And I think that's the big disconnect lot of people have

[12:44] is that they think they,

[12:45] because they understand something conceptually,

[12:47] that they feel like they have already mastered the skill,

[12:50] which are two very different things.

[12:52] And so one of the most common traits

[12:55] that people who are poor have is that it's always tomorrow.

[12:58] And so they never talk about anything in terms of today.

[13:01] And so it's about starting tomorrow,

[13:03] the diet tomorrow, the diet on Monday, next year,

[13:05] my news resolution, it's always pushing off.

[13:08] So rather than delaying gratification, they delay pain.

[13:14] And so rather than trying taking pain now for pleasure later,

[13:18] they take pleasure now and pain later.

[13:20] And so they flip the equation.

[13:22] And so they're surprised when today is later

[13:26] from yesterday that they're in pain.

[13:29] Because if last week, you were like,

[13:32] I'm starting my diet this week.

[13:35] Then it is now this week,

[13:36] and you've delayed the pain to today.

[13:39] And that means that the body you have right now

[13:42] is the result of the delayed pain

[13:43] that you are now forcing yourself to endure.

[13:46] And so there are somehow surprised

[13:50] when the bill comes due that they pushed off from the past.

[13:55] And so the first lesson of getting out of poverty

[13:58] is two words, it's my fault.

[14:00] It's I have to own that.

[14:02] And I think my fault, you can kind of extrapolate to right now.

[14:05] Not like you basically have to own everything

[14:08] that passed at this moment.

[14:09] So all the pain that I've gone through,

[14:10] all of the Mondays that I've missed,

[14:13] all of the diets that I've skipped,

[14:14] all of the savings I haven't made,

[14:16] all of those are not my dad's fault,

[14:19] my mom's fault, my circumstances fault,

[14:21] the country has boarded and has fault, the zip code,

[14:23] any of those things fault, it's just mine.

[14:25] And the thing is is that people have this belief

[14:27] that because they have a strong argument

[14:29] for why it's something or someone else's fault,

[14:32] that that somehow helps them.

[14:35] And it just doesn't.

[14:36] Because whatever you cast, blame to,

[14:39] is where you also cast power to.

[14:42] And so if I say, I can't succeed

[14:45] because my mom didn't love me, guess who controls me, my mom.

[14:50] And so if you also replace my mom with a race, a gender,

[14:56] a political party, whatever the thing,

[14:58] like I can't succeed because of Trump's laws,

[15:01] I can't succeed because of the radical left,

[15:03] because of wokeism, because of whatever.

[15:06] You actually give that thing more power in your life

[15:09] than you give yourself.

[15:10] And so it's completely, the thing is that,

[15:13] and this is what's so deceiving about it,

[15:15] is it's very self-fulfilling,

[15:19] is that you get more evidence,

[15:20] and you get more confirmation, you get more evidence,

[15:22] you get more confirmation, and the more your life sucks,

[15:23] the more you're confirmed that you were right.

[15:26] But do you want to be right about the fact

[15:30] that your life sucks?

[15:32] Or would you rather, like there's,

[15:34] I think it's an old zigzagler saying,

[15:35] you said you can either be right, you can be rich.

[15:37] And I mean, it's simple,

[15:39] but this is what you was getting at,

[15:41] is that you can say, you know what?

[15:43] You are right, you're dead kicked the shed

[15:45] of your whole life, and you don't have any confidence,

[15:46] because you told your your piece of shit every day.

[15:49] You're right.

[15:51] But in order to be rich, you need to let that go.

[15:53] Because every day you say that I'm not successful

[15:55] because of this, it means because this now owns you.

[16:00] And for me personally, that realization,

[16:04] that the thing that I hated most in the world,

[16:06] the things that I blamed for why my life wasn't the way it was,

[16:10] I was their bitch, and just realizing that made me angry.

[16:16] But through that anger, I was able to say,

[16:19] well fuck them.

[16:20] Like I will succeed, despite the fact

[16:23] that my dad said this, or my mom said this,

[16:25] or Barack Obama said this, or Trump said this,

[16:27] or the woke left says what?

[16:29] Despite that, despite the fact that the chips

[16:31] are stacked against me, I will still win.

[16:35] Why does saying my fault and take a night count of the ability

[16:37] to begin to set someone down in the path of making more money?

[16:41] And so, if you think about success in terms of layers,

[16:44] like foundations, right?

[16:48] The base level, like when you're digging the building

[16:51] where you put the hole and you pour the concrete

[16:52] and the base of the entire thing is, who is in power?

[16:57] Who is source?

[16:59] Because if it's anything but you in that base layer,

[17:03] all of the other things on top of them,

[17:05] will topple down.

[17:06] It's a foundation of sand, otherwise.

[17:08] You can't build on top of blaming other people.

[17:11] There's nothing that stands on it.

[17:13] You see, like, I wanna learn sales,

[17:16] but I can't learn sales, because I didn't get hugged

[17:19] enough as a kid, and so I don't like people.

[17:22] And so as long as you keep holding onto that,

[17:23] you have sand as your foundation.

[17:25] But if you want to learn how to sell,

[17:27] or you want to learn how to market,

[17:28] you wanna learn how to do whatever.

[17:30] Until you say, well, it's my fault that I don't know it

[17:34] and because of that, it's within my power to change it.

[17:38] So it's not sales books, it's not meeting offers,

[17:41] it's not meeting your books.

[17:43] At the very beginning, you have to accept that,

[17:45] which is the first two words, my fault, my responsibility,

[17:48] all me, I am source.

[17:51] And then once you can accept that one thing,

[17:54] and what's crazy is that, that one foundation

[17:56] is where 90% of people literally aren't.

[17:59] They're not there. They can't do it.

[18:02] The reason my girlfriend left me is because of this, not me.

[18:05] The reason I lost my job is because my employer was a dick,

[18:07] my boss sucked, whatever the economy.

[18:10] But it never served you.

[18:13] Like, give me one instance, one example.

[18:17] This is to anyone who's listening to this.

[18:19] One example of when you blame something else,

[18:22] and it made you better.

[18:24] One, you can't find it because it's fundamentally not true.

[18:30] And so you cannot both desire to get better

[18:33] and also maintain blame.

[18:35] You have to pick.

[18:37] When did this really hit home for you?

[18:39] Was it when you lost money?

[18:41] No, when I was 19 years old, I had to write an essay

[18:44] about depression and an introducite class.

[18:47] And I used to, I don't talk about my mother very much,

[18:50] but I used to have a lot of, I was an equal opportunity

[18:53] to angry person. I was angry to everybody.

[18:57] In other words, I blamed everyone.

[18:59] And so I blamed her for x-y-z.

[19:02] And I remember having to write this essay on depression,

[19:09] and you had to do it from someone else's perspective.

[19:11] And so you had to say, how would they,

[19:13] how would the environment and their upbringing,

[19:15] things like that contribute to the outcomes in their life?

[19:20] And so by writing the essay,

[19:22] true or not to be clear,

[19:25] about my mother's upbringing and how hard she had as an immigrant

[19:28] coming here, getting beat up as a kid,

[19:30] getting made up for not being able to speak the language, all the kind of stuff.

[19:32] And this is in the fucking 50s.

[19:34] It's one like it was more accepted to beat up foreigners.

[19:38] Rather than let them in. Anyways.

[19:40] So she had a tough time.

[19:43] And so it made sense.

[19:45] And when I framed it like that, I was like,

[19:47] maybe she's actually a massive success given where she started.

[19:52] And so then I thought to myself,

[19:55] now mind you, I still wasn't over it.

[19:57] But it was in this process that the first thing that happened

[20:00] is when I went back home for a fall break or winter break.

[20:03] I remember she said something to me,

[20:05] which would normally just be the beginning of some big fight.

[20:07] You know, you get into these routines.

[20:08] I'll say this thing that we both hate,

[20:10] and then we'll just get into nice fight about it.

[20:12] And she said the trigger.

[20:13] And I was just like, I understand you.

[20:16] I'm sorry you went through this stuff you went through.

[20:20] And she just like looked completely shocked

[20:22] and then just like started falling.

[20:24] And so I was like,

[20:26] work cool, like you don't anger me anymore.

[20:29] And I think for the most part since then,

[20:31] like that's been more or less the dynamic that shifted.

[20:35] But leading into that was also the idea that

[20:38] all the relationships that I had that I'd blamed

[20:42] for not working because of the dynamic that I had with my mother.

[20:45] I was like, I am giving her this power over my love life.

[20:52] That's gross.

[20:54] And so I was like, well, I'd rather just say it's on me

[20:58] to change and not have my mom or parents

[21:01] that all involved in my relationships.

[21:03] And so that was me taking,

[21:06] it's her fault that I can't make these things work.

[21:09] I have commitment issues.

[21:10] I don't want to get close to people.

[21:11] I've been hurt before blah, blah, blah.

[21:13] So like, okay, well, let's take it to the next or a shame.

[21:17] Great, you're right.

[21:19] You'll never be close to anyone.

[21:21] You'll never have a relationship that I'll last.

[21:23] You're right.

[21:24] Now what?

[21:26] I remember I was out of conference

[21:29] and I had this lady stand up in the crowd

[21:32] and I had just done a thing on like,

[21:35] I don't remember what it was.

[21:36] Call it offers.

[21:37] And she stood up and said,

[21:39] let me give you six reasons why this isn't going to work for my business.

[21:42] And so she went down her list and I was like,

[21:45] haha, haha.

[21:46] So I got to the end of whole thing.

[21:48] And she said, and that's why this isn't going to work for my business.

[21:52] And I was like, you're right.

[21:53] You'll never be able to make this work for your business.

[21:55] And she looked at me like angry.

[21:59] And she last backed, she was like, yes, I will.

[22:02] I'll be able to make this work for my business.

[22:04] For this reason, this reason.

[22:05] And so the thing is that like,

[22:07] if the victim frame is just taking to the natural extreme,

[22:10] you realize that you're right.

[22:12] You win the game.

[22:13] And by being right the entire team,

[22:15] you lose everything.

[22:16] And so it's one of those frames that I love Dr. Cash.

[22:19] She says this.

[22:20] He says, you're 99% right, but 100% wrong.

[22:23] And what that means is like,

[22:25] for example, if I, every time I bring a girl home,

[22:28] and I want my parents approval,

[22:30] I bring her home,

[22:31] and they say, this isn't the one.

[22:33] This isn't the one. She's not good enough.

[22:34] Whatever it is, every time.

[22:35] It's easy for them to say that because every single person you date,

[22:39] except for the one you marry, they are right on.

[22:42] And so they're 99% of the time they're right.

[22:44] And they're confirmed by saying that that person that you bring home

[22:47] is not good enough.

[22:48] Because every time, eventually you break up,

[22:50] oh, it's not going to last.

[22:51] This isn't the one. It keeps going, right?

[22:53] But if you keep doing that all the way to the next real extreme,

[22:56] you're 100% wrong.

[22:57] Because you will be wrong eventually.

[22:59] And it's the same thing as like,

[23:01] I want to start this business. It's not going to work.

[23:03] It's not going to work.

[23:04] The second one will work. The fifth one will work.

[23:06] And they're right.

[23:08] But they're just wrong on the long enough time rising

[23:11] because one of them will fucking work.

[23:13] And one of the girls or one of the guys that you bring home

[23:15] will be the one that you are going to be with.

[23:18] But it's so much safer for them to be right and right.

[23:21] And they get deceived by their short-term rightness

[23:26] that they missed the long-term wrong.

[23:28] And we do this to ourselves too when you're in the victim frame.

[23:32] I don't even like using the victim frame,

[23:33] but when you're in the powerless frame.

[23:35] You give the power away and you get to be right over.

[23:38] That's why it didn't work.

[23:39] This didn't work. This relationship won't work.

[23:40] This job won't work.

[23:41] It's not going to work this time either.

[23:43] Because you get to be right over and over.

[23:44] And it makes you feel good in the short-term.

[23:45] But in the long-term, you guarantee the loss.

[23:48] I think there's also social reinforcement.

[23:50] We love to complain about the weather.

[23:53] It's literally the same thing as never investing.

[23:56] Like if you want to invest your money,

[23:57] you have all this big pile of savings.

[24:00] If you ever invest,

[24:02] there's always the possibility that it goes down in the short-term.

[24:04] It's just the nature of markets in general.

[24:06] But if you never invest,

[24:08] you guarantee that you will never get rich over the long haul.

[24:11] And so every day, you could make this risk.

[24:14] You take a small risk,

[24:15] but you guarantee a macro win.

[24:17] So you take a small risk today,

[24:19] potential for loss today,

[24:21] for the guarantee over the long haul that it grows

[24:23] and it makes you money.

[24:24] But the flip side is you don't take the small risk of loss today.

[24:28] You take the comfort today for the guarantee that you get the long loss.

[24:32] And so so many people flip their life to that same thing

[24:35] and say they flip the pleasure for today.

[24:39] And they just forget the second half of this,

[24:42] which is pain for tomorrow.

[24:43] And that today is also yesterday's tomorrow

[24:46] and we're living through the pain that you cast.

[24:49] Like you own this.

[24:50] And until you're like,

[24:51] this is my fault them in pain today

[24:53] because the decisions that I put off pain for tomorrow

[24:56] were today is tomorrow.

[24:57] When you're broke,

[24:59] every dollar means so much to you.

[25:02] But,

[25:04] and you want to see the dollars in your bank account go up.

[25:08] But I never made that my goal.

[25:11] I made the amount of money I made every month my goal.

[25:14] Because I saw that as my potential energy versus stored energy.

[25:19] Not to get,

[25:20] I mean, whatever physics people you go, I'm saying.

[25:23] And so I was willing to take that stored energy

[25:26] and reinvested to take $5,000 a month in income

[25:29] to make it $6,000 a month.

[25:31] Because I knew that over a year I was going to make $12.

[25:33] And so if it cost me $2 to make the $12 income,

[25:36] I would make that trade every time.

[25:38] And so whenever I'd save up a small, like,

[25:40] not,

[25:41] now obviously,

[25:42] I've always been pretty good about spending money.

[25:44] Like, I haven't had that, that haven't.

[25:47] So again, foundations like first it's your fault.

[25:50] Second, spend less than you make.

[25:52] Third, take all of the excess and spend it on making more.

[25:56] Because if you're making minimum wage,

[25:59] I'm going to say what you probably already know.

[26:02] You're not going to get ahead.

[26:04] Like, you're not going to save your way there.

[26:06] You're not.

[26:07] Like everyone loves to tell a story of that one-girl at McDonald's,

[26:09] but you know they don't tell the other 100 million people

[26:11] who've worked in McDonald's over the world who didn't make it.

[26:14] And like, the outcome they're talking about is like,

[26:16] she made $8 million over 40 years or we're in McDonald's.

[26:19] Like, you can shoot for more.

[26:22] So like, take the money you make, live on nothing.

[26:26] And the hard part is just swallowing the pride for the fact that in this short term,

[26:29] everyone's going to be right when they say that you're a melting to nothing.

[26:32] And that's the tough part.

[26:33] That's the glass that you have to, you have to swallow,

[26:36] they have to pull towards you.

[26:38] And there's just no other way.

[26:41] Like you have to learn the skills.

[26:42] Now, I mean, to be fair, you two didn't exist.

[26:45] What am I what I was doing this?

[26:48] And like, Instagram was like a new platform.

[26:50] So like, all this stuff like this stuff we have today is crazy.

[26:53] Like, this is like these videos and this podcast.

[26:55] Like all the stuff that didn't, like, I remember when podcasting came out.

[26:58] Like, I was already a business owner.

[27:00] Like none of the stuff existed.

[27:02] But at the time, I just took all the money I had.

[27:04] And I want to make this point again is that

[27:07] people think that the money is about buying courses and stuff like that.

[27:10] And you can.

[27:11] Like there's nothing wrong with that.

[27:12] I've learned a ton from a lot of the stuff that I bought to be really honest with you.

[27:15] But I think that I've always had an amazing return on education because I always did it.

[27:19] And I think like I always wanted to be the best student in every class.

[27:22] And I was good at school.

[27:23] And I, and I just took businesses a different,

[27:25] another, another type of school.

[27:27] But part of the expenses that come into like what you take that money for is experiments that fail.

[27:32] And so one of the things that happens when you're broke is that you bet on stuff.

[27:36] And then it doesn't work and people feel like they're back at zero.

[27:39] But you're not back at zero.

[27:40] You're at where you were.

[27:41] Plus one experience.

[27:43] Plus two experiences.

[27:44] Plus three experience.

[27:45] Plus four experience.

[27:46] But when you have plus 18 experiences all of a sudden.

[27:48] Boop.

[27:49] You level up one.

[27:50] You get experience points.

[27:51] There's a reason a video game's come experience point.

[27:53] So you didn't trade it for nothing.

[27:54] You got an experience point.

[27:55] And then with enough experience points, you get to the next level.

[27:58] And so I think if you just even thought about it like that,

[28:00] it's not a loss, but an experience point.

[28:02] It could get you could bridge the gap between your current income level and the income level that you want to get to.

[28:06] And then guess what?

[28:07] There's more experience what that you have to get there.

[28:09] And those experience points also cost more money.

[28:12] Because when you take a bet in the beginning and when I say it costs money,

[28:15] if you were running an ad and it doesn't work, it costs money.

[28:18] If you want to set up a Shopify store or an e-commerce store.

[28:21] And you spend 30, 40, 50 bucks a month, whatever.

[28:24] It costs money.

[28:26] And it does, you know, like all of these things cost money to start.

[28:29] Now mind you, cost a lot less than it did in the 20s when you had to mortgage your house and guarantee that you'd win or you lose everything forever.

[28:34] So like the bar has never been lower than it is now.

[28:37] But there still is a bar and you have to get over it.

[28:39] And I still think that the vast majority of the shit that people trying to get over has nothing to do with the difficulty of business.

[28:44] But the first step, the foundation, which is my fault, that I am here.

[28:48] And in it being my fault, I am the one who can get me out of it.

[28:52] It sounds like in that stage the reason you start experimenting and investing in that.

[28:56] And let's say the kid who has failed to drop should be experimenting and it starts a school group.

[29:00] But they want to win the school games but they don't.

[29:02] They're measuring stake for whether or not they're doing well.

[29:04] Shouldn't be how much money they're making.

[29:06] Or should they be thinking about money at that point or.

[29:10] So the wealthiest people I know.

[29:16] Only think about skills.

[29:18] They think about what can I learn and then what can this skill get me.

[29:21] And so they will always.

[29:24] Take any money they can to buy more skills.

[29:29] And in the beginning you have to buy all the skills yourself.

[29:33] Once you have enough skills that you can generate an accessive income, you can start buying other people's lives.

[29:39] And I mean by that is like everything comes down to buying time.

[29:42] And so at some point your 10 years into your career and you have a handful of skills.

[29:47] But you can buy someone else's 10 years of skills by just paying them to do something too.

[29:51] So you don't have to learn all those things.

[29:53] And so you do need to get good at stuff and then eventually you generalize to be good at people.

[29:57] And that's pretty much always the path for everyone.

[29:59] Maybe the framing is like a lot of people who are wanting to make money just don't know what the happen is.

[30:04] Yeah.

[30:05] So a lot of people who want to make money don't understand how money is made.

[30:10] And so it's made by getting it from someone else.

[30:13] And they have to give it to you voluntarily or it's theft.

[30:16] And so assuming you don't want to steal then you have to give something to someone else first.

[30:22] And then by doing that they give you money in exchange which is why I love capitalism.

[30:27] It's a voluntary exchange between two parties.

[30:30] And both parties say thank you at the end because both parties think they're better off from the trade.

[30:35] And so the idea is what you want to be able to do is find something valuable to trade.

[30:40] And so you can either trade stuff.

[30:43] You can find a place where you can get stuff and then bring it to other people where it's convenient for them.

[30:48] So they pay you more than you did when you had to go find it at some back alley.

[30:52] Because you know suburban mom doesn't want to go into back alley to go X, Y, and Z.

[30:56] But you'll give it to her.

[30:57] Man, it sounds like I'm explaining drugs.

[30:59] But well, there's a reason they make money.

[31:02] But anyways, point is that you can sell stuff at a margin and a part of that margin.

[31:08] It's going to be the convenience that you deliver them.

[31:10] And either you're selling stuff that someone else manufactures you create your own stuff.

[31:13] And if you're starting out you're probably going to sell someone else's stuff.

[31:15] And I do think, I mean I'm saying this right now.

[31:19] I do love the concept that the first thing you sell is not the last thing you're going to sell.

[31:25] And so learning to sell in and of itself the best way to learn to sell is sell something.

[31:29] And that's why referral programs and bass guitar programs affiliate programs for different types of businesses.

[31:36] I want to every business I've ever owned has an affiliate program.

[31:39] It's great to enroll in those.

[31:41] I'm not even going to say any of the names of the companies that we have because I want you to,

[31:44] It's not about that.

[31:45] I want you to, if you can just, because then you only have to figure out one skill.

[31:49] Like if I just sell someone, if I just promote, I get paid.

[31:52] Cool.

[31:53] And I can just get over and over again.

[31:54] Now over time you're like, man, I want to make more of the nut.

[31:57] Cool.

[31:58] Then you just eat up more of the responsibility.

[32:00] So you can either sell stuff or you can sell skills.

[32:06] You can sell outcomes.

[32:08] And so that's where you develop a certain expertise.

[32:10] So like in the beginning for me.

[32:11] And like the first time this ever, like the first money I ever made from a stranger was that I had a lady at the gym.

[32:18] Some real story.

[32:19] I was in really good shape.

[32:21] I like things.

[32:22] So and she said, well you meet me and do an nutrition consultation for me.

[32:27] And she didn't even say that.

[32:28] She said, well you help me with my food.

[32:29] I think so she said.

[32:30] And I said, sure.

[32:32] And so we met at a pizza place ironically.

[32:35] Now this was after college.

[32:37] So this after graduate from college, when I was still consult.

[32:40] So I went, we met at a pizza place.

[32:43] And I was like, okay, well, what are you currently eating?

[32:46] And she was like this.

[32:47] And I was like, well, what do you want to do?

[32:49] She's like, I'm trying to lose weight.

[32:50] And I was like, well, this is something I eat for breakfast.

[32:53] It's less calories than your thing.

[32:54] It's pretty good.

[32:55] Try this and try this and it took like an hour.

[32:57] And then I like a no pad and I gave her the notes or whatever.

[33:01] And she took out her purse.

[33:03] And she wrote $200 on a check.

[33:04] And she handed it to me.

[33:05] She was like, thanks so much.

[33:07] And I was like, looked at just looking at the check, looking at her, looking at her.

[33:13] And I was like, okay, don't have to surprise.

[33:16] And I was like, thanks.

[33:18] And then she laughed.

[33:19] And I was like, holy shit.

[33:20] I was like, I just got paid for, but like realistically, I had been at this one.

[33:24] I'm just competing.

[33:25] Some winning.

[33:26] I'm like, I had a state record at that point.

[33:27] Like, I was in, I was in shape.

[33:28] You know what I mean?

[33:30] And I think she knew I was a state record holder because the gym that I was, it was probably

[33:33] a thing, but I had done some stuff.

[33:37] I had gotten some level of authority on some tiny thing.

[33:40] And people were like, oh, can you help me with that, too?

[33:44] And to be really honest with you, my entire life.

[33:46] And I'm saying, like, there's a many paths.

[33:48] But like, my life has been learned something, get good at it.

[33:52] Have evidence that you are good at the thing.

[33:54] And then people ask you for help on that thing.

[33:56] And so in the beginning, people ask me how to get in shape.

[33:59] And then I started a business around getting people in shape.

[34:01] And then people who had businesses around getting people in shape, asked me how I was getting my businesses that were getting people in shape to work.

[34:06] And then people who had businesses that were a national scale that helped people in a specific nature industry.

[34:11] So it asked me how I was helping people in a specific nature industry.

[34:14] And then people who had really big businesses just started asking me, how did you get really big business?

[34:18] And so like my entire life has been simply doing as hard as I fucking could to get good at something.

[34:23] And then do it enough times.

[34:25] And to be really like very clear with you, every time I did it, it was not too move on to the next step.

[34:29] It was to just get good at the thing.

[34:31] And then by getting good at the thing, people ask me about it.

[34:34] And so it wasn't like I lost 10 pounds and then tried to start selling weight loss advice.

[34:39] I had multiple state records.

[34:42] And I like, I looks good.

[34:45] You know what I mean?

[34:46] Like I was very good shape.

[34:47] And then people started asking me about it.

[34:50] And then I didn't have one gym and start telling people, hey, here's how you run in jail.

[34:54] I'd six gyms by the time I was 26.

[34:57] And then people were like, okay, you're 26 new six gyms.

[34:59] You did all of cash flow like you're doing something right.

[35:02] And then people started asking me about the stuff.

[35:04] And then when I had the licensing business doing 4 million a month,

[35:08] people who had other bigger businesses are doing a million a month or 500,

[35:11] and they're like, how do you get to 4 million a month?

[35:13] And I was like, well, this is what I did.

[35:15] And so like, I've just tried to figure it out.

[35:17] And it's like the path has always been revealed as I took more steps.

[35:21] And so I think a big fallacy in the early on days is trying to think that you're going to figure out the entire path before we even take the first step.

[35:27] It's just not true.

[35:29] I was going to ask how important is it for someone to have that moment with the chat,

[35:33] would they just make the first?

[35:34] I mean, in some ways, I think it's everything in other ways.

[35:37] It's nothing like one of the cool shameless plug for school.

[35:40] The 30.44% of people who finish their first month of school make their first dollar online.

[35:46] And that's like so like, that's why we do it.

[35:52] You know what I mean?

[35:54] I know how hard that first dollar is.

[35:56] They're so much to get the first dollar across the river.

[35:58] Because the second dollar comes so much faster after that.

[36:02] That's why I'm investing in the company.

[36:04] That's why I'm so adamant about it.

[36:06] But anyways, the first dollar is the second dollar comes.

[36:08] Anyways, the point is that yes, I think having the first dollar get across is very important.

[36:15] But if you can reframe it from that experience point perspective,

[36:18] that there's probably three levels before that.

[36:21] You have to level one is that you have to understand this my fault.

[36:24] Level two is that you have to use what you have,

[36:27] not what you wish you had to get to where you want to go.

[36:30] And where you want to go isn't 100 steps forward.

[36:32] It's just the next step.

[36:34] And so like I don't think that anger drives me as much as it used to.

[36:38] But it was everything that I had when I started.

[36:42] And so if I had listened to the positivity mantra when I started,

[36:45] I never would have gotten going because nothing made me feel happy.

[36:49] And so they were like, follow your passion.

[36:51] I was like my passion is to not be poor.

[36:53] It's not be here in Baltimore.

[36:56] That's my passion is not be here.

[36:58] And so that's what drove me.

[37:01] And so I think that it just needs to be restated that like,

[37:04] is that the goal sure, but is that necessary to start?

[37:09] No, it's not.

[37:11] And so I can't tell you that even when I was angry and getting through that,

[37:16] making more money did make my life better.

[37:18] Like I had more ability to deal with inconveniences,

[37:21] hassles, health issues from family members that I had to put the bill for,

[37:24] like all these things, like money can provide value.

[37:27] And so I'll say this thing in a month or two told me,

[37:31] he said money does not buy happiness, but it can help you avoid pain.

[37:35] And so like I think that there's nothing wrong with getting to with making money.

[37:39] Obviously I like doing it.

[37:42] But I just hate the people who espouse that you have to feel a certain way to win,

[37:50] or that winning when you are angry or sad or in pain or ashamed,

[37:56] is somehow wrong.

[37:59] And so I just like you have to meet success where you're at.

[38:02] If the first step you have to take out anger and the next step you have to take out of sadness,

[38:06] then the next one you have to take out a shame and use that to prepare yourself.

[38:09] What all that matters is you take the step.

[38:12] And one of the things that I always like is for a very long time,

[38:15] I didn't consider myself a good person.

[38:16] I mean, I still probably don't, but in terms of like,

[38:20] I always identified with the villain in the oppressor in most scenarios,

[38:25] which is bad, but anyways.

[38:28] But there's a point to this, is that I never thought that I deserved the good life.

[38:35] I never thought I didn't think I deserved the happy ending.

[38:38] I put it that way.

[38:39] And so the thing that got me through that was the idea,

[38:45] and this felt like honestly like gaming the system,

[38:48] so like from the evil side, was that I could still get the good guys ending.

[38:54] If I just did the thing that they do to get the ending.

[38:58] So I didn't have to do it with pure intentions.

[39:02] I didn't have to do as a great guy.

[39:04] But if I just still did the things, I could still get the getting.

[39:08] And I think for me that that realization has been why my ruthless focus on like,

[39:13] what did you do?

[39:15] And to everyone who listens to my stuff, like it's like great.

[39:18] Throw the emotions out, throw the spiritual energy vibrations out.

[39:23] What do you do?

[39:25] Patience is just figuring out what to do in the meantime.

[39:28] Like, courage is acting as though.

[39:31] You weren't afraid.

[39:32] Like, like, what do you do?

[39:34] And then eliminating everything else and then just doing that.

[39:36] And then doing whatever mental tricks you have to do,

[39:38] which is like, there were slaves who were seven days a week, so can I.

[39:41] Like, and then alternatively catastrophizing the alternative path,

[39:48] which is that if I do not do anything,

[39:51] this is what will happen eventually.

[39:53] That pain in the future will be my pain today.

[39:56] And then actively thinking about what that pain would be like.

[39:59] And then seeing if that can make you more uncomfortable than the comfort of your own.

[40:03] And I think Tony Robbins says, as he says,

[40:06] change happens when the pain is staying the same.

[40:09] Sorry, when the pain of change is less than the pain of staying the same.

[40:12] And so if you were comfortable and staying the same,

[40:15] the point is to make yourself more in pain to get yourself to move.

[40:19] And so I think if there is a skill in being able to future pace and think through what pain you're going to go through.

[40:26] Like if you're like, man, okay, I have gained five pounds a year.

[40:30] And it has been four years, so I'm 20 pounds up.

[40:33] Well, if four years from now, I'm another 20 pounds heavier.

[40:36] And imagining the snide comments at the holiday party,

[40:41] or the, if you're a girl, the guy who says, man,

[40:44] she'd be really cute if she lost 40 pounds.

[40:46] Or like even, like I'm going girls perspective here.

[40:50] A guy who says something that's like, um,

[40:53] I would be with her, but she's just, she's just too fat.

[40:57] She's just not cute enough.

[40:59] And you're like, wow, that's so politically incorrect.

[41:01] Deal with it. It's fucking life.

[41:04] But the thing is, is like your thoughts don't need to be politically correct.

[41:08] They're your thoughts. They're no one else's thoughts.

[41:10] And so whatever you have to do to get yourself there.

[41:12] And for me, the idea that a girl that I would want to be with would be like,

[41:15] I don't think he's ambitious enough. I don't think he's successful enough.

[41:17] Like that, those ideas killed me.

[41:19] And so I never wanted to be denied entry to somewhere

[41:22] because I didn't have these things.

[41:24] Now, do I believe that people should be denied entry?

[41:27] No, but I also realize that's the way the world is.

[41:29] And so I think you can balance both beliefs.

[41:31] Like I'd love things to be different, but I accept the fact that they're not.

[41:34] Is this really good argument for getting to other girlfriends?

[41:36] Because I bet other girlfriends reduce the pain of staying the same.

[41:40] A friend who supports you is someone who deliberately

[41:44] decreases the possibility of failure.

[41:49] And so if you look at your friends and you ask yourself,

[41:53] Does this person increase or decrease the possibility of failure with my goal?

[41:58] It's very easy to answer that question.

[42:00] So yes, you know, it's increased or decreased.

[42:01] There's no one between you.

[42:02] Do they increase or they decrease my possibility that I get to my goal?

[42:05] If the answer is decrease, and get rid of them.

[42:11] Imagine that you have 100% chance of hitting your goal.

[42:14] And you have three friends that have a 30% decrease.

[42:17] Like you might now have a fucking whatever third time three is.

[42:21] If you have a 27% chance of hitting your goal in the end,

[42:23] because you have three terrible friends.

[42:25] They may get an experience.

[42:26] Yeah, yeah.

[42:28] It's like getting in video games.

[42:31] It's like you've got somebody who's casting a slow spell on you.

[42:33] And you're moving so slow and you're like weak and all your hits have half power.

[42:38] Like a lot of people need to shed friendships.

[42:43] But the thing is, it's more that they call them friends, but they're not really friends.

[42:47] They're just there.

[42:48] And they're there because they've always been there.

[42:51] But not because they should be there, but because they're going to help you get to where you want to go.

[42:55] They're just there.

[42:56] They exist.

[42:57] They're not going anywhere.

[42:58] They don't have goals.

[43:00] And they're in a different part in their journey.

[43:01] There's nothing wrong with that.

[43:03] But if you were going to start the path of drinking glass and starting to double

[43:07] time, you've got to live your life and you've got to live tomorrow's life for the next days of life.

[43:11] And start dragging that towards you.

[43:13] They're going to be upset about it.

[43:17] And so one of the things I recently have that I like a lot, which is there are no social obligations,

[43:23] only social consequences.

[43:25] And the people who want to deliver those consequences,

[43:29] often do it by talking to you less and by avoiding you more.

[43:34] They try to spend less time with you and talk to you less to punish you for the fact that you missed the part of you missed

[43:40] the going out.

[43:41] You didn't shut up to their wedding.

[43:42] You didn't shut up to their dogs, christening or whatever.

[43:45] But the crazy thing is is that if you felt obligated to go,

[43:49] that it means you didn't want to go.

[43:52] And if that means that if you didn't want to go, and the punishment of not going is that you don't have to go more in the future,

[43:58] because they avoid you.

[43:59] They don't invite you anymore.

[44:00] Then to me that's a win-win.

[44:02] You save time today and you save time tomorrow.

[44:04] And I don't understand why people are not willing to do it that.

[44:07] Like just looking at what happens rather than whatever emotional noise they make with their face at you.

[44:12] Like moving past that great you expelled air at me, understood.

[44:15] Got it.

[44:16] But the outcome is you will no longer invite me, which is what I want.

[44:20] Great.

[44:21] I feel like we won here.

[44:23] And so thinking second and third order outcomes from what happens when I quote break up with this front

[44:29] or what happens when I offend this friend.

[44:32] A lot of times it's you closer to your goal.

[44:35] And I've always been okay with that.

[44:38] And like if someone, if someone, like the moment I have seen somebody as decrease in the light that I hit my goal,

[44:47] I am happy to tell them that.

[44:50] Like I think you are not good for me.

[44:53] I don't think you help me hit what I want to hit.

[44:55] And they're like well then they'll try and downgrade your goals.

[44:58] And say you shouldn't believe this way.

[45:00] And then they'll cast their beliefs on you.

[45:02] And for me it's like that's amazing that you believe that.

[45:04] I don't believe that and I don't really want to believe what you believe.

[45:07] Because then I would have your life and I certainly don't want that.

[45:10] And so like again I make these tweets about this but it's like if you don't like their life,

[45:15] don't listen to what they say.

[45:16] Like don't take their advice if you don't like what you see.

[45:19] And so if everyone around you has a life you don't want,

[45:24] then don't listen to any of their advice.

[45:27] Like hopefully you're listening to this and watching if there's some element of my life or whatever that you find awesome,

[45:32] cool then maybe some element I can share is helpful for you.

[45:36] But you have to book blinders on because there is a period of time where you and I'm going to have said this.

[45:41] But you're not going to be successful enough for the next tier of friends.

[45:44] But you're too different from the friends that you used to have.

[45:47] And so that middle path is very lonely.

[45:49] But the good thing about loneliness is you've got time and right now times what you need.

[45:53] Because you've got to learn stuff.

[45:54] You've got to get the skill so you can start trading that for more money and then you can take the money and trade that for more money.

[45:58] But in the beginning you just have time and that's what you have to spend.

[46:02] And so if you are broke or you are poor and wish to no longer be broken poor.

[46:08] The first is owning the fact that everything that has to do with your life is your fault.

[46:15] And a lot of people will reject that and you're right.

[46:19] Stay poor.

[46:20] You're totally right.

[46:21] You'll never be successful.

[46:22] You're totally right.

[46:23] I believe you.

[46:25] The next step is being willing to use what you have rather than what you think you should have or what you wish you had.

[46:34] The circumstances, the connections, the money, whatever.

[46:37] The passion, the purpose, the meaning behind the work.

[46:41] You can wish for all that stuff.

[46:43] But you don't have it.

[46:44] So you have to use what you have.

[46:46] Which could be anger, it could be shame, it could be pain, whatever.

[46:51] And then as soon as you start taking action,

[46:55] everyone around you will collapse and try to pull you down.

[46:59] And so the only way to protect yourself against that is to increase your own approval of self and decrease how much their opinion of you matters.

[47:10] Which means that you have to be proud of you for taking the step.

[47:16] And actively look at their lives and think, do I want what they have?

[47:21] If the answer is no, then do not listen to what they say.

[47:27] And then when you do that, you keep taking steps.

[47:31] No matter how painful it is, then you never stop.

[47:35] And if you do that, you will get there.

[47:40] So, go.

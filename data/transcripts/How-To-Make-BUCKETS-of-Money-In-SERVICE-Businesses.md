[00:00] What's going on everyone? I want to show you in this video one of the fastest ways to make a tremendous amount of money in a service business

[00:05] All right, so right now if you want a service business or any kind of business where you provide stuff

[00:08] Two questions if you sell stuff and this is for you

[00:11] Just so you if you don't know me my name is Alchema is the own acquisition.com

[00:14] We do about 85 million dollars a year in revenue and this channel is just because a lot of people are broken

[00:18] I don't want you to be one of them all right

[00:19] So I was thinking about the differences that we have

[00:22] We have a publishing business. We have a photography business, which is a chain of brick and mortar

[00:27] Somebody asked me in one of the comments that to name them out. I don't tell you the actual name to these because part of the deal starts that we have with a lot of these are

[00:33] Our influencer based or personality driven brands and so I don't want it to be like oh

[00:37] You're just one of Alex's businesses all right, so just to be clear for everybody the reason

[00:41] I don't do that. I'll tell you the ones that I own 100% up, but the ones where I'm a minority partner in

[00:46] I don't

[00:47] I don't tell you what they I'll tell you what categories they're in

[00:50] So like I said we've got a publishing business

[00:52] Which is a digital digital business. We have brick and mortar chain photography studios

[00:58] We have we have a certification

[01:01] Business we also have a an online it's a it's similar business, but online for trainers

[01:07] We have our gym

[01:09] licensing business

[01:10] Which is gym launch. We have our supplement business which is prestige labs and then we have Allen which is our software

[01:16] Company for for agency owners that helps brick and mortar agencies

[01:20] Work late all right, so just so you're curious that's what we do and we're looking getting some others anyways

[01:24] And one of the things that I was thinking about within our businesses is like what are the different categories

[01:27] And this is kind of a spin-off of the recurring video that I made about cracking Netflix's code right is what are the different types of products that we can sell

[01:34] And I'll show you one of these that's incredibly valuable that if you're ever pressed for cash

[01:39] Is the easiest thing that you can sell for a ton of money first?

[01:43] There was like you've got products right you've got widgets you've got stuff all right

[01:47] That's the first category the second category. Let me see what I can draw some nice lines here the second category is you've got services

[01:53] Right where people do stuff right for other people and the third and this is the one that a lot of people miss out on

[01:59] Is access all right so I'm gonna go through all three of these in a second

[02:03] All right so products everyone should kind of understand with these out right you get these in the mail

[02:07] And they can also be digital goods so here's a here's an AAB version of each of these right so you've got physical

[02:14] And then you've got digital so you've got physical product would be getting you know supplements in the mail a digital product would be

[02:21] buying buying the buying Netflix like you know buying an Netflix subscription right that's where you're you're consuming a digital good

[02:28] When you buy media that is a digital good right your buying eyeballs right if you're buying physical services

[02:33] That would be like buying a massage you've got digital services which would be like like a marketing agency

[02:39] Right we would be digital service right they're not actually buying

[02:42] You're not buying something that's gonna happen in the real world you're having your buying something that's happening the digital

[02:46] In the digital sphere right third is access where you've got physical access which would be like

[02:50] Concert tickets right you have access like to someone or to an experience of some sort and then you've got digital access right we should be

[02:58] You buy access either to

[03:01] Like a virtual a virtual event or or you have access to me via Slack or something like that

[03:07] Right that would be digital access all right and so when you're thinking about your products and services right one of the easiest things to do to make it more valuable is think

[03:14] How can I add if you have let's say products?

[03:17] How can I add some sort of service components to it to make this more valuable and we do this so that we can not be a commodity

[03:23] Right the goal is to be so different from everyone else in the marketplace that people have to consider you on their own

[03:28] As your own stand-alone business so that you can have monopoly prices

[03:32] All right despite what the government will tell you an antitrust laws the goal is to become monopoly like you win the game

[03:37] I being one-oply by being so good that no one else can compete with you right and now because those companies have so much power

[03:42] They on the government now anyway not getting into that that's not the point for the point is is that

[03:48] You can pair these concepts so most people just consider them selves

[03:51] I am just a physical product business. It's like okay, well, can we add some sort of digital products right to our physical products

[03:57] Do enhance the value differentiator cells if I have a service. I have a physical service

[04:01] Maybe I can add some sort of digital component to it or maybe I can add some physical products

[04:06] They go with it or digital products right they go with it or

[04:10] Thirdly is there a way that I can add access which is probably one of my favorite

[04:15] of the types of

[04:17] of businesses and here's why this one has almost

[04:21] 100% margins right digital access is almost a hundred percent margins same thing with digital products almost have

[04:29] 100% margins right

[04:31] Digital services less so services just so you're you're wondering by so many service businesses of our time

[04:37] Scaling is this very hard to scale people it's also hard to scale things that have hard costs right

[04:42] And scaling people you have to scale torture you have to scale training if the scale onboarding

[04:46] There's a lot of things have to scale for scaling services which is why most people don't like buying those types of businesses

[04:50] Which is why and I'm making this video right now if you want to increase your enterprise value

[04:53] It's trying to figure out how you can add multiple of these things

[04:57] So I just give you six different categories here right of things of different types of things that you can have in your business

[05:03] I know that the sun is making me you know

[05:06] I'm dodging the sun here right I'm a sun chaser right now when you're thinking about how you can add more value

[05:10] Right, and I'll tell you the hack right now all right

[05:12] So you guys ready for this in terms of if you need to make money the way that you do this

[05:16] All right, and this is my favorite one that you can use which is access all right, I'm gonna put this in big

[05:22] Is that you sell a more individualized higher touch

[05:26] Version of your own solution all right, and so what that means is you can say hey

[05:30] I can only take five people for a one on one right or a small group right experience for one year

[05:40] For this big outcome that they're all gonna want and I'll guarantee

[05:46] That you'll get it

[05:48] I'll keep working with you for free until you do which means when you buy this thing and when you give me this money right now

[05:54] It means that you've solved this problem you can put this money down and means that that outcome is going to happen

[05:58] I'm gonna try to get to happen 12 months because I don't want to keep working for free

[06:01] But you know that I will continue to work with you until you achieve it all right

[06:04] So right now if you have a client-based and you're like man, I'm strapped for cash and the only way that they can do this is if they pre-pay the entire period of time

[06:11] All right, and so the thing is you don't need to have any kind of discount for an offer that structure like this

[06:16] The reason that they're getting a lot of value is because they're getting access, right?

[06:19] They're getting access in addition to a service all right and they're getting some level expertise on top of it

[06:26] All right, and so right now if you need to make an extra five grand 10 grand 20 grand 50 grand whatever it is

[06:31] That you have depending on the size of your business that is one of the easiest fastest ways to generate cash before your business and use

[06:37] Some of the audience while still maintaining good pent-up demand

[06:41] All right, what I mean by that is that if you sell

[06:43] 100 of these are you sell out in terms of like you sell out all the demand that's there

[06:47] You running something else in the future will bomb right and so the ideas if you know that you could sell 20 people

[06:53] So five if you know you could sell 100 people sell 20 right try and maintain the vast majority

[06:59] 80% of the demand still there and have it pent up

[07:02] So that when you do another offer like this in the future you'll sell it again and the idea is that as you grow

[07:07] The number of people that you will have in that demand pool continue to increase

[07:11] And so you will always be able to sell out but the number of total slots will continue to increase whereas most people

[07:17] Always go for the biggest asset possibly can try and sell out and and liquidate all the goodwill

[07:21] They have in their audience all the time which means they're always

[07:23] Searching for building up the next demand which is why they're always poor because it's very hard to do that all right

[07:28] It's much easier to maintain goodwill and multiply it and then feed and then just to get a tiny amount off the top and then grow the goodwill of the base

[07:36] To go from you know a hundred people in your base who want to buy the thing to 200 people in the base and the next time you go from 20 to 40

[07:41] Rather than going from 20 to 200 right because you could do it, but then after that you're done

[07:46] Nothing you got to start from scratching it and so it's much better

[07:49] To always keep some goodwill

[07:51] Kept up and one of my favorite ways to liquidate that

[07:55] In a very controlled burn manner is to have access so you can have implied urgency and applied scarcity

[08:00] With a very very high ticket premium and you'll probably get some of the best customers to do this with you

[08:05] They'll be the least needy believe it or not and they'll get some crazy great testimonials are great outcomes as a result of it

[08:11] So

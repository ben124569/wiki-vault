[00:00] I'm gonna break them in this video that you need to go make a million dollars that you need money to make money.

[00:04] One, two, three, four, five, six, ten different ways that you can make a million dollars for little or zero money down.

[00:12] And you can apply this to a thousand dollars, a hundred dollars, a hundred million dollars.

[00:16] You can do any of these things and add or detract the amount of zeroes that you feel comfortable with.

[00:20] The first thing that you can do if you want to make a million dollars, you can sell something for a million dollars.

[00:24] And that's crazy is what I'm saying sounds.

[00:27] You absolutely can sell something for a million dollars.

[00:29] If you go to an e-commerce store and they're doing a hundred million dollars a year.

[00:32] And you say, hey, if I can increase your conversion across your entire site, rewrite your emails,

[00:37] redo your landing pages and I can get you a 5% lift, can I get 1% of that.

[00:42] So you make them an extra 5 million a year and you get one. Do you think you can do that?

[00:46] Yes, why are you gonna be able to do so much? Not because of you, but because of who they are.

[00:50] You make a million dollars by selling someone else five to 10 million dollars a value.

[00:54] And you're like, I don't know how to do that. That's fine.

[00:56] But except that you don't know how to do that and then say, I want to learn how to do that and

[00:59] go get the skill of doing that and then you can go sell it.

[01:01] You can't say that you don't have the money and that's why you can't make money.

[01:04] The second one is that you can borrow a million dollars and then buy something and have someone

[01:09] else pay it back. It's fundamentally what real estate is.

[01:12] You borrow money to buy an asset. You put 10 it's into the asset.

[01:16] They pay off the money that you never had. That is what real estate is.

[01:20] And I'll tell you a quick story on this. So, buddy, mine got into real estate.

[01:23] It was flipping houses. Then there was a lot of money and it was like, oh, the sucks.

[01:26] There's so much work and there's all this 10, you know.

[01:28] So he ended up buying a 14 unit apartment building with someone else's money.

[01:31] He didn't have any.

[01:32] Both the apartment building and then sold it four months later for 500,000 dollars more.

[01:36] And he made 500 grand in one transaction. And so then he realized that the more expensive

[01:40] the building he sold the more money he made. Then he started getting into commercial

[01:42] real estate, which is even more expensive. He's like, wait a second. I can buy something for

[01:46] 10 million and then I can flip it to somebody for 13 and not even hold on to it for that long.

[01:51] He started flipping 30 or 40 of these a year with just him and a couple of VA's.

[01:55] Number three is you refinance something for more than you bought it.

[01:58] So if you're like, but I don't know if they'll do that. They will if it's price low enough.

[02:02] So if you have to go talk to a thousand building owners, you will probably get one of them

[02:06] who's willing to depart for their thing for significantly less than its worth. And a bank will

[02:10] loan the difference and you don't have to put any money down out of pocket.

[02:13] Let's say you have a hundred thousand dollar house and you get it under contract for $80,000

[02:18] from them saying that they're willing to give you the house for $80,000. And then you say,

[02:22] cool, I can give you a 70 and then you got a seller finance me the 10 over the next five years and

[02:27] they say, sure. And now all of a sudden you just got to get the bank and the bank finance is 80 percent.

[02:32] And now you actually just made the difference if you wanted to and you can take that number and you

[02:35] can do it at a hundred million dollars. You can do it at any of these levels. But that's the concept.

[02:40] Does that make sense? Number four is that you get a contract for something for less than its worth

[02:44] than you sell that contract. An option is a contract to say that you will be able to buy something

[02:48] at a future date at a price that is agreed upon today. That's an option is. If I agree upon a price

[02:53] of somebody today, then I as the first news getting the option is hoping that it is worth more than that.

[02:58] The first news selling the option is hoping that it's either worth less than that in the future

[03:02] or doesn't think it's going to change significantly. It will just get paid for that tiny option

[03:05] for the contract itself. Let's see you've got a million dollar house. Now you call a bunch of houses.

[03:09] You're going to be offering 20 percent below what the market rate is that you believe that's worth.

[03:14] Eventually you're going to get to somebody who's like, you know what? I've had this house for 30

[03:16] years. I bought it for $10 and now it's worth 800 grand. You know what? I'll take the 800 grand.

[03:21] You think it's worth more than the 800 grand. And you say thank you. I'm going to send you a

[03:24] doc you signed. They signed the doc you signed that you have an option period to flip the house. You

[03:28] could go to a real estate investor and say, hey, I have a house for $900,000 on sale. Right? It's worth a

[03:33] million. The guy says, okay, sure. I'll sign for $900. This guy's going to put $900 in. You're going to pay

[03:37] 800 to this person and then you make the 100 in between and you put no money down. The next

[03:41] one you can do is that you can sell something that's really expensive and get a commission. Sounds

[03:44] really simple. You sell a skyscraper that's a hundred million dollar skyscraper. You'll get three

[03:48] four percent of that deal. Three four million dollars on a single transaction. If you sell a

[03:52] 20 million dollar residence and you might have like, that's crazy. They exist look on Zilla. The

[03:55] realtor gets five-ish percent of the transaction. That's a million dollars in the never-own

[04:00] the asset. The next one is that you can find somebody who has an audience. Buy whatever they're

[04:04] about to launch early and then sell it later. Now that one does take some money. It's less, but the

[04:09] value of the thing later. That's how it balloons. This is how the entire NFT thing worked is that

[04:14] you have tremendous demand for a scarce resource. They have the scarce resource and then it balloons

[04:19] the price because there's so many people bidding against each other to get it. And so getting it

[04:22] early on those types of things, which is why if you buy into something pre-IPO, it tends to almost

[04:26] always go up simply by the fact that there's way more eyeballs that are competing for most times.

[04:30] The next one is selling units of stuff. Super simple, but people don't do the math behind this.

[04:34] I don't even like confining it to a year, but we do live in time, and so I will explain it that way.

[04:39] If you wanted to make a million dollars, you got $52 weeks in the year. About $20,000 a week is

[04:42] what you got to make. 20 times 52, it's technically a million, 40,000 for the internet trolls.

[04:47] How many different ways came make 20 grand in a week? Well, you can sell $20 people, $1,000

[04:51] thing, two people, a $10,000 thing, one person every four weeks and $80,000 a thing, on a weekly

[04:56] basis, 20 people who have a thousand dollar lifetime value. For example, if you have $100 a month

[05:01] membership and the person's days for 10 months on average, then if you sell 20 of those every week,

[05:06] over time those will stack up and then you will cap at a million dollars. And the only way to

[05:10] grow from that new million is either you got to sell more units or you got to make the thing

[05:13] that you're selling more. That's it. The next one is that you can get people to give you their

[05:17] businesses for no money down. Good friend of mine actually did this and he combined four different

[05:22] information businesses into one business and they were all small businesses. They were all doing

[05:25] about a million a year. I get small's relative, but it was like, and so he combined them all to be

[05:29] a $4 million top line, million and a half bottom line business for no money out of pocket. He literally

[05:34] said, hey, I know you don't want to do this business anymore. Just give it to me and I'll pay you,

[05:37] the income that you were going to make for this business for the next two years and they said,

[05:40] sure. And so he combined all those businesses together and then overnight, he owned a asset that was

[05:44] doing a million and a half a year in profit and four million in top line. And it cost him nothing

[05:48] to do it. He owns the asset now. And so if he turned around and went to say, hey, I'm going to go

[05:52] sell this, he could probably sell the thing for $5 million. Put together. It might cost him two million

[05:56] bucks and he makes the three. He made more than a million dollars with no money out of pocket.

[06:00] Understand that the people who are making money don't constrain themselves by time. They're not

[06:03] thinking how to make $1 per hour. $1 per year. They're thinking, how do I provide the most value

[06:08] to somebody so they'll give me a percentage of the value I provide? Here's another one. Is that you

[06:12] can go find something you really like and go promote that. So you don't have to go find and make

[06:16] your own products. You go find products that you really like from other companies and just

[06:19] become affiliates of those products. And the nice thing is that I just recommend you be honest.

[06:23] They're like, hey, I try to 100 fucking different soaps. This is my favorite one. And here's why.

[06:26] People don't want to go through the time and the money of figuring out which soap is the best

[06:31] for your audience. And if you make the wreck after you do that, they're like, oh, well, shoot,

[06:35] he just saved me time. And so then I'll go buy from him through his link or whatever.

[06:39] It's so you can affiliate other people's products and make money in that way without any money out of

[06:43] pocket. And then finally, arbitrage in general, which is a fancy word, but it just means that you

[06:48] sell the same thing between two different markets because they're priced differently. If Bitcoin

[06:52] is $19,000 in Japan on the Japanese market is $19,100 in the US market, you buy the $19,000

[06:58] Bitcoin over in Japan and you sell it in the American market for $19,000 and you make a hundred bucks.

[07:03] That's all arbitrage is and it happens with physical products. It happens with lending money

[07:08] but between two parties if you can get money for one percent and you can sell the money for 6 percent.

[07:13] You make five as the difference. All of these are different versions of arbitrage, which is just

[07:17] same thing, two markets, two different prices. You make the difference. And so if you're looking

[07:21] for ways to make money, look for arbitrage opportunities because that's where you can make tremendous income.

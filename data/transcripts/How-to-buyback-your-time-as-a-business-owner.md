[00:00] What's going on everyone?

[00:01] Alex Mosier here, three companies who have done over $110 million in sales.

[00:07] This video, I want to talk about the entrepreneurial journey as it relates to control.

[00:11] The reason I think this is so important, this is probably the biggest reason that people

[00:14] get stuck.

[00:15] At the end, what I'm going to do here is I'm going to explain how control shifts throughout

[00:18] the entrepreneurial journey, where people get stuck.

[00:21] At the very end of the video, I'll tell you basically the most valuable rule of thumb that

[00:25] I've learned in scaling our companies.

[00:28] The first thing is the reason entrepreneurship is so difficult, it forces you to change who

[00:33] you are, your identity, the values that you supposedly have as you continue to grow.

[00:37] I'm not saying you're honesty, et cetera, those types of values, but the way that you

[00:41] see the world and how you operate.

[00:44] In the very beginning, most of us at some point have to transition from a lack of control

[00:49] to complete control.

[00:51] What I mean by that is either you want straight in entrepreneurship, where you shifted control

[00:55] from your parents to yourself.

[00:57] Or in many other instances, you started you had a job, someone else was responsible for

[01:02] your income for the most part because they're paying you, you weren't generating yourself.

[01:06] So you're very limited, and then you jump to taking complete ownership over all of your

[01:11] outcomes.

[01:12] You have complete control.

[01:14] The difficult thing is that the thing that takes you the first step that huge leap of

[01:18] saying I'm going to be completely in control is usually the thing that will stay for most

[01:21] entrepreneurs who are trying to grow.

[01:24] You have complete control and complete ownership.

[01:27] That's great, but there's only one of you.

[01:29] So what that leads to is this buyback.

[01:33] I think the first time I heard this recently was where we were telling a buyback principle

[01:36] I just liked the terminology.

[01:38] Basically, you just continue to buyback your time as you continue to grow the company.

[01:43] In the very beginning, most people are buying back support time.

[01:48] It's just kind of lower skilled support tasks that they're doing in their business.

[01:51] It's like them, and then they've got maybe an assistant.

[01:54] After that, there might be higher level support or administrative tasks that might

[01:58] be like billing, collections, contracts, all that kind of stuff that might happen in the business.

[02:04] After you have your kind of support role taken care of, from there, the next level of control

[02:09] that people have to give up is selling, right?

[02:11] No one can sell like me.

[02:12] No one gets it like I get it.

[02:14] People just don't relate to my customers, right?

[02:16] And the issue is control.

[02:19] You're trying to control the whole thing.

[02:20] And the thing is that every time you add someone in, you buyback more of your time, you

[02:24] relinquish control.

[02:27] And so the thing is that every level of entrepreneurship, I'm telling you right now, it is

[02:31] always uncomfortable because the thing that you are now holding onto is the thing that you

[02:34] have to give up.

[02:36] And this has been one of the hardest things for me.

[02:38] A lot of this is because we identify with being the thing, right?

[02:42] In the beginning, I'll give you a simple example because we work so many gyms.

[02:47] People be like no one treats a class like I do, right?

[02:49] The first level of fulfillment, right?

[02:51] First level of delivery is training, right?

[02:54] It's also the first thing they need outsource.

[02:56] And the reason for that is because the market will pay someone $15.

[02:59] Now, somebody will come in for $15.

[03:00] Now, I don't know how to do that work.

[03:02] Well, if you have worked at pays you $100.

[03:03] Now, I don't know, then you should be doing the $100.

[03:05] Or not the $15.

[03:06] Now, I work.

[03:07] But they think because they like to feel special, they like to feel unique.

[03:12] No one can train like I can train.

[03:14] Well, obviously, there's probably some people train a lot better than you.

[03:17] So maybe you should let them do the train, right?

[03:19] And then after that, usually the business owner will do contracts billing, you know,

[03:23] and they're usually not that good at it anyways because they're entrepreneurs.

[03:26] So that's the next thing that happens, right?

[03:28] And so then the next piece might be some sort of assistant of some kind or some sort of

[03:32] right hand operator that would help you out, right?

[03:35] And then again, there, it's like, well, I don't trust anyone with the money.

[03:37] If I'm not looking at the money, then we're going to lose.

[03:41] Well, I used to say the same thing until I had somebody who's better at tracking the money

[03:45] than I am.

[03:46] Crazy, right?

[03:47] And so I had to give up control of the money.

[03:48] And that's why they don't look at it, right?

[03:50] But I had to give up control of it.

[03:52] And so then I'm just selling, right?

[03:54] Because that's the highest value thing I could do at the time.

[03:56] Because I could just talk to people and get them to give us money.

[03:59] Right?

[04:00] But then eventually, there's too many, too many consultations that have to happen.

[04:02] I still have to run the business, right?

[04:04] And so I have to give that control over to someone else, which is probably one of the biggest

[04:07] and most difficult people.

[04:08] This is usually either thing that gets in the way people are going, I'd say, from a million

[04:12] over, sort of doing over a million.

[04:13] So up to a million dollars a year, you can just sell yourself.

[04:16] Right?

[04:17] Like you yourself can sell and you can have these other people who are assisting you.

[04:19] But once you cross a million, it's usually difficult to be doing the selling yourself.

[04:23] And that's really have to start scaling sales.

[04:25] So you have to give that control up, right?

[04:27] The next level after control of the sales is now you have to teach other people in a group,

[04:33] not just one person, but a group of people had a sales.

[04:35] So you have to manage the sales team, you have to recruit, you have to hire, you have to train,

[04:38] compensate, etc.

[04:39] And again, this levels of control.

[04:41] But again, here, here, even with the sales team, you're talking maybe three, maybe 10 million.

[04:46] When you get to 10 million, trying to go to 30, the level of control that you're giving

[04:49] up here is leadership.

[04:52] Weird, right?

[04:54] Because there's too many departments, too many people.

[04:56] You can't lead everyone.

[04:57] Right?

[04:58] So you have to lead a smogger but people and get them to lead the people who are underneath

[05:02] of them.

[05:03] Right?

[05:04] And so again, that's a level of control.

[05:05] It's control over your culture.

[05:06] And obviously you want to lead it.

[05:07] You want to lead by example.

[05:08] You want to be the most distilled down version of that thing so that it permeates.

[05:14] But as you continue to buy back, I think the question that I like to ask myself is, what

[05:18] am I trying to control?

[05:20] What am I trying to control?

[05:22] And I think if you think about that and then rather what part of my identity might

[05:26] give you up by giving up this control?

[05:29] I used to think I was such a great salesman, right?

[05:33] No one can sell like I can sell.

[05:36] But you know what?

[05:37] I can't sell 12 guys, right?

[05:42] I literally can't do it.

[05:45] And so if the business model requires only a super, like your level of sales to make it

[05:51] work, then the model's broken.

[05:53] You should be able to have people close half as many as you and still make the model

[05:56] work.

[05:57] Now obviously over time you want to get them to sell better than you because all they're

[05:59] doing is selling.

[06:00] Whereas you were when you were selling the way you did, you were running the business.

[06:05] And so with each of this cycle is you have to give up control.

[06:09] And so I told you the beginning of the video that I will give you the rule of thumb that

[06:13] has been served me very well in running my companies, which is how far away do you get?

[06:19] How far away do you get when you've relinquished control?

[06:22] Because the thing is, is you relinquished control, but you still take full accountability

[06:25] and responsibility for the results.

[06:27] That's what's wild.

[06:28] Is that you have to say, I'm going to give this over to you.

[06:32] I'm losing control and yet I'm still responsible.

[06:36] That'll trip you up.

[06:38] But the rule of thumb that I use is no where the bodies are buried.

[06:41] No where the bodies are buried.

[06:43] And so what I mean by that is if I don't know where the flaws are in a department, I'm too

[06:51] far away.

[06:52] So if I talk to let's say I'm marketing director or I talk to a sales director, I talk to

[06:57] a customer support, I talk to finance and I don't know where the bodies are buried.

[07:02] Like I don't know what the issues are because every department has issues, every department

[07:06] has problems.

[07:07] It's made of humans and humans are imperfect, right?

[07:10] Which means that there are always imperfections, there are things that aren't working

[07:13] as well as they could.

[07:14] If I can't name problems, if I don't know where the bodies are buried in the department,

[07:20] then I'm too far away.

[07:23] Right?

[07:24] Now when I say that, it's a me that I have given up too much control.

[07:26] That's not the issue.

[07:27] It's just I need more transparency.

[07:28] I need to be paying more attention to that area.

[07:31] And this rule of thumb has served me well.

[07:34] So if I start hearing only good news from an department and I don't hear anything negative,

[07:39] I'm too far away.

[07:40] And this has been my manager, a leadership rule of thumb that has really helped me a ton

[07:44] is no where the bodies are buried.

[07:47] And so this is the entrepreneurial journey in a nutshell.

[07:49] I got a lot of feedback from the zero to a hundred million dollar video that I made

[07:52] of kind of the steps from a business model perspective.

[07:55] But from the personal perspective, the issue is control.

[07:58] And that's why most people can't get stuck because they have all these personal issues

[08:00] that prevent them from controlling.

[08:02] I'm sorry Alex, they just don't trust people.

[08:04] I'm not trusting issues.

[08:04] Well, get over it because you're not going to build something great without trusting

[08:08] other people.

[08:09] So if you want your mom, your dad, or the thing that you have your trust issues with,

[08:13] to be the reason that you're not successful, they give them more power.

[08:16] Go, power too, right?

[08:18] Just keep giving them control over your life because you have these issues.

[08:22] Or you can decide, I think this person's done enough damage to me in my life.

[08:27] I'm not going to let them stop me from accomplishing what I want to accomplish.

[08:32] So I'm going to take back that power.

[08:33] I'm going to take back the control over my outcomes.

[08:35] Take responsibility, which may feel shitty in the moment because it means I suck.

[08:40] But at least I suck and I don't point at them saying they suck because I can control what

[08:44] I do.

[08:45] And as a result, I can go through this processing continue to buy back and really

[08:49] could control buy back and really could control buy back and really could control.

[08:53] First of the doing, then of the admin, then of the the ops, then of the sales.

[08:57] And then of having a sales team.

[08:58] And then of the leadership and then continuing on and on as we relinquish more and more

[09:02] control.

[09:03] Right?

[09:04] How can you be free if you control everything?

[09:06] Interesting.

[09:07] Anyways, lots of love keeping awesome.

[09:09] I'll catch you guys on the flip side.

[09:10] Have a good day.

[09:11] Have a good day.

[09:12] Bye.

[00:00] The vast majority of businesses are stuck because they're working on the wrong stuff.

[00:03] The entrepreneur likes doing certain things, they keep doing a certain thing, but we've got you

[00:06] from zero to a million or one to 10 million.

[00:09] Isn't what's going to get you from 10 to 30?

[00:11] There's a much harder problem that's in front of you that you have to confront rather than

[00:14] side-seping and getting distracted and looking at things that look like they're going to be

[00:18] better opportunities with the skills you have.

[00:19] The biggest opportunity is the one that's in front of you.

[00:21] And I want to share exactly how I think through what hard stuff do I push through and what

[00:26] hard stuff do I pivot through and being able to accurately identify with the real problem

[00:31] in your businesses and it's usually not the one you think it is.

[00:34] In the very beginning, what I got in the gym business, I thought the gym business was about

[00:37] results.

[00:38] I thought it was about results and I thought it was about like killer, killer workouts and it was

[00:44] really about neither of those things.

[00:47] The gym business is actually about sales and marketing.

[00:50] So I got into it because I was like, I'm passionate about fitness and I'm passionate about

[00:53] getting people results.

[00:54] What would actually drove the business economics with sales and marketing and the big

[00:58] problem is that with gyms as you might imagine, a lot of people don't actually like going

[01:02] to the gym.

[01:03] It has inherent difficulties.

[01:05] The good news in the gym business is that everybody wants to get a better shape and see

[01:08] if this massive market, but people tend to turn out of gyms even the very low cost gyms.

[01:13] Like a lot of people have this misbelief that they think like, oh, we'll plan to finish

[01:16] or crunch fitness to 10 bucks a month.

[01:17] So of course, no one cancels, but they actually have five or six for a monthly turn.

[01:21] They just have a ton of people who sign up every month as well.

[01:24] And so the key that I didn't know is that the businesses that are the biggest in the fitness

[01:29] space and this is what I got into it was actually just marketing and sales machines.

[01:33] They know how to train sales and how to recruit for sales and how to market on a number

[01:36] of different channels to get customers in the door.

[01:38] And so once I learned that, I started growing my gyms and I was started realizing that was

[01:42] the business I was really in.

[01:43] Then later on, I got into prestige labs, which is my sub-in business.

[01:48] And I thought that I was in the product business.

[01:49] So I thought it was going to be about all the ingredients that I was using.

[01:52] I thought it was going to be about like how efficacious and all the studies that we could

[01:55] prove.

[01:56] And so I got Dr. Cashy, who's a genius biochemist, got his PhD when he was 20 years old

[02:01] in biochemistry, which is absolutely absurd.

[02:03] And I got him and he was, you know, he did all the stacks for the Olympic teams and things

[02:07] like that.

[02:08] And I was like, okay, I'm going to have the best smartest person in the world.

[02:10] Make the absolute most efficacious product with the best ingredients.

[02:13] But that wasn't actually the business I was in.

[02:16] In the sub-in business, it's about brand, media, and distribution.

[02:20] That's actually the business you're in.

[02:22] And especially if you have products that don't have a flavoring.

[02:26] So if you have capsules of any sort, then it really is just about brand and distribution.

[02:32] Now, if you have a product that is like an AG1, right?

[02:37] Now people buy AG1 because obviously they're exceptional at media.

[02:40] They're great at traffic.

[02:41] They're really just traffic machines.

[02:43] But people keep buying it because it tastes good.

[02:46] And so they think it's like, oh, I mean, it's because of all these little ingredients

[02:49] in there.

[02:50] But like you don't feel healthy.

[02:52] You don't know if your levels of whatever are changing.

[02:54] You just know if it tastes good and if you create a habit around it.

[02:57] And so again, in that business, it took me too long to realize that I was actually not in

[03:02] the product, but this again, I was in the media distribution business.

[03:05] Then when I got into Allen, which was my software company, I thought that I was like,

[03:09] okay, I've learned my lesson.

[03:11] This is all about marketing and sales.

[03:12] Like this is software.

[03:13] I get it.

[03:14] I've learned my lesson.

[03:15] And this is like, how did this software business?

[03:17] I knew I could sell everybody the software.

[03:19] The problem was I had to actually make a better product because with tech, especially

[03:24] it fundamentally automates some element of work.

[03:27] That's what software does.

[03:28] Is it automate something?

[03:29] And so if something can be done precisely and done accurately and done quickly and

[03:33] with software ideally, it's done cheaply or cheaper than people.

[03:36] Because that's how tech works in general.

[03:38] Then that's an easy thing to sell.

[03:40] Who doesn't want good fast cheaper?

[03:42] Better.

[03:43] Everybody does.

[03:44] And so it's very easy, at least in my experience, it was very easy to sell software

[03:47] if you have a good product, market fit in terms of what you're trying to sell.

[03:50] The problem was that my product wasn't good enough to deliver on the promise.

[03:53] And so I got into it and it was like, okay, cool.

[03:55] I'll just hire an outsourced development team and they'll just build me whatever

[03:59] hours, they'll get the product done and then I'll market and sell it.

[04:02] And sure, we sold a ton.

[04:03] I mean, we went to 1.7 million a month in six months in terms of run rate.

[04:10] And that was per month, 1.7 million.

[04:11] And so the thing is, we were able to sell the crap out of it.

[04:14] I then quickly realized that the product just couldn't deliver and then I was like, oh,

[04:18] shoot.

[04:19] I have this outsourced team that owns the product and that's not their core business

[04:24] because they're really just a shop that sells to anybody.

[04:26] And their incentive is to just build me as much as easily possible by the way.

[04:30] If you run revenue through any kind of software, as soon as the development shop,

[04:33] see how much money you're making, guess what happens to your fees?

[04:36] They go up.

[04:37] And unless you have someone who can check them and knows how to code or knows how to at least

[04:42] QA them, you're screwed.

[04:44] You're hammered.

[04:45] And so I had no technical proficiency myself.

[04:47] I had nobody on my internal team that was like a WG employer,

[04:50] at least an equity employee, anybody who actually knew code.

[04:54] And so I was absolutely at their mercy and it sucked.

[04:57] And so in that business and software business, you think you might be getting

[05:00] in the marketing sales business, but you're really becoming into the product business.

[05:02] Because if you fundamentally can make that promise, which is good or faster, cheaper

[05:07] or than people are going to buy.

[05:09] But you have to make sure that you can fulfill that promise.

[05:11] And so I learned that lesson too late.

[05:13] We ended up selling it to a strategic buyer who could incorporate it into their big

[05:18] development team.

[05:19] He was like, I can rewrite the code.

[05:20] You already have a big customer base.

[05:21] And we did it all stock deal.

[05:24] Now I'll tell you a story that made me think about this was the first thing that

[05:28] actually got me into this thinking process of what business are you really in.

[05:31] And so one of our gym owners from way back when we had gym launch was a successful

[05:36] gym owner.

[05:37] And he started making money with his gyms.

[05:39] And so he started buying Airbnb.

[05:40] And so I was kind of like his investments rise.

[05:42] You start buying Airbnb in his local area.

[05:45] And what ended up happening was he was like, you know what, I can drive margins up by

[05:48] just cleaning the houses myself instead of outsourcing the cleaning.

[05:51] And so because you have an Airbnb, especially daily rentals like the cleaning is actually

[05:54] a pretty big part of the business.

[05:57] And so he started hiring his own cleaning staff and doing the cleaning.

[06:00] But he was like, wow, you know what, this cleaning business, I could start cleaning for

[06:05] other Airbnb's, right?

[06:06] And so he starts cleaning for other Airbnb's and he's like, okay, this is actually a business.

[06:10] And so he used all the stuff he knew from running his gym, which he knew how to market

[06:13] in sell because that's the real business you're in when you're in the gym business.

[06:16] And so he starts marketing something.

[06:17] And I had dinner with him probably a year into the business and he was like, and I said,

[06:22] okay, give me LTV.

[06:23] Give me cat.

[06:24] Like how's it work?

[06:25] He's like, oh, LTV's insane.

[06:27] People never cancel.

[06:28] And cat is like $6.

[06:30] And I was like, oh my god, like why are you not making gazillions of dollars?

[06:35] He's like, you know, these shoes actually tell it.

[06:38] It's actually getting people who clean houses who show up on time and do a good job,

[06:42] but don't steal and speak English and communicate with customers.

[06:45] He's like, that's actually the issue.

[06:48] And it was right in that moment.

[06:49] I was like, oh, this business isn't like the other business you was in.

[06:52] This wasn't, this isn't a gym, this even though it's a local business, even though it's

[06:55] service.

[06:56] If you're in the cleaning business, you're not in the marketing and sales business because

[06:59] selling someone on lemme clean your house and do this stuff for you, not that hard, right?

[07:04] And getting people to opt in for cleaning ads, not that difficult, selling them, not that

[07:08] hard.

[07:09] The hard part is actually delivering on it and getting people who want to do it on Ray

[07:12] Liberace.

[07:13] So I'll give you an example on the counter side for gyms, getting talent, getting trainers,

[07:19] getting people who are fitness enthusiasts who want to train other people, people do it

[07:23] for free.

[07:24] Like people like working out, people, well, I'll say people who like working out, like

[07:29] working out, just put that way.

[07:30] Like there are obviously people who hate working out, but there are people who are

[07:32] fitness enthusiasts.

[07:33] Now I have not seen a cleaning enthusiast.

[07:35] There's not this under, you know, this underworld of all these people are like, man,

[07:39] I'm just a cleaning enthusiast.

[07:41] I mean, there are maybe some people, but the vast majority people see it as a chore, right?

[07:44] And so getting talent for gyms is not hard, getting talent for cleaning, much harder.

[07:49] And so once we, we started walking through this, I was like, oh, you're in the recruiting

[07:54] and training business.

[07:55] And I just saw his whole ice change.

[07:57] I was like, okay, think about it like this.

[07:59] You know how to acquire customers.

[08:01] You have to market, you generate leads, you work the leads, you have a sales call, and

[08:05] you onboard them, and then you retain them and you send them.

[08:08] I was like, we need to flip that.

[08:09] And so you need to think about, what is my acquisition for talent?

[08:12] How do I generate leads and applications for talent?

[08:15] Instead of sales, how do I interview?

[08:17] Instead of onboarding customers, how do I onboard a new employee?

[08:21] And how do I train them so that they can be proficient?

[08:23] So that can then manage or send them up inside of the organization?

[08:27] And so as soon as you flip that, he took the business from, I think it was like 30 or 40,000

[08:31] dollars a month, to over 150,000 dollars a month.

[08:34] And then next, 12 months.

[08:36] And it was just that idea of, oh, this is the big Harry problem I have to solve.

[08:41] And so every business has a big Harry problem.

[08:44] And this has just been my own experiences that, because I'm probably just a nitty

[08:48] internet idiot, I only learned about it once I get into it.

[08:52] And so as a recommendation, if you are going to enter into a new marketplace, talk to

[08:55] people and ask them what the hardest part of their business is.

[08:58] And so I'll give you two more examples of this.

[09:00] And then I'll I'll transition to kind of why I think this is important overall.

[09:04] So a lot of people who follow me just because they're in the consulting or the coaching

[09:07] of the information, the education system, because I talk about that stuff a lot.

[09:10] Now, the thing is, if you're in that space, what business do you think you're in?

[09:15] Now, you have to learn how to market in cell.

[09:17] That's any business, right?

[09:19] But if you want to make it big, look at the biggest consulting firms, professional

[09:24] service businesses in the world.

[09:26] What are they?

[09:27] You look at McKinsey, you look at Bayen, you look at Erntz and Yel, you look at KPMG, you look

[09:31] at the biggest firms accounting, look at law, look at consulting, what are they?

[09:36] They're recruiting machines.

[09:38] And it's because they know how to attract talent, train talent, and make people more

[09:43] valuable, and they get the best and brightest people.

[09:46] And so the reason that people can't, quote, scale in these information coaching, et cetera,

[09:50] businesses is because they have one talented person, which is the guru.

[09:54] And then they hire a bunch of minions or people who are not even close to as good as that

[09:58] person.

[09:59] And then over time, what happens is, delutes the level of service.

[10:01] And it's a service-based business.

[10:03] And so people are like, man, this thing sucks, or this guy sucks, or this business sucks.

[10:07] But McKinsey, Bayen, BCG, EY, those are built on the principle of how do we continue to

[10:14] raise the bar, how do we get better, brighter, smarter people, and how do we train them

[10:17] better than anyone else?

[10:18] And a faster way soon get better returns on human capital, as in the people themselves.

[10:21] How do we get better returns on the humans?

[10:24] And so that's the fundamental arbitrage if you're in a service-based business where you

[10:27] spell cell expertise is the return on the arbitrage between what you pay somebody and what

[10:32] you can charge for that person's expertise.

[10:33] Now, the difficulty in that business is that when you train someone and they become

[10:36] really exceptionally, they become really smart.

[10:38] What do they have?

[10:39] They have opportunities to leave.

[10:40] They can take those clients with them.

[10:41] And so there's a reason that most of these professional service firms at scale become partnerships.

[10:46] They become LLP's.

[10:47] So you have, I become a partner at McKinsey.

[10:50] I become a partner at the law firm.

[10:51] I become a partner at the accounting firm.

[10:53] Because if you have a ton of very, very smart motivated people, they eventually will leave

[10:58] to start their own business or you have to show them a path that they could be able

[11:00] to own or within the business they're in.

[11:02] And this is just playing it out.

[11:04] And so this is why I bring this up because a lot of people don't know what it looks like

[11:06] at scale.

[11:07] Like you have to bring in very intelligent people and have a system or incentive process

[11:11] that gives them a taste in the long run so that the opportunity or the risk adjusted

[11:16] return of them leaving versus them staying, it still makes more sense for them to stay.

[11:20] Or at least for a good portion of them to stay.

[11:22] Now, I'll give you a more example and then I'll flip it to why I think this is important

[11:25] in terms of identifying this for your own business.

[11:27] So investing, I thought it was about doing lots of deals in good prices and to some

[11:32] degree it is.

[11:33] But in reality, in at least in my experiences, it's been way more about learning how to

[11:36] say no at a much higher velocity to a much higher number of deals because you only need

[11:42] one Facebook.

[11:43] And so it's kind of this counter-intuitive thing where you have power law that starts

[11:46] really, really leveling out.

[11:49] Like we did 22 deals over the last two and a half years and four of those deals are

[11:55] the ones that are 90% of the returns that we have.

[11:58] And there's so many deals that we did where I'm like, man, that's literally just a complete

[12:02] waste of my time.

[12:03] Like waste of money, waste of time because I can get so much more taking the large company

[12:07] of them perver is about $100 million a year.

[12:09] If I can get that up to going from $100 to $150 million is actually the same level of work

[12:15] sometimes easier than going from $0.01 million or $1 to $10 million.

[12:20] Like it's $50 million in absolute and you also get a premium on the EBITDA, meaning the

[12:26] take home up to then quotes for the business is that it's the reverse of buying where

[12:32] you get economies of scale where you lower the price when you get bigger with businesses

[12:37] you get a scale premium.

[12:39] You get paid more for the profit that you get when the profit is an absolutely bigger.

[12:44] So you get more more.

[12:46] It's easier to grow them bigger and you get more for the growth you get.

[12:49] And so this is where like getting more for the effort that you put in becomes really important.

[12:52] And I didn't know that when I got into the business.

[12:54] And so for each of these businesses I had these big learning curves where it's like,

[12:57] okay, this is what I think the business is about and then you get into it and you're like,

[13:00] oh, this is what the business is really about.

[13:03] This is the big, Harry problem that I really have to solve.

[13:05] And so the thing is is that at least I had the day yesterday where I talked to these

[13:09] business owners and it became clear for a handful of them that they were plateaued because

[13:12] they actually didn't know what business they were in.

[13:14] They were kind of like that Jim owner who got into the cleaning.

[13:16] He was like, man, this is this is tough because you kept looking at marketing and sales.

[13:20] We were like, what am I?

[13:20] What do I need to do differently here?

[13:22] When the reality was the country, the business was actually a different big Harry problem.

[13:25] And the good news for us is entrepreneurs is that we get paid to solve that problem.

[13:30] We get paid very well to solve that problem.

[13:32] And so what's interesting is that a lot of entrepreneurs will restart the cycle over and over and over again

[13:38] because they say, so using that cleaning Jim owner,

[13:41] example, he might say, okay, now if we hadn't had that conversation, he might start yet another business

[13:46] where he can market in sell because he'd learned how to solve those problems.

[13:49] So he knows how to beat the level one in the level two boss.

[13:51] But as soon as he comes to the level three boss, which is a completely different skill

[13:54] so that he needed to have, he just stops and starts another opportunity.

[13:57] And so this is what is so deceptive about the woman in the red dress.

[14:01] Is that when I say if you're new to my stuff, the woman in the red dress is the

[14:05] is the distractions, the shiny object.

[14:06] It's the, it's the, it's the opportunity that looks more appealing with the current skill

[14:10] set you have. You said it's that she, she whispered to you and she says, listen, you're marketing and selling over there.

[14:15] If you just had the same skill set with me, it'd be better.

[14:18] It'd be so much better.

[14:19] But it's, it's, it's false because what she doesn't tell you is that she's absolutely

[14:23] fucking crazy in all these other ways that you didn't know about.

[14:25] And then he get in better with you.

[14:26] You're like, oh my gosh, she's six personalities.

[14:28] I, this is crazy.

[14:29] Right.

[14:30] And so the thing is is that that is what most opportunities look like.

[14:33] You have un informed optimism because you think this is the business that you're getting into and

[14:36] then you get into bed with that business and you realize this is the real business.

[14:39] She actually has a baby daddy and she's got a kid she didn't tell you about and you're like,

[14:43] oh, I did not sign up for this.

[14:44] But now you got a whole host of problems.

[14:46] You got a softening, got a side, whether the, the, the problems you want to solve.

[14:49] And so, um, this is why so many entrepreneurs start and keep starting businesses and

[14:55] starting over and they get to the same size and then they just move over to another one of the

[15:00] red dress who promises a different outcome of the same skills they have and they get to the

[15:02] same level.

[15:03] They get the same level of revenue because they don't know how to break past it because they don't

[15:07] know the actual business they're in.

[15:10] Hey, and if you're wondering, where do I get these stories or like, how could I be one of the

[15:13] businesses that's in the room getting kind of this like more personalized attention?

[15:16] We just started into division at acquisition.com, uh, four workshops, four business owners

[15:21] that are over a certain amount.

[15:22] And so if you want to see if you qualify, you go to acquisition.com, click through the

[15:25] steps and, uh, maybe we'll see you in Vegas.

[15:28] And so they keep beating the same bosses because they're comfortable there.

[15:32] And so what happens is in the beginning, you don't make any money.

[15:34] You learn how to beat one boss.

[15:35] You start making money.

[15:36] Like, oh, let me see if I can beat that boss over and over again at this at in different

[15:40] businesses.

[15:41] And that's how I'm in a growth, but it's not that you have to beat a new boss every

[15:43] time.

[15:44] And the hard work is figuring out the hair, the the hairy problem in front of you.

[15:49] And it's usually the thing that we don't want to confront because sometimes it makes

[15:51] us feel bad about ourselves.

[15:52] Sometimes we're like, well, maybe my product just isn't that good.

[15:54] Oh, wow, I have to learn coding.

[15:56] Oh, I have to bring technical talent and I've never done that before.

[15:59] Well, guess what, that's how that's what you got to do if you want to make this thing

[16:02] go big.

[16:03] And so, was interesting about this and this is my like kind of like word of encouragement

[16:06] for whatever business you're in is that the route is that almost any business can be

[16:10] taken to a billion dollars with a long enough time horizon.

[16:13] This is truth.

[16:14] Almost any business can get to a billion dollars in terms of value with a long enough

[16:18] time horizon.

[16:19] So you're in the roofing space.

[16:20] You can get to a billion dollar roofing company.

[16:22] You have a restaurant.

[16:23] There's a version of a restaurant business that is a billion dollars.

[16:25] It's not a single location, but it could either be a franchise of a business or you could

[16:29] you could have a privately held.

[16:31] I mean, there's there's a bunch of, you know, big high-end change you look at master as

[16:34] you look at some of these companies.

[16:35] They're several hundred million dollar companies.

[16:37] And so you look at dry cleaning.

[16:39] Like you look at zips, like it's a massive, you know, at least domestic in the US chain

[16:45] of dry cleaning things.

[16:46] So like there are versions of every business that make hundreds of millions worth

[16:51] billions of dollars.

[16:52] It's just that it takes a very long time to get there.

[16:55] And you have to beat new bosses at every level.

[16:57] And what happens is most people get distracted because they don't know the business

[17:00] they're in.

[17:01] They encounter problem.

[17:02] Think it's the opportunity vehicle.

[17:04] They think they need to switch women.

[17:05] They think they need to go after them when they're redress.

[17:08] But the route is that like you just have to have that hard conversation with your wife or

[17:11] your girlfriend or whatever you're with right now to see if we can get to the next level.

[17:18] And so if you solve the right problems.

[17:21] And this is how I think about this.

[17:23] I imagine that I've got this big concrete wall in front.

[17:25] This is my imagery for myself that gets me through this because it sucks.

[17:29] It sucks, right?

[17:30] These moments where you're like, okay, I just realized that I'm now in the recruiting and

[17:34] training business for cleaning.

[17:36] And I'm not equipped for this.

[17:37] This is not what I, this is not what I sign up for.

[17:39] I didn't know she had a kid.

[17:40] I didn't know that she is a baby daddy that's in jail and it comes to these coming out

[17:43] in six weeks.

[17:44] I didn't know these things were there.

[17:46] Now using that example, you might just dip.

[17:48] But let's imagine a world where you had to stick with it.

[17:52] And so I imagine that I've got this big, hairy product.

[17:54] This big wall of concrete in front of me.

[17:56] But what I do is, and I had this conversation with one of my portfolios.

[17:59] He is, I was like, hey, we have to build this new product line out.

[18:02] And he's like, I don't know how to do that.

[18:04] And I was like, well, here's the good news.

[18:06] Once we do it, I was like, it don't increase the enterprise value of this business by

[18:09] $200 million.

[18:10] And I was like, is that worth it?

[18:13] And he was like, well, when you say it like that, he's like, I mean, I definitely

[18:16] feel a lot more encouraged to solve the problem.

[18:18] I was like, right, now I don't think it's $200 million hard.

[18:21] I was like, this might be 10 million hard.

[18:23] But that's a great trade.

[18:24] This is 10 million hard to get $200 million in enterprise value.

[18:26] That's a fucking steal.

[18:28] And so I try to think about it like that.

[18:29] I was like, okay, I've got this big concrete wall in front of me.

[18:31] And the thing is, is that when you've got a sledgehammer, and you just don't know how thick

[18:35] the wall is.

[18:36] And so it's like, how many times I need to have to be hammered?

[18:38] I know that there's $200 million on the other side.

[18:40] I just don't know how far I got to go.

[18:42] And I think that's one of the difficulties in entrepreneurship is the uncertainty that's attached

[18:47] to the level and duration and intensity of the amount of work they have to persist and continue

[18:52] to do without seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, without having a crack in the wall

[18:56] that you see a little nugget, a little shimmer of gold, a little diamond that starts

[18:59] to peek through the corner.

[19:00] Like you have to keep swinging at the wall.

[19:02] And so I think about this as making sure that I'm simply making progress.

[19:08] And so there are, I didn't think I was going to get into this, but I'm going to go into it.

[19:11] So there's two very different types of hard in business.

[19:15] And there's the good kind of hard and there's the bad kind of hard.

[19:18] So the good kind of hard is I see it is that you have, you have,

[19:22] underlying assumptions that you believe to be true from a first principles level.

[19:26] So I'll give you an example.

[19:27] So let's say I want to get, I want to start running TikTok ads for one of our companies.

[19:31] We don't have TikTok ads going in that particular business.

[19:34] And we think that fundamentally, so this is the principle perspective, are there, let's say

[19:39] a countenance on TikTok?

[19:41] Yes, I think they're a countenance on TikTok.

[19:43] Okay, is there a way that we can run ads profitably and get our messaging in front of those

[19:47] people on TikTok?

[19:49] And if the answer is yes, then I fundamentally believe that there's a profitable way

[19:52] that we can turn those eyeballs into customers.

[19:54] Period.

[19:55] Now, if we start running ads on TikTok and then we don't immediately make ROI, that's

[19:59] the good kind of hard.

[20:01] That's the, okay, well, let's start at the beginning.

[20:03] How did we get, did we get enough clicks?

[20:05] Okay, yes, we got clicks.

[20:06] All right, did we get optins?

[20:08] Yes, we got optins.

[20:09] Okay, of the optins that we got, are they the right type of people?

[20:12] Yes, they're the right type of people.

[20:13] Or no, they're not the right type of people.

[20:14] Okay, well, then maybe we need to change the messaging.

[20:16] Maybe we need to change the targeting.

[20:17] Maybe we need to change the lead man.

[20:18] But these are the iterative types of hard.

[20:20] This, in my opinion, is a good type of hard.

[20:22] I don't see me losing money on the ads as cool losing money.

[20:26] I see that as me investing in something that's going to increase the enterprise value

[20:29] of my company because I'm going to get another acquisition channel.

[20:31] I'm going to diversify how I get customers.

[20:33] To me, that's a great return.

[20:35] It's actually one of those underutilized ways of thinking about this.

[20:37] It's like, okay, if I have a company that has one way of getting customers and I can get

[20:40] a second way of getting customers and I diversify risk in terms of my client acquisition,

[20:45] that meaningfully increases the enterprise value.

[20:48] Even if I had no additional, even if I had no more profit from doing this.

[20:51] Now, obviously, if you have another acquisition channel and you get 50% of your business

[20:54] in that channel, then it means you double the business as long as you don't lose the

[20:57] first access in channel.

[20:58] And so by doing that, I get two multipliers on enterprise value.

[21:01] One is I absolutely make twice as much money, which is great.

[21:04] But I also decrease the risk associated with the purchase for an acquireer, which means

[21:08] that I will also make more money on the exit.

[21:10] And so, wow, okay, well, if I do this, again, what's the price tag that I get to

[21:15] describe to this problem?

[21:17] Well, if I can double, let's say the ebter of the business is 2 million bucks and it's

[21:20] trading at 5x.

[21:21] Okay, fine.

[21:22] So it's a $10 million business.

[21:23] If I can add to and I diversify acquisition streams, then that might add minimum

[21:29] 10 million in enterprise value, but realistically, maybe 15 million dollars to enterprise

[21:33] value by having this one acquisition system.

[21:35] And so if I lose 100 grand, trying to figure out how to run ads profitably on TikTok

[21:41] and it takes me six months, if I reframe the question as, hey, will you invest

[21:45] a $100,000 in weeks, six months for a $10 million return?

[21:48] What I do it?

[21:49] Fuck yeah, I would do it.

[21:51] But people don't think that way.

[21:52] They get, they get buttered because, oh my, I didn't work.

[21:54] I don't think TikTok works for us.

[21:56] I don't think TikTok, I don't think marketing works.

[21:58] I don't think paid ads work for us.

[21:59] Come on, get out of here.

[22:01] So fundamentally it's saying, I don't think that if I get on the phone with accountants and

[22:06] we sell accounting stuff that will make money.

[22:09] It's preposterous, it's ridiculous.

[22:11] But people are pussies and that's why they don't make money.

[22:13] Okay.

[22:15] Big, big, big picture here, right?

[22:17] Is that we get solved and sorry, we get paid to solve big problems and the bigger the

[22:22] problem, the bigger the pay off.

[22:26] And so I like to describe one, how much enterprise value am I going to get on the

[22:30] other side of this concrete wall?

[22:32] And that helps pull me through the fact that I'm going to have to swing this hammer and

[22:36] I don't know many times of an after swing it.

[22:38] And as long as I'm solving the right kind of problem, which is a type of problem that

[22:41] I can reason to first principles of the idea of yes, people who buy my stuff are on this

[22:47] platform and there is a way to reach them and I can do so profitably, then we will make

[22:52] money.

[22:53] Now, you're like, well, what's the, what's the bad type of problem?

[22:56] What's the bad type of heart?

[22:57] So this is a classic problem of do I push or do I pivot?

[23:00] And this is a classic, you know, entrepreneur dilemma that we have, right?

[23:04] And so I have pivoted a number of times in my career and I've pushed to help a lot more.

[23:09] But I pivot when my underlying assumptions are proven incorrect.

[23:13] And so it's like, if we believe this to be true, then this is true.

[23:16] And if this is true, then this is true.

[23:18] So if for example, a report came out from TikTok and they said, we have banned accountants

[23:23] because we don't want financial people on our platform.

[23:26] Then I would say, no, we don't push here, like fundamentally the assumption that we

[23:31] based all of these actions on is not true.

[23:34] And so we pivot.

[23:37] And so I like to use that as a very clear litmus test of when am I being a pussy or when am I

[23:42] being intelligent?

[23:43] And so if I say, before we make this big investment, these are the assumptions that we

[23:47] believe to be true.

[23:48] And based on these assumptions, we will continue to persist.

[23:51] We will continue to iterate until we get what we want.

[23:54] If one of those assumptions is proven wrong and we have data to support that is not true,

[23:59] then we will change our course of action.

[24:01] And I will lose whatever investment I had there.

[24:03] But I don't even see that as losing.

[24:04] I see that as learning and we invested to learn data that no one else knows because if

[24:09] someone else knew it, well, they might have had to pay to learn it too.

[24:12] Great.

[24:13] And I mean, fundamentally, that's the ignorant tax of business that we all have to pay for.

[24:15] So let me give you a real example of a lady who I talked to yesterday who I actually said,

[24:21] I think you should pivot.

[24:22] Which is tough for me.

[24:23] I'm always going to be that, like, how hard can we push?

[24:26] Is there a way that we can get through this?

[24:28] But it became clear talking to her.

[24:31] And I'll give you this scenario so you can understand the difference.

[24:33] So she was a lady who had a can't cocktail business.

[24:38] So she had premium cocktails.

[24:40] They were in cans.

[24:41] Now you're like, okay, that's a little bit contradictory.

[24:43] Okay.

[24:44] And the cocktails were 5% ABV so they weren't cocktail strength.

[24:48] But so there's basically, like, premium fruit juice is now she wouldn't say this.

[24:51] This is me saying this.

[24:52] Premium fruit juice is with organic ingredients and all that stuff that were priced premium

[24:56] without a premium brand, but premium ingredients.

[24:59] And she was having trouble selling them.

[25:01] She was, I think she was doing a million and a half a year.

[25:04] And she had a thousand different distribution channels, like a literal as in like

[25:08] thousand different stores were carrying it.

[25:10] And if you're like, wait, a thousand stores, 1.5 million a year.

[25:13] Yes, the South root was very low, which means she was able to just basically

[25:16] front inventory to as people and they're not really moving it.

[25:19] And so when I hear that, I heard that.

[25:22] I was like, okay, well, what experience do you have in this world of all?

[25:25] And she had sold a gin distrull, but for not a lot of money.

[25:28] And I was like, okay, well, that's kind of related.

[25:31] And then she's like, well, I've got Amazon going.

[25:34] I've got a Shopify store.

[25:36] I have B2B wholesale and I have, she had all these different lines of business.

[25:41] And I was like, well, and she just let all of her staff go.

[25:43] So it's just her and it made zero profit.

[25:47] And she was asking me like, what should I do?

[25:50] And so, and this was tough for me because basically, I like to think about what's

[25:54] the hypothetical extreme version of this business.

[25:56] What is the, what is the maximize version of this business?

[25:59] And so I saw two different paths here for her.

[26:03] Path one was you, she said, I want to build a billion dollar thing.

[26:08] And I was like, all right, well, I mean, if you want to build a billion dollar thing,

[26:11] like that's going to be tough because you have no money.

[26:14] And so you have a thousand distribution channels.

[26:17] And so what we have to do is either a, you somehow get a lot of money and get a premium

[26:24] brand sponsorship.

[26:25] You get somebody who can make the association with you.

[26:27] And then you use that brand sponsorship, use the rock, Logan Paul, whatever to leverage

[26:32] into these master distribution bases.

[26:33] And that person promotes us to that people buy in person.

[26:36] Now she was RTD, meaning it's ready to drink.

[26:38] And so shipping costs made direct to consumer for me, not really a viable option.

[26:43] Two expensive.

[26:44] No, are there ways you can do it?

[26:45] Yes, she was listed on Amazon.

[26:46] It didn't make a lot of money there.

[26:47] But it was there.

[26:48] Now, the core thing that I asked her and by the way, if you're in this business, this is the

[26:51] core problem that you have to solve is that I said, what percentage of people who drink your

[26:56] drink for the first time buy it again?

[26:58] And she didn't have that metric.

[27:00] If there's ever a fucking important metric in a business for consumer package goods, is what

[27:04] percentage of people who try the thing do it again?

[27:07] And then mind you, this is of ideal customers, not everybody.

[27:10] So if you have a kids chocolate and you give it to old people, then they're probably not

[27:13] going to want to buy it again.

[27:14] But of the ideal avatar, of the ideal customer base that you have, what percentage of those

[27:17] people buy again?

[27:19] And she didn't even have that metric.

[27:20] It's like, well, this is going to be really tough.

[27:21] Now she'd never run for a response before.

[27:22] So I was like, I know there's no way that she's going to be able to do meat.

[27:26] She didn't like advertising.

[27:27] I was like, there's no way you're going to win.

[27:28] They'll be a billion dollar brand when you really have to be in the traffic business for

[27:34] cocktails if you're going to go to direct to consumer.

[27:36] Now, if she was like, I'm a dollar-shaped club advertiser, then I'd been like, maybe

[27:39] there's a way she could figure something like this out.

[27:41] But that wasn't her skill set.

[27:42] And so I was like, okay, well, you could do this big, you knew how to get into distribution

[27:46] bases.

[27:47] That was her skill because she had the distillery.

[27:48] So that was the one thing she brought to the table.

[27:50] But she didn't understand bringing it all.

[27:52] And she didn't know if the product was good because people didn't keep drinking it.

[27:55] So now what?

[27:57] She has never any money.

[27:59] So either she'd have to raise a ton of money, which I didn't think made a lot of

[28:03] sense at the level that she was at, or the recommendation that I had, as I said, listen,

[28:08] you're in the UK market.

[28:11] You need to go from a thousand distribution places to shrinking all the way down to regional

[28:15] and you need to go on foot and talk to each of the local sellers that sell your product

[28:21] at their liquor stores or at their convenience stores and you need to stand there and sample

[28:26] and sample and sample and tell your story.

[28:30] And when you do that, you'll make money.

[28:31] People will buy the product just for me being there.

[28:33] That's profitable on a day-to-day basis.

[28:35] But hopefully you do that a couple times a week at each store.

[28:37] A couple times a week at each store.

[28:38] And then all of a sudden, the sales people hear you saying it and then you make sure that

[28:41] they get commissions when they sell your product.

[28:44] And then all of a sudden, they start moving it for you.

[28:46] Now, all of this relies on the thing actually being good that if people drink it, they come

[28:50] back and buy it again because the sales can always move the first can and they're only

[28:53] going to really do it if they think it's good.

[28:55] And so, because they don't want to sacrifice their relational capital with the people

[28:58] that are regulars in the store.

[28:59] Like, oh, hey, Sarah, what would you buy in this week?

[29:01] I don't know, we just got this new, got this new cocktail thing.

[29:03] You should give it a shot.

[29:04] It's pretty good.

[29:05] Whatever.

[29:06] And so, these are the core pieces of which I believe that she would have to do if she wanted

[29:10] to make this successful.

[29:11] And I said, now to be clear.

[29:13] In order for this to work, one, this thing has to be exceptional in terms of the taste and

[29:17] people have to keep buying.

[29:19] First core principle, that has to be true because taking to it's absolute extreme, all

[29:23] the marketing and branding in the world, you're simply going to tell everybody you have

[29:26] a mediocre product, they'll never buy it again.

[29:28] And so, Jesse, it's a story that I like a lot.

[29:30] He had this product called Sheets.

[29:32] It was a caffeinated, like, list-erine strip.

[29:34] And he partnered with LeBron.

[29:36] So, he had premium brand, like Jesse gets it.

[29:38] Premium brand, big traffic, big distribution.

[29:40] He already had the connections to distribution.

[29:42] And he said, they started cranking sales first week.

[29:45] Second week, more sales.

[29:46] Third week, even more sales.

[29:47] Fourth week, even more sales.

[29:48] He's like, this is an example of your billion dollar brand in two years.

[29:50] This is unbelievable.

[29:51] Fifth week.

[29:52] Sales go down.

[29:53] Six week.

[29:54] Sales gave him lower.

[29:55] Seventh week.

[29:56] Sales gave him lower.

[29:58] Why?

[29:59] And he says this.

[30:00] The product just wasn't good enough.

[30:01] And so, if you're an expert marketer, expert brander with consumer package goods, you

[30:05] can absolutely get that big boom.

[30:07] If you do it right, and she didn't have that skills yet, and he had money and celebrity endorsements.

[30:11] She didn't either have those things.

[30:12] But I wasn't even confident that the product was good enough.

[30:15] If the product was, it would still keep growing at a slower pace, but it would still

[30:18] keep growing every month because people would come back to buy it.

[30:22] So for her, I said, you have to compress this all the way down.

[30:26] And then this might take 10 to 15 years.

[30:29] And if you're willing to do that, and she'd come in to be like, this is the market trends,

[30:33] blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[30:34] But what I didn't sense was what I call missionary heart.

[30:37] Now there's mercenaries who were like, look at the arbitrage, look at the charts, look

[30:40] at the public, this is the opportunity that I could tap into.

[30:42] It's like, yeah, but no one's buying your stuff.

[30:45] And if she had said, there's a hole in my heart, and I want this drink to be in the world

[30:49] because it changed my life, then I'd be like, awesome.

[30:51] Then like, let's make it happen.

[30:52] And you're going to be willing to pick 15 years because it's your soul.

[30:55] It's your passion, it's something that you feel like you're putting this earth to do.

[30:59] I didn't get that vibe from her.

[31:01] And so seeing that she wanted to have this big billion hour thing and seeing that she

[31:04] didn't have the heart for it.

[31:06] And knowing that the big brand play was probably off the table because she didn't have the

[31:09] money for it.

[31:10] I told her, I said, okay, I'll give you one Hail Mary.

[31:16] And if this Hail Mary doesn't work, you shut down the business and you move on.

[31:20] And so the Hail Mary was, the can size was small and it fit well for airport people.

[31:27] You know, like the airport, she says airplane, stirruces and train and bus people.

[31:31] They have these cards with little short trays.

[31:34] And so she's like, I'm in talks with them and they're very interesting because the size

[31:37] is actually right for them.

[31:39] And so I said, okay, well, if you can go close a cruise liner that has 90 cruise ships

[31:45] and you can make them your distribution, maybe you're selling the wrong market, maybe

[31:48] instead of selling to brick and mortar distributors, you actually just need to go to transportation

[31:54] base businesses.

[31:55] And then that's your niche.

[31:57] And the thing is, there, you only have to outcompete like two or three other people

[32:00] because it's super narrow.

[32:01] Now they're going to have very strict requirements of the can size, the weight, the packaging,

[32:06] the labeling, the price points, which is going to be a problem for her because she's premium

[32:09] and known cares.

[32:11] But if you sell into that and I said, go there, big bar ones still do whatever you can

[32:14] to get that contract.

[32:15] If you can't close one of these big contracts that will give you the cash for them to

[32:19] expand from there and that you could leverage like, hey, I just got into Carnival.

[32:22] Hey, Royal Cruise Line, do you guys want to get it to?

[32:24] Because you can leverage that one sale that gives you all the credit bill to get the

[32:27] rest of your meetings.

[32:28] But if you can't close that deal for me, I said, I think you pivot because I didn't

[32:33] think if I were betting, I wouldn't have been on the business.

[32:36] And I tried to serve the entrepreneur above everything else and given the skills that she had

[32:40] coming into it, that wouldn't have been the bet that I would have taken.

[32:44] And so I say, I say that as the counter example of there were fundamentals that would have

[32:50] to be true in order for her to win here.

[32:51] She would have to have a lot of money to do the big brand deal and have distribution.

[32:55] She would have to be super passionate and have a 10 to 15 year time horizon to make the regional

[32:59] super small play work hand to hand combat.

[33:02] She would have to have that.

[33:03] She'd have either of those things.

[33:04] And so the only real viable path that required no money that had the existing skills that

[33:07] she had was go to transportation distribution and use the fact that she had this kind of

[33:11] unique aspect of the size of the cans and have that be the selling point and hope to

[33:15] God that that actually works.

[33:17] Because if that didn't work, she would run out of money before anything else would happen.

[33:22] And then she would be forced to change the business and I would rather her learn that quickly

[33:26] than waste another three years not making progress on potentially a different business

[33:30] that would be better suited for her skill set.

[33:33] What made this particular woman really interesting is I said, like, how do you live?

[33:38] Because I asked pretty point-blank questions.

[33:39] I was like, how are you know, she looks like she had nice clothing.

[33:41] She looks like she lived nicely.

[33:43] And so she's that she sold a gym business.

[33:45] I said, Jen is in alcohol, not gym.

[33:49] And she said, oh, well, that actually didn't make a ton of money on that sale.

[33:52] And I was like, well, where did your money come from?

[33:53] And she said, oh, property development.

[33:55] And I was like, wait, what?

[33:57] She's like, yeah, I developed pen houses.

[33:58] And I was like, wait, so you have this cocktail business, but you also have this property

[34:02] development business.

[34:03] She's like, oh, well, I've been doing that my whole life.

[34:05] It's just on the side.

[34:06] It kind of runs itself.

[34:07] It's very easy.

[34:08] And I was like, okay, so let me tell you a little less than I've learned in my life

[34:10] for being an entrepreneur.

[34:13] When money comes easy, I go hard.

[34:16] When money comes hard, I go easy.

[34:19] And so so many of the business I have are half steps where it's like, I thought I was

[34:24] going to get here.

[34:26] And then boom, this flow of cash opens up.

[34:28] I was like, oh, maybe this is the business I should be getting into.

[34:31] Like Jim launch started by accident.

[34:33] I was doing turnaround flying out, doing done for you sales.

[34:36] And only because I was like, hey, I'm going to shift my business over to just selling

[34:39] direct to consumer that I said, hey, I'll sell the licensing of all the stuff that I used

[34:42] to use, that I made more money in a month than I ever made in my life.

[34:45] And I was like, whoa, maybe this is the business I'm in.

[34:49] And there's so many happy coincidence.

[34:51] There was another business owner that was there.

[34:52] They had an agency business.

[34:54] And so many of his customers needed finance, because he had a really high end thing.

[34:58] And so he was selling like 50,000 dollars, like very done for you, turn key website

[35:02] buildouts ads, whatever.

[35:05] And he realized that he was so good at getting people financing that he was making more

[35:10] money on the financing than he was on the actual agency services.

[35:13] And so he stopped doing agency services and just got into debt financing for businesses.

[35:16] So he just got into credit loans and started business lines and getting business debt.

[35:21] And so it's amazing how these things, how these stories come to be.

[35:24] It's like, you just gotta have the notice for the money.

[35:26] And so she was here saying that she had a prop, and I was like, so hold on.

[35:30] You've made all the money in your life from property development.

[35:33] And you basically play business on the side.

[35:36] So you, you easily, in a couple hours a week, make more money than you make with all your

[35:40] hours a week on this other business.

[35:42] She was like, yeah, I was like, well then why don't you just do all of your time on the

[35:45] thing that makes you the most money?

[35:47] And she said, I sort of got this, which she said, she said, that business isn't scalable.

[35:52] And I was like, okay.

[35:54] I want you to say that to me again, really slowly.

[35:58] Property development isn't scalable.

[36:01] I was like, so you're telling me that developing real estate is not a scalable business.

[36:07] I was like, do you know how many billionaires and 100 millionaires and decimillionaires

[36:11] made all their money developing property?

[36:13] It's literally the most scalable business.

[36:16] You add zeros and you develop a bigger property.

[36:18] That is how you do it.

[36:19] That is how you scale.

[36:20] No, you're going to have to hire employees.

[36:21] But guess what?

[36:22] You already know how to do it.

[36:23] And the other business, you don't know anything about the business.

[36:26] This business, you've been doing your whole life.

[36:28] And so you already know how you negotiate these loans, how you negotiate the properties

[36:33] and what markets you look after and where you see the arbitration, how you do the redecorations

[36:37] and who your interior designer is like, you already have other connections.

[36:40] You need to hire people.

[36:41] And so the real problem was that she just didn't know how to manage people.

[36:43] She didn't know how to train people.

[36:44] And that was then the real problem that honestly spread across all the businesses that she was

[36:48] trying to do with.

[36:49] But we tell ourselves these stories.

[36:51] And it's so interesting, the stories that limit us because anybody from the outside would

[36:56] be like, wait a second.

[36:57] So you make all this money really easily on this thing that has clear scale.

[37:01] That is a tried and true business that has existed for thousands of years, real estate.

[37:07] Or you have this thing that you have to have tons of capital.

[37:10] You have no experience in you don't have market.

[37:11] You don't know how to advertise.

[37:13] You don't know how to brand.

[37:14] You don't know media.

[37:15] And you don't want to go face to face hand to hand and do not go 100 doors and do that.

[37:21] Well, maybe we do more of the thing that you're really good at that you have all the

[37:24] experience of.

[37:25] And then we confront the problem that you didn't want to confront.

[37:28] The big hairy thing which was she didn't know how to scale that business.

[37:31] I said, so what I want you to do is instead of saying, this isn't scalable.

[37:35] I want you to say, I don't know how to scale this.

[37:38] And that becomes a problem that you can solve.

[37:41] It's the same as saying, there's no salespeople who sell like me.

[37:44] No, you don't know how to get salespeople to sell like you.

[37:47] There's no marketing doesn't work for my business.

[37:50] No, I don't know how to make marketing work for my business.

[37:52] You go from it being a circumstance, universe problem to something that you can control.

[37:57] And you take the sledgehammer, you confront the big concrete wall, you realize the

[38:00] payout that you have on the other side.

[38:01] And you ask yourself, if I had a business, that was a property development business.

[38:05] And I could scale it, how much would that be worth to me?

[38:09] And am I willing to do the work to get it?

[38:11] And if the answer is yes, then you get to work.

[38:14] And so if we look at this entrepreneur, the cocktail lady who had the property development

[38:18] business, she actually was in the right business in her property development.

[38:24] And rather than push, she pivoted.

[38:27] She got seduced by the woman of the red dress.

[38:29] She got seduced by ladies at, hey, your skill set would be so much cooler over here.

[38:33] You'd be able to build a billion dollar thing faster over here.

[38:37] But she could and probably needed to simply push through the existing business that

[38:43] had fundamental truths that she could not.

[38:44] You can't disprove like when someone, whenever someone says this business is a scalable,

[38:48] you have to break it down to physics.

[38:50] Tell me why physically it's impossible to scale property development.

[38:55] Is there not enough property to develop?

[38:58] Why, why is it not scalable?

[39:00] Because people aren't going to understand this now all the time.

[39:03] They're like, that business is in scalable.

[39:05] Why?

[39:06] It just means you don't know how to scale it or it's difficult to scale.

[39:09] Well guess what?

[39:10] There's also a big payoff for once you solve it.

[39:13] So usually people progress through the easier problems they know how to solve and then

[39:16] they stop when it's a problem they've never seen before.

[39:18] And then they try and come up with all sorts of crazy ideas that justify why they shouldn't

[39:22] keep pursuing or they shouldn't keep failing.

[39:25] And when I say failing, I mean trial and failing, trial and erroring, they don't want

[39:31] to keep erroring on the thing they're in and they just want to feel like they win again.

[39:35] And that's why they move.

[39:36] They move because they know how to win in this other thing.

[39:38] So they go for the quick win rather than the long win, which is you get through getting

[39:43] punched in the face over and over again and sledge it and you're way through the wall

[39:46] that you don't know how thick it is.

[39:47] And for that specific entrepreneur because I did talk to you and you might listen to this.

[39:51] If you really believe in this cocktail thing, then you got to go go for broke on this contract

[39:57] that you get for the transportation like there is it's a zero fail situation.

[40:01] Like if you want to make this business work, that is your zero fail situation.

[40:04] It's the only thing that's going to get you a lot of money for no capital down that

[40:08] it'll get you immediate distribution despite the fact that you don't have a big, like

[40:10] a big good brand.

[40:12] If you can just do that, that becomes your niche and then you try and own as much of that

[40:15] market as humanly possible.

[40:17] If you can or you don't succeed, this is where the heart is, where like if you heart, if

[40:24] you really wanted this thing to come to life, then you would go back and you start working

[40:27] local and you do a store to store and you'd say I'm going to commit the next 15 years

[40:31] to this.

[40:32] And that's if the product is good enough.

[40:34] If it's not good enough and people don't keep buying it, all of this will be for nothing.

[40:39] Truly, they get it will be for nothing because fundamentally the product has to be good

[40:43] enough that people want to buy it again.

[40:44] Otherwise you spend all the money to a car customer, they drink it once, there's no LTV

[40:47] and consumer package goods unless people get repurchases.

[40:50] That's it.

[40:51] It has to get repurchases without you telling them to buy it.

[40:54] And so if that's the big principle, like what's the foundational principle that we

[40:57] prove to be untrue, you'd either have to change the product or change the business.

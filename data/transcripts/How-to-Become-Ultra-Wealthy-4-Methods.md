[00:00] There are only four paths to getting ultra-ruffing.

[00:03] I crossed $100,000 network by age 31.

[00:06] And then I started Acrocise.com our investment firm.

[00:09] I spent the next year studying how to go from $100,000 to $1,000.

[00:13] And there are four paths we'll start with the first.

[00:15] So in the first path, you have other peoples, money, being invested into your business.

[00:26] Now, let's look at some of the business tidings that followed this path.

[00:34] So here you can see three pie charts with 17% 10% and 4%.

[00:39] If I were to show you this and say, do you think the people who own these pies are very rich?

[00:43] You might think, well, no, they own so little of the pie.

[00:46] But if I then said this is Tesla, this is Amazon.

[00:51] And this is Nvidia.

[00:53] Would you all of a sudden then think, oh wait.

[00:55] This is Jensen Huang, Elon, and Bezos, some of the richest people in the world who are

[01:02] all centipilliners and now at this point multi-centy billionaires.

[01:07] And these incredibly successful people understood the first path of getting ultra-ruffing,

[01:11] which is the combination of other people's money into your business.

[01:17] Now the way that it works is that you raise funds by selling a percentage of your company.

[01:22] So what this does is that it actually delutes you as a founder.

[01:25] Meaning, you no longer own 100% of your company, but now you might own 80% of a company

[01:31] that now has an extra $20 million for example that you can then use to grow.

[01:36] Now, there are some businesses that this is the only strategy to successfully realistically

[01:42] accomplish the goal.

[01:43] And then there are some businesses that this would be a terrible idea to pursue.

[01:47] Now, one thing that I think took me way too long to understand as an entrepreneur is that

[01:51] every single business occurs debt, the moment you start it.

[01:55] The question is what type of debt you're going to incur.

[01:58] And so for example, if you bootstrap a business as then you take no outside capital when you

[02:02] start it, you just fund it yourself and you own it and you grow it organically, then the

[02:06] debt that you take on is going to be that you're not going to have enough money to get the

[02:10] best talent in the door.

[02:12] And so you're going to have talent debt.

[02:14] You're probably not going to have enough money to get the right technological infrastructure

[02:17] in place to run the entire business.

[02:19] So you'll take on technological debt.

[02:21] And you can go down the line so they can get all the other answer, the non-financial versions

[02:26] of debt.

[02:27] Now, businesses that choose to take on financial debt, choose to take on that debt instead

[02:31] of the other types of debt because of the nature of the competitive dynamics of the market

[02:35] they're in.

[02:36] And so those types of businesses typically are in businesses that take a tremendous amount

[02:40] of capital to start up and scale or they're in winter take-all markets where speed is

[02:47] the primary objective of the business so that they can capture the opportunity and then fundamentally

[02:52] become monopolies of a new type.

[02:54] So Facebook, for example, became a monopoly of attention to a large degree.

[02:58] Now, because there are other social media platforms they get away with that, but they

[03:01] have created a big mode around all of the attention that exists in media.

[03:05] And so for them, there's only one real big social network that was going to exist and so

[03:10] they then captured it.

[03:11] Of course, LinkedIn was like, well, is there a version of that we can do for business professionals?

[03:15] And then they captured that.

[03:16] Now, can you imagine now another professional social media platform being like, oh, we're

[03:21] now starting up, it's like there's no room for you.

[03:24] It's already done.

[03:25] That market is captured.

[03:26] And so when there were other companies that were competing for the same market and the people

[03:30] were able to raise the most money, spend the most money the fastest, attract the best talent,

[03:35] we're able to capture the fastest, then sealing their competitive mode to keeping that as a long-term

[03:40] cash cow over the long haul.

[03:42] Which means that those businesses lose a tremendous amount of money for you.

[03:44] It's not a short period of time.

[03:46] And then they're able to kind of get over the hump and then become cash machines.

[03:49] And so for example, Amazon was unprofitable for nine years, famously.

[03:52] And there's an interview with Jeff Basos getting grilled on the tonight's, I think, with

[03:57] John J. Lennon, with J. Lennon.

[03:59] He's like, you guys don't make any money.

[04:01] And Jeff Basos just gives it, he does this like weird laugh.

[04:05] And he's like, yeah, we don't, but we could.

[04:08] We just choose not to because we get better returns on our capital by continuing to expand

[04:13] our infrastructure so that we can eventually support literally delivering things the

[04:20] next day to every single customer in America.

[04:22] Notwithstanding the fact that they have the single most successful subscription in history

[04:26] in Amazon Prime, more people are subscribed to Amazon Prime than owner Bible.

[04:31] They have over 300 million subscribers that's almost every single person in America.

[04:37] It's subscribed to a digital subscription for $99 per year, which I think now is 135, to

[04:42] have the ability, the privilege of shopping on their platform and getting faster shipping.

[04:47] And so when Basos was making the investment of capital into the business, he asked the

[04:52] question, not, what do I think is going to change in the next 10 years?

[04:55] He said, what things won't change in the next 10 years?

[04:57] And so he realized that there are some fundamentals that will never not be true.

[05:02] People will always want things to be faster.

[05:05] People always will want things to be easier.

[05:07] People always will want things to be risk-free.

[05:10] And if you can create an outcome that is desirable, fast, easy, and risk-free, then you

[05:16] have an incredibly valuable business.

[05:17] And so this corresponds with the value equation in the $100 off-risk book.

[05:24] And so time to lay a speed, eases can be our finance act price, perceive like a achievement

[05:28] is your risk.

[05:29] And then the dream outcome is making sure that you're not just making things fast, easy,

[05:32] and risk-free that no one wants.

[05:34] And so that's the dream outcome component.

[05:36] And so getting things to your door, a lot of people want that.

[05:38] If you can do it faster, they like that more.

[05:39] If you can make it easy for them, they like that even better.

[05:41] And if you can make it so that the purchase they had is very likely to be good, aka the entire

[05:46] review system that Amazon pioneered.

[05:48] Reviews were not a thing.

[05:50] Think about how crazy this is.

[05:51] They were not a thing.

[05:52] And a lot of people were afraid and pushed against basis when he wanted to roll out reviews,

[05:57] because they were afraid that sellers would hate it.

[05:59] But he bet on the fact that customers long-term would want the transparency.

[06:03] So in Jeff basis is very first capital round that he raised.

[06:07] He sold 20% of the business for $1 million to run 50 investors.

[06:13] And so imagine the return on that today for that $1 million for 20% of Amazon.

[06:17] It's more than he still controls to this day for context.

[06:20] And he took that to, by the initial inventory, get the website established, hire the first

[06:25] developers to get this going.

[06:27] And so if you're going to take on financial debt, use other people's money into your business

[06:31] if you have a market that must be captured quickly in order to get a network effective

[06:36] some sort.

[06:37] Or you have huge amounts of capital that are required to make the business start to begin with.

[06:40] So if I wanted to start calling a pharmaceutical business, then I would probably have to have

[06:44] capital for an extended period of time to start a new drug to do the research.

[06:48] And then maybe five years after we get the licensing, then have the ability to print money.

[06:51] But that capital would have to come from somewhere.

[06:54] And so unless you start as a billionaire to begin with, which you absolutely could do that,

[06:59] hypothetically, but the vast majority of these businesses are not started by billionaires.

[07:02] So start by everyday people who have a good idea.

[07:04] And then they go to people who have capital and say, hey, I will give you a piece of this

[07:07] upside.

[07:08] Now this is the live fast, you know, die hard style of making money.

[07:17] The reason it is that way is because it will typically be very investor favorable, especially

[07:23] the earlier it is because they are taking on more risk.

[07:26] And so the big thing about these mega wealthy paths is that the underlying thing that occurs

[07:32] in all of this is one return on investor capital.

[07:36] And to the risk that you're taking in order to validate or justify that return.

[07:42] So some guy in 1995 says he's going to start a bookstore on the internet, whatever that

[07:48] is.

[07:49] And you give him a million dollars.

[07:50] It's like I need 20% of this thing at least because no one's ever done this before.

[07:55] You've never started a business before.

[07:56] What's the internet?

[07:57] And are people even going to buy stuff on it?

[08:00] So there are so many unknowns here that it makes sense that they had a tremendous amount

[08:04] of compensation for the veritable guarantee that they would lose the money they were going

[08:08] to give.

[08:09] And that's probably part of the reason that Jeff Bezos didn't just raise it from his

[08:13] friends and family, despite the fact he was a Wall Street insider.

[08:16] So he could have easily gotten the million dollars from probably a handful of people.

[08:21] But he also probably knew that there was a very low chance of success, which I think he

[08:25] says in his early interviews.

[08:26] He figured that there was a low chance of actually making this work.

[08:29] And so when you follow this path, the other people's money into your business path.

[08:34] There is really only two big kind of potential outcomes.

[08:39] One is as a founder, you're going to de-risk along the way, which means that sometimes

[08:43] you will get something called secondary.

[08:45] So when an investor puts money into a business, they're going to appraise the business based

[08:48] on how quickly it's growing, how likely it is to continue to occur.

[08:53] And for them, the ease of investment is high because they just have to make the investment.

[08:59] But the fundamental value equation exists for them as an investor where your business

[09:03] is the product itself.

[09:05] And so let's say that we have a business before the money that is worth, we'll call it $10

[09:10] million.

[09:11] And then they say, I want to put $2 million into your business.

[09:15] So if they put $2 million into your business, this business is now a $12 million business,

[09:20] where they now own 20% and then everyone else now owns 80.

[09:26] And so the founders, the original shareholders, are going to get diluted.

[09:29] It means that they now own a smaller percentage, but now the business is more capital that

[09:32] can help it grow.

[09:34] Now a different path to this, if instead of putting $2 million into the business, they

[09:39] could have put, let's say, $1 million into the business and say, we're going to pay the

[09:42] founder over here into his personal bank account, $1 million.

[09:47] And so that's called secondary.

[09:48] And then most people even say primary, but it's kind of almost assumed that money is going

[09:51] into the business when you're raising round, around a funding.

[09:54] And so some founders will derisk along the way, because at some point, when you have

[09:59] a billion dollar asset and you have $100,000 in your bank account, some investors will

[10:04] understand that the founder themselves will become a little bit volatile.

[10:08] And so they want to give them a little bit of money so that they're not constantly freaking

[10:11] out and actually can make better quality decisions.

[10:14] So it's not uncommon for founders to take a little bit of chips off the table, as they

[10:18] continue to scale and raise funding.

[10:20] Now this is along the way they're making this money, but they still have this monster

[10:24] asset that's worth billions of dollars, or hundreds of millions of dollars.

[10:28] And so there's basically two paths from there for them to actually get paid.

[10:31] Path one is that a big private equity firm, which is now kind of a new thing, is that there

[10:36] are some firms that can buy billion dollar businesses and not have them be public.

[10:40] This is a new thing of probably the last call up seven to ten years, where there's enough

[10:45] private funds and enough private money, sovereign wealth sometimes overseas, that can

[10:50] take down companies of this size.

[10:51] When I say take down, I mean, put the capital in and buy it.

[10:54] So a simple example of this would be like a company like Kajabi, which is a learning platform

[11:01] where Tiger Capital came in and bought majority of the business and the founders basically

[11:06] now minority and they kind of had a full exit and almost all that cash went to the founders

[11:10] and very little into the business.

[11:12] And so in that setting, it's like they had a lot of capital, they bought this company

[11:16] and so now they're, you know, what's their exit?

[11:19] And so most of these paths, especially when you're raising funding, most of the time,

[11:22] is going to be some IPO.

[11:24] So in an initial public offering that then allows those shares to be made public, which

[11:28] allows the person who owns the whole pie and all the shareholders to have liquidity, meaning

[11:33] they have access that they can either sell those shares or they can lend against those

[11:36] shares.

[11:37] Either way, they have all the way of making money from the business.

[11:41] That counting distributions, which many businesses that are like this don't ever give

[11:45] distributions because they continue to reinvest the capital in the business because the

[11:48] returns from reinvesting the capital are superior to just getting a dividend.

[11:52] And so one of the difficulties with raising money is the nature of the money that you take

[11:58] on.

[11:59] And so all of these are completely unique deals, depending on the risk profile of the company,

[12:04] the risk appetite of the venture capital firm or whoever is making the investment.

[12:08] And how what their investment thesis or philosophy is.

[12:11] And if you look at 100 different VCs, you'll have 100 different investment philosophies

[12:15] in terms of what they're thinking about.

[12:16] Now all of them just want a big company, of course, but how they're going to get there

[12:20] is different.

[12:21] So there are some firms that only take on one company in a specific space, and they say we're

[12:26] going all in on this company, and we're going to provide all the help we possibly can to

[12:28] help them grow.

[12:29] Right?

[12:30] There are some companies that say, we want exposure to this entire market, and we're going

[12:33] to take a bet on 10 different companies in this market with the hopes that one of them will

[12:37] win.

[12:38] They even care that they're competitive.

[12:39] They just like, we want to make sure that we're with the winner, whoever the winner is.

[12:42] And so if you're in the latter example, each of those VCs he checks may say, well, we

[12:48] have to 10x this business in the next two years, or it's going to massively lose valuation.

[12:53] And so they will force the founders to take aggressive growth measures that may sometimes

[12:57] be not in the long term benefit of A the founder, but B the business, which might mean that

[13:02] they're overspending on advertising, they're overhiring on talent, that they let the

[13:05] culture get diluted or suffer because they can't have enough filters in place because

[13:10] of the rate or the pace of growth that they are requiring.

[13:13] And a lot of this growth is almost artificial because they're just injecting so much

[13:17] cash into advertising oftentimes to get the business to grow, that they actually didn't

[13:22] solve the core fundamentals of the business.

[13:24] So one of the dark sides of this that doesn't get told is that as you do more and more

[13:28] rounds, each VC or venture capitalist oftentimes gets a board seat or two board seats,

[13:33] and all of a sudden you might find out that you have a minority of your business and

[13:36] you no longer have voting power and you can get ousted from your own business from the

[13:40] investors that invested money in.

[13:42] And so a classic example of this was Steve Jobs, there was a period of time where he ended

[13:45] up getting kicked out of Apple for years before being able to come back.

[13:48] Now, mind you at that point, it was still public company and it had a board of directors,

[13:51] but it works the same way with a private company.

[13:53] I have a good friend of mine who is a who exited, had enough of an exit, it was a billion

[13:58] dollar valuation, you didn't get a billion dollars, but he had enough of an exit that

[14:01] he could retire, and he continued to work, but then they just said, we don't want you

[14:05] to work here anymore.

[14:06] And so he got fired, and then three years later they asked him to come back.

[14:09] And so it's very common to think, oh, this founder doesn't really know what he's doing,

[14:12] but the thing is the founder always knows the heart and the pulse of the business, because

[14:14] you're the one who knows each of the problems and why everything exists the way it does.

[14:18] In terms of wealth creation, when you take, let's say, a hundred of these bets, you can

[14:23] get supremely wealthy.

[14:24] So believe it or not, venture capital is the highest returning asset class of all asset classes.

[14:30] The problem is the amount of capital that you can allocate into that asset class typically

[14:33] is very close, very small, because most of these funds and good companies are over-subscribe.

[14:39] There's many investors who want to put money in when these deals are really good, or

[14:43] the likely that the business succeeds feels really high.

[14:46] And so what happens is you may take a hundred bets, and the winner you have may offset

[14:51] the losses, but you're still never going to get richer than the guy who has a fully

[14:55] concentrated bet on the one business.

[14:57] And so there's 99 entrepreneurs who failed and didn't make money, but one of them who still

[15:01] gets even richer than the venture capital investors who put money in.

[15:04] They use that one winner to offset their losses, whereas if you were the only guy who went

[15:08] all in on that, you don't have losses to offset.

[15:11] You just went all in.

[15:12] And the reason you would take path one is because you have a business model that requires

[15:16] you to grow quickly or have tremendous amount of capital for an extended period of time before

[15:20] it could become profitable.

[15:21] And using other people's capital, rather than saving up, let's say, ten lifetimes for

[15:25] the earnings to start a pharmaceutical company makes sense.

[15:29] If you've ever heard of like XYZ company raises money at a $500 million valuation, they're

[15:35] not saying they sold the company for $500 million dollars.

[15:38] They're saying that the founders deluded themselves and the other investors by some percentage,

[15:43] and it could be as little as one or two percent at that valuation.

[15:46] So for example, if you had a $500 million company and you sold 2% of that business, then

[15:51] you would have $10 million in cash that you could then put inside of the business to

[15:55] then help it grow.

[15:56] But you'd only sell 2% for that at that valuation.

[15:58] And so hopefully this put some relative numbers to some things that you've heard before.

[16:04] So let's say that you don't want all that risk, I guess we're going green now.

[16:08] You have your money and your business.

[16:16] And so this is probably the most common path that entrepreneurs take and I will say that

[16:22] a lot of the entrepreneurs that I aspire to and like to model tend to fall in this bucket.

[16:26] Now within this model, I want to make a very big point clear, which is that many people

[16:32] who are bootstrapped or could otherwise be bootstrapped businesses as in the founder

[16:37] themselves funds everything and doesn't take outside money, they sometimes act as though

[16:43] they are venture backed and that they must grow at all cost.

[16:47] And they chase growth for the sake of growth.

[16:51] And my first big thing that I will share with you is that rush is imaginary.

[16:56] 99% of businesses don't need to have some aggressive growth timeline because whether

[17:02] you're starting a chicken shack or you're starting a lawn care business, there's no network

[17:06] effect that you're going to build up.

[17:08] You just have to keep out competing and doing a good job in the local area or in the service

[17:13] vertical that you're concentrated in in order to achieve good returns for the business.

[17:17] And so if you look at Chick-fil-A with Estra at Kathy, they had a competitor at earlier

[17:22] on in their career called Boston Market.

[17:25] Some of the older people in my audience might have remembered this, I used to go there after

[17:28] baseball games.

[17:29] And Boston Market was kind of like chicken and homestyle cooking and they were direct

[17:33] competitor with Chick-fil-A.

[17:34] Now they raised a gazillion dollars and went super super fast and everyone told Chick-fil-A that

[17:38] they should do the same thing.

[17:40] But Estra Kathy being a lot more prudent of a man who didn't want to take that kind

[17:44] of debt on, who didn't want to just chase them and imaginary title for ego, he said,

[17:49] we just need to get better.

[17:51] And if we get better, our customers will demand that we get bigger.

[17:54] And fast four or ten years after Boston Market was kicking the tail off them and was a

[17:58] Wall Street darling, they eventually went bankrupt.

[18:01] Meanwhile Chick-fil-A 75 years later has 2600 locations and they're all privately held and

[18:06] they have no debt.

[18:08] And so now you might think, well, I don't want to wait 75 years.

[18:11] It really depends on what kind of vision you have as an entrepreneur because for me,

[18:14] my belief is like, if I could build something that outlasts me, I think that would be amazing.

[18:19] And sometimes the way to build something for the long term is to not build it for the short

[18:22] term, which is not fast and growing at all cost.

[18:25] Because sometimes you grow bigger by giving yourself the time to grow longer.

[18:28] Yeah, and I share the story because this is how I've started every company that I've

[18:33] founded.

[18:35] So I haven't founded a company and taken on capital.

[18:38] I have invested and co-founded.

[18:41] But if I'm the sole founder of the business, I have typically bootstrapped it, meaning

[18:45] I've funded the original business.

[18:46] So when I had my online fitness business, was my very first business.

[18:51] That was just me, and I spent the $5,000 to start that up.

[18:54] My gym cost me, I think $37,000 in total to start my first gym and sign the lease and get

[19:01] it kind of outfit it.

[19:02] So that was all me, that fronted that capital.

[19:05] When I opened up each additional location, it was the same thing.

[19:09] There's a key point there that I'm going to talk about, return to the investor capital in a

[19:11] second.

[19:12] So stay tuned.

[19:15] The next thing I had was gym launch, which was started by me, prestige lab, started by

[19:19] me, Allen, started by me, and acquisition not controlled by me, and funded.

[19:23] When you do that, you don't have any delusion, but you also have complete control.

[19:27] If you can think long, you can grow big.

[19:29] Now back to the Return On Investor Capital.

[19:33] Every business, you want to have a compounding vehicle with it.

[19:37] So what I want to do is walk you through a little company example that will illustrate

[19:42] this.

[19:43] So let's say we have company A, and we have company B.

[19:45] And let's say this is your one, your two, and your three.

[19:48] All right.

[19:49] So let's say your one company A sells honor customers, company B sells honor customers.

[19:54] Next year, for company A, they lose a hundred, but then they sell 200 customers.

[19:59] So they're plus 200, and then minus 100.

[20:03] Yes.

[20:05] So they lost honor customers.

[20:06] They still did 200 sales.

[20:08] This company gets plus 100, and then minus zero.

[20:12] So they're now at 200 in total.

[20:15] 100 from the first year, 100 new customers from the second year.

[20:19] And let's say your three, company A sells 300 new customers, and now also loses the

[20:25] 200 customers from the year before.

[20:27] And your three, they company B sells another hundred customers, but has the 100 from

[20:33] year one and the 100 from year two.

[20:35] Now, both of these companies are going to have 300 customers in that year.

[20:40] Which business would you rather have?

[20:42] Hopefully if you watch anything that I talk about, you would want company B.

[20:46] Why?

[20:47] Because this is a company that is stable, that will continue to grow year over year

[20:50] year, and they don't need to necessarily grow.

[20:53] They don't need to grow faster if they just do a good job and keep the customers they

[20:56] have.

[20:57] They will just consistently grow year over year.

[20:58] And I'll tell you this, knowing that no matter what happens, you will always get bigger

[21:02] is a very nice value proposition for an investor or for you as an entrepreneur.

[21:06] And so the key is that you want to have some sort of company vehicle within the business.

[21:11] And so to accomplish that, there are pretty much only two ways to do this.

[21:15] So the first is that you sell stuff that people never stop buying.

[21:18] And so that can either be a recurring, or reoccurring membership.

[21:22] So a reoccurring business might be something like Coca-Cola, right?

[21:26] Where you start drinking Coca-Cola and you go to Costco and you buy it when you go to restaurants

[21:30] you buy it and see you buy from a number of different places.

[21:32] Now you're not going to have a subscription for Coca-Cola, but you might just buy it on a regular

[21:35] basis.

[21:36] And so because of that, once they acquire you as a customer, you keep paying them.

[21:39] Starbucks is the same way.

[21:40] Once someone goes to Starbucks, the average customer spends $14,000 in Starbucks.

[21:44] They just keep buying products from them, right?

[21:46] You're not on a subscription, but you do keep going back.

[21:49] The other version of this is something like Netflix where you have subscription, you have

[21:52] a membership of some sort, and people stay on and keep paying.

[21:57] And so in either of those situations, as you acquire customers, the business just keeps growing.

[22:00] And so every new customer you bring in just grows this big bowless of people that over time

[22:04] makes you more and more money.

[22:06] Now the second scenario is where, and this happens all the time in like home services,

[22:12] solar, roofing, a lot of real estate adjacent type stuff, where you have a business.

[22:18] I mean, even physical products can be this way.

[22:20] Where you have a product that doesn't have a lot of return business.

[22:25] So if you buy a house in cell house, it's like maybe somebody comes back to you three, four

[22:28] years later.

[22:29] There's nothing wrong with that, but you probably wouldn't describe that as a recurring

[22:31] or reoccurring business.

[22:33] And so instead, if you own a business like that, what you'd want is a growing network of people

[22:37] who never stop selling for you.

[22:39] So here you have customers who never stop buying, and here you have a distribution base

[22:42] of people who never stop selling.

[22:44] And so for example, Prestige Labs, the someone company we had, people who go to the

[22:48] gym and try to lose weight, that's a very cyclical thing, people trying to lose weight for a

[22:52] little bit, and then they fall off.

[22:54] And that's common.

[22:55] Now that being said, what can make the company more stable is if I have a thousand locations

[22:59] that are consistently selling product every month.

[23:02] Now the who they sell it to might change, but the fact that they are continuously selling

[23:07] becomes the node of kind of recurring revenue or reoccurring revenue, but just one level

[23:11] chunked up.

[23:12] And so this is a distribution-based model, this is a customer-based model, but both of

[23:16] these compound.

[23:17] And so when I look to invest in a business or start a business, I try and solve for this.

[23:22] Once you solve for this, growth becomes inevitable.

[23:24] Right, and because of this, when I was 26 or 7 years old, it was the first year that I

[23:28] made a lot of money, and I took home, I think just under $17 million in profit, personally,

[23:34] income.

[23:35] And so this stuff absolutely does work.

[23:38] So this is just like armchair and theory, and then I'm just like talking about something

[23:42] I haven't done.

[23:44] And I can understand any skepticism around that because of a YouTube video in the internet.

[23:49] That being said, the key to growth in this path, so when we're at, so when you're in this

[23:55] box, it's your business and your money, your key or your path to growth is something

[24:00] called a return on invested capital.

[24:01] So it's ROIC.

[24:03] Now return on invested capital basically is how much money does it cost me to make more

[24:08] money.

[24:09] And so for example, there are multiple levels of this within a business.

[24:13] And so if I have a brick and mortar business, you're going to have the lowest level of

[24:17] this, which would be LTV, lifetime value, to CAC, which is how much does it cost me to

[24:21] get?

[24:22] Costumers versus how much do I make from that customer of a time.

[24:24] That's the base unit of economic arbitration of business.

[24:26] This is how you make money fundamentally.

[24:28] Now leveled up from this, you have ROIC, which still talks about the same concept, return

[24:32] on invested capital.

[24:33] How much does it cost me?

[24:34] The return, this is basically LTV.

[24:37] Capital is the cost, right?

[24:38] It's just one frame.

[24:39] So I'm trying to give you the real terms rather than just use some of the third grade.

[24:43] Third grade terminology so that you can actually learn it.

[24:45] All right.

[24:46] So return to invested capital.

[24:47] Typically, we'll describe the larger unit.

[24:50] So if my, my, my massage business, for example, cost me $10 to get a customer worth $1000,

[24:56] then that would be an amazing LTV to CAC.

[24:58] But the question is how much does it cost me to open a massage studio?

[25:00] Well, I mean, this doesn't take into account the lobby, the build out, the licenses,

[25:05] the recruiting costs, administrative costs, tech costs, you know, construction, whatever.

[25:11] And so at this point, it's like, okay, maybe I have an amazing LTV to CAC, but my return

[25:15] on capital might be not as good or it might be amazing, right?

[25:18] And so here is basically the bigger money multiplier within the business over the longer

[25:23] term.

[25:24] And so let's say that we have a business that does $1 million top line and we own the whole

[25:28] thing, okay?

[25:29] Million top line and let's say it makes $250,000 in profit.

[25:34] Okay.

[25:35] Now, if we are entrepreneurs, then we have two options.

[25:39] We can reinvest that in our business or we can put into another business or another asset.

[25:43] But if we know that our returns on a capital are very good, then it would be who of us

[25:47] to put it into our own business.

[25:49] And so let's say that my return on a invest capital in my brick and mortar chain, for

[25:53] example, is that I get, let's say that it costs me to open this million dollar business.

[25:59] It costs me $50,000 to open a store and within 12 months it makes $250,000 back.

[26:08] And if you hear that and you're like, whoa, that's amazing.

[26:10] This happens all the time.

[26:11] This is not that uncommon.

[26:12] I told you about my gym cost me $37,000 and I was making $20,000 within six months.

[26:17] And so you absolutely can have these kind of metrics, okay?

[26:22] So at this point, what would it make sense for me?

[26:25] Why should probably take my $250 and basically have this times $5 and then this gives

[26:30] me this times $5 and all of a sudden the next year, I make $1.25,000 million.

[26:37] And what I do the next year, this is how compounding occurs.

[26:41] So then I split this up and would this allow me to do, I would open up 25 locations.

[26:46] And then that would make me $5.25 million in that income.

[26:53] Now of course when you're at this point, the constraint will quickly be operational constraint.

[26:58] You'll actually have a people issue of trying to staff all these things, get all the

[27:02] location signed and this is why some people turn to franchising and things like that so

[27:07] that they can expand a little faster.

[27:09] And that being said, it is the most expensive form of equity because you're giving away

[27:12] basically the entirety of your business for a percentage of the top line.

[27:16] But then you have to still service all of the locations almost as if you own them.

[27:20] And so I'm not the biggest fan of franchising.

[27:22] There are times where it does make the most sense, but most times it's because founders are

[27:26] in a rush.

[27:27] And so if it's your first business ever, my strong recommendation is that you start here.

[27:32] Because you have to pay down so much ignorance debt, so much tax from the universe for

[27:38] not knowing what you're doing, that the last thing you really want to do is risk the

[27:41] money of your friends and family.

[27:42] That's just my two cents, you can do whatever you want, that is my opinion.

[27:46] If this is your first time business, I would strongly recommend doing your business with

[27:50] your money because there's so many things that you don't know and you have to pay down

[27:54] your ignorance debt.

[27:55] You have to pay down the cost of not knowing what you're doing.

[27:58] And I'd rather you do that on your money than someone else's.

[28:00] Now, if you do start to have this business that starts doing well and you start having

[28:05] this XXCash, our $250,000 in the example I just gave, let's just do a different color

[28:10] to keep things, keep things zesty.

[28:12] So the third path is that you can have your money with other people's businesses.

[28:21] So remember here we had our $250,000 profit from this business that we created.

[28:25] Well of course we could put it into our own, but if we put it into someone else's,

[28:30] then we want to understand what our return profile is going to be.

[28:33] And so this is what I would consider the path of the investor.

[28:36] And so if the first category is the path of the venture backed entrepreneur, the second

[28:41] path is the bootstrapped entrepreneur, the third path is the path of the retail or just

[28:46] traditional investor.

[28:47] You have some extra cash and you want to put it into something else.

[28:50] So for example, you guys have probably seen the show Shark Tank where there's five sharks

[28:54] that are all wealthy people and entrepreneurs come to them and they invest in their

[28:58] companies.

[28:59] What they get, what they give is money and help and what they get back is some percentage

[29:06] of the upside depending on how the deal is structured.

[29:09] And so those sharks tend to have less time and so what they're compensated for is risk.

[29:15] And so when you become an investor, the chief thing that you give is that you de-risk

[29:20] the founder and you incur some of that risk, you shoulder some of that risk, not an exchange

[29:26] for a work or time, but an exchange for capital, which fundamentally means I tell you

[29:29] that I took time somewhere else, I did work somewhere else and I'm going to throw that into

[29:33] your business so that I can offset your personal risk.

[29:36] Now the benefit of an investor is that you can diversify to a wide degree, meaning you can

[29:40] take a hundred bets, you can take a thousand bets.

[29:42] So every single share that you own in a public trading company is a small bet that you're

[29:46] making is an investor.

[29:47] And if we share that you own a privately traded company, it works the same way.

[29:50] It's obviously not privately traded, but just off market, it works the same way.

[29:55] Investors in general tend not to be the wealthiest people in the world.

[29:59] And so this is why, in my opinion, real estate has created more millionaires than any

[30:04] other vehicle, but private equity has created more billionaires than any other vehicle.

[30:10] And so it's because of the nature of the concentration of risk and reward.

[30:14] And so when you are the business that goes all the way to the investor, you might

[30:20] represent 1% of their portfolio.

[30:23] You might have it, they might have a huge win with this business, but it's only going

[30:26] to be 1%.

[30:27] But if it's your business in either of these scenarios, then you're probably going to have

[30:32] a big slice of that pie, which means that their 1% win might be a 20% win, an 80% win,

[30:39] for you.

[30:40] But what we don't see is the other 99 entrepreneurs who just go to zero.

[30:44] And so this is where I think that from a personal level, you have to know what you are

[30:48] shooting for.

[30:49] Because if you're like, I just want to get rich, then investing in sound assets that

[30:54] can give you a good return over a long period of time, there's probably no sure way

[30:58] to become wealthy.

[30:59] To become the richest person in the world, or the top 100 richest people in the world,

[31:03] you will almost invariably have to do one of the other two paths that I just described.

[31:08] The fourth path that I'll show you last is one that also gets you on the top 100 list

[31:12] too.

[31:13] And I'll share how that works in the second.

[31:15] But the beauty of being a traditional investor where you take your cash and you invest

[31:19] in businesses is that it's unlimited scalability.

[31:22] It's for the most part passive with the exception of the active work they have to do in finding

[31:26] source and negotiating the deals, which is work, but typically less than running a business.

[31:32] And so since I am an active investor, why don't I share with you some of the things that

[31:36] I look for in businesses that I invest in.

[31:38] Now to be clear, this will be my investment thesis.

[31:40] There are many.

[31:42] So for me, I create content like this so that I can get exposure to entrepreneurs so that

[31:46] they can come towards acquisition.com and say, hey, I'd like to do it with you or like

[31:50] your help to help a scale.

[31:51] And we happily do that.

[31:52] And this is how we get to know businesses at early stages so that we can be with them

[31:55] throughout their careers.

[31:56] I mean, the smallest company that we that we start work with had done $2 million the year

[32:00] before.

[32:01] And this year we'll probably finish around 110 million in revenue.

[32:03] And that's mind you over years, not like a couple months.

[32:07] And so number one is that I try to invest in high cash flow businesses that are profitable.

[32:13] So I like getting distributions every month because it offsets my principle.

[32:17] And it tells me that the business is doing well, very on a much faster feedback loop.

[32:22] So number one is I invest in high cash flow businesses.

[32:31] And mind you, this is in my active arm.

[32:32] Adagwis are not common.

[32:33] Just kind of our private equity portfolio.

[32:35] We have a venture arm, which is ACQ Ventures, where we write smaller checks for smaller

[32:41] slices of businesses, where we are not involved in our primary value ad is risk.

[32:48] And a light amount of help compared to what we do when we're heavily investing in a company

[32:53] we're taking 30, 40, 50 plus percent of the business.

[32:58] In those instances, we're going to be working, we're going to be leading the strategy

[33:02] that business versus just saying, I believe in this entrepreneur in this team.

[33:06] I believe in this concept.

[33:07] And I'm willing to write a check and take on some risks I'm going to expose to some

[33:10] upside.

[33:13] So this is my private equity thesis.

[33:16] The second is that I want something that can grow.

[33:20] And so fundamentally, for growth, there's only two ways that a business can grow.

[33:24] We can increase the number of customers.

[33:28] Or we can increase lifetime gross profit or LTV per customer.

[33:33] So we can get more people or increase how much they're worth.

[33:36] And if we see a path that's very clear that we can say, oh, we know how we're going

[33:39] to get this company more customers.

[33:40] Or we know how we're going to be able to double triple quadruple how much customers are

[33:43] worth, which one will immediately make us more money.

[33:46] But then also allows to spend more money to get more customers.

[33:49] So school, for example, is one of our largest investments.

[33:54] At this point, I wanted to take a very big swing on something that I think could change

[33:59] in industry.

[34:00] And it's an industry that I understand very well, which is education in media.

[34:04] And I feel like very, I have edge there.

[34:07] I understand it.

[34:08] Could something happen?

[34:09] It could go wrong.

[34:09] Maybe.

[34:10] But in the last year, we, you know, six acts, the business.

[34:14] So it did, we had a good year.

[34:16] And so with school, it was like, OK, do I clearly know how we can help

[34:21] it get more customers?

[34:22] Yes.

[34:23] And so that was fundamentally what we drove.

[34:24] Now, the Life Simbrist Profit is very much product driven, which is not the role

[34:27] that we decided to take on for this particular investment.

[34:30] But I did know that I have a huge part of my audience that wants to start a business.

[34:33] And so I said, OK, well, I don't have something for people who want to start a business.

[34:37] All my stuff is really for business owners.

[34:39] But people who want to start businesses still want to learn about business before

[34:42] they start businesses.

[34:43] And so I wanted to somewhere I could say, well, if you're not sure, go there.

[34:47] And if you're not even sure about that, just read some of these books.

[34:49] So you can get a little bit more context on what you could potentially sell.

[34:52] The third thing that I look for is focus.

[34:55] And I talk about this a lot, which is, is the founder, someone who can say no,

[34:59] who's focused on a specific avatar, a specific customer,

[35:03] has lived the life or the problem of that customer.

[35:06] And I don't want to have to niche slap a founder.

[35:09] All right, so niche slap is where they're like,

[35:10] I do everything for everyone, which really means nothing for no one.

[35:13] And so the benefit of being very focused on one specific customer avatar or

[35:17] ICP, ideal customer profile, depending on what market you listen to.

[35:22] If you have that, you can solve people's problems far better because you can be more nuanced

[35:27] in the solutions you provide.

[35:29] You can also charge more because the actual value is higher.

[35:33] And you can tend to acquire customers cheaper because your messaging will be more targeted

[35:38] and the target of your advertising itself can also be more targeted.

[35:40] So, both the words, the offer, the deliverable, the pricing, all of this is a strategic question,

[35:46] which is why I want to make sure the strategy of the business makes sense.

[35:49] And then fourth, and this is probably the biggest one of all of them if we're being very real,

[35:53] is Jockey over everything.

[35:57] Now, I'll put one caveat out, which is,

[36:01] I'm not going to try to enter a market that I think is going to die.

[36:04] So, if someone's like, hey, I have a new gas powered car, that probably wouldn't be the bet that I would

[36:09] make.

[36:10] If someone says, hey, I have this brand new print newspaper that I want to start, probably wouldn't

[36:14] be the bet that I would make.

[36:15] But if they're in a market that I don't foresee is going to disappear tomorrow, then all of my

[36:19] emphasis is going to be on the Jockey, which is how good is the person, the founding team,

[36:23] for the business?

[36:24] Because the thing is, is that the founding team is going to encounter innumerable problems

[36:28] as they try to scale this thing.

[36:30] And you have to trust their ability to solve problems.

[36:32] Because it doesn't matter how good the idea is, your ability to consistently solve problems

[36:37] in a cash efficient manner is how you can grow a business over the long term.

[36:41] And so you want someone, and I'll use Uncle Warren's, you know, three big, three big

[36:45] values.

[36:46] You want someone who's incredibly industrious and hardworking.

[36:48] You want someone who has very strong ethics and somebody who's competent and intelligent,

[36:53] right?

[36:54] And so, you have competence, you have work ethic, and you have integrity.

[36:58] And so, he famous, he says, well, you know, if you have just competence and work ethic,

[37:03] but you don't have integrity, you've got a crook who's working really hard against you.

[37:06] He's like very bad.

[37:07] He said, so if you are going to have that, you'd rather have somebody who's really competent

[37:11] but lazy and disintegrates because at least that way he's not going to do you as much damage.

[37:16] So you want to have all three.

[37:17] Now, what's difficult about this is that even one of those three things is hard to find.

[37:21] Somebody who's truly has character, even when the chips are stacked against them, because

[37:24] it's the only time that it matters.

[37:26] Or someone who has tremendous work ethic, especially when it matters in the business, when

[37:30] things are tough or you're going through a growth period that's just like, it's just

[37:33] requiring you to work 20 hours a day because you just, there's not enough people, but you

[37:37] need the business requires it right now.

[37:39] Or you just have someone who's exceptional product or prospect knowledge that they, that

[37:44] interagely gives them, that gives them tremendous edge over their competition because they

[37:48] understand everything down to.

[37:50] I love this analogy that a VC who invested in a regal, which is now in a pretty tough

[37:55] situation, but for years was a cash-cold business, regal centimus.

[37:59] He said, when he talked in the founder, he said, that guy understood the cost and everything

[38:03] down to the kernel of popcorn.

[38:04] He said he just knew everything about the business.

[38:06] He said, he's like, there was really no reason that I should get into centimus.

[38:10] He's like, but when I saw this guy talk about it, he was like, he was so energetic and so

[38:15] passionate about it and clearly had good character and he just understood the business.

[38:19] So he was like, there's no way with this guy's not going to make money in it.

[38:22] And he did.

[38:23] And that is a great example of a business that required a ton of capital to start, opening

[38:27] a movie theater is cost a ton of capital.

[38:29] And so it makes sense that that business owner, even though he knew everything about it,

[38:32] probably been there for a long time, he still asked for investors rather than saying, you

[38:36] know, I'm going to take another 10 years to say all the money in my own, just to start

[38:39] one, when he's like, you know what, I could leverage other people's lifetimes of work so

[38:43] that I could basically be at your 10 at your one and have a smaller slice of the much bigger

[38:48] pie.

[38:49] And so fundamentally, betting on the jockies is the highest leverage that you can make because

[38:53] you're betting on someone's ability to solve problems in an dynamic environment.

[38:56] And businesses, if anything, it is dynamic.

[38:58] So the environment may change.

[39:00] The market may shift.

[39:01] Some of the variables are assumptions that you thought were going to be there aren't.

[39:04] And some of the most famous founders were companies that started not even with that intention.

[39:08] Like Slack was a video game company that eventually just had this engineering Slack thing,

[39:14] little Slack thing, right?

[39:15] Engineering, messaging tool that ended up being good and then they shifted to that, right?

[39:19] Because they just had exceptional founders who were able to pivot and be adaptable.

[39:22] And so in some ways, betting on the right jockies almost like insurance for an investor

[39:26] is like, I just think this guy's brilliant and hardworking and I think when something happens,

[39:31] he will figure it out.

[39:32] And so when we're looking at all four of these things, it's a high cash flow business,

[39:36] it has high growth potential, there's a focused founder and they exhibit high character,

[39:42] high work ethic and high competence, then it's like, okay, well, there's companies that meet

[39:47] all of these criteria, which is still rare, what makes you pick one versus another.

[39:51] And so for us, we operate under ed acquisition.com, one thesis, which is the theory of constraints,

[39:55] which is that a system will grow and told us constraint and the no-grown of further.

[39:59] And so once we find what the constraint of the business is, then we attack that constraint

[40:02] with all the resources and all the brain power and all the money we have to try and

[40:05] solve that constraint.

[40:06] To that unlock the next level of growth until the next constraint.

[40:09] So to give a simple example, if we were to simply tenx advertising for a long-care business,

[40:14] if they don't have ten times the salespeople to take those leads, the next constraint, like,

[40:18] us just blowing the doors off the front end is just going to lead to the next constraint.

[40:21] Then we have to hire more sales guys.

[40:23] But even if we did the marketing and then we did the sales, then we'd have to hire more guys

[40:26] to do the, to move the lawns, right?

[40:28] And so the constraint, when could you even move down the pipeline until the entire business

[40:32] that could de-contrain and then you will realize the throughput increase of having this huge

[40:38] influx?

[40:40] And so for us, if we understand the business well, so it has all of these things and it happens

[40:47] to be in a space that we feel like we understand better than other people, then that's where

[40:50] we will be more likely to take our bet.

[40:52] And the better we understand it, the bigger the bet will make.

[40:54] And so to give you context on this, the company founders within our portfolio, not including

[41:01] school because this metric would be stupid if I put school in there.

[41:05] The average founder in our private equity portfolio has had a 13 extra turn on equity.

[41:10] And so think about like this, if your company was worth $10 million when it started, your

[41:17] slice, I'd have to, the circle would be much bigger than this page, your slice of equity,

[41:22] let's just not draw into size, right?

[41:24] Your slice of equity later would be worth $130 million.

[41:29] And that's at the point right now today of making this video.

[41:31] And so independent of how much they quote sold to us, they are significantly wealthy they

[41:37] were before.

[41:38] And I think we may be the only private equity fund that even tracks what the Returnal founder

[41:41] equity is.

[41:42] And that's because long term, I believe that me getting great deal flow from founders

[41:46] who want to do business with me is the long term strategy that is going to make acquisition

[41:51] dot com into a powerhouse with a new model of private equity.

[41:56] As an investor, you can think through these things and invest in companies that meet these

[42:00] requirements and ideally are in companies that you have some sort of edge in that you

[42:04] understand better than other people.

[42:06] The final way of getting ultra wealthy is other people's money.

[42:11] And other people's businesses.

[42:15] You're like, wait a second, okay, so we've got other people's money in your business,

[42:19] that's raising funding.

[42:20] You've got your money in your business that's bootstrapping it.

[42:23] You've got your money and other people's business here in investor.

[42:25] And then you've got other people's money and other people's businesses, which makes you

[42:29] a fund manager.

[42:30] So let me explain.

[42:31] For example, when I sold Jim launch and prestige labs, I sold those two American Pacific

[42:37] Group in 2021.

[42:39] They are a $500 million fund, which now has a second fund that's another seven inch, so

[42:43] they have $1.2 billion on our management.

[42:46] Now they bought Jim launch and prestige labs together as a package for $46.2 million.

[42:52] Now that checked they did to me represented a small amount of the overall funds that they

[42:57] had.

[42:58] So let me show you exactly why people who run funds make a huge amount of money.

[43:03] So a typical fund manager typically not always, but it is common for if you wanted to

[43:09] raise, call it $100 million, okay?

[43:12] Let's say that that's the amount of funding that you wanted to raise.

[43:15] A fund manager, which would then be typically the general partner, the GP, would put something

[43:19] like 5% in.

[43:21] So they would contribute $5 million of their own capital and sometimes that's between

[43:24] multiple partners to fund the $100 million.

[43:27] Because most investors want to make sure that you have some skin in the game that you

[43:30] care.

[43:31] All right.

[43:32] Now that means that they're going to get $95 million from other people's money, okay?

[43:38] Stay on track with me.

[43:39] Now the question is what is $100 million by me?

[43:43] Well in private equity, $100 million can then lever so you can leverage this and get $200

[43:51] million in debt to buy $300 million worth of businesses.

[43:56] So think about the leverage here.

[43:58] You put $5 million in and you're able to buy $300 million for the businesses.

[44:04] So then the question is, okay, but then what do these guys get for taking this risk?

[44:08] Great question.

[44:09] So the typical fund structure has a 2 and 20 structure.

[44:13] This kind of industry average, there's obviously some that are different than that, but this

[44:15] is the most common structure.

[44:17] And so 2% the first number that people say it's like what's the structure?

[44:20] If you hear something say 2 and 20, 1 in 1 in 25, whatever, what the referencing is the management

[44:25] fee, which is charged off of funds raised every year.

[44:30] And then the 20% is off of the profit that's generated at the ultimate conclusion of

[44:35] the fund.

[44:36] All right, so let's say 10 years from now, we've exited all of the positions that we had,

[44:40] and we turned this $300 million of companies into $900 million.

[44:45] So over 10 years, let's say we triple the money in general.

[44:47] We triple the value of the companies, okay?

[44:51] Now, what do we have to do?

[44:53] So over, let's say this is 10 years, over the 10 years, that 2% equals, so this is management

[45:02] fee, equals $20 million.

[45:05] So you get $20 million in management fees just for that 10 year period of time.

[45:09] Now mind you, you have employees, you have costs, and so fundamentally the management fees

[45:13] are supposed to help you run the actual fund without having to put more stress on the

[45:18] companies that you're buying.

[45:20] The 20%, so this is called the carry, what's cool about this is that there's no tax

[45:25] with a carried interest.

[45:26] Sorry, the cool thing with carried interest, which is kind of the profit part for the

[45:31] fund manager, is that it gets tax-licapital gains.

[45:34] And so basically they can make their income in a tax-efficient manner.

[45:38] So let's say that we sell our, all the companies, and so we have to take out the debt

[45:44] that we owe, right?

[45:45] So we have $200 of debt that we owe, and then we have to return the 100, I'm just going

[45:49] to say round numbers.

[45:50] We have to put the $100 million back into the investors' pockets.

[45:53] All right, so we have $600 million back.

[45:55] Now there's going to be some interest costs here, so maybe it's, you know, if it was over

[46:00] 10 year period, we'll say $100 million in interest payments that we had to pay to also carry

[46:06] this debt.

[46:07] Okay?

[46:08] Let's just say, have a $500 million left over.

[46:10] Now we have our 20% carry, which means that we're going to get $100 million for doing this.

[46:19] So we took our five, we got paid 20, and a hundred in that 10 year period.

[46:27] And this hundred also post tax is $80 million.

[46:31] And so all and all, you're making $100 million plus with a $5 million slug.

[46:41] And so mind you, this is when you start with $5 million.

[46:46] What happens when you capitalize a fund and you put $100 million in and you raise a $2 billion

[46:50] fund?

[46:51] Well, I'll just multiply these numbers by 20.

[46:55] It gets really big, really fast.

[46:57] And so fund managers employ one of the key principles of wealth and I'll have a follow-up

[47:02] video on the principles of wealth, but one of the key principles is leverage.

[47:06] And so they have multiple forms of leverage that they're able to multiply.

[47:09] It's why acquisition.com is two, like in my opinion, the two strongest forces in business

[47:13] are leverage and supply and demand.

[47:15] And so supply and demand is these two little curves here.

[47:18] And then leverage here is this full-term.

[47:20] And so they first leverage their $5 million to get $95 million from investors.

[47:26] Then they leverage the entirety of that $100 million to buy companies which then use the

[47:30] companies they leverage the companies to get the debt off of these initial cash checks that

[47:35] they can write.

[47:36] And then all of a sudden that five becomes 60 times bigger in terms of the assets that

[47:41] you can control.

[47:43] And so obviously APG ran this exact model and they had a $500 million fund, right?

[47:52] But if acquisition.com, one day in the future, wanted to have a fund saying, hey, I'll

[47:59] put money in.

[48:00] And if you guys want access to the deals that I've access to and what my team work on

[48:03] for you, basically, then we would have some fun structure in place that would allow everyone

[48:09] else to participate.

[48:11] And so a fund typically should get structured because you have one of two key things.

[48:16] In my opinion, this is now just me talking else as a opinion.

[48:19] You should have access to deal flow that other people don't have, so proprietary deal flow.

[48:24] The recent proprietary deal flow is super valuable as two things.

[48:27] Number one is that you will get better negotiated terms on the deals, meaning that you

[48:32] could buy assets for maybe less than intrinsic value or less than a competitive process

[48:37] might yield.

[48:38] Like if you're in an auction, you will pay more than if you're just making a 101 deal,

[48:41] which is why when you sell a house, you're like, I hope a lot of people bid.

[48:44] That's really good if you're a seller, really bad if you're a buyer.

[48:47] And so you want to have deals that you can just be the only person bidding on it.

[48:50] So that's the thing.

[48:51] So, for example, what that looks like is for acquisition.com, it'd be businesses that are

[48:56] applying on the side of the acquisition.com saying, yes, I'd be interested in selling a business

[49:00] right.

[49:01] Like you guys to help me help invest in the business, help it scale.

[49:04] That's what that would be.

[49:05] Now, the reason that it's proprietary is they're not typically going to other people.

[49:08] They're not saying, I want investment.

[49:10] I'm going to pick acquisition.com of 10 people.

[49:12] They're saying, I want to work with Alex and his team, right?

[49:15] Because of their proven drug record.

[49:18] The second thing that you want, in my opinion, as investment thesis is some sort of edge.

[49:22] You want some sort of insider knowledge, not insider trading to be clear.

[49:26] Insider knowledge on the industry or prospect that a company serves.

[49:30] And so you will find that there are some private equity firms, for example, that just

[49:34] specialize in manufacturing.

[49:36] They're just really good in heavy manufacturing businesses.

[49:38] Some private equity firms are really good at CPGs.

[49:42] So consumer package goods, direct to consumer, physical products, e-commerce.

[49:47] There's whole fields of great private equity firms around that.

[49:50] And they typically have founders or ex-founders who funded that with their own exits.

[49:54] And then basically redo the playbook with more leverage.

[49:57] There are some funds that just specialize in software, right?

[50:00] There are some funds that just specialize in professional services.

[50:03] There are some funds that just specialize in media.

[50:05] And so you want both proprietary Delflo, so that you have deals that no one else has

[50:09] to do.

[50:10] These are off market deals, right?

[50:11] That they only want to do business with you, so you can get better, more attractive prices

[50:14] in terms.

[50:15] And then you want to have a way to accelerate value.

[50:19] So if you want to think about investing is a business, right?

[50:23] We have LTV to CAC2.

[50:25] These things are not.

[50:27] These things completely apply to investing business.

[50:30] So the CAC is, if I proprietary Delflo, then I'm going to be able to acquire customers

[50:35] or acquire deals for lower prices on unbetter terms.

[50:39] And if I have a way to grow those businesses, then I will have higher lifetime deal value,

[50:44] then somebody who doesn't.

[50:46] And so when you combine those two things, you get better returns.

[50:49] So you have more value on the buy and more ex-evaluate on the sale.

[50:53] And that discrepancy is what creates the outsized alpha, which beats the market.

[50:58] And so fundamentally, this is what this has been my thesis for acquisition.com.

[51:02] Now I haven't talked about this as much publicly, most of because it applies to fewer

[51:04] people than the vast majority of my content.

[51:06] But our team decided, you know what?

[51:09] Let's talk about what we do.

[51:11] And so within the private investing world, the fund world, there's typically kind of two big

[51:16] buckets.

[51:17] You've got private equity, which means that they are buying equities that are private

[51:22] or off market, which is about a 60 or 70 year old industry.

[51:26] And then you've got VC or venture capital.

[51:33] And within venture capital, you have growth funds, you have seed stage funds, you have

[51:37] series A, series B, and these will typically be defined by their check size.

[51:44] Now, an interesting tidbit for you is I was talking to David Weisbert who runs 10x capital,

[51:49] unafiliated with Cardone.

[51:52] He just actually owns 10x capital, kind of funny.

[51:55] And they, he exclusively talks to LPs.

[51:59] So big endowments that have many, many, many, many, many billions of dollars, and that's

[52:03] like his entire network.

[52:04] Good podcast if you want to check it out if you're like really like high level investing.

[52:09] And so they did a meta study and they found out that VC or venture capital assets, so

[52:15] think a software company in general, have the highest return of any asset class.

[52:21] So they average about 14% per year, which is the second highest one is REITS.

[52:25] So real estate investment trusts.

[52:27] I think average is like about 12% a year.

[52:29] And then you've got the public's security, so normal stocks is something like 9 in

[52:33] change.

[52:34] They can go down the gamut of different asset classes.

[52:38] Now why do you?

[52:39] This is just the class of assets, not just a specific stock.

[52:42] Obviously, in every one of those categories, there's some real estate buildings that have

[52:45] come 100x and there's probably no 100x.

[52:47] But you have going up a lot.

[52:48] There's software companies that have definitely 100x and even individual stocks that are

[52:52] not software that have also 100x, right?

[52:54] Tesla, for example.

[52:56] Most of these still follow that kind of two and 20 structure.

[53:00] There are some, like there's a famous one, that's 0 and 35.

[53:05] So like it's really about how you want to shift risk with the founders.

[53:09] Sorry, shift risk with your limited partners.

[53:12] To give you context, private equity tends to manage tends to manage bigger amounts of money.

[53:17] So if you look at Blackstone has about a trillion dollars of assets under management,

[53:22] a pollow has about 600 billion under management.

[53:26] KKR has 500 billion dollars under management.

[53:29] So much for some of the money.

[53:31] And there's a reason why private equity has created some of the wealthiest people in

[53:36] the world.

[53:37] The fund managers of these groups are all deck of, deck of billionaires and above.

[53:41] Stephen Schwartzman, I think, is a 48-spillion just an absurd amount of money.

[53:46] And they do that because of all the leverage that I explained earlier.

[53:49] And that venture capital tends to, not always, but tends to.

[53:53] So if you have like A16Z, which is Andreason Horowitz, has about $50 billion under management.

[53:57] Sequoia, one of the most well-known funds in the world, has about $56 billion.

[54:02] So they're about the same in terms of size.

[54:04] So you can notice there's an order of magnitude difference in terms of the size.

[54:07] But they're usually making bets on what the next Facebook is going to be, whereas these guys

[54:12] tend to buy more traditional businesses that are already monstrous.

[54:15] And they do a little bit more of the financial arbitrage.

[54:17] Meaning it's more about how they can buy it.

[54:20] One price sell to another price or combine assets in a way that makes it a credeves.

[54:23] So the fancy word for just value additive to the overall enterprise value.

[54:26] Whereas these guys tend to do zero mergers and acquisitions and bet on the organic or viral

[54:32] growth of the companies that they take shares in.

[54:34] And so these guys typically focus on an organic growth.

[54:39] And these guys focus on organic growth, meaning the company itself grows.

[54:43] And these tend to grow by lobbying in multiple things together to make the overall entity

[54:47] bigger.

[54:48] And so that's where like for example, if I were to buy an auto repair shop, I might be able

[54:52] to buy the auto repair shop at a five times multiple and then get debt for half of that.

[54:58] So I put two and a half times their income into the deal and then buy five other ones

[55:04] with that.

[55:05] And then altogether sell them for ten.

[55:07] And I can triple my money in that period of time without actually having grown any

[55:11] of the companies.

[55:13] That's where it gets wild.

[55:15] Now, in this game, all they want to do is see this company just keep hockey sticking.

[55:20] Now if you're like, okay, where does acquisition dot com sit within this world?

[55:24] So we kind of sit in the middle.

[55:27] So obviously we have HQ ventures which is just traditional VC, but our actual private equity

[55:31] side, we do little M&A.

[55:35] Like we do if it makes sense.

[55:37] And typically it's because it's like an adjacent purchase of a business that we're referring

[55:41] a lot of business over to and it makes sense for us to just kind of bring them in.

[55:45] More than we're like actively seeking out 10 following investments to glob together.

[55:49] So we do less financial arbitrage and more value ad in terms of our ability to help business

[55:54] to scale.

[55:55] And for us that's less capital intensive and I would rather this is me personally.

[56:00] It's I would rather allocate my teams effort to growing something we're going to because

[56:04] is the most efficient form of growth in terms of fraternal capital.

[56:10] Not the easiest necessarily, but it's the most efficient.

[56:12] So if you can do it, you do that, but most people can't do it.

[56:16] And so they just do fine at arbitrage.

[56:17] But there's nothing wrong with it.

[56:18] It's just a different way to play with you.

[56:19] And so private equity for example will have traditionally somewhere in the neighborhood between

[56:23] 5 and 10 investments for a fund.

[56:26] So if you have a $500 million fund, you're going to have 5 to 10 investments.

[56:30] And so the fund size will typically dictate the size of the investment or check that they're

[56:34] going to be writing.

[56:36] If you're capital and many times they have multiple funds within one kind of fund company

[56:42] that will be dark ones for seed companies, once for series A's, once for growth equity.

[56:46] So it just depends on what stage of growth they're investing in.

[56:51] But these companies can sometimes have 50 to 100 investments per fund.

[56:56] And so because of that, they are significantly more hands off and more betting on the

[57:00] few that go big, knowing that they're going to have 99 losers and one Facebook that's

[57:04] going to make up for the whole fund.

[57:07] Here you really can't afford to lose very much.

[57:10] So here they're looking for the very consistent tripals and quadruples and 5X's.

[57:15] Here they're looking for 100 or 1000X and then a bunch of losers.

[57:18] They're not obviously looking for losers.

[57:20] They're hoping for more winners.

[57:22] But fundamentally that is the difference in terms of the investment thesis.

[57:25] And so if you are accepting a venture check, you have to understand that those are the odds

[57:29] that they are playing within that they're betting with on you that you, like the thing

[57:34] is that for them you are a 1% bet, for you you're a 100% bet.

[57:39] And so for the investors, they can distribute their outcome and diversify which decreases

[57:45] their risk, but also decreases their upside.

[57:47] And if you happen to be Mark Zuckerberg, then you will make more than everyone else who

[57:50] invested in you.

[57:52] But you got to be Mark Zuckerberg.

[57:53] So if we think about the cac of acquiring deals, the same advertising laws always apply.

[58:00] And so you're going to have, so you're going to have four ways that you can get customers

[58:08] and then four other ways where you can leverage other people to get your customers.

[58:12] And so if you look at acquises and not come, if we find a company that we think is interesting,

[58:16] we'll reach out to them.

[58:17] I post content like this video to generate deal flow to get people to pay attention to what

[58:22] we're doing and show interest in or stuff.

[58:24] We run paid ads for the same reason.

[58:27] Now if I were a traditional private equity firm, I would probably have affiliates or agencies.

[58:33] So these agencies basically function as brokers, right, who will take a percentage of the deal,

[58:40] or there are kind of outbound agencies that do this work to kind of like bird dog deals.

[58:46] They go and chase that.

[58:47] They do a lot of this outbound stuff on behalf of a private equity firm.

[58:50] They do a two-generate deal flow for them.

[58:52] And so in all of the traditional advertising laws apply,

[58:57] it's just that customers are now deals and products are now companies.

[59:01] And all you're doing is adding zero to your transactions.

[59:04] And so APG to be clear used other people's money.

[59:08] So they used, you know, it endowments from big universities like Harvard and Yale and, you know,

[59:13] the teachers fund to basically seed their investment.

[59:17] And they pull all of those funds to then make the five or ten investments they're going to make.

[59:21] And ultimately get a good return on it.

[59:23] But it was other people's money and other people's businesses.

[59:27] And so for that, they didn't even have to start any of these companies.

[59:31] And they were still able to make more money than most founders do on their exits.

[59:34] So APG bought my company, other people's businesses, using other people's money, like the teachers

[59:41] and downments, the police fund, the fireman fund, the Yale, Princeton, Harvard, the endowments

[59:48] that they have, they have these massive, war chests of money that they give to these fund managers

[59:53] as a small allocation of their overall investment for their university or for their investees,

[60:01] if you will, to get a return.

[60:04] And so the key point that I think is very interesting here is that the fund manager of a fund

[60:10] like this will often make more money than any of the founders of the businesses that they buy.

[60:16] And so when I saw that, I was like, oh, this is a very high leverage vehicle.

[60:21] And so this is what kind of kicked off my journey to thinking through what are all the ways

[60:26] to make a money.

[60:28] And that was the point of this video.

[60:29] And if you liked this video and want to take any of these four paths to make a money

[60:33] and you want to compress the timeline that you achieve it in, the number one video on my

[60:37] channel talks about exactly how to do it.

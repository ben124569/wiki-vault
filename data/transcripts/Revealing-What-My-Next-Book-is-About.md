[00:00] Business is hard, but you can make it easy if you have the right cheat codes.

[00:04] So it's something called a money model.

[00:05] And they are responsible for the vast majority of my materials success.

[00:09] And I'm launching it live August 16th to go that sounds like a pretty big promise.

[00:12] And we tell you a little bit more about the book overall.

[00:14] So what is a money model?

[00:16] So a money model is a series of offers deliberately structured,

[00:19] generate the most upfront cash that's this guy.

[00:22] Get the most leads together and get the highest lifetime value,

[00:26] which you generate by getting people to buy again and again and again.

[00:28] And we purposely also accelerate this cash flow so that we can get them to buy in less time.

[00:33] And by doing that, we can outspend our competition and future proof of the business.

[00:37] Because the one thing that I can absolutely guarantee that will not change in the history of mankind

[00:41] is that the cost of advertising will only go one way, which is up.

[00:45] How is it that some businesses can be a hundred plus years old?

[00:48] And other businesses struggle in their first year,

[00:50] despite the ones that are brand new, starting in this digital age,

[00:53] whereas these ancient businesses are still able to outcompete.

[00:56] The difference is a money model.

[00:58] That's how you see companies like JP Morgan, that's how you see companies like Northwestern Mutuals.

[01:02] Some of these companies that are hundred plus years old, GE,

[01:05] that have existed and been able to continue to exist,

[01:08] not because they're hopping on some influencer trend or because they have the latest trending hashtag

[01:11] or they've got meme music in the background,

[01:13] but because they have a stronger money model.

[01:15] So money models are sequenced as that one combined are so profitable,

[01:18] they're responsible for the vast majority of my material success.

[01:21] Like nothing else comes close.

[01:22] And to put this in context,

[01:23] I have not talked about the concepts in this book publicly.

[01:27] And I started writing this in 2021,

[01:29] and I have saved every single concept from this book,

[01:32] just for now and for the live launch.

[01:34] So let me put this in context.

[01:36] Most businesses have it completely backwards, right?

[01:39] They spend money to get customers and then they hope to make it back over time.

[01:42] That's what makes business so hard.

[01:44] That's playing on hard mode.

[01:45] Money models is flipping that.

[01:47] You make more money getting a customer than it cost you to get them within the first 30 days.

[01:51] That's the cheat code.

[01:53] So let me give you an example with this one's second action.

[01:55] When I started my gym, you know,

[01:56] obviously things started slowly,

[01:57] but then I started running ads and things started improving.

[01:59] Now, that worked for a minute until my ads became to expensive.

[02:04] The algorithm changed overnight,

[02:06] which happens over and over again throughout, you know, time.

[02:08] And all of a sudden,

[02:09] my cost of getting a customer went from like $100 to like $500.

[02:12] And I'm using these as placeholders,

[02:13] but just say they went from I could afford it to not afford it.

[02:15] You can do the math here.

[02:16] If I charge a $99 membership,

[02:18] which I did at the time,

[02:19] and I'm spending $500 to get them,

[02:21] I'm literally paying $400 out of pocket for the privilege of having a customer

[02:24] that I hope will someday make me money later.

[02:26] Now, if that person stays for,

[02:27] call it 10 months,

[02:28] then I pay $500 to make a thousand.

[02:30] Kind of tough because it's still of other costs that I have to make out of that 500,

[02:33] but like, maybe 10able,

[02:34] but not realistically 10able,

[02:35] because that means that I have to be negative for five months before I make my first dollar profit,

[02:39] which means I have to front money that I might not have,

[02:41] which is the situation that most business owners find themselves in.

[02:43] Option one is either just burn through your savings in prey.

[02:46] Option two is you take on debt and then just give away,

[02:49] you know, your future essentially.

[02:50] Or number three is that you take on cash from investors,

[02:54] you raise money,

[02:55] then you sell your equity,

[02:57] which you may or may not want to do,

[02:58] or you just eventually go broke and close the doors, right?

[03:01] This is kind of what I was facing at this moment.

[03:03] I was flying home for the holidays,

[03:05] and this is before I stopped flying over the holidays,

[03:07] and I was at the airport and a guy that I knew in college came up to me.

[03:11] He was like,

[03:11] oh, you know,

[03:12] how things going?

[03:13] I was like, oh, I started a business.

[03:13] He was like, oh, well,

[03:14] I have two locations.

[03:15] I was like,

[03:15] so what's the business?

[03:16] He was like,

[03:16] oh,

[03:16] I have a supplement store.

[03:17] I was like,

[03:18] okay,

[03:18] how much you make it out of the stores?

[03:20] And he said,

[03:20] I'm making 80 grand and 130 grand a month

[03:23] between, you know, in each one.

[03:24] And mind you, again,

[03:26] I didn't ask him for bank statements,

[03:28] but that's what he said.

[03:29] And I was like,

[03:29] holy,

[03:30] like 80 grand a month.

[03:32] And I was like,

[03:32] if he can do that,

[03:33] just selling supplements,

[03:34] I was like,

[03:34] and he doesn't have members.

[03:35] I was like,

[03:36] I've got members at my gym.

[03:37] I'm sure I could get at least a quarter of that,

[03:39] if I tried,

[03:41] I then,

[03:42] you know, bought a bunch of supplements.

[03:43] I couldn't figure out how to get them to,

[03:45] to actually buy.

[03:46] But eventually I was able to figure out

[03:48] how to get them to buy.

[03:49] Once I did,

[03:50] that took my person walking in the door,

[03:53] and then I was able to get them to buy

[03:54] a few hundred dollars in supplements

[03:56] in the first 48 hours.

[03:58] And then after that point,

[03:59] all of a sudden,

[04:00] I could afford to run ads again.

[04:01] That very small change,

[04:03] I've just saying,

[04:03] oh,

[04:04] I'm just going to sell them supplements

[04:05] after they come to my gym.

[04:07] That change fundamentally changed the economics

[04:09] of my business.

[04:10] It changed my money model.

[04:12] And as a result,

[04:13] I was able to now spend more

[04:14] than my competitors who were at that time,

[04:17] only spending enough to,

[04:18] just get enough lead.

[04:19] They burn through their marketing budget.

[04:21] And then they age away to the next month

[04:22] to reload up on customers.

[04:24] And this is what allowed me to continue to expand

[04:26] and expand until the point that I open up new locations

[04:29] over and over again,

[04:29] because it made me money to open locations,

[04:32] which makes absolutely no sense.

[04:34] But if you have a money model,

[04:36] if you have a way of getting customers to pay you,

[04:39] more than it costs to get them up front,

[04:42] then figuratively,

[04:43] you unlock your ability to get more customers.

[04:45] Now, you're going to have other constraints in the business.

[04:47] I had four walls.

[04:48] I had to get trainers.

[04:49] I had other operational issues.

[04:51] But getting customers and more succinctly,

[04:54] the cash required to get more customers

[04:56] no longer was a constraint,

[04:57] because if every customer comes pre-loaded within them,

[05:00] the cost of getting them,

[05:01] the cost of delivering for them,

[05:03] and the cost of getting the next customer,

[05:05] plus the cost of delivering for the next customer,

[05:07] when you have all four of those

[05:08] promoted in one in gross profit,

[05:11] you can spend as much as you want.

[05:13] The only thing worse than letting fake money on fire

[05:14] is letting real money on fire,

[05:16] which business owners do every single day,

[05:17] when they try to get customers,

[05:19] and the cost of getting customers,

[05:20] costs them more than the customers make them.

[05:22] And fundamentally, if you do that for long enough,

[05:24] you go out of business.

[05:25] And so it is the biggest threat to businesses every single day.

[05:27] But there is a better way.

[05:28] And the way you do that is with a money model,

[05:30] because money models,

[05:31] so you get more customers to spend more money

[05:33] in less time over and over again.

[05:34] And I'm going to be showing you how to do this live

[05:36] at my money models launch.

[05:37] So click, register, and I'll see you there.

[05:42] The next ask question is like,

[05:43] well, so how does this actually work

[05:44] with can't-aclity get customers?

[05:45] In the book, after I looked at all of the different businesses

[05:48] that I've had over my career,

[05:49] I realized that I could basically buck it

[05:51] at the little bit of sequence of offers

[05:53] into four buckets that meet four different objectives.

[05:55] And when you combine all four,

[05:56] you maximize the likelihood that you generate

[05:58] the most cash flow from most customers

[05:59] in the shortest period of time.

[06:00] So number one is you have attraction offers.

[06:02] So these are offers that maximize the likelihood of conversion.

[06:05] So think about getting the most leads to buy something.

[06:07] And these ones tend to,

[06:08] often have, when I would consider upfront cash components.

[06:11] So things that pull cash flow forward.

[06:13] The next is upsells.

[06:15] Which is, okay, now that we've maximized the number

[06:17] of customers that are walking the door,

[06:18] how can we maximize the gross profit per customer?

[06:21] So this is the getting them to spend more money part.

[06:23] After that, we have the downsell component.

[06:26] We have customers who come in and aren't willing to pay

[06:28] for the most expensive thing,

[06:29] but they may be willing to buy something.

[06:30] And so by doing that, we turn nose into yeses.

[06:33] Now the key part is that downsels are very risky

[06:35] if you don't know how to do them properly.

[06:37] If you do them the wrong way, what ends up happening is you take

[06:39] all your customers that were otherwise going to pay

[06:40] a firm or expensive thing and then they just buy a cheaper thing.

[06:42] That's bad.

[06:43] So we want to present the offer in such a way

[06:47] that we get all the people we're going to buy the first thing

[06:49] that was the most expensive and then also capture

[06:52] additional sales from customers who otherwise would have said no.

[06:55] I'll walk through that in a second in terms of more details.

[06:58] The fourth element is continuity.

[07:00] Because if you just got a bunch of cash upfront from people

[07:02] and you upsell them downsell,

[07:03] well then what do you have after that?

[07:04] Well, you have a one time transaction.

[07:06] We don't get customers to make sales.

[07:09] We make sales to get customers.

[07:10] And the point there is we create a relation with the customer

[07:12] that increases the likelihood of the continued purchase from us again

[07:14] and again.

[07:15] There are offer structures that each of these objective points

[07:18] that increase the likelihood that that objective occurs.

[07:20] We would have an offer that gets people in the door.

[07:22] We would have offered that gets them to spend more money.

[07:24] We would have offered that captures the other part of people

[07:26] who weren't originally going to say yes.

[07:28] And then we want them to have something that gets them to buy over and over again.

[07:31] If we have those things, we have a model that can outspend our

[07:34] competition, at least in the most basic way,

[07:36] outspend the cost of getting customers.

[07:38] If we think about what is required for a business to exist,

[07:41] you have to have cash.

[07:42] That's literally it.

[07:43] Like you could have nothing else, but as long as you can pay your bills,

[07:45] as long as you can pay payroll, as long as you can pay the incorporation

[07:48] fee every year to maintain a business, you are still in business.

[07:51] Your ego might be bruised.

[07:52] You might have lower revenue.

[07:53] You might not be hitting the goals you want,

[07:55] but you are still in business.

[07:57] If you have a money model that increases the cash loan to business and pulls it forward,

[08:01] then by doing that, you have a way that you can stay alive.

[08:04] And what I have found from all the people that I've known in my life and I would say

[08:07] myself included is that business is in endurance game.

[08:10] It's a marathon.

[08:11] It's about staying alive and outlasting.

[08:13] And the way that you at last is you continue to have ways to generate cash for the business.

[08:16] So I'm going to walk you through the model that broke the gym industry.

[08:20] So when I got into the gym game,

[08:22] what people ran was something called an LBU, which is not a leverage buyout,

[08:25] but they called it that because there's a low barrier offer.

[08:28] And so this is what those gyms did at the time.

[08:31] So they would run a $21, $21 day promotion.

[08:34] So that was their front and offer.

[08:36] That was their attraction offer.

[08:38] Now, is that a good attraction offer?

[08:40] Not by my standards, but it wasn't attraction offer for me.

[08:43] This would probably be a down-solve.

[08:44] But for them, this is what they were running on the front end.

[08:46] And what's really interesting about all the offer structures that I mentioned in the money models book,

[08:50] which you'll soon learn about, is that all of those offers can be used anywhere.

[08:53] But I tend to bucket them in this way because I think they better satisfy this specific objective.

[08:58] Back to the story, they were running $21, $21 day promotions.

[09:01] And this is back when people could in a local market convert maybe 25,

[09:05] even 30% of leads.

[09:07] Lee quality is going down on those platforms.

[09:08] But let's just walk through it with like really bull-case scenario, the best case scenario.

[09:14] So they're closing one out of four leads.

[09:16] So let's say they get 100 leads, which would cost them.

[09:19] Let's say that their lead cost was 20 bucks.

[09:21] All right, so it's going to cost them $2,000 to get 100 leads.

[09:25] Okay, fine.

[09:26] Now, they're going to convert 25% of these leads.

[09:29] And their price point is going to be $21.

[09:32] Which means that they're going to make $500 and $25.

[09:36] Well, that's in the first 21 days.

[09:39] Now, of these 25, what percentage of these people are going to convert to continuity?

[09:43] This guy, the membership.

[09:45] Well, the industry average for these types of trials is 35%.

[09:49] So let's just call it a third and say, 8 of those people are going to convert

[09:53] and let's say that their price point is $99.

[09:56] All right, so now they have another $800 here.

[10:00] Okay, fine.

[10:01] Now, the average stay of a customer that's at $99 a month is going to be usually,

[10:06] and this is kind of sad, some of the effort like fiveish months for the industry average.

[10:10] It's much lower than you think it is.

[10:12] And so that means that they've got another $4,000 that's going to come in off of these eight people.

[10:18] So all we have to do is add this up.

[10:19] So they got 525, they got 800 at the conversion, and then they got 5 more months.

[10:23] And they're actually technically even the 6, but let's just let's give it to them.

[10:26] That means they were at 4800 plus that, we're at 5325.

[10:31] Now, if they spent $2,000 to make that, it's okay.

[10:35] You know, they made some money, but they still have rent, they have admin, they have trainers,

[10:40] they have other stuff that they have to get fact into this.

[10:42] I'm not even taking into account gross property or which is a huge factor.

[10:45] All right, but let's just leave it at these numbers.

[10:47] That's okay.

[10:48] You can kind of compete.

[10:49] You'll live, but you're probably not going to make much.

[10:52] And so this is what I did in the gym industry, and this is what changed the game.

[10:55] I'll put this little number here.

[10:57] So we're, we had 100 leads, right?

[10:59] Well, we made 5325, which means the maximum amount of money that we could spend, right?

[11:04] From these would be 53 dollars per lead.

[11:06] Now, you couldn't actually realistically spend that money because you have every other

[11:09] cost in the business you have to spend and you'd be losing money.

[11:12] Let's just use that as a hypothetical.

[11:13] And again, I'm just trying to bolster this scenario.

[11:15] Now, what we did was this.

[11:18] Someone would come in and we ran a free six week challenge, or a six week challenge, 42 day

[11:22] detox, 42 day transformation, tons of different rappers.

[11:25] Basically, six week thing.

[11:26] All right.

[11:27] And so let's say we got our same 100 leads.

[11:29] Now our 100 leads, especially if we had a free offer on the front end, would be usually

[11:33] about half the cost.

[11:34] And so that means that let's say we were spending, you know, they spent 20 bucks a lead.

[11:38] We'd spend 10.

[11:39] Now I'm going to, again, I'm going to make this the worst case scenario for this one.

[11:43] So let's say we spent 20.

[11:45] We spent the same amount for these leads, even though we wouldn't.

[11:47] Let's just say we did.

[11:48] So we spent the same $2,000 to get these leads.

[11:50] Great.

[11:51] All right.

[11:52] These are our leads.

[11:53] Let's say we convert even less of these leads.

[11:55] All right.

[11:56] Let's say that we're going to convert 15% of these leads.

[11:58] So we're going to get 15, 15 sales.

[12:00] Now, important point.

[12:03] I had the perspective that when someone signs up for something like a gym, their highest point

[12:08] of motivation is the moment they walk in the door.

[12:10] That is when they're the most deprived of the outcome.

[12:12] They're so impain that they booked a, you know, they booked it at a point.

[12:16] They clicked a lead, they opted in, they responded to a phone call, they dropped their car,

[12:20] they drove all the way there.

[12:21] They're ready to change.

[12:23] That is the point that I'm not trying to sell someone for 20 bucks.

[12:25] I'm trying to sell them something for $500.

[12:28] The point of greatest paint, now maybe it's $5,000, but at this point of my career, you know,

[12:32] $5,000 wasn't in my Lexicon.

[12:33] So 500 was high ticket.

[12:35] All right.

[12:36] I'd have 15 people that would come in and I'd sell them for $5,600.

[12:39] All right.

[12:40] So let's just use 500 as simple math.

[12:42] So we would make $7,500.

[12:43] Now mind you, this is upfront.

[12:46] upfront.

[12:47] So that means that if I'm spending this money to get these customers in, I'm already positive.

[12:51] I still have my membership.

[12:52] I still have other things that I can sell at top of that.

[12:54] But remember here, we had to wait a month plus to get to this 5325.

[13:00] Here I'm getting a day one.

[13:03] But after that, I realized wait a second.

[13:05] All these 15 people, I bet you I could sell 12 of them on supplements.

[13:09] And so the average person there would spend about 200 bucks.

[13:12] So I'd make $2,400.

[13:14] Now gross profit on that.

[13:15] You actually have physical costs there.

[13:17] But I ran close to 80% gross profit on the products that I sold.

[13:21] That was roughly $2,000.

[13:24] And gross profit that I'd make from selling these 12 people.

[13:27] All right.

[13:28] Be like, okay, well then that's already $9,500 compared to the 53.

[13:33] And this is all within the first 48 hours, because I'd sell these people within the

[13:36] first two days or so.

[13:37] And you might be thinking, wait a second.

[13:38] I thought they just bought a gym membership.

[13:40] Why would you sell them supplements afterwards?

[13:42] Because people have different wallets.

[13:45] They have different needs that can get satisfied.

[13:47] And so just because you spend all your money on your membership doesn't mean you spend

[13:50] all of your supplement money.

[13:51] And once you spend all your supplement money, what else are you going to do?

[13:53] Well, you're going to have gym clothes, which is a different wallet.

[13:55] And then once you buy your gym clothes, what else are you going to buy?

[13:57] You probably have to get food that's going to be your new fitness food.

[14:00] Right?

[14:01] So all of these things have these different buckets that customers are willing to spend

[14:03] money on.

[14:04] And the business that's able to capture the the highest percentage of that money in the

[14:08] shortest period of time is the ones going to be able to outcompete and outspend.

[14:11] Now let's continue.

[14:13] So for me, remember this is a six week thing that I sold them on.

[14:16] But does that mean that I wake to the end of the six weeks to sell them something else

[14:18] after the supplements?

[14:19] Of course not.

[14:21] What would I do?

[14:22] What I would say, hey, we could take your $500 here.

[14:26] And if you want, we can credit it forward for the year.

[14:30] How's that sound?

[14:31] If you just choose to stay with us afterwards.

[14:33] Now in the first scenario, I've got no leverage, right?

[14:37] I can't say like, hey, you gave me $21.

[14:39] Well, you put that $20 towards your $99, who cares?

[14:42] But if I said, hey, I'm going to take your $500 and put it towards a year, that's real money.

[14:47] And so all of a sudden, I could get somewhere in the neighborhood around 70% of people.

[14:51] So double the percentage here to take the next offer.

[14:54] So I take my $15 originally and I've got about 10 who stay on the back end.

[14:59] Now at this point, because I learned a little bit more on pricing, is that a charging $99,

[15:03] I'd be charging $250 a month and then that would knock me down to about $200 per month

[15:09] for my larger training studio.

[15:11] Now that means that I've got $200 per month, which means $2,000 per month in recurring.

[15:16] Now let's assume that I had the same stick as them.

[15:18] Let's just assume that.

[15:20] Well, now I've got $10,000 here in total because it's time's five, five months.

[15:25] So I got 10 grand here.

[15:26] But wait a second, do you think there's anything else we could do?

[15:29] Great idea.

[15:30] I said I had six weeks, right?

[15:31] And I got a percentage of these people to say, hey, I'm going to continue on and credit my money.

[15:35] Fine.

[15:36] What happens at week six here?

[15:38] Well, I would still weigh them out from there from their promotion that I had.

[15:41] But what else would I do?

[15:42] I'd say, hey, you're already committed for the year.

[15:44] If you want, we can save you another 10% if you just prepaid a day.

[15:48] I saved you 500 on the first one.

[15:49] I'm going to save you another 200 or 400 if you take 10 or 20% off.

[15:53] Why not?

[15:54] And I would get somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 to 30% ish, not a promise, not a guarantee

[16:00] that if you do, this is what's going to happen.

[16:01] I'm just giving you a rough estimate.

[16:04] And so that means I'm going to get two or three people, which kind of fact, I'll say,

[16:06] in my experience, it's like 20-ish percent of customers, or one out of five, will buy something

[16:11] that's significant more expensive.

[16:12] So customers tend to be fractal, 80-20.

[16:15] And so here, I would get somebody to then spend, call it $2,000.

[16:20] And so I'd make, let's just call this $5,000.

[16:22] We can take the average here, $5,000 extra.

[16:25] Now let's add up the difference here.

[16:28] My competitors could spend up to $50 a lead.

[16:31] That was very important.

[16:32] Right, 53 bucks a lead is what they were able to spend.

[16:34] But if we're adding ours up, I'm going to get 7500, 2,000, 9500, 10,000, now 19,500.

[16:42] Plus $5, so I've got 24,500 that I'm making from the same 100 leads.

[16:50] Remember, which means that my ability to spend is that I can spend $245 per lead at max here.

[16:58] Obviously, I have other costs to set up.

[16:59] But I just want to make the math example simple.

[17:01] Compared to my competitor, who could only spend $53 per lead.

[17:05] 5x.

[17:07] Not like 20% more, or 50% more.

[17:09] But five times more.

[17:11] And all of this money, and this is where it got weird.

[17:14] All of this money minus this 5k was in the first 30 days.

[17:18] Which means that if I spent money on ads, and I put it on a credit card, and I was able

[17:22] to make 19,500, after I originally just put $2,000 in, I'm getting $8.

[17:28] $9 back for every dollar I put in.

[17:32] And I still have the lead.

[17:33] I still have the customers.

[17:34] I can still sell them lean by Halloween and slim for Santa.

[17:38] And I can still sell them to send my private training.

[17:40] And I can still sell them other stuff, more supplements, right, throughout the rest of the

[17:44] relationship with the customer.

[17:46] And when you do this, now let's think about why this is important, why bring up money

[17:50] models.

[17:51] The guys that I was competing against, functionally sold the same product as me.

[17:54] Maybe my trainers are better, maybe my location is a little bit better.

[17:57] But fundamentally, they had trainers, they had access to the same talent, pull I did locally.

[18:01] They had to pay their trainers probably roughly what I was paying my trainers.

[18:04] And so how was it that I could outcompete them so clearly at a better money model?

[18:10] And so right now there's probably a version of your business that can generate $5, 10,

[18:14] 15 times more than somebody who's in identical spaces you.

[18:17] And I want to push on this because a lot of business owners have very limiting beliefs.

[18:21] And saying like, I don't think I could charge them much.

[18:23] I can't, I couldn't ask them when they buy supplements two days after they bought, after

[18:27] they bought a membership.

[18:28] Why not?

[18:29] They're going to buy them either way.

[18:30] But as well as buying them from you.

[18:31] But they didn't finish the six weeks or they didn't finish the trial.

[18:34] Why would I ask them to buy something else?

[18:36] Because they've had a good experience up at this point.

[18:38] Would you make an offer so good they can't refuse?

[18:40] Key point here is it's a deliberate sequence of offers that's structured to generate

[18:45] as much cash upfront as you can really possible and maximize the likelihood of conversion

[18:50] into continuity or reoccurring.

[18:53] And if you could accomplish that and for each of these elements there's multiple, so

[18:57] like let's walk through some of the examples here, their money model.

[18:59] Call it a free trial almost, but a low ticket front end offer that was basically a paid trial

[19:05] functionally.

[19:07] And then they just had a continuity offer on the back end, which was $9 and $9 a month,

[19:11] but there was no mechanic.

[19:13] There's no, there's no lubricant there.

[19:15] It's just hey, you bought this thing, you're the end of your trial, do you want to buy the

[19:18] next thing?

[19:19] What's crazy is that this is how a lot of businesses run.

[19:22] But the thing is that wouldn't it be more compelling if we said hey, you want to take

[19:25] the $21 and put it towards something like that would be more compelling than just saying

[19:29] buy the next thing.

[19:30] So now let me show you the pieces that are involved in this one.

[19:34] So we had a, when you're money back as offer one, which is an attraction offer, which

[19:39] then rolled into a classic upsell, which is the supplement offer.

[19:44] You can't buy X without Y, which then rolled into a roll over upsell, which is how I took

[19:49] the cash that they had here and put it towards a membership, the third, which is an upsell

[19:55] offer combined with a continuity offer.

[19:58] And then I did a buy X to get Y, which was the paid and full discount by 10 months,

[20:04] get two months free as the offer at the end.

[20:07] Now, our all of these continuity offers will two of these are kind of, but the mechanics

[20:11] behind what make the offer compelling is the components of the money model.

[20:17] That lubrication, that reason why, that compelling thing that gets someone to say yes

[20:22] more likely than no, that is what can transform a business.

[20:26] And these are the tricks of the trade that people rarely share publicly.

[20:31] And it's because it's the engine, it's the machine.

[20:33] I've spent the last 13, 14 years documenting all the little things, the little nuances,

[20:39] the how I see this and the knackets them to say this.

[20:42] And if I present the price like this first and then I say this, then I get way more people

[20:45] to take it.

[20:47] Those mechanics are what create a money model.

[20:49] One here is something insane.

[20:51] My next book, $100 million money model is finally coming out.

[20:54] And here's something else in saying, every single person who shows up live to the book

[20:58] lunch event gets a secret project that I've been working on for over two years.

[21:02] And I can't say what it is, but it's less than a Bitcoin.

[21:05] And it's more than an NFT.

[21:06] And every single person who shows up gets one.

[21:10] What's that?

[21:11] Oh yeah.

[21:12] If you choose to period or copy the book, there's four amazing bonuses that you get.

[21:15] Absolutely free if you just choose to period it because a house might wear house team

[21:18] out.

[21:19] It would mean a lot to me.

[21:20] You don't have to do it because what's that?

[21:22] Oh yeah.

[21:23] You can show up for free.

[21:24] And so no obligation either way.

[21:25] I would love to see you there, but the free prizes are there only if you show up live.

[21:29] So click register and it's going to be awesome.

[21:34] And so where does money models fit within kind of the universe of the $100 million series?

[21:39] The first book, $100 million offers teaches how to create an offer so good people feel

[21:43] stupid saying no.

[21:44] Said differently, if you are selling a straight membership, you're going to lose compared

[21:48] to somebody who's selling a transformation.

[21:50] If you're selling cages, come get workouts versus hey, we're going to do a grocery store

[21:55] tour with you once a week to make sure that you know what's about.

[21:57] And on top of that, you're going to have an accountability coach who's going to check

[22:00] in with you every morning to make sure that you wait in and that you're attending your

[22:04] workout later.

[22:05] And on top of that, you're going to have a group of people who are just like you who are

[22:08] going alongside and we also have prizes for people who are winning.

[22:11] On top of that, we've got meals that we can order through us if you want that are already

[22:15] pre-approved.

[22:17] We also have these supplements that can help you feel better and make this feel less

[22:20] bad as you're doing it.

[22:21] You go through all the different potential issues that someone might have and we say,

[22:24] how do we flip all of the objections that someone has and make it into an offer?

[22:28] If you don't have an offer, there's nothing you can sell.

[22:30] You will sell a commodity.

[22:32] Memberships between two boot camps is the same thing.

[22:34] But if we have a transformation, now all of a sudden we have more stuff that's going to be

[22:38] more compelling and more differentiated, which will then allow us to commit a higher price.

[22:43] I had to start there because if you don't have an offer to sell, there's nothing I can

[22:45] do.

[22:46] These leads.

[22:47] So once you have the offer, I got the thing I'm going to sell, I've got my transformation,

[22:52] whatever your transformation is.

[22:55] How am I to let people know about it?

[22:56] Leeds shows you how to advertise.

[22:57] How to get leads, how to get customers, which is either you're going to have some sort

[23:02] of content that you're making, your post and stuff.

[23:04] You're going to have some sort of outreach that you do, which is you DM you call call,

[23:08] you're emailing.

[23:10] You have some sort of advertisements that are paid that you run and you can do those

[23:16] to get customers to send you referrals.

[23:18] You can do those to get affiliates who also send you customers as well.

[23:22] So there's the different sources that you're going to get.

[23:23] I can go to more details, but that is the gist of $100 leads.

[23:28] So now you're like, I got a thing and I got to wait a lot of people know about it.

[23:31] Then the money model comes in is to connect all the dots.

[23:34] Is it puts, it runs the water through the funnel, through the pipeline.

[23:38] The idea is we put the advertising on this side and money comes out the other side.

[23:43] So it teaches you how to get more customers to pay more money faster over and over again

[23:48] with all four types of offer structures that when you design a good money model, you're

[23:53] going to use multiple.

[23:54] I told you, I just gave you four that I was using in this money model.

[23:58] By combining those Lego blocks and you're going to for your own business, mix and match,

[24:02] there's five attraction offers that I have in the book.

[24:04] It's like, okay, I'm going to use the attraction offer one here.

[24:07] I'm going to use upsell offer two here.

[24:09] I'm going to use attraction offer four here and I'm going to use downsell offer two and

[24:13] three here and then I'm going to use continuity offer four on the back.

[24:17] When you put that together, that is how you assemble the business.

[24:21] That is how you outspend everyone.

[24:22] That is how when Facebook ads become expensive, you don't care.

[24:26] And that's why that guy goes out of business and you stay in business and you keep going.

[24:30] Believe it or not, the offer's leads and money models books were actually all one book

[24:35] that I first started writing in 2021.

[24:38] It was called lead generation and monetization structures, very, very sexy title.

[24:42] I wrote it as a textbook because I thought I was an academic.

[24:46] I thought I was very fancy.

[24:47] When I wrote it though, the thing is that I had a couple of media sections in that I was

[24:50] like, man, this is like really, really dense.

[24:53] I feel like I have to unpack this.

[24:54] Believe it or not, the leads book actually was just one very long chapter in that book.

[24:59] And I was like, okay, I need to talk more about this.

[25:02] No one's going to be able to just take this chapter and then immediately use it.

[25:04] So I had to write the leads book.

[25:05] But then I was writing the leads book.

[25:06] I was like, well, shoot, none of these ads are going to work.

[25:09] None of these posting contents are going to work unless they have an offer.

[25:13] So then I'd appeal out the offer section, which was really the very beginning of the book

[25:16] just saying, hey, you got to have something compelling to sell that people don't price

[25:20] compare you on.

[25:21] Here's how you make an offer here.

[25:22] So you put it together.

[25:23] So here's the value equation.

[25:24] These all together are actually one system of acquisition.

[25:27] Now, to be clear, you can take just the leads book and advertise your stuff and you'll

[25:32] make more.

[25:33] More people find out about whatever it is yet.

[25:34] Even if you have just the most basic membership in the world, more people find out about

[25:37] it, you have more customers.

[25:39] If you only had a better offer, if you go from the membership to a six-week challenge,

[25:43] you're going to have a more compelling offer, more people will buy.

[25:45] Sometimes systems have multiple dependent components.

[25:48] So like for a car, if I don't have wheels, the car won't go.

[25:53] But if I have wheels and I don't have an engine, the car still won't go.

[25:56] On the other hand, if I have a pipeline of water that's going through a pipe, if I make

[26:01] one part thicker or thinner, I can still increase the throughput of the pipe overall.

[26:06] And so in this type of setup, all of these are additive.

[26:08] They're multiplicative.

[26:10] All of these things just make businesses better.

[26:12] Think of them as business enhancers, if you will.

[26:14] Sometimes you're only one crazy offer away.

[26:17] You're only one big advertising campaign away.

[26:20] Or you need the cash flow to support both of those things through having a superior money

[26:24] model.

[26:25] And so to be clear, you don't need to read offers or leads in order to use money models.

[26:28] But if you do, it'll be even better.

[26:31] But you don't need to.

[26:32] Just like if you don't read money models, you can just advertise more and your business

[26:35] will grow.

[26:36] The file of question might be like, what if I have a small business or a big business?

[26:38] Like how it work for me?

[26:39] Well, it doesn't matter what industry or size you're in.

[26:43] A money model is core to every business.

[26:45] The question is how good your is and how many different components you've implemented

[26:48] so that you can maximize each of those objectives.

[26:50] This is the most how to win it business, manual that I've ever made.

[26:54] And I truly believe that it will change people's businesses and lives more than anything

[26:59] I've ever released.

[27:00] And to be clear, Jim launch as a business was functionally structured on just having superior

[27:05] money model in two ways.

[27:08] I showed a superior money model for Jim's to run, which allowed them to advertise in more

[27:13] ways in more places more profitably get better talents so they could outcompete people

[27:18] in the area.

[27:19] But I also had a superior money model at the Jim launch level, my business that showed how

[27:24] this money model worked because other people were in that space trying to help Jim owners

[27:28] out whether they were marketing agencies or they were they sold courses or whatever,

[27:32] they sold at the same avatar, right?

[27:34] Equipment companies, all of these companies sold to the exact same avatar.

[27:37] If we think about it like this, you have a person that your business sells to.

[27:42] And this person is going to have, let's say it's the Jim owner.

[27:45] He's going to have equipment dealers who are trying to get his eyeballs.

[27:48] You're going to have supplement sellers who are going to try and get them to wholesale.

[27:51] You're going to have marketing agencies who are going to say, hey, you know, buy our services.

[27:57] You're going to have construction companies, which you're going to say, hey, do remodels

[28:00] for your Jim.

[28:01] You're going to have a payroll company that are trying to say, hey, use our apparel line

[28:04] to do it at your Jim.

[28:07] And so all of these people have to buy ads on the same person.

[28:12] All of them are buying advertising space for these eyeballs.

[28:18] In an auction of attention, the person who can outspend, let's say this one's the biggest,

[28:26] can have an ethical and legal monopoly of the attention of their prospect or their ideal

[28:31] avatar simply because of the economics of their business.

[28:34] They make more money on this person's eyeballs than all of these people.

[28:38] And so for all of the blank spaces on this person's newsfeed, this guy can put his barbell

[28:44] ads over and over again.

[28:46] And so what happens is that you can actually outspend and increase the CPMs in your marketplace

[28:51] such that no one else can compete.

[28:53] Hopefully you see the difference between a generic Jim that sells a membership.

[28:59] And this Jim model and the biggest one is how the money works, how the money flows, how

[29:05] quickly into whom.

[29:07] And when you have that, you can be this business that outspends the remainder of other

[29:13] businesses that compete for the same attention.

[29:15] And by doing that, you can win.

[29:17] This is an overview of the conceptual hierarchy of the ideas that are contained within the

[29:22] money model's book.

[29:23] These are the nitty-gritty tactics that only the pros know and that most people keep

[29:27] close to their chest.

[29:28] I always know that a book is good when I feel very insecure before I release it because

[29:32] I'm like, oh my god, these are all my secrets.

[29:35] What am I going to do?

[29:36] But I've learned enough times that the more money I make other people, the more money

[29:38] I end up making.

[29:39] If you're like, man, this sounds really interesting or the sounds really cool, then I

[29:43] am having the launch event of the season.

[29:45] I'm spending millions of dollars on the launch event just because I want to blow you

[29:48] guys away.

[29:49] You can register for the live launch event.

[29:51] It's August 16th.

[29:52] You can register for it now.

[29:53] It's registered.acq.com.

[29:55] What's beautiful about this is that the whole event's free.

[29:58] I've got five mystery speakers that are coming out, their headliners, and they've never

[30:02] shared the same stage before.

[30:03] And many of them don't speak publicly much at all.

[30:04] It's going to be awesome.

[30:05] But beyond that, I'm going to be showing you the concepts in this book in real time.

[30:09] And I'm going to be pulling them out.

[30:10] And you probably even heard some of these things that I said to Daniel, oh, I could use

[30:14] something like that.

[30:15] Well, imagine an entire book of those.

[30:17] And you'll be able to pre-order a book before the live launch event because it actually

[30:21] helped out.

[30:22] We're hosting a lot.

[30:23] And so to incentivize you, I've got four amazing bonuses that you can find out about when

[30:26] you go to the register.acq.com page.

[30:29] And I have a surprise gift that I have been saving for a while now that I've been working

[30:36] on for more than one year, multiple years, and anticipation of this event that I will be

[30:42] releasing live at the launch.

[30:45] And every single person who shows up live will get one.

[30:48] And I can't say what it is yet.

[30:49] But I can tell you that it's better than an NFT, and it's less than a Bitcoin, and every

[30:53] single person will get one.

[30:54] But you got to be their life.

[30:55] All right.

[30:56] So it's registered.acq.com.

[30:57] Over the next four weeks, I'm going to be revealing one model per week.

[31:01] And so I'll see you next week for the next Monday model.

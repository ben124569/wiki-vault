[00:00] In this video, I'm going to show you how we've structured our offer flow to ascend customers.

[00:05] All right. So if you're in a service business or a breaking order business or an online business,

[00:08] any type of business that sells service or coaching or whatever, of any kind of where you actually have to do something and provides a service to a customer.

[00:14] And you ultimately want to get that person to come back again and again, then you're going to want to listen to this video.

[00:18] So one of the things that I've been touted as, you know, as been mine is downsell your upsell.

[00:24] And that's because you know our current companies make just under $100 million a year.

[00:28] I'll leave it at that in the reason I make this channel is because lots of people are broken.

[00:31] I don't want you to be one of them. So if you're an entrepreneur right now, and you sell a service of some kind,

[00:36] it is standard and normal and to be expected that you just have a recurring fee of some sort and you sign people up and they go right into that fee.

[00:43] Here's why you're making mistake and this is why I've never done that model because I think it's horrible.

[00:47] But let me give you a couple reasons for that. So if you have a defined and program on the front end,

[00:53] what you'll be able to do is sell more easily because people don't want a membership or recurring service.

[00:57] They want an outcome. And so ideally what we're going to do is think about what is the outcome that our customer wants to experience?

[01:04] And then how can we sell that rather than a recurring membership service, et cetera, right?

[01:09] Some sort of continuity. And so the first thing we do is we pack is that as an upfront program,

[01:15] that sells the promise. Now when we do that, we're able to increase the price because it's a defined period of time.

[01:21] And because it has a promise that we're delivering on.

[01:22] So people will perceive it as more valuable than a recurring service.

[01:25] And because people are always willing to spend more one time than they are on a recurring basis because it's not a commitment for perpetuity.

[01:31] Right? So one, it's an easier sale.

[01:34] Number two is that you actually are able to acquire more customers this way because you have cash flow from this higher price point to spend more on marketing.

[01:43] So you can actually use this upfront program or whatever you do a thing as a way to cash flow your acquisition.

[01:49] So you can even break even on all of the money that you make on this because you want to eventually sell the continuity.

[01:54] But you use this sale first because it's easier to sell. It's more profitable, et cetera.

[01:58] The next thing is that if you raise the price on this front end defined period,

[02:01] it will actually anchor the value of your services in the mind of your prospect

[02:06] so that when you do sell your continuity it feels like a down sell.

[02:09] Even though you're actually selling a bigger ticket.

[02:11] All right, and so one of the beauties of this is that this is kind of this number three point goes into this.

[02:16] Which is that people will always notice the cash flow more than the price.

[02:21] So for example, if I say, hey, it's $18,000, someone will be, whoa, but if I say, hey, it's $1500 a month and it's like,

[02:28] oh, that's not so bad. Right? People will weigh the cash flow more than they will weigh the price.

[02:32] It's probably easier. It will guarantee this.

[02:36] It is easier and it will sell more people at $1500 a month than you would by $10,000 one time upfront.

[02:41] Right? And that's because people are more mindful of their cash flow than of the overarching price.

[02:46] And so we can use this high cash upfront service or define an program of some kind of

[02:52] ex-butes on a promise because it also feeds into our continuity more naturally because it's a down sell of the

[02:57] up sell. So we might sell this thing for $6,000 and this thing for $18,000, but this was six and this only

[03:02] feels like $1500 a month. So people will be like, oh, wow, this is a steal, especially if you actually

[03:08] give them more than what they currently just got for less. So I think about that. So it's like $6,000 for

[03:14] XYZ service and then you can now qualify to be XYZ WVSRT service after this and it's less.

[03:23] That is how you build continuity. Now the next one is onboarding costs. So the reason that I like

[03:28] the Assuffer and things is that we can also over deliver like crazy because it costs more to onboard

[03:32] in New customer. New customers require more attention. They require more effort. You have to get them up

[03:36] to speed at higher systems. You have to teach them how to be a customer. And so the way to do that

[03:40] and cover the cost, which most businesses just go negative for, I don't know if they're make money

[03:44] getting customers and get paid to onboard them and teach them how to be a customer for my business.

[03:49] All right, and then finally you'll actually get more committed customers because the more you raise

[03:54] the price, the more committed they will be executing it. And also if you can raise the quality of your

[03:58] prospects, you will raise the quality of your product. Let me say that again, if you raise the

[04:02] quality of your prospects, you raise the quality of your product. Because if I had an identical

[04:06] product, I did an identical service and I had a very able person go through it and a very unable

[04:09] person go through it or a disabled person go through it, the likelihood of achievement of the outcome

[04:13] for the high quality prospect is much higher. And so by raising the barrier, we increase the likelihood

[04:18] of achieving the outcome that we're shooting for, which means that by it's very nature, our service

[04:22] becomes more valuable. And so by raising the bar, we actually raise the quality of our deliverable,

[04:27] which is crazy and counterintuitive, but that's why most people don't make money. All right,

[04:31] so I'm going to bring this bring us home here. So right now, in your current service, if you sell

[04:35] some sort of continuity, I highly recommend you not do that. And instead, create the upfront program

[04:40] that creates customers. All right, this becomes the program that you sell in order to acquire

[04:45] customers because it's easier to sell because they understand it's the fine end. It will cover your

[04:48] cost of acquisition and probably profit from it. You will have a price anchor for your continuity

[04:53] that will make it more valuable and a perception of that more valuable. And you'll actually be

[04:57] able to raise the price on your continuity because the cash flow that continuity will be less

[05:00] than what they require to pay upfront. You'll be able to cover your onboarding cost and create an

[05:04] amazing customer experience so that you get them super up to speed, really believing that your

[05:09] business is amazing. You can deliver on the promises made. And then finally, you'll have more

[05:12] committed customers that are higher quality that will ultimately mean that you're providing more

[05:16] value to the marketplace and you will be rewarded by dollars in your pocket. And so if you found this

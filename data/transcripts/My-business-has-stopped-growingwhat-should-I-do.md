[00:00] Most of the nation, two days ago, I was speaking with some business owners that approached me

[00:04] about becoming portfolio companies in acquisition.com.

[00:07] And I want to talk to you about how that conversation went.

[00:09] And I want to give you one of the most useful frameworks that I use in analyzing a business

[00:12] that you can use today to analyze your own business and instantly two, three exit,

[00:17] which is exactly what I do when I'm looking at the portfolio companies that we're considering

[00:20] on investing in.

[00:22] The beautiful thing about this equation, and as you develop as an entrepreneur,

[00:25] at least as I have, and just so you, if you guys don't know who I am,

[00:27] it's Alcramozionacquisition.com.

[00:29] I'm profilio.com.

[00:30] I'm going to do about 85 million dollars a year.

[00:31] So the reason I make this channel is because a lot of people broken out and want you to be one of them.

[00:33] And Mose Nation is not going to be one of them.

[00:35] Everyone needs, if you are good at something, you need tools.

[00:38] All right, this equation is one of those tools that you have as an entrepreneur.

[00:41] If you have to rely on your systems, if you have to rely on finance, to get to the reports,

[00:46] to get to make general directional decisions,

[00:49] then you're going to be weak as an entrepreneur, because you have to be able to do these calculations

[00:52] in your head back of napkin.

[00:55] And so I want to show you the most valuable equation that I use in analyzing my own businesses

[00:59] and potential portfolio companies.

[01:00] And it requires five variables.

[01:02] And I'm going to show you what they are, and then I'm going to show you how I got the two hardest

[01:06] numbers that most people don't know how to get within their business.

[01:10] All right.

[01:10] So I can even give you the six number, which will be a bonus one.

[01:13] Number one is going to be number of new sales per month.

[01:16] Most people know this number.

[01:17] The next one is current revenue.

[01:19] So that's most people also know this number.

[01:21] The next number is price.

[01:23] Most people know this number.

[01:24] The next number is going to be,

[01:26] turn.

[01:27] Most people do not know this number.

[01:29] The next number is going to be lifetime value.

[01:31] Most people do not know this number.

[01:33] The next number is gross profit.

[01:35] All right.

[01:35] So I'm going to show you how in a simple conversation,

[01:38] we can figure out all of these things and extrapolate where business is going to cap out,

[01:43] where the weak points are, and how we can see what the size of the opportunity.

[01:47] All right.

[01:47] So I'm going to give you a hypothetical example that I just had.

[01:50] I was talking to a business.

[01:52] They were doing 100 new sales per month.

[01:54] All right.

[01:54] So that's number one.

[01:55] I said, cool.

[01:56] What are you guys doing in revenue right now?

[01:58] They were doing 400k in revenue.

[02:02] I said, okay.

[02:03] This is really important.

[02:04] You will want to pay attention to this video.

[02:06] They had 380 clients.

[02:08] All right.

[02:08] Their current price was $1,000 per month.

[02:12] Turn.

[02:12] They didn't know lifetime value.

[02:14] They didn't know.

[02:15] All right.

[02:16] So I said, okay.

[02:17] Well, the first thing we have to do is figure out where

[02:19] your hypothetical max is going to be.

[02:21] All right.

[02:21] So if we know the current number of new sales,

[02:24] because they're like, well, I have to get you these numbers later.

[02:26] I don't have them on me.

[02:27] I was like, if you know these numbers, we can do them live together.

[02:29] And they're like, oh, I was like, yeah.

[02:30] So let's walk through it.

[02:31] Okay.

[02:32] $1,000 a month is the price.

[02:34] Right?

[02:34] And I said, okay.

[02:35] Well, how many customers are canceling every week?

[02:38] And they said 13 people per week were canceling.

[02:41] I was like, okay.

[02:42] So roughly 50 per month.

[02:44] Okay.

[02:45] Make sense.

[02:46] Everyone good here?

[02:47] They said they have 380 active clients.

[02:49] What we do is to take 380 active clients.

[02:52] We divided by 50.

[02:53] Oops.

[02:54] Sorry.

[02:54] 50 people canceling divided by 380 active clients.

[02:58] I already did the math for you.

[03:00] It's 13% churn.

[03:01] All right.

[03:02] So now we take our price.

[03:05] All right.

[03:06] Which is $1,000 per client per month.

[03:10] We divided by that 13% churn.

[03:12] And we get 7700 bucks.

[03:14] All right.

[03:15] Roughly.

[03:16] So now I know that $7,700 is going to be the LTV per customer.

[03:22] All right.

[03:23] Which means that this business is going to cap out a 770k per month.

[03:29] All right.

[03:30] Which is about 9 million bucks a year.

[03:33] Now they were currently doing about 400k.

[03:36] Now the thing is there's a lot of business out.

[03:37] And they were growing really rapidly.

[03:39] Right?

[03:40] And it makes sense because they had this kind of sales velocity.

[03:42] So with this kind of sales velocity,

[03:44] they're going to keep growing pretty quickly.

[03:45] And then it's going to become an asymptote, which looks like this.

[03:47] All right.

[03:47] So an asymptote is you have a hypothetical max.

[03:49] And it approaches it, but never gets there.

[03:51] All right.

[03:52] So the asymptote here will be 770k.

[03:54] The thing is is that the growth rate would slow down,

[03:57] because churn is going to start eating a bigger and bigger and bigger percentage

[04:00] of the new business that is coming in.

[04:02] We know the current clients.

[04:03] We know the new sales.

[04:04] We know the current revenue.

[04:06] Right?

[04:06] We know the hypothetical max, which for me helps to be analyzed the

[04:11] potential opportunity of this business.

[04:13] Right?

[04:15] We know the churn now, which is 13%, we know the lifetime value of each customer

[04:20] now, which is 7700.

[04:22] And I asked them, what kind of margins are we running on this?

[04:25] And they were running over 90% growth margins.

[04:29] All right?

[04:29] And the easy way to do that is how much is it cost to fulfill a customer.

[04:32] So for them, for that $1,000 of a customer, it cost some less than $100

[04:36] to fulfill on.

[04:37] All right.

[04:37] So it was very, very, very low cost business, which means all you do is

[04:40] you multiply this by 0.9.

[04:42] And then you get, let's see here.

[04:45] Let me see if I can do my own math really quickly.

[04:47] All right.

[04:47] So now you get roughly, let's say $7,000.

[04:50] Okay?

[04:51] So the lifetime growth profit per customer is $7,000.

[04:56] Which means as long as we're spending less than $7,000 to a

[04:59] car customer, we are going to be a profitable business.

[05:02] Right?

[05:02] For the most part.

[05:03] When we had this little discussion,

[05:04] all right, let's go back to our little drawing.

[05:06] We know that they're going to cap at 7700.

[05:12] Right?

[05:13] Whatever you go and I'm saying here.

[05:14] So if we want to grow this business, we either have to increase this one.

[05:17] We have to increase this one.

[05:19] That's it.

[05:20] You can only grow business by getting more customers or making them

[05:22] more, more.

[05:23] Period.

[05:24] That's all we have to do.

[05:25] And within this particular business, I saw the opportunity here

[05:29] because I saw 13% turn.

[05:31] Right?

[05:32] Because check out how this goes.

[05:33] If we can just cut the turn to let's say 3% let's do some cool math.

[05:38] You want to see something really quick?

[05:39] Sure, I like something to see.

[05:40] All right.

[05:41] So if we've changed this to just 3% turn, right?

[05:46] The new LTV becomes $33,000 per customer.

[05:50] Now this misses all of a sudden without changing anything else becomes a $3.3 million

[05:55] per month business.

[05:57] That will become the new hypothetical cap.

[06:00] And almost all of that would be margin.

[06:03] Much more interesting.

[06:05] What most people do is they say, hey, I want to take this thing and see how we can get

[06:08] it to 1,000.

[06:11] Which would be awesome because then that would get us to 7.7 million per month.

[06:16] But which of these do you think is easier to do?

[06:18] 10xing the acquisition are simply dropping your turn from 13% to 3%.

[06:22] And there's lots of ways to drop turn.

[06:23] And I had a different video where I said how I cracked Netflix for current revenue model.

[06:26] There's eight seas to increase your stick or decrease your turn, whatever way you want to

[06:30] say it.

[06:31] That we'd be going through to figure out how we can cut turn from 13 to 3%.

[06:35] And FYI, for a company to have enterprise value, most private equity firms want to see 80%

[06:40] yearly retention.

[06:42] Meaning you keep 80% of your clients per year.

[06:45] So if you started a thousand beginning of the year, you have 800 at the end of the year.

[06:48] Now, if anyone wants to venture a guess at what 13% monthly turn looks like, you're

[06:53] probably keeping less than 20% of your customers by the end of the year.

[06:57] And so for them, they don't think that's an enterprise that's very valuable because

[07:00] what they're looking at, just in case, I'll give you guys a little nugget here.

[07:04] There's three main variables that they're going to be looking at.

[07:06] Any kind of potential buyer, which is what's the growth.

[07:10] Number one, number two is how likely a stickiness, which is like how likely is the business

[07:15] going to be here and then what's the profit.

[07:19] So you could pretty much multiply these things together, which is if I have a superfascar

[07:23] with company, all of the revenue is super sticky and we're very profitable and this is

[07:27] going to be a very, very, very valuable business.

[07:31] If I have a business that is mediumly growing, it is not sticky and I have low profit,

[07:38] then this is going to be a low value business.

[07:40] And so the objective for us at Acquisition.com is how do we take one of these guys, right?

[07:45] One of these businesses and turn them into one of these businesses.

[07:47] And so it's really looking at these fundamental metrics to figure out where the weak points

[07:52] in the business model exist.

[07:53] All right.

[07:54] So right now, if you're a business owner and you don't know what your hypothetical

[07:58] max is with your current model and your current numbers, you are fooling yourself.

[08:02] You don't know where you're going to cap out, which means you don't know where your

[08:04] weak points are.

[08:05] All right.

[08:06] And so right now, everyone should be able to do this math within their own business without

[08:10] any kind of complex recording without any kind of, you know, excel sheets that you're

[08:14] getting sent from finance.

[08:16] All you need to do is you got to know how many new customers you're getting, which is

[08:19] this guy.

[08:20] Dude, how many new sales you're getting, how many current clients you have, where your current

[08:25] revenue is, right?

[08:26] What your prices are, you should know all that stuff.

[08:28] And as long as you can know how many people are canceling every month, then you can calculate

[08:32] the rest of this entire equation for yourself and figure out how you can debottome

[08:38] the growth of your business.

[08:39] Because I'm a big believer in the theory of constraints, which is a business will grow up

[08:43] to its nearest constraint.

[08:46] And so all I try and do is simply remove the constraints of the business to allow to

[08:50] grow.

[08:51] Right?

[08:52] I see businesses organic beings.

[08:53] I see businesses grow and they're simply being constrained by something.

[08:56] And our goal is to find what the biggest constraint is and remove it.

[09:00] Most people try and do lots of things.

[09:01] I believe that the smartest people in the world try and find how to do the fewest things

[09:05] that get them the most returns.

[09:07] And removing the biggest constraint is the biggest one of those.

[09:09] Any who my friends, this is Alex Shmozi reporting in from acquisition.com.

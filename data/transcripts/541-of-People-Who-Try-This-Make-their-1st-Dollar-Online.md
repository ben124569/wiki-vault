## Full Transcript
[00:00] I sold my last company for $46.2 million across $100 million in that worth at age 32.

[00:04] And I just made my biggest investment ever by becoming the corner of school.

[00:08] And I always wanted breakdown videos from Jeff Bases and Warren Buffett and Elon Musk.

[00:14] What were they thinking?

[00:14] Like, of course, they're 100 billion now.

[00:16] But I want to know what they were thinking at 100 billion and 10 million.

[00:18] I want to show you what the thought processes behind the investment and most importantly,

[00:22] how you can model that decision making framework to make way more money in your life.

[00:25] I decided to invest in school and make my single large investment to date,

[00:30] including putting my brand behind it and endorsing the company because there's multiple things

[00:37] that are aligned in the same direction.

[00:39] And so Charlie Mugger talks about this because of the Lawlapoulos effect.

[00:42] And so usually when you get these like massive, explosive, growth opportunities,

[00:47] it's not because of one thing.

[00:48] So a lot of people want to have a silver bullet.

[00:50] So it's kind of like a silver bullet fallacy.

[00:52] It's thinking that there's this one big thing that if we just do that,

[00:55] then everything else will work.

[00:56] And more times than not, it's the 100 Golden Beaves, no silver bullets.

[01:02] It's two, three, five, six things that all have an incremental boost,

[01:06] but when you multiply all them together, create this insane outcome.

[01:10] And so I see that with school.

[01:13] And so let me zoom all the way back out to like the ecosystem.

[01:16] So this would be like big thing number one.

[01:18] If we look at the education industry, so let me show you some math real quick.

[01:22] Education globally is 10 trillion big.

[01:29] All right, US is 1.3 trillion.

[01:33] Still very big.

[01:35] Now this is split between two things.

[01:39] You've got formal education.

[01:41] So that would be like two year and four year degrees.

[01:43] And right now that's around, depending on the source, 850 billion.

[01:48] And for those of you who Google and find out that it's 863,

[01:51] or in another source, this is 842, it doesn't matter,

[01:55] because in this type of stuff that we're talking about,

[01:57] we're talking about big forces and we're talking about directional correctness.

[02:00] But it's around 850 billion for formal education.

[02:04] Now, on the other side, it's split.

[02:07] You've got E-learning and online education.

[02:10] I'll put that alternative education, which right now is about 200,

[02:16] 250-ish billion, 200 to 250-ish billion,

[02:20] depending on your source.

[02:22] So close to that.

[02:24] Now here's the really interesting thing about this.

[02:26] And this will relate to why I'm betting really big on school,

[02:28] or at least one of the reasons.

[02:30] Is that this one is shrinking by 6% per year.

[02:37] Kind of interesting.

[02:39] This one is growing by about $40 billion per year.

[02:44] Now that is because this one's growing at roughly 20%.

[02:48] Per year.

[02:48] So you've got this massive nut here that's shrinking by 6%,

[02:53] which is about what's the math here,

[02:55] about $50 billion is what it's losing every year.

[02:59] And we've got this other one that's gaining $40 billion

[03:03] a year and growing at 20%.

[03:05] So when I see these two things, and I see this big overall

[03:10] industry in terms of 1.3 trillion, 1.2 trillion, whatever,

[03:14] I see this as actually a crisscross.

[03:18] So formal is continuing to go down,

[03:22] and alternative or e-learning, et cetera,

[03:25] is continuing to go up.

[03:27] And so it's almost the exact amount

[03:29] that this one loses every single year

[03:32] is almost the same amount that this one is gaining

[03:34] every single year.

[03:36] And so that underpins a shift in buying behavior,

[03:41] people are seeing more and more that formal education

[03:44] doesn't give the return that it was promising.

[03:47] And people are able to learn skills directly

[03:50] that can contribute to them making more money

[03:52] and being able to contribute in society,

[03:53] feed their families, pay their rents, pay their mortgages,

[03:56] and ultimately just live productive lives.

[03:59] And so if you're a hairstylist,

[04:01] you're like, well, you know what?

[04:02] The formal education thing doesn't matter

[04:04] because all I have to do is like learn

[04:05] how to like post on Instagram, like my clients

[04:08] that even I do in my garage,

[04:09] and I get more DMs for people who want me to do that,

[04:12] and not a single customer's ever asked me

[04:14] for what my certification was.

[04:15] Huh, so maybe this skill is more valuable than this skill.

[04:20] Huh, and this girl is willing to teach me

[04:22] how she does it for a thousand bucks

[04:25] whereas this school is two years and 15 grand.

[04:29] Well, the ROI's not there, right?

[04:31] And so what's happening is a lot of this money

[04:34] that has been going to these big endowments,

[04:36] these hard words, these big university money.

[04:39] Now, I do think at the top,

[04:41] those guys are probably protected for a while,

[04:43] but it's like the mediocre middle.

[04:45] It's CCU state, right?

[04:47] Like those are the ones that afforded agrees

[04:49] that don't mean anything that no one cares about.

[04:51] All of that money is getting actually pushed

[04:53] all the way back down to the bottom

[04:55] to basically creators.

[04:57] People who are good at teaching a niche skill.

[05:02] They're like, hey, I did this thing,

[05:03] they work well for me, here's how you can do it.

[05:05] And that works for anything,

[05:06] whether it's like your son, a customer's like,

[05:07] hey, I lost the suite, this is how I did it.

[05:08] I need all the time, so it'd be also like,

[05:10] I only eat plants, whatever, and if that sounds cool to you,

[05:13] I can show you how I did it.

[05:14] And so this industry is continuing to grow up.

[05:17] So when I see this, I think,

[05:19] okay, huge amount of money changing hands

[05:22] in a very fast time zone.

[05:23] I'd rather be in this boat than in this boat.

[05:28] And so that's the thing number one.

[05:29] So that's kind of the industry overall.

[05:31] Now, if you look at me personally,

[05:34] like how do I intersect with this?

[05:36] Well, the first two companies that I sold,

[05:38] so Jim wants to pursue his labs.

[05:39] Why I sold companies before that,

[05:40] but they were just low seven figure numbers,

[05:42] not bigger numbers.

[05:43] Those companies service creators.

[05:47] And as somebody who came from

[05:49] first a direct response marketing background

[05:51] and selling media and licensing to brick and mortar gyms,

[05:56] I'm really familiar with this model.

[05:58] Like there is no university for gyms,

[06:00] and so I did my best to create that university

[06:03] for gym owners.

[06:04] Because if you went to school for being a gym owner,

[06:06] you'd make a heck of a lot more money

[06:08] than if you just went to school for like,

[06:09] business and then open to gym.

[06:11] I have lived through this huge shift in wealth

[06:14] because like I started,

[06:16] I think when I was 27 years old,

[06:17] I think we took them $16 million in income,

[06:21] just capitalizing on this trend.

[06:24] And so I know that that money is out there

[06:27] and people are starving for information

[06:30] that they can actually use to feed themselves.

[06:33] And so I have the big trend data

[06:35] that I can see on the charts

[06:37] in the big fancy finance people,

[06:39] but I also have my personal anecdote

[06:42] of having experienced that huge amount of wealth

[06:44] coming towards me.

[06:46] So that's thing number two.

[06:48] Thing number three is,

[06:51] where do I fit in with this ecosystem?

[06:55] And so my audience for the most part

[06:58] is split between business owners

[07:00] and people who'd like to start a business.

[07:02] My whole mission with making the content that we do

[07:05] has been to make real business accessible for everyone.

[07:08] And so early on for me,

[07:10] I didn't have a lot of mentors and help.

[07:13] And so I just looked everywhere I could to learn this stuff.

[07:15] And I learned a lot of it the hard way.

[07:17] One of the reasons that I put this stuff out there

[07:18] is that also some of the sources that exist out there

[07:20] are just honestly false.

[07:23] Like they are teaching things they have not done.

[07:25] They're regurgitating content from other people

[07:27] and getting key points wrong

[07:28] because they don't know why it's right to begin with.

[07:30] And just basically leading people straight.

[07:32] And I actually don't think it's malicious.

[07:33] I think they just want the views,

[07:34] they want the likes, they want the ad revenue, whatever.

[07:36] And like I don't blame whatever.

[07:37] I would like to at least put stuff out there

[07:39] that I know like I have done this.

[07:41] And I have done it many times.

[07:43] And so if you fall this process,

[07:44] whether you're a good person or a bad person,

[07:45] it will probably work for you.

[07:47] And so my audience knows that my whole goal

[07:51] has been to make real business accessible for everyone.

[07:53] And so if we're thinking, okay, Alex,

[07:55] you could have promoted, I don't know,

[07:58] pick something, drop shipping.

[07:59] Like there's a lot of different things

[08:00] that could have done, but why, why school, particularly?

[08:04] Well, because the mission of school aligns with my personal mission,

[08:08] which is to make robust and successful for everyone,

[08:11] they want like school blinds, myself included now,

[08:14] a co-owner, want to make business fun and easy for everyone.

[08:17] And so I spent six months talking to the founder

[08:21] about like, what do you really want this to become?

[08:23] And he has a huge massive vision

[08:25] and his vision aligns with my vision

[08:27] of how big I think the space really is.

[08:29] If you think about all the different industries that exist,

[08:32] most of them have been disrupted by technology in some way.

[08:36] You've got like Airbnb, so hotels, got attacked by Airbnb.

[08:39] Taxis, got attacked by Uber.

[08:41] These are the famous examples, right?

[08:42] But there isn't, if you think about it,

[08:45] no one's disrupted education.

[08:47] No, like there's no one place that everyone goes to learn stuff.

[08:51] It's still completely fragmented.

[08:54] And as somebody who's been in that space

[08:56] and understands that space very well

[08:58] and sees the trends, I believe that there will be someone

[09:01] who will take it.

[09:03] And my bet is that school will be that company.

[09:05] Now, why school versus the Zillions?

[09:09] So this is like, I guess, 0.4, which comes down to

[09:12] why this particular company, this particular product.

[09:15] And hopefully even going through this,

[09:17] the thought process, you can still relate

[09:19] to any major decision that you have to make in your life.

[09:23] And so why school particularly?

[09:26] One of my big litmus tests for something a product

[09:29] that I'm going to promote is that I want it to grow

[09:31] when it's own, meaning if the only way that a company

[09:34] grows is that it advertises, and when it stops advertising

[09:37] it goes down, I don't like that.

[09:40] I like to have passive growth.

[09:42] And so let's go over here and I'll walk you through it.

[09:45] So there's something that I call the golden ratio in business.

[09:48] You have the percentage of customers

[09:50] who refer customers and the percentage of customers

[09:54] who exit.

[09:56] So these people exit, these people refer.

[09:59] And if the percentage of people will leave every month,

[10:01] so this is 0.1, so 10% are all just

[10:03] I'll put a percentage of their customers.

[10:05] There you go.

[10:06] We'll be bear with me.

[10:08] If 10% of my customers refer me in your customer every month

[10:10] and 10% leave every month, then my business

[10:13] will stay the same.

[10:15] Now, if 20% of my customers refer me at customer every month

[10:19] and the same 10% exit, my business, over whatever

[10:22] this interval of time is, will two x to over 1.

[10:26] And that means that no matter how big I get,

[10:28] the business will consistently double every one

[10:31] of those time intervals.

[10:33] And so I look very carefully at what percentage

[10:36] of customers decide to bring other customers to the business

[10:39] and what percentage are leaving or choosing not to buy again.

[10:42] And this works whether you're selling physical products,

[10:45] it works whether you're selling software,

[10:46] it works whether you're selling services, it works the same way.

[10:48] And so this golden ratio of percentage

[10:50] of referrals over percentage of people who leave or churn

[10:53] is what tells you the passive growth rate of the business.

[10:56] Now, the vast majority of businesses,

[10:59] they've got, it's called it, you know,

[11:02] 2% of people are referring and they've got, you know,

[11:05] 10% of people that are leaving.

[11:08] And so they have to fill this bucket up with ads

[11:13] or marketing or outreach or whatever it is

[11:15] that they have to do to fill up the top side

[11:16] so that they just don't lose every number of time.

[11:18] And that's because they don't understand

[11:20] how to build a good product.

[11:22] Now, once you have a company that does this

[11:25] and does have more people who refer than leave every month,

[11:29] that is when you, this is a flame.

[11:34] That's when you pour gas on this thing

[11:36] and you say, okay, now I want to tell the world about it

[11:39] so that that number of doubles, it just goes,

[11:41] that's not, and then it doubles off the chart.

[11:44] And then you add even more and then doubles again off the chart

[11:47] because you're just increasing the end as fast as you can

[11:50] so that the doubling happens on a bigger amount of customers.

[11:53] So when I saw schools metrics, I was blown away.

[11:58] I had never seen a company who had metrics as good as school.

[12:01] To like, I've never in my history of looking

[12:04] and we look at a lot of businesses we get, gosh,

[12:08] several thousand businesses a month

[12:10] that reach out at acquisition.com for investment.

[12:13] I'm impressed to buy a minority or majority of the business.

[12:16] And so I've looked at a lot of business metrics.

[12:19] And so when I saw the passive growth rate that school had,

[12:23] it really intrigued me.

[12:24] And so that business underlying fundamentals were there,

[12:28] the mission of the fact that it wanted to make business

[12:31] online easy and fun.

[12:32] And it starts right now in the education space,

[12:37] like all of those things made it really, really good fit for me.

[12:43] Now, let's talk about enterprise value stuff.

[12:46] So number five, I am here to make money.

[12:49] And so I like to have my altruistic goal

[12:52] to make real business education access for everyone.

[12:54] But guess what?

[12:55] We have a lot of people work with this company,

[12:57] a lot, and you know, unfortunately you guys,

[13:00] you know, when to eat, feed yourselves, have girlfriends,

[13:04] and boyfriends, you know, and I have houses and cars,

[13:09] damn you, right?

[13:10] And so these guys need money.

[13:12] Unfortunately, I would do this for free.

[13:14] But they need money.

[13:15] And so money is obviously a component of any business.

[13:20] So let me walk you through the difference here.

[13:24] So let's say that I have a traditional business number one.

[13:27] So let's call this a service business.

[13:30] And let's say I'm just gonna use simple math here.

[13:33] I'm gonna try not to do too much math

[13:34] because I don't have a way to get over that

[13:37] because if you wanna make money.

[13:38] But let's say that we've got a $10 million business

[13:40] that does top line and it does $3 million in profit.

[13:43] Okay, cool.

[13:45] Now a traditional service business like this

[13:47] might be a $15 million business.

[13:50] So that's just giving a five times multiple to the business,

[13:54] which by the way, that's how businesses are valued

[13:55] is usually a multiple of earnings.

[13:57] And so cool, this is a $15 million company.

[14:00] Now if I double this company and go from, you know,

[14:03] 10 to 20 and 3 to 6, then I go this goes

[14:06] into becomes a $30 million business.

[14:08] More or less, like you'd a little bit more,

[14:10] maybe get six X because it's a little bigger.

[14:11] But more or less, I have this delta

[14:14] that I can add to the business.

[14:16] Now if I had an e-commerce business,

[14:21] my multiple might be on top line,

[14:23] but it might be a little bit higher.

[14:24] So if it was the same numbers, 10 and 3,

[14:28] then this company might trade at, call it,

[14:32] three times, you know, two times top line.

[14:34] So this might be a two times top line business,

[14:36] two X in terms of how it was valued.

[14:38] So this might be a $20 million business at baseline.

[14:41] And again, if I double this business,

[14:42] then it goes to $40 million.

[14:44] Okay, well, that went from increasing by 15 million

[14:47] to increasing by 20 million.

[14:48] So if I enter this business,

[14:49] me putting the same effort in,

[14:50] I would make more money.

[14:52] Neat.

[14:54] Now let's look at this third piece

[14:55] and then I'm gonna tie this together for you.

[14:58] Let's say we have a tax slash software business.

[15:02] And these businesses trade,

[15:07] and all of these trading multiples

[15:08] depend on all the fundamental business second ops.

[15:10] I'm trying to keep this really simple in high level

[15:12] because I want the decision making process

[15:13] to be the highlight more than the individual numbers.

[15:16] All right, but if a business again is $10 million top line

[15:21] and three million dollars a profit, let's say,

[15:24] they might get somewhere between 10 to 20 X their top line.

[15:28] And so this might be somewhere in the neighborhood

[15:29] of a hundred to $200 million.

[15:33] Now let's say I double this business

[15:36] and we go from $200 to $400 million.

[15:38] Well, then we created $200 million in value.

[15:43] So we created $15 million by doubling this one,

[15:46] $20 million by doubling this one,

[15:48] $200 million by doubling this one.

[15:50] So if you're gonna put effort somewhere

[15:51] and it's the same amount of work,

[15:54] you get more for what you put in.

[15:56] And that's fundamentally like,

[15:58] the acquisition knock-on logo is about leverage.

[16:00] So like the, it looks like this is our logo.

[16:04] And that's because this is a lever.

[16:06] And the main point there is that you get more

[16:08] for what you put in.

[16:09] And so one of my big things in life,

[16:10] the reason we build a move quickly

[16:12] in terms of accumulating material wealth

[16:13] is making sure that when we make the move,

[16:16] we get the most for it.

[16:18] And so obviously I've spent four or five years building

[16:21] an audience and not really promoting anything.

[16:23] Or any of the companies that I own.

[16:25] But this one felt too close to what so many people need it,

[16:30] which is they wanted a way to make their first business.

[16:32] They want to make a way to make their first dollar online.

[16:35] For me, the mission was aligned.

[16:37] They want to make it fun and easy for everybody.

[16:39] Just like I want to make business successful for everyone.

[16:41] It had the fundamentals of the big market behind it.

[16:47] So it's moving in the right direction.

[16:49] I'm on the right wave.

[16:56] And the business itself was sound.

[16:58] It was a really good product.

[16:59] So I felt for my brand that if I'm gonna promote something,

[17:02] it had to be really good.

[17:04] Because if people say I'm only trying this because of Alex,

[17:07] and they get in there and it sucks,

[17:10] who do they think sucks?

[17:11] Me, I'm the one to introduce them.

[17:12] Like if you had a friend who's like,

[17:14] oh, you got to use Sally.

[17:15] She's a great hairstylist.

[17:17] And you go and Sally just gives you a bus cut

[17:18] and puts your hair as blue.

[17:20] And you're like, but I wanted my hair to be red.

[17:22] Right?

[17:23] Forget the bus cut.

[17:25] You'd be upset, you'd be like Sally,

[17:26] what the hell?

[17:27] This person's crazy.

[17:28] And so you'd be upset at the person who referred you.

[17:30] And so the same degree I had to take that

[17:32] kind of, I had to take this even at a higher level,

[17:35] because I'm also a business owner.

[17:37] So I've been referred companies.

[17:38] And I'm like, oh, it's pretty good.

[17:39] Obviously there's things they could improve.

[17:41] But I know that the internet has a short memory

[17:44] and has low forgiveness.

[17:46] And so I did make sure it was something

[17:48] that I could really get behind,

[17:50] which was why it's honestly.

[17:51] I've been looking for something that I could get behind

[17:54] for years.

[17:55] There's just nothing that met the standard

[17:59] that I have for you guys, honestly.

[18:00] I got very excited about that.

[18:01] And so after six months, we decided to do the deal.

[18:05] And I talked about this big decision

[18:06] that I was going to make in an earlier vlog,

[18:09] was like, my billion dollar decision.

[18:12] It was about school.

[18:13] Was whether or not I was going to invest in school,

[18:15] and specifically also promote it.

[18:18] And like actually talk publicly about it.

[18:20] But it felt too big and like it would help too many people

[18:23] for me not to do it.

[18:24] And so that was also why I made the decision.

[18:27] Now, if you're listening to this,

[18:30] I have two camps.

[18:32] We have business owners, and we have people

[18:34] who want to start a business.

[18:35] And so I want to share some cool metrics,

[18:39] at least they get me very excited about this

[18:41] and for the future that if you want to start a business,

[18:44] even if you have a business that you'll find interesting

[18:46] and that could probably make you money.

[18:48] Because we now like now I'm a co-owner of the platform,

[18:50] I have access to a lot of information

[18:52] that other people don't have.

[18:54] And so we ran something that we wanted to call the school

[18:57] games.

[18:58] And so this was something that Sam and I came up

[19:00] with together, we were like, how do we make this fun?

[19:02] How do we make this cool?

[19:04] And so it has to be something more than just

[19:08] try this out.

[19:09] And so we're like, what if we gave away

[19:11] what everyone else charges for?

[19:12] Which is usually my go to, how do I look at what everyone else

[19:15] charges for, make it better, make it free?

[19:18] That's been my, I'll write that process out.

[19:21] Look at everyone else's charging for, make it better,

[19:25] make it free.

[19:26] If you want to get customers, that's the playbook.

[19:28] Now, so with the school games, what we did was,

[19:31] I said, okay, what, what is everyone else give away?

[19:34] Oops, the school games.

[19:38] Well, most people have coaching calls,

[19:41] but even we want to call it, to people charge for that.

[19:45] They have courses, right?

[19:47] They have courses, they put inside.

[19:48] All right, and they charge for that.

[19:50] They have a community, these are all seas.

[19:52] That's kind of nice.

[19:54] A community that they have involved there.

[19:58] And then I want to have another one, so I want to keep it

[20:02] to seas, but so they have code, which is realistically,

[20:06] they have tools, right?

[20:07] So they have tools that they give people.

[20:09] And so, it's like, okay, if someone has expert help,

[20:14] they have do-it-yourself training,

[20:15] they have support from other people doing the same thing,

[20:17] which this also builds out there.

[20:19] Here's another C4, you, builds their conviction.

[20:22] Because in the beginning, making your first dollar online,

[20:24] so little of it has to do with making their first dollar.

[20:29] And so much of it has to do with getting out of your own head,

[20:32] which is why a lot of people were trying to get into business,

[20:34] start with personal development first,

[20:36] because they have to get through other fears of rejection

[20:38] and why their dad didn't love them,

[20:39] and why they're doing this to begin with,

[20:41] and what's my passion, blah, blah, blah, blah.

[20:43] All you got to do is make a dollar in the year in business,

[20:44] just FYI.

[20:45] So, these are all the things that people charge for,

[20:48] and we're like, okay, let's just make it

[20:51] free.

[20:53] And so, that's pretty much what the school game was about.

[20:55] It was giving all of this stuff.

[20:58] And so, we do, I think, three a week

[21:01] with all the top community owners.

[21:02] So, this isn't, so this is the people actually doing it.

[21:06] And the nice thing was school, because we on the platform,

[21:08] we know no one's fronting, we see all the numbers.

[21:11] And so, and all the numbers are public.

[21:13] So, no one can claim that they're like,

[21:15] I'm making a million dollars a month,

[21:16] they're like, dude, you're right there,

[21:17] I can see how to, I'd see which you make, right?

[21:20] And so, it just keeps everything honest and transparent

[21:23] in an industry that lacks a lot of that.

[21:25] And so, my hope also seems as well is to bring transparency

[21:29] to an industry that's been very shrouded

[21:31] in just lack of transparency, just lies, honestly,

[21:35] in deception.

[21:36] I would say misrepresentation would be the correct word

[21:39] for that.

[21:39] So, we do all that stuff, and we said,

[21:43] we'll make it 30 days, and so, I'll give you the

[21:45] business explanation by this.

[21:46] So, we did 14 days for free in a 30-day games,

[21:50] that way people have two weeks, if they're like,

[21:52] you know what, this isn't working for me, they can dip out.

[21:55] If they do think it's working for them,

[21:57] and they finish the games, then they can,

[21:58] the top 10 people fly out to Vegas, and we help them grow

[22:01] there, their communities, and learn from them,

[22:03] see how we can make the product better, things like that.

[22:05] Now, this is the part that might interest you.

[22:10] Well, hopefully that interests you too,

[22:11] but this might interest you.

[22:13] So, I got the stats from the first games,

[22:16] and 30.44% of people who finished the first month of the games,

[22:24] so they went to 30 days,

[22:31] made their first dollar online.

[22:34] So, just under one out of three people,

[22:35] made their first dollar, or more, obviously,

[22:40] who finished the first month after school games.

[22:42] And that to me was like, the most excited I've ever been

[22:47] finding this out, because I obviously,

[22:48] like, I've show many people in our community

[22:50] who want to start businesses,

[22:53] and I was like, how can you make this as easily

[22:55] possible?

[22:56] It's like, okay, well, there's no other piece of software

[22:59] that has to get used.

[23:00] You don't have to learn anything else.

[23:03] It processes the money, it helps you with the delivery,

[23:06] it's all in one place.

[23:08] Like, there's nothing else that's needed.

[23:09] Like, you can run the entire business on the platform,

[23:12] and you can start for free.

[23:13] And so, that's who got me really excited about it.

[23:16] And so, I'll explain the business of the Model 2 guys

[23:19] if you're interested in terms of how school works,

[23:23] and I'll explain how the school hosts work.

[23:26] So, school is just a $99 month platform.

[23:29] And long-term, that's not the monetization place.

[23:31] I just like to explain where it is.

[23:33] So, right now it's $99 a month.

[23:35] And we keep it that way, because we just want it to be simple.

[23:39] Like, if we wanted to maximize profit,

[23:41] we would have lots of tiers,

[23:43] and we could do a ton of other things believe me,

[23:46] to make one money with the system.

[23:48] That's just not the objective right now.

[23:49] The objective right now is to get as many students

[23:51] on the platform, and as many teachers on the platform,

[23:53] so that we just create a richer and rich community of content,

[23:57] so that we can tackle that $10 trillion global nut

[23:59] of education, because if people can go to one place

[24:02] to learn whatever they want, from people who are actually doing it,

[24:06] and they'll do it affordably compared to $50,000 a year,

[24:09] whatever, you know, CCU charges, that is a bet

[24:12] that I'm willing to make.

[24:13] And so right now we're in growth mode.

[24:19] And so, that's the model.

[24:21] It's just however many groups, there are,

[24:23] is the nine times 99, is what,

[24:26] is how much money the platform makes.

[24:27] And the platform has been losing money,

[24:29] because we've been aggressively reinvesting

[24:31] in getting better and better software engineers

[24:33] and designers and developers to make the product

[24:35] absolutely exceptional.

[24:37] So that's why I've used to say a lot of big check-in

[24:39] to it because I wanted to happen.

[24:40] I wanted to crush and we will.

[24:42] Like, it's doing really well.

[24:43] So we're good there.

[24:44] But let's talk about you.

[24:46] So if you were to start a school community

[24:48] because a lot of people who follow my stuff

[24:49] are like, well, I would like to start a business

[24:51] and if you think this is okay, then I might give this a shot.

[24:55] So I'll just explain how the business model works.

[24:57] So you've got, this is my Instagram, my Instagram icon.

[25:03] Man, this is gonna be tough.

[25:04] Let's see if I can, I know all of them.

[25:08] That's TikTok, I think.

[25:10] And then you have Facebook, right?

[25:11] You have Facebook, all right, whatever, that's good enough.

[25:13] So you get social media.

[25:14] So you got traffic, you got eyeballs, all right?

[25:16] So just think about this like this.

[25:17] You got eyeballs that you have to go get.

[25:20] Now you can get those in any way you want.

[25:22] You can post, you can run ads, you can do outreach,

[25:24] you can partner with somebody who already has an audience.

[25:27] All of these are ways to fundamentally just get eyeballs.

[25:30] And so then you drive those eyeballs to your school page.

[25:36] So this is why this kind of needs.

[25:37] I'll explain this to you.

[25:38] So our vision for this is that,

[25:42] like we just turn on ad tracking this last month.

[25:44] So this is kind of exciting.

[25:45] Is that if you think about the difference

[25:47] between Shopify and Amazon, okay?

[25:49] So Shopify, let's say a sold,

[25:53] pens, I sell these markers, okay?

[25:54] So that's my product.

[25:55] I sell these markers and I sell much Shopify.

[25:57] Well, I'm gonna have to customize the whole page

[25:59] and I have to learn the integrations

[26:01] and I'm gonna have to build all this stuff.

[26:02] But I have a lot more control, all right?

[26:04] So that's the plus is that you got a lot more control,

[26:07] a lot more customization.

[26:08] The downside is it's a lot harder

[26:10] and there's no inherent brand trust.

[26:12] So if you just throw up a shop of Shopify store with pens,

[26:14] why should I buy from you?

[26:16] Not a really compelling reason.

[26:18] Although in the other extreme, you have like Amazon.

[26:20] So I'm the same guy selling pens, but I put on Amazon.

[26:23] Now I can't control the color, the reviews,

[26:27] the I can't control anything.

[26:28] I just know that I have to use the template

[26:29] that Amazon has and I put this on there.

[26:32] But here's an interesting staff for you.

[26:34] So I have a book, I've multiple books,

[26:36] 100, 100, 100, 100 shares, 100 offers,

[26:38] I've got it at a leads and another one coming out soon.

[26:42] And so my Shopify page converts it like two to three percent,

[26:45] something like that, which is like fairly standard

[26:46] for you commerce.

[26:48] My Amazon page that has the same book converts it 30%.

[26:53] So 10 times as efficient in terms of converting.

[26:56] Now, Amazon obviously takes its fee for doing the transaction

[27:00] whatever.

[27:02] But the key point is that because what happens

[27:05] is you start to build inherent trust in the platform.

[27:07] And so as people begin to trust school more

[27:10] and do more and more transactions on school,

[27:13] then these school pages will convert better

[27:15] than any page that you could possibly build in your own

[27:17] because you get to borrow schools credibility.

[27:20] That's the key point.

[27:21] And so if you're trying to get into business,

[27:23] like number one way to make lots of money,

[27:25] just have a massive huge brand of an audience.

[27:29] Okay, but if you're trying to get into that,

[27:31] it's like telling a model,

[27:33] like how do I be successful?

[27:33] It's like be born beautiful.

[27:35] Like, like, how do I be born?

[27:38] I would be a great musician,

[27:39] like be born a great musician, whatever.

[27:41] Point is, is that we can actually help arm people who are getting

[27:45] into business by letting them borrow our brand credibility.

[27:49] And because of this, it also becomes way lower technologically

[27:52] in terms of difficulty for somebody who's starting out.

[27:54] Interestingly, it's like if you look at Amazon,

[27:57] like at the Zillow, you look at Airbnb,

[28:00] they almost all more or less converge

[28:02] at the same overall layout.

[28:04] You've got a video, right?

[28:06] You've got a video, you usually got a carousel of images,

[28:10] you've got some reviews for the thing,

[28:15] you've got a buy button,

[28:17] and then usually a handful of bullets about the product.

[28:20] Almost all of the pages look like that.

[28:23] And so, bar the way, if you're going to build something,

[28:26] maybe something to consider,

[28:27] that those guys have more traffic in conversation

[28:29] than anyone on earth, they built it that way for a reason.

[28:31] And so, the school page looks the same way.

[28:34] That way, you can build it that way.

[28:36] So, you get your eyeballs, whatever you want,

[28:38] you drive it towards the school page,

[28:39] which probably can work better than anything

[28:40] that you make on your own.

[28:41] And then, did the, did the, if you're a community.

[28:45] So, you've got all your people inside your community.

[28:51] And they're all happy.

[28:52] And they look like they have dresses on,

[28:54] cool, whatever.

[28:55] And so, and so, then you provide value to those people,

[28:58] and this becomes a recurring revenue string.

[29:02] And they pay whatever, between $1 and $9, $9, $9, $9, $9,

[29:06] and whatever, per month.

[29:09] And that's it.

[29:10] And the reason I like this model overall too,

[29:12] is that it creates a way for people to provide value

[29:16] to people with low risk.

[29:18] Like if you say, hey, I need $50,000

[29:20] for you to do this thing with me,

[29:22] it's a big risk if you don't know anything.

[29:23] If you haven't consumed anything.

[29:24] But this allows people to have a front end

[29:27] that with low risk, someone can come in,

[29:29] learn about them, get value.

[29:31] And then if they want, they can choose to

[29:32] send a higher levels.

[29:33] Or that just becomes the main thing

[29:34] and they just drive tons and tons of volume through it.

[29:36] People have won in either of those scenarios.

[29:39] But this is fundamentally like the simplest business

[29:41] model I could possibly imagine

[29:42] for someone who's trying to get started.

[29:44] You don't need inventory, you don't need

[29:45] any third party integrations, you don't need to know

[29:47] anything about technology,

[29:48] and you could actually make your money on the platform.

[29:51] So this is from Evelyn.

[29:52] I just want to read this too,

[29:53] because I think it'll say better than I can.

[29:57] She said $99 a month worth it.

[29:59] I think you need to understand this.

[30:00] I keep saying post-questioning of $99.

[30:02] This is inside the school gate.

[30:03] If $99 for a community is worth it,

[30:05] and if you should go with a free Facebook group instead,

[30:09] I didn't see or understand this when I started on school.

[30:12] But if you want to actually build a community

[30:14] of a meaningful size, you need to hear this.

[30:17] I have deeper grats.

[30:18] Yesterday I was listening to Matt Thompson

[30:20] and his latest podcast,

[30:21] one thing really struck me that I want to share with you.

[30:23] It's insane how much community management costs you save

[30:25] when you use school versus a Facebook group.

[30:27] For context, in my own communities,

[30:29] we managed over 11,000 paying monthly members,

[30:31] and combined with my other business partner over 20,000.

[30:35] Because there is a, no payment integration,

[30:37] and b, Facebook restricts our paid reach down

[30:39] to an average of 300 out of 6,500 members

[30:43] in our biggest group.

[30:44] So you have this group of people,

[30:46] and you can't actually reach them.

[30:48] That sucks.

[30:50] But that's the prevailing.

[30:51] That's like what's currently out there.

[30:52] And if you want to have payments,

[30:54] it doesn't integrate with anything.

[30:55] You can't do it.

[30:57] And so we have to pay a team of people to a,

[30:59] find and remove people who don't pay

[31:00] because Facebook doesn't do that automatically.

[31:02] Like school does.

[31:03] And then b, provide 24 hour work day written support

[31:05] because school members, in contrast,

[31:07] school members actually see each other's posts

[31:09] and want to help each other up

[31:10] because of the gamification element

[31:12] and the connection that comes from having to start to engage.

[31:14] And so some of the things that school has,

[31:16] which is why it's growing at the rate that it is,

[31:18] is that we've put gamification inside of it.

[31:21] And so people get points for getting likes

[31:23] and getting comments to themselves.

[31:26] And so they gain in status in the community

[31:28] like in real terms.

[31:30] They gain status and then that status

[31:31] actually unlocks other abilities.

[31:33] Like a game.

[31:34] And so the core of the development team

[31:36] at school is actually all gaming developers.

[31:38] Because we wanted to make business fun

[31:40] and so we wanted to make it like a game.

[31:42] Because there's so many people that I see,

[31:44] especially younger people,

[31:45] but just people in general,

[31:46] who are absolutely insane at different games

[31:48] and like do it.

[31:49] If you just took this level of focus

[31:51] and applied to the business,

[31:52] you would already be a millionaire.

[31:53] Like no data might mind,

[31:55] but no one's just taking business

[31:56] and trying to turn it into a game.

[31:58] And so that is absolutely the vision

[32:00] of what we're trying to do is how do we make this fun

[32:02] and easy for everyone?

[32:03] How do we just take the bar that's already low

[32:05] and just make it that much lower

[32:06] so that way more people can cross, cross it.

[32:08] Like you don't have to be this tall

[32:09] to ride this ride anymore.

[32:10] You have to be this tall, right?

[32:12] That's the idea.

[32:13] And so she says, honestly, this is so genius.

[32:15] Our community is now whatever,

[32:16] the community she built on school

[32:18] is our most profitable community because one,

[32:19] we don't run ads to it.

[32:21] At the moment, 234 members of net growth

[32:24] in the first month after playing the school games,

[32:27] all organically from school to scoffery page

[32:30] in this community.

[32:31] So one of the cool things about school

[32:33] is that it's a platform.

[32:34] And so what that means is that like,

[32:35] when you have a community,

[32:37] this ranks in our director of communities.

[32:40] And so just like Google ranks web pages,

[32:43] we rank communities.

[32:45] And so people will go to learn things.

[32:48] They will learn how to do plumbing at home.

[32:49] They will learn how to fix their roof.

[32:50] They will learn how to play ping pong,

[32:51] they'll pick water color, whatever.

[32:53] And they go there and click water coloring groups.

[32:56] And then the groups that come up, they join.

[32:59] But the people who own those groups

[33:01] didn't generate that customer.

[33:02] We did.

[33:03] Again, this is you borrowing off of school.

[33:06] And so we can actually help people get customers as well,

[33:09] which is one of the, again,

[33:10] one of the cool things that I like about the platform.

[33:11] She had a 234 new member net.

[33:14] So that means net of turn.

[33:15] People who left, she added

[33:17] 234 without any paid ads.

[33:20] Pretty cool.

[33:21] And so the second reason that it's more profitable is

[33:23] that we haven't paid, we haven't promised

[33:25] 24-hour in support, and don't deliver it,

[33:27] because members are helping members.

[33:29] And it's working amazingly here.

[33:30] I'm really mind-blowing.

[33:31] This would never have been possible with a Facebook group.

[33:33] It might be the amazing community, the lower cost,

[33:36] or the fact that I can finally reach my own community again,

[33:38] but I'm becoming a super fan.

[33:39] I say that because I think she can say better than I can,

[33:42] is that if you actually want to have a business,

[33:44] and this is the hard part of it being a beginner,

[33:47] is that if you actually are successful,

[33:49] then you will run into new problems later.

[33:51] And so school, like for me as a marketer,

[33:54] this is the worst position of marketer from,

[33:55] because no one is suffering from the problem yet,

[33:58] but you will suffer from the problem if you actually win.

[34:00] It's like if you lose weight,

[34:02] you're gonna have to change the clothes out of your wardrobe,

[34:03] because nothing's gonna fit anymore.

[34:05] But people are still so focused on losing weight

[34:08] that they don't think about the next thing,

[34:09] but I'm telling you that you follow the steps,

[34:11] and you become one of the 30% of people.

[34:15] We make their first dollar, right?

[34:18] 30.44, make their first dollar.

[34:21] Well then when you make your second dollar

[34:23] and fifth dollar and a thousandth and ten thousand dollar,

[34:25] quickly you're like, oh shoot,

[34:26] I wish I had started this on a platform

[34:28] that already knew how to scale.

[34:30] And with school you can start the right way

[34:32] from the get go, rather than have a switch later.

[34:35] And so, big picture.

[34:38] I decided to make this bed on school

[34:41] because it was growing without me,

[34:44] based on the word of mouth.

[34:46] It's harnessing a huge trend

[34:48] in the industry in terms of education overall.

[34:53] I personally know a lot about education,

[34:55] have made a lot of my wealth and education.

[34:59] And so I felt uniquely qualified

[35:02] to help the company grow.

[35:04] Fourth, my brand has been built,

[35:06] and my mission has been about making real business education

[35:09] accessible for everyone.

[35:10] And until now I haven't seen anything

[35:13] that actually really anybody

[35:15] or any team that even came close

[35:17] to level of dedication that school team has

[35:18] and also the level of talent,

[35:20] exceptionally talented, stacked,

[35:23] developer team, like A plus talent.

[35:25] And we're able to make a platform right now

[35:28] that handles currently millions of users every month,

[35:32] millions, many millions of users every month.

[35:35] And it just works seamlessly.

[35:38] And so, for those reasons and because now

[35:40] I have the data to support this,

[35:41] I just be really clear.

[35:42] The first four things is why I made the bet.

[35:44] The fifth one, which is what I just showed you,

[35:46] the 34.44% of people who make their first dollar

[35:50] after the first month of school,

[35:51] like that's what just gets me even more jazz

[35:54] that it was the right call.

[35:55] And for those of you who are business owners

[35:57] as a side note, almost every existing business

[36:00] would benefit from having a community in one place.

[36:01] So whether you're real estate agent

[36:03] or you just want to have a place

[36:05] that you can just spoil your customers,

[36:06] they get to know each other, you make introductions.

[36:08] That means you add value.

[36:09] And the cool thing with communities

[36:10] is that the members add value to each other.

[36:13] That's like what the concept of a network effect is.

[36:15] There's a network effect.

[36:16] Like people each, when somebody else gets added to the group,

[36:18] it actually adds value to everyone else.

[36:20] So if there's one person in a community,

[36:22] there's no network, if there's two, great.

[36:24] When you add a third person,

[36:25] both of these people benefit from the new party.

[36:27] When you add a fourth person, all three benefit from the fourth.

[36:30] And that's one of the cool parts about this.

[36:31] And so if you're a business owner

[36:33] and like I said, whether you're a real estate agent

[36:35] or you're a plumber or you're a gym owner

[36:38] where you have a salon and you do hair,

[36:40] it doesn't really matter.

[36:42] Having a place where all your customers can be together

[36:44] without worrying about craziness,

[36:47] of like Facebook and some of the other social media platforms

[36:50] that exist and know that you can

[36:51] curate the entire experience just the way you want it.

[36:54] And you can reach 100% of your customers

[36:56] every single time you make a post.

[36:58] And you can reach out to them, you can DM them,

[37:00] you can do all these things.

[37:01] You can host the content, you can have calls, regular basis,

[37:04] all that kind of stuff.

[37:05] And they are incentivized to engage in there.

[37:08] And that's one of the big lifts of the platform

[37:09] is that people are incentivized to engage.

[37:11] And I'll tell you, it's wildly addicting

[37:14] because I'm obviously in school as well.

[37:16] And I'm in the school games community for everybody

[37:18] who starts 14 days, it's free.

[37:20] I wanna see my little ranking.

[37:21] I was like, I own the platform.

[37:23] I was like, I gotta fucking have my ranking.

[37:26] And so I'm in there posting and engaging more

[37:29] than I do on any other platform.

[37:30] More or less, that is why I decided to make this big bet

[37:35] and make it public.

[37:36] Because I do think this will be our,

[37:38] this will be my one of the paths that we,

[37:42] they've created a billion or plus in that worth.

[37:45] And I hope that people look back at this video

[37:46] and they're like, wow, Alex looks so dumb then,

[37:48] but now he's a billionaire, so it sounds cool.

[37:50] And so I wanted to have that.

[37:52] And so I'm committing, I'm going for monthly,

[37:56] I'd like to give updates of the cool stuff

[37:58] that's happening from a business perspective

[38:00] so that you can see us build this 1 billion, $10 billion

[38:03] and $100 billion enterprise.

[38:05] So let's do this.

[38:06] So I have my team here, they just heard me talk through that.

[38:09] And so I just told them, write down your questions

[38:12] and so when I'm done, I'll answer them.

[38:14] And so this is the questions that they had

[38:17] while I was presenting this.

[38:18] So you get it, like we really just do this in real time.

[38:20] All right, so shoot.

[38:21] The traditional education,

[38:23] it's very central, I trust it, big billions and billions

[38:26] of dollars.

[38:27] Is the key learning more distributed?

[38:29] Is it an easier playing field for the little guys?

[38:31] We don't know what they're doing yet?

[38:32] Yeah, 100%.

[38:34] So a lot of markets, basically, it's a cycle of centralization

[38:38] decentralization, that happens over and over and over again.

[38:40] And so right now, all the power was centralized.

[38:43] And so if you look at like Rome, the Roman Empire

[38:45] like it's all centralized, and then you start the barbarians

[38:48] at the gates that are all these tribes that are independently,

[38:51] none of them could take on the power of Rome.

[38:53] But in aggregate attacking from all these different angles,

[38:56] they just start nibbling away at it.

[38:58] So a lot of empires and centralization doesn't lose

[39:01] in one big coup.

[39:02] I mean, obviously in the political scene,

[39:03] sometimes it does, but it often erodes.

[39:06] So it's a little, itty-bitty snippets, little crumbs

[39:08] that get broken off.

[39:09] The cookies, so big, that the crumbs are actually

[39:12] the size of this building.

[39:13] Right, like they're big crumbs.

[39:16] And the reason that the smaller competitor can beat,

[39:19] the larger competitor right now is two main things.

[39:22] Well, I'll say three.

[39:24] One is to beat the larger competitor,

[39:27] you don't have to offer more classes than Harvard.

[39:30] You just have to know one thing better than how they teach

[39:34] that one thing, or whether they teach it at all.

[39:36] And so if I am the best pottery maker,

[39:40] and I have a whole Instagram or social media

[39:42] or a YouTube channel, whatever, of me making these insane pots,

[39:46] who are people in general going to want to learn from?

[39:49] Just generic teacher number six at CCU, who teaches pottery,

[39:54] or the largest pottery, YouTube, or Instagram person in the world.

[40:01] Well, probably that person.

[40:02] So number one, number two, what's the cost difference?

[40:06] So this is the cost component.

[40:08] New entrants can enter because they don't have to have a building.

[40:10] They don't have to employ anyone.

[40:11] If you have an iPhone and even internet connection,

[40:15] you can get famous, you can distribute.

[40:17] And so distribution, which is 0.3,

[40:19] so cost of delivery is zero.

[40:21] Cost of distribution is zero.

[40:23] And so that's the big thing is that distribution has been

[40:26] disrupted, which is fundamentally what the internet did

[40:27] in general to all industries.

[40:29] It's just at this moment.

[40:31] And I honestly think, you guys want the,

[40:34] I'll try not to put my political cap on.

[40:36] But the reason that the formal education industry

[40:39] has not been disrupted has been more slow

[40:41] to be disrupted than other ones

[40:42] is because the government props it up.

[40:45] People have interest-free loans, they don't have to pay for it

[40:47] for 10 years.

[40:49] If that weren't there, they would already be gone.

[40:52] Like I just like the fact that the government fronts

[40:56] $200,000, $100,000, $50,000, and the way it actually

[41:00] works is that they back lenders.

[41:02] So they say, if these people don't pay, we'll pay you back,

[41:06] there's more nuance to it.

[41:07] But fundamentally, the government backs the loans.

[41:09] If it doesn't cost people money to buy something,

[41:11] then the income amount of cost appears to be zero.

[41:13] It's obviously way more in a big video about it.

[41:15] But it feels like zero because you sign a piece of paper

[41:18] and then you get to go to Disneyland for kids.

[41:21] And so, and you don't have to do anything for four years.

[41:23] And you just get free money.

[41:25] So you have this discount, this big, big bad thing that

[41:28] happens years from now.

[41:29] But you get all the good things today.

[41:31] And that's just leveraged to human behavior.

[41:32] Like one cookie now, more people will take it

[41:34] than two cookies later, which is what it is.

[41:35] But also, side notes, successful people wait for two cookies.

[41:39] We'll get into that.

[41:39] The reason that that centralization is even existed

[41:42] is because of government subsidized payments.

[41:46] But the new creator can win because their content

[41:49] will be more specific and deeper.

[41:51] And they will have proof in evidence

[41:52] that they are the best at it.

[41:54] The cost of creating that content and or the deliverable,

[41:56] which is now digital education, of course,

[41:58] is calls whatever, is also free.

[42:01] And the third one is that the cost of distributing that

[42:04] is also free.

[42:06] And so, the barrier to entry is pretty much just

[42:10] the cost of the few pieces of technology

[42:12] you have to rope together to have a business.

[42:14] And the crazy thing about this is that the irony

[42:18] is that it's never been lower risk to start a business

[42:22] than today.

[42:23] It's if you rewind 100 years in 1924,

[42:27] you would have had to save for 15 years, have a house,

[42:31] use your house as leverage to go to the bank

[42:33] and say, will you help me start this bakery?

[42:35] And then the bakery had real cost.

[42:37] And if you went out of business,

[42:38] you went bankrupt, you lost your reputation.

[42:40] And then that was it.

[42:40] You'd be known as a failure for the rest of your time.

[42:42] Now, because of that, the stakes were higher.

[42:44] People tried way harder.

[42:45] But fewer people did.

[42:47] And so, the trade is now, it's way lower barrier to entry.

[42:51] And also, a lot of people who have no work ethic

[42:54] can get into it.

[42:55] But it also requires the same amount of work, but less risk.

[43:01] You stuff to work just as hard as you did at Harvard long ago,

[43:03] but you don't even need to risk as much to get it.

[43:05] And I think that's pretty cool.

[43:07] And so, fundamentally, that's why the creator economy overall

[43:10] is just booming.

[43:12] Because one person won't bring down the system,

[43:16] but a million tiny players will bring down the whole thing,

[43:18] because they each will beat that one big player

[43:21] at their tiny sliver.

[43:22] Could you break down the math?

[43:24] How much money could I actually generate?

[43:27] Well, so I want to be really clear

[43:30] about claims, implied claims, anything like that.

[43:34] All business involved risk in general.

[43:36] So if you pay for a platform this $99 a month,

[43:38] then your risk is $99 a month.

[43:39] All right, just to be clear.

[43:40] Beyond that, the amount of money you make

[43:42] is subject to how hard you try, how much you promote.

[43:46] But if you were to look at, and I think this is a decent proxy,

[43:49] so if you look at some of the largest communities

[43:50] that exist in general on the internet, outside of school,

[43:53] you've got many, many communities that are at $1 million,

[43:57] $5 million, $10 million a month.

[44:00] And it's because you have a single player, free distribution.

[44:04] And basically, as long as you have a good enough product

[44:07] and a ton of traffic to bring people into that product,

[44:10] then people will pay to be in there.

[44:13] And see, well, let me give you a little tidbit.

[44:16] So a lot of people were like, well, what do I put inside

[44:17] of a community?

[44:18] I'm going to give you a little tack to when I get here.

[44:21] All right.

[44:22] So profit well, which is owned by a buddy of mine

[44:25] who just sold it for $250 million, did a really cool,

[44:27] 14,000 business survey of what were the features

[44:33] that people were buying that had the highest willingness

[44:36] to pay, so WTP, is willing to pay.

[44:39] And then I can't remember where these four were.

[44:42] But basically, they looked at all these different features

[44:44] that people had in communities, and which ones people

[44:48] wanted to buy the most.

[44:50] Versus things they thought were par for course,

[44:52] versus things that they didn't really care about at all.

[44:55] And so it's kind of like care versus willingness to pay.

[44:58] So if you have a lot of care, so care,

[45:01] which put it this way.

[45:02] So they care a lot and they're really willing to pay.

[45:04] This is where you want to be.

[45:05] They care a lot, but they're not willing to pay.

[45:06] It means you have to do it.

[45:08] It's kind of like protein in your supplement stack.

[45:11] People care a lot, but you're not really willing to pay

[45:13] in arm and legwork, because it's almost like an expected.

[45:16] And then on the flip side, this would be the worst thing,

[45:18] which is like no one cares and no one's willing to pay.

[45:20] So don't do anything in here.

[45:22] And so they had things like discounts.

[45:24] Like if you have a community where you put exclusive discounts,

[45:28] like merch, merch is one that was over here.

[45:31] Like some people like merch, some people don't.

[45:32] Like some people are willing to pay

[45:35] call on the care spectrum, not really high.

[45:37] Over here, and this is where it gets really interesting

[45:38] and you're important.

[45:40] Newsletter was something that people like kind of expected

[45:45] for a community.

[45:45] They want some sort of regular communication,

[45:48] but they weren't willing to pay a huge amount for it.

[45:51] But the big three that we're in here,

[45:52] and so I include this one is my number four, by the way,

[45:54] because I still want to make sure I do that, right?

[45:59] Is they wanted exclusive access?

[46:02] So that means Q and A's talking to experts.

[46:06] They want to be closer.

[46:07] I think proximity, either digitally or in person,

[46:09] but just for the sake of this conversation,

[46:11] for digital community.

[46:12] It's like they want to be able to ask you questions.

[46:14] And so that means like they post and you respond,

[46:16] or you hop on a call and you respond,

[46:18] any of those things would count.

[46:19] So number one is access.

[46:21] Number two is content.

[46:23] Meaning they like some of the stuff that you put publicly,

[46:26] they just want more of that stuff,

[46:28] privately that they can't get somewhere else.

[46:29] And so you have exclusive access, exclusive content.

[46:33] As the second kind of bucket,

[46:34] courses would fall under this, trainings, things like that.

[46:38] And the final one, which surprised me, actually, was events.

[46:43] And so people in a community want to be able to meet up.

[46:45] They want to meet up in person.

[46:46] You can also do virtual events, of course,

[46:48] but I think the real powers, if you can meet people in person,

[46:50] have them fly in or fly out to them,

[46:52] depending on the size of the community.

[46:53] And so these are the big four that people put into communities

[46:57] to drive value, is that I will be the one talking to you.

[47:01] I'll respond to your stuff via DM or respond to your posts

[47:03] inside the feed, or I'll have calls on some regular cadence,

[47:07] or you can express some sort of response time for me.

[47:09] Content here is some additional training,

[47:11] here's some course, here's from whatever

[47:13] that I come in here to provide even more value.

[47:15] Now, the content can also be in feed,

[47:16] meaning you can just write articles.

[47:18] So in the school games, I prefer to be written.

[47:20] And so I actually write long articles, like probably two times a month,

[47:23] on one component of the school games.

[47:25] Like, hey, if you're using ads, this is what I would consider.

[47:27] If you're getting partners, here's a script that I wrote for you guys

[47:30] to go get partners.

[47:31] So that would be content.

[47:32] And then events is that you meet people together,

[47:34] like that one's pretty self-explanatory.

[47:35] And the newsletter, you can actually just take some of this content,

[47:37] put in written format, email it out.

[47:39] Very, very easy.

[47:41] And so school helps you all four of those things all in one place.

[47:45] When you were running gym lunch, the community

[47:48] feel like a really obvious thing that increased a lot of value

[47:50] for you, just like I'm wondering if that would be.

[47:51] Oh, yeah.

[47:52] So this is really interesting.

[47:54] So SamUnconsulting.com, which was a relatively large education

[48:00] business.

[48:01] And he found something really interesting, which

[48:03] is, I think one of the impetus, God, catalysts for this,

[48:09] for him actually innovating the product that would eventually

[48:11] become school, is that when he looked at his user data,

[48:15] he saw that people would buy a course.

[48:18] But they would log in, they'd watch a handful of videos,

[48:20] and then they would spend the rest of their time in the group.

[48:23] And so they would make content in the group.

[48:25] They'd ask questions in the group, almost everything,

[48:28] that community really was the group way less so the course.

[48:32] But everything that was out there was focused on building the course

[48:35] rather than the community being the core component.

[48:38] And so he flipped the priority and said, well, what if we made community

[48:41] the main thing?

[48:42] And just had all the things that people like that surround communities

[48:45] as, I don't know, say, add-ons, but like integrated into it.

[48:48] But the community is the hub.

[48:50] And so, yes, with Jim launch, the community was, obviously, a huge

[48:55] part of it.

[48:56] I think it works at any kind of business that service-related

[48:59] or education-related, like I still consider the gyms

[49:02] to set my education because a lot of people

[49:03] are trying to learn more about how to eat healthy, work out better,

[49:07] learn form, learn cooking, recipes, meal prep.

[49:10] There's a lot of other things that go into that lifestyle.

[49:12] And so a useful question for any business owners, like, what lifestyle?

[49:15] Am I bringing people towards?

[49:17] And so, like, if I were teaching music, there's a musicians lifestyle.

[49:20] There's probably like a way that they schedule their time.

[49:23] There's tools that they use.

[49:24] There's ways that they practice.

[49:26] All of those things go along with the identity that someone would have

[49:29] as a musician, as somebody who's a fitness person.

[49:32] As an author.

[49:33] And so, one of the great business strategies is

[49:36] think, like, what is the IM statement that accompanies my product?

[49:39] So, like, IM A and then what comes along with that?

[49:42] And so, if you can build a community around that,

[49:44] if people who also identify with that label, you'll have a much

[49:47] deeper connection with them because they all identify the same way.

[49:51] How does making a school group or taking this business model

[49:54] compared to, let's say, something like option

[49:57] that you're in, any commerce, any other thing that you need.

[50:00] Yeah.

[50:01] It depends on the goal, right?

[50:03] And so, if you're trying to make money on the internet,

[50:08] you want the thing with the simplest business model that has the lowest risk

[50:11] in the fewest moving parts.

[50:13] And I think school has that.

[50:16] I would say I'm quote biased because I'm a co-enter,

[50:19] but like, I honestly, I would never risk my reputation

[50:22] to say something for, I just wouldn't do it.

[50:24] So, you can choose to believe that or not.

[50:26] From a selling perspective, if you wanted to have a big exit

[50:29] in a business, you have to prove that you have an asset

[50:34] that is sellable, that works without you.

[50:37] Now, a school community or community in general,

[50:39] if it's built off the face of a founder,

[50:40] is gonna have the same issues of key man risk,

[50:43] that any business that is built on a founder would have.

[50:46] And so, you would have to build a school community differently

[50:50] if you had that intention.

[50:51] Now, the vast majority people that consume my stuff

[50:56] are trying to just make a lot more money than they currently are,

[50:59] whether they're by quitting their job to start something,

[51:01] or within their business they just wanna grow it.

[51:03] Now, some people wanna sell which, hey,

[51:04] I could just knock on this, we're here for it, give us a call.

[51:06] The main thing that someone wants to buy in a business

[51:09] is long-term recurring revenue.

[51:12] Is you wanna know that the people that are paying today

[51:14] are gonna pay four years from now?

[51:16] And so, school isn't, is it a sellable asset or not a sellable asset?

[51:21] It's just like any other recurring business.

[51:24] How good you are at it?

[51:25] We'll dictate how recurring it is and how valuable it is.

[51:29] And so, I'll give you an example.

[51:31] There's a acquaintance of mine who has a business

[51:36] that services mechanic shops.

[51:38] So, really niche, she's got 10 locations.

[51:40] So, he knows what he's doing.

[51:41] He's not somebody who like started one,

[51:43] wasn't making money, then started like those who can't do teach.

[51:46] He didn't go that model.

[51:47] Like he has 10 locations, he's legit,

[51:49] he's done a handful of roll ups,

[51:50] like a very legitimate player.

[51:52] And because he is legit,

[51:53] he has a business that does,

[51:56] I think, just under $50 million a year,

[51:58] all on recurring community.

[52:01] And so, if you have a niche expertise

[52:03] that has super high value and compared everything else in the marketplace,

[52:06] you have all these benefits that no one else has.

[52:08] People will stay and look continue pay.

[52:10] And this guy has grown every single year.

[52:11] And so, if I'm looking to acquire a company,

[52:13] yes, I'm super interested.

[52:15] Now, on the flip side, if you create a community

[52:16] and you don't provide value and people cancel in two months,

[52:18] then no, it's not gonna be valuable.

[52:20] You'll make an income,

[52:21] because you'll know how to market

[52:22] and you convert some sort,

[52:23] you just do number of new conversions per month times,

[52:25] average order value,

[52:26] and you'll get how much money you're gonna make

[52:28] in terms of income.

[52:29] But I would say this is that if you're trying to get going,

[52:32] don't worry about that,

[52:33] get the first dollar across the bridge.

[52:35] You'll learn so many skills in just doing that.

[52:37] The next steps will become clear to you

[52:39] once you take the first steps,

[52:40] because it's really easy to get overwhelmed in the beginning.

[52:42] Just get the first dollar across the line.

[52:44] You have a huge international audience.

[52:46] Yeah.

[52:47] And I wonder part of this was being able to make

[52:49] business accessible to people who are working.

[52:51] Do you do a thousand percent?

[52:52] Yeah.

[52:53] So we have right now 50% or something like that

[52:55] of our total audience is international.

[52:58] And so having something that could also service

[53:01] all of those people was a huge,

[53:03] a huge boom to why this also made sense for me.

[53:07] Versus like if I had a physical product thing

[53:08] and we were only in the US,

[53:09] then I would automatically cut out probably 70%

[53:12] of the people that I could potentially help.

[53:13] And this is, yeah, and a great point too,

[53:15] is that if you make constantly internet, for example,

[53:17] as a way to get customers,

[53:18] you will also have a certain percentage of your audience

[53:20] that is international.

[53:21] And having a community for example,

[53:24] as long as everyone speaks the same language,

[53:26] you can provide value to them without having to worry

[53:28] about international borders,

[53:30] the tariffs, tax, you don't worry.

[53:32] That stuff believe me.

[53:33] I've done international shipping.

[53:34] It's a nightmare.

[53:35] Also, anyone can join the school games

[53:37] and read your posts and potentially come out to that quarters.

[53:40] Yeah.

[53:40] So this is becoming a portfolio company and safety.

[53:42] Yeah, and one of the other things that I thought was kind of cool

[53:44] is obviously the only companies

[53:45] that we really directly interact with are companies that we own.

[53:48] But by having the school games and the top 10 every month

[53:52] of the school games and the cool thing about the school games,

[53:54] that's a push to the super hard.

[53:55] But is that it's off of new recurring revenue,

[53:58] meaning it's not like, oh, these guys have been doing

[54:02] school for five years and they win every month.

[54:03] If you win, you get taken off.

[54:05] Number one.

[54:05] And number two, it's based on the new added revenue.

[54:08] So you can start at, in fact, March of last month,

[54:11] I think four or five of the people who won started

[54:14] that exact month.

[54:16] Now, some people started a handful of months ago,

[54:17] and then took it seriously, they went pro.

[54:20] This is the month of the trying to win, and they really pushed it.

[54:22] And then they did get on the top 10,

[54:23] and they're flying out to Vegas to hang out,

[54:26] talk about growing their business.

[54:27] But like four of them, literally, like they're like,

[54:30] yep, I saw an ad, and it was February 28th,

[54:33] and then I was like, I'm starting on the first of March,

[54:36] and they just did it.

[54:37] One guy met his business partner, I think in school,

[54:40] and was like, oh, you know, he's foreign guy.

[54:43] He was like, you know, Armosi?

[54:44] Yeah, he's got the school games.

[54:45] I'm doing it.

[54:46] Like, let's win, and they met,

[54:48] and one guy handled the delivery, the other guy

[54:50] handled the promotion, a great partnership,

[54:51] and they came in 10th place.

[54:52] They just got in.

[54:54] It was really cool, very cool, Russian guy.

[54:56] Yeah, really cool.

[54:57] Do you want to talk about why Sam?

[55:00] Yeah, I mean, Sam, he's obsessive.

[55:03] And so this is really interesting for you.

[55:05] So people have probably heard the term OCD, right?

[55:07] Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.

[55:09] First off, I would drop the D,

[55:10] and just say somebody's obsessive in Compulsive.

[55:13] It doesn't mean it's a disorder unless it affects their life.

[55:16] And I would say many quote OCD people do better

[55:18] than people who are not, and so why would it be a disorder?

[55:20] But neither here nor there.

[55:23] So you have two components,

[55:23] or you have obsessiveness, and you have Compulsiveness.

[55:26] I think the ideal makeup of an entrepreneur,

[55:29] somebody who's obsessed with not Compulsive,

[55:31] is that you can literally hold your attention

[55:33] on this goal for years, and not compulsively changed direction,

[55:36] not compulsively need to do things to quail that.

[55:38] You just are obsessed with this one thing.

[55:41] And Sam is obsessed.

[55:42] He wants to build the absolute best product

[55:44] that is the most fun that makes making money online,

[55:47] and making your first business as easy as possible.

[55:49] And seeing that obsession and his attention to detail

[55:53] throughout the many months of conversation

[55:55] that we had before we decided to,

[55:56] before I decided to buy in as a co-owner of the company,

[55:59] and then obviously promote it publicly.

[56:03] I saw his obsession, and I felt like it mirrored mine

[56:06] in a different vertical.

[56:08] And I think from a partnership perspective,

[56:09] that's what you want, is that you want someone

[56:11] who's as obsessed with you, sorry, as obsessed with whatever

[56:16] they're good at, as you are with whatever you're good at.

[56:18] What you don't want is somebody who's as obsessed

[56:20] with the same things as you are,

[56:21] because then one of you isn't necessary.

[56:23] And so perfect partnership,

[56:24] typically there's three big veins in a business.

[56:26] You've got product, you've got promotion,

[56:28] and you've got people.

[56:29] And so you want somebody who represents all three of those.

[56:32] Now to be clear, the equity distribution

[56:34] doesn't need to be third, third, third.

[56:35] You can have an employee who's exceptional,

[56:37] like it's just those are the functions

[56:40] that have to be maintained for business to grow.

[56:42] My last question is a little like Easter Egg,

[56:44] for anyone who's made it all the way to that in the video,

[56:46] from the first couple of school games,

[56:48] or are there any really amazing tips or tactics

[56:50] that you've seen for people building great communities

[56:52] and scaling away from them?

[56:53] So instead of tips or tactics,

[56:55] I will say that there's a lot of ways to win the game.

[56:57] And I think that is probably the meta lesson,

[57:00] is that I have seen people on the school,

[57:03] school games who only did email out about.

[57:05] They literally did cold email,

[57:07] got on the phone, and sold people into their community.

[57:09] Now, obviously they'd have a higher ticket,

[57:10] so it's more like $500 a month,

[57:12] or $1,000 a month for their community,

[57:13] but they won the school games that way.

[57:15] There are people who already had organic audiences,

[57:18] and then just like basically made the CTA and said,

[57:20] hey, put a ton of bonuses, ton of value in there,

[57:22] and they were able to take an audience

[57:23] that they basically were making anything from,

[57:25] and then turn it into a community

[57:26] that they also got paid for.

[57:27] So they both deepen the community

[57:29] and make an income from it.

[57:32] So that's like the people who had audiences.

[57:33] There's also people who ran ads to make this work.

[57:37] There's people, and this is probably my favorite model,

[57:39] is there's these two guys,

[57:41] makes it for hard, who came in, I think,

[57:43] third or, third last time,

[57:44] and neither of these guys have social media presence is at all.

[57:47] But they reached out to an influencer

[57:49] that had like 50,000 followers, and they said,

[57:51] hey, we'll do everything.

[57:54] Like, we'll edit your videos, we'll prompt you,

[57:57] we'll record it, and we'll do the CTAs,

[58:00] we'll do everything, and we'll make this community,

[58:01] and we'll manage it, and they grew him from 50 to 3 million.

[58:06] So they were good at what they did,

[58:08] and they also started the school games the first month,

[58:10] they made, they added like 40,000 in recurring revenue,

[58:13] or 50,000, something like that in the first month,

[58:16] in recurring revenue, like not like recurring revenue.

[58:18] So my point is, if I had to start over tomorrow at zero,

[58:23] if I had to start over tomorrow at zero,

[58:24] and I didn't have any money, and I had no connections.

[58:28] Like, no nose me, I have no reputation.

[58:30] The model that I would use to win the games

[58:32] is I would use cold reachouts, two people who are influencers,

[58:37] to ask them the partner with me,

[58:39] because of that, because the hit rate, you only need one.

[58:42] So from a success percent, you literally just need one,

[58:45] and the key, and this is the pro tips,

[58:46] if you want an easter egg, this is it.

[58:49] When you do these reachouts,

[58:50] every position has an advantage and a disadvantage.

[58:53] So I'm gonna zoom out for a second

[58:54] and explain the advantage of the underdog.

[58:56] So when I had Jim launch, I had a guy who,

[58:59] so I had Alan to my software company,

[59:00] and we had, so this is kind of funny,

[59:02] but I had agencies using one of our unique selling props,

[59:05] and their business, they were trying to compete with my business,

[59:07] but we were the underlying infrastructure anyways.

[59:10] And so they were like, everybody wants to buy your thing,

[59:12] because you're the biggest average player, right?

[59:15] And I was like, dude, when I came in,

[59:16] I wasn't the biggest average player, so what did I say then?

[59:19] So when you're coming in, you say,

[59:21] man, to Alex, you're just a number.

[59:23] Like, you're never gonna talk to him,

[59:25] like he just owns this thing.

[59:26] Like, he's just, like it's just some representative

[59:28] that he trained who's gonna be on your account.

[59:30] Like, it's gonna be nothing with me.

[59:32] You get all my attention.

[59:33] I'm gonna be fully focused.

[59:34] I only have two other customers,

[59:36] like you're gonna have all my attention.

[59:37] That's the advantage.

[59:39] Now, if I'm Alex, I'm gonna say,

[59:41] this kid's in his mom's basement.

[59:43] He has no idea what he's doing.

[59:44] There's a reason that he only has two customers,

[59:46] because he does not have a provide value consistently.

[59:48] We've systematized this thing,

[59:49] so we can consistently produce the result.

[59:51] Everybody has an advantage,

[59:53] and everybody has a disadvantage.

[59:55] And so if you're getting in,

[59:56] even if you have zero customers, here's what I would say.

[59:59] I would say, listen, I don't want,

[60:00] I've started this with the intention of not having

[60:03] lots of customers.

[60:04] I want to find a partner.

[60:05] And I'm gonna devote everything I have to just this.

[60:08] Anybody else is gonna split you

[60:10] and you're gonna be in account to them, you're gonna rep.

[60:12] But with me, it's just me.

[60:14] And I'm gonna build this whole thing myself.

[60:15] Like, you'll have myself, we'll talk every day,

[60:17] we can do whatever you want.

[60:18] I'm gonna build this thing.

[60:20] And the way you prove it,

[60:21] this is the key point, this is the real nug,

[60:24] is that when you do that outreach,

[60:25] and you say it with that perspective,

[60:27] when you get on the phone, fucking prepare.

[60:29] Don't get on the phone and be like, yeah,

[60:31] I was thinking maybe we'll partner up on this thing,

[60:33] you have this value and I have nothing,

[60:34] this should be a great deal.

[60:36] Now, you get on and you do so much work ahead of time.

[60:41] DM the people who are commenting on their stuff,

[60:44] get on the phone with them, say,

[60:45] hey, what kind of community would you want?

[60:46] Take the notes, record the call.

[60:48] If you do five of those interviews

[60:49] and then you hop on that call with that influencer

[60:51] and you say, hey, I made this deck to mind if I showed to you,

[60:53] they're gonna be like, you made a deck about my business,

[60:55] and they're like, yeah, I can walk you through

[60:57] kind of the strategy, I was thinking about,

[60:58] what the faces roll out that we could do,

[61:00] and what I've already talked to your customers

[61:02] about what they want.

[61:03] They're gonna be fascinated by the fact

[61:05] that you might know something about their customers

[61:07] that they don't.

[61:08] And you know how you do that, you work, it's work,

[61:12] that's how you do it.

[61:13] But you literally work so much

[61:15] that when you make the claim that you will work hard for them,

[61:18] you are demonstrating that you will work hard for them,

[61:21] and so they will believe you.

[61:22] Because fundamentally, every person just wants

[61:23] a hard working partner, right?

[61:25] You just have to get them to believe that.

[61:27] Now, anyone can say I'm gonna work my butt off,

[61:28] I'm all in, but the proof is stacked against you

[61:30] because you have nothing.

[61:32] And so you have to make up for that.

[61:33] Now, and here's the caveat, what if

[61:36] influencer number one says no, you do it again,

[61:39] and when you get on the phone with influencer number two,

[61:41] guess what you do?

[61:42] You show the thing you built for influencer number one,

[61:44] as an example, and then you show theirs.

[61:47] And if they say no, what do you do?

[61:48] When you go to influencer number two,

[61:49] you show the stuff for influencer number one,

[61:51] and number two, and then you show there.

[61:52] So you're actually building out a portfolio of stuff,

[61:54] but you have an incentive to make it exceptional,

[61:56] because you're not gonna present it to somebody.

[61:58] So like, you win either way.

[62:00] The only way you lose is if you don't work.

[62:02] And I promise you, that don't long enough time

[62:04] horizon, if you reach out to these people,

[62:06] and you get on the phone with one,

[62:07] and I don't think, this is a key point,

[62:09] I would not shoot outside of your league.

[62:12] All right, like if you've never done this before,

[62:13] I wouldn't say go after five million person account.

[62:16] I just don't think that's a smart idea.

[62:18] But I think if you go after a 50, 100, 150,000 person account,

[62:22] and to be clear, you wanna make sure they're getting

[62:23] engaged when it's like bought a countermeasure,

[62:25] but you wanna a real person who,

[62:26] and like you wanna know the real secret,

[62:29] go to somebody you already follow.

[62:31] Go to somebody you already like,

[62:32] because then you won't be BSing when you talk to them,

[62:34] you're like, I love this stuff about your brand.

[62:36] I think this would fit in in this way.

[62:37] And you know how that thing two months ago,

[62:38] I think this would be perfect with that.

[62:40] And I talked to a bunch of my friends who also follow you,

[62:42] and I talked to these other people,

[62:43] just so it wasn't just my friends.

[62:44] And these are the things that they were looking for.

[62:46] And I think that if we did this, here's an estimate,

[62:48] like if we convert one percent of your audience over

[62:50] at this much a month, I think that'd be interesting.

[62:52] And so you probably follow 2,000 people now anyways.

[62:56] So just pick 100 of them, or pick 50,

[62:59] or if you really wanna be targeted, pick 10,

[63:01] and think to yourself,

[63:02] if I had to get one of these 10, what would I do?

[63:04] And then do that.

[63:05] And I promise you you'll get one.

[63:06] And then from there, you have a partner.

[63:08] And then you get the levers in fact

[63:09] that they spent five years building their audience,

[63:11] and you get to have a part of that today.

[63:12] Even if you only get 20 percent, right?

[63:14] Now of course you have to negotiate that piece.

[63:17] But my recommendations don't be greedy up front.

[63:19] Get the deal done.

[63:20] Get the reps in your belt,

[63:21] because also being real, you don't know what you're doing.

[63:23] And so I wouldn't try and ask for the majority of this.

[63:26] Until you have some reps in your belt, right?

[63:28] So take a small percentage, use it to build your portfolio

[63:31] in terms of your proof that you're good.

[63:33] You learn it, it's zillion things along the way.

[63:35] And you're gonna get paid to learn.

[63:36] And so if all the school stuff's on interesting to you,

[63:39] I do have an easy offer for you.

[63:40] You can go to school.com,

[63:43] 4-slash games,

[63:45] and what we have inside for you is we have

[63:48] three calls a week with guys who are actually making tens

[63:50] of hundreds of thousands of dollars a month

[63:52] on school using the platform,

[63:55] teaching you exactly what they did step by step.

[63:57] So we've got calls for you of other people.

[63:59] We've got a community of others to help you out.

[64:03] And I think the benefit here is that you get people

[64:05] who are both starting with you at zero,

[64:07] but people who are also at the end of the race cheering you on.

[64:09] And so you kind of have like three types of accountability.

[64:12] So you've got peer accountability.

[64:14] You've got kind of like coach accountability

[64:16] because people are rooting for you,

[64:18] but then you also have alumni accountability.

[64:19] People who've already been through it.

[64:21] And then I made a course that I put in there.

[64:24] It's free.

[64:24] It just shows you how to do this,

[64:26] the different ways to play the game,

[64:27] the different kind of like avatars that you can self-select.

[64:30] Maybe I'm somebody who likes making content.

[64:31] Maybe I'm somebody who's better at ads.

[64:32] Maybe I'm somebody who already has an audience.

[64:34] Maybe I'm somebody who likes outbound.

[64:36] Maybe I'm somebody who likes to have a partner.

[64:37] So I break down all the different paths

[64:39] that you can use to really start making money

[64:41] on the internet with what I think is the easiest business model

[64:44] out there.

[64:45] The best part in my opinion is that all of this stuff,

[64:48] obviously we have the prizes, the top 10,

[64:51] gets fly out.

[64:52] So hopefully you can do that.

[64:53] You only need three people.

[64:54] And I just did a one day full deep dive.

[64:57] It's eight hours of me just helping the top 10 communities scale.

[65:02] And those recordings are live right now.

[65:04] So if I had a $100,000 mastermind or something,

[65:08] this would be it, except it's yours and it's free.

[65:10] And here's my incentive for you.

[65:12] If you just get three people into your group.

[65:14] All right, so I like to put as low as I possibly could.

[65:17] You get three people into your group.

[65:19] You can get your friends in there.

[65:20] I don't care if you cheat it.

[65:21] It's fine.

[65:22] It's three people in your community.

[65:24] And you get all the downloads from that.

[65:26] And all of this stuff, you can start for free.

[65:30] For 14 days, just so you can get a feel for it.

[65:32] You can go in there, download everything,

[65:34] and steal it all for all I care.

[65:35] All right, but my hope is that you actually use it,

[65:37] so you can make your first dollar.

[65:38] And I will just repeat this one step,

[65:39] because I think it's the most important step

[65:41] I think of the business right now.

[65:42] Is that 34, 30.4% of people who finish the first month

[65:47] of the school games, make their first dollar online.

[65:49] The bonus compelling is I can get.

[65:51] Check it out, school.com for such games.

[65:53] See you there.

[65:53] I'm also on the inside of the group too,

[65:55] so hit me up, tag me whenever.

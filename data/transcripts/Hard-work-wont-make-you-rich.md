[00:00] Hard work will not make you rich.

[00:02] I get driven nuts by the amount of gurus and influencers and whatever who want to brag

[00:06] and say no one can not work me, I'm the best in the world.

[00:08] So many people out work me.

[00:09] I still make more money than them.

[00:10] There has to be something else.

[00:12] One of the things that grinds my gears about a lot of people that I see on Instagram that you

[00:16] probably see too is this whole like, no one can outwork me mantra.

[00:20] First off, it's objectively false because many people,

[00:22] A, I work you today, B, I work you have been in the past,

[00:25] C, you have a met everyone, and D, it doesn't f***ing matter anyways.

[00:28] It's the same thing when someone's like, I'm the best, and you have to say you're the best,

[00:31] because if you don't think you're the best, it shows that you're not confident.

[00:34] To me, I don't take that at all.

[00:35] If someone's like, I'm the best, then why aren't you on f***ing billboards?

[00:39] That's what the best would look like.

[00:40] Absolutely, you need to do the work.

[00:42] You need to put volume in, it's the only way you get better.

[00:44] But if you start claiming that you are the best, you cannot be outworked.

[00:48] You are making statements that you know are not true.

[00:51] Why are we bragging about work?

[00:52] Because work has very little to do with the highest levels of the game.

[00:56] War of Buffet talks about if he makes two good decisions a year, he's had a good year.

[00:59] And so how is it that one of the best investors, one of the best business people in terms of

[01:03] measuring and buying money, which is how you measure business?

[01:05] Talks about how he does basically nothing reads five or six hours a day, eats McDonald's,

[01:09] and makes a couple good decisions a year.

[01:10] How is it that that guy is making so much more money than the people who are bragging about the

[01:13] fact that it works so hard?

[01:14] Everyone only has the same hours of the day.

[01:16] Anybody who only sleeps eight hours or only sleeps seven hours,

[01:19] and works the remaining hours of the day, all of them would be tied for hardest work.

[01:24] So what creates output?

[01:26] You have volume of activity, and then you have the leverage of the activity that you're doing.

[01:30] That's what creates the total output.

[01:32] In order to do anything, you must do something.

[01:34] There has to be some level of energy that gets input into the system.

[01:37] Our activity in terms of number of activities is a very new be measure of success in the beginning.

[01:43] War of Buffet doesn't say, I said a thousand emails today.

[01:47] Doesn't talk like that.

[01:48] He's playing a different game.

[01:49] Jeff Bezos is like, woke up at 4am today.

[01:51] Now mind you, I'm saying this to somebody who likes waking up early.

[01:54] We can't be as superstitious about what matters.

[01:56] We can't early, doesn't matter.

[01:58] Going a bit late doesn't matter.

[01:59] Not sleeping a lot doesn't matter.

[02:00] The few things that matter are the inputs that go into the system that have the most leverage

[02:04] to create the most output.

[02:05] Now, if you're a newbie, and you can't get your ass off the couch,

[02:08] then by all means, figure out how to actually get your ass off the couch and do stuff.

[02:12] But then there's only so many hours, and so boom, and then very quickly you hit your capacity of work.

[02:16] Great, you maximize that.

[02:18] Now what?

[02:18] The leverage that we have on that activity is going to dictate how much we get out of it.

[02:22] And if we do a low leverage activity, many, many, many times, we might get more than a high

[02:27] leverage activity that gets done once.

[02:28] A CEO who's going to work with acquisition.com works virtually every hour of every day when they

[02:32] come in.

[02:33] Almost everybody does.

[02:34] Sometimes they ask they're like, am I going to be working more?

[02:35] Or like it's impossible for you to work more.

[02:37] But you are going to be changing what you work on because that's the only lever we have.

[02:40] There's only 20 hours.

[02:41] So we're going to switch these nine out, and we're going to pop these in with higher leverage

[02:45] activities.

[02:46] And we do that as we look at their calendars, and we look at their work chart.

[02:49] This is how you fucking grow a business.

[02:50] You look at what they spend their time on, and you see which of these activities are low

[02:53] leverage.

[02:54] Is there anyone else in this orchard that we can hand these activities in?

[02:56] And if a large percentage of these activities are a certain type of thing and they don't

[03:00] exist in the orchard, then it's a role that we need to hide.

[03:02] The point of why I hate the concept of knowing cannot work me is that there are many ways

[03:06] to win the game.

[03:07] If you were to think about an amazing goal as a dragon to be slain, if you are familiar with

[03:12] video games in any way.

[03:14] When you create like a war party, you have a group of people that are going to go

[03:16] going to quest.

[03:17] You don't just have 10 paladins or guys who just have shields and swords.

[03:21] So you've got a healer, a mage that's really good at damage, but can't take a lot of damage.

[03:25] You've got a paladin who can't hit his heart, but he can take a lot of shots.

[03:29] You find people who have complimentary skills.

[03:31] If you're playing football, you don't have 10 running backs.

[03:34] The entrepreneur really should be the coach of the team.

[03:38] It's about organizing the pieces and how the well they play together that ultimately determines

[03:43] how good the team is.

[03:44] Like how many times have you seen the team with the all-star that has the poor supporting

[03:47] cast get beat by the overall better team.

[03:49] It happens all the time.

[03:51] A lot of entrepreneurs, as I see them, are trying to play the game like their the star player

[03:56] and they want to score all the points, but they lose to Apple because Apple's got a team.

[04:01] We celebrate a specific action like work.

[04:05] When it's really just saying, oh look, there's a paladin who can take a lot of hits.

[04:08] Cool.

[04:09] That's not the only thing that's required to win.

[04:11] I think what is more valuable is to know what are each of the roles that exist within

[04:15] the business A, B is they're one of these that you map to based on your characteristics

[04:20] and skill sets and then see what is my eventual evolution through entrepreneurship.

[04:24] We'll start at the beginning, which is what are the players on the field?

[04:27] So if you think about it by function, you've got somebody who has to promote who's got

[04:30] to be a good marketer.

[04:31] They have to understand how to make things known across different platforms, telling stories, building

[04:35] a brand, providing value to an audience.

[04:37] That's what marketing is.

[04:38] Sales is being able to convert that raw attention into a sale.

[04:43] Direct response adds sales pages, video sales letters, etc., which is pretty much anything

[04:47] that's physical products are software based that's low ticket or it's higher ticket.

[04:51] People to people hand-in-hand combat who know how to in the beginning sell and then later

[04:55] train how to sell and then later later lead people who train how to sell.

[04:59] These are not necessarily the same people.

[05:00] I've met really brilliant markets of second sales and we're really good sales people

[05:03] with second marketing.

[05:04] Then you've got somebody who understands product.

[05:06] How do we make something beautiful?

[05:07] The guy who started Shopify, he's not CEO Shopify.

[05:11] He's had a product.

[05:12] He's a mage.

[05:13] He knows how to cast spells and then you've got the experience people.

[05:16] Remanaging everything outside of the actual product itself.

[05:19] How do customers engage with us?

[05:20] How can we run more value?

[05:21] How do they make their own experience?

[05:22] How do we make sure they're hitting these milestones?

[05:24] This person who knows customer experience, the customer success is not the same person who

[05:27] understands product and UX and design, that's a different game.

[05:31] Which is different the guy who has had a close, is different the guy who knows how to

[05:32] promote.

[05:33] The bigger the enterprise gets, the more specialized the skill becomes and the deeper

[05:37] the well of experience the people need to be.

[05:38] They have to be more specialized.

[05:40] When people are like, I can't be outworked.

[05:43] You're bragging about the wrong thing.

[05:45] It should be like, I can't be out recruited.

[05:47] I can't be out managed.

[05:48] No one can build a culture like me.

[05:50] That's super high leverage across your organization.

[05:52] No one can lead like me, but no one can outwork me.

[05:56] It's just in a relevant activity metric.

[05:58] I love working.

[05:59] I work all the time, but I would never claim that no one works harder than me.

[06:02] I tend to have very good leverage with the activities that I do.

[06:04] I spend tons of time writing a book in that book, prints and sells copies forever.

[06:07] It's a different way to play the game.

[06:09] And so level two of this, which player you are.

[06:11] In the middle run of this, you end up segregating yourself to a portion of the business

[06:15] that you're an expert at, or that you're best at.

[06:17] CMO, or chief sales officer, chief product officer.

[06:19] It's not about one player being the champion here.

[06:22] It's about how the team works together.

[06:23] Which then gets to the third level of this is just about being the coach.

[06:27] Think about the best coaches do.

[06:29] They're literally trying to head out the best players and they're trying to recruit the best

[06:32] people from college.

[06:33] Look at what Google does.

[06:34] Think about the recruiting efforts.

[06:35] They've huge influxes dedicated to getting the best and smartest people out of college.

[06:39] And they have another ring for the best and smartest people come out of business school.

[06:42] And then another one is their very high level recruiting at the top of the executive level.

[06:46] The parallels between sports and business, they are almost the same in that way.

[06:50] Now mind you, you can only have 10 or 11 people on the field.

[06:53] You might have 10,000, but if each of those players represents a function or department of

[06:57] the business, it makes more sense.

[06:59] When we move up the levels of entrepreneurship, we need to make sure that we're playing

[07:03] the right game and that we're using the right metric to measure our success.

[07:08] Final level of this is being the coach.

[07:10] Is recruiting the top level executives and creating a farm system underneath the feed into

[07:14] the company that you have so that you can have a sustained competitive advantage and create

[07:18] a dynasty for the team so you can create the best-winning team every year and have the soft

[07:23] skills of creating culture of high performance so that you get the most out of every individual

[07:28] player.

[07:29] And the difference between amazing coaching and mediocre or poor coaching is what would players

[07:33] do if they had no coach or later?

[07:35] And then what would they do if they had the best coach and best leader?

[07:37] The delta between those two is the value of the coach, the value of the CEO.

[07:42] The CEO needs to have the highest return on time out of anyone the organization because

[07:45] they need to always be solving the next problem.

[07:47] As long as when they replace their time, the activities do with the new stuff, builds the

[07:52] business even more, then that trade will always work.

[07:55] And if CEO can come in and turn a business around, even behemoths around, in two, three

[07:59] years, based on the standards that they set and the values that they stand for, that

[08:04] delta across the entire organization is your greatest leverage.

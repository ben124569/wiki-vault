[00:00] It's actually pretty easy to beat 99% of people because most people do the wrong stuff.

[00:05] And for me personally, I have a portfolio of companies that act was just not calm, but

[00:09] it's over $250 million per year.

[00:12] And I make these videos because I am really just shouting at my younger self of all the mistakes

[00:16] that I was making by working a lot on things that didn't move my business.

[00:22] The vast majority of growth is a most part, or wrong because if they were right, the people

[00:27] do them and then grow, but most of growth is counterintuitive.

[00:30] So I want you to imagine your business as a tree.

[00:34] So let's say you've got this tree and it's planning the ground and you're like, where's

[00:36] the top of the tree?

[00:37] Don't worry, we'll get there.

[00:38] And the height of the tree, over time, let's just imagine as your revenue.

[00:43] So as the tree gets taller, your revenue goes up.

[00:46] Okay.

[00:47] Now, the problem is, let's say that you have these little offshoots, right?

[00:51] These little, these little, these little, these little growth.

[00:53] Hey, these are B plus problems.

[00:55] They should add this thing to our e-mouse.

[00:57] Let's say we should do this thing far, far.

[01:00] What happens is the resources from the tree, from you, from the ground that are going

[01:04] into this thing, are getting shot out to the side.

[01:07] And so you are growing.

[01:09] You feel like you're solving problems, but you're still here at the same revenues you

[01:14] were last year.

[01:16] But once you cut these things off, then all of the resources go right into the trunk and

[01:22] they just keep growing.

[01:25] And then your business continues to say, focused on the one thing that is going to move

[01:31] the tree up the most.

[01:33] So it's not about the amount of tasks that you finish.

[01:36] It's the amount of growth each task gets you.

[01:40] And this is why, even biblically, they talk about the way to keep a tree healthiest, to

[01:46] prune it.

[01:47] And pruning literally means you're cutting things off.

[01:50] Amendment is the elimination of alternatives, which means commitment is literally the

[01:55] recipe for growth.

[01:57] It's that you focus all resources on the one growth path that you get the most for.

[02:03] Right now, you have a big list of things that you think you should do.

[02:07] And what often happens is that you will do number five, number three, maybe number two,

[02:12] because those are the ones that you're like, oh, I can knock that out pretty quick.

[02:14] Oh, I can knock that out pretty quick.

[02:16] But what ends up happening is you get to the end of the day and you still have that number

[02:18] one thing that's sitting there on your list.

[02:20] And that number one thing, you probably know is the most important thing that if you only

[02:24] did that one thing, it would make the rest of the things on that list a relevant by comparison.

[02:30] But what ends up happening is that we do the B plus problems all day because it makes

[02:35] us feel good because we know how to solve them.

[02:38] The A plus problem is usually one that's a little bit hairrier.

[02:41] It has more variables.

[02:42] It's more complex.

[02:43] We have to get into systems.

[02:44] We have to do more analysis.

[02:46] And then we have to iterate to figure out how to solve it.

[02:48] And so because of that, we prefer the fast, the fast dopamine or whatever you want to call

[02:53] it of solving the quick problem rather than solving the most important problem.

[02:58] So fundamentally, most people want to do a good job.

[03:01] I have found this from the people who work at my company, says that they want to do a good

[03:04] job.

[03:05] And so what they're afraid of is that if they have this problem that's underneath of their

[03:10] purview that you are going to yell at them and say, oh my God, look at these fires,

[03:18] right?

[03:19] But the thing is, is that if you just say, dude, there's this massive fire right here,

[03:24] that's burning and by far we'll burn everything to a crisp, far more than these itty

[03:29] bitty fires, well, that means that it's okay that these burn.

[03:34] And so when I do a prioritization, especially if it's a big turnaround thing or we got

[03:37] a turnaround around something like that, like this is the most important thing.

[03:39] The business, I set the agenda up front and I say, hey, as of this point, nothing that

[03:45] has happened before today and anyone is accountable for it.

[03:48] I will blame no one for anything.

[03:50] And so if I ask you in the future of this conversation, who made this or what made this

[03:55] happen, I am not asking to blame you.

[03:58] I'm asking so that I can understand the problem better so that we can solve it together.

[04:03] And by saying that's like as of this moment, there's amnesia from the past.

[04:07] No one here will be responsible.

[04:08] And so by doing that, after the pressure in the room, they're like, okay, we're on the

[04:12] same team and going forward, if you get and like, I think you have to be specific with

[04:17] this.

[04:18] It's like, John, if you get complaints from C.S. about this stuff, you're turnaround's

[04:21] being slow.

[04:22] That's okay.

[04:23] You can tell them, I said it's fine.

[04:26] Hey, Sarah, and legal.

[04:27] If you're having this issue and people are like, hey, we got to get these contracts

[04:31] on.

[04:32] Tell them, I said it's fine.

[04:34] And remember, I pay everybody's paychecks.

[04:37] And so at the end of the day, I'm the one who's got to sign it.

[04:39] And I'm telling you, it's okay.

[04:41] As hard as it is for you, because you guys all want to do a good job to let these fires burn,

[04:45] we have to flex.

[04:46] We have to focus on this one.

[04:47] Otherwise, this one's good to burn us to a crest.

[04:50] I was on call with one of my portfolio teams and it was a pay dad's team and they were

[04:53] having issues with pixel tracking.

[04:56] And this issue had been going on for three weeks and it was because everyone was distracted.

[05:00] Everyone was looking all these different funnels and pages and follow-up sequences.

[05:04] And fundamentally, if the pixel is not bringing in the right traffic, none of the conversion

[05:09] optimization ever will matter ever again.

[05:13] If the pixel gets worse and worse and worse, because we're seasoning it with worse data.

[05:16] And it's really like, what the hell is Alex talking about it?

[05:18] Don't worry, it's just paid-ad stuff.

[05:20] But fundamentally, if you're on a pay-ad team and you know what I'm talking about, if that

[05:23] is wrong, nothing else matters.

[05:25] And so the difficulty and this is what's tough is that you have to look at all the other

[05:30] problems and be like, oh yeah, all this stuff sucks.

[05:33] We're gonna ignore that because if we don't fix this, none of that matters.

[05:38] And even as I was going up and pulling up some of the pages, I was like, God, this is ugly.

[05:42] And I told I was like, this is so ugly.

[05:44] We should fix this.

[05:45] But we're not going to today because today we're going to fix this problem.

[05:50] We're going to fix the pixel.

[05:52] That's it.

[05:53] And once we fix the pixel in all of these seven funnels, once it's fixed, then we can go

[05:58] into the next thing.

[05:59] But the next thing, because if you reassess, you might find out that once you fix the

[06:04] pixel issue, some of your conversion issues might go away because maybe you're getting

[06:07] the right traffic in there, which is why you have to always reassess after doing the

[06:11] solution rather than trying to force feet like, I think these are the top 10.

[06:15] Would you put eight above seven?

[06:16] Who cares?

[06:17] You're not even going to work on it.

[06:18] You're just going to work on the one and then get that done.

[06:21] And then you will see with this new reality and this new context, which of these now will

[06:26] move the needle the most.

[06:27] So Frank Slutman, who is a three time IPO entrepreneur, talks about this in his management

[06:33] book where he basically focuses every company on only one thing.

[06:37] And so he says some companies have five objectives.

[06:38] Some companies have three objectives.

[06:40] His companies are only allowed to have one.

[06:42] Because once you do that one thing, and this is something that I have found from my

[06:46] experience is that let's say you had that list of five things to do.

[06:49] You have those five quote priorities.

[06:52] If you do the one that matters the most, what you will often find is that number two through

[06:57] five, sometimes one become a relevant.

[07:00] Other times, something over here actually all of a sudden becomes the next most important

[07:06] thing, which means that if you had done number three, number five, number two on your list

[07:11] and then done number one, then you figuratively would have wasted all of the time doing

[07:17] two three and five because by the time you did number one, it actually made those solutions

[07:21] relevant.

[07:22] Everything that I'm talking about right now is based on a concept that we call the theory

[07:25] of constraints.

[07:26] Which is that you have one thing in your business that is limiting your growth.

[07:30] It is the constraint of your growth.

[07:33] And once you deconstrained the business, the business will actually grow until the next

[07:38] constraint.

[07:39] And so if this is valuable for you, you can always go to acquisition.com.

[07:43] And this is obviously only for businesses that are doing over million bucks a year.

[07:47] So acquisition.com and see if you qualify for one of our workshops right now, the average

[07:51] workshop that attends does $3.5 million a year.

[07:54] So it's a decent size room, 25% over 5 million, 50% over 1 million.

[07:59] And so it's for legit business owners.

[08:01] We talk about this type of stuff that really moves the needle for businesses in a big

[08:06] way.

[08:07] Fundamentally, the goal of strategy, which is the big fancy word that people use, is to prioritize

[08:13] limited resources against unlimited opportunities.

[08:18] There are unlimited things that you could do to grow your business.

[08:21] You could run TikTok ads.

[08:22] You could run LinkedIn ads.

[08:23] You could run LinkedIn app ads.

[08:25] You could optimize your site.

[08:27] You could improve your sales conversions.

[08:28] There's a million things that you could do to grow your business.

[08:32] But there is one thing that can grow your business more than the others.

[08:36] And that one thing would pale or make everything else pale in comparison.

[08:41] And so when people are considered excellent strategists translate that into their excellent

[08:46] app prioritizing.

[08:47] But the real best strategists see all of the moves and probably some moves you don't

[08:52] see that maybe the number one thing on your list gets you a two X.

[08:55] But there's another move that has a number one that's a 10 X.

[08:59] And so fundamentally, you have to prioritize against all things you could do known and

[09:03] unknown.

[09:04] And the people who move the fastest in terms of distance covered are the ones who get

[09:08] the most for every unit of effort, which is not about how fast they do things, but how

[09:13] much speed they cover with the things they choose to do.

[09:16] And so let me give you a different analogy that you can think of with.

[09:19] So a lot of people have a little wheel on their car and they're thinking, how do I

[09:23] make this thing spin faster?

[09:25] They've got this little wheel and they're like, I just got to go round and round and round

[09:29] and round.

[09:31] But what they don't think about is that you could have a wheel.

[09:37] That's this big.

[09:38] And if you just do one revolution, you get more than this one does in 10.

[09:44] And so we want to just think, what is that one big wheel that if I just roll it once,

[09:50] it makes all of the wheel spins that I have on this tiny wheel around.

[09:54] So let's imagine you have your to-do list, right?

[09:57] You've got your one, you've got your two, you've got your three, that's a three, there you've

[10:00] got your four, you got your five.

[10:02] The thing is, is that most of the times these are B and C level problems because you know

[10:09] how to solve them.

[10:10] But this one is the A plus problem that you have no idea how to solve.

[10:16] And so we spend all day, every day just crossing these things off and then we are happy

[10:22] at the end of the day.

[10:24] But then we're sad at the end of the month because we still haven't solved the one big

[10:29] problem.

[10:30] And so you have to be comfortable with the idea that you might not solve it for one day,

[10:35] for two days or three days or four days.

[10:38] But if you do solve it on the fifth day, you get the A plus solution that gives you, it takes

[10:46] your wheel from a wheel that's this big, tool wheel that's this big.

[10:51] And from that point going forward, when you're rolling, you're getting that much more

[10:54] for every revolution.

[10:56] And so I want to make this super tactical for you.

[10:59] Once you've identified what the priority is, what the one thing that matters most is,

[11:04] then typically humans, us and your team will likely not want to do it.

[11:09] It's very much in our human nature to just continue to work less or less because it's easier.

[11:14] And so these are some tactics that I have done to pull the future forward.

[11:19] So number one, if you change the meetings from end of week to end of day or twice a day,

[11:24] you will communicate how much more important is you to get those things done.

[11:29] So if you have a weekly cadence for something that is the priority for the business,

[11:33] then you should be meeting far more than once a week, probably more than once a day.

[11:37] Number two, once you've determined that that is the priority and you have a cadence

[11:41] and deadline associated with that because you're getting feedback loops that are installed

[11:45] much faster, then you want to eliminate everything that's not that.

[11:49] Now they may sound obvious in retrospect, but it isn't in reality, especially if you have

[11:54] a team.

[11:55] And so the way that we eliminate is by saying everything that you are currently working on

[12:01] is not as important as this thing, which means you need to let some of these fires burn.

[12:08] Once you have set that deadline and you've eliminated everything else, then we've increased

[12:12] the frequency of communication.

[12:14] So obviously the meeting set little mini deadlines because you want to get things done by that.

[12:18] But in between communication also needs to ramp up.

[12:21] So if you check in on someone after an hour after meeting and say, hey, where are you at that,

[12:26] communicates a very different idea of the urgency around the priority or the problem that you're

[12:32] trying to solve.

[12:33] Now, once you have that communication loop in there, what you want to also do or that I

[12:38] have found effective is to make winning obvious, clear, and present publicly.

[12:46] So that means that if you have a dashboard, if you have a progress marker, a thermometer,

[12:51] something to show anytime someone sees it, the progress that is being made, it acts as

[12:55] a reinforcement loop for the entire team to get things done.

[13:00] And if you want to go real advanced mode, put a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow,

[13:05] saying once we fix the conversion rate on our page, then we will all get this thing together.

[13:11] And it could be, we all go out to dinner, it could be, hey, everybody gets the rest of

[13:14] the day off, whatever day we finish it.

[13:16] Like you can make the pot of gold, whatever you want.

[13:18] But it also shows what's in it for them.

[13:21] So it's easier to say committed than to stay committed, which is the only thing that matters.

[13:26] Now, as the boss, first in the beginning, your boss of you, but over time, if you develop

[13:32] a team, you become boss of other people.

[13:34] And so what I have found is that you can't just increase the priority, you need to also

[13:41] increase the commitment.

[13:42] And so commitment, I define it as the elimination of alternatives.

[13:47] And so let me give you a simple example.

[13:48] Marriage, the ultimate commitment, relationship wise, means that you eliminate every other

[13:53] person from your life, literally, who's not your wife or your husband, that you will ever

[13:58] date again.

[13:59] So you say, you're the only person I eliminate all others, and that is a commitment.

[14:04] If you're in health, if you want to commit fully to something, then it means you have to

[14:08] eliminate everything else, that is not that thing.

[14:11] So that's where you throw away all the food in your kitchen.

[14:13] That's not aligned with your goal.

[14:15] You pour out all the alcohol.

[14:16] You eliminate the alternative so that the only thing left is to do the thing that you

[14:21] committed to.

[14:23] And within the context of business, you have to eliminate everything that is not the priority.

[14:28] And the thing is is that it's very easy to say your committed.

[14:31] And I've noticed with my teammates, a lot of them were like, I'm committed, but it's very

[14:34] hard to show that you're committed.

[14:37] So if you want to teach this process to your team, this is how I think about it.

[14:41] Number one is you prioritize.

[14:42] You say, there's lots of things we could do, but if we just did this one thing,

[14:46] this would be the most important.

[14:48] The second thing that I do is I create urgency.

[14:50] So I say, this is very important.

[14:53] This is when we're going to be meeting about it.

[14:55] We have to get it done by this time.

[14:57] But you can't do that without also eliminating everything else that they have on their

[15:02] plates.

[15:03] It's not fair to say, hey, we're now just going to make this incredibly important thing

[15:06] that's due tomorrow, but you also stuff to do your normal work.

[15:09] It doesn't work.

[15:10] They're just like it's not going to work, especially on a continuous basis.

[15:12] And if you do one, two and three, then what's going to happen is that you will solve it.

[15:17] And you will solve it significantly faster than you thought because everyone will be

[15:20] focused on solving it.

[15:21] And everyone will get out of the way to make sure that it gets done.

[15:26] And then you look at your list and you reassess.

[15:30] And then you reprioritize.

[15:32] You set the new urgency.

[15:34] You eliminate everything else and you keep going.

[15:36] And the difference between a bad strategist and a good strategist just comes down to the

[15:41] thing that they choose to believe is the most important.

[15:44] So this is how I applied this forced process to pay to add to team that I was talking

[15:47] about earlier.

[15:48] So first off, I said, okay, here are all the things that are wrong with our marketing.

[15:52] And then I said, and we're going to ignore all of them except for the pixel issue.

[15:57] Then I said, okay, we're going to meet end of day to day because this was first thing in

[16:02] the morning.

[16:03] People were like, well, I have a meeting right now.

[16:04] I was like, oh, yeah, is it with me?

[16:06] They're like, oh, no, no, I was like, well, should I?

[16:09] I was like, yeah, don't be on the meeting.

[16:11] And I was like, and if someone gives you a problem, tell them they can talk to me.

[16:16] Then I said, then also means that whatever you're regularly doing for the day, it's not

[16:21] that, it's now this.

[16:23] And then we went through every single line item of what had to happen for the pixel to get

[16:29] fixed.

[16:30] And we assigned every single line item to each person.

[16:32] And I said, how long do you think this will take?

[16:34] How long do you think this will take?

[16:35] How long do you think this will take?

[16:37] And by the way, I'm asking, I'm not asking for days here.

[16:39] I'm asking for minutes and hours.

[16:41] All right.

[16:41] And by the time we're done, it's like great.

[16:43] So it looks like we can get all this stuff done in the next six hours.

[16:47] So we're going to meet again at 430 today.

[16:49] So that all of you guys can show off your work and I can tell you how great of a job you

[16:52] did.

[16:53] Then at the end of this, I said, okay, no, every single person tell me back what you're

[16:58] going to do now.

[17:00] And so here's what's interesting.

[17:02] People came back and they said something and it wasn't what I said.

[17:05] So I said, let me say it again.

[17:06] You're going to do this.

[17:07] You're going to do this.

[17:08] And this is going to be right here.

[17:10] Say it back to me.

[17:11] And they said it's like right, right, it down.

[17:13] And then I go back to the person, ask him again.

[17:15] Once everyone gets it right, great.

[17:17] We're going to meet in a few hours.

[17:19] I'll see you then.

[17:20] At the time of me making this video right now, I'm between the calls, which is why I'm so

[17:24] fired up.

[17:25] So once we get on the call, once the pixels fixed, guess what we're going to do?

[17:29] We're going to look at the next thing on that big old list and say, all right, we had

[17:32] 20 other things we need to do.

[17:34] But tomorrow, we're going to work on this one and we're going to solve that.

[17:37] And the thing is, is that so many businesses, what they have, and there's this great analogy

[17:41] for this, is that they have this graveyard of half built bridges.

[17:48] They never get to the other side of the river because they never finished the bridge.

[17:55] And so the thing is, is that the company is spending resources, building all of these

[18:00] bridges, putting these bricks here.

[18:03] But they never get one of these dollars across to the other side into their bank account.

[18:07] And so this is honestly where most businesses lose all their money is building these

[18:12] half built bridges because no one focuses on completing their work.

[18:16] So we had a portfolio company that had a shop rate issue.

[18:21] And so they had a sales event that they ran regularly in order to turn prospects into customers.

[18:28] And so we noticed that they were getting a very low percentage of their prospects to

[18:32] shop.

[18:33] Now, they were complaining about lead quality, things like that.

[18:36] And so we said, okay, if we only got the industry standard benchmark of leads to shop

[18:43] to this event, we would increase the revenue of this business by 35%.

[18:48] And given the margin of this business, let's say, is 10%, we would more than triple the

[18:52] profit of this business.

[18:54] Is there anything else we could do with the resources we have?

[18:58] That would give us that kind of a return, a tripling of profit for no risk in the next 30

[19:05] days.

[19:06] And since the answer was no, then we said, great, everyone in this company, the only priority

[19:11] that you have is to get this number to go up.

[19:14] And so then we did a number of things to make that one percentage go up.

[19:19] And as a result of that focus, the business did grow by more than 35%.

[19:25] Because every single person in the company was aligned with it.

[19:28] And guess what also happened?

[19:30] Other things fell by the wayside.

[19:32] Other things that were not as important started to burn.

[19:35] We had little customer service issues, we had little issues in the sales department.

[19:39] These were all little things that normally would have taken away from the team's focus

[19:44] on that one thing.

[19:46] But because prioritization is so powerful, if you get the one thing right, it makes the

[19:52] rest of it irrelevant.

[19:53] The thing about doing easy problems is that they're so tempting.

[19:58] Because we all want to have that quick win.

[20:00] We want to have one or two wins.

[20:01] Hey, I want to get momentum going.

[20:02] But what ends up happening is that you eat half your day.

[20:05] And then you get a couple calls, a couple interruptions.

[20:07] And then the day is going.

[20:08] And the next day, you still have that number one that's sitting at the top.

[20:10] But you filled up with two or three more easy wins.

[20:13] And you never get the big wins to happen.

[20:16] That continuous parade of little wins never moves the ball forward.

[20:22] You never get the breakthroughs.

[20:23] You never get the growth.

[20:25] A big part of why those eight plus problems are the big, hairy problems is because they're

[20:32] soaked in the unknown.

[20:34] We don't know how to solve them.

[20:37] And so I want to give you this frame of understanding that I have, which is when you have

[20:43] these other things underneath, two through five on that list, you typically know what you need

[20:47] to start doing, how it's going to go, and what it's going to look like at the end.

[20:52] The number one problem, you typically don't know where to start, and you don't know what to

[20:56] do, and you don't know how it's going to end.

[20:58] But you know that if big picture, if you solve that one thing, everything else would be a

[21:02] relevant.

[21:03] And so part of beginning to solve that problem is learning to understand the problem itself.

[21:10] And so you can't feel like you're not making progress when you're trying to understand

[21:14] it and wrap your arms around it.

[21:16] And so there's an old saying with, how do you eat an elephant?

[21:19] You eat it one bite at a time.

[21:20] And so you just have to start pulling the thread, which is how that's my term.

[21:23] It's like, I just start pulling the thread and see what comes.

[21:27] And then as I pull the thread, my next pull becomes more and more obvious to me.

[21:31] But you don't know what the next pull is.

[21:33] You don't know what the next step looks like until you take the first step and the reason

[21:37] we don't is because it's unknown.

[21:38] Long term, you want to make sure the team understands what the priority is, and that's what

[21:43] you're doing is the boss.

[21:44] But if you want to have faster communication cycles and more people immediately aligned with

[21:49] the priority of the business, then what you, and this is something that Leyla and I've worked

[21:53] a lot on is increasing information transparency across the company.

[21:57] That's a lot of big words.

[21:58] But it basically just means that you want everyone to know the same stuff.

[22:02] Because if everyone knows the same stuff, the financials, the conversion rates, how we make.

[22:06] Money, the profit margins, then everyone else has the same information.

[22:10] Now, that might freak you out as an entrepreneur.

[22:12] But I remember when I was listening to Sam Walton's autobiography.

[22:16] He talked about one of the big fears that he had was like showing all the financials.

[22:19] You guess what the biggest companies in the world are, publicly traded.

[22:23] And every single employee can see every single thing you could possibly imagine about the

[22:28] company, and yet they still function.

[22:30] And so it is 100% an irrational fear that entrepreneurs keep by thinking that no one should

[22:37] know.

[22:38] And so I have over time continued to loosen up my, my, you know, white knuckle grip on information

[22:46] because the more people who know everything, the more people who can help me solve the

[22:49] problems.

[22:50] If you were to come tomorrow and say, guys, this is the priority.

[22:53] Like, we're got to do this.

[22:55] A lot of people will get overwhelmed because they don't know because you also told them

[22:59] something last week and the week before was also a priority and they're not done doing that

[23:03] yet.

[23:04] And so one of the practices that I'd like to do is to pull up their agenda and say, show

[23:09] me everything you're working on right now.

[23:11] Okay.

[23:12] Because you'll find out that some things you asked them for two months ago that they

[23:15] might still be working on and even if they're not working on it's taking their attention

[23:19] because they know they're not working on it.

[23:20] They think they should be working on it.

[23:22] You're like, I totally forgot even asked you to do that.

[23:24] Oh, we solved that other problem already in the other department, which makes this problem

[23:28] now relevant.

[23:29] So, sorry about that.

[23:30] If you have more frequent loops where you can look at that list and say, oh, no, this

[23:34] is more important than this.

[23:35] Don't worry about that.

[23:36] Don't worry about that.

[23:37] This is when we can do with next week table it.

[23:40] This is what I want you to work on.

[23:41] And this is how it starts.

[23:43] You can give so much less anxiety around the work, so much clear direction and it gives

[23:48] you the opportunity to give out out of boys the moment they do it.

[23:51] And if this is going to help you make more money in your business, here's two more

[23:54] videos like this that I'll help you make even more.

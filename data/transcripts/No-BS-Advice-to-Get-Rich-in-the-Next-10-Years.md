[00:00] I hit $100 million net worth at age 31, but before that, I lost all my money twice.

[00:06] And the difference between me losing all my money at the first two times, and now, are these rules.

[00:11] So this is no-be-a-sadvice for making money and keeping it. Number one, passive income is a lie.

[00:17] If you think about how money is made, you make money during time because every minute

[00:22] we're alive, a minute passes, time passes, and we make money over that time period,

[00:27] which means every single person on planet earth has a dollar's per hour that they make.

[00:32] And so it's not that passive income doesn't exist, just as much as active income doesn't exist.

[00:37] It's a spectrum where it's how active is it, or how passive is the activity that I'm doing

[00:45] relative to the time that I'm investing. And so I would eliminate active versus passive, and simply

[00:50] say, what is my return on time or how much do I make per hour? It's just that most people get really

[00:56] scared of that because like no one should trade their hours for money, everyone trades their hours

[01:00] for money. It's just that when they receive the money, it's just not denoted in hours.

[01:05] And so I think there's two downstream impacts in terms of changing your behavior around this

[01:08] that I had to apply. Number one is that I was obsessed with trying to find quick, easy, low,

[01:16] effort money things. And so I ended up spending tons of money on things that I was obsessed with,

[01:23] hoping would cost me no time to make. And I would put not nearly enough time to the things I was

[01:29] actively making money with and thinking, how could I just make my active income significantly higher?

[01:36] And I would get obsessed with the idea that everything I did actively had to be scalable or

[01:43] wasn't worth it because if it's not scalable, then why why should I bother? I shouldn't trade my

[01:49] money. But if I looked at what I was making over the last year and divided it by the amount of money

[01:54] I made per hour, this activity was 15 times what I was averaging per hour. So I should absolutely do as

[02:01] many hours of that until all of my hours are that. And then I should find something else I can

[02:06] trade my time for that's even higher. And so if you want a very humbling experience, look at how much

[02:12] you made last year and then divide it by 2000, if you want to know how much you made just in a 40-hour

[02:18] work week. Now, if you want to look at how much you made per actual hour of being alive, you can divide

[02:24] it by around 8,000 or just take that number and divide it by four. And that's actually how much you

[02:30] make per hour. And so when you're looking at is this worth my time, if it's more than that number,

[02:36] it probably is. And so what I should have done and what changed for me was that I stopped trying to

[02:41] invest my money from my active and to try to find more passive things and try to say how do I

[02:48] invest my money more into my active to multiply my active that I know is working. Number two, if you

[02:53] can't buy twice, don't buy it once. Or even buy it three times or four times or five times over,

[02:59] don't buy it once. And the way that really shifted how I started spending money or rather started

[03:04] saving money and not spending money was when I started looking at how much time it took me to make

[03:11] the amount of money post tax to buy whatever I wanted. And I remember this clear as day, I was working

[03:17] at Smoothie King as a blender tender and I was making $6.75 an hour and I just got in a race from

[03:23] $6.25 an hour of dating myself. Anyways, and while I was there, the co-workers that I had and I would

[03:30] always go to lunch next door at Kosey, which was like a sandwich shop. And it was like 13 bucks

[03:36] for a sandwich, right, and a drink and chips and whatever. And so I remember looking at my check

[03:40] in my $6.75 an hour after taxes and fees was like six bucks an hour and I was like, man,

[03:46] I gave up two hours of my six hour shift, every shift to go by lunch. And I was like, I'm

[03:53] literally giving a third of my earning away for lunch every single day. If I knew that I had to work

[03:59] the first two hours just to get the sandwich, I don't think I'd ever make that trade. And yet I was

[04:04] making it every day. And then I started thinking I'd go to the mall and like, oh, do you want

[04:08] a new shirt? And it was at the gap and it was 30 bucks and I was like, okay, we'll shoot. That's a whole

[04:13] shift. And I was like, what I work, a whole shift, if someone just held up a shirt that I didn't need

[04:18] to do it. And I was like, I don't think I would. And so all of a sudden it started shifting how my

[04:23] buying had me because I started feeling the pain associated with what it would take if I had to do

[04:29] that before getting the thing I was going to buy and it completely changed my buying behavior.

[04:35] And to be very clear, saving money won't make you money. But saving money allows you to have money

[04:42] and having money allows you to look further out. And when you look further out, you can take

[04:47] on bigger risks, which absolutely will make you more money. And when you're looking at the price of

[04:51] whatever the thing you're trying to buy is, obviously when I was a teenager looking at a shirt,

[04:55] I was looking at, okay, I'm making six bucks an hour, a shirts 30 bucks. But when you're in

[04:59] adult, and you're making a hundred dollars an hour, and you're looking at a 500 or a thousand

[05:03] dollar purchase, would you work two days in order to do that? I don't know. What I probably not.

[05:10] And sometimes you think, hey, is what I work all day for two days to go out with the boys for three

[05:16] hours on Saturday? I probably like, guys, I'm not going to work for two days just to go have three

[05:22] hours of fun, right? That feel like I'd rather just not work the two days. And that was the thing,

[05:27] is whenever I had the wide rather just not work than do that thing, then I was like, I shouldn't buy

[05:32] that thing. For example, when I was poor, I only spent cash. And so my easiest way of actually creating

[05:38] a budget was that I had a personal training client who paid me $2,000 a month in cash. And so a

[05:43] hundred percent of my money that came in through the business and credit cards and everything else

[05:46] is just what went into my bank account. And the only thing I knew I could live on was it was

[05:50] it was inside of my wallet. And so as that got replenished, and the thing is is that I'm so scared

[05:54] with money or I was so frugal with money that I would always make sure that I had more than that

[06:00] to make it for the next payment because sometimes the guy would take a day or two, you pay on Wednesday

[06:04] rather than a Monday or whatever, and I need to make sure that I food for July. Three, most people

[06:08] overestimate with it can accomplish in a year and the underestimate with it can accomplish in a decade.

[06:12] And every new employee that I have that walks into acquisition.com, the number one thing that they say

[06:18] they want is growth. And I have this talk with them, which is the 10-year million dollar contract.

[06:23] But it's less about the million dollars and more about take whatever your net worth is now

[06:28] and add a zero to it. Or add two zeroes to it. You can accomplish that in a decade. If you look

[06:33] at the biggest companies in the entire world who were worth multiple billions from their

[06:38] inception until the time they're worth multiple billions, many times it's under 10 years. But it's

[06:42] still more than five, more than seven. And so you can accomplish life-changing, crazy amounts of wealth

[06:50] in a decade. And so if you could write a contract to yourself and say, I will make no money for 10

[06:56] years. But on the 10th year, I will add a zero or two zeroes or three zeroes to my net worth.

[07:03] Would you do it? And if the answer is yes, which it almost invariably is with every person who

[07:07] comes into my business, then I say great. Now act like it. And so if you knew that you would make this

[07:13] amount of money over that period of time, you would stop this obsession. Myself included, this is

[07:17] me giving my advice to my self-elostate twice. When I was able to shift to, okay, what would I have

[07:25] to do there to make it unreasonable that I don't 10x in 10 years? Then all of a sudden I started

[07:30] making very reasonable bets that I knew would compound unto itself over that period of time.

[07:36] And then winning became inevitable rather than a game of chance. And so oftentimes you have

[07:42] potential earning and then actualized earning. And usually as you're realizing the potential earning

[07:48] you have, you're usually losing out on your investing into that potential, right? You're realizing

[07:54] the potential. And that's kind of like the kid that learns one skill. And then immediately says,

[07:58] I'm going to start a business opportunity around this one skill that makes me $5,000 a month.

[08:02] Or they have this one skill and say, hey, this company is willing to pay me $100,000 a year

[08:08] to go do this skill where I have this other company that will give me a free internship where I

[08:12] could 10x my potential earning in three years. But I'm going to make $35,000 a year,

[08:19] fourth, three years. Which one would you take? The problem is most people will take the $100,000

[08:25] now and for go the investment in self. And that's the thing is we are the asset that we invest in

[08:31] and the currency we invest into ourselves in is time, experience and skills, right? Skills the

[08:37] the time in the effort is what we put into it to gain the experiences which ultimately give us

[08:41] the skills. But if you're in an environment where you're not compounding your potential earning,

[08:46] then you're actually losing out long term, you're ripping up your $1 million or your 10x or

[08:52] 100x contract for a decade from now so you can get the short fast money today. And that's why

[08:57] in the early days when you have limited amounts of money but lots of time and energy instead of

[09:01] putting your money in the S&P 500, I like to say put in the S&P 500 because the asset that is

[09:08] you will always beat the stock market. Number four, you should only have to get rich once. In

[09:14] other words, don't bet what you have in need for something you don't have and don't need. And some

[09:20] of the gravest mistakes I made manifested in, for example, me getting into a partnership that I

[09:25] should have gotten into because I wanted even more faster. Now when you get into a partnership

[09:31] which is usually the time where you put the most risk on the table. One is you guarantee the

[09:35] largest decrease in your earning part. You pay with the most expensive thing you have which is equity

[09:41] to somebody else. And so people get obsessive about what they're, you know, 5% 10% later when

[09:47] we're making money. But day one they're like, all right, we cut the pine half up, we cut the pie

[09:51] into thirds, right up front before anything's really happened. If you work with a partner or decide

[09:57] to partner up with somebody, one of your friends, one of your coworkers. This is coming for

[09:59] the study has nine failed partnerships. Before I met Laila and then that has now worked and now

[10:05] have successful partnerships. A partner needs to have one of these three things that you do not

[10:10] have. Either have to have money that you don't have and then the clear contribution is that money,

[10:15] they need to have experience you don't have and the clear contribution is that experience or

[10:21] number three, they have time and energy that you don't have and the clear contribution is that

[10:25] time and energy. And so I added that second part on is that just because someone has experience,

[10:29] if they're not contributing it to the partnership clearly, then you're still not going to get the

[10:33] benefit from it. If they have the time and the energy, but it's not clearly to find how they're

[10:37] going to invest that time and energy into the things you both get a return, then it's not going to be

[10:41] a good partnership. And I've lost so much money in partnerships, especially early on, one of my

[10:46] two big losses was from a partner. And a big part of it was I was insecure and I thought I just

[10:52] had to have somebody else because I was afraid to do it on my own. Real quick, if you're trying

[10:56] to make your first dollar online, you can go to school.com for slash games. We've got a whole system

[11:00] that set up. It's a platform. You can start it for free. I've got instructional videos. I take a

[11:05] call every single week. And so if you do do that, you can hop on the call on Monday and I'll say how

[11:09] to you just let me know that you're brand new. If you are a business owner and you're trying to

[11:14] scale and you're doing a million bucks a year and you want to go bigger, go to acquisition.com,

[11:18] hit scale and we'd love to see if we could help you out at one of the workshops we run here in Vegas.

[11:25] Which brings me number five. If you never learn to manage your time, you're never going to land

[11:29] to manage your money. And so the thing is is that all of us obviously have equal amounts of time

[11:33] that were given, not necessarily in life, but at least every day. And so the people who get the best

[11:39] returns on their money are the ones who learn how to best invest their time. And so a big misconception

[11:45] on money is that money, in my opinion, is an encapsulated version of time. And since all of us trade

[11:51] time for the money that we get, then it means for each person money represents a certain amount of

[11:56] time. And the wealthier you get is just that the determination of money represents less time for you.

[12:02] And so for someone else, a hundred dollars may represent four hours. For a wealthier person,

[12:08] a hundred dollars may represent four minutes. And so it's a constant appraisal that you do on a

[12:14] regular basis looking on your calendar and saying, what things do I have here that I could trade my

[12:19] time for for more money? And so again, this video is about making money overall. I'm not saying

[12:25] that you can't spend time with your girl. But there is a transaction cost for that time. And as

[12:30] long as you're willing to make the trade, then trade it all day. But the bad trades are the one

[12:34] that when you actually think about it in terms of what it costs, you'd say I wouldn't do the trade.

[12:39] That's a bad deal. And so over time, if you continue to trade up how much time you invest for what

[12:46] it makes you, you will always make more in your income year after year after year. Number six,

[12:52] check your bank account before you check social media first thing in the morning. And if it

[12:57] hurts you to check your bank account first thing, then you need to do it even more. Because for me,

[13:03] I started not knowing where my money was going. And so I had a friend who was like, dude, just look.

[13:10] And I honestly had anxiety looking at my bank account looking at what money was going out and all that

[13:15] kind of stuff. And so I started making that habit and I had to confront it. But the crazy thing is,

[13:20] as I started looking at my money, as I started paying attention to my money, my money started

[13:26] paying attention to me and hanging around. And so Peter Drucker said, what gets measured gets

[13:32] managed. And so one of the most fascinating things that I found with human behavior in any kind of

[13:37] change is that the first thing that you can do to improve any metric for any skill is to actually

[13:44] measure it. And so if you want to lose weight, if you weigh yourself every day, no, how

[13:48] matter, how painful the number is, that intervention alone helps people lose weight. You don't even

[13:53] have to talk about diet. You don't have to tell someone to exercise. If they look at the

[13:56] scale every day, they become aware of it. And when you become aware of it, and when you become a

[13:59] aware of it, you start consciously or subconsciously making moves to change it. You have that

[14:04] hesitation before you put that food in your mouth. You have that hesitation before you take your

[14:07] wallet out when you're looking at your banking on every day. It doesn't matter what it is,

[14:11] whatever you're trying to improve, but look at it, confront reality, and then reality will start to

[14:16] improve. And if your career is how long do you still check your bank end every day? And out

[14:21] the honest truth is, I stopped checking when we have about 20 million bucks. And so that started

[14:26] when I had in the hundreds to thousand dollars and continued to check every day. And when I stopped

[14:31] checking it, it was then I realized my daily fluctuations in market movements and things like

[14:37] that across my assets. I basically wasn't able to really see it on a daily basis. So I had to

[14:44] start extending my time horizon for when I would check it. So it would be monthly or quarterly

[14:48] that I started checking it. Because that way, at least, I know I should have some movement

[14:52] upwards. And that is something that if you've done checking your bank account every single day

[14:58] four years, you start to already have developed some of those disciplined skills, which then

[15:04] you can delay gratification of having saved money for a day to having saved money for a quarter.

[15:09] Number seven, learn how to make money before you start trying to learn how to make money make money.

[15:15] So I see so many guys, especially young guys who are like, I've got a thousand bucks, how do I

[15:20] invest the thousand dollars to try and figure out a way to get that thousand dollars to compound?

[15:24] They put into a compound and calculator and they're like, man, if I get 50% returns for the

[15:29] next 40 years, I'm going to be a billionaire. But the thing is, is that one, it's most likely that you're

[15:34] going to buy a fucking doge coin and then it's going to tank and then you're just going to lose

[15:37] your thousand dollars and be like, wow, think about this. I just worked for two weeks or one

[15:42] month to save that thousand dollars and I lost it in seconds. So alternatively, if you take that

[15:48] thousand dollars and you put it into, how do I make more money? How do I actively improve the

[15:54] actions and skills that I have that will get you far more and that is where you invest the time

[15:59] rather than how do I make money make money? Because let's be real, you don't have much. So take the money

[16:04] you have into the skill, the flow of making more money rather than trying to take this tiny thing

[16:09] and going from a 10% return to a 20% return. Because the hundred bucks extra that you yield on

[16:14] that thousand dollars, I promise you, if you learn how to add 50% to your skill set, it'll take

[16:19] whatever your annual earning is up by 50%. And that's going to be a hell of a lot more than 10.

[16:24] And that's assuming everything goes up this year, which one out of four years it doesn't.

[16:28] When you say you don't have time, just immediately think to yourself, I'm lying, this is bullshit.

[16:35] Because every single person has between five to nine a.m. and five to nine p.m. every day the week

[16:40] even if you have a 40 hour job, even if you're a full-time student, because everybody has those eight

[16:46] hours per day. Now the thing is is that we're not willing to make the trade-offs because we have

[16:50] these things that make us comfortable. Cool. If you reframe that thing as the thing that makes

[16:54] me comfortable today, it's the thing that's going to make me uncomfortable for a decade,

[16:58] all of a sudden the cost of that comfort goes up. And so then it flips to, if I can become

[17:03] uncomfortable for a day, I can be comfortable for decades. And so then you can seek out those eight

[17:08] hours and say, you know what, I'm going to flip this thing. And here's the crazy part about work.

[17:12] Work makes you money in two ways. One, you work in you make money. And secondly, when you're working,

[17:18] you're not spending money. And so when you're starting out, you literally have a double effect.

[17:23] The money that you're making the whole way through is stacking up because there's no drains on it

[17:27] either. And so one of the biggest advantages you have is that you stay busy. One of the keys to

[17:32] investing is patience. What is patience? Patience is figuring out activities to do in the meantime.

[17:39] Think about it. Four a second. Unpack that. Patience is figuring out what to do in the meantime.

[17:44] So then if the goal is to get rich and we know that that takes time and it takes time for money to

[17:51] compound and grow, then what you do in the meantime is that you work so that you have even more

[17:57] money to invest and that money has the time to invest in compound while you're working. And I,

[18:03] I'm so passionate about this because this isn't something that I didn't do. Right? Like when I

[18:08] had my job in the beginning, I just wasn't really taking the time that I should have. And then I was like,

[18:12] you know what? I don't want to do this thing forever. I got to get ahead. But I couldn't stop doing my job.

[18:17] So I started spending my mornings and my evenings every day and both weekend days working on what I was

[18:22] going to do next. And in the beginning, that was studying for the GMACs I thought business school was

[18:26] going to be the next move. But after studying for the GMAC and crushing the test, I came to another

[18:31] realization, which was, I'm going to go to business school because I want to start a business,

[18:34] well, you know what? It's going to cost me less than two years and $180,000,

[18:39] plus what I didn't make during the two years of not working, I could probably net $10,000 a year

[18:45] of income, which is with the average business school person graduated with when I was looking at

[18:49] business school. And I was like, I think I could get to 10 grand a month if I had two years to work

[18:53] and didn't spend 180 grand and I took that money and just put it into a business. Now you're like,

[18:58] well, you didn't even have 180 grand. You're damn right. I didn't. I was able to save up 50.

[19:01] And I was like, I think with this 50, I'll be able to spend it to learn enough to make 10 grand a

[19:05] a month. And that's what I did. Nine, if you don't know how you can lose money in something,

[19:10] then you're going to lose it. Think about this for a second. If something looks amazing,

[19:14] and you're like, dude, there's no way I can lose money on this. You're absolutely going to

[19:18] lose your ass because of how little you actually know. And so you have to figure out one,

[19:23] what is my downside? And all the different ways that downside can occur. And then attach a reasonable

[19:29] likelihood that that happens. And then probably multiply it by three. Because whenever you have

[19:35] your rose color glasses on, you're an entrepreneur or you want to be an entrepreneur. One of the

[19:39] quintessential traits of entrepreneurship is optimism. We are optimists. We think it's all going

[19:43] to work out. And you have to have that level of optimism to start. But when you start, you can't

[19:49] continue to have that optimism around every other opportunity because then you are going to lose

[19:53] your ass because you're going to be split between multiple things. And so if you don't know how

[19:58] you can lose money, you absolutely will because it just is a index of how little you know.

[20:05] 10. The biggest cost that you have is ignorance. So every single month you've got your rent,

[20:12] you've got your food, you've got your clothes, you've got your car, you've got whatever else you spend.

[20:16] And you think that's my fixed costs. Years ago, I was sitting in the audience and I saw a

[20:20] man write a million dollars on a whiteboard. And he called someone from the audience. He said,

[20:24] how much do you make per year? And they said $50,000 a year. And he said, would you like to make a

[20:28] million dollars a year? And the person said yes. And then he put a minus sign and he said,

[20:33] did you know that it's costing you $950,000 per year to not know how to make a million dollars a year?

[20:39] And it was such a light bulb moment for me that I realized that the cost of ignorance is the

[20:45] difference between what your goals are and what you have today. Because if you knew how to achieve

[20:50] your goals, the difference is the value of that education. And conversely, the difference is the

[20:57] cost of that debt of ignorance. And so the number one priority in my life has always been to

[21:03] pay down ignorance as fast as I possibly could using whatever currency I needed to. So if that was

[21:08] relational capital, that means using my network or doing favors for people or paying money,

[21:13] which is the least efficient way of doing it, I would try and find a way that I could pay down

[21:17] ignorance to achieve the things that I wanted. So I could get the information so I could get the

[21:20] learning. When I started, I paid to get into rooms. I paid $25,000, $35,000 and you're like, wait,

[21:26] I don't have that right now. I get it. Well, you pay $10,000 was the first thing I ever bought

[21:30] that was information based. That's what I was the first thing I ever invested. And how was I able to

[21:34] do that? Because I'd saved for two years and I'd saved 50 grand up. And so for me, I was like,

[21:38] okay, this is the direction I'm going in. I'm an invest in learning. And when I got in that room,

[21:43] the first room I was in was a Jim owner room and I didn't have a Jim. And I paid to be in that room,

[21:47] so I could start the Jim the right way. When I paid to the $25,000 room, it was in an

[21:51] and a networking room. And guess what? I didn't have an internet marketing business. But I paid there,

[21:55] so I could try and learn how to do it the right way. Rather than try and start the wrong way,

[21:58] and have to fix it. And so I think a lot of people wait too long to try and learn. I was want to grab

[22:03] my future and pull it towards me. And so I was willing to spend as much money as I had available to me

[22:09] to make those bets because it was a bet on me. And I knew I would never lose that. You can't lose

[22:13] you. You always have diamond hands on you. Like till the day you die, you've got you. And so the thing is

[22:19] about investing in education is that sometimes the lessons you learn aren't the lessons you expect to

[22:23] learn, but you learn them them the last. And so sometimes you go into an education thing and you don't

[22:27] get what you thought, but you still get something and it was still more than what you paid. And so when

[22:31] I went to those rooms, I'd already used up on my money to get in the room, so I was like, okay,

[22:35] what else do I have? And so at the time, I knew how to sell. And so I just went to every single

[22:39] person in the room and was like, can I help you sell stuff? And so they'd be like, well, sure,

[22:44] my sales team socks are sure, my my script socks are sure, my offer socks are, I don't know

[22:48] how to overcome these objections. And so I would spend an hour, two hours, three hours on the phone

[22:53] with these people training their teams, writing scripts. And they were like, dude, thanks so much.

[22:57] This is way, I can't believe you did all this. And the thing is is that if you're going to pay

[23:02] for help from someone, pay in full, don't half ass a free gift. And so if you're good at something,

[23:10] you're good at a skill, you're in a accountant. You don't do one page of someone's taxes. If you're

[23:15] going to do a favor, you do the whole thing. You treat them like they're a paying customer. And then

[23:20] they were respond as though you have paid them. And so it will be like you've given the money and

[23:25] then you will get that reciprocity. And at the time when I did those favors for all those people,

[23:29] I didn't know what I was going to ask for. I just knew that I would need someone's help in the

[23:33] room. And I'd rather have more phone numbers I could call for help that owed me one than none.

[23:38] And when I wanted to make a webinar, I called one of the people who's good at webinars. When I

[23:42] wanted to run ads, I called the guy who's really good at running ads. When I wanted to figure out

[23:47] funnels and landing pages, stuff I called the guy who was really good at funnels and landing pages.

[23:51] Because each of those guys wasn't good at what I was good at. And so we're able to barter,

[23:54] which by the way, still to this day is the most efficient form of trade. Because Uncle

[23:59] Sam, don't take any piece of it. For us or them, everybody wins. 11. There's two types of things

[24:06] that you can learn. And so if you're trying to pay down ignorance, you got to know what you're buying.

[24:10] So you can learn about something, something that exists that you didn't know existed. And then you

[24:16] can learn how to do something. And so one is called declarative knowledge, knowledge of existence.

[24:22] The other is called procedural knowledge, which is knowing how to do it. And so if I explained to you

[24:26] that private equity exists, and this is how you can buy, package, and sell a business for a lot of

[24:30] money, now you know about it. Which is a prerequisite for learning how to do it. And so when you buy

[24:37] into access to networks, to people, to relationships, the primary thing that you're learning is

[24:42] learning about things that exist. They're going to tell you tax strategies, investment strategy,

[24:47] marketing strategy, sales strategies, business models that you haven't heard of. That is what you

[24:52] learn there. But if they tell you those things, you leave and you get excited. But then you're like,

[24:56] well, how do I do it? Which is the second thing that you learn how to do, which is the how part.

[25:01] And so when you're going into any kind of investment, whether you're investing time,

[25:05] you're investing trade, you're doing some work for someone so they do work for you back,

[25:09] or you're investing money, you better be sure what you're buying. And the interesting thing

[25:14] about those two types of knowledge is that the declarative knowledge tends to teach you things

[25:18] that you didn't know existed. It's the unknown unknowns. That is why some of these are the

[25:24] biggest breakthroughs when you get into those rooms to someone making 10 or 100 times more. They

[25:28] see the world on it for a while. Whereas when you go for how to, it's more predictable what you're

[25:33] going to get because you're specifically trying to learn how the skills you know exist and you

[25:37] just need to clarify the steps to getting there. And so just delineating what you're trying to learn

[25:42] will help you actually learn it. So the first time I learned declarative knowledge was that Facebook

[25:47] adds existed, 2021 and so I learned how they how they worked and I learned just enough to make

[25:53] them work. So I learned declarative knowledge that they existed and I learned how to do them in one

[25:57] weekend. Super valuable. Now I was able to ride that skill set for a couple of years until I was like,

[26:03] you know what, I need to learn how to do this at a bigger scale. I wanted to go national with

[26:07] started gym lunch to the turn rounds and so I was like, I need somebody because I don't

[26:10] only run low clutch which by the way, are much easier than national silettes. And so I tried to go

[26:14] all around asking people, and at this point I'd probably used up the relational capital that

[26:19] had before. So I called a bunch of agencies, all of them said they were going to charge me too much

[26:23] money that I could afford. And then finally I just asked one guy, hey, instead of your monthly rate

[26:28] of $5,000 a month, which I couldn't even come close to a forting at the time, I was like,

[26:31] can I just pay you per hour? Now of course, he said, I don't trade my time for money,

[26:36] except of course he works over time and then he gets money later. But sure, anyways,

[26:40] he doesn't trade time for money. When I said, it's America, everything's got a price.

[26:44] And he said, you know what, 7.15 hour, I'll do it. And I was like, done,

[26:49] now I mind you, 7.15 hour, we're still ton of money for me. And so I showed up like it was

[26:52] Harvard on steroids for these calls, because I would prep for the call, I have my notes out,

[26:56] I recorded it, I was like, had two people there and be like, make sure I don't miss anything.

[27:00] Right? And so I would go and I had him first document the process of what he did to run ads

[27:08] as though he were me. Then I had him demonstrate it. So he clicked the buttons, so I could see

[27:13] what he was doing and I had him stop and explained to me each of the steps so I could put it into

[27:17] my little checklist too. And then finally, I duplicated in front of him, which means document,

[27:21] demonstrate duplicated. I then did in front of him to make sure that I was doing it right. And so once

[27:26] I did it right, and I did it right multiple times in a row, and I didn't need him to correct me

[27:31] while I was doing it, that's when I had matched to the skill. It took me eight sessions. So it took me

[27:36] eight hours and whatever that is, time 750 in order to learn. 12, a watch isn't going to replace

[27:43] work. A Rolex isn't going to replace reality. And so what happens a lot of times when you're coming

[27:48] up is that you want to get status, right? You feel downtroddy, you feel like known respects you,

[27:53] and that's normal as a young man. That's what you do. You don't have any status. That's what you

[27:57] come into the world as and you gotta go make it. And so the thing that you want to do early on is

[28:02] get status as fast as possible. But the thing is, there's a lot of times you trade short-term

[28:06] status at the expense of long-term. And so as somebody who has lots of young men in my audience and

[28:11] middle-aged men in my audience, you'll never impress someone who's wealthier than you with assets.

[28:18] You'll only impress people below you. So you have the wrong target audience.

[28:23] Because to impress poor people, you outspend them. To impress rich people, you outwork them.

[28:29] And once I understood this, I was like, oh, the guys who are at the top of the game

[28:34] give me respect because they know I'm a future one of them because they know when they were

[28:39] my age, they doubled down on the hustle, not the highlight real. In that overspending on status happens

[28:44] at every level. So in the beginning, it's a watch, right? And a little bit later, it might be a

[28:50] car payment. And a little bit later, it might be a really big expense of car payment. And then it might be

[28:55] a really big condo. And then it might be a really nice house. And then it might become a yacht.

[29:00] And then it becomes a jet. And the thing is, is that you add zeroes to it. But again, you only

[29:04] impress the people underneath of you, not the people above you. And if you want to impress the

[29:08] people underneath of you, by all means do it. But know that that's what you're about.

[29:13] By time like a rich person, by stuff like a poor person. And so when you're thinking about

[29:20] time being the most valuable thing, if you've already dedicated yourself to working and earning

[29:25] it income and learning the skills, then you just want to pour as much time into that as you can.

[29:30] And so fundamentally, you're buying your time back, your low cost time or low income time. So it's

[29:37] prep and food. Go and grocery shopping, cleaning your house. Whatever else you do.

[29:43] With more income earning time. I remember the first time I closed a $500 sale at my gym. I realized

[29:49] that that sale took me 30 minutes. And I knew that for me to buy groceries for the whole month,

[29:55] four times would take me $500 and far more than 30 minutes. And so I thought to myself,

[30:01] my God, if all of that time I was grocery shopping and food prepping and cleaning up after

[30:07] myself and then doing laundry, if all of that time, I could just sell more in a couple of hours,

[30:13] I could do all of that stuff for free. And my poor mind was like, hey, that's wasteful. You could

[30:17] be doing that stuff on your own. But you buy time like your rich. You spend money on stuff like

[30:23] your poor. So by time not stuff, because when you buy time, you can replace the money you bought it

[30:28] with and some. Let me put some real numbers to this. So the average American spends $1500 a month

[30:37] on 96 hours of work. And that breaks down roughly too. Cleaning their house, cleaning their clothes,

[30:46] buying food, preparing food and cleaning food. I'm not even going to get into the four hours of

[30:53] day that the average person spends on social media and watching television. You're going to keep

[30:56] doing that. So I'm not even going to try it. It can mint you not to. But if you just replace those things

[31:00] that you probably don't want to do, it costs about $1500 per month. And so as long as you make,

[31:05] more than $15 per hour, because it costs about 96 hours to replace those activities, which means

[31:10] if I can replace 96 hours of work for $1500. And it's also 96 hours of draining work. Like,

[31:17] it expands energy. It's not like you just sit there for 96 hours. You're actually getting

[31:21] actively tired from doing that stuff. If you took that same thing, and if you make more than 15

[31:26] dollars per hour in your active job, it makes sense. It's the logical decision for you to buy that.

[31:32] And then go make more. Because you're also going to make money twice. Not only are you going to

[31:37] save the time and then work and make more, but you also get better at your job because all of

[31:43] those extra hours aren't just making you more money, you're also becoming more skilled. So you get

[31:48] better faster. And so if I have a year-long guy where he spends $1500 a month to replace all of those

[31:54] things at the end of that year, not only does he have more money at the end of the year,

[31:59] but because he had extra 100 hours of high energy time that he didn't have to spend per month,

[32:05] he's getting 50% better per year. And so that assumes that he doesn't get rewarded in his work

[32:12] for getting better, which by the way, in reality, you typically do as long as you ask. Who you compare

[32:17] yourself to, not who you spend your most time with, will be the highest predictor of how much you make.

[32:23] And so we are motivated by the things that we lack. And so if you are very hungry, it's because

[32:28] you lack food. If you lack sleep, you're very tired, you're very motivated to sleep. And so if you

[32:33] want to be motivated to make money, it's not enough to not have money. You have to have a desire

[32:39] to make a lot more money. And the strongest way to create that desire is to visually see the people

[32:45] who are making far more than you. And so it's about who you compare yourself to, not who you spend

[32:51] time with. Fundamentally, the rich demand in the world only spends time with people poor than him.

[32:55] But he continues to get richer because he's comparing himself to the future version of himself.

[32:59] That's his reference point. That's his reference script. And when he started out, there's real people.

[33:03] As you evolve, it becomes a imaginary. I heard this quote from one person to another when I was

[33:08] walking through the street and they were talking about buying something that was a no return investment.

[33:15] Let's call it a big toy. And he said, there will always be time to make money later. And I

[33:21] remember hearing that and thinking, that's what someone who's poor says. And so to be clear,

[33:30] I think if you want to enjoy life, buy all means do it. This video is about making more money.

[33:36] That's the state of objective. And so that's what I'm talking about. And so the idea that you are

[33:41] going to spend now work later is the fundamental crux of poverty. And so you have to break that with

[33:49] all your heart. And when you have those people around you, and this was a toy, but it could be,

[33:54] let's go out. It always comes under the guise of Yola. We have to live life. But everyone who says

[34:01] that assumes that getting better and learning is not life and is not living. And for me, the purpose

[34:10] of my life is to learn as much as I can and pay down ignorance as much as I possible can and

[34:15] squeeze the last drop of potential out of me that I can. And the way that I do that is through learning.

[34:21] And so for every person that asks you to sacrifice working now so that you can have fun now,

[34:27] just make sure you know the trade you're making. I'll be a real with you. There's no perfect way

[34:31] to live your 20s or even your 30s. You either end up an underskilled 30 year old or 40 year old,

[34:39] or an underlived 30 year old or 40 year old. And so fundamentally, it's not either or,

[34:47] but knowing the trade off and living with the consequences because you can't do them over.

[34:51] And on a personal note, I sacrificed or said differently, invested my 20s in order to have

[34:58] lots of skills and underlived. But in that same time period, I built to where I am now. And I genuinely

[35:08] am very happy with where I am now in life. And I would not redo those years to have, quote,

[35:13] live to more because the real secret is, as I was doing it, I loved the game. And so,

[35:20] some of the best moments in my life when I look back were some of the moments that I felt like I

[35:24] was struggling the most because it was when I underwent the most growth. And so it's interesting

[35:28] because the pain that you go through in the moment often becomes the purpose that you look back on in your

[35:32] life. And so the idea that we want to avoid pain so that we can live today, I think conflates reality

[35:38] because when you look back on your life, a lot of times those are the things that define you.

[35:41] And so we should be seeking those out and not running away from them. So if you're not sure

[35:45] who you compare yourself to versus who you spend time with, when you're about to make a big decision,

[35:51] the people who come up in your mind, who you're weighing their opinions on your decision, those are

[35:56] your reference group people, the people who's opinion you care about. And so if all your friends, for

[36:02] example, or billionaires, and they all sacrifice their 20s, got rid of their friends, got rid of their

[36:07] material belongings, spent all their time working for free so that they could learn this big skill set,

[36:11] and then doubled down in their late 20s and then made it big by the time they're in their 30s.

[36:15] And 40s, those people, if that was your reference group, if you're thinking about leaving home,

[36:20] what do you think that reference group is going to say? For sure. And because of that,

[36:25] you're out the door. And so whenever you have these frictional moments where you are like,

[36:28] I think I should do this, but whoever that person is, whoever that voice is, if they don't have

[36:34] what you want, don't listen to what they say. Only listen to other people's opinions about your life,

[36:40] if their dreams for you are bigger than yours. If they're not disregard, invest, then spend the rest.

[36:47] So the idea is that you invest first and then spend what's left over. And so an interesting

[36:52] thing is that Switzerland has the highest per capita millionaires in the world without having

[36:56] the highest GDP or even GDP per capita. And so how are they able to do that? That means that they've

[37:02] different rules around money, which is what this video is about. And so if we adopt those rules,

[37:07] we can get those outcomes, which means these are just decisions that we get to make. And the easiest

[37:12] way to do that is you take what you need off the top and then you spend the rest on what you want.

[37:17] And so it comes down to saying that you need your future, you need your future self to be bigger

[37:23] than your current self today. And so you invest first and then you spend the rest. And so the way

[37:30] that I like to think about this is point 16. This is how we operationalize this, which is

[37:34] automated investing and then create friction around spending. And so you want to take the money off

[37:41] before you see it. If your job, for example, has a way that they can automatically skim off your

[37:45] paycheck and put it into some sort of investment stuff, do it. If they don't have that, have

[37:49] one of these apps that does segmentation or has multiple bank accounts that you can say.

[37:54] This automatically goes here, this automatically goes here. And I don't touch this. And if you want

[38:00] to get real crazy, the advanced version of this is that as you make more money, you keep what you're

[38:05] living the spend the rest part. Instead of making a percentage, make it a fixed amount. And then

[38:11] as you make more, you're just investing more and more and more into the future. Now you're like,

[38:16] well, how do I invest in the future if I'm just starting out? The future is you. But you're making

[38:21] sure that when you're investing that money, you know whether you're buying declarative knowledge

[38:25] or you're buying procedural knowledge. You're learning about stuff that you need to learn

[38:28] or you're learning how to do it. And the longer you do this, the easier it gets. For the record,

[38:34] I have zero Lamborghini's, zero Rolexes, zero jets. While also being able to buy multiple of these

[38:42] every single month. And so the idea is, you start to become addicted to getting good.

[38:51] And once you get that first little reward of seeing an investment that you made in yourself,

[38:55] start paying off. You see your income go up. You start making more money. You're like,

[38:59] oh my god, this game is awesome. And so that flow of investment that comes to you is one of the

[39:05] best games that you want to win for yourself. You want to just keep seeing, keep making cashflow

[39:10] PRs. Keep making that investment account PR and hit records in that account. And if you get a

[39:16] addicted to that game, if you can just do that from everything in this video, you've already won.

[39:20] And so you want to automate deposits and manualize with draws. So everything that is automatic

[39:28] in terms like your rent, you want to write it as a check. If you or drop it off this cash,

[39:33] if you have payments that you make like a car payment, as much as you're like, wait, this is going

[39:37] to cost time. The value that you get back for knowing exactly where you spend your money is going to

[39:43] make you more money than the one hour a month that you have to pay your bills. That is a promise.

[39:48] And so that may also mean, if you make it difficult to buy, well then maybe you delete some of the

[39:55] apps in your phone. Maybe you don't save your credit cards on the sites that you tend to spend money on.

[40:00] You want to make it as hard as you can to spend money and make it as easy as possible to stack it.

[40:06] Number 17, it's easier to make a million dollars than it is to make a hundred thousand dollars.

[40:12] And let me explain. If I told you to go down the block, you would go at a certain speed.

[40:17] If I said, go as fast as you possibly can at some point you'd run and then you'd improve your

[40:22] form and you get better footwear and then you change your clothes. But at some point, you wouldn't be able

[40:26] to run any harder or any faster to get there. But if I said, I need you to go five blocks. You may be like,

[40:32] huh, okay, now some people will then try to walk or run that. But the smart cookie then says,

[40:40] Huh, I could take a car and I would go a hell of a lot faster. And if I'm speeding in my car,

[40:47] I'll probably get to the fifth block before the other guy gets the end of the first block.

[40:51] And so the magic of thinking bigger is that you change your solution set.

[40:58] Meaning, you use different tools to accomplish the objective. The reason a hundred thousand dollars per year is

[41:03] the hardest amount of money to make is because it assumes for most people that they will trade

[41:08] at their time in terms of hourly wages or salary and traditional work in order to get it.

[41:12] And so they have to spend all of their time in order to make the hundred thousand dollars.

[41:17] But if I said, make a million or even ten million before the world explodes, you would know

[41:22] that you would have to use a different way of solving that problem. And so the reason it's easier

[41:27] to make a million dollars or ten million dollars is because you can do it in less time with more skill.

[41:34] If you start solving for the skills required to make a million or ten million dollars,

[41:41] you don't want to love money. You want to learn to love making money. So there's two misconceptions

[41:47] and then one truth around this. The first misconception is money is the root of all evil. And then

[41:52] that obviously is a quote from the Bible, first Timothy 610. The 201 version, someone says,

[41:59] no, it's not money that's the root of all evil. It's the love of money that's the root of all

[42:04] evil. But that's just the 201 version. The actual translation, there's five translations for it.

[42:11] And four of the five are the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil. Meaning,

[42:19] if you desire money more than anything else, then you will commit the other sins in order to attain it.

[42:27] And so the idea is that it's only a pathway that has a high likelihood of causing you to do

[42:34] things that are unethical or immoral. And so there's this huge, terrible paradigm in society that

[42:41] money is somehow good or bad. It is just potential energy. It's just bottled time. And that bottled

[42:48] time can build bombs. That bottled time can build hospitals. It can build wells and build schools.

[42:54] It can make YouTube videos that educate. And so the idea that your afraid to make money means that

[43:00] you're afraid of having power. And maybe you should be afraid of having power because maybe you'd

[43:05] misuse it. But if you do want to help the world, then all it's going to do is amplify your ability

[43:11] to do that. And if you have that mission on your heart or in your mind, then it's your duty to remove

[43:19] everything else in your fucking way to go get it. The more money you make other people, the more money you

[43:26] make. And so the amount of money that you will be able to make in your career comes down to three

[43:30] variables. Number one is the value that you're able to create in total for all of the people you

[43:36] create it for. Times, your ability to negotiate how much of that value you're able to get. Times,

[43:43] number three, which is the amount of other people who can also create that value. And you have to have

[43:50] all three. Because for example, if you develop a skill of sales and you can create millions of

[43:56] dollars in value for a company and you're really good at negotiating, then in theory you'd get

[44:02] millions and millions of dollars from that company. But if somebody else is willing to work for a

[44:07] few hundred thousand dollars a year in order to make that value, then your position disappears.

[44:12] And so that gives us the blueprint for making money. Is that not only do you want to be able to

[44:17] create that value? You want to be able to create a value in a way that no one else can. And the way

[44:22] that you do that is not by, in my opinion, learning some incredibly secret-new skill. What makes

[44:29] skills unique is the skill set. It's the stack of skills together that create the uniqueness.

[44:36] If someone else has to try and recreate something I could do, they would have to have lived my life.

[44:43] And so your life and the time you spend becomes your competitive advantage and becomes your asset.

[44:49] It becomes the mode that other people can't chip into. They'd have to go through being a competitive

[44:54] fitness person and then go through owning lots of gyms and then go through doing turn around

[45:00] across the country and then go through doing a licensing business and then go through making a

[45:04] supplement business and then go through launching a meal prep business and then also starting a

[45:08] software company and then going through an exit for both and then starting a private egg. They'd

[45:13] have to do so much stuff. There are so many skills that are required. Your time is your weapon

[45:20] if you invest it wisely. And the one thing that I would leave you with is that money-love-speed

[45:26] wealth-love's time. Poverty loves in decision. If this stuff was valuable for you and hopefully it

[45:33] helps you avoid losing like a money twice like I did. I've a video on leverage and wealth creation

[45:39] that you can check out. It's I think the number one video on this channel and it's one of the fastest

[45:43] ways to compound wealth. If you are poor and you're just getting started or just want to start

[45:48] in a business, I have brutally honest advice to my younger self that a lot of people seem to have

[45:53] really found value.

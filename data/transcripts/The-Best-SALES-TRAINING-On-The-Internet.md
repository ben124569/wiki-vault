[00:00] We are all one decision away from changing our lives forever and a lot of us don't even know it.

[00:04] And the difference between the decisions you make today and the ones that you made last year

[00:08] if they've gotten you to where you are right now, they were not good decisions.

[00:10] And so if we want to have more power in our lives, we have to first understand what power is

[00:15] and second, how do unlock it through the actions and decisions that we make?

[00:18] And if you have a company or a business or a job or you need to influence other people or you need to get people to say yes

[00:24] or you need people to make decisions or most importantly make decisions for yourself that are going to change your life for the better

[00:28] that we have to understand what the topic means.

[00:30] If you don't know why, I'm an EMSOXROMOZI, I would act as a should not come.

[00:33] In 10 years ago, I was sleeping on a gym floor and 10 years later I am now in my mom's basement.

[00:37] That is how much better my life is getting.

[00:39] This is actually a penthouse and I like to work in a closet because I like camping the quiet and not having

[00:43] to distract. But my life has gone significantly better.

[00:46] And I recently spoke at coachingCon and they want to be to talk about this specific topic

[00:50] because there's a series of events and decisions that made massive differences in my life

[00:54] and I broke them down and after I gave the speech and got off stage I had hundreds of people who message me

[00:59] saying that that speech was one of the things that made them take huge strides in their life

[01:03] and honestly made them more powerful. And that is all I want for you, Mosination,

[01:06] it's to become more and more powerful so that we can all make the world a better place.

[01:10] All right, so enjoy the presentation and I'll see you guys in the next slide.

[01:13] It's just great to be here. So thank you guys so much.

[01:15] I promise that I will do my absolute best to give you a high return on your attention

[01:21] because it's the most valuable thing you guys have.

[01:23] I just want to thank you for investing you here with me today. So that being said,

[01:29] the reason I went up with gold diggers because we all know who's the real person who makes the

[01:33] money in the family. And so I picked right that's by the way the best passive income strategy

[01:41] in existence is just to marry someone rich. They don't talk about that one, right?

[01:46] The second thing though that I want to talk about is power.

[01:53] And I think that actually before I get into that, who here wants to be powerful?

[02:02] Awesome, and that's not everybody raised their hand, which is interesting.

[02:05] And I think I find it interesting because I asked that question sometimes in an audience

[02:09] sometimes it's easier to remain anonymous. But one of the one when you stare at someone's eyes

[02:13] and you want to be powerful, a lot of people shrink away from that. And I think it's because

[02:17] at least me when I was coming up, I had negative associations with the word. To me, power was

[02:22] like the emperor in Star Wars, you know, the lightning, world fingers, any of them. And so to me

[02:28] that was like power, but I saw this a negative thing. And I feel like as I developed, I started

[02:33] one of the powers neutral. You can be incredibly powerful and bad, incredibly powerful and good.

[02:39] And so the idea is if we could harness power, then it amplifies who we are. And if we're shitty people,

[02:45] then we're very, very shitty people. And we're very good, we're very, very good. And so I hope

[02:50] that all of us aspire to have more power in our lives. And that is the underlying theme of the

[02:55] presentation I'm going to talk to you guys about today. So decision making, who's so excited about

[03:02] decision making? Well, I'll give you the sub headline, which is selling with logic to make lots of

[03:08] money. And I think there are different selling styles. When I, because I've trained a lot of sales

[03:14] teams, we've built a lot of sales teams, sold a lot of different industries now. People sell differently.

[03:20] Who here would consider themselves like an emotional seller? Like you get like a mostly invested

[03:25] in the prospect, you get them to cry, anybody like that, you know what I'm saying? Cool. Who here

[03:30] is somebody who is more of a like, I'm not going to let you leave. Types of you know who you are,

[03:37] this is where you're at. I am that way too sometimes. All right, just me, fair enough.

[03:42] And then the third is kind of logical selling, which is like let's just talk through this,

[03:47] and if it makes sense, let's do it, and if it doesn't, no worries. Between those three times,

[03:50] I tend to actually be more of a logical seller in general. And I've gotten a lot of a claim

[03:57] rightfully or not, that was wild. Sorry. I actually have a fear of birds. So this was about to be

[04:07] very short presentation. And so a lot of the, a lot of my like success using logic and sales has

[04:16] given me a lot of a claim, and this is the first presentation that I've put together. So this is just

[04:21] for you guys as a brand new presentation, because I've been thinking about like reverse engineering,

[04:26] what are the things, and what are the frameworks we think about to get to yes, right? And the

[04:30] yes that I want from somebody is not a yes I'm going to buy, but yes I'm going to decide. And I think

[04:36] if you can delineate that for yourself too, it takes a little bit of pressure off selling,

[04:40] because my goal is to give this person power. And you have to understand what power is in order to

[04:45] give it, right? Who here knows the definition of power? Go for it. I love that. I thought to

[04:53] existence is what he said, which is actually a really favorite way. So the dictionary definition

[04:58] is the ability to influence or direct events or people. That's the dictionary definition,

[05:03] but I love how he used that it because as I see omnipotence, so God or God figure would be as they think

[05:10] it appears. So the distance between thoughts and reality are there is no distance, right?

[05:16] That would be an omnipotent being. If you think the world, the world exists, right? And so as we

[05:22] take steps towards that as the ideal, we become more powerful. And if we can do that for our prospects,

[05:28] we can allow them to step into the person they want to be and make a decision to own their

[05:31] shit one way or another. Does that make sense? Cool. All right, let's rock. So this will either be

[05:38] the best presentation on seals you've ever heard. The worst presentation on seals you've ever heard

[05:43] or somewhere in between. That is a promise. All right? And so I thought it would make sense to start with this.

[05:50] We have a high, this is Charlie Munder, who's probably like my number one hero in this season of my life.

[05:56] We have a high moral responsibility to be rational. And I think that getting someone to rationally

[06:00] to side is important because emotional buyers oftentimes get excited, the buy, and then who's

[06:05] had somebody who calls them two days later? I don't know why. Anybody? Raise your hand. Just so you

[06:10] know you're not alone. Okay. And what happens is it's just like dating, I think Layla talks about

[06:14] yesterday. If you have a rational foundation for a relationship or a decision, when the emotions

[06:20] fade, the logical continue. And so it's good to answer both sides of the decision making process.

[06:26] The short term side is the emotion that gets you to decrease your action threshold and take a step.

[06:31] Right? But the logic is what makes it stick and actually makes you a great customer. All right? And so

[06:37] for me, and I think that the further along you get in business and the higher up you get in business,

[06:41] the more you'll see people who tend to make more logical decisions, more logic first decisions,

[06:45] and few and few emotional decisions. All right? So what does being a rational, I start, what is

[06:51] rational logical have to do with selling? Well, you have logical buyers, you have a

[06:56] motion of buyers in general, right? Most people sit on this continuum, one way or the other.

[07:03] And emotionally, people want to believe you. People want to buy. You must help their logical

[07:10] brains justify to the decision that they already want to make. Think about it that way. They want

[07:15] to buy for me. You have to help them, all right? So who here identifies actually, I'll skip through

[07:22] this. Emotional, logical, you're probably in between, anybody in between these two? Anyone? All right,

[07:28] then you'll love this. So before we get started, I thought I would give you a few beliefs about

[07:35] selling to have served me very well throughout the years. Number one, people want to believe you.

[07:40] They want to buy. You must help their logical brains justify the decision. Two.

[07:46] Selling happens before you ask for the sale. Closing happens after. So you're selling for a

[07:52] lot longer period of time. But the moment you kind of like take your pants off and you're like,

[07:55] this is what it is. That's when you're closing, right? You have now solicited it.

[08:03] Now you've closed. Three, it's easier to handle obstacles than objections. I'll get to what the

[08:10] difference between those are in a second. That being said, expects and plan for no.

[08:18] It is not failure. It is expected to stop being surprised. When the first things we talk,

[08:24] new sales guys into is expect now. That's not like that's a part of this. If they already were

[08:30] going to say yes, then you are not necessary. No is the job, right? If they could make the decision on

[08:37] the road, they would just send you the money. The reason they're struggling is because they can't

[08:43] and they need your help, which is why sales is actually the first step in coaching. And I see sales

[08:48] is power. If you can have the ability to direct or influence others, that is power. And I feel

[08:55] like it should be made much cooler than I feel like it is. Five, if you didn't get a gas from a

[09:01] price tag, you didn't go high enough. This is another belief. So for those of you who are afraid

[09:07] to raise your price, if you're not getting gas, you're not going high enough. Straight up. And

[09:13] when you do it that way, you can always walk down and have a beautiful price anchor. Right? When you say

[09:18] a hundred thousand dollars first, a brand feels like a rounding error. True, when I say $10

[09:22] first, like I'm saying right now, $10. And I say a thousand. Sounds way fucking bigger, doesn't it?

[09:29] So you've got to get the gas and you've got to train your guys if you have a team, they have to

[09:33] be comfortable with no. And they have to be comfortable with the gas. They got to go for the

[09:38] gas. You know what I mean? Dude, you should have heard the gas on this one. Right? There we go.

[09:42] Seven. Selling properly is the first step becoming a coach. Your first impressions and the

[09:47] expectations you set dictate the relationship. How you sell, the fact that you're in the sale

[09:52] will set you up for success and you're trying for success in the long run. Eight. Selling is

[09:56] helping prospects make decisions out themselves. Like you are helping them help themselves. That's

[10:01] where the power comes from. You are not helping them. You're helping them help them. See the

[10:06] difference? It's new ons, but it's real. Nine, keep the prospect not the sale as the priority.

[10:13] It's not about us. The more you can vanish in the sale and and magnify them, the better it

[10:22] you're selling conversations will go because it's not about us. They don't care about you. They only

[10:27] care about that and they will talk about themselves as long as 11. This is a really important

[10:32] one especially when you start to getting into closing. Seek to understand not to argue.

[10:38] And the way that I train our sales team around this is childlike curiosity. So when someone says

[10:45] and someone objects to something, it's like, ha, that's so weird. I wouldn't have thought that.

[10:49] Tell me more about that. Right? And you get to be able to maintain that childlike curiosity.

[10:54] The same way they train fighters to not breathe too much during a fight. Through exposure.

[11:00] The more we get into these uncomfortable, high stakes, closing scenarios, the less weird

[11:07] and high stakes they become because they become what you do every day. And the good thing is,

[11:12] you get to have this conversation hundreds and thousands of times and they only get to have it once.

[11:17] So you fucking better be better at it than them. Closing is a dance not a fight.

[11:22] It's seduction, not rape. I mean, I'm being super serious about this.

[11:29] The goal is not to beat them into submission. The goal is to soften your back foot.

[11:35] It's like, I'm good. I want to help you help you. And if that means not doing this, then I fucking love it.

[11:42] I'm with you. I'm on your team. And I'll give you a bullet on that in a second.

[11:47] Selling is a transference of belief over a bridge of trust. Therefore, there are two things that are required.

[11:53] You must believe so that you can transfer it. And you must have trust to make the transfer.

[11:59] Because if you truly believe in a lot of times, you, anyone been on a hot streak when they're

[12:04] selling anyone. Anyone who just had their hand up, ever been on a cold streak?

[12:11] Most times, you go from hot to cold, not because you forgot how to sell,

[12:14] because you stop believing in why you're selling. You have the same skills as you did the day before.

[12:19] But sometimes you get a text, you get an email, you get a pain in the ass customer, ask for a refund,

[12:24] whatever the hell it is, right? And then you question yourself. And so that bridge might have been

[12:28] created, but there was nothing to walk across it. Because your pup wasn't full. And so that's why

[12:32] especially it's you in the beginning, but your teams over time, the process of filling,

[12:37] conviction, is one of the easiest and best ways to increase someone's closing percentage.

[12:42] Better than any of the training in the world. If you get someone to believe, they will sell

[12:46] the right way because they're doing it not to make the deal because they want to help the other person.

[12:51] 16, you can only build trust if you genuinely want to help. And humans are exceptionally good at

[12:55] sniffing out intention. It is a survival mechanism. You have to know if someone's trying to double

[12:59] cross you. We're very good at smelling it out. And the reason a lot of you guys can't close is because

[13:04] you only care about closing. Belief and trust are continuing, not by-naries. So it's not you believe

[13:10] or don't believe. It's not they trust you or don't trust you, but how much do they trust you?

[13:14] How much do you believe? How deeply do you believe? Because anyone who ever been around somebody

[13:20] who just believes balls to bone something that you think's batshit crazy. And like, I mean all the

[13:24] way, so much so that you start to question what you believe. That's what real conviction does.

[13:32] 18, Closer's asked card questions and it's because you genuinely care. That's why you do it.

[13:37] That's why we're here. Who here wants to impact thousands of lives and help people?

[13:42] Then you've got to fucking ask card questions. Because it's the only thing that's going to

[13:46] actually appear so much hard to actually get the transformation to happen. If you can't make,

[13:49] if you cannot have transformational conversations, you cannot coach. And this is the first step.

[13:55] The person who cares the most about the prospect wins the same. That includes them.

[14:02] So if you care more about their well-being than they do, you will win. And if you are more

[14:07] convicted, they will question their own excuses because you are so certain.

[14:12] Little to little nugget for you. We're proud of all your sales. By the way, because when you do get

[14:17] on that hot streak, right? When you get on that hot streak and then you get cold again,

[14:22] watch your hot streak. See where you pause. What jokes you made when you asked for the sale,

[14:27] when you didn't how you overcame it. And it'll get you back in the flow much faster than trying to

[14:32] question yourself, what I do, what I do. Always report all your sales. It's also easy to

[14:36] train new people. And then lastly, 21. Power is the ability to direct or influence people.

[14:43] If you want to be powerful, you must understand this skill. And that's what we're going to talk about.

[14:50] Cool? Awesome. When does selling happen? Does it happen when they're a lead? Does it happen when

[14:55] we're qualifying them? Does it happen when we solicit the sale? Does it happen when we close the sale?

[15:01] One does the selling happen? All the time. The entire time selling is happening. But what are we

[15:08] going to talk about today? Just this. Just closing. Everything you have to do after asking someone

[15:16] to buy. Why are we doing that rather than the entire process? Beyond the fact that we'd be here all

[15:20] day, the other reason and I love this is that closing has one of the highest predictors of success

[15:26] in business. And here's an analogy for it. Everyone from there with the NFL? Great. So here's an

[15:33] insane statistic. The top five red zone offenses in the league. Now, last five years, made the playoffs

[15:42] 90% of the time. Here's why this is interesting and crazy. There's a million other stats. They could

[15:47] have horrible defenses. They could have terrible coaching. They could have terrible whatever it is.

[15:52] They could have all these things that are wrong with their terrible session teams. Whatever.

[15:57] But just this one set. If they're on the red zone, they fucking close. And I can tell you if you

[16:05] have this ability, if you have the skill, it will make up for a tremendous amount of deficiencies

[16:10] in other areas of your life in business. And it will buy you time to learn those. But if you can't

[16:16] close, it's very difficult to grow in business, especially in the beginning because it's probably

[16:21] you. That's why we're talking about closing. Why is this important from money getting perspective?

[16:26] Well, first off, if you have 100 people walking the door, 10% are never going to buy. Just accept that.

[16:32] Right? Probably because you don't know which 10% it is. But 10% are never going to buy. 10% are always

[16:39] going to buy. You just got enough fucking up. And most of you guys, these are the only sales you're getting.

[16:43] They're like, well, I already, I'm already here. My friend told me about you. I have my credit card

[16:48] and some of you are like, well, let's make sure you're like, shut the fuck, just take the card.

[16:52] You know what I mean? Like, shut up. That's like, hey, my friend so awesome, you got to meet him.

[16:57] She's like, oh my god, he's great. And then the guy starts talking and she's like, I just kidding.

[17:01] You know, like, terrible. Right? But this is what we fight for. This is what we train. And if you want to make a big impact,

[17:10] that's what we're fighting for. It's the middle 80. Why this presentation will make you money?

[17:15] If after this presentation, you just have one more bullet, one more playing your arsenal to close,

[17:20] where I get you one more deal a month, I'll feel like my job was done. All right. And hopefully,

[17:25] if you just do that, it'll pay for your entire weekend. All right. That's my goal for the presentation.

[17:29] That everything that you guys have done for this whole weekend is paid for. Is that cool if they're

[17:32] outcome? All right. So this is what my favorite saying. You're only one decision away from changing your life forever.

[17:40] And whenever I feel overwhelmed or I feel like I'm decreased, like I feel powerless or I feel

[17:45] like I've less power than I want to have, I always say this to myself because it's like,

[17:49] I can take one decision to change fucking everything. You know what I mean? Like, I can drink a bottle of

[17:54] jack getting the car. I can change everything with one decision. Right? I can make a step to invest in something.

[18:00] I can buy something. I can invest in myself. I can have a terrible conversation with late,

[18:04] or an amazing conversation with late, but just one decision. And that's always giving me power.

[18:09] But the thing is, is that instead of changing our lives, we blame when I say blame,

[18:14] I want you to think, give power to sources outside of our control. And this is what you,

[18:20] and this is what your prospects and your customers are doing. And this is why so many people are

[18:25] weak and powerless. And so we're going to do a fun activity today because I want you to be involved so you can

[18:29] learn it. And we're going to do this so that one, you can help decisions to help yourself with whatever decisions

[18:34] you're facing. Two, you can use these frameworks to out-prost, but help themselves. And then three,

[18:39] become more powerful. So, but rather than keep this hypothetical, I need you to visualize the decision that you need to make.

[18:44] All right? You need that for me? Fantastic. And this is why. I want you to actually think through a decision

[18:51] together because this is a statement from Confucius. I hear and I forget. I see and I remember,

[18:58] I do and I understand. So my goal here isn't for you to take screenshots of every picture,

[19:03] or every slide. That's not my point. Because the thing is, when you do that and you kind of,

[19:06] I mean, this is why I do it, I take pictures so that I don't have to remember it. But I don't want you to remember it.

[19:12] I want you to understand it. If you understand it, you won't have to go back to your notes because

[19:16] let's be real. Half the time you're not even opening these notes up again. You're here now with me.

[19:20] Try and understand. If you do that, it can change your life. Because what we're going to do is not

[19:25] going to be some scripts that you have to understand, but the logic behind the arguments that people will

[19:29] give you as to why they are not choosing to become more powerful. If you can unlock that,

[19:33] people will feel more powerful talking to you and they will want to buy for me because of the feeling they have.

[19:39] So make sense. So that's when you're using logic to create an emotion. So here's an easy one for you.

[19:45] Anyone here presented with the decision last 24 hours? Yes? Great. Fantastic. So who thinks the decision

[19:51] could change your life for the better? Great. For the worse? Noes? All right. Let's go. So here's my goal.

[19:57] I want to show you as though you were prospect had a thing through decision and help others using these

[20:01] frameworks, right? What you want? What you don't want? Maximize the left, minimize the right. So here's

[20:06] what this is translated to. If you decided by the offer, if you're more certain about your decision,

[20:10] if you started not to buy the offer, if you're fucking certain about the decision, and if you're

[20:14] undecided, you make a fucking decision. All right? And if you feel good, that is the one that is the

[20:20] highest likelihood of getting you closer where you want to go. And this is what we have to walk through

[20:24] with our prospects. When you're looking at them, you have to be like, I don't want you to buy.

[20:29] I want you to decide for you. Not for me. I'll be the same anyway. You're like, I'm going to be

[20:34] ripped in a shape. It's not going to change a minute. That's how you can change. But it will change for you.

[20:41] So quick note on sales ethics and then we'll dive in. Helping someone make a decision to help

[20:44] themselves as not being buying for me. That's a reiteration. You have to keep their goals at the

[20:48] center of the decision. And you should be happy. I mean this. Because if you can shift this,

[20:53] truly, if you can be happy when someone decides to own the power and not work with you,

[20:59] then the pressure around sales disappears. It evaporates. There's no stake. The stake is did I help

[21:05] them. Does that make sense? And that means that you can win every sale because you change the

[21:09] metric you're measuring yourself by. That's the superpower. Like, and that's where you do make

[21:14] the most sales because you don't care about the sale because you care about the person. And the people

[21:19] pay the people, pay the most attention. So I call it paying attention. They pay for it. They pay for

[21:24] you to pay attention rather than talking to like yourself. Right? Because they don't care about you.

[21:27] Because they're thinking about a hundred other things. And this is why. Most importantly,

[21:32] make high-stakes decisions to help your prospects in order best serve them. Okay. So I told you earlier,

[21:38] I was going to talk about the difference between obstacles and objections. A couple of you guys raised your hands.

[21:42] But the difference is, I'm not going to ask. I'll tell you what it is.

[21:45] obstacle is a thing that blocks one's way or prevents or hinders progress. When you disagree with them,

[21:54] that is an obstacle. This happens before you solicit the sale. Someone says some bullshit before

[22:00] even get to the sale. That's an obstacle. A simple example of you're all the time. Hey, why do you

[22:05] hop on the call today? Hey, why do you walk in the gym today? Whatever it is, right? Then I just want to

[22:10] find out a little bit more about the program. First 10 seconds. obstacle. You're not here to find out

[22:15] more about the program. Here's your fat. But they got to say it. So you're like, oh, so you find it out.

[22:21] Do you do this all the time? Do you go to lots of different programs to find out information?

[22:25] Where is there a problem you're trying to solve? They're like, oh well, you know, I'm trying to lose weight.

[22:29] Like, oh, god, so you're not just hopping on a hundred calls a day because I was like,

[22:31] that would be a very weird existence, right? You just hop on for information all day.

[22:34] Ha ha ha ha, great. Fantastic.

[22:36] Ha Ha. I've had this conversation before. Right? So it's an obstacle, right? And the

[22:43] thing is it's easy confront and destroy obstacles before you ask, but sale. Once you've asked for the

[22:49] sale, you switch to objections. Objections is when they disagree with you. So it's much easier to be on

[22:56] the other side, disagreeing and helping them break their beliefs before the stake has been presented.

[23:01] After after the after the red zone, it's all closing. It's all objection overpumps, right?

[23:06] Example that's like, I don't want to buy right now. And you're like, totally understand.

[23:10] What do the main criteria think through? Which is always funny because people are like,

[23:13] I need to think about it. I've never had someone like leave because they need to think about it.

[23:16] I'm like, oh, what do you think about it?

[23:19] Like I'm still here. Ha Ha. So learning how to talk through these high

[23:25] stakes decisions with yourself or others with the purpose of presentation and as a result,

[23:28] you'll become more powerful. Okay. So before I dive into these arch speech of these arguments,

[23:32] I have to make this one statement is that the person was really wants the goal

[23:37] and believe three things. One, which we'll get to it. There you go. The product will get

[23:42] some of the goal, comma, the way they want to get there. And I learn that second half, the hard way,

[23:48] because we found out, in Jim launch, that people would say no sometimes to buying memberships,

[23:53] right, or buying challenges or whatever. But when we offered them the ability to come back the next

[23:58] day, help them for free, we'd sell $400 a supplements. And they just said no to $100 down service thing.

[24:05] And like what the fuck? It's because they want to lose weight, but they want to lose weight their way.

[24:12] And so that's when I started learning like, oh, not only do we have to make sure that they want the goal,

[24:17] and they believe that the product's going to get them there, it has to get them there

[24:20] that we'd want to get there. This gives you ammo for the questions that you're going to ask. This makes sense?

[24:25] Okay. The second thing is that you and others will support them. Like, are you telling me the truth?

[24:31] Is this really what's going to happen? Will other people around me support this decision?

[24:36] And the third is that it will work for them and not just everyone else. Sure. I've seen the people

[24:42] who step on the stage, but they're different than me. I'm a snowflake. I have metabolic thyroid

[24:48] ketoosis, right? Whatever. I have zero influence, I'll, oligarch, whatever. I mean, like, I have no following

[24:55] guess. I just, right? Whatever it is, right? Whatever bullshit you tell yourself. And what you have to do in

[25:01] the situations, you have to provide proof so that it'd be more unreasonable not to believe than to believe.

[25:06] And this is a logical close. This is not a, this is not an emotional close.

[25:10] This is when you look at someone and say, how many people would you need to see for it to be more

[25:15] unreasonable if you're not to believe than to believe? At what point is it 10? Is it 50?

[25:21] Here's a thousand. Tell me when to stop. Okay, okay, okay, great. So that's not the real reason

[25:27] that you can confront the real shit. All right. So otherwise, if they're not sure of those things,

[25:32] if they don't actually want to lose weight, if you don't actually want to make money

[25:35] doing online fitness, then it doesn't matter which season says. You don't want to make money doing

[25:40] online fitness. You're not going to buy, right? You do want to make money doing online fitness.

[25:45] Then you go down the train tracks. It makes sense? Okay. Again, this is why you expect no at first,

[25:51] because if people could make the decision, they would have already made it. All right. Now to the main course.

[25:55] Richard Feynman, besides Charlie, one of my favorite thinkers of all time, he was like the second guy on

[26:00] the Adam bomb. Sounds negative. Brilliant teacher he's known for this. Understand, don't memorize.

[26:05] Learn principles, not formulas. And that's what the rest of this presentation is about.

[26:08] Is the principles behind overcoming these distortions that people have. And so this is me asking

[26:15] you for your own sake. Don't take pictures of the slides. It's because all the stuff's going to be

[26:18] in the recordings, but you are here now. So be here now. So you can understand it. Okay? So there are

[26:24] three sources. This is a huge breakthrough for me. So I'm going to share it with you the first time

[26:28] I'm trying to share it alive. There are three sources that we cast our power to. Okay? And it took

[26:33] me a very long time to get through this, because I looked at Grant and he had his, you know, you got

[26:38] stall decision maker money. And he talked to Barry who owned sage. She's like, you got time fit,

[26:46] money, fear, shame. Right? Those are hers. And then Jordan Belford's got his. And so everybody's

[26:50] got like these are the only outcomes. Right? And it's like there has to be an actual truth here.

[26:55] Like there has to be something that's true that's unquestion. And so trying to figure this out,

[27:01] I actually went back to Dr. Albert Ellis. Anybody who knew he is? No, right.

[27:07] Who here knows what cognitive behavioral therapy is? CBT? He admitted it. Smart dude.

[27:14] And so he noticed is that he originally had 11 distortions of reality.

[27:18] And he dropped it to 9, then it's 7, and they came with 3, and the 3 stuck. And the 3 are

[27:24] what I'm about to share with you. You're like, why is he talking about this about sales? Because the

[27:27] objections that people offer you where they cast their power to are distortions of reality.

[27:33] They are the things we use to upset ourselves.

[27:36] These are the 3. Circumstances. And this is the irrational statement that people make.

[27:42] I must get what I want when I want it. I must not get what I don't want. If I don't get what I want, I can't stand it.

[27:49] That's when people blame their emotional services on

[27:52] emotional services on circumstances. Two others. Other people must treat me fairly and kindly. And if they don't, they are no good and deserve to be condemned and punished.

[28:02] It's like your animal brain. Three. So I must do well or else I am no good. These are the three

[28:10] core distortions that upset people. This is like mental illness. And so I'm not saying anyone has mental illness if they don't agree with you.

[28:17] It's more so that these are distortions that are not real. And if you can understand, not memorize.

[28:23] If you can understand this, then you can have these high-stakes conversations, understanding exactly which

[28:28] distortion they are suffering from. And I'll show you how to overcome it. Okay? And so I like to consider the onion of blame.

[28:34] People, this is like one of the bigger breakthroughs I had. They start with the outside. They blame circumstances,

[28:41] time, money, other shit. And then the step next to that, they start to blame other people. My spouse, my kids, my employees.

[28:49] And then finally they'd say like, it's me. It's my fault.

[28:52] And so you might have to overcome multiple layers as you peel back. And based on the objection they give you,

[28:59] you can know where you're at. You can not close you are. Someone just says I have to think about them. You're like great.

[29:04] I'm talking to the person who's in power and the decision maker that I seem to get them to say yes.

[29:08] If they're like, I don't have, they're casting the power away. And so if you guys are probably casting a power away,

[29:14] on decisions you need to make. Which is why I'm making the presentation.

[29:17] Even though that these are the things that distort people's realities, because you're like,

[29:20] no one's ever said, circumstances are getting in my way. They may have passed in five ways that I want to

[29:26] equip you to deal with for yourself and others. So these are the five most common excuses,

[29:32] scapegoats that people use. For a circuit, if you find other ones, these are the biggest buckets,

[29:38] because I didn't want to have 100 things here. But the big three buckets are circumstances, others and

[29:42] self. But they manifest with time in multiple ways. I'm going to show you how value, price,

[29:48] money, etc. Fit, I'm a special stuff like others, which is I don't have the authority to make the decision.

[29:54] And then finally, self, which is, what if I just don't make the decision, what some

[29:58] life-making for me, avoidance, stall? You go from service level to core. And as a side note,

[30:06] you should never get stuck on the stuff near the top. And ideally, you shouldn't really never get stuck anywhere

[30:11] on this equation. If the person wants what you have, and you truly believe in what you have to help them.

[30:17] And I mean that, like, if you understand this thoroughly, you can walk someone towards helping themselves.

[30:23] Okay, this is what they look like or this is what they sound like in reality. Not a good, not a good

[30:28] time right now. I'm really busy, right? That's time. Can't afford it. To expensive. Fit, not sure if it's

[30:36] for me. I hate broccoli. I can't do a plan with broccoli. Right? Can't do a plan where I have to DM people

[30:41] every day. It's against my brand. I'm poor, but it's against my brand. Right? Authority.

[30:46] Have to talk to my partner spouse. I have to talk to somebody who is more power than me.

[30:50] It's funny because when you start thinking this way, it sounds silly. And then avoidance.

[30:54] I need to think about it. Clearly, let's think about it now. All right? And so I told you,

[30:59] I want you to think about the principles behind these things. Not memorized. You've got circumstances,

[31:04] you've got other people, and you have yourself. And we drill down. So, quick test. Who here is

[31:09] physically in the room? Raise your tongue? Wonderful. Arms are working. We're rocking.

[31:14] So, here's my ask. Raise your hand if you or your prospects present with this distortion.

[31:22] So, who here is a time person? A busy. It's not a good time. Maybe in the future. Anyone

[31:26] do what these? Sometimes it's yourself totally. So, I'm also going to tell you a secret about this.

[31:31] I think the reason I got pretty decent at logical arguments is because I am inherently skeptical.

[31:37] And I will paralyze myself from not doing anything. Unless I have really sound reasons to do it.

[31:42] And I realize that I couldn't move forward to make any progress in my life. It's all had these

[31:46] frameworks to think through these hard decisions through. So, I could start taking steps to where I

[31:50] wanted to go. It took me years to get there. And so, hopefully, I can give you some keys

[31:55] that help me unlock my own head to get out of my own fucking way so that you can't to and help your clients.

[32:00] All right? So, the way I think about time, and there's a lot of overcomes for all of these things.

[32:06] What I tried to do was bunch the three biggest ones that I like to use most frequently.

[32:10] And if I veer from the bullets on the screen, it's because I'm ripping with you and I'd rather

[32:15] just kind of stay in the flows. That's cool. Okay. Fantastic. So, when you're overcoming this one,

[32:21] each of these is kind of a specific angle that you're attacking it from. So, macro is like,

[32:26] this is a busy season for me. Got lots of stuff going on, right? Micro is like, I don't have any

[32:32] time in my day. So, you're one to person say I've got lots of shit going on or person's like,

[32:36] I can't find the time. It's different. It sounds subtle, but it's both about time but in different ways.

[32:40] All right? And then the last one is, when I have time I'll start, right?

[32:46] Everyone has a fucking worship, whatever. Okay. So, as always, we never disagree with prospects

[32:52] because you're not in a fight. Totally got it. Totally understand. Do you think,

[32:57] like, do you want this to be something that lasts for the long term? Right? It's a question.

[33:02] Really? Yeah. Do you think that you're going to be busy again in the future? Well, yeah.

[33:07] So, you want this to last in the long run and you do think you're going to be busy again in the future?

[33:11] Well, then don't you think it'd be best to start now when you are busy because if you learn how to do it

[33:15] when you're busy, you'll be able to do it forever. If you can only learn it during a perfect circumstance,

[33:19] then you're going to fall when it gets busy again. And isn't that the time you'd want to have the most

[33:23] support? Go as for you guys, too. Let's just number one. You got so many more. Right? And so,

[33:30] when you knock that out, the goal is that the person says, well, fuck, that's not a good reason.

[33:34] And you take one step towards the truth. So, when you're thinking about it, it's not like,

[33:38] oh, I've got to overcome this one thing and then go by, you've got to keep peeling. And if you have

[33:43] this framework, you understand the direction you're going in. And you can start listening for the,

[33:47] oh, they're talking about themselves now. I've got two layers deeper, right? So that's seasonal.

[33:52] Micro. You can't tell someone in a sale. Hey, take out your phone, take out your hours by week,

[33:58] pull it up. Oh, look, 22 hours in social media this week. You've got time. So you say it differently.

[34:04] You say, you know what I had the same issue. And I used to complain all the time about how I didn't

[34:07] have time to be successful and do the things I needed to do. And my wife got sick and tired of me saying

[34:12] that she pulled my phone out and she was like, look, I guess I just found you time, did not?

[34:16] Oh, like, I fuck. And you can say it that way and then a prospect feels better.

[34:20] So anybody here feel like they know what I'm talking? Right? And the first thing that any program

[34:26] is going to do if it's a good program is going to cut out the 90% of the shit that you are doing,

[34:30] which is causing you to feel overwhelmed, which is probably the real reason you feel like you don't have time.

[34:34] Jeff Bezos got the same time you do, right? It's just, what are the things that you're doing that he's not?

[34:40] It's not about adding shit to your play. It's about removing stuff that's not working.

[34:43] Because clearly, every minute you're doing this feeling your time is not making you more money.

[34:46] So you're doing the wrong shit. So there's going to be plenty of time. Because all this that you're doing now

[34:51] does not work. Right? Sounds simple. But that's the reason, right? So we want macro,

[34:57] macro. When then, hey, in the future, we're not got time. I'll totally sign up for your program.

[35:05] Right? Anyone heard this one? Anyone say this one? Right? And again, you want to empathize.

[35:13] You don't say like, oh, that's bullshit. You say, totally understand, that's I was talking like this for years.

[35:17] If you can step in their shoes, you're not attacking them. You actually go from inside out.

[35:21] You step into their self. And then you walk them through the epiphany that you experience.

[35:25] And it doesn't feel judgemental. It feels helpful. That makes sense.

[35:29] I used to feel the same way. Right? And I found this out actually from Jason Flaidland. He was the one who told me this,

[35:34] it's a logical fallacy. It's called the one then fallacy, which is why it's how I remember it.

[35:38] And the one then fallacy simply states, when I have X, then I will do Y. But it flips sequence.

[35:45] So it's like, when I get better, I will go to the hospital.

[35:49] Sorry. There's just so many hilarious ones about money and stuff like, I will start saving money once I'm rich.

[35:56] All right. The thing is is that we do this. Right? We do this.

[36:01] I'll pay for the program that'll make me more money when I have more money.

[36:06] That's the point of the program. I'll pay for the program that I'll help me get a six back. Once I have a six back.

[36:11] Once I have more time, which is the program that you don't say, it doesn't make it's a fallacy.

[36:16] And so what that means is it's a distortion. It's not real.

[36:20] And so the goal of having these high-states conversations is simply showing people. We're not attacking.

[36:26] We're just walking on through it and be like, do you realize that this is holding me back?

[36:30] And I know this better than anyone because I'm a skeptical motherfucker. The reason I can do all these logical things is because I'm the first person I had overcome.

[36:36] Right? And you might be too.

[36:40] So once we attack time from these three angles, it depends which one they present with.

[36:45] If they present with one and then move to the next, you can knock off three out. You'll probably find something that make the most sense to you.

[36:49] But the thing here is it's not about memorization. You just got to get it.

[36:53] Macro, you're always going to be busy. Once you want the most help, when you are busy so they can stick forever.

[36:58] Yes. Time. My wife showed me my phone. Turns out I got fucking time.

[37:03] But the reality is, it's not about what I am doing. It's about the stuff I got to stop doing.

[37:07] And that's what I help you with. Right? This isn't scripting. This is just understanding.

[37:11] Right? And then when then, it's a fallacy. It's a distortion. It's not real. And then just use two crazy examples.

[37:17] Like once I have money, then I'll save money when I'm rich. Right? It's just ridiculous.

[37:21] Okay. So what do we do? One reason down, and we're getting closer to the core. Right? Right?

[37:29] So, who here is somebody who's like, I can't afford it. It's too expensive or has heard this from a prospect.

[37:35] I'm just like a better see everybody's hands.

[37:38] Especially if you're selling high ticket. Hopefully you get a gas.

[37:40] So these are the four frameworks that I think there's a million money closes.

[37:44] But these are the ones that I like the most and that to me resonate the best. Right?

[37:51] And so why a lot is good is kind of like my first one here. And so the reason that if someone

[37:58] gasps or think that this is a lot of money, you just ask him, this is a lot of money to you.

[38:02] And they're going to say, yeah, if they say no, then you're like awesome by it. And if they say yes.

[38:07] And if they say yes, they know like that's the exact reason that you're going to be successful.

[38:11] Because there's other people who buy this thing and you know what? They're not all in on it.

[38:15] But the question is, do you want to draw the one and say and go all in? Do you want to step over the line

[38:18] and be the person you want to be? Because I can tell you that this is not about whether this works

[38:23] or not, I've already proven that the person is really you working on it. And so if you put more on the line,

[38:28] then you have a higher likelihood of being successful. So you should be the last person to be worried about this.

[38:33] A more excited because the best stories are always coming from people like you in your exact situation.

[38:38] So it only that the reason not to do it. That should be the reason to do it.

[38:41] So the next one is like, why is this not a lot? So first is the fact that it's a lot for you is good.

[38:46] It means you're going to try hard. The second one is like, well, it's a lot in terms of absolute amount,

[38:52] but relative amount is very little. Because if all this does, is that $10,000 a month here in gum,

[38:58] is it worth it? If all this does is get you into a bikini, is it worth it? Yeah.

[39:05] And so then what happens and the reason that this is a stepping process, right?

[39:09] Is that we're just taking these objections out of the way so we can get the person to confront reality

[39:14] and not to distort and they've created because the realities that they're afraid of.

[39:18] And so what happens is when they say, yeah, if they did that, it would be worth it.

[39:23] The problem is they don't believe you. And so it's like, great. Then it's not about the price.

[39:29] It's probably believe me so you can sidestep it. Does that make sense? We're taking a step closer.

[39:34] And then obviously you can use a comparison depending on what you're selling. If you can price anchor

[39:38] with like, well, here they don't have a four year degree for doing online fitness. That's why the

[39:43] alternate education industry exists. And it's because the form of education has failed most of us.

[39:49] Anybody graduated here with a four year degree? Anyone immediately be able to use that

[39:53] for a degree to get leads, make sales? No, maybe. And what's crazy is that some of these degrees

[40:02] are 50, $1200 and take four years when you've got something that can help you make

[40:09] that entire amount of money in half the time. For a tenth of the price, when you think about

[40:14] like that, frame, it's actually a great deal. So it makes sense? So you just frame it. You have to give

[40:20] context. So number one is the fact that it's a lot for you is good means you're actually going to

[40:26] try. Number two is if it doesn't, we say it's going to do the values there. So that's not actually

[40:32] what you're opposed to, which then we can take the next step. Number three is what's when you

[40:36] get for any ways. This is actually one of my favorite lines of reasoning for variety of reasons.

[40:42] And I'll get to it. When you're looking at prospect or looking yourself, you're going to spend

[40:46] this money either way over the next 12 months. You're going to spend it, right? And in fact,

[40:52] not only you're going to spend it, you're going to buy the program. The question is whether you're

[40:56] going to pay for it in money or pay for it in time. And so like you can learn every single lesson

[41:01] that's in this program, whether it's losing weight, you know, getting leads, selling online,

[41:06] whatever it is, right? You're going to learn these lessons. But do you want it to take 12 weeks,

[41:12] 12 years? And the questions are you going to be able to live a thousand lifetimes

[41:16] because of the thousand people that we've helped just like you? And gather all those lessons and put

[41:20] them together so you don't have to do the trial and error for that entire period of time. So the

[41:23] question is not whether you're going to buy it or not, it's just how do you want to pay? And so for me,

[41:28] this is a personal note. And I'll probably say at the end, but like the reason we've been on

[41:33] move quickly through life is that I will buy other people's mistakes because it's just the only

[41:37] way you can buy time in this life is to buy the knowledge to take less time from other people who

[41:43] have taken their time. And like if you think about human civilization in general,

[41:46] it's just to count how long to make a light bulb and then we just bought the lesson from him.

[41:50] And now we have light bulbs, right? And the next guy figures out the next thing and then we just

[41:53] buy the lesson from him. And that's how we have to move faster. So you're going to spend the money

[41:57] either way. The question is 12 months from now is it going to be on shit that didn't get you any more?

[42:01] Or stuff that is going to get you somewhere. And no matter what, you're buying the program,

[42:05] we're just going to pay time, we're going to pay with money. And if you're being real,

[42:09] you've probably been paying for time last six years. How's that working for you? Do you want to

[42:13] do more of that? This is also, this is a classic one. It's a very easy one to remember. But like

[42:19] who here knows the difference between a self-made billionaire when they had nothing and where you're

[42:26] at right now if you have nothing. Zero. They both, you're both broke. They were broke. Your

[42:32] broke, whatever it is, that's where you're at right now. The only difference is that that proves

[42:36] that if they were successful, it wasn't about the resources they had. There's a lot of resource

[42:41] that they were. So let's say it's a quick story about this. So anyone here read a shudog?

[42:47] Right, story of Nike. So in the story, he talks about how he was about to lose everything multiple

[42:54] times. It's a great story. And this time it was like, it was, it was going to go down. Like it wasn't

[42:59] going to happen. And he needed a tremendous amount of money and he just didn't have it. He'd extend

[43:03] it all as credit lines. The banks wouldn't do it. And the next line is that they canceled on him.

[43:07] And the company's going to fall because it was growing too fast. At that point, he could have just

[43:11] given up and said, there's nothing I can do. I've backed on my car, there's a max on my banks.

[43:14] There's literally nothing I can do. And his people already worked for free. They're like, we get

[43:18] into it. He went to his vendors and said, you need to pay my payroll for me. He went to his vendors.

[43:27] Anybody use like landing page software? Anyone? Or anyone? Or anyone who used something from

[43:30] a vendor? Right. It's like going to that, going to your video, I'll go for me, like listen,

[43:34] you got to pay payroll for me this month. Because otherwise, I'm not going to be able to keep

[43:38] doing business with you because I'll be out of business. Resourceful. Not resources. And the

[43:44] reason this is so important is because when you have nothing, it's the easiest excuse to give

[43:48] yourself. Because you're like, well, I have nothing. That's why I can't. So I have of course,

[43:52] but every self made millionaire and every self made billionaire was self made. And they started with

[43:56] nothing, which puts them the exact same seat you are. So the question is, do you want to have power?

[44:01] Or do you want to not have power? When have power, your resource will not resources. Right?

[44:07] And so if we want to make these decisions that are going to help ourselves, we need to step into that.

[44:11] And so when you're talking your prospects, it's the same thing. Right? Does that make sense?

[44:16] Okay, rockin'. I mean, you can drill deeper into this. Do you think there's anyone else who's been

[44:22] in your situation? Who's achieved this? Or maybe worse than your situation? They answered yes,

[44:27] and if they can, why can't you do? Right? So we're taking steps closer. Are you guys digging this?

[44:32] Okay, cool. Okay. Thanks.

[44:38] I wasn't sure if it was wrapped attention or sheer boredom. So we're not, you feel, you feel

[44:47] we're progress or make it like the person presents us is I don't have time. So then shit's busy,

[44:50] blah, blah, blah, you're like no, no, we're going to take one step closer like you know what?

[44:54] But I don't have the money, it's too expensive, you're like well, if you don't have the money,

[44:58] you're going to be successful. It's worth it, right? Yes, I understand why it's worth it. Well,

[45:02] you don't need money to begin with, right? You got to be resourceful and you can find the money.

[45:07] Because I'll ask you, this is a fun one for business owners. Who here has had an unexpected bill ever come up?

[45:14] Taxes? All right? Yeah. And then all, okay, so everyone here's still alive. Who raised their hands?

[45:23] Who here was able to magically pull money out of their ass and figure out a way to do it?

[45:29] Raise your hand. Here's what's crazy. You have the ability to be resourceful when it's for someone else.

[45:38] And not for you.

[45:41] And it's because you choose to be powerful when someone else needs it, but not for yourself.

[45:46] Fucked up, right? To stop doing it. If you function like you have to make payroll tomorrow

[45:54] and like you, you're back on rent and you're going to get kicked out, you think differently.

[45:59] And if instead of paying your landlord, you're paying you, because that's what you want to do,

[46:03] it shifts internally. Because everyone's here just prove the fact that you can be resourceful when you choose to be.

[46:10] So just choose to be. So number three is it's not sure it's a fit for me.

[46:15] So the side of the obvious one, which is like, I don't want to work out broccoli sucks.

[46:21] I can't do a program where I can't do cardio, whatever the fuck. Right?

[46:26] Like I said, I don't want to do D.M. I don't want to post an Instagram. I don't want to have a Facebook group,

[46:30] whatever, whatever the bullshit is. I'm not sure if the vehicle is a fit for me.

[46:34] So usually you can overcome the easy ones, but if someone is just really sticking hard,

[46:40] these are the three that I use to shift perspective. Okay? So this one is new identity and

[46:45] new priorities. So it's good to have cues for these things, which is like we vote with our dollars

[46:50] about the things that we care about. And if you show me what someone is spending their money in their

[46:54] time on, I can tell you what their future is. And I'll tell you an interesting story. So I had somebody who is

[46:59] just like you, who was like, you know what I don't want to do this either. And I told her this

[47:03] story, can I tell you it? Yes. And this is what you'd say the prospect. Right? So I was with Layla,

[47:09] and we went to Sephora, which is a makeup story. And I should have like this. I feel welcome.

[47:18] And so we're standing there, she's doing something, and I usually stand in the corner like this.

[47:22] And I saw these two little girls, I might have been like, I don't know girl age. So like 12 to 15,

[47:30] this like this, this. And they were like giggling so excited. And they had like the girl with the

[47:36] smock came over was like helping her out, helping them out. And she was like, okay, this is like eyeliner,

[47:42] and this is lipstick, and this is whatever blush. I'm just like using words I've heard.

[47:48] This is how you paint your face. And the thing is the girls were like so excited. And then they were like right

[47:54] before they left, she's like girls, she's like, you have to remember like now that you're getting older and you're

[47:59] becoming a woman, and you start budging for this stuff. All right, so you're going to start buying this every month.

[48:03] All right, so like, remember, you got to see if somebody for this, you can have it. And the girls were so excited

[48:08] that they were like, yes, like we're becoming women now, and these are the things that women do. And it's

[48:12] because when you have new identity, you have new priorities. And so you've had priorities that are aligned with your

[48:18] old identity, right? There's the youth that goes out, the youth that drinks, the youth that does the

[48:22] blah blah blah blah. Spence money and shit you shouldn't do. Spence time on shit you shouldn't be spending time on.

[48:26] And there's the youth that you want to be. And so right now, we can draw the line in the sand and be like,

[48:30] do you want to keep walking down the road that you have been walking? And if you don't, then you have to step into

[48:35] an identity. And with that new identity, you come through priorities. Because people who want to be rich

[48:40] spend money on themselves. They spend money on education. They invest in their skill sets.

[48:45] Because I want to align my identity with the identity of those who came before me who've done the things I want to do.

[48:51] Right? And just like those little girls stepping into that identity, we too must step into the identity we want to be.

[48:57] So make sense. And so when you're talking to somebody who's trying to lose weight and they're like,

[49:00] I can't afford a gym membership and you're like, girl, you spend a 200 bucks on your nails.

[49:05] And you've got a thousand hour outfit on. Do you think another thousand hour outfit would make you look better?

[49:11] Or your high school weight?

[49:15] Right?

[49:20] Do you think another thousand hour outfit would make you look better? Or be in rich as fuck?

[49:24] And I say that for those of you who are thinking about it on the money side, right?

[49:29] Like you waste my life. Some of you guys have bigger shoe collections than like,

[49:33] like fitness, like fitness people and shoes. It's like the weight like and Lulemon and the, you know,

[49:38] Spandex, like a hundred pieces. So it's like your whole wardrobe could be consolidated into a skill

[49:45] that could buy you as many wardrobe as you want if you chose to. Right? Okay. Rock it.

[49:50] I don't like this certain aspect. This is one of my favorite easiest ones to hit, which is like,

[49:56] you've got to change the change. Right? What you have been doing is been getting what you've been

[50:02] and you got to change the change because like, I remember I would go through meal plans with people

[50:06] and they'd be like, well, can we change this? Because this is what I eat for breakfast.

[50:09] Can we make that the breakfast? And I'm like, that breakfast makes you look like you.

[50:19] That way you spend your first four hours of the day. Makes your bank account look like what it does look like.

[50:27] Right? Taking steps. Right? We're getting closer to the truth.

[50:30] And so the thing is is that it's going to hurt to change because change hurts.

[50:36] And you've heard this one probably from Tony Robbins and if you have it, the question is whether

[50:40] the pain of staying the same is greater than the pain of change. And that's what we just asked someone.

[50:44] And this is in the help part. If someone's like, the pain of staying the same is not worse than

[50:49] this change. It's like, then girlfriend, like gain 50 more power to come back. You know what I mean? Like,

[50:53] get there. They mean hit rock bottom. This isn't it for you. I'm being real.

[50:58] Some people rock bottom is 12% body fat. Some people it's 500 pounds. But everyone's got one.

[51:06] You just got to know where your is. And all you really got to do is just move rock bottom.

[51:09] It's just kind of interesting because you start making a change here. Which is kind of interesting as a thought.

[51:14] But are you in enough pain? Is the question you asked the person?

[51:19] So for those of you who are unwilling to make a change because it feels contrary to like,

[51:23] I don't want to do that. I don't want to see them say, oh, I don't want to help people.

[51:26] I don't want to help people. I don't want to help people. I don't want to help people.

[51:28] I don't want to help people. I don't want to help people. I don't want to help people.

[51:30] I don't want to help people. I don't want to help people. I don't want to help people.

[51:34] I don't want to help people. I don't want to help people. I don't want to help people.

[51:38] I don't want to help people. I don't want to help people. I don't want to help people.

[51:42] I don't want to help people. I don't want to help people. I don't want to help people.

[51:46] I don't want to help people. I don't want to help people. I don't want to help people.

[51:50] I don't want to help people. I don't want to help people. I don't want to help people.

[51:54] I don't want to help people. I don't want to help people.

[51:58] I don't want to help people. I don't want to help people.

[52:02] I don't want to help people. I don't want to help people.

[52:06] I don't want to help people. I don't want to help people.

[52:10] I don't want to help people. I don't want to help people.

[52:14] I don't want to help people. I don't want to help people.

[52:18] I don't want to help people. I don't want to help people.

[52:22] I don't want to help people.

[52:24] I don't want to help people.

[52:26] I don't want to help people.

[52:28] I don't want to help people.

[52:30] I don't want to help people.

[52:32] I don't want to help people.

[52:34] I don't want to help people.

[52:36] I don't want to help people.

[52:38] I don't want to help people.

[52:40] I don't want to help people.

[52:42] I don't want to help people.

[52:44] I don't want to help people.

[52:46] I don't want to help people.

[52:48] I don't want to help people.

[52:50] I don't want to help people.

[52:52] I don't want to help people.

[52:54] I don't want to help people.

[52:56] I don't want to help people.

[52:58] I don't want to help people.

[53:00] I don't want to help people.

[53:02] I don't want to help people.

[53:04] I don't want to help people.

[53:06] I don't want to help people.

[53:08] I don't want to help people.

[53:10] I don't want to help people.

[53:12] I don't want to help people.

[53:14] I don't want to help people.

[53:16] I don't want to help people.

[53:18] I do green beans.

[53:20] I do green beans.

[53:22] Green beans are the same here.

[53:24] Some people would be fucking amazed.

[53:28] How many times should that happen?

[53:30] One crazy thing.

[53:32] We did that.

[53:34] We're 10 minutes ago.

[53:36] That's how you do hypothetical.

[53:38] We're making progress.

[53:40] Still with me.

[53:42] Authority.

[53:44] This is one of my favorite.

[53:46] This one instead of having three, I really just have one very good statement of reasoning that you should understand.

[53:56] This is real shit.

[53:58] This is more of a process than anything else.

[54:02] The spouse or decision maker is not there.

[54:04] For you guys, a lot of you guys have had the opportunity to talk to a spouse.

[54:08] A lot of you don't have that in your business.

[54:10] It's about saying that.

[54:12] They're not going to be there.

[54:14] They're not going to be there.

[54:16] They're not going to be there.

[54:18] They're not going to be there.

[54:20] They're not going to be there.

[54:22] They're not going to be there.

[54:24] They're not going to be there.

[54:26] They're not going to be there.

[54:28] They're not going to be there.

[54:30] They're not going to be there.

[54:32] They're not going to be there.

[54:34] They're not going to be there.

[54:36] They're not going to be there.

[54:38] They're not going to be there.

[54:40] They're not going to be there.

[54:42] They just overcome the thing, which has nothing to do with the spouse.

[54:46] Because spouse isn't there.

[54:48] Very easy side set.

[54:50] Does that make sense?

[54:51] This works really well.

[54:52] Why wouldn't they?

[54:53] It looks like they don't want me to fail.

[54:55] They don't want you to fail.

[54:57] Let's talk about you.

[54:59] This is the process that I walked through.

[55:02] Do they approve of your current struggle?

[55:04] They happy that you're struggling.

[55:06] No.

[55:08] They're not going to fail.

[55:09] They're not going to fail.

[55:10] They're not going to fail.

[55:11] They're not going to fail.

[55:12] They're not going to fail.

[55:14] They're not going to fail.

[55:16] They're not going to fail.

[55:17] They're not going to fail.

[55:18] They're not going to fail.

[55:19] They're not going to fail.

[55:21] They're not going to fail.

[55:22] They're not going to fail.

[55:23] They're not going to fail.

[55:24] They're not going to fail.

[55:25] They're not going to fail.

[55:26] They're not going to fail.

[55:27] They're not going to fail.

[55:28] They're not going to fail.

[55:29] They're not going to fail.

[55:30] They're not going to fail.

[55:31] They're not going to fail.

[55:32] They're not going to fail.

[55:33] They're not going to fail.

[55:34] They're not going to fail.

[55:36] Would you support her?

[55:38] Then why would you support you?

[55:40] Right?

[55:41] Right.

[55:42] And I think the real problem that we're dealing with here, and this is the kicker,

[55:46] the scraver everybody, is that you're asking for permission instead of support.

[55:52] Because it is your life, not theirs.

[55:55] And what happens is if you give that power to them,

[55:58] and then two years or now, you're still fat, you're still poor.

[56:03] Whatever it is, who are you going to blame?

[56:06] Then.

[56:07] And so that's when you have a resentful marriage because you didn't own your shit.

[56:11] And so I'm not saying you shouldn't like explain the decision to them.

[56:16] But the way you explain to them is what I just said, which is if I don't do this for me,

[56:21] I'm going to end up resenting you.

[56:23] And I don't want that.

[56:25] And instead of me bitching to you every day about how we don't have money or about how I don't like my body,

[56:29] I'm now doing this, and I'm doing a group of support of community of people just like me.

[56:32] And crazy enough, for some reason doctors go to college, right?

[56:37] That makes sense, they go to medical school, lawyers go to law school,

[56:41] but we're to watch runners go.

[56:42] There's no one to watch runners school, no one teaches the stuff,

[56:45] but it turns out there are people to teach it just for this specific industry.

[56:48] And I can take failures of a thousand people and pack it into a year.

[56:52] And it's one tenth of the price of a four year degree.

[56:57] Right?

[56:59] And so instead of wanting to do what I commit to, is it much better husband,

[57:03] a better wife, a better partner, I'm not going to bitch to you about this stuff,

[57:06] because I'm going to take this seriously and go all in, and I'm not asking for permission.

[57:09] I'm just asking for your support.

[57:11] All right, that's how you can overcome it.

[57:13] Because I'm be real with you.

[57:15] It is about them, and you have to believe that.

[57:18] Like you can't say this unless you believe it, because like you will,

[57:21] you save marriages by showing people that they are the ones in control.

[57:26] Because if they keep saying my husband's not going to let me buy a weight loss program,

[57:30] what do you think she's secretly saying?

[57:32] Can't believe you won't let me do it.

[57:34] Right?

[57:35] If that's real, if she's using it as a foil, you side said,

[57:37] you get to sell.

[57:38] Right?

[57:39] But that might be the real thing.

[57:41] And if that is the thing, then you have to lift them step into that.

[57:44] And that's where, you know, having a, that's where like,

[57:47] having a three day no-spot guarantee or something like that is also helpful.

[57:50] It's like, hey, sorry, now.

[57:51] And I use a lot of rapport and humor in my selling,

[57:54] and so I feel like, hey, Cindy, if you sign up, and you tell your husband,

[57:59] and he's upset, you have, and when he sees you, he's like,

[58:03] girl, I don't want you to get in shape.

[58:05] I want you to stay overweight.

[58:07] I want you to put those sweat pants on.

[58:08] I want you to sit on that couch.

[58:09] Reach your hand and bag of cheetos.

[58:11] Put the cheetos fingers on there.

[58:13] I want you to create generational unhealthy.

[58:16] I want you to live 10 years less long.

[58:18] I want you to see our grandkids.

[58:19] I don't want that, right?

[58:20] I want to marry a younger, better you sooner,

[58:23] because you're going to have a heart attack.

[58:25] If he says that to you, you haven't come in,

[58:27] then they're like, cracking up and you're like, okay, okay.

[58:29] Listen, sign up, three day no sweat.

[58:32] If he does tell you that he just wants you to be out of shape

[58:35] and never leave him because he doesn't want you to get too hot

[58:38] because he doesn't secure.

[58:39] If he says that, yeah, just let me know.

[58:41] All right?

[58:42] So like the whole time you're just joking and stuff,

[58:44] but the three to guarantee helps like,

[58:45] not a lot of these people over.

[58:47] Is that cool? You guys get that one?

[58:48] Okay.

[58:50] Wait.

[58:52] And so that goes for you, right?

[58:54] It's about support, not permission.

[58:56] That's the bottom line, right?

[58:58] Support, not permission.

[58:59] Because otherwise you're going to blame them

[59:00] for your lack of dreams being realized

[59:02] rather than blaming the person that should, which is you.

[59:04] All right.

[59:05] So this is avoidance.

[59:06] Now we're getting to the core.

[59:08] We've gotten rid of time.

[59:09] We know that you've got time and the best time to do it

[59:12] is today because you're going to be busy forever, right?

[59:16] Value?

[59:17] We know that you can't afford it?

[59:19] If you can't afford it, you'll buy it.

[59:21] If you can't afford it, it's a great reason to do it.

[59:22] If the value's there, then there's no reason not to do it

[59:25] because it'll pay for itself.

[59:26] Right? And what's one of good for anyways?

[59:28] You're going to pay for the program with our list.

[59:29] You're going to pay in less time and more time.

[59:31] Value's not a problem.

[59:32] Fit. You've got to step into your identity.

[59:34] Right?

[59:35] You've got to be willing to change.

[59:38] And the question is just whether the pain that you're experiencing

[59:41] is less than the pain of the change that takes to experience the next thing.

[59:44] Right?

[59:46] They step into that. They're good.

[59:48] Because it's not about resources, it's about resourcefulness.

[59:51] So, fit's not an issue.

[59:53] Authority? They have to own it.

[59:55] It's about support and automation.

[59:57] We all hear? Do you feel like we've peeled the layers back

[59:59] on your prospects?

[60:00] And they're just laid bare naked there.

[60:02] You've solicited the sale.

[60:05] Now you've got to close.

[60:07] All right?

[60:08] Avoidance.

[60:09] So now they're like, wait, do you think about it?

[60:13] So, now that we've exhausted and I'm putting this as emphasis,

[60:17] we've exhausted all outside reasons.

[60:20] Now we're finally talking to someone in power.

[60:23] And that's what a good coach does.

[60:24] We don't make decisions for people.

[60:26] We help them make decisions.

[60:27] So here's what I have to think about it.

[60:29] Not sure.

[60:30] Give me a hand.

[60:31] Who's dealt with somebody who says things that way.

[60:33] All right.

[60:34] At least one person in your own community.

[60:35] All you guys, that. You guys are great.

[60:37] So this is how I divide this up.

[60:39] Past present future.

[60:40] And so hopefully this should already before I dive into these,

[60:43] give you simple frameworks to work through.

[60:45] Time you've got macro macro when then.

[60:47] Right? You've got value.

[60:49] You're thinking about, it's not a lot of money.

[60:51] Even if a world a lot of money is not a lot of money,

[60:53] you're going to pay for it either way.

[60:54] You have the simple frameworks that you can walk through.

[60:56] You might just hit them with one.

[60:57] And if they hit it with again, you don't have the other angle.

[60:59] Because they're logical frameworks.

[61:00] They're not scripts.

[61:01] That's why I made them bubbles.

[61:02] You know what to remember.

[61:03] I just got to understand it.

[61:04] Past.

[61:05] So like, I need to think about it.

[61:07] And so the thing is, and this, the first bubble there is if someone's like,

[61:10] I feel like this is happening so fast.

[61:11] And we're getting that one.

[61:12] Like, I just got on the phone with you.

[61:14] I don't really know who you are.

[61:15] And you're like, hey, there's not a fast decision.

[61:17] Right? You've been making the decision for the last six years.

[61:20] You can continue to make the decision.

[61:21] All we're doing to say is this is how you're actually going to do something about it.

[61:24] Right? How long you wanted to lose weight for a long time?

[61:27] So this is not a fast decision at all.

[61:29] But the thing is, is that, and this is where you go suck cost.

[61:33] So if I were talking to you guys, I would say,

[61:35] you know, you bought tickets because you saw some ad.

[61:38] You registered there, you got your flights, you got to hotel, you blocked the time,

[61:43] you flew here, you listened this whole thing.

[61:46] You're six inches from gold.

[61:48] This isn't a fast decision at all.

[61:50] You did all these things to get here because it's important to you.

[61:53] So don't let that distortion stop you from getting what you want.

[61:57] Right? It's fear. Right?

[61:59] Let's face that.

[62:00] What are you afraid of having happened?

[62:02] Which, by the way, I took the slide out, but my two favorite questions to ask in a

[62:06] an astale that I feel like are the fastest to cut through.

[62:10] Is what are you most afraid of having happened if you buy?

[62:13] What are you most afraid of? What's the worst thing?

[62:16] That you envision in your mind?

[62:18] And if they're not sure I just feel in the blanks, I'm like, I take your credit card,

[62:20] I swipe over as much as I possibly can.

[62:22] I go to Vegas, I put it all on black,

[62:24] and then I go to Monaco where the can't actually do it.

[62:27] Fair enough? And they're like, I was not thinking that and you're like, right?

[62:30] So what's the real thing?

[62:33] Like, and then they're like, you know, I just have lots of any programs before.

[62:37] You're like, right? Let's talk about that.

[62:40] Right? And so I'm going to skip one for it and then I'm going to go back to it.

[62:44] This is one of my favorite obstacle or objection overcomes.

[62:48] I call it Don't Lette Bernie twice.

[62:50] And this literally, you can see the date that happened yesterday.

[62:52] This girl texted me or mess April 6th.

[62:54] She said, it's crazy to think that I'd say I was going with you six years ago,

[62:58] and I'm kicking myself in the butt for not jumping on this yesterday.

[63:01] Right? Like, I don't even on the company anymore.

[63:03] And I said, you let a bad decision Bernie twice.

[63:05] Once when you made your poor investment, but a second time when you let that bad investment,

[63:09] stop you from a good investment.

[63:10] It would be like, anybody ever have a boy friend or girlfriend in middle school or high school

[63:14] that they're not currently married to?

[63:16] Anyone? Just like, just come on.

[63:19] Help me out here. Okay.

[63:21] It would be like having a bad eighth grade boy friend or girlfriend

[63:25] and being like, you know what?

[63:26] Man art for me.

[63:30] All coaches suck. Right?

[63:33] There's good coaches, there's bad coaches.

[63:35] There's crazy ass pitches, there's crazy ass dudes.

[63:37] You know what I mean? Like, there's also good ones.

[63:39] And so things, if you stop, if you let the bad one prevent you from the good one,

[63:42] you get burned by being with the bad one,

[63:44] and because you let the bad one control your next decision.

[63:47] Right?

[63:48] And so when someone is had about experience with doing keto or whatever the fuck,

[63:52] right?

[63:53] Where you had a bad experience with some program that you did or did not do,

[63:56] or they didn't fit whatever.

[63:58] Either way, don't let that burn you twice because no matter what you're going to have to do,

[64:02] you're going to have to do these actions.

[64:04] Whether you're part of the program or not.

[64:06] You got to do these workouts.

[64:07] Where you're part of the program or not, doesn't matter.

[64:09] You're going to have to do it.

[64:10] See, my is will do it, but somebody's going to get you there fast.

[64:12] Right?

[64:13] Let me go back one more time.

[64:14] So, it's not a fast decision.

[64:17] And this is another one that I love, which is,

[64:19] do you think that you're maybe in this position because you have struggled to make it a

[64:22] decision in the past?

[64:23] You have waffles when it came time to make the hard call.

[64:26] Have you been in this conversation and said no before?

[64:29] Yeah.

[64:30] Do you think that's why you're here?

[64:32] Yeah.

[64:33] Do you think that might be the reason you should change that?

[64:36] Yeah.

[64:37] Okay.

[64:38] Let's change it.

[64:39] What is the decision?

[64:40] Change your life.

[64:41] And the last one is like, are you tired of another year of almost?

[64:44] Right?

[64:45] Tired of another year of almost hitting your goals.

[64:47] Almost getting to 10k a month of almost, you know,

[64:50] piring the team that you wanted.

[64:52] Almost retiring your wife or husband or almost moving into the neighborhood that you wanted to move into.

[64:56] Or almost being able to pay for your kids recreational sports rather than not being able to get a for it.

[65:00] Retired of another year of almost.

[65:02] Well, if you're tired of another year, almost, then we can't do what we're doing again here for another year.

[65:06] Because we're going to get another year almost.

[65:08] And so the question isn't what it cost you, but how much has it cost you to not decide up to this point?

[65:14] Right?

[65:15] The cost of inaction.

[65:18] And I think that when we think about our lives in reverse, we never regret the things that we did.

[65:22] We regret the things we didn't do.

[65:23] The opportunities that we let pass by.

[65:26] And I think that if you can let that person step into that power,

[65:28] it will make the decision to help themselves.

[65:30] Like this person did not.

[65:32] All right.

[65:33] President.

[65:34] So, depends on your talking.

[65:36] So, we're talking about past stuff and you do it the past stuff.

[65:39] The second frame for avoidance is present, which is they just don't know how to make a fucking decision.

[65:43] Right?

[65:44] And so you have to help them make a decision.

[65:45] And so this one, the rocking chair, is one that I just for some reason I've used a tremendous amount of time, especially when I saw a weight loss.

[65:51] Is it like, I just really, really need to think about it.

[65:54] But I told him to understand.

[65:56] Well, let's walk through like what that looks like.

[65:58] You're not going to like go home sitting the rocking chair, you know, smokestig grab because of course you're not helping it.

[66:02] Right?

[66:03] You'll quit when you're healthy.

[66:04] Right?

[66:05] You're smoking your cigarette and you're like, oh, I'm like going to do this weight loss program.

[66:08] Right?

[66:09] You're sitting there and staring at the clouds.

[66:10] I wonder.

[66:11] No, of course, you're getting your car and then you're going to realize you got to pick up Timmy from soccer practice.

[66:14] You've got to go to school, you've got to clean, you've got to pick up, you know, go to the laundry, you've got to do all these things, right?

[66:18] And then three, four, five days from there, you're going to put on that old pair of jeans and it's not going to fit me like fuck.

[66:24] And just there, go have made the decision.

[66:27] You know, keep living your life.

[66:29] And so let's just make it now.

[66:31] Because the reality is that it doesn't take information today, make decisions.

[66:34] So I just have to take time, make decisions.

[66:36] Takes information.

[66:37] And I'm the only source to do information you've got.

[66:40] So let's stop.

[66:41] I'm here.

[66:42] I'm here for you.

[66:43] Let's do it.

[66:44] Right?

[66:45] Because that's the fallacy.

[66:46] Is that people think they need more time to make decisions because they assume they will get more information in that time.

[66:52] But if you are the source of the information, then time does not help them.

[66:57] And so let's confront it now.

[66:58] And let me answer the question, you have to make the decision.

[67:00] One way or another.

[67:01] Does that make sense?

[67:02] Yeah.

[67:03] All right.

[67:04] And so then they're like, well, then fuck, how do I make a decision?

[67:07] You're like, like, like, yes.

[67:08] So there's three things that we got to understand.

[67:10] Do you believe that this product of service is going to help you achieve what you want?

[67:14] Yes or no?

[67:15] They're going to say yes.

[67:17] Right?

[67:18] If they don't, you can confront it.

[67:19] Note all of these are confronting decisions.

[67:22] So we've moved all the way down the onion.

[67:24] Right?

[67:25] We're at truth now.

[67:26] And all the theme of the last bullet is confrontation.

[67:30] We have to confront the decision.

[67:32] We got to peel it back and be like, oh, are we going to do this or not?

[67:35] Right?

[67:36] Because we've already got out the time.

[67:37] We got out the spit.

[67:38] We got everything out of the way.

[67:39] That's just you.

[67:40] Do you think this is going to help you get close to your goals?

[67:43] Yes or no?

[67:44] Two.

[67:45] Do you trust me to fulfill my word that I said I'm going to help you.

[67:48] I'm going to do these calls.

[67:49] I'm going to do these workouts.

[67:50] I'm going to do whatever.

[67:51] Right?

[67:52] Three.

[67:53] This is the most important one.

[67:54] Do you think it'll work for you?

[67:56] And if they say no, you say why not?

[67:58] And then they have to defend the one on.

[68:00] And then it's very easy.

[68:01] At that point, it's a six inch part.

[68:03] Right?

[68:04] And once they say yes to all three, which is usually what will happen.

[68:06] They're like, well, we'll make the decision together.

[68:07] Do you know how to make the decision?

[68:08] They'll say no.

[68:09] You go through the three.

[68:10] The last question is they said yes, yes, yes.

[68:12] It's just, do you have or have access to the amount of money to get started?

[68:16] Do you have the MX?

[68:17] Do you want to help you enroll in an MX?

[68:19] Because I want to help you.

[68:21] I'm good either way.

[68:23] But if you believe that this is going to help you get closer, you believe that what

[68:26] I'm saying is true.

[68:27] And you believe that you can be successful.

[68:28] It's my more obligation to get you going.

[68:30] And do everything in my power to help you get the money or get access to it.

[68:33] Because the real real is, if I was giving you a Ferrari right now for $5,000, you'd find the money.

[68:37] If you're landlord needed to come up with $10,000, because you had background in payroll, you'd

[68:41] find the money.

[68:42] Let's do it.

[68:43] Right?

[68:44] Three.

[68:46] Who wants to make informed decisions?

[68:48] Yes?

[68:52] How can you make informed decision?

[68:53] Do you have any more to try it?

[68:56] So this is when you have some element of trial in the program, or some sort of guarantee, which

[69:01] is why I have a big fan of guarantees?

[69:03] It's like, well, you can't make the decision to buy.

[69:06] That's informed until you're on the inside.

[69:08] So I'm not even asking to make a decision right now.

[69:10] I'm just actually making informed decision that you can only do on the inside.

[69:14] And if after 30 days, I'm not what I said, this product doesn't do what I told you.

[69:17] I didn't fulfill my promise and you don't think it's going to work for you, you let me know.

[69:20] I'll give you money back.

[69:22] Low pressure.

[69:23] You get someone to decide, but not deciding.

[69:25] You have an easier.

[69:26] That makes sense?

[69:27] Think that'll have you close?

[69:29] Yeah.

[69:30] All right.

[69:31] And then this one is, it depends on who you're selling to, but sometimes you've

[69:35] a logical person.

[69:36] So do you know what deciding even means, like where the etymology that

[69:40] works from, it's decaderae, which is ladden, which means to cut off, kill off.

[69:45] And so the question is, which future are we killing off today?

[69:50] Are we killing off the future of the dreams that you want?

[69:54] Are we killing off the future?

[69:56] Sorry.

[69:57] Are we killing off the future of not doing anything?

[70:02] And the life that you've lived up to this point?

[70:04] Because indecision is a decision.

[70:06] Inaction is an active decision, right?

[70:08] And so it's just, which one are we killing today?

[70:10] We killing your dreams?

[70:11] Where are we going to pass?

[70:12] Second, last one.

[70:14] Future.

[70:15] So we talked about past, so if they're thinking about the past, things that hurt them, don't

[70:19] hurt burn you twice, et cetera, right?

[70:20] They don't know how to make a decision, rocking chair.

[70:22] This is how you make a decision.

[70:23] Three things you've access to the money.

[70:25] Great.

[70:26] Let's get going.

[70:27] You want to kill your past.

[70:28] You want to kill your future, right?

[70:29] Awesome.

[70:30] We're talking about the future.

[70:31] We're talking about the future.

[70:32] We're talking about the future.

[70:33] We're talking about the future.

[70:34] We're talking about the future.

[70:35] We're talking about the future.

[70:36] We're talking about the future.

[70:37] We're talking about the future.

[70:38] We're talking about the future.

[70:39] We're talking about the future.

[70:40] We're talking about the future.

[70:41] We're talking about the future.

[70:42] We're talking about the future.

[70:43] We're talking about the future.

[70:44] We're talking about the future.

[70:45] We're talking about the future.

[70:46] We're talking about the future.

[70:47] We're talking about the future.

[70:48] We're talking about the future.

[70:49] We're talking about the future.

[70:50] We're talking about the future.

[70:51] We're talking about the future.

[70:52] We're talking about the future.

[70:53] We're talking about the future.

[70:54] We're talking about the future.

[70:56] This is logic.

[70:57] Let's consider the options.

[70:59] Option one.

[71:01] You do the thing.

[71:02] You get the result.

[71:04] Life is awesome.

[71:05] Option two.

[71:06] You don't do the thing.

[71:08] You don't get the result.

[71:09] You didn't do the thing.

[71:10] Option three.

[71:11] You do the thing.

[71:12] But then you don't get the result.

[71:13] All these are the options that can happen in front of you.

[71:16] Because we have a guarantee, they're all risk free.

[71:19] Except for one of them.

[71:20] Only one of them has a true guarantee of not getting where you want.

[71:23] Which is walking out the door.

[71:25] Which risk free option you want.

[71:26] The one that's risk free.

[71:27] That guarantees that you're not going to get there.

[71:29] Or the one that's risk free.

[71:30] And has the potential to get you where you want to go.

[71:33] Right?

[71:34] That's not an emotional close.

[71:36] Flage it.

[71:37] And if you have an offer that's set up that way, you should be able to close most people

[71:40] as long as they don't think you're an asshole.

[71:42] Right?

[71:43] Okay.

[71:44] This is one that's more around urgency.

[71:46] Because again, this is avoidance.

[71:47] If someone says, I'm still not sure.

[71:50] I want to think about it more or whatever.

[71:52] You're not going to struggle forever, right?

[71:54] Like you don't want to struggle forever.

[71:56] You're going to do something about this.

[71:57] Whether it's weight loss, business, whatever.

[71:59] They're going to say yes.

[72:00] If you're going to fix your business eventually,

[72:03] you might as well start fixing it now.

[72:06] So you can start enjoying the fruits of that labor sooner.

[72:09] Would you prefer making more money faster or slower?

[72:12] What's your preference?

[72:13] Great.

[72:14] So if you're going to do it eventually, you might as well do it now.

[72:16] Does it make sense?

[72:17] It's a little nudge.

[72:18] This is a funnel that I just really like from a framework perspective,

[72:21] which is instead of like this has to be my savior.

[72:25] This program has to get me to an I-F-B-B pro bikini body.

[72:29] And I'm 100 pounds overweight.

[72:31] Probably not realistic, right?

[72:34] Reframing the question is, do you think that making the decision is going to be

[72:39] how you get closer or further from your goal?

[72:42] That's it.

[72:43] Because if we keep making decisions that keep getting us closer,

[72:45] we will get there eventually.

[72:47] But if we make decisions that get us further away,

[72:49] we will not get there.

[72:50] And so do you think that this is going to get you closer to your goal?

[72:52] Then what you're currently doing?

[72:53] Yes.

[72:54] What are we waiting for?

[72:55] We don't need to be snipers.

[72:56] We need to be directionally right.

[72:58] We do that long enough.

[72:59] We'll get there.

[73:00] Does that make sense?

[73:01] That helps you too because we have this fear of perfectionism.

[73:04] Is this going to be the one?

[73:06] Probably not.

[73:07] But it will get you fucking way closer, right?

[73:10] Second time, there's no one program going to change my mind.

[73:13] But the decision to buy education changed my life forever.

[73:17] Does that make sense?

[73:18] Yes.

[73:19] All right.

[73:20] Boom.

[73:21] And so look at the top.

[73:23] We have no reasons left.

[73:25] Not to own the power that you have.

[73:27] It's just you.

[73:29] All right.

[73:30] And here's bonus number six.

[73:31] And you can use this as one of like, there are some closes that you use all the time.

[73:36] You always go back to.

[73:37] Right?

[73:38] The reason you are telling yourself not to do this is the reason you need to do it.

[73:41] How long do you want?

[73:42] I can't afford this to be on your list of problems in life.

[73:46] The fact that you don't have time is they're very reason you need to do this.

[73:49] The fact that you're so dependent on your spouse is the reason you need to take this decision and own it.

[73:54] Right?

[73:55] The fact that you're not sure about the person that you want to be is the very reason that we're going to help you get it in this program.

[73:59] So whatever the reason is is usually the biggest chain that you're holding on to is the thing that you're enslaving yourself to is the thing that you're casting your power to.

[74:07] If you break that chain, power comes back to you.

[74:10] And so the very reason that you're holding yourself back is typically the very reason that you need to do it.

[74:14] So hopefully this helps you realize that you and your clients are always in complete power.

[74:18] Did I accomplish that?

[74:19] Yes.

[74:20] Awesome.

[74:21] Thank you.

[74:23] Thank you.

[74:28] And like I promised at the beginning of my hope is that you become more powerful by making decisions rather than letting life make them for you.

[74:34] All right. So here's a few final thoughts.

[74:37] Forgons are created by taking a lot of risk with a little bit of money.

[74:42] Forgons are maintained by taking a little bit of risk with a lot of money.

[74:46] And every one of those people that will self-may takes a lot of risk for a little bit of money.

[74:51] And sometimes you need to take that step because it's the only way to build the portion.

[74:55] All right.

[74:56] And if everything that I've ever made in my life, all right.

[74:59] Everything that I've made in my life is a result of investing in my own education.

[75:03] It has gotten me far higher returns than any stock, any real estate, any crypto.

[75:08] All right.

[75:09] Any whatever.

[75:10] By a mile.

[75:11] And people say like it's all about investing yourself like I just I think it sounds a more

[75:14] Fist.

[75:15] It's like by experience and skills.

[75:18] Because no government can take that from you.

[75:21] No divorce can take that from you.

[75:23] Nothing can take that from you.

[75:25] And I come from a family where so we're Persian.

[75:28] And so my parents had to flee Iran during the revolution.

[75:33] And so they had land and houses and other stuff, right.

[75:39] And my uncle was the brother to a guy who started the lottery in Iran.

[75:45] He owned the lottery because you can do that there.

[75:48] Very rich.

[75:50] And so my dad and him, he once had won them.

[75:53] My dad went to the US.

[75:56] He had no skills.

[75:58] And he was able to just forge enough money to buy a print shop.

[76:01] And he lives above the print shop in London.

[76:03] And still to this day, that's what he does.

[76:05] And once I visited him, it was incredibly sad.

[76:09] Seeing just like, once I was in his wife, my dad gave her a scarf and it was like a nice scarf

[76:14] apparently.

[76:15] And she just bought.

[76:16] She's like, I used to have rooms of the nine.

[76:18] Nothing involved.

[76:19] Right.

[76:20] My dad came to the United States with $1,000.

[76:23] Because he had skills.

[76:24] He built it off from scratch.

[76:26] And so I'm a user doctor as all Middle Eastern and Indian Zark.

[76:30] Right.

[76:33] Dr. Luiar County engineer.

[76:35] Anyways, the only four proof paths.

[76:38] But when we say investing that we come from a place where like, it was literally all taken.

[76:43] The government was like, that's our house now.

[76:46] That's our land now.

[76:48] That big account is our bank account now.

[76:51] And so that was why it was so.

[76:52] And like that might be a benefit for me.

[76:54] I had somebody who was always like, it's the only thing no one can take for me.

[76:58] And so why would you not invest in the one thing that can never be stolen, can never be taken

[77:02] in compounds with time.

[77:04] And it increases your capacity to make money.

[77:07] It increases your capacity to live.

[77:10] And so I like to think of the investments that I've made of myself as bricks on a bridge.

[77:15] And so if I'm on the bottom left here, and where I want to be is the top right.

[77:19] I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I

[77:49] I shouldn't get closer. And if I get better, I'll get there eventually, right, as long as I don't stop moving. And so that's why that's what I've dedicated my life to education.

[77:58] My mission is to document and share the best practices of building world past companies.

[78:02] Because when you realize that you are the source, you realize that Superman is not coming.

[78:07] It's just you.

[78:09] And every decision that you make is a vote towards or against the person that we want to be.

[78:13] And so the question for you is that are your decisions voting towards the person that you want to become,

[78:18] or just more of what you already have. And so people ask me all the time, how do you move so quickly?

[78:24] And the answer is, I know how to buy time. And the five questions, how do you buy time?

[78:28] You buy time by buying the time. Took other people to make mistakes that taught them the lessons.

[78:33] How you do it? That's the heck. And so right now, the ignorance of not knowing how to create a million dollars a year,

[78:40] is costing you a million dollars a year. The fact that you don't know how to make a million dollars a year is costing you a million dollars a year.

[78:46] Think about it. Right? And so therefore, you should always be willing to invest money to increase the capacity for your income.

[78:53] Because once you have it, that capacity pays you forever.

[78:57] You're increasing your ability. Does that make sense?

[79:00] We're widening the pipe.

[79:02] And so when I thought about this, I just added zero to it. And I was like, it's fucking costing me a million dollars a year.

[79:07] Not knowing how to make a billion dollars.

[79:10] Right? But it's true because the thing, the number one tax that no one appreciates or no one respects is not the tax of the government.

[79:19] It's not capital gains, it's not income tax. It's the time tax of ignorance.

[79:24] Someone has lately yesterday, what's the number one thing that people from zero to 10k are messing up?

[79:30] You don't know what the fuck you're doing. That's messing you up.

[79:34] You're ignorant. You have no idea. You're eating an orange like an apple. No clue, right?

[79:39] And it's not because you don't have the processing power. It's not because you don't have the ability to reason.

[79:44] It's because you just don't know. And so the goal is to pay down the time tax at ignorance as fast as you can only possibly.

[79:51] I mean, the only way you do that is by educating and investing yourself.

[79:55] All right? Specifically investing in experiences that build skills.

[80:00] So make the decisions that to help yourself.

[80:03] And put my mind crazy. Take ownership because we just discovered that all the other shit is not real.

[80:09] It is literally a distortion of reality that anything that you give your power to that's not you is fake.

[80:15] You're making it a false god in your life and your prospects are too.

[80:18] And you now you know how to confront those when your mind tries to play tricks on you.

[80:23] And realize that there aren't those silver bullets. No program is going to save your life.

[80:27] All right? But some things can move you close to your goals.

[80:31] And when those rare opportunities present themselves, take them.

[80:35] All right? Because either you win or you learn and both of those get you close to where everyone will go.

[80:41] All right? And so I'll wrap up with this.

[80:45] Ten years ago, I had to, that was me in a swanky, you know, when I was a consultant, looking cool.

[80:53] It was actually after I don't even have a good picture when I was a consultant, but there's me in a suit.

[80:59] And I knew I hated the job that I had.

[81:03] I made okay money, but I just like, I just really wasn't happy.

[81:07] And I emailed 40 gym owners. I was like, hey, I think I want to get in fitness.

[81:12] Can somebody help me out? One guy was like, sure you can work for free.

[81:17] And I was like, how's that? And I got my same back to you.

[81:21] And anybody know who's the same back to you? Raise hand?

[81:25] Okay. Well, something you're saying is what he used to be known as. He actually died during COVID.

[81:29] Which is really sad for me because I really looked up to the same.

[81:33] And the thing is that when I got to his office, I literally drove across the country from Baltimore to LA,

[81:39] or Gina Hills, which was where he was.

[81:41] And I showed up without notice and he was like, you're a psychopath. I just mentioned the internet.

[81:45] He was like, I'm here. I'm ready to learn. He was like, I'm going to watch.

[81:49] And right after you came back from lunch, he was like, all right.

[81:54] So you should join my mastermind. And I was like, I'm on the gym. He's like, that's okay.

[81:59] Because the gym mastermind. And I mean, like, I was 22.

[82:05] Like, I did not have a lot of money. And he was like, well, it's 10 grand.

[82:11] And I was like, I don't know. He's like, you need a fucking commitment. He's like, you've been walklin' back and forth.

[82:17] I had had multiple phone calls for them before I left. He's like, I think you need to draw a line in the same.

[82:23] And thank you God. You know, thank God he did. Because I did take a step over.

[82:28] I had no idea what the fuck I was doing. But I was trying to start paying down the time tax of ignorance.

[82:33] And I got around a whole bunch of other fitness professionals. And I learned way more from all of them than I ever learned from them.

[82:40] But because of that, my belief started to change the ways I saw the world change, the traits I started to embody change, and started taking steps.

[82:47] The mastermind I got from Sam is not what made me a hundred million dollars.

[82:50] But it got me on the right path towards making it. And so if you can make those choices, I think it's the small steps.

[82:56] Not believing that it's going to be a savior. But believing that it's a line with where you want to go and believing in yourself that if you keep walking on this path, you'll get there.

[83:03] So thank you guys so much for your time.

[83:10] Thank you.

[00:00] You can be 99% of other businesses if you only pick one thing to beat them on.

[00:06] But there's four that you can compete on.

[00:07] All right, so that's what we're going to talk about.

[00:09] The first of the four vectors is speed.

[00:13] How do I do what I'm going to do faster than everybody else?

[00:16] Of the four vectors, I'm starting with speed because I actually think it's the most important of the four.

[00:21] And I think the reason for that is that humans learn behaviors with decreased latency, meaning.

[00:26] Like Facebook and Instagram, whatever you're watching this on, like, has trained us to come back,

[00:33] not because they've passed to come back because they have compressed latency for some

[00:37] positive outcome.

[00:38] And the positive outcome they give us is a thumbs up.

[00:41] They literally give us a little red light.

[00:43] And other people give actual money, but add it to lay and they struggle to get people to do things.

[00:48] So think about like this, you pay someone who works for you every two weeks.

[00:52] It's much harder to motivate them than if you actually paid them in real time.

[00:56] And paying someone in real time is actually so effective.

[01:00] It's illegal.

[01:01] Truckers, for example, used to be able to get paid per mile and, like, almost essentially in real time.

[01:07] And so they actually outlawed it because guys would just keep driving to the point of

[01:12] like insanity and win the sleep for days.

[01:14] And it was unsafe.

[01:15] That's how powerful speed is because that is what trains behavior.

[01:19] Functionally, the questions that we have to ask ourselves is, okay, if speed is going to be my competitive

[01:24] advantage, it doesn't matter what we do, right?

[01:25] If there's components to speed, right?

[01:27] So in one angle, like you have to think about each of these larger vectors in smaller subvectors.

[01:32] For speed, it could be the distance between one someone purchases and when they get something.

[01:36] Right? That's one vector of speed.

[01:38] The other vector is that if you're doing something on a recurring basis,

[01:41] how much time is it going to take each time?

[01:43] So for example, if I had a 10 minute workout, it's going to be more valuable than an hour long workout.

[01:48] If I could get the same results, if I say I'm going to help someone get leads and I can have

[01:51] them get those leads in an hour versus waiting a week to turn on the ads, that's more valuable.

[01:56] Right? And so in all times, it's always like, how can we take what we're currently doing into it faster?

[02:00] And I can promise you, if you just did that one thing, convert everyone else in your marketplace.

[02:05] You just delivered faster, you have a sustainable competitive advantage over them and be able to

[02:11] charge premium prices for it. And which really interesting about speed is that speed rarely actually

[02:16] costs more. It typically comes from idea alpha, meaning like idea over performance. Like you've

[02:22] thought through the process of their steps better than the competition has.

[02:26] It has a result you actually can get better outcomes. Now, part of this also comes down to what

[02:30] types of customers you're picking. If you have a hundred different types of customers,

[02:33] it's very difficult to do things quickly because you're doing lots of different things for lots

[02:36] different people. This is why, niching down also helps you provide more value because you're being

[02:40] more selective about the customers you're picking. And then as a result, you can mean we're

[02:44] templatized in the types of services and products that you ultimately offer. And so there's

[02:50] kind of three different vectors that I think about in terms of like, what can I actually do to

[02:54] improve speed? Because you're like, okay, I get that, but how do I actually do it? So number one is

[02:57] I want templates. All right, how can I take what we're currently doing and make these into templates?

[03:03] Can I have add templates? Can I email templates? Can I have landing page templates? Can I have

[03:06] presentation templates? Can I have at least template steps that someone's going to follow?

[03:10] Right? All of these are just templates that we can pass on to somebody else, create a repeat

[03:13] on process. If it's repeatable, they don't have to decide decision making is typically the slowest

[03:16] part of the organization. So how to remove all decisions to speed up the time of completion.

[03:20] The second one is pre-made. So if you're in physical products or even food, it's, I mean,

[03:26] fundamentally, McDonald's changed the game in fast food because they started pre-making food.

[03:30] They already had burgers on the line. So when someone ordered a burger, they just handed it

[03:34] to them. And if you haven't seen the movie founder great movie, he experiences and he's like,

[03:38] no, no, no, I just ordered. They're like, yeah, that's your burger. He's like, no, I just ordered.

[03:43] And they're like, yeah, that's your burger. And he's like, huh, and it's just big a homo.

[03:47] I'm like, oh, this changes everything. And so sometimes if you know, there was a great

[03:51] Persian place that used to go to. It crushes in California called Pini Cafe, go check it out.

[03:55] But they make amazing Persian food. But one of the things I realized is right is the lunch hour

[03:59] start because I live pretty close by back then. They just started grilling chicken because they knew

[04:03] that they were about to get the lunch rush. And they knew that they were going to have people

[04:06] who wanted DJ Kabaab shout out for those of you know. All right. And so they just thought ahead

[04:12] of time and it became really, because I would show up and be like, DJ Kabaab, exercise my whole

[04:16] thing. And they would just boom, they would deliver for me because they didn't even have to make

[04:19] two order because they just knew certain amount of things are always going to have to man.

[04:23] And even if for some reason, someday they're not going to hit that. The benefit they get of the vast

[04:27] majority of their customers immediately getting served and how many tables they returned faster,

[04:31] more than paid for the small extra chicken that maybe they didn't they had to throw out of the

[04:36] third element here. And this happens a lot with services is availability. Now what does this mean?

[04:41] I'll give you a couple examples. If you have a spa or a salon or something, if you have more availability

[04:46] for people to book, it means they want something and they can immediately get it faster. They can

[04:49] get the appointment with you to get the nails done, get their hair done. Basically the sooner you

[04:53] can have that availability, the more you will be able to convert and the more people will be

[04:56] willing to pay. And so if someone says, hey, I've been appointment in four days or I've been appointment

[05:00] in one day, they're probably far more likely to come to you and be willing to pay more for that

[05:04] one appointment. But how do you increase availability? Sometimes it means you have to pay people more

[05:09] or extend their hours or hire more people. But the reality is that this is one of those things that

[05:13] is one of the largest vectors in terms of increasing throughput on a business that is under-replicated

[05:18] by the vast majority of business owners. And so what I invest in the company where I look at

[05:22] a company, a lot of times I'm like, ooh, like it's one of those huge hit and diamonds I probably

[05:26] shouldn't even share this. But it's one of those hit and diamonds that I can almost always drive

[05:30] 20, 30, 40 percent more through business by simply better staffing the hours. Even at acquisition.com,

[05:36] we currently sell 12 hours of A7 days a week. And we're now investing so we can get to 20 hours

[05:41] today because we have such a larger international market. We always want to increase our availability

[05:45] because I know the math behind this and it's a huge impact all the bottom one. So the first vector

[05:51] macro vector that you can win on. And you only need one. But if you have more than one, you just

[05:56] dominate everyone. All right, is that we went over speed. Now the second is risk. All right. So

[06:04] how can we make our thing not risky? Now think about McDonald's. The example I gave you

[06:09] will they're both fast and they're not risky. So what does that actually mean? Now part of

[06:14] you're like, oh, no, they're risky because of cancer and all this stuff. Well, who looks ignore that

[06:17] because why? Why do people not care about this stuff? Actually it's funny. Speed. It's not latency.

[06:23] If you ate a burger to immediately had something growing on on you, no one would eat the burgers.

[06:27] But because it happens 40 years, so now no one cares. Speed changes behavior and lack of speed

[06:33] doesn't. So what about risk? So a way you can translate risk is reliability and consistency. So

[06:38] a different way of saying it, which is when people buy this is especially important for services that

[06:43] are recurring when people get month after month after month after month of your mother keep coming back

[06:46] again and again. And so the question is, how can we consistently match conditions between the

[06:50] perfect and ideal state and every state that happens afterwards? And most people dramatically

[06:55] underestimate the amount of variables that exist in any given encounter. And so as a result,

[06:59] they have far less consistency than the otherwise should. So that's just the output. Now what

[07:04] of the other components of this? So I'll say, when it's consistency, all right, in terms of decreasing

[07:09] risk, we can also consider that reliability. If you say you're going to cut someone's grass, but

[07:14] sometimes you're late or you show up a different day or you don't show up one week like that's a

[07:19] major hit. People just don't want to do what that stuff. They're not willing to. On the flip side,

[07:23] if you're the type of guy with someone's like, you know what, I could undercut your long-care guy,

[07:27] you know what, I could clean instead of your cleaning person. A lot of people like, you know what,

[07:31] I've been with Rose for 10 years and she's never missed a day. You're like, I just, I'm not willing

[07:36] to take the risk because she's already paid down so much. So but I could do for 20% less. It's like

[07:41] it's just not worth it. Right? That's real value that actually defends the business. Now what

[07:46] other types of risk mitigation can we offer? Right? One of them is reputation. Right? So this is

[07:52] where brand comes in. So the consistency reliability typically happens after someone makes a purchase.

[07:58] But how do we shift the perception of the customer that they're going to have a high likely outcome

[08:03] that they're going to get what they want? Well, one of the easiest ways is that you've gotten

[08:06] somebody else exactly what they want it and that person found out about it. Now, if they don't know

[08:10] someone directly, but then they just heard lots of whispers, that's a reputation. You've done it

[08:14] enough time for enough people that you just have a reputation for keeping your word. Right? And a lot

[08:19] of people, especially in the in the small business base, especially especially in their response base,

[08:24] all of a sudden, sometimes they're they're they're cost of a car customer goes up rapidly. And they're

[08:27] like, what's going on? What's happening? But the thing is is that the CPM's in your industry

[08:31] haven't gone up by double or triple on that same period of time. So what is it? Is that your word of

[08:36] mouth? People believe in positive word about you think negative word about doesn't exist? Negative word

[08:41] of mouth is like 10 times as viral as positive. And somehow you think that doesn't affect your

[08:45] sales. Of course, it affects your sales. People would have otherwise purchased shoes not to

[08:49] because of something they heard or read online. And so one is okay. So we've got reputation,

[08:53] we've got, and we've got consistency. So how do we do this? How do we actually operationalize this?

[08:58] Now, I've talked a lot about guarantees that talk about in the over first book. All right. And a lot of

[09:02] people took that and immediately like, oh, guarantees are the only way that we reverse risk. It's just

[09:06] one of the components. And I give that to people because I assume that a lot of people don't have a

[09:10] good reputation or don't have a reputation at all. Or they don't have enough customers to really

[09:13] develop a process to become consistent. But these two things are how you deliver long-term risk mitigation.

[09:20] In the short term, you do guarantees. Now, again, and I, which's really interesting about this is that

[09:25] everyone assumes that I was like the guarantee guy. But like a lot of us stuff that I sell has no guarantees,

[09:29] right? But the thing is that there's four different types that I cover in the book. All right.

[09:34] The first is unconditional guarantees. When you're starting out, that's a great way to do it.

[09:38] Conditional guarantees. If you do this, the end doesn't happen. Then I'll do that. I'll do why. What's my

[09:43] consideration? What am I going to put on the table? If you're going to put this money in the table.

[09:47] And a lot of times people mess this up. guarantees only work if you have stakes. So, if you don't have

[09:52] reputation, you've got to basically, it's literally like giving a payday loan. It's like, you got to

[09:56] you got to take your watch off and be like, if you give me the money, I'll put the watch down.

[10:00] Right? You can take my car if I don't pay this loan back. To say my deagent and business, you're

[10:04] starting out, you're like, here's my shirt. If I don't deliver these leads, right? I don't deliver

[10:08] a great back massage. I don't deliver a good fitness experience. You could take my shirt. There's the

[10:13] first two. There's two other types of guarantees. There's implied. And then there's anti. All right.

[10:18] So implied guarantees is one of my favorite types to use, which is just performance based.

[10:22] If you're good at what you do, winners always want to compete in our performance. Think about

[10:26] your best salespeople. They always want the most upside because they're good. And so if you're actually

[10:30] good, be willing to put it's another way of putting skin in the game for you. Right? And so just put

[10:36] skin in the game. And people are far more willing to take risk if you take some risk for them.

[10:39] So it's like, we've got this big pile of risk. How much are we going to eat down versus the customer

[10:44] eating down? Now here's the cool part. Is that you can shrink that pile of risk over time

[10:50] with reputation, which brings up the fourth guarantee, which is an anti-guarantee, which once you

[10:54] do ever mutation and you are consistent, you don't see McDonald saying we guarantee that the burger is

[10:58] going to be good. You just know it's going to be good. Right? Because you've had enough people

[11:02] not be really gone, but got to make that a good calm down. Get the point from business perspective.

[11:06] All right. So that's vector. One is speed. It's how can you do whatever we're doing faster. Number two is

[11:13] risk. How can we do it more consistently? How can we do more reliably? How can we and instead of doing

[11:18] build our reputation over time? And that consistency of reliability? How do I do that tactically?

[11:23] It's actually looking at as many variables that affect the condition of, can affect the outcome

[11:28] for the customer, as humanly possible. And then actually trying to control for all of them.

[11:32] So BF Skinner, famous behavioral psychologist said, if many variables exist, many variables must be

[11:37] studied. And so you might find out. So like for us to make videos, we have like a hundred different

[11:42] little golden beavies, little things that when put together, make a good video. And if we just do 98,

[11:47] it's just a little bit less good of a video. We do 97. It's a little bit less good of a video.

[11:51] And so we just tried every time we learn a little bit more, we added that less make.

[11:54] Another condition that we didn't realize existed that mattered. We were just talking about

[11:58] one right before I did this video. So we did this big filming session where I did a walk and talk.

[12:02] And it was hot outside. It took my shirt off. And I was doing it. It was in Florida. It was super

[12:07] humid. And that whole series of kind of like walk and talk things that I did murder. It was like

[12:13] some of my it was probably the single best recording session I've ever had in terms of performance

[12:17] of the clips in the session. So we were like, oh walk and talk worked great. So then I did

[12:22] another series of walk and talks where I'm just like in normal clothes because it wasn't. It was

[12:26] actually cold out. I think I put a jacket on. And so I put a jacket on the second one. And literally

[12:30] I think it might have been the actual worst recording session that I ever had. What we got to see

[12:34] there is that it wasn't the walk and talk that was the thing that made the shorts valuable.

[12:38] It might have been me being sureless, which I have other considerations for, which was like baby

[12:43] maybe I'll start early Alex someday. But for now, those are the first two speed and risk or risk

[12:49] if you will. Now the third one is price. It's cheap, right? So you can be faster. You can be less risky

[12:59] or you can be cheaper. Now we have a fourth one too, but let's talk about this for a second. I tend to be

[13:03] the self or more expensive guy. But you can win with any of these three factors. If people absolutely

[13:10] know that your stuff's amazing, they'll be willing to pay more for it and they'll come to you instead of

[13:14] somebody else. If you're the fastest, they absolutely will come to you over other people because you can

[13:18] deliver all these factors of speed. If you're the cheapest, people will absolutely come to you.

[13:23] Like to pretend that price doesn't matter is silly, of course price matters. But so does value.

[13:28] Because value is, sorry, the deal, rather, is the comparison between price, what you pay,

[13:37] and what you get. Right? And so something is appropriately cheap if you get tremendous value

[13:43] for low price. But the answer is not hearing this and saying, oh, I will now lower my price. That is

[13:48] certainly a terrible decision. But instead, it's day one deciding our competitive advantage. The

[13:55] mode that we're going to build around is being cheaper than everyone else. And you have to start

[13:59] that way, day one. That means every component of the business from click to close to delivered is

[14:05] organized such that you can pass on as much of that cost saving to the customer. And so for example,

[14:13] if you're like, hey, I want to start a marketing HD for small business owners. Well,

[14:17] general typically a pretty bad business. Why? Because it turns out really high. They're

[14:21] volatility reflection on you. With an exception, if you can make the services cheap enough,

[14:27] I have seen it work well. But I mean, way cheaper than you think. I'm talking $100 to $300 a month.

[14:34] For services that most people charge $2,000 a month for. When you can do that,

[14:39] now you have something that a lot of people are interested in. So that even on the worst day of

[14:42] business, they're like, I'm not going to cancel that. Like, it's only $100, only $200 and it certainly

[14:48] makes way more than that even on my worst month. And to the same degree, we, they basically,

[14:54] okay, if I want to do this, right, if you're like, okay, how do I actually build for cheapness?

[14:58] All right, so there's three ways that I think about this. So number one is you can have AI,

[15:02] right, day one. Now a lot of you guys should be already being investing this stuff. Like,

[15:05] for sure, AI is giving the best employees, 10X the levers they had before. And so if there's

[15:09] ever been the time to have to pay people better, it's been today because AI is now taking your best

[15:15] person to making it 10 times as effective. So it's like, why would you not? Like, you're always like,

[15:18] man, if I could have 10, 10, John's or 10, Daniel's or 10, 10 Michaels, man, that would be amazing.

[15:23] It's like, well, AI is giving you 10 Michaels. And so be willing to pay the Michaels of your business

[15:29] more because you actually do get more from them now or the never. So number one is AI. The

[15:34] second is I'll just say automation because I think automation for some reason has like been forgotten

[15:37] about there's still lots of stuff that you can get automated that doesn't necessarily get that AI.

[15:42] But you build day one with those automations in place. Now the third is offshoring, right? We're

[15:48] nearshoring. Basically, paying significantly less for the same labor. But you're actually making

[15:53] this your entire business strategy from day one. We're going to win by being the cheapest. And if that's

[15:59] you, then you state that first and foremost in your marketing and your sales and what's really

[16:04] cool about it is typically when you're the cheapest, the sales are pretty easy, marketing is not that

[16:09] hard. The difficulty is being profitable. But I've seen some tremendously profitable businesses

[16:14] that structure themselves from day one on being the cheapest. And a little, a little tidbit, a little

[16:20] prototype that I think a lot of business owners are going to miss out on. I think people are not

[16:23] getting this. If you do all this stuff, let's say you do the offshoring, you do the automation of the

[16:28] AI. You don't need to tell your customers. You can just have AI automation and offshoring into your

[16:33] business. And you just sell a normal service. You need to tell them you have a bunch of VAs in the

[16:37] Philippines. You need to tell them that a lot of your stuff is from AI. Don't say hey, where it AI

[16:41] design for them. Just be a design firm. And then charge the same rates or a good deal for design

[16:47] because you just have an automated backend. Great. Amazing. So that will allow you to get more

[16:52] cash with the business. It'll also be probably more about it. All right. So three vectors so far.

[16:55] Speed. How do I do it? Fastening it. Most of the market risk. How do it more reliably

[17:00] in build a reputation? Better than anyone else in the market. Cost. How do I do it? cheaper,

[17:04] consistently. And still be profitable than anyone else in the market. And finally, you have ease.

[17:07] Now before I dive into these, I want to make this point. If you just win on one of these, you can have

[17:11] an incredibly successful business. If you can do multiple vectors, then you'll crush everyone.

[17:16] Real quick, check this out. So if you aren't sure what strategic competitive advantage you should be

[17:21] doubling down on, I'd love to invite you out to one of our scaling workshops that we have here

[17:26] in Vegas that are headquarters and my team can actually work with you on it. But before you do that,

[17:30] you can download our $300 million scaling roadmap. We can plug in information and it will give you

[17:35] basically your step where you're at in the scaling process. And ultimately give you the things

[17:39] that you can help get to the next level. But like I said, if you want, help from my team, you can book

[17:43] a call after you download this. It's free. And we'd love to see if we can help you out. A quote that I like

[17:47] is the best for the most people for the least. And so best probably takes into account speed and

[17:54] ease, in risk. And for the most, it's going to be like total number of people that helps. And then

[17:59] for the least. Right? It's like, and I have different owners like unique expensive sticky air.

[18:03] How do I do something that no one else can do? How do I have it that they keep buying it?

[18:07] How do I have that I have high-grace margins? And how do I have it so it's over and over again?

[18:11] Right? So we think about these little monitors. I think about this when I'm trying to build a business

[18:14] because ultimately, these are the ways that you win. These are the strategic modes. So people talk

[18:18] about strategy, but fundamentally it's going to have to ladder up to one of these things. So if you're like,

[18:22] oh, by the way, what's acquisition.com is it's going to be this one probably primarily. And then I would say

[18:28] secondary vectors are these. We're obviously not cheapest. Right? And so that's where I've built my

[18:33] business around. Now, if I had a different, not all the business are portfolio are built that way.

[18:38] Right? We have a team-writing chain that's more around speed, ease, and cheapness. Right? And so

[18:44] you have to make sure that the strategy is best tailored to the customer after the

[18:49] trend is certain. All right, let's talk about ease. I want to make a big point about ease.

[18:53] If you want to make your product more convenient for customers, you don't make something convenient.

[18:59] Because we want to like, I want to do something to my product. It's actually the opposite,

[19:02] which is why I think was product suck. You make something easier by removing everything that is

[19:07] no longer required. You make something easy by saying, what is what is hard about this and that

[19:12] removing everything that's hard. And so what's cool about this process is all like,

[19:17] easy is not the outcome. It's removing all hard and then easy happens as a consequence.

[19:23] So like, easy is not noticeable. It's like good design. It should vanish. Right? Like, if you look

[19:29] at an iPhone, an iPhone is the result of what happens when you rev everything that sucks about

[19:34] a phone. And what remains is an iPhone. The UX vanishes into the screen. There's no menus. You're

[19:39] hit what you need. It immediately opens up. Right? This is how we have to think about

[19:43] ease. And so this happens for services. It happens for products. And just like I was saying earlier

[19:48] with if many variables exist, many variables must be studied. And the nice thing is that customers

[19:52] will tell you what's what's hard thing number one, what's hard thing number two, what's hard.

[19:56] Leader with three, what's hard thing number four, and that you have that list. And then the way that you

[20:01] make something easy is one at a time crossing things out. One at a time until eventually we were like,

[20:07] man, this thing just works. And that takes work. Take a thing, figure out what makes it hard,

[20:13] remove all this pieces, and then what you're left with is something that's easy. This is the work.

[20:17] And I wish I could say this in a hundred different ways, but like honestly, that's the game.

[20:22] And so when we're thinking about this, it's like as a custom, like you want to think again,

[20:26] click to close to delivered. So when a customer is coming into your ecosystem into your world,

[20:31] how much information do they need to get? Do they have to give information? The same

[20:34] information of multiple calls. Are we passing calls to two reps? Like, I'll give you a really simple

[20:38] example. So right now, you probably have, like, if you have a business that sells via appointments,

[20:43] where you have phone calls, you have people who may in the calls. If you have multiple calls that occur

[20:46] in order for someone to buy, let me tell you what happens all the time. Call one, tell me about your

[20:51] business. All right, tell me about the size of the business. Tell me about this in qualification.

[20:54] Bubble, okay, cool. So then let me set you up with Charlie, Charlie, get your setup. Okay, cool.

[20:59] Now, we get on the phone with Charlie three days later. Charlie's like, hey, how's it going?

[21:02] What's the revenue of the business? What's the size of the business? What's it? You're like,

[21:05] dude, I just, I just told the why am I to why am I telling? I hate you already, right? And so instead of doing

[21:11] that, let me show you the things that this is a very binary outcome. This is very binary when a lot of

[21:15] more of this, a lot of them are more continuous. But this is binary. And the only thing easier than doing a little

[21:19] about to share with you is not doing it, which is why most people don't. Your salespeople,

[21:23] your setters or your salespeople in general should take notes on the customers. And here's what's cool.

[21:29] If you start the second call and say, hey, how to conversation with Charlie, Charlie told me

[21:34] that your revenue is this, your industry is this. And the biggest issue you're doing with this,

[21:37] does that sound about right? They're going to be like, wow, they actually did some homework.

[21:42] This is a pretty buttoned up operation. You know what that just made it easier. And so we have to

[21:47] think about every single little step. That's just, that's just the sale. And if you don't think

[21:51] that how you sell affects their perception of the quality of service that you have, you're

[21:56] kidding yourself. Many people will make a judgment based on how good your product is,

[22:00] based on how good your sales motion is, how clean it and how's dialed it. If you call someone

[22:06] in 30 seconds, they're like, man, these guys are on it. They would imagine that if you make a promise

[22:10] about speed later, guess what the past experience they have that they're going to use as judgment

[22:15] is on. The sales process. And so this, again, I'm just talking about sales because everyone,

[22:20] like, you know, everybody likes talking about sales. But, um, well, I like talking about sales. Find

[22:24] caught me. Uh, on the flip side is the back end is the same thing. What's the onboarding

[22:28] call? The click? What are the activation points? What are the touch points with the customer? What kind of

[22:32] reporting are we going to provide to them so that they know that we're delivering them value? What

[22:35] things do we give? We're giving massage or we're giving a map. We show them where the pain is. And

[22:39] we show them, hey, when they come back in, this is where you said last time you were in pain. How's that?

[22:42] Oh, it's good for one to 10 a day. Wow, that was really good. Like, I mean, can you imagine

[22:46] you walk into a massage place that you've been to before? And they're like, oh, last time we start

[22:49] with your shoulder. And the reason that so many people let just go in with the same person is because

[22:53] the business staff, so if you process this, and so it's like, why might I just go with the same

[22:56] as Susan? Because she knows me. But if every masseuse or massage her, I don't know the male version,

[23:01] whatever massage her, um, already knew the pain that you were dealing with beforehand, could you

[23:07] imagine what a superior experience that would be as a company? And then also how much more would

[23:12] you go to keep customers, whereas when the masseuse leaves, they take all the customers that went

[23:15] with them, not very sticky. But if every massage person knew all the pain points of the business,

[23:20] that would make it easier. Easy is when everything that's hard vanishes and that's all that's left

[23:26] is the value. If you're looking at these four, how can I do it faster? How can I make more

[23:30] reliable? How can I do a cheaper? How can make it easier for the customer? The end state, the

[23:35] kill shot is that you have all four. Now, to have all four, it almost always has to be tacked.

[23:40] Now, you can typically have three of the four if you have labor. All right. So if you have a

[23:44] service based business, you're basically needing to pick three. But specifically, you need to make

[23:48] sure you have one. Now, why am I so hard on this one thing? Well, customers do not understand

[23:54] multiple benefits. Now, they can like, from a messaging perspective. Now, when they buy something,

[23:58] they experience it, that's different. But from a marketing angle, if you say, hey, we're the fastest,

[24:03] we're the least risky and we're the easiest. It's too much. Just focus on the core vector. And if you're

[24:09] like, which one do I pick? Pick the one that values the most to your customer. Pick to the one that

[24:14] they care about the most. And so if you know that your people care the most about speed, then

[24:18] speed speeds the angle. If there's a huge cost when something doesn't go well with the business,

[24:23] then risk is the angle, right? Or the customer, whatever. And if it's just in general a huge pain

[24:29] to do this thing, then how can I make it easy? So I'll tell you, there's a lady that I know

[24:34] in the upper Korean Mexican, that I used to go to church when I went to church. And she had a

[24:40] massive business in New Mexico. And her entire business was built on one thing. Speed and ease.

[24:47] She had a DMV business where she just privatized, getting people their IDs. That was it.

[24:53] It's all it was. And I remember her talking to me. And she was like, yeah, they just passed a new

[24:58] law that everybody in New Mexico has to get a new ID because we just changed the license. And she was like,

[25:05] well, that's, you know, 12 million people, time 50 bucks. And I just remember her saying that.

[25:11] I was like, how elegant. And the thing is, is that her $50 is like, she was able to get people

[25:17] in and out in 15 minutes from the time they walked in the door at the time they left. Could you imagine

[25:21] how lovely of an experience that would be? Everybody when they think about getting their ID right now,

[25:24] it's like, just pain. All you think is just like waste of a day, just frustration, dealing with

[25:29] enough to people who have no urgency, no regard for other people. And just generally deal with

[25:34] you as a nuisance. Like, you're somehow inconveniencing them in their day of not working. They

[25:39] you have disrupted their day of not working by existing and breathing on them. Right? Of course you

[25:44] hate them. And so she just had a business, not hard to beat. Right? When that's the standard,

[25:48] again, there are industries that are like this that are privatized that still no one tries to

[25:54] compete in. And so if you want to get into a new space or you already have a business and you're like,

[25:58] how do I actually win? I feel like I'm the same as everybody else. Pick one and dominate. And so

[26:03] if you're wondering which of these do I pick? Obviously you started the customer reverse backwards,

[26:07] but let's do the DMB example I just said, is she going to win on being cheaper than the government?

[26:12] No, I'm pretty sure it's free or it's a nominal price in order to get the new the new IDs. And so

[26:16] she's not going to win on cheap. But what could, what else could she would on? Speed, ease, in other

[26:21] ways that ease can also be like positive customer experience. Like those are things that improve

[26:25] the overall experience for the customer should get, could she double her prices? I'll pitch

[26:29] you plenty of people probably will pay $100 to not have to waste a day. Right? So she doesn't have to

[26:33] win on this. Right? So she has to pick the one that that now risk, I mean as long as you get the

[26:39] ID, I mean you have to be good enough at this, right? But she's going to work on her reputation

[26:44] by being having a reputation of being faster and easier. Right? And so if you're trying to pick one,

[26:49] you pick the one that's going to matter most of the customer. And if you are competing in a space

[26:53] that has a lot of cheap or sometimes even free competitors, just remember this. Fast beats free.

[26:59] So back in the day, there was Napster with some of you guys may have remembered. It's probably

[27:03] before actually probably half-eall's time. There's some called mindwire that happened later.

[27:07] There was Kazah. There's all these different basically shareware things where you could share files

[27:12] with one another and also really just like steel music for free. I'll just be honest. So

[27:17] when that was happening, how did a company like Spotify come in not really free and beat them?

[27:25] They won on speed and they won on risk. Because when you've downloaded a linewire,

[27:30] you knew that you were downloading all sorts of viruses to your computer. Number one. And then

[27:34] number two on Spotify, it was like, it was just you just picked the song you could immediately start

[27:37] listening to it. And so they beat an industry that was literally free by being faster.

[27:43] And remember when I went to get you polling once, this was at University of Maryland. I was visiting

[27:48] the campus. And I think it's like the number one high-scroaching trolley in the nation. This thing is

[27:53] packed. It's in the middle of the commons or whatever. And it was having to be Halloween the weekend

[27:58] that I went to visit. You can imagine. And so at Halloween for Chipotle, they did this thing where

[28:01] if you wear any kind of foil, you dress up like a braid-o, they like give you free breeders for

[28:05] that. And I didn't know. I didn't think that that was the day that I wanted to go have Chipotle.

[28:09] So I walked up and I'm like, oh, and it was, it was imagine a grocery store parking lot. So

[28:13] massive parking lot. There's just a while later. The line stretched through the entire parking lot.

[28:19] It was insane. And I just remember thinking of myself when I got there. And it was like,

[28:24] I would pay $20 to just have the breeder that I want and not have to wait in this line even if it's

[28:28] free. And that was the moment where I sensed that concept, fast beats free. So if you're not sure

[28:35] start with the customer reverse backwards, looking at the negative landscape, you can probably

[28:38] one of these four vectors or maybe more. If you guys are like, man, this is so good.

[28:44] Let me tell you a cool little secret. If this just feels true, you're like, this is so true.

[28:51] Guess why it's so true. Because these four are the value equations. So your risk is to

[28:58] perceive like an achievement. Your ease is your evidence sacrifice. Your speed is your time to

[29:04] and then your cheaper is going to be ultimately a dream outcome. Those are the elements of value.

[29:09] And so all it is that put different words around something that is the use of the core elements of

[29:12] value. And because of the core elements of value, those are the things you have to translate to your

[29:17] customer in your marketing as you're one defining, winning, angle. And if you have to pick a book,

[29:22] you can go grab it. It's free on my podcast and it's on Amazon and you can probably find it where you

[29:27] search it. Hey, if you like this video, you might like this video because it's similar to this one,

[29:32] except even more awesome.

[00:00] Most of the nation, I wanted to give you an inside look at one of our internal company trainings

[00:04] where we talked about personal finance. And so I was asked by a lot of people on my company

[00:09] to do a training on this for them internally. And we got a lot of good feedback from it.

[00:15] And so I thought I would share it with you guys. I got the sign off for my team.

[00:19] And this is going to basically explain to you how you can be in the top 1% without having extraordinary

[00:25] means of income. And if you do have extraordinary income, then you should definitely be there.

[00:30] Without making stupid decisions. All right. And so in the video, I'm going to be covering

[00:34] different things for savings, different things for investing, different ways of structure things,

[00:38] and all that kind of awesome stuff. So if you guys don't know how I am, my name is Oxermosi,

[00:42] we own acquisition.com to $85 million per year portfolio. There's a lot of people out there and

[00:46] I don't want to be one of them. Welcome to Mose Nation. I'll see you guys in the vid.

[00:51] Quick word from our sponsors. If we could get going, there's this lovely book. This is the

[00:57] the actual manuscript of $100,000 offers. Things to most guys on this call. It's the number one

[01:04] new release and advertising. So thank you. When you get to the about halfway point of the book,

[01:10] there's one page that reminds you to leave a review. And if you could do that, it would be very helpful

[01:14] because the more people read the book, the more businesses find out about us, the more businesses find out about us,

[01:18] more sales were made, the more sales were made. The more secure everyone is and the more jobs we can

[01:24] have, the more clients we can help through our businesses by extension. And so the more we can

[01:30] engage the world. So your book review may indeed change the world. And so that is how meaningful it is.

[01:35] So please go ahead and and and and grow the book. It is 99 cents. If if it's too steep for you,

[01:45] then don't get the book. So that further ado, today what I want to talk about is personal finance.

[01:51] And rather, new a slide presentation sometimes, when it makes it up, I have a bunch of bullets.

[01:58] And I think it went really well with the gym work. So I wanted to kind of do the same thing.

[02:03] And Leland, I talked about who's going to talk about what? Because we both are involved in our finances.

[02:08] That's not always the way. You know, a lot of marriages, you know, one-person-managed money, one-person,

[02:12] those other things. But as a as resident cheap skate of our marriage, it made sense to have a

[02:18] personal finance fall to me. And so I will kick this off, kick this puppy off with some stats in a quote.

[02:26] So quote number one, the first $100,000 is a bitch. But you got to do it. I don't care what you have

[02:32] to do if it means walking everywhere, not eating anything that wasn't purchased for the coupon,

[02:36] find a way to get your hands on $100,000. After that, you can ease off the gas a little.

[02:41] Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman, Berkshire Hathlete. So many guys may know this, but Charlie Munger is my

[02:47] probably my number one resource for all things wisdom and money. And I actually think he might

[02:52] even be a better teacher than Warren Buffett. I think Warren Buffett just picked a couple of stocks

[02:55] that ended up outperforming. Charlie Munger is not having any massive home runs. He's just been

[03:00] a consistent investor for a one-kid of time. And a general salt to the earth individual who is full of

[03:06] wisdom. And so if you are looking for wisdom when it comes to money, I would recommend anything

[03:11] that is written by him or any talks that he gives. What I want to transition to is the reason behind

[03:16] this kind of leadership meeting. A lot of times we talk about management and leadership in general

[03:23] and character traits and things like that. My goal in general as my life as progress is to make

[03:27] as many people wealthy and independent as humanly possible. And so each of the businesses that we have

[03:32] have done that and there's different people who become, you know, wealthy. You know, through gym

[03:36] lords, it's obviously our clients. But I think as I've gotten older, my care is actually shifted

[03:41] towards you guys are employees of the company and making sure that everyone here comes

[03:47] independently wealthy. And so what I want to do is lay out a plan that literally everyone in this

[03:51] call can become independently wealthy if you follow it. Is that cool with everyone? Is that all right?

[03:56] Do I have alex? Yes, absolutely. If I got a belief breaker, which is just like everyone

[04:02] in any position in a company, right? Everyone has their compensation levels that their

[04:05] compensate that. I think something that is really interesting is that what I've noticed over the

[04:10] years is that it's often not correlated with how much money you make. That's correlated with

[04:14] everything else is going to talk about, which is how much money you don't spend. And so I've had

[04:18] personal conversations with a lot of you who, you know, maybe you're in the middle tier and turn

[04:22] compensation, you have more saved and more in your bank account and less debt than those who make

[04:26] more money in the company. And so I just want to put that out there is that it's often, you know,

[04:30] getting rid of the downside rather than increasing the upside. Another quote for you, you cannot

[04:35] work money. And so ideally, you would like money working for you. A horrifying staff is that the

[04:40] average American had negative net worth. Literally, if they were born, if you're born a baby

[04:46] and you have zero net worth, you're already in the top, you're already above average because

[04:51] it's zero. Think about fucking wild that is. That's insane. And that is because people make

[04:56] poor choices, not because of anything else. And so I want to be very clear about my view on this

[05:03] and it's one of Victor rather than victimhood. We all make choices and independent of what we make,

[05:09] wealth is a ratio of what we spend versus what we earn. Therefore, if you earn anything,

[05:16] you can become wealthy by controlling what you spend. So that's stat number one. Stat number two,

[05:21] the average US minimum wage worker will accrue over a million dollars in earnings over their career

[05:26] if they lived and worked minimum wage the entire time and never got a pay raise, which barely

[05:30] even makes sense because with every, you know, every four years minimum wage goes up anyways.

[05:35] Right? So they're about that for a moment. That means a million dollars is going to flow through

[05:40] the hands of basically any worker who works full time throughout their career in the US.

[05:45] All right? Next one, the median US income earner will make over $3 million. They will earn

[05:53] that over their lifespan pretty wild. Right? What if we controlled the flow and we actually made

[05:59] good decisions about that? Lots of cool things and I will show you that in a moment.

[06:03] And I want to reiterate one more point and if you want to dot it underline it, highlight it,

[06:08] wealth is a ratio, not a number between what you earn and what you spend. Right now, there is

[06:14] something that is in your life. If you do not have the amount of money you wish or you're not

[06:18] saving or investing at the amount that you want that is eating away at it. It is your number one

[06:23] nemesis. For some people, it's sneakers. For some people, it's eating out. For other people,

[06:30] it's clothing. And so the question that I have for you guys is first off, in the chat, if you

[06:35] guys will be open and honest with me, what is your voice? What is the thing that eats into your

[06:41] accounts? What is that thing that you love spending on any fuel guilty? But you get that dopamine

[06:45] rushary time you buy it? What is that? Please put in the chat. The more honest we can be,

[06:50] the better it will be for high heels. Me too. I'm with you on that one run. Skincare, eating out,

[06:55] kids stuff, food, food and beer. Okay cool. Fantastic. This is good. Next thing. I got to be

[07:02] spent a lot of money on any coffee. Alcohol, a lot of people drinking going to the bars, going to the

[07:09] club. Right? There's a lot of things. And so the next question is, and this is kind of why this

[07:16] is a behavior question because becoming independently wealthy is not complex. It's simple, not easy.

[07:25] And so my question for everyone on this call is, are you willing to give up your voice

[07:31] to be a millionaire? To genuine question. I'll tell you a brief story. And then I'll get into some

[07:37] of the more tactical stuff. And I want to make an example because there are some limiting beliefs

[07:41] around this that I think need to bond. Well, is a crude through character traits. When I,

[07:47] a lot of you guys may have heard of the story of when I was sleeping on my gym floor. Does anyone

[07:50] heard that story? I got sleeping on the floor. Didn't have enough money. Right? What you don't know

[07:55] is that I was making $5,000, my second month in business in profit. The third month, I made $10,000.

[08:03] The fourth month, I made $3,000, I made $15,000. The next time I made $20, the next time I made $25,

[08:09] the next time I made $30, the next time I made $35,000. And that was in profit.

[08:14] And I was sleeping on the floor. And that was because for me, I get tremendous amount of anxiety

[08:20] if I spend any amount of the income that I earned that is negligible. And so I wanted to take as

[08:26] much of that money that was coming in and adding it to my bank account. And so for me, and for

[08:31] everyone here, if you can gamify that one simple number, which is what is in your bank account,

[08:37] you will win the game. And so many of you are not in complete control of your finance because you

[08:43] also have a spouse. And so we will distribute this to you guys. So if you want to play this with your

[08:48] spouse, because maybe by the end of this call, you decide to make some decisions, like to get

[08:51] them bought in as well. Because you have to do it together, right? Not one of you can do this. You

[08:55] both have to do this together if you are married. But if you do commit to this and you can play a

[09:00] game, which is the game is how little can we spend and see if you can beat your last month's total.

[09:06] Every month, see what else you can trim, see else you can not spend money on. Because it becomes fun

[09:12] and interesting. And as soon as you can make not spending money fun, I promise you, you will have

[09:16] more money than you ever need, you will be able to eliminate the stress in your life around money.

[09:20] And I mean this so sincerely from the bottom of my heart. Everyone here in this company can

[09:24] become independently wealthy, can become the top one in America, simply by the habits that you choose

[09:29] to make today. Like I can, I'm serious as cancer right now. And I wish I could tell better

[09:33] stories that I knew how to break the blues and we can do this. And I'll try to address them at

[09:37] the end because some of you will have limiting beliefs around this. But if you make the steps that I'll

[09:41] walk through the day, they will they will better you. And there's only six steps that I'll walk through.

[09:46] They're very simple and they're very straightforward. Okay. Now next, next little stop at our adventure.

[09:52] Okay. Is let's show you the eighth wonder of the world. Does anyone know what the eighth wonder of the

[09:57] world is? So let's say, Marcus, how old are you? You can unmute if you want to just tell me.

[10:02] He's not.

[10:03] He's not.

[10:04] Fantastic.

[10:06] Want to see some crazy shit, Marcus? Because I'm about to tell you. Let's say you have zero

[10:10] dollars saved up. Okay. I don't know what you guys saved up. But let's say you've got zero

[10:15] dollars saved up. Are you curious by any chance? How much if you saved a hundred dollars a

[10:19] month you would have by the end? This is not the actual amount. Are you curious? Do you want to know

[10:22] how much you'd have if you saved up a hundred dollars a month? And you just put it in the S&P

[10:27] between now and when you're 75. Yes. You're curious? Do you want to see?

[10:32] Very. $2.7 million dollars. Pretty fucking interesting, right? Yes. Very.

[10:40] So check this out. Let's make this zero. This is something that I have saved on my phone. This

[10:45] calculator. I have saved on my phone. And so right now, let's say that you're looking at making

[10:51] a Jordan's purchase. You see the new Jordan's and you're like man. Them shits are sexy. So

[10:56] you take your hundred dollars and you think, well, I could either have these Jordan's or

[11:02] when I retire, I could have twenty two thousand dollars. Which would you prefer?

[11:09] It's twenty two grand. I agree with you. I would as well. I made similar decisions throughout my life.

[11:15] Now if you looked at going out to dinner for example or going out to lunch and maybe just going

[11:19] out to lunch three days away. Right? It's an extra let's say 12 bucks a day. Right? Three times a week.

[11:25] So it's 36 bucks times force. You're looking at like 130, 140 bucks just not eating out.

[11:32] Thirty one thousand dollars. Damn. And that's just one month. Now if you did that for a year,

[11:42] you'd have four hundred thousand dollars. Wow. I agree with you. But no one does the fucking

[11:49] man. That's crazy. I've never thought about that way. That is the purpose of this call.

[11:56] Thank you, Markos. Yeah. Thank you. You bet. And so one of the number one things that happens

[12:02] in one of the limiting beliefs that people have is that the amount that I can save right now is not enough.

[12:06] It's not enough to make a dent. It's not enough to do damage. Now some of you on this call might not be

[12:10] 19 years old and they have you know 60 years of compound behind you. Right? So let's look at let's look at

[12:16] what probably the median age in this company is, which is 35 years old. Okay? And so let's be a little bit

[12:21] more aggressive here. Let's say again you start at zero, but you decide to start saving $500 a month.

[12:27] I know. That's aggressive. But let's just say if you did, you'd be able to retire with $3 million.

[12:32] It's a hundred bucks a week. The thing is is that just about everyone here, if you make different

[12:36] choices about how you live, what you spend your money on, you would be able to have this outcome.

[12:41] And I mean, genuinely from like the bottom of my heart, it's just like fitness, right? You have to

[12:45] burn more than you eat this is simple, eat less than you burn or yes exactly. Thank you.

[12:52] saving money in personal finance is simple, except the thing with weight loss is you don't have

[12:55] any compounding thing that's working with money, your money works for you, right? Well you sleep.

[13:00] And so that's the magic of this. And here's what's cool, Marcus. I will show you something interesting.

[13:06] And I'm going to be like, how is that even possible? How can I say $500 a month?

[13:09] From now, being 35 to 75? Well, you're only contributed $240,000 a year. I mean, that's a lot.

[13:17] But this is how much your money worked for you. Which is why you can't not work money.

[13:25] You have to let money work for you. And so the number one thing that will create, well, for

[13:28] everybody here is your income. That's the thing that will create that. That is the flow.

[13:32] Right? Now, sleep throughout the company, you can look at different opportunities to make

[13:36] more money to get promoted to add more value to the company and things like that. So you can increase

[13:40] your inflow. But for just about it, when here, and what's kind of funny is that I have had many

[13:45] conversations with people. And I want to be really transparent here. There are people who make the

[13:50] most in this company are among most, I would say, the top 10% earners in this company, who I have

[13:55] had conversations with, who have zero dollar saved up. I've also had conversations with people

[14:00] with the top 10% earners company, who are negative network. I've also had conversations with people

[14:04] who are in the bottom 20% in this company. And I have higher net worth than the top 10%

[14:11] and so to me, that shows that it's choice. It's just a choice. And what I could tell you,

[14:16] as somebody who's made this phenomenal money throughout my life, my level of well-being

[14:20] has been no way affected by anything that I've spent money with. But here are good to do not

[14:24] increase my concept of subjective well-being. And so if you're goal is to seek to decrease the

[14:31] anxiety that you have in your life because of finances, then the easiest way to do that is to

[14:35] spend less money because you have low risk. Consider your fixed expenses and your lifestyle,

[14:41] your risk basis. This is your risk that you have as an individual. And so if you can make your

[14:46] soften investment that has very low risk and very high return, you will reap the benefits

[14:50] over a long period of time. And so this, again, is assuming you say $500 a month. That's it.

[14:58] Now, let's just get wild. And let's say you go all in on this. You just go nuts. And I'm going to

[15:02] give you some of the habits and all that kind of stuff in a second. But I just want to paint the picture

[15:06] first. So let's say you did the same exact thing, but you were like, you know what? I'm totally changing

[15:11] my lifestyle. I'm downgrading where I live. I'm selling the least on my car and I'm buying a car

[15:16] in $5,000 in cash. So I have no payments. Let's see where this takes us.

[15:20] $2,500 a month. It's $14 million. Just in case you're curious, that's not the top 1%

[15:31] that's the top 0.4% of the United States. And you just get there through making smart choices.

[15:38] And this again is assuming you have $0 saved up. So this is for you, Markos. Let's say you

[15:43] save $25,000 by the end of this year because you do a great job and you live like a Chee best.

[15:48] And you put no more money into the rest of the money. And you start because you're 19 years old.

[15:56] That's how much money you can have. $5,000 if you just save $25,000 today and put it in the

[16:04] S&P and never think about it. Markos, you could be a hood rich. Right. And so one of the things,

[16:12] does anyone here know with the number one drain on net worth this? Besides taxes, 35% of every

[16:19] single Americans paycheck goes to this one thing. Yes, Laura LaRose. Interest, 35%.

[16:28] So for context, imagine, imagine where you had a franchise. Right. And so I'm the franchise

[16:36] pro subway. I have, I license out my business mall to 10,000 restaurants.

[16:41] Subway gets 10% and they kill their franchisees because there's no margin in food.

[16:48] Do you know who's killing them three and a half times more? The banks.

[16:53] 35% of the average American paycheck goes to interest. That's it. And so right now, what I just showed you

[17:03] was $500 a month. So can everybody here just for just for shits and giggles, multiply what you take home

[17:11] by 0.35. Put that in that calculator. I'll wait for you guys to do it. Multiply what you make by 0.35

[17:18] and put that in as your monthly contribution. You can start with $0.75 as your retirement age.

[17:23] The reason to do that is because we're all going to live a lot longer than our ancestors do.

[17:28] So why you guys are doing that and getting that calculation? And the reason I'm asking you to do this

[17:35] is because I want you, I want to show you that it's worth it to make these decisions.

[17:41] And so the reason 35% is that for example, let's say you buy a house. Right? You've

[17:48] lived, you've realized in the American dream, which is hilarious because you didn't actually buy a house.

[17:53] You got along because the banks had zillions of dollars of advertising to make you

[17:57] to fool you into believing that in the American dream is that you owe them money. That's the

[18:00] American dream is that you owe someone else money and that 35% of your paycheck goes to them for the rest

[18:05] of your fucking life. It could also get into student debt, which I have for the heat to like every

[18:09] ounce of my being, but I want to even get into that. So let's just talk more about it.

[18:13] If you do buy house and you're the average American and you move in three years, which is what

[18:18] the average American does, they move at three years. Do you have any idea? What percentage

[18:21] all those mortgage payments that you're making are going for? It's principal, which means the actual

[18:25] amount of the house. Dominic, correct? Do you have a 30 year mortgage? You're first three years.

[18:30] You're paying jacks shit towards your principal, which means you just leased it from the bank.

[18:35] And then they get somebody else in and then they, and they, and 97% of the dollars that go in there,

[18:40] go to them and the bank holds the note on everything. To the same degree, if you buy a car

[18:45] and you can't buy it in cash, the same interest applies, except it's even higher. Isn't that wild?

[18:50] Isn't that nuts? What's more? Is that for those of you who have student loans?

[18:56] Think of how crazy this is. They lobbied to get the government to back student loans, which means

[19:04] they gave 18 year olds. So everybody who's on the sales team understands this. But if we try and

[19:09] give a business owner, get a business refinanced in real terms of the likelihood that they pay back

[19:14] to debt for even $15,000, right? The approval rates like one out of three for 15 grand.

[19:24] And yet because the government allows this, they allow banks to give a loan for $200,000,

[19:31] to an 18 year old with zero fucking earning potential. And they say that they can never get out of it,

[19:37] which means that that percentage of your paycheck, would they did just like that subway that

[19:41] roads you off the top? They're getting a royalty on your fucking life. 35% of everything you make

[19:48] forever. And they allow people who aren't even old enough to drink, put themselves in enough

[19:56] debt they can never get out of. Now, I believe in personal accountability. You should be responsible

[20:00] for your decisions. But I don't think it should be subsidized back by the government. The purpose of

[20:04] today is hopefully to shock you a little bit into how much many people on this call are being robbed

[20:09] by decisions and the invisible hand that is taking money from your pocket every single month. And so

[20:14] if you guys will want me, I would like to walk you through six steps to get out of this mess.

[20:19] Is that okay with you guys? So you saw the sunny side, which Marko's got to see,

[20:23] you can be worth $6 million if you just say $25 grand this year and doesn't do anything else.

[20:26] On the flip side, for everyone else, right? Not just Marko's. Hopefully Marko's. You don't have

[20:30] a mortgage and student loans and all the other things, right? Hopefully. For everyone else,

[20:35] you can see what has been robbing you and your ability to create generational wealth is this one

[20:40] thing. And so my goal is to get us to get this monkey off our backs. And so one more, one more

[20:48] step that I will, that I'll push towards you is that does anyone here, anyone willing to be honest,

[20:53] that is anyone here have credit card debt? Does anyone have credit card debt? Okay. So who here

[20:57] has hurt, you know, like compounding is the eighth one of the world, which is what Marko's

[21:01] as eyes popped out of his head when he sold it on, right? eighth one of the world is compounding.

[21:06] You can also have negative compounding interest, which compounds against you. And so you have

[21:12] the eighth one of the world beating you up every single day rather than lifting you up so that you can

[21:18] become financially free. That is the eighth one of the world working against you because it's compounding

[21:23] and for many of you, you know, credit card debt, 10, 12, 16% per year. If you could get a an investment

[21:29] that 16% a year, you'd be fucking stoked. And that's what exactly what every single bank did in the

[21:35] world is they make you the investment that they get 16% compounding in. We call, I was

[21:40] like, well, I've ever once completed attention, what I want to hit on are the six, the six pieces

[21:45] here. All right. Number one is that you have to start saving money. And you do that before we

[21:54] start paying debt off. All right. They're like, how much do I say? What you save is something

[21:59] called an emergency fund. And the reason you start there rather than paying off your debt is because

[22:03] something will come up. And if you learn the habit, stopping to pay off your debt, you'll stop

[22:09] paying it off. It's like going on vacation. And so think of this as the vacation fund for your financial

[22:14] fitness, is that we need to plan for the vacation that's going to come so that we don't get off-base.

[22:19] For most people, that emergency fund is between 1,000 and 5,000 dollars. I will let you decide on

[22:26] on what that is based on your income. But what that is is when your carburetor and your car goes

[22:30] up or when you break your foot and you have it under this. It's the stuff that is, quote, unexpected,

[22:35] but 100% predictable that it's going to happen at some point in your life. And so the idea is,

[22:39] plan for the thing that you know will happen, you just don't know when. The only variable is when,

[22:44] not yes. And so has anyone here, I'll ask this question to further the point, can I just get hands,

[22:49] you can see it on the screen? Has anyone here in your life had it unexpected build come up?

[22:54] So then can we call them unexpected? Let's call them expected builds and just plan ahead.

[22:59] All right. So the first thing that we do, so if you're writing this down, the first thing you do

[23:03] is you save between one and five thousand dollars. I will let you make that decision you are grown

[23:08] up. That means that even if you have your credit card debt, even if you have other things that are

[23:12] stupid, that's fine for right now. The first step is to save one to five thousand dollars.

[23:18] Step one. Step two, you path all your debt. Mine is your mortgage. So if you have a mortgage,

[23:24] don't worry about the mortgage for now. We'll get to that in a second. Except for the mortgage,

[23:28] you pay off all your debt. And it is my two cents that it's better to pay off the smallest debts you've got.

[23:35] Even if you've got one that's let's say 20% and you've got another one that's 10% and the 10%

[23:39] one is smaller. Despite it mathematically making more sense to pay off the higher debt one,

[23:45] no one here has made any fucking national decisions up to this point. So why would we make them now?

[23:50] The point is that we need to get the emotional victory. We need to lose some weight. We need to

[23:55] tighten our belt. All right. And you need the first win so that you can see that you can do this.

[24:00] And so you pay off the smallest debt first and then you pay off the second smallest debt. And then

[24:04] you'll feel is momentum and you'll see that you can do it. And so what my earnest ask is that if you

[24:09] can team up with your spouse on this and you show them how much money could be making with just

[24:14] what you're paying in debt right now, 35% of your paycheck and how it can be create independent wealth

[24:20] for you and your family for the long run. Just by doing this then hopefully it will make it worth it

[24:26] more than getting a dessert at chills. Although I do love desserts at chiles. I think they're fantastic.

[24:31] Do it when you can afford it and you can pay for it in cash and still hit your bunch. To show

[24:35] you to the extent how much layland I believe in this, we bought our home in cash.

[24:39] But our cars in cash. Everything we pay for in cash. We have zero debt. Total zero.

[24:45] And what I can tell you is it feels good knowing that no one can take your shit away from you.

[24:49] Because for those of you who like to be more sophisticated and read up on articles on crypto and

[24:53] Robin Hood, let me tell you an interesting concept that I learned from somebody who's much

[24:57] wealthy the main. They said debt increased risk. Risk have expanded over a long enough time

[25:06] Well, either way the returns that the additional leverage gain. Because anything, any number,

[25:12] no matter how big multiplied by zero, it's still zero. So it doesn't matter how good you are

[25:17] and how much you saved if you take on too much risk, which is what debt is.

[25:23] Over a long enough time horizon, it will multiply you by zero. Which some of us are old enough

[25:27] mark us or not, but some of us are old enough to remember the 2008 2009 collapse. I will tell you

[25:33] that just about every entrepreneur friend that I know lost everything. They had to start back at zero.

[25:38] And mark us. You saw that you were at 19. And if you didn't fuck up, if you don't fuck up between

[25:43] now and when you're 75, which means you don't take on debt and you just need to pay for things in cash

[25:47] and you budget how much you make. And you spend less than what you earn. You'll be able to be

[25:52] financially wealthy for their actual life. You'll also never have to worry about money. However,

[25:56] and the only reason people don't do this is because they think that status and how good they feel

[26:00] about themselves live in the eyes of others rather than their own eyes. Would you rather be rich

[26:06] or have everyone think your rich? It's a real question. And most people answer by their actions,

[26:10] which when they'd rather actually want. Which is why finance and personal finances is much

[26:14] more a question of character than it is about intelligence. Is anything here complex that I've shown you?

[26:20] Earth, Earth, Earth medically. Say more than you earn.

[26:25] Right? Spend less than you earn. Do it for a long period of time. Don't buy shit. You can't afford

[26:31] and don't want money to do it. I told you step one. Save $1 to $5,000. Step two. Pay off your debts

[26:37] smallest to largest. Not in terms of interest. Do it in terms of smallest to largest. For many of

[26:43] you, that may take one year, two years or three years. And I know that this is the, that's the

[26:49] rocky cutscene. That's the part of the movie that everyone's fast forward through. But I can tell

[26:55] you that the amount of spiritual growth that happens when you consistently live disciplined will change

[27:01] who you are and how it's controlled you perceive that you have over your life. And you may

[27:06] lament the fact that you have to do it in loans. You may lament the fact that you got into a 30

[27:09] year mortgage. We'll talk about it in a second. But those things are done. There's nothing you can do

[27:13] about this. All we can do is the choices that we have in front of us. And so the question is,

[27:16] are we going to let the decision that we made? Here's a go. Rob us of the future that we can have

[27:21] if we choose to have. One, save $1 to $5. Two. Pay off all debt that is not your mortgage in terms

[27:30] of smallest to largest. You paid off. Just you know as soon as Layla and I started making money,

[27:34] we paid off first student debt. Right? Like we live by this. This is I believe this false

[27:40] bones thrown through. Third step in your piece of in your financial freedom is actually

[27:48] expanding your emergency fund. Close savings. If you don't invest those, those are just so that

[27:54] you can live as human being and feel safe. Some of you will have larger need for security. Other

[28:01] of you will have smaller needs for security. And so the range for this is three to six months

[28:06] of living expenses. Now the fact that you've done this after you paid off your debt aggressively,

[28:12] you will already have the character traits in the discipline to know how to live on less.

[28:17] Which means you're very able to one, you won't even have to save that much because you already

[28:22] have been living on so little. So three months might not even take it out. And you would be amazed

[28:27] and how much more money you have when you have no debt that goes out every single month

[28:31] paying the banks. You will be blown away. So right now for shits and giggles because that's why

[28:36] we did this right? Shits and giggles. Nothing here serious is canceled, right? Except for you know,

[28:41] your future and everything else. Shits and who here has a car payment? Think of a hand?

[28:46] Give a car payment? Okay. Who here leases where they live or has a mortgage? Now if you were to add

[28:53] that amount of money out, remember that calculator? I want you to put that in the calculator again.

[28:59] I know. I'm asking you to do some work. I think it's worth it.

[29:02] Can someone throw some numbers of what that would equate to? $2.1 million. There it is. Just so you know,

[29:07] known can guess what your car payment and your house payments are based on this number. So don't worry about.

[29:11] $6 million dollars. $3.2 million dollars. $5.6 million dollars. $3.8 million dollars. So

[29:16] $2 million dollars. $15 million dollars. $1.5 million dollars. $2.8 million dollars. How fucking nuts is this?

[29:23] This is the shit they don't tell you. This is how everyone at the top makes all the money.

[29:28] They loan people who can't afford things. Things they can't afford and they solve them with that.

[29:32] That's compounding against them for the rest of their lives. That's the secret.

[29:35] So if you don't want that working against you, these are the hard decisions. Right now,

[29:40] if you can have the hard conversation with your spouse and think to yourself,

[29:44] is there a way? Because now at this point in this process, you can try and pay off where you live

[29:52] so that that money that you currently outflowing becomes your retirement fund. You can literally

[29:56] do nothing else. You could just do that and and own the car you have in cash. And just so you know,

[30:03] as somebody who's had super cars and had a Prius that was worth $5,000, it gets me from point

[30:08] 8 to point B in the exact same amount of time. There's also the biggest regret of my life as buying the

[30:12] Bentley that we have. Number one financial regret I have. I get zero enjoyment out. I miss our

[30:17] little broken Prius that had dint a dent on the side door and had a crack through the windshield.

[30:22] And for context, just you guys know that I'm drinking my own cool it. When we owned that car,

[30:27] as the only car that Leyla and I split, we were millionaires. And I had a lady who was in our

[30:32] mastermind, a Monica Pitar, who saw us pull up to our mastermind in the Prius with a crack

[30:36] windshield and the dent in the door. And she said, I thought you guys were supposed to be rich.

[30:41] As you walk into the mastermind, which you, as of course, a guru or horrified by this

[30:45] idea. And I said, I am, I said, you should look at my back. And so that's the kind of thing that

[30:50] just like, it just gives you what kind of confidence do you want? Do you want someone to say

[30:53] nice car or do you want to be a, let's say, you should look at my back. There's a kind of stress fee

[30:57] living and there's a kind of confidence that comes from this. There's a kind of, fuck you money,

[31:02] energy that's hard to fake. And I would like that for everybody here on this call and it is a

[31:06] hundred percent attainable for everyone here. Just making the right choices. So the number one,

[31:11] the easiest thing you can do is if you have a lease, you can turn it in early and you can buy a

[31:15] car for $5,000 cash. You could save up for it. Okay. But once you do that,

[31:19] remember that hundred dollars a month, that $200 a month, that's some of you guys are paying.

[31:23] As soon as you save up, you need that one time, that $2 a month becomes a constant flow that for

[31:28] the rest of your life is adding towards your network. And then you can choose to downgrade and not

[31:34] live in the really rich, you fancy neighborhood that you live in now. That might be above your means

[31:37] or rather, is above your means because you can't buy the house cash and you're just loading it from the

[31:40] bank, right? And this is stuff that no one says it. Everyone wants to, you know, impress their parents

[31:47] to show them what the neighborhood they live in, rather than impressing themselves and giving themselves

[31:50] a stress for your life. Again, for context, when I did decide to lease my first spot where I decided

[31:56] to live, you guys are curious, I split a bedroom in a house, I split one bedroom with one another guy.

[32:04] I paid $400 a month in rent and this is in Southern California. For anyone who has context,

[32:09] $400 a month in rent gets you nothing. I split a bedroom in a house. And again, I was making

[32:17] $20,000 a month. And I'm not saying this because I believe in this so thoroughly and very

[32:24] luckily on my part, I was raised by a father who came to the United States with nothing.

[32:29] He was an immigrant, he had $1000 that he was able to take with it. And so we split the paper towels

[32:33] in half, right? Because we didn't want to, you know, waste them. We never used napkins because those

[32:38] were expenses used towels that didn't stable, right? You saved everything. We always would get like

[32:43] two milks at Costco, which were like big ass gallon ones. And it was just pay, how's the only kid?

[32:47] And he's like, drink up. It's going to go bad. Because you didn't want to buy the milk at

[32:50] royal farms or seven eleven, whatever you guys have. It was like a dollar more, right? And that's why

[32:55] if you guys can gamify this with your spouse, you'll win the game. Because if you can play the game,

[33:00] you'll win. But most people just don't realize that you are in the game right now and other people are

[33:05] playing you. So, I gave you the first habits. One to five thousand of emergency and you do that

[33:11] before you pay debt because something's going to come up and you don't want to break the cycle of

[33:14] paying off your debt. So you did that first. Then you start paying off your debts from smallest to biggest.

[33:19] So you can get the emotional victories and you start winning. Number three, then you save up

[33:24] three to six months of living expenses so that you can feel financially secure. So you don't have to

[33:28] three. This will lower your stress and it will make your life much better. The point that most people

[33:32] have of becoming wealthy is because they want to become happier. The easiest way to become happier is

[33:36] become less stressed. You've been to do that. It's safe to fucking run. Fourth step. This is where

[33:41] you look at how you can start building wealth. So we'll do that. If you have a mortgage and you don't

[33:46] want to live somewhere else, renegotiate the mortgage, you can refinance right now. Because

[33:52] right now interest rates are nothing and try and get a 15 year fixed that will make your mortgage go up.

[33:57] But the vast majority of the money will be going towards something that you own. So your principle

[34:01] will start you will be increasing your net worth. Fun fact, you don't pay capital gains on selling the

[34:07] house that you own. So if you're primary home, increases in value and you live in it for over two

[34:12] years and then you sell it and decide to go upgrade because it's gone up and you can buy a 100% of

[34:17] your new house with the cash that you have saved up. You don't pay taxes. There are some things

[34:21] the government has done to help. Well, that is one of them. So if you insist on on living somewhere

[34:27] that is beyond what you can currently pay in cash, then refine is to get a 15 year fixed. And then

[34:31] when it comes to cars, if you can combine because most of you guys work from home, most of you,

[34:35] everyone here works from home, you probably only need one car and if you're like no way, it's like

[34:40] laying on a living with one car. You still live with one car. Actually, you shouldn't know we have to.

[34:43] But like we live with one car for a very, very, very, very long time. Right? And I'm about to return

[34:46] because I don't need to. So if you can buy a car in cash which there are tons of good cars in cash

[34:50] and here's what's crazy. Cars in cash that you buy and you use for three years, $1,000, you can

[34:55] sell for $5,000 in cash. You just use it for free. Pretty well. All right. Everyone ready for five.

[35:02] So five. All right. So five is that five is where you invest 15% of your pre-tax pre-tax income

[35:12] into the S&P 500. Again, I'm not an investment professional. I do not recommend that you

[35:18] listen to me in any way. You should consult your own professional advisors for any investment advice.

[35:23] And this is not a recommendation at all because I don't know what I'm doing. And so you can make

[35:29] your own decisions as an adult to choose to do with your money which you want to do. If you look

[35:32] at the last 80 years of the S&P 500, it's gone up by about 9 to 10% per year for that entire period

[35:39] of time. Now, if you guys haven't heard my talk on volatility and risk, it's good to understand this.

[35:45] The reason we built up the emergency fund of three to six months of living expenses is so that

[35:49] you never look at that money and that you never stop putting money into it. And I'll tell you one story

[35:54] that you guys know half the story about. And for those of you who are about to read the book,

[35:57] you're going to read the first half of that story, which is that I went almost to bankrupt and I

[36:01] had $1,000, that's my bank account right before I started Jamalach. What you guys don't know

[36:05] is that I had just under $300,000 saved up that was in an index. But to me, and you can tell by the

[36:12] way that that story was wrote, that money does not exist. Once it is gone, it is gone. You never see

[36:18] it again. You never touch it. Don't look at it. And if you need to make money, you find a way to make

[36:24] yourself something. You work an extra shift. You take up Uber on the weekends. Whatever. The point is

[36:29] you don't touch it. Because if you can earn that character trade, you can learn not to put

[36:34] your hand in the cookie jar. You see the money that Marcos can have if he just puts $10,000, $25,000, $25,000

[36:41] Marcos, see someone really crazy? Let's say save 25 grand this year. And let's say because you're like

[36:46] Alex, I'm all in on becoming independently wealthy. Let's say save 2500 bucks a month. All right,

[36:50] because you hustle your ass off selling. Here's what's fucking crazy. That money that 74 million

[37:01] is being made. It's just the question is whether you're going to be the one who makes it or the bank.

[37:07] That money is being made either way. Think about that. Money is being made all day,

[37:12] everyday, all the time. The dollars always work at the same degree for whoever their master is.

[37:18] The question is whether you're the master of the dollar or the person you're paying. And if

[37:22] yes, you're curious about like what the tactics around this are, all you do is you download Robin

[37:26] who's at the app, which is free, connect your bank account. And you can deposit straight into an index

[37:30] off there. It's very straightforward. You don't need an advisor. They're just going to charge fees,

[37:34] which are actually going to kill your returns. So don't worry about it. As soon as you pay 500,

[37:38] again, this is not investment advice. Do whatever you want with your money. In fact, I might not

[37:43] know anything. So I definitely, I would say don't listen to my advice. All right. This makes sense for

[37:48] everybody. I'm going to go through the steps one through five again from the top. One, save one to $5,000,

[37:55] because that is the guaranteed fund of something that's going to happen to you. You just don't know when.

[38:00] Number two, you pay off your debts in order of smallest to biggest, not in terms of the number

[38:07] how much how much what percentage it's earning at. You pay in terms of how little you have to pay it

[38:11] so you can eliminate it and just start crossing out line items. All right. Step two. Step three,

[38:18] you save up three to six months of living expenses. It's up to you to depends on your risk

[38:23] talents. Marker, you probably saved three. You don't have kids or wife. You've got kids in a wife.

[38:27] You might want to save them. It's up to you. Step four, you look at what you're living with.

[38:33] So if you have a lease on a car, trade it in. Get a $5,000 car and live on that period. If you can

[38:40] downgrade where you live and what neighborhood you live in, do it. Is that can tell you? We just saw

[38:46] how 35% of your check is going to make someone else $74 million by the interviewer life.

[38:51] It's just up to you whether you want to make it or you want someone else to make it.

[38:54] Step four, actually that was a step one. If you insist on living, continue to step four,

[38:59] step four, be. If you insist on living in the same place as you live now,

[39:04] then refinance for a 15 year fix. That way you're going to get the vast majority of the one that

[39:09] your paying is going to go towards the equity of the house and not to interest fees. And if you do that,

[39:13] you'll be like, whoa, the amount I have to pay if you're going to have to spend so much more. It's

[39:16] almost like you're actually trying to buy it. Fifth, invest 15% of your pre-tax income, pre-tax. You have

[39:24] to do some math here. So if you make $50,000 a year, you multiply that by 0.15, just $7500. And that's what

[39:33] you say. That's minimum. You need more than that, do more than that. Get aggressive with that.

[39:38] Right? And if you want to be a superstar, let's say you do that 15 year fixed and you invest 15%

[39:46] you plow the rest of the excess cash that you have into that equity. So you can pay it off early.

[39:53] You need to make sure that you have no pre-payment penalties. So maybe pay your 15 year fixed

[39:57] off in 10. And then in 10 years, here's what's crazy. You have no car fee, you have no house fee,

[40:04] you've learned to live on far as then you may. And now everything beyond the food you eat

[40:10] goes into building your wealth. Everything. And you'll be, you will be frightened to see how

[40:16] fast it grows. And I will share one more fun fact for you guys today. Right now, Laila and for this year

[40:25] made more money on our money than we did from our companies. And I'm being transparent about this

[40:32] because I want to show you that it's possible. You also, if you read the book, see that I

[40:38] $1000 on my bank account saved up. And when I started my first year, I had $4,000 total.

[40:46] You can do this. It just takes discipline. It just takes making choices where you look

[40:51] Marcos, that pair of Jordans. Instead of seeing a pair of Jordans, you see $22,000.

[40:58] That's what you have to see. When you see go getting beers with the boys in the weekend for $20,

[41:02] right? Of course you wouldn't do that because you're 19 and that's below the legal drinking

[41:06] women. So the non-alcoholic beer that you get because you're a crazy person. And why would you

[41:09] drink that non-alcoholic beer you've made up? Anyways, so you go get your nine out of

[41:12] call like, oh, doodles, right, for $20. And instead, you see that that $6,000.

[41:18] $6,000 can be very expensive. So just about everyone here has been drinking top shelf their whole life.

[41:23] They just don't know. Okay. Yeah, one thing Alex, that's from, yes.

[41:26] I was about to wrap up and open it up. So we're good. Okay, cool. Something that, you know,

[41:32] because Alex and I obviously, you guys are probably like, well, you guys own the companies,

[41:35] you know, you have lots of money like these things. There's a few things I wanted to point out,

[41:39] which is one, when we first heard about money and money as attention was when we were literally

[41:46] we had, it was when we first started Jim launch, we went almost bankrupt, like, in credit card debt,

[41:50] like, all that stuff. That's when we got a co-tutotist log about money. And then the biggest

[41:54] things that he talked about was the attention of money, the attention of debt. And so with the first

[41:59] paycheck, I got from when Alex just paid me an employee when I had made all the sales in the Jim and

[42:04] Hawaii, I paid off all my debt with that. And so the reason for that was like, I only had a very

[42:09] small amount left. It was just like the attention that was going towards that debt, right?

[42:13] The second thing with that is the same as true with things that you accumulate. And this is

[42:17] something that we on the opportunity to learn as more recently. Like we had one car, we had a small

[42:22] apartment, we had all these things when we first started the companies. And then over time, you think,

[42:27] well, there's such a large discrepancy in between how I live and then what I have that maybe I can fill

[42:31] it a little bit. And then what happens is that you have attention on those things, because if you

[42:34] get a car that's more expensive, you can afford it, but the attention it takes because that, like,

[42:39] for an example, a Toyota, you take into the shop takes a week to fix. We have a car that's in a shop right

[42:44] now, it's been eight weeks, has been fixed, right? Things like that that become complex, even though

[42:48] it doesn't need to be. And so it's not even just the things that you're buying with money,

[42:52] it's the attention you get back when you start saving the money. So, for example, I used to tell people

[42:57] when they would come into the Jim, they'd be like, I'm in debt and I'm overweight in this net.

[43:01] I'd be like, well, you have your nails done, you're a hair done, you're a eyelashes. Like, why don't

[43:03] you just put those things on? They're like, well, I don't feel good about myself because of those things,

[43:08] right? I do those things to feel better about myself. But the reason you feel bad about yourself

[43:11] is because you're in debt and you're fat. So, what the hell? And so I think that a lot of times,

[43:16] those things that are like, vices, for example, cover like a short-term pain-fear anxiety insecurity

[43:21] we have, but it's actually just styling into the long-term one. And so it's like, in the short-term,

[43:26] it might feel worse to save that money, but in the long-term, you'll have way more attention and

[43:29] way less anxiety if you do. So, I just want to share that. I think it's even if you have the money to

[43:35] get stuff, stuff adds complexity, which adds more anxiety. And so it's like, we all want more money so

[43:41] we can have enough stuff, but then you just feel worse anyways. So it's just ironic.

[43:47] This is guys, this is valuable for you guys. This is different than leadership,

[43:52] management stuff, and how to run meetings, which are all very important as well. But my goal is

[43:57] if I can decrease the stress of everyone on this call by helping everyone make good financial decisions,

[44:03] then eventually we can operate as a company of people who are not stressed.

[44:08] Wouldn't that be nice? Because we realize that no matter what we're secure, and we know exactly what

[44:13] our expenses are, we know exactly how much we earn, and we know that we make far more than we spend.

[44:17] And we also understand that our 100% in control over our finances. And so my plea to you is that if you've

[44:23] ever felt like someone else's in control, or you feel like you've been dealt the shit at the stick,

[44:28] right, you drew the short straw, that no one fucking cares. And it's still up to you. Like no one's

[44:35] going to come to say, no one's going to come to say. But the good news is that what you need to do in

[44:40] order to become the 1% in case you're curious, $1 to $5 million in assets is the 1%.

[44:46] That's it. And we just showed Markos here how to do that with $25,000.

[44:51] And so when here, if you're like, man, but I've got, but I've got, but I'm different. You're not.

[45:00] Just stop. You're not. You're not. You're not. My metabolism's different. Really, you've solved

[45:08] obesity. We can just cure Africa from starvation because you're a metabolism special. You figured

[45:13] out away to not eat food and still gain weight. We have to put you in a lab so we can crack

[45:20] mountain nutrition. We can just figure out the genes that you have that somehow is you to not

[45:24] lose weight when you stop eating it. Right, somehow you've cracked arithmetic and somehow figured out

[45:29] away to spend even to somehow lose money and go on a more debt despite spending less than you

[45:37] earned. All right, like you're not special. The math is the math, right? And so I just like,

[45:44] I wanted to do this call because it's important to me that everyone here on this call can use

[45:48] Jim wants to become your financial vehicle for wealth and effort can do that. Minimum wage

[45:53] makes a million dollars over their lifespan and I showed you the contribution of the $5 dollar

[45:59] month version. It's $240,000 and it created $3 million. So the question is, do you want to look like

[46:04] you look like a king or actually look like a king? And I think that living like a king comes from

[46:08] the peace of mind that you get. And for me, that is how money serves me. So I could see if

[46:11] to figure out how money serves you or whether money serving you at all. But that $74 million

[46:16] that Marko has potential to make over his lifespan, that money is being made. The question is

[46:23] whether or not you want it to be you who makes it. All right, my sermon is over. You got five minutes left.

[46:28] I won't hold you. Otherwise, thank you guys for your attention. And if guys do get a chance,

[46:34] grab a copy of the our sponsored, our sponsored book, $100 million offer. You can find it

[46:38] on Amazon and the link. And if you feel so compelled to leave a lever of you that's good

[46:44] then please do so. If you hate the book, then please don't re-er of you. Anyway, lots of

[46:49] love guys. Appreciate you all. Thank you so much for being on this journey with us. I hope that we

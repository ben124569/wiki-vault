[00:00] You guys may hear something completely insane?

[00:02] Yes?

[00:02] OK.

[00:03] You're going to have to hear it anyways.

[00:04] I was able to take home more in a year

[00:05] than the CEOs of McDonald's, IKEA Ford, Motorola,

[00:10] and Yahoo combined as a kiddin' his 20s for over half a decade.

[00:16] Wow.

[00:17] There you go.

[00:19] Wow.

[00:20] Which resulted in $200 million in portfolio revenue

[00:25] as of today.

[00:26] We crossed $100 million.

[00:27] IH33.

[00:29] And to be honest, no one's more surprised

[00:31] than I am about this outcome.

[00:35] And so me expressing this will create envy and some people.

[00:39] It will create anger and others.

[00:41] Skepticism in most, confusion in old people.

[00:46] And inspire select few.

[00:48] And so the select few, you or who I'm making this for.

[00:52] Everyone else, you can chill.

[00:53] But you are the people that I'm making this for.

[00:56] Let's go back.

[00:57] So who wants to hear about some stuff

[00:59] that can shortcut their path to material success

[01:01] or they can ponder the purpose of achieving it to begin with?

[01:04] Yeah.

[01:05] All right.

[01:06] So we're going to cover three things today.

[01:09] It's just fresh from this morning, right off the press.

[01:11] Number one, how am I making money really works?

[01:14] Number two, why new stuff is making you poor?

[01:17] Number three, why better is it the way?

[01:21] You're like, that doesn't make sense yet.

[01:22] They will.

[01:24] Set simply.

[01:25] Who wants to make lots of money?

[01:27] Funny thing, what you're watching right now

[01:28] was not my original presentation.

[01:30] I actually changed it the very last minute that I before.

[01:33] I went out to get dessert.

[01:34] A bunch of people from the event were in town

[01:36] going to the place that I was by accident.

[01:39] As soon as I left the frozen Uber lunch,

[01:40] so I was like, the presentation I have for tomorrow

[01:43] is in what these people need.

[01:44] And so I spent that night in all morning

[01:46] making an entirely new presentation,

[01:48] which is what you are watching.

[01:49] Who believes that you have to work hard to make money?

[01:52] Who believes that no one can outwork them?

[01:57] You're gonna see where I'm gonna go with this.

[01:59] Well, I'm going to attempt to prove you wrong.

[02:02] The reason this is so important

[02:04] is that all of us claim or I have heard,

[02:06] who here is seeing a guru on the internet

[02:08] saying no one can outwork me?

[02:10] Who has heard people say that on podcasts?

[02:12] Make Instagram post about it, whatever.

[02:15] It actually drives me fucking bananas.

[02:17] And it drives me bananas because it teaches the wrong lesson.

[02:21] So how can we claim that we work every day

[02:25] and yet we can't even define the word?

[02:28] So how do you define work?

[02:30] The science definition is work equals four times distance.

[02:33] Problem with that is that it's not very useful

[02:35] for knowledge workers.

[02:36] Most of us are not actually doing manual labor, not useful.

[02:40] The second way is that you can think about it

[02:42] in terms of inputs of time, right?

[02:45] Is that how hard you work?

[02:46] No one can outwork me.

[02:48] I work longer hours.

[02:50] Do you think you're the only person who works 16, 18 hours

[02:53] every day?

[02:55] Like go to China.

[02:57] I'm like, I don't even know if anyone in America can say it.

[03:01] I'm being dead, like dead series.

[03:04] So that's why when I see these things

[03:05] just driving fucking nuts.

[03:08] So the problem with that is that many people work

[03:12] all the hours they're awake.

[03:13] And if you suggest working more hours

[03:14] than you're sleeping less

[03:15] and I don't think that's a good idea for knowledge workers.

[03:19] So why can no one outwork you again?

[03:21] Right, so everyone's working those hours.

[03:24] So then the next one is like effort.

[03:27] That's how no one can outwork me.

[03:29] No one's gonna try harder than me.

[03:32] So you want participation trophies.

[03:35] Is this how you want your employees to think

[03:37] that they're working hard?

[03:39] I mean not me.

[03:40] I wouldn't want that.

[03:42] So if it's not four times distance

[03:44] to define what work is.

[03:45] And if it's not the amount of time

[03:47] we're putting into the work that we do,

[03:49] and it's not the effort that we are expanding

[03:51] or how hard we try, then what's work?

[03:57] We have to get clear on it

[03:59] because if that's what we have to do to make money,

[04:02] then we gotta know what we're actually trying to fucking do.

[04:04] So here's Alex's definition.

[04:07] Work equals outputs, fancy image.

[04:12] Outputs equal volume times leverage.

[04:15] In plain speak,

[04:17] number of times you do something times

[04:19] how much you get out of each time you do it.

[04:23] How do we work faster?

[04:25] Work rate equals that same thing divided by time.

[04:29] Plains speak, output per minute of time.

[04:33] That is how you work faster.

[04:36] Which means that the hardest working man in the world

[04:38] can be objectively measured.

[04:42] That guy is the hardest guy working in the world.

[04:44] In 2022, he had a $140 billion net worth for context.

[04:48] That's more than Bill Gates did his entire career in one year.

[04:53] Think about that for a second.

[04:56] And then next year he did the exact same amount again.

[05:01] FYI, that's two billion a week.

[05:06] So output divided by time.

[05:08] There's the time one year, there's the output.

[05:12] He's the hardest working guy.

[05:15] So who's going to be the 2027 champ?

[05:18] What am you doing?

[05:19] This is I hope it's somebody here.

[05:21] Who would like to be the 2027 champ?

[05:23] All right, let's rock.

[05:25] So if you want to be it,

[05:26] then please play attention this will help you.

[05:28] So how can we get more output?

[05:31] Which in the game of business is enterprise value?

[05:33] It's how much shit is worth?

[05:35] Outputs, right?

[05:36] We have this one and now I've got a nice flex yarn.

[05:38] Volume is the number of times we move the lever.

[05:40] I literally made all these images this morning.

[05:42] Very, very proud of them.

[05:44] Volume is the number of times you move the lever.

[05:47] The lever is just the length of the lever itself

[05:49] that you're using.

[05:51] The output is how much you can lift on the other side.

[05:54] So let's look at a couple examples.

[05:55] You guys can just shout it when I say, just say,

[05:57] higher low.

[05:58] So high or low?

[06:02] Low.

[06:03] High or low?

[06:06] High.

[06:07] Higher low.

[06:10] Very high.

[06:12] The reason I put this one in here is that

[06:13] a certain point is not about how strong the person is.

[06:16] It all depends on how much leverage you have.

[06:19] That's the point of the slide.

[06:21] Now, higher low.

[06:24] Volume times a thousand, the thing's just as long as the other one.

[06:27] Highest.

[06:28] Yes.

[06:29] So now that we understand what work is,

[06:31] you can either do more activity,

[06:33] or you can do it with more leverage to get more output.

[06:37] Doing more is cap by time and physical ability.

[06:40] How much you get, aka leverage,

[06:43] is uncapped.

[06:45] No cap.

[06:46] I learned that.

[06:48] Gen Z, there we go.

[06:49] Of.

[06:52] Now, fun fact, Warren Buffett took home 500 million

[06:55] and dividends last year from Coca-Cola as an owner.

[06:58] The CEO took home 50.

[07:01] He spent less time working on Coca-Cola than the CO did.

[07:05] So is he working harder?

[07:07] By the definition that we did?

[07:09] Yes.

[07:10] We're output.

[07:12] We've been playing the game wrong.

[07:14] If you want to outwork your competition,

[07:16] what you really should be doing is outleveraging them.

[07:20] So who gets more done?

[07:22] One person does 100 calls a day.

[07:24] Another person does 100 calls a day.

[07:27] The guy who has more skill.

[07:29] One guy makes another calls, another guy makes another calls.

[07:31] The guy who's better on the phone gets more output.

[07:34] Okay, let's say they're equal skill.

[07:36] The working eight hours a day, making calls.

[07:39] Oh, I have to out the asked question.

[07:40] Who gets more worked done?

[07:41] There's the answer.

[07:42] The guy that has the automated dialer that

[07:44] keeps his talk time the highest.

[07:47] Okay, same skill, same number of hours,

[07:51] and same automated dialer to maximize talk time.

[07:54] Now, who gets more worked done?

[07:57] The guy who is the best list.

[08:00] Okay, they've got the same list.

[08:03] The same skill, same dialer, eight hours a day.

[08:05] The guy who's calling to the right season the right time a day.

[08:11] Who wants to be calling someone shit during December,

[08:13] if you're selling physical products?

[08:16] Who wants to sell them, Brock Friday?

[08:18] Of course, more leverage, same work, more output.

[08:22] Okay, let's say all this stuff's equal.

[08:24] Now who's even, all right, I mean, what else do we have?

[08:30] Nice, he actually called it.

[08:31] The guy calling with the better offer.

[08:35] Now we've got the same time a year, same list, same offer,

[08:39] same dialer, equal skill, eight hours a day.

[08:41] Now who's going to do it?

[08:42] He's got to be equal now, right?

[08:45] The guy who recorded his pitch and said it to 10 million people.

[08:51] Now, to push this even further,

[08:54] what if the guy made zero calls and didn't do anything?

[08:58] Who makes more against the best call on earth?

[09:02] The guy who's got a team.

[09:03] He's got 15 dudes on the phone.

[09:04] Okay, how good you are.

[09:06] And if you're like, well, I think I could be 15.

[09:08] You can't be 1500.

[09:10] Okay, here you are.

[09:11] Leverage.

[09:12] And that guy made zero calls.

[09:14] I have more people calling for me today while I'm on stage.

[09:17] Leverage.

[09:19] The game is rigged and you've been playing by rules

[09:22] that do not exist.

[09:26] If you want to make more money,

[09:28] you need to get more for your time.

[09:31] You need more leverage.

[09:32] And this should make sense because we all trade time for money.

[09:37] And I can prove this to you.

[09:39] You spend time every second of your life.

[09:43] You receive money over the time that you are alive.

[09:47] So money divided by time equals rate of output.

[09:51] We are all paid dollars per hour.

[09:54] The reason I'm specifically saying this to this audience

[09:57] is that you all get fooled all the fucking time by passive income.

[10:01] It's not passive.

[10:04] It's less active.

[10:06] But it is not binary.

[10:07] It is not active or passive.

[10:08] It's how active is it.

[10:11] So if you make one trade in the stock market,

[10:14] all the time took you to analyze the deal.

[10:16] And every other deal you decided not to do.

[10:19] And then execute the trade

[10:21] and then raise the money into all the other stuff.

[10:22] That is all the time that it took you to do that.

[10:26] Now, after that point, you have increasing returns

[10:28] for a period of time.

[10:30] Is this making sense?

[10:32] The point I'm making here is that time is the thing.

[10:36] We all have the same $24 in our wallet.

[10:39] It's about how we allocate them and what we get back for them.

[10:42] How well we trade.

[10:47] Just said that.

[10:48] There you go.

[10:48] Degrease all that.

[10:51] So leverage is the difference between what you put in

[10:54] and what you get out.

[10:55] There are fancy definitions for it.

[10:56] This is the best one that I have.

[11:00] And so I said I would cover three things.

[11:01] The first one is how making money really works.

[11:04] The answer to that question is leverage.

[11:06] You make more money by trading your time for more shit.

[11:10] More output.

[11:12] The second is why new stuff is making you poor.

[11:15] And this is especially relevant for everyone here.

[11:17] Part of this, again, was inspired by the conversations

[11:20] I was having last night at Yogurt Land.

[11:21] So thank you for everybody who showed up for that.

[11:24] This is also how not to get leverage.

[11:26] And I felt compelled to make this because I hope that some of you

[11:29] identify with this because I would bet that the majority of you

[11:33] are doing this.

[11:37] How not to get leverage.

[11:38] There are five pieces to this that I want to break down today.

[11:41] Number one, uninformed optimism.

[11:43] Number two is a story I'll tell you about a construction

[11:45] buddy of mine.

[11:45] Number three is something that you're holding magic

[11:47] one story.

[11:48] Number four is half bill bridges.

[11:49] Number five is one of the red dress.

[11:51] You're like, I have no fucking clue what that means.

[11:52] You will.

[11:53] So let's start with uninformed optimism.

[11:56] Who here has seen this?

[11:57] This is stages of change, stages of transition.

[11:59] Anyone seen this, this chart before?

[12:01] OK, cool, not a lot of you.

[12:02] Perfect.

[12:03] So there are five steps.

[12:04] And I remember the first time I saw this,

[12:06] it like it changed my life.

[12:09] Whenever you're analyzing something new,

[12:12] who here has had a buddy tell you about something that they're doing

[12:15] and they're making a lot of money doing it.

[12:17] And then you immediately feel shitty about what you're doing

[12:18] and then think, I should get out of my opportunity.

[12:21] Vehicle go over here and do what they're doing.

[12:23] Who has felt that?

[12:24] Thank you.

[12:25] Everyone has.

[12:26] The reason is because we're at step one, which

[12:28] is uninformed optimism.

[12:30] You don't know enough about what they're saying.

[12:33] They're just giving you the highlights.

[12:34] They're giving you the Instagram reel.

[12:36] They're not giving you the reel.

[12:38] Yeah.

[12:41] Once you decide to get out of your little vehicle

[12:44] and then go over there, then you tell your buddy,

[12:46] like, hey, why am I making money?

[12:47] He's like, oh, well, there's like a hundred other fucking

[12:49] steps that I didn't talk to you about in the beginning,

[12:51] but like, and it's actually nearly impossible.

[12:53] I got really lucky that one time.

[12:56] And now, I've said it looks like all the people at your old

[12:58] job are making one one of the new.

[12:59] But yeah, let's keep doing it.

[13:02] So you moved to state two, which is informed pessimism.

[13:05] You were now aware of the shit that is involved

[13:07] to make the money that you want and this new thing.

[13:11] Now you think, okay, this is probably the worst part.

[13:14] But then, time elapses.

[13:17] And it's still shitty.

[13:19] And you still haven't made money yet.

[13:22] It blows more now because you have invested more time

[13:25] and still have zero.

[13:27] So you're actual output to time is low ray,

[13:30] which is why it's so painful,

[13:32] which is where people get into the crisis of meaning.

[13:35] Why the fuck am I doing this?

[13:36] What is money even matter anyways?

[13:37] You know what I'd be happier if I just spent more time

[13:39] with my kids.

[13:40] You change your goal because you encounter difficulty.

[13:44] And so what happens most times is that people then crash

[13:48] and burn.

[13:49] I'm gonna skip one forward and then I'm gonna come back

[13:52] because I want the visual to work the way I want.

[13:55] Half-fuck it.

[13:56] Okay, so if you're at the crisis of meaning,

[13:58] this is where most people offshoot.

[14:00] What happens here where that fourth dot there on the bottom?

[14:04] If I were to cross it out and write uninformed

[14:06] op in the music, again, that's what most of you do.

[14:10] You find about something cool.

[14:12] Informed pessimism, it kinda sucks.

[14:15] Oh shit, it's way harder than I thought.

[14:18] I'd informed optimism, I'll try something else.

[14:21] And then you do it again and again and again.

[14:25] And the difference between video games

[14:27] and real life where you face the boss

[14:29] and you can't pass the level until you beat the boss

[14:32] is that when you die in the video game,

[14:34] you restart a few seconds later.

[14:36] And the game of entrepreneurship, you start a year's later.

[14:40] This is why people don't progress.

[14:42] They keep fighting the same boss

[14:43] that can't learn the same fucking lesson.

[14:45] They keep losing.

[14:47] And I'm saying this because some of you,

[14:48] I heard it, you overland,

[14:49] and I know that that's representative of other people here,

[14:52] you keep fighting the same boss

[14:54] and the boss is being able to stick with it.

[14:58] Is getting through in different charts on this,

[15:01] the crisis of meaning is also called the value of despair,

[15:04] is getting through.

[15:07] From there, you get into informed optimism.

[15:10] You figure out that little thing,

[15:11] like, ah, I had to do this one thing

[15:13] and then this started working.

[15:14] And then you know what?

[15:14] I found out I could clean the list through this tool

[15:16] I found on the internet because I joined this forum

[15:18] and they started doing that and all of a sudden,

[15:19] I pick up rates tripled, right?

[15:21] Or my response rates tripled.

[15:23] Or my throughput on my website went up.

[15:24] Whatever it is, right?

[15:26] And so you have to get through that piece,

[15:29] then you get to informed optimism and the number six you achieve.

[15:32] And then all your friends are like,

[15:34] what are you doing?

[15:35] You're like, oh, I got this thing

[15:37] and then all of them come, right?

[15:41] That is where most people start something new.

[15:43] Over and over and over again,

[15:43] and they don't learn the lesson.

[15:46] And so this is what their life looks like.

[15:49] Over and over and over and over again.

[15:54] Who here has more than one business

[15:56] in the last 24 months?

[15:57] Be honest.

[15:59] Thank you for being honest.

[16:00] I appreciate it.

[16:02] First thing, it's normal.

[16:04] I had nine businesses and I was broke.

[16:06] So I say this with the pain of experience.

[16:08] I'm not saying this to be on a pulpit.

[16:10] I'm saying it because the fast you can get through it.

[16:12] The faster you will start making money,

[16:14] you have to beat the boss.

[16:18] Everyone thinks the grass is greener

[16:19] but the other side still lined with shit.

[16:22] So like that's why the grass is so green.

[16:24] They're shit everywhere.

[16:25] I've a CFO who's been with us for a long time.

[16:27] She went through all of our exits last year.

[16:29] She's probably almost 60.

[16:31] And she has to say she's like, it's all shit.

[16:33] Doesn't matter what business it is,

[16:35] they all got shit.

[16:36] She's southern.

[16:38] And Suzanne's awesome.

[16:40] But it just always reminds me of this

[16:41] is that there's always shit.

[16:42] And whenever we're starting something new,

[16:44] we encounter something that we didn't know before.

[16:46] And we're like, oh, this makes this shitier.

[16:48] And then we think, well, are we going to jump out?

[16:50] No.

[16:51] Well, this is new information.

[16:53] Great. We're more informed.

[16:54] Fantastic.

[16:55] So that is the thing number one that is keeping you poor.

[16:58] Uninformed optimism.

[17:00] Number two is a little story I want to tell you.

[17:02] So I was called up probably two, three years ago

[17:05] by a guy I knew in high school.

[17:07] We hadn't talked in a while.

[17:08] And he said, hey, I've got this roofing business.

[17:11] I want to scale it.

[17:11] I want to go big.

[17:12] I was like, that's awesome, man.

[17:14] And so he's telling me about the roofing business.

[17:15] He's telling me about the roofing business.

[17:16] And the normal thing he says, oh, yeah.

[17:19] I mean, we also do some general contracting work.

[17:21] I was like, OK.

[17:25] Why don't you grow the roofing business?

[17:26] He's like, you know, don't leave money on table.

[17:28] OK.

[17:29] Oh.

[17:32] And then this is going to sink in for some of you guys.

[17:35] And then it was like, so you've got the roofing,

[17:37] you got the GC stuff.

[17:39] And he's like, yeah, that's what I'm doing.

[17:40] He's like, he paused for a second.

[17:42] He's like, well, we also kind of flip houses too.

[17:45] So we like, fix them and flip them.

[17:47] We also do the contracting work.

[17:49] But we fix the roof so we just get huge cost.

[17:51] We're vertically integrated.

[17:53] I was like, did you make a less than three million bucks

[17:54] you're going to fucking vertically integrate?

[17:55] You're distracted.

[17:56] Right?

[17:58] And he was like, how do I scale?

[18:01] And I was like, just pick one.

[18:03] He was like, what do you mean?

[18:04] I was like, pick one.

[18:05] He was like, why do you think you can't build a billion-dollar roofing

[18:07] business?

[18:08] Just doing roofing.

[18:10] And just get better at doing roofing.

[18:12] Is it what I don't want to leave money on the table?

[18:14] Who here said they don't want to leave money on the table?

[18:17] The money you were leaving on the table

[18:19] is the focus that you were not giving to the one thing that matters.

[18:26] And so by the way, this is the self-made's woman list for Forbes.

[18:29] This is Diane Hendrix.

[18:31] She's the number one, while the self-made woman, by the way.

[18:34] And she owns, if you can see it there, ABC supply,

[18:38] which is roofing.

[18:41] Not?

[18:42] Hasliping.

[18:43] Not General Contracting work.

[18:45] roofing.

[18:47] Why didn't he build that?

[18:50] He's smarter than Diane Hendrix.

[18:51] That's why.

[18:53] So this is the list.

[18:55] And this is what I want you to notice about this.

[18:56] This is the Forbes, the top six for women, it's off made.

[19:01] Notice the age of the people on there, age is the left column, 75, 78,

[19:05] 84, 90, 89, 63.

[19:09] On the right, notice the source.

[19:11] Roofing, healthcare software, retail and gas stations,

[19:14] trucking, little-seasers pizza, IT.

[19:19] So sexy.

[19:24] The point of this slide is that if you want to build something epic,

[19:28] you have to be able to do the same thing

[19:30] for an extended period of time without convincing yourself

[19:32] or smarter than you are.

[19:36] Which means, if you wanted to not make money,

[19:39] this is what you should do.

[19:40] Number one, do lots of different things.

[19:44] Number two, do them for short periods of time.

[19:46] Don't stick with it too long, because you might see success.

[19:50] Number three, do not get help.

[19:52] Okay?

[19:53] Number four, make all the mistakes in your own.

[19:55] It's the best way to do it.

[19:57] Because otherwise, if you start learning

[19:58] who other people's mistakes, you can move faster.

[19:59] So don't want to do that.

[20:01] When you make a mistake, do it again.

[20:03] Just repeat it.

[20:04] Especially if you're like, I've been here before.

[20:06] Do the same thing.

[20:07] We here knows the definition of learning.

[20:09] I'll tell you.

[20:12] Same condition, different behavior.

[20:16] So if you want to teach someone something

[20:17] and you present them the same condition

[20:20] and they have not changed their behavior,

[20:21] they have not learned.

[20:24] If you came to this workshop this weekend

[20:27] with the intention of learning something,

[20:28] can I get everybody raised here

[20:30] if they had the intention of learning something

[20:31] while they were here?

[20:33] If you go back home and your behavior does not change,

[20:37] you learned nothing.

[20:40] Nothing.

[20:41] Truly took the money and burned it

[20:44] along with losing the output that you lost

[20:46] in the time of here plus travel.

[20:49] So that definition has been sinned into my mind

[20:52] because if I want to learn something

[20:54] and I have the same condition that's been presented,

[20:56] I have to ask myself, if I do the same thing,

[20:58] again, I mean, I have not learned.

[21:00] And I don't want to play this boss again.

[21:03] So if you do want to make money, you can flip it.

[21:06] You do one thing for a very long period of time.

[21:09] You get health from other people.

[21:10] You observe what other people have been doing.

[21:12] You only make the mistake one time.

[21:14] If you are going to make them,

[21:15] and you always grow and challenge the beliefs that you had

[21:18] and try and answer the question,

[21:19] what do I believe to be true that it's not?

[21:24] Because ordinary businesses don't

[21:26] for extraordinary time create extraordinary results.

[21:29] Compounding is the thing.

[21:31] Like it has to compound.

[21:33] If the vehicle you're in right now does not compound

[21:35] with time, then change the vehicle.

[21:37] Get into something that if you stick with it for an extended period

[21:40] of time, it would be unreasonable that you will be poor.

[21:44] That was my construction buddy story.

[21:48] So I had a conversation with a different friend.

[21:51] He had a zillion businesses, like a zillion.

[21:53] I get a spreadsheet from a businesses yet.

[21:55] And they were all bullshit businesses.

[21:57] They don't actually make any money.

[21:58] But he had a logo on a website.

[21:59] And like some VA, you know what I mean?

[22:01] Like, oh, it's a business.

[22:03] And he was believing the fallacy of,

[22:06] I'm just going to wait to see the thing

[22:08] that takes off and then go on and on that.

[22:10] Who here has thought this thought?

[22:13] I get it.

[22:14] I'm going to focus.

[22:15] I'm just going to wait.

[22:16] I'm going to be patient.

[22:17] See, which one works out?

[22:18] And then, because I'm a good, you know, statistics guy,

[22:22] I'm going to go with the winning horse, right?

[22:25] But the reality is that any of them can take off.

[22:28] You can have a billion dollar roofing business,

[22:30] get a billion dollar GC business.

[22:31] You can have a billion dollar house full business.

[22:35] But you can't have them all.

[22:38] So you got to focus.

[22:39] You got a pick one.

[22:40] And the nice thing is, it doesn't really matter

[22:41] which one you pick.

[22:42] But you do need to pick one.

[22:44] The picking is the thing that grows it.

[22:46] The ability to say no is the thing that grows it.

[22:48] Not the thing you pick.

[22:50] It's who you are as a consequence of the decision

[22:53] that changes the outcome.

[22:55] Not the vehicle.

[22:56] That makes sense.

[22:58] So how arrogant is it to think that we can do multiple things

[23:02] at once and compete with someone who's spending all their time

[23:05] on that one thing?

[23:06] It's ridiculous.

[23:07] And yet we still do it.

[23:09] And so this is, I love this little cartoon.

[23:11] This guy's got all the spinning plates.

[23:13] And this is me with the red hair going to this guy who's

[23:18] hopefully my competitor and handing him more plates.

[23:20] He'll be like, oh, do you see all that shiny object

[23:22] over there?

[23:22] Here are more plates.

[23:24] Go.

[23:24] I'm just going to do this one thing.

[23:27] It's my favorite thing in the world.

[23:28] Competing against somebody who's doing lots of things.

[23:30] It's very easy to win.

[23:31] You don't have to do much because you only have to do

[23:34] a tenth of what they do.

[23:37] So this is what focus really looks like.

[23:40] One thing, all in.

[23:43] You can write that down and you can circle it.

[23:46] One thing, all in.

[23:47] So I asked my friend of mine that had to excels

[23:49] she with all these zillions of questions.

[23:50] I said, if I had to magic wand,

[23:52] and I ended all your side projects except for one.

[23:56] Just one.

[23:57] The one that you think has the most opportunity,

[23:58] the one that's probably making the most money right now

[24:00] that you're not paying attention to,

[24:01] because it's boring because it's all

[24:02] it could be doing it a while.

[24:03] Is that guy?

[24:04] I was like, you know what business it is?

[24:05] He's like, yeah.

[24:07] I go, okay.

[24:08] If you ended everything else, I have a magic wand.

[24:10] So I get to make the rules.

[24:12] Magic wand.

[24:13] They all disappear.

[24:14] I said, how easy would it be to grow that thing?

[24:16] He just looked at me and he was like, really fucking easy.

[24:20] I was like, hmm, interesting.

[24:24] And so he's like, but that would be so hard

[24:26] because of insert real reason that no one gives a fuck about.

[24:31] No one cares, but I have to fire that,

[24:33] a huh?

[24:34] But I would have to shut that a huh?

[24:37] But I would have to lay off the a huh?

[24:41] All the riches you want are on the other side

[24:43] of a few hard conversations.

[24:45] And most people spend the rest of their lives

[24:46] not having them in being porn one or another.

[24:49] It's gonna suck.

[24:51] It's gonna be okay.

[24:54] That was my number three story, magic wand.

[24:57] Number four, my favorite story.

[24:59] Who here has seen the matrix?

[25:02] Awesome.

[25:03] You need to become the person who can say no

[25:05] to the woman the red dress.

[25:08] The woman in the red dress is the representation

[25:10] of everything that is shiny object

[25:11] and beautiful and wonderful in the world.

[25:12] Whatever your flavor of woman in the red dress is.

[25:17] And the thing is, and this is something

[25:19] that I have now learned painstakingly

[25:21] is that being able to see no to the one in the red dress

[25:23] changes at levels.

[25:26] You can say no to the one in the red dress

[25:28] who's a crackhead on the corner, right?

[25:30] Thousand bucks a month.

[25:31] You're like, I can say no to her.

[25:33] No worries.

[25:34] Well, I got something better, right?

[25:37] But then the $10,000 month girl, you're like, huh?

[25:40] Okay, interesting.

[25:41] And if you're making $10,000 a month,

[25:43] it's hard to say no to that girl.

[25:45] But let's say that you're a hardworking

[25:49] discipline motherfucker.

[25:50] You get to $100,000 a month.

[25:52] There's a $100,000 month girl that's an opportunity

[25:56] that is much bigger than the one that you said

[25:57] no to before.

[25:58] And you have to learn to flex the muscle at every level.

[26:01] This is a lesson that I learned the hard way.

[26:04] I started a supplement company when Jim Moans

[26:07] was doing 26 million a year and rather than say,

[26:09] oh, why don't I just take Jim Moans to 40 next year?

[26:13] I'll start another thing.

[26:14] Jim Moans stayed the same and then I added

[26:17] another source of revenue that got us to 37.

[26:19] But it was a mistake strategically.

[26:21] I can tell the story, it sounds great.

[26:23] On paper, we sold a company, lots of money, whatever.

[26:25] But it was not the right move.

[26:28] And so I had learned how to say no to a million

[26:31] to opportunity, a $5 million, a $10 million.

[26:34] But I hadn't learned how to say no to a $20 million

[26:36] opportunity when I was making $20 million.

[26:39] And so the woman of the red dress becomes more seductive,

[26:42] more attractive, the better you get.

[26:45] The more status you get, the hotter the girl you attract.

[26:49] And I'm saying this figuratively for entrepreneurs.

[26:51] Does that make sense for everybody who's not

[26:52] into women with red dresses?

[26:54] OK.

[26:56] Because this is what the woman of the red dress really looks

[26:57] like.

[27:03] Just ready to smash your shit and distract you

[27:07] and spread you thin so that you can't keep your eye on the ball.

[27:11] And then eventually, she spreads you so thin

[27:14] that you don't know how to get out.

[27:16] And it feels like quicks and things.

[27:17] As soon as you put out fires here, there's fires here,

[27:19] there's fires here, fires here, I need more talent.

[27:22] You take the best person from over here to fix that problem.

[27:24] Then this thing goes to shit.

[27:26] How do you get out?

[27:27] Got to cut shit.

[27:27] Got to eat your ego.

[27:29] You got to watch your revenue go down

[27:31] so that you can refocus, reconcility, bring the troops in.

[27:34] I'm saying this because someone here needs to do this.

[27:36] And I wish I had fucking heard this.

[27:38] From somebody else, I would avoid a lot of pain.

[27:43] So how do you become that person who can say no

[27:45] to the woman of the red dress?

[27:47] You do the activity someone with those character traits

[27:49] would do despite not feeling good about it.

[27:52] So I'll tell you a story that I'll drive this home.

[27:54] So Laila, I run this walk, not that long ago.

[27:57] And I said, I'm so impatient.

[28:01] I need to be more patient.

[28:03] She was like, I don't think you're impatient.

[28:07] I was like, yeah, I fucking hate this.

[28:09] I want this to be faster.

[28:10] I want everything to be bigger, faster, stronger.

[28:12] She's like, yeah, but you're not changing your behavior.

[28:16] Like you feel that way.

[28:17] But you haven't done anything that's not aligned

[28:19] with the long term strategic vision.

[28:21] I was like, yeah, but I feel fucking terrible.

[28:23] I want to be like zen about it.

[28:25] She's like, yeah, that's not how it works.

[28:27] She's like, patience is about the behaviors we do,

[28:29] not how we feel about the behaviors.

[28:32] So who here has heard the quote, courage is not

[28:34] the absence of fear, but it's action to spite fear.

[28:36] But patience is not feeling impatient

[28:40] and feeling terrible about not jumping on these opportunities.

[28:44] It's about not jumping on the opportunities

[28:46] despite feeling like shit about it and wanting to.

[28:49] Right, loyalty is not necessarily about the fact

[28:51] that your eye doesn't get caught every once in a while.

[28:54] Or maybe even feel it as eyeer that you wish

[28:56] you didn't feel.

[28:57] It's about what you act on it.

[29:00] Because who here would rather have somebody,

[29:01] I think you already know where I'm going with this.

[29:03] In terms of loyalty, how would you rather?

[29:06] Rather the person not act on the thought,

[29:08] that is how you gain the trait.

[29:10] And then over time, this is my belief,

[29:12] if you do that enough times, those feelings go away

[29:16] through exposure therapy.

[29:18] Like you get exposed to this condition over and over again,

[29:20] and eventually, you know that you don't die,

[29:23] because that's what it feels like.

[29:25] And so whether it's a loyalty issue

[29:27] and integrity issue, a courage issue, a focus issue,

[29:29] which is the point of this message today,

[29:31] to become that person, you just start acting like

[29:37] the person who has those beliefs,

[29:38] and you behave in that way,

[29:40] and then it will stink in.

[29:43] One minute I address.

[29:44] So, new distraction to kill leverage and keep you poor.

[29:47] Focus, multiplies it.

[29:49] I said three things.

[29:51] Number one, how make you money really works?

[29:53] It all comes down to leverage.

[29:54] Number two, while making new stuff is making you poor.

[29:58] Which means you have to focus.

[29:59] And number three is why better is leverage.

[30:03] This is the make money part.

[30:05] Here's a simple approach to growth

[30:07] that we use with our portfolio companies.

[30:09] Better is better than new.

[30:13] Better is leverage.

[30:15] As you remember, leverage is how we get more

[30:17] from what we put in.

[30:18] If you do a better, you get more for what you put in.

[30:21] That is leverage.

[30:23] Examples, if you have call scripts,

[30:26] if you make content, if you have websites

[30:28] that you're building, if you have follow-up sequences,

[30:31] if you have offers, if you do the current thing,

[30:34] you get what you currently have.

[30:36] If you make it better, you will get more from the activities.

[30:40] You can create leverage in your business by being better.

[30:45] And better comes from boring.

[30:48] Most of us solved an emotional need

[30:49] by quitting whatever we were doing

[30:50] to start to become an entrepreneur.

[30:52] And then we had a positive reinforcement

[30:54] from that behavior.

[30:56] And so then we learned that as a way of life.

[30:59] But the problem is that the thing that forced you

[31:01] or gave you that emotional, that decrease your action threshold,

[31:05] thus that you would jump into the next thing,

[31:08] is the very thing that will make you jump out of the opportunity

[31:10] that could become your billion dollar thing.

[31:13] Does that make sense?

[31:14] You felt uncomfortable in your job.

[31:16] Quit your job, you got rewarded.

[31:17] And so you think, oh, when I quit things,

[31:19] I'll get rewarded.

[31:20] That's the wrong lesson.

[31:21] It only works once.

[31:23] And then you have to unlearn it.

[31:24] And with each level of entrepreneurship,

[31:25] there are lessons like that.

[31:26] They have to unlearn the thing that got you there.

[31:30] Better comes from boring.

[31:31] It is not exciting to run your 38th split test

[31:35] on a landing page.

[31:36] It does make you more money.

[31:40] It comes from doing all the shit that you know

[31:41] you should be doing but art.

[31:43] And so right now, this is an activity.

[31:44] So this is an active part.

[31:46] Imagine a list of all the stuff you know

[31:49] you should be doing but art doing right now

[31:51] within your existing business.

[31:52] Like right now, like top of your head,

[31:56] you know there's some shit that you should be doing

[31:58] in your business.

[31:59] I'm going to give you 15 seconds.

[32:07] The reason that stuff is so important

[32:09] is because you already know what you need to do.

[32:12] And we come here to get raw rod, et cetera.

[32:17] But the shit is on your desk at home.

[32:21] That is the work that must be done.

[32:23] It needs doing.

[32:25] And most of us know what to do

[32:26] and we don't want to confront it

[32:27] because we want to do something more simulated

[32:29] and exciting that makes us feel alive

[32:31] and your business doesn't give a fuck.

[32:34] Better is boring and better gets you more

[32:37] for what you put in.

[32:38] Better is leverage.

[32:39] Now imagine who here has a few businesses,

[32:43] you're really fucking hard to make that a list.

[32:45] Wouldn't it?

[32:46] There's too much shit.

[32:47] There's too much, too much stuff to make the business.

[32:51] Which means, becomes impossible.

[32:54] Which means that's why you have to pick one

[32:55] because there are so much stuff that has to be done

[32:58] to do one business right.

[33:00] Just do it right.

[33:02] If you do it right, you grow by default.

[33:05] It is a promise.

[33:09] Who here is like, I know I should be doing more email follow.

[33:12] I know I should be calling my leads within five minutes.

[33:14] Who here thinks that?

[33:15] Right now.

[33:17] Okay, let me ask the different questions

[33:18] and many of you did raise your hand.

[33:20] Who here calls other leads within five minutes?

[33:23] Okay, like two hands.

[33:25] You will triple your sales.

[33:27] Triple.

[33:28] Triple.

[33:29] Go on to triple the fucking business.

[33:31] Triple.

[33:32] But that sounds boring.

[33:35] Sure is.

[33:36] Got an implement CRM.

[33:37] Got to get round robin set up.

[33:39] Leeds got to come in.

[33:40] You got to figure out how call prioritization works

[33:42] between the team.

[33:43] That's boring.

[33:44] Makes you shitload of money.

[33:47] That's how it works.

[33:48] Who's going to win?

[33:49] You're from businesses.

[33:50] The guys you got to shit dialed.

[33:52] Better gets you more for what you put in.

[33:58] When you do get home, order it from the amount you have to put in

[34:03] to get the thing done that will result in the most output

[34:06] and start taking them off.

[34:10] Then you continue to ignore the new things that sound

[34:12] really exciting.

[34:13] When you become the person who's able to do that,

[34:15] by pretending to be the person who's able to do that.

[34:18] You already know what to do.

[34:20] So this is a mental monologue really like a lot.

[34:24] Who here has ever had a coach or a mentor?

[34:26] Has anyone ever coach or mentored other people?

[34:28] Does anyone feel like they're a better mentor than they are

[34:30] a person who does shit?

[34:33] I did it all the time.

[34:36] And so the thing is, I asked myself this question.

[34:38] It's actually been one of the most profound, most helpful questions

[34:41] I've had, which is, if I were coaching me and the beautiful thing

[34:44] about this is that when you coach you, you have no other agenda.

[34:47] You're just trying to help you.

[34:49] And you also have more information than anyone else has.

[34:52] You've been on every conversation.

[34:54] You've read every email.

[34:55] You've seen every report.

[34:57] So if you were coaching you right now, what would you tell you

[35:01] to do?

[35:02] And what's crazy about this is that half the fucking time

[35:05] is not what I'm doing.

[35:07] Coach me much smarter than me, man.

[35:13] Moomu.

[35:13] OK.

[35:15] Take your own advice.

[35:17] If you do that, I promise you'll make more money.

[35:20] Feel like, ah, I don't have a special stuff like.

[35:23] You're just convincing yourself that you're smarter than you are

[35:24] and giving yourself reasons that reality does not apply to you.

[35:28] It does.

[35:29] And this is just a boss level.

[35:30] You might need to keep going against the snowflake until eventually

[35:32] you figure out that you just got a melt of by being there and hanging

[35:36] in.

[35:37] And so in my entrepreneurial career, there was two periods.

[35:39] Very clear definitions of periods of time in my life.

[35:43] The first period was when I was distracted.

[35:46] This is when I did not make money.

[35:47] I had six gyms.

[35:49] I had a launch business where we do gym turn around in person.

[35:53] That's where I actually physically was, not at my gyms.

[35:55] I had a dentist, a dental agency,

[35:59] had a co-practor agency.

[36:01] I think I had something else.

[36:05] More lots of fingers.

[36:06] And I was 26.

[36:08] Ish.

[36:10] And I would love to tell you, oh, I own nine companies, right?

[36:16] I'm poor.

[36:17] But.

[36:20] But it felt really good.

[36:22] Shruck my ego.

[36:23] Now I'm a bank account.

[36:24] So it was only one.

[36:26] Layout.

[36:26] The angel of my life was like, hey, you know,

[36:30] this one makes us the most money and you spend the least amount of time

[36:32] on it.

[36:33] That gym was the thing actually works.

[36:37] But I have to like, I would have to like sell all those gyms.

[36:39] I'd have to end partnerships.

[36:40] I'd have to let go of people in the agency.

[36:42] And she was like, yeah, or you just keep doing what you do.

[36:45] I'm just clearly working.

[36:47] I'm just making a point taken.

[36:51] And so over the next 90 days, I sold five gyms, shut one down,

[36:55] shut down both agencies, and got rid of everything.

[37:01] And 12 months later, from that moment,

[37:05] we were doing one and a half million a month.

[37:08] From zero.

[37:10] And so, and 12 months after that, we were at four and a half million a month.

[37:13] One thing.

[37:15] And so this was the second period.

[37:17] Just focus.

[37:18] It's so much easier to stack the deck in your favor if you just do one thing.

[37:22] Because when you focus on one thing, you make it unreasonable to fail.

[37:24] If you do one thing for an extended period of time,

[37:26] it becomes unreasonable to suck.

[37:27] If you do it more than anyone else has done it,

[37:29] you'll be better than that.

[37:31] Just this is what it is.

[37:31] People last time they're like, hey, how do you get so good at sales?

[37:33] That's like 4,000 fucking sales costs.

[37:35] That's how I did it.

[37:36] So I did it.

[37:36] I didn't even go through sales training.

[37:38] I'd 4,000 fucking conversations.

[37:39] That's how I did it.

[37:41] And so if you wanted to be the best salesman in the world,

[37:43] then have more sales conversations than anyone else has.

[37:46] If you want to be the best real estate investor,

[37:47] then do more deals than anyone else has.

[37:49] And the sub, like the sub scope before that,

[37:51] is send out more mailers than anyone else has.

[37:53] Have more co-cars than anyone else has.

[37:54] Send more co-dms than anyone else has.

[37:57] And you'll become the best.

[37:58] And if you put that as the output, the thing that you're looking at,

[38:01] it becomes unreasonable that you would be not the best.

[38:05] Like you're at least going to be top 10.

[38:07] And if who here would be top 10 in real estate in the US,

[38:09] did you be okay with that?

[38:11] All right, it wouldn't be bad.

[38:13] And the thing is, everyone fails

[38:14] because they want to move fast.

[38:15] This is the number one issue.

[38:17] So they don't have a solid foundation.

[38:20] They draw the dotted line.

[38:21] They think I'm going to try and shortcut it.

[38:23] I'm not going to fix my product.

[38:24] I'm not going to make it really good because I want to go fast

[38:26] because I want to show to my friends

[38:27] that I'm growing every month on a show.

[38:29] Good I am.

[38:30] The thing is, it's a short game.

[38:32] Like how many times, it's like,

[38:36] the restaurant example is so simple.

[38:37] So many people start a restaurant.

[38:39] Slap two pieces of one or bread together,

[38:41] put a slice of baloney in there,

[38:42] and then market it like fucking crazy.

[38:44] And they're like, dude, I don't get why my business

[38:46] just isn't growing.

[38:46] And like, everyone who has your food literally

[38:48] tells everyone that fucking sucks and never come back.

[38:52] So there's this invisible hand that works against people,

[38:55] which is who knows about the power of word of mouth, right?

[39:00] The invisible hand, who here runs ads?

[39:02] Let me ask that question.

[39:02] Who here runs ads for diesm?

[39:03] Okay.

[39:05] If you run ads and it has become more expensive

[39:07] for you disproportionate to the increase in CPMs,

[39:10] just cost for impression or eyeballs,

[39:11] in that period of time that you've been in business,

[39:13] then it means that you have negative word of mouth.

[39:17] So if you're like, well, I don't get that many referrals.

[39:19] Oh, well, you sure do get a whole bunch of people

[39:21] who you get negative referrals.

[39:22] You get negative sales.

[39:23] You have to spend twice as much of a car customer

[39:25] because every other customer that you would have acquired

[39:26] was told by someone else, not the buyer from here.

[39:29] The invisible hand.

[39:30] When you shortcut it, promote, promote, promote, promote, promote,

[39:32] promote, and then flatline, and then dissolve,

[39:36] and then you come up with new shit.

[39:38] And who here are seeing the people in the internet

[39:40] doing this game over and over and over again?

[39:42] They don't get the product right.

[39:44] They put two pieces of, of, of, of,

[39:45] of, of, of, say, much together with a

[39:47] bloney slice in the middle and they call it a product.

[39:49] And then we have him with one slice in the middle

[39:52] and it's still shit because they don't

[39:54] want to take the 12 months to actually get the fucking product

[39:56] right.

[39:58] But on the long game, 10 years from now,

[40:01] the guy who takes the first year takes a break even on that year

[40:04] just to get the product right, makes everything easy.

[40:06] But no one can wait 12 months.

[40:09] Because they can't see the big picture.

[40:11] They keep trying to string three of these little shortcuts

[40:13] together rather than building the foundation.

[40:16] Better is leverage.

[40:17] Better gets you more for what you put in.

[40:21] This is what small businesses look like.

[40:23] This is what big businesses look like.

[40:25] The amount of activities actually not that different.

[40:27] It's just a line.

[40:29] It's just on the same direction.

[40:30] It's all this.

[40:31] It's really not like I promised you.

[40:32] But in both, it's all this.

[40:34] There's nothing.

[40:34] There's no magic.

[40:35] It's just a winding.

[40:37] Same on put, more output.

[40:41] We're boring, but better looks like.

[40:43] It means split testing landing pages not once, but weekly.

[40:46] Not just one time when you come here,

[40:47] you put the process in place to do it every fucking week.

[40:50] Split testing emails, not once, but weekly.

[40:53] Making you ads and creative.

[40:54] Not when you have to, but before you need them.

[40:59] We're all playing with the sales team, not once, but daily.

[41:03] We're all playing with customer success.

[41:05] Hey, I want to refund.

[41:06] Hey, I hated this.

[41:08] Hey, it wasn't fast enough.

[41:09] What did they say?

[41:11] We're all playing.

[41:12] You have amazing customer success.

[41:13] They're all playing every day.

[41:14] We get fucking good.

[41:14] I promise.

[41:16] How exciting is that?

[41:17] Not at all.

[41:19] Not at all.

[41:20] But you know what it does?

[41:21] It makes you more money.

[41:23] Taking 10 more interviews for the same role.

[41:25] Socks.

[41:26] Socks to talk to more people for no reason.

[41:28] But there is a reason, because you're trying to find the one person that's going to give

[41:31] you 10 times the leverage on that time you got back.

[41:35] Think about this.

[41:36] What if you didn't take this interviews?

[41:37] You hire someone wait six months and they have to do the whole thing again.

[41:40] And you lost the six months.

[41:41] That's what Layla was talking about.

[41:44] Taking more time to make your lead magnet better.

[41:47] Make your offer better and better.

[41:48] All these things are boring, but make you more money.

[41:51] And so this is my promise.

[41:53] Is that doing all the un-sixth you shit that you aren't doing?

[41:56] But no you should.

[41:57] Is the secret to the success?

[41:59] My promise is if you do nothing new.

[42:01] But only what you already know you should be doing that your self coach tells you

[42:05] too.

[42:06] You will make more money in the next 12 months than you can imagine.

[42:09] You just got to do it right.

[42:12] So this is actually a text I got yesterday.

[42:14] Or yeah, it was yesterday.

[42:17] This guy had lost everything.

[42:20] And he had set a goal down for himself.

[42:23] And he said, hey, last day at 2021, set a business

[42:26] goal that was quite honestly unrealistic and possible to hit.

[42:30] Well, I'm going to surpass didn't queue three.

[42:33] And so the only thing that I told him to do was to commit to the activities.

[42:36] I was like, just do the same thing every day, Rayner Shine.

[42:39] It was prospect.

[42:40] That was a prospect every day.

[42:42] He's like, and the first few months, he actually had a couple of good months and then

[42:45] he slowed down.

[42:46] He's like, how do I say, how do I say commit?

[42:48] I was like, because you felt successful for fucking getting an outcome.

[42:52] It's irrelevant for who you are.

[42:55] And that's some of you guys have heard this quote, but your work works on you more

[42:57] than you work on it.

[42:58] I was like, you need to become the person who isn't satisfied with whatever that outcome was.

[43:01] But only by the commitment that you made yourself about the activity that you were going to do.

[43:05] And so whether it was up or it was down, it divorces the actions from the outcome,

[43:10] not to say that the outcome is not the work.

[43:12] It is.

[43:13] But in terms of who you are, who you are is forged in the repetitive act.

[43:18] Final point.

[43:21] Who here knows the difference between a seven out of ten book and a nine and a half out of ten book?

[43:28] About 20 times the work.

[43:30] Realistically.

[43:32] Who here knows the difference in sales is when a seven and a half book and a nine and a half book.

[43:38] About a thousand times the sales.

[43:41] And so if you do 20 times the work, you can get a thousand times the effort.

[43:45] That's a 50x increase per unit of input.

[43:49] It's a lot.

[43:50] It's worth it.

[43:51] But you do have to do 20 times for work.

[43:55] That is leverage.

[43:57] An opportunity is missed by most because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.

[44:02] And so I said I was going to cover three things and I have a little thing at the end here.

[44:04] It'll take me less than five.

[44:07] You guys go with that?

[44:08] Alright, sweet.

[44:09] So I said I was going to cover three things.

[44:10] I want to make sure I fill my promise.

[44:12] Number one is how making money really works leverage.

[44:14] Everybody feel good with that?

[44:15] They make sense?

[44:16] Alright.

[44:17] So why making new shit is making you poor and why you have to focus?

[44:23] Number three is why better is leverage.

[44:27] Awesome.

[44:28] And so I want to wrap up my presentation with a quick demonstration of leverage in the real world.

[44:32] Getting more out of the same thing.

[44:34] Okay?

[44:35] So we're going to exercise to wrap this up.

[44:38] And I think that it will do more than anything I could say with these slides.

[44:41] This is probably what you remember.

[44:44] Unfortunately with all my pictures.

[44:46] So I'm going to take a single action and increase the leverage in real time in front of you.

[44:50] That call?

[44:51] So you'll see it before and after in front of your eyes.

[44:54] It's like a real world money magic trick.

[44:55] Okay?

[44:56] So I give you a lot of examples of things you can improve in a business.

[45:00] Better cause, better content, better sales, better website, better follow up, better offers.

[45:03] Right?

[45:04] So what I'm going to do is I'm going to highlight just one of these things.

[45:06] Alright?

[45:07] For you right now, and show you how many riches lie unlocked with your business two

[45:10] day that you already know about.

[45:13] So I'm going to focus on offers because it's easy when I can do it for everyone.

[45:16] Alright?

[45:17] So I'm going to show you the leverage of a better offer.

[45:19] So I'm going to sell you a book for $100,000.

[45:23] Just kidding.

[45:24] $1,000.

[45:26] So the point of leverage is a better offer.

[45:29] Sorry, the point is leverage of a better offer.

[45:32] One action, selling, one product, a book.

[45:34] Leverage is how much money it fetches for the same activity.

[45:36] Does that make sense?

[45:37] Our equation?

[45:38] Does it make sense?

[45:39] Okay.

[45:40] Here are the directions for this activity.

[45:42] The moment you feel that $1,000 value has been created, please stand up and stay standing.

[45:47] Okay?

[45:48] Does this make sense?

[45:49] This is simple directions.

[45:50] If you feel $1,000, then stand and stay standing.

[45:53] Alright?

[45:54] I'm repeating it.

[45:56] $100,000 just kidding.

[45:57] Type up.

[45:58] So, let the leverage building begin.

[46:02] I have 10 books with me today.

[46:05] Who wants one for $1,000?

[46:07] Raise your hand up.

[46:09] Wow?

[46:10] Thank you.

[46:12] Stay standing.

[46:12] Three people.

[46:13] Already at $3,000.

[46:14] Let's look excited.

[46:15] Alright?

[46:16] I didn't even tell you what it was yet.

[46:17] It's a really good book.

[46:19] Probably giving it away.

[46:22] Who now wants it?

[46:23] I said it's a really good book.

[46:25] No more people.

[46:26] Okay.

[46:27] It's a best seller.

[46:30] Still three people.

[46:31] Up, four.

[46:32] There we go.

[46:33] Four people.

[46:34] Ha ha.

[46:35] It's my book.

[46:37] Right?

[46:38] Now I got one more.

[46:40] Two more.

[46:41] Three more.

[46:42] Alright?

[46:43] Four more.

[46:44] So, I got eight nine, ten.

[46:46] 11, I've already accounted for my books, but just wait.

[46:48] There's more.

[46:50] So I said, who wants one of the ten for $1,000?

[46:52] Right?

[46:53] We got all these.

[46:54] Cool.

[46:55] There's all the reviews.

[46:56] People say it's good.

[46:58] Very good rating.

[47:01] Please stay standing.

[47:02] It's also number one, number four, and number seven for the last 13 stray months.

[47:07] Pretty cool, right?

[47:08] In marketing and sales.

[47:09] I think it's pretty dope.

[47:11] That's a nice piece of the book.

[47:12] I'm going to use the book.

[47:13] I'm going to use the book.

[47:14] I'm going to use the book.

[47:15] I'm going to use the book.

[47:17] I'm going to use the book.

[47:19] I'm going to use the book.

[47:21] I'm going to use the book.

[47:23] I'm going to use the book.

[47:25] I'm going to use the book.

[47:27] I'm going to use the book.

[47:29] I'm going to use the book.

[47:31] I'm going to use the book.

[47:33] I'm going to use the book.

[47:35] I'm going to use the book.

[47:37] I'm going to use the book.

[47:39] Oops.

[47:44] I had to get a really fat marker so you could sit.

[47:48] That's actually my embarrassing.

[47:51] No, yeah, no, yeah, no, yeah.

[47:54] You got to stand.

[47:55] You got to keep standing.

[47:56] You got to keep standing.

[47:57] One out of ten.

[47:59] I'll put my personal soft on the inside.

[48:02] A thousand bucks.

[48:15] I'm not going to show it to you.

[48:20] All right.

[48:21] We got about two thirds.

[48:23] Okay.

[48:24] I'm going to review four of your sales calls.

[48:28] I'm going to show you your script with you and drill your sales team on how we set everything up.

[48:33] That work for a thousand bucks.

[48:35] Stand if that's worth it for you with the book.

[48:38] Please stand.

[48:40] I'll have my traffic guy who right now, we get about 20,000 leads a day across our portfolio.

[48:45] I hope to do an entire final breakdown.

[48:47] It's about 11 pages.

[48:48] He'll break down everything that you could do differently within the funnel.

[48:51] Different headlines, split tests, different paragraphs.

[48:54] Different copy things, different images, different layouts.

[48:57] Now we have it way more than two acts, but I feel confident saying we could double your traffic.

[49:01] All right.

[49:02] We're close.

[49:03] We're like 90%.

[49:05] I'll also use my network to recruit the one missing star player that you have in your company.

[49:10] So right now we will look at your company and we will find out with the biggest missing pieces in leverage and put someone in there for you.

[49:17] Stand up with that.

[49:18] That's worth a thousand bucks.

[49:20] I'll also spend two hours with you on the offer that you're giving right now.

[49:25] So you can get more people to click, more people to sign up for the calls, more people to show, more people to buy and at higher prices.

[49:33] All right.

[49:34] I think I got like one person still seated.

[49:36] I got I see you.

[49:37] I see you.

[49:38] I see what I got.

[49:39] I see what I got.

[49:42] I'm also going to feature you on my channel.

[49:44] So that two hours will televised it and we'll distribute it across all of our channels.

[49:48] So right now that gets about 10 million impressions.

[49:50] So in real advertising dollars, it's about a hundred thousand dollars in advertising.

[49:54] Just for in terms of that's what people are willing to pay for three ninety second spots.

[49:58] And it's a thirty minutes spot.

[50:00] So it would be significantly hard in that.

[50:02] So that's worth a thousand bucks.

[50:03] Let me know by standing.

[50:04] Just how you do that.

[50:07] And if you don't make three times what you pay me for this book, I'll give you all the money back and keep all the work that we did.

[50:15] That worked.

[50:16] Measured over twelve months.

[50:17] That's the fine print fair.

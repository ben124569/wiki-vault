[00:00] There are nine things that brilliant sales people do differently.

[00:03] In this video, I'm going to show this stuff that I've learned, building multiple nine figure sales teams,

[00:06] scaling teams from zero to 40 guys, zero to 60 guys, and personally closing over 4,000 sales myself.

[00:11] And so if you boil it down, a sales person has three jobs to do.

[00:14] They have to maximize the number of opportunities they have.

[00:17] They have to convert the highest percentage of those opportunities.

[00:20] And this is the important part, they have to do it consistently for a very long period of time.

[00:24] And so the nine things they do differently will fall elegantly into each of these three buckets.

[00:28] Let's start with the first one, which is maximizing leads or maximizing number of opportunities that a salesman has.

[00:35] So right off the top, I've never seen a salesperson who does the most in a company have the lowest amount of hours work.

[00:42] I've yet to have it. And you know what, maybe there's special stuff like out there,

[00:45] but every company that I've owned and every company that I've looked at,

[00:48] the guy who works the most hours is the one who sells the most deals.

[00:53] And so maximizing opportunities comes in a number of different forms.

[00:56] And number one is that they have the total most hours available per day,

[01:00] because you should be available when the prospect is available.

[01:04] And that means sometimes working long hours, it's sometimes been working weekends.

[01:07] And yes, businesses also pay rent on Sundays, and so you can make sales on Sundays.

[01:11] So my software company Allen scheduled 4,000 plus appointments per day across a number of different industries.

[01:16] And so we got to see all the way from click to close, which companies were selling the most people.

[01:21] And we looked at all the different data.

[01:23] So times of day, number of days per week, you know, speed between text responses, number of characters,

[01:29] and text response, all of these different variables, because I had two data analysts that looked at this to figure out,

[01:33] how could he maximize throughput for any business? And obviously sales have been component of that.

[01:38] And the single greatest lever on throughput across all companies was the number of total available time slots,

[01:46] which means availability was the strongest predictor of total sales.

[01:50] And let me give you a tactical example of this.

[01:53] When Leyla and I were traveling the other day, we went to a different city, and she wanted to get her nails done or something.

[01:59] And so she just pulled up Yelp and looked at the one that had the top reviews, called them up,

[02:03] and said, oh, I'm sorry, we don't do same day appointments.

[02:06] And they're like, we can book you in for two days from now, and she was like, yeah, don't care.

[02:09] Call the next one, same thing, call the third one.

[02:12] And then they were like, yeah, we can take you right now.

[02:14] And boom, she went in.

[02:15] And the thing is, is that both of those other business owners, the first two business owners,

[02:18] that said, no, lost money.

[02:20] And the next time she comes to that place, she'll probably go back to the one that she went to,

[02:23] as long as they did a good job.

[02:25] And so trying to be egotistical about it, rather than accommodate customers, it's like, we're so great.

[02:31] You just lose money.

[02:33] Now, if we maximize the total number of times that's available for the salesperson to sell,

[02:38] then the next part of maximizing your opportunities is getting as much of their days,

[02:42] she'm only possible, filled with the best opportunities.

[02:45] And so the second subunit of this is, they will pull up calls.

[02:51] And so the first thing is, if you see a call that gets booked, or you book a call that's on Thursday

[02:55] in today's Monday, if you have a time slot that's open, you grab your Thursday appointment,

[03:00] you drag it into today because today appointments always have higher shop rates.

[03:03] And if you pull it up, then they're even more interested, and you can close even higher.

[03:07] And you can have two or three calls by that same Thursday times you increase your sales velocity.

[03:12] Now, a core layer to that is, if you look at your calendar and you've reached out to a prospect,

[03:16] and that person has not responded back.

[03:18] And now it's the same day and they're coming up in a few hours.

[03:20] Well, what do you do? Well, the best salespeople pull that timeslot and say, hey,

[03:25] sorry, I didn't see that you confirmed, why don't we do the same thing for tomorrow?

[03:28] You can push it out one, and then try and fill that time slot with somebody who is responsive,

[03:32] even if they're later in the week. And that increases your total number of calls per day.

[03:37] And so fundamentally, the perfect day for a salesperson is that they have call,

[03:41] back to back to back to back to back, with the best possible leads that are the hottest that day.

[03:46] I learned that little tag to go out pulling up because we had one of our companies,

[03:49] it was in solar sales, and they had one rep that massively outperformed everyone else.

[03:54] And I was like, what does this guy doing? And so what he was doing was he would, whenever a new

[03:58] appointment would book, he would immediately call the appointment to qualify the lead,

[04:02] because that checks two boxes. One is he says, okay, is this person qualified to buy?

[04:05] If the person was, he had two decision paths. If they had the time right then,

[04:09] he would just go straight into closing, because he was in off the call SAP, and then by getting in contact

[04:14] with the lead, became on the call in terms of his SAP. And if they said they had time right now,

[04:18] he just went for the sale. That maximizes his time on call. If they said no, then the reason for his call

[04:24] was that he had an opening leader that day that he was trying to fill up. And so he either takes

[04:28] the moment now that he's working the lead in terms into a sales call, or he's filled another

[04:32] slot later in the day, and turns that into a sales call. Both of those things maximized the number of

[04:36] sales that guy was having. And this guy was selling like four times more units than the second

[04:40] best guy on the team. And then they obviously saw this and then adopted it company wide. And then of

[04:44] course, I saw it and adopted it across all my entire portfolio. And let me double down a why that's so

[04:49] powerful. Because not only does the salesman have two opportunities to sell. Now or later that day,

[04:54] he also opens up the slot later in the week for availability for another customer that can't

[04:59] make it today to book that time then. Because what I have found and we saw this with the software

[05:04] was if you have fewer time slots, people may still book with you, but they're not booking at the

[05:08] most convenient time for them. You'll see scedurates, but then show rates will drop because it's not the

[05:13] time that works for them ideally. And so you want to make it the most accommodating. So it's not just

[05:18] art, is it convenient or inconvenient? It's how convenient is it? If I have a tight deadline and a hard

[05:23] stop and I've got something that I'm stressed about afterwards, I might be able to schedule a call then,

[05:27] but I might not be in a in the mood to buy. But if I say, you know what, Sunday afternoon, I'm free,

[05:32] I'll have all the time I wrote. I'm going to have zero urgency to get off the call. I'll listen to you

[05:37] and I'll be in a completely different zone. And that might be when I'm in receiving hands in terms of

[05:41] prospect, rain mode for buying. And so one of the things that the best salespeople have and this is

[05:48] something that companies should provide, but often don't, is that you have two SOPs, meaning

[05:53] standard operating procedures. You have an on the call SOP, which is what you say when you're talking

[05:57] to prospects and they have an off the call SOP, which is what you do in between. The vast majority

[06:02] companies don't have an off the call SOP and they're losing tons and tons of money because they just

[06:07] say, yeah, just work the leads in the meantime. When the total amount of output that a salesman

[06:12] has is so correlated with the amount of opportunities they have and they get those opportunities

[06:16] by the time they have when they're not on the call. And so they should have two separate checklists

[06:21] if they don't have them in front of them and this is what the best salespeople do is this is what I'm

[06:24] doing when I'm on and this is what I'm doing when I'm off and you can just switch hats as soon as

[06:28] you're off and you start at the top and you're like, I'm falling off this person, I'm falling

[06:32] with this person, I'm dragging this person forward, I'm canceling this appointment and they have high

[06:36] activity. One of the things that we do across all companies and I learn this acronym for my

[06:43] French Iran, Bamfam, which is book a meeting from a meeting, which is that the best salespeople

[06:47] never finish a call with a prospect, not knowing when the next time they're going to talk to the

[06:52] prospect. So that prospect should never fall into no man's language, never fall between the cracks where

[06:55] they're like, I don't know. And so if you get to the end of the call and they're like, yeah,

[06:58] let's connect offline and we'll circle back up and we'll find another time. No, you have to

[07:03] address it at that time because if for whatever reason, like a time obstacle is still an obstacle and

[07:08] you can resolve it right then, you both have your calendars up, you can both make the decision.

[07:11] If someone's like, well, I'm not sure, then you actually address the concern like, isn't this a

[07:15] problem for you? How much you're losing every day not implementing the solution in your business?

[07:19] How much, like, how much of a problem is this in your life? And why isn't it this

[07:22] something that we'd be doing sooner, right? And so you want to address those things because that

[07:26] these are obstacles. And so if you just get off the call jolly, then you actually lose more sales.

[07:31] So you always book a meeting from the meeting. Here's three more things that the best salespeople

[07:35] will do. Number one is that they don't take rejection personally because they're going to reach out

[07:40] in more volume than the mediocre salespeople. And so you can see on a CRM, how many outreach attempts

[07:46] and how many follow-up attempts that a salesperson is having between calls and it correlates

[07:52] with the number of calls that they take. And so they work their leads harder. And that's because

[07:57] if someone before they've scheduled the call, you know, says something mean they're not like,

[08:01] oh my gosh, I can't believe this. Or if someone knows shows they're not like, well, I'm not

[08:04] going to work the rest of my leads. No one really cares about me. Like, whoa, it's me. It's

[08:08] now they know it's a numbers game and they just keep plowing. Something that I've noticed,

[08:11] the best salespeople do is they have something called a kill list. And so those are those prospects

[08:16] that you're like, this is a way, or this is a really good prospect. And they, they sure they have

[08:21] in the CRM. Sure, they have them in the place that they're supposed to have them. But they also have

[08:24] it somewhere else that's visible. So they can always think about it. And like, that's like an

[08:28] everyday list. It's like, I got to get back to these two guys. I got to make sure that these ones

[08:33] I'm going to put extra attention to because they're high value deals. Now the last element of what

[08:38] the best salespeople do for increasing their number of leads is that they create their own opportunities.

[08:43] So sure, they're going to get the inbound leads from marketing. They're going to get the people,

[08:47] you know, the leads that are headed to them. But the best salespeople know the value of referrals.

[08:54] And so the way they do that is at the end of the call or at the time that it makes sense,

[08:57] they say, hey, do you know anybody else or my favorite way of passing is who do you know?

[09:02] Because it forces the prospect to answer the question with a not yes no, but with a name. You say,

[09:07] who do you know who is as awesome as you now it's a compliment? Who would also benefit from this?

[09:11] So now I'm giving them a compliment by by by asking them for the referrals. I kind of like have a

[09:17] like a nice guy sandwich there. So like you're amazing. Who else do you know who's like you

[09:20] who would love to do this with you or with us who could benefit from XYZ? Right? Now sometimes if they say no one,

[09:26] then sometimes like this is where rapport is important. But you could say something like, why do you hate me so much?

[09:32] And they're like, what do you mean? It's like, why is only can assume that you hate us because you don't want

[09:35] anybody else to know about this amazing thing? And you probably hate your friends because you want them to

[09:40] suffer as well. Right? And if it's because you don't believe me, then let's talk about that. But

[09:45] otherwise, like why are we not getting your friends in here? Because I can promise you you'll be far more

[09:48] successful if you have more people you know who are in it. So in the spirit of Bamfam book and meeting from

[09:53] meeting, if we consider this to be a meeting, if you would like us to help you more with your sales process,

[09:57] acquisition.com just started a workshop division where my sales director, my team will talk to you specifically

[10:03] about your sales, your process, your scripting so we can implement some of the things that we know

[10:07] working on portfolio into your business, ASAP. Would you other stuff for the workshop? But we also talk

[10:11] about sales. If that's that's it, I'll interesting. You could book your next meeting. But I

[10:14] could not go to the school button and follow the steps. And if you're qualified, my Gossal Richard.

[10:21] When I had a team, a different portfolio company, we had one guy who was outperforming everyone

[10:25] else by a huge margin. This one wasn't as big as the pull-up thing. That was massive. This was about

[10:30] 50% higher than the number two guy. And we were like, what is this guy doing? He was brand new. And

[10:34] that was what was interesting. It's like brand new going to the top leaderboards, not very common.

[10:38] Because that means that they're doing a different process. And so he was following the script and we

[10:43] listened to the calls and we were like, this is the same call. And so we called him up and said, what are you doing

[10:46] differently? And the thing is he was multiplying his leads. And so what he did was at the end of the

[10:51] calls, he was just asking who they knew, who would also benefit from this thing. And I think they were

[10:55] they were selling some sort of tickets of some sort. And so he was saying, who else wants to come with you?

[11:01] Who else would you like to bring? And it's just a simple little thing that he was doing. But by doing that,

[11:07] he was increasing his sales by 50%. Because the referrals, even though only one out of three or one out of four

[11:13] people would refer, the referral close rates like 80 or 90%. And so if you think, okay, I take, you know,

[11:20] four calls and I close one and I ask for referrals and all four and only one of them gives me a referral.

[11:26] But then that referral then closes that I take my one sale out of four and turn it to two out of five.

[11:32] If you're a business owner thinking about how valuable just implementing that is consistently,

[11:37] is that your cost to a car customer, you just, you cut in half by taking one customer and getting

[11:42] a referral from that customer. And if one out of three customers refers someone, then you cut your cost

[11:46] to a car customer by a third. And this is the type of stuff that's advertising becomes more expensive.

[11:51] Because it always will become more expensive that the businesses that do this, the salesman that do this,

[11:55] will be the ones that win in the future. So now we have a salesman who has the maximum number of

[12:00] hours, the maximum number of days, they're pulling up appointments so that their time on call

[12:05] closing with the best people is maximize their following up before the following up after

[12:09] they're doing personalized reachouts and saying, hey, voice memo, hey, I've got this thing for you

[12:15] that I've got set up for the call. What size shirt do you want? I've said a side thing here. There's

[12:21] one things we did at the gym. Hey, what color shirt do you want? Hey, what boxing gloves? Hey,

[12:25] what you do? A tiny little thing. Hey, I've got three gift cards here. I go one for Amazon,

[12:29] one for Starbucks and one for whatever. Which one do you prefer? You ask a preference question prior

[12:34] to the call and more people show. Because the thing is, is you're like, well, shoot. This guy's

[12:39] doing this thing, the least I can do is show up. And so they're maximizing the number of scheduled

[12:43] appointments. They're maximizing the number of shows. They're maximizing the number of opportunities.

[12:48] They're getting from those opportunities. And now we get to the call. So now we got to close.

[12:55] Understand the value of preparation. You would be amazed at how much of a genius you sound like

[13:02] if you just do five minutes of research before call. And so my rule of thumb for research is that

[13:07] if it's something that you do all the time, it's about 10% of the time that you're going to be on

[13:12] a call or meeting that you can do in prep. So if you have a two hour call, then you've got 12 minutes

[13:17] of prep. If you've got a 60 minute call, then you do six minutes of prep. Now this is something

[13:21] that if you do it all the time. If this is like I'm doing a quarterly meeting, then it reverses.

[13:25] It's like six hours of prep for one hour of presentation. If it's something that you don't do often.

[13:30] And so salespeople do the same call over and over again. But the thing that's different,

[13:33] the tiny bit of difference is the prospect they're speaking with. And so like this applies to

[13:38] everything. Like if you're picking a girl up at her house, if you do five seconds of research

[13:42] in the car before you go in and you look at what her dad does and look at the company of the

[13:45] father and say, hey, so Mr. Sun, so it's really nice to meet you. So I see you work at

[13:49] whatever engineering. Like do you like that stuff? I see that they just had a

[13:52] oppressor who's coming out. Do you have any involvement in that? This guy would immediately see

[13:56] you no matter how you're dressed, what you look like is it's a check. They're like, whoa,

[14:01] like I will respect this person because he did me the honor of actually taking some time

[14:07] to look me up and figure out more about my business. He didn't show up like everybody else does

[14:12] not knowing which way is Sun Day. Trying to figure things out as they go. I'm telling you

[14:17] the best salespeople take those five minutes. They do that tiny bit of research and the amount

[14:22] of rapport that you build in that first one minute from having those secrets. The person is

[14:29] then like, oh, wow, they know about me. Think about what it takes to close someone. No like and trust.

[14:35] Well, all of a sudden, you feel known because they did it. You like people who know more about you

[14:41] and what else do you do? You trust people who know more about you because you approximate friendship,

[14:47] you approximate a relationship and you do and you get to do a ton of that at the first second

[14:52] of the call rather than taking the five first minutes the call to show that you don't know what you're

[14:56] doing. Right as I started selling Jim owners rather than weight loss when I was selling my turnaround

[15:00] business, I started getting leads but I didn't have any like methodology. So like I had a webinar,

[15:06] I didn't work and so I just started finding people on Google using their emails. And so I'd find

[15:11] their social profiles and I'd let it have to piece together like a profile who this person was because

[15:15] the only thing I was collecting was an email for this webinar. And so I'd find like three or four

[15:19] social profiles and then I would connect with them and I would do some research so that I could

[15:23] make my reach out and not look sketchy as hell. And so when I would do my reach out that I would

[15:28] have all this data that I put as I'm just like a little profile together about them and so when I

[15:33] hopped on the phone, they were like, whoa, like you know a lot about my Jim and I was like, well,

[15:38] yeah and I saw that because I look at the images and like so I saw your square footage layout.

[15:42] I think if you move this here, this might actually be able to allow you to double the amount of

[15:46] usable square footage that you have for the sessions and that would help me sell more people into

[15:50] your Jim. So I don't know if you're open to something like that. But now I'm coming with like,

[15:53] I see the problem. I also have the solutions because I thought about it before we got on the phone.

[15:57] Because I don't want to waste your time trying to figure things out. Now I want to figure them

[16:00] up before I can come with you with solutions. And this is when I started now so I didn't have a reputation yet.

[16:04] So I had to build the reputation by showing up and providing more value than other people were ahead of

[16:10] time. And this is where like if you're new and you're coming into a space, you win through prep.

[16:14] Like the big guys have the reputation, the small guys win through preparation.

[16:22] The best salespeople take notes. This is one of those things that is just like prep, but it

[16:27] preps you for the next call. And so you do your public preparation with what you can find and

[16:33] observe. You do your second call preparation with what you find out on the phone. And I'm telling you,

[16:38] if you hop on the phone, it's, oh yeah. So you've got your daughter, Sarah, and Jessica, and they're at

[16:42] you know, Colorado and they're finishing up. And you've got X, Y, and Z happening in the business.

[16:47] Is that correct? Okay, cool. Just make a trick. Just read over some of the past notes.

[16:50] I forgot, got on the call. They're like, oh wow. I don't have to resale my whole life story again.

[16:55] This guy, now when this guy makes recommendations, I assume he does it within the context of my

[16:59] business. Because one of the big things when you are selling something is that people want to make

[17:03] sure that it not only that it works, but it's going to work for them. And so you can address that

[17:09] concern before it ever comes up by proving that your recommendations are contextual. This is also

[17:15] what switches you're from being a salesman to consultant. This is what switches you from somebody

[17:19] who's just trying to close to somebody who's trying to help. The most brilliant salespeople

[17:26] listen more than they talk. And this is one that people get wrong all the time. Is that they

[17:31] see super talkative people? I mean, moms in high school like you should get into sales because you don't

[17:35] shut up. No, that's not always the case. That's what, that's what bad salespeople look like.

[17:41] And unfortunately, the thing is is the best salespeople don't come off as salespeople. They just close.

[17:48] And so people don't feel sold. They feel like they bought. And so everybody buy stuff every day,

[17:56] all the time. And they're buying from companies that have salespeople and they don't know it.

[18:01] So when you go to a restaurant and they ask you if you want to zurt, that's a sale. They get

[18:04] commissions on those things. And if they do it in a weird way, you're like, I don't want to be sold.

[18:09] If they do in a great way, you're like, oh, I'm so glad that person made that recommendation.

[18:12] And so you never felt like you got sold. You felt like you bought. And so the problem is that the

[18:16] reputation of salespeople is terrible because you only remember the bad ones. We actually did this

[18:20] big study because we have a huge amount of sales calls that we can look at across the whole

[18:23] portfolio. And we use software that analyzes the calls with AI and all that stuff. We can see what's

[18:27] talk time versus listen time. And the best salespeople listen twice as much as they talk. And so the

[18:32] little isms that I have for this is that the person is answering the questions is the one getting

[18:37] interrogated. You don't want to be the one getting interrogated. And whenever you answer questions,

[18:41] you give the other person something to attack. And so you want them to be answering so that you

[18:47] have things that you can pick apart and move around. If you're the one answering questions,

[18:51] then you're the one who's getting picked apart and has things that they can disagree with.

[18:55] I want to be like smoke, right? They can't catch anything that I say. And so if someone says,

[19:00] you know, hey, well, tell me what makes you better than your competition. I be like, well,

[19:04] what things you're looking for. Right back to them. It's like it's like,

[19:08] hoppitate. It's like, right back to you. Well, I would want this, this and this and this. I'm like,

[19:13] why are those things important to you? Right back to you. Right? Like I can do this all day. Right?

[19:18] Like I can not answer because the thing is is that they believe nothing that you say. They believe

[19:22] everything that they say. And so I need them to say that it's a good idea, not me. When I started

[19:27] selling weight loss, I realized really quickly that I had an agenda of what I wanted to tell people

[19:32] they needed to do. And I realized that I didn't have time in 15 minutes to reeducate someone. They're

[19:38] the last 10 years of life of all the experiences good and bad that they had prior to me. What I

[19:44] needed to do in that moment was get them to buy. And then I could spend the rest of my time trying

[19:47] to do the real education stuff. And so I wanted to simply align with where they were coming from

[19:53] to get them to make the sale. And so that was why I started asking, what have you done before?

[19:59] What did you like? What did you not like? Rather than picking apart the things they did.

[20:03] And then then like, I actually really like that about that other thing. Lost the sale.

[20:07] Only takes a few times of doing that to be like, I'm going to shut the fuck up and just let them tell

[20:11] me what they liked. And then I'll say we're like that and not like that. And so the whole concept here

[20:16] is you want to educate the prospect so that they can come to their own conclusion. And so the only

[20:22] gaps that you're filling is hard information. And I only give that information after already notes the

[20:28] right answer. And so just like lawyers don't ask questions when they're on the stand that they don't

[20:33] already know the answers to. She never asked for the sale unless you already know they're going to buy.

[20:38] And so there are times and this is where patterned recognitions help for sales people. This is what the

[20:42] brilliant sales people do is that if they're like, I don't think he's ready there. I don't think he's ready yet.

[20:46] And just like you don't, you don't go for the kill. You just ask more questions like I feel some

[20:50] hesitation. Like what are your main concerns right now? Like I'm feeling some hesitation around price.

[20:54] Talk to me about that. There's two ways by the way if you're weirded out about asking questions

[20:58] is that you can both give commands or ask questions. And so you can change the cadence up in the

[21:04] script by saying, so instead of saying for example, hey, how's it going? It's an easy first thing.

[21:08] A lot of people say on the first thing they call. But if I say, tell me about your day, it's a very

[21:12] different thing because it people have automatic responses to questions they hear all the time.

[21:18] And so if you want to break a pattern with somebody and then get them more present, you say, tell me about your

[21:22] day. And then like, oh, I mean, it was good. I had a cup of costs before this and you're like,

[21:27] oh, that's fantastic. Is that related to this thing? Because I looked up on the whole

[21:30] bit different perspective on that salesperson in the first 30 seconds. Right. So they listen more

[21:35] than they talk. They are like smoke. You only answer questions with questions, unless you already

[21:42] know that the statement that you're going to say is in alignment with what you know the person wants.

[21:47] And so if they're like, tell me why you're different, then I'd be like, well, what if you

[21:51] done in the past? Because then it'll give me more context so I can help explain it. Now they're going

[21:55] to say all these things. I'd be like, what did you like about that? What did you not like about that?

[21:59] And so when I get to the point where I actually have to say what are things about, I'm going to

[22:02] highlight all the things they like about the other stuff and I'm going to not highlight the things

[22:05] they didn't like about the other stuff. And all of a sudden, I'm like, this is perfect. I'm like, what

[22:08] do you know? I just asked you the questions the things you wanted and as long as they are the things that

[22:12] we can actually provide, I highlighted those features about our thing because already know which

[22:17] piano keys to play because you told me. They breathe the scripts. And so the reason I use that is

[22:24] because that is the best description I can give is that they can, they can say it without thinking,

[22:30] just like you breathe without thinking, they can say the script without thinking. Because you can't

[22:34] listen to a prospect if you're waiting to talk because you're trying to remember what you're

[22:38] going to say next. You need to know all of the scripts like the Bible or like something that you've

[22:43] memorized in the past so that you can be 100% present with the prospect and listening. And so my

[22:50] favorite is him around this is again. And the first time I learned this was I saw an exceptional

[22:56] sales trainer training a rep and he was just drilling them on the opening 30 seconds of the script.

[23:03] And so they did the script and I was watching him, listening to them, while giving them visual cues.

[23:09] And so this was a huge advancement in terms of my understanding of selling happened because before

[23:14] this I knew how to sell but I couldn't transfer the skill. But this guy was sitting there and he was like,

[23:18] yep, yep, pause harder on this word. Do it again. Nice. Do it again. Nice. One more time.

[23:27] Nice. Keep going. And so he would get them to drill it three times in a row the right way after

[23:32] making the correction and then he would keep going in the script. And so the point was is that if you're

[23:37] a salesperson you need to be able to do it again and again and again because the word

[23:44] decision matters a lot. You don't want to be one of these salespeople that takes 100 words to say

[23:49] something you could say in five. It'll also make your sales way longer. So again the best sales

[23:54] person can take more calls because they shorten the call required. A mediocre salesperson will

[24:00] do the script in the beginning and it'll close and they will have coughed right before they

[24:04] ask for the close and then the person closes and so they get reinforcement for coughing. And so

[24:09] the next sales call they take they add a cough in and whether that person closes is not they're like,

[24:14] well it worked on that other one. And so all of a sudden they add coughing in right before they close.

[24:18] Now the next time on the time that they close let's say on their fourth call after this they also

[24:23] added a second question in before the close. So they add the second question in and then you see where

[24:27] this happens is that they cough and add a second question to every single call that they do. And by

[24:32] doing this over time the length of the script and the length of the things that salespeople do continues

[24:37] to expand because they get positive reinforcement but the reality is that that person might have

[24:41] just been willing to buy no matter what. And so the script gets longer and longer even though it

[24:44] might not have nothing to do with what was required to close. And so you want to be as concise as

[24:50] seemingly possible. This is what the best salespeople do in order to close the most sales per day

[24:56] per unit of time because the less time you're on the phone after you make the sale the more time you

[24:59] have to fill your calendar back up and close more deals. And so the three tactics this is the sales

[25:03] managers is that you rehearse the script every morning they do roll plays meaning let's pretend

[25:10] like our prospect like you got up you got to get over whatever your weirdness is with role playing like

[25:14] I don't know what it is but so many managers like don't want to roll play like get over yourself

[25:20] you have to roll play in order for them to get good. And when you do the role playing you work on

[25:25] one specific part of the script because if you're doing every morning you're going to be able to work

[25:29] for things pretty quickly. But you're like today we're just going to focus on the intro. Today we're

[25:33] just going to focus on the clothes. Today I just want you to focus on how we're overcoming

[25:37] spouse overcomes. I want you to overcome I have to think about it issues I want you to give me two

[25:41] or three bangs in a row to overcome that obstacle because you seem to be struggling with it right and

[25:46] so by and you just keep hitting it again and again and again so that when it comes up they just

[25:51] breathe it out rather than thinking about it also because no one can improve multiple things at the same

[25:56] time. So when you say hey there's nine things you did wrong one it's incredibly discouraging second

[26:00] they can't improve any of them and so if you look at any good skills coach whether it's a basketball

[26:04] coach or it's a painting coach or a sales coach they work they might see you have a hundred things

[26:08] wrong with your game they're just going to focus on one at a time until they clean them all up and

[26:13] then all of a sudden you become an exceptional sales person. So I said I had nine but I've way more

[26:16] than nine so enjoy so here's number ten they kills zombies up front now that's the term that we use

[26:24] internally you can say diffuse the bomb which is one that I did earlier in my careers what I used to say

[26:28] but I'm Middle Eastern so you know we had to change that the formal definition that I use is you've

[26:32] got obstacles and you've got objections and obstacle occurs before you've mentioned the price and so

[26:36] if someone says for example you know I have a special snowflake thyroid issue right and you're

[26:42] trying to say like you need to do this thing to lose weight you know that that's going to

[26:44] blow up on you in the sale so you have to address it in front and it's much easier to address things

[26:50] before you ask for money than after if you do it after it's called an objection all right so I say

[26:55] obstacles are upfront you want to avoid a move around right I mean you have to crush through them

[26:59] realistically but you get through those and then objections you have to handle but now that the time

[27:04] is ticking on the bomb like now you have a short period of time before it blows up on you right

[27:09] or the zombies about to bite you whatever analogy you want spouse for example or decision

[27:14] maker or I'm not going to have time to do this thing or there's elements of this you know program

[27:19] or implementation that aren't a fit for me you want to address all that stuff up front so that you've

[27:23] handled everything before the stakes get lifted when you mentioned price and then you go for the close

[27:29] and the obstacles and objections that you handle are always the same and so they're going to

[27:33] bubble up to three main things one is going to be circumstances so circumstances need time it's going to be

[27:39] money it's going to be things about this specific program or implementation those are all

[27:44] circumstances those are outside the next is going to be other people that's going to be my wife my

[27:48] employees my kid my some my business partner somebody else has decision making authority and the

[27:54] third is going to be myself somebody who themselves doubts that they can do it or that they will be

[27:59] successful or that it's the way they want it to be done the good news is that most of the time

[28:05] when you're diffusing these bombs they start with the outside because time money fit is what I like to

[28:11] call it are things that are really easy to cast blame to and it's almost it's a it's a response

[28:16] right it's like they don't have to think about like I don't I don't the money I don't I don't

[28:19] the card I want like I don't have the you know whatever if they talked about an authority figure

[28:23] then it means that like I would do it but this person's in the way and so now you're one step closer

[28:29] to the decision maker once you handle that if you have somebody who says I need to think about it

[28:34] that's actually great because I mean you're already two layers of the onion deeper to just like

[28:38] you're talking to somebody who's in power who can make the decision great now you just have to help

[28:42] help them make the decision and so you should know all of the key fundamentals of how to overcome these

[28:48] now you can memorize each of them which I highly recommend but I think it's also good to understand

[28:52] the fundamentals and so this is what the best salespeople do is that they have key stories

[29:00] or metaphors to break the belief that the person has around that obstacle so for example

[29:07] if someone says hey I can't decide today because you know my husband and I make all of our decisions

[29:12] together right now this depends on the nature of your sale if you're in a transactional sale

[29:17] and I would say like a consumer based sale that's under a thousand bucks maybe two thousand bucks

[29:21] usually you have to do that right there if you have like a B to B sale that's going to be a

[29:27] multi you know multi call sale then you might have to bring in stakeholders and so this is one of the

[29:32] nuances that depends on the thing you're selling in the price point but the way that the best sales

[29:37] people do this is that you play out something in the past and you play it out in the future okay

[29:41] so with the decision maker you'd say hey so let me tell you about this girl Susan she was just like

[29:46] you and she actually had the same issue come up which she was like I don't do anything without

[29:51] the consent of my husband and you know what happened she walked out her husband said I don't want

[29:56] you spend the money I actually saw her a few years later and when I talked to her I said hey

[30:01] so how's how's things going with the you know the fitness stuff she was like oh they're they're not

[30:06] and I was like oh why she was like well my husband never lets me do anything and I was like oh geez

[30:11] that's got to be kind of rough and she was like yeah it sucks and so the thing is is that if you play it

[30:17] out into the future like you're gonna end up resending that person because they're not letting you do what you want

[30:22] and so I think what you're asking for is permission when you really need support that's how you how you

[30:26] like you go from past to future right and so then you can play it out with this person so so let's

[30:31] play it out five years so over the last five years you've gained five pounds a year so you're 25 pounds

[30:35] heavier so five years from now if you're 25 pounds heavier than you are right now they're like oh my god

[30:40] if I'm 25 pounds heavier than I am I only but that's just the track you're on and so let's play it out

[30:44] like what if they say no and so sometimes they're like well then I would do it anyways then you're like

[30:50] awesome let's sign up now one out of three times that's actually what happened which is crazy I still

[30:54] been blown away by that but then the two out of three times then I go you want permission not support now

[30:59] if you're looking at time or money for example then you say hey we need we need resourcefulness

[31:05] not resources so it's like you have your little isms that you can remember if it's time then it's

[31:10] well is it a seasonal thing because if a seasonal thing means you're busy right now and you might be

[31:15] you know less busy later that assumes that you'll never be busy again and so do you want the

[31:20] thing to be long lasting the simple mutation or do you want it to be just like only for the time

[31:23] that you're not busy and then you fall again when you get busy well sure I want it to last forever it's

[31:28] like okay well then you should probably start when you're busy because that's what I'm going to be

[31:30] giving you the most support is now so that when you get to the the free time it'll be easy

[31:34] coasting and when you get busy again you know how to stick with it because you had the support right

[31:38] and so again it's like you have to be able to dismantle these things as you understand

[31:42] all of these there's a fundamental underlying fallacy of giving away power to something else

[31:48] because people don't want to make mistakes they don't want to fail and so they come up with

[31:52] all of these excuses they come up with time they say like that's the seasonal thing you can have

[31:57] time in terms of the micro which is I don't have time in my day I'm like well you're here so

[32:02] when were you imagining this is why you do this up front when were you imagining how much time can

[32:06] you dedicate to this implementation to this SEO agency to this wheel of smart whatever it is right

[32:11] if you ask that up front then if they say oh I don't have time with it then you say well what

[32:16] change between then and now just so I have understanding did I ask the question in a weird way

[32:22] that made you like not understand it and again this is where tone matters lock is now here in

[32:26] the red zone right now it's like the bomb's way more sensitive because the the the the time ticker's going

[32:31] and so we want to be actually this is where rapport is so important in the beginning because I'll

[32:37] add this in this is a bonus one I call the ghetto tone okay and I learned this from Sam back to

[32:42] you are so he had a personal training business and that's why I shadowed underneath when I got into

[32:47] fitness he let me just work for him for minimum wage and so I learned how to gym this is work anyways

[32:52] I saw him have this you know rich white lady doesn't put her weights back right and he was still

[32:57] training at the time like he was training sessions a little bit and so he was like girl he's like

[33:03] I know you ain't about to leave my gym without putting your weights back and he's a person do

[33:07] right but he would get into this kind of like ghetto like whatever you want to call it way of talking

[33:13] and she'd be like fine I'll go put him back and I thought about that and I was like man if I just

[33:20] been like hey Susan can you put your weights back oh like she's like I pay for personal training

[33:27] you can put my weights back like that could get really bad really fast but when you say it like that

[33:32] all of a sudden it's like I'm communicating the same thing and I get the desired result and they

[33:36] think it's fun and lighthearted and so in the same sense when you're in the clothes I use it

[33:41] ton of humor and that tonality to diffuse hard conversations so I say like girl I was like five minutes

[33:50] ago it's like you had four hours a week I was like what happened my four hours if I say that no

[33:55] it's gonna be upset with me if you're like well I mean I didn't know that it was gonna be

[33:59] x y and then I'd be like fine I know I'm like so then then tone switch and you're like what's

[34:06] really going on and then you get the real stuff because guess what closeers asked hard questions

[34:17] right and they're the questions it's the place where you don't want to go where's where you need to go

[34:21] which is you want them to diffuse the bomb in front of you not when they get home right and so

[34:26] you don't want them to sit with the decision you want them to confront it's like you might be wondering

[34:30] this is a lot of money let's talk about it right you might be wondering if your husband's

[34:33] gonna be against it well let's talk about some reasons that he might not be against it let's talk

[34:37] about what your business partner will say if you buy this without their permission let's talk about

[34:42] that right and so you want to confront those ugly thing you don't want it because like you're not

[34:47] like if I if you take anything from this the best salespeople want to confront it because they're

[34:53] better at selling them than they are at selling themselves so you want them to confront the

[34:57] obstacle in front of you so that you can help them through it so don't wait for like you're not

[35:02] gonna avoid it I promise you you think you're avoiding the land mind but like oh because sometimes

[35:06] you hear that thing in the beginning of the call and you're like oh that's a bit I don't know if I

[35:10] want to blow the cut dude it's gonna blow up in the clothes if you can't even can't even

[35:13] confront it before we've mentioned prices definitely coming up after you mentioned price so like

[35:17] confront it now so one of my favorite ways to get to the hard question is asking what do you

[35:22] afraid of happening and then I follow that with let's just play it out a lot of times it's like

[35:28] people don't even want to look at what's gonna happen it's like no let's play it out right like

[35:33] I remember I had this this sale that happened where I'd a lady who was like I followed Dave Ramsey

[35:38] and I have envelopes of cash and if I give you this envelope that's my grocery money for the week

[35:45] if I do this program and I was like okay well what are you afraid of and she like pause and

[35:52] I was like is it that you won't be able to afford food that's like would you be afraid of that

[35:57] and she was like well yeah because she thought she was gonna win the sale that was a trap

[36:01] and I was like but you're trying to lose weight I was like worst case scenario you don't

[36:04] afford food you'll lose some weight I was like win win now I did that with a good tone so she got

[36:08] a laugh out of it right and I was like but let's be real I was like if you've ever bought anything

[36:12] in the past that you weren't sure you could afford I was like and where you now you still survive

[36:16] you're not on the couch right I was like we always make it working in right and you have to

[36:21] the cuts from girls I was like this is something that's gonna last week's forever like you have

[36:24] all these clothes I was like you want to make all of them look better in six weeks I was like just

[36:28] lose 20 pounds what are you afraid of let's play it out best case worst case when you do that you can

[36:33] basically take away the emotion from the decision and say okay worst case scenario you're on your

[36:38] friends couch and you know what you were poor before this and you were happy then too so worst case

[36:42] scenario is you're in the same position you've been in before and it was fine best case scenario you

[36:45] change your life forever so that's like a bet you're willing to take right and so if you if you just

[36:53] you want to confront it and then walk into what they're afraid of and just say let's play it out

[36:58] so this happens here this happens here best case worst case and I can tell you that I probably

[37:03] close more sales on best case worst case than any other clothes I have.

[37:09] Ask for the sale again and so this is a big one if you do not ask for the sale you will not get it

[37:13] that is a promise once you ask if you ask again you increase likely that they buy now there's a

[37:18] right way to do this in a wrong way to do this if you just ask again when someone says no bad luck

[37:24] if someone says no and you ask why and then you resolve the why then you ask again and that makes sense

[37:31] says hey I can't make Tuesdays and you say no worries if we're able to do it on Thursday with

[37:36] that work for you and they say yes they say awesome so you want to move forward you ask again

[37:40] right so all you're doing is resolving the concern there's terms in the industry called looping or

[37:46] obstacle over comes whatever whatever wording you want to use is that you resolve the concern

[37:51] and you ask again and you can do this literally unlimited times as long as you resolve the concern

[37:56] and then you ask again I mean lay a little tell you that like if it was either a Sunday sale

[38:00] because I usually had way less calls on Sundays or it was the last appointment of the day for

[38:05] me she just knew that I would always close that sale because I would just have unlimited time

[38:11] because I was like I will just keep going and so I will ask again and again and again and I had

[38:16] I had a partner back in the day I don't know if I like the visual but he's like he's like you're

[38:20] like a pitbull on someone's ankle he's like you just will not fucking let them leave and I was like

[38:24] it's because I think I think they need it they came in because they're trying to lose weight we

[38:27] sell weight loss what's the problem like we just have to figure it out and it usually just like

[38:32] it's mounds of stuff you have to unpile of all these excuses of all the times that they've been

[38:37] unsuccessful in their lives it's like they came in because they want to solve the problem and when

[38:41] then they can confund it with the decision they get freaked out again because they really have this

[38:45] past traumas of the things they've tried and then feeling like a failure and then they associate that

[38:49] failure with you in the moment you're like hey so is it calm down we're just going to have

[38:52] you eat some fucking chicken and walk a little bit it's going to be okay and so the best closer is

[38:56] come from the frame of helping the prospect and so I will tell you this right now the best sales

[39:03] people care more about the prospect than they do so whoever cares the most about the prospect wins

[39:08] the sale and so if they care more about themselves then they will win they're like well of course

[39:12] they're going to look care more about themselves if you have more context and they do what's

[39:16] you should because you know more about the product than they do you should be able to have

[39:19] the best perspective to say no I'm not going to let this guy's limiting beliefs get in the way

[39:24] because I really want to help him or really want to help her and I can see that today it feels safe

[39:29] to retreat back to not taking action on this huge pain that they have but I can see how this is

[39:34] going to play out because I've seen a hundred other people just like them and walk out the door

[39:37] and I see him you know a year later and they're the exact same position or worse and I don't want

[39:41] that for them and so if you keep the human at the forefront of your mind when you're making the

[39:46] sale you'll never come across pushy because they could hear the intention they can hear the

[39:50] tonality in your voice about you actually just trying to help them so when you ask for the sale again

[39:55] having key stories and metaphors that you can use to break beliefs is what allows you to then

[40:02] ask again and you can do that literally unlimited times as long as they have time and you have time

[40:07] and you address the problem if you don't address the problem and ask in the good annoyed so you just

[40:11] want to make sure that you have an answer and you should have an answer because you've had this

[40:14] conversation before there's nothing they should be able to tell you that should surprise you if we zoom out

[40:20] we have a salesperson who has maximum hours maximum days they have as many times lots of

[40:26] days filled up with the best prospects because they worked them well they have a plan before and after

[40:30] it come prepared to the call and take notes and follow up with them bandfam the whole thing

[40:35] and when they're on the call they're completely present they breathe the script they know how to

[40:39] handle obstacles they have they have analogies and stories and metaphors memorize so they can help

[40:43] people overcome their issues they stick to the script they don't add to the script they keep their

[40:47] word-considious tight as humanly possible so they can maximize the number of sales they have

[40:51] for day and maximize the conversion rate of those sales fundamentally sales by the way I should have

[40:55] defined this earlier is increasing the likelihood that the prospect buys it's all this

[41:01] so everything that has to do with sales like if you had the perfect sales process it means you

[41:04] would account for every single variable that could ever happen to any human and you'd get 100% of

[41:09] people who go through this process to buy that's what a perfect sales process would be and so it's a

[41:14] percentage conversion that's all it is and so with that we have maximum opportunities maximum percentage

[41:19] conversion we have an amazing sales rep but what if they can only do it for a day that gets into the third

[41:24] bucket which is what I would consider meta skills which is traits of the best sales people

[41:32] the things that most sales people struggle with are trait issues meaning they are on and then they're

[41:38] off again they're on and they're off again they get motivated they get demotivated motivate

[41:41] if you feel like this then it's a skill deficiency you just don't know how to sustain

[41:45] performance for a long period of time and in problems you different champions that everyone

[41:48] else that they can sustain performance it's not like I don't know if sales is for me I don't know

[41:54] if I'm growing enough and my dude here's the clear deficiencies you can't stay consistent there's

[41:58] some growth that you can tackle right now being consistent another kind of meta skill around this

[42:02] is enthusiasm like their enthusiastic one week they're not enthusiastic next week be able to sustain

[42:08] and maintain a high level of enthusiasm for the role and when you're on the call is a skill

[42:13] it's a skill you whistle while you work you got to learn how to do it you got to learn to like the

[42:17] stuff you don't love so you can do the thing you really love which is sales the best sales people

[42:24] kill for sport so let me tell you this little analogy yeah notice a little analogy so I heard this

[42:29] from my car say and I just love this he said there's three types of sales people there's dogs

[42:33] horses and tigers he's like dogs you got to feed him and if you don't feed him they starve to death

[42:38] and you got to give him off the attention got to rub their belly every day and the moment you stop

[42:41] they die horses they will gallop as long as you keep whipping them but the moment you stop

[42:45] galloping they just go down to a truck he's like but tigers he said a tiger can eat a full meal

[42:51] but then if a bunny walks across his line of vision we'll kill the bunny for sport he's like

[42:56] you want tigers and I love that little analogy because the best sales people that ever have met my life

[43:01] they love sales they love the thrill of the clothes of the hunt when I was selling weight loss

[43:08] I would sometimes have homeless people and things like that they would come in who would respond to my

[43:12] ads it would happen right I had two ways to take it I could try not take it seriously try and just

[43:17] like basically just get through the sales I could move on to my life or I could see this free practice

[43:23] and what's crazy is the amount of times where I judge someone is poor and turned out that they just

[43:28] dress different I don't know anything about that was more times than I can count and a lot of them were

[43:34] like hey I appreciate you just like you know treat me well I was like of course I was like this is a business

[43:40] your money spends the same and so you either practice the skill or you close either way you win

[43:48] it's a lot like lifting weights where if you have your warm-up reps and they look different than

[43:52] your heavy reps you're actually not practicing at all so you're wasting all these opportunities that

[43:56] you could be practicing your skill sharpening the sword which is weakaw in the sales world

[44:02] you could be sharpening you should put your actually making it dollar because you're practicing the wrong way

[44:06] you're learning bad habits by not taking the sales seriously so the best sales people kill for sport

[44:11] and so I had a until you jake up story which is my young you know started with me at like 15

[44:18] now he's been with me over a year seven he started his low man on the totem pole and so when we would

[44:22] have lesser qualified leads they handed all of them to jake up he's like I'll be the garbage man

[44:27] he's like I'll take anybody's leads he's like I just want to get good I just want to practice

[44:30] and so he's trying to take as many reps as he possibly could and guess what happened he started

[44:34] taking more reps than everyone else did and guess what happened after that he got better than

[44:37] other people did because he took more reps and he took every one of these as a fucking gift which is

[44:41] what it is is that someone's going to give you the time to learn the skill of sales the business

[44:45] paid for that lead maybe it's less qualified they paid for it just the same and you have the benefit

[44:51] of learning the amount of people who want to learn how to sell better and are unwilling to take

[44:55] quote unqualified leads is ridiculous to me it's free practice with stakes and you still have the

[45:00] possibility of winning and closing a deal. Trock data the best sales people track data and so

[45:09] they're meticulous about the data they track and so let me explain this so you can judge and

[45:14] I've just seen this across my portfolio the skill of any person in any endeavor that they practice

[45:20] by the quantity and quality of the metrics they track and so if someone says oh I'm good at sales

[45:24] I'm like cool tell me about the metrics he track now if they're like oh just you know close

[45:28] right it's like well there's so many other metrics that you can track to understand how good you are

[45:33] at sales because the close rate is really just an outcome it gives you no leading indicators it

[45:37] tells you nothing else right I want to know what percentage of lead you're booking I want to know

[45:41] what percentage of scheduled things you're are showing I want to know of show rate what percentage you

[45:45] offering of offer how many of you're closing how many what's your average call to close you're

[45:50] doing one call two call one point two like what's your what's your average number what's your

[45:54] average number of cash collected like there's so many other metrics that you can track

[45:58] to know how well you're doing as a sales person and yes for everybody like shop this from the rooftops

[46:06] if you can get their scheduled up by 20% it's just as good it's getting their close rate up right 20%

[46:10] and so there's so many other things in the funnel that the best sales people know about closing

[46:14] about how to increase the total number of sales they get by controlling all of the other variables

[46:19] that are under their control now the bad guys the dogs are like I only want these times and I

[46:25] want them to be spoon fed to me and if I don't get them fed there and you don't pat me on the head

[46:29] I'm going to starve to death and die right that's what the dogs do and if you've got sales people

[46:33] like that they're dogs I don't care how much experience they have they're dogs right tigers are like

[46:38] I want to be available to kill whenever because I just love the hunt I would do this for free

[46:44] I'm just happy I get paid to do it pro tip if you are somebody who's running a sales team

[46:48] if you want to increase the close rates across the entire team even more give the best closers

[46:54] the best leads and the way you do that is that you have to start by scoring your leads first

[46:58] which means you actually have to track data so you can say these people have the highest likely to

[47:02] closing when they have three three characteristics they close it away higher percentage and then you give

[47:05] those leads to the best guys so fundamentally you'd want the worst leads to go to the worst guy the best leads to

[47:10] the best guy and everyone in between and so by doing that you actually match the organ so I actually had a salesman

[47:16] that I knew who was the top saleswrap for a time share business and it's exactly what you think it was

[47:21] so it's a billion dollar plus company this guy's making three million year in commission selling time shares

[47:26] and I had dinner with him and I was like what do you do you know differently and he said well

[47:31] I won the sales competition and so I got one hour with the CEO and on that one hour with the CEO which is the

[47:37] price for winning the sales competition just 3,000 sales people was number one they said I just said

[47:42] if you give me the best leads instead of wasting them on these guys who are new he's like I will make you so

[47:46] much money and so the guy experimented with his little division and he five X's income as the

[47:52] sales guy and then they took it and they rolled it out nationwide and they five X's the business and so

[48:00] there's a huge opportunity in every business to give the best closers the best leads because you make more money

[48:06] and what happens is is that the best guys will actually make more and more and more money

[48:11] which then creates a survivorship bias for new guys coming in and so if you know the best guy

[48:17] used to make 200,000 year as the top closer but now can make 800,000 year the amount of sales

[48:22] people that you will attract your opportunity will 10 X now even though the entry level guys

[48:27] now make less than they did before the opportunity just like the lottery the same reason people

[48:32] by tickets is they assume that they're going to get there and so by having it this way you'll have

[48:37] people come in willing to make less because they know that if they if they perform well they'll go

[48:42] to the big leagues now the other benefit of this is that you train your new guys on the worst leads

[48:47] so you lose the least money as a business but they also develop their skills because they've got to

[48:51] learn how to big borrow it's steel and squeeze blood from the stones from the least qualified

[48:56] customers and so when they get to somebody who's got a 700 credit score it actually has intent to buy

[49:01] they're like oh my god this is amazing because they practiced on somebody who's like missing an arm

[49:06] and missing seven credit cards and they are in bankruptcy and they're actually in the middle of

[49:10] a divorce and the real name isn't how it's actually Larry and you know it's complicated and a

[49:16] liquid right now I'm between thing you know whatever right and they're closing those people for lunch

[49:22] money and so when you learn how to do that when you get to like qualified prospects you're like oh my

[49:26] god this amazing but at that point the business doesn't bear the cost the salesperson does so that they

[49:31] can develop their skills because business being real you're still paying them to learn and I'd rather

[49:37] pay as little as I can so I can allocate the resources the best way possible in the business

[49:43] my biggest pet peeve in the reverse of that is my favorite thing about the best salespeople

[49:47] is they never blame circumstances so whenever I have a salesperson is like the leads are bad or you know

[49:55] these these people aren't a good fit or just like whatever BS that they can come up with

[49:59] or like I don't like the commissioner structure we should change to like just focus on things you

[50:05] can control right and the guys that I love the most never complain they pick up the extra shifts

[50:10] they call the leads the most they work them the most they're like these leads are amazing

[50:15] I'm so grateful to have these and be able to practice and get paid to do it and there's a time

[50:20] in a place for giving feedback on stuff group calls not one of them if you are one of these sales

[50:26] people you give it one on one with the managers I hate by the way I've noticed like some people

[50:30] go on the phone just objectively like their credit scores are just consistently lower than they

[50:34] were a couple months ago I don't know if we've changed anything on the marketing side I'm going

[50:36] to approach the leads the same I love the practice just thought might be you know useful data

[50:40] for marketing right that's very different than like dude these leads are shit I'm not taking these

[50:44] calls right that's just a premium adana and I hate that and so again the worst the leads the

[50:50] better you get the flex your skill and the best sales people take 100% of the control and the best

[50:55] marketers take 100% of the control too and so if everybody is taking absolute blame for every outcome

[51:00] guess what you win if you want to tackle breakdown of scaling a sales team from zero to 40 we

[51:07] actually did that in one of our portfolio companies in just over a quarter we had a $21 million

[51:11] in profit to the business they're largest portfolio company and so if you want everyone of those

[51:14] steps outlined in black and white on the whiteboard I break it down and enjoy the case study

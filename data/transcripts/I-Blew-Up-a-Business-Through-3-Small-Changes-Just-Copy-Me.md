[00:00] So this lawyer was losing $100,000 a year because his business model was broken.

[00:04] And so what I want to walk through is how we fixed it and how you can apply the learnings

[00:07] from his business to your business. My name is auctionmezzly, I run acquisition.com,

[00:11] it's a portfolio companies that last year did do over $250 million a year in aggregate and we

[00:15] help businesses just like the one I'm going to walk you through today, scale. So let me give you the

[00:19] first rule that I have in terms of scaling a business. 111, one product, one avatar, one channel,

[00:26] until you're a million bucks a year. All right, so that means you sell one thing to one person in

[00:30] one way until you get to a million. The first issue was the help everyone issue. I don't think

[00:36] there's anything wrong with having this as a noble goal. But you're not going to help anybody

[00:40] if you're broke. You need resources. So the attorney launched courses in software to kind of give

[00:44] back, there are some financial consequences from that because the software itself alone was losing

[00:49] him money. And so he's spending the majority of his time on these two things and guess where you

[00:53] think most of his money was coming from here. His services, here's the reality of this,

[00:58] is that every hour you were spending on the unprofitable work was an hour not spent on scaling the

[01:03] services which was the main cash cow the business. Like it kills a ton of businesses and they think

[01:08] is they feel justified in this. Like they're doing the lower its work. But you're not, you're

[01:13] fooling yourself because you're not willing to confront the harder issue, which is that you don't

[01:17] know how to focus and you don't know how to say no. And it also means you don't know how to say

[01:21] no to customers because you cannot sell everyone. Even if you give everything away for free,

[01:25] you'll have people who complain. So people complaining is going to be a constant in business.

[01:29] You might as well have them complain and be profitable and help the people who are swimming

[01:32] towards you. And this is actually pretty near-endier to me because when I met Layla, my wife, she was a

[01:37] trainer and she actually had this bleeding heart syndrome, if you will. And she was like, I just want

[01:43] to build a company where people really love working and I just want to help a lot of people.

[01:46] And I said, do you think it's possible that you will be able to help more people if you make money?

[01:51] And she thought about it for a while and she was like, yeah, I think so. And so that was actually

[01:54] one of the first conversations we had on our first date that led into all the things that we have

[01:59] today. And so this is what we did to solve problem number one. We killed the vampire, right?

[02:04] Because right now they had something that was sucking up their cash flow and preventing them from

[02:08] scaling. Now here this hope may be also the software down the lines of doing your actions on the software.

[02:11] It's not good enough. You don't have any money. The people that you have working for you are unfocused.

[02:15] It's not going to work long term. It's going to give you this multiple. Like this is the thing.

[02:18] People think like, oh, I put some code together. I'm going to have a 10x on my

[02:21] top line. If you think that you're not going to get it, people who are actually in software are going

[02:26] all in and it's still incredibly hard. The second thing is we took the education business and I

[02:31] said, okay, well, what if we could use that to just drive more into the services? So we reposition

[02:37] the very cheap education as free education and then that allows people to ascend themselves into the

[02:43] services. And so this gives you a very powerful front end that can spread from word of mouth. You can also

[02:47] advertise it, but ultimately we just know that that's going to drive more people into this community where

[02:51] he was teaching things and then they're like, you know what? This sounds like a lot of work. I love to have

[02:55] you do it. And the third thing we did is that, okay, if we've killed the vampire, we repositioned the

[03:00] education to drive the services, what can we do with the services? Well, we want to double down.

[03:04] And so what does that actually mean? It means we had to reprise the services because their close rate

[03:08] was exceptionally high. Again, the help of everyone issue. They just wanted to say, yes,

[03:12] everything was a person, but they weren't able to get nearly as much profit as they probably should have.

[03:16] And so in his business, I saw an easy, double or triple for the right avatar. And so what happens is,

[03:21] let's say you've got, you know, avatar A, avatar B, and avatar C. The thing is that the

[03:25] an aclent might be able to spend 10 times more than a sea client. And so what most people do is they take

[03:30] A, B and C, the average them and say, okay, a woman at charge 2x rather than 10x. And they sacrifice

[03:36] their margin and ultimately how much they're able to scale. Because believe it or not, they're still a ton of

[03:41] A's. So just serve them first. The best customer you have. This is the ICP, the ideal customer

[03:46] profile. This is what we're doubling down on in the service. Let's find that one customer that one

[03:51] avatar to sell our one product to on one channel. So that's how we solve problem number one. Real quick,

[03:56] the reason for this ad is I'm throwing the entrepreneur event of the season and you're invited.

[04:01] This is going to be my biggest book ever. No, not like that. This is going to be my biggest book.

[04:05] Well, not even like that. This is going to be my biggest book ever. Actually, not even like that.

[04:09] This is going to be my biggest book ever. $100 million money models. And I've been preparing to

[04:15] release this book to you for over two years. And at the launch event, August 16th, I'm going to be showing

[04:20] you how to get more customers to spend more money with you in less time over and over again. The

[04:23] most viable skill set I have. Now, on top of that, come check this out. I've got five mystery

[04:29] headlines that have all confirmed they're going to be their live. And they've never before shared

[04:32] the same stage and most of these people don't speak publicly. Now on top of that, I have four

[04:37] amazing bonuses that are available to anyone who wants to pre-order both. You don't have to because

[04:41] you can register for free for that and you can show for free. You can enjoy all of that for nothing.

[04:44] But if you want to pre-order copy the book, I got four bonuses for you. Now on top of that,

[04:48] I've got one project that I've been working on for the last two years that I'll be unveiling

[04:52] life. And I can't say what it is, but I can tell you that it's better than an NFC. It's less than

[04:57] a bit coin. Every single person shows up live gets one. So, if you want to click, register,

[05:03] I'll see you there live, August 16th, pre-order book if you want. It's going to be awesome.

[05:08] So, problem number two is they had broken traffic. So, what does this mean? It means they had a

[05:16] leaky bucket. Right? So, when I asked him to walk me through how he was getting customers,

[05:21] he told me that he created content on YouTube. But when I asked him if that was where most of the

[05:24] leads were coming from, he said, actually they go to his Instagram page for YouTube. I was like,

[05:28] okay, so what are your cost action in the video? I was like, do you send them from your video?

[05:33] Instagram, he said, no, they actually just randomly find me on Instagram. And then they DM us,

[05:38] on Instagram and ask these questions and that's ultimately how we get leads. I was like, okay,

[05:42] slow down. So, you're getting all your leads from a place that you don't tell them where to go.

[05:47] And then when they get to that Instagram, which they find on accident, your profile doesn't even

[05:52] solicit them to DM you. And he was like, yes. So, it's like, great. Well, let's solve that now.

[05:59] I make this as an extreme example. But I see this a problem that a lot of business owners make,

[06:02] which is that they don't know where the leads are coming from. And so they continue to optimize

[06:06] for the wrong thing. They continue to stick with what's comfortable or what they know instead of

[06:11] adjusting based on the customers how they behave. Right? And so he was probably leaving 20, 30,

[06:17] 50,000 dollars a month on the table just by not optimizing his traffic that he already was getting.

[06:22] So, we did five things to solve this problem. So, number one is we added CTAs at the 30%

[06:29] market as YouTube videos to go to Instagram and DM him. The second is that we put that CTA

[06:35] more place it. So, we also put it in the description. We also put it in the pinned comment.

[06:39] We also updated as YouTube profile to also have the same CTA. So, BC and D are all the same concept.

[06:45] And then finally, here's the nasty one. We started proactively DMing people who are following him,

[06:51] because he's doing way better on YouTube than he is an Instagram. And so, most of those new

[06:55] followers are people who are coming from his YouTube. So, we just said, okay, well, if someone follows you,

[07:00] DM them. And just say, hey, you hear for free stuff or do you want to help with your legal stuff? They say,

[07:04] I want to help them boom, you have a lead. If I'm a business owner, I'm thinking, okay, what can I take from this?

[07:08] So, we took someone's existing behavior. We weren't like, oh, let's drive them through funnel.

[07:12] People were already going to Instagram and DM him and he already knew how to convert from DM. So, like,

[07:15] let's not break that, let's lubricate it. The other piece that we did in terms of why this worked is that

[07:20] we were getting qualified leads up front. So, we started filtering them in the DMers by saying,

[07:24] free thing or help. And by doing that, it just got so much of the time wasted in the DMs off their

[07:30] plate. So, the third problem that we encountered was he had an hourly billing trap. I used billing the wrong way.

[07:36] They were charging $250 an hour and the average client value was $1500. All right, so that's six hours on average.

[07:43] This, in my opinion, was leaving a lot on the table, because people were actually coming to him,

[07:47] not for hourly services, they were coming for a specific result. The issue here is that he actually was

[07:51] underpricing the result. And so, trying to say, hey, we're $250 an hour, maybe that's a lot,

[07:56] maybe it's not a lot. No, no, no, it's a really good idea of what an hourly rate should be,

[08:01] unless they just look at other people's hourly rates, which makes you a commodity. Whereas, if you say,

[08:05] hey, you want your music to be able to be sold to a record label, I'll get all of the IP protection

[08:10] in place in order for you to do that. Well, now, I can position the price of my thing in relation

[08:14] to the dream outcome that they want, which is to become a music star and ultimately leverage that

[08:19] to become famous and, you know, save the world with their music. And so, this underpricing trap is

[08:23] especially common with service providers who price based on time based on outcome. All right, you

[08:28] want to be value based, not kind of feature based in terms of your pricing. So, we did see the hourly

[08:32] billing and we went with $5,800 upfront. Now, that sounds like holy cow, that's way bigger.

[08:37] Now, remember, he had plenty of sales conversations that he was able to generate,

[08:42] and he had a pretty good close rate. And so, if you have a really good close rate or an

[08:45] exceptionally good close rate, then I hear that and think, oh, we're underpriced. And so, on top of this

[08:50] 5,800, we also tagged in a little commission that he gets if they close a deal. And some of these

[08:55] deals are worth $700,000, so it actually adds up to be a pretty material for him. But also,

[09:00] I like adding that piece in because when you talk about flat feet plus performance, guess what

[09:05] you think the prospect is thinking, oh, this is probably going to happen. So, actually,

[09:09] literally how we present our price will dictate the belief that a prospect is going to have

[09:14] based on what they will believe our incentive structure is. If you just said, hey, I'm 100%

[09:19] commission, then people will be like, holy cow, that's an amazing offer. And a lot of people do

[09:23] that because it is such an amazing offer. But how can we dial this back to find the sweet spot

[09:27] because plenty of these musicians might not have been good. And some of the clients that you might

[09:30] work with might not actually be successful. So, we have to balance our risk here, but still having

[09:34] an element of performance still drives that conviction. Now, what we did that I think is kind of

[09:37] clever, and this is my preferred way of doing things if I ever have the option, is having an AB offer.

[09:42] And so, you can AB anything hint it's coming out of my next book, I'm talking about this. But

[09:47] whenever you have an offer, if you say, would you like talk of Anila, do you want to start

[09:51] Monday or Tuesday, do you want to have a male or female masseuse? You could always AB your offer.

[09:56] All right, and so the B offer that we made here was $25,000 with zero commission.

[10:02] Now, what is this offer? This offers an anchor because now it makes the $1500

[10:06] seem like a steel. So, that was the main thing we did to break him out of the other building.

[10:10] Now, you might be like, well, he might not sell as many. Well, guess what we did earlier. We've

[10:13] got him a whole bunch more traffic, and we got way more people to opt in, and we already triaged

[10:17] to the best clients. See how this is all stacking together? So, the fourth problem that came up is like,

[10:21] okay, he didn't have a sales process. Now, he was good at selling, but he didn't have any kind of

[10:25] process in place to make it a sales motion that is repeatable. And so, if your conversions right now,

[10:30] or hit or miss, and you're not sure what's going on, it's usually because you're missing a sales flow.

[10:34] And so, everything was happening at Hawks. So, some leads came through Instagram,

[10:37] others booked random calls through county, to be fair. I'm not hating on him. Like, he's, you know,

[10:41] he's doing a great job, and it's small business. We're starting out. That's how it works, right?

[10:45] But, if you're in the situation, you have a huge amount of opportunity here by just cleaning the

[10:50] stuff up. So, the founder was actually treating every call like a legal consultation, and so,

[10:54] he was actually charging the $250 for the call up front because it was an hour of his time.

[10:59] Which for me, I'm like, oh my god, we're missing out on so many opportunities because we haven't

[11:02] positioned this in any kind of valuable way. It's just like, hey, pay for an hour of my time,

[11:05] and then I'll sell you more hours of my time. Not a fan. Instead, I'd rather qualify prospects

[11:11] up front, have them watch a structured sales presentation, make sure that they are qualified for

[11:16] the product or service that we're trying to sell, then sell that thing all up front, and then

[11:22] provide the service. And so, what this does is this actually matches to what a high-intent lead,

[11:27] how they actually want to buy. They want to know that you're legit. They want to know that

[11:30] they have a process. This isn't your first rodeo, and you demonstrate that even before you do your

[11:34] services. How someone is sold will dictate how legit they think you are. Here's what we implement

[11:39] inside the business to fix the sales motion. So, number one is we put a VSL, that was five

[11:43] seven minutes. If you don't know what that is, it's a video sales letter. All this is basically

[11:47] explaining who, oh, where, why, this is what we do, and then frequently asked questions. You don't

[11:50] need to overcompagate this. A lot of people think that there's some big black box of magic

[11:54] that like only the super secret ninja marketers understand. You just answer the questions and

[11:59] the language that they present to you on sales calls. So, the normal question someone asks

[12:04] on calls about your products and your services. You take all these questions, you say back to them

[12:08] in the video and say a lot of people ask this question. This is how we answer this, how we answer it.

[12:13] That's it. It's all we're doing. Again, it doesn't need to be super long, but it will help

[12:16] qualify customers, and you will see a dramatic lift if you only do this. The rumors are true.

[12:21] My next book, 100 billion dollar money models is coming out, and I'm launching it at a live event

[12:26] and after the event, which you can register for free, I'm going to show you how to do four things.

[12:30] One, get more customers to spend more money in less time with you over and over again.

[12:35] And the craziest thing of all is that I've been planning on a secret project for multiple years,

[12:40] and every single person who shows up live is going to get one. And I can't say what it is,

[12:44] but I can tell you that it's less than a Bitcoin and more than an FT and every single person who shows

[12:49] up live gets one. But you got to be their live August 16. I'll see you there.

[12:58] The second thing we did is we implement BANTA. And I do this in basically every single business

[13:01] that I advise, which is budget, authority, need, and timing. So this is actually originally from

[13:07] IBM and like the 60s and it has stuck. So do they have the money? Can they make the decision?

[13:13] Do they need this solution for them right now? And the right now is the timing piece.

[13:17] Are they willing to move forward today? And in terms of asking the question, we could just ask

[13:21] questions like, can you afford $5,800 in order to get your business, you know, incorporated, your IP

[13:27] productive? Is there anyone else who's involved in this decision? That's authority. What happens if you

[13:32] don't solve this? Need. When would you like to get this done? Or when would you like to start?

[13:36] You give them a drop down like today tomorrow or you know a few weeks from now. You want to sell

[13:39] by the way that people say today tomorrow. See, the next thing we did is that we needed to fix this

[13:45] from a consultation to a sales call. All right, which means that we actually have to have a script.

[13:49] We have to clarify whether they're labeled them on the problem over their past experiences,

[13:53] understand the gap between where they're, where they want to go. We aggravate the pain,

[13:57] make sure it's very clear what happens if they don't do it. And I'll give you the simplest structure

[14:01] for this, which is plus plus minus minus plus minus minus plus. All right. So what you show here is

[14:07] you say, hey, if you work with me, you get more good stuff. And if you work with me, you get less bad

[14:10] stuff. Cool. Now, if you don't work with me, you're going to get more bad stuff. And if you don't work

[14:15] with me, you're going to get less good stuff. And so that gives you four angles of persuasion that you can

[14:18] do in the sales consultation when you get to the S of the closer framework. So clarify, see L,

[14:24] label them with the problem. Oh, over the past experience. S sell them the vacation. Here we go. E,

[14:30] explaining whether concerns, part of that's going to be covered in the VSL. If they come back up,

[14:33] you'll overcome them the same way. And then R reinforced the decision, which is once they ultimately buy.

[14:38] The next thing we do, which I'm not always a big fan of, but because he had so many unqualified

[14:42] customers, is having a downsell that was basically hands off. And just say, hey, you can buy this

[14:46] thing for $2 to $3,000 rather than saying buy it for $10 a month. It's a different, a different way

[14:52] of monetizing the do it yourself path. But I also like this as a downsell because you're like,

[14:57] man, for only $50, you know, for if I'm 3K for this and I just paint extra $20, $100 and I can have them

[15:02] do it and make sure it's right. I'd rather have them do it. So we actually have acres on both sides.

[15:07] So the downsell is not that much less and the anchor is way higher. So it makes the best path

[15:12] through the best option, the $5,800, which is the core offer. When we put these pieces in place for

[15:17] the sales process, it creates a predictable system rather than relying on ad hoc or random chance.

[15:22] And the pre-qualification process, make sure that time is spent with the viable prospects,

[15:27] the good people who've got the money to spend the need to get solved, the authority make the decision

[15:31] they want to do it now. And the VSL sets the expectations and a structured approach in the

[15:36] conversation allows for continuous improvements that you can actually look at the sales. You can

[15:40] listen to the recordings, you can ask if the VSL, you can ask to the script and you keep the

[15:43] optimization cycle going. And this is what makes sales repeatable, measurable, and ultimately

[15:48] scalable to a team rather than just being a big. We talk to people sometimes approach, which is

[15:52] what the lot a lot of business owners do because you know, it's worked for you so far. The thing

[15:56] is that sometimes we'll try to get you so far is not going to get you where we want to go. Come

[15:59] check this out real quick. So if you're listening to this and you're like, wow, these are really

[16:02] specific instructions. Guess what? He was at stage four prioritized in the scaling roadmap. What

[16:07] was this constraint product? You said yes to anyone who would pay feedback from so many different

[16:12] customer's creates two many different product directions. Does that sound familiar? It's because

[16:16] businesses behave in patterns. And the nice thing is that because they behave in patterns,

[16:19] they can also be solved with the same patterns. So what do you have to do? Specialized product

[16:22] to a V2 price to serve that new knit down avatar. That's what we did. Marketing, you do many

[16:26] unqualified leads. So what do we do? Make better free stuff, the education, and make more creative

[16:31] to boost life. Now, already how to not create it. But he was leaking. Add qualification and friction

[16:35] so the extra volume, self-slides. Doesn't the sound a lot like what we just did. Now, this isn't

[16:38] like a magic trick where I'm like, wait, I just reprint this for every one of these videos. No, it's

[16:42] like businesses behave in patterns. And so if you're stuck right now and you would like to see what we do

[16:47] to help get people unstuck. You can go to Acrozen.com for such roadmap. We actually made this for

[16:52] ourselves as an internal assessment tool because I wanted to have a more tech-enabled service. But then

[16:56] I was like, you know what? Let's just make it free. And so that's what we did. All right. Now, if you would

[17:00] like our help doing this kind of like what we did with this particular turning on the next page,

[17:03] you can book call and our team will get to know you, get to know the business, and if it makes sense,

[17:07] invite you out in person to our headquarters where we can actually dig into the business and come

[17:11] with the most personalized tactics that will ultimately help you scale the business the fastest.

[17:14] So if that sounds interesting, click the link, get the free thing, and book go. Otherwise,

[17:18] enjoy the other's video. So the TDR is this. Keep the main thing, the main thing, and cut what's

[17:23] not working. Second point, traffic is useless without a clear direction. Three, price-based

[17:28] value, not time. If you want to see the actual conversation that I had with this attorney, you can

[17:34] look it out over here. Enjoy.

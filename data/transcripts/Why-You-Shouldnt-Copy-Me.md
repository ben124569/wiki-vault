[00:00] And to what they think they're doing is they're like,

[00:01] well that's what everyone else is doing.

[00:02] So I need to build my personal brand.

[00:04] You're not building anyone's fucking brand.

[00:06] You're just reinforcing an identity

[00:07] that everyone already knows about

[00:09] and does not find you interesting

[00:10] because your same is everybody else.

[00:11] If you remember when you were in middle school,

[00:13] there was like the preps and the goth kids

[00:15] and then the brothers or the athletes

[00:16] or whatever.

[00:17] When we were growing up, we're trying to figure out our identity

[00:19] and maybe some of you weirdos actually switch tables

[00:21] once or twice because you're figuring out who you were

[00:23] and what happens is we learn these identities

[00:25] that come with these sets of beliefs.

[00:27] You see this a little bit in the political seat.

[00:28] If you're a Republican, all of a sudden you have

[00:30] to wear a flannel and trucker has America

[00:33] and shoot guns and on the flip side, if you're liberal,

[00:35] you have to just say all homeless people can do whatever

[00:37] they want, whenever and we should let everyone across the border

[00:40] no matter what, we all should raise taxes.

[00:42] Basically ridiculous to some of the sides.

[00:43] What happened to the real middle people who just like,

[00:45] hey, you can marry whoever you want.

[00:47] Please don't tax me too much.

[00:48] There's this middle and that's why people like

[00:49] are going to blow up because if you were like,

[00:51] he's a Republican, he's a liberal.

[00:52] It's like he's just Joe Rogan.

[00:54] Like Joe Rogan is interested in UFC.

[00:55] He's also interested in aliens.

[00:57] He's also interested in stand-up comedy.

[00:59] He's also has this kind of fitness carnivore

[01:01] or whatever thing goes.

[01:02] And biohacking.

[01:03] So he has these like, every different interest

[01:05] that he super deep on and no one would be like,

[01:07] Joe, so what we're thinking is you need to increase

[01:09] your biohacking by 15% so we can capture this audience.

[01:12] No.

[01:13] If you want to stand out in your marketing

[01:15] or even a personal brand, just actually saying what

[01:17] you really believe, the thing that you're afraid of saying

[01:19] because it may be as two or three or four beliefs

[01:21] that don't go with the uniform that you wear every day,

[01:23] actually makes you significantly more unique.

[01:26] Most people wear their clothing as a uniform to say,

[01:30] I am this type of person.

[01:31] People will look at you and they'll assume you're a Goth

[01:34] or a craft or whatever.

[01:35] Here's where it gets cool.

[01:36] You start talking, then all of a sudden,

[01:37] there's something over here.

[01:38] And then there's another belief over here.

[01:39] And what happens is they start paying more attention

[01:41] because you don't fit the mold.

[01:43] It's my favorite way to differentiate any of the portfolio

[01:46] companies are even my own brand.

[01:47] It's may sound crazy.

[01:48] Actually, just be myself.

[01:49] Because as soon as someone feels like they have figured you out,

[01:52] they'll move on.

[01:52] Because they're like, I can predict all of this person's behavior.

[01:55] They don't need to stay in tune or stay updated

[01:57] because they know everything about you already.

[01:59] And I'm sure you've met people like this.

[02:00] He wears this uniform.

[02:01] He says these things he believes is this person.

[02:03] He's category 17.

[02:04] But don't have to think about it again.

[02:05] Everyone knows the starter kit for real estate.

[02:07] You know the haircut, they cut the side here, right?

[02:09] Buzz on the side, hard part, hard gel, over the suit.

[02:12] Don't forget the glass is very important.

[02:14] Maybe the high level BMW mid series, wax with rims.

[02:17] Maybe a picture of a watch is like, yeah, just bought this beauty.

[02:21] The guys are all the same.

[02:22] And to what they think they're doing is they're like,

[02:23] well, that's what everyone else is doing.

[02:25] So I need to build my personal brand.

[02:26] You're not building anyone's fucking brand.

[02:28] You're just reinforcing an identity that everyone already knows about

[02:31] and does not find you interesting because your same is everybody else.

[02:34] I think that you would be better served actually doing you.

[02:37] And that comes with all the weirdness that you are.

[02:40] Because I've met some of you.

[02:41] Y'all are where to fuck.

[02:42] And if you stop pretending to be this identity

[02:45] that you wrap into the starter kit of whatever incident

[02:48] influenced through your trying to copy.

[02:49] And you just worry you, what happens is your unique

[02:51] individual personalities are like weirdness

[02:54] because everybody had different parents.

[02:55] Everybody was born in different cities.

[02:56] Everyone has unique things.

[02:57] Like your dad might have been a mechanic.

[02:58] You might know a bunch of shit about cars.

[03:00] And if you bring that up, all of a sudden people look at what

[03:02] they expect from the real estate starter kit.

[03:04] And then all of a sudden, if you've got these points over here

[03:06] and you become interesting and people lean in,

[03:08] they pay attention because you don't match the mold.

[03:10] I'm gonna shift this to business.

[03:11] There was this time where there was this competitor

[03:12] who moved in my marketplace when I had a local jet.

[03:14] Guy was outspetting me and I was like, man,

[03:16] I'm gonna have to do something about this.

[03:17] So what I did was I copied the guy's landing page.

[03:20] So I copied everything, changed the logo, whatever.

[03:21] Who's like probably 90% the same.

[03:23] Here's what's crazy.

[03:24] His page did worse than mine to it.

[03:25] Why am I copying this guy?

[03:26] I actually just got worse.

[03:27] How comes from this?

[03:28] Fast word, I was Jim Lutz days.

[03:29] Somebody came to the marketplace,

[03:30] started marketing really similar stuff.

[03:32] I subscribed to the list to see what the emails they were sending

[03:34] and they were my emails.

[03:35] Literally 100% word for word.

[03:37] Didn't even like swap anything out.

[03:38] They were my emails.

[03:39] I'm like, man, I'm thinking about copying this guy

[03:41] by hopping on his newsletter.

[03:42] He's just using my shit.

[03:43] A lot of people say staying tuned with your competitors.

[03:45] Can you remember when I was a stuff?

[03:46] I actually don't feel that way.

[03:48] I actually turned off all my ads on my newsfeed.

[03:50] When I made my marketing or made my content,

[03:52] I just made it about whatever stuff I felt like talking about.

[03:54] And so people were like, man, your stuff's always so different.

[03:57] And so original, whatever.

[03:58] And it's really easy to be original.

[03:59] If you're just not looking at everyone else's shit.

[04:01] The active consuming everyone else's stuff.

[04:03] What ends up happening is that those thoughts

[04:04] become top of mind for you and become another Mickey Mouse,

[04:06] another Instagram influencer starter kit.

[04:08] They've got the watt, the car, 100% hustle, 0% grind.

[04:11] If other people copy you, it's a good sign.

[04:14] Because it means that what you're doing is working

[04:16] and most people aren't original.

[04:17] If you copy them, what it means is that you accept

[04:19] the position of second place.

[04:20] You accept that they are inherently first.

[04:22] You literally said you are better than me at this.

[04:25] And if you claim to be the best at whatever it is

[04:27] that you're trying to do or at least that you're trying

[04:28] to be the best, you copying their identity,

[04:31] their look, their feel, their brand.

[04:33] Means that you are accepting to lose.

[04:34] You will never win.

[04:35] Because you aren't going to beat them at being that.

[04:37] The story is high in our software company Alan,

[04:39] who was a real estate agency.

[04:41] So we worked with agency owners in that business.

[04:43] And so this guy was continually struck.

[04:44] Like you couldn't really ever break through there.

[04:46] And he was always selling new people

[04:47] and they would always turn out the back, whatever.

[04:48] Took me six months of just battering him over the head with this.

[04:51] Publicly embarrassing him to finally get him

[04:53] to change his behavior.

[04:54] I was like, you're not that good.

[04:55] It's not some marketing hack.

[04:57] It's not some sales hack.

[04:58] I was like, you're just not that good.

[04:59] I was like, you sell to realtors.

[05:00] He was like, yeah, I was like, have you ever been a realtor?

[05:02] He was like, no.

[05:03] Then you have no idea what they go through.

[05:05] And what your marketing looks like

[05:07] and what your sales process looks like

[05:08] is the same as every other fucking person

[05:10] trying to sell realtors.

[05:11] Promise you, put your terrible agency.

[05:12] Go take the 12 weeks past the test.

[05:14] And actually be a realtor.

[05:15] Sell some fucking houses using your marketing skills

[05:17] that you claim to sell in the first month of him doing this.

[05:20] He was like, oh shit, he's like, these leads aren't as good

[05:21] as I thought they were.

[05:22] I was like, no shit.

[05:23] That's why no one wanted to keep banging.

[05:25] But you know what he did over the next 12 months.

[05:26] He got better and better and better at it.

[05:28] And here's the crazy thing.

[05:29] 12 months later.

[05:30] He actually still a realtor

[05:31] and he's making more money.

[05:32] Because he actually had a good at it.

[05:33] But here's the thing.

[05:34] If he had kept trying to look like everybody else,

[05:36] he would've been Mickey Mouseing until he kept trying

[05:38] some new thing or something new hack.

[05:39] But he just didn't confront the work.

[05:40] And you know what happens now is that if he actually did

[05:42] want to go back to the agency thing

[05:44] and actually did want to help realtor,

[05:45] he would have the context to do it.

[05:47] And it would make him unique.

[05:48] Because so many other people are just like him,

[05:50] pretending to be modeled their Instagram page

[05:53] after the same thing as the other influence

[05:54] that they're looking up to does,

[05:56] rather than being like, I wanted to figure out real estate.

[05:58] Most people don't do that.

[05:59] They just look whatever else is doing, do the same thing,

[06:01] water it down and they literally blend in.

[06:03] Like everyone else and they wonder why they don't win.

[06:06] You've heard me say replicate before you iterate.

[06:08] That comes to skills.

[06:10] If you want to learn how to sell,

[06:12] I'd next to the guy who's making calls.

[06:13] You want to learn how to knock on doors,

[06:14] walk with the guy who's the best guy on the team

[06:16] who knocks doors, right?

[06:17] You duplicate the skill so you know you can do it.

[06:20] That's different than replicating a story

[06:22] and replicating an identity.

[06:23] I've seen her like her mouth is a fly

[06:25] and her mouth is a style content

[06:27] and her mouth is a style edits.

[06:29] It's not about the captions.

[06:31] It's about the content.

[06:32] What they can copy is the way it looks and feels and sounds

[06:34] and what they can't copy is the story behind it.

[06:36] Fix the story and the brand will take care of itself

[06:38] if you tell the story that's true.

[06:39] And so if you don't have the story to tell,

[06:41] then do the shit that we're filling

[06:43] and no one else is willing to do.

[06:44] And then you'll have the story that will make you a one-of-one.

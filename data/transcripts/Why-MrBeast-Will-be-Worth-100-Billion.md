[00:00] Mr. Beast is gonna be worth over $100 billion,

[00:03] and it's gonna happen faster than you think.

[00:04] So Jim, this is me calling my shot for you.

[00:06] There's eight points that I wanna make,

[00:08] and stick around to the end,

[00:08] because I'm actually gonna react

[00:10] to one of his latest videos with Tom Brady

[00:12] and Pete Davidson over a nice lunch of Beastables

[00:15] and never skip his Earth.

[00:15] So first is he has massive leverage

[00:17] in terms of what he puts in versus what he gets out.

[00:19] So he may spend a million,

[00:21] two million, even four million dollars on a video,

[00:23] but the amount of impressions that that one video gets

[00:26] across the world, because he also translates it

[00:29] is worth hundreds of millions.

[00:31] So let me give you an idea of what Beast Industries

[00:33] is all about in terms of the ecosystem.

[00:34] Across like four or five, six YouTube channels,

[00:37] he's got 183 million subscribers,

[00:39] and that doesn't include the international channels

[00:41] which are more than half of his audience.

[00:42] But I don't put them this yet, Kevin, I'm Gion.

[00:44] What the heck?

[00:46] On top of that, he's got TikTok,

[00:47] he's got Instagram, he's got Twitter,

[00:48] and in aggregate, he's got over 300 million plus subscribers.

[00:51] They're also incredibly engaged.

[00:53] This is crazy.

[00:54] Oh, I can't even hear her.

[00:57] In 2022, Mr. Beast had the fastest growing account

[01:01] on TikTok and YouTube.

[01:03] Two of the platforms that has the most eyeballs right now,

[01:05] he has the most of them.

[01:06] You think about the amount of creators

[01:07] on each of those platforms,

[01:08] and he was literally number one on both.

[01:11] His biggest videos are bigger than the Super Bowl.

[01:13] It's hard for people to comprehend that.

[01:15] On the business side, he's got Beast Burger,

[01:18] which is a ghost kitchen,

[01:19] which basically leverages the network of restaurants

[01:21] that already exist,

[01:22] and then he uses his distribution-based of customers

[01:25] to buy stuff on an app,

[01:26] and then it gets delivered and filled on

[01:27] from whatever local restaurants he's already partnered with.

[01:29] The next thing he's got Beast Gaming,

[01:31] which is where he'll try and make apps and video games

[01:33] because he has a big gaming audience.

[01:34] But I think where the real winner for him is going to be,

[01:37] and this is what I would make my bet on,

[01:38] is that he's going to be going all in on Beast the Bulls.

[01:42] Number two is that when you have a media company,

[01:44] your product is your marketing,

[01:45] which is one of the unique advantages

[01:46] that only media companies have, meaning,

[01:48] the more you spend on your product,

[01:51] which is your media,

[01:52] the more marketing ends up happening.

[01:54] If you don't know who I am,

[01:54] my name's Alphabes,

[01:55] I own Acquisites.com.

[01:56] I make these videos because I hope to attract other

[01:58] business owners towards us

[01:59] that are doing over a million dollars a year

[02:00] in profit so we can invest in your business and help it scale.

[02:02] There's a ton of leverage for media creators

[02:05] because what they sell and how they market themselves

[02:07] are one and the same.

[02:08] And with that leverage,

[02:10] he's able to gain access to other people's massive distribution

[02:14] pages.

[02:15] He was surprised how much Joe Rogan's podcast with him,

[02:17] you invest so much money into the show.

[02:21] I'll tell you that, make it.

[02:22] I don't, I don't, why do I need money?

[02:23] How many older people started recognizing him

[02:26] from that podcast?

[02:27] He can get on Joe Rogan, he can get on,

[02:29] flagrant.

[02:30] $1 trillion I give you right now.

[02:31] I bought everything I wanted in life.

[02:33] He can get on impulsive because they know

[02:36] that if he's on their podcast,

[02:38] that podcast will crush because he brings his own audience.

[02:41] And so whenever he does not go to the door,

[02:43] the door is open for him.

[02:44] Number three is that CPG makes a ton of sense for him

[02:46] because so many people eat chocolate,

[02:48] eat chips, eat pretzels,

[02:50] and a lot of those people are in his audience.

[02:52] Right now, feastables is probably gonna

[02:54] pay $3 to $400 million this year in sales.

[02:56] Manufacturing the chocolate bars, your chips or water

[02:59] is not overwhelmingly complex compared to making a software

[03:04] or an app or something like that.

[03:05] What we are seeing with feastables just with chocolate

[03:07] is a drop in the bucket compared to how big this brand

[03:11] will be once he enters bigger, more profitable categories.

[03:14] And what I mean by that is,

[03:15] how many chocolate bars do you average person by a week?

[03:18] Now, how many sports beverages or water

[03:22] do people consume per week and purchase per week,

[03:25] significantly more?

[03:26] And so if he goes into those categories,

[03:28] even if the same number of people purchase,

[03:30] get 10 times the revenue is currently getting

[03:32] with chocolate bars.

[03:33] And right now, he's selling out faster than any other brand.

[03:35] My team had to go to a really different grocery stores

[03:37] and we still couldn't find these nuts

[03:39] because they're sold out almost everywhere.

[03:41] He's taking up more shelf space

[03:42] and pushing through his product at a faster rate

[03:45] than any other brand on the category.

[03:47] It's been absurd.

[03:48] Face whatever I thought we were gonna sell

[03:50] we're doing like five times better.

[03:51] It's kind of shifted by whole mindset.

[03:53] Like retail space when you have a brand this big,

[03:55] it's just so OP.

[03:56] If you have realized the power of CPG

[03:59] and the reason that it's so powerful

[04:01] in the influencer space is that most people don't have

[04:04] incredibly strong affinity to the brands

[04:05] that they consume.

[04:06] Most brands are really old.

[04:08] They just like have been drinking it

[04:09] because they've always drank it.

[04:10] Not because they actually made a conscious decision.

[04:12] I could go stand in any Walmart in America

[04:14] and I would have to take 100 photos.

[04:15] So those same people when they go into Walmart

[04:18] will buy my products.

[04:19] It's just because people are like,

[04:20] oh, it's that guy from YouTube and they buy it.

[04:22] But as soon as one of the influencers

[04:24] that you saw come up and that you are a fan of

[04:26] or even recognize, you'll be more likely to take it.

[04:29] Currently, these work out at 2 pound 90 per bar

[04:32] which is obviously more expensive

[04:33] than you obviously might have chocolate.

[04:35] Oh, it smells good.

[04:36] And maybe even pay a little bit of a premium on top

[04:39] of the Commodal Dice product.

[04:40] And you can measure the strength of a brand

[04:42] based on how much of a premium you can charge

[04:44] on a commoditized product.

[04:45] If I have two white t-shirts

[04:47] and one of them has an LV logo on it

[04:50] and this one can go for $100 and this one goes for $1

[04:53] then I have significant branding

[04:55] and pricing powers result of that.

[04:57] Well, right now the rich is made in the world.

[04:58] Bernard Arno owns the sprints

[05:00] and a zillion other luxury brands

[05:02] because he understands the pricing power of brand.

[05:05] And those gross profits that you can generate

[05:07] for selling the same thing is what you can then reinvest

[05:11] in innovation, staying ahead

[05:13] and marketing even more to reinforce the brand.

[05:15] And that's what becomes the brand FI wheel.

[05:17] Is that you create a little bit of a premium.

[05:21] You make the spread.

[05:22] You reinvest that into the branding itself.

[05:25] Then that reinforces the brand.

[05:26] You can raise the price more, increase the spread

[05:29] and then around and around you go.

[05:30] And so you have this incredibly strong brand

[05:32] that's established that consumers in general

[05:34] are willing to pay more for.

[05:35] Number four is that he's able to monetize

[05:37] the widest base of his audience.

[05:38] At the most basic level,

[05:39] every single person who views his video

[05:40] he gets so many of them.

[05:41] His media, his content touches the broadest audience

[05:45] which is simply entertainment.

[05:46] Everybody can watch Mr. Beast's content.

[05:48] And so his products, as a consequence,

[05:52] he gets to reach everyone with what he sells.

[05:54] But what's the level underneath of that?

[05:55] If someone paid Mr. Beast for an integrated ad

[05:58] inside one of his videos.

[05:59] We have a very serious problem.

[06:01] My mom is currently online shopping

[06:03] and I don't think she has honey installed on her computer.

[06:06] They believe they're gonna make significantly

[06:07] more than they paid him off of that ad.

[06:09] He would then make more money promoting his own thing

[06:12] and make up the arbitrage.

[06:14] You have to try these nuts.

[06:15] So if someone gets 10 to one or 20 to one

[06:18] by paying him $20 million a year to market their thing,

[06:21] then it means that he might be able to get

[06:23] 200 million or 400 million a year marketing his thing

[06:26] because it stays within the brand.

[06:28] And it's congruent.

[06:29] Number five is that Jim is smart enough

[06:32] to know that he doesn't know everything.

[06:34] For the most part, I don't know what I'm doing.

[06:35] Trying to absorb knowledge as much as possible.

[06:37] I'll just call people.

[06:38] I'll be like, I don't know what I'm gonna learn off you.

[06:40] I'll do everything I can to add value to you.

[06:42] And they exchange, just teach me everything.

[06:44] You know, like people look just wanna stack business.

[06:46] And I'm doing that like the five hours a day.

[06:47] It's actually really hard for me to imagine being one

[06:49] of the most popular people on planet Earth

[06:51] in your early 20s and not letting that get to your head.

[06:54] And having had many conversations with him,

[06:57] he's confident that he can kill it,

[06:59] but he's incredibly open-minded

[07:00] to listening to people who he feels has expertise outside

[07:03] of what he has mastered.

[07:04] He hits up people, anyone who he thinks he can learn

[07:07] anything from.

[07:08] And he doesn't judge the fact that he's further ahead

[07:11] than some business people because think about this.

[07:12] If he raised at one and a half delay

[07:14] and one point six or whatever it was for Beast Industries,

[07:17] he's technically a billionaire on paper.

[07:19] Why would he talk to somebody who's not a billionaire

[07:21] on paper?

[07:22] Because he still feels like there are things

[07:23] that he can learn from them

[07:24] and then implement into his machine

[07:26] and instantly get to 10 or 50 or 100.

[07:29] He still texts thumbnail where his videos

[07:31] to some of his close buddies just to get their feedback

[07:33] because at the end of the day,

[07:35] he cares about winning more than being right.

[07:37] Number six is that he's trying to hire a God squad

[07:39] and he's doing it aggressively.

[07:40] So he wants the Avengers of business

[07:44] and content to be on his team in house.

[07:47] A symbol.

[07:48] He will do whatever it takes to in no matter what.

[07:50] He gets people to move in with him in his house

[07:52] so that he can indoctrinate them

[07:53] into the Mr. Beast Way of doing things

[07:54] which is just win it all costs without hurting anyone

[07:57] and do good while you do it.

[07:58] Smart people recognize the fact that he's growing like crazy

[08:02] and they wanna get on the ship.

[08:04] Number seven is that it's amazing how collaborative

[08:07] rather than competitive he is.

[08:08] Now don't get me wrong.

[08:09] He's super competitive as a person

[08:11] but I think a lot of his him against him

[08:13] but he's willing to collaborate with other creators

[08:15] rather than cut them down.

[08:16] He helps you a lot on their first channel

[08:18] with no subscribers.

[08:19] He does TikTok videos with TikTokers

[08:21] that aren't nearly as big as him.

[08:23] T-C is the world as larger than a zero-sum game.

[08:25] Meaning we can just both win.

[08:27] And I think that's actually been one of his

[08:29] low key secret to success is because early on

[08:31] he was masterminding with all these guys

[08:34] who are all together trying to get millions of subscribers

[08:37] and all of them did.

[08:38] We all super small YouTubers.

[08:40] And we basically talked every day for a thousand days in a row

[08:43] and did nothing but just like hyper study

[08:46] like what makes a good video,

[08:47] what makes a good thumbnail, what's good pacing,

[08:49] like how to go viral.

[08:51] And we just call it like daily masterminds.

[08:53] Now this is me just putting my theoretical head on.

[08:55] But I'll bet that him seeing that all of them could win

[09:00] when they all worked together

[09:01] and they all won faster and bigger

[09:03] than if they worked on their own.

[09:05] Probably change the way he saw the world

[09:09] in terms of how he creates and how everyone can win together.

[09:12] And number eight is that Jim is playing an infinite game.

[09:14] And what I mean by that is that he's in the game

[09:17] to play the game.

[09:18] By any stretch, he doesn't need money anymore.

[09:20] And if you lost everything tomorrow,

[09:22] he would still make YouTube videos.

[09:24] And the reason I know that is because when he had nothing,

[09:26] he made YouTube videos.

[09:27] I'm always gonna make a video.

[09:28] You're always gonna make a video.

[09:29] 100% that I'm stupid.

[09:30] And then also I just like,

[09:32] I'm like,

[09:32] purgther this thing.

[09:34] All right, I have 30 years of my life.

[09:35] I don't care.

[09:36] When I look at you, like a parallel storyline

[09:38] where I wonder, will he ever stop making videos?

[09:41] Is he 25 now?

[09:42] I don't know.

[09:43] 10 years from now I'm like, you know, I'm 30.

[09:44] Tell 10 years from now if you're getting started.

[09:46] And because you've placed the game that way,

[09:48] he's gonna have one of the biggest pieces of leverage

[09:50] that everyone under plays, which is time.

[09:53] He's already got almost a decade of experience under his belt

[09:56] in his low 20s.

[09:57] In terms of like, archboring our years,

[09:59] he's actually older than people given credit for.

[10:01] But still has 60, 70 years ahead of him

[10:06] where he can continue to compound that.

[10:08] He's just getting started.

[10:09] And he's a master of content.

[10:11] And over the next decade he'll become a master of business.

[10:15] Now, let's talk about what that means from evaluation

[10:18] perspective.

[10:19] A company that's fast growing that has significantly

[10:22] better margins because they don't have nearly

[10:23] the marketing costs because most times

[10:25] when the biggest costs in them is inventory and marketing.

[10:28] And so if you can cut out an entire massive costs

[10:31] in the center and get instant national recognition

[10:34] or international recognition,

[10:36] the potential of the brand day one already

[10:39] becomes a billion, 10 billion, et cetera.

[10:41] And for that reason, I think that Mr. Beast

[10:44] will be a sense of billionaire.

[10:46] And it's also because he has so much time to do it.

[10:48] All right, so I'm gonna enjoy a nice,

[10:50] Mr. Beast, Feastable Soccer Bar,

[10:52] while I watch $1 versus $1 billion yacht.

[10:55] And after stepping on board,

[10:57] he was pretty clear why this yacht only cost $1.

[11:00] If you have to ask how much it costs to carry a yacht,

[11:03] you can't afford it.

[11:04] You crack a windshield, it's like there's 200 grand.

[11:06] I don't need this giant ship all of myself.

[11:09] So I wanted to share this experience with you guys.

[11:11] My subscriber.

[11:12] This is just great.

[11:15] You know, I'm gonna make some interesting stuff

[11:16] and he's able to find humor in everyday things.

[11:19] And I always know like, man, I'm like,

[11:21] I gotta be better.

[11:22] What are you eating, Tom?

[11:24] I'm gonna chore.

[11:25] You used to be a multi.

[11:26] If you liked this video, then you're allowed the next video,

[11:29] how you can get rich in the new economy

[11:30] breaking down.

[11:31] Kylie Jenner, Mr. Beast, the rock, and many others

[11:34] that are capitalizing on this huge influencer waves.

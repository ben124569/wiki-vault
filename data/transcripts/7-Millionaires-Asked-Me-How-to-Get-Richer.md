[00:00] Everybody in this room is making between $1 million per year and $12 million per year.

[00:04] And we just talked for the last 60 minutes on how to scale their business.

[00:07] Enjoy. All right. So you got an Ropathy.

[00:09] We do a 5 million year. What's the model?

[00:11] Done for you.

[00:12] Settling.

[00:13] Okay.

[00:14] Legion.

[00:15] Okay.

[00:15] Is that local?

[00:16] Ropathy stuff?

[00:17] Yeah.

[00:18] So there's diabetic dinners and all that.

[00:19] Jess.

[00:20] Dinner is in.

[00:20] Yeah.

[00:21] Yeah.

[00:21] I remember the model.

[00:22] Okay.

[00:23] Um.

[00:24] So then what's the, what's the, what's the big play?

[00:28] Um, our,

[00:30] were, were niche pretty well.

[00:31] Like I think, well,

[00:32] possibly the biggest in our smidge.

[00:35] Um, it's a smaller group meeting like there's maybe 2000

[00:39] bakters that do you know,

[00:40] Ropathy specifically?

[00:41] Yeah.

[00:42] So, and we have 160 of them.

[00:45] So it's not, they were still,

[00:46] they're still a huge potential for us to,

[00:48] I think we get 300 or 500 or 1000 maybe.

[00:51] I don't know.

[00:52] What's the angle for you?

[00:53] Um.

[00:54] Um, I'm, I'm just cash.

[00:59] Okay.

[00:59] Yeah.

[01:00] No, I asked because it's like,

[01:01] is it to build it to sell it?

[01:03] Is it to have?

[01:04] Yeah.

[01:04] I mean, I think selling would be cool.

[01:06] It has to be,

[01:07] how it had to go to different verticals.

[01:08] I mean, I like,

[01:10] I'm way too risky on the checklist.

[01:13] Oh, not necessarily.

[01:14] I mean, because the thing is,

[01:16] is like the, the ultimate version of the model that you have,

[01:19] is like you've got 160 out of like 2000

[01:22] or about three clinics, right?

[01:23] So you've got like pretty decent,

[01:24] you know, you've got whatever that is 8%

[01:27] of that like pseudo, more of like niche of a niche of a niche market.

[01:30] But those guys make,

[01:31] how much these, these guys make a year?

[01:33] Like, um,

[01:35] between a million and five million.

[01:38] Right.

[01:38] And so this is where this gets like way more interesting.

[01:41] I might pen it.

[01:42] So it's like, you've got 320 million here.

[01:43] I'm just using average, right?

[01:45] Per year that you're driving and revenue.

[01:48] And it's like, man,

[01:50] I'm making five.

[01:52] I'm like this sucks, right?

[01:54] Of that.

[01:55] You're like, how are going to get more of that?

[01:58] Yeah.

[01:58] Um, and so the thing is like,

[02:01] I think the ultimate version for like the,

[02:04] the quote,

[02:05] info and agency space that I know those are different things,

[02:08] but fundamentally the surf niche,

[02:09] niche avatars that are B2B.

[02:11] Um,

[02:12] the ultimate version of those businesses is roll ups

[02:16] of the, the customers you serve.

[02:19] Because if you think of it, like a roll up does,

[02:20] I don't know if I'm going to be wrong with it.

[02:21] But like, you get everyone on the same marketing.

[02:26] You get everyone on the same price points.

[02:28] You get everyone on the same packages.

[02:29] You guess basically you consolidate whatever

[02:31] everyone's operations are.

[02:32] And that's what the majority of super-nage agencies

[02:35] and kind of info consulting with everyone to call it.

[02:38] Do with businesses.

[02:40] So they do all the heavy work of integration

[02:42] for what a roll up would do.

[02:43] And then they just say like, okay, I'll stop there.

[02:45] I just want like,

[02:46] actually push it over the edge and the monetize all things.

[02:49] And so like, most of the physicians that I know hate being physicians,

[02:55] they do it purely to make money and want to be out of it as soon as possible.

[02:59] And so like selling them on the idea that like, okay,

[03:01] your practice does, you know,

[03:03] whatever, two and a half million year of top line

[03:06] and whatever, one million in profit.

[03:10] That's awesome.

[03:11] And then you have your, you know, taxes that you're taking home 600K,

[03:14] you're after that.

[03:16] That's great.

[03:17] But what if, and on your own, this thing could maybe sell for,

[03:22] I don't know, 3 million bucks, maybe, like maybe,

[03:26] if you're really, you know, we're being really generous.

[03:29] But if you were part of a group of physicians that were a neropathy,

[03:33] you know, thing nationwide, we could probably sell for like,

[03:36] you're playing could probably sell for 10 million.

[03:38] And so all I'm asking for is a, you know, 20 to 30% slice of that.

[03:44] But times 160.

[03:48] And so obviously of the 160 wouldn't do it with all of them.

[03:50] I mean, if you did, that would be a monster deal.

[03:52] But like, if you could get like 10 or 20 of them to roll together,

[03:55] because they all probably do have enough, like, enough profit together

[03:58] to be meaningful.

[03:59] So it's like, if you can get the roll up to be like 10 to 20 million dollars

[04:02] in terms of profit, that would be a meaningful exit.

[04:05] That would be probably like a $100 to $200 exit.

[04:09] And you have 20 to 30% of that.

[04:10] But then after that point, you're now the guy who did that.

[04:13] And so then your reputation changes, your dynamic change around pricing,

[04:16] your long term stick, all that kind of stuff changes, because it's like,

[04:18] oh, I'm the guy that can get you to hear.

[04:20] And that's also the like, get rich and if you have to do this again,

[04:25] just a much more compelling offer.

[04:26] Can I ask you a second question?

[04:27] You guys, uh, we used to switch to licensing.

[04:32] Because I remember I know OG flying around and then more or less OG,

[04:37] they were flying around for you.

[04:39] And then more recent, them doing it for for themselves.

[04:43] Right, and I gave them the ads that we tested.

[04:45] Right. So the transition for you from doing it for them to doing it,

[04:52] to have them doing it themselves and you being a coach.

[04:54] Yeah.

[04:55] Does that would never use that word, but yeah.

[04:57] Yeah. Does that work?

[04:59] Do you think that that looking back, would you, would you,

[05:02] had done it that exact same way?

[05:04] Would you switch to licensing model and like,

[05:06] and is that what you're calling licensing?

[05:07] Yeah.

[05:08] I mean, because like, we had ads that we would test every month,

[05:11] and then we would just let everybody else use them.

[05:13] And tons of people tried to use them that weren't art because they would copy the gyms that we had

[05:17] ads. And they'd like, I'd have ads, gyms using my face,

[05:21] trying to add for their gym.

[05:22] It happened all the time.

[05:23] So, um, what I do the model we had again, yes.

[05:28] The reason that we didn't do done for you was two things.

[05:32] One is, are like, the reason do it yourself for your advertising work is that they make too much money.

[05:39] A gym owner, the value of learning the skill exceeds their current skill.

[05:43] It makes more sense for somebody who makes 35,000 or easier to learn how to market

[05:48] in cell, and somebody who makes a million dollars here or how to market cell.

[05:50] They've already leveled out of that.

[05:52] In terms of like, because they can pay somebody less than they make

[05:55] to do this for them, where it's a gym owner can't.

[05:57] It makes sense for them to learn that skill.

[06:00] And then from the reason I didn't do it roll-up is because

[06:03] group-based service, there's zero, there's zero market for it, no one wants to buy them.

[06:08] If I had been in a market where people were buying for sure, I would be, I would have been the model I would do.

[06:15] Yeah, I'd respect for, yeah, I'm going to rock and roll with that make sense.

[06:18] So, yeah, so we do permanent holiday lighting for the it's for an office mark phone.

[06:23] That on homes of businesses.

[06:25] My question I guess would be, our guess our constraints, we have no revenue retention.

[06:31] And so we've dabbled with, you know, maybe doing like a maintenance plan, you know,

[06:37] upset people things like that, or, you know, having paid subscriptions in our app.

[06:42] So who's your customer most of the time?

[06:44] It's kind of a, it's a healthy split between like elderly and then my people want to keep

[06:48] over the gym.

[06:50] Okay, and so the way, so tell me more about like, tell me more a little bit more of the

[06:53] progress I would better understand it a bit.

[06:55] Yeah, so basically we installed aluminum tracks system under their existing

[07:00] soft and scat LEDs.

[07:02] And so you can do any holiday game day or accent lighting.

[07:05] Is that like the Phillips shoe type, type deal?

[07:08] I don't want to like over simplify where I'm saying I just want to make sure I understand it.

[07:11] It's kind of like that.

[07:12] This is not much bigger.

[07:13] Cooler.

[07:15] What's the average ticket?

[07:16] Uh, about five thousand.

[07:17] Okay, how do you get customers?

[07:19] Um, so you're basically looking like a met at ads.

[07:22] But ads, you didn't pay ads in your local?

[07:24] Yeah.

[07:25] Okay, got it.

[07:26] How many locations?

[07:27] Just one.

[07:27] Okay, one location, what are margins?

[07:30] Um,

[07:32] what about 60% depends on the season?

[07:37] So you make, you make a million bucks.

[07:38] You keep 600?

[07:39] No, well, the beach I talked about, 51.

[07:42] Okay, great, you're doing half awesome.

[07:43] What's the cac?

[07:46] 300.

[07:47] 300 bucks for 5,000 LTV.

[07:49] That's great.

[07:50] Okay, so um, so a couple of things.

[07:53] So if you want to get revenue retention, um, you want to measure how long you've been in business?

[07:58] So I've been with the company for a year.

[08:00] Okay, that to use for sure was just, you know, then products out and so.

[08:04] Got it.

[08:05] But do you own it?

[08:06] Yeah.

[08:06] Okay, got it.

[08:07] Okay, so you've been with the company side was like, I don't know what that means.

[08:10] I've been with the acquisition.com as well.

[08:12] Um, um, okay, so, uh, so again,

[08:17] if you think about this from a revenue retention perspective, um, one is, is there,

[08:22] so you install this thing for the lighting?

[08:25] Um, what else do those people want?

[08:29] Like, is there anything else you can add on top of it?

[08:32] Because like you have to keep in with up with the Jones, I'm sure that during certain seasons,

[08:35] they want to do other, razzled asle things.

[08:39] And so like, you can, you can assemble and then disassemble things multiple times a year, uh,

[08:44] for seasons, for sewer roles, for things like that.

[08:46] I don't know if that's too different from the type of lighting that you currently do.

[08:49] But like, it's not too different.

[08:51] Now I get people asking all the time, I'll fold either trees or fold it, you know,

[08:54] Yeah, except it's not permanent.

[08:56] Yeah, so I would see the in permanent lighting as like you run two to three seasonal campaigns a year.

[09:03] So I'll bet your Easter would be one if you're in Utah.

[09:05] I'm sure that'll be big Christmas, so obviously they big in Utah.

[09:08] Um, and then you know, pick your third date.

[09:11] Maybe maybe Halloween's not as big in Utah.

[09:13] Um, I don't know.

[09:15] I just, I'm just messing around.

[09:17] Um, but even if you had, you know, one or two cracks at the apple, um,

[09:22] cracks at the apple, whatever bites at the apple.

[09:24] Every year on top of that, that keeps you top of mind and then like when you go, they're like,

[09:28] hey, we all should do it like we'll do a standard double checks, everything working okay with the

[09:31] lights.

[09:31] It gives you upstop opportunities, but you still like generate other revenue.

[09:34] And then when they went to a place that's like, hey, I'd say about the new lights because these ones

[09:37] were old now. The new ones are, oh my god, let me tell you, let me show this thing on my phone.

[09:41] I did for your neighbor Susan down the road.

[09:43] Herzlook's sick.

[09:44] Didn't know if you're interested in that.

[09:46] Um, so it's like those become upstop opportunities.

[09:48] And instead of saying like it's, um, recurring, it becomes reoccurring.

[09:54] So it's slightly different. So like Coca-Cola has no recurring,

[09:56] basically no recurring members, uh, member like memberships, but we buy Coca-Cola products at the time.

[10:02] We so we have reoccurring. It's reliable revenue.

[10:04] It's just not on a membership or subscription.

[10:06] And so basically all you have to demonstrate to make the company a lot more valuable,

[10:11] is simply having the data to track that we sell a customer for lights and we sell one out of two,

[10:16] another thing every year, whether that's an upgrade, um, maintenance fix or it's

[10:23] lights that we do for seasons. Like if we can just show that half the people continue to buy

[10:27] for something from us every year, that still makes it very valuable business.

[10:31] Does that make sense? That would be it.

[10:33] So my name's Cameron. Uh, we do residential real estate flipping in the state of Missouri.

[10:40] Uh, we did 15 million revenue last year for 3.7, um, gross before overhead.

[10:46] So 2.5 after you're taking to account our team.

[10:49] It's the team. I mean like the how much the houses were when you sold them and then the

[10:54] three million dollars. Yeah, I was like half sales price.

[10:57] Got it. The profit on each project was 3.7, which is it helps us tell how well we're doing

[11:02] on the projects and then you take our team and you end up with 2.5, like, even I guess.

[11:09] I was trying to think of the constraint all week. You know, uh, zero revenue retention got

[11:13] highlighted and nothing to think. But for us, I think it's going to be that I would

[11:19] we've kind of captured the market. We can capture which for what we do is a driving radius.

[11:25] Like we, I would say dominated within four hours of where we're at, which is like you drive four

[11:32] hours to a house to evaluate it and four hours back, your day is going. Yeah.

[11:36] Oh, and so we're kind of at a closer pivot moment of like, do we, we do know advertising

[11:42] to 95% for closures and they like a few word of mouth. So do we pivot? Would you say to

[11:50] the rest of Missouri, like almost franchise out, like get four little, like find other big cities

[11:55] and try to get the rest of Missouri. There's by like four quadrants or would you go into marketing?

[12:00] Because I know I'm doing 95% for closures. It's like we don't control our income of, like,

[12:06] properties whatsoever and we kind of have like that that one funnel. And like, if four

[12:11] clothes, like if the economy gets good, then you have no deal flow kind of. Exactly. And so

[12:15] now you're like constant. We're on through COVID. Four closing was literally illegal in Missouri.

[12:20] And we made 2.7 that year. So somehow we made it happen. Like you said, it's just a lot for

[12:24] skin harder. But there's ways. So I don't know if it's a push or a pivot. I would say that's our

[12:30] main case. There's things we can improve on, but that's like the one that keeps us up a night.

[12:34] So let me just say what's the goal?

[12:36] We have a mission statement and it's to make sure that all houses within our reach are at their

[12:44] highest and best value because we don't see a house falling off the market as a good thing that just

[12:48] makes other real estate more expensive. I know the goal is not necessarily to ever sell. So it would

[12:55] probably be to expand, I guess. Okay. So so, you know, path one is you just go to another city.

[13:03] And I would necessarily call it franchising. You just expand. It's just like opening another lighting thing.

[13:07] Like that's just the normal way of things. Like if you just get better and better at it, you open another location.

[13:14] I see that as another set of skills for you, which I think will be valuable.

[13:19] And you could, and this time, like if it's basically there's no point, I mean, you could go in

[13:24] Missouri, but you could also do any other market that you'd want because if you're, if you're

[13:29] going past four hours of driving, now you're in like flying range in which case pick the right

[13:34] city, you know, like pick whatever city you want to go to. You'll also go into a city that's going to

[13:39] probably have competitors. You know what I mean? Which I see is a good thing because it means like the

[13:44] more competitors, there are the more of a market there is. As long as you're, you know, number one

[13:49] then more for you. And so that's that's how I, that's at least my perception. Like when

[13:55] everyone like, oh, there's a ton of competition in my market, I'm like that's awesome. I mean,

[13:58] there's tons of buyers. And so just side note there. But because the alternative of this is like

[14:05] literally changing the entirety of your business. Exactly. Which I would, I would, like you're doing

[14:09] well with it, how long you been doing this? I've been doing it for eight years. Yeah, you've already

[14:14] paid down like all the ignorance debt. So like you're at this point, you're like, you're like here

[14:19] on your curve, like you're like right here. And so it's like, well, don't, don't jump back down to like

[14:24] here again. Right? Okay, there. Like there's an ultimate version of this. And so what's the,

[14:31] who's the biggest wholesaler in the nation? The biggest wholesaler in the nation is it

[14:35] we buy ugly houses probably. I mean, there's a lot of them. Okay. So what do they do that you don't

[14:42] do? Um, a lot of advertising, a ton of advertising paid for click. The Taylor's is huge billboards.

[14:52] We do not. Yeah. So I'll bet that there's still way more deals even probably even within your current

[14:59] market. And so I would probably, if I reuse either either you have to replicate where you're

[15:06] currently doing in a new market. But you have some of the risks that you've already brought up,

[15:09] which is like you're all in bound based on foreclosures, you have some of these other things

[15:12] you're not real. Like the income is not necessarily real-life. Um, I would definitely learn the

[15:18] advertising stuff for your own business. Because like whenever there's an ultimate version of the

[15:22] business that I'm currently in, it's like they already did it. And so now all I have to do is do it

[15:27] better than them. And whoever built that business is already gone probably. And so it's just a bunch of

[15:32] suits who don't know how this business works. And so it's just right for us to just murder them.

[15:37] I'm just being, I'm just being super honest like this high see it. Um, and so I think I would just

[15:41] like go 100% try and pants them and do PVC bed. And like also do some of the stuff they're

[15:48] probably not doing well. They probably aren't doing social while they probably aren't running.

[15:51] Like not as well as they could. Obviously they're billboards. I know the billboards that they run.

[15:56] And but I'll bet you they've got great sales training. And I bet you've got they've got great

[16:00] floors of people and kind of infrastructure in place. And so I would look at that I would look at

[16:06] their overarching model as well. Because I'll bet you they get a piece on the back end as well.

[16:11] Like because they probably vertically integrate as much as they possibly could

[16:14] um, within business. So that they actually make more in every deal than you do. So they can spend

[16:17] more on every deal. Like they can pay more like so they have they have ways to beat

[16:22] other people in all these different markets because they're national. Right. And so

[16:28] step one would be start advertising more because then that was immediately make more with

[16:33] your current market. Like that would just that might double your business if you just did that.

[16:37] Um, and then number two is out and I'll analyze the living hell out of them.

[16:41] Like that's what I would. And then think about like, okay, this is this is the future version

[16:45] of my business. One, can I replicate it to is there anything I can do to make it better?

[16:49] 100%. I definitely wouldn't change my business.

[16:52] For sure. I think that I think your advice is dead on it's just what I'm afraid to do.

[16:56] Because I don't want to do it. It's like I'll just go do it in different cities. But I guess I

[17:00] got to learn new things. Yeah. Yeah. Don't. Right. Yeah. Well maybe we can know.

[17:06] It's about. So I'm Joel. I was CPA current. They said a big school crowd for me. But during

[17:13] COVID we went virtual. So now we serve all 50 states. I have a lot of constraints. But I think,

[17:20] you know, my questions would be, you know, how do you prioritize which revenue revenue is last year.

[17:26] It was 2.5 this year. It's probably going to be about 3 also. Margins last year. 900,000 this year.

[17:33] And that was the part of the 1.1. Awesome. Arnold. Good. I mean you run in 30% of margins on it.

[17:43] Yeah. I mean, yeah. So I think it's a super reliable business. It's a valuable business.

[17:50] Like accounting firms get rolled up left and right. There's tons of buyer activity there.

[17:54] Like it's very people don't turn out their accounts. I mean, it's like it's very sticky.

[18:00] There's high LTV. The issue with accounting is most of the times there's no one in there who knows how to market and sell.

[18:07] That's usually the issue with accounting businesses. It's like all word of mouth and no one knows how to like market.

[18:13] And then the other issue is that is getting good accounts because there's so much demand for decent accounts.

[18:19] And so, but like the accounting firms that I know of like all have like anybody who comes here with accounting firm almost always makes money. They're all doing well.

[18:28] So there's big demand. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. So what's the issue?

[18:32] I guess one would be operations.

[18:38] Making sure our clients are satisfied. Like we have a short period of time to do all of our work mostly.

[18:43] Yeah. The tax isn't right. So we get.

[18:45] Clients have certain expectations and your tax returns down and we're at the past city. But then

[18:52] you know obviously they don't want to pay a premium sometimes. I think you've been through our sales process to make sure

[18:57] that charge a premium to give that value of their revenue. So do you mostly have one time a year or customers?

[19:04] Or what? Usually we charge quarterly for cori tax planning. Is it more businesses or more individuals?

[19:11] Businesses. Oh great. Okay. Well that's I mean even better. Yeah.

[19:15] Yeah. Or maybe our minimum fee right now is 1950 or quarter. Okay. What's your annual stick?

[19:22] Kind of stick with your revenue term. What's your revenue term? I know. It's not as good as I like it to be.

[19:27] I probably say we keep at least 70%. Okay. You probably want to get over 80. I mean for accounting firms.

[19:34] Like you probably can do a little better. Yeah. So I think it has to do with just also making sure the clients

[19:39] to the value. Because after you have like certain tax strategies, they're kind of like,

[19:43] oh I kind of learned this now. I can find a cheaper account sometimes. So even though there is that stickiness.

[19:49] You know they're especially some business owners. Well good. I'm not kind of solid value.

[19:53] What you guys did last time. I'm not sure I buy that. I think what someone says on the exit versus

[19:58] why they actually cancel aren't necessarily the same thing. Because like I already got the value is like

[20:03] literally whatever one says when they want to leave anything and it's just because like they just want to leave.

[20:08] Because I mean I mean you want to I mean fundamentally from an accounting one somebody who will get you to pay

[20:14] a few taxes seemingly possible and keep you out of jail. And that's pretty much that's pretty much the that's the task.

[20:21] And make it as little work for you seemingly possible for that to occur. And so

[20:29] I mean just me having been a consumer of many different accounting firms and accountants and employees who

[20:34] work, you know, to do that stuff for us. I don't I don't buy that like we taught them the two or three tricks.

[20:41] Yeah. Also I bet you a bunch of your business owners aren't even like close to it. Some of them are

[20:48] bigger and like aren't they're just like yeah just pay the bill. I don't really care. Just make sure it's right.

[20:52] So I would bet that you probably have bad onboarding.

[20:56] Okay. So basically the aspect the basic the doubts of between what they're sold and then what their

[21:00] experiences and the first handful of days and weeks going into it and then the communication cadence between

[21:07] touch bases they probably see limited value there. And so I think I would give you the same kind of

[21:13] be like if I were like by 100% business tomorrow I would audit the sales process to hand off.

[21:18] Like I would bet you there's a massive amount of opportunity there in terms of like

[21:21] how can you take more notes on every customer because I get pissed off if I feel like I'm talking

[21:25] to somebody they don't know much about my business and I'm paying the eight thousand dollars

[21:28] you to real my taxes. Immediately I'd be like oh yeah fuck you. Like I know you can't be looking

[21:34] at like I can just do back if napkin brain math of like if you barely know who I am you definitely

[21:40] don't know how to save me money on my taxes. Right. I would do have an onboarding process but

[21:45] there might be a disconnect between the sales. Well we already know there's a disconnect in your

[21:49] set there was. So this is me this is me trying to help. So I would go really deep on the onboarding

[21:55] process which is like how can I really tighten this up both in terms of the personalization of

[21:59] the communication and how can I speed up the number of times you communicate with them because you want

[22:04] frequent communication as long as like it's pushed. So it's not me asking for each shift because

[22:09] then I fucking hate you. Right. But if it's like hey just like you know we ran this today this thing

[22:16] is moving forward everything's good enough and for me just keep me in the loop and then two days later

[22:20] hey we also ran this thing xyz is done and it's moving forward to the next I'd be like I was

[22:25] at their doing stuff. And so like I tell this to everybody but no one does it and so this is me

[22:29] telling you and hopefully you will do it. But like if you do a hundred things you want to let them

[22:33] know every time you're doing one of those things on their behalf and they're like do these guys

[22:37] are working for me all the time like this guy works his ass off and then someone else is like well

[22:42] they're doing it for eight thousand I'll do it for six and they're like oh no these guys

[22:46] work their asses off for me like I'm sure I'm safe like no one actually knows it's kind of like

[22:50] when the guy comes to your house like especially the nicer the neighborhood you live in you know this

[22:55] like he's like they got you to the lighting for a 10 grand I'm like do you think I got this

[23:00] house because I let people rip me off I was like give me the rope rice and then it's like

[23:04] I can do it for four you're like great you know or whatever and so the thing is is like no one really knows

[23:10] they just they just gut call on the fact that like my communication with this company's been

[23:14] crappy the extraditions are poor and so if this is my external experience I'll bet you they're not

[23:19] crossing their teas and doubting their eyes on my taxes that would be my guess and so I think if you get

[23:25] all of the other stuff tight they will just guess that your internal stuff says tight which I hope it is

[23:31] and I'll bet you that'll keep this deck honestly and of course count on stone to how to do

[23:36] with customers I'll bet you probably need to train them again on that communication cadence

[23:40] so basically we were personalized we were freaking communication and then probably very tight training

[23:45] on how to have touchpoint calls with the customers right or clients for sure

[23:53] that would be like the number of things I would do anything else I mean do you think it's scalable too

[23:56] because I mean my biggest yes accounting firms are scalable EY KPMG like yes there's scalable price

[24:02] yeah PWC those are publicly trading accounting firms yes there's scalable what do you think about

[24:09] like one of the you mentioned I think yes yesterday is like you know the size of the brain the

[24:15] biggest brain is I was big as you know so I'm sorry to know how to hire people that are smart

[24:20] me another area like but when it comes to accounting I'm still like the smartest person yeah

[24:26] there's smarter account I don't say this is a slide I just say like look at the guys I keep

[24:29] like there's some smart dudes yeah I mean I kind of want to hire like I'm more of a CEO than I

[24:33] have a tax nerd yeah so rather hire like yeah go get a tax nerd yeah yeah you go recruit somebody

[24:40] from one of those companies who's like I need somebody worked at Enron who wasn't a bad guy

[24:45] you know what I mean and figure out like who can do like the real the crazy stuff who knows

[24:50] the tax like who reads tax law for fun yeah like that's who you need because there are dudes who

[24:55] do who are like oh curl up on I like I know a buddy of mine who literally goes to the pool

[25:01] with the tax law his kids are in the pool and he's reading it and I'm like what is wrong with you

[25:05] he's like I just love this stuff and I was like I'm glad someone does you know like and he's like

[25:10] look at this hole he's like oh I'm gonna crush this one and he's like he's like this is legal

[25:15] I like like he just like loves it's like he freemes like treasure hunting so like you need somebody who's

[25:19] like that and if that's not you then you should have somebody who is that way yeah for sure

[25:24] so yes I agree and I think you should do that I would say step one though fix all the outside stuff

[25:30] step two go get that guy because that stuff will make you more money today with what you already have

[25:35] then do the other thing right so newer tax company you helped in down sales teams and for their

[25:41] or eliminate those shares and prepare themselves often self efficiency I really didn't the most

[25:47] helpful thing for me would be just you running through really the major learning lessons you

[25:55] have from Alan in terms of rent life with my background as high-tech education and for the

[26:00] battle states and some I think cop you know do you have this technical co-founder okay how good is he

[26:07] I said 18 months five okay that could mean that it just took you really long to find somebody who's bad so like

[26:16] two years from now you're like I should know yeah um so it really comes down to like has this

[26:22] person built this all for coming before yeah okay cool so fundamentally like the entire game

[26:27] different than the high-tech game right like it's all about revenue retention it's all about

[26:31] word of mouth it's it's a product business there's actually a podcast I just made I don't even

[26:35] know when it's coming out about this but like what business are you really in and so like when I got

[26:40] into Alan I thought I was in the marketing and sales business because that was the business that I came

[26:43] from but you're actually in the product business so it has to be it has to be basically like

[26:49] taking to his national extreme if people don't stick with it it doesn't matter so basically marketing

[26:56] and doing everything else like it's irrelevant and so like unless that's right nothing else matters

[27:01] basically and so marketing sales in the front and literally only serves the purpose of making

[27:05] the product better until there's a point where it has what I would consider passive growth

[27:09] we're a grows on its own and then you gas the living hell out of it and then that's what makes

[27:13] resilient dollar companies like if you want low-churn you either have to go up market and find the

[27:20] people who don't turn out or you have to help create the people who don't turn so like the shop

[27:27] applies and spotify a lot of if eyes here there's going to be there's cohort turn which you're

[27:34] probably familiar with if you're co-founders in this so like you're going to have periods of

[27:39] time where it's like okay the first six months we turn out should 80% of our customers but the 20%

[27:44] after that point our retention curves flat and so you'd have to figure out once you get to that

[27:49] data cohort you're like okay what do these people look like and then you readjust the messaging

[27:53] readjust the marketing so you can get more and more of those people so you get a bigger bigger

[27:57] slice of them and finally that loop is what we more or less focus on and then I think about it from

[28:04] when I'm trying to reverse engineer the customer avatar it's like you have psychographics like

[28:08] what do they believe you have demographics what do they look like or are they from you have

[28:11] geographic sorry where are they and then you have kind of activities which is like what did they do

[28:17] so from trying to reverse engineer what the people who spend the most money with me look like

[28:22] I look through those those lenses who are they where are they from what do they believe what do they do

[28:28] and then I try and say in my ads hey I'm looking for people who believe these things I look in

[28:32] this place is that they're at and then once they're in I try and get them to do the same things that

[28:37] that people who were successful who look like them we talk like they believe like them did in order

[28:41] to be successful so like in the beginning you just do a ton of marketing to get traction in the

[28:46] door and that's literally just so you can like see if people like it see where they're turning out

[28:52] see get basically 20 feedback and then once you find what people are liking what they're

[28:56] successful with obviously iterate from a product perspective on the road map to do more of the

[29:00] stuff that core in terms of value but then the marketing side it loops back and then that's what

[29:04] informs who you're picking on the front end who you're marketing to. Right so you've been my

[29:09] personal civic yes or man totally caught people that that's to throw yes yes and the hard part is

[29:15] that your sales team won't want to do it and you will not want to say no to mine. Yeah but I

[29:22] understand what company perspective is thanks to the sell. But that's I mean fundamentally like

[29:27] if you look at Vista I I became friendly acquaintances with their their had a pricing and packaging

[29:33] and he was just like if you don't you know if Vista's so they're out of awesome 100 billion dollar

[29:38] private equity there they would be like the fifth biggest company like whatever they're massive

[29:43] and the only their private equity bill and they buy software companies and they triple them in

[29:49] in three years which is their goal and they flip them and so the founder I can't remember whose name

[29:53] I feel bad is anyways rich dude I'll split that way point being I'll talk to the head of packaging

[30:01] and he said you want to know our whole secret you know it's like what man he's like we just know

[30:04] our our acquired companies customers better than they did. What do you mean he's like so we go into

[30:10] the data room and we look at all the customers they have and we look at what channels they came from

[30:14] we look at who they are how they act all that stuff he's like then we turn off all the marketing

[30:19] that's not those customers and we crank the living hell out of stuff that is that and we do nothing

[30:23] else on the company troubles obviously it's more than that but fundamentally like big picture strategy

[30:29] that's what they do we get more of the people who spend the most money but people just aren't disciplined

[30:35] and that's why people just stay poor because then they they try and serve too many people too many

[30:39] different avatars they can't say no to money today so they don't get the big money tomorrow

[30:44] Oh appreciate that dude I am out of Alex DTC Fish and Brand Commerce in Indonesia from Indonesia

[30:52] doing 10 million dollars a year I picked up 3 million dollars we're doing this nine years

[30:59] thanks for making it out thank you how do I know when to expand new program

[31:03] what are you selling now what are you selling now you sure science genius jacket but mostly

[31:11] menswax is it what is it what label or brand is it your brand or is it your brand

[31:19] and the fact that I'm not manufacturer I saw conclude the other factory in Niger and I only

[31:25] on the office and the warehouse is it custom do you design it or you just slap your leg you design it

[31:31] you've been the house that are you pitch no that's fine I mean like hey I'm not I don't do competitions competition

[31:39] as long as you're not hacking their databases or anything like that's I mean that's the nature

[31:42] of the retail business I understand okay so the question that you have is how do how do you

[31:51] scale it or basically how do you add more and expand new product like let's say women's let's say

[31:57] sportswear because I'm doing casual only let's say formal I don't think it 10 million

[32:04] you need to like it's like you could do so much more even within that within that that demographic

[32:09] like if you're just mostly menswear like there's tons of massive menswear companies

[32:15] I'm thinking about that also because I have an achieve 200 or 300 million dollar yet

[32:22] isn't it will make my brand to menswear letter in life so I'm not building enough foundation

[32:29] the capture the woman's letter in 300 500 million dollar a month I've had a million a month that would be a lot

[32:44] it's a tough call man I'll be honest with you because like on one level I mean if you're like

[32:49] I want to build the next Nike then you don't have to sell to everybody but even Nike doesn't sell so it's

[32:55] right just like like there's so much like there's so many people who buy so much clothing

[33:02] and I mean I think so right now I think you're a little bit of like a brand identity spot like

[33:08] you obviously know how to convert I'm guessing are you running ads yeah right so you know like you know

[33:12] you know that game and you run really good margins I'm sure on the on the products based on and you

[33:16] can you know how to run run ads at scale and so what I think right now is you have to figure out who

[33:23] who you want to become as a brand so if you like menswear then like you can I think you can build a

[33:29] massive menswear company just being really transparent with you like you can build a massive

[33:35] menswear company also like Lou Lemon doesn't do I guess they have like pants that are nice but like

[33:41] they're all sportswear so like I mean Lou Lemon's a terrible example now because they're just gone

[33:45] to crap but like like if you look at these I like like I just is a framework for everybody like

[33:50] I look at what's the biggest version of the business that's currently here like what did they do

[33:55] to get there what does their business model look like and then how many steps between where I'm at

[33:59] and where they are do I need to take and like what lessons or what skills am I deficient in it

[34:05] and so then it's like okay well those skill deficiencies become the opportunity like fundamentally

[34:10] that's it and what their brand looks like and how they monetize like are they vertically integrated

[34:15] or like if I was getting into the energy vectoring business I'd be like okay well Red Bull has a

[34:19] lot of source literally everything besides marketing so I guess that might be the most important thing

[34:23] for a consumer package good that's you know RCD so ready to drink and distribution so it's like they

[34:28] have massive brand plays massive distribution you know they have their recipe underlock and key and

[34:34] everything else is so like basically I look at the brand like is there a brand that you want to

[34:39] emulate? Basically I'm a what problem I'm using and my solving is just a billion dollar exit building

[34:46] consulting from and then that is a little market to PE built media and then I'm told the Indonesia

[34:53] okay so my goal is just I'll be really I'm liquid cast okay well let's take so right now we

[34:58] sell clothes so let's I get it I appreciate that so I'm I want to I want to increase the like you

[35:04] get there so I think like you can make this thing very valuable without doing all of the other

[35:11] stuff that you were talking about so I think like you absolutely can do this and then think okay

[35:14] why can't I get this to $100 million a year selling menswear like why can't I and I think that

[35:22] way then it's like okay is there a is there a brand person who can endorse this like if you look at

[35:27] the biggest retail brands they have big endorsers who stand next to product that increases

[35:32] conversion increases the premium you can charge instead instead of knocking off Sara you just

[35:36] become a brand and I think honestly I think that's the gap for you like you're obviously very good

[35:41] at the arbitrage of media to click someone I but like I think you need to go from that to building

[35:46] a brand and then that's what will make it so this is what I just like that's the TLDR of our

[35:51] conversation is that's what makes your thing valuable as you need a buildup rent

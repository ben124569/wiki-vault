[00:00] you become wealthy the moment you decide you are because you will realize at some point that

[00:03] money will buy you freedom will not buy you happiness. I was talking to an entrepreneur the other day

[00:08] and we were talking about living expenses and one of the things that a lot of our portfolio company

[00:12] struggle with is when to decide to start spending money. It's very difficult because we a lot of

[00:18] times as much as especially those that grow their businesses. Many times they've been taught not to

[00:22] spend money which I think is the right lesson overall to get to get started right if you define that

[00:26] as like the optimal confer material wealth. You know on the flip side there's also some people who

[00:29] struggle to ever get ahead and they're always living paid it to paycheck to paycheck even when they

[00:33] have a lot of money and I know I have some friends who you know they're in their fifties and have

[00:37] always made very very high incomes and have spent virtually every dollar and now they were reddit and so

[00:42] I don't think there's anything wrong spending all the money that you have. I do think that it is not ideal

[00:46] for a material wealth accumulation if that is the goal but you may enjoy your life that way so it's really

[00:50] I think a balancing act between those things and so I thought it might be fun to make a video about how

[00:55] my living expenses changed from you know dollar zero to now we do you know over $10000 a year

[01:00] at acquisition.com and if you're new to the channel I make these videos just because I would help and

[01:05] I hope that these things can help you get to $3 million more so that we can potentially partner with

[01:08] your business and how you get to 30 and beyond. All right but otherwise I have no coaching the

[01:11] statistics or anything like that that I sell and I make these videos because I enjoy doing it. Okay let's

[01:15] dive in so you know season one here was Alex quitting his job and sleeping on the floor. All right and so I

[01:20] tried to write out each of these phases or seasons of my life kind of like the outcome the income

[01:25] and kind of the expenses I was in current at the time. All right so I slept in the gym floor so I had no

[01:29] rent besides my business rent but I know personal rent. My car payment was done existing because I

[01:33] had my car in cash and I actually only lived exclusively on the cash sales from the business. I was

[01:39] actually my living money which for me was a combination of eating in and out inch poli and that was it.

[01:44] My accountant actually told me that my I did done 500 or 500 transactions to poli that first year and it was

[01:50] like that's insane. I was like well I don't buy groceries and I don't cook so I just I ate out always

[01:54] and that worked out for me. So it was actually for me cheaper than all the time and I just stayed

[01:58] at work and I slept there and that was kind of it right and so anyways even during that time I was able

[02:02] to increase my income to about 15,000 or some month but I tend to be very security driven and I've

[02:07] noticed that by myself so I like to make a lot more than I'm spending. All right and the reason I'm making

[02:10] this video too is that like some people will see us you know fly private or it will see us eat out you

[02:14] know many many many many or every night of the week and think oh that's what I should do now I should

[02:18] emulate that. I think I wanted to actually show kind of the come up of what kind of expenses you

[02:23] know expensive income ratio looked like for me over the last 10 years. To hopefully you know provide

[02:26] some clarity for those of you who at least are trying to emulate the path and if you're not then

[02:30] don't emulate this path but this is what worked for me okay. Now at this point I had two partners into

[02:34] the scene and we stopped taking dividends and we started investing in the growth of the business

[02:38] overall so you can see here that's what I went from you know one to six gyms and I've really took

[02:42] no dividends in that period of time and I had saved this up for about six months so I had about

[02:46] 70,000 dollars total saved up after taxes from that first you know six to nine months of doing business

[02:51] and at that point that was it and I lived on that for three years that cash lasted me for three

[02:56] years which is again probably why I'm so security driven um because I know what it's like the

[02:59] little nothing and so my my car was still in cash so I had no car payments and I did up my lifestyle

[03:05] to renting a room and it wasn't actually me running a room for context I actually had a true

[03:11] roommate so it was a house there were seven people living in the house and I split one room and so

[03:15] this was in select how for me and my rent was I think it was $700 a month and might have been $400

[03:19] it was $400 to $700 in there and it was a house in Costa Mesa and I literally had another guy who

[03:24] slept in there with me and we split it all right so mind you like I'm reinvesting on my cash

[03:28] and growing these in this business but my personal expenses were virtually zero the only thing I

[03:32] spent money on was going out to each pull-up and that was it all right that was literally all I spent

[03:36] money on and I had this share of okay now I did that for three years all right so I can say three

[03:40] years really easily but it took three years my life of this little season here now the next season that

[03:44] happened was I bought a condo and I bought a condo because I relate the condo I thought it was you know

[03:48] well priced and whatnot and I lived there for a very short period of time and then I realized that I could

[03:53] rent it for $3500 a month so that's what I ended up renting the condo for and then that's when

[03:58] Lail and I started doing Jim turn around so you just apply around and do these launches right and so

[04:02] these launches at that time for a business perspective got us to about 200 300 thousand month now that was

[04:07] revenue my income was still very very low and that's because again I didn't take decisions because

[04:11] I didn't learn that lesson yet all right so for those of you who were like taking notes at home

[04:14] there's multiple periods of who those of you who know my story I've lost everything in between here multiple times and so

[04:19] that is why I'm so big on taking distributions as you grow because at the end of the day risk is a real thing and

[04:24] I had spent years of my life building something only to lose it and I didn't want to make that mistake again

[04:28] and so this was yet again another one of those mistakes right did and I did these turn routes and I lived at the

[04:32] Extended today here for $1800 a month all right so my rent expense was $1800 a month

[04:37] We lived we had a car that we owned in cash which was the Prius during this period of time and that was it

[04:42] That was the only expenses was the Extended today and then us eating you know Chipotle and stuff and Laila was kind enough to

[04:48] deal with me eating Chipotle during this entire period of time and so we got the business about 200 300

[04:52] $100 a month there was a bunch of logistical issues with the business it was low margin

[04:56] There's a lot of operational complexity I was learning right so then from there

[04:59] We said you know what maybe we should settle down and that's when we switched to having sales teams fly out and do this stuff

[05:04] You know on our on our behalf and do the Jim turn rounds and we could stay central so that's where we

[05:08] Move to Albuquerque because we had friends now Albuquerque that we wanted to learn from and I rent there was $1200 a month

[05:13] Okay, the car we owned in cash which was Prius a KAA hashtag music mobiles those view who are you know

[05:18] Vailing your business over your personal expenditures and we ate out

[05:22] Eight out out once a week and this is actually when we switched to to meal prepping excuse me

[05:26] So Laila started cooking because we had a kitchen that was like regular and it wasn't just like extended stay kitchen

[05:31] So she started cooking which was awesome and we ate out once a week for like a date night because that's what we

[05:36] Believe we had to do then was have a date night which we have since changed the way we do things

[05:40] But at that time that was the one kind of big expensive the week is we would eat out car was in cash

[05:44] $1200 a month was our rent and here's what's crazy during this period of time

[05:48] The business went from the turnaround business at 300 thousand dollars a month to 1.5 million a month

[05:52] All right and these are my living expenses so I was saving and this is really saving I was adding a million dollars to my personal bank out of my month

[05:58] All right and my eye I mean we all right and so this is when we started to really create a lot of wealth very quickly and my

[06:05] Do like we didn't live on a lot of money still all right and I think when we had about I want to say we had like shoot

[06:11] I want to say we had four to six million saved up after taxes at this point and that's one in cash

[06:17] We bought a

[06:18] $1.8 million house we bought the one-point-e-mailed our house in cash in Austin which was a really good deal at the time for that particular house

[06:25] We still split one car. There was she owning cash and this car now got upgraded. It was an I8 which was a gift from ClickFunnels for being a

[06:32] An affiliate so I got the car for free and they basically paid us to buy the car doesn't matter

[06:36] But the point is I didn't have I didn't have car payments for the car and this time we still ate out actually less frequently

[06:42] They did an albergoccus we were like super intense in work mode

[06:44] This is where we over-indexed on trying to build the enterprise and build the business during that period of time and I don't want to say I regret that

[06:50] I think it was a honest sorry lesson. I think we did not have nearly as much fun as we probably could have

[06:54] But lay on our were so afraid of losing what we had built and so you know, it was just like we just didn't want to mess it up

[07:00] And so we just wanted to work all the time because we were just so afraid it was very fear driven stuff now two or three years in

[07:05] At this point we brought we we bought an additional car which was a Bentley

[07:10] I talked to Bradley and I talked to Berkastio friends of ours and they were like dude you gotta spend some money and I was like all right

[07:14] So we bought a fancy car and I realized quickly that we didn't care and so we sold it within six months

[07:19] We lost money on the car and we were happier for it and so it's just we realized it just didn't matter to us

[07:24] Just sat in the driveway and getting an expensive car fixed. We had a teenager ding the thing the bumper and it was you know in the shop for three months of the six

[07:31] And it was ultimately just a pain in the ass now that being said still during this period of time

[07:35] You know the Bentley was the only really expensive thing we bought the house was in cash

[07:38] So I had no house payment the car was in cash so I know car payment and the only real expenses we had it at that that period of time was eating out

[07:44] One two times a month. That was literally it all right and during that time our revenue increased from 1.5 million a month to

[07:49] Over four million a month in that period of time and our wealth continued to to grow because everything that was an excess from the income

[07:54] Spectrum just poured straight into our savings. All right, so that was for context during that period of time

[07:59] I think we accumulated around

[08:01] Oh, and as a $30 million after taxes in cash and assets are you know cash booklinks things like that and so it was really just savings

[08:07] Right, we didn't sell anything at that point. That's kind of where we were at at that chapter. All right now at that point now

[08:12] Mind you this was like cash stuff. There's the equities in the business that obviously

[08:15] We're more than that, but that was just straight dividends and I think an important part there is like I

[08:20] I learned to take dividends because I realized that I was giving myself an excuse by reinvesting every dollar of cash flow into the business

[08:26] Which a lot of times meant that I just wasn't really focused on profitability and I think that sometimes that's a business strategy

[08:32] It's very rarely the right one and a lot of times just having a sustainable growth path where you can

[08:36] Do you risk yourself by taking cash off the table because let's say

[08:39] COVID happened for example and you know our company said going down

[08:43] Which they did thankfully we had very strong businesses that were able to sustain that even though they were in heavily hit industries

[08:48] This gave us a very good piece of mind to know that we could cash for the company if we needed to and we could keep everything alive

[08:53] Our for as long as the last it and you know

[08:55] We thought it was gonna be 12 weeks and then it was two years right and so that's why I'm a big fan of derisking and living cheap now

[09:00] You're like well that's not living cheap Alex things is that relative to my income

[09:03] And this is why I wanted to make this video as for context, right?

[09:05] Yes, we lived in a 1.8 million dollar house and yes, you know, we sold the house for $4 million to 1.5 years later

[09:10] Like so it was an expensive it was a nice house and a nice neighborhood

[09:12] But like we could buy our house in cash every month off of our income

[09:16] All right, so like this is what I feel like is lost sometimes in the podcast and interviews that I talk about and

[09:22] Sometimes we're like oh you eat now you eat out. Oh you private and it's like yes, but like I'm so security driven

[09:26] And I just want you to convey that I'm not saying you have to be I'm saying this is work for me

[09:29] All right, and so we were able to accumulate about 30 million bucks in cash between like real estate and

[09:34] Stocks I would say like non business equities or non public market equities during that period of time

[09:39] All right, now after that those you some of you know is that in 2021

[09:42] We sold everything so we sold our three businesses we sold two cars we sold the house we sold everything

[09:47] Actually so one car we were going to sell the other car and I think we kept it so excuse that

[09:50] So that should just be what we were planning on selling to us. Oh, it was the belly sorry

[09:53] I didn't erupt if you guys have been enjoying the content and have any questions about what you've seen so far

[09:57] Go ahead and drop the questions in the comments below so that I can answer them in future videos and provide more ballots to you

[10:02] Keep enjoying the video continue. All right, so we sold everything so we had no personal assets

[10:06] All right, we had business assets and investment S we know personal assets at that time and so then we started running a condo

[10:10] But when that we were currently in for 15 grand a month

[10:12] We spent about 15 thousand dollars month on food and eating out

[10:15] We don't cook much and that's just from a time perspective and it's also for us the end of the day is kind of like where we

[10:20] Unwind and so we work from pretty early morning until about four five o'clock

[10:23] Then we got to dinner at six we give back home in 730

[10:26] Layline I probably watch your show and then we go to bed and we do it all over again

[10:28] And so that's that's our day. That's what we do my be like that's really boring. Yeah, probably I don't know

[10:32] We like it and so that's what we do so we spent 15 about

[10:34] 15 grand a month on food probably 15 thousand dollars month on travel. I will say this I flew private more during this season

[10:41] That's a plane. Here you go. Here's my plane

[10:45] We flew private more during this season than we do now and that's because we found something that I think

[10:49] gives us confers from a benefit to cost ratio many of the advantages of private

[10:54] But it's a it's public so we actually find jsex now for anything that is on the west coast

[10:58] Which is basically like semi private travel. It's cool. It's like you know

[11:02] You can have like three to you know 15 other people on the plane with you and you and it has all the same benefits

[11:07] Private which is you roll up straight to the plane 10 minutes before it takes off

[11:10] You literally get right into the plane and then it lands and then you walk straight to a car

[11:14] So it just saves so much time and it's marginally more expensive than normal ticket

[11:17] I think some of the tickets are like 200 to 400 bucks. It's not expensive and so we have opted to do a

[11:22] Flying on that airline rather than private

[11:24] And this is not sponsored by jsex, but I you know I would endorse them because they're great

[11:27] And so we start we stop flying private because you know spending 50 thousand dollars on a plane flight

[11:32] If I can get basically the same benefit for $400 is worth it and so again, this is one of those like we flew private because it saved his time

[11:38] And it turned travel from a negative into a positive

[11:41] But jsex I think accomplishes all that and I never cared about having other people in the plane

[11:44] I just cared about getting places faster and not having to get hassle and jsex accomplishes that so I mean we we pretty much always fly those now

[11:51] Everywhere we go and almost if anything

[11:53] We we tried flight places where they go which is wonderful and you know during this period of time

[11:57] We're currently at you know

[11:59] Acquisition calm I say in the videos you know we're doing over a hundred million dollars year, but right now we're over a hundred fifty

[12:03] But just for a sake of you know not making the number change every time the business is grow

[12:07] We grew from about $7 million dollars a month to a 13 million dollars a month between the portfolio companies in that period of time

[12:11] And so I show this to show that you know

[12:14] I don't think our lifestyles have increased at the proportion that our income has and I think that's because

[12:19] Layout our both very security driven as individuals and that works for us and I want to have kind of one

[12:26] Final point that I'll make here that

[12:28] Hopefully you can take away from this is that if the goal is material wealth accumulation

[12:32] Then the lower your personal expenses the more you will accumulate

[12:35] Right and your piece of mind will be predicated on the ratio between your income and your expenses right if you can make enough in

[12:41] A month or a year to give yourself another multiple years of living then you go towards your

[12:47] F-U number as fast as possible so you know there's two variables there how much you make and how much you spend now at some point

[12:53] People are like well I would like to increase my expenditures

[12:55] I think that's natural and I think that's normal and I think the thing that I would push against which is why we had

[13:00] You know a hashtag that went pretty pretty viral which is mozi mobiles

[13:03] We'll probably have mozi mansions too. I'll probably start that one

[13:06] Maybe I'll show an image of what our $1200 apartment looked like but it's it's really less about living cheap and more about

[13:12] Spending money on the things that you value rather than what societies hold us to value right and so for me

[13:15] The equity growth of my businesses I valued more than having a lamb out or having a Bentley and for me

[13:20] I just don't get a lot of value from it now some people might and that's okay

[13:23] I just think that it's really good to think consciously and my buying this because I want status from other people

[13:27] Because I really think that this thing can first value right same thing with flying private for example

[13:31] At least for us the decision calculus has changed recently just because I just discovered this

[13:35] So for the last few months we've been flying J. Saxon honestly. I love it. It's great. I you know

[13:39] I the benefit to value ratio has diminished now that I have an alternative that is you know one 100th of the price of

[13:44] Private and for us almost all the benefits that I enjoyed I say this to say I am all about wealth and wealth is the ratio

[13:50] But income and expenses and peace of mind that you have from knowing that you have enough and so for me

[13:54] My goal was to get to enough as fast as possible so that I could feel that peace of mind

[13:58] Everything we do now is just for love with the game which is why the podcast is called the game to swine make these videos and just to see like

[14:03] What would it look like to get to a billion because that sounds really exciting and epic and fun and at the same time

[14:08] I'm super invested motivated to get there. I'm okay if we never do and I don't even want to say that because I do

[14:13] 100% believe that we're gonna get there, but it's it's really about playing the game and I think that that has been I think the goal

[14:18] If I have for most of the nations that everyone can get to a point where they're just playing the game for the love of the game

[14:23] Not for the lamb or for the manchering or for the whatever because I can tell you that those are moments and those are fleeting and

[14:28] So I think it's much more of a process becoming rather than obtaining and I think that if we can make that switch

[14:32] We get to experience a lot of the benefits of the wealth because wealth occurs or you become wealthy the moment you decide you are because

[14:38] You will realize at some point that money will buy you freedom will not buy you happiness and so if the goal is

[14:42] You know first the goal is freedom short, but then you're free to experience the feelings that you have and you're realized that it was not that thing

[14:48] But it can't absolutely decrease pain and in communities in your life and so I can obviously

[14:51] I'm somebody who's gone after material wealth accumulation in my life

[14:54] So I don't want to say that like it's not something that I find interesting fun and stimulating

[14:57] I don't even know what I would do if I if this game didn't exist

[14:59] But it's really just to take pause and think like are these things that I'm buying really adding more value than the price that I'm incurring to purchase them

[15:05] And I think many times people purchase things without thinking that extra up taking the extra second to pause and say like am I really getting

[15:11] 500 dollars a value from this show my really getting

[15:14] $2,000 from this belt am I really getting XYZ now you can do this relative to your income right like

[15:19] It's not unreasonable to live on a million dollars a year if you make 15 million dollars

[15:22] Right, it's not it's actually less and here's what's crazy

[15:25] It's less to live on a million dollars a year when you make 15 then it is to live on 100 when you make 400 right

[15:30] It's about the ratio between income and expenses and so we can control our expenses into it and

[15:36] Also we can control our income based on getting more skills, which is why I've been a very loud advocate for spending as much of your extra

[15:42] Dollars on acquiring more skills so that you can increase your capacity to earn and when you do that

[15:47] You can accelerate towards that wealth

[15:49] Discorpancy between income and expenses at a faster rate and then ultimately achieve the peace of mind that I think most of us are after

[15:55] Anyways, my zinexion. I love you guys

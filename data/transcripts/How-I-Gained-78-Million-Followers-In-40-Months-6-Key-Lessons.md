[00:00] Let's rock. So you guys would hear something absolutely insane. Well, in the last 40 months,

[00:05] my YouTube grew from zero to 2.23 million subscribers. My Instagram grew from 7,000 to 2.5 million

[00:14] subscribers. Followers. You get the idea. My LinkedIn went from zero to 324,000 followers. My TikTok went

[00:21] from zero to 856,000 followers. My Twitter slash x, the artist normally known as Twitter,

[00:28] went from zero to 617,000. My Facebook, which we just started when from zero to 25, that there we go.

[00:35] Going in big Facebook. My podcast went from 3,000 to 25 million downloads. And my email

[00:42] subscribers from zero to 700,000. For a grand total of 2 billion impressions over that time

[00:49] period. And 7.8 million new subscribers. And for a grand total of a million copies sold of my book.

[00:59] For those of you who are like, well, what does that mean? And I'll get to that in a second.

[01:03] So in 40-ish months, all of that happened. And I show all of this is proof to start this

[01:09] to show one thing. Is that this actually works. And you can build a brand without babes,

[01:20] without stunts, or kittens. And I start this proof because lots of people talk about stuff that

[01:27] they haven't done. And teach a lot of sucky fluff as a result. You can see the man there. He's saying

[01:33] the truth. This fluff sucks. And I refuse to do that. And so before we got the 2 billion

[01:40] impressions in the 7.8 million subscribers, it wasn't like this. Because 40 months ago, I started

[01:46] with zero subscribers. And a big, quote, fancy plant. And my fancy plan had three steps. Step one,

[01:55] make as much good stuff as I could. Step two, post it everywhere I could. And step three,

[02:01] learn as much as I could. And after 40-ish months, four million dollars in team, equipment,

[02:10] vendors, studios, and software, 1,000 hours of meat on camera recording. And 35,000 pieces of content.

[02:20] Let me say that again, 35,000 as in count to 1,000, and then do that 35 times in a row.

[02:27] I learned a lot of what not to do. But I did learn six things that made money and grew my

[02:34] brand that you can use today. Now, what I'd like to do is for the remainder of the presentation,

[02:42] save you the 3.5 years and 4 million dollars so you can just get the lessons without the scar.

[02:49] So that little box is our box of six lessons. Cool? All right, let's rock. So here are the six

[02:57] changes that we observed over the last four, 48 months that actually worked. Number one,

[03:04] going from edutainment to education. Number two, for us to for you. Number three,

[03:11] wide to narrow. Number four, views to revenue. Number five, short to longs. Number six,

[03:19] assume more to assume nothing. Now, most of those I promise you, I will explain. And if it looks like,

[03:26] I think I know what that means, believe me, there's a lot more underneath of it. So let's start

[03:30] with the first one, edutainment to education. So I see content in three buckets. On one extreme,

[03:38] you've got entertainment, which is the entire point of entertainment just to define the term,

[03:44] is to get people to watch. The only point of the entertainment is to just get people to consume it.

[03:49] That's it. If it accomplishes that, it has succeeded. On the other side of education,

[03:56] where the point of education is to get someone to change what they do. Right? If you

[04:00] try and teach someone how to answer a phone and then in the same situation, the phone rings,

[04:04] and they don't do something, and then after they watch you do something, they then change what they do

[04:08] in the phone rings the second time, they have learned. So the point is to change their behavior.

[04:13] If the video or the content does that, then you've succeeded in educating them.

[04:18] And lastly, you have edutainment, which has the point of both trying to teach and entertaining

[04:24] at the same time. And to be clear, it's less that you make entertaining content, or that you make

[04:30] educational content. It's more that you make content, and people are either entertained or

[04:36] educated as a result. And so you can make one thing that entertain some people, and then that same

[04:45] thing educates other people. And so I just want to make this very clear that you don't control

[04:51] the audience. You make something and then education or entertainment occurs. But for our purposes,

[04:57] all define the content category as the most common outcome of your content. And so if a lot of

[05:02] people are entertained, then you've made entertaining content for the purposes of this presentation,

[05:07] even if one or two people learn something. So for example, some creators might learn stuff

[05:12] for Mr. B. Svideos. Wow, I learned how to make videos. But the vast majority of people are entertained.

[05:16] They watch just to watch. On the other hand, Wala, who's one of the number one educators on

[05:21] YouTube, you can even see the different looking fields, and don't want to get into that.

[05:26] He may entertain some enthusiasts around that subject. But mostly, he educates students.

[05:34] And until recently, I've been trying to figure this out. I've spent a lot of time

[05:37] really working through this. And so I actually have videos in all three buckets. I have entertainment

[05:42] videos where the point is to get people to watch. I've educated videos where we try to teach

[05:47] and entertain at the same time. And then we have education videos where we just want to change

[05:51] people's behavior. We just want to teach them something. And so the first change, number one,

[05:56] that we see over lots of the data on support in a second, is that I'm going all in on education.

[06:01] For three reasons. Number one, is that when we looked at all of our data, all of you

[06:06] are not created equal. I'll dive into that in a second. Number two is I like education videos.

[06:11] And number three is I like people who like educational videos too, and or people who educate

[06:16] themselves, people who want to learn. And so let me explain these. So all views are not created equal.

[06:23] So there's this theory, and this is going to, this will be one that's going to rattle some cages.

[06:28] There's a theory that media works like a funnel. In fact, the vast majority of marketing

[06:33] infographics and things like that, almost all their funnels. And the theory goes like this.

[06:39] You make entertaining content. And then the theory states that people who watch that content,

[06:46] then we'll go through more educational content. Okay? Sounds simple enough. We've got something

[06:50] wide. We've got something narrow, fantastic. But in our experience, in my experience,

[06:56] and based on our book sales, based on our email options, and based on the applications we

[07:02] receive at acquisition.com, do you become portfolio companies? It works much more like this,

[07:06] which is that entertainment people want more entertainment content. And education people want more

[07:14] say with me, education content. And so in other words, these people do not become these people,

[07:23] not in any appreciable rate that we would build a business around. And they certainly don't read

[07:28] the books, join the email list, or apply to become portfolio businesses. So if I want more of these

[07:35] people, then they deserve the stuff that they value. And so that's the first reason that I'm

[07:43] doubling down on education. All of you are not created equal. Number two, the next is that I simply

[07:48] like doing it. All right. So, you know, I do believe that you should try and do stuff that you like doing.

[07:53] And if it happens to also be aligned with your goals, awesome. It's much tougher when the thing you

[07:57] like doing isn't aligned with your goals. But in this instance, when I got that first piece of

[08:00] data, I was like, thank God, because this is stuff I like making most. All right. And so when I talk

[08:05] to ideal customers in my mind, they're business owners and business interested people. Because if you

[08:09] know me and anybody who is close to me would probably test to this is that like, if you hang out

[08:15] with me, if for any amount of time, we will probably talk about business. Because it's what I love talking

[08:19] about. I eat it, I sleep it, I drink it, I work seven days on it, and like, I skip holidays for it.

[08:24] Because for me, it is the holiday. So, this is what I like doing. And this is what the people that

[08:29] I like serving also like. And so they like it better too. And this is where God confusing for me

[08:38] leading up to this. And why this is so important is that it got very confusing when you have so many

[08:43] people saying, man, I really like the entertaining content. And this is where it gets difficult.

[08:48] This is where you have to read between the lines of the comments rather than just reading the comments

[08:52] themselves. All right. Because the thing is, is for us, or at least for me, they weren't necessarily

[08:58] who I was trying to attract. Again, there's nothing wrong with that. I mean, hey, if I could serve

[09:02] the whole world, I will. But I know that I tend to do better serving people who want to educate

[09:07] themselves than people who just want to watch or consume just for the sake of it. And so that's why

[09:13] I'm dead, bleeding down on going from entertainment, some entertainment, some entertainment, two

[09:19] education. So that's number one. So let's talk about change number two that we saw.

[09:25] Going from for us to for you, you know, like, what does that mean? Let me explain. So recently,

[09:30] a mutual friend came to the headquarters and he said, hey, I've been consuming your stuff for years,

[09:34] but recently, it just happened to be watching as much. And he said it offhandedly, wasn't like

[09:38] trying to smash might you go into bits. And he failed at that. But when he said it, I really took

[09:46] it to heart, right? It was very gut-ratching. He said it just doesn't resonate as much. I was like,

[09:49] okay, got it. And it felt like it got punch since he's literally the person I could help most.

[09:54] This is a business owner doing 10 million plus a year. And I was like, man, well, that sucks.

[09:59] And that's when I realized that reading the comments actually led me a little bit of stray.

[10:03] And for you, might be leading you astray. And I'll give you some data to support that.

[10:07] And so some people loved our different styles, but not the people that I ultimately wanted to help

[10:12] or am best suited to serve. And so we realized what we were serving the wrong who. And that

[10:18] had some very significant downstream impacts on what we made and how we made it. So what is

[10:25] making for them or for business owners content really mean? Let me break this down into tactics.

[10:30] All right, so tactically, I meant five things.

[10:34] Number one, different packaging. Number two, different introductions.

[10:40] Number three, different meat. Number four, different visuals. And number five, different what I'll

[10:46] call pre-work. All right, so let's start with number one. So the difference that seemed these two thumbnails

[10:52] is going from vague to clear. All right, so if I looked at all the stuff that we did in the past,

[10:57] if I said, what is the video on the left about? You probably be like, I, a rule of some sort

[11:02] that might have to do with money, not sure. And if I said, what's the what's the video on the right?

[11:08] The yellow background video. If I were to describe it, I'd probably say a map or a blueprint

[11:13] or schematics of some sort that go from zero to a million. Okay, well guess what?

[11:20] The one on the right, it's exactly that. The one on the left actually has nothing to do with what

[11:26] that thumbnail looks like. And what do you know? When people click on something that they don't

[11:29] know what it's about, they have a smaller percentage of getting something they actually want.

[11:33] Then if you say, this is what this is about. And then they get exactly what they think it's about.

[11:38] So we're going from vague to clear in both what it looks like, the thumbnails and what we say about it,

[11:44] the headlines. So that's number one, from a packaging perspective that we will be changing and

[11:50] doing more and more and more and more. And I want to take a pause here for a second about this.

[11:55] There was also kind of a pervasive narrative in the kind of marketing world. It's like, you

[11:59] got to have curiosity. You got to like, you don't want to tell them everything. You want them to

[12:03] to be able to get no. Like, if they want that thing, they will click on that thing and then you just

[12:08] give them that thing. And that has been a very hard lesson for me to learn. And so I show it with you now.

[12:14] So the second is different introductions. You guys feel on this? Okay. Good.

[12:19] Okay. Different introductions. Now this one is really big. So going from confirming the thumbnail or

[12:26] confirming the headline to proof. And this is super important. I'll explain the difference. So a lot

[12:32] of the things that I learned like many of you, if you are trying to get into content creation of any

[12:36] sort or media, is that you look at the people who are the biggest. Right? And so oftentimes the

[12:42] biggest people in media are entertainers. Now why is that? Because everyone gets value from entertainment.

[12:49] But there is no one thing from an education perspective that can provide value to everyone. Why?

[12:54] Because everyone already knows different stuff. So if I educate a wide slice of people, there's still

[12:59] already people who know that thing and then do not get value. So entertainment by definition will

[13:04] always be greater or larger the following for those people than people who educate. There is no

[13:10] no bones about it. Like it is that way. And so a lot of the lessons that entertainment teaches

[13:16] everyone listens to because they have the biggest followings. But I don't think the actual tactics

[13:21] they subscribe or espouse are correct at a tactical level, at a principal level. Yes. And so let me

[13:29] just say a second about what that principle is. Is that the person who's going to consume the

[13:34] content? We want to increase their perceived likelihood that they will get what they clicked. So just

[13:40] like the headline and just like the thumbnails. Now when they set an entertainment, you want to confirm

[13:45] it. Well that's because most of the sensational entertainment is something crazy. And so the likelihood

[13:51] that someone just got the clicks so that they could not do that crazy thing is pretty high. And so if you

[13:56] want people to watch, use smash the Lamborghini, then you better have the Lamborghini next to you.

[14:00] Or people are going to believe that you're actually going to smash it. Now let's flip to entertainment

[14:06] for a second. Sorry let's switch to education for a second. If I say I'm going to teach you a physics

[14:14] thing, I'm going to teach you about the law of, I don't even know if the first law of physics is,

[14:18] but if you push it, it will move. Something like that. Anyways, if I want to have proof or

[14:26] increase the perceived likelihood that they're going to be well taught, then what I actually have to

[14:32] do is edify the person. Why should I listen to you? If I'm the viewer, there's a zillion people that

[14:38] could write something on a board. But if you're a PhD physicist, then the likelihood that I will

[14:43] listen to you and then I will get what I want is much higher. And so in both of these examples,

[14:48] we are actually doing the same thing, but we do it differently if you want to educate. And for me

[14:53] when I looked at my videos and I'll explain the data in a second, it became really clear. And so

[14:59] in entertainment, it's say the title again and then literally show them what was on the thumbnail.

[15:04] In education, it's show them that you can do what you promise them in the thumbnail. And that's the

[15:09] difference. And to figure out what made intros for our videos work, I actually rewatched my top

[15:16] 35 educational videos. This actually took some time. And so let me just save you like a lot of

[15:22] hours and just give you the nugget. And so I actually developed a new moniker around how to think

[15:28] about introductions for ourselves that I'm spreading throughout my whole team and you can just steal it.

[15:34] Proof promise plan. So I'll break down all three of these. So all of the introductions of the best

[15:42] education videos that we had had these three characteristics. And I want to make one point about the

[15:47] order of these is that you can have these three mixed in any order you want. I would emphasize the

[15:54] one that is the most important for that particular piece of content. So if you have some that you're

[15:58] making that you think the proof is going to be really important, then lead with that. If you have a promise

[16:03] that's incredibly important for the audience, then lead with that. If you have a plan that for some

[16:08] reason is going to be more emphasized than lead with that. But I would say that for our content for

[16:12] the most because I'm a business educator about making money in general, most people have this

[16:17] big glaring sign of their head before they can even turn on the volume of their brain, which is

[16:21] why should I listen to you? And so I tend to lead with proof. And so proof is that you prove that

[16:28] you know what you're talking about. You give people a reason to believe you. The promise is to tell

[16:33] them what they're going to get or learn from the video. And the plan sets the expectations of what

[16:38] will happen next. So let me give you a real word example of this. I started this presentation with

[16:43] data that shows that I've done what I'm talking about. If I went up here and just skip to this

[16:47] part, you might be like, okay, all of this up to this point, why should I listen to you? And you'd be

[16:52] right in thinking that because you have no idea who I am. I could just be some random dude,

[16:56] it looks like a broken stock, slightly lumberjacky,ish, weirdly dressed man, like why would you

[17:02] listen? And you'd be a reason to believe that, right? But if you start with that, then you're like,

[17:06] okay, well, he knows something. The promise was what I said you would get at the beginning. I said,

[17:12] I learned six things that made money and grew my brain that you can use today. And I'm going to

[17:16] save you $4 million and $3.5 years and you'll just get all the lessons that I learned. That was the promise.

[17:21] Making sense? Okay. And then finally, get the plan. I said, how are we going to get there? How

[17:26] am I going to complete that promise? I said, well, there's six changes and I'm going to walk through

[17:29] them. That's the plan. And so leading with those things, we found got business owners or the people

[17:34] that I'm interested in to actually better frame and perceive and get educated on the concept that we're

[17:41] talking about. And so that's what we're changing in our introductions.

[17:45] Third, now let's talk about how this strategy changes the meat of the content. What we're actually

[17:50] like the real bones, the potatoes. All right, is that going from B real slash vlog stuff because we

[17:56] have made that to list steps and stories. When we looked at the educational content that did the best,

[18:02] they had more of the right and less of the left. For Razzle, I would love to say to Dazzle, but it

[18:08] really is, it just razzle on the left. And so I actually wanted to show a different type of content.

[18:12] So I don't want to make this seem like this is all YouTube. I just have, like, long-form video there

[18:16] has all of the elements and some platforms don't have all of them. So YouTube is a very easy

[18:21] platform to base this off of, but this is from Instagram and TikTok would function the same way,

[18:26] et cetera. So if you look at the squares here, I just pulled the last 30 days of content that we made.

[18:32] And I looked at our bottom performing over the last 30 days that we posted that were reals.

[18:37] And then I looked at the top. Now interestingly, it was almost a perfect reversal. So the bottom

[18:46] 12 videos that we made, eight out of 12, I would say had more Razzle emphasized. It was more about

[18:52] effects, a little bit higher production. And on the flip side, and this is what was crazy. And this

[18:58] is why I'm sharing this stuff with you because I would literally never have guessed it and that's why we

[19:02] look. Nine out of 12, 75% of the best videos we had emphasized language, emphasized the actual message

[19:11] more than the production. And so it was about emphasizing the language rather than the Razzle.

[19:17] I find this very fascinating. Now to be really clear, you can have really bad language. You're like

[19:21] poor, big, unclear language and it won't do well. And you might have Razzle that just absolutely

[19:27] look at the trends of 75% on this side where this style or this type, and 75% that weren't as good

[19:34] were this style. Well then let's do more of this unless of that. And so there's the main

[19:40] meat changes that we're doing in the videos. We're emphasizing language. This also was true with

[19:45] longs as well. So if I go and show you this real quick, language, that's on the screen. And that's

[19:50] one of our best videos ever. And that takes up 70, 80% of the videos actually just words.

[19:55] Interesting. For me, at least. I mean, I was a little offended because I thought I had a good face,

[19:59] but apparently no, I'm cares. So that's over changing about the meat. So let's talk about visuals.

[20:06] This one's a big one. All right. So going from over production and I want to be clear, not over

[20:12] production, over production for the objective. So it's not like we did like my team did anything

[20:19] wrong or anything like that. It's just that if we want to educate some times for production

[20:23] distracts from the objective of education. If the point for entertainment is to get someone

[20:28] to watch, then adding lots of things can be a good thing. But if you're trying to learn physics

[20:33] and there's wiz bangs and pop ups and changing backgrounds, it's really hard to learn. And if

[20:39] that's the throughput or that's the point of the video that it actually detracts rather than ads.

[20:45] And so the difference that I put in this example here is we have a background that changes

[20:49] colors while I'm teaching something. It does not help someone understand the subject matter better.

[20:53] Fundamentally, changing background color will not help anyone learn more. On the flip side,

[20:58] clarifying what words on a screen are because maybe my handwriting is not that good,

[21:02] would help people understand. That's the difference. So over production to effective production.

[21:09] From distracting to enhancing, from visual effects to visualizing data. So instead of having

[21:17] flames behind me, it's, what does this look like on a chart so we can give relative scale? So we

[21:22] have scopes so we can show changes over time. And so that's how the visuals

[21:29] that did the best look like. And then number five, let's talk about pre-work for a second.

[21:36] So going from post production to pre-search. So instead of saying, hey, let's just record something

[21:42] and then fix it in post. Anybody's in the media side knows what I'm talking about?

[21:47] Four weeks of editing after, you know, almost no prep to get a video out.

[21:51] Well, what if we did four weeks of research? And then we have almost no editing because we thought of

[21:56] everything ahead of time. Well, guess what? The videos where we spent, I mean, we're like the, the

[22:02] hour to hour ratio is stupid and I'll get to that in a second. But if we spent a quarter of the time

[22:08] that we used to spend on post in pre, we eliminate 90%, 90, maybe 95% of our post at it work

[22:18] and man hours. And for the business owners in the room, that's real cost. That's real savings.

[22:24] And for the also business owners in the room, that also means increased production. So if I can

[22:29] take the quarter of the time and I can get almost zero time on the back end, that's four times

[22:34] the videos. But not only is it four times the output, it's also higher quality for your goal and

[22:40] your audience. So this is a big thing that we noticed the videos that we spent the most time

[22:44] on the front end, we spent less time on the back and they did better. And so we want to spend

[22:50] more time before than after. And so this is my little quote, if you want to write something down,

[22:55] an ounce of pre work is worth a pound of post. So that was my little, my little take on this.

[23:01] And so by focusing more on what educates and what it means, we do great and everything else

[23:06] distract from that goal. And so there's the, there's the five things that we're changing tactically

[23:12] and that we're doubling down on to cater to business owners. This at least for my audience is

[23:17] what they cared about. And I happen to mean that audience and I feel that way too. So I'm happy about it.

[23:23] So that's how we went from for us as media people to a degree because I've gotten to this now

[23:29] to for you or for your audience and for me that means for business owners. So now let's talk

[23:35] about why DeNero. All right. And this will also ruffle some feathers and rattle some cages.

[23:40] So instead of talking about relationships and college and food and lifestyle,

[23:48] I'm going to be narrowing down or doubling down on if you will. Business, business models,

[23:55] business leverage and selling in a business. Notice business being in all of these videos

[24:02] and all these topics. And so that's how I'm going narrow. Very simple.

[24:06] Now that I'm going to go back as like because I want to own it on this for a second.

[24:14] Just like I said earlier that people who like entertainment also just want more entertainment,

[24:19] what we also found is that people who go back, we'll quick, people who watch relationships stuff,

[24:25] want more relationships stuff. And as they should, that's what they clicked on. That's what they want.

[24:30] That makes sense. And people who want to learn about college are people trying to make a decision about

[24:34] college. It gets with those people probably aren't business owners. And people who want to learn about food,

[24:40] they watch other food videos. And people want to about lifestyle, probably watch other lifestyle videos.

[24:45] But for me, those were not necessarily the people that vibe the most with my stuff.

[24:52] And that makes sense because to be fair, this is a little bit more far into me. When I talk about business,

[24:55] I feel very comfortable. When I talk about these things, I just give what I would consider hot takes. This is my perspective.

[25:01] So that is what we're doubling down on in terms of the topics that we're choosing for the content we make.

[25:09] So that's number three. Let's go number four in terms of the things we're doubling down on.

[25:15] So before this, we used to track views. This is another big one. Man, all six of these are big. Man,

[25:20] a lot of made a presentation about it. So before this, we used to track views as our primary metric.

[25:25] So I'll take a second here. Who uses be honest? Be honest. Everyone's like,

[25:30] like, don't you can't trade likes for paying rent? Can't pay pay or will be sure. Okay, got it.

[25:36] Who here actually tracks something besides views? He said again, who makes views the most important

[25:42] metric you track? All right, right, a lot of it. That's okay. Me too. But I'm going to give you a good

[25:49] metric that you can track. And this is after pouring through a bleemim, I'm a big data guy.

[25:53] A metric that you might not expect. So the main reason is that I had a six to 12 month deal cycle.

[26:01] So I started by using views because I really had no other metric because for those you don't know what I

[26:05] do. Well, I'll explain in a second. But we had no idea what would it do besides driving awareness.

[26:10] And I didn't really have any other objective, right? But in that time period of doing a deal in every six

[26:15] or 12 months because we buy companies that's more or less what we do, we begin seeing a much closer

[26:20] correlation with faster feedback metrics. And ideally in any business you want as little latency

[26:24] between the metrics you track in the behavior you want to change. And so if you want to get people

[26:29] to change something and you want to look at something that takes a year to get feedback,

[26:33] really tough to change behavior. But if you can have a metric that you can see daily changes or

[26:37] hourly changes, then those are things that are going to much more quickly change behavior

[26:41] so that you can have a hundred feedback loops in terms of changing and getting better than one

[26:46] every year. And so besides book sales, opt-ins, and application, there was a metric that stood out as

[26:53] fastest and most measurable. Who's ad revenue. And this is really surprising to me. So, and I

[27:00] would this is the point I want to make real quick, is that to be clear for those of you don't know who I am,

[27:04] ad revenue is not how I make my money, just very clearly. For those you don't know, my wife and I

[27:08] exit our first big company for $46.2 million in December of 2021, you can Google it,

[27:14] American Pacific Group was the private equity firm Jim Lanch, which was the option to those companies.

[27:18] And since then we invested in about a number of companies that have grown a lot into over $20 million

[27:22] a year. So, I do media to feed a lot of different things, but I don't directly monetize the media.

[27:28] And like ad revenue is I'll explain why in a second is an important metric that we can use for everything else.

[27:35] So, these are companies that we have. Great. So, for me, I pretty much always ignored ad revenue

[27:40] and just saw this something that could offset some of the cost of the media. There was really nothing else.

[27:44] But I was wrong, it's actually so much more. So, let's dive into a little bit for a second

[27:49] of like how does ad revenue come to be? So, it comes from two things. This number of views,

[27:53] times revenue per views. Now, the actual term is RPMs, which is WP per meal, which is French for

[27:57] 1000. But it's number of views times the revenue that you get. Okay, per view, fantastic. So, it takes

[28:04] into account, and this is why this is important, because we thought views, and that was the only

[28:07] metric we had. But we had to have something to counter it, because otherwise then you get views

[28:11] review sick. But we needed a quality metric with a quantity metric, which by the way, paired metrics,

[28:17] if you're ever tracking something for an apartment, having like number of ticker's resolves with

[28:21] rating against the resolution of how well those customer service reps resolve, paired metrics

[28:27] allow you to get to the best or most effective throughput for any department. And I just didn't

[28:32] know enough about media to find out what our paired metric was. And this happens to be a single metric

[28:38] that pairs both. And so, it takes account the quality of the audience, which for me was business

[28:42] owners, who have amongst the highest spending power, and so RPMs are the highest. Now, for so

[28:46] for me, the RPMs go up. I mean, I'm getting more of the quality people that I want. And so,

[28:52] this gives me and my team, something that we could shoot for that bounce making videos for the

[28:55] right people who wanted to watch. So, I mean, ideally, we absolutely want to crank you with the right

[29:00] people. And that's what that was able to track for us. And looking backwards, the month with the

[29:07] highest RPMs and ad revenue also created the most book sales, the most often and the most business

[29:13] applications. And this had nothing to do with how many views we got. In fact, we did kind of an

[29:19] experiment lately where we did 90 days of almost no business stuff. We just did more, more edgutainment

[29:25] and entertainment style content. And our views went through the roof like way up, two, three,

[29:31] X, what we're accustomed to. But even with the increase in views, our ad revenue drop by half.

[29:39] So, we're actually getting the wrong people. And I share this with you, so you don't have to.

[29:44] And so, the nice thing about this from a team perspective for those of you who do have larger

[29:48] teams who want to translate this over is that my team now has real time access to this. So, they can

[29:52] see every single piece of content in the ad revenue that generates and they can quickly generate

[29:57] baselines in their mind of what's good and what's bad on an objective metric that really is

[30:00] good and bad rather than just like, hey, this video cranked. Yeah, but it didn't, it didn't

[30:05] bring any of the right people. We got this thing that had 10 million views. Okay, but it drove nothing.

[30:09] First, as we had this video that had 100,000 views and it made more ad revenue than the one that

[30:15] had 10 million. And we saw the corresponding increase in the metrics that mattered to us.

[30:21] And so, that's why we switched from views, being the metric that we're optimizing for,

[30:26] to add revenue because it's a leading performance indicator. It happens almost in real time

[30:31] rather than something that happens in a big, in a rearst to give a fancy word later.

[30:36] So, that's number four in terms of the things that we're doubling down on.

[30:40] So, let's talk about the fifth one. Short salons. All right, this yet and end,

[30:45] another big one that's going to be in a raffle some feathers. So, for a long time, the prevailing

[30:49] idea and content marketing was again a funnel. It's like everything's a funnel. All right. And it was

[30:54] believed that shorts viewers got more people to then watch longs and then those long viewers

[31:01] would then translate into becoming customers. Right? So, people watch shorts and then they watch

[31:06] longs and they give you money. Right? That was kind of the prevailing thought. But again,

[31:11] when we looked at the data, it looked more like this. Short viewers watch more shorts

[31:18] and long viewers watch more longs and customers buy more country. And so the point is that

[31:25] these are different audiences and I will make a note here that this can change by platform.

[31:32] So, I might be a long viewer on one platform and a short viewer or another. And what I do think

[31:38] the magic happens is where you can have shorts in one thing and so someone finds you on TikTok

[31:45] but then they are a longs viewer on YouTube and then they watch your longs there. So, I do think

[31:50] there's an element there but not the way the narrative goes. And so, for us, longs drive a lot more

[31:56] conversions and shorts. Conversions being book sales opt-ins applications. Right? And business-related

[32:02] content, unsurprisingly, brings more business owners than not business-related content. And so,

[32:07] we are going to double down on more longs about that stuff. And change our short strategy to keep

[32:14] the volume the same but focus more on business overall. And again, people watch different

[32:20] different platforms. So, making shorts in order for people to on a different platform much

[32:26] long still carries as far as we know. So, despite the mega obsession with shorts that has

[32:31] kind of prevailed for the last few years because it was a new format of content, we're putting

[32:35] now more emphasis on longs overall. For now, as far as we have data. So, that's number five.

[32:44] Now, let's talk about the sixth one that I'm going all in on. Assume more to assume nothing.

[32:50] All right, so what does this mean? So, let's start with a sum more and what that really means

[32:55] broken down. Assume more means I made content assuming people already knew me.

[33:01] Okay? So, here's an example. The Alex Shermozy Guide Daiders. I might be like, if I don't know

[33:08] who Alex Shermozy is or have never seen that face before, why do I care? If I see the day in

[33:14] the life of Alex Shermozy, yet again, I assume everyone knows me in this. I'm sharing these mistakes

[33:19] with you as far as I'm concerned for getting new people into my world. It wasn't made, I assumed

[33:24] like everybody's getting know me. The Alex Shermozy diet. Everyone knows me. No, they're like, who is this guy?

[33:31] Right? And here's why this matters. If you want your content to bring people who don't know you,

[33:34] which is why many of you guys make content, then you can't assume they do.

[33:39] And so, this is what it looks like tactically. From a headlines perspective, if I were to remake

[33:43] these today, I might try a first crack at business influencer crushers haters and show how you can too.

[33:49] Okay? So now, from clicking, I would understand at least that this guy is a business influencer

[33:54] of some sort of new crushers haters. Okay? Why might want to see haters get crushed?

[33:58] Dan life of $200 per year CEO. Okay? Now, the jet tells this me that this Alex Shermozy

[34:03] from the first one before Alex Shermozy's maybe rich or maybe you can afford a private jet. But now,

[34:07] I know he's a CEO because I could be a rapper. I could be more realistically when I walk around

[34:12] and place that I live, all the people that in my community assume that I'm a football player.

[34:16] It's the number one thing I just like, so you play football where you're the hockey team.

[34:19] And I say no, I can, nope, nothing wrong with that, but no, that's not what I do.

[34:25] And then the third one there, Alex Shermozy diet, 60-hour workday, six-pack diet for business owners,

[34:30] whatever. The point is that we actually make it welcoming to everyone.

[34:36] And so here's what we do this tactfully with the content itself.

[34:39] So we go from they know me to introducing yourself every time. So earlier as like I'm Alex Shermozy,

[34:45] this is what I do, this is the, the surprise I got and whatever, we introduced ourselves.

[34:51] Two, they know why they should listen to me, tell people why they should listen to you every time.

[34:58] Three, the inside jokes, you know how I get. No, I don't know how you get, please fully explain the

[35:02] reference because that references another piece of content that I haven't seen because

[35:05] this is the first video I've seen from you. And if you tell an inside joke and someone doesn't

[35:10] understand the inside joke, guess where they are on the outside and guess where people don't want to be

[35:15] on the outside and guess where people spend money on the inside. And number four, going from

[35:22] acting like you're already friends to pretending everything goes to people who have no idea who you are.

[35:29] And when you make content so people who don't know you can enjoy it, more do.

[35:36] And for those of you who are work, because I can already hear the thoughts that are coming up.

[35:38] So let me just address those right now. I see you. I'm going to lose retention if I introduce myself.

[35:45] Okay, let's play the Eclopper. Would you rather fewer people know who you are or more people who have no

[35:51] clue? Because on one hand, we have some people who know you. And on the other hand, we have lots of

[35:56] people who also don't know you. So you're in the exact same position you were before.

[36:01] Two, well, aren't people going to get sick of this? You're going to keep saying your name every time

[36:07] or keep introducing yourself? Well, from what I can tell, warm people like the reminders

[36:13] and cold people need the introduction. And as a total side note, this is a fun little experiment

[36:20] for everyone here. You can run this when you leave here. If who here actually, who here actually

[36:25] has posted content in the last year? Okay, good, okay. Okay, good. For a second, I was like this would have

[36:30] been really bad if no one had raised their hand. Fantastic. Okay. I want you to look at last year

[36:35] and I want you to look at your number one piece of content. And this is what I want you to do.

[36:39] Just post it again. And then let me know how it does. And I will bet you that it does

[36:47] just as well or better than the stuff that you're posting right now. And let me tell you one reason

[36:53] why I believe that to be true. Because if you have been posting consistently, guess what's also

[36:57] happened. More people have entered your audience. And guess what they haven't seen? That amazing

[37:02] piece of content that everyone from last year said was the number one best thing you ever made.

[37:07] And you know what you said? New people? You don't get that. That was only from my old folks.

[37:11] My OGs. They only get that. No, you got to reintroduce some of the stuff your greatest hits.

[37:15] You got to bring that stuff in. So that the new people also know what your greatest hits are.

[37:19] So that the lore continues to compound and grow. So number three. And this one are sub-point.

[37:27] And this is one for me personally. I follow a bunch of cool accounts. I like comedy and

[37:32] philosophy and like fighting. There's like kind of a category that I follow and gym equipment.

[37:37] And so I get quotes a lot on my newsfeed. But you know what happens when I see a quote from

[37:43] Sophocles or Epictetus yet again that reminds me that I should just tough enough and keep going.

[37:49] I like the reminder. I'm not like Epictetus God. You live 4,000 years ago. Like get over yourself.

[37:55] No, he's not making new content. But guess what people still post it and people still read it because we need

[38:00] to be reminded more than we need to be taught at least I do.

[38:06] To give a little tactical one on this from mainstream because this might resonate for some of the older people in the crowd.

[38:11] There was this thing called television a while back used to be big.

[38:13] Anyways, instead of having it on your phone, it was like this big screen on a wall. It's a whole thing.

[38:18] Anyways, I don't get into it. It's like floppy disk regardless.

[38:21] floppy disk was okay anyway. So they're used to be this thing where at the beginning of every show there was a theme song.

[38:27] Right? So they'd be like cheers wherever everybody knows your name. And there's always a little introduction.

[38:31] It says produce buy and all that stuff. And if those shows that's been gazillions of dollars on testing

[38:38] chose to think that despite selling more advertising space, it was worth having the same exact theme song and

[38:46] introduction for the show, don't you think it might be worth that for us too?

[38:51] And here's an interesting thing, the last thing, positive association since six.

[38:54] If you actually get sing song about how you introduce yourself or the things that you relate to you,

[38:59] it starts to become something that people expect and then they start associating it with all the positive

[39:03] other experiences they had with you. So if I always introduce something a certain way and then I deliver value afterwards,

[39:08] they associate the introduction with the value and guess who else are they associate that with? You.

[39:17] And so for those of you who are concerned, you can add variety to this and I want to show you a cool little real-world example of this.

[39:26] So the Simpsons has the longest standing show to my knowledge that has existed on television.

[39:32] And the introduction is the same. Now Bart would be like 70 by now or whatever his actual age would be if it was actual humans.

[39:38] But it is it, right? And every introduction has Bart at some point in detention writing something on the board.

[39:45] For those of you who don't know the Simpsons, every one of the introductions actually changes.

[39:53] Every one of them. And so they still have the introduction that has all the positive associations with

[40:00] the funny times and the humor and the laugh that you've had with the show.

[40:05] But they introduce a tiny bit of variety into them to keep it interesting. And then what happens is

[40:10] people look forward to these introductions because they want to find the Easter egg.

[40:14] The real fans now get catered to and the new fans don't know about it yet but they will.

[40:21] And so now you actually serve both sides of the audience, the people who know you and the people of

[40:25] first who are just coming cold. And so that's it. Small variation, same introduction, you let the new people in

[40:34] and you give something to the people who already know you. So,

[40:38] title it like they don't know you. Introduce yourself. Say why they should listen.

[40:43] Prioritize the content that makes sense for strangers. Deprioritizing the vlogs the hot six

[40:47] depinians because if you can serve both audiences, serve both. Let the new people in.

[40:53] Rather than have a wall they have to jump over. Let them in on the joke.

[40:57] Fully explain the references that you make. Make all jokes inside jokes for everyone.

[41:03] And then finally, mentally act as though you're always talking to a stranger because if the content

[41:09] does well, you are. At least that's what I'm going to be doing. And so that's the six

[41:17] big change that we're doubling down on. And so now that we cover those changes in my strategy,

[41:21] I just want to get real for a second. Everything has a cost and it's not that other types of media

[41:27] or other topics or other formats don't work. Obviously we had a smorgous sport. We had a huge

[41:32] variety of corner copia. Mirion. Content types. That we did over the last 40-ish months. And obviously

[41:39] it's 7.8 million subscribers and 2 billion views during that time period in a niche audience of

[41:44] business. I'm just pretty good. And so it's not to say that other things don't work.

[41:50] I'd even say that my mess-ups also work to a sort of a small degree. It's just that they didn't

[41:54] work as well as something else might have. And so the game, at least as I see an entrepreneur

[42:00] entrepreneurship is figuring out what's my biggest bang for a buck? What's the content that gets

[42:04] me the most of everything? Because you only have limited resources. You have time money,

[42:08] energy, you put it into your team and that goes on to social media or the media that you market on.

[42:12] And then that has output. And so if you can become more efficient with the inputs you get,

[42:17] you get more output on the other side. And so the question becomes with the resources I have,

[42:22] how can I maximize the number of the right people who find out about my stuff? And so this is

[42:28] something that I live by. Anything works better than nothing. So raise your hand right now

[42:32] if you haven't made a piece of content in 90 days. Okay, just do something. Because if you do something,

[42:39] you will do better than what you're currently doing. Two, some things work better than others.

[42:47] And three, nothing works forever. And so the requirement of the entrepreneur is to start doing

[42:55] something, see what works better. And then do as much of that as they possibly can for as long as they

[43:01] can until it slows down and then figure out what the next thing to do is. And then do as much of

[43:07] the content of that. So is that helpful in terms of understanding content and media? Awesome.

[43:14] Do you feel like you got at least one lesson without the scars, it's at least a tiny percentage of

[43:18] the $4 million that I spent learning what didn't work. So I could show you these six things that do.

[43:22] Okay, good. Would you like more stuff like this? Okay. Well then I've got a bunch of

[43:30] stuff that I can give you to help you grow your brand and make some money. That'd be all right? Okay.

[43:34] So if you're just starting a business right now, raise your hand. Okay, this is for you.

[43:39] On the co-founder of the school games, inside you'll find courses, full day trainings,

[43:44] the easiest business model they know. I have to use this media stuff. Because it's one thing to

[43:48] just say like, oh, great. I just watched this whole thing on media. Now do I do? Well, this gives

[43:52] you somewhere to actually practice it, like a sandbox. You can learn it and you learn by doing.

[43:57] This is one of the lowest takes away to make money, get your first dollar across the finish line.

[44:01] And so fun facts, something I'm very proud of is that right now 30.44% of people finish their

[44:05] first month, make their first dollar online by starting an online community. I think that's pretty cool.

[44:11] And so you can start that for free by going to school.com for it slash games. All right.

[44:16] Tell on my sense you. So that's for everybody. Raise your hand and go visit.

[44:19] Uh, you're starting a business right now. Okay. That's for you. Now, if you're a little further

[44:24] along in your business journey, I've got free stuff for you too. All right. Trying to feel like

[44:28] Santa Claus today. I wrote these two books right now, which have 25,000 five store reviews and they sold

[44:32] a million plus copies. And I made courses for each of those books that are free. On my site,

[44:39] I'm good at acquisition.com for such training. So if you like this stuff, you don't learn about

[44:42] offers. You're about advertising. We're about getting leads, paid ads, content, all of that stuff.

[44:46] So you can start making money within your business or scale it from wherever you are.

[44:49] To everyone to go, I've made this stuff for you. These are real courses. It's not part of any

[44:53] where you can click there. Watch them all. All right. See, I put that for myself because this is how

[44:59] I roll again in the zone. So otherwise, you guys roll amazing. You can go there for stuff that will

[45:06] help you practice this stuff actually doing the real world. Because if you just walk away from here

[45:11] today, and you do not execute anything, you learned nothing. And so for the love of God,

[45:17] just do one of the things. So you can get a tiny percent of that four million dollars and the 35

[45:21] thousand pieces of content and the thousand hours that it's meant recording. Just do one of them.

[45:25] So you can take that lesson for you. Thank you guys.

[00:00] What's going on everyone happy?

[00:01] Whatever day it is that you were watching this.

[00:03] I get messages all the time, all the time,

[00:07] and comments about what are your favorite books.

[00:09] And maybe in another video or podcast, I will do an exploratory,

[00:14] you know what I mean of the books that have been most influential.

[00:17] But, the main honest, I didn't really start reading

[00:21] a ton until after I had made a lot of, you know,

[00:24] a relatively high amount of money, right?

[00:27] And I started reading when I had more time, right?

[00:31] So it would be kind of backwards for me to say,

[00:33] hey, these are the things that created my success.

[00:34] When in reality, I feel like I started reading

[00:37] when I had the time and be like, oh, this is really interesting.

[00:41] And so, I think that to kind of make this story full circle,

[00:45] before I even started my first business,

[00:47] I was definitely a seeker, which is like,

[00:50] you're just looking for something, you're searching for something

[00:52] that's because you just realize that something's wrong with your life, right?

[00:55] And that's kind of how I felt when I had my jet-mic consulting job,

[00:58] which is what I took after college.

[01:00] And during that time period, I read all the time.

[01:03] And I remember realizing after six or 12 months

[01:07] of just reading book after book after book,

[01:09] of self-help and personal development and all that kind of stuff,

[01:13] that my life was literally the same.

[01:15] And I remember this was kind of like a jarring moment for me,

[01:18] because I just sat there, I finished a book,

[01:19] and then I thought to myself, and it was like the happiness advantage,

[01:22] or whatever, right?

[01:23] And I was like, my life is not any different than it was

[01:28] before I started reading these books.

[01:30] And so I thought about it for a while,

[01:32] and I also realized that half the book's contradiction to each other,

[01:35] and it was like, man, this is really difficult.

[01:38] And so, what I ended up, my conclusion was,

[01:41] I wouldn't read a book unless I executed everything in the book.

[01:44] And so, what ended up happening next was,

[01:46] I became very, very selective about what books I would read,

[01:49] because I wouldn't get another book until I have felt

[01:52] like I had executed that.

[01:53] And so, the result of that was,

[01:55] instead of reading lots of books,

[01:56] I started reading a handful of books a lot of times.

[01:59] And so, that was really transformational for me.

[02:01] I think the first book that I read a lot of times

[02:03] was, how do my friends and influence people?

[02:05] And I still think to this day, if you just did nothing else

[02:07] in business, but just practice what is in that book,

[02:10] you would be phenomenally successful.

[02:11] Like, you know what I mean?

[02:12] Like, if you just did the things that are in that book,

[02:14] you'd be phenomenally successful.

[02:16] But that's kind of more like personal traits and character traits

[02:19] in one now, which I think are very important for,

[02:21] you know, growing developing.

[02:23] But in terms of skills, right?

[02:25] And I would say the number one, you know,

[02:27] number one and number two things that I get asked about are like,

[02:29] hey, how did you develop your skill of marketing

[02:30] and then how did you develop your skills sales?

[02:32] And truth be told, I never did a single sales training.

[02:37] I never read a single sales book before I started selling.

[02:42] And so, I wish I had like a really sexy answer for you,

[02:44] but I don't.

[02:44] I just started selling.

[02:46] And I didn't even know that what I was doing was selling.

[02:49] I was just like, how do I get people to sign up for my gym

[02:52] and give me money?

[02:53] Like, I didn't even know that term was sales at the time.

[02:55] I was just like, I have to get them to give me money.

[02:58] And so, I think a lot of people spend way too much time

[03:01] in the like deliberation stage and like the trying to,

[03:03] there, you spend all your effort in the,

[03:05] I would say like productive procrastination space

[03:08] of just like thinking you're getting better,

[03:10] but you would get so much better just doing it, right?

[03:12] And so, only like, and people now,

[03:15] respect what I have to say about sales

[03:17] because I've sold so much, not because of how many books

[03:19] I've ever had on sales, right?

[03:20] And so, I think that once I was considered very good at sales,

[03:24] I had, you know, I was managing multiple sales teams

[03:27] and we were doing, you know, a few hundred thousand or some month.

[03:29] That is the first time I bought a sales product.

[03:31] I think about that.

[03:33] And I went through it and I was like,

[03:34] oh, this is good stuff.

[03:35] You know, like there's stuff in here that way we can use,

[03:37] like, neat.

[03:38] But like, I don't think it fundamentally changed

[03:40] how good I was at selling.

[03:42] And I think that that's because so much of selling

[03:44] is about conviction is about how much you believe in the product,

[03:47] more so than like the, the judo chops, right?

[03:50] So how much you care about the prospect

[03:51] and how much you care about the product,

[03:53] and convince that the product will help them.

[03:54] Because if you truly talk from a space of genuine care,

[03:56] like genuine care about a prospect,

[03:58] you won't convince them to do something that they shouldn't do.

[04:01] And if you genuinely believe that your product or service

[04:04] is going to help people, then making the sales very easy

[04:07] because it's like, I really care about you

[04:08] and I really know that this product works

[04:10] and so let me just like help you connect these two dots.

[04:12] And so that's, like, ultimately, like,

[04:14] that is what selling is and should be.

[04:16] The problem is most people don't believe in their product

[04:18] and they don't care about their prospects, right?

[04:20] And so because of that, they come into all this cognitive

[04:22] dissonance, meaning like, they believe themselves

[04:24] to be good people, but at the same time they need to make money

[04:27] and then those two things become at odds

[04:28] and that becomes really difficult to sell

[04:30] because now you're faced with a more obligation

[04:33] to like your family to try and provide

[04:36] and then against yourself to be ethical, right?

[04:38] And that becomes really hard for people

[04:40] and that's why a lot of sales guys get burned out

[04:41] when they find out more about whatever they're selling.

[04:43] And so that's why a lot of times sales guys will start

[04:45] out hot and then crashed

[04:46] just because they find out that what they were selling

[04:47] with, what they were sold to sell is actually not

[04:51] what it really is cracked up to be.

[04:52] And then once they find that out, then all of a sudden,

[04:54] that's why in my belief there's way more churn

[04:57] in sales people than what otherwise be necessary

[04:59] if they were all selling something they believed in, right?

[05:02] So back to the main point, which is, what do I do

[05:05] if I don't like, if I have no way of, you know,

[05:09] a practicing?

[05:10] Well, I mean, honestly, when I want to do something,

[05:13] what I do is I buy a course about how to do something

[05:16] and then I follow the course and do it.

[05:18] So if I wanted to make a webinar,

[05:19] then I bought a course and making a webinar

[05:21] and then I followed the course to make the webinar.

[05:22] And so I learned the skill while I was going through the course.

[05:24] I don't think there's a lot of productive time and usage

[05:29] in learning stuff for the sake of learning.

[05:33] Like, it's, and I don't even, how do you even make the argument

[05:35] that you don't even truly learn it until you've applied it?

[05:39] And so like, how do you know if you read

[05:41] six books on sales and they have different strategies,

[05:43] which one is the right one

[05:45] because you've never tested it in the battlefield, right?

[05:47] It doesn't make any sense.

[05:49] And so like the same thing with marketing.

[05:51] I never bought a copywriting course.

[05:54] I never bought any courses on how build landing pages.

[05:56] Never bought any courses on how to run ads.

[05:59] The only thing I did was I spent money,

[06:02] one on one to get someone to train me

[06:03] literally how to click to run ads from my gym.

[06:06] But I learned a little bit, I learned enough on my own.

[06:09] And so that's the thing is like,

[06:10] I think there's definitely a space for one on training.

[06:13] I think the biggest gains I've made

[06:15] have been from investing in people who are above me

[06:17] to break my beliefs about what was possible.

[06:20] Because the people who are above you most of the times

[06:22] are not gonna like, they're not gonna hold your hand

[06:24] and teach you how to write copy.

[06:25] This is not gonna happen.

[06:26] You know what I mean?

[06:27] Like they might edit, you know, copy you have

[06:28] if you have like a one on one relationship,

[06:30] something like that.

[06:31] But for the most part, like it's gonna be up to you

[06:33] to go acquire the skills and most of the time

[06:35] acquiring the skills comes from doing them,

[06:37] which means you're gonna suck for a while.

[06:38] And I think just most people

[06:39] aren't willing to drive because they think

[06:41] that if they are perfect, they'll somehow not fail

[06:43] the first time, which is stupid

[06:44] because if you're really good, you're gonna fail.

[06:46] So it's just people like procrastinating

[06:49] and reading books about something that they haven't done

[06:51] is a productive way of feeling accomplished

[06:53] without actually doing anything.

[06:54] And so I say all this to say,

[06:57] for the many people who ask me,

[06:59] what are my favorite books on sales and marketing?

[07:02] My favorite book on sales is to get out there

[07:04] and start selling, right?

[07:05] Because if you start selling and then read a book on sales,

[07:08] it will make far more sense to you

[07:09] than trying to read a book on sales before we start selling.

[07:12] Because you won't even know what they're talking about, right?

[07:15] Same thing with marketing, right?

[07:16] Like if you want to go and learn about marketing,

[07:18] the best thing to do is start, you know,

[07:20] learn how to run an ad.

[07:21] You run an ad, do a learning page,

[07:23] and then start getting some people

[07:24] who give you their contact information

[07:26] and then pick up the phone and call them.

[07:27] Like you don't even mean,

[07:28] and the easiest thing to do in my opinion

[07:30] is the advice that I got from Ezra Firestone years ago,

[07:33] which is give yourself a slash fund, right?

[07:34] Give yourself a learning budget,

[07:36] which is how much am I willing to quote,

[07:38] blow this month on failure,

[07:40] so I can learn the skills faster.

[07:41] And whatever that percentage is,

[07:42] it might be 10% of what you make every month,

[07:44] it might be 5% of it might be 25%.

[07:46] It just depends on who you are

[07:47] and how stable your income is,

[07:48] but if you just say,

[07:49] I'm willing to give $500 a month to learning the skill,

[07:53] then you don't have this like emotional attachment

[07:55] to whether or not you crush it your first time,

[07:56] because you're seeing this $500 investment

[08:00] is truly that and investment in your education,

[08:02] your investment in trial and error,

[08:04] rather than, you know,

[08:06] like I bought this course for copyright,

[08:08] I'm not a millionaire, what's wrong, right?

[08:09] When in reality, just have to get out there

[08:10] and start doing it.

[08:11] So, any who, that's my, that is my two cents.

[08:14] I made most of my money before I started reading a lot of books.

[08:17] I would say, like seriously,

[08:19] I read maybe 30 books before we, you know,

[08:21] we're decommelioners, you know what I mean?

[08:24] And so, I wish I had something better for you,

[08:28] but I focus most of my time on doing it applying,

[08:30] and when I start applying,

[08:32] then I will go read for specific solutions to a bottleneck

[08:36] that I have rather than try to learn in a more fistopic

[08:39] by reading words from multiple books

[08:41] and trying to get perspectives,

[08:42] different angles on problems

[08:44] I've never even encountered yet, right?

[08:45] I think it's much better to encounter the problems,

[08:48] then start seeking the solutions

[08:50] and trying to cover every solution

[08:52] to every problem before you even start the race.

[08:54] So, anyways, hopefully found that valuable,

[08:56] I hope that made sense,

[08:56] lots of love keeping you awesome, and I could just do it.

[08:58] Bye!

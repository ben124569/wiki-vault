[00:00] In this video, many of you have three ways

[00:01] to guarantee that people do not do what you want them to do,

[00:03] especially, employees in a business.

[00:05] Every one of us every day has tried to influence people,

[00:08] internally in the business, to do things that we want them to do.

[00:09] We tried to influence them with money,

[00:11] we tried to influence them with praise and accolades,

[00:13] with a big vision so that they get internally motivated

[00:15] to do the stuff, but some people don't do it.

[00:17] And this video, what I want to do is break down the three best ways

[00:20] to guarantee that no one does what you want them to do.

[00:22] You can take this process and you can reverse it

[00:24] if you want them to do what you want them to do.

[00:25] But if we think about the things that we can do,

[00:27] to get them to not want to do what we want them to do,

[00:29] then it's much fun.

[00:30] From the top, the easiest way to make sure

[00:33] that they do not do what you want them to do is don't tell them.

[00:36] Don't communicate the excitation.

[00:37] Don't even let them know that you want them to do it.

[00:40] If you even do let them know that you want to do it,

[00:42] make sure you don't record it.

[00:43] Because if you just say,

[00:43] in passing, you're saying it on a conversation or zoom call,

[00:46] and it's not written anywhere,

[00:47] you can still virtually guarantee that they're not going to do it.

[00:48] And especially if you don't repeat it.

[00:49] Don't ask about it frequently.

[00:50] One line item on a quarterly report that happens,

[00:53] versus you checking in twice a day about a statistic.

[00:56] Like if you do that,

[00:57] they're definitely going to think it's important, so don't do that.

[00:59] Just trying to ask for it as infrequently as possible,

[01:02] even so, not even give them the metric to track.

[01:04] So that's number one.

[01:05] Number two is make sure they don't know how to do it.

[01:08] So if you want them to do something,

[01:09] give them the tasks that's clearly communicated.

[01:12] You've repeated it, you did it in a recorded fashion,

[01:14] you do it frequently in terms of how frequently asked them,

[01:16] but then just make sure they don't know how to do it.

[01:18] It's the best way to set them up to fail.

[01:19] Don't train them around what you want them to do in general.

[01:22] Don't train them on how to prioritize their time

[01:24] so that they can get it done given their workload.

[01:26] And then also make sure that you don't tell them how you

[01:28] specifically like it does,

[01:29] because everybody has preferences, right?

[01:31] Just make sure you don't train them on any of those things.

[01:33] First two items in the triangle.

[01:35] Alex is how to make sure people don't do

[01:37] what you want them to do triangle.

[01:38] The third piece of this triangle.

[01:40] All right, this is a killer motivation.

[01:43] We want to make sure that they are as unmotivated

[01:45] seemingly possible.

[01:46] And maybe even ideally, motivated or incentivized

[01:49] to not do it.

[01:50] A couple of least you can do that is one,

[01:51] don't pay them or directly compensate them for doing it.

[01:54] Number two, you want the work to feel as pointless as possible.

[01:57] You want them to feel like they're digging a hole

[01:59] only to push the dirt back in at the end of the day

[02:01] and then have no one there to even see that they did it.

[02:03] You want to definitely not praise them for digging a good hole.

[02:06] And then not actually show them that that hole

[02:08] is how you lay pipe.

[02:12] How you lay electrical lines to turn a building on.

[02:16] Geez, I'm just killing it right now.

[02:18] You don't want to show how it benefits other people

[02:20] that they care about within the company.

[02:22] So for example, if I said, hey, John,

[02:23] I need you to put the call notes in from your sales call

[02:26] because Susie and finance, it makes her like five times harder

[02:29] to have to go through all this stuff

[02:30] and she can't be with her kid

[02:32] because she's working overtime taking all these calls

[02:34] trying to glean all this data going through customer support logs

[02:37] to fill in the blanks that you could do in five minutes.

[02:39] And I know that you're the type of person

[02:40] so we went from purpose, other people they care about,

[02:42] to now we're gonna talk about their own self interest.

[02:44] Which is like, I know you're the type of person

[02:45] who is honest, right?

[02:47] Of course, well, you wouldn't promise something

[02:48] that's not real, right?

[02:49] Okay, well, what you're doing right now,

[02:50] you might not know what is it.

[02:51] You're not giving us the notes to actually

[02:52] fill in the promises you're making.

[02:54] So I peeled the values and then you can also

[02:55] peel the self interest in the most tangible way.

[02:57] You make more money by doing this.

[02:58] When you do this thing, it actually helps us sort

[03:00] through the applications so you can close a higher

[03:02] percentage to people at higher prices.

[03:04] So you make more money per hour if you take these five minutes.

[03:06] Does that make sense?

[03:07] Cool, and on top of that, there's a little nugget

[03:09] on your bonuses according to making sure that you

[03:11] fill out condo, it's for over 95% of sales calls.

[03:13] If we did that, we'd have a high likely that they would do it.

[03:16] So you wanna reverse that whole equation.

[03:17] When you're thinking about having a lens to rich

[03:19] to have the conversation with somebody

[03:21] who's not doing the things that you want them to do,

[03:22] this is how I would approach it.

[03:23] This is the scripting I got this from Leila,

[03:25] all alcudos got her, she's a great YouTube channel,

[03:26] she should check it out.

[03:27] It is say, hey, Johnny, it's not like you

[03:30] to not attend to the details.

[03:31] Is it that you didn't know you don't know how,

[03:34] or is it that you don't want to?

[03:35] One, we protected the person to you

[03:36] because we said it's not like you.

[03:37] So I'm not attacking you.

[03:38] I'm attacking the activity.

[03:39] It's this tiny little shift that makes these conversations

[03:41] so it's easier.

[03:42] Then you give them a context through which

[03:43] that they can reply.

[03:44] Is it that you didn't know?

[03:45] I didn't tell you, I didn't record it.

[03:47] I didn't talk about it frequently

[03:48] and I didn't give you the metrics.

[03:48] Is that what it is?

[03:49] Or is it that training-wise, I didn't train you

[03:52] on how to do it, how I want you to do it,

[03:53] and how to do it, and how to do it

[03:54] within the context of your larger workload?

[03:55] Or is it?

[03:56] I think that I just covered with motivation.

[03:57] Motivation and training, I stole from Andy Grove,

[04:00] ruthlessly, a founder of Intel,

[04:01] and he wrote a book called High Up Management,

[04:03] Recommend, a little bit of advance.

[04:04] And in that book, he says, the job of the boss

[04:05] is two things to motivate and train.

[04:07] In his mind, he's at either someone doesn't want to do it,

[04:09] or they don't know how to do it.

[04:09] I add in the third piece, which is that they didn't know

[04:12] that you wanted to do it to begin with,

[04:13] which I think happens a lot.

[04:14] And so that has given birth to the acquisition triangle

[04:17] of how to get people to not do the things

[04:18] that you want them to do.

[04:19] On the flip side, you reverse those things,

[04:20] and make sure that you set expectations,

[04:22] you record it, you talk about it frequently,

[04:24] you give them the metrics to talk about it about.

[04:25] Train them on how to do it, you train them how you prefer

[04:28] they do it, and then you train them on how to do it

[04:29] within the context of the larger workload they have.

[04:31] And then you motivate them from a global level

[04:33] of how this feeds the business,

[04:35] the other people that care about,

[04:36] employees on how it impacts their life in a row way,

[04:37] how it's going to help the customer and their experience

[04:40] from a values perspective.

[04:41] You are this way, and by doing this,

[04:43] you are aligning with these values that are true to you.

[04:45] And then finally, you will align to their pocketbook.

[04:47] Hey, and if you do these things,

[04:49] you can get a 500-dollar bonus, right, or a thousand-dollar bonus,

[04:51] whatever it is.

[04:52] Keeping awesome imagination, I love you all.

[04:53] Don't deserve you.

[04:55] Keep being great, see you in the next one.

[04:56] Bye!

## Full Transcript
[00:00] I'm going to show you how to get your first five customers in ten steps.

[00:03] The wild world of YouTube has videos everywhere telling you how to scale and grow.

[00:06] But I think people overcomplicate it.

[00:08] And so this is actually a sneak peek from my new book.

[00:10] $100 million dollars. It's come down.

[00:12] 819 you can go to actors.com forward slash leads.

[00:15] Let's dive in.

[00:16] So the first step to getting this going is you need to get a list.

[00:18] But I don't have a list, Alex.

[00:20] Your dance rate you do.

[00:21] Number one, I want you to go to your email account.

[00:24] The pool, all the contacts that you have in there.

[00:26] Anybody that you've ever messaged or emailed, that becomes list one.

[00:29] List two is I want you to go to every single social media profile that you have.

[00:32] But your social media profile is where you can direct message people.

[00:35] So if you have followers that you can DM, I want you to write down every single one of those people.

[00:39] List number three.

[00:40] Pull out your phone.

[00:42] Look for your contacts and when you export them.

[00:44] List one is all your email contacts.

[00:46] List two is all of your social contacts.

[00:48] And list three is all of your phone and private personal contacts.

[00:51] If you add all three of those together, you will have a shitload more leads than you thought you did.

[00:55] You're like, wait, you're going to ask me to contact these people?

[00:57] Slow down.

[00:58] Not yet and we're not going to do it in a really weird way.

[01:00] I'm sure I had to do it in a classy way.

[01:02] This how I started every business I have and have people think before.

[01:04] The second step is that you pick a platform.

[01:06] All right, so you have all these contacts, but you're going to have to pick one platform that

[01:09] you're going to start messaging or emailing them with.

[01:12] Start with the one that you have the most people on.

[01:14] So if you have the most Instagram people or you have the most email contact, you're more

[01:17] people in your phone than any of those, start there.

[01:19] Step three.

[01:20] But what do I say?

[01:21] You personalize your message.

[01:22] So what you want to do is you want to use something you already know about the personal

[01:26] prospect in order to initiate reaching out to them.

[01:29] This is also just called being a human being.

[01:31] What you do is you take 30 seconds.

[01:32] You look at someone's profile and you say, oh, they have got this thing.

[01:34] We have something in common and you can reach out to them with that as your primary message.

[01:38] So for example, you're like, hey, saw you got a baby.

[01:41] Hey, saw you switched jobs.

[01:42] Hey, saw you move.

[01:44] Hey, you saw that movie last weekend.

[01:45] It doesn't matter.

[01:47] All you need to show is that you took a few seconds to actually not just blast some sort

[01:52] of message.

[01:53] Step four.

[01:55] And you reach out to 100 people every single day.

[01:58] So let's say you had 3000 people between all your emails, all your phone contacts

[02:01] and every single follower across all your social media.

[02:04] It took you 20 years to send your first DM and it'll take you two minutes to send

[02:07] the second one.

[02:08] Everything must be hard before it can be easy.

[02:10] So just get over the hump, send it, just something so you can realize that you won't

[02:14] die.

[02:15] Step five.

[02:16] What do I say if they reply?

[02:17] You warm them up.

[02:18] I use a framework that I call ACA.

[02:20] You acknowledge, compliment, and you ask.

[02:22] For example, I can acknowledge and say, oh, so you have two kids.

[02:26] You're going to compliment them about the thing.

[02:27] So it's like, wow, you have two kids.

[02:29] You must be a super mom.

[02:30] Working full time and having two kids.

[02:32] And when we go to ask, we're going to tie our ask to the compliment.

[02:36] We just gave them.

[02:36] Then we transition to whatever type of question it's going to lead them to the service

[02:41] we sell.

[02:41] If I was selling weight loss, I'd be like, hey, so you're super on how do you time to eat

[02:45] right and work out?

[02:46] Wait a second.

[02:47] This sounds like selling.

[02:48] It's not.

[02:50] Step six.

[02:50] Invite their friends.

[02:52] When you're talking about this stuff, you're not going to sell them.

[02:56] This is fucking huge.

[02:57] You're not going to solicit them.

[02:59] You asked a question.

[03:00] They're going to tell you stuff.

[03:01] And then it's going to be like, oh, yeah.

[03:03] By the way, do you know anyone who's looking for X, Y, and Z?

[03:08] Because I'm opening up a few slots to help people do exactly that.

[03:12] You're just asking them if they know anybody.

[03:14] And since your friends with them and since your contacts, you're asking them for a

[03:17] favor.

[03:18] You're not asking them to buy from you.

[03:19] This should make you not feel weird about messaging people.

[03:22] If they say, hey, I'd like to find out more.

[03:25] Now what they have done is they've transitioned from a lead to an engaged lead.

[03:29] A lead is somebody that you can contact.

[03:31] An engaged lead is someone who you can contact, comma, who has showed interest in the thing

[03:35] that you sell.

[03:36] If she says, I haven't been able to keep up with my workouts, et cetera.

[03:39] Now they have shown interest in the thing.

[03:42] Well, then how do I get them to buy from it?

[03:43] We're going to give them the easiest often the world to say yes to if you're going to

[03:46] make it free.

[03:47] They probably know that you're not that experienced.

[03:49] Just be honest.

[03:50] The reason we do it for free is you say, hey, I'm going to do all this stuff for free as

[03:53] long as you promise to do three things.

[03:54] One, you actually use my service.

[03:56] Two, you give me feedback on it.

[03:57] And three, leave a killer review if you think it deserves one.

[04:01] Those are the terms of exchange.

[04:02] The reason I want you to start with that is that one, it'll get you more reps.

[04:05] Two, you probably suck.

[04:07] Three, you need to learn how to suck less and you suck less by doing more.

[04:10] It's way easier to get more people to work with you if you lower the barrier to free.

[04:13] You're actually getting the better end of the deal.

[04:16] You might be wondering why I just mush the shit that's been added in my hand.

[04:19] And it's because the launch of my second book, $100 million leads, is both nutritious,

[04:25] natural, and we'll make you lots of money unlike bananas.

[04:28] But the event itself, where I'll be launching it on Saturday, August, 19th, will be bananas.

[04:32] I've spent over a million dollars in the event itself and I'm going to be giving away

[04:35] a secret thing that I've been working on for over four years to everyone who's there with

[04:39] me live.

[04:40] And I would love to tell you what it is to kill me inside that I cannot tell you.

[04:43] I want the surprise itself to be worth it and I think it will be.

[04:46] This is a date that you're not going to miss it today after my birthday and it's my way

[04:49] of giving back to you guys for being so awesome.

[04:50] Click the link, register, and I'll see you guys later.

[04:52] I'll tell you the quick story of Warren Buffett and Ben Graham.

[04:56] Ben Graham was the goat back in the day for investing.

[04:59] Warren Buffett was just a kid out of Columbia and wanted to go learn investing.

[05:02] And he offered to work for Graham for free.

[05:05] Graham said you're getting the better end of the deal.

[05:07] The acronym is your overpriced.

[05:09] So free was too expensive for Graham because Graham knew that he was going to invest more

[05:14] in getting Warren good enough to actually work for him.

[05:16] And so right now these customers and they are very much customer because they are exchanging

[05:20] something for your service.

[05:21] They're exchanging their time and their effort and some stuff later that you're going to

[05:24] have them do.

[05:25] Just because you're not getting paid doesn't mean it's free but it is monetarily free.

[05:29] So, go the round.

[05:30] I'm going to give you two versions of this.

[05:33] You say by the way, do you know anybody who is described their struggles?

[05:37] Looking to Dream Alcom in Time Delight.

[05:40] I'm taking on five key studies for free because that's all I can handle.

[05:44] I just want to get some testimonials for my service or product.

[05:47] And we're being honest because this is a first business and you're fucking have no idea

[05:50] what you're doing so you better not take more than five customers.

[05:52] I just had a grown named XX or with me to get Dream Alcom.

[05:58] Even though she described the same struggle the person you're talking to is struggling

[06:00] with, I'd like to get more testimonials to show it works across different scenarios.

[06:04] Is anyone you like come to mind if they say no, here's a really funny way you can respond

[06:08] to that.

[06:09] Do you say, ha ha does anyone you hate come to mind?

[06:12] Honestly, that's when you'll sometimes get the real response.

[06:14] If you don't have time to say all of those things, you just say, I help the type of customer

[06:20] get Dream Alcom in Time period without effort and sacrifice and I guarantee XX YZ to decrease

[06:25] risk.

[06:26] That's it.

[06:27] That's if you just have that moment to deliver one thing of what do I do?

[06:29] Some special snowflakes are going to be like, you should never show your time

[06:32] for nothing.

[06:33] You suck.

[06:34] You never done this before.

[06:35] So it would be unreasonable for you to be good.

[06:37] Why would you want to sell sucky service to people you know?

[06:40] If people don't want to work with you, even for free, then ask them why.

[06:43] Because the reason that someone tells you they don't want to work with you, even for

[06:46] free, is because they're hitting costs associated with whatever thing you sell.

[06:50] If you figure out what all those hitting costs are, you can eliminate those hitting costs.

[06:55] And then be able to charge significantly more for your solution later compared to the

[06:59] other people who charge for it and still include those hitting costs.

[07:02] So give you an example.

[07:03] I got solicited in this exact manner and a guy message me and said, I want to do your

[07:07] short from videos for you.

[07:08] You don't have to do anything.

[07:09] I will take all the stuff you already have online and I will make them for you and I'll

[07:13] even post them for you.

[07:14] Like you actually just need to say yes.

[07:15] And so I said yes.

[07:16] And guess what?

[07:17] You started making short videos and he started accepting payment because he had removed the

[07:19] hidden costs.

[07:20] If people get value from this thing that you have, especially if it's free, they're far more

[07:24] likely to leave positive reviews, give you feedback and send their friends and family.

[07:29] Once we have that, we have our first customers.

[07:31] Now we go to step 8.

[07:32] You start back at the top.

[07:34] So you had that big list and we hit all of the months and back you get.

[07:36] So some of those people by the way, when you ask them if they know anybody, they actually

[07:38] just give you people that they know they might help and you get free leads.

[07:41] Because if you reach out to 3000 people with a free thing, you'll get 5 people who will

[07:45] take you up on it.

[07:46] I promise you.

[07:47] So now you're like, but Alex, I can't work for free forever.

[07:49] Now we're on step 9.

[07:50] Dark charging.

[07:51] Once people start referring, that's when you know you were good enough to start charging.

[07:55] When this happens, all you do is you go back up to the script that I just read to you and

[07:58] you change free to 80% off.

[08:01] And you say that's for the next five.

[08:02] What do you do after that?

[08:03] Change to 80% to 60%.

[08:05] After you get those five, change to 40.

[08:06] Then to 20.

[08:07] Then you're at full price.

[08:08] But guess what?

[08:09] Doesn't have to stop there.

[08:11] You can go 20% over.

[08:12] You can go 40% over that because there are no rules.

[08:15] And if at that point you're way better, you may merit that because of the value that you

[08:18] deliver.

[08:19] Because ideally, you're charging full retail, but now you're at 10x the value.

[08:23] Value that you have done has gotten better because you figured out from the feedback

[08:26] that these people that work with you for free have told you so that you can make it even

[08:30] better for people to pay you.

[08:32] Once you have those people and you started transitioning, congratulations, you are in

[08:35] business and you are making money.

[08:37] You will at some point reach capacity.

[08:39] When you fill up all your slots with free people and discounted people, now you have true

[08:44] scarcity.

[08:45] And so you can ethically sell with conviction that you really don't have that much room.

[08:50] They will desire you more because you are scarce from a resource perspective.

[08:54] And then they will pay the same or premium in order to work with you.

[08:57] And then you turn to your free person and you say, I am accepting somebody who is paying

[09:02] full boat in order to do this.

[09:04] If you would like me to keep doing this for you, you would have to start paying to match

[09:07] them.

[09:08] Are you comfortable with that?

[09:09] If they're not, no sweat because all you did is you helped them for free.

[09:13] And you say, no worries, can I get the killer review you asked me for?

[09:17] I asked you for.

[09:18] And those free people, you have to love and cherish them more than anyone else in your life.

[09:21] Because they're going to get you to business in three different ways.

[09:23] They're going to leave you reviews that are going to get you to business.

[09:26] They're going to send you people that are going to get you business.

[09:28] And three, they themselves may transition into paying you, which will also get you business.

[09:31] Don't think short.

[09:32] Think long and you'll make long money.

[09:34] Now you have paying customers, you're reaching your capacity, you're consistently raising

[09:37] your price because now there is more demand than you have supply.

[09:40] And we have artificially created a condition for profit.

[09:43] So what's the 10 step?

[09:44] Keep them warm.

[09:45] You've got this big list of people, check in like a human being.

[09:47] Provide value to them on a regular basis.

[09:49] When you do that, you continue to reinforce and deposit goodwill in the audience because

[09:53] what will happen eventually is you won't even need to ask them because you've provided

[09:57] enough value.

[09:58] You're posting enough testimonials, enough results, talking about some of the entrance stuff

[10:01] that you're doing right now that people will be like, hey, that's actually pretty cool.

[10:04] Hey, can I find out more about that?

[10:05] And then they will actually start soliciting you.

[10:07] And that's the game.

[10:09] That's how you go from zero to hero and get your first five paying customers.

[00:00] We double the profit of a $5 million business in less than eight weeks and we followed a single specific process that I'll break out in this video

[00:07] And at the very end of the video I'll walk you through a hypothetical example of a cab's business that would be the best

[00:11] But whatever that taught people how to grow their cabs so you can apply to your business using the same process

[00:16] So I want you to imagine that you have a business or you'd like to start a business that has a hundred customers that

[00:21] Hey, 100 dollars a month. I'm trying to use the simplest math possible. So a hundred customers

[00:25] 100 dollars a month. So I mean, it's doing 10 thousand dollars a month in revenue now

[00:29] Let's assume that in order to fill those customers we have

[00:33] $8,000 a month in cost so making 2,000 dollars a month in profit and $1,000

[00:36] Top line 2,000 dollars bottom line $8,000 of cost. That's the business now you rub a magic iPad

[00:44] A genius appears and this is not any kind of genius

[00:46] This is a very a business genius and this niche genius has one wish that he can grant you and so he says I can grant you one wish

[00:53] He says I will double your business in one of three ways

[00:56] You need to tell me which way you want me to do. Don't number one or wish great to number one is

[01:01] I will double the amount of customers that you bring in every month with this business

[01:05] Let's assume that your turn is not that good

[01:07] So people stay for an average three months. Number two. I will double your price

[01:12] So you have the same amount of customers and I'll double how much they pay you every single month nothing else will change

[01:16] During number three he says now what I'll do is I'll double how long they stay so instead of staying for three months

[01:21] They'll stay for six months wish of the wishes. Do you take the genie up on really be honest in the comments

[01:27] Tell me what your first guess was gonna be a B or say so with door A

[01:32] He doubles it so now we have

[01:34] 200 customers a month what happens? Well, if we have 200 customers paying us a month

[01:38] We now are making $20,000 in top line revenue and assuming everything skilled

[01:42] Proportionally we would have four thousand dollars a month in profit and 16 thousand dollars a month in cost double number of customers

[01:49] We double the amount of profit double our business awesome. Let's go to door three because people are staying twice as long

[01:55] But you're getting the same amount of customers per month eventually you will get to the same equilibrium point as the first one

[02:01] The exception is that that wish accomplished does something more powerful

[02:06] Which is it increases your LTV now because of that and the additional months that they pay you most businesses

[02:12] It's more profitable the last month someone pays them the first usually it cost a back position cost of onboarding

[02:17] There's more cost to say with getting a new customer than keeping someone if you can double the lifetime risk profit per customer

[02:22] Then your cost of acquisition can be bigger than it could in the first exam here

[02:26] I eventually get to the same top line

[02:28] But I have more bottom links that didn't have to spend as much of marketing so between A and C you pick C now you're like all right

[02:34] Well, what about door B?

[02:36] So let's say we had the same hundred customers

[02:38] But now instead of paying a hundred dollars a month they're paying two hundred dollars a month

[02:41] We still have the same cost of fulfilling them say thousand dollars and our profit went from two thousand dollars a month

[02:46] But now you have literally the extra hundred dollars a month

[02:49] It's pure profit so we six-packed the profit of the business with one change for those in the audience who are thinking

[02:55] But not as many people would buy so I told you that we increased how much profit the business made

[02:59] I'll tell you the one change that we did was we looked at the entire marketplace that were selling the similar service to theirs

[03:04] And it was based on our research

[03:06] We felt that the market could support a 50% higher price and so we literally and this is already a pretty expensive thing

[03:11] We literally did nothing but add 50% to the price and changed nothing about the product and guess what happened more people bought why?

[03:19] Because when something becomes more expensive people perceive its value in a higher way and because of the brand that the person had

[03:25] It was more aligned with the person to have a higher price deck now most times in most markets

[03:30] Supply and demand when the price goes up demand goes down in most markets now not all markets and more times than not

[03:36] It doesn't drop by the same proportion so if you double the price sometimes you sell a third fewer

[03:41] But if you double the price and you've six-exed the profit

[03:45] Attention on a customer if I six-exed my profit on a potential customer and I do it at two-thirds the price

[03:51] Then I triple the profit of the business stuff you still make way more money and so finding the absolute perfect point of

[03:57] Profit many times comes from raising the price and pricing is one of those very interesting things because it's very time to emotions

[04:03] A lot of people are very afraid of raising the price because they don't want to break it

[04:06] I want to talk you about how to raise the price if that is your goal

[04:09] Which is why the number one lever that you have on profits is pricing and constantly testing a lot of people

[04:13] Test split test their pages. They split test their scripts

[04:16] They split test their offers but the thing you can forget to test their price and it's the strongest lever of all three levers

[04:21] Okay, so let's walk through a hypothetical business and the steps that we would need to take in order to increase the price

[04:26] If that's what we decided was the right call. So the first thing we would do is we'd survey the existing audience using the Ben West or pricing survey

[04:31] We'll let's say this business sold the 12-week grow your calves program and let's say it was $1,200 for 12 weeks

[04:37] Very simple and on the first third of the survey

[04:39] We're trying to find out more about the gospel so we're like hey, you know

[04:41] What was the main reason that you bought this was there an event that was coming up that incentivized you to do it?

[04:46] What's your income level what's your job?

[04:47] What was the primary way that you found out about us? Right? So it's like okay these are the things that we know about the avatar and so we've got those

[04:53] Client demographics okay second part is the four questions to the Van West or what if it was super expensive?

[04:58] What if it were a way to cheap? What if it were a stretch and then what if it were a bargain?

[05:02] Right, there's the four questions now we say of all the things that we do in our calves program

[05:05] Which is the book the training the nutrition the stretching thing that we have the one-on-one calls for accountability

[05:10] The body system that we've put together. She have an accountability buddy like all of these things that we do in our value stack

[05:14] Which of these if we only had one of them you would keep and which of these if we got rid of one?

[05:18] You would lose and not care you take that data number one number two

[05:22] Now we communicate it internally first all right, so we got to communicate to the team that a community of sales team

[05:27] She created the marketing team then we communicate it to our customers. This is what's happening. This is why it's happening

[05:32] Past-person future. This is what we did to get here. This is why it's important now

[05:36] This is what we're trying to do later. We're investing the business because we want to fulfill our promises finally

[05:40] Now we bring it up to the new customers for coming in so we hit our list up to let them know so we have the urgency is up for and then the last step is now

[05:48] We officially have this new price now what we want to do now is expect effect the change in price will probably result in fewer sales by total volume

[05:55] And the reason for that is because we cleared the pipeline before the price change it happens once you have that

[06:00] You have to let it shake out you have to let it settle and it's really trying it's very difficult to do that because it takes guts

[06:06] But once you make that and you let it settle then you just do the math and let the math do the talking

[06:10] But if you sell it twice the price you make more money so in our hypothetical cap scenario

[06:15] Let's say we bumped into $2,000 or $3,000 or $3,000 because we found out that that was the price that was right that sweet spot

[06:20] That was the stretch but they still do it. We might have just two or three extra profit of the business by making that one change and

[06:26] Maybe because calves are the coolest thing ever got even more people to buy it because they thought they really could get the results that we said

[06:31] We were gonna help them experience if this was interesting you go to acquisition.com third video is on pricing

[06:36] You can watch more about pricing as it applies to your business. It's absolutely free you don't even adopt anything you just watch

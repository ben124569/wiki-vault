[00:00] What's going on? If you are not acquiring customers every single week, week in, week out,

[00:06] then this is for you. All right, so fundamentally, two ways you can, well, there's six ways

[00:13] you can search for clients, but two that I want to talk about today is going to be outbound

[00:16] in in-bond. All right, so outbound, being like you're actively reaching out to people and getting

[00:20] a certain small percentage to respond, and the other version of that is paid ads, which is fundamentally

[00:26] again, outbound, you're displaying stuff, it's just you're paying a platform to have the eyeball

[00:30] rather than doing the menu work to get the eyeball. But the result is more or less the same. A certain

[00:34] percentage, like 1% click from the ad, and then they go through the process. Whereas when you're doing

[00:39] outbound, you have 1% that might respond to your outbound response, and then it comes inbound.

[00:44] Right, so what I want to talk about here is the number one thing that I see people that mess this up

[00:49] is that they do insufficient volume. And so what I want to do is give you a rule of thumb that

[00:55] I'm coining the rule of 100. All right, and what it basically states, and I haven't heard this

[01:00] from anyone, so I'm claiming it as my own, all right, is that if you do 100 of something every day,

[01:07] you'll likely get better at it, and you'll likely be doing enough that you will be able to start

[01:11] seeing an outcome. So in theory, if you were like the biggest master of all time, you would need to do

[01:16] less volume to get the same outcome. If I was the best paid advertiser of all time,

[01:21] then I wouldn't need to do a ton of paid advertising to get a lot of sales.

[01:25] Right, right, to the same degree. If I was the best cold caller in existence,

[01:29] I would need to do far fewer calls in order to generate the outcome that I'm looking for,

[01:34] more sales, right, but here's the twist. How do you think you become the best paid advertiser of

[01:39] all time? How do you think you become the best cold outbound, cold messenger, cold email,

[01:44] or cold caller of all time? Volume. And so the volume bighets the skill, but the thing is is as you

[01:52] get better at something you like doing it more. And so this is actually a circle that continues to

[01:56] reinforce itself. And the thing is is that most people do not start with the first thing in high enough

[02:01] quantity. They do not do sufficient volume, which is why I'm introducing the rule of 100. And so

[02:08] basically it states that if you are not, like right now, if you're not acquiring customers,

[02:14] then you're not doing the rule of 100. It's very simple. If you're not spending $100 per day

[02:18] on advertising, or doing 100 reachouts per day, then how do you expect to grow? And I'm saying this,

[02:33] you can add zeros, you can remove zeros, whatever. But the idea is that at a base level, and this is

[02:38] per person, this is per human being, that you have this working. If you were not doing this,

[02:44] then you were not going to grow. And so most people do outbound, and they do it one time a week,

[02:50] or one time every two weeks when they feel motivated. They don't do it every day. To the same degree,

[02:55] they're doing paid ads. And they're like, well, I spent, you know, I spent $100. It's like,

[03:01] so what? You got to spend $100 every day. And then what's going to happen is you're going to

[03:06] suck in the beginning. And you hope you can break even. And then over time the skill will improve,

[03:12] and then you will get more back from your volume. But everyone wants to have a huge skill

[03:19] and do low volume to get their outcome. But the reality is that to generate the skill, you have to

[03:23] have the volume. And then in so doing, you do more volume times the skill and the skill gets better.

[03:28] And then the outcome continues to increase. And so right now, if you're not doing 100 out reaches a

[03:34] day in your business, where you're not spending $100 a day on ads, how are you going to get clients?

[03:40] Like, what's the plan? Like, how is this working? And so when the number one things is like,

[03:45] when someone's reaching out to me and they're like, man, I wish I could get more clients. I'm like,

[03:48] well, are you doing either of these? First question. And if they're not, then it's like, well, then

[03:55] don't pass go. Do one of these two. Pick one. It doesn't really matter. The thing is is that

[04:00] if it's just you running in your business, then this is going to be the cheapest thing to do,

[04:04] because it's just selling your time, right? In the beginning. And you'll be able to do this, and

[04:09] then you could teach another person. And then another person, and then another person, how to

[04:13] continue to do this, because you will then have the skill that you can drop into their brains,

[04:17] and so that they can replicate the same results. You will. And reality is, they're not going to

[04:22] replicate the same result. But probably do it half as well or a third as well. But if you can still

[04:26] get, you know, 30 to one, 10 to one returns on the reachouts efforts that you're doing,

[04:33] then you can stand to have a, you know, 50% as effective person, but have 10 people doing it.

[04:39] Right? At the end of the day, most people, especially when you're,

[04:42] the earlier parts of the business, the people you hire aren't going to be better than you are

[04:46] at these things. But 10 of them will be better than you are at those things. And that was one of

[04:52] the biggest jumps I had to take is that sometimes you have to take a short step back when you go

[04:56] from you not selling to somebody else selling, right? But you can quickly go from one person to three

[05:02] people to five people selling because you are no longer the bottom of the constraint. All right? And so

[05:07] just recognizing that and using the rule of 100 as a rule of thumb for any of the, any of the

[05:13] acquisition efforts that you were doing, a guarantee you will serve you in your life. And so

[05:18] it's like, if you have not spent $100 every day or if you have not done 100 reachouts every day,

[05:22] and you were struggling to get clients, then do that first and then keep doing it, not one day,

[05:29] do it every day for 90 days, right? Do it every day for 90 days and I guarantee you,

[05:34] you will have customers by the end of that process. So anyways, lots of love with those

[05:38] valuable for you. If you did enjoy this drop a like, drop a comment and I'll see you guys soon. Bye!

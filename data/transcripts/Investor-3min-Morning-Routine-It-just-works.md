[00:00] What's the millionaire morning routine?

[00:01] A lot of people ask these questions

[00:02] if you look on YouTube, Instagram, TikTok,

[00:04] so-and-so morning routine.

[00:05] The five things so-and-so does a moment he wakes up.

[00:07] They think that there's some magic pill

[00:09] or some super-five-step thing

[00:10] that's gonna somehow get them to do the work.

[00:13] At the very end of this video,

[00:14] I'll give you my morning routine.

[00:15] Everything that I do between when I wake up and when I work.

[00:19] We have to define what productivity even means.

[00:21] Productivity is getting more done per unit of time.

[00:23] People who move faster in life don't actually move faster.

[00:26] They get more done per unit of time.

[00:27] I either sky-reaching, I mean, he's like,

[00:28] dude, I got this coach, he got me doing like morning walks,

[00:31] red lights on, and I do a whole bunch,

[00:33] and I do my gratitude to your only,

[00:34] he's like, by the time I'm done my morning routine,

[00:35] it's like 11 a.m.

[00:36] And I was like, do you think you'd be more productive

[00:38] if you just prospect it for three hours a day?

[00:39] It's like, yeah, probably.

[00:41] And I was like, doesn't sound very productive then.

[00:42] What's interesting is that people approach the problem

[00:44] of the fact that they're not getting enough done per unit of time.

[00:47] And they think that I should add more things

[00:49] that are not getting things done

[00:50] to become more productive per unit of time.

[00:52] That doesn't make sense, right?

[00:53] Why do people not think that way?

[00:54] Because people don't define the terms that they use.

[00:56] But if you define a productivity as a demand

[00:58] of work you do per unit of time,

[01:00] probably would stop doing a lot of things that you're doing

[01:02] that aren't worth.

[01:03] When people give you their advice

[01:04] for how to become productive, think,

[01:06] is this adding things that are not work

[01:08] to my calendar, of the work that I am doing,

[01:11] how much leverage am I getting from that work?

[01:12] So I can multiply even further at the work that I do.

[01:15] You order your tasks in order of the leverage

[01:18] that they have.

[01:18] The definition of leverage is you get more output

[01:22] per unit of input.

[01:23] If I do a little bit and I get a lot,

[01:24] I have a lot of leverage.

[01:25] You simply have some things that you get more money

[01:27] per period of time and less money per period of time.

[01:30] That's it.

[01:30] What are the tasks that get us the most output?

[01:32] For example, I could make sales calls.

[01:35] That is going to be a one to one input of like,

[01:37] I do this effort and I get sales out of it.

[01:39] With that same level of effort,

[01:41] if I could go recruit a salesperson,

[01:42] which would take me a finite period of time.

[01:44] And then that person replaces that,

[01:45] my ongoing support for that person,

[01:47] it's gonna be two, three hours a week.

[01:49] So I gained back 20 hours a week of prospecting

[01:51] in exchange for two to three hours a week plus money.

[01:54] And so the act of entrepreneurship

[01:55] is simply consistently making these trades

[01:57] of what can I buy my time back with.

[01:59] Even at the point where you had an entire company

[02:01] leading to one person and that person sucks to you.

[02:03] If we were to try and think of like the perfect morning routine,

[02:05] we should think about the reverse of that,

[02:07] which is what's the worst morning routine.

[02:08] How can I create a morning routine

[02:10] that would make me the least effective?

[02:12] One, I'd make it long as you'm only possible.

[02:14] Number two, I'd have lots of steps and processes involved

[02:17] so that I could use up lots of mental energy

[02:19] before I could even start working.

[02:21] Number three is that I would become very,

[02:23] very reliant on that thing.

[02:24] If I don't get this one thing in,

[02:25] then it means I cannot work.

[02:26] You have to make your bed in order to become a millionaire.

[02:28] The problem with that is that we're separating

[02:31] fact from psychology.

[02:33] If I make making my bed mean that I'm going to do the things

[02:37] that I said I'm going to do, then it's super productive.

[02:40] But it's not the making the bed.

[02:42] That's the thing that's important.

[02:43] It's the fact that I'm committed to doing the things

[02:45] that I said I'm going to do.

[02:46] Heroes will get on this superstition around these things

[02:48] that they do, but not describe the meaning

[02:50] that they've described to the thing.

[02:52] Oh, I do this thing to establish discipline.

[02:54] Then it's not the thing.

[02:55] It's the discipline in which case you could replace the thing

[02:57] with any other thing or you could just tell yourself

[02:59] you're just a little bit of a little bit of a providence yourself.

[03:01] The easiest way to disprove something is to say,

[03:03] let me find it in a sense where this doesn't exist

[03:05] and I still have the outcome.

[03:06] That's how you disprove something in science.

[03:08] If there's a millionaire morning routine,

[03:10] then it would have to be the same thing that all millionaires do.

[03:13] You have to wake up early.

[03:14] You can tell you right now, plenty of millionaires

[03:15] you don't wake up early.

[03:16] You have to have seven streams of income.

[03:17] All I have to do is find one person who does have seven

[03:19] streams of income to show you that that's not true.

[03:21] Do you have to do real estate in order to come to the millionaire?

[03:23] No.

[03:24] You have to be in software.

[03:24] You have to be in web free.

[03:26] By the way, buddy, doing 70 million in here

[03:28] with janitorial services for big buildings.

[03:30] Boring as shit.

[03:31] The anti-routine concept came from the fact

[03:33] that I could ask by suddenly fucking people

[03:35] what my routine was.

[03:36] Because I thought there was some magic pill

[03:37] of how I got stuff done besides getting stuff done.

[03:40] That somehow is gonna make them confront the fact

[03:43] that they're not working

[03:44] because they don't wanna work.

[03:45] You don't need to create some magical morning routine

[03:47] where you sing a flute, magical dance outside

[03:49] and sing the rain and the journals and all you shit like.

[03:51] There's work to be done.

[03:52] And the question is, how quickly can I

[03:53] begin that work?

[03:54] That's it.

[03:55] The perfect routine would be you wake up

[03:57] and you'll immediately work

[03:58] because you've trained yourself to be able to do it.

[03:59] If you are one of these people who has a 90 minute

[04:02] morning routine before you start working,

[04:03] try waking up and walking straight over to begin work.

[04:07] Don't even check your phone.

[04:08] Most people spend most of their time doing shit

[04:11] that doesn't matter.

[04:12] And for the people we're gonna say,

[04:13] isn't the morning routine kind of like a warm up

[04:15] before a workout?

[04:16] Aren't you like to prepare yourself

[04:17] before you start working?

[04:18] How long do you really need to warm up your brain?

[04:20] Do you think that your ability to warm up your brain

[04:23] is trainable?

[04:23] Because if it's trainable, then your routine should shrink

[04:25] and your number of hours of work should increase.

[04:28] It is me who are like, I get more done

[04:29] if I have a morning routine.

[04:30] Cool.

[04:31] See if you can just compress the morning routine

[04:32] to take less time.

[04:33] Of the 10 things you do, remove one, see how you do,

[04:36] remove two, see how you do.

[04:37] The fundamental equation of productivity,

[04:40] how much you do multiply,

[04:41] how much leverage you have on the stuff you do.

[04:43] If we're defining those things

[04:45] as the equation for productivity,

[04:46] then the perfect morning routine should be one

[04:49] that maximizes the volume of work you do

[04:51] and the leverage that you create from the volume.

[04:52] And so for me, that looks like waking up,

[04:55] having a cup of coffee and getting to work.

[04:58] And then ordering my day in the order in which

[05:00] I have the highest leverage activities

[05:02] to the lowest leverage activity.

[05:03] And if you enjoy this stuff and you want to think about

[05:05] how can I get more leverage for the work I have?

[05:06] And you should watch this for a few five minute video,

[05:08] just a no more video on my channel,

[05:09] on leverage and assessing opportunities.

[00:00] I've been in business for 14 years.

[00:01] I have a portfolio of companies that last year did a $250 million

[00:04] in aggro revenue.

[00:05] And if I just started over from scratch today,

[00:07] this is the most important concept to learn.

[00:10] And so I want to be clear, this is not a tactic, it's on a funnel.

[00:13] It's actually a ratio.

[00:14] And once you understand it, you never really see business the same way again.

[00:18] And the way I like to think about this is that there's a lot of people out in the marketplace

[00:21] who talk about different methods.

[00:23] But what this is is about a better model.

[00:25] And the thing is, is that methods expire.

[00:27] Methods are like one trick ponies.

[00:28] It's like, you figure out a new DM hack.

[00:30] You figure out a new way to get your content to go viral with a new hashtag.

[00:35] Whatever.

[00:36] Those are methods.

[00:37] Those are tiny tactics.

[00:38] But those change all the time.

[00:38] The things that endure are the models, the economics of the business itself.

[00:44] And so that is the engine that fuels everything.

[00:47] And so everyone likes to talk about marketing, content, branding, et cetera.

[00:51] But none of it matters if you run out of money.

[00:54] And so let's think about the number one rule of business is don't go out of business.

[00:57] And so what's the thing that prevents you from running out of business?

[00:59] Cash flow.

[01:00] And so if you can manage your cash flow, then you can basically stay in business forever.

[01:04] You can continue to play the game.

[01:06] In Silicon Valley, they're able to do this by artificially inflating the cash they have in

[01:10] the business, by raising money from the outside.

[01:13] Now the vast majority of businesses is 99% of business owners don't have outside investors

[01:17] beyond themselves.

[01:18] Most businesses are bootstrapped.

[01:19] And so if your cash is the only thing the business relies on, you better well make sure

[01:24] that you build a business, that makes cash flow.

[01:26] So that you can stay in business.

[01:29] And so what I'm going to walk you through is basically the concept that unlocked my business

[01:33] career.

[01:34] So to illustrate the concept, I'm going to kind of tell you the tale of two businesses.

[01:38] And this tale is actually what I built my wealth off of this idea.

[01:43] So like, it made me a multi-decome millionaire.

[01:46] So maybe worth paying attention to.

[01:48] So when I entered the gym industry, they were running things what they called LBOs, which

[01:52] is funny, because in the M&A world LBOs, a leverage buyout.

[01:55] But in the gym on a road, it was a low barrier offer.

[01:58] That's what it meant.

[01:59] Sometimes now people call it a low ticket offer.

[02:01] But they would run these $21-21-day programs.

[02:05] And this was kind of like industry standard.

[02:07] That's what everyone ran.

[02:08] So you get $21 bucks for 20 days.

[02:09] And then afterwards you try and convert them from $21 into $99 per month membership.

[02:16] And this would take $21.

[02:17] OK.

[02:18] What we came in to start doing is we ran six-week challenges.

[02:22] And with our six-week challenges, we would get $600 upfront day one.

[02:29] And then we would sell another $200 of supplements within the next 48 hours.

[02:35] And then at week three, we would get them to prepay for the year.

[02:39] And so we would get another $2,000.

[02:42] Now of course not every single person took everyone of these upsels, but blended, we'd

[02:46] be looking somewhere in the neighborhood at $1,000 with then basically the first 30 days.

[02:53] Now look at the difference in economics between $21 in the first 30 days and $1,000.

[02:59] So if these two people or these two businesses are competing in the same marketplace,

[03:03] which is an auction of attention, quite literally when you're running ads, who do you think

[03:07] can outspend home?

[03:08] This guy, by a mile.

[03:10] And so when we entered the space, our gyms that ran our model, not method, our model,

[03:16] didn't matter what advertising platform we were advertising on, could outspend the competition,

[03:21] or not, but it's not.

[03:22] So fundamentally, the business that can make more money from its customer than its competitors,

[03:27] wins.

[03:28] And so because you make more money than your competitors off your customers, then it means you

[03:31] can spend more to acquire them.

[03:33] And if you can spend more, then it means you have a veritable monopoly over the attention.

[03:38] Because think about every one of these eyeballs has a little auction that's going on in

[03:41] real time every day.

[03:42] If I can outspend everybody in my market and I can actually have the ability to deliver on

[03:48] all of these customers, guess what I can do.

[03:50] I can buy up 100% of the advertising space and have a legal monopoly over that market.

[03:56] Because I can just outspend everybody.

[03:58] Now, it's not like I've some network of factor on pricing people out, and it's nothing

[04:00] to do with that.

[04:01] If anything, I make more money from customers, so I can charge, I can pay more to get them.

[04:05] I'm not undercutting them and doing competitive practices.

[04:08] It's the opposite.

[04:09] I'm competing by having a better model.

[04:12] And so these guys would lose money, because for them, it would still cost them about

[04:16] $100 to get a customer.

[04:18] So you're like, wait a second.

[04:19] Why would they pay $100 make 21?

[04:20] This actually happens all the time in business.

[04:22] And then they'd get one out of three of these people to buy the $99 thing.

[04:26] And so it's really closer to $300 for them to get a $99 membership, which on average

[04:31] would stay six months.

[04:33] Not a very good business, but this is what the industry standard was.

[04:36] But for us, we're making 1,000 plus, and for us, if we had $300 and it cost us less,

[04:42] because our offer was actually better, we were able to acquire and then continue to profit

[04:45] this whole period of time.

[04:47] So if you have these two businesses, if you're in business 1, do you have a marketing

[04:50] budget?

[04:51] Of course you do, because you have to limit how much you're burning to get customers, because

[04:55] you're losing money getting them.

[04:56] So you have to say, okay, we're willing to spend $4,000, and we're going to get 40 people

[05:02] to buy our 21 dollar thing.

[05:03] That's what we're willing to spend.

[05:04] And we're going to wait until we get these people to add into our recurring revenue.

[05:08] And then we might build a spend $5,000.

[05:09] Next month, but we have to budget it.

[05:11] Now in scenario two here, what is our marketing budget for this business?

[05:16] Well, if it cost you a hundred bucks to make a thousand, what's your budget?

[05:22] You spend as many dollars as you possibly can and keep those numbers.

[05:26] That's how you do it.

[05:27] And so this is what allowed me to bankroll the opening of each of my gym facilities when

[05:32] I had them beyond the first one, and to open all of them at full capacity on the first day,

[05:37] which is not common.

[05:39] And so basically, this is what it would look like.

[05:42] I would put $5,000 into a bank account, and I would sign a lease.

[05:46] And then I would start running ads for $100 a day.

[05:50] From those $100 a day of ads, I would get 10 leads.

[05:54] From those 10 leads, I knew that I was going to close two of those leads.

[06:00] From those two leads, I knew that I was going to get, let's call it $600 each.

[06:08] So I was getting $1200 a medially from the $100 that I spent earlier that day.

[06:14] Now what's going to happen to my bank account?

[06:16] Well, I was at $4900, but now I have $1200 more.

[06:20] So now my $4900 becomes $6100 and I repeat the cycle again tomorrow.

[06:28] Now if I did this every day, then I would make an extra call $30,000 in profit month

[06:33] one.

[06:34] But I was a sneaky guy.

[06:37] And so instead of spending $100, I would spend $500 every day.

[06:42] And then with that money, there was some inefficiencies that happened sometimes.

[06:45] Lee cost one up, et cetera.

[06:47] But I would usually be able to generate upwards of $100,000 in sales within that period

[06:53] of time from one gym.

[06:55] And so with that $100,000, guess what it cost to open a gym?

[06:58] A little bit less than $100,000.

[07:00] And so I was able to finance the opening of each of my gyms.

[07:04] By putting $5,000 into the bank account, running through this black box and then getting $100,000

[07:09] on the other side in that first month.

[07:11] And so that then allowed me to buy the equipment.

[07:14] It bit the flooring.

[07:15] I bought the sign.

[07:16] I did the painting.

[07:17] I put the lobby in place.

[07:18] I got my weights.

[07:19] I got everything I needed, the sound system.

[07:21] Right?

[07:22] Merch.

[07:23] All that stuff set up.

[07:24] So at the end of the 30 days of the pre-sale, I could then kick the gym off completely

[07:27] outfitted, completely paid full by the customers that now started.

[07:31] And then six weeks after that, we would roll those cum sumers into a recurring membership.

[07:36] And then at that point, six weeks later, the business was cash flow positive.

[07:40] And this is how when I was in my very early 20s, I was able to up and up six locations

[07:45] off of the cash flow that the business was able to generate.

[07:48] And in such a short period of time.

[07:50] And so the thing is, is that every single business can build a box like this with

[07:54] skill.

[07:55] So coming back to the number one most important business concept, this is what you need

[07:58] to know.

[07:59] Number one is what?

[08:03] What's a customer worth to you?

[08:14] Over 30 days.

[08:17] Now, the reason I limited to 30 days is because that's typically as long as most small

[08:21] businesses can handle from a cash flow perspective.

[08:23] As in like you're willing to pay money weight 30 days to get it back.

[08:26] It's also because that's the interest free time period where people will give you money

[08:29] for no interest.

[08:30] Credit cards are interest free for the first 30 days.

[08:32] And so you basically are limited by your ability to get credit if you actually had no

[08:35] money.

[08:36] But if you do have some money, then still you want to recover it back within the first 30

[08:39] days.

[08:40] That's a rule of thumb.

[08:41] Now, the second thing is, okay, we know what a customer is worth to us.

[08:44] We know what, the gross profit, how much we're going to make from them after we pay the cost

[08:47] of delivering whatever it is that we sell.

[08:49] The next is, what's a customer cost me?

[08:56] Now, when I'll be clear here is I'm not talking about cost me to deliver.

[08:59] I'm saying what is it cost me to get them?

[09:02] So what do I have to spend in marketing and advertising and content and sales commissions

[09:07] to get a customer in the door?

[09:08] And you have to know these two numbers.

[09:10] Number one, and number two.

[09:13] And ideally, number one is greater than number two.

[09:17] Like we want to make sure we're making more money from customers than it costs us to make

[09:20] it.

[09:21] And the thing is, if you don't understand your business math, you'll continue to blame

[09:25] other things.

[09:26] You'll continue to blame your methods.

[09:28] Oh, Facebook doesn't work for me.

[09:30] Oh, I've been doesn't work for me.

[09:31] Oh, content doesn't work for me.

[09:32] Well, imagine you're in the scenario, right?

[09:35] Is it actually an issue with Facebook ads?

[09:38] Is it the ads that aren't working?

[09:40] Is it the method that's not working?

[09:41] Or is it the model?

[09:43] You have a model issue.

[09:45] And if you could make hypothetically a billion dollars from a customer, you could spend

[09:49] 12 cents to reach every single person on earth.

[09:52] And just try to get one customer.

[09:54] That would be a business that could have probably spent a lot of money.

[09:56] We're a quick, I've a gift for you.

[09:57] This is the $100 million scaling roadmap.

[10:00] It's something that might teamen up at 200 plus hours into building and breaking the stages

[10:04] of scaling into 10 steps.

[10:05] All right.

[10:06] And so what we did is we broke down everything that got us basically got us stuck and what

[10:10] we did to break free at each level of the business.

[10:13] If you'd like to know what product marketing sales customer service, IT recruiting

[10:16] human resources and finance look like it.

[10:19] The stage that you're currently at.

[10:21] This is a free gift.

[10:22] So all you have to do is go to AquasNaccompan, Force, I Shroom App.

[10:24] You can plug in your business information.

[10:26] And if you want our help, you want my help to help you break through whatever level of scaling

[10:30] you're at.

[10:31] This is not a promise.

[10:32] I'm just saying it's love to help.

[10:32] On the thank you page, you can book and call every month we have a workshop out here

[10:36] at my headquarters.

[10:37] You actually talked to my real team that does our marketing, does our emails, does our ads,

[10:41] does our copy, does our sales, does our finance, does our recruiting, the real people are

[10:46] doing it at a very high level.

[10:48] And what's really cool about that is that they can typically find and spot what the constraints

[10:51] are in a business like that.

[10:53] And so it's one of the most valuable things that I could possibly do.

[10:55] Obviously, you know, spaces limited based on actual headquarters.

[10:58] But if that's interesting on the thank you page, you can book, go all, no pressure.

[11:00] This is a gift either way.

[11:01] It's absolutely free.

[11:02] Now, I've been, I've been hiding the real words for this.

[11:07] But thankfully, business actually has a term for this, which is the lifetime gross profit,

[11:18] which is LTGP.

[11:20] Sometimes people refer to this as LTV or CLV customer lifetime value, lifetime value.

[11:26] All of these more or less mean the same thing.

[11:28] What's the amount of money you make after you spend whatever you got to spend in delivering

[11:33] for the customer?

[11:34] What's the extra cash on top?

[11:36] If you pay 100 bucks, it cost you 20 to deliver a sandwich, 80 bucks is your gross profit.

[11:40] They do that 10 times, $800 is the lifetime gross profit.

[11:44] All right.

[11:45] Now, what's the customer cost me?

[11:47] This is CAC.

[11:48] This is cost of acquiring customer.

[11:49] That's what that stands for.

[11:50] All right.

[11:51] So, this is our ratio of LTV to CAC.

[11:53] Here we go.

[11:55] Now, if you can do this math for yourself and I'll give you the back and now I can

[11:59] weigh of looking at this because you're probably like, I don't track this stuff and that's

[12:01] okay.

[12:02] Look at what you spend in marketing for all of last year.

[12:05] Okay.

[12:05] So, do a whole year.

[12:06] Very simple.

[12:07] You can just look at the line item.

[12:08] Would you spend an advertising?

[12:09] Would you spend in labor that's associated with it?

[12:11] So, you might have a video, a career, a contractor.

[12:13] You might spend some money on ads, you might spend some money in commissions.

[12:17] Everything that it takes to cost to get a customer.

[12:18] Okay.

[12:19] All of those cost you out of together and then you look at how many new customers did I get

[12:22] last year.

[12:23] Maybe you got 100 customers and let's say it cost you $100,000.

[12:25] Okay.

[12:26] So, that means it cost you $1,000 per customer.

[12:29] Okay.

[12:30] This should make sense.

[12:31] That gives you how much your cack is and the nice thing is that cacks the easiest one

[12:36] to calculate.

[12:37] You just literally look at your cost divided by customers.

[12:38] That's it.

[12:39] I'll give you the back of napkin simplest way to do it, which is revenue divided by a number

[12:47] of total customer.

[12:56] Now I want to be clear.

[12:59] This is going to give us our lifetime revenue.

[13:02] We still have to look at our gross profit here.

[13:04] So we would just multiply that number by gross profits.

[13:07] And if you're not sure what your gross profits are, if it costs you $20 to make a sandwich

[13:11] and you charge 100 bucks, then your gross profit is 80, meaning 80%.

[13:16] All right.

[13:17] So, you'd multiply that number by 80%.

[13:19] And that's what your lifetime gross profit is going to be.

[13:21] So I'll also give you the simplest way to do gross profit.

[13:24] So I'm giving you the back in napkin quick and dirty ways.

[13:26] But you know what's interesting that I found is that the back of napkin way when

[13:29] you do it over an extended period of time tends to be the most accurate because it takes.

[13:32] You don't have these good months and bad months.

[13:34] It actually gives you a more accurate picture of your business.

[13:36] All right.

[13:37] So the way you do it is you look at total costs of goods, which some people call

[13:48] Cogs, right, or cost of delivery if you have a service.

[13:51] So it's like if you have a bunch of reps and you have some software that you use to deliver,

[13:55] where you've got some contractors that you deliver some stuff.

[13:57] And ever cost you to deliver for all customers for the whole year divided by number of

[14:03] customers.

[14:06] That's it.

[14:07] So that'll give you what your cost per customer is.

[14:13] And so if we then take our lifetime revenue, subtract our cost per customer, then we'll

[14:22] get our lifetime value, all right, which is the gross profit per customer.

[14:25] And that's like a very real way of doing that.

[14:27] So we have two variable simple divisions with some simple subtraction.

[14:33] All right.

[14:34] So this is not intimidating math.

[14:35] And if this intimidates you, I would encourage you to get over it.

[14:39] Because this is not even, this is third grade math.

[14:42] I don't know when they teach multiplication of vision, but I think it's around third grade.

[14:45] All right.

[14:46] It's not a lot.

[14:47] You can do this.

[14:48] Literally all you have to do is just add up, just add up the line item at the end of your

[14:51] bookkeeping because your bookkeeper probably does this.

[14:54] Just look at your advertising total, look at your sales commission total, look at the

[14:57] your payroll total for everything else that's not marketing and sales related.

[15:02] And then you add all that stuff up together and you look at how many customers you have

[15:05] in total that are active and then you divide it.

[15:08] And so the end result here is that you're going to have an LTV number or lifetime gross

[15:11] profit number, whatever it is.

[15:13] And you're going to have a count number on average for the last year.

[15:17] Now ideally you want the ratio between these numbers to be as big as possible.

[15:22] Now I'm going to give you three kind of considerations for this.

[15:29] Many of the people in the software world, the very smart Silicon Valley people talk about

[15:33] a rule of thumb of three to one, which is you want to make sure they're making at least

[15:37] three dollars in gross profit for customer for every dollar cost to get them.

[15:41] Okay.

[15:42] Now having done business for a while now, that is only true under the conditions where you

[15:47] have all three elements of business that are automated.

[15:49] And you're like, what are the components of business?

[15:52] Basically, lead generation has to be automated.

[15:57] Conversion has to be automated so sales how you're going to get people to give you money.

[16:02] And then you have delivery or fulfillment.

[16:06] These are the three components that have to be automated.

[16:09] If all three are automated, yes three to one works.

[16:12] Now if two of the three are automated, right?

[16:15] So let's say this one isn't automated, this one isn't this one is.

[16:18] Then I think you changed that to about six to one.

[16:21] Now if two of them are not automated and only one of them is, I think you changed that

[16:25] to nine to one.

[16:26] That's that minimum.

[16:28] And then finally, if all three are not automated, meaning if people at every one of

[16:31] these steps in the process, you need to be at over 12 to one.

[16:35] Now you might be like, wow, that's a lot different than what I have.

[16:38] Right.

[16:39] And that's why we need to improve it, which is what I'm going to talk about next.

[16:41] Now you might hear this and then wonder like, what degree is this, like the checks

[16:45] and the Xs?

[16:46] What does that even mean?

[16:47] Okay.

[16:48] Legion, something that's high leverage would be like making content.

[16:52] That's one to many.

[16:53] Running ads, one to many.

[16:55] Those are things that would qualify to me as being high leverage.

[16:58] It's not one person.

[16:59] You don't have manually, but that's really installed there in order, you're not limited

[17:02] by human.

[17:03] Now, if you're doing manual outreach in order to get customers, you would be limited there.

[17:08] Right?

[17:09] If you have viral coefficient, it's all word of mouth that's compounding.

[17:12] That has high leverage.

[17:13] Right?

[17:14] So if you were doing outreach as your primary way of getting customers, what they're

[17:16] not having wrong with doing that to be clear.

[17:18] But if you do a manual process, then you're going to have an X here.

[17:22] So it's going to mean you're going to have to increase your altitude of cat ratio.

[17:24] Now, if you're like, why do I have to do this?

[17:27] The reason this ratio has to increase is because there's a number of costs that the

[17:30] business incur as you scale.

[17:32] So number one is the cost of getting new customers is actually going to go up as you go

[17:37] to colder and colder markets.

[17:39] Costs are going to cost more, believe it or not, always goes up over time.

[17:41] So you might, whatever you have today, believe it or not, is likely going to be the best

[17:45] cost of car cost we're going to get.

[17:46] All right, because CPM's go up over time, this is a fact of life.

[17:49] More competitors into the marketplace.

[17:50] This is a factor of life.

[17:52] And even if neither of those things are true and you just want to colder and colder markets,

[17:56] as in you scale up your advertising, you're going to reach people that the algorithm

[17:59] thinks are slightly less likely than the first people that they displayed your ads to,

[18:02] which means it's going to cost more because it's going to have to show it to more

[18:05] eyeballs to get the same number of conversions.

[18:07] So it's going to cost you more per customer.

[18:09] You're going up the interest graph.

[18:11] You're going up the kind of the normal curve of people who are less and less interested

[18:14] as you go colder and colder and colder and spend more and more.

[18:16] That's number one.

[18:17] The second reason that this is important is that you're going to put in layers of infrastructure

[18:21] in your business.

[18:22] You're going to have levels of management and these things, although they suck, still add

[18:25] cost to the business as it scales.

[18:27] And so you're going to need some padding in terms of your lifetime risk profit to be

[18:30] able to afford this level of scaling.

[18:32] And typically customers that come in later are less sold on the idea and sometimes are

[18:38] worth less.

[18:39] So they actually end up spending less money over time.

[18:41] And so all of these reasons kind of compound together.

[18:43] And the last one, which is so important when it comes to this X mark, is that when you have

[18:47] people in every one of these processes, whenever you hit a point of kind of saturation

[18:52] you've hit the capacity of let's say your sales team.

[18:54] Let's see, you've got five guys that are proficient, they do well.

[18:56] Well, at some point you're going to have to scale your sales.

[18:58] And so you're going to bring a six person in or a seventh person in it.

[19:01] But that new sales guy is not going to be as good as the first five.

[19:04] It's going to take time for them to get good for them to get on-rimmed.

[19:07] Same thing when it comes to marketing.

[19:08] You're going to have to have a new market is going to come to you.

[19:09] It's not going to be as good at making quantities.

[19:10] You're going to have to get reps.

[19:11] Same thing on delivery.

[19:12] You're going to have to have some star account reps on the back end that do some level

[19:15] of service delivery and you're going to bring somebody else up to speed.

[19:18] But the thing is the business has to incur that cost immediately day one and doesn't always

[19:22] get the return on that for a few months.

[19:24] And so if you're at three to one and then you have these all of a sudden, imagine this.

[19:28] You're at three to one.

[19:29] But then you have to bring in a new marketer.

[19:31] You have to bring a new salespeople and you have to bring a new account reps.

[19:33] Well, all of your metrics are going to suffer, which means all of a sudden you're going

[19:35] to go from barely being profitable to probably not being profitable at all.

[19:40] And so we have to have these increases for each level of manual that enters the business

[19:44] in terms of manual labor.

[19:46] So that we have padding and cushion for cash flow in order to scale.

[19:51] Because the number one rule of business is you have to stay in business as long as you

[19:54] got money.

[19:55] That's the rule.

[19:56] And so we have to make sure our economics of the business support, the fact that we're

[19:58] going to have inefficiency as we scale and it's going to be lumpy.

[20:02] We have to bring in a whole bunch of new salesguys or conversions you're going to take.

[20:05] But we have to have the business economics of the model to support that.

[20:08] Because if the only way your business works is that you're selling, you're never going

[20:10] to scale.

[20:11] You have to fix the model.

[20:13] I could make 20 books and movies on what you do to increase this ratio.

[20:19] How do you improve it?

[20:20] So off the top of my head, some things that you can do to immediately make more money.

[20:26] Number one is you can raise the price.

[20:28] Number two is that you can decrease costs.

[20:30] Number three is that you can have upsells.

[20:32] Number four is that you can add downsells, which means that a higher percentage of customers

[20:35] who otherwise wouldn't have bought now do.

[20:36] So you actually make more money perer because you actually sell more people.

[20:40] If you start selling expensive people, who would have bought an expensive thing, a cheap

[20:43] thing, you make less money.

[20:44] So you got to be very careful with downsells.

[20:47] You can add in financing.

[20:48] This is something that pulls cash for it.

[20:50] Again, this is from a cash flow perspective.

[20:52] You can change the terms of how you collect payment.

[20:55] You can say, you know what?

[20:57] You can have a payment plan, you can pay as long as you want.

[20:59] But we don't start working until you pay off everything.

[21:01] There are different ways that we construction these things that we can frontload the cash

[21:04] in the business.

[21:05] You can also have cross-sells, which means that you sell them something different rather

[21:10] than higher quality or more of something.

[21:13] You actually sell something different.

[21:14] You sell a burger with fries rather than a bigger burger or a better burger.

[21:19] As I'm going through these things, you should absolutely know how to be able to apply this

[21:23] to any business.

[21:25] So if I have, let's say we'll take this book.

[21:29] So if I wanted to run through this, I could raise the price of my book.

[21:32] I could buy in larger time as a scale to decrease the cost of the book or I could figure

[21:36] out what I could do from a shipping perspective to negotiate better rates on my shipping.

[21:40] I could have maybe AI support so that I don't have to have as many people to manage kind

[21:44] of shipping issues.

[21:45] I could upsell a nice servership of the book.

[21:48] So instead of being a digital book, I could upsell a hard version of this book or I could

[21:52] give you audio and a hard copy and e-book version of this book.

[21:57] If I wanted to cross-sell, I would sell a second book that was different than the original

[22:01] book.

[22:02] I needed financing, which for the, you hope that people don't need financing for a book,

[22:06] but I could introduce financing so that people could pay for this book upfront.

[22:10] And so all of these different, and if I have the downsell here is the reverse of the

[22:13] upsell.

[22:14] People can't afford my hardback.

[22:15] Then I say, why don't you have one of my digital copies, which is cheaper.

[22:17] All right, so every business you should be able to on the top of your head think of ways

[22:21] to apply.

[22:22] I'm going to do this again because I think it's worth doing.

[22:24] All right, what is this?

[22:25] This is a table.

[22:26] All right.

[22:27] So I could increase the price of my table.

[22:28] I could decrease the cost of manufacturing this table.

[22:31] I could upsell a higher quality table so I can say, hey, let's make this marble, right?

[22:35] Or I can downsell a wood or plastic version.

[22:38] I can cross-sell chairs or table covers that go with this thing.

[22:43] I can add a warranty on top of this that I can upsell or cross-sell.

[22:46] Excuse me.

[22:47] I can add financing where I can change the terms of collection.

[22:49] All of these things are things that can drive up the lifetime value.

[22:53] And if you can't go through that exercise with your business, you don't understand

[22:56] your business well enough.

[22:57] You can absolutely do this with any business.

[22:59] It's actually hard with physical products than it is with services.

[23:02] Now of course, what every business owner wants is they want cheaper customers because no

[23:05] and everyone should admit that their business isn't that good.

[23:07] And the reality is most business owners want more leads and it's usually the last thing

[23:11] they really need.

[23:12] They really need a better model so they can afford more expensive leads.

[23:16] And that gives you a competitive advantage.

[23:18] You wanting cheaper leads means that you're competing on methods.

[23:21] And that means that somebody else can copy your methods.

[23:23] And if they have a better model, they'll still outspend you.

[23:25] And so the model is the competitive mode.

[23:27] A method is a one trick.

[23:29] And that will expire.

[23:30] So you want to always double down on the model.

[23:32] And obviously you want to know what's up to date right now.

[23:35] Hey, if you can get customers for cheaper, let's do it.

[23:37] But the long-term thing is you want to make sure you have a better model.

[23:40] Now, how do you decrease the cost of getting customers?

[23:43] So you can improve your offer.

[23:46] How do we make the thing that we have more compelling?

[23:48] We can improve our ad creatives.

[23:50] So this is better ads.

[23:52] So think about this in terms of volume and quality.

[23:55] How do I set it up?

[23:56] More ads?

[23:57] How do I better hooks?

[23:58] How do I remake my winners?

[23:59] We can also increase CRRU.

[24:00] So it's conversion optimization in terms of our pages.

[24:03] So we split testing or pages.

[24:04] We split testing or follow up.

[24:06] We're split testing.

[24:07] Descripting that we're using on the phone.

[24:08] Are we training our team if we use phone sales?

[24:11] All of these things decrease your cac.

[24:14] On top of this, we can go to, I'll just say, cheaper CPMs, which is you're going to

[24:19] advertise in places that cost you less per eyeball.

[24:22] Now, again, lowering cac is not necessarily the answer.

[24:26] You can lower cac, but that assumes that you're, again, cac not cost per lead, because

[24:31] you can get very cheap, please, very easily.

[24:32] But you might not get good leads.

[24:33] You might not get customers if you do that.

[24:36] And so we really just want to maximize for our return between these two numbers.

[24:40] So I'll give you a hypothetical example.

[24:42] Let's say, in scenario one, I'm going to give you a fresh picture.

[24:46] So let's say scenario one, LTV is $5,000.

[24:52] And cac is $500.

[24:58] And let's say scenario two, LTV is $1,000.

[25:06] And cac is $200.

[25:11] Which business would you rather have?

[25:14] Well, if you just said, hey, I want cheaper customers, then you'd say this, but does that

[25:18] make sense?

[25:19] No, because you're getting $5 to 1.

[25:21] Wouldn't you rather put $500 in and get $5,000 back because scenario getting $10 to 1?

[25:26] And so obviously this business number one is the better business to own, even though it

[25:32] cost you more than twice as much to get a customer.

[25:35] And so we want to optimize for our returns, not for one specific number of, I want the

[25:39] cheapest leads are I want the cheapest customers.

[25:40] What are the customers that are worth the most relative to what you pay?

[25:44] This concept, if you actually can internalize this and actually choose to make decisions

[25:48] about your business like this, because I'm telling you right now, most business owners

[25:52] optimize for this.

[25:53] They say, oh, we're getting this is getting us cheaper customers.

[25:56] Let's advertise broader.

[25:58] Let's make sure that we open up the top of the funnel.

[26:00] Well, guess what?

[26:01] You're going to get way more and you're going to get way more trash.

[26:02] And then all of a sudden, you're like, man, all these customers suck.

[26:05] Well, that's because you're not, you're not willing to spend more to get a better quality

[26:09] customer.

[26:10] This is the higher the customer is typically the more expanded this else you get a

[26:13] category issue of gets.

[26:15] So wouldn't you be willing to spend a million dollars to get a customer that pays you

[26:18] 20 million?

[26:19] Yes, and sometimes that's what it is.

[26:22] It costs a ton of money, but then you make so much more.

[26:25] But you've got to be willing to pay to play.

[26:27] So this is how real business works.

[26:30] Everything in business changes when to understand this.

[26:33] All you have to do to stay in business is you have to have cash.

[26:36] And in order to have cash, you need to increase what you make versus what you spend to make

[26:40] it and managing that ratio and the payback period of when you get that money back is going

[26:45] to be the lever on how quickly you can grow and reinvest the money back into your money

[26:49] making machine.

[26:50] So if you can spend more to get customers, then your competitors can.

[26:54] You win.

[26:55] And this is what I wish someone had told me or got me to explain your one.

[26:59] And so hopefully, now you know.

[00:00] The reason you're busy but still broke isn't because you're not working hard enough.

[00:03] It's because you're working on too many things. In other words, you're busy but in the wrong ways.

[00:08] Back when I was running my first company, I was working all the hours that I was awake.

[00:11] But I couldn't get past $3 million a year and it wasn't until I learned how to apply my effort

[00:17] deliberately that everything changed. In this video I'll show you why you feel so busy,

[00:22] why this is keeping you broke and most of all had to allocate your effort into the best

[00:26] opportunity vehicles so you can turn your busyness into business. Number one, why you feel so busy.

[00:32] So I'll give you a biological example and a social example. So a biological example, let's say

[00:37] that you've got a magnifying glass and you want to burn a hole through a piece of paper.

[00:41] Right? You've got this piece of paper here and you want to burn a hole through it.

[00:44] If you don't get the magnifying glass at the right distance, you're just going to have a

[00:49] circle like this but it's just not, it's not concentrated enough in order to burn through.

[00:54] You have to get that sweet spot so that you can get that tiny little hole and then all of a sudden

[00:59] it breaks through but that's only when you can concentrate the light to the same degree.

[01:04] Let's say that you want to start a party on a Friday night. But instead of starting one party,

[01:08] you say, hey, I want to have four parties on a Friday night. Now, if that were what you were going to do,

[01:14] you might be like, man, none of my parties worked out but it would be obvious to you now when you

[01:19] thought like, why didn't my parties work out is because you never got enough critical mass

[01:23] because if you combined all of the people and all of the people you were going to invite at one

[01:26] party, that party would then take off and then become a party in a bit self. And so this idea is

[01:33] basically what you're spending all your time on. You only have a certain number of people in your

[01:36] network, only a certain number of people that you can potentially contact to leverage the due deals,

[01:40] to get your help from, to help work for you, all of those things. But you're trying to start

[01:45] four parties at once and wondering what one of them's working. And so the reason this happens is

[01:50] because entrepreneurs get reinforced the first time they quit something and changed stuff up. And because

[01:56] you got into the game of business by quitting something in order to be here and something worked.

[02:01] That's why you still keep doing it. But the problem is you got reinforced for starting two

[02:05] parties. Your first party was maybe your job. The second one was like, you know what? I'm going to

[02:09] stop this party and I'm going to start my own. And then I'll have a sudden you're like, man, that was

[02:12] also I'm going to start more parties rather than realizing that just going from one of the

[02:17] other, this became a better vehicle and starting parties on your own was the better vehicle rather

[02:21] than starting parties in general. What does this all mean? Right? There's this really fancy term

[02:25] that people throw around in business and they say strategy a lot. And I always like to ask,

[02:29] what do you mean by strategy? And then they just make up a bunch of words because they have no

[02:32] idea to just sound like that. Strategy is this. It's the prioritization of limited resources

[02:38] against unlimited options. It's how you choose what you're going to do and what you're not going to do.

[02:42] That's a strategy is. And so right now, if I say, hey, what's your list of priorities? If you say,

[02:48] okay, number one is, you know, I've got party one, party two, party three, party four. I can already tell

[02:54] you that you don't have priorities because you have more than one. And so when we get back to like,

[02:59] what is a priority? So a priority like if you actually break the word down and comes from priority,

[03:03] which means that you can only have one first. That's how priority works. Now in the 20th century,

[03:09] people started saying priorities, which then basically neutered the term altogether. But if you go to

[03:14] the root of what it was supposed to mean, it means this comes first. This is the most important.

[03:19] Right now, you are struggling to focus your resources on one party, focus all of the people,

[03:25] you know, focus all of your promotional effort to get everyone to do one thing because you're trying

[03:29] to promote four because you're trying to have four parties, four priorities, priorities, and because

[03:35] of that, you have none that actually work. I'll tell you a funny example of this. So I had a

[03:39] really lovely lady, Kira, I came to my, to one of our, our, our events here at the, at headquarters,

[03:45] single mom of five, had a publishing business, she had a TV show, she had an events business,

[03:50] and she had like a business coaching business for women. And she was doing pretty well, you know,

[03:55] I mean, a few million bucks a year. When I see an entrepreneur like that, I just think, man,

[04:00] you have, you know, three or four media, properties, what if you actually had all those people

[04:04] party together? It'd be so much bigger because then that, that, that word of mouth effect would

[04:09] snowball far bigger than what you had before. And that's why sometimes it feels so hard because it's

[04:13] like when you're starting tiny parties, it's all many of effort. It's all brute force to get those

[04:18] first people there. But then after that, at a certain point, the word of mouth start starts growing,

[04:22] and it starts to become a thing. You start to develop a brand, you start to develop a reputation.

[04:27] But when you start four parties at once, it never gets there. How do I do that? The micro,

[04:32] people are like, okay, I need to be more productive. But let me give you the biggest productivity

[04:36] hack in the world. Do nothing besides the task that you said to accomplish. That's it.

[04:41] Anything that is not that sentence is not making you more productive. If it's not you doing the

[04:47] task, then you're not doing the task. People have come up with productivity as creative ways to

[04:52] procrastinate while not feeling guilty about not doing the work they know they should be doing.

[04:56] Focus means doing nothing besides that. They're focusing on.

[05:01] Commitment is the elimination of alternatives. Deciding is decadera it means to cut off.

[05:06] And so if you're thinking about all these words, you're like, man, they almost all mean the same thing.

[05:09] Yes. So just because there's lots of words, doesn't mean that the meaning is fundamentally different.

[05:12] It's just way of different cultures that meld into our word, lexicon. But a lot of people will

[05:18] try to make each of these sound nuance. It's the same thing. You need to cut off what you're not going

[05:22] to do. And then what remains becomes your priority. And so the most important decision is what is

[05:29] that thing that remains? Because the people who move fastest in life don't actually move faster.

[05:34] They get more for every move. They have higher leverage. I want you to go through this process with

[05:39] me. Right now you have your priorities. I'm going to put this in a little quotes here.

[05:43] All right. And let's say it's like, you know, increase, you know, ads is one of them, you know,

[05:49] the second one is like, you know, ad new product. And then it's higher, you know, it's men, whatever.

[05:56] You've got these things that you want to do. Now, if I were to ask you of these things, if you

[06:01] just had 100% certainty that you could accomplish one of them, one year from now, which of them

[06:07] would get you the furthest? Now, when you look at all these, you might be like, well, honestly,

[06:12] even if I were to crack the new ads, I still need a salesman. And the new product is, you know,

[06:19] important, but if I don't have a salesman to sell it, then I can't do anything. It's like, okay.

[06:24] So then everything you have comes down to getting this done. And so this is now your priority.

[06:30] You can ignore everything else because until this happens, nothing else matters. Now,

[06:37] I give two examples that were contingencies. What if there are things that you could do in

[06:41] parallel? Like, well, what if I started to develop an app so that by the time I have my salesman,

[06:47] then I'll have something to sell. Well, the problem with this is this is just my experiences that

[06:52] like the parties, there's limited resources. I find that people actually do things faster chronologically

[06:58] or linearly than in parallel, especially when it's when you're focusing all the resources of a company

[07:03] on one specific point. Because if you know that you can only do one thing with all of your resources,

[07:08] guess what? You get it done faster because you have so many other things you have to do.

[07:12] Because every single person feels like they're holding the entire company back, which they are.

[07:16] But what happens when you pursue multiple things is that no one feels like they're holding

[07:19] the entire company back and then nothing gets done. And so this is why you feel so busy.

[07:24] You're trying to host all these parties at the same time. So let me explain why it's actually

[07:29] keeping you broke. What you have to realize is the real cost of change. So let's say that this line

[07:34] represents your normal revenue and the business. Okay? If you do a change in the business, then you're

[07:40] almost always going to incur the cost of change. Right? The business is going to go down.

[07:46] My estimate is that whatever we do something new, we lose 20% right off the bat.

[07:51] Before we get to realize any potential, not guaranteed, upside from that change. And so what's

[07:57] interesting though is that many entrepreneurs here this and think, okay, well, I'm willing to

[08:03] risk this 20% decrease because maybe I'll get a 10% increase on whatever you don't on the other

[08:09] side of this. It's like, yeah, but for you to get, do you want to have a guaranteed 20 for a potential

[08:14] a 10? It's not a trade I would make. And so what ends up happening is that you end up realizing

[08:18] that the vast majority of tests you just shouldn't do. It's like it might work and who cares.

[08:24] It's not going to change the business. It's not the constraint. Right? Like, maybe we have some

[08:28] little CRO hack we could do. Sure, is it the thing that's stopping you from getting the

[08:32] 3 to 10 million? Probably not. And so what happens is these are just productive distractions.

[08:37] If you're trying to optimize your way to a 10x, you've got it wrong. You're focused on the wrong thing.

[08:43] After the 20% that means that number one, if you're going to take a shot, it's got to get

[08:47] you at least 20% plus as your upside because you might not even get it. And so for me, this is my

[08:53] rule of thumb. I need at least a 20 on the top side so that I'm willing to take a guarantee 20 on the

[08:58] downside. Now number two is let me show you what it looks like in reality. There's two scenarios.

[09:03] scenario one is that, okay, maybe the thing that we have starts to work, right? So our performance

[09:08] does to go up. But then right around here, we're like, you know what? Let's do another change.

[09:12] And so we have these changes that could work, but we're always mid another change. And so

[09:17] actually our performance is more here versus what it would be if we just change nothing. Now,

[09:23] that's if this is under the assumption that all the changes you have are going to improve the

[09:27] business. But what if you're changing things and some of the changes you make, actually make the

[09:32] business worse. And so this is when I see these people who are stuck at a million dollars a year,

[09:38] three million dollars a year, ten million dollars a year and they've been stuck there for multiple

[09:41] years in a row. It's simply because they're changing too many things and because they're working

[09:45] on the wrong thing, right? And because they're changing so many things, they never have the bandwidth.

[09:49] They're starting too many parties at once to just focus on the one party that if they can crush it,

[09:54] they can get on the front page of the news. Right? And so I had a business that came out here

[09:58] really awesome lady and she had been stuck for a while, right? And so she was starting too many new

[10:04] things. Basically, she was always running new marketing promotions and starting new conversion mechanisms

[10:09] because that was the thing that she loved the most as an nurse. She just loved selling. Right?

[10:13] So she always wanted to innovate the sales process, but like the sales wasn't the constraint in the

[10:17] business. She's really good at sales. And so despite it being the thing that she enjoyed,

[10:21] it had nothing to do with the thing that was limiting the business. And when I talked about the

[10:25] thing that were clearly limiting the business, I could see her energy to flight because she was

[10:28] just like, I'm not good at that. I have it out source and I was like, yeah, it shows.

[10:32] And I was like said differently, I was like, imagine you and she was like, I paid this person $3,000 a month

[10:37] to manage my organic, manage my organic, right? I was like, okay, imagine you paid someone $3,000 a

[10:43] month to handle all of the pitching because you used up she just pitched it's like, one to many.

[10:46] I said, do you think that it would work and she was like, God, no, I was like, right? There

[10:51] were people who were as good at you at making content as you are at pitching and you need to be

[10:57] that good at also marketing on the front end. And so the issue was that she never had the Ben with

[11:03] to even do this because every single month or two, she was changing the conversion process,

[11:08] right? Thinking that this is the thing that was limiting the business. But the reality is she converted

[11:12] about the same amount every time and she had just had to keep working harder and harder because

[11:16] she was getting fewer leads. And so she was getting better and better, but she was focused on the

[11:20] wrong part of the funnel. She was trying to say, how, like the thing is you can only convert 100%.

[11:24] You can't get past 100 and you're never going to hit 100. And so the problem is we need to get more

[11:29] people in the bucket, right? And so for her every time she did this, she would have to her team and

[11:33] have to relearn new systems, her customers might get confused about her positioning, because it was a

[11:36] whole new wrapper around her sales process and even her product itself. She would start losing momentum

[11:41] because she had these constant changes that were happening. And so I'll tell you for me, when I look

[11:46] at all of the stuff and this is what I was talking to her, I said, you just have to accept that some

[11:49] stuff is good enough because it's not the constraint. And this is, this is counter to the perfectionist

[11:54] culture of like everything has to be perfect. First off, nothing is going to be perfect. And I love

[11:58] Jack Dorsey said this. He said, make the details perfect, limit the number of details. Getting this

[12:03] conversion process perfect, the thing that was going to lock the business? No, it's not. You either

[12:08] have to have a product that's so good that people talk about it endlessly and then that's what

[12:12] grows the business or you have to marketing that's so good that you let everybody know about your

[12:17] stuff. And many people obsess about the stuff in the middle. But on either ends, that's where the

[12:21] highest leverage exists. So what does this mean in practice? If the metrics that you have for the

[12:26] thing that you love are above or at your industry benchmark, leave it alone. It's not the thing

[12:31] that's limiting your business. Because you need to free up all that bandwidth so that you can actually

[12:36] learn the new skills or focus on the thing that really is limiting your business, which is probably

[12:40] the thing you suck at and you don't like doing a new outsource. This is the clean reality of

[12:44] small business. Is that small business owners tend to have the most ideas if things they can do,

[12:51] but small businesses in general have the lowest capacity to pursue new ideas. You are so resource

[12:57] constrained. Like you have so little time and so little effort and so few people and capital that

[13:04] you can actually do anything, especially if you want to do it right? The best hope you can possibly

[13:08] have if you really want to compete is to just do one thing well. I'll give you an example of one

[13:14] of my favorite chains, which is raising canes. And if you want to really study business like

[13:18] study raising canes, the owner owns all of them. He has no franchisees. He owns them all. The guy said

[13:24] Gavillianer and he's not that, he's not all. He's I think he's in his 40s. He's a savage. And part of

[13:30] the recent that chain has been so successful is because he was so militant about the few things that

[13:36] they were going to do well. It's like we've got our fries, we've got Texas toast, we've got coleslaw,

[13:43] we've got tenders and they've got sauces and beverages. That's it. And if you want to have a

[13:48] sandwich, they just take the tenders and they put it between two pieces of Texas toast. Right? Like

[13:52] they just take those few ingredients because they're like if we just nail this, we don't need to do

[13:57] anything else and I really want to hit on this really hard. If you can think to yourself, if all I

[14:01] did was this, nothing else would matter, then why are you letting anything else matter? And the

[14:07] tough part is that many of your ideas are probably good. It's just that they will fail because of

[14:12] the lack of execution, not because of lack of quality ideas. And they will all fail if you try and

[14:17] execute all of them. Yes, including the one that you love that you're thinking about right now,

[14:21] as I'm saying this and you're thinking, oh, I wonder if you's talking about that. Yes, I'm talking

[14:24] about that. And so I'll give you a couple examples for me personally. Even at a micro level with

[14:28] an abyssonist, I had a short editor who was good editor and then we had him focused on two different

[14:33] platforms and both platforms suffered. When we focused in one just one platform, all of a sudden,

[14:38] the views from that one platform got more than the views from both platforms that he when he was

[14:43] working on them split. Think about how loud that is. He was able to get one, which he had already

[14:47] been working on to do more than both together when he just focused on one. You know, every

[14:52] month we invite entrepreneurs out here to the headquarters who are doing big things and that

[14:56] way we can meet more businesses. When we have these events, my team always thinks about things that

[15:00] we could do better. We made this rule where we said, hey, what if we do nothing new? Zero new things,

[15:05] just execute all the things that we know that make an event good. Nothing else. And we did that.

[15:10] And then four times in a row, we had the best NPS, best everything score from the event. And I was

[15:16] like, right, every time we change things, R&PS goes down. Don't change anything. Everyone loves it the

[15:22] way it is. The thing is is that you will get tired of your business before your customers even know

[15:27] anything about it. Because remember, they have zero context. You might think, oh, man, we did this

[15:32] one thing that one time and we didn't do it this time. No one knows. No one knows. And so,

[15:38] hopefully now you understand how changing everything is limiting your ability to win. And so the

[15:43] question then is, okay, you know, following my own rules, don't just say stop doing this, say do this

[15:48] instead. So here's what to do instead. Now number three is how to allocate your effort into the best

[15:53] opportunity vehicles. Half patients. Now that sounds super lame. So let me tell you what that actually

[16:00] means. So patients is just figuring out what to do in the meantime. And so I'll tell you for me personally,

[16:05] I make a big list of ideas. And it is out, like, just name it something ridiculous so that you can

[16:10] remind yourself how ridiculous you are for always having these ideas. I have this Mando. And I'm talking

[16:15] like, I probably have 200 plus items of ideas that I have, of things that can make money, or would

[16:20] be improvements to our existing business or process. So this is actually my list. So I have, you know,

[16:26] AI stuff we can do, traffic stuff we can do, conversion rate stuff we can do, LTV stuff we can do.

[16:32] These are all tests that we can consider. These are essential ideas, these are renewal ideas.

[16:37] And these are just like, and I see them and I'm like, man, these are such good ideas. And right now,

[16:43] we're not doing any of them. And the last time I grabbed something from that list, you guys want to know what

[16:47] it was? In 18 months, I grabbed three things from that list. Just, and I probably have more resources

[16:53] capital and talent than the vast majority of businesses have. And I say this to to demonstrate how

[16:59] incredibly hard it is. And what's really crazy, and this is nuts, you will feel so much relief,

[17:05] because you will realize that much of your anxiety and your stress comes from this list that you have

[17:10] created for yourself that you have not done. And so all you do is you basically take your entire to

[17:15] do list and say, this is no longer my to do list anymore. I'm just going to take the things we're

[17:20] already doing and we're going to do them well. And I promise you, you will make more money,

[17:24] and that will depress you, because you will realize that the biggest problem in your business is

[17:28] lack of execution, not lack of new ideas. This is a lesson that has taken me way too long to learn.

[17:33] And I'm trying to pass it on to you now, and most of you don't have the discipline to be able to do it.

[17:38] But the few of you who do will honestly, it will depress you by how simple it can be. It doesn't mean

[17:44] it's easy, because you will have to fight your internal nature every day. Like Warren Buffett has this

[17:49] example where he says, if you only had a punch card that had 20 punches on it for the stocks you

[17:54] could buy for the rest of your life, and once you used up this 20, you can never use them again.

[17:57] You'd be a significantly better investor. So if you were an entrepreneur and you only got one

[18:01] punch per year of something that you were going to optimize towards just one, you would look

[18:06] real hard at that list. It'd be like, okay, which of these one things if I only did this would get us

[18:12] the most? And what's happens is that when you put that kind of constraint on, you do an

[18:16] up realizing that, well, you know what if we did solve this one thing, it would basically change everything

[18:20] for us. Right, then why are we wasting our time with these bullshit, not hard, side quests?

[18:27] So if you'd like our help to identify at the highest leverage point, you can go to acq.com

[18:31] towards ice Vegas, and we hold it every month. I would love to meet you in person and have you out.

[18:35] And if you do those things, I think that you will have a phenomenally more profitable business.

[18:40] And most of all, how to allocate your effort into the best opportunity vehicle so you can

[18:45] achieve critical mass and finally turn your busyness into business.

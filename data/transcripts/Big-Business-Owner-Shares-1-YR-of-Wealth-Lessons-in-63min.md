[00:00] What's going on everyone?

[00:02] Happy Tuesday.

[00:04] I hope you're having a phenomenal day,

[00:07] but every day it is that you're listening to this.

[00:09] I had a lot of requests from Instagram and DMs,

[00:14] and thank you for those.

[00:16] For the 2020 Lessons and Failures,

[00:19] this will be a sequel to my 2019 Lessons and Failures,

[00:23] which if you haven't listened to that one,

[00:25] I think my year-long recaps are,

[00:28] I think some of my better ones,

[00:30] but it's obviously up to you.

[00:32] So this one will probably a little longer than what you're used to.

[00:36] And that's because trying to summarize what I learned in a year is hard

[00:40] in one episode.

[00:41] And so for those of you who don't know,

[00:44] I keep it ongoing email thread to myself.

[00:48] Consistently consolidating,

[00:51] 2020 Lessons and Failures,

[00:53] so you can,

[00:54] maybe you can't see it on the thing,

[00:56] but it's there.

[00:57] All right, and so I have this big thread

[00:59] that I just continue to email myself whenever I

[01:02] feel like I learned a lesson.

[01:04] And so I will do my very best to tell you

[01:09] each of the lessons that I learned and how I learned it.

[01:12] And 2020 was a,

[01:14] was a packed year of lessons for me.

[01:17] And so,

[01:18] oh,

[01:19] where to start?

[01:21] Where?

[01:23] Where?

[01:26] Where?

[01:27] Okay.

[01:28] Well,

[01:31] from the $500,

[01:33] you know,

[01:34] a million dollar mastermind,

[01:35] I learned a lot.

[01:36] From there,

[01:37] I really learned about scale,

[01:40] and seeing the people that we're doing more than me,

[01:42] all we're going after bigger markets.

[01:44] So,

[01:45] there's really two options for me to do that

[01:49] within the context of Jim launch.

[01:50] One is go after,

[01:54] find alternative and additional channels to grow the business,

[01:58] because, you know,

[01:59] it's not like we've sold 100% of Jims.

[02:01] And so that means that I have to find new ways to reach them.

[02:04] So, if my traditional advertising methods,

[02:07] obviously,

[02:08] you know, you can exhaust a platform,

[02:10] especially if there's a niche.

[02:12] It's usually much bigger than you think it is.

[02:14] But you may not have reached every single person on that platform,

[02:18] but you may have reached every person that you could reach on that platform

[02:20] profitably.

[02:22] So that's kind of the differentiation.

[02:24] And so,

[02:25] for me,

[02:26] seeing all these people who are doing more than me,

[02:29] and I was, you know,

[02:31] providing value to them in a lot of ways.

[02:33] And it's always like,

[02:35] it's been a consistent effort of mine to try and understand

[02:38] if there's anyone who makes more money than me.

[02:40] What it is that they have,

[02:41] or what it is that I have that they do not have.

[02:44] Because sometimes the question is not,

[02:46] this is an interesting one for you that I've learned also,

[02:49] because it's not always good to say,

[02:51] what is this person out that I don't?

[02:53] Sometimes it's,

[02:54] what do they lack that I have?

[02:56] And I think oftentimes it's more frequently the case,

[02:59] which is why it's always backwards,

[03:00] which is why I think the learning process is interesting.

[03:02] And so, you know,

[03:04] champions,

[03:05] beat normal people at their endeavor,

[03:07] not because they have something the other person doesn't,

[03:09] but because they lack the ability to stop working,

[03:11] they lack the off switch.

[03:13] And so, I think sometimes not only thinking,

[03:15] what do they have,

[03:16] but what do I have that's limiting me?

[03:18] Rather than what do they have that's giving them

[03:21] an advantage over me?

[03:22] So, first off,

[03:23] just even switching my thought process to thinking that way,

[03:26] has been a lesson of 2020 for me,

[03:29] from an entrepreneur perspective.

[03:31] Before I go any further,

[03:33] I'll just stay this so that I'm supposed to keep things interesting

[03:36] during these podcasts.

[03:37] So, we hit our $100 million amount in 2020,

[03:41] which is kind of weird.

[03:42] So, just to clarify this for anyone,

[03:44] the reason I didn't put it on this award yet

[03:46] is because I'm not very handy with things,

[03:48] and I'll probably mess it up.

[03:49] So, I'll have someone else to it.

[03:51] But just for transparency,

[03:53] that means I've done $100 million total sales

[03:55] in the last three and a half years.

[03:57] And so, we did,

[03:59] we did $30 million,

[04:01] we did $28 million in,

[04:03] we did $7 million in,

[04:05] in 2016,

[04:07] we did $28 million in 2017,

[04:10] in 2018,

[04:13] we did $37 million in 2019,

[04:17] and in 2020,

[04:18] I think we finished at $31.

[04:19] We're still getting the final books for this year.

[04:22] But yeah, so that was,

[04:24] you know, that's the deal.

[04:25] That's how we hit $100 million,

[04:27] so it's not like I did $100 million in 2020,

[04:28] just for full transparency,

[04:30] because I think some people thought that, that's not what it was.

[04:33] But I made a podcast about how

[04:36] I've been stuck at $30 million for three years,

[04:40] and I finally figured out

[04:42] what I need to do to fix it.

[04:44] And among those,

[04:47] is hiring really good talent.

[04:50] That is one.

[04:52] Another one,

[04:53] it sounds like so like,

[04:55] duh, Alex.

[04:56] But I feel like it's so many times

[04:58] the lessons that I learn are not,

[04:59] like nothing's novel,

[05:01] like nothing's novel,

[05:02] it's just at what point does,

[05:03] we call them,

[05:04] cinch moments,

[05:05] but at what point does something that you've heard

[05:06] your whole life become real for you?

[05:08] You know,

[05:09] for some of us,

[05:10] it's like,

[05:11] you're trying to others,

[05:12] something you hear your whole life,

[05:13] but maybe some moment or some event triggers that for you,

[05:16] and you're like,

[05:17] maybe I should be kind of people,

[05:18] and then you start changing the way you live.

[05:21] And so for me,

[05:23] you know, I've always heard niche down,

[05:24] I think it's important to niche,

[05:26] especially when you're starting,

[05:28] but you will eventually be constrained by that niche.

[05:31] But that being said,

[05:32] if you're like,

[05:33] I get this one all the time from our clients,

[05:35] which is like,

[05:36] man,

[05:37] I got my niche is too small,

[05:38] and like,

[05:39] you're a niche is a six billion dollar industry,

[05:41] and you think that you're doing half a million dollars a year

[05:43] is somehow tap that niche.

[05:45] You just have such a poor business model that your lifetime value of a customer is so low that you can only profitably reach a half,

[06:01] I mean,

[06:02] like a quarter of a quarter of a quarter of a percent of your market.

[06:05] So it's really important to delineate between

[06:07] or the economics behind my business model,

[06:09] stifling my ability to scale and grow profitably.

[06:12] I think those are two very different things,

[06:15] and everyone just likes to say,

[06:17] flex to point outwardly,

[06:18] because it's easier to say,

[06:19] oh, my niche is small,

[06:20] rather than saying,

[06:22] no, my business model sucks,

[06:24] and I have no way of profitably reaching these people,

[06:26] which either means you need to fix your business model,

[06:28] or you need to find alternative or additional acquisition channels.

[06:31] And so for us,

[06:32] I think we have a,

[06:33] I don't know of a lot of businesses that have higher LTV from,

[06:37] you know,

[06:38] microgermowners than us,

[06:39] and it's candidly because we provide more value than everyone else doesn't the marketplace,

[06:43] that is why you get rewarded.

[06:44] And so,

[06:45] I mean,

[06:47] I always am trying to expand LTV,

[06:49] provide more value,

[06:50] find ways that we can,

[06:51] you know, solve problems.

[06:52] And I,

[06:54] I will always continue to do that,

[06:56] but given the numbers that we have,

[06:57] the,

[06:59] one of the lessons of 2020 is expanding additional acquisition channels.

[07:03] And so we were able to build an outbound acquisition channel,

[07:05] in 2020,

[07:06] so that was,

[07:07] really cool.

[07:09] And the additional part of what made that cool for me was that I actually had someone else

[07:13] own the entire process end end,

[07:14] so when I talk about hiring high level talent,

[07:17] it's really for me transitioning from the what to the who,

[07:20] and you probably heard that before,

[07:22] but on some level,

[07:23] it became real for me.

[07:24] And the obsessive nature of the entrepreneur of wanting to learn how to do everything

[07:28] is absolutely required in the beginning,

[07:31] but as you scale up,

[07:34] it is more about finding the who,

[07:36] but the thing is that in the beginning,

[07:38] you think too soon you need to find the who and in reality,

[07:40] you still need to learn the things,

[07:42] that make the business work.

[07:43] And so I think,

[07:44] that's why context in timing is so hard with these things,

[07:47] because we have to find,

[07:48] like when I'm trying to give advice,

[07:50] you know,

[07:51] you have to take it within like your current paradigm,

[07:53] and I understand that that's difficult,

[07:55] and that's why sometimes it's hard listening to billionaires,

[07:57] because it's like their paradigm of,

[07:59] of what's happening,

[08:00] what is,

[08:01] what's happening,

[08:02] and what's happening,

[08:03] and what's happening,

[08:04] and what's happening,

[08:05] and what's happening,

[08:06] and what's happening,

[08:07] and what's happening,

[08:08] and what's happening,

[08:09] and what's happening,

[08:10] and what's happening,

[08:17] and what's happening,

[08:18] and what's happening,

[08:19] and what's happening,

[08:40] and what's happening,

[08:41] and what's happening,

[08:42] and what's happening,

[08:43] and what's happening,

[08:44] and what's happening,

[08:45] and what's happening,

[08:46] and what's happening,

[08:47] and what's happening,

[08:48] and what's happening,

[08:49] and what's happening,

[08:50] and what's happening,

[08:51] and what's happening,

[08:52] and what's happening,

[08:53] and what's happening,

[08:54] and what's happening,

[08:55] and what's happening,

[08:56] and what's happening,

[08:57] and what's happening,

[08:58] and what's happening,

[08:59] and as a,

[09:00] as a, as a,

[09:01] as a coordinator that,

[09:02] my role within the company,

[09:03] I would say,

[09:04] in 2020 transition from being

[09:06] a CEO to being

[09:09] investor slash owner,

[09:11] slash stakeholder shareholder,

[09:13] whatever way you want to say it,

[09:14] but really,

[09:15] I would say for the first time,

[09:17] in 2020,

[09:18] I really transitioned to being above the business,

[09:20] not in like a weird air going away,

[09:22] just like,

[09:23] not truly being out of it,

[09:24] and so,

[09:25] I think there's definitely levels

[09:26] to being out of it,

[09:27] you know,

[09:29] you own your own job,

[09:30] you're self-employed,

[09:31] that's just you doing things,

[09:33] for other people for money,

[09:34] you just someone else is paying you,

[09:35] and you're doing stuff.

[09:36] You know,

[09:37] above that,

[09:38] you start becoming a manager

[09:39] and managing other people,

[09:40] right? And then above that,

[09:41] you become a leader,

[09:42] and then above that,

[09:43] in my opinion,

[09:44] you become an executive,

[09:45] right?

[09:46] which is like leading

[09:47] organizational change in,

[09:48] and departmental change around

[09:50] objectives that are going to

[09:51] protect the business or grow the business,

[09:53] right?

[09:54] And I think the level above that

[09:56] is where I feel like this year,

[09:58] I was able to get to.

[10:00] I could be wrong.

[10:01] We'll find out in 2021,

[10:03] lessons and failures.

[10:05] But I've,

[10:07] right now,

[10:08] I'm not,

[10:09] I don't actually do anything

[10:11] in the business,

[10:12] besides meat with

[10:14] two leaders a week,

[10:17] and really advise on the ways

[10:21] that we can strategically improve the business

[10:24] and provide more value.

[10:25] And so that's really the majority of my time

[10:27] is like,

[10:28] looking at the overall marketplace

[10:30] and thinking like,

[10:31] how can we provide more value

[10:32] in a strategic way to everyone,

[10:34] right? And what of,

[10:35] of the many ways,

[10:36] what is the one thing that we're going to focus on?

[10:38] And so,

[10:39] I think 2020 was also a really humbling year

[10:42] for me,

[10:43] because we got to refocus

[10:45] on the few things that provide the most value.

[10:48] And so for us,

[10:49] it's,

[10:50] we need to get gyms leads,

[10:51] because that's what everyone wants.

[10:54] And that's about it.

[10:56] You know,

[10:57] pretty much any other,

[10:58] endeavors that are not focused on those things

[11:00] are kind of a waste,

[11:02] as much as,

[11:03] you know,

[11:04] people may need to have better retention tactics,

[11:06] better,

[11:07] you know,

[11:08] better profit margins,

[11:09] and we talk a lot about that.

[11:10] Whenever we do talk about that,

[11:12] we loop people who lose interest

[11:13] because entrepreneurial's,

[11:14] most entrepreneurs that I serve,

[11:16] only think about revenue,

[11:18] right?

[11:19] The only thing about that

[11:20] is that we do talk about that,

[11:21] we loop people who lose interest

[11:22] and that's what I'm talking about.

[11:23] Right? The only thing about growth,

[11:24] rather than what am I taking home,

[11:26] how much risk am I exposed to,

[11:27] that kind of stuff.

[11:28] And I think that just comes with time.

[11:29] But I will practice what I preach,

[11:31] and not sell what I want to sell,

[11:33] I will sell what they want to buy.

[11:35] And so that is how,

[11:36] you know,

[11:37] we've cut a ton of access out in 2020

[11:40] in the business,

[11:41] and so,

[11:42] really focusing on a handful of key priorities,

[11:45] has been really useful.

[11:48] And interestingly,

[11:49] I think the business is actually improved

[11:51] since I've moved further away from it,

[11:52] because I tend to break things a lot,

[11:54] because I want to fix it till it's broken,

[11:55] if you know what I mean.

[11:56] And so,

[11:57] giving our leadership space to just

[11:59] transact,

[12:00] you know,

[12:01] run the business has been really valuable.

[12:04] And I think it's actually been,

[12:06] I think it's been better for the business overall.

[12:08] So,

[12:09] those were some of my initial lesson.

[12:12] I've got a whole bunch,

[12:13] so I'm just going to keep going through this.

[12:14] So, one of the next ones was,

[12:16] I was talking to Brookestillo,

[12:18] she is an amazing business,

[12:20] a good friend of mine.

[12:22] If you've heard of her,

[12:23] life coach, school podcast,

[12:25] check her out, she's an amazing pot,

[12:26] she's a huge following.

[12:28] And she didn't say this directly,

[12:30] but like the term that came in my mind

[12:32] was scale,

[12:33] scale zero,

[12:34] and simple scales,

[12:35] and or zero scales.

[12:37] I'll have to come up with something catchy for that.

[12:39] But,

[12:40] basically,

[12:43] the reason that I had to be get into the,

[12:46] you know,

[12:47] quote in investor or owner type role,

[12:49] I believe is because if I am involved

[12:52] in any really day-to-day activity,

[12:55] I will become the bottleneck, right?

[12:58] And it's not a bottleneck of communication,

[13:00] which is what happens when you are the manager,

[13:02] as a bottleneck,

[13:03] but as somebody who even provides value in any way,

[13:07] if it requires you to be there,

[13:10] to provide the value,

[13:11] then as soon as the team grows outside of you,

[13:14] providing that value,

[13:15] if it cannot grow without you,

[13:16] providing whatever that value is,

[13:18] then it will stop there.

[13:19] And so I think that's 2020 was really my transition of,

[13:22] of moving above that,

[13:24] and so I think that was kind of the win for the year.

[13:27] And so that was kind of one of the lessons that I learned

[13:30] is you have to scale zero.

[13:32] Like I have to get myself to doing nothing,

[13:34] and still have the company make money and grow,

[13:38] and be profitable, et cetera,

[13:39] in order for us to be able to grow beyond where we're at.

[13:44] And I think that's much easier said than done,

[13:47] especially because a lot of company start,

[13:49] because the entrepreneur is skilled in a certain way,

[13:51] or has variety of skills,

[13:52] which is usually what happens.

[13:53] We have a stack of skills,

[13:54] which is why we start growing.

[13:57] And then somehow you have to,

[13:59] in the beginning,

[14:01] extricably,

[14:02] or intrinsically link yourself to every aspect of the business,

[14:05] or what makes it grow,

[14:06] and then piece by piece,

[14:07] peel off each of these skills and traits,

[14:10] and things that you don't even know you do,

[14:12] and the business to keep it moving.

[14:14] And that's taken time,

[14:16] and it's taken for Alan Air,

[14:18] and it's been difficult,

[14:20] but ultimately rewarding,

[14:22] because now, right now,

[14:23] that's how it's like one day,

[14:25] we get focused on all my leadership meetings,

[14:27] and that's it.

[14:28] And then beyond that,

[14:29] it's just strategic insight on monthly and quarterlys.

[14:32] So that's given me a lot more time to really focus on the industry,

[14:35] and how we can help overall rather than being kind of like in the tactics.

[14:40] Next one.

[14:43] I have this belief,

[14:46] and it just continues to be reinforced that.

[14:49] See if you can just keep growing and not hire people.

[14:53] We have had,

[14:56] I mean all you got to do is look at our atrocious glass door reviews,

[15:00] which suck,

[15:02] to know that like we have,

[15:03] we hire fast,

[15:04] we've had a tendency to hire fast,

[15:07] and fire fast,

[15:08] so we have followed that mantra.

[15:11] But I,

[15:13] and the thing is,

[15:14] part of the difficulty of having a business that grows quickly is,

[15:18] or has any level of volatility month to month,

[15:21] is that you have these waxing and weaning demands for labor,

[15:25] right?

[15:26] And so it's like you need five people,

[15:27] and then the next month you don't need the five people anymore.

[15:30] And, you know,

[15:31] I'm not saying we hire five people and then let them go.

[15:33] It's more that like that consistent variability

[15:37] can be annoying from a payroll and labor standpoint.

[15:41] And,

[15:42] which unfortunately happened many,

[15:44] many times is,

[15:46] we'll bring people on.

[15:49] We will solve the problem,

[15:52] and then they won't,

[15:53] and it really should be like,

[15:55] you know, for defined periods of time,

[15:57] you know, like project based and whatnot.

[15:59] The problem we solved,

[16:01] and after we let the people go,

[16:03] the business grows more.

[16:05] And that's kind of weird in backwards for me as an entrepreneur,

[16:08] and so I'm going to just try and make sense of it out loud with you.

[16:11] But,

[16:14] I kind of have this belief that only one out of five employees

[16:17] in a company is providing value.

[16:19] Like, I actually, like, kind of believe that.

[16:22] I kind of the 80, 20 people are fractal.

[16:26] I just can't, like,

[16:28] I just, the amount of times that we've literally gotten rid of,

[16:31] like, a department,

[16:32] because it's just like,

[16:33] we created a department, for example,

[16:35] to solve a problem.

[16:36] Let's say it was churn.

[16:37] And provide value in all these ways to solve churn.

[16:41] And then after scaling that,

[16:43] after six months realizing that churn is completely unaffected,

[16:46] and we just took 20 more employees on,

[16:48] and then having just be like,

[16:49] well, guys,

[16:51] you didn't solve the problem,

[16:52] and as much as you're doing stuff,

[16:54] it does,

[16:55] it's not doing anything, right?

[16:57] And so then we have to, you know,

[16:59] let people go because it is a business,

[17:01] and then, and then just realizing that the business

[17:04] literally doesn't change at all.

[17:06] Like revenue doesn't change,

[17:07] churn doesn't change,

[17:08] profit doesn't change,

[17:09] what profit goes up.

[17:10] And that's it.

[17:11] That is just like,

[17:12] it's mind blowing to me.

[17:13] It's like, there are so many people,

[17:14] especially during organization grows that you're like,

[17:16] this person was totally unnecessary.

[17:18] And that's crazy,

[17:19] because from the employee perspective,

[17:21] it's like,

[17:22] how can you do that?

[17:24] And I understand that perspective,

[17:25] but on the flip side is the owner,

[17:26] like,

[17:27] man,

[17:28] this person was

[17:29] 90,000 dollars a year.

[17:31] Like, people are afraid of signing up for a mastermind,

[17:33] and yet will hire an employee for 50,000 dollars a year

[17:36] without even thinking about it.

[17:38] And it's just like,

[17:39] which of these things is providing more value?

[17:41] You know what I mean?

[17:42] And so that's something that's been like mind blowing to me,

[17:44] is seeing a company grow after shrinking.

[17:48] It's like,

[17:49] it's crazy,

[17:50] and it's happened so many times,

[17:52] and it happened twice in 2020,

[17:53] for us,

[17:54] where I would get rid of a key team,

[17:56] or key,

[17:57] you know,

[17:58] that we were tracking metrics on,

[18:00] and we kind of implemented it into,

[18:02] to provide a solution,

[18:03] and then it disappeared,

[18:04] right?

[18:05] And because the solution,

[18:06] like,

[18:07] it did not solve the problem,

[18:08] and therefore,

[18:09] was not providing the value that it was supposed to.

[18:10] And so people were essentially cutting grass with scissors,

[18:12] which doesn't,

[18:13] they're doing stuff,

[18:14] but it doesn't mean it's being valuable, right?

[18:16] And so,

[18:17] I am now really trying to add the constraints

[18:21] to,

[18:22] I want to see if we can grow with no people.

[18:24] Like,

[18:25] how can we look at Berkshire Hathaway?

[18:26] How can we look at Warren Buffett who has

[18:28] 19 employees and runs a gigantic company?

[18:31] How can we find fewer smarter people

[18:36] that are pre-loaded with solutions,

[18:38] like I said earlier?

[18:39] But it's like,

[18:40] I'm just trying to hit it this in multiple ways,

[18:41] because it's really ingrained in me this year,

[18:44] how important having an A player is compared,

[18:47] like one A player literally does more work than five B players.

[18:51] It's crazy.

[18:52] Like, most people actually do nothing.

[18:54] Like, it's crazy.

[18:56] Like, most people don't do anything.

[18:58] And that's why they can't progress.

[19:01] I mean, like,

[19:02] as a tangential site story,

[19:03] you know,

[19:04] there's a guy that I've seen in a mastermind.

[19:06] This is an entrepreneur, right?

[19:07] And he's like,

[19:10] hey,

[19:11] and this is three years ago when I met him,

[19:13] he was like,

[19:14] yeah, I'm going to start an in Facebook ads.

[19:15] And I was like,

[19:16] awesome.

[19:17] Fantastic.

[19:19] That's a great idea.

[19:20] And because his biggest issue

[19:21] was that he couldn't get lead gen, right?

[19:22] Sorted.

[19:23] And I saw him in an event three years later.

[19:25] And I was like,

[19:27] hey man, how's it going?

[19:28] How's it business?

[19:29] And he was like, yeah,

[19:31] we're going to start,

[19:32] we're going to,

[19:33] we're definitely going to start a Facebook ads soon.

[19:35] And I was just like,

[19:37] bro,

[19:38] it's been three years.

[19:39] Like, what are you doing?

[19:40] Like,

[19:41] like,

[19:42] what are you doing?

[19:43] You know what I mean?

[19:44] Like, you know what I mean?

[19:45] There's different,

[19:46] it's different for me if someone's like trying to figure out what the obstacle is.

[19:49] Versus knowing what the obstacle is and not doing anything about it.

[19:52] That's,

[19:53] that's the one that kind of drives me nuts.

[19:54] And so it's, I was like, dude,

[19:55] if you literally spent one day and just Google how to run a Facebook ad,

[19:58] you would be able to run a Facebook ad by the end of the day.

[20:01] Like, this is not a quarter-long solution.

[20:03] Like,

[20:04] do it.

[20:05] You know what I mean?

[20:06] And so,

[20:07] I say that to say a lot of people think they're productive when,

[20:09] in fact, they are busy and actually do nothing.

[20:11] And I don't know if it's,

[20:13] it's their fault or whatever,

[20:15] but that is just an observation that I've had

[20:17] and seeing the company become more profitable and grow.

[20:21] Even while we contracted resources is sadly reassuring or reaffirming.

[20:29] And so it's just like,

[20:30] you probably know if you're in a company of any size that like,

[20:33] there's like a handful of people that you know that everybody knows,

[20:36] because there's the people who move, right?

[20:38] Like, there are people in our company that I don't know who they are.

[20:41] And I don't know their names and I'm like,

[20:44] who? They're like, oh, we let go of Kelsey.

[20:46] And I'm like,

[20:47] who's Kelsey?

[20:48] And then now I've kind of been like,

[20:50] I don't know their name, that's why they got like, oh,

[20:52] because if you're doing something,

[20:54] I will hear about you.

[20:55] They're like, oh yeah, this new girl in blah blah,

[20:57] is killing it, right? I'll hear about it.

[20:59] But if I'd never hear a name,

[21:01] it's because you're not doing anything.

[21:02] So, any who, that's another one of the lessons.

[21:05] I told you this was me a longer one and probably more encapsulated.

[21:09] Ah, okay, next one.

[21:11] Oh my God.

[21:13] Data management is,

[21:15] has been the biggest mistake or,

[21:18] has been the thing that I messed up the most in the last three years,

[21:22] which is having a really good ERP or CRM

[21:26] that I run everything through to as properly set up.

[21:28] And this is plagued my business for three and a half years.

[21:31] And I think it's actually been one of the things

[21:34] that has kept us at 30-ish, you know, a million a year.

[21:38] And we just got HubSpot.

[21:42] It's expensive.

[21:43] I think we paid 36,000 a year for it.

[21:47] But it's worth every penny.

[21:49] It's just worth every penny.

[21:51] It's so funny because we were like,

[21:53] man, that's so expensive.

[21:54] First year I'm like,

[21:55] do you think that the entire system and all the data

[21:57] of everything that you have is worth more than a front line of boy?

[22:00] Just one.

[22:01] Do you think it could provide value to everyone in the company

[22:03] just fortunately to one front line of boy?

[22:05] Well, yeah.

[22:06] It's like, like, think, you know,

[22:07] think in relative terms.

[22:09] But now we finally are able to track from click to close,

[22:13] which has been gosh,

[22:15] the hardest thing in the world.

[22:16] And if I can start all over again,

[22:17] so if you are, you know,

[22:18] listening to this, like,

[22:19] invest early in really good data systems.

[22:23] Like, it will make your life so much easier.

[22:25] And like, I genuinely,

[22:27] conservatively can say that we've left

[22:30] 30, probably 30 million dollars on the table

[22:32] over the last three and a half years,

[22:33] because of such poor data management.

[22:35] And because of our IT systems

[22:37] have been literally the beta-mix systems.

[22:39] And so, now when I start new things,

[22:41] or I talk to new companies,

[22:42] the first thing I'm looking at is

[22:44] where do you use intract data?

[22:46] What's your CRM?

[22:47] You know, are you one of a Google sheet,

[22:49] you know,

[22:50] ZAR?

[22:51] Is that how you're running everything?

[22:52] Great.

[22:53] Let's put the whole system in place.

[22:55] So that's just a huge one that I feel like.

[22:57] I now, I got the success from that,

[22:59] and I've learned from three years of failures,

[23:01] and so that was a really big one for us.

[23:03] Next one is,

[23:07] three businesses.

[23:09] You know, I shouldn't have three businesses.

[23:11] That's a continued to be a lesson of mine.

[23:13] Because we have procedural labs,

[23:15] Jim launch, and Alan.

[23:17] It's been very hard for me,

[23:18] not from a time perspective,

[23:19] but from an attention perspective,

[23:21] to split my attention like that.

[23:23] And so, I think part of,

[23:25] is this was like a paired lesson in failure,

[23:27] is that I think the decision was incorrect,

[23:30] but I think that the lesson that I learned from it was,

[23:33] it forced me to get out of CEO

[23:37] and into investor owner role.

[23:39] And I think that was,

[23:41] that was the gift of the curse.

[23:43] The curse is that, like I now know that I shouldn't do that

[23:46] in the future, and so now I'm trying to figure out

[23:49] really how to run these as portfolio companies

[23:51] if that makes sense.

[23:52] So that's been the hard part.

[23:54] And the thing is,

[23:55] as you can't undo something like that.

[23:56] You know what I mean?

[23:57] I've got, you know, 100 employees.

[24:00] Like I can't, you know what I mean?

[24:01] So, those are mistakes that are,

[24:05] you know, Jeff basis says,

[24:06] when I'm making a decision,

[24:07] there's reversible decisions in irreversible decisions.

[24:10] Starting a company is in some ways

[24:12] an irreversible decision.

[24:13] And so, it's not completely reversible,

[24:16] but it does, you know,

[24:18] it's long and difficult.

[24:20] You know what I mean?

[24:21] If you want to try and undo that,

[24:23] which is either through a sale or, you know, whatever,

[24:26] or just winding it down.

[24:28] We're trying to like somehow sustain it

[24:30] and systemize it, so it stays at a certain level

[24:32] and doesn't require attention is also hard.

[24:34] And so anyways, that's kind of actually a lot of,

[24:37] what I would say I struggled with in 2020,

[24:39] that I've, you know, actively been putting solutions together

[24:42] for 2021.

[24:43] So I'll let you know how that goes.

[24:45] This is a big one.

[24:46] Know what your game beyond the game is.

[24:48] This is a really big one that I've learned in 2020,

[24:52] which is, you know,

[24:53] you know, my wife and I've made a lot of money.

[24:56] Over last three and a half years,

[24:57] we took 35, 36 million dollars out of the business,

[25:00] just in direct distributions,

[25:02] so that doesn't include,

[25:04] like the actual value of the companies.

[25:06] And you have to know what to do with the money.

[25:10] And I, and I actively, I'll tell you the thought process

[25:12] I had behind this, which was,

[25:14] my second year, so in 2018,

[25:17] we took home 17, 4 in profit,

[25:21] so it's two years ago.

[25:23] And while, at that point, I said,

[25:28] well, if I were to get 20% return to my money,

[25:31] I would make $3.4 million on the 17, right?

[25:34] So, me working on my business makes me 17.

[25:41] So I should just keep working on my business in ignore the money.

[25:45] But at a certain point,

[25:48] the kind of, the lost compounding becomes big enough

[25:52] that it can surpass your regular income.

[25:56] And so, you know, if you look at what 20% of, you know,

[26:00] if, if, for example, I had actively managed it

[26:02] and had 30 million dollars and done 20% growth,

[26:05] it'd be 30, it goes to 36, 36 goes to 42.

[26:09] And at that point, you're making $8 million a year,

[26:11] and that's two years, three years later, right?

[26:13] And so, at some point,

[26:15] you have to, the opportunity cost of not managing the money

[26:18] becomes bigger.

[26:19] And so, and it actually starts to take attention,

[26:21] like a lot of my attention is getting drained

[26:23] on the fact that it's just this gigantic big stack of money

[26:26] that I was like, what am I going to do with this thing, right?

[26:28] I don't want to learn the real estate game.

[26:29] I don't want to learn the, you know,

[26:31] the hard money lending game.

[26:33] I don't want it like there's so many different games for money.

[26:35] I don't want to learn the private equity game.

[26:37] So, I spent probably 30% of my year this year on figuring out

[26:41] how to allocate money.

[26:42] And I try to allocate them within our companies

[26:45] because those are things I have direct control over

[26:47] and I'll get disproportionate returns on,

[26:48] which is, you know, candidly why I started prestigious labs

[26:50] is because I had all this money from general entrepreneurs like,

[26:53] well, what's an antillary business to what I currently have

[26:56] that can provide value to my customers that I can use the same,

[26:58] you know, distribution based and shared services on,

[27:00] that I can make, you know, that I can get it just for portion

[27:03] that we're turning on.

[27:04] And that's what started prestigious labs.

[27:05] And now, you know, two years or two and a half years later,

[27:09] prestigious labs is a good business.

[27:11] It's a, it's a very good business.

[27:13] It provides a lot of value.

[27:14] We paid over $10 million in commissions.

[27:16] So that's been really good.

[27:18] But I don't think it was the correct decision at the time.

[27:23] But now that I have it, I am grateful that we have it.

[27:28] So that's kind of the long and short of that one.

[27:31] But knowing your game beyond the game,

[27:33] because it will distract you because what ends up happening is like,

[27:37] once you start getting into that world, you get sucked into it

[27:40] and then your actual business starts losing your attention.

[27:42] That's where your highest return on attention is,

[27:44] is inside of your business, right?

[27:45] Is your income and growing it, right?

[27:47] Because both your network and the cash flow from your business,

[27:49] both of it, like it's one of the, it's one of the cool things about being an entrepreneur

[27:52] is like the net worth that you have in the equity of your business

[27:54] is usually larger than what you have pulled out of your business,

[27:57] actually most times it's large and we pull out your business.

[28:00] And so that's kind of interesting.

[28:03] And so for me, trying to figure out how to allocate those things has been a priority.

[28:08] So before I get the question, I'll just tell you,

[28:10] this is what I have invested my money in this year.

[28:14] First, we have a whole life insurance policy,

[28:19] a high cash value upfront.

[28:21] You have to be really careful about the people that you work with this

[28:24] because they can totally screw you.

[28:26] And they are incentivized to screw you.

[28:28] And most insurance agents will not want to hear that.

[28:30] But the commission structure that they have for these policies is insane.

[28:36] It destroys the cash value that you earn from these things.

[28:40] So if you decide to set up a whole whole value,

[28:43] whole vet cash value, whatever, insurance policy,

[28:46] one go with the big force, so that's Guardian, New York Life,

[28:50] North Worship Mutual, and UMass.

[28:54] UMass Mutual, excuse me.

[28:56] So there's a big four.

[28:57] They've been all around for over 100 years.

[28:59] New York Life's around for 183 years.

[29:01] They predate the tax code.

[29:03] The reason I did that is because it basically creates a bank account for you that you can use.

[29:12] You obviously pay costs in the beginning.

[29:14] But you can basically loan against the cash value of the insurance.

[29:18] And the cash flow guarantee is guaranteed growth at about 4% a year.

[29:23] And so if you just compare that to a traditional bank account where you're losing money,

[29:26] this at least covers for inflation.

[29:29] And so that allows you to at least park the money in a way that's not devaluing itself.

[29:33] And if you do see opportunities you can loan against it and invest in those things.

[29:37] So that's the first thing that we did.

[29:40] If you ever do one of those, you should be able to break even by year 3 to 5 at most.

[29:44] If it's designed properly,

[29:46] they'll tell you that no, that's going to sacrifice the long term blah blah blah.

[29:51] Of the thing, I think that's horseshit when you when you compare it to the present day cash.

[29:56] Like the value of having your money available to co-invest at the same time is not even an argument in my opinion.

[30:02] It's also how corporations and banks, and Fortune 500 company structure.

[30:06] So ask, so look into co-lean, bully which is corporate owned life insurance and bank owned life insurance.

[30:11] If you want to see how they structure it because they know what they're doing.

[30:14] So that is how we structured it.

[30:16] So that's number one.

[30:17] Number two, we are investing in B and C class, multi-family apartment units, syndication.

[30:24] So that's a big apartment buildings.

[30:26] The reason for that is because I think single family might get hit hard in the next few years.

[30:32] Because I'm looking at like, you know, seven year timelines.

[30:35] I actually think that, I mean, who knows, I don't even make my prediction because there's no point.

[30:40] But I think that that asset class has outperformed other asset classes.

[30:45] And if people downgrade, they're living standards because of some kind of recession because I'm really much more about downside mitigation than I am about getting the upside.

[30:53] Because my upside is in my business.

[30:55] So it's really like, where can I park money that I know it's not going to go anywhere?

[30:58] And so I take infere returns to know that I have no downside or less downside.

[31:02] And so parking money in B and C class real estate has been one of those places through syndicated deals.

[31:09] The third place is I have index funds.

[31:14] So that's indexes of the entire market because again, this is one of the things that I don't want to think about.

[31:19] And I'm not trying to stockpick because this is not how I make income.

[31:23] Like this is not, this is the thing that everyone is like, man, I can get better.

[31:26] Yeah, sure. You can better turns if you're a daily trader, but you also have a business.

[31:29] So are you going to learn that game and be better than the biggest institutions in the world that have, you know,

[31:34] the millions of dollars to literally destroy you?

[31:37] Maybe, but probably not.

[31:39] And so what you can do is be really good at your business and provide good service and

[31:43] pride and value and make more money that way.

[31:44] And then be willing to take the non premium return of active management and basically make money on your,

[31:52] on yourself twice because you're making money on income, doing your thing, and you get passive from your investments.

[31:59] I have a 5% hedge in crypto.

[32:04] I don't really like speculative things, but the only reason I have that is because if for some reason the dollar gets

[32:11] devalued and for some reason we lose the world currency, that would probably greatly appreciate and value.

[32:19] And would the reason it's a hedge is that I'm not trying to make money on it.

[32:23] I'm only saying that I'm putting 5% there so that if that happens, that will probably five acts.

[32:29] If that were to occur, which would offset the losses I would have and basically the majority of my investments.

[32:35] And so that is my, that is the conclusion of my investment strategy and what I am focused on outside of just value creation.

[32:44] The business because that's actually the fastest way for me to increase my net worth.

[32:48] Okay.

[32:50] Next one, if you are financially done, you must have a bigger purpose.

[32:54] So that was one that I learned this year is like, you're like, I mean, I, I shared my number certainly with everyone.

[33:01] I, we need to, like, you have to, you have to, you have to, it sounds stupid.

[33:10] You have to really like what you're doing.

[33:13] And have a purpose beyond it. Otherwise, like, the money starts being meaningless.

[33:19] And it, like, it just, it doesn't incrementally change my life in any way.

[33:24] You know, like, think, think about it. Like, I know this sounds crazy, but just like imagine, if buying a Lamborghini for example was one week's paycheck.

[33:34] Well, what do you do after you buy Lamborghini the next week, right?

[33:37] And let's see by a crazy house and that's like five weeks of paycheck.

[33:40] Well, then what do you do with the other 40, you know, five weeks of the year's paycheck, right?

[33:45] Like, it's, you know, a steak dinner, you know, like, is not that expensive in the relative term of things.

[33:53] Like, if I had a steak dinner two times a day, or, you know, when it's a capital grill,

[33:57] and spent $200 at three meals a day, even, right? That's 200,000 dollars a year.

[34:03] And that is crazy for sure, but it's also like within the relative scheme.

[34:07] And this is where, like, this is where the ultra wealth part starts to get weird.

[34:13] Is that, like, if you have $10 million and you grow by 15 percent, that's a million and a half dollars a year,

[34:22] and that gets bigger. And that's what's weight. Like, it's, you can't eat it.

[34:26] You can't, like, I still eat chicken and rice. Like, it's not, you know, like nothing.

[34:29] I eat bagels and I eat the cheap, delineat from the supermarket.

[34:34] Like, my life hasn't really changed. You know, I have a nicer camera now,

[34:38] and there's a thousand-dollar camera, you know, but you really have to find something that, that,

[34:44] up at it this way. I have found that I must do work that I find meaningful,

[34:49] and that is what gives me purpose in life.

[34:52] Is that what I do, I find the pursuit of that endeavor meaningful,

[34:57] and the actual process itself enjoyable.

[35:00] And so that is one of my, my bigger takeaways of 2020.

[35:03] Later when I spent more time together this year, then we ever have.

[35:06] And man, it was the best thing about this year was my marriage got a lot better.

[35:11] Nothing was bad, but it's just like, we're just really good, and the whole year has been great,

[35:16] which was definitely offset by the craziness of the world.

[35:19] And I think maybe that's, maybe that's why we came even closer together.

[35:22] But really focusing on the marriage is just being my life more enjoyable.

[35:27] Even though we actually made the last profit this year than we did the last two years.

[35:31] And so, yeah, that's, that's that one.

[35:35] I did make one good decision this year.

[35:38] We actually developed a whole CRM for gyms for the same reason,

[35:41] bringing up as you need to have good data management.

[35:44] And I spent a million bucks on this thing, and I realized that I couldn't have four businesses.

[35:52] And so I pretty much just killed the project, and I just wasted a million dollars.

[35:55] So I make lots of mistakes, just so you're aware, lots and lots of mistakes.

[36:00] But that was a good decision.

[36:02] Starting it was not a good decision, but not doing the business after I had made it was a good decision,

[36:06] even with the Sun cost, which was hard.

[36:09] Another one is entrepreneurship comes in cycles and seasons.

[36:12] There are seasons of heavy work, and there are seasons of, there's seasons of reaping and seasons of selling.

[36:17] And I think recognizing that there are cycles is really important,

[36:21] and there's even seasonal cycles, which sounds crazy, but now this is the fourth year for our fifth year that we're going into for us.

[36:28] And every year I'm always like, I feel like January through June, I'm like, we're on fire, you know what I mean?

[36:34] And then by December I'm like, we suck, and we shouldn't be in business, and we're horrible.

[36:38] You know what I mean? And then like, January comes again, and then it was like everything explodes.

[36:42] And so, I, you know, I've now, I come to recognize it, and I prepare the team for it.

[36:48] And I think now that this is like my fourth of physical threat, I'm more steady.

[36:53] And so that's been, I think a lesson in seasonality, I was talking to Brandon from WadiLoss, LadyBoss, weight loss.

[37:01] And he talked about the same thing as he, he and I started around the same time, and he realized the same thing is like,

[37:06] doesn't matter what we do, we are somehow also subject to the cycles of seasonality.

[37:12] And they always have their, you know, Q1 is always their strongest quarter.

[37:17] Why? Because people are more motivated and weight loss when they're going into summer going into spring, you just started, you know,

[37:21] just had Valentine's Day and New Year's Eve. So there's like all the reasons are all right there.

[37:26] You know, once it's August, you know, or July, it's not usually a huge, you know, fitness month, and, you know, a lot of my business is correlated to fitness and weight loss.

[37:36] So that was that one.

[37:38] Ah, three year life cycle of products. So the average product or service has like a three year life cycle,

[37:43] and, you know, Jim launches had to innovate. It's, I would say, product sweet twice. So we started with kind of like the whole six week challenge thing.

[37:51] And then we transitioned to kind of higher ticket hybrid bootcamp packages.

[37:56] And right now, we actually sell the same packages for the acquisition system is different. It's all outbound based,

[38:01] because that's actually where the biggest arbitrage is right now, meaning we can buy leads and get sales.

[38:06] Basically, ROI on time is highest there.

[38:09] And so we just continue to see the cycle of, you know, and you kind of get into these transition points where like a new opportunity opens as another one's closing,

[38:16] and then you kind of have to like, re-adjust the product and jump, and that's always just focusing on like what's working best right now.

[38:22] Another one is having multiple acquisition channels and streams is really valuable. Now that we have outbound, you know, like, I teach the gyms what I'm doing with my own business.

[38:33] Having outbound has been really nice. It's stable. It's much more reliable. It's slower for sure to grow. It took 90 days to really get it right for us.

[38:43] It doesn't take nearly as, I mean, for gyms, like we already have the whole system, but for us to start from scratch and build the whole team and figure out how to find the data,

[38:51] because like it's not just trying to find weight loss, like a lot of people are overweight, not a lot of people are gym owners. So there's, you know, it's different.

[38:57] It's B to C versus B to B, but we had to figure out, okay, where do we find the data? How do we clean the data? How do we create these lists?

[39:02] You know, what software do we use to cold call? What's the script? What's the hook? What do we say on the opener? How do we train the team? Where do we recruit from?

[39:08] How do we compensate these people? How do we set up the sales process at a two step or a three step? Like all those things that we had to figure out from scratch.

[39:14] And it took us about 90 days to figure it out. So, but now that we have it, it's actually really great.

[39:20] And it's just really cool having two things that are really firing side by side between inbound and outbound.

[39:26] I wrote this one again, but simple scales. And so simply like really trying to figure out at all levels the simplest solution, not like oftentimes the best solution is not the best solution because it is more complex.

[39:42] And the simplest solution though it might not be the best solution becomes the best solution because it is actually able to be realized.

[39:50] And so that is the lesson that I have learned in 2020 more so than any years. Like we have made our product suites simpler and more digestible and immediately actionable.

[40:00] And we are getting better client results now than even when there was like crazy Facebook arbitrage. And that took time. You know what I mean?

[40:06] To just learn that because I would say like a year and a half ago, we had so much stuff inside of our product that's like it could be so perfectly customized.

[40:14] The thing is that it was overwhelming for the majority of clients. And so trying to to rectify the complexity versus simplicity equation.

[40:23] You know, you kind of have to find the middle ground and the sweet spot for what's going to serve the most people at the highest level.

[40:29] And so that was just reinforced this year. And honestly right now we're doing, I'm more proud of the Jim Lodge product now than I've ever been, which is pretty cool for me.

[40:39] And another one is that you can make the right decisions and be wrong. And you can make the wrong decisions and be right.

[40:47] And so this is really hard from a learning perspective because let's say for example, I bet my life savings on black at the at the casino right if it hits black was it the right decision.

[41:01] Probably not. And so I may be rewarded for a poor decision. Just like I could make a strategic bet in business that for all reasons was the right call and then COVID hits right and then all of a sudden.

[41:20] That's not that that wasn't the quote right bet, but it was the right decision given the information available. And so things change.

[41:29] There are market dynamics. And so I instead of beating myself up over decisions, I think if all I had was the decision making criteria that I had available to me at the time the information available to me at the time was the decision that I made the best decision.

[41:43] And what I don't want to do is unlearn good habits, right, because we're constantly evolving and growing as entrepreneurs. And so not unlearning good habits.

[41:53] And not reinforcing bad habits that have good outcomes is is something that I have focused on a lot this year. And so sometimes there are short term trades that have long term outcomes.

[42:05] And I think this year was actually much more of a long term focused year for us ironically with all the craziness that was going on.

[42:12] We put a lot of foundational stuff in place that I think is really setting the stage for 2021. So pump for that.

[42:19] And I would say there's more to this, but I'll probably end on this note, which is understanding and expanded time horizon has been a measureably valuable for me.

[42:36] And this is one of those things where you hear it all the time, right, but it doesn't become real for you. And I feel like it became real for me this year, which was

[42:48] I'm independently wealthy. I don't need any more money for the rest of my life. If we grow our current network at 10% a year will be worth $700 million, half a billion dollars by the time I'm 60.

[43:02] And that probably means I won't need anything I could stop working now.

[43:06] And that allows me to think from a slightly different perspective. But the thing is is that I think the reason that the rich get rich is because it allows them to think from this perspective.

[43:17] And so the hardest thing is trying to get yourself into this. And so I'm making like this is if there's anything that you listen to in this entire video, it is what I'm about to tell you.

[43:27] You can expand your time horizon beyond months and even a year or two. You will be so much better off.

[43:36] If you expand your time horizon beyond just a month or a year and actually start thinking in five year and ten year terms, you will be so much better off.

[43:47] And I think there's so many reasons for that. One is when you bet on long enough time horizons, you can virtually get rid of risk.

[43:56] And if you can make risk free guaranteed upside, then why would you not make those bets?

[44:04] The reason at warm buffets at this, you said, no one wants to get rich slow, right? But I would rather get rich for sure than get rich fast and lose it, right?

[44:12] Or more realistically, for many, trying to get rich fast for my entire life rather than just saying, well if I just did this for ten years, I'd be guaranteed to be a millionaire.

[44:20] And I think that is the issue. And I think that's the problem that the world has and that's why most people will never become wealthy is because they cannot delay their impatience. They cannot delay their gratification.

[44:34] And so for me, when I'm thinking about our businesses, I'm now really thinking like, do I think, and this is because I've been reading a lot about investor stuff.

[44:43] And I'm like, you know, private equity firms will come in and their goal will be to double a company, you know, in five years, right? Double a company in five years.

[44:52] And I think about that with like Jim launch and there's so many times where I'm like, oh, we got a double this year, why didn't we double?

[44:58] But if I'd said like, we just got a double in five and made the plan for that, the plan would look so much different and also so realistically attainable that I think we'd probably over perform that, but what it would do is eliminate the needless frenetic energy of, oh, we got to do this now, we got to, you know, like craziness of the shifts and the turns and, and like sure there's always things that you have to adapt to in the marketplace, but it just gives you this steadiness.

[45:27] As a leader and when you can look at five year goal, but like I've never even believed in five year goals as a from a goal perspective, but I think of it in terms of a timeline perspective of like, how am I measuring myself?

[45:41] Like when I think about where I was five years ago, it's not it's like not even comprehensible.

[45:46] And so I mean, I hope to have that kind of difference five years now, we'll see, but I think that if I can take a more steady approach.

[45:57] A more disciplined approach to growth and to value creation within the company.

[46:05] Everything that I've read about, you know, value based investing and how, you know, companies do turn around, which is really valuable if you ever do, you know, want to get into a reading topic, look at, you know, by buying and buying and flipping businesses.

[46:18] Because you look at what they're looking at in the business is what they can do to improve and so you can basically come in with fresh eyes to your own business and think like, what would I do if I were buying my business fresh from day one today, which is actually a really good thought exercise and so I've kind of walked through that process.

[46:33] And the things that I would do are different than what I'm actually doing.

[46:37] And so by expanding it to an investor's time horizon, I feel like I'm making much better decisions and I have much better perspective.

[46:45] And it's been, it's just incredibly calming because I think the reason that entrepreneurs, you know, the double edge sort of us is that we're emotional people, we, you know, we are getting so excited and then we all these ideas and we want to do all of them and the reality is that you can't, you just can't, you can't even do, you can't even do most of them.

[47:02] You can do a very, very, very small percentage of them and when a private equity buyer, for example, comes in to try and buy a business and improve it.

[47:11] They will, I'll tell you, actually, you know, I'll tell you what, this has been really enlightening for you, so I'll tell you what they do.

[47:16] So the first thing you do is you create a hundred-day plan.

[47:18] In the objective that hundred-day plan is to align the economic interest of the management with the fund who, in the investor who's buying it, right?

[47:27] And the way they do that is they first figure out what their primary two to three KPIs are going to be.

[47:34] That's it, two to three.

[47:36] And then they figure out how to accurately and meticulously track those things.

[47:42] So typically, you know, investors are known for, you know, cutting costs and increasing profits.

[47:47] That's like a standard thing that they'll do.

[47:50] But they increase the cost on IT and reporting, and diligence.

[47:56] And so for me thinking about that, it's like, okay, that just really shows how important the data and reporting is, which is kind of what I was alluding to earlier.

[48:03] And so they implement a lot of ERPs and CRM systems that they already have, you know, test and whatnot to get the tracking in real time around their KPIs.

[48:11] Now, the number one KPI that they track, which I found incredibly interesting, which we don't track, which is wild, is excess cash flow.

[48:20] And it's crazy because that's the thing I care the most about as the owner is one amount of pausing my bank account every month.

[48:26] But as financials become more sophisticated, you look at your profit and your EBITDA and like all the, you know, your P&L and you have to offset revenue based on the revenue.

[48:32] So, it's like, you know, offset revenue based on contract terms, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

[49:02] blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

[49:32] blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah

[50:02] and so it allows us to make more profit from less waste, it gives, like I said, more value, and it allows us to just focus on a couple of things without feeling the constant overwhelms.

[50:12] I actually think that our team, et cetera, itself would be happier with this type of approach.

[50:18] And so that is how I'm kind of shifting my perspective on our businesses now, could be of three of them, in doing that.

[50:26] And so that's been really cool.

[50:28] I've also taken on a number of small companies that I'm working with, so companies that are doing

[50:36] one to five million dollars a year, that are either consulting service, knowledge education,

[50:46] base businesses, or niche brick and mortar businesses that have the desire to franchise or

[50:53] scale nationally.

[50:55] And so that's the businesses that I know intimately.

[50:59] And so I'm actually working with some companies there.

[51:03] And that's crazy for me because if you think about from an investor standpoint, I have a

[51:07] company that I just recently became an advisor to and they'd been at half a million dollars a year

[51:15] for two years, I think.

[51:18] And now we're doing 150,000 a week, six months later, right?

[51:23] So that's from $500,000 a month to $600,000 a month, right?

[51:30] Wild.

[51:31] So pretty cool.

[51:33] Very exciting.

[51:35] And I'm just pumped.

[51:37] Pumped out the future.

[51:38] I think 2021's going to be a good year.

[51:41] I think there's a lot of cash on the sidelines, savings across the entire United States, like

[51:45] went up a ton, which means they're printing money and people are holding onto it, which means

[51:50] that when people start spending that money, we should see a boom overall.

[51:54] I do think that as we have an entirely democratic president, all three houses or whatever

[52:00] branches the government are all democratic, I don't think they're going to want to not look

[52:04] good.

[52:05] And so I think that they're going to pump the economy as much as they can, which will be

[52:09] good in the short term and we'll see in the long term.

[52:12] As much as everyone's really worried about the inflationary effects, which is definitely

[52:17] a concern, there's also really strong deflationary effects going on

[52:20] right now too.

[52:21] So I also think that the people who are running monetary policy are probably more knowledgeable

[52:27] than we are.

[52:28] It's literally what they do for a living full-time.

[52:32] So just something to consider there.

[52:34] But yeah, that was 2020.

[52:37] I hope you enjoyed this.

[52:42] It's different than the normal types of podcasts that I make.

[52:44] This is kind of the top of mind.

[52:47] The things that have been most meaningful for me.

[52:50] And I'm, I think I'm in the best mental place I've ever been, which is cool for

[52:57] me.

[52:58] I'm not a particularly, I would never have described myself as a particularly happy

[53:01] person.

[53:04] But I'm, I'm pretty close to happy.

[53:08] And I don't really like the word very much because I think it's really misleading.

[53:13] But I'm really, I'm really, I'm pretty fulfilled.

[53:16] I really like what I do.

[53:18] I think I'm good at it.

[53:19] So I find that fulfilling.

[53:20] I find it challenging.

[53:21] I love the game of entrepreneurship.

[53:23] And I'm very grateful to be able to play.

[53:28] I really am.

[53:29] And I'm going to leave you with one thing that I, so I talked to my 18-year-old neighbor.

[53:35] And he's having a hard time.

[53:37] He's got more stuff that's happened since the last time you've heard a podcast from me.

[53:41] Just personal stuff.

[53:42] And he's having trouble with the sacrifices that are required for entrepreneurs.

[53:48] You know, he's young.

[53:49] He wants that fun.

[53:51] And the thing is there's nothing wrong with that.

[53:54] It's just the question is, how bad do you want what you claim to want?

[53:57] Everybody wants a six pack.

[53:59] It's just that they want donuts more.

[54:01] They actually want donuts.

[54:03] They claim to want a six pack.

[54:05] But they want donuts more.

[54:06] And I think that that analogy is the same for business.

[54:10] He wants to be an entrepreneur.

[54:11] But it's hard to see your friends partying and having fun and living.

[54:17] They're youthful lives without you.

[54:20] And it's easy to rationalize and say, like, why should I enjoy my youth?

[54:24] And I'm not saying you shouldn't.

[54:25] I'm really not.

[54:27] I just know that if you, you know, the sooner you start investing in skills, and I'm

[54:30] saying he's going to, like, investing in skills is the thing, right?

[54:33] What he does to invest in the skills is irrelevant.

[54:35] But investing in skills is how he gets there and putting a disproportionate amount of

[54:39] time towards developing the skills will allow him to, you know, outpace the competition

[54:44] being, you know, everyone else.

[54:47] I said something that when I was 19 was a huge epiphany for me.

[54:50] So I'm just going to share it with you.

[54:53] I was dating a girl for two years in college.

[54:58] And she was very, very obsessed with happiness.

[55:02] It was like, it was her major, it was positive psychologists are major, and she was really

[55:05] obsessed with happiness.

[55:07] And she ended up being an amazing person, you know what I mean?

[55:13] But I think at the base, a relatively sad person.

[55:18] And I know that when we split up and during that time, because, you know, people rub off

[55:24] on you, I had become really, really interested in happiness.

[55:28] How do I optimize for happiness?

[55:29] It does make me happy, like all this stuff.

[55:31] And I think happy is a horrible term.

[55:33] I think it's a horrible term.

[55:35] I think it poisons so many people, you know?

[55:40] And I remember, you know, because you're kind of emotional and you're younger and we're

[55:45] emotional and we're older, we're just better hiding it.

[55:47] But when we split up, she and I, and I had these habits of, you know, reading all this

[55:56] positivity stuff in Boba, and I just remember going to this place where I was just like,

[56:01] fuck happiness.

[56:04] I'm just going to win.

[56:06] And that became my new kind of operating standard.

[56:10] I was like, fuck happiness.

[56:11] Like, I'm just going to move.

[56:13] I'm going to take so much action that I don't have to think about it.

[56:15] I don't have to think, I don't have to be alone with my thoughts, right?

[56:17] I'm just going to keep moving and I'm just going to keep getting better and I'm going

[56:21] to keep making progress.

[56:22] I don't care from happy.

[56:24] And a weird thing happened.

[56:27] Once I stopped obsessing about happiness, I actually think that I became more content.

[56:34] And the thing is, as I was constantly measuring myself before that to this, what I would

[56:39] say is that, you know, what consider an unrealistic expectation of the human existence.

[56:45] And always finding myself deficient.

[56:49] And so the desire for happiness creates an unfulfilled expectation that makes me unhappy.

[57:00] And just regarding happiness gives me permission to not give a fuck.

[57:08] And if I happen to be happy or enjoy a moment or find fulfillment in my work, then it

[57:14] becomes above my expectation.

[57:18] And so I have a positive experience.

[57:20] And so one of the biggest things that I have worked on, and this is what I was talking

[57:24] to my 18-year-old neighbor about, was the only reason that you were upset right now is because

[57:29] of a fictitious expectation that you arbitrarily made up in your mind that you were not

[57:34] reaching that you made up.

[57:37] It's like if I said I wanted to gain 20 pounds of muscle in seven days and then was upset

[57:40] that I didn't gain 20 pounds of muscle in seven days because I worked out hard.

[57:43] It's the same thing, right?

[57:45] I was like, you want to be a millionaire in your 19.

[57:47] I was like, do you feel like it's reasonable that you think that after two months of beginning

[57:53] your entrepreneurial journey that you don't earn above the top 1% in the United States?

[58:02] Do you feel like it's reasonable that after eight weeks of not being in school that you

[58:08] are not in the top 1%.

[58:10] It was like when you say it like that and I was like right, but that's what you're thinking.

[58:15] You're thinking like that, right?

[58:17] And so this kind of goes full circle with what I was saying earlier about having the extended

[58:21] time horizon.

[58:22] If we can extend our horizons, then we decrease our own expectations.

[58:28] And by doing so, we increase our fulfillment by default because we expect less or nothing.

[58:36] And while we increase our fulfillment during the process, we actually get better faster.

[58:43] And that was what I have in having him focus on is like, why don't we say, what's a five

[58:50] year goal that we believe is reasonable?

[58:53] And let's make it action based.

[58:55] All right.

[58:56] So instead of I want to make $400,000 a year in five years, why don't we say, what skills?

[59:02] Well, I need to have that would allow me to make $400,000 a year.

[59:05] And then what actions would I need to take to acquire those skills that would be reasonable

[59:09] even with poor talent that I would achieve that?

[59:13] And so for example, we determined that lead generation and sales if you want to be an entrepreneur

[59:18] would be valuable skills.

[59:20] And I said, okay, how do you think that we can go about guaranteeing virtually that you

[59:25] will have those skills?

[59:26] And he's like, well, reps.

[59:28] And I was like, right.

[59:30] So how do we get reps in?

[59:31] And how many reps do we feel like a reasonable?

[59:33] Right?

[59:34] I was like, you feel like if you'd make $25,000 a year, which is $100,000 a day.

[59:37] It's just $500,000 times 52 weeks.

[59:40] Right?

[59:41] You make $25,000.

[59:42] You'll be able to prospect and get business.

[59:44] You just like, yeah, I think I have $25,000, so that would be reasonable.

[59:47] Like, cool.

[59:48] Great.

[59:49] So that's one year.

[59:50] Next year, what do we do?

[59:51] Do you think if you took 20 high-take calls a week over 52 weeks, 1000 high-take

[59:59] aid phone call closes, you would be able to be at least proficient in sales?

[60:05] He's like, yeah, I think I could do that.

[60:07] I'm like, okay, we still have three years left on this timeline.

[60:10] But I can tell you right now, if you can generate leads and you can prospect for your

[60:13] own thing and you can sell at high-take amounts, you can make $400,000 a year.

[60:17] No problem.

[60:18] But we're only two years in.

[60:19] What else we're going to need?

[60:20] Well, I don't know what I'm selling.

[60:21] I'm like, it's great.

[60:22] So then we have to develop a skill that's valuable.

[60:24] And so at that point, I was like, I'm not going to make that goal right now.

[60:27] We're going to just develop these first two.

[60:28] And then after that, we're going to go develop the other ones.

[60:31] And so I hope these kind of anecdotes about my 18-year-old neighbor are useful for you.

[60:38] It's honestly been one of the, it's honestly been one of the most rewarding things for

[60:41] me.

[60:42] Because I feel like I can get to live.

[60:44] I can help someone not suffer as much as I did during their process and really shortcut

[60:50] the whole path to success.

[60:53] And it was, I love you guys for listening.

[60:56] This is, I appreciate those of you who find this valuable.

[61:00] This is really just my mental diary for myself so that I can look back and maybe hopefully

[61:07] in decades to come, I'll be among the billionaire brothers who donates their life.

[61:12] They're just networked to some meaningful cause and they'll be like, dude, you gotta listen,

[61:16] they're almost his old stuff.

[61:18] And so hopefully that's what these are.

[61:20] So anyways, I appreciate you all.

[61:23] I'm focusing on simple, I'm focusing on longer time horizons, I'm focusing on finding

[61:28] good people.

[61:29] I'm focusing on getting them focused on just a handful of things and just driving those and

[61:34] doing, living a boring, but steady business life.

[61:41] And trying to come into it with no expectations and being pleasantly surprised about

[61:49] anything that happens.

[61:51] And so that is my outlook and I know that the world has been rough.

[61:56] My recommendation is to turn off all media.

[61:59] I'd removed all the media from my phone because I thought it was especially overwhelming.

[62:05] And I realized that my life was really the same without all of the news.

[62:10] So hopefully that's why before you and I know that the news does not make me more money.

[62:16] And I also know that the news does not help me prepare for what is to come independently

[62:20] because I think to myself, well, what would I do differently than I'm currently doing if these

[62:24] things were to happen and the answer is nothing, which means it's not really providing me

[62:26] value.

[62:27] And if it's like, well, I need to stay informed.

[62:29] If there's anything major, I'll find out.

[62:31] I don't need to go surf the news to go do that.

[62:36] So anyways, 2021, I think is a me good year for a lot of us.

[62:41] I think a lot of people grew a lot in 2020.

[62:43] And so as a result, their businesses will grow in 2021.

[62:46] Like a personal year, I personally grew more in 2020 than I did in any other year.

[62:51] And I think that we're going to, I think the result of that is going to show in 2021.

[62:56] So keeping amazing and keeping awesome, lots of love.

[63:00] And I will catch you guys in the next Fed.

[63:03] Bye!
